“Have you considered that maybe I don’t enjoy playing third wheel to you and your new vampire boyfriend?”, Cas spat back at him. He was seething. Dean had never seen him this angry before. It was kind of hot.
As they drove back to the bunker, Cas tentatively reached across the seat of the Impala and pressed his palm into Dean’s thigh, rubbing his thumb along the denim of Dean’s jeans. Dean gasped, looking down at Cas’ hand for a moment before giving Cas a shy smile. This is how it was always meant to be.
Iris shook her head and threw her hand up in Dean’s direction. “Whoa. You’re going to drop that bomb on me and then expect me to just sit here all day? No. I’m coming with you.”
Her room was almost identical to their own, except with personal items scattered all over the bed and floor. Two bags sat in the corner, one stacked on top of the other. Dean very quickly realized the one on the bottom was Laurel’s, undisturbed and unused since she disappeared. He let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.
“My own misunderstandings aside, the way I spoke to you was inappropriate. I apologize. I haven’t reported this morning’s altercation to Cesar and I don’t plan to; whether you choose to make your own statement is up to you.”
He watched the plunger smoothly push viscous liquid into Cas’s bloodstream. Rowena took a step back, shooting him a significant look.
For the shit they were saying, especially Singer, neither of them seemed particularly upset about it. Dean snuck a glance at Lafitte, who looked a little more amused than his usual good humor, and Turner, who wasn’t trying to hide his laughter, and figured that was just how they were. Seemed like a lieutenant he could get along with better than Moncrieff, at least.
Charlie herself would be staying linked in to the server, waiting for Kevin to make a repeat appearance and poking around to see what else she could turn up in the logs and code that less elite, less skilled individuals may have missed. That seemed like as good a place as any to start, especially since it didn’t require leaving the hotel and he wasn’t sure he could be trusted around people in reality yet. Cas, and especially his reaction to Cas, had shaken him enough that he figured it might be best to keep the world out of punching range for the time being.
When Cas looked ready to keep arguing, Cesar fixed him with a hard stare, made all the steelier by the almost-smiling tick at the corner of his lips. “Dean’s presence on this team is final. Yours doesn’t have to be.”
“Hey, at least that’s an opportunity to redo training,” Cas shrugged, storming over to her. “So you can learn basic shit like working with a crew and the value of human life. Clearly, you skipped some classes.”
It was too much, too intense in that already intimate setting. Their relationship may have been more fake than anything Dean had ever lied about before in his life, but it didn’t feel it when Castiel was still holding him and looking at him like he mattered, and that was just as dangerous as anything else about their time undercover in the middle of Styne territory. If Castiel was going to take point on dealing with Junior, then the least Dean could do was keep his creeping feelings in check.
Except that they were far more developed than Earth could ever hope to be. And much nicer and harmonious and harmless. Like Canada to Earth’s America, without the attempts to stifle indigenous voices and assorted human contrivances . . .
Sam looked down at his hands, clasped together with frustration at the situation. They had won, technically. Chuck was defeated with Jack’s help. Jack, now considered the acting God, had plenty of business to attend to in Heaven. Before he left, though, Dean begged Jack to bring Cas back.
“That’s right, you guys aren’t from around here,” Iris seemed surprised that they didn’t know anything, “Laurel went missing a few weeks ago. From this hotel, actually. No one’s heard from her since.”
Dean winked at him and Cas couldn’t help the small smile that spread across his face. “I can wait until you’re off the clock. I’ll pick you up. What time?”
Iris’ hand fell back to her side as the gurney was wheeled away. Dean watched her go, not noticing that Cas had moved to join him, wrapping an arm around his waist.
Sam moved to sit next to Cas on the bed, waving away Cas’ apology. “Whatever, dude. How’d you do it? Was it a spell?”
“That’s okay, Dean. I was already awake. I couldn’t sleep. It’s too cold.” Cas sat up and scooted closer to where Dean was spread out. “Do you want to talk about your dream?”
Dean picked Cas up at five o’ clock on the dot as promised. The case seemed simple for Dean’s standards, but Cas wasn’t going to point that out if it meant they could spend more time together.
It took them much longer than anticipated to reach California, but Dean didn’t mind. It just meant he had more time to hold Cas’ hand across the front bench of the Impala. Soon enough, they finally reached the ocean. Dean drove onto the beach, the tires leaving indentations in the sand behind them. The sun was setting quickly, so they needed to move quickly to set up camp. Having realized this, Dean moved quickly to remove their items from the back of the car. Before he could, though, Cas grabbed his hand and pulled Dean toward him, their chests resting together. “Come with me.”
Back in Iris’ room, Dean avoided looking directly at Cas. The alcohol was wearing off, and the post-drinking anxiety was settling in. He made a mistake. He shouldn’t have kissed Cas again, he shouldn’t have taken advantage like that. Cas didn’t feel the same way. Cas probably thought Dean was still faking it, and that’s why he went along with it in the first place. He tried to focus on what Iris was telling them, but his mind felt like it had been crushed by a steamroller.
Dean turned to the clerk, smiled lazily and slurred his words as he responded, “Hey! Sorry, man. We had a few drinks over at the bar and saw the door open, wanted some privacy. You know how it is.” Dean gave him a wink to really sell it.
Dean snorted. “Screw slowly, dude. We’ve known each other how many years now? We’re far past slowly at this point.”
Dean took a deep breath, trying to control himself. “So… you’re my ‘True Love’, huh? It’s like that fairytale garbage. We’ve been such idiots. All it took was me becoming a demon to figure it out.”
Dean moved his hand to gently cup Cas’ chin, and Cas leaned into it. Dean kissed Cas again, slowly this time, as though he wanted to savor the moment. Cas felt like he might cry, for an entirely different reason than when he was sleeping on a gas station floor. Cas felt…
Dean surged up from where he sat below Cas, pulling Cas on top of him and pressing their mouths together again. He felt frenzied now, he wanted everything and anything Cas would give him. His hands moved to push Cas’ jacket all the way off, before travelling down his body to feel underneath Cas’ t-shirt. The warm skin that met him made Dean groan, and Cas let go of Dean for a brief moment to pull both of their shirts off. Before Dean knew what was happening, they were both completely undressed, and Cas was back on top of him.
Iris coughed again and it shook her entire form. “I just wanted… to say thank you. You saved me. That woman… Marisa… she made me hurt people. I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I’m sorry.”
“The price was my life. When I experienced a moment of true happiness, The Empty would be summoned, and it would take me forever.”
“I regard you very highly, Dean. I also know you very well, and I understand that your childhood does have an impact on your capacity for emotional vulnerability.”
Dean took one look at Cas and it immediately took his breath away. Cas had forgone his usual trenchcoat, choosing instead to wear one of Dean’s sweaters with some very well-fitting jeans. The idea of Cas wearing his clothing on their first date made his face heat up. Giving Cas a nervous smile and unconsciously moving his hand up to rub against the back of his neck, Dean stuttered, “I-It’s okay, man. You almost ready to head out?”
Dean looked down, hiding the tears pricking at the corner of his eyes at the mention of Cas’ name. Benny reached out, pulling Dean into a hug. Dean understood what Benny was trying to tell him. Maybe in another life, it could have been himself and the vampire against the world. But for now… they had to go their separate ways.
Dean and Cas jumped apart immediately at Benny’s interruption, avoiding eye contact to focus on where Benny’s voice had come from. As Benny approached them, Cas gave Dean a look that was heavy with emotion before turning around to lead the way.
Cas mouth fell open slightly, looking at Dean with something he could only describe as pure wonder. “You have feelings for me,” Cas said, a statement rather than a question.
He had two options here. He could be a coward, like usual, and let this mixtape thing be forgotten over time as they continue to dance around one another. Or he could confront his friend and potentially destroy their relationship. Eventually, Dean gathered his things and moved back toward the bunker.
“Yeah? Well, what am I supposed to do? Cas is gone, Sam. I’m not going to pretend things are all hunky-dory.”
Cas looked confused. “No, Dean. We only packed items that we thought might be useful on the trip. How would we fit the entire bunker into these bags?”
“There ya go,” Dean said, handing the items to Cas. Cas stared down at the clothing for a moment, before reaching out to collect them from Dean. His fingers brushed over Dean’s and lingered for a moment, before he finally pressed the clothing against his chest and took a step back toward Dean’s still open bedroom door.
The next morning, Dean knocked on Cas’ bedroom door and called out, “Hey man, I found a case and and I was wondering if you would, uh, want to come with me.”
Cas closed his eyes, taking a moment before responding. “I love you too, Dean.” Cas said, with the biggest smile on his face. Dean thought it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. “I’ve loved you since I pulled you out of Hell. You changed me for the better, that day and every day since then. I would be honored to wake up with you every day. I am grateful for every moment I get to spend with you.”
Dean sat straight up at that, hitting his head on the roof of the car. He rubbed at the bump forming on his scalp while trying to process the lyrics that were still playing repeatedly in his mind. What did Cas mean by putting this song on a mixtape he made specifically for Dean? Probably nothing, he tried to reason with himself. This is just one of Cas’ favorite songs. It doesn’t have anything to do with Dean. Maybe Cas was trying to tell Dean that he was interested in someone else. Maybe Cas
Cas merely stood up and looked at Dean sadly before making his way back toward the remnants of smoldering fire.
The parking lot was a mess of emergency vehicles, bright sirens shining through the dark Nebraska sky. Dean and Castiel had been escorted out of the building and wrapped in scratchy gray shock blankets as soon as the police arrived. Dean frantically scanned the area for anything suggesting that Iris might still be alive. Cas, sat beside him on the back of an ambulance, reached out to press a comforting hand into Dean’s upper thigh. Dean felt himself heat up, but this time he didn’t try to hide it.
Cas tried to interrupt, giving Sam a pointed look. “Dean, you don’t want to listen to this. You’re still exhausted.”
Dean pulled him in for a hug, wrapping his arms around Cas’ shoulders. Cas stood there for a moment, unsure where they stood after everything that had happened, before slowly placing his hands on Dean’s hips. Dean pressed his nose into Castiel’s neck, breathing him in. He pulled back to look into Cas’ eyes. “We didn’t think it worked.”
Dean grumbled something unintelligible before shuffling down the hallway to his room. He returned quickly, shoving the jacket into Sam’s hands before seating himself at the table again. Sam ran his fingers over the handprint, contemplating his next move. The blood was dry and cracked, but still usable. He grabbed a bowl that was left on the table and began scratching at the bloody print with his pocketknife. Deep red flakes fell from the jacket slowly until Sam was satisfied with his work. Sam looked over at Dean, only to discover that tears were falling down Dean’s face as he stared at the jacket in Sam’s hands. Dean shook his head when he realized Sam was watching and pressed his fists into his eyes before mumbling, “That’s all I have left of him.”
Dean stared at Cas’ retreating back, still replaying the memory of Cas’ face moving closer to his over and over in his head. “Yeah, let’s go.”
The morning after… whatever happened between Dean and Benny wasn’t as awkward as Dean expected. Dean didn’t want to think about it. Benny was acting normal, so he could act normal too. Just guys bein’ dudes. Relieving some tension. He had been stressed, and it felt good to enjoy himself for once. It felt good to do something
The next customer in line tapped his hand on the counter to get Cas’ attention. “Hey buddy, I don’t got all day.”
“I know, Dean. It’s okay.” Cas pressed his palm to Dean’s chest, and a calming warmth spread through his body as it healed. “She must have known that we weren’t actually in a relationship when we first checked into the hotel, but recognized that things had changed after…”
Cas pursed his lips for longer than Dean could handle before taking his glasses off and standing up from the table to move toward the sink. He rinsed out his mug before turning back around to face Dean, bracing himself on the counter behind him.
They opened each door, looking for a file cabinet or desk that might contain anything they needed. Dean was starting to think this mission was hopeless, when he heard Cas call after him from the end of the hall. Dean ran toward Cas’ voice, and found him elbow deep in a messy box of papers.
“Morning, Cas,” Sam said, with the air of a man who was trying to be as normal as possible about his brother and his best friend sleeping together. “Well. I’ll leave you to it.”
If Benny noticed, Dean was being more obvious with his moping than he had originally thought. He sighed before responding, “I’m sick of it here. I want to shower. I want to see my brother. I want to find Cas. And I want this
. He groaned internally. It was a much later start than he’d planned on getting, but that’s what happens when you spend half the night making out with your best friend and subsequently having a sexuality crisis.
Dean looked away and rubbed his neck nervously. “Uh, yeah, no… he’s busy with research today, but I could still use some help on this one.” Dean knew he was bad at lying, but he hoped Cas wouldn’t pick up on it now that he was human. He had a plan, and a majority of that plan revolved around trapping Cas in the Impala with him so he couldn’t escape when Dean tried to bring up the nature of their relationship.
Once seated, Cas was still avoiding eye contact with Dean. Dean sighed and asked, “What gives, man? Are you mad at me or somethin’?”
He turned to Cas, flinching at the pain in his shoulder. “Cas, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean any of the things I said. She- She made me say them.”
Dean rolled his eyes, fondness washing over him. Remembering that they’re meant to be faking a relationship right now, Dean casually extended his arm across the back of the bench, his fingers resting along Cas’ shoulder blade.
Dean didn’t have long to ruminate, because before he could say anything in response, Cas had Marisa pinned to the floor with her hands behind her back.
Dean, shaky but trying not to break down in front of his three-year-old son, nodded slowly to show Jack that he understood. Pursing his lips, he drummed his fingers on the table a few times before pushing out of his chair and walking silently to his room, closing the door behind him. Sam looked between Dean’s retreating figure and Jack, who now was fidgeting uncomfortably in his chair. Sam reached out to place a comforting hand on Jack’s shoulder. “It’ll be okay, bud. We’ll figure this out.”
Cas and Sam split up, covering each corner of the bunker to try to sneak up on Dean. Cas ended up in a back hallway, praying to whatever might be listening that Dean was still in the bunker. As Cas rounded a corner, his prayers seemed to have been answered, as he runs right into Dean’s chest. The last thing Cas sees is blackened eyes before he’s slammed up against a hard surface.
“…So, Iris. I don’t mean to pry, but why are you still here after what happened? If it were me, I woulda packed up and skipped town.”
Cas had been living with them in the bunker for a few months now. He finally had his own room, which Dean helped furnish with a trip to IKEA that resulted in a three-hour long argument about bedframes. Who knew angels could be so picky about interior design?
Sam held up his hand to stop Cas from saying anything else, before leaning toward Dean to explain. “Cas and I had a…
“Yeah, that’d be great.” Dean shuffled over to sit at the kitchen table, waiting for Cas to join him. Cas finished brewing the coffee and set one of the mugs down in front of Dean. They sat in comfortable silence, checking their phones, and slowly sipping their drinks. Dean felt jittery, though, and not from the caffeine. “Cas, I gotta say something – “
Cas looked around the room at the number of injured people on the floor. “We should call the police.”
Dean reached up to his own face to place his hands over Cas’ and rested their foreheads together. They both started giggling uncontrollably. “You love me,” Dean said, looking into those beautiful blue eyes.
Dean smirked at Cas. “Aw, the little angel thought he might stand a chance against me. That’s cute.” Dean slid the angel blade out from Cas’ hands, which were pressed above Castiel’s head now. Dean leaned in, only a millimeter from Cas’ face. Cas looked from side to side, hoping to find something that might help him out of his unfortunate position, but Dean had Cas pinned against the wall. Cas was out of options. He had to at least try, didn’t he? For Dean. Cas mustered all of his strength and pressed forward, attaching his mouth to Dean’s. It was clinical, almost. A simple press of lips. And then as soon as the kiss had started, it was abruptly ended by Dean pushing Cas off of him.
Dean groaned, but was secretly happy to take care of dinner, as long as he got to do it with Cas. While Cas started unpacking their food, Dean reached for the cooler. He grabbed four beers and started handing them out.
Cas looked away and didn’t answer. Dean groaned and rubbed his palms down his face, placing his elbows on the table to rest his head. “Alright. I’m sorry, dude. I didn’t mean to upset you. Can we just move past this and enjoy the rest of the night?” Dean begged, embarrassed by how needy he sounded.
Cas paused, considering Dean’s request. “Well, we obviously can’t tell people that I pulled you out of Hell.”
Cas gasped at the contact, relieved by the feeling of Dean’s skin against his own, and Dean decided that was the most beautiful sound he’d ever heard. They easily found a rhythm, Dean thrusting against Cas and Cas using his entire bodyweight to push Dean into the mattress.
Dean couldn’t breathe. He was so used to Castiel’s giant trenchcoat covering him completely, but Dean had to admit… Cas wasn’t bad looking at all. The old band shirt he had given him earlier clung to the angel’s chest, and the jeans fit perfectly. He imagined, briefly, what it would be like if Cas always dressed like this, if they had a normal life where they went out to eat together at the local diners and didn’t have to look over their shoulders with paranoia at the possibility of a demon attack.
Sam shook his head and laughed at his older brother. Dean’s eyes were lit up with excitement, though, and who was he to ruin that? “Sure, Dean. Sounds good.”
Eventually, they reached the peak. Cas grabbed Dean by the wrist and looked into his eyes for an excruciating amount of time, long enough that a second wave of Leviathans was able to accumulate at the bottom of the cliff.
The corner of Jack’s mouth moved up to form a small smile as he shyly looked up at Sam. “Thank you, Sam. I think it is time for me to take my leave, though. I’ll be back soon.”
Dean pulled away, suddenly hyperaware of the throngs of people moving around them. “We should… We should take this upstairs.”
Cas stood across from Dean, hands pressed into his thighs. The angel’s eyebrows shot up, shocked by Dean’s sudden outburst. “I did not realize my absence would impact you so severely, Dean. I apologize. If it is any consolation, I feel the same way,” Cas said, sympathy etched into his features.
By the end of the tour, Cas was waxing poetic to Sam about the efficiency of hexagonal honeycombs and Sam was attempting to keep up with the conversation. With Cas distracted, Dean snuck off to the gift shop to make a purchase. He came back with a pair of socks with cartoon bumblebees on them, which Castiel was so delighted to receive that he kissed Dean in front of Sam, Jack, and their tour guide. Dean didn’t mind.
“So we’ll stay here tonight, and then I can drive you back to work in the morning on my way out of town.”
Dean coughed. “Definitely been better. That was really good, those things you said to her. How did you know it would work?”
As soon as the kiss started, it was over. Cas pulled back, eyes wide with surprise. Dean started to say something, anything, but Cas was already turning on his heels to close himself into the bathroom. All Dean could do was stand locked in place, his hands that were only a moment ago wrapped around Castiel’s waist moved to hold his own face.
Quirking an eyebrow at Sam in the rearview mirror, Dean pulled to a stop at a red light before reaching over to give Cas an obnoxious kiss, releasing his lips with a loud pop. “Jealous much, Sammy?”
“If you’ve put so much thought into this, why don’t you go first then? When did we fall in love?” Dean asked, a playful smirk on his face.
Sam mimed a gagging motion at the display, while Jack looked on with glee. “I didn’t know you and Dad were married!”
Cas had an unreadable expression on his face as he walked back to his own bedroom. Dean watched him leave, an uncomfortable feeling settling over him for reasons he couldn’t figure out.
“Cas... Cas!” Dean yelled over the music that was far too loud for his forty-year-old ears, “Let’s dance.”
“Well, I am sorry that your friend didn’t make it. He was a good fighter and I know how much he meant to you.”
Cas, still very obviously nervous, leaned back against the headboard and stretched his legs out in front of him. Dean watched him silently, finding the display completely endearing. He smiled to himself, hiding his face beneath the plush white comforter. He was slowly lulled to sleep by the sound of Cas’ breathing next to him, comforted in a way he hadn’t been in a long time.
Cas let Dean know when and where to pick him up in a few short hours, and then he walked out the front door, already having eaten three-quarters of the chocolate bar he purchased moments ago. Cas watched him pull out of the parking lot through the window. He missed Dean desperately. All Cas wanted… All Cas
Cas pressed his chest against Dean’s and kissed him softly, like he was scared of breaking Dean into pieces. Dean suddenly realized that it was very possible for Cas to actually do that, in more ways than one.
In their bed away from the world, they hashed out all their remaining insecurities. Cas worried that Dean wouldn’t like his physical body with its cybernetic parts; Dean worried that he’d taken advantage of Cas when he was vulnerable after his zone and there wasn’t really anything there. They were both wrong.
Sam cleared his throat, interrupting . . . whatever had been happening there. “You wanna take a seat so we can start the timer?”
“Go inside?” he hissed even as he moved to comply, an Oziomei gun braced within his grip. She led the way through a long, dreary corridor with him almost running to catch up. For a moment, he thought she wouldn’t answer.
“Cut the water,” he told the nearest person, not caring if they were involved or not. His department may not have been as well-maintained as Michigan’s, but he knew how the barracks worked. If they couldn’t do it they would get the message to someone who could or be considered negligent in their duties, and consequences for that were grave no matter where it happened. Trusting his order would be carried out by the time he reached it, he started toward the center of the commotion.
“You’ll call me if you need anything, right?” his dad asked for the eighteenth time that morning. “If you want to come home early…”
Being on the receiving end of scrutiny from three seasoned detectives wasn’t a comfortable feeling; no wonder the weak ones confessed easy. But in the end, all that happened was that Turner said, “No shit?” and Novak gave him an assessing look.
Looking down at himself, Dean laughed and tried to wipe at the mess with his discarded flannel. All that accomplished was smearing the soil and sweat around. That wasn’t quite true. It also succeeded in making Cas wish desperately to be anywhere else, or for Dean to be anywhere else, before the very embarrassing situation happening in his pants—in Jimmy’s pants, because he was absolutely the worst brother—made itself obvious.
“Yeah, but it also might not. And experience is great and all, but the whole point of the program is so you can learn stuff. They’ve already got a bunch of lion doctors or whatever, they won’t be expecting you to know it all. Though I know that’s hard for you, being such a know-it-all all the time.”
Shaking his head, Cas looked to Balthazar, who sighed and grimaced but nodded. “It’s not exactly why I was hoping to show you how to sneak out of the cabin after curfew, but I suppose it’s still for a good cause. You’re on your own to get back, though. I have a date with Bela.”
“Oh,” Sam’s voice rose in clarity. “Yeah, yeah, Bobby was telling me about him. Sounds like a stand-up guy . . . substance-abuse issues aside.”
He waited for everyone to nod, Dean included, before tapping his tablet to project an image of a teenage boy onto the center of the table.
“He’s been at Kevin‘s all day, but he should get dropped off before we get home.” Glancing at the car clock, she smiled. “In fact, he’s probably already trying to steal samples and ducking Dean’s projectile spoons.”
Eventually a light snoring filled the cabin. Something about the way it squeaked cartoonishly at the end made him think it was Garth; Balthazar agreed, which he demonstrated by flailing insistently from his own bunk until his hand caught Cas in the face. Cas grabbed a few of the offending fingers and squeezed a little harder than was necessary to prove he got the message.
Dean opened his mouth to decline, figuring it would be as easy as that—he’d only been around once for a man who hadn’t taken well to being told no at his usual spot, which had less old-guard honor than the Eagle, but even there the pushy asshole had been out on his ass with a black eye within five minutes. Novak just had to make it more complicated than that, though. He slid his arm behind Dean, curled it around his waist and used it to pull him in so his entire back pressed one long line into Novak’s side and his ass rested against Novak’s thigh.
But Cas wasn’t there. In the darkness that wasn’t really darkness, where Dean could have seen despite the lack of light if there had been anything to see, there was nothing. His chest felt empty.
This was just pre-flight jitters. If nothing else, Gabriel was running their old organization now, so it wouldn’t look good if he got a crew yeeted into space unconscious. The new Director would keep that in mind. Probably. Maybe. Hopefully.
Dean snorted. “You don’t think this is a bit of an overreaction? Mauling me for giving you a little nick?”
“Cas, let me,” Sam gently shouldered him to the side. Claire extended a pale hand through the bars and Cas gripped it tight enough that Dean saw her skin turn whiter.
He’d gotten the call through his personal Wave-Linker. He’d accepted the offer, stealing away in the dead of the night with an excuse scribbled on a sticky note.
At last he spotted something in the distance, slipping between gaps in the crowd, and even though he couldn’t make out the form amidst the bustle and digital neon, he felt it and just knew. He’d found Cas.
He felt his face heat up. He soldiered on, rolling his eyes, “And we should all be setting up a containment barrier in the control room. Just in case. But I don’t see you moving your ass.”
It was three days later, while Dean was still in the surveillance stage of his plans, that the next break in his self-assigned case came in. It also happened to be a break in the real case, the unit’s investigation into the Styne family, so the fact that Dean got to hear about it at all was itself a step in the right direction.
“Dean.” Oh, great. Now Cas was here. Not with his kids, but across the room. Very close to Dean. He wanted to tell the man to go back to them, but his tongue felt really heavy. He made a small noise instead, hoping it got the message across.
“Of him,” corrected Charlie. “Hit the techie servers four years back and made waves, everyone’s looking at him for something big. Real genius. Prodigy, like Cesar said.”
Dean’s lasagna was great, vegetables and all. The whole family was great, even if being there with all of them was so overwhelming that Cas only came away with vague impressions of all of them being smart and nice and loving each other. He wouldn’t have been able to produce any solid examples of anything that had happened at the table after the second he stood up from it at the end of dinner.
If they stayed alive to do any more investigation, which didn’t seem like a sure thing with the way Novak looked Junior over and asked, voice still flat, “Should I?”
“Dean Winchester,” he answered. Cesar’s hand was warm and dry, his grip firm. “Thanks for giving me this opportunity, I won’t let you down.”
“That was an even better show than I was expecting! Great work—Jimmy, yeah? Great fucking work, man, you really gave it to him. How’s that feeling there, pretty boy?”
“Take your usual sentinel level of people skills,” she said, “and cut that by about a third, then you’ve got Cas.”
He didn’t get any further than that. The person next to Balthazar’s abandoned plate had looked up at the commotion, and Cas hadn’t paid any attention because he had more important things to deal with. But then that person interrupted his rant with their own, loud, “What the fuck?” and Cas remembered himself enough to pause and apologize before getting back to telling off Balthazar.
What really did it, though, were the black hankie folded into Novak’s left front pocket and the dark wooden paddle hanging beside it like it lived there.
They didn’t talk as they disarmed the men, dividing the work in silent understanding. Dean patted Adler down with ruthless satisfaction, not surprised to find that all he had was the department-issued pistol in his hip holster, and he relieved the piece of shit of his badge while he was at it. Only when all three had been searched and secured with belts and ties—Adler’s tighter than the rest because Dean was feeling righteously spiteful—did they even look at each other.
He didn’t care about Gabriel’s next plea, he pocketed his lockpick and shut the safe, pocketing the key. Slipped out of the room and into the exposed vent he’d entered from. He’d claim he was getting too old to shuffle through vents for a mile straight, but well, he could say that about space travel too. Or sneaking away in the dead of the night. Or running away from his problems.
“Yeah, and how is that different from the maintenance that you got a few weeks before that, when you left Ash high and dry with no one to watch his back when he was plugged in? Hey Dean,” she added without looking at him, “how about you tell Cas here when they approached you for a spot on this particular team?”
, the layers of depth wrapped up in a single word—that’s how Cas says it. And maybe he didn’t notice because he wasn’t listening at the right time. He was listening for a change, for Cas to call him something new and affectionate like he’d started to do.
Charlie made a high-pitched sound but didn’t say anything. Dean glanced at her and she echoed his ‘tell ya later’ gesture at him. He snorted.
Dean scowled, pushing to his feet. Against the backdrop of snarls from invisible hounds, Ketch forced Cas, Kaia and Sam to the other side of the room. He knew where this was headed. With a firm press, he propelled Claire away from himself and to her father.
“That’s more incentive than threat,” Cas snarked back without missing a beat. But there was an adorable dusting of red darkening his cheeks.
Back at the house, Castiel was waiting where Dean had left him. But he had a stack of notebooks in one hand and his dollhouse in the other, which was all the proof Dean needed that he was done being a fucking moron. Junior, Adler, and the other asshole were still out. He should’ve told Lafitte to send medics, too, but he hadn’t been sure how to word it and honestly none of them were worth the time of figuring it out.
Guys who’d spent years training for shit like what they were proposing still ended up dead on a regular basis, and they were trying to get away with it on half a night’s crazed planning with a couple other morons fueled by Chicago’s most questionable coffee. There was absolutely no reason to think they would make it out alive. But Dean didn’t see much future for himself anyway, and he’d always assumed he was going to die on the job. At least he would get to go out doing real police work, maybe even do a bit of good if they managed to pass on the right information before everything went to shit.
He chuckled fondly, “I doubt anyone in the crew ever forgot. You only ranted about it every other week.” And that trip down memory lane wasn’t helping at all, because Cas delivering impassioned monologues about plucked flora had always made him go warm inside. Normal people didn’t give a shit about that stuff, not really. Not that Cas was abnormal. He was just special. (Yeah, that sounded like every teacher he’d had in middle school.)
“Imma need you to stay in me forever,” Dean responded as the fingers against his mouth fell lax. He took them into his mouth, running his tongue over the salty calluses. Cas stared down at him, making pained little sounds.
“You overthinking again, Cas?” he smiled. He could almost see pre-flight Cas jiggling his leg on the back of his eyelids.
“You going senile or you always been this dumb and I just forgot since I don’t have to put up with you every day anymore? It’s the kind of joint with people fucking in the shitter, Bobby. Goddamn attendant, don’t even start with that shit…”
Looking like it pained him, Castiel shook his head. “I don’t think so. Even if we did, there’s no chance he and Adler wouldn’t talk it over and figure out what happened. We’d be dead anyway.”
“I don’t know, his wife died while we were away,” Dean mumbled, refusing to look at Sam as he twisted the ignition. Baby roared to life, and Dean flicked on the radio to fill the stunned silence.
Novak’s hard stare said no, though his lips said nothing. If he hadn’t known to look for it, Dean wouldn’t have been able to tell that Novak was actually looking past him to the stairs. Didn’t mean he wasn’t still clearly waiting for an acknowledgment.
Before Dean could react, or even untangle himself from the other man, he felt a sharp pinch at the back of his neck. The world swirled a little bit.
“Just that they separated when I was a few months old and decided it would be best for her not to be part of my life.”
The space before them was . . . empty. Black. Impossibly bare. No stars, no containers, no nothing. “Is that . . . is that the air?”
“He seems pretty docile,” Cas whispers back without breaking eye contact. He feels silly at the impulse; everyone around them is being much louder and clearly the bull doesn’t care, but he’s the only one being stared down at the moment. He’d rather come across as foolish than inadvertently do something to set it off.
. How long had he been planning this? “I figured we could be a little sappy.” In his palm were two rings. Plain, elegant bands. One with a deep blue line of stone running down the middle and one with a green one. “So?”
The look Cas fixed him with could have melted pseudoplastic, but Dean was made of stronger stuff. He stared right back, setting his jaw and trying not to feel too ridiculous that he was still holding his empty coffee cup and half-eaten breakfast while facing off against a half-cyborg sentinel in a narrow hotel hallway. The pinprick intensity of Cas’s eyes made it harder both to keep up the gaze and to look away, but Dean held out until Cas scoffed and his mechanical pupils zoomed and refocused—though they didn’t leave Dean.
With nothing better to do after Charlie kicked him off the server so she could get some work done, he figured he should head over to the Trans’ to see if his partner was comatose in a zone yet. Cas had taken the car, of course, so he tracked down one of the officers stationed at the hotel for options. Since they didn’t have another vehicle they could spare indefinitely, they ended up sending a trainee from the barracks to give him a ride. Their trip was silent; the kid probably resented Dean for dragging him out of his actual work and Dean definitely resented everything about the situation.
“I’ll get you that number,” Castiel added, his hand still warm and firm against Dean’s arm, not pulling away even after he’d made his point. “But I don’t want you to worry. Remember why we decided I needed to take this job? So that I could look after you, make sure you’re taken care of. Junior’s gonna give me everything I need to do that, as long as I do right by him. So don’t worry, all right?”
“What will you achieve in ten minutes?” she asked earnestly. And nope. He called over Cas’s spluttering, “I’ll tell you later. Run along now.”
He grimaced up at him as he was forced to maneuver the poky points out of the way. Cool fingers slipped under his shirt and travelled up his torso. Apparently, Dean was just a scooch more alluring than wispy yarn. (An ego boost if he’d ever seen one.) “You know, Star Wars references are in bad taste. Given our predicament.”
Waking up the next morning, Cas still felt like crap. The only positive was that he knew it would be resolved within twenty-four hours. One more day; that was all he’d promised Jimmy. There was bound to be fallout, and maybe it was going to end up being even more painful than what he was going through with Dean. If Jody and Dean and Sam and Mary hated him, well, it would be awful and he would have regrets for the rest of his life. But at least he would know he’d done his best and been honest about everything.
“You know what?” Cas didn’t let him get a word in. He threw his arms up, turning to face Dean head on. “You
Then, with another pointed look at Cas, she added, “Well, no one’s in very much trouble, since their parents understand that they had a lot of strong and valid emotions driving their completely reckless and dangerous decisions, and it’s entirely their parents’ faults to begin with. But whatever this is,”—she waved her hand between him and Dean—“if it’s anything, no one’s mad. Just concerned and going to make everyone involved talk about it a truly uncomfortable amount. Okay?”
She pursed her lips thoughtfully, swallowing. She looked up and nodded solemnly. “This drink . . . I like it.”
The main door opened to a stairway landing where a man with graying hair, an impressive beard, and a gleaming black leather chest harness took his time looking them over. Dean fought the urge to cross his arms and glare a challenge, but was less successful against the heat that spread over his cheeks again. Fuck, when had he turned into a blushing goddamn virgin? At least Novak wasn’t seeing it happen again.
“Shut up,” he told them, hefting the wooden crate and wincing at the splinters that immediately pierced his skin. Walked up to the Stepford white doorway and knocked. Hopped from foot to foot like Sam at age three, post diapers.
“Cas, maybe we shouldꟷ” Gabriel started, hesitant. But apparently Commander Cas wasn’t in a listening mood. He shut up his second-in-command with a raised hand. Gabriel shrugged at Dean, as if to say, ‘I tried’.
Dean pointedly kept his back to Cas in the kitchen, taking longer than he needed to pick a drinking glass, letting Cas cross all the way across the room and start up the stairs before closing the cabinet. Cas would’ve kept going, but he heard Sam ask, “What the hell was that?” and couldn’t help himself. He paused partway up the steps, out of sight but not out of earshot.
Besides, ever since Kaia had received her acceptance, Claire had morphed into a literal jitterbug. She needed to see that Stanford wasn’t hostile territory. It was just a place full of people like her, merely a few hours away from her new home. “I think Claire is definitely feeling more optimistic about getting into the program.”
Directly across from Dean was a door, painted the same off-putting color as the walls and unlabeled. No signs pointed him in the right direction, and of course Moncrieff hadn’t bothered to tell him where to go any more than he’d bothered to learn the layout at any point before it became suddenly relevant. He looked both directions and only saw one other nondescript door to the left and corners that took the rest of both paths out of sight.
Cas gave Dean a small, close-lipped smile while rubbing his hand over the other repeatedly. “It’s a mixtape. Like the one you made me.”
Cas grimaced uncomfortably as he shifted his weight between his legs. “I understand now. When I was pulled from The Empty, my grace did not follow. I am human now.”
Dean looked at Sam sadly. He knew Sam missed Cas. He knew Jack did, too. Neither of them understood what Dean was going through, though. Dean barely understood it himself. “You don’t get it, Sam.”
ever feel the same for Castiel, though. Cas knew that. Why else would Dean kick him out of the bunker? Now that Cas didn’t have the ability to heal Dean and Sam or help them fight, Dean didn’t want him around. It made sense. Cas didn’t blame him.
“C’mon. It’ll be fun.” Dean reached out a hand. Cas took it, a shy smile appearing on his face. However, as soon as they made it out to the dance floor, a slower song began to play. Dean could tell it made Cas even more apprehensive, so he reached out and grabbed the angel by the hips, bringing them together. They began to sway back and forth softly, Cas taking the lead. Dean leaned over to rest his head on Cas’ shoulder.
Dean felt a smile stretch across his face. Tentatively, he reached across the space between them to rest his palm against Cas’ neck. Leaning in, he slowly pressed his mouth to Cas’ jawline, then his cheekbone, his eyelid, before finally capturing Cas’ lips with his own. Dean caught himself thinking that this was
Dean and Cas left her room first, continuing to avoid any mention of earlier. They settled back in the lobby at a small table, waiting for Iris to make her move.
By the time Cas caught up with him, Dean had already thrown his bag in the backseat of the Impala and had the key in the ignition. Once Cas was comfortable into the passenger seat, Dean pulled out of the garage and onto the road, an unfamiliar feeling settling over him as he snuck a glance at Cas.
Dean thought back to earlier that day, Castiel’s hand brushing across his hip. Cas noticed his reaction, that much was obvious now. They would have to prevent anyone from getting suspicious, and if this was the only way…
Dean came to in a grungy building that looked like an old warehouse. His vision was blurry, and he could feel the welt forming on his head from where he was hit. Dean was definitely going to have a concussion.
“Dean, you’re thinking too loud.” Dean chuckled. Cas knew him too well. Dean switched his focus to the feeling of Cas’ hand resting on his hip where his shirt had moved to expose a stretch of skin, the warmth from Cas’ fingers spreading to his own body through just that simple point of contact. He was eventually lulled to sleep by the sound of Cas’ breath in his ear.
The only tape player Dean still had was in the Impala, so he grabbed a jacket and shoved the tape into his pocket. He managed to avoid Sam on his way out, which meant that he avoided having to give a lame excuse for going to sit in his car for thirty minutes or so by himself. He opened the door to the Impala and slid onto the bench before pulling the tape out of his pocket and sliding it into the player. A twangy country beat immediately sounded from the speakers and Dean groaned. How was he going to get through a whole mixtape of
Dean grinned. “She’s alive, Iris. We just saw her. They took her to the hospital to run some tests, but she’s alive.”
on me. You know I’m bad at stuff like this… so just give me a minute.” Dean cleared his throat. “You told me that I changed you… well, you changed me too. I never had a best friend before you. Hell, I never had any friends at all. Sammy and I moved around so much that I never had a chance. I always thought attachments made you weak. But you… you showed me that it’s the opposite. You made me stronger. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me. You’re my best friend, Cas.  I don’t want anything to change between us if that’s not what you want, but I… I do want things to change. I love you. I’ve loved you for a long time and I just didn’t know what to do with those feelings. You’re worth it, though. I’ll start writing in a journal and reflecting and shit if that’s what it takes to show you how much you mean to me. I love you.”
About an hour after Cas left Dean’s room, Dean put down the papers he was looking through for a case to reach for the mixtape again. Dean knew why he made that Led Zeppelin mixtape for Cas, but he didn’t think Cas understood human customs like making a mixtape for someone. His feelings for Castiel had become… complicated, as of late. Dean was terrible at expressing himself, but he’s always been able to understand his feelings a little more through his favorite songs. He recently realized (embarrassingly enough) that he had developed quite a crush on the former angel. He knew that he would explode if he didn’t do something about it, but he didn’t want to ruin their friendship. Thus, ‘Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx’ was born.
Cas paused, eyebrows shooting up into his hairline, his sip of coffee still sitting in his mouth. He looked over to Dean slowly, who was frozen in his seat, staring in disbelief at his brother.
Even though Cas’ reaction was less than ideal, all Dean could think about was how much he wanted to do it again. He wanted Cas’ hands on him, he wanted to feel Cas’ skin on his, he wanted to kiss Cas anywhere the angel would let him. He wanted all of that with Cas. He wanted it to be real.
“I’ve got a case for you, if you’re interested,” Sam said through a mouthful of oatmeal. Dean never understood why his younger brother tortured himself with that health food garbage. Dean has eaten bacon almost every morning of his 40-something-year long life, and nothing bad has happened yet.
Sam tossed the idea around in his head before nodding. “Okay. We’ll try that first. But Cas, I’m serious. We’re running out of options here.”
Dean felt a tear slide down his cheek as he finished the prayer, hands clasped together and eyes squeezed tight in an attempt to make his effort feel more sincere. He’d never been one to pray, but he would try anything to get into contact with Castiel. Dean took a few deep breaths and slipped into a fitful sleep.
Dean pressed his hand against his mouth, as though he could take the words back and pretend he hadn’t said them aloud. Cas choked, turning his gaze from the sky to look at Dean quickly. “You
Dean lead Cas over to where the woman named Iris sat, face now pressed into her elbow on the table. Dean knocked on the table twice to get her attention.
Dean wrapped his arms around his chest as though he could protect himself from how vulnerable he felt. “I didn’t say anything. I, uh… we kissed. A bit.”
“I always wondered, ever since I took that burden, that curse. I wondered what it could be? What my true happiness could even look like. I never found an answer because the one thing I want… is something I know I can’t have. But I think I know now.” Cas looked at Dean. He was beautiful. “Happiness isn’t in the having, it’s in just being. It’s in just saying it.”
“I noticed there was a door that led to a hallway behind the front desk of the hotel. I wonder if we might find any more helpful information stored there,” Iris said.
“My,” Dean hesitated, “…family and I are staying at the Magnolia a few blocks away for the week. We were wondering if you had any information about the hotel, since it is a historical landmark. This guy is kind of a history geek.” Dean gestured to Cas, who gave Dean a glare in return. Dean shrugged in response.
Dean grimaced. Benny held up a finger to him, indicating that he should stop whining for a moment. He searched through his pockets and eventually presented Dean with a pocketknife. “I can use this to shave you. If you’d like.”
Jack looked up, considering his options carefully. He didn’t want to further upset Dean. “Dean, I want to remain hands-off in this new position. Chuck interfered too much with humanity. I want to change things and do this right. I’m sorry.”
Jerking his head in Cas’ direction, Dean realized that he hadn’t said a word in at least the last five minutes. “Yeah, I’m good. We should get settled and then head downstairs to ask around about what happened.”
Every night, Dean and Benny slept on the ground as close as possible to the fire, waiting until it inevitably fizzled out and they had to depend on their thin jackets to keep them warm. Dean learned to block out the noise of screeching and wailing that came from deep in the trees over time, allowing him to get a few hours of sleep after their light source disappeared for the day. He found comfort in praying to Cas. He had no idea if Cas was listening, but it made him feel safer as he laid there, everything surrounding him engulfed by the dark Purgatory sky, rocks pressing into his back.
Sam felt himself deflate. Of course. He should’ve been a little more sensitive to his brother’s feelings. Sam handed the jacket back to Dean. “We can use this to save him.”
Dean spread the blanket out on the hood, handed Cas a beer, and they got settled next to one another, laying back against the windshield. Dean could feel the warmth radiating off of Cas, and it took everything in him not to wrap his arms around his friend.
He heard a cough come from somewhere nearby and jerked his head in that direction. A gurney carrying a small body was making its way toward them.
The girl, uncomfortable, replied, “I’m sorry. All of our records that mention the Magnolia Hotel were taken by the owner a few years back after a horrible accident happened in one of the rooms. I don’t know much else about it.”
As they pulled into the empty lot, Cas’ face scrunched up in confusion. “What are we doing here, Dean?”
“Of course, Dean. Why wouldn’t I?” Cas was smiling at Dean now. Dean couldn’t help but smile back, lacing their fingers together.
Dean felt himself move toward Cas and wrap him in a hug. A grin stretched across his face, threatening to break him apart by the seams. They found each other. His thoughts became a repetitive cycle of telling himself that Cas is alive, Cas is safe, Cas is okay.
After they finished gathering as much information as possible from the witnesses in town that evening, Dean stopped to grab a couple of burgers at a drive-thru and then took them back to a local motel. The drive over was silent. Once they finally pulled into the parking lot, Dean put the Impala in park and looked over at Cas.
Dean flipped the mixtape over in his hands to read what Cas had written on it. Apparently Cas was getting a lot of use out of the rainbow pen set Sam bought him last week, because ‘CASTIEL’S TOP 13 TAYLOR TRAXX’ was spelled out in bright purple ink on the front of the tape. Dean smiled at Cas’ loopy handwriting before clearing his throat and asking, “Taylor?”
He thought back to the night they met in the barn, sparks literally flying as Cas short circuited every light within a five-mile radius. Dean was telling the truth earlier – he could feel Cas’ power coursing through the room, which was why he ended up stabbing the angel in the chest. He remembers the face Cas made at him as he looked down at Dean, pulling the knife out of his body like it was a slight inconvenience rather than a potentially life-threatening wound. Dean had felt a connection, a pull toward Cas that was unexplainable. It’s been that way since they met. Dean always wanted Cas near, he always wanted to tell Cas about his day, he wanted to be there whenever Cas needed him. Dean’s always been in love with him. It just took a fake relationship to make him realize.
“I read that thing Cas, it’s like gold on paper. Seriously, she’ll get her head blown off. You’re so good.”
He watched Angela closely. There was an underlying sadness behind her eyes. He could see the sympathy bubbling up.
“Hey there handsome.” She smirks and leans close to Cas to whisper in his ear even though we can all hear her anyway, “my shift ends at 6:30 if you wanna meet up.”
“Nah Cas, it’ll hurt you to sit down when you don’t need to. I’d rather just help you.” Dean reasons. “C’mon I’ll help you. Besides, it’s nothing I haven’t seen before.” He says with a smirk.
“Cas…” His sentence trails off when I remain facing the window. Being human really does ‘suck’. Now I understand why there so many drama television programmes. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-”
The hunter pulls on the tap of the bath before helping me pull my shirt over my head and moving me to the counter so I can hang on to it. “Cas. It’s completely up to you, but I’d advise you take your boxers off. You’ll feel cleaner. Plus, it’s a bubble bath, so you’ll be hidden anyway.”
He also half listens to Dean’s conversation with his brother while vaguely watching Jimmy from the corner of his eye.
“Yeah. Thanks Dean.” He gives a small smile before wandering off to the bathroom, all done just a minute later.
He woke up slowly, hugging Cas really close. It was warm where they were and he’d had the most amazing sleep. He’d looked at the clock before they went to sleep that night and they’d been at it for
with stupid empty promises. I guess I just stuck with it because I was striving for her to so much as look at me like she was proud but…she never did.
“Oh my god, you are!” I smile, tickling him again and he giggles loudly. He squirms around as I continue to tickle him, moving my hand back to his side.
“I’ll get you some cold and flu tablets.” Dean said, placing his hand on top of Cas’ head, and the touch lingered before Dean smiled kindly as he left the room.
“So, shall we set off tomorrow, then? I think Jody’s house is about 6 or 7 hours out.” I ask, briefly wondering whether we should give Cas some more time.
I smile again fondly and take Cas’ stuff to our room before going back and joining everyone on the couches.
“Watch your mouth, Winchester.” He growls. Dean has another nickname ready but again, decides against it. If he gets kicked out of this place,
“It’s been way too long! I’ve had no one to help me bake cookies or do jigsaws!” Alfie leans back, ruffling Jimmy’s hair. “Oh man, you’re so big now! How did you grow so much!”
save some for when Cas got home and he admits that he lied to Cas when he said he ate it all. “Couldn’t forget you, could I.”
“Alright.” I step back and pick the needle back up, trying not to think about the fact that Cas is lying down on my bed with his pants half way down his legs. I’m too tired to even consider anything about it right now thankfully.
Cas nods, breathing an ‘okay’. He’s a little nervous - he doesn’t want to experience that kind of pain for a second time. It serves him right though - he should have made sure he fell asleep on his back like usual, but he didn’t.
“Ok, so that’s Alfie.” Dean confirms. Cas had to show him pictures of everyone so he’d remember their names.
“Gabe, you knew I’d smell it from a mile off even if I’m asleep. You set Dean up.” He sighs with a sleepy smile, walking over to the food.
“A-and animals.” Jimmy adds, still cuddled up close to Cas. He wraps his arm across the boy’s waist to make him feel a little more comfortable and secure.
The angel steps back and looks at me in disbelief, “dad doesn’t care, Castiel. He never did! Everyone else saw that, but not you, Castiel. He hates all of us which is why he created those earth mites. He hates me, he hates you, he hated Gabriel, he hated Uriel, Michael, Zachariah, even Hannah, shall I keep going? He’s ditched all of us for Amara-“
“Yeah, of course. You are, and it’s a good thing, Cas. It’s good that you’re doing all of it to save people, but there’s a part of you that wants it over, isn’t there? A little voice in your head telling you that you’re done. You can’t go on anymore.”
“As long as I can carry on with the pie, I’m happy.” I decide, shoving yesterday’s shirt into my duffel bag.
Cas hears someone coming down the stairs and turns around to see Dean open the door to the living room, looking at him in question.
“Yeah. He was actually still on the phone to one of the people when I got there, but he dropped it when I came in and ran over to me, just…literally just beside himself crying and crying. He was scared to death.”
Little did I know that Cas was watching me glance him up and down, the expression on his face one of curiosity.
“You’re hogging them all, you dickhead.” Dean scrambles to steal some more from the coin pot in Cas’ hand.
Despite what we’re doing, it’s a relatively calm atmosphere. All you can hear is our moans, grunts, sliding of lips and our ragged breathing which makes it all the more hot.
Dean looks down at the weird plush dragonfly. “I guess it does look kinda freaky. It’s the eyes. They’re too...open.”
Luckily this doesn’t seem to go on for much longer, and the time between each retch widens until Cas feels he’s done. He goes pretty limp afterwards, putting a lot of weight on Dean’s arm which is still on his back.
“Definitely. I think that’s why him and Jimmy were happy playing together. They kept to themselves and were nice and quiet.” Cas laughs before he starts brushing his teeth. Dean fills the gap in the conversation while Cas has his mouth full of toothbrush.
The metal is shaped into a beautiful, simple yet complex shape, and it has the letter ‘D’ engraved on it in a fancy font.
“Yeah. Maybe not for a day or two but he will at some point and everything will be okay again.” He manages to finally make eye contact, seeing Jimmy’s reddened face. “It’s all going to be okay.” He rubs the boy’s back slowly, the comfort quietening the sniffling. Dean wipes the tears from Jimmy’s cheeks away with his thumb, smiling sadly. “You wanna talk about it?” He wonders, referring to Jimmy having to be alone and getting scared.
“Are you coming to the diner tonight?” She wonders. Cas studies her face and realises that she can see that he looks exhausted. Of course she does, she’s his mom. She can probably tell he’s sick with the stupid fever too.
“Yeah, a cat.” Cas smiles and gives a nod of confirmation. Jimmy’s eyes start to fill with tears. “Oh, sweetheart.” He pulls the boy into a hug. “Don’t cry!” Cas says cheerfully.
With the painkillers in his system, Cas is able to reach down and lift Jimmy up to rest against him, holding him close. “Thank you for apologizing. I’m sorry too; for shouting at you.”
Once he is gone, I turn to Sam, “he needs flirting training” and we laugh a lot before eating the rest of our food.
“I’m done so I’ll go check on the termites.” Gabe decides as he stands up. His chair scrapes across the wooden floor and Anna rolls her eyes.
I kiss his hair before glancing at my watch. We still have another 35 minutes or so. That should give enough time for a quick power up for me too I guess.
Happy that I brought an extra blanket, I wrap the thick material around the both of us to protect us from the cold October air.
Dean takes a few moments to absorb the information, turning it over in his head. Surely what happened to Cas has an official name? Is it a PTSD episode or just a panic attack? Cas saw the stairs and remembered what happened when he got hurt. Anna will probably know.
I do the same and we watch the screen as Jason Statham speeds across a tonne of police officers and drives off a bridge in his car.
I breathe in deeply, “Honestly, I’m not sure how much longer I can do this. Living in the store at least means I’m always ready to open it up in the morning, and I enjoy it, it’s just
I hand the pot to the doc, “Well, that’s great, we’re all done here. Eddie, I can’t see anything wrong with your tissue or anything else for that matter. Mr Winchester, you mentioned on the phone before that you’re just passing through this area. That’s fine, if we find any problems that need addressing in the sample, we can get in touch through one of our other branches to set you up with some medication. It should take around a week for the results to come through and we have your mobile number so we’ll be in touch.”
It’s pretty snug, but it’s very comfortable. As soon as Dean is laid down, Cas snuggles up into his chest and tangles their legs together. Dean feels Cas bunch up the front of his sweater and press his face into the material. Dean’s hand finds its way into Cas’ hair and he presses in close, able to kiss the top of Cas’ head.
“Dude, we’ll become mush!” Sam added. He turned to Dean, “You know what happened to the last humans who went into hyperdrive?”
If Cas had zoned to the aesthecosm, he really would’ve been able to see Dean’s soul; at least, that was the prevailing belief. When sentinels and guides dropped into the aesthecosm, their bodies stayed in reality—so the metaphysical projections that appeared, that they could use to find each other, those had to be something else. Dean didn’t know if he believed it. After going in after Sam, he’d tried to think about the aesthecosm as little as possible.
All movement in the room stilled, even Ash stopping with an uncharacteristically quiet curse as he figured out where Dean was going.
From the way she stressed it, clearly it was something that was supposed to have a deeper meaning that Jimmy would’ve known. Cas didn’t. He let his unease out as a short laugh and said, hoping it wasn’t an abnormal response, “Yeah, sounds like it.”
“You know what would really suck?” Jack said. He was perched on the makeup counter, gangly legs swinging. “If you spilled wine on that white dress.”
The sun winked at him through a canopy of trees as he slowed to a stop on Castiel’s street. Dean turned off the engine and climbed out of the car. Stared at the crate of plants in the backseat as they stared back silently. Judgmentally.
The man didn’t stop—of course he didn’t—but Dean was nearly on top of him, only a house and a half away from where they’d started. He shifted his shoulders, just about ready to launch into a tackle, when something dropped down in front of the man and he stopped so suddenly that Dean crashed into him after all—just in a much less controlled manner than he’d intended. Swearing and grabbing the man, both as a counterbalance and to stop him from doing anything while Dean was off-balance, Dean barely managed to keep himself from tumbling to the pavement.
It felt like hitting metal—and maybe it was, beneath the layers of skin and augmented muscle fiber. He didn’t know how much of Cas’s skeleton had been reinforced or even replaced, but it was solid enough that Dean’s fist connecting with the side of his face only snapped his head to the side, and even that was brief. He recovered his posture before Dean, who was left cradling fingers that might have been broken, feeling like three kinds of idiot and no less angry for it.
“Now,” Dean turned to the kids, packed into the middle between two pairs of adults. “I know it sounds super-cool, and let’s be honest, it is. But hyperdrive is not a walk in the park. At all times, stay in your seats, hold on and don’t panic. If there’s something wrong, you tell us, over the earpieces. Immediately,” he levelled a look at Cas on that last word. Man had the guts to scowl.
“Good,” Sam responded, slowly. There was a soft clink in the background. Probably a steaming cup of organic, fair-trade, no-leaves-were-harmed-in-the-making-of-this herbal tea. Sam had always been into that hippy-dippy yoga crap. “And, how are you?”
. His eyes were closed, head thrown back in ecstasy. Dean leaned down and laid gentle kisses on every inch of skin he could reach. Cas sighed happily.
That just makes Meg laugh harder. “This old bastard, docile? Not a day in his life, even when he’s got a whole herd to stud.”
“Are you—you’re not joking. Fuck, no wonder you’re a mess.” Cas scowled somehow still harder and tried to interrupt, but Dean pushed right on and didn’t let him. “You know that’s not normal, right? Not healthy. I mean, shit, they should be at normal levels more often than they’re dialed up—like, a lot more. Sentinels who don’t shut down go crazy and then they die. That’s—that’s basic shit. They die, Cas, every time.”
Then Dean led him outside and into the vineyard. Cas hadn’t really gotten a good look at the land around the house the day before; it was beautiful. Rolling hills covered in vines, bright sky and sunlight, it was like nothing he’d ever seen. Struck, he stopped and stared for long enough that Dean noticed he was no longer behind him and turned, catching him staring.
And what the fuck that was supposed to mean, Dean had no clue. Except that it probably wasn’t any of the things his mind immediately went to. Because if that hadn’t been Novak at his best—well. Fuck. That was going on Dean’s list of things not to think about.
Looking from Novak to the table and back, Dean raised his own eyebrows but said nothing. They both knew who he’d meant. Novak could probably make some guesses about Dean based on that, and they’d even probably be true, but that didn’t for a second mean that Dean was going to open his mouth and confirm them. Saying nothing at all was best, according to the man himself. Dean could manage saying nothing.
The frown didn’t drop off Cas’s face, but it did stretch into something condescending that set Dean’s teeth even more on edge. “Of course I’m not joking. My senses don’t need to be shut down—that would be inefficient, particularly for field work. I could miss something vital just because I didn’t know to be paying close attention. Regardless, this is how I have operated since childhood and I don’t intend to change that just because you don’t think it ought to be possible.
It was going to take some getting used to. Back in Kansas, leaving the building out of uniform without at least a ballistic vest was asking to get shot, tranqed, or hit with a homing knife. Helmets were as good as mandatory for the same reason. Anyone who didn’t live in the barracks—and most people did, including Dean—stayed suited up until the armor-plated convoy carried them into the secret tunnels from which they could emerge unnoticed.
he hadn’t been alone in whatever he had been feeling. Emphasis on the past tense. Because in that moment, he couldn’t imagine even liking the smug, dictatorial bastard. (Let alone
“Gabriel is literally our uncle,” she’d chided. “What about the others? Maybe not Balthazar, because he’d probably try and hire a stripper for me. And definitely not Anna, that bitch. But what about the brothers? Sam and Dean? Be nice to see them in real time.”
“Hey, Benny! We’re having some problems with the oven again, and in the middle of my dinner party. My boss is even there, you know, Mr. Adler? It’s so embarrassing.”
,” Dean muttered. Mistakes had been made and he had no desire to pull the memories from the pit of repression.
He knew all about rich, connected kids who got every opportunity, every chance; he knew even more about kids who didn’t.
Dean grinned, somewhat awkwardly since he didn’t know which direction to do it in and settled for straight ahead. “Sorry for doubting you.”
But he at least almost believed it, and that was enough to plant twin seeds of sorrow and worry in his chest as he wondered what he would’ve seen if he’d found Cas there. His own appearance hadn’t been on his mind either of the times he’d visited the aesthecosm, but Sam had looked more or less like himself as far as Dean remembered.
“I’m here for you, Cas,” he repeated. Then, to try and ease away from the fragility of the moment, he asked, “You can feel things here too?”
“It’s been seventeen years.” He was crying, too, but he couldn’t look away from her even to wipe away his tears. “Why didn’t you ever try? You could’ve talked to Dad, talked to me. I could’ve talked to Jimmy.”
!” his voice rose into a breathy gasp, body arching up against Dean’s, eyes screwed up, head thrown back in ecstasy.
The ugly snort that pushed its way through Dean’s nose echoed around them. “Yeah,” he said dryly, “I got that. But I’ll pick up on all this shit a lot quicker if you let me actually get involved, and it’s not like I can fuck anything up if you just let me listen in with you. I can be helpful. I’m a good fucking cop, even if I don’t know who Senior’s screwing this week.”
Casting a furtive look about, he snuck up to the little keyhole. Not that that would help much. He was self-aware enough to realize that the moment he lowered his guard, he’d be caught. And it was difficult not to lower his guard when he saw the enormous stack of files inside the panel in the wall.
Dean’s gaze had flicked between the perfectly detailed lavender asters adorning the front of the lousy excuse for a sweater, and the wide blue eyes peering at him from behind what he
Cas, who’d finished off another one almost simultaneously, let loose a shot. The space before the girls swirled, sinking to the ground. Sam grunted, basically bludgeoning his hound to death.
In the silence that followed, Dean chewed his lip. He looked at Novak again, wondering if he’d picked up on the same thing, but the man didn’t look like he was going to speak up anytime soon. He just kept frowning at the speaker like he could make it give them something more, doll furniture apparently forgotten in his hand.
“I’ve never met a Jimmy here. Which is actually pretty odd, if you think about it, given how common a name it is. Maybe he’s a regular who usually attends a different session? He must look a lot like you for so many people to be mistaking you for him.” Balthazar looked him up and down, then smirked the kind of smirk that told Cas his friend was about to be an asshole. “I sure hope he’s cuter, though. For his sake.”
Shaky, but nowhere near as unsteady as his child-avatar had been, Cas nodded. Dean pressed one last steadying kiss to his lips, then they disconnected together.
Realizing he was just standing in the middle of the room on his phone with the lights on, which probably counted as weird, Cas got into bed. He got out of bed, because Jimmy’s room didn’t have a light switch right next to the pillow like his did, just the one at the door. Fortunately, though, it had enough ambient light from the large windows—and even a skylight—that he could make it back to the mattress without bumping into any unfamiliar furniture.
No one had an answer for him right away; the only sound in the room came from Cas thrashing on top of the blankets. Then he made a noise, small and heartbreaking, a whimper of pain or fear.
As the counselor wandered off, looking pleased with himself for a job well done, Cas found Jimmy looking at him with a confused frown.
But that wasn’t Claire. Jack stood at the mouth of the cell, eyes wide as he stared at his father’s bloodied form. Traumatizing as it probably was, it was effective. Cas was off the floor in a heartbeat.
“Delta, your Comms status is online,” the in-craft AI called, voice curling around the traces of an Irish accent. So, Gabriel’s tech wizardꟷ some kid fresh outta high schoolꟷ had not been kidding about being a Marvel guy.
Rowena sounded thoroughly bored as she pushed away from her perch. Like she’d been waiting for the plebs to catch up and now that they had, she just wanted to
“Stepmom,” Cas repeated, shell-shocked despite having thought he had no more capacity to be struck by any new revelation. He recognized the way Jimmy tensed, bracing for a fight to defend his mom’s honor, but it wasn’t going to come; his reaction had nothing to do with that. “Mom got married?”
He let out a snort at that, “You’re serious about this? Gimme one good reason, buddy.” So, no apology, no preamble. Jumping right into it.
It wasn’t just his patience and confidence in showing Cas what to do and believing him capable of doing it on his own. He kept up a steady stream of conversation even when they were working rows apart, asking more questions about camp, checking that Cas was doing okay, talking about the other things that needed to be done around the vineyard over the next weeks. Despite it sounding like an incredible amount of work, it really was just conversational. He wasn’t trying to guilt help out of his stepbrother—though if any of it happened while Cas was still around instead of Jimmy, he knew he would want to be involved. So he asked a lot of questions and Dean seemed even happier with how much interest he was showing.
A bit of separation was probably good for them, anyway, and if Cas got himself messed up it would only serve him right. Dean had less reason than ever to stick his neck out for the guy. He refused to allow the tendril of guilt that tried to worm its way between his ribs as he shouldered Cas aside. Knowing it only happened because Cas, made of steel and titanium and chrome and plastimetal and righteous asshole, allowed it to happen—moved out of the way in order to avoid letting Dean touch him, it seemed—worsened both the anger and the pull on his conscience. But those canceled each other out well enough to both be ignored.
There was a little spark in those blue eyes. A little motionlessness that indicated Cas was in deep thought.
The whole exchange gave Dean a lot to think about; Lafitte and Novak returning to their respective hobbies gave him the time and quiet he needed to muse over what it all meant. It didn’t drastically change anything he’d already noted about the team dynamics, but it was more insight than he’d had before. Novak especially. He’d pegged the guy as kind of a weirdo from the start, because a grown man obsessed with dollhouse furniture couldn’t be anything but a weirdo. His investment in the wiretaps everyone else wrote off added to that impression. But aside from that, he’d been hard to get a feel for on a personal level; everything he talked about was work.
When he went to put his bags in the back of the car, his mom stopped him from opening the door further than a few inches and gave him a strange look. “You might be running on camp standards of hygiene, but nothing that goes on those seats is coming into my house. Come on, I’ll get the trunk.”
Cas was setting down his backpack on the couch. “Just leave it here. It’s just some plants . . .” he turned back to Bobby. “Would you mind watering them for me? They don’t need much attention.”
Cas ignored him; he should’ve known better than to expect anything else. At least he was too run down to take another swing.
Without missing a beat, Rowena instructed, “Earthlings, you three go in this way. The Queen and I shall take the other way.”
It took all Dean’s concentration to keep that scene from taking up all his concentration. He was only stealing enough glances to keep it believable, or trying to at least, but he knew he gave away too much of his hidden hunger every time he did. There was nothing he could do about that, didn’t know how to stop it even when he caught Novak looking at him with the same subtle consideration he was giving the rest of the men. And fuck it, he was just playing the role Novak had required of him, right? Even if Novak could tell it was more than just acting, he’d never be able to prove it.
He still didn’t like it, but at least with Novak a little further away from him, he could concentrate on really playing up the camp. It was so far from who he was, even from any of the parts of him he sometimes had to suppress, that it turned out to be pretty easy once he put his mind to it; keeping up the act felt like a release of tension, one less thing to worry about. Whether he could keep it up under pressure remained to be seen: tempers ran in the family. But when he had Novak to play off of and Junior in what seemed to be a good mood, it flowed out as easily as any other bullshit he’d had to come up with in his life.
Dean was unobtrusively folded into his seat in the control room, fingers sifting through a well-loved copy of Slaughterhouse Five. Inappropriate? Perhaps. Given what they’d just seen . . .
After the third time he slipped off the words, he snapped the book shut with a resigned sigh. Made his way into his pod, standing by the window trying to decide whether he wanted a shower or a nap. He’d made no move in either direction, watching the dim stars stare back at him, unmoving and constant. Somehow judgmental.
“What?” he whispered, shivering. He pulled the comforter up to cover them both and immediately hated himself for it because, yes, Cas looked adorable all tucked in, but that little freckle over his nipple had disappeared. “Cas . . . I’m getting the feeling you’re overthinking again.”
He wasn’t really expecting anything to come of it; Cas had refused every one of Dean’s offers to put his guide abilities to use, and he didn’t see why it would change for something so insignificant. Then again, he realized when Cas considered it instead of grumpily dismissing the suggestion like he usually did, maybe that was why: it wasn’t something that mattered. It wasn’t something that Cas needed from him—not that Cas would ever admit to needing anything, the stubborn asshole.
Despite Balthazar’s cheerful company, the beautiful day around them, and the weeks of new experiences awaiting him, Cas felt a certain melancholy slipping over him and threatening to slide further down into resentment. His summers at that age had been spent either at home while his dad worked on a book or at his elderly neighbor’s house while his dad worked on a book. It wasn’t a terrible childhood, but he did feel like he’d lost out on some things.
The two arguing were too caught up in it to notice the new arrivals, but another man and woman sitting at the table looked up as Dean and the other man approached. She scrutinized him with narrow eyes that were almost as piercing and as unreadable as the implants; he smiled and nodded briefly, then set down the tablet in his hand and stood. His movement stopped the debate and suddenly Dean had all four people staring at him, but he didn’t get a chance to feel awkward about it before the man walked over with his hand outstretched.
The bus ride was close to four hours, most of which Cas spent either watching the scenery or reading. He’d discovered a new series, six books in all, and had finished the first the night before. The second was starting off a little more shakily than the first, but he hoped it would sort itself out; he had the other four in his bag. He got some conversation out of Balthazar, but most of his questions about what to expect when they got to camp were waved away with a promise it would be more fun for him to wait and see. An hour into the trip, his friend started working his way up the rows to get closer to Bela. Another hour after that, he slumped back into his seat and put his headphones in to sulk to music so loud Cas could could hear the operatic anger spilling out.
Dean followed the sound of chatter slowly, finding his way to the mess hall with a lot of aid from the walls. The kids sat at the table, Cas hovering nearby with a thermos.
Between what Jimmy had said about Dean and watching him interact with Sam, Cas had expected much more of an older brother stereotype: over-the-top teasing, know-it-all arrogance, other obnoxious flaws often played up in movie and television portrayals of sibling relationships. And maybe that was how he was most of the time; Jimmy had years of background on Dean’s behavior and Cas only a few hours, so he didn’t want to discount his twin’s experience. But since their breakfast conversation, Dean had just been personable and engaging.
That wasn’t going to happen again. He had to know he could trust Castiel to remember they were both on the line, or if it happened again he’d have to run. And if that burned Castiel, he’d only have himself to blame.
He’d tried, okay? It’s just that the hand holding had seemed to barrel Cas even further towards waterworks, so he’d started poking.
Cesar sent Cas another quelling look, but Cas didn’t even notice. His eyes, which certainly looked like they could be capable of killing a man if he wanted them to, were too busy glaring at Dean.
Teeth clenching, Dean turned to start arguing into the phone, but Cas laid a hand on his shoulder. It was over Dean’s shirt and jacket, but still the first friendly contact they’d had; it went a lot further to making him accept the situation, helped along by Cas repeating, only loud enough for Dean’s ears, “I really am fine, Dean. But I appreciate your concern and I’ll tell you if anything starts to feel wrong, okay?”
For the first time since he got into the car with their mom, he wondered how Jimmy was doing in his place. What he thought of their dad and how much of an awkward recluse he was. What he thought of Cas’s life and how it compared to his own.
“You’re my dream disaster and I wouldn’t trade you for anything or anyone,” Cas said, “but this does require a lot of discussion that’s not going to just be about your insecurities.”
“Jody’s awesome. And badass. And kinda scary. And also a total nerd, yes. But nerds are hot now, so don’t worry.”
“Um . . .” Sam muttered. “I’m gonna be in the map room. With Charlie and Rowena. Yeah.” There was a shuffling noise. “Yeah, I’m gonna be in the map room,
His leg jiggled as he texted Benny, perching onto the hood of a random, dusty car. The only response was a thumbs up emoji. He huffed in amusement, tossed the phone onto the hood beside him, and laid back against the windshield, uncaring of the filth. In a cruel facsimile of the Winchester picnic traditions of yore.
“Me?” Dean twisted to stare at him incredulously and had to clench his fingers to keep them on the wheel instead of following through on the impulse to do something physical and unpleasant to his partner. They couldn’t both give in to self-destructive urges on the same case, on the same day. In fact, he’d like it if neither of them did. “You have tech in your head that has never before failed to cause fatal brain damage and you think it’s my fault you have a headache after using it.”
The kid was in a bad way, but not in a total zone yet. She was in the barrack’s garage, where it looked like they had dragged her out of the car after retrieval but hadn’t been willing or able to pull her any farther. Probably couldn’t without risking her hurting herself or one of them, if the way she was shaking and staring at her hands was anything to go by; she was close to snapping. She didn’t even seem to notice that they’d turned a hose on her to blast the blood from her hands and arms, but Dean knew it wouldn’t be enough to break her out of it. It definitely wouldn’t get enough of the smell off to stop it from affecting her if she was focused in on that sense.
After lunch, he went back up to Jimmy’s room to ’nap’ and shared his conclusion. Jimmy agreed, but only to a point.
They didn’t have a headcount, but the cell could only hold so many hounds. If two were dancing with Dean, one each with Sam and Cas, then . . .
Cas groans to cover his laugh, but the crinkles at the corners of Dean’s eyes tell him that some of it got out anyway. “Does that line work for you often?”
“Tell me if it gets to be too much. I’ll stop as soon as you tell me to.” Dean tried to put as much reassurance in his voice as he could while desperately shoving down thoughts about what it sounded like. How he was pretty sure his visibly embarrassed partner had all but confessed to being a virgin and Dean was all but feeding him a line for his first time.
how expensive knitting was, he wouldn’t have tried to burn the Godawful Yellow Monstrosity. (He refused to call it a ‘sweater’. That thing was like a chastity device invented by an Amish mom.)
Dean could tell that Cas was hurting again, scowling through his food and wincing at his water, but he still refused to admit it. If that was how hard the guy pushed himself every time, it was no fucking wonder he’d been dropping into partial zones. No amount of augmenting could stop that, and neither could a guide. There were limits to what a body could take, even one as tampered with as Cas’s. In fact, Dean wasn’t sure that all the mods weren’t adding more to his stress instead of alleviating it. Cas was a mess, a man-made disaster, and too proud or misguided to see how close he was to falling apart. Even though he’d told himself he would, Dean couldn’t just sit by and watch it happen. It reminded him too much of Sam and his past, irredeemable failure.
“Like that ever stops you,” Jack snorted next to her, jerking back to his milkshake at the vitriolic look his sister shot him.
Dean’s mouth dropped open as fingers started to knead his flesh; warming him up, displaying ownership, delaying the inevitable. Whatever Novak’s goal was, the result he was getting was Dean’s dick noticing that there were fingers poking around in the general area where he really liked having fingers. “Thank you, sir,” he forced out, trying to keep it from sounding as shaky as he felt but not sure he succeeded.
“I’m serious. I just, I need to get over it and everything will get back to normal, but you can’t tell Mom or Jody.”
He smiled, feeling shy about it himself, and said, “Thank you. I think a stack of pancakes that large may be able to keep themselves warm for years without any outside intervention, but I still appreciate the thoughtfulness. Should I be worried about Sam?”
“Okay,” Cas responded in the brittle stillness. Then, “Crew, thank you for accompanying me for this mission,” he cleared his throat softly. Dean refused to open his eyes, determined to maintain his stand. “In case . . . well. None of you had to do this, and I need you to know how dearly I appreciate it.”
Haloed by the bright Californian summer morning sunshine, sitting at the kitchen table with a bowl of cereal and a printed spreadsheet on the table in front of him, Dean was not in fact any less beautiful than Cas had made him out to be. Especially when he looked up, saw Cas, and broke open another unfairly charming smile.
Cas pulled a face. Rowena answered for him, “And worse.” She tapped him on the arm, “If you ever need a source for that work of yours, Commander . . .”
Eyebrows raised, Dean looked a question at Louisiana, but he just shook his head and flipped another card from the deck. Not the ‘he’ in question. Dean blinked down at the desk again.
No one had decided to inform him that they weren’t travelling via Oziome. Because his “injuries” were too “serious” to be “left untreated” for “too long”. He was quoting that. Which meant no poppy air. And also that Charlie wasn’t getting safely delivered to her people. Obviously, the latter took precedent. Obviously.
Novak had already wanted him gone, and Dean just gave him all the ammunition he’d ever need, with the ruined underwear to prove it.
It’s a slow unwinding for both of them. Cautious, gentle, finding each other past too many years of defenses. Cas lets go easy and sweet, falls apart under his care until all he can say is, “Dean, Dean, Dean.”
Castiel frowned, looked around, and frowned more. “You get to a safe phone and make the call. I’ll keep them in custody and start collecting evidence.”
“Of course, she’s expecting you. But your colleague isn’t cleared for access, so unfortunately we’ll need to ask you to exit the building, Agent—Williams, was it?”
It doesn’t matter, really, those nights when he can’t stop the knowledge that Cas’s heart will one day stop beating from overwhelming him. Because this is what Cas wants: humanity, pain, hunger, falling asleep with their bodies pressed together and waking up even closer.
“What happened there?” Charlie asked as Billie swerved them around a pile of rubble. Hazy gray sky showed through a corresponding chunk missing from the wall above it.
He stumbled out of the pod unsteadily, making straight for the beverage cabinet where Charlie had stocked some of the finest liquor found on Oziome.
“Ha! I knew I liked you. Good thinking, Jimmy, good thinking. But can Dean come, too? What is it you do, sweetie?”
Dean felt his ears heat up, admonishing himself for thinking that it meant anything. He chewed rapidly, repeating to himself that he
“I heard nothing. Jimmy, your stuff’s on the stairs. Make sure it gets to your room before I get up, because if I break my neck tripping over it my ghost will shave your eyebrows every night. Actually, let’s call it every third night. Just enough for it to start growing out and getting itchy before I do it again.”
Dean took a breath to steel his nerves, relishing the smell of Earth one last time. Because who the fuck knew how long this would take.
For all his resolve to keep doing his job and doing it well, the whole point of Adler kicking him downstairs was that he didn’t think Dean could do it from there. And the shittiest part was that he might’ve been right. As far as Dean knew, despite Moncrieff‘s dramatic parting shot, no suicides had come out of the wiretap room since its creation. Neither had any arrests. But as far as he knew didn’t go too far, because he’d never bothered to learn anything about that unit.
“Why don’t you tell the good Commander that?” Dean muttered. Because he’d made the first move. Unsuccessfully, but this lack of communication was not all his fault. Though really, he should’ve known better than to expect simplicity with Castiel. Man waffled between hot and cold like mercury in a thermometer.
That hadn’t been in the briefing, but it should have been; that added a whole new level of political bullshit. Ash had predicted governments would be interested in Kevin’s stuff, but if governments were already involved it raised the stakes significantly.
A hand reached out and rested at the crook of his neck. It tugged, and Dean leaned ahead. He’d been expecting a hug. It wasn’t a hug.
“I think it’s absurd that you’re so focused on a single error that hasn’t reoccurred outside of that brief window. You worry about my performance in the field, but you’d put your trust—expect me to put my trust,” he stressed, turning the argument back to Cesar, “in a person who was dragged up from the middle of the Dust Bowl not because he’s a skilled asset to the team, but because Command thinks I need a paraesthetically predisposed babysitter.”
Dean was pretty good at reading people. Guides were exceptionally empathetic to begin with, and he had years of police experience to perfect it. The whole team had known about him except for Cas and it had been Cesar’s call to keep him in the dark. Which meant he knew Cas would have a problem with it and Cas’s problem mattered, which meant Cas was the sentinel they wanted to pair him with. And Cas hadn’t known he was getting—and clearly didn’t want—a guide partner.
He jumped, setting off fresh bouts of laughter, and turned to see a third man who’d made it within a foot of him without Dean hearing or feeling his approach. He had dark hair that looked like it had just rolled out of bed and didn’t so much as blink his piercingly blue eyes at Dean’s reaction.
They’re in the middle of wrestling for control, trying to distract each other by well-timed strokes and bites and kisses and at one notable point, a slap, when there’s a soft knock.
