"We understand that he is a serious threat to Sherlock and Holmes's..." The Doctor began, but was quickly cut off by John.
It was obvious that you weren't in the mood to talk, Sherlock, but I didn't want to stop the conversation, I needed to know where your head was at.
‘Oh my poor, Sherlock!’ She uttered. She moved to hug you, but you weren’t very responsive. You didn’t remove her either, and I was happy that you didn’t. She loved you like you were her own son.
I told her that Kylie was in the room, asleep. Molly seemed disappointed at that. But then I told her that she should be waking soon, but we wouldn't be here for that. You watched as I told her where all her stuff was, when to feed her, when to put her to sleep. It made me feel...I don't know how to say it, proud. Being a parent, it gives me a sense of pride, Sherlock. I love it. And I love Kylie.
“Are you referring to me or the baby?” Sherlock deadpanned. John snorted. “Obviously the one who’s in pain, Sherlock.”
He looked to his right again and Sherlock was staring at him with the same eyes he gave him this morning.
"This is a time-machine, you use it to go to different periods in time, bad things can also happen because it's a time-machine and it messes with time. Relax, John, I won't let anything happen to you or Sherlock, however, I can't promise that bad things won't happen."
John didn’t realize he said that out loud, but now he was embarrassed and he needed a diversion. “Do you want some tea? I’ve been wanting some for a while now.”
John gave a loud groan. He wasn’t sure how Watson was going to react to the news. But something tells him that he would’ve found out anyway, chances are Sherlock blabbed already to Holmes. Hopefully Holmes reacted well to the news.
‘Sluggish behavior, mood swings, dull pains here and there, mainly in my abdomen, and then, just a few days ago, loss of appetite.’ You listed as if you were reciting some sort of list.
Sherlock remained silent, biting his cheek to prevent any smart remark from leaving his mouth. He hated feeling helpless, more so when John was in the vicinity. He could only imagine how Holmes was feeling. He shot a quick look and saw Holmes's eyes fixated on Watson, who was too preoccupied at the moment to acknowledge his staring. Sherlock knew, he loved Watson just the same, and inside of him, there was a mixture of anger, passion, determination, and of frustration for not being able to help Watson, and to think that Moriarty was getting off on this, sick, vile man.
In unison, the men sang, “And I love you so and I want you to know that I’ll always be right here, and I love to sing sweet songs to you because you are so dear…”
John felt like an arse. Of course, she would think that, why wouldn't she? Why would she think that she was loved unconditionally from a father who only smiled when he talked about his dead husband? The guilt came at him full force, he stumbled a bit while he walked with her. He had to tell her, she had to know that he did love her, but he'll never get over Sherlock. She had to know that. He stopped in his tracks and knelt down. He positioned Kylie to face him and he waited to make sure that he had her attention.
“We’re just not sure where you fit into the picture. And by that, I mean, disappearing for days on end fighting in the inquisition or watching Marie Antoinette get decapitated, or meeting a real life alien.”
“Come now, we must be off, my brother is going to have a heart-attack if we don’t get there soon. You should come too Doctor, it would be nice to have you there.”
“And this hair. John your hair so perfect to me! So, blond and shiny. You usually wear it like you’re still in the army, but can I tell you now that I really, really love what you’ve done with it recently. You look so handsome, I wish you’d believe me when I tell you.”
John waited patiently for Sherlock to look him in the eyes and smile. Sherlock whispered, “I love you too, John.”
He kissed him again. He peppered little kisses all over Sherlock’s body and gently laid him on the bed. He liked it when Sherlock moaned. He was doing it right. John’s strong hands grasped Sherlock’s thighs and he slowly wrapped them around his waist. He started to unbutton his shirt and Sherlock stopped him.
Molly wipes away the tears that are drying on her face. She glances over at the little girl who looks like she's having the time of her life. She smiles to herself. John looks on with a blank stare. Why did he agree to come out with her? He knew that this was going to end up being about Sherlock. She loved him, and they hadn't talked for so long.
“I am happy to know that I am not the only one who has witnessed the statue’s apparent movement.” Watson sighed.
“Are you sure? Last night he looked ecstatic to be going to Angelo’s. Maybe he’s only waiting for you to ask him properly. Do you agree?”
John’s mouth hung open. Of course, how could he forget? Where is Sherlock going to be staying during this? He can’t possibly sleep in his bedroom when the flat was in this condition. Did no one think to ask him, or did everybody assume that he knew what to do?
Holmes had the ghost of a smile on his face. They could be with each other; they wouldn’t have to worry about being sentenced to life in prison, or even death. They were free to do as they pleased. Sherlock seemed oblivious to Holmes’s face.
“Because I now find myself in your company, my dear companion, you provide the necessary tranquility that my brain craves.”
That day ended with him leaving with Kylie, who couldn't stop smiling even if she tried. This day is going to end with John getting shitfaced while Greg watches. Kylie was at home with...who was it? Was it Molly, or was it, Mrs. Hudson? Good, this is good, he can't think straight. Maybe the world won't seem so lonely now. Where was Sherlock? When's the last time he's seen him? God, he misses him. Greg slowly moves his drink to his mouth, all without taking his eyes off of John. He invited him out a day after Molly did. John was already typing in his polite refusal, as well as an excuse about no one being available to watch Kylie. Then Greg sent him another text telling him that he would treat him to drinks. John erased his original message and replaced it with a "Sure" and then pressed send. Kylie watched some telly with him and they ended up falling asleep on his favorite armchair. Kylie's little body fit perfectly across John's chest and torso.
He wrote this reminder for himself. Some job he did remembering it. He ripped it off the fridge, he must’ve moved it there on one of his drunk nights. He fished through the kitchen drawers and got the Sharpie marker out of its hiding place. He popped off the cap and started to write on the note. He crossed out the original writing and began to write over it. He capped the marker again, and then put the note back up on the fridge.
You didn't respond, and I decided to leave you alone because you looked like you weren't in the mood. Before I left, I heard you talking.
He wants to be mad at her for interrupting his moment with Sherlock, but he can't bring himself to do it. She doesn't know what's going on, she's only doing what she thinks is right. She only wants to help. He takes the phone from her and pats her head.
She sent me a message saying that she drew none other than Sherlock Holmes, and she tried to pawn it off to other officers, but they all declined, so she was stuck with him. I was a little miffed at that and I asked her if there was a reason she was talking to me. She needed help getting him a present. I groaned, and told him that some of his chemistry stuffs were broken or thrown out by Mrs. Hudson, and that he had been complaining about that for some time. I also told him that he was in need of a new scarf since he tore his blue one running after a suspect, preferably dark colours. I gave her a few other ideas that I think he would appreciate, but I wasn’t the one buying the gift. She sent “thanks” with nothing capitalised so I’m going to assume she was being sarcastic. I pocketed my mobile and got up to go to Sherlock’s room. I put my ear to the door, but I heard nothing. I sighed and once again went to bed early, thinking about things Greg would want.
Making sure that Sherlock was steady on his feet first, they turned to head over to the door that was barely noticeable with the poor lighting. Sherlock's jacket that held his flashlight was torn off of him while he was struggling. That lamp was the only light source they had. But just before Holmes could touch the knob, the fireplace was suddenly set aflame. Both of the men spun on their heel in the direction of the grand fireplace. Standing in front of it was a man, clearly heading into his middle age, the greying hair and the age spots on his hand was solid evidence.
This was all uncharacteristic for you, but I knew why you were doing it. You wanted reassurance that you were still you, and who better to tell you than me, right? I chuckled and told you that you were still you, no illness could ever change that. I told you that you were my Sherlock, and that I loved you and that we would make it through this together. I told you that it was just the two of us against the world, because frankly, I felt like the world was being pretty vindictive at the time. Your eyes danced away from mine and you looked like you were processing what I told you. You were mine, love, no matter what, you will always be my brilliant Sherlock.
“Well, if it’s really bothering you, I can switch with you. It’ll be easier for you to sneak information out of Greg.”
There was no response at first, but John was too drowsy to even find the mental strength to get upset so either the Doctor was going to tell him or he was going to go to bed angry, which was the last thing he wanted. The Doctor's mouth opened slightly and his eyes darted around the room as he tried to piece together a response but to no avail.
Thank you all so much for sticking with me even with the long wait for the chapters! I hope you all enjoy the story as we continue!
And there went the sad look in his eyes. I quickly opened my mouth and said, “I’m not going anywhere, Sherlock. We’ve got a good thing here, I think.”
The voice told the two that he was from one of the posh areas of London and clearly had good education. His manner of speech and his stance revealed that he was once a professor of some sort. At least, that's what they deduced. Holmes and Sherlock found themselves squinting. The fire was raging; its flames were spouting out of the fireplace and only a mere few feet away from touching the floor and setting the room ablaze. They wondered how the stranger could stand so close to it, but have no risk of getting burned.
There they were about half an hour later walking through the cobblestone streets of London, enjoying the nice weather and the company of each other. They would’ve been out faster, but Sherlock wanted to look as “presentable” as possible, what he really meant was that he wanted to look gorgeous. John knew that there were some self-esteem issues tied to that reason, but he would always tell Sherlock how good he looks when he’s in clothes, and when he’s not. The blush that reaches Sherlock’s cheeks is one of the things that keep John going.
“Your friend, the one with the suspenders, I believe he calls himself The Doctor. He told Watson, John, and me that we were the same person. We just come from alternate universes.”
"They may be ruthless monsters, but there is a way to beat everything, John. Besides, when they aren't trying to throw you into a different time period, they are just statues, and nothing more."
John looked out of the window and watched the buildings outside blur as the car sped down the street. They've been in the car for close to twenty minutes and with each minute that passed, John got more and more anxious. He didn't realize it but he was squeezing Kylie's hand. She looked up at him and said, "Papa, you're hurting me."
John shouted. He ran over to the groaning man on the floor and helped him up. Sherlock propped himself up on John's strong body and held a hand to his head.
Sherlock pulled back into the kiss, this time softer and not as impatient before. His hands working their way to John’s shirt, unbuttoning with ease. John moved toward Sherlock’s belt, taking his time unlatching the hooks and pulling the belt from out of the loops. He dropped it to the floor and the metal of the buckle caused them to separate. John leaned his head so that their foreheads met, and the two closed their eyes as they breathed tender “I love yous”. In one fluid motion, Sherlock shed John of his shirt and the two watched as it softly touched the floor. John smiled and moved his hands to Sherlock’s thighs and worked him out of his pants and underwear. He paused, gazing upon his lover’s gorgeous body, the way his chest heaved, the black of his pupils, the perkiness of his pink nipples against his pale skin. John had never felt so blessed before. He chuckled and kissed Sherlock twice on his lips before removing his own clothes. Sherlock laid under him, his long legs wrapped around his waist, arms wrapped around his neck, eagerly waiting for John to make love to him. John pecked him on the lips and continued to pepper kisses down Sherlock’s long neck, stopping to suck on the especially sensitive parts of the detective’s throat. This earned him soft rumblings from within Sherlock, and low utterances of his name, John’s cock rising in response to his lover’s pleasure.
“We haven’t been up very long. I wanted to stop her crying before you woke up. I failed at that, it seems.”
John’s smile quivered at the statement. And Sherlock let one more tear slide down because he couldn’t hold it in anymore.
‘Meaning they die, John I’m not a child nor am I an idiot, people either die in surgery or they don’t, and even if they don’t, the surgery might not work and the cancer might still be inside of them. I don’t want to be one of those people,’ you said, ‘I want to be among the people that survived and are cancer-free. Do you think that could happen to me? I won’t ask you to promise me that because promises can’t be kept.’
John cursed himself at the way Sherlock deflated. What was he doing wrong? What was making him unhappy when he was so cheerful a few hours ago? Sherlock sighed and looked down at his plate, twirling his spaghetti on his fork and eating it with a mournful look. John did the same and when he swallowed, he looked up and saw Sherlock with his puppy face. John smiled and said, “This is good, Sherlock!”
“Don’t worry, it’s non-alcoholic, your buddy Mike stopped off at the shops earlier and brought me my own supply so that I wouldn’t…you know…” Her voice trailed off and her eyes wandered down to her glass. John stared at her for a while before giving a huff and then a tired smile. He clapped a hand on her shoulder, and her blue eyes trailed back up to his.
“I think, it was because I’ve seen how Harry was treated because she was brave enough to show the world who she really was. I didn’t want to be treated like that, I wanted to do my best to fit in, so I’ve kept it locked down inside. But I always hated myself, I hated myself because I wanted to be brave, I wanted to be brave like Harry.”
Sherlock was upset. Sad. He couldn’t stop thinking about his time away from London, when everyone thought he was dead and he wished at times that it was true. He thought he could keep it to himself, without bothering John or Rosie, but he was wrong. He made them uncomfortable, and now he was making John worry even though he told himself not to. He’s just been so tired, his appetite was nonexistent, and even moving made his bones ache.
He was disappointed when the doorbell rang. He nearly wished that he didn’t order food and scrounged something up in the kitchen, he didn’t want to get up and leave Sherlock’s presence. He placed Rosie on the sofa in place of his absence and walked to the door. While he was discussing the prices with the delivery man, he heard Sherlock’s gentle voice talking to Rosie.
Immediately, he began to grind the rope tied around his arms that were no doubt covered in burns from rubbing against the rough material against the chip. It would take time but he would still be free in the end. He found himself concentrating on nothing else besides Sherlock's wellbeing. He could feel the determined beads of sweat form on his forehead, and the wetness of the tip of his tongue as he tried to break free of the rope that bound him. Obviously the person who tied this knew a great deal about knots and the like.
“…Those few months before Kylie came were a bit of a blur to me. All I see are the flashes of pink and other vivid colors from the baby’s accessories we bought, along with your unsatisfied face. I know that it wasn’t the fact that we were getting the baby, I mean you brought up the subject, but you weren’t a fan of all the shopping we had to do. But deep down I know you enjoyed picking out all the miscellaneous weensies that Baby’s R Us had to offer, that Minnie Mouse sleep suit you bought showed me that. For once in my life, I felt truly happy. Sure it wasn’t what I wanted exactly, but I’m still pretty damn happy about where I ended up. I would come back from work and see you sitting there or playing your violin, and then the box that held the baby’s crib in our room and I couldn’t help but grin like an idiot.
After the tea was made, and Sherlock’s singing turned to humming, John was sat on the sofa with a dozing baby in his arms thinking about Sherlock. Sherlock was in the kitchen trying his hand at making spaghetti. He told John that cooking is chemistry if you think about it, and he is a graduate chemist. John wanted to tell him that there was more to it, but was too distracted to say anything.
“John if you go out there with us, you are at risk just as much as we are. Are you sure this is what you want?”
It wasn’t until I looked down that I realized you were holding my hand, and quite tightly too. I gave you a gentle squeeze and watched as the corners of your mouth curled into a small smile, it wasn’t a happy one, but it was something. I just didn’t want you to be scared, Sherlock. Not when I was there with you.
“I should think it has something to do with that Weeping Angel that we have encountered earlier today.”
When John kissed Sherlock goodbye, he immediately missed him. He took the taxi to his job and couldn’t stop thinking about him the whole ride. He looked so perfect wrapped in his housecoat, holding Rosie, kissing his cheek and wishing him a good day at work. It was all so domestic. He looked at the clock, one minute passed, he looked again. Three minutes passed. Clinics are never slow, it’s that some days people seem perfectly healthy, and then others, the whole of London is trying to get themselves examined. Today was one of the days where he was going to see more paperwork than patients, save for the moms who insisted that there was something wrong with their kid, or the usual patient that searched their symptoms online and are convinced they’re dying. Other than that, there was hours of him thinking about Sherlock and Rosie, wondering what the two were doing. Teletubbies was probably over now, he knew how much Sherlock hated that show. He smiled just thinking about the man’s face.
She hopped out of her chair and walked over to him. He felt her little arms wrapped around his waist. His hand moved down to rub her back.
“Uncle Mycroft didn’t tell you? Whenever you lose your teeth the tooth fairy comes and gives you money.”
In bed, after I turned off the light and said my goodnight, I felt your side of the bed shift around a bit, and then the familiar sensation of your curls tickling the bottom of my nose. You were cuddling with me, the first night in a while you wanted to. You gave me fluttering kisses on my chest, and then you kissed my scar and shuffled into me even more. I appreciated the fact that you were doing all of this, but I couldn’t help but wonder, how this news was going to affect you, nevermind the surgery.
John looked over at his baby who was occupied with the letter blocks scattered on the carpet. Her hair grew a bit longer, it was now covering the tips of her ears. Her chin was wet with drool. Her outfit was a red long-sleeved shirt underneath overalls that had a bee sewn onto her chest pocket. John’s brows furrowed slightly at her clothes. What was off about them?
'I'm not going to hospital, John, and that's final!' Remember how angry your words were? The way your voice returned to normal, just to yell at me? You were like a wounded animal, you felt trapped because you knew that no matter how much you argued and said that you were going to stay in the flat with me and Kylie, you were going to end up in the hospital either way. I couldn't see you suffer like that, love, not when there was a hospital only a few minutes away from us that could help you. You loved to remind me of my career as a doctor, but you failed to realize that I do need equipment in order to actually do my job if it called for such.
“I can be as negative as I choose, Watson, but I never find myself worrying about anything anymore.”
‘Mr. and Mr. Holmes-Watson, please, take a seat!’ She motioned for us to sit down in the chairs propped in front of her desk. Well at least she wasn’t homophobic and completely heartless, right?
John bit his lip. How can he possibly describe that? There were so many things to say, but he didn’t want to overwhelm him.
I let her disappear into the crowd before I took my own leave, giving Greg a short wave before exiting the building and returning to Sherlock. He seemed better in spirits when I came back. He asked me how the party was, and I told him it was an office party, it was horrible. He chuckled at that and saw the gift boxes in my hand. His face fell a little and he pointed to the boxes.
I entered the room and you were sitting up in bed. You looked healthier than most days, or maybe it was all in my head. You were bunching up the blanket on the bed. You didn’t even respond to my entrance. I stood in front of the door and waited for you to say something. The silence was deafening.
Sherlock’s eyes danced away from John’s. John couldn’t help but love the man even more. He spent so much time trying to make John happy that Rosie, the ticking time bomb, literally exploded in the middle of his shopping.
What would she know? She never met Sherlock anyway. He could show her all the home videos, and show her all of the photos, but it wouldn't be the same of knowing him. She wasn't old enough to experience the full effect of living with Sherlock Holmes, of loving him. John did, on the other hand. He envied Kylie slightly for that. She doesn't have to go through this. The pain of waking up empty inside, she doesn't have to deal with the exhaustion of trying to get out of bed in the morning, and putting a fake smile on her face just so people wouldn't ask her what's wrong. He knew that they knew, but they tried to show him sympathy, and John would clench his teeth because it was all of the people who couldn't stand Sherlock when he was alive. Kylie doesn't know about any of that because she doesn't have to go through it.
I told you that you were the most human person that I had ever met, and that you were going to be a good parent because you were a great husband. It's true that you have...problems expressing yourself compared to other people, but so do I, so you're not completely alone. I told you that we would raise a child with the same intelligence as you, you snorted and said that one genius in the family was enough, and that you didn't want her to grow up like you did. I'm still sorry that you had to go through that. I wanted to reassure you, to tell you that everything was going to be okay. Even though you showed me those small smiles and responded to my words, I knew that you didn't believe me. There was still something wrong that you refused to tell me. A part of me knew, of course I did, I'm a bloody doctor, but I think that I was waiting for you to tell me. I don't know why I expected you to say anything to me.
You looked pained. You were paler and your lips were drawn together to create a solemn expression on your face. Did I feel bad for making you feel like that? I don’t know. I want to say that I do, but then I would have never gotten the truth out of you. You sank down to the bed like a deflated balloon and exhaled shakily. I was angrier and grew more anxious by the minute. I always hated it when there was something wrong with you, because then you would never tell anybody and it would only hurt you more.
She only smiled at him, and then faced the front of the car. John took a look at Mycroft, who was typing away at his mobile phone. God only knows what he was writing up. John remembered the time that Sherlock stole Mycroft's phone, just to see what was in the blasted thing. Sherlock cracked his code and then got so worked up that he waved it around while John was boiling a pot of water and accidentally dropped it in. Nobody moved at first, Sherlock and John just stared at it, and then the phone shorted out. John got a ladle and took it out. There was more staring, Sherlock poked the home button to see if it would work again. John had the urge to burst out laughing, but Sherlock looked like he was in no mood to be laughed at. They tried everything, the rice in the bowl, taking apart the phone and then letting it air dry, they even borrowed Mrs. Hudson's hair dryer and tried to use it on the phone, but to no avail. The next day, Sherlock was due to see Mycroft, but he refused to tell him about the mobile. He and John hatched a plan to make it look like Mycroft broke his phone, and it succeeded. Sherlock handed Mycroft his beloved mobile. and then started to taunt him about all the incriminating evidence he found. Mycroft set it down on the table, right next to "John's" water. John then acted like he tripped over Mycroft's umbrella, causing him to turn around, and knocking the cup over. John should have taken his phone out when he saw Mycroft's face. Needless to say, the plan worked, and Sherlock avoided his death at the hands of his brother. John always wondered since then, did Mycroft know that it was already broken and just humored his brother?
Just like that they left the flat. Before they could leave the building, they were stopped again by John.
When he gets home, Sherlock is fast asleep on the couch with Rosie tightly held in his arms. He carefully pulls her out of his arms, and puts her in her crib. When he returns, Sherlock is still laid out on the sofa, chest heaving slowly and mouth parted slightly, the low snores here and there. John would have taken a picture of him because he looked so adorable. But this wasn’t something that he normally did. John bent down and nudged him softly so he wouldn’t be startled.
I felt your body stiffened. You hated this so much, I know that you wanted to be back at the flat, we could have been watching a Bond movie, or you could have been sprawled out on the couch deducing every little fact about the actors or the characters on the telly. But there we were, talking about surgery to remove the cancer inside of your body. You deserved so much better than that, we both deserved better than that. You buried your face in the crook of my neck, so I couldn’t get a good look at your face. You nodded, and I had to translate.
“The first night you had to spend away from me, it wasn’t such a pleasant time for me either, Sherlock. You grabbed my arm before I could leave the room. At this point, you were already situated, you had your bed, your hospital gown on, which I know that you loved so dearly, and plenty of needles coming from your arm. You were pleading with me through the eyes that I adore deeply, and you were begging me Sherlock, you wanted me to reconsider, you wanted me to change my mind and save you from the medical hell-hole that you were thrust into. I gave you a sad smile, I couldn’t do that. Your grip loosened as my hand made contact with your own. It was so clammy, and bony, and pale…
‘It’s alright, John. I can handle it from here.’ You reassured me. I didn’t let my guard down until I saw the bathroom door close. It looked like it hurt you to walk. Judging by the area on your body where they operated on, and the painkillers they prescribed for you, I would say that you were pretty sore, Sherlock. You didn’t come out of the bathroom until a good ten, twenty minutes later. I really loved the way you looked in that purple shirt, Sherlock. I mean good lord, it was the tightest shirt you owned and it just looked so…so good. You were in your usual posh, ‘look at how smart I am’ stance, but you looked pale and like you needed to sleep.
“John, there can even be AU’s where we don’t even have the professions we have! I could work in a coffee shop or something.”
John didn’t respond to that, he let the words hang in the air, and Sherlock’s gentle breathing signaling he’s asleep. Carefully, John took Sherlock’s phone and set an alarm for forty-five minutes. It wouldn’t be right to leave Mrs. Hudson with the baby all night. He put the phone back in the coat pocket and looked at Sherlock. He was lying on his back, arms and legs sprawled out, sleeping. John smiled and returned to his position.
You wanted to believe it, didn’t you, Sherlock? You wanted to look on the bright side, but your magnificent head of yours, it wouldn’t let you. We were all thinking it, weren’t we? We all had that underlying feeling that something was going to happen. We just didn’t know what it was yet.
‘Kylie’ you started to say, ‘I may not get the chance to say this to you later, so, while I still remember, let me say it now.’
John placed his hand on Sherlock's. He looked over at the man who was now helping himself off of the floor, picking his hat up and placing it back on his head.
He obliged anyway and laid in the bed. He wanted to talk to Sherlock, there was so much he wanted to say, but he became so tired. He fell asleep staring into Sherlock's soft blue eyes, and the faint smile he had spread across his lips. His sweet, gentle lips.
“John Watson, you are, brave, kind, loyal…handsome, quite handsome, very handsome, if I might add. You have seen war, and all the horrors that come with it, but yet, you don’t let it overtake your life, you find a way to fight it and I admire you so much for that. You surprise me, actually. Never would I have thought that I would ever find somebody who could tolerate me for as long as you have, let alone want to marry me. You are something special, John.”
John sniffed a couple of times and then walked away from the fridge, allowing the words that he scribbled down to sink in. This time, he would be remember. He shut the telly off and walk back into his room and laid down on his bed. He stared up at the ceiling, and later on, he fell asleep.
Sherlock was carding his fingers through Rosie’s blonde locks as he talked about his day. John’s shoulders sagged at what he said. It was true that John wasn’t really in the best of moods when coming home from work although he tried to not let it affect Sherlock and his baby. But Sherlock’s a genius, and he knows when John’s had a bad day.
John's eyes widened at the sight of the Doctor standing outside of the window. They were sleeping on the ground floor since there were only two rooms on the first. The Doctor reminded him of a ghost, or something otherworldly, he looked like he was almost illuminated, as the contrast of the dark night sky with his pale skin and bulging, wild eyes. He was smiling, at least he was happy to see the men.
They took a cab the next morning, together they smiled and whispered and laughed like they were telling secrets. The driver looked back at them a few times, wondering if they were going to have sex in the backseat, he was relieved when they didn’t. Sherlock chuckled. They entered the flat and Mrs. Hudson was singing something to Rosie that made here giggle and the two men sighed, they prepped to return to an angry baby and a tired Mrs. Hudson. When John shut the door and Sherlock shed his coat, the old woman smiled and walked over to them with the baby in tow.
In the late hours of the night, John woke up to find Sherlock snuggled into his embrace. Usually, John would have been sleeping on his back, as his days in the army forced him into the habit, but tonight, he just wanted Sherlock close to him. He wanted to treasure his presence, since he couldn’t when they were out in public. He remembers the talk Watson had with him while they were out trying to get a better understanding of each other.
Sherlock knew that John was angry at his sister, but that anger was made out of love for her. He hates seeing her hurt herself like that. Sherlock often wonders if that’s how it was for Mycroft all those years ago when he first found Sherlock drugged out of his mind and on the verge of death. He tried not to think about it. He forced himself to focus on this day, yes, this day of happiness. He heard Lestrade tap his fork on his glass to get the attention of the guests.
"It would be best to not keep them waiting, dear brother; you know how crowds get when things are behind schedule."
I was silently hoping, praying that you didn’t see the tear trickle down my cheek. I couldn’t think about that again. I couldn’t. You were silent too; you soaked up all of that information and began processing it.
He managed to not get drunk, but he couldn't help but get a nice buzz from his drink. He had to get Kylie, she was probably at Mrs. Hudson at this time. He threw his coat on and then left the flat. He could walk straight, that was good. He could form thoughts, which meant that he would be able to get Kylie and bring her back without anybody being none the wiser about his drinking. He managed to limit himself this time, no Sherlock, no Kylie, nothing stopped him this time. He crossed the street and was now in front of Mrs. Hudson's flat. He half-expected the knocker to be crooked, but it was straightened. Sherlock would have fixed it as soon as he saw it. John knocked on the door, and not too long after he knocked, Mrs. Hudson opened the door. John noticed that she wasn't smiling, as she usually did. Immediately, John was worried and said, "Mrs. Hudson, what's the matter? Is Kylie okay?"
The chapel was illuminated with radiant shades of yellow; it contrasted perfectly with the once dull room. The audience sat in their respectful seats, whispering their thoughts on the upcoming ceremony, or weeping silent tears because they could not control their emotions at such a joyous occasion. Collectively, they sounded like a hive of bees at work, buzzing so loudly that to an outsider it would sound like nothing more than murmurs of incoherent words and inaudible whimpers. These people were here for Sherlock and John, albeit there were a few late guests, but they were very welcomed.
Sherlock wiped his mouth after placing his fork on the empty place. He looked up at John with fullness and love.
Sherlock’s bottom lip quivered a bit and it made John sad to see. Sherlock held his arms out for the baby and said, “I can put her to bed. You can go to the table.”
“Oh that much I know, Holmes has the same brother, I too think that he has a lot of explaining to do for his brother’s cold demeanor. Holmes barely speaks a word of his childhood, but I do hope that he hasn’t had to go through the same rough one as your Holmes does.”
"The only time I would have to scold you is when you act out in the rude manner that you now possess! This wouldn't be an issue had you only watched where you were running!"
'He's ill and there's nothing I can do to cure him. You can forgive him if he's a bit distant, Kylie, he's just really sad and he doesn't know how to handle it.' I pressed my lips to her forehead and gently rocked her back and forth. You were deathly quiet in there and I didn't stop worrying for a second.
Anyway, happy Christmas everyone! Sherlock’s out right now and no he’s not out on a case, he’s actually at the shops with Mrs. Hudson if you can believe it. She told him that she would make him a strawberry cheesecake under the condition that she helped him with the groceries. The man’s got a fondness, and by that, I mean that he absolutely loves cheesecake and, so he went, which means I’ve not got a lot of time to write this.
You were still pleading with me, you shook your head and your bottom lip was quivering. Eventually you let out a sigh and sulked over to the chair and sank down in it. I gave you an apologetic look, before I gave my attention to our guests. I cleared my throat and opened my mouth. I knew that I was speaking, I just couldn’t hear it.
John didn’t respond. How could he? What did he, a worn-down war vet, ever do to make a man like Sherlock Holmes, find him worth his time? As if Sherlock knew what he was thinking, he simply wrapped his arms around John’s small body and pressed a kiss to his forehead when he heard John’s tiny whimper into his shirt.
Of course, the temptation grew so strong that I couldn’t fight it anymore. I was surprised; it took me a whole hour to actually do it. I felt so bad, Sherlock, but it was for your own good. It could have been drugs, it could have been something else, I was just worried for your health.
“You don’t have to say anything right now, I just wanted to tell you that before I scared myself into never telling you, like so many other things I’ve been meaning to say but never have…”
“The dragon is starting to grow on me, John…John?” Sherlock turned to face him and John’s cheeks reddened at being caught staring.
"As much as I would love to, John, you said it yourself, we have to get some rest. But I'm almost positive that there will be time after our wedding."
“John!” They both exclaimed as they ran over to him. He was unconscious, that much was clear. The Doctor bent down to examine John further as Sherlock searched around them with his flashlight. Nobody was there. He was going to turn his attention to John when he felt something prick him in the throat. He touched it and it was a poison dart.
“No, you know what I mean. I let her go, Sherlock. Our daughter, the last connection I had to you. Kylie…my little pup…”
“From the day we met you never once failed to call me every variation of the word ‘brilliant’ or ‘extraordinary’. You’ve always made me feel like I belonged, like it was okay to be me, that I am doing good…even when I have trouble believing it some days.”
“John, it is my duty as your lover to tell you all the things I love about you, just as you do to me every waking moment. You’re my best friend, you know that right?”
Sherlock seemed to not notice any of this; his eyes were trained on John’s. If Sherlock’s eyes were a sniper rifle and John his target, he would be lying on the floor in a pool of his own blood. The soft pink lips were trying their hardest to not bust out into a mad grin. Sherlock was beaming with excitement and passion, with a cloud of warmth surrounding his very aura and smothering John with it. Sherlock picked the tuxedos, he was very adamant about their physical appearance during the big day. John could spend the whole day thinking about how many shops he was dragged into to be fitted for the perfect tuxedo. It didn’t matter to him, what he wore, but it made him feel fuzzy inside as he watched Sherlock scurry about the day trying to perfect their wedding and plan everything accordingly. In the end, Sherlock was happy, and that’s all that John needed.
It’s been at least three weeks since Kylie was gone and John couldn’t remember the last time he spent a whole day sober since. He woke up and ate something that didn’t require cooking or cleaning afterward. He would stumble his way into the bathroom and stare at the man in the mirror. His hair was all over the place, his eyes were bloodshot, and the bags under his eyes were bigger than he’s ever seen. He wasn’t getting much sleep. Sometimes Sherlock would show up, and he would hold John and whisper in his ear and tell him that he had to stop hurting himself. John would stare up into Sherlock’s eyes and he would move in and he would try to kiss Sherlock, but Sherlock wouldn’t let him. John would just get angry and push him away and then shout. Sherlock sat there and listened to John vent. After a while, John would stop shouting and then he would break down again and beg Sherlock not to leave anymore. John knows that he would never act this way sober, he would be resigned to keep it all in.
John gave Sherlock a stare full of the mutual love that they felt for one another. Sherlock was waiting for this to be over; he was getting a bit antsy.
“Yes, yes, it is. Sure there are a few gits who don’t like the fact that people like someone of their own gender, but other than that, yeah. People can choose to love whoever they want.”
They were thrusted forward this time and Sherlock let go as well as John, who fell on top of the detective. The TARDIS shifted to the side abruptly and they went rolling across the floor and Sherlock ended up on top of John. They were both breathing in and out from screaming and trying to grab on to the railings but failing miserably. Again the time-machine titled forward and they were both sliding across the floor and only stopped because they banged their heads against the panel. Just like that, everything seemed to stop and calmed down. Sherlock was still laying on top of John, whose legs were no up and pressed against Sherlock's waist, making them look like they were in a very suggestive position. The Doctor pulled the lever down.
When he left, I held you closer and kissed your cheek. I might have said something to you, I was honestly too tired to remember. I fell asleep with the scent of your curls in my nostrils, and the warm feeling of your body pressed against mine, even though you had no top on. I remember rolling the blanket down to see where they operated. It was bandaged so I didn’t get a good look, not that it bothered me anyway, and I examined it when we got home anyway. While I slept, I slept in peace. There were no war nightmares, no tragedy, just me and you. I haven’t had those dreams in a while now…”
That night, after I put Kylie to bed and got my pyjamas on, I lie down; you were already in bed because you didn’t leave the room ever since our meeting with the others. I could hear Mrs. Hudson crying softly downstairs, and I felt awful. Knowing that you had the illness, and being a doctor, made me worry for you so much, because I know what cancer can do to people, I’ve seen it first-hand. I didn’t want that to happen to you, Sherlock. I wanted you and me to be together for as long as time would allow us.
He changed her diaper before he put her new clothes on, thankfully it was only pee. He’s scarred from their previous time together. When he held her up to blow a raspberry to her stomach, she kicked in him in throat and he thought he was going to die.
“Calm down John. I know this is hard, I’ve went through the same thing, as you pointed out, I can’t promise you anything, but I can try to get Kylie back for you.”
His phone was vibrating and it was just the person he wanted to call. He heard Rosie screaming in the background. Sherlock must have been holding her.
With the soft smile of silent defeat and the cloaked emotion of jubilation, Mycroft gave John a pat on the shoulder, a gentle pat, John could barely feel it, and then giving his little brother a compassionate hug before making his way over to Greg. John’s smile faded for a brief minute, but returned again at the sight of his Sherlock, showing as much sentiment as he pleased without feeling any shame or regret for it. John found his hands automatically connected with Sherlock’s, and gave them a light squeeze as they shared one more look before turning to face the vicar.
I watched as you absorbed all of the information about her. You’ve always had the most attractive face when you were getting new information, more knowledge about a person, I could look at you for hours. I interrupted Lara while she was giving us the rundown.
And that’s why I told myself that I’ll try and listen to Harry’s advice and talk to you. It was worth a try. It had to be.
The first thing that popped up was Google. You were probably in the middle of searching for something when you took the break. Inside of the search box, it said, ‘Statistics of cancer-removal surgeries’.
'It’s going to take a lot of readjusting in our life, I know, but I’m willing to work a few things out with you. But I’m not about to give up the cases, or my experiments.'
John sniffed. She didn't mean to make him angry. This was the reason why she hardly ever had conversations about her father, either John got upset or sad enough that he would drink from his bottle and won't stop until he fell asleep. She's only seen him do it once before, but after she told him about what happened, he told her that he would never do it again. She trusted him enough to take his word. He hasn't done it since then.
“…I’ve always thought that I was alone, and that alone protected me, but it didn’t. It made me worse.”
John trailed off. He stared at the black headstone some more, and then he grimaced. He kept on talking.
Kylie looked up at John and saw that he wasn't really listening to her. She scrunched up her nose and said, "You know Papa, it's rude to ignore someone while they speak."
“Say my name like that again. Please, love. You feel so good, I like to see you feel this good. You’re extraordinary, you’re dashing, utterly handsome.”
'He's waiting outside, he's not very good at stuff like this.' That's what I told her. She accepted the answer.
Sherlock pondered the question before answering. He shrugged and said, “Yeah but you’re my git so it’s all fine. I don’t mind.”
He noticed Sherlock’s tears, and moved in to kiss the salty lips. Their tongues exploring the other’s mouth, soft moans are made, they don’t part until their bodies crave oxygen. They panted and John moved in to kiss Sherlock’s lips again.
Sherlock turned to face John now. He hugged his knees to his chest and wore a wry smile. He cocked his head and John wanted to kiss the smug look off his face. “Tell you what, let’s play a game of deduction.”
"Thank you. I promise that we won't stay long at all. Hopefully, he'll heal fast. He doesn't like to be sick or injured in any way."
"Well, if I'm correct, we should be in Paris in the year 5454, I hear that it is very romantic at that time, perfect for soon-to-be husbands, eh?"
Every so often I would find you in our room, or in the nursery that was once my bedroom, staring at all of the decorations for our special arrival and processing all of your emotions and thoughts. I didn’t know at why at the time, love, but you seemed to be distant. At first, I just let you be because I know that you were feeling a bit nervous at the thought of a baby entering our home. Mrs. Hudson was extremely thrilled; she would spend more time in our flat than she ever did before, just being her usual self, except I heard the words “baby” and “parents” a lot more. I posted the happy news on my blog and the encouraging comments and praises that we got were overwhelming. Even Harry commented, she said that I needed to call her as soon as the baby was born; I was feeling zestful at the moment so I agreed, the both of you were surprised that I said yes but that’s my sister and this is her niece so I figured that I was doing the right thing. She even stayed sober just to see us.
Watson squinted as he peered into the dark corners of the room, still not finding the reason for the noise. The hairs on his neck were standing still; he felt shivers make their way down his spine. He was scared, he knew that much. But he wasn't going to let the enemy find out. It was then he heard a very familiar voice.
“All of it is gone. The markings from Mrs. Hudson when the CIA agent attacked her, the little scuff marks of our feet when we were too tired to function. You left a bit of sauce right where your hand is the night we first met. I hadn’t noticed myself until the day after. Your finger must’ve hit the plate when we left Angelo’s.”
She waved to you, but I don’t think you realized, you were lost in your mind trying to find some way out of your hopeless pit of boredom. Me, on the other hand was happy to see her, or maybe I was happy that she could finally see my baby, see how well I was doing while she was out getting wasted every other night. It’s cruel to think that, I know, but I’ve seen her do so many…reckless things, and then it got so much worse after Clara left her.
At first, John dismissed it as nothing more than grief. He missed him, God he missed him so much. He could go and visit him every day, but it wouldn't change the fact that John's chest ached each time he left. He wished that they could have had more time together, that it wasn't fair. He wished that he had his Sherlock back. Kylie almost never brings him up around John, but when she does, John responds to her, answers her questions about what was Sherlock's favorite color, when Sherlock's birthday was, what his favorite song on the violin used to be. Sometimes he would entertain it for as long as she wanted to, but on some days he would give a brief response and then act as if the conversation never happened. Those days happened more than most. They were the days were John would sit up in his flat while Kylie was off at school, swishing around the cup of whiskey he held while thinking of Sherlock Holmes, his husband, his best friend, his world.
“We’re? Do not mistake that they are not us, Watson. While they share the same name and back-story, it does not mean we are the same entity. They are their own person.”
Sherlock looked down at Rosie and whispered, “I am his love, Rosie.” To which the infant just continued to suck on her fist. He seated himself at the table after placing Rosie in her special chair directly in front of the television. John was waiting for him. They shared a glance before digging in. While they ate, Sherlock felt John’s leg brush against his. Maybe it was an accident, Sherlock thought. But then he felt the leg again. He blushed and tried to hide his face from the chuckling man across the table.
Later that night, when they’re lying in the bed together, John plants a kiss on Kylie’s forehead and then her cheek. He nestles her closer to him and shuts his eyes. He has to fight, for her, if not himself.
When he wakes up the next morning, he feels shooting pain in his head. He expected it to happen, he deserves it, quite frankly. Kylie is already gone, he can hear her singing in the bathroom. Good girl, he thinks to himself. He rubs his eyes and feels the moisture on his cheeks and on the bags of his eye. He promised himself that he wasn't going to do this. He can't even trust himself anymore. He wiped away any tell-tale signs from his face and then got up from the bed and walked to the kitchen. He fixed himself a cup of water and dropped the seltzer into the liquid and watched it dissolve. He took a sip from it and heard Kylie open the door. She was already dressed and walked over to John with a smile on his face.
“I am so immensely proud of you, John! When I met you, you were rivaling me in being thin. I see this, as well as your scars, as progress to how far you’ve come. You’re so much stronger than you think you are John. Do not think for a second that you are anything less than perfect to me, do you understand?”
John could barely contain the smile he had when he asked, “So is ‘No shit Sherlock’ banned from the house now?”
They stood in the center of the flat to take in the damage. Sherlock crossed his arms and kicked his foot at the remains of a book. John, holding Rosie, shifted her to his right and turned to Sherlock. The man was unusually quiet, and only uttered a few words when they entered the flat. The walls were black, the décor was scorched and ruined. Everything that they loved in that flat, everything that made 221B was gone. John jumped when Sherlock moved suddenly. He made his way over to the stand that used to hold his music sheets and set it upright. Sherlock turned to his favorite armchair and his brows furrowed. John watched carefully as his gaze went from his chair, to John’s favorite chair. What he didn’t expect to see was a tear roll down Sherlock’s cheek as he whispered, “It’s all gone now, John.”
John stood at the altar waiting for his brilliant groom. He could almost see him now, waltzing down the aisle with his arm draped over his older brother’s, striding with the cat-like grace and agility he has always possessed. He would glance over at Mycroft’s face and see the stoic expression that his brother wore. John knew that Mycroft was happier than he was letting on, but there was still that fear lingering inside him. The paranoia of his little brother’s life partner leaving him for someone better, or because they weren’t as in love as they thought they were. He has told Mycroft time and time again that he would never do that to Sherlock. He’s waited so long for this, and wanted it so bad, and to have this chance now and ruin it later on would surely send him to his grave years earlier than expected.
“What do you suppose we do? If they are as dangerous as you claim they are, surely they have to be stopped.”
The Doctor gave one more smile at Sherlock, before making his way to John, who was, admittedly a bit creeped out. Giving a courteous smile, he held out his hand and waited for John to take it. John's eyes darted to Sherlock, who gave him a curt nod, before accepting the handshake.
Nobody came because they all expected John to help him like he’s done so many times before. They all expected Dr. John Watson to save the day. But John was busy tending to a lost cause.
They both started laughing as John helped himself to his cooking. He was pretty satisfied with himself. He got Sherlock to eat, and praise his food. Today might be a good day.
‘John…I can explain…’ You whispered. You weren’t trying to upset me, or irritate me further because you know how I get when I’m angry.
Wordlessly, Sherlock handed him a plate and John chuckled as he grabbed the rag to dry it. They stood together, focused on their chores. Sherlock broke the silence by whispering, “I shouldn’t have kissed you.”
“Yes, I believe I do.” Sherlock couldn’t help the smile on his face. John turned to face him and rested a hand on his.
Sherlock died from Pancreatic Cancer, he was buried the week after his death. John mourned, and never stopped mourning. He told himself to get a grip. Sherlock would be beyond pissed off if he found out that John saw his ghost. John chuckled at the idea of Sherlock ranting about how, if ghosts did exist, he would not be one of them because it would be meaningless to wander the earth looking for that one thing to allow him to cross over.
Never forgetting that Sherlock spoke, he snapped himself out of the temporary daze and forced the smile back to his face. He would have to reflect on that later.
"While it may be good from a lot of stuff, opening wooden doors is not one of them. This is also one of the reasons I prefer to be in the future and not the past!"
“Fortunately, another woman was in the aisle with me when it happened, she was also a parent, she helped me clean the trolley, myself, and Rosie up with the wipes she carried.”
Sherlock's eyes were slowly closing and John stopped wiping the rag on his forehead and started to gently shake him.
John was just as curious too, if not excited to see Baker Street again. Maybe, whenever the flat is fixed completely, John would go back with him.
Then Molly’s turn came to chat you up. She decided to have a conversation about the oddities that she encountered in the morgue while you’ve been away. Then she progressed into the usual gossip that floated around workspaces, you weren’t too interested in that part, but you let her finish that time and I was thankful for that. By the time she was done, I’d say that six minutes had passed by then, but did you know that? Of course you did. You were having fun, Sherlock. Or the closest bit to it since you hadn’t solved a case for a while. You didn’t even notice me sitting in the chair with Kylie in my arms, watching you talk to our friends that you had been trying to shut out ever since you came back to hospital. I wished that you didn’t automatically try to do that all of the time.
