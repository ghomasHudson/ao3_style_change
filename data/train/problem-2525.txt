“As a reward,” Moriarty said, “I’ll give you time to patch up those wounds, Johnny. See, I’m not a bad guy.”
John took a deep breath, examining the chart in front of him carefully. His hand was clenched tightly on the pliers. Letting out the breath in a long, slow exhale, he opened his mouth and inserted the pliers.
John's breath caught as he heard the footsteps clearly enter the room. Beside him, Sherlock moved slightly, and John looked over to find him holding the mirror. Sherlock glanced at him, his expression clearly asking if he were ready. John nodded and Sherlock stood, keeping the mirror just below the wood pile in his hands.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at it in an expression that John could not interpret.
"Oh, don't worry dear," she said with a laugh. "I've seen all kinds in my day."
"Yes of course I'll..." John stopped himself. "Who says Wizard Holmes will even allow me to stay?"
And then they were laughing. Laughing together. The tension and apprehension and stress that had built up since the explosion releasing, just a bit. And they both thought of their first chase though London--coming back to 221B and laughing together in the hallway. And they thought of how absurd their lives were and how absurd their relationship was. They both leaned into the laugh and let their tension ease and just enjoyed one moment together in the midst of their chaos.
John and Sherlock sat in the back of a cab on the way home from their latest conquest.
“Then I won’t take it out,” Dr. Khatri had clearly learned Sherlock’s pressure point quickly.
Sherlock moved on to his head, the next area that concerned him greatly. Blood pooled around his head and Sherlock gently moved John’s head to the side to find the wound.
“Colonel Hayter?” John exclaimed finally.
“Very good,” Sherlock said finally. “I think we can make our way back now.”
"Ill let him know we're finished here if I see him then," he said, taking John's chart back and smiling kindly at John.
Sherlock growled, but the voice continued.
John rolled his eyes and, very carefully, squatted down next to the body, gingerly moving his leg so that it was out of the way. He looked closely at the woman's face. He couldn't smell alcohol and he saw no signs of asphyxiation. He looked at her neck, but again saw no marks. She was pale and stiff, but otherwise showed no obvious signs of trauma.
“That is indeed troubling,” Mycroft said when Sherlock finished.
"Look here," he said, handing John the small piece of equipment, which turned out to be a magnifying lens.
"What do you want?" he asked.
He jerked back, his hand automatically going to the spot she had touched.
John grinned at him and pulled him closer. “You’re more amazing.”
He explains his progression on the case so far, shows him the video footage of Lord Moran disappearing down in the tube. Suddenly, he is slipping back into his old life with Sherlock, solving cases as if he hadn't died at all and as if everything can just continue despite the long interruption.
“It’s really not––“
“I did no such thing,” John grinned and turned to look at him. “You’re better than you think you are.”
“The more you practise, the faster your body gets used to it,” John teased with a wink. “Do you need help with your back?”
“Hmm?” Sherlock looked up from his book he had been reading for the past two hours. “What is it?”
John warmed it a little in his hand before he coated his fingers and closed them around Sherlock’s cock. “Oh, God,” Sherlock breathed and arched his back into the touch. He pulled John closer and let his fingers run over every spot they could reach. His neck, his back, his arse.
Sherlock leant forward and pressed his lips against John’s as he wrapped a hand around John’s hot length, making John moan into Sherlock’s mouth. He circled the tip with his thumb and then started to stroke him slowly, but firmly.
“John …” Sherlock’s voice was weak and strained when he opened his eyes again. Everything was moving too quickly and he couldn’t make out a single thing in the room. John was merely a silhouette.
“Not anymore, no.”
“Oh, do you know ‘Round the Table Ping Pong’?”
“It’s not a problem, really,” John said. “I wouldn’t have let him alone in his state. Even now, I’m still a bit worried, but I’m sure he’ll be over the worst tomorrow.”
Sherlock nodded. "I solved my first one when I was ten."
“Sherlock …” John answered breathlessly and stepped closer, reaching out to take Sherlock’s hand, but he pulled away and stepped back.
“Being exclusive doesn’t reduce the risks of STDs–“
He blinked a few times and his vision cleared slightly, but not much. Opening his mouth to speak, he coughed a few times. His mouth felt incredibly dry. He swallowed once, twice, before clearing his throat again.
It was the tipping point; his biggest mistake.
Sherlock invites him into his bedroom that night, but they don’t do anything physical. John is neither surprised nor disappointed, only confused at the change in Sherlock’s posture and behaviour when it comes to changing into his nightwear. Does undressing really unsettle him? Letting John see him naked? His skin uncovered?
Despite the merely light touches, all the heat gathered down below, inside Sherlock's pants. The kisses made him feel dizzy, and if he had been standing, he was sure his knees would have given way by now. Grateful for the soft mattress he was resting on and the comfortable weight of John's body, he let his hands roam over John's neck, his upper back and his shoulders – down to his pecs. John didn't let him do this for very long because his mouth was eager to wander on. Over his chest, his ribs, down to his belly button. His tongue dove in, tickling, but somehow even that felt arousing. He could feel a wet patch pooling inside his pants which were getting dangerously tight.
Sherlock hummed as he kissed back, nibbling at John’s bottom lip and pressing his groin against the body above him which pulled away as soon as he started to grind against him.
are! She wants him to find her anyway so why make things more complicated than they actually are?« the man in John’s lap bickered. »They could save themselves a lot of time. Besides, why does the beautiful girl always get to marry the prince at the end? This is so predictable.«
“Moriarty is back. We have to solve this case,” John told him firmly. “Coming down from cocaine every day won’t help us with this.”
Sherlock nodded and then asked, “Where are your friends?”
Sherlock swallowed hard, trying to suppress the feeling of nausea, and went to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea.
»Well, how would I know when you don’t
“As if I don’t know that,” John whispers in the dark. Out loud this time.
“I’ve been here for half an hour, so … enough,” John grinned and pressed a kiss to his right shoulder.
“I promise I won’t have a heart attack,” John tried and as ridiculous as it sounded, some part of him found it immensely endearing. “It’s boring if you just sit there with your book.”
John bursts into a laugh and cannot help but pull Sherlock back up to kiss him breathlessly, not knowing how to control the kiss with all the giggles that escape him. "Truly unbelievable," he murmurs against his mouth.
“We’ve to take … home.”
He hears Sherlock applauding him slowly. He can picture the smug smile on his face and wants to kiss it off him until he doesn’t remember more than John’s name.
"Thank you," he whispered into the silence, "for keeping me right."
It was approximately 6:57pm when Sherlock began to feel cold. He pulled his dressing gown tighter around his body, wiggling his naked toes. Sighing, he got up from the sofa and went to get a pair of socks. He hadn’t bothered to get dressed this morning, as Lestrade didn’t call in on his services at the moment. What was happening to the criminal classes? There used to be more crimes before Christmas. It was disappointing. Were there no murders to commit? No (child) abductions? No attempts of blackmail?
When they broke apart, they got comfortable in each other's arms. Sherlock watched the steady rise and fall of his chest and listened to his breathing. He decided there would never be another night in which John Watson woke up from a nightmare without anyone there with him, to hold him, to whisper soothing words into his ear, to say nothing at all when he merely needed physical contact to calm back down, to talk or to just be there until he could go back to sleep again. There wasn't going to be another night in which he woke up alone from a bad dream. With determination and certainty, he fell asleep.
A few people stood by the cocktail bar close to the volleyball court, but not too many. “You want anything?” John asked when they came past it.
"I'm fine, don't worry," Sherlock answered and waved his hand as if to say it was nothing while in truth his heart still hadn't calmed a bit.
“Well, sunshine? Still swooning over your rugby captain?” Irene greeted jovially as she sat down across from him with her lunch tray.
“You’re a bit of a fanatic, then,” Sherlock stated, looking at the rest of the cassettes. Most of them sounded like either corny romances or overly dramatic action films.
John flipped them around and reversed their positions, pinning Sherlock down by the wrists, and God, it felt so good to have John’s weight on top of him.
“Yes, it’s there! Look!” He sounded terrified. “There’s a second one.”
“And a nice pair of trousers, too.”
John shook his head, capitulating. “I am not leaving,” he said.
»Maybe, I don’t know.«
If he truly loved him, wouldn't he understand why he did it? Yes, he had felt like a wrack after he had taken the drugs, and it certainly had not been a pleasant experience, but after all it had been the aftermath at the end of which they had dared to take what they both wanted. So was it truly so reprehensible?
Nervousness.
Mary teases him when he shaves off the moustache, calls Sherlock “his nibs” and implies he only does it for Sherlock. He denies it, but actually, it’s the truth. It’s not working for him. It’s one of the changes he desperately wanted to happen that did not truly change anything for the better, though.
"You seem a bit on edge," John teases and grins as Sherlock turns his head away, busying himself with the mug again. He is probably cleaning it the third time. John slowly steps closer, wrapping his arms around Sherlock from behind, breathing in his scent.
"Yes, you. I'm surprised Rosie's not awake yet. Mrs Hudson surely is."
»So … nice to me.«
“She–“ John began again.
John opens his mouth, the questions double and triple in his head, but Sherlock goes on before he gets the chance to speak. "I'll spare you all the details for now. You should rest – doctor's orders."
Sherlock shakes his head vehemently. “How do you know about Redbeard?”
“You found a cab eventually,” Sherlock murmured, still not sitting up.
John gave him a lewd look and smirked before he kissed him again for a long moment. “Only if you want to.”
“The bags under your eyes were also very telling, but all in all, yes.”
“Yes, please,” Sherlock whispered and let his arm sink onto his belly.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows as he turned his back to John and picked up another log. Not even a second later, he dropped them because something very cold and very wet ran down his neck. »John!!« he exclaimed and turned around abruptly, facing the doctor who couldn’t help but laugh.
"Oh, Jesus!" "You can't be serious!" they spoke at the same time.
“I’ve waited for this for years,” Sherlock whispers when his lips leave John’s for the briefest of instants. “Do you truly think I care about trifles like this?”
“You’re putting your life at risk and so am I.”
don’t need to see!”
John snorted and turned around before they went past the haven again.
Sherlock huffs a laugh that almost sounds sad. He swallows. Once. Twice. And a third time before inhaling deeply. Bracing himself for John's answer? " … Seven years."
“That’s amazing,” John breathed. “That’s absolutely amazing.”
His heart was in his mouth, and he could feel beads of sweat forming on his forehead. He tried to swallow the lump in his throat three times before he gave up entirely.
He shuffles closer and buries his face in John’s neck, warm breath grazing over his warm skin.
“We need to get you to hospit–“
He reached for the hem of the shirt he had lent John for the night – it was too big for him, but that didn't matter because it had to be removed, instantly – and pulled it over John's head. It took less than a second until John captured his mouth in a sensual kiss once more.
After tea and biscuits, Sherlock walks up the stairs to put Rosie to bed for her lunchtime nap. He holds her close to John's face so he can kiss her goodnight and then disappears for a while. Downstairs, John can hear him cooing and Rosie giggling. If he didn't know better, he'd say that Sherlock is her father. Maybe she really has accepted him as her Papa. Thinking of that makes him smile.
“It’s already past three. Don’t you want to eat something? I made chicken noodle soup.”
happy Christmas with each other
He takes a large gulp of his glass of water. He needs something stronger, but then the rest of the evening is still ahead of him. He looks at the menu to order a good bottle of champagne, and out of nowhere, a waiter appears to help him. It doesn't surprise him that he sounds half like Sherlock. He still wants to talk him out of this, but not on John’s watch.
Sherlock sighed and hunched his back.
John smiles. "Sort of. I don't mind, though. It's a nice way of being roused from sleep."
John smiled and kept on kneading his muscles, which was a real blessing. John's hands on every part of his body were a real blessing. John's fingers wandered lower and lower, running over his sides and making him shiver involuntarily. With gentle pressure, they glided along the grooves of his spine. He took his time with each vertebra, sometimes applying more pressure, sometimes less.
"Jesus, Sherlock," John panted and reached for Sherlock's arm. Sherlock was shaking out his hand from the pain he was probably still going to feel later. It was throbbing already. "Let's get going. Quickly."
"She what?!" To John, it seems as if the only words he has been saying these past few days have been "what" and "how" and "why.” He feels like he has come back into a world where he understands not a single thing.
»Will you finally let me in on what’s bothering you?« John bristled at him.
John's hands were on the waistband of his pants, and for a moment, Sherlock couldn't breathe at all.
"I know exactly what you're thinking, and I know this sort of sigh well enough by now," he answered, propping onto his arm and letting his hand wander to Sherlock's cheek. His thumb brushed over his prominent cheekbone, over his ear until his fingers disappeared in Sherlock's hair. He welcomed the touch; John always did this when trying to make a point. "If we never do anything but this, I wouldn't mind at all. I could go on forever just kissing you."
"Get– Sherlock!" he screamed and his eyes flew open, sitting up and panting hard. He turned around instantly, finding him sitting beside him, taking Sherlock's face into his hands and running his fingers over his cheeks as if to make sure he was okay. "God…," he whispered and rested his forehead against Sherlock's.
"That should be manageable." Sherlock winked at him and opened the door for John, who stepped out of the bathroom, ready for an evening filled with cold night air in his lungs, the chatter of Rosie and her friend, with utter excitement when they receive another handful of sweets to be put into their bags, Sherlock’s repertoire of tricks to those who wouldn’t open the door or shut it in their faces, Sherlock’s hand in his own while they would wait for the kids to return with more candy, warming up by the fire afterwards once all the treats would have been distributed fairly, and even more treats just between the two of them.
John stood next to his bed, looking down at him.
Sherlock’s eyes focussed on John’s right eye, then his left, then his right again, and back to his left; still unable to process, incapable of understanding the reasons.
He was right.
“I am,” John whispered against his skin. “I want you to be happy, Sherlock, but I don’t want to be the person barring the way to a bright future.”
His lips were red and swollen from the kiss, his cheeks rosy and his eyes darker than Sherlock had ever seen them. He must have looked similar. He felt warm and fuzzy all over; the nerviness faded more and more now, only a few traces stayed behind – and of course John noticed.
He hasn’t, has he? No, he–
“Didn’t know you were working here, too,” Sherlock answered; she found herself under his scrutinising gaze.
"Fine. Probably just a bad dream. She's fast asleep again now, though," John replies, tightening his hug. "You're not answering my question."
Sherlock nodded to encourage John to continue what he was doing. The hint of a grin appeared on his lips before he reached for the button and undid it. He pulled down the zipper awfully slowly, grazing his erection that was pressing against it. Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat. Carefully, John pulled them down inch by inch. Sherlock lifted his hips a little to make it easier for him.
He recognised this voice from somewhere, but it sounded so different than usual.
“Aren’t you having one?”
That couldn’t be a good sign.
though?« Sherlock inquired, trying to make John look at him.
“Fine, then.”
The perfect excuse to stay in bed longer than necessary.
John only shrugged. "You have to bend your knees more."
The longer John hesitates, the tenser and more charged the atmosphere becomes. "What's wrong?" Sherlock finally asks, and all John can do is laugh breathlessly.
, and certainly no John Watson would provoke a change when it came to his sexual needs, which were, in fact, non-existent. That was, until a certain point when he saw John in his rugby attire, dirty with soil and mud and grass and rain, smiling at his teammates in utter hilarity.
“I’m not going to repeat the question.”
"Your phone, it was a gift from him," Sherlock pointed out. "It's a new model, only came out a few months ago, so it was expensive. By all means, you wouldn't waste your money on a phone like this, so it was a gift. Another thing indicating this are the scratches around the charging socket. Every time he plugged in the charger, his hands were shaking, therefore the scratches. These signs are only on phones of alcoholics, never on others.”
“That’s one rare opinion.”
, he adds in his mind.
A sad smile appears on Sherlock’s face. He falls quiet for a little while – a silence that seems to stretch on forever, threatening to suffocate John.
The whole incident hadn't happened far from Sherlock's house. Yet, still they found themselves running – if you could call it that. With John's aching back and Sherlock's legs that felt like flummery, it must have looked more like limping, but they couldn't risk the possibility of another unexpected attack.
»I could lend you a woollen jumper if you’re that cold,« John offered.
March
“The well in Musgrave!” John says exasperatedly. “And he was not a dog, he–“
“She’s got a day off. I’m sorry, gentlemen,” the nurse tells them, and Sherlock’s fingers clench around John’s in frustration.
Sherlock looked at John in surprise and utter disbelief. John was holding an Irish Setter puppy in his arms. “John, what–“
“It fits very well, I’m afraid,” Mycroft says. “It wasn’t easy to get this piece of information. She staged her death in order to follow the task set before a long time ago.”
“Hey,” is all John manages.
Sherlock found himself playing along to the movements John invented out of nowhere. They must have been grinning like teenagers madly in love, but then, that's precisely what they were. Sherlock really grew out of his shell, enjoying every beat and every second of this, becoming creative himself. He did not know whether it was John's doing or the fact that he'd had quite a lot to drink as well, but he could not bring himself to get to the bottom of the conundrum.
“How good you are at keeping our daughter from getting high on all the sugar she’s going to get,” John laughed.
“How are you feeling?” He asked him. “Do you have trouble breathing? Do you feel a strain on your heart?”
“It’s not a dumb idea. You seemed pretty enthusiastic about it earlier,” Greg snorted cheekily. “I thought that’s why you chose that outfit.” John waved a hand at him and turned to Sherlock who already regretted having agreed to this. “He suggested the first of us who gets a girl tonight can bring her back to our place.”
“Oh, I’m sure you will,” Karla answered. “I’m really glad you took him in last night, John.”
He was silent for a long time; every time he tried to say something, he was cut off. When he finally got the chance to speak again, he answered, “No. I don’t have the money for it. Just … no, that’s not my bloody job!
Sherlock’s breathing quickened as their noses touched lightly. His eyes were still wide open because the entire situation overwhelmed him. What should he do? What if John didn’t like kissing him? What if it all turned out to be a complete disast–
John laughed at the spectacle as a few guys actually fled to the toilets. “Now I know why Bill dragged me here.”
“Okay. I’ll be right back.”
He doesn't remember much of the rest of the night. Somewhere in the distance, police sirens have grown louder, and someone had taken care of his injuries. No stitches needed, thankfully, but this was a gruesome experience. He feels immensely exhausted, wanting nothing more than to rest, sleep, escape into another world where everything is fine.
He nudged him forward by the shoulders, but Sherlock used that opportunity to his own advantage. Grabbing his wrists, Sherlock made use of the knowledge in martial arts and twisted them – “Argh! Faggot!” – in such a way that he would have a moment to plan his final punch.
He wanted to be honest and open with John because he simply meant too much to Sherlock already. He couldn't go to Cambridge when it meant he would be without John. He was barely able to spend a few hours without him; how was he supposed to manage to be apart from him for almost an entire week? Seeing him at weekends – and surely not even every weekend – wasn't enough. He knew it only took about two hours to travel from London to Cambridge, but that didn't matter to him. Train tickets were expensive. John couldn't afford high expenses all the time. Neither could Sherlock. His parents wouldn't mind of course, but he didn't want to be dependent on them for the next few years. He would need to get a job, earn his own money after classes, and weekends. John was working on weekends, too. There would be little to no time to see each other.
When he opened his eyes again, he found himself in a dark room, judging from the soft mattress he was lying on, in his bed, in only his pants. He blinked himself awake and was relieved to realise that his vision had fully returned. He tried to make out the time on his bedside table when he noticed the table was smaller than his own. Turning around and narrowing his eyes, he saw that there was no window next to his bed either. This wasn’t his room. Where was he?
John grinned. »You do. I’ll record it next time.«
John put the duvet back on the bed, but didn’t cover him. “Sherlock.”
One hand in John’s hair tightens; the other wanders down to his neck, fingers running over a sensitive spot just behind his earlobe.
"You tell me!" The nurse, Rebecca according to her name tag, puts her hands on her hips, looking stern. "Tall guy, fluffy, dark hair, looming outside the room every night. Always looking gloomy and upset at the same time."
"All of a sudden, there was Mum's favourite vase in his hands and he threw it in your direction." John finally looked up at him, reaching out to touch his cheek, running his fingers over his skin. He sat up and pressed his lips to Sherlock's. His chest ached. It ached so terribly with love for John and hate for the things his father had put him through. He hated that his father was still haunting him in his sleep even though he had been gone since John was sixteen.
Sherlock jumped from that rooftop to save his life, … or so he says. He believed it was solely an inconvenience to have him tampering in the affair.
haven’t asked properly.”
“Always the charmer, aren’t you,” John says sarcastically and takes another sip of his tea even though it was still too hot.
"What do we do now?" John asks, forcing himself to sound calm and collected, though is heart is thumping wildly, and he feels like he is trembling all over. An all too familiar uneasiness settles down heavily in his stomach, and he feels like he might be sick.
, he thinks, distraught. Despair and frustration threaten to take over him, and he can’t do anything but wait in the darkness that swallows him whole, his sight, his hearing, but not his thoughts. They keep torturing him, cutting, hitting, stinging, striking.
Sherlock held his gaze and realised the colour of his eyes was just as blue as the sea. “It’s the only place that’s slightly shady.”
“Is your sermon over now? Would you just stop–“
He tries to soothe his nerves, taking slow, deliberately measured breaths, but it’s in vain.
, Sherlock wanted to reply but didn't.
(See the end of the chapter for
, he kept repeating in his head like a mantra, but it felt like a caress.
Sherlock's eyes are on him. Almost piercing. John's mouth goes dry. He wants to refill his glass but resists the urge. Sherlock shakes his head, then looks down at his hands. "I never wanted to leave," he says slowly. "I did what I had to do. My brother knew that but didn't understand why it–" He clears his throat, "why it affected me so much. I ignored his comments until the final straw.”
»Of course you are, but that’s not going to stop us from going anyway,« John grinned.
“John!”
“You wouldn’t believe all the sounds you make sometimes.”
The tip of John’s nose in his hair and two soft lips pressing against the back of his neck interrupted his train of thoughts. He was pulled closer to the warm chest behind him and sighed quietly as he let his eyes fall shut.
“Yes.”
“I am so frightfully sorry to interrupt," Mycroft says with a sneer, "but I am here to bring both of you the news that my men have killed her.”
. “They lay on the floor! Under your damn trousers! More to the point, where did
"Promise," Sherlock answers in a hushed and low tone before he shuts the door forcefully and apologises about the incident.
“I feel sick,” he gasped, feeling as though someone had taken his digestive organs and was squashing them and wringing them like a wet towel. He held his stomach and squeezed his eyes shut.
want to, though. With you.«
“Jesus Christ,” he pants as he enters her.
"He's been here all the time." Mrs Hudson's voice brings him back.
“You’re a soldier, John–“
“Where did you get that?” Sherlock wanted to know; his tone also harsher than he had intended. “Have you gone through my things?”
“You did,” John laughed. “Turn over.”
His vision is still blurred, and the more he blinks in an attempt to see more clearly, the more his head hurts. He's lying in bed. A very uncomfortable one. Must be a hospital.
He answered in German, apologising, and hurried to make a move, which was the worst mistake of his life apparently because the woman must have noticed something in his gait and stopped him immediately.
And he felt absolutely wretched about it. John, as much as he had taken control of the situation, had not wanted this. Again, he was constantly reminding people he was, in fact, not gay. It would be hard to ignore that, even if Sherlock tried. This must be tearing John apart. He would never be able to look at Sherlock the same again now, for sure.
He tried to remember the times John had corrected him on his lack of tact. It typically occurred after he'd made an indiscreet comment or reacted inappropriately.
"He's still in surgery," Sherlock growled.
"John, breathe slowly," Sherlock was crouching in front of John, blocking his view of anything else. "Just concentrate on breathing."
Amelia grinned, apparently despite herself, as she frowned again quickly.
Sherlock decided to keep an extra close eye on John.
“John,” Sherlock said urgently, cupping John’s face in his hands. “John, I need you to wake up.”
“They were… distracted,” Mycroft said. “As you already know.”
"It doesn't look that there are many people to talk to," he said. "Two of them don't have any family at all and the other only has family on the other side of the world."
“I… I can’t…” he stammered (when did he ever stammer?). He took a breath. “Okay. What do I do?”
And between John and this door was a maze of barbed wire filling the entire room. Sherlock could feel bile rising up in his throat.
"Did you see Dr. Azarian out there?" John asked, pulling his hand away from his ear and shoving it under the sheets.
“Or,” Scarecrow’s voice turned dark instantly, “I could just shoot John in the head and have it over with.”
“Hmm,” Lestrade was clearly thinking hard. “A holiday, I guess. You know, get away from it all. Away from all the stress. Away from the city. Somewhere nice and quiet.”
Sherlock couldn’t argue with that. John had been stuck in a hospital bed for nearly three weeks and he was so restless even he was snapping at nurses now. He needed to come home. He needed to be back at 221B.
“Oh, his partner Dr. Watson and I go way back,” Colonel Hayter said dismissively.
"Precisely," Sherlock said, ignoring the incredulity in John's tone.
Sherlock paused.
“Fine,” John groaned.
"What good does it do?" he shot at Sherlock, "Just sitting there in that chair doing nothing? What use is it? Just go!"
Lestrade had then pulled him away, depositing him in some infuriating waiting room and asking him innane questions he no longer remembered about the culprit, leading to his arrest some two hours later. This occurred before Sherlock's mind had fully cleared and settled on the task of finding the man himself--a stroke of genius on Lestrade's part, because, had Sherlock done so, the man would never have been arrested.
»I do have a good taste!« she stated clearly. John chuckled heartily when he saw her stern expression and told her to start the film once more.
He wonders ruefully.
»Yoohoo!« Neither of them had heard their landlady ascend the stairs who was now standing in the doorway to the sitting room and Sherlock’s head jerked around immediately. »Sorry, I didn’t interrupt anything, did I?«
John strokes him through his orgasm until he's shivering from the aftershocks and oversensitivity. He cards his fingers through Sherlock's hair as he collapses on John's chest, catching his breath, not unlike John himself.
-outfit.’
The pills wouldn’t settle his stomach. He vomited several times into the bucket until John wondered how it was still possible because there couldn’t be anything left.
“You’re quiet today, mate, you okay?” Mike asked him.
“Yes exactly, and that’s why I’d like a Kirsch now.”
Sherlock’s eyes widen. He doesn’t even blink.
“Intravenous injection,” Sherlock murmured quietly and closed his eyes. “But I snorted two more lines later.”
Sherlock snorts at that. "It
John laughs, watching him reverently and fondly. He rolls on the condom, giving himself two or three strokes, and leans forward, hovering above Sherlock and kissing the tip of his nose, his cheekbone, and finally his lips. “I love you, too,” he grins sweetly.
Sherlock accomplished the task with a little support from John’s hand on his back. John pulled the shirt over his head and removed him from the drip for a moment to get the soaked piece of garment off of him. Wiping Sherlock’s damp chest, back and neck with the cloth, Sherlock closed his eyes to welcome the wonderful cool feeling on his skin. John dried him off and dressed him in the clean shirt.
“Well, I don’t need to tear this one, I suppose,” she shrugged at let him pass without truly taking offence at his remark. “Have a good night!”
, he thought. Except one thing wasn’t. The man had put the gun into the pocket of his trousers, but he hadn't locked it. Either he wasn't scared of it going off, but he didn't seem to be a professional …
John kisses all the words from his lips. “Sure you were.”
“Sherlock,” John asked, his voice was hushed and his hand rested on his shoulder. “Let’s get you back into bed.”
He is with him.
And then he sees it. Red, bloody marks are covering the entirety of Sherlock's back and shoulder blades. Deep cuts, at least five of them had been stitched up. They sit there like an accusation, in screaming crimson and purple on Sherlock's once so flawless skin. So white and so pale when he last saw him. So bruised and scratched and injured now.
“No,” Sherlock said. “Well, yes. Aside from everything that just happened, something happened a while ago and…”
"Well," Bryan hesitated, "I... I think I may have seen the vampire."
John’s pain was distracting him. He couldn’t think of anything else. John, ever the soldier, was playing it down, he knew. Anybody else would have been screaming or unconscious. Not John. Not his John.
They had been practically begging for a break all this time and he wanted to give them one now, just after Sherlock had dropped that bomb on John.
“It’ll pass. If you sleep and drink a lot, it’ll be over in no time, but you should still keep an eye on it, and if it doesn’t get better, you have to see a doctor.”
The raindrops ran down the window, chasing one another, intermingling, heading for the sill in silent competition with larger drops. Sherlock watched them for a while, but the warmth surrounding him and the muted clatter of the drops threatened to lull him back to sleep once again.
»I look like the most ridiculous snowflake of all time!« Sherlock countered, scowling.
He could hear the wild heartbeat sounding as though it was pounding so hard it was about to jump out of John’s chest.
, Sherlock wanted to argue but didn't.
“Shame,” the man sighed and palmed it before he pocketed it again. “I’ll be around if you change your mind,” he said with a wink.
Sherlock tried to hide his smile. “I didn’t know you could dance.”
“There we go,” John grinned widely and pressed a kiss to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. “It’s always better when you’re smiling.”
John shook his head. »Nobody deserves to spend Christmas alone. Not even your brother, no matter how arrogantly he behaves…«
He wants to move, needs to move, struggling with every muscle he wants to bring back to life. He tries to cry out. Why aren't people standing closer to the fire so that they could hear him?
John knelt beside the sofa. »Food is fine; you should stay away from raw dough. I did warn you.«
“You made a vow to me a long time ago.” His voice is quiet and hoarse from the tears. “This is
“Do you have sunscreen?”
“Wish I were. We only found out recently that she was involved with Moriarty, John. Mycroft would have intervened otherwise. Although he does take his time with that lately,” he says as if deep in thought.
Its warmth spreads through his fingers and palms and his entire body. Should he ask? Should he really dare?
John releases a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “You mean–“
John nodded, wanting to get rid of the lump in his throat. Mycroft left without another word. He looked down at the list when the elder Holmes was out of sight and closed his eyes for a bit. He shouldn’t have listened to Sherlock. He should have taken him to a clinic.
Sherlock nuzzles John's cheek, cupping the back of his head gently. "Tomorrow. I think I'll need to make a couple of adjustments to the song. Finish it."
John looks at Sherlock and sees plainly the shock in his eyes. Nothing else gives him away, just his eyes.
John cleans his teeth, and they go to bed. Sherlock lies down carefully as to not yank off the plaster due to sudden movement. John walks around the bed and joins him from the other side. Their bodies align as if made for one another. Sherlock rests his head on John’s shoulder this time, resting a hand on John’s chest while John’s hand disappears in Sherlock’s curls and he wraps an arm around his waist.
Sherlock sighed, “Irene …”
working on it, but you know. Resisting the urge gets harder every time.”
"Stand like this," he said and showed him how. "Your feet should be about shoulder-width apart. Good. Now shift your weight onto your balls of the foot."
He took a deep breath and opened his eyes again.
"Trying to do what?" He asked as if he were not inches away from his aching erection.
Of course, he should have known that it would not go unnoticed. Mycroft had always been very observant, so obviously, he would become aware of it. He had taught him ways of preventing his mask from crumbling, taught him ways of deleting the biting, hurtful words, and eventually taught him ways of not letting it get to him anymore. He learnt how to properly use his mind to keep feelings and emotions at bay.
A few moments passed, but he could practically still hear the racing thoughts in John’s head.
Sherlock rises and steps to the window. "Good question indeed, John. I have no idea of that myself – yet. But I'm sure a closer look both here and downstairs will solve the riddle."
"First of all, we need to make sure you're okay before we consider any other steps to take," John says with determination in his voice. He squeezes Sherlock's palm gently, wrapping his other arm carefully around Sherlock's waist. "Wherever Rosie is, I can feel she is fine. A father knows that. And since you're her dad, too, you should feel the same."
She waved a hand to dismiss this. "You're very welcome. You just have to be patient for a little longer. It's not quite ready yet," she apologised. "Sherlock was so nervous the poor boy would've cut off all of his fingers if he had helped me," she laughed.
Sherlock nodded, but couldn’t turn to look at John. He couldn’t face him, not like this.
John moved his legs rather unpleasantly, forcing Sherlock to sit up and face him properly. “You can’t pass up that opportunity. It’s an elite university.”
Because John Watson was a terrible man. A fearful man who loved to tease; to touch once and then let you bathe in the sensation of emptiness that he left on a patch of skin that his fingers were no longer interested in for now because they found a much more sensitive spot to work on – a spot that seemed to make Sherlock go even madder when someone touched it in a certain way. John could not find out soon enough how to touch him precisely like that, to make him moan and squirm beneath him.
"I'll quit my job at the surgery," John announces one morning over breakfast. Breakfast that only he is having. Sherlock has taken two bites of his toast. "And …"
They were just an inch apart as John dropped his gaze to Sherlock’s parted lips. The detective noticed; of course he did, but he suddenly felt incredibly nervous and clenched his hands in his lap just to give himself something to do, trying to calm down, but how could one calm down
The grey sky painted the world in a different, lifeless colour. And somehow, that was exactly how he felt, too. Lifeless. Pathetic. Why had he trusted John in the first place? He had no reason. But having been reckless, he had thrown himself right into it. Into a life so different than he'd led before. Into experiences he'd never expected to make. Into sensations he never thought he was even capable of feeling, let alone enjoying.
. There were no secret glances, furtive peeks, no clandestine glimpses. They were allowed to look, to take in, to admire, to stare, to savour. It was not overshadowed by the necessity to take care of bullet wounds, stitches, bruises, or scars in a charged atmosphere in which both of them wanted to be brave enough to reach out and not let go, but never dared.
Days pass. Perhaps it’s just a silly feeling, but something between them has shifted. John can’t quite pinpoint what it is, exactly, but it’s definitely there.
“All the bloody time. In front of the cereal aisle at Tesco, during my dates with Mary – be it at a restaurant or during a quiet evening at home – when we were in be–“ he clears his throat. Great. So much for being honest. “Never mind, just … all the time. ”
lest he in revenge
Beside him, he could feel Sherlock, hovering with what he thought was probably a mix of energy and impatience. Sherlock had been almost as excited as John to get him back to their flat, if only so he wouldn't have to interact with John's medical team any longer.
“John, no! Stop! John!” he screamed as loudly as he could manage.
Fortunately, like the first shot he had received, this shot was not fatal, unless it became infected. It would be painful and John was losing blood, but he wouldn’t lose enough to kill him.
He paused and Sherlock hated him for it. His mind raced through every terrible possibility in that pause so that, by the time the doctor had continued, he was in such a state of distress he didn't think anything he said could upset him.
“Dr. Watson,” he continued, “I simply cannot advise discharging you yet. You still have a lot of healing to do.”
There was a crash and Sherlock and John flew backward into the opposite wall, hitting hard.
“Is it really that important that your little pet not be sullied again?” Moriarty asked, genuinely curious.
"If you had just let us examine the body when we asked..." Sherlock began.
“You know,” Hayter said as they drove over to the Cunningham’s estate, “it’s funny that this happened to these families in particular.”
"We're about to find out," Sherlock had rigged the net so that it was hanging on the ceiling of the roof, attached by a fishing line release.
His progress had been quite slow, punctuated by the need to rest several times before he had even reached the moors just outside of the village. He cursed himself for selling his last cane and not restocking, but he was too far from the village to go back and get a new one now.
“I’m an old man now,” he said happily. “I’m afraid I need my sleep. Please do let me know if you need anything and make yourself at home. What’s mine is yours.”
"Aha!" he said.
John marveled at him a moment in silence, still completely unbelieving that anybody could be so smart.
“Patience,” Moriarty said.
"Exactly," Sherlock was looking closely at the man's hair.
John moaned softly, clenching his eyes even tighter.
"Did you open the black door?" Sherlock asked suddenly.
"You must be John," she said, her voice reminding him of hot chocolate and bedtime stories. "I've heard so much about you. I'm so happy you've finally come."
John raised an eyebrow.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Amelia was squatting near the place in which the body had been discovered.
And so, John Watson sat in his chair in his home listening to his Sherlock and feeling as though all were right with the world, even if he did now have a cane at his side and a not-so-psychosomatic limp.
“Do it,” he gasped.
Sherlock ignored him.
"He has no advance directive?" Sherlock asked, unable to believe that a John had neglected such a preparation.
“Good,” the voice was clearly amused. “I’m glad we have an agreement.”
John, Sherlock, and Colonel Hayter sat comfortably around a roaring fire in well-stuffed armchairs, each cradling a cup of tea.
"Me?" John stared at Lestrade. "Why in the world would he listen to me? I'm nobody."
Adrenaline pumped through John. He moved forward without hesitation, reaching the writhing group and shifting his weight so that he was balanced on his good leg. He took his crutch firmly in both hands and swung, hitting Alec square in the head and knocking him to the side. Before Mr. Cunningham could react, John had swung the crutch around and into his chest, knocking him back as well.
"I am not an amateur detective," Sherlock said, his tone dangerous. "I am a consulting detective. Talk to Detective Lestrade in Kingsbury if you would like confirmation."
The man, whose name was Cedric, lived in a large house on the edge of Porthaven. When they arrived, they found the house closed off by the detectives, but Sherlock ignored the warnings and moved inside, John close after him.
John had looked up in surprise and was now staring down the tunnel.
“Time’s up Sherlock,” Moriarty said. “What is it going to be? Will you let Sebastian shoot John, or will you simply let him have his fun?”
Sherlock shifted, the movement catching John's attention and drawing his eye back.
But if he didn’t… His blood was on his hands either way.
“Not to me,” the voice shot out. “Tell him.”
"Oh, just give him time," Mrs. Hudson said softly. "He's just in a mood. He gets like that sometimes."
“Thank you for letting us visit,” John said. “It is so good to see you again.”
John murmured something softly as Sherlock finished releasing the last restraint, but it was too faint for him to hear. He moved to John’s head and placed his ear next to John’s mouth.
Frustrated, he moved around to the other side of the castle, only to find the same problem. Then, trying to get to the back, he hit a wall that prevented him from moving around the castle entirely.
John looked up to find Sherlock scowling at him petulantly. He ignored this.
"Strange," John said, wincing a touch, apparently at the sound of his voice.
Sherlock was smiling at him as John grew more flustered and exasperated. Why was this so damned difficult?
Sherlock heard the voice in the distance, laughing. He searched the darkness, but he couldn’t find anything. He was about to start running when he heard a moan behind him.
"Just try," John didn't move or flinch, though his skin crawled.
“And his leg?” Sherlock held his breath.
“Dinner and theatre?” Sherlock’s heart sank. Not exactly what he wanted to hear.
“No, John,” he says happily. “You won’t be making that decision I’m afraid. Sherlock, it’s your turn.”
Nonetheless, John tried valiantly to push him up the step. This, of course, resulted in him toppling over and falling directly into Sherlock’s arms with a grunt.
“I just did,” Sherlock shot back.
“He’s my… weak spot,” Sherlock explained with a sigh. “Hurting him hurts me. Obvious.”
“Sir,” one of the paramedics turned to him, “I’m afraid you can’t. But we’ll take you to the same hospital immediately.”
“That was really quite incredible,” Colonel Hayter said as they again sat around the fire in his own manor.
There was a pause.
John had stepped back, frightened.
“Bad,” Sherlock said simply.
John woke again when a stream of light settled annoyingly on his eyelids. When he forced them open, he found the light was coming in though a crack in the curtains of a window he had entirely overlooked the night before. John stretched, but then groaned as pain shot through his leg and down his arm.
John finishes entering the combination and turns the handle. A second passes. They do not hear the lock move. Sherlock holds his breath.
“Oh no,” the voice sang. “Giving up already, are we?”
“Out,” Sherlock said again, moving into his room to change his own clothes.
Sherlock glanced at the clock.
“Of course you would as if I’m okay,” he said. “Fine. I’m fine. You, on the other hand…”
“John,” the voice said, “I want you to tell Sherlock… exactly what your chances of surviving this little encounter are.”
"No," Sherlock dismissed him offhand, pushing his hand away and shoving himself unsteadily to his feet. "John. I need to..."
John struggled for a moment with the crutch, positioning it to help support his weight, before he finally placed his good foot on the ground and levered himself up with the help of the crutch and Sherlock’s hand on his back.
Shit.
The fire did not respond. He added a log, but to no effect. He began to look concerned, something John had only seen when he had been injured by the ghost.
Moriarty smiled.
"That was ridiculous. That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever done!" John breathed.
"John!" Sherlock gasped, rolling over to examine John. "Are you okay? John!"
"Yes," Sherlock said, glancing at him. "Somebody gave her legs. I'm guessing in exchange for blood. If you drink the blood of a human every seventy two hours, you can remain human, correct?"
"You suffered another pneumothorax on the table," he began, his voice monotone, "causing you to go into respiratory arrest. A chest tube was inserted to re-inflate your lung, but the surgeons could not get your oxygen levels elevated enough and you went into cardiac arrest. The surgeons revived you, but they were unable to maintain your oxygen levels and you suffered two more cardiac arrests. They could not continue with your at surgery, of course."
"All the vampires have been gone for hundreds of years," he said. "There is no way one could have remained without being noticed for so long."
John hesitated. For some reason he couldn't fathom, he was reticent to have Sherlock so close to him, touching his naked side. But, he had little
"It's urgent,"' he said, catching the doctor's eye and stepping closer.
"I need one now!" Sherlock moaned.
His lungs were burning and he was beginning to see black on the edges of his vision. He couldn't believe he was going to be killed by murderous mermaids, but he was glad, at least, that Sherlock had made it safely to land.
"I'm sorry," he heard a low voice mumble from seemingly far away as he drifted off into darkness again.
“It won’t last,” Sebastian said to Sherlock’s back. “Moriarty will get me out of here in no time.”
“Fine,” Sherlock said. Then let’s play.
John shot a weary look at the camera.
"Well," Mrs. Hudson paused, clearly deciding how best to explain. "Sherlock can be quite charming when he needs to be. He has a bad habit of using that charm to get what he wants. I suppose a few aunts in the local villages have taken to describing that habit in rather flowery language."
He hears Sherlock breathe in deeply. John lets his hand wander to Sherlock’s cheek, brushing his thumb over his sharp cheekbone. His other hand disappears in the mess of Sherlock's dark soft curls. And then he seals their lips together.
He had seen him everywhere. The reminders
»When you were out, obviously,« Sherlock told him.
“Why? Are you already changing your mind?” Sherlock asked amusedly.
John agrees with him and sits up, reaching for the waistband of Sherlock's pants. He slowly pulls them down, freeing Sherlock's cock, and allows himself to look. It takes his breath away. It's long and slender, flush and pink, nestled in a dark patch of hair, and John wants to devour him.
“Oh yes, definitely,” John whispered. They were fast asleep before another minute had ticked by.
“Just because the rest of you is so charming,” Sherlock grinned.
Sherlock stopped pacing and stared at John, wordlessly, for a heartbeat. Then he tore through the room and picked up the case files, which he had left on the table by the fire. He stood, silently reading for several long moments while John watched, trying to figure out what was going on.
A squat, older woman with gray hair and a kindly smile greeted him when he entered.
"I believe I was clear," Sherlock said simply.
“No,” John said honestly. He knew what they were about to do would hurt. A lot. It would probably cause more damage to his already damaged leg. And his lungs burned with every breath. But they had no choice. The killer could come back at any moment and finish the job. He may even target Sherlock next. That couldn’t happen. It couldn’t. He wouldn’t let it.
Sherlock and Colonel Hayter jumped out of the car, but John was having some trouble. Sherlock moved over to help him get out. His leg was clearly causing him pain, but he said nothing. He just accepted Sherlock’s help, avoiding his gaze.
“Soon enough,” Sherlock answered.
"And that intervention would be?" Sherlock asked.
“Of course,” he said breathily. “A commander!”
"What in the world is going on?" John asked, unable to look away.
“John!” Sherlock says urgently.
The voice was deep, gravely, and taunting. It made Sherlock’s skin crawl.
John rushed up to meet him. He didn’t see anything, but he trusted Sherlock’s eyes better than his own.
But John is struggling. He is experiencing pain upon pain upon pain. The glass cuts into his feet as he walks. His bad leg still causes him pain whenever he tries to walk on it. And there are several wounds John had to stitch up on his feet that are now likely being reopened. Still, John moves forward stoically, barely making a noise. Sherlock’s heart aches.
“He was smart,” he continued softly. “Not as smart and me, but smart enough. I thought… I felt…”
He has also gone back to therapy, as promised, though he had actually done reasonably well even without it. He still struggles with nightmares and sometimes has trouble taking care of himself (eating in particular), but not nearly as bad as after Grimes Graves. Sherlock attributes this to resiliency and will power.
"But... but it was where you said you would leave it," John glanced at the paper over Sherlock's shoulder.
"I wish you would get me before you do these kinds of things," Lestrade grumbled as he approached the scene.
"My leg?" John's brows furrowed in confusion. Sherlock said the scans hadn't shown he'd done any further damage. Why was he bringing up his leg? "It's fine. Why?"
"Well," he said, "I suppose you were right then."
“Brother, I really think…” Mycroft began.
"I have to go out," he said finally. "I'll find a simple spell and leave it for you by the fire. Try it while I'm gone."
Convincing John to let him help him back into the correct position took far longer than Sherlock would have liked. But he needed to move carefully. John was teetering on a hair's edge. His emotional state and his physical state colliding to create a perfect storm of pain and panic.
“No,” Lestrade repeated. “I’m not letting you go off alone right now.”
for you, John” he said finally, starting to pace in front of John. “I really
Sherlock thought he was going to be sick.
John moaned but didn’t scream this time. Good. That’s progress.
“Yes?” Sherlock said.
Sherlock felt dizzy. He looked back down at John. John was staring at him, grim-faced and determined.
“I’m not sure,” he said finally.
Without warning, the strange carriage took off, faster than John had ever experienced. He gasped, clutching the seat. In his peripheral vision, he saw Sherlock grin.
They had reached the greenhouse, which stood near the far eastern edge of the palace grounds, without being noticed by anybody. John strongly suspected Sherlock had used a spell of some sort. Every time they passed a person, the person's eyes would slide away from them, as though they had suddenly noticed something important in the opposite direction.
He sighed.
"No," he said, trying not to let the anger that was growing out of nowhere overwhelm him.
"Another miscalculation," Sherlock said, grinning. "One of the victims had a maid."
The fire seemed to shake with laughter.
“Grime’s Graves,” John shouted. “We need to catch him before he starts shooting at tourists.”
He untangled himself from the wire, pushed forward, and collapsed into the next room.
“John wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you Sherlock,” Moriarty continued. “But you already know that.”
"Sherlock!" John snapped. "Stop! Stop this!"
“John Watson,” the man called cheerfully.
“Yes,” Sherlock suddenly looked… shy? No, that couldn’t be. Ashamed? No, Sherlock was never ashamed. Embarrassed…?
Sherlock looked up at the nurse. He thought about shouting at her. He thought about ignoring her completely. He thought about going to his mind palace and trying to find answers there. He thought about calling Molly or Lestrade or even Mycroft for advice.
"We both know it will happen either way," Sherlock growled in frustration, pacing down a narrow street near the hospital and trying to keep his calm. "This way will be much less messy."
John watched the exchange, but did not interfere, afraid of scaring the woman off like an alley cat. Once it was over, Sherlock simply turned and headed inside. John glanced at the woman before following, but she had already begun to wander away.
"Fun? Somebody's dead," John looked up at Sherlock.
When they reach room five, Sherlock has to pause to catch his breath again. The bed is covered in John’s blood, still fresh and gleaming. The chains dangle from the legs of the bed. Sherlock runs a hand through his hair, trying to block the images of what happened here from invading his mind again. He needed a clear head. He had a job to do. Being sentimental wasn’t going to help John and his life was clearly in danger every moment these psychopaths were loose.
“I know,” John said, firmly. “But there’s a chance. It’s a long shot, but I think you can do it. I trust you Sherlock. Please.”
“Okay!” Sherlock took a deep breath, glanced once more at John’s determined face, and stepped up on his leg.
“I’ll just…” Lestrade looked from Sherlock to John, understanding that he was missing something that was apparently none of his business. With a curt nod at them both, he left the room.
. Sherlock thought through what he had just done. What had gone wrong? What was happening to John? Had he not wanted this after all?
“Fine,” he said finally. “What do you want?”
chance of taking proper care of the wounds otherwise, so he sighed and handed Sherlock the kit.
"You only touched one area of the leg?" he asked finally.
When he was not tending to these duties, however, John continued attempting to decipher the spell. He had made pages of notes, most of which he had almost immediately discarded, and had even attempted creating a potion based on his interpretation of the ingredients. It had produced nothing but a strangely smelling muck, which John had immediately thrown out.
He had never seen Sherlock look particularly guilty, though he had frequently had opportunities in which he should have done. In that moment, however, Sherlock looked wretched.
"Oh," Harry didn't seem to notice his tone at all, "you know each other?"
“It was a difficult decision,” John validated. “But you made the right choice.”
"Consent forms?" he asked, glancing down at the papers in a daze and then back up at the nurse.
“But why?” Lestrade asked.
"Yes sir," she said, leaning her hip against the table. "For Dr. Watson's treatment. The surgeons would like to get started right away sir, so if you wouldn't mind..."
The man struggled for a moment before growling with frustration and giving up.
“Oh yeah,” the voice laughed. “1, 2, 3…”
Sherlock looked confused. "Did I hurt it?"
"Mrs. Hudson," he prompted more urgently. "Are you okay? Please respond!"
"Sherlock," Mycroft's voice seemed to drip with condescension to Sherlock, "I'm not certain this is a good idea."
The creature turned toward him, giving Sherlock enough time the scramble off the ground to his feet.
“I was.. It happened…” John’s voice was trembling now.
"What do you recommend?" Sherlock asked, dreading the answer.
"Your doctor," he said slowly, "Dr. Azarian, couldn't contact Harry, so I... er... I had Mycroft list me as your next-of-kin. They asked me to give consent to.. to allow them to..."
“Good,” Sherlock encourages. “Now, what do you hear around you. Listen hard.”
He thought back to how the leg looked, lying splayed out in front of John, exposed with the blankets twisted up around him. From the knee down, the leg was covered in gauze and surrounded by metal, but above and below the gauze the skin was angry shades of purple and blue and brown interspersed with cuts and scrapes.
Sherlock took the hand on John’s cheek and moved it to John’s hair, taking a handful. John let out a breath into Sherlock’s mouth. He moved the hand on John’s neck down slowly. First, resting on John’s good shoulder, then moving to his chest, where he lingered for a moment, relishing the rise and fall of John’s quickened breaths.
Sherlock looked back down at the papers. He let his eyes flow over the words, but couldn't seem to process them.
"But, how will we know who to question?" John asked. "Without Detective Dimmock's help, all we have is the latest victim's information."
"What do people normally say?" John glanced back over.
John blinked. That didn't make sense. The voice was next to his ear, but Sherlock was...
"It was the nurse," he said, still standing still just beyond the bed. "She's gone now. You need to lie down. You're not breathing John."
Sherlock absolutely hated leaving John alone, especially right now, but he had no signal on his phone and he had to get them help as soon as possible. There was no other way. There was always the chance that the monster would come back, but Sherlock was fairly certain he had left them for good that night. He seemed to like playing games and he played by the rules.
“Sherlock?” John breathed.
John ignores him.
"Hurry," the stranger had already moved to the next building.
“John already knows how I feel,” he said toward the voice. “I value him…”
Then there were his wounds. His shoulder and his leg would certainly require surgery. Extensive surgery. The leg might have to be… If the damage or the infection were too severe…
“Hm,” Mycroft replied. “Have you asked John’s friends?”
“Yes,” Sherlock interjected. “
“Hurry John,” Sherlock insisted.
Sherlock’s head dropped. Half of him wanted to hit this idiot. The other half wanted to kiss him. He wasn’t sure which was winning.
Moriarty laughed.
Sherlock blinked at her. His eyebrows furrowed and he nodded, once.
John sighed, though it caused his chest to protest painfully.
Where would be the right place? Somewhere open, where the sky was easily seen and the stars were clear. The moors, perhaps. But how to be quick enough?
Suddenly, John begins carefully removing his shirt. Sherlock is confused. Why would he take away his only layer of protection? As he watches, however, his question is answered. John takes the shirt and rips it into long strips. Moving very carefully (though still getting cut in the process) he begins tying the strips around sensitive areas of his body—his neck, his wrists, his stomach.
There was a pause that seemed to last a lifetime.
John's eyes narrowed. He didn't know why Sherlock was harping on his leg. He wished he would get to the point. It didn't hurt. So what? Wasn't that a good thing? Considering how much trauma it had suffered and how much everything else on his bloody body ached, couldn't Sherlock just let him have this one small victory without bloody questioning it?
Sherlock hesitated. He felt as though he were being propelled by a restless energy that might destroy him if he remained still too long. But, he also felt the urge to talk--to purge all the words he hadn't been able to say over the last few days.
A dog ran up to them and bounced happily into Harry's lap. It was a small, fluffy white dog with perky ears and it looked absolutely enamored with his sister.
“Damn,” Sherlock groaned. “Damnit John, stay with me!”
“And that is?” John asked, his face blank.
"I don't understand," he finally blurted out.
“He’s lost 6 pounds in two weeks,” Sherlock finished.
“Well, that won’t be happening,” Sherlock said.
Moriarty looked down at John.
John let his head fall into his hand.
"What?" John glanced around him, trying to figure out what Sherlock was talking about.
Sherlock glared behind him in the direction of the house, but John knew the witch was gone.
"Piss off," Sherlock finally turned to meet his eyes.
Suddenly there was a face directly in front of his. He started, but the man standing so close did not attack. Instead, he stared at John, directly into his eyes with the most intense expression John had ever seen.
“Move Sherlock,” the voice said. “I won’t ask again.”
They were in the carriage and moving before John had truly processed what had happened.
"Oh, that's rather optimistic," Irene glanced down at her nails. "By the way, where is that lovely Sherlock?"
"Perhaps you would do better finding what you're looking for at an inn?" John spat. "I'm closed anyway."
Panic.
Sherlock hesitated again.
“The nerve damage,” Sherlock prompted. “Will John have control over his lower body? His eliminatory functions? His reproductive organs? Will he be able to walk?”
"How do they feel," Sherlock asked, the volume of his voice normal for the first time since John had awoken.
"Idiot," Sherlock barked.
“I think I’ll go easy on you then, Dr. Watson,” Scarecrow said.
“Why not?” Sherlock shot back.
The street was paved with some sort of black rock, rather than bricks and there were strange, large machines sitting in front of many of the houses. He looked behind to find the door he had just left and saw a black door with a small knocker and letters indicating what he assumed was an address--221.
"John," Harry smiled happily, not noticing John's distress, "I'd like to introduce you to Irene."
"I don't give a shit about Detective Lestrade," Detective Dimmock was becoming more agitated. "I am not letting you anywhere near this case."
Sherlock glanced at him, then back at Amelia, who was shifting her weight and still glancing nervously around.
Sherlock stood and walked away a few paces.
John stared. "Sherlock?"
"I thought you weren't my housekeeper," a deep and somehow familiar voice startled John so much that he almost dropped the pan.
Beside the equipment, he found a book titled
“Of course,” John laughed. “Of course you asked Molly Hooper. And she told you to get tickets to the theatre.”
, Sherlock thought rather tetchily.
"John!" Harry shot out of the cottage's front door like she was running from something. "Oh John! You came!"
He flipped the page and began reading about his leg. He found that the surgeons had left the incision open between the first and second surgeries in an effort to prevent infection, inserting antibiotic beads and covering the area in plastic. It must have looked horrific. He was rather glad he had be unconscious for the ordeal.
"I can feel it," Sherlock whispered, "I'm using a location spell. It isn't precise, but..."
"It can hurt quite a bit," Detective Dimmock growled. "Anyway, the man died two days ago. Our examiner has already performed the autopsy and the man is waiting to be buried. There is no way to see him now."
“Got him,” Sherlock said suddenly, standing up from the microscope with an expression of triumph.
“Sherlock, you’ve been pacing for hours,” Lestrade said, exasperation clear in his voice. “You need to go get rest. There’s no telling how long this will take. John won’t even know you aren’t here.”
"John," he said, keeping his voice as neutral as he could manage, "I simply thought you might want to take some time to consider.."
"I'm hunting a witch," John said flatly.
John stared at her with equal parts amazement and annoyance. She had dark hair carefully pinned up behind an sharp face. Her light eyes seemed to radiate authority and mischief. John found himself more annoyed that he had been all day.
"What did you..." but before he could finish, a sharp pain in his shoulder and leg took all thought of the witch from his mind.
John found two mismatched bowls and scooped the oats into them, looking around for spoons. Once he had found them, he moved back to the main room and sat the bowl in front of Sherlock, who glanced at it and then ignored it completely.
"And," Bryan continued slowly,"well, I've never seen him with a woman before, but they looked really close. Like, romantically close."
Before Lestrade could move a step closer to him, however, a shot rang out and Jacol fell forward, blood gushing from his chest.
round, you win and I’ll allow you both to leave and get medical attention without interference.”
In the end, John has four numbers scribbled on a piece of paper and four teeth sitting on the table in front of him. His entire chest is not covered in blood again and John cannot move his jaw anymore. Sherlock is worried he may have broken it. He almost certainly will need dental surgery when they escaped.
