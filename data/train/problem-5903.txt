As it turned out, he was able to get Jamie, and she promptly fell asleep against his chest a few hours into their excursion. Tony was leaning back in the booth of the diner Steve picked, fingers rubbing circles on Jamie's back as she slept. Steve had fed her while Tony ate his food, then when Tony took her to burp her, Steve was able to eat his food, and she had fallen asleep soon after.
"Alright, we should see if we can't figure out this carrying method, huh? What did Mary call it? A moby wrap?" He looked down at Jamie. "We should probably go to her for help....."
"I assume you've got Jarvis on full surveillance downstairs?" Steve asked, leaning his side against the couch. Tony could see that Steve was starting to look tired, too. Everyone was looking tired. They just need a break.
There was a pause before she got the answer that she thought she might get. "I'm afraid that I am unable to share that information." Mary nodded, heading for the stair access door. "But, I believe that perhaps Dr Banner could." She stopped, then smiled a little. "He is currently in possession of his Starkphone."
"No, I'm not," Tony shook his head. "You raise him, you do everything with him, and for him, and I just show up to reap the rewards. He's going to grow up thinking I'm the fun parent, or he's going to think of me as the absent parent." Mary tilted her head a little, watching Tony. This was a completely different man. "I show up a few times a month. Three out of thirty days, that's just sad, Mary."
“She’s trying to work out why she can’t get to what she wants,” Peter said, looking over at them. “She’ll keep working at it until she figures out the problem.”
Also, I cannot stress enough, that I am NOT in any way a mental health expert. There are many resources available, and I urge that if anyone feels the need to talk to anyone, or seek anything to do so. It's very important to take care of yourself, mentally and physically. I love you all. <3
Blue eyes closed, and he took a deep breath. "Not exactly you're assassin anymore." He opened his eyes to see Tony just watching him, expression blank. "It's, really complicated, and I don't know many details, not yet anyway."
"Are you trying to tell me that Tony Stark is hacking into your music?" Steve looked up to see Meg's face. "Is he doing it to all Starkphones?"
“I did what you asked, Mr Stark,” she said sweetly. “I had the mansion freshened up, and the refrigerator stocked for a couple of days.”
“Not with all the sugar that you’re about to be responsible for pumping into their bodies,” Tony replied with a smile. “The candles are lit, let’s go give our daughter her first birthday cake.” Steve bit his bottom lip, looking down at the Sleeping Beauty themed cake, and walking out to the living room. Bucky was holding onto Jamie, sitting on the floor with Meg’s twins in front of him. Peter and Wade were perched on the couch, each practically hanging over Bucky’s shoulders. Steve smiled at seeing Bucky there this time, and to see the kids so happy.
Tony suddenly grabbed Steve's hands. "I'm going to send you to art school, for whatever classes you want. I'll make you a school to teach at, if you want. Make you a studio to work in, and we'll get your stuff into Galleries all over the world. Whatever you want to do, whatever you want to try. You and Meg, cause you're both artistic types. Just, whatever you want to do, so you don't have to keep doing shit like this, and-" Tony stopped as Steve cupped Tony's cheek, pressing against the warm skin.
"Daddy, wake up." Steve turned when heard Peter's soft voice. He knelt down, slipping his cowl back, looking at Tony as Peter was pushing his shoulder, trying to get him to wake up. Tony's eyes were fluttering, closed still, and his fingers were twitching with movement. "Wake up, wake up, wake up," Peter cried, pushing Tony's shoulder harder.
The door hissed back open and Tony's head shot up. Another scientist walked in behind Strucker, holding onto a clear container with white cloth inside. He put it on the lab counter before leaving.
“Just like Captain America would, right?” Tony nodded at his Aunt’s words. “Well, I can’t think of anyone better suited to take care of Evelyn than yourself. Is that something you could agree with, Evelyn?” Peggy looked down at the Eevee, smiling. Vee chirruped, bouncing on her back legs this time in excitement. Tony smiled at her and opened his arms, going to lean down to pick her up. He didn’t get very far before she jumped into his arms, licking his cheek as he held onto her. “Yes, I think that Steve would be very proud to have you looking after her.” She picked up the dropped pokeball, closing it before tucking it into his back pocket. “Why don’t you head inside, show Evelyn your room, and the house?”
"You told me to low," Tony pointed at him. It counted as laying low by not taking Peter outside, right? "That's what I've been doing. I lay low and you take care of all-"
Tony started shaking his head. "Not here, we can talk about the mean and nasty stuff they did later. Not here." Natasha helped him back up into his seat before heading back to the cockpit. Steve had shifted and wrapped an arm around Tony's shoulders, pulling him in and kissing his head. Steve's arm was doing its best to tuck him against Steve's body, and Tony found his face closer to the still awake baby in Steve's other arm. They locked eyes and suddenly she was moving her hand forward and patting Tony's nose twice. "She's going to be just like you, Rogers."
"Oh. Oh!" She had put together that he was Captain America. "Where's Tony? I need to try and stay on top of, a situation."
"I'd expect nothing less," she nodded. Her eyes went to Peter, then back to Tony. "He looks like you."
"Not in the least," Coulson said, giving her a smile. "We'll still have time to meet up with Tony and Peter. But this also relates to your next assignment." He used his card, sliding it over a panel and the steel door unlocked. He pulled it open, pausing to let Mary go through first. She stepped in and saw a large window across from them, several SHIELD scientists in the room, gathered around something on a table, and a slew of machines in the room.
“I was making sure that no one else was watching,” he grumbled. “Plus, wasn’t sure how everyone else would take it to see me standing awkwardly on school property.”
"Daddy! Daddy!" Tony grunted, opening his eyes. Peter grinned at him, pushing his shoulder. "Wake up! We gotta get Mama! It's Kissmas!" Tony grabbed Peter and started to tickle his sides, making the boy squeal with laughter.
“You’re not supposed to blush,” Peter said to Steve and giggled. “That’s your Princess!” That made the woman laugh herself, staying in character.
"They said that you two should be together," the little boy said easily, leaning against Steve now. Tony got a cocky grin on his face, one that only grew larger when Rachel shot him a glare. "You two are happy when you do stuff together, and I like doing stuff with both of you."
"Yeah, but when he's done with work, he'll come back here," Peter responded. Tony was usually impressed with the fact that Peter had started developing logical reasoning at such an early age. Until it came to his love life. "Like Phil would come back and see Mama when he came home from work. Mama and Granma were right." Steve and Tony looked at each other, then looked over at the two women in question.
Steve laughed. "I don't think so, mister. I think you owe me a turn now." Steve twirled his finger, looking at Tony. He wanted to play this game? Oh, Tony could play with the best of them. He had been born and bred to strut his stuff. Tony put his free hand in his pocket, fisting his hand so the fabric drew a little tighter around his body. His steps were deliberate as he turned, making his posture as straight as could be, pushing his hips back a little.
"We gotta let them cool down first," Steve said, smiling at Peter. "Or else the frosting will just slide right off, it'll start to melt." Peter nodded, watching the cupcakes, smiling.
“Oh, uh, still non-lethal. Um, just, incapacitate him.” She looked at Steve and Tony. Tony shrugged but nodded a little. Tony pulled out his phone with one hand, tapping something out. “We’re trying to keep Julie and Wade safe.”
“Papa.” She said firmly and Steve looked down at her. “No.” Tony’s shoulders were bunching up as he looked like he was about to melt from the cuteness of it all, and shake apart from the laughter that he was trying to keep in. Jamie settled her head back on his shoulder, and wiggled to get comfortable again.
"That's very generous, Tony," Steve said to him with a smile. This was probably something small to Tony Stark and his bank account, even the action probably something he wouldn't remember a couple years from now, but 'small' stuff like that impressed Steve. Tony was one person to the press and the public, but he was completely different in his private life, and Steve liked getting to know that person.
"Sounds like a pretty close friend," Bruce commented, walking around the workshop again, headed towards Tony's computers. "Like a female Rhodey. How is Rhodey?"
“The burger turned into grey sludge!” Bucky argued, looking back at her. “It almost put me off burgers!”
Tony quickly turned around again. He gasped when a hand grabbed the back of his neck, throwing him forward, plunging his head in water. He tried to hold his breath, but he had had too little warning. Water made its way into his mouth, down his throat, and he tried to stop, but he started coughing, more water shooting down his throat, quickly losing his remaining oxygen.
"Mr Steve!" Peter called out from the living room. "Get your rear in gear!" He heard Peter's giggles as he finished the line, and shook his head fondly. Tony must have fed him that line. Steve could see himself with a family, little by little. Maybe it was the odd family atmosphere that Tony and Mary worked so hard to cultivate for Peter. Steve was fairly positive that this wasn't normal for the everyday American family of the Twenty-First century, and maybe that's why he could feel at ease here. Not completely, he still needed to be doing something, moving, in action, but the anxiety inside wasn't as bad now as it had been back at the first apartment.
"I said I have two left feet," Steve told her, grinning. "And if you'll notice, I'm not really moving that much." It was true, he was just moving side to side, occasionally spinning her in his hand. Mary grinned and pulled him back in a spin towards her, making his eyes go wide at the change up. He stumbled a little, but somehow managed to get his footing back. "I think it took more time memorizing those lines than it did to learn a few simple steps."
"Hey, Petey." Tony stood up, lifting Peter up in his arms with him. He suppressed a shiver when Peter's hands found his arc reactor.
“Yes, Buckster?” Tony grinned. He felt Steve coming up behind him, an arm almost snaking around his waist from behind, but Tony was pivoting and turning so Steve met only air. Now Bucky was raising his eyebrows at Steve. “Cap here is grounded until he gets all his chores done.”
The hands went to leave, his gasp an unexpected reaction, but Tony's hands darted to grab Steve's wrists. "No," he whispered, voice a bit deeper, huskier. He licked his lips and looked into Steve's eyes, blue almost gone as desire traveled through Steve's system. Tony didn't need to say anything else as Steve's hands pressed back down against his skin.
Tony reached inside his jacket and pulled out an envelope. Opening it, he slid some papers out, straightened them, and slid them over to Julie for her too look over. "You know that the hospital sends me reports of your treatment. I'm a stickler like that, want to make sure that you're getting the right treatment." She nodded, frowning a little as she leaned in to read the papers. "This was, just an idea that I had. You can completely reject it, shred the papers, do whatever you want, but, I thought it would be something worth looking at."
"I have Peter," Coulson reassured him immediately. "He's safe, I'm not going to let him out of my sight." Tony closed his eyes a little, letting out a breath of relief. “But, we need that engine running again."
He came through the door to his own floor, the lights dimmed, but not off, waiting for his arrival. The kids would be asleep, Tony would have made sure of that as soon as Steve let him know that they were going to be getting back late from their mission. The light from their bedroom was still on and he slipped in to see Tony sitting up in bed with a tablet in his hands. He was working on some idea, but looked up and smiled when he saw Steve come in the room. He put the tablet on the bedside table.
“Listen, the Mother of Dragons is amazing, and if no one is using the nickname Dany when they have the chance, they’re nuts.” Tony nodded, his fingers tapping on the arm of the couch. “She’s going to go nuts, I’m calling it, but she’s still pretty amazing.”
"Not from this fight," Tony told him. "This is from the arc reactor." As he said it, Peter put his hand over Tony's chest. "But, that's why Uncle Bruce is here, he's helping Daddy get rid of it, so you don't have to worry about it at all, okay?" Peter nodded. "Alright, let's go see this special room, yeah?" Peter nodded, still holding onto Tony. "I really think you're going to like it."
"Okay, so, I know it looks ridiculous, but those are codes for you. Like you're own personal set of codes, and they're override codes, and they'll be voice matched later." Tony had immediately launched into the rambling spiel, his nerves spurning him on. "And they're codes for just about everything. The first one is for the workshop, and only Pepper has another code for that. Mary has heightened privileges to the workshop, but not an override code. The second one is a code for the garage and all the cars and bikes down there, and then there's a code for Jarvis, which only is used in extreme cases. Then there's a code for, well, the Tower, in general, and of course a code for SI...."
“I’m not wearing a shirt,” Steve hissed at Tony, who was now grinning. “I can Not go out there without a shirt. It’s not proper.”
"Me," Tony growled before lowering his shoulder and charging into Loki, slamming his weight into Loki's middle. It was enough to catch the man by surprise, making his drop his grip on Peter. "Run!" Tony said to his son before Loki grabbed his arm and flung him across the room. Tony grunted as he slammed into the couch, hearing the wood crack, and rolling over it.
"I will indeed, if Sir does not find you himself." The doors opened and Steve stepped down the hallway to the Wilson's apartment, not needing to knock as Julie had left the door open. Steve would have thought it a security risk, but no one other than the Avengers or other private living area residents would have access to this floor.
"Yeah, she's pretty awesome." Wade nodded, then flopped back on the bed as well in an impressive spin. He tucked his hands behind his head.
“It’s a video game,” Tony explained, pulling out his phone and Jarvis was helpfully pulling up a picture. “Technically, he gets points, because it does include Disney characters.” Peter beamed. “That’s my son,” Tony said fondly. “I’ll get drinks, you three get settled. We’ve gotta watch
"Okay, say it again," Yinsen prompted Tony as he suited up. They checked the gloves, the jacket, before bolting on the chest and arm pieces.
“Oh, I’m sure.” Tony pushed Steve’s shoulder. “And what kind of ice cream should I be getting? Perhaps Moose Tracks? Or Butter Pecan?” Steve just smiled and kissed Tony again before turning back towards his desk. “Ah ha, I see how it is. This ice cream probably won’t even make it to the party. That’s fine, you’ve been breaking into my stash, and I need to refill it anyway. Hey, where is the ice cream in a grocery store anyway?”
“Oh, the Turducken,” Steve said gravely with one nod. Bucky looked at Steve like he was barely clinging on to hope. “I’m going to have to agree with them, Buck.”
"Yeah, I got it," Tony nodded, gently pulling away from Steve. "I've got stuff in the workshop." He turned and practically jogged away, heading for the door downstairs, leaving Steve in the hallway.
"You gotta do what you gotta do, Cap," Tony shrugged a little, hands in his pockets. "You can't ignore a beauty like that, she's gotta see the country, you know." Steve glanced back at the bike. "Seriously, who knows when the next time you'll be able to do this will be. You're still practically unknown to the outside world, better take advantage of that while you still can."
Turns out, the Hulk had done what Steve and Tony, and the others, had wanted to do. They found him crawling out of a little crater in the floor, before turning around to face them. Tony caught Loki's eye for a second. Thor grabbed Loki, Romanoff and Barton following, an arrow pointed at him at all times, as they went to secure him while waiting for a SHIELD team to come from the New York building. Tony was already working on the manual releases of the suit, choosing not to say anything when Steve stepped up to help pull the bigger pieces off. Tony was moving as he tried to pull the boots off, heading for the elevator.
"At ease," she told him, standing her ground, moving an inch to the right as he had moved to his left. "This is the SHIELD, specifically, the SSR." That got him to stop moving, his eyes glancing around, probably looking for proof. She kept one hand up to him, showing it was empty, and reached inside her jacket with her other hand to pull out her badge. She opened it, holding it out to let him examine it. "My name is Mary Parker, Senior Agent, working for SHIELD, formerly of the FBI. You can call to verify if you'd like."
Peter turned his head back around and looked up at Tony. "I'll help if you can talk Wade's Mom to moving in here." Both Peter and Wade crossed their arms over their chests, as if they were making a final offer to a deal. Jamie was reaching her arms a little, then bringing them in to her chest, almost as if she wanted to mimic the movement.
"Yeah," he said quietly. He cleared his throat before talking again. "Pepper is gone, by the way. To see her family, not gone gone, just off for the holidays." He knew he was starting to ramble again, but it was an old fall back that he was used to, and it worked for him. "She almost didn't go, wondering how I was going to actually survive without her, and I had to promise that I would call if I needed her, or that I would call Rhodey."
"I don't think that's going to be very difficult for you," Rhodey said, closing the fridge doors to face Tony, a little smile on his face. "Seeing the way that kid is in love with you?" Tony preened a little at the compliment, and the fact. "And how you didn't flinch at the word, Daddy."
"And if he doesn't want to go into science, or anything else like it?" The military man asked, moving the bed around on the screen. Tony wrinkled up his face a little, but didn't undo what Rhodey had done. "What if he wants to be an artist? Or a chef?"
"True facts, my young friend. Alright, so who am I then? What color lightsaber do I get?" Tony rubbed his hands together. Jamie had been watching him, and she looked at Steve, clapping her hands together once, and trying to imitate Tony. Steve took her hand and rubbed them together a little to make her giggle.
After last night, George had agreed to a second date with Tony for next week. It was weird, because Tony hadn't even gone back to his place afterwards, there was no make out session, and he wasn't drunk. If this was how normal people dated, Tony had a lot to get used too.
Steve looked at the phone, seeing a logo on the back of it, and tilted his head. He swore he had seen that logo before in passing while browsing online, but didn't really think about it too much. There was a possibility that Tony would be just across the hall now.
"Awww, Peter and Wade aren't hooligans," she cooed and Tony saw her toss something to the boys. They immediately grinned as Wade grabbed it before Tony could see what it was, and handed part of it to Peter. "They're very energetic boys, that's all."
Tony carded his hands through Peter's hair a few times before he leaned over to drop a kiss on the top of his head, and get up from the bed. Mary looked at him, but he just gave her a soft smile. "I'm gonna go tell Agent, and I'm gonna give your parents some time here." He turned to head out, catching both eyes from the Fitzpatrick's. Rachel nodded to him before walking over to the bed and to her daughter, and William put a hand on Tony's arm, for just a second. Tony didn't say anything but left the room a moment later, closing the door most of the way before his feet propelled him down the hall.
"Duh!" Wade rolled his eyes a little. "The ride has to be really amazing if it almost makes you barf!" Steve's eyes flickered to Peter who was nodding in agreement.
Unlike Tony, Steve wasn’t concerned with the way that the door opened on its own as he practically ran up the steps. He was concerned when it wasn’t Strange that was waiting for him, but Loki. The same one that they all believed to be dead. He was reaching for his shield on his back even as Loki raised his hands.
"And what exactly are you going to do when they move?" She pursed her lips a little. "Are you going to stay here, and-"
"Um, I'm not actually sure," Steve said carefully. He had fun, and he hadn't made it to the other side of the country yet, but he forgot how much fun it could be here as well. "Why?"
"Kids are fascinated with the miracle of life." She waved a hand around her stomach. "I told them if they got their homework done first, they could feel the babies kick, and play any kind of music they wanted for them."
"Guiding the future, Cap, that's what SI does." Tony neatly put Peter's clothes together, switching drawers now. "Then I had my own workshop, then a couple of floors for guests, and the like. Fifteen other floors would be available for rent for other business. Prime location space for just about anything, and with a spectacular energy incentive."
"Why are you happy about it, Peter?" Steve asked, leaning back a little so Peter could look back and forth between them.
Steve watched Peter as he showed him how to make a folder on the desktop for all his images that he kept downloading. Steve tried not to think about how a five-year-old was showing how to use a computer. There was a knock at the door, and Steve got up, ruffling Peter's hair, and went over, looking through the peephole. He blinked seeing a man with a familiar Captain America ball cap a goatee, and sunglasses on. Tony.
"I think I'll take this." Clint had stolen the little boy, holding him up over his arms, and took off running to the other side of the large dining table. Peter squealed in delight, putting his arms out like a bird. Clint put him down in a chair and turned a grin over to Tony and Steve. "He's like a little bird."
Tony turned over the Asgardian metal carefully, and winced a little when he saw what looked to be little metal burrs on the inside. They looked like they would be painful. "Why does it feel like they made this specifically for you Prancer?" Maybe it he could antagonize Loki a little, it would buy them the few extra minutes they would need. "Legends call you Silvertongue, right?" Loki turned his glare to Tony now. "Have they used it on you before? Just how much does it hurt?"
“That didn’t sound like one of your usual songs, at least nothing I’ve heard down in the workshop,” Steve continued. The song was something he could focus on instead of his nightmare, instead of feeling like he let everyone important in his life down. Tony didn’t think that, Tony was still here, still loved him. He would protect Tony with his life. “But I have heard it.”
"You came back," Peter said this time. "You came back for my birfday. Mama said you wouldn't miss it."
“I’m not at will to really care about that, now am I?” She smiled at him. Steve watched the back and forth going on, not really ever being able witness to the infamous Stark and Potts relationship in person. “Not when a lovely video, starting to go viral, of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker having a light saber fight in the middle of Disneyland taking up most of my time.” Steve looked down, biting his lip, while Tony didn’t look the least bit ashamed.
“I agree!” Steve said with shit-eating grin aimed at Tony. “I’ll of course take all the pictures.” Peter was too happy to notice the way that Tony was promising revenge with his eyes, and Steve just didn’t care. “Peter just has all the best ideas today.”
“Betrayed!” Tony wailed, making the boys giggle a little, which made Jamie giggle. “I’ve been betrayed!” Steve leaned his head in to whisper in Peter’s ear. Tony yelped and started to wiggle away when Peter started to tickle the back of his neck. “Betrayal!” He laughed and Wade actually cackled before joining in to help Peter. Jamie was pushing herself up, and Steve wrapped an arm around her waist before tickling her secret spot, making her squeal with laughter.
"I've always been on Team Steve," Natasha said. "I've worked with him before, and I only spied on you." Tony gave her a little sneer. "But, with what I know about both of you, you'd work well together. You two would never be bored, that's for sure." She looked at him and shrugged a little, before turning on her heal and walking out. Tony sighed and looked back at Mary.
"Maybe you used to be an alcoholic, but you can control yourself around Peter," Steve started to refute.
"Nah," Tony shook his head. "You didn't hand them to me, you held them up, and then I reached over to take it. Completely different stuff." Steve wrinkled his brow a little. "Big difference, trust me.
"Okay, before I ask work related questions," Mary started, turning towards Coulson, "I have to ask. How excited are you?" She got a surprised smile when she was sure that that Coulson just let out a little squeak. "Why do all my boys like Captain America?" She shook her head fondly.
They walked out into the living room, Peter already setting up the TV, using one of Tony’s tablets to hack in and choose the movie. “You know, babe, we have to come with someone for Peter.”
Tony couldn't help but smile against Steve's lips when he was pressing back against Tony, taking back control of the kiss, a slight growl in his throat. He never would have thought that one gift would make him so happy at Christmas, but it was becoming harder to ignore how much Steve was starting to mean to him. His last relationship, that had actually lasted longer than a month, had moved much quicker, but he hadn't felt near as strongly for them as he was feeling for Steve. He almost didn't care that they hadn't had sex yet.
“Come on Tony.” He starts thrusting harder, pushing Tony’s legs up to his shoulders, trying to hit a deeper spot. It works, and Tony pants, loud and wanton.
“It’s just, whatever this alien did to me, it has me crazy horny. It’ll pass, but… it’s so hard to concentrate on anything but—but you.” Tony scrunches his arms to his side and cants his hips back a little bit, just to give his cock some much-needed breathing room before he spills over the floor like a pathetic teenager.
It must be that Bucky was waiting for a ‘yes,’ because the next second Tony is pinned to the hallway wall, his back facing Bucky as the other man pumps his finger in and out of Tony’s grasping ass.
“I’m in the military, it counts. And shouldn’t breakups, even not-breakups, be done in public anyway?” Pepper smiled, the sad moment pierced by Rhodey’s brisk humor. He was so thankful for the both of them. No, he didn’t get what he wanted, but he didn’t lose them. Either of them.
“Just come to us when you need to, Tony. Can you promise me that?” Rhodey tries to be so gentle, he does, but it comes out fraught with desperation, with the sick knowledge between them that there isn’t a Tony without Steve. That if Steve doesn’t come back, Tony is never coming back.
Steve would never do that to Tony completely, but he realized he had made it impossible for Tony to make his own decisions financially. It had never made more sense than when he realized that omegas need a way to get out, always.
He wakes up at six and goes for a quick run, something he hasn’t done all week. He tries hard not to check on Tony, but he gives in and goes down to the workshop to peer through the window and see the omega still working in the same outfit as last night. Steve doesn’t think he’s gone to sleep, and the idea is aggravating, but he remembers what the medical personnel said and doesn’t interrupt.
“Sit! Sit! That lovely girl told me you’d be coming. She’s getting me a hot chocolate. Do you know how long it’s been since I’ve had one? It’ll be heck on my tummy, all that sugar, but a gal’s gotta live a little.” She has a strong Brooklyn accent, and Steve can’t help but smile at her. Her scent is that sourness that all the elderly have, but with his superior sense of smell, he can tell she’s omega.
“Clint is a better operative than you will ever be. You’re flashy, destructive, and generally anti-authority. We could live without you. Don’t think we need you for a second. Tomorrow, 0800 hours, SHIELD, same room.”
“So you’re going to do right by Tony?” Natasha asks then. She’s sitting next to him within arm’s reach.
“You have to let me go, Bucky. Please.” He starts crawling backwards along the wall, trying to put distance between Bucky and himself.
“Tony?” Oh no. Tony’s wings ruffle and the tips of them shoot out and upward in some kind of display towards Steve, whose eyes are locked onto Tony’s feathers, his cheeks pinkening.
grabbing Tony’s hair and pulling his head back as he treats Tony’s throat to a buffet of nips and wet kisses. He focuses on keeping Tony upright with effortless strength while panting into his neck, teeth bared and denting his skin ever so slightly. Like a blooming flower, Tony opens for him, letting Steve trail up to his mouth.
It’s then that Tony realizes he’s in the lordosis pose. Somewhere along the line, his knees had come up, hips tilted to present to Steve. He wonders if he’s soaked through his jeans. He hopes he has, and that Steve can smell it on him, how much he wants the Alpha. How good he’ll be for him.
stock market investments. He needs to take back everything he said to Tony in the beginning. Does Tony even know how much Steve wants him now? It’s all he thinks about.
Things have changed so much. He can’t believe she talks back to her alpha like that and it’s all a joke to them. He doesn’t know what to think of their relationship, although they seem happy, standing there together with her head leaned on her alpha’s shoulder. Is she what Natasha would define as a successful omega?
They pull to the curb, and it takes Tony by surprise to look out his window and see Steve’s old apartment building.
The burning is turning into dull throbbing, and he knows he’s bleeding now. Steve wouldn’t be moving so smoothly otherwise.
“Iron Man, we got him, just like you said.” Which is perfect, because he’s got the attention of the flying whale again, the creature rippling madly through the air behind him, shredding cars and anything in its path to get to Tony.
“I don’t need you, but I want you. I always have. The other Captain America’s memories exist in my mind, he admired you. So do I. It’d be a crying shame to have to kill you rather than have you at my side.” He gets even closer, until he can see the pores on Tony’s face, the individual hairs of his beard slicked all one direction, immaculately groomed. Steve has always admired the fine length of Tony’s face, his diamond-cut jaw, the almost widow’s peak of his forehead. His dark mirror in every way that matters.
“So how’d you get down here?” He tries to sound casual, but the reason he zoomed off on his own was so that the Captain wouldn’t show up and give Tony an opportunity to out himself. Tony is really trying here, but he’s never had to be two people or do much of anything to protect his identity. SHIELD knew, but they wouldn’t outright tell the Avengers team. Tony knew that much at least.
“What’s wrong now? Don't tell me you did something to Stark you shouldn’t have. Fucking damnit didn’t we go through this?”
“You kidding? My alpha owes me his life. I was working the job for years before he got the privilege of biting into this. I own his ass. And he loves it. He’s lucky to have me and he knows it.” Clint is all but crowing about his alpha, a fervor shining in his eyes as he talks about the man. Nat is still a brick wall, but he can see she’s listening attentively.
His new life after his body was altered had been one of relative ease and achieved expectations. Steve had never been the kind of omega who wanted flashy things and an alpha’s knot. He’d never been interested in the slightest, and nor was he capable of heats when he was young, so he’d never gotten married. It was further affirmation that his body now was as it should be.
Then Tony sleeps again, and Steve is left alone with his thoughts. He thinks on how badly he misjudged Tony’s level of promiscuity. He’d never even taken an alpha’s cock before now, and Tony willingly ceded that to Steve. Tony is so beautiful and sweet like this, needing him and presenting for Steve. He’s afraid of what happens after, though he holds out hope that Tony sees how much Steve has changed and is willing to give him an opportunity.
“I think you know.” Tony’s voice was low. Steve choked, turned around and pressed his forehead against a smooth piece of concrete, still gripping his face. He looked so good like that, muscles defined by the suit Tony had designed for him. Maybe subtly he’d always been more omega than he thought.
“Okay, okay I’m sorry. I can feel you staring at me through the phone. Hopefully undressing me with your eyes, although maybe not.” Tony cringed as he lifted a hand off of a Camloc Drill Jig, dropping several screws that had plastered to his arm in the process. He was going to be stomping on tiny pieces of metal for days. Unless… an air-core magnet attached to Dum-E could do the trick. It was overkill compared to an electromagnet, but he didn’t want to deal with frequency-dependent loss when he could simply circumvent it. To build it small enough, he’d have to—
“I suggest talking to him and asking him what he needs from you and seeing where you can compromise further. Really ask yourself what you need from Tony, personally, as his husband. Otherwise, I’d like you to pray the rosary.”
“Whatever I need? I do like the sound of that. Ok, model your suit for me. We can deal with this stuff in a bit.”
It’s late, and Tony is alone on the couch, drinking. Thinking about Bucky. About Steve. He knows that Steve hasn’t really shown any interest, but there’s something that holds him back from thinking he can give his all to Bucky, if he’s even considering that. He knows it has something to do with whatever they’re fighting about, but it’s not his
“If someone had asked me to bet on you, I would have bet against you. But something is different about you this past week. I don’t think it’s going to be a perfect journey, a perfect change, but you have done more than I expected.”
He sighs as he feels the head of the man’s cock rest against his hole, and braces himself for impact. It’s been a long time since he’s had to talk himself into a good headspace. Nowadays he just thinks of the repairs he’s working on and how they’re almost, almost going home.
“Then take me, and empty me of every hurt you’ve ever done to me and fill me with something better.” Tony pulls away the barest amount, letting his lips brush over Steve’s cheek as he tells Steve what he wants in a soft whisper of demand. That’s all Steve wants, but he just doesn’t know
“That’s it babe, take my knot, fuck—” It undulates through Bucky, his orgasm reverberating back to Tony as he starts to come once more, cum oozing out of the slit of his cock this time, creating tiny little puddles on his belly that drip down his sides as Bucky rides Tony to his own completion.
“Lead the way.” Steve still feels like he’s trespassing here. Something about the way everyone is holding themselves around him makes him wary, but not as wary as they look in return.
“Already on it sir.” The whoosh of the movement barely distracts him from Tony’s pleading. It’s agonizing listening to him disintegrate into a puddle of ‘please’ and tears. Steve never should have left Tony’s floor. He should have stayed. What was he thinking? Everything tonight has moved too quickly for his mind to process. The confrontation, Tony’s acceptance and his final pill. Steve hadn’t counted on the heat being so immediate in its need for satisfaction.
“Don’t make me do this, please Steve. I’ll do anything. I’ll leave the team, pay for anything you want. For SHIELD. The team, they won’t let this happen, Fury won’t, and Pepper, fuck, Steve, god, why? Why me? I’m not made for this.”
It continues like this for days, until Tony’s body is covered in bruises and his gland inflamed and red from how much Steve is sucking at it. Steve manages to keep Tony’s energy up by feeding him, giving him water and juice, and bathing him when necessary. He often licks at Tony’s battered hole to impart the pain-dulling qualities of his saliva, which is more a privilege than a chore.
Maria Hill rockets down from the Helicarrier, and along with her, Captain America. The fancy Captain America now, all fixed, shiny and new. Tony is
Steve can’t imagine an alpha that would allow Clint to do this, much less encourage the smart mouth that Clint has. Unbelievable. If he didn’t think that Fury would come after him worse than before, he’d recommend that Clint be taken off the team. It feels impossible to reconcile as he steals glances at Clint, who is staring him down, that this man is a shoo-in for the Avengers Initiative.
Steve does, jamming his fingers in and pressing down on a spot he’s found that makes Tony gasp and moan. Tony clenches around his fingers, and Steve wishes, how he wishes, it was his cock.
“I’m going to need you inside me. Take me over to the couch and fuck me until all I can think of is you.” The words tremble through Steve, and he shivers all over before standing up and looping an arm around Tony’s legs and middle, sweeping him into a bridal carry. The couch isn’t far, and he carefully tilts Tony onto it, the omega falling to the cushions on his hands and knees with his legs spread, a thick film of fluid coating his supple cheeks.
Steve takes the opportunity to suck at his neck before soothing it with a soft lick. Like a bloodhound, he goes straight for Tony’s glands, lapping at the scent producing organ where a mating bite would penetrate.
“Please don’t validate my idiot mutant child’s name. I’m working on keeping his self-esteem at acceptable levels.” He lets his mask bleed away as he flies up to meet Maria and they both settle down to the ground, for Steve’s sake, he presumes. He wonders how he can get the man in a shiny suit of his own.
“So you’re here to get our stories, yeah? Well, I can go first, mine is boring. My alpha raped me. Which they don’t call it rape, do they? But that’s what he did. My parents strongly encouraged me to marry him at one point in time. And then later I strongly encouraged myself to leave and ended up here. It’s been hard, but good.”
It agitates him that he doesn’t know anything about Tony now. Who he was seeing before they married, who he’s been with, why? Steve feels that he maybe has some right to that information, but he thinks that Tony will fight him on this too.
to be inside you.” Steve’s hand is oh so gentle as he tests Tony’s entrance, fingertips stirring up arousal as they glance at Tony’s waiting hole.
He pressed the button again, just to feel something as he looked at the toxicity levels in his blood, to know that he was closer to death after wearing the Iron Man suit for probably not the last time, but one of the last. Heck, he could die in the thing if he wanted. The Iron Ghost in a metal coffin.
“Maybe he doesn’t. But God loves sinners as much as those who don’t sin. Who are you to say that God can’t love Tony Stark? Even if he burns water.”
Steve’s insides stir a little at the endearment, and he examines Tony up close. Close cropped goatee with a dark pink mouth and even darker amber eyes, Tony is pretty in a way that reminds him of Peggy. In all of this, he hasn’t had a chance to even think about her, and he frowns. Tony catches it, because he darts his eyes away from Steve’s face, and damn, he must think Steve means him.
“Tomorrow. I promise.” Tony clutches at the vow, pulling it tight to his chest where it gnaws at him.
“I just thought it was a carrot and stick situation where he would get better if I withheld privileges.”
And Tony, well, he backs up, stepping over the log that he knows is there, keeping himself facing forward.
an omega like Tony. Tony is a slut, a side piece, who never gets the alpha. Wanting Steve feels like the worst kind of sin, because Steve is
“Time to test something, sweetheart.” Fisting both wrists in one hand over Tony’s head, he gently presses two fingers into Tony’s mouth. Instinctively, Tony starts to bite down, but it’s not hard. His Omega is straining now, looking consternated at the inability to close sharply on Steve’s fingers. The tentative beginning-bond formed by what Tony has swallowed is there.
“Omega, no.” Steve’s command is stronger now, and he can’t disobey. Doesn’t want to. He feels like he’s floating a little, and he pulls his jaw shut before Steve realizes that Tony was about to drool from just those two words. Reining it in is his top priority right now.
Tony skates past the bridge, using the water as a stabilizer to push off and towards the nuke. He can’t believe they’ve done this. It’s reckless, and irresponsible. Is this how Pepper feels when he shits the bed on some merger or board meeting? Tony is deathly afraid for her, for all of New York.
“I should apologize to him, shouldn’t I? He’s a good agent. That’s all that really matters.” Even if Steve thinks deep down that someone should be looking out for Clint.
Everything is ready, he thinks as he peers around his Brooklyn apartment. It’s not what Tony’s used to, but it’s not like they’ll be here permanently.
Motes of dust dance in the air, and Tony sighs with resignation, hearing the trundle of someone coming out to join him.
“I want us to be able to speak freely, Tony. Something I don’t get a chance to do a lot of because there are things I need to tell you, truths I need to get out into the open. You see, I’m not the man you think I am.” Steve gets up and walks around the couch to where Tony is standing, impatient, twitching, like he can’t be still for longer than a second.
“Do I?” Bucky leans forward, planting his hands on the ground and looking like he’s going to stalk after Tony on all fours.
“Yes. If that’s what you wanted.” And oh, it hurts. His chest is tight and his limbs are starting to tense with the truth of what he’s saying. He doesn’t want Tony to go. He remembers how sweet Tony was after he’d been knotted. How pliant and lovely he was in the bath. The kindness that Tony exhibited when he checked on Steve’s nightmares. Tony
So here he was, drinking these concerns along with some expensive whiskey. Cowardice, like alcoholism, is a lifelong condition, of which Tony is more than passingly acquainted with.
Most vomit up various parts of other people they’ve swallowed, leaving the floors smelling of foul death and stomach acid. There’s too many to let stay in hospital beds, but in terms of relapse, not a single person turns back into a mindless, hungry beast.
Tony yanks up his pants, feeling disgusted at how much slick is sticking to the fabric. He’s filthy and feeling used. As Tony flips around, he makes eye contact with Bucky, whose eyes are hooded and dark with intent, watching him like a predator.
Being lost in his thoughts, he doesn’t register that Tony is rushing as he gets up from his chair, but as Tony runs over to the sink, he realizes that there’s something wrong. It’s then that Tony vomits, spilling out chewed up red and yellow into the sink. Tony is hunched over it now, arms on either side as he grips the bottom of the countertop. Steve can smell the sour odor of bile and Tony’s distressed scent.
Steve then pours the handful of chopped peppers into the omelet and proceeds to break out a bag of cheese to add. Tony is a shadow behind him, clutching the spatula in a white-knuckled grip.
“I’m sure I’ll be fine.” Sometimes Rhodey thinks that he wants to get lost in the forest here, and that if he does, he’ll find Tony that very moment. And then they’ll find their way back, together. He lost sight of that fantasy being a reality after a couple of months.
“You know Tony, I thought you’d changed. It wasn’t so long ago you promised a younger, more idealistic version of me that you’d meet me on a rooftop. You never showed.”
“I’m sorry Nick. What were you lying? These are for a threat that doesn’t exist, Fury. Do we have a loch ness monster defense system? No, no we do not.” Tony talks over them and whips the monitor around, showing schematics for weapons that were powered by said Tesseract.
Nonetheless, he should probably stop his self-imposed isolation and let the world back in. He’s going to have to face the music anyway and tell Bucky that Tony isn’t cut out for this.
The people there are kind, gesturing for them to take it easy, that they’ll take care of everything. And they do.
“Ah but darling, I can smell that he hasn’t touched you. You’re as fresh as you were the first time you came to me. We had some good times, didn’t we baby.”
Right now, Tony has a hunt to go on, has to find Steve. He practically purrs at the thought of Steve playing hide-and-seek with him; his instincts all but demand that he seeks Steve out to tackle him to the couch, kissing and licking his cheeks and neck and chest.
Steve is sucking again, licking and flattening his tongue against Tony, the soft, sensitive skin sliding so well. Every breath he takes smells like Tony; musky and thick with the sweat of sex. He presses down again, taking Tony all the way in, and listens to the man gasp. He keeps his fingers pumping, pumping away, as he presses his nose to the dark curls of Tony’s mons.
But it doesn’t stop. Steve forgoes cleanup for the moment and walks to his room, resigned. He takes off his pants quickly, with no falsehoods to himself about what he’s going to do. Settling in on his bed, he grips his cock once more and thinks of Tony.
“He’s signed an NDA to keep his identity secret. You’ll see him on the battlefield, Cap.” Lies like this come easier to Tony. It always makes him think of Pepper when he tells one, however.
Bucky, just as Bucky saved Steve. It’s an old, human story, and yet here they are, rending it apart with a vicious emotion’s claws. Everyone knows that two Alphas living in close conditions can often become competitive, but this is something else.
There’s a brief moment where he thinks maybe Tony truly isn’t cut out for this kind of life, but he dismisses it when he remembers that other omegas that he’d known lived quiet and fulfilling lives. Tony can do that too. If he wants it. He just has to want it.
“What is it, sweetheart? You know you can tell me anything.” Steve is trying so hard for Tony. He’s rubbing little circles onto his back, pulling two fingers down as he frames the outline of Tony’s spine. He’s scrambling at the edges of Tony’s sanity, looking for a way in before Tony’s mind finds a way out. Tony doesn’t deserve him, and Steve doesn’t deserve a fractured alpha.
As for Fury, Steve has no intention ever of making Tony produce anything he doesn’t want to. Despite what this may look like from the outside, Steve truly has Tony’s best interests at heart.
When Steve flips him over, casually manhandling Tony with the ease of a super soldier, Tony thrusts his ass back to Steve, presenting his now-used hole for his alpha.
“Steve, please, don’t make me wait. I can’t—” Steve swallows him whole while pressing a single digit to the tight circle of Tony’s ass, the rhythm of sucking and circling Tony’s hole in seamless tandem. Despite the liquid warmth of Tony, the little circle of muscle holds Steve at bay for moments before Steve presses in. But once inside, it protests the removal by suctioning onto Steve as though Tony’s ass never wants him to leave. The push-pull reminds him of Tony’s heat, and even like this, Tony’s hole is so greedy to be filled. If this is all Steve is good for, it’s enough. It has to be enough.
“Are you sure—” Tony cuts himself off, terrified of ruining this moment, but also of allowing Steve to take it farther than the man really wants. He can’t want Tony. He’s just being kind. Steve knows that Tony is lonely because Steve sees everything. He’s a brilliant tactician and an even better student of humans. This is just… it’s just a helping hand.
The noise peters out and goes the other direction, towards the camp. He breathes a sigh of relief and gets up, dusting his pants off of whatever else is laying on the ground.
He’s bashing away at robotic limbs, heads, and torsos as he hears the telltale shriek of repulsor energy above from Iron Man streaking by. Several bots in his vicinity simply implode, giving him much needed breathing space. The robots aren’t endless, but there sure are a lot of them.
The conversation continues as Fury guilt trips him about Rhodey. Blah blah security guidelines blah. And when Natalie hits him with the lithium dioxide, it’s like diving into clear water. His vision brightens and his limbs are suffused with energy. He hardly hears Fury tell him that there’s another way before his gaze is boring into Fury’s with a desperate hope that he prays isn’t reflected on his face.
The claws that seem to be coming for them both latch around Steve as if the Kaiju intimately understands how a jaeger is nothing without its pilots.
And Steve is that ideal. When Steve had closed the portal, he’d made the right call. A call that if the situation had been reversed, Tony’s not sure he could have made. Even knowing now what waited beyond the portal. There’s an inaccessibility to the Captain. He’s beautiful, but like all things beautiful, he is indifferent. Tony wishes being a good person could erase the terrible things he’s done. Steve is so far above Tony in morality and place, that it makes no sense for Tony to admire the man. He can’t ever aspire to him, can’t be seen as a viable option for mating or close friendship. Not that he’d want to hitch wagons with Mr. Self Righteous. He wasn’t that much of a masochist. It hurts anyway.
He steels himself, picks up the plate of food, and goes to Tony in his workshop. The doors open as easily as they always have, and Tony doesn’t turn around. He never turns around now.
“Tony, that sounds invasive. Why not just take a break?” He’s trying to be nonchalant, but he’s anything but. He knew this confrontation was coming, he just hadn’t thought about how to navigate it. Tony is a whirlwind, and you never know where he ends up. Steve wants to embrace him, hold him close so he’ll stop spinning in the wind. The thought of Tony, grounded and his, sparks in him.
“How dare you.” She walks straight up to Steve, with his burnt hands and bullet holes scattered in his arm and punches him right in his wounds. Again, like with Rhodes, he lets it happen. They are entitled to their feelings, and at least one good shot at him.
“In essence, you are already married, though the contract hasn’t started yet. It will be five years before you can have an uncontested divorce. Though you may be able to get out sooner if there is a question of infidelity on his part.” The lawyer taps at the papers with a solid-looking pen before shuffling them and pulling the relevant portion that contains the circumstances under which Steve may divorce the omega.
Tony twists around as best he can, extending his neck for more of Steve’s ministrations. Steve obliges, now moving towards Tony’s glands, gently suckling the skin in a way that draws arousal from deep in his belly, preparing him for Steve.
Tony chuckles, and it doesn’t sound mocking, but lighthearted in a way that Steve is surprised Tony can still be.
“Steve!” He gasps as Steve breaches him, pulling out of his shallow thrust before pressing back in. His tempo is off, but starts to steady into languorous fucking. Steve fucks him deep and hard, his balls and thighs against Tony’s. He fucks Tony until he’s moved inches up on the bed from the power of it. And then he fucks harder, hips pistoning into Tony, Steve’s hands upon his bare hips as he laves at Tony’s neck.
, and a ridiculous grin splits Bucky’s face wide. It’s then that Tony realizes—this is a lot like tag football. He just has to get a hold of the letter and Tony will be home free.
“Mm. Steve.” The breathless way Tony says his name hums down his throat where Steve is still holding him. God. Tony is so beautiful. Steve takes his other hand away from Tony’s ass and wraps it around him, covering, protecting. It’s instinct, he knows, to make sure Tony is safe. He takes his other hand away from Tony’s throat and threads those fingers through Tony’s wet hair on his forehead.
“Let me help you relax. I want to do something for you.” Those words ignite something in Tony, and he fleetingly thinks of Bucky before he pushes that thought away and
“JARVIS?” He’s leery about the AI, but he figures he better get over it, since there are only so many connections to Tony he’s going to get.
He’s exhausted when he gets back to the tower, and he doesn’t go check on Tony, because he knows he’s not ready to apologize in the way Tony needs. He has to think about what he’s going to say, to make sure it’s perfect.
Trevor’s hard eyes rise to the surface of his thoughts and they superimpose over Tony’s. He doesn’t want Tony to look at him that way, to hate every alpha including him, for the betrayals of his gender.
“Thank you for that, and for letting me do this with you.” Steve is still lapping at the come, finding it more and more appetizing. Soon his hand is clean, and he tucks himself behind Tony stiffly, waiting for Tony to realize he’s actually here and dismiss him.
After peeling the suit off, and storing it in a SHIELD approved containment unit, he makes sure to summon one of his old suits to the carrier as a precaution in case they have to fight again. He’d had to wrench the crushed gauntlet off, and now he’s not so sure he can get it back on again. Checking his watch, he figures the new suit will be here in an hour or so. Plenty of time to start looking for that weighted companion cube, aka the Tesseract, and euthanize it.
That hand, the one on his thigh that’s burning a hole into his skin, starts to move, sliding down to the soft interior of his thigh and upwards towards his groin.
His life since waking up has been a series of mistakes that if he could take back, he would. He owes Tony a thousand apologies. One for every minute he let Tony live like a veritable slave.
“If I really was narcissistic enough to try and take over the world, I’d leave some plausible deniability in there Stevie.”
The double doors leading out from the room bust open at that point, and Natasha and Thor are bodily carrying Clint between them. The man is covered in blood, and Steve’s stomach drops. He doesn’t know the man, but any human would feel upset at watching someone else suffer, only to turn into a mindless creature bent on consuming other people. It’s horrible. Everything about this is a special kind of awful.
.” Tony freezes at the alpha voice that Bucky uses, so angry that this is the second time he’s had it performed on him this week. He’s done listening. He doesn’t want to hear anything that either of them has to say, but he’s stuck waiting out the command. “Tony, I want you. I want you to be mine, my omega.”
He’s at a loss. It’s possible Tony is reeling from the idea of being an Omega, but he thought they had a trust. That Tony would come to him if it got overwhelming. Steve doesn’t know if Tony has taken the stabilizers now, or if he’s researching his condition further. Steve doesn’t know anything, and it’s killing him inside.
And god, Tony’s cock is fully erect under him, leaking pre-cum onto his trim belly. He’s a vision. Steve’s going to ruin him, remake him.
“He’s not giving me a chance Natasha. After his heat is done, he said he’s done with me. This is all I get. But it’s fine. It’s going to be ok, because if this is it, I’ll make sure it’s good for him.” Steve wrings his hands together and then crosses his arms.
“Oh! Oh. Let me—” Father Jacobs bolts up from his seat and closes the basement door and looks outside the sacristy into the church before closing that one too. “There we go, that’s about as private as I can get it. Now, I’d ask you how long since you last confessed, but we’ve divined that already, haven’t we?”
at Bucky, even as Steve seemed to crave more of it, more of Bucky’s time. Even Tony could see what was happening.
“That doesn’t seem like a good idea. Tony, we should get to the clinic.” Steve backs up and squats on his heels. Tony starts to crawl towards him, wedging his knees up underneath his body so he can grasp Steve by the lapels of his shirt.
Steve wants to know every part of Tony. Every patch of skin and bone that makes up his love. Tony shivers and shudders under his exploration, eyes screwed closed from the sensation.
“Well, no, I just thought—yeah ok. I can see where that might have helped if he actually wanted to cook.”
“Guess that wasn’t something I ever got to have time to come to terms with, is it? Wonder how that happened.” Tony doesn’t know if it would have made a difference, but he likes to think it would have. The rage he feels is incandescent. He
“Coulson said they needed me, but not that much,” Tony turned then, and stalked back over to Fury. “You overplayed your hand there a bit, Mr. Gothic Pirate. Tell you what, I’ll waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour or three. The first of which is that Rhodey and I are being honored in Washington and we need a presenter.”
“And when do you plan to bond?” The pen scribbles away on the clipboard while Steve imagines Tony in the office with him, getting sassy with the doctor. It makes his lips curl up in a small smile as he crosses his arms and gazes at the wall displaying Omega reproductive organs.
“Steve, I want to be alone. May I?” Steve’s taken aback, but realizes it might have something to do with whatever is going on with Tony’s chest. He likely doesn’t want to take his shirt off in front of Steve.
Steve strides down the hall, trying not to run and jostle Tony, but desperate to get to his lover’s room. The sooner he bites Tony, the better it will be for both of them. The whining that Tony is doing into his shirt is painfully adorable and also grates on his last Alpha nerve. As an Alpha, he should have had Tony in his bed, nested and ready.
“What’s this about?”  Fury’s desk isn’t immaculate. Every other place in the compound is a marvel of architecture, defying expectations of small, cramped offices that Steve has seen. He’s not sure what he expected, but he does realize that Fury is a busy man. Busy enough that he might not be ahead on all of his work that’s overflowing his desk.
Tony gasps as the knot expands, his whole world narrowing onto that single point of contact that constricts his prostate all at once, extending his already drawn-out orgasm into something mind-warping. Bucky is grunting, twisting his hips into little circles as he pulses stream after stream into Tony’s greedy ass.
Steve knows that in his heart it’s not Tony’s fault. It’s Steve’s weakness. But he’s so angry at Tony. Every time he tries anything, Tony ruins it by opening his mouth. He feels defeat as it begins to settle into his very bones, his marrow. It tastes sour and rancid. He’s not supposed to be weak.
The day passes uneventfully, Steve leaving him in a good mood for the rest of work. They go to bed at a decent time, and Tony presses a tender kiss to Steve’s temple, delighting in the sharp hairs there that tickle his lips. Steve seeks out Tony’s mouth and latches on with an off-center kiss. It’s imperfect, and its imperfection is a comfort. If Steve were good at everything one hundred percent of the time, Tony would be in trouble.
“Is Mr. Stark going to be on the helicarrier?” JARVIS picks up what the Captain says, and he slows down to reply affirmatively.
“You should let him go, your omega. He deserves better than you. We all deserve better than you. We’re leaving.” Trevor stands up and takes Angela’s hand, helping her stand.
Steve shucks his boxers, his cock stabbing straight forward, eager. The kiss has lit parts of him aflame and left him feeling like molten gold.
change. Howard would have never let this happen if he’d been alive.” Steve thinks he’s getting a headache just imagining what he’s going to have to do to sort this out.
“It would be just a mistake if I hadn’t harmed other people in the process. But you don’t understand how badly I’ve harmed Tony. I’ve really hurt him. Physically, mentally, emotionally. I took something that was supposed to be precious between us, and I crushed it under the weight of my own cowardice.”
“Language. I’m agreeing to this because it’s clear you need minding. Maybe Howard didn’t intend for me to be alive and there, but he certainly wouldn’t have intended your behavior.”
“—and you start sleeping with me.” Steve steps into his range, bringing their chests flush to one another. Tony backs up faster than a repulsor blast, scrabbling to escape Steve’s personal space.
Finally, he’s in front of the door, and he swiftly breaks down the number lock there as well, thanking the powers that be that it’s not dissimilar to the one from his room and that disabling it doesn’t seem to be setting off any alarms.
And Tony might beg to be bred, which sends Steve’s mind into paroxysms of arousal just thinking about Tony pregnant. Even though he knows that he wouldn’t be able to get Tony pregnant, that doesn’t stop his body from thinking that it wants to try anyway.
He is the furthest thing from a good boy. No, he fucked Bucky’s hand, took advantage of him, used him for pleasure, and then let the man walk away without returning the favor or otherwise clarifying what happened. This is his fault.
Now it’s a few months later, and he’s staring into the blue eyes of Tiberius Stone and tumbling down the sharp cheekbones to the white smile, to the ostentatious suit, to his Italian loafers. It makes Tony fold back into himself. Is that how he looks? Is he as sad and pathetic as Stone?
Their nest. Tony’s nest. A warm little light bubbles up in his chest and he feels the excruciating sensation of loss when he remembers that it’s transitory. All of this won’t last and he’ll be left with nothing but his mistakes.
Tony is panting now, little droplets of sweat dotting his forehead, a sheen of it coating his alluring chest, cock at perfect attention for Steve. Steve’s legs spread wide to press apart Tony’s, his knees coming up under Tony’s thighs. It allows him the vantage point from which to gaze down at where he’s connected with Tony. The rim is dusky pink, stretched precariously around Steve’s knot, where it looks like it wants to slide down or over it, completely in or out.
He’s staring at a plate of food. It’s lasagna, and he spent hours making each part of the recipe from scratch. There’s nothing better to do. He’s aimless otherwise.
It’s an overreaction to call Sunset a rapist. He got it up, after all. But the nuances of consent had been lost on the older woman. Though he suspected she full well knew what she was doing and did it anyway. A late-night confession to Steve, whispered after they’d made love had his normally sweet omega grouchy and pacing. But it’d been months since he’d told Steve. Nonetheless, like magic, Steve materializes at his side, his biceps pressing at the seams of his suit coat as he crosses his arms, all but screaming that he’s on the defensive.
Tony lightly tapped the edge of the small envelope against the counter of the bar. It was starting to get dark outside, and he could see the fat, soft, snowflakes outside the windows. Downstairs, Peter was probably ecstatic about the snowfall. He and Mary had agreed that Peter would open presents with him on Christmas Day. Since her parents now lived with them, they'd be having Christmas Eve on their floor.
“You were picking half those fights yourself,” Bucky pointed at him, daring him to refute the statement. “I ain’t saying they weren’t for the right reasons, but I ended up fighting next to you more times than shoulda been happenin’.” He huffed a little and dropped his arms. “Don’t hurt the boys to know a little bit of the right way to do things, specially not with who they live with, and who their parents are.”
The phone started to ring and Tony kissed the top of Peter's head as he helped put the last dish in the dishwasher. "Stay right here, buddy," Tony said. "I'm just gonna grab the phone, then we can have some ice cream." He smiled at Peter's little cheer and half jogged out to the living room to find the phone. He glanced around, wondering why Jarvis hadn't announced who was calling, and why it was going to the handset anyway.
"We were going to watch the Stark Expo opening tonight," she said with a sad wrinkle to her nose. "Seems that's why Fury wanted to do this tonight?"
Bucky stepped out of the apartment, both Coulson and Mary inside with the twins and Meg. Looking towards the elevator he didn’t see the security guard Todd there, but when he looked down the other way he saw that the Wilson’s apartment door was partially open. He could hear Julie raising her voice to someone, most likely over the phone by the fact that there was no answering voice, and Wade was sitting on the floor against the wall. Bucky walked over quietly and sat down next to him.
"We kissed," Steve blurted out, making Mary stop and blink. She looked at him. "At the Manor, we kissed. It had been a kind of emotional day? I mean, we were talking about Howard-" Mary's eyebrows shot up "-and then he had had a nightmare, and I couldn't sleep. And one thing led to another, and we kissed." Mary blinked a couple of times, slowly. "And then, just a little bit ago, Tony dragged me to the gym, and we kissed again,..."
"Security guard. Flexible schedule, full benefits, has experience," Tony recited off as they started walking again. "Pay grade six, I think." He nodded a little.
"Are you going to call?" Mary asked. Tony wrinkled his nose a little; Too many people actually wanting him to do the responsible thing when it came to himself. Let him work on one thing at a time, and right now that was being a father, no, a Dad, to Peter, and working on the Mark II armor. Wait.... that was two things, wasn't it?"
Steve jolted a little in his sleep, a loud, high pitched gurgle reaching his ears and him back to consciousness. He was up, blankets tumbling to the ground as he jumped from the bed and ran across the floor the door, grabbing onto the frame when he stumbled a little. In less than two seconds he was at Jamie’s doorway, then stopped, and blinked as he stared inside the room. Peter was sitting in Tony’s lap, who was on the floor, and Peter was holding onto Jamie’s hands while she stood on her own two feet. She had shoes on, but didn’t look all too happy about it.
Wade came out first, and the woman raised a hand to him and walked over to the kid. Bucky’s eyes narrowed a bit and he pushed himself away from the car. The woman and Wade were talking, and Wade pointed over towards Bucky She put a hand on his shoulder, giving it a squeeze before she turned to head in Bucky’s direction. He saw the little frown on Wade’s face before he was heading back to the school doors, most likely to get Peter.
Steve dropped the old, unfortunately familiar, weapon the counter, cause the three men to turn. He worked with SHIELD for over a year, he was supposed to trust them. "Phase 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons." Steve spared a glance towards Tony. "Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow."
"Daddy!!" Tony stepped off the elevator and instantly got down on one knee to embrace the running child. He wrapped his arms around him, Peter's little arms wrapping tightly around Tony's neck in return, pressing his face into Tony's neck. "Daddy," he sniffed a little and Tony stood back up, hand rubbing circles on Peter's back. "I was scared, Daddy." Tony's heart broke a little at that, having horrible deja vu from a year ago in Monaco. "They were attacking you."
"If anything, with the new arc reactor, I'm probably a better candidate," Tony said with a scoff. "The element has been slowly working at my internal organs and cleaning them up. I can feel it sometimes."
“You’re in my home, and you’re adding horrible songs, in my presence!” Tony looked at his phone when Jarvis sent the new song alert. Steve was sitting on one of the loveseats, feet propped up, his own phone in his hand.
“Spoilsport.” Tony sat up a little further in the bed, putting his tablet by his glasses on the bedside table.
"How are you holding up with a two week old in your arms?" Tony asked, turning more towards Steve with the warm bottle.
“I do not know specifics,” Loki said, suddenly walking on the other side of Tony and Strange. “The being that has kept Stark’s mind hostage works to secure that hold. I believe that a third entity has intervened, and now it is difficult to bring Stark back to us.”
"Nope," she said with a big pop of her lips at the end. "All homework is done, they've eaten dinner, and now I have them engaged in an epic Mario Kart battle. Even if we are still trapped inside the building"
Tony shrugged, hands in his lap. "I'm not actually sure. If you wanted to get in after dark? Or if you needed to save me, or something, I don't actually know, but if something came up I didn't want you be stuck." He worried at his lip a little with his teeth. "I know it's nothing like that utterly amazing drawing, but-" It was Tony's turn to sound surprised when Steve leaned in to kiss him.
"Stay to eat an actual breakfast," Steve stopped him. "Then you can go do what you need to do." He pointed at a chair and Tony sunk down into it.
"Oh, this should be good." Tony opened the file, seeing only two songs there so far. "What the- Pocketful of Sunshine and I Want It That Way?? Jarvis, vitals! I'm not having a stroke am I?"
"How about, we go see Cap next door, and I'll go find everyone else, yeah?" Tony looked at Peter, seeing tired brown eyes meet his own. "You can talk to him, 'cause he's the real Captain America, and I'll see if everyone else can have visitors. Then we're gonna get you to a bed to sleep, alright?" Tony needed to see where Mary was, and if Coulson had been able to do anything before, well, everything had happened. He still wanted Mary moved to his care, he was not going to settle for anything less.
"Wanna see Uncle Bruce, Mr Steve, and Phil," Peter said tiredly. Tony pursed his lips a little at the mention of Phil. He didn't want to be the one to tell Peter what had happened, at least not right now, not with everything else that had happened. He would talk to Fury though. Tony would take care of all arrangements, he owed it to Mary. He pulled Peter into a hug against his side, trying not to think about what would happen when Mary woke up.
Tony had found himself leaning in to Steve's hands, closing his eyes a little at the warm touch, letting it soak in. One traitor tear slipped down to run over Steve's thumb. "I'm still mad at you," he said quietly, not trusting his voice not to crack.
Peggy hummed then turned her attention to Vee. “Evelyn, love, does our Steven like our Tony?” Steve’s face got redder, and Vee mewed in the affirmative. “As I suspected. I know my nephew, and he would not have trusted his family to someone he did not trust, nor like. I think something deeper runs there, because merely a month ago you were complaining about him. Now you’re worried about his safety.” Steve huffed a little. “Well, help me into my chair, I want to get meet the rest of the girls. I assume you’ve brought Arc and Brave as well?” Steve scrambled to help Peggy, pulling another chuckle from her.
"Yeah, divide and conquer is great, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?" Tony crossed his arms over his chest, and his feet started walking. It seemed that Tony did his best thinking while he was moving. "That's what he want. He want to beat us, and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience."
"If you were to die, then I would be as good as dead," Loki explained, like it should have been obvious. "You hold the proof of any innocence that I have in my actions."
"I can feel you moping," Bruce said as soon as he walked in. "I thought you had talked to Steve last night."
Steve moved quickly, grabbing Loki's arm, but Loki was ready and twisted in Steve's grip. He grunted and turned, tossing Loki across the floor. Thor was landing outside, eyes lighting on Loki. Steve threw his shield again when Loki went to reach for the scepter, but jumped back when the vibranium sparked against the ground in front of him.
He pushed the blanket off and got up, heading for the hallway of bedrooms. The door to Peter's room was partially open, and when he peeked his head inside he saw that Peter and Wade were both asleep on the bed, looking much more peaceful than earlier that morning. He let out a little breath of relief at seeing them there. He moved to go check in Tony's bedroom, and saw that Mary's door was open a little. There was a voice talking inside, low and quiet.
"Nope! Everyone dances to this song." Tony wrapped his arm around Steve's when he went to move from the dance floor. "Even Agent is doing the dance!"
"You know, all you had to say was Peter, and I would have come up here myself." Tony couldn't help the smile that started to spread across his face.
Tony grinned at him. "I think that you could do just about anything you wanted, Petey. If you want to make art for a living, then go for it. I'll help you get everything you need to start." He played with a longer, curlier, piece of his hair. "You got time to figure out what you want to do with your life though, so there's still a lot of things for you to have fun with."
“No, that, as I said previously, can only be done with the lost scepter,” Loki reminded him. “The one with the same power that lies within these two, curiously enough.” Loki looked at the Maximoff twins, before looking back down at Tony’s prone form. “This shall be a temporary fix. But should give you enough time to find your missing artifacts.”
"The stunning, yet deadly, SHIELD Agent that's been acting as my PA?" Tony should have been more suspicious when the PA took down happy in the boxing ring barely paying any attention. "I'm kind of impressed that you guys managed to work her in for so long without me noticing. They couldn't just have asked you to report back to them?"
"Don't make any promises," Tony interrupted him with a soft voice. "Not until we talk." He rubbed his face with one hand, then opened a cupboard above the sink and pulled out a bottle of aspirin. "Like, the first thing on my mind is apparently we're friendly with our assassin? Well, my would-be assassin." He dry swallowed a couple of pills, then turned to look at Steve.
"I bet we could work out-" Tony gasped as the man fired his gun, the bullet finding purchase in his upper arm. The force pushed him back, throwing off his balance, falling back and landing on his side.
“Steve, I need your phone.” His hand was reaching out as he helped Peter into the back, and was climbing in the front a second later. “I have a bad feeling about Meg.”
At first Vee didn’t like her. She was at the mansion more than often than Obie, or even Tony was there sometimes. Vee saw her as the reason that Tony was gone for business more and more. Until the first time Pepper dragged an unconscious Tony in, dropping him on the closest couch. Pepper slid down to the floor as Eevee ran over to Tony, jumping up to lick his cheek. She let out a noise when Tony’s breath hit her nose, the smell of alcohol hitting her strong. Pepper very gently lifted Vee up and down into her lap, away from Tony’s mouth.
"I just, it's hard to think that someone would try and force the changes the serum gives on someone," Steve said, frowning, looking at the punching bag. "I like to think that Howard was different than the bad guys we were fighting back in the war, but he would have forced that on you. That's not what a father should be like." Tony could tell that he was getting more upset, more force pushing against him as Steve hit harder. He changed his stance, putting more force into holding the punching bag still. "And I know that Bruce didn't know what he wanted to do at first, and it makes me upset that he was trying to use him to do something like that. You were his son."
"I want to display them at Stark Industries," he countered. "Both the California and New York locations. One for outside and one for inside, so I'm thinking four in total." Her mouth opened a little in disbelief. "And I want them big, something that people will notice, because I'm not known to do anything half-way."
The beeping come from Tony's phone pulled him back to it, and then his eyes up to the screens. His decryption programmed must have tripped over a new fail safe that neither he nor Jarvis had anticipated. Both he and Bruce walked over to the monitor, Tony holding his phone up to it, letting the program retry again. He looked at Bruce who had a grim look. They were not going to find anything good in these files.
Tony had a smug little smile when he woke up the next morning. The weather had seemed to have a complete turnaround. The streets were indeed cleared, the crews working all through the night, and the sun was out. The temperature had risen just a little bit, and the snow was easier to clear from the sidewalks. Jarvis found a well-reviewed Diner that was only a couple blocks away, and after a well-rested night sleep with Steve at his side, even Tony was willing to make the walk.
"But, it's such a rare occurrence," she continued as she followed him anyway. "The great Tony Stark, officially ending his playboy ways, seemingly set straight by the secret love child, only recently come to light."
"Now that just seems like a mouthful," Steve shook his head a little and Tony may have actually growled.
Tony moved his head a little when he saw Mary walk in the room, sitting in one of the seats across from the couch. Mary looked at Peter, watching him as a mother does sometimes, eyes soft, a little smile on her lips. Tony wondered if she wanted more kids. He knows that she surely hadn't planned on having Peter, still lost in the grief of losing her husband. Perhaps they had talked about it, maybe they didn't, but Tony knows that she had not been planning on this, least of all with someone like Tony Stark.
"I appreciate that, ma'am," Steve said, looking at her as he spoke, before going to explore the rest of the apartment. The bedroom was painted a soft beige color, the bedspread a solid blue color, tucked in with hospital corners. Another room across from the bedroom looked like it was a study similar to the one that Mary had. There were some folders already sitting on the desk.
"A hero?" Tony let out a snort, then stepped up close, inches from Steve's face. "Like you? You're a lab rat," Tony spit out the last two words. "Everything special about you came out of a bottle."
"You wanna write your own name, kiddo?" Tony asked Wade. He grabbed the clipboard and pen and handed it to Wade as he pulled his wallet from his back pocket, flipping the leather open and pulling out his ID. He handed it to her and watched her slide it through a small scanner.
Tony came out of the bedroom, eyes hooded, concealing anger, and the reason why followed him out of the bedroom. "It's always work with you, isn't it?" Rachel whispered to him as they closed the door. "You can't take the time to stay with your son, and my daughter that's hurt because of this mess? It's all about your image, isn't it?"
"He's cool," Tony told the little boy with a smile. "I made him." That seemed to make little Peter's eyes wider. He was still smiling, watching Peter, then tilted his head a little. Peter's wide eyes were starting to look a little red, the skin getting a little puffier? The toddler then let out a couple coughs. He wrinkled up his little face, and coughed again, turning his face into Tony's shoulder, letting out a little whine. "J?" Tony couldn't help but ask. He was hoping that he was being overly paranoid.
"I'm pretty sure that you said that you were moving, because you had been, transferred?" Tony looked at the boxes again, seeing some stuff already in the boxes. "And that you were moving to Queens? Queens, really??"
Steve glanced over when Tony didn't answer right away and saw Tony shuffling his shoe against the ground. That was a sign that Tony had done something spontaneously, something that wasn't a surprise to anyone that knew him, but wasn't sure how everyone else was going to react.
Tony needed to get out of this room. He needed to end this, he needed to make things safe for Peter, for Mary. "I can get there faster."
“Yes, I brought you cake for your birthday, even though I know you don’t like that.” She got up and motioned for him to get up, too. “Come, before Peter just shoves his whole face into it.”
"I'm filing that information away," the older woman smirked, and Tony blinked, realizing he had given her useful ammunition for the future.
"It's powered by an Arc Reactor, self-sustaining energy source." Tony glanced over at the smaller one, still sitting on the table. "That building will run itself for what, a year?"
“Shield has lost an Infinity stone??” Steve took a step back from the magician. “How was it lost, and who has it?!”
“To keep his mind- What?!” Steve looked back at Tony, then turned the full force of a Captain America glare at Loki. “If you don’t start explaining what all of this means in the next two seconds, I will use my shield on your head.”
"Say what now." It didn't sound like she was happy about the prospect of another house arrest situation.
“People have generally been annoying me,” Tony said with a shrug. “Specifically, your husband’s charges.” Mary let out a little sigh. “I don’t really wanna talk, or argue about it.”
"Wait for him to come to us," Steve said, and his tone couldn't have sounded more defeated. "Or wait for Meg to make him do it?" Tony set down his mug and walked over to Steve, rubbing his arm a little. "Feels like everything is changing."
"Does he know Mr Stark?" Steve couldn't help but asking. He had thought about going to get an appointment with Anthony, before he did his limited research, but thought that it might be weird, for both of them.
He gasped as he fell to the ground, strength fading, giving up. He couldn't do it, he couldn't even gather the strength needed to go and save his son. He-
"Hopefully we can find out if someone is working with them, or if they've stolen someone's DNA," Natasha commented. She glanced at Tony for a second, then looked back at Steve. "We might have a lead on another location." That had Steve's attention. "It's a flimsy one, but if it's right, then this would be one of their main locations, one that they wouldn't be able to move quickly, or want to move at all."
"As soon as I can" turned out to be nearly four months later. In that time, Tony managed to get the entire shell of Stark Tower built, and was working on the wiring of each floor as contractors finished putting in the walls. The Stark Expo had gotten enough presentations for the first four months when it opened, and as soon as the rest of the snow melted, crew would be out there cleaning up the Flushing Gardens space, preparing pavilions and booths, getting ready for a late Spring opening.
“You’ll be fiiine.” He stole the sunglasses from his face. “I’ll also hold onto these, don’t want you losing them.” Peter grabbed one of Steve’s hands. “I’ll be watching!” He said as he pointed up to the building. Peter was already pulling Steve along to the entrance. Steve looked where he was pointing and saw the sudden drop that with the riders, hearing the screams. Tony laughed as Steve’s eyes widened and he was stumbling after Peter.
