) and caresses the nape of his neck with his fingertips, enjoying the sensation of his smooth, thick curls winding around his fingers.
"Oil," Sherlock mutters, trying to keep kissing him through it all, and gently pushes him in the required direction. "Bath."
), too. He looks at his favourites and gives them special places, and when he eventually falls asleep in the early hours of the morning, he dreams of nothing at all.
“You know we don’t have to---” I start, but he interrupts me by pressing a brief, but very sincere kiss onto my lips.
John exhales loudly, then moans, and it sounds as if his soul was being tortured. Sherlock closes the distance between them and wraps him in his arms to hold him tight. John groans again, his face pressed against Sherlock's neck, his beard scraping his skin.
He chuckles lowly and finally frees my hands from the stubborn garment so that I can put my palms on his body again. His muscles are moving under the fabric of his shirt, and I feel him thrumming with life, with energy. His face pressed against my neck, he grazes the soft spot beneath my ear with his teeth and simultaneously shrugs off his jacket with a smooth, careless motion.
"I mean it, Sherlock," John says and nips at his upper lip. "I want you to. You've--- done this before… haven't you?"
John walks over to the bed on shaky legs and lies down on his side to watch Sherlock shed the rest of his clothes. Sherlock knows he's seen the scars, but he doesn't ask, and he's thankful for that. It's almost palpable, the way John's eyes follow his every move, and he feels the atmosphere change into something calmer and more reverent than before. All of this means
He gently nibbles at Sherlock's upper lip, and Sherlock huffs and runs his thumb along the shell of his ear. John can feel him smile a little into their kiss.
"Yeah, baby," I pant into the damp heat burning my lips. "I love it… I love you…" His legs begin to shake, and I find that my nervousness has almost entirely disappeared. His responses are proof that he likes this, and I want more of them, and stronger ones, right now. "
His feet carry him through the deserted streets, and he lets himself be guided by chance. He doesn't have anywhere particular to go. There's nowhere he wants to be. His flat is a run-down, bleak place, and he uses it to shower and sleep and sit and look into space. He doesn't
He stops and slumps further back in his chair, burying his face in his hands. He looks drained. John doesn't know how to approach him – despite giving this spectacular declaration of love only seconds ago, he seems miles away right now. And he still hasn't acknowledged the role John, his supposedly best friend, played in the mess they ended up in after Mary's death. Most of it was John's fault. Sherlock needs to accept that.
Sherlock can tell that he's very nervous, his straight-forward way of initiating things notwithstanding, but even through his boxers it's apparent that his cock is standing proud, and thick, demanding attention, and it's all so different from seeing him step out of the shower or walk around in his underwear when they still used to live with each other, because now it's for him, all for him, to see and touch and explore, and he's determined to savour every second of this.
"He works, Sherlock." Mycroft sounds slightly irritated now. "He goes to the pub. He lives. What do you want me to tell you?"
He calls again two days later, and this time, there’s Mycroft in the background, too. They’re bickering.
" Sherlock whimpers and throws back his head, his back arching, his hips bucking into the touch. "Oh!"
Sherlock steps towards him, but stops before he reaches him, leaving a careful bit of space between them.
There are a million thoughts running through John's mind – he's furious with whoever it was that made Sherlock sad, made him feel inadequate and alone, and he's a little upset with Sherlock, too, for allowing people to do that to him, but he's also resolved not to be one of them and show Sherlock that the things he obviously wants to experience are not out of his reach. Far from it.
“I’ll let you do pretty much anything to me if you ask like that,” he jokes softly. “Where--- I mean--- I never knew you did… all this.”
He tongue-kisses the hollow of Sherlock’s neck and then bites down on the tense tendon vanishing into the collar of his shirt. Sherlock moans again.
confused. But--- I've been falling for you for the last year and a half, Sherlock. Maybe it started even earlier. I---
I rise onto my elbow and for a moment my eyes meet Holmes’, which are mirroring the panic settling in my chest.
“Listen, Sherlock, I’ve killed people, okay? I’ve killed people who were evil, but I've also killed people who were just doing their stupid job. Please. I know what it feels like. And I know you can’t get through it on your own. I tried. But I needed you to come around and save me. Let me be the one who saves you now.”
He presses his lips together and moans lowly, pitifully, then shakes his head as if trying to clear it, obviously unable to pull back or do anything more than hold on to me, not pushing me, but merely keeping me at a distance that is still, as far as I am concerned, not at all
Sherlock is in pain – he can tell. He's sweating and twitching even in his sleep, his skin sallow, his lips dry and cracked. He looks like a mere shadow of himself, unable to think, to speak, to move. John knows that this can't be easy for a man who takes pride in having complete and flawless command of his body and mind at all times, for someone so brilliantly intelligent that sometimes the sheer speed of his own ideas gives him headaches.
"So--- what now? Are you moving back in with him? For how long have you been going behind my back, hm? Have you let him fuck you yet? I bet he'd
John closes his eyes and bites his lip, his brow knitting in what looks like concentration. He's gone very quiet by now.
They have a bath together, and Sherlock washes John and then tells him to kneel in front of him. He takes him into his mouth and
I spill myself in two, three long spurts, and the sensation is so strong that everything around me goes black for a moment. I've had a lot of sex in my time - but I've never had an orgasm like this.
"I'm sorry, John," he says, sounding more sober now. "I--- I'm not sure what's happening to me. It's late. Let's just get up and get ready."
Molly wraps me in her arms then and pulls me away from you, hugging me tightly, holding the back of my head.
before I told you about the plan. I was trying to protect you. I--- I don't know how else to explain this to you so that you'll understand! You're all that's important to me! I was only able to do what I did because I knew you'd be here, safe, waiting for me!" He’s losing his composure, and I’m almost happy that he is – it’s better than this cold, hard, disappointed voice. “And you said you’d wait for me! You--- you
Rosie wraps one arm around Sherlock’s as the other holds onto her ice cream, and John simply leans back and watches them.
– by accident or… on purpose. He tries to push it away, to wait until Sherlock tells him and it all becomes clear, and maybe it’s not that bad after all.
His chin quivers as if he wanted to cry, but then he just buries his face in his hands and heaves a dry sob.
killed anybody. And I--- I didn’t expect to be quite so affected by it. I knew there was no other way – Moriarty’s network had to be stopped, to be weakened, and we know that a normal trial would have changed nothing at all… They would have gone free, and it would have started all over again…”
He reaches behind himself and fumbles for the drawer of his bedside table and the bottle of lubricant hidden away in it, and then he finds it, his fingers closing around cold plastic, and everything seems much more real all of a sudden.
I don’t even have to force myself to cry. In the back of my mind scenes from our past flit by, one by one, showing me his smile, his laugh, his hands around my head, his eyes looking into mine. Our adventures replay themselves inside of me, and it hurts so much.
“When I said I was responsible for what happened to you today, I meant it, Watson,” he says, sounding almost as passionate as he did the moment I was shot. “It was
Mary is already in bed when John gets home, and he tiptoes through the flat making himself a cup of tea - trying not to wake her, he tells himself, but deep down inside he knows that it's just because he doesn't want to talk right now.
John snaps out of his stupor, leans forwards, and puts his hands around the younger man's face to make him stop talking.
“Tell me what you want,” he tells him lowly. “Tell me what you need. I’ll give you anything, Sherlock…
Rosie's waking up now. John can hear her roll around in her cot, babbling to herself, and he knows that she'll call for him soon. He sighs. It would be nice to have a few more days alone with Sherlock, just to sort it all out. Talk. Get to know each other as more than friends; see whether it’s any different now. Have sex whenever they want to, wherever they like.
“Proof that one should never assume to know everything about one’s fellow human beings,” he replies and walks over to where I am sitting. “Some things cannot be predicted or deduced. I knew it was unlikely for her to turn us in, but I never expected her to be so fundamentally underwhelmed by our news. And so supportive. And quite so…
So he allows himself to settle against his brother's shoulder and closes his eyes. Mycroft smells of laundry detergent and cigarettes and cold night air.
Sherlock huffs. He's bantering with his brother out of habit, and usually it cheers him up by giving him some semblance of normality in these otherwise wildly unsteady times, but he's not in the mood today.
I’m slightly embarrassed by my inexperience, but he distracts me by dipping his tongue into my mouth to tease mine and rolling his hips in tight, fast circles, the friction on my cock almost too much, but still so, so good. I try to meet his thrusts and move my finger in the same rhythm, and I seem to be doing something right now, because he bites my tongue and then whimpers. His whole body is quivering.
," Sherlock wheezes, and John feels his thighs go tense when he pushes his heels into the mattress and arches his back and starts to buck in time with the shocks of pleasure rocking through him, and John just goes with it and moves with him and clings on for dear life, not sure anymore where he begins and Sherlock ends.
Sherlock is not sure what he's supposed to do. He's never been good at offering comfort and support, especially not in matters of, well, life and death. He doesn't have it in him. And now John has lost another person close to him, as if everything he's been going through lately hadn't been enough.
I am embarrassed by the basic obscenity of it the moment it happens, but Holmes, whose tears have dried up by now, hums a wordless encouragement and bucks against me in a clear invitation to move, to
John's hand goes slack, causing his finger to slip free, and he just melts against Sherlock, turning to liquid in his arms within the blink of an eye. Heat is spreading from his lower body into his arms and legs, making them tingle pleasantly. This is amazing. This is nothing he has to be afraid of. He closes his eyes and focuses on the sparks of pleasure flitting through his nerves, his cheek resting on Sherlock's upper arm, his mouth so close to his jugular that he can feel the other man's excitement pulse against his lips.
John raises his head, and they look at each other, nose to nose. Sherlock seems very young all of a sudden. There's longing in his eyes, and panic, and something that John can't read, something that makes him look breathtakingly beautiful.
Holmes is fitting himself against my front, his lithe body warm and firm in my arms, and we moan against each other’s mouths when our groins collide for the first time, separated by decidedly too many layers of fabric. There is a very definite bulge tenting Holmes’ trousers already, and I, excited by the knowledge that it is
Mycroft's cold, reptilian smile falters as he looks into his younger brother's eyes, and Sherlock wonders what it is that he’s seeing there. Mycroft leans down to grab Sherlock's upper arms, and with a small grunt he hauls him into a sitting position. Sherlock groans, but complies. He knows his brother is not going to go away, and he’s
“No, Sherlock,” I sigh and brush his hair off his forehead. “No. There’s no need. I’ll see you soon. Okay?”
"Peter. Please, don't." It's Rosie, making her way over to them down the garden path, pulling her cardigan tightly around herself against the cold and talking over him. "Let's go inside. Alice and I have made tea. We can all warm up a little, okay?"
When Sherlock's free hand slides up his arm and neck and into his hair, leaving a trail of gooseflesh in its wake, John is flooded with relief and arousal in equal measures. He sucks Sherlock's plump bottom lip into his mouth, between his teeth, and bites down a little, and Sherlock shivers against him and utters a stuttering groan, his voice rough and deeper than John has ever heard it sound before.
Another bath, John washing Sherlock's bald head with his favourite shampoo. Candles. Resting in each other's arms. Breathing together.
“Yes. Ever since the two of us got involved, I’ve been feeling… new things. I don’t know how to express it. I’m afraid that I’m not able to limit my indulgence in sentiment to the degree I had planned to, which is to say… I can’t allow myself feelings when it comes to you and ignore the rest. That’s apparently not how it works.”
deserve better. It would be a lie, and we both know it. I'll always be this girl's father, and I want to support you in raising her. If you need help, I'll always be there. I want to be a part of her life, and I really hope you'll let me. But I can't live with you and play a role, and force you to play along. I just can't."
, and Sherlock fights to keep looking at the two of them, at John's chest, which is rising and falling rapidly, and at his own face, at his slack, panting mouth, his sweaty forehead, his glassy eyes.
John groans, trying to get lost in the feeling, but suddenly the curls he's carding his fingers through change in texture and length, and as he looks down, taken aback by how
"When will you travel on?" Mycroft finally asks, and Sherlock is grateful that he's steering their conversation away from his weak spot.
Mrs Hudson gasps in the background, and as if everything wasn’t fucked up enough already, that’s the precise moment the Chief Superintendant enters the room.
I grab my t-shirt from where it’s lying on the floor behind me and wipe my hands with it, and then I dab it against his cock to clean at least some of the come off his skin. He shivers and purrs deep inside his chest.
It doesn't hurt as much as he expected it to, and the pleasure John gives him soon eradicates the pain.
John's hands ball into fists without him telling them to. He breathes deeply, consciously trying to stay calm. Losing control won't help now – but he's determined to make the other man
He huffs and turns, then draws me against himself and helps me to get into a comfortable position, his arm wrapped around me, his hand in my hair, petting and stroking me in a surprisingly calming fashion.
I stare at his name engraved in black marble. There are no dates. I didn’t want to add them, and, as strange as it sounds, Mycroft agreed – it would have been a bad omen. He’s not dead. He’s lost in darkness as black as his gravestone, at least to me, but he’s still alive.
Rosie hiccups and whimpers, but stops sobbing, and after a minute or two Sherlock feels her settle more heavily against him, her breathing evening out.
. You are so much more than--- than cheekbones or curls. When I slept with you, I always made love to
"What do you want me to say, John? That it's alright? That we'll figure it out? I'm fucking pregnant with your child!"
“Then it will have been worth it,” I interrupt him, tightening my grip on his face. We are in this together, and I need to make him see that I would do anything just to know him mine. “If it happens despite all our best efforts to protect ourselves, then it will have been worth it to me. Even if they take me tomorrow, I will have had this night. Nothing they could do to me would ever make me regret having you here with me.”
Sherlock was so tired, was hurting so much that it didn't fully register with him what doing all that might imply, but when he came back to his senses and found himself in a locked room in a rehab clinic in what looked like rural Scotland, he
“Solving crimes won’t be enough. One day he’ll cross the line. Now, ask yourself, what sort of man would kidnap those kids just so he can impress us all by finding them? I'll tell you - your
, a knot of lust tightening inside of him, ready to unfurl, to explode. Sherlock's breath is loud and warm against his temple, and his fingers are in his hair now, carding through the short strands, pulling a little from time to time.
"Sherlock," John says warningly. "We're really not doing this now. My battery has to survive until tomorrow – who knows whether we'll need to make a call or something."
"Good morning," he answers in a low murmur, not daring to disturb the serene mood of the moment by raising his voice. "Were you watching me in my sleep?"
that fills him whenever Sherlock is close by is still there. He thinks about what happened during the years Sherlock was away, and he's still ashamed of the visions that kept assaulting him during his long, lonely nights, but he also allows himself to wonder if they mean that the feelings he's consciously experiencing now have been there
I lean down until I can reach his mouth with mine, and we kiss. It’s slow and loving and so familiar that I can’t believe this is only the third time we have sex – in real life, at least. I feel so at home with him.
“I want you to know what I want you to do without having to tell you. I want to--- I want to be able to let go when we’re together. I don’t want your guilt, and your apologies, and you don’t need to treat me like I’m--- I don’t know, an invalid or something. I’ll need time to rest, to process what happened to me, yes – but I’m not going to break.”
Most days, John can hardly follow Sherlock's rapid-fire monologues once he gets going, and even normal conversations can lean towards the exhausting, what with his posh vocabulary and all, but now it's monosyllabic sentences, apparently, and John
I’m happy about that, since it will give us more time to concentrate on each other before all media hell breaks loose. He’s still famous, and coming back from the dead will make him the focus of interest for the weeks to come. The later that happens, the better.
Our erections bump against each other, and we're both leaking already, and it's so, so good. So incredibly, mind-numbingly good. He bites my nipple, and a flash of heat shoots down my back and right between my legs. I'm shaking all over.
John doesn’t move all that much, just keeps him in his mouth and sucks as if his life depended on it, with no discernible technique involved whatsoever, and it's
calls, two of which ended in phone sex, which was, in itself, not a bad thing, but definitely not enough. It’s all far from enough.
When John comes back to his senses, Sherlock is by his side again, wiping his stomach with a tissue, a loving look in his eyes.
John grins and clambers over Sherlock’s long leg to lie down beside him again. The other man presses himself against his side immediately, not leaving an inch of air in between, and pushes his face into the crook of his neck.
appear frosted, John – although you might want to look at them again when I'm in my sixties. My family's medical history shows a predisposition towards cataracts."
. Moriarty was sick, a monster. He was brilliant at what he did – you’re right about that. But he didn’t win over you. You’re still here, and yes, you won’t break. You’ll emerge on the other side, stronger than before. I’ll see to it. I’ll be beside you. If you fall, I’ll help you up. Again and again, as often as you need me to. Always.”
He did. He went to hell, and he's still there, and it didn't even need Mary's encouragement, because he'd made the decision long, long before she told him to. Without John,
“Hey, you,” John says, smiling at him. “What’s all this?” As he takes a step closer, he notices two glasses of red wine on the floor right next to Sherlock.
, and it's always all or nothing with him, isn't it? He asks himself whether that will hold true for other things as well, things that are bound to follow this kiss, but reins himself in before he can get carried away by his fantasies. This is real, and it's going to be perfect, whatever they end up doing.
Sherlock glances at the air cushion the Homeless Network has set up to catch him. Somewhere down there is Mycroft, supervising it all.
I go for a slow, but steady rhythm of in and out and use the same pace on his cock, careful not to push him too far – I don’t want him to come like this. He melts into the bed, moaning continuously now, and after a minute or so I think that he’s relaxed enough for some more. I wonder if I should warn him, but then decide not to – I remember what it felt like when he did it to me, and the surprise at the sudden fullness was part of the thrill for me back then. On the next thrust, I push my index finger inside of him as well, and his body opens up for me without any resistance.
He trails off, stammering, but he doesn’t know what else to say. He feels awkward all of a sudden, and he can’t remember the last time he felt awkward in Sherlock’s presence. The feeling is deeply unsettling.
"It’s alright, John. You said what you needed to say last night. I understand. It--- doesn’t have to change things between us. I’ll get over it. Don’t worry."
But this is John, and he doesn't know what John wants, and he's so practised in the art of self-protection that he doesn't allow himself the idea of ever going all the way with him.
"Oh God," Sherlock sighs hoarsely and finally slumps against him, boneless and limp, his arms and legs still slung around him, but much more loosely than before. "Oh John."
"I thought it was Moriarty," he says before Sherlock can speak again. "I thought he was back to finish us off. I was---
Sherlock moans, long and loud, and shivers through an aftershock, then pries his eyes open, obviously with difficulty, to return John's gaze.
It's so intense that he feels like he's being ripped apart, like it's tearing right through his middle, leaving him open and raw, and the liquid heat of his seed might as well be blood, might as well be his
"John, please." Sherlock's softly spoken words float over to him, caress the sore spot inside him. "Come, John. Please."
me…" Sherlock slurs and opens his eyes to find John's face and blink at him deliriously, his mouth open and gasping for air, his voice catching in the back of his throat as he speaks.
John moves his hands to the nape of his neck and runs his fingers through his hair from there, making his way up to the tender skin behind his ears, rubbing slow, soothing circles into his scalp. “I want to show you off to the world,” he whispers. “Look at my gorgeous, perfect man. He’s a genius. He’s beautiful, inside and out. He’s so strong, and so brave, and so fucking
He pulls me even closer and licks a long stripe up the side of my neck. His tongue is like velvet, and the air feels cool against the places it touched on its way.
He finds what he's looking for and finally has to let go of Sherlock to open the bottle and slick up his fingers, and as soon as he has moved between Sherlock's legs and put one of them on his left shoulder to give him better access to the place he needs to reach, it somehow becomes easier. The way Sherlock keeps looking at him is another level of sex in itself, and he administers a gentle bite to his calf, soothes the spot with a kiss afterwards, and then slips his fingers between his cheeks to circle his entrance.
He attempts to roll over to make room for John, but John reaches for his hip and stills him, and Sherlock complies without a word.
Sherlock pushes his nose into the dampness gathering at the back of John's neck and inhales deeply, fills his lungs with the pure essence of the man he loves, has
"Hey. I--- I won’t keep you long. I just wanted--- I didn’t want to leave without saying goodbye. And… without telling you that I--- that this was the most beautiful night, and morning, I should say, that I’ve ever had. Thank you. And I’m sorry I'm being such an arsehole about it. You--- you deserve better."
Sherlock sucks harder at that and moans around him, his fingers squeezing John’s in a light, but insistent grasp.
He raises his head and kisses my collarbone before melting against me again, and I hold on to his upper arm and run my other hand through his hair, caressing his scalp. He hums tiredly.
John blinks and holds up his hands to shield himself from the blinding beam of light, and Sherlock laughs and obeys, aiming at his own face from below instead.
He forgets the world around them as soon as his lips close around Sherlock's shaft, its silky hardness and musky taste all that he can focus on. Sherlock's thighs are trembling against him and he traps them with his upper arms to keep him from thrusting up and into his throat. He knows Sherlock enjoys being at his mercy, and he himself loves being in charge of how fast this is going to go.
I sound like a child, but I don’t care. His voice sounds incredibly soft and tender when he replies: "I don't know. I'm sorry."
He props himself up on his elbows. The expression on his face is a strange mixture of annoyance and despair.
He's surprised at himself for spelling it out in such a blunt way, because it has never happened like this before. John moans wantonly into their connection, thus intensifying his pleasure, and Sherlock feels himself begin to leak in response. He wants to stroke himself, make it mount, make himself come, but he doesn't reach for the hot, hard length of his erection, which is resting heavily on his belly, craving to be touched. It's not time yet. He wants it all, wants John inside his body, and from the way things are developing he deduces that today could be one of
Before Rosie can start her usual (and often rather noisy) wake-up call, John gets up, stretches, and walks over to her cot to pick her up. She beams at him, and his heart melts, and he immediately feels guilty for wanting more time on his own.
John growls and sucks harder, building up saliva to make the up-and-down slide of his lips on the other man's length slick and easy, and Sherlock cants his hips upwards and groans, his hand coming down to caress John's beard. John pinches his nipple and rolls it between his thumb and index finger as he keeps bobbing his head, and Sherlock loses control.
Sherlock holds up a file and I take it, my fingers brushing his, causing my heart to stutter. I glance at the newspaper snippets attached to the folder.
The ugly monster of regret uncoils inside his guts and wraps its poisonous tendrils around his heart, and he wishes he was a braver man. He wishes he hadn’t been so scared of going for what he really wanted all along, for what he realised he
Wilkes wants updates on the case, and John believes him when he says that he's scared it might be him next, but he also strongly suspects that he simply wants to know more about how they live and have a good look around his old fellow student's place.
"I think this is the first time in all of our acquaintance that you ask me for food. I normally have to pester you to eat."
"Are we wasting this day, John? Sitting here, watching TV? Should we be doing… more?" he asks, his words muffled by John's skin.
After getting the small tin of petroleum jelly from my kit and putting it on top of the bedside table, I get into bed with him and we end up in a tangle of limbs beneath the covers, kissing again. He is beyond delicious.
“It is not half a life,” I whisper into his ear once we are settled beneath the duvet, sharing his pillow. “It is a life with you, which makes it as perfect a life as I could ever have wished for. No matter what the world will become. Inside these rooms, it will always be
such a thing) of separation stretching out before us, and I don’t want to miss my chance to tell him everything I need him to know before I leave.
He lost his erection halfway through their conversation, but despite the lingering feeling of unease sitting in his stomach it's coming back to life quickly now, and Sherlock is slightly alarmed at how much this is still turning him on. Is it John taking what he wants, and roughly, that excites him so? Or is it himself telling John to do it, showing him yet again how to find his pleasure in him and disregard all the guilt and shame attached to it? Is it the pointless thrill of defying a dead man and his twisted beliefs?
I feel myself grow hard against him, and he seems to notice, because he groans lowly and adjusts his hips so that they press against mine. His erection is straining against his trousers, and I can feel its heat even through three layers of fabric. His naked chest is heaving against my pyjama-clad one, and I move one of my hands to his front and brush my thumb across his nipple, feeling it stiffen at the touch.
eyes now, because he closes his mouth and just stares at him with an expression of intent curiosity written all over his face.
"I'll use my hand instead," John tells him as he caresses down Sherlock's front, tracing his ribs with his fingertips. "I love touching you…"
They're hugging now; he can tell. Sherlock is breathing through his nose, loudly, the way he does when he's in pain, and Rosie has started to sob into his shirt.
Mrs Hudson saves me from having to make a decision by squeezing his forearm and saying: “Whatever it was that you did – you did it because there was no other way. You’re the best, the
“We’ll get that afterglow eventually,” I tell him and put my hand on his cheek. “Let’s save it for next time.”
The decision is taken away from me by a deft knock at the door. It’s Mary’s day shift today, and a moment later I hear her open the door for my next patient. I glance up from my papers and see a tall, apparently very sniffly man in a black jumper with the hood pulled up shuffle in behind her. He’s wearing sunglasses. Maybe just hungover, then.
“I can’t help but notice you’re really good with words,” I rumble, giving my voice an edge of suggestive provocation. “What else can you do with that mouth of yours…?”
When he's finished, he puts on a fresh pair of pants and a t-shirt and lies down on the bed. He picks up the bottle of water on the nightstand and empties it in three large gulps. It's quenching his thirst, but he wishes he had something stronger than that to take the edge off the pain and help him sleep.
He's still holding on to John's hand, making no move to let go. John is so very, very okay with that.
“Mrs Hudson,” he says softly. “We do not want you to jeopardise your own safety for us. As our confidant, you might be charged with conspiracy if we are found out.”
When they break the kiss, John seems more relaxed, and Sherlock grinds his hips against him in a slow, teasing circle, making their bollocks slip against each other and sending shivers down his spine. John needs more pleasure to help him forget the pain, and he'll make sure he gets it, whatever it might take.
“I--- Well, what about--- protection, for example?” Sherlock rambles on, sounding increasingly distressed. “Do we talk about that beforehand, or during? Or--- How--- How are we going to---
Sherlock shudders and rolls his hips to bump his hardness against John's in a clear demand for more.
"He's probably stopped looking by now," Sherlock eventually states in a low voice, making no move to let go of John.
that my father is dead!" John says shrilly. "I've just slept with a man whose affection I don't deserve… because I
It doesn't happen often, but when it does, there's no stopping it. I lose control. My breathing accelerates, my blood starts to rush through my veins, and my heart stutters in my chest. I feel light-headed. My loins burn at the mere thought of him when I'm being weak like that, and I have to,
But before John can respond, Rosie comes bouncing into the room. “Daddy! Papa!” she says in awe. “You two look so, so handsome! Like proper movie stars!”
And a few moments later, Mrs Hudson's worried voice, and then her face above him, shocked, disbelieving.
In the dreary afternoon light his eyes look stormy-grey like the sky outside, speckled with flecks of gold, and John can see honest hope in them.
Sherlock smiles again and pulls John's left hand towards himself to kiss it. John tries to stop it from shaking harder at that, but fails. Sherlock presses his lips against his knuckles, then against his palm, and holds it tight.
I’ve made up my mind. I get up and walk around the table until I’m standing right beside him. He looks up at me and puts down his cutlery.
Slowly, he pulls away and sits up so that John comes to rest halfway on his front, one of his legs still pulled up to give Sherlock access to his behind. He hides his face in Sherlock's pillow and takes a deep breath to calm himself. He knows Sherlock is right. He doesn't want this to end here, either.
Living with Sherlock has turned his world around, even though it's all far from what any person in their right mind would call
I set my empty cup back onto its saucer, and the low tinkling of china seems much too loud amidst the tense silence surrounding us. He watches me, and I can see the vein on the side of his neck pulse quickly. His heart must be beating very fast; I want to put my palm on his chest and hold it in place.
He opens one cuff first, then the other, stroking the delicate skin at the insides of Sherlock’s wrists and enjoying the soft beat of his pulse against the pads of his fingers.
"Did you sleep well?" John asks. "I've been trying to keep her from crying so as not to disturb you."
, and I go down on him as deeply as I can, suppressing my gag reflex when he comes close to hitting the back of my throat. I'd never manage to swallow him, not until he teaches me how, anyway, but I want to make an effort.
"This is about us, now," he answers, trying to keep his voice light and still show Sherlock that what he's telling him is more important to him than anything else. "No more proving things to others, or to ourselves. I'm glad we ran into that arsehole acquaintance of yours, I really am, because it set this whole thing in motion, but… it's not about that anymore. All I want to prove now is that---"
“Take me--- into your mouth,” I answer breathlessly, my hands gripping the sheet I’m sitting on. “Please,
He takes a bite of his own toast and grins at me, and I snap out of my musings and wonder whether I've been staring, and whether he's noticed.
happy, and amazed when he looks at the printouts showing his daughter's tiny body and her tiny, perfect face.
They are quiet for a while, safe in each other's arms, and the tension crackling in the air around them dissolves slowly.
I tug at the smooth strands winding around my fingers, pulling him off me, and he follows, his lips making a small kissing sound as they part with me.
His whole body shudders and he rolls onto his front to give me easier access, pulling one of his knees up, exposing himself without shame.
“Well… I guess your voice just has that calming effect on everyone who happens to be in the vicinity… when you go full bedtime story mode.”
"Come here," John whispers after opening it, and suddenly it really does feel like a first time, no routine whatsoever, everything new and exciting and a bit frightening, too.
I move my hand to his front and gently roll his bollocks in my fingers, enjoying their weight and tender plumpness resting in my palm.
John wants to be annoyed at or at least disappointed by this sudden interruption, but even as his libido waves a sad little goodbye to the idea of imminent completion, he finds himself falling for the eager way Sherlock looks at him, his cheekbones flushed, his eyes alert and twinkling with what John knows is the glee of having had an epiphany.
He's not what you'd call comfortable with that particular aspect of his own sexuality anyway, and it's always been a safer bet to just stick to women when trying to satisfy his bodily needs – it's much easier to not confront himself with an identity he's not yet sure how to deal with. The fact that he enjoyed the occasions on which he threw caution to the wind and went home with a man, enjoyed them
He has gone limp, his muscles quivering everywhere we touch. His breath comes loudly, enters and leaves his lungs in broken gasps and sighs. I kiss him on his shoulder, sloppily and with my eyes still shut, and his skin tastes of white heat and passion. I find myself wanting to sample him all over again, right now, but although my spirit is willing, my flesh is weak. I can hardly move, as all my joints seem to have turned into some form of soft putty, and pulling out of him and rolling onto my back alone takes up all my remaining strength.
Sherlock nods, his hand stroking up and down John's spine, teasingly skimming the very top of his buttocks now and then. John leans into him and speaks right into his ear, making sure to brush the tender skin there with his lips in the process.
His jeans, already sitting low on his hips, are next. His penis is rather large, and very hard. I can tell from the bulge in his navy pants. They're tight. He doesn't take them off, keeps what is hiding inside a secret for now. He's barefoot already.
“I’ll leave you two alone now,” Mrs Hudson tells him. “I’m sure you’ve got so many things you want to talk about. But call me whenever you need something, dear. Anything. Okay?”
He cleans himself quickly, not lingering to recall John’s hands sliding down his sides and up his legs, not daring to imagine his fingers in his hair, pulling gently. He knows his body can unlearn the longing for another person’s touch, can delete it just like it did before, when he decided that if it wasn’t John, it wouldn’t be anyone. It will take some time, but he’ll get there in the end.
John shivers from head to toe, then reaches down and does as he’s asked. It’s a strangely unfamiliar sensation, given that he's done it before, but not uncomfortable enough to make Sherlock want to stop, and he knows that he’ll feel better in a moment, as soon as John is all the way in, as soon as he starts to move. It will be so much better then. The best thing he’s ever felt.
“I, too, am not a man of words, my dear boy. And I've always known that I am not a man of sentiment, either. You, and you alone, are the exception to that rule. From the day I first set eyes on you, you’ve held my heart in your hands - a heart I had never known I possessed until you came and showed it to me. I tried to fight it, to push it away, but each day with you only made it harder to resist. I told myself it had to be a very strong case of companionship. Of course I would be likely to misinterpret the feeling for something else, something much deeper, and more confusing - after all, I had never had a companion before. You fascinated me. Charmed me. You were a marvel to me, a mystery. I quickly found out that you are the only person in the world I cannot fully deduce. All the layers of wit, of personality, of loyalty, and strength. All the complexity you hide behind your calm and quiet exterior. I wanted to know it all, catalogue it, preserve it, be the only one allowed to see it. And eventually I had to accept that what I felt within myself was not simply companionship - or rather, that it was companionship of a kind that is too monumental to be described.”
on your cheek. You had a naked woman on your lap yesterday that you can't stop thinking of now. And your phone fucking
“At night, I’ll take you for a long walk along the beach,” I then say. “I'll explain the stars to you. And who knows, there might be a quiet spot where it’s just the two of us…”
"Yes," Sherlock mumbles, and John can tell he's doing his best to smile. "I am. You're here. That's all I need."
It seems like now we’ve got everything we need to get going, but that also means we’ll have to say goodbye soon.
John's heart is still stumbling over the fact that Sherlock – slowly and very much intentionally – brushed his fingers against his hand when he handed him a cup of tea, and he almost dropped his own at that, which would probably have resulted in some nice second-degree burns on his own feet and/or Sherlock's crotch. He caught himself in time and thinks he did a good job of pretending to be unfazed afterwards, but he can still feel the warmth of Sherlock's skin imprinted on his flesh.
On Thursday morning, John opens the door to 221B with his old keys (Sherlock never asked him to return them), but when he’s climbed the stairs and finds himself in front of the flat, he can’t bring himself to just enter.
Sherlock raises his head, which seems to take some effort, and finds Rosie lying between them, and for a second John sees something like panic glint in the younger man's eyes. It’s gone before he can analyse it, and then Sherlock smiles back at him. It doesn’t look entirely convincing.
John lets him slip out and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand before shuffling his way up the bed until he comes to rest next to him again.
When Sherlock's breathing grows heavy and his fingers make their way into John's hair, John forgets why he was scared.
"Are you proud of me, dear?" Mrs Hudson asks. "Watching you make your deductions for all those years has finally paid off."
And even though the man responsible for it all can no longer be held accountable for his actions, there will be peace at last.
I step closer and sit down on the edge of the mattress, and he makes room to let me move right in front of him, pulling at my calves and thighs until I’m in the perfect position for what I’m sure will be an amazing blowjob. I’ve already had a taste of those lips two years ago, and I want more.
I laugh deliriously, exhaling a hot puff of air onto his skin, which makes him shudder and moan. Not for one second did it occur to me that he might be uncomfortable with this kind of intimacy, or that, after this long and exhausting day, this might not be the most hygienic of activities we could be engaging in. I frankly do not care if he washed himself - I want all of him, skin and sweat and semen, want to know his most secret places, want to worship every square inch of his beautiful,
“It’s okay, John. There’s nothing unusual in that. That’s the way he made everyone feel,” she says, and, after a small pause: “All the marks on my table; and the
He forgets that quite quickly, though, because Sherlock’s tongue is undulating against his frenulum now and he’s started to make rumbling sounds in the back of his throat, each of which is taking on a life of its own and wrapping itself around John’s flesh to mercilessly draw him towards his release. Not long, now.
John still doesn’t understand why he’s only telling him now. What would have been so bad about sharing this?
John kisses back, slowly at first, but then gradually coming alive next to him, grabbing his upper arm and digging his thumb into his biceps, making tight circles, his mouth open and panting and hot, demanding,
John grimaces, looking desperate with himself. But at least he's stopped crying. They can fix this, Sherlock thinks. They
But I can't concentrate on that divine feeling yet. I'm still gaping at him. I thought I'd been less obvious.
And once everyone’s had a chance to say goodbye, there’s only Rosie. She gazes up at Sherlock, her smile bright, not saying a word.
Sherlock presses his lips together tightly, and for a moment John wishes he hadn't asked. He's not sure he'll be able to handle the reply.
I have to break off and grind my teeth to stave off my completion. I will get him there first, if it is the last thing I do.
Sherlock smiles back breathlessly, and John drowns in the sight and his brain shuts itself down again. He keeps looking up and tries to tease a bit, moving up and down slowly while undulating his tongue against every sensitive spot he can find (he knows them all by heart), but soon Sherlock mewls pitifully and bucks up as far as John's body weight allows him to, and suddenly the idea of a morning quickie, such a perfectly ordinary thing, seems weirdly alluring to John.
John swallows the chuckle threatening to escape his throat. He thinks it’s incredibly sweet that Sherlock’s inquiring nature doesn’t even quiet down in the most intimate of moments, but he doesn’t want his friend to feel mocked, so he just looks down at him and smiles.
"I'm fine. And yes, the item can be ticked off. My time down under seems to be nearing its end, and I can't say I'm sorry. This kind of heat in November is simply tedious."
He's off his meds now, and sometimes he eats. John cooks him whatever he asks for, whenever he wants, and wishes for his hair to grow back, because Sherlock misses it so much, but he knows that there won't be enough time for that. Sherlock is too proud to wear a wig. At least he's still got his eyebrows and lashes - "Otherwise I'd look like Voldemort," he used to joke when he still thought that he could beat it, and that they'd be okay.
floating around, but only because she wants to watch what Sherlock and John are going to do next, now that their job here is done. She wishes she could follow them to London, just to see how well that
I breathe him in, thinking about the obstacles lying before us and trying to ignore their existence for the time being.
John hums once more, lowly, almost soundlessly, and licks him clean with slow, careful swipes of his tongue, taking care not to turn the aftershocks that he senses are running through Sherlock's system into unpleasant over-stimulation.
Sherlock doesn't react. John holds him, caresses his skin, keeps him warm. He doesn't allow sadness to come.
There's moonlight shining through the open window and John can make out billowing curtains – maybe a cat got in, or some bird, he thinks. Maybe it's nothing.
I bury my fingers in his hair and pull lightly to show I understand, and he grunts and lets go of my hands to put his palms on my thighs again.
He leans forward and caresses the underside of my penis with his bottom lip in one long, tantalising, barely-there stroke. It’s teasing, torturous
He pushes his knees into the mattress to get some leverage, which changes his angle ever so slightly, and the effect of this tiny movement is so monumental, so
Their foreheads slip-slide against each other, their sweat mingling, prickling on Sherlock's skin, and then John kisses him again, deeply and completely without system, and speeds up his pace. It's tight and wet and messy and the best thing that has ever happened to him, and when he hears someone utter a high-pitched, drawn-out,
Only one time, about two weeks after the dreams had started, he allowed himself to give in to it. It was a rainy Sunday morning and he'd woken up with a raging hard-on, and when he reached down to do something about it, Sherlock was suddenly right there with him, whispering into his ear, running his hot tongue along his neck, then down to his nipples, and John, still half-asleep, just went with it. He drew it out, imagining Sherlock's hands all over his skin, his cock, and then he climaxed, and it was so good, so much better than anything he'd ever done on his own before, and it disgusted him so much that he swore to himself he'd never do it again.
It was a first time for both of us – my first time with a man, and your first time ever. I was so proud to be the first one you shared yourself with. The only one.
Sherlock leans forwards and makes their mouths collide, and they kiss like they used to do when they were young and their love was fresh and new and all-consuming, all tongues and teeth and
The cool night air clears his mind a little, and he starts to walk. He feels like an arsehole for what he's just done.
. You’re here with me. I know why you had to go away, I really do, but I’ll never let you go again. And I--- I’m sorry I was so focused on my own pain that I forgot about yours. I know I can’t take this back, but please… let me make it right.” I lean forward until I can smell his skin, his hair, my palms flat on the mattress, so close to his body that I can feel the heat radiating off him. “Please let me touch you. Please. I don’t know how else to--- I don’t know how---”
He chides himself for getting caught up in thoughts of this kind – it's a natural process and can't be helped, and they've still got time. They're healthy, and they're together. And although his body doesn't look the way it did twenty years ago, his most potent tool and weapon is still his mind, which is still working as fast and flawlessly as ever. There's nothing to worry about.
It's easier than he's anticipated – Sherlock leans back and lifts his hips, baring his long, white neck in the process, and John finds himself
"Please let me go," he says lowly, fighting to stay calm, and tries to pull away, but John's grip is strong, and he uses his free hand to pull down Sherlock's trousers a little further and expose his left hip.
John, lying beneath a pile of blazing wood, struggling to free himself. Choking on smoke. Blistering skin, screams, panic-widened eyes. The smell of burning hair, burning flesh. More screaming. John's voice calling out for help, for someone to save him, for Sherlock,
Sherlock blinks at him, the smirk fading from his face, replaced by a weird mixture of pride and self-consciousness. They each take a sip, staring at each other over the rims of their glasses, then put them aside again.
Sherlock takes his time mapping out John’s mouth, his teeth, his tongue, the insides of his lips. It’s delicious, better than anything John has ever known before, and even as he gets lost in the other man’s gentle ministrations, he finds himself hoping that they’ll never lose this, this curiosity, this depth, this magic of their first real kiss.
Sherlock is hurting; John knows that very well, even though Sherlock makes every effort to bite back the pain when it washes over him, to be strong and not let on that it's getting worse by the day.
She nods, wordlessly encouraging him to speak, and suddenly something inside of him breaks open and words flow out of him, words he's never said to anybody, not even to Sherlock. Rosie doesn't know what happened when Sherlock "went away" for two years. She doesn't know, even though, hadn't it been for those two years, she probably wouldn't exist today.
, after understanding each other and each other's ways of dealing with the issues that were out of their hands at the time (going into hiding for almost two years; making wedding plans).
Sherlock says, in a tone so desperate, so unlike his usual one that John wishes he could record it just to show him its beauty later on. “Up.”
He doesn’t know how to explain what he did, so he gets up, pulls the napkin out of his breast pocket, and hands it to Sherlock. Then he takes a few steps away from his friend to stand next to the window and look down onto the street. He can’t bear watching this.
The looks that John used to praise, with his mouth and with his hands, whenever he glimpsed Sherlock naked or in any random state of undress. Whenever they made love. He remembers John gripping his hips, remembers his fingertips digging into his sweaty flesh and his blue, blue eyes, dark with passion, devouring him as they moved together, and he remembers the tender (or, depending on the urgency of his need, sometimes downright
do, Sherlock," he tells him, trying hard to regain some semblance of composure even though deep inside he's screaming. "I blame myself. And you should, too. Maybe you don't want to see it because it would hurt you too much, but I did wrong by you, Sherlock. You'd be right in leaving me, in throwing me out of your flat and your life. I--- I'm a terrible person. A terrible friend. You--- you deserve better than that. I'm--- so sorry.
He trails his hands down Sherlock's spine and then cups his buttocks to pull him even tighter against himself. He's so big, so very
“I have nightmares, John. Every night, every time I fall asleep. But usually I just wake up, find you next to me, and then go back to sleep. It’s going to be like that for a while. I--- I keep thinking about---”
At the tender age of six, Rosie has already perfected the art of button-pushing to a tee, and John is very aware of that. Sherlock’s lessons in reading body language only give her more ammunition to work with.
John is confused. Why would he feel guilty for something that happened to Sherlock while he was gone? Sherlock presses his lips together tightly and, with an abrupt movement that shows that he has to force himself to do it, lets go of John’s wrists. He swiftly turns around and shrugs off his shirt.
He caresses John’s scar, very tenderly, and then moves his mouth further down to mirror what John did to him earlier and lick around his navel. He’s so close to where John needs him now. So close.
Sherlock hums, and John is glad to hear him sound more like his old self now – pleased with himself and clearly amused, with a slight undertone of
Sherlock gazes at John's penis, which is still hard and now glistening with oil and semen, and puts his fingers around it to give it a tender stroke. John shivers and moans, his eyes closing in bliss.
"At the risk of making this even weirder for you…" John says and brushes some stray locks of hair off Sherlock's forehead. "I don’t think she knows that she has--- had a mother. She was so little when it happened. She’s been living with the two of us for so long now that she probably thinks--- well, that she perceives us as her---"
We snog a few times, but it never goes any further, and I’m okay with that. I’ll let him set the pace for this – he’s the one who’s injured, both with regards to his body and his mind, and I don’t want to overwhelm him. He’ll let me know when he’s ready for more.
He turns onto his good side and his lids flutter shut without him telling them to. His body is tired, even though his mind is reeling.
I stare at the pretty new nurse (Mary?) with what I’m sure is a ridiculously idiotic expression on my face, but her question has caught me completely off-guard.
“Yes.” Rosie smiles up at John, and then over at Sherlock. John notices a look of concern flash over her features. “Papa?” she asks.
“I love--- doing this to you…” he presses out after a while, and I can’t help but admire his stamina. His command of his body is marvellous, his rhythm perfect. There's a fine sheen of sweat glistening on his skin now, and I run my hands down his spine until I can cup his arse.
They've talked it all through, time and time again, and John is glad. He's made his decision, and he's felt a lot calmer ever since.
I’ve been thinking about that, too. Won’t it be suspicious to keep the flat exactly as it is? How long can one be
“Moriarty might still surprise us. I never expected Richard Brook. Who knows what else he’s got up his sleeve.”
John continues to thrust, feeling the tell-tale tug of his climax build in his loins and goes faster still, chasing it. He can’t answer. Can’t breathe. Can’t
His life is lying there in front of him, broken, shattered, and there's no light in the world anymore, no warmth. There's

right now, his fingers leave my cheek and he hooks them into the collar of my shirt to pull me down towards himself.
"Yes," he says, and this simple response seems much too trivial, given the enormity of the moment, but he's at a loss for words, and John probably doesn't know that he's just put his life in his hands, so it's okay.
From very far away, he thinks he hears John scream his name. But it's all happening so fast that he can't be sure.
“We’ll have to take her into our confidence,” I reply, just as quietly. “Without her protection, our secret will be out in no time at all. And we’re too well-known in society. We’ll have to take precautions. She loves you. She wouldn’t---”
“It’s alright…” he says lowly and pushes his head into John’s touch like a huge, cuddly cat. "I love how you let go."
“Yes. And I’d like to explain my reasons to you. Do you know what would happen if Sherlock stopped believing in your… let’s call it
Sherlock leans his forehead against the cold window pane and closes his eyes. All of a sudden, he feels tired. Drained. Everything hurts.
They do not talk, but it's an easy, pleasant silence, not unlike the ones they used to share regularly in the time before
I've never done anything like this before. I learned early on what my body needs, and then spent years ridding myself of these impulses. Until he came along… and it all began again.
"Come upstairs with me," John says again, his voice deep and thick like velvet and sweet, forbidden things. "I know where you were about to go, Sherlock. What you were about to do."
In John's chest, fear and daring are battling for dominance. This is all going so fast. Two years' worth of bottled-up emotions are sweeping over him, carrying a landslide of unsaid things in their wake, and they need to be said now now
"Oh God---" he moans when Sherlock teases himself with the pad of his thumb and clenches down on his fingers involuntarily as he does so. His imagination is running wild, sending a phantom sensation of slick,
) "When you--- When you checked my body for marks. When you searched the flat for drugs once a week. When Rosie was little and you were sleep-deprived and irritated. You got angry so quickly back then. But… it's better now, John. It really is. I'm comfortable around you now. I know you'll never--- I know it won't happen again."
John’s rumbling, slightly rough voice is caressing the sore spot that’s tainting Sherlock’s soul, and he feels his walls crumble.
Sherlock huffs. John is right. He can already feel the other man's release trickle out of him and run down the insides of his thighs.
She spits the last part, her expression filled with rage and condescension. It's not like her to speak like this, but John doesn't blame her for reacting the way she does. He deserves it for what he's doing to her.
” Sherlock then asks, his voice husky and rough, and by now there’s no use denying it anymore – this is Sherlock in seduction mode, no doubt about that.
“We don’t have to do it like that if you can’t,” he whispers, his eyes fixed on John’s. “But I loved your fingers inside of me.
, and then he feels Sherlock’s cock against his skin, hot and silky and very, very hard, and he can’t believe that he likes this so much. He’s not gay, not bi, has
---” I whisper frantically, and even lost in my ecstasy I know that I can’t scream his name the way I want to, or else Mrs Hudson will hear.
"One of these days, I'll manage to switch off your brain," he mutters and takes up position to Sherlock's left, taking hold of the frame as well.
John shrugs and allows his hands to slip from Sherlock's front to his back, bringing his arms around his waist as he does so.
His cockstand is located right in front of my eyes again, jutting out from a nest of dark curls, beautifully flushed and already wet at the crown, and I immediately give in to the impulse of wanting to taste him once more - simply because I can, now,
John snorts in response and throws his cushion at him, and he dodges it as he moves towards the door. They laugh.
to him, anything he wants. The sensation of his finger circling his entrance is exquisite, and he wants more, deeper,
"Yes, John. Thank you for this day. The fragments of our past… so many of them are connected to London. It was a good idea to go back."
“Well, I don’t see why you shouldn’t, then. Mycroft’s going to have to carry your suitcase, though. You’re not allowed to lift heavy things.”
“I’ll always love you,” I mumble when we part, my lids fluttering open again to find him gazing at me with so much serious, intense affection in his eyes that it takes my breath away. “Sherlock… I promise I’ll love you for the rest of my life.”
"Well… it worked. I loved your sand circles. I knew I wanted to be with you quite early on as well. I was too blind to see that this holds true for
They stay like that for an endless moment, Sherlock's head falling forwards again to rest against John's, their arms slung around each other tightly, fingertips pressing into wet skin.
Sherlock holds his gaze and rises to slip onto John's lap, giving him comfortable access to the places he needs to reach, and John supports him with his legs and slicks up his fingers, his grin turning into a slightly incredulous smile.
"I wouldn't be alive if you had known he was not dead," she says, and now there's something else in her voice – something hollow, something
I, having killed her mother? How can I presume the right to care for her, when I'm the reason why she's motherless in the first place? I'm--- I never wanted to get too attached. I--- I didn't dare to. I feel terrible because of it."
“The physical part is just a very pleasant bonus, Sherlock, a new facet of being with you. And I want to learn all about you in that respect too. And I don’t mean that in a sexual sense only – I want to find out if you like to cuddle, what you’re like the moment you open your eyes in the morning, if you enjoy public displays of affection or rather keep it behind closed doors… everything. I’m looking forward to finding out everything.”
He did, and when he got back, he found Sherlock standing by the window, Rosie in his arms, rocking her back and forth, talking to her in a low voice and kissing her blonde, downy head.
He nips at my bottom lip and pushes my shirt off my arms, then runs his fingers down my back. When his right hand slides under the waistband of my trousers and he dips his middle finger into the cleft between my buttocks, I growl and pull him against me, getting on my toes to grind our hips together. His half-open shirt allows me to feel his chest against mine, warm and smooth and slightly sweaty.
"I--- I've never really allowed myself to open up my heart to your daughter, John," he says, his voice shaking a little. "I--- I thought, how
One drink becomes two drinks, then three. We talk about Sherlock - something I haven’t done in ages, at least not like this. For obvious reasons I can’t talk to Molly about him and me, and Mycroft… well. It goes without saying.
It’s chaste and almost shy, but it leaves John trembling nonetheless. He knows that kissing him like this, in front of his daughter, is a huge step for Sherlock, even if she’s only a baby and doesn’t understand it yet.
Sherlock finds himself mortified by the situation, but wants to help him out regardless. His instinct to protect his friend from any harm has not died yet, despite everything that went wrong.
“I know,” John answers. “Or well… I guessed it. But the way you kiss, Sherlock… I think you’re doing great on your own there.” He grins softly and runs his nails down Sherlock’s scalp until he reaches the nape of his neck. “You couldn’t get any more gorgeous,” he adds.
We keep up our rhythm for a few more thrusts, shuddering through our climaxes together. My ears are roaring with the rush of blood to my head, so much that it almost makes me feel dizzy. When I finally stop thrusting, he turns his head to the side to glance at me over his shoulder, and the eye I can see is bright with something I haven’t seen in a long, long while. He’s happy.
His shoulders begin to shake as he is wrecked by silent sobs, and I get up from my chair and then lie down on my side next to him. He immediately nestles up to my front and pushes his face into the crook of my neck, hiding himself from the world that hurt him so much. I wish I could hold him tight, but that will have to wait, so I just caress his arm and the back of his head and let him weep.
Trembling fingers come up then to trace his ears and card through his beard, and he hears Sherlock swallow.
He goes harder, hips pumping, broken groans bubbling from his throat into Sherlock's sweat-slick skin, and Sherlock cants his hips to make the most of the way John's abdomen, taut with the strain of thrusting, moves against the underside of his cock, faster and faster, and he knows it's about to happen, any second now, any second---
“Who’s the impatient one now?” Sherlock asks when John has finally won the fight and pushed the smooth black fabric down his long legs, a little more forcefully than would have been strictly necessary.
When they part again, John has lost track of time, but he doesn’t care – he doesn’t have to be anywhere but here today, in fact he doesn’t have to do anything but
Slowly, Sherlock goes a little deeper, twisting his hand. It's burning, but it doesn't hurt - it's just
We don’t talk. I guess he needs to do this first. He cries himself to sleep, and when I check on him about fifteen minutes later, he’s so out of it that I can even put fresh bandages on his back without waking him again. He must have been exhausted.
My heart takes a leap, but then they unlock the cuff on his right hand and transfer it to my wrist instead, chaining us together.
Sherlock groans then, loudly, and suddenly changes his position on top of John to be able to suck at the side of his neck, and his stomach pushes against John's cock, taut with the effort of thrusting, and it feels so good that John can't help but sob in ecstasy.
"No. I want you to come." He pushes himself up on his elbows, then on his hands. "I want to make you come."
John grins against his lips and grabs him around the middle, then rolls them over in one smooth, controlled movement so that he ends up on top.
“John, I--- What about going back to the cottage right now and coming back here later? After the… midday heat is over?”
, Sherlock. I might have been overstaying my welcome in Narnia, but I’m nothing if not a willing – and fast – learner.”
There’s no use pretending anymore. John pulls her close and they hold on to each other, trembling with now very obvious fear.
it. If you can’t do that, you can’t be there. It also--- It might put too much of a strain on you, which I’d completely understand. You don’t
He worries about me. I soak it up like a sponge. On the outside, I press my lips together, giving myself an air of indifference.
This is insane. He doesn’t even know what he’s saying there, since he’s never had sex with a man. Has Sherlock?
asked him if he was alright. Not once. I asked about his physical wellbeing, yes, but I never considered the possibility that his soul might be suffering, too. I’d be a sorry excuse for a friend, and the fact that we’re supposed to be so much
He’s grunting, his deep voice so arousing to listen to, and I hear him speed up his strokes as well.
It's the most incredible feeling - it's all wet down there, and so hot, and the pressure of the barely-there intrusion is not uncomfortable in the slightest. It's divine, and he wants more. He
Sherlock doesn’t answer, but nips at his lips and slides his tongue into his mouth, and John opens up willingly, melting into his embrace. He hopes the kiss and whatever is about to follow it will distract Sherlock from the fact that the deduction he’s just made is probably completely correct.
) and I want to kick myself for not holding my tongue. I ran right into his trap, idiot that I am. I take a deep breath and put my hands on my hips.
"As a matter of fact, yes. Why not? We'll stay here until dawn – we might as well get some sleep. Or at least find some way to keep warm."
Sherlock misses a beat, but gets himself together again before his surprise at John's blunt way of announcing his sexual history can break his stride.
He opens his mouth to say something, but I pull him towards me and press a long, hard kiss on his lips to shut him up. He huffs into my mouth, but kisses back, and I run my fingers through his hair and pull his head back with gentle force to make him bare his neck. I kiss down the long line of his throat, feeling his pulse flutter against my tongue.
I gaze at his tousled hair and trail my fingers down his spine, and in my mind palace, a new room appears, sketches of John's perfect anatomy scattered all over the walls. The long muscles of his back, the dips between his vertebrae, the two dimples right above the soft swell of his buttocks.
It's warm and comfortable, lying next to him like this, with the other man's face so close to his own and his naked limbs brushing his side and thigh, heavy with sleep, and he allows himself to bask in it for a minute or two, telling his brain to shut up when it informs him that this won't last and that it will only hurt worse the longer he draws it out.
"You know, the worst thing about this is that you really believe what you're saying there. And people like that idiot Wilkes are responsible for that. If I could go back in time and find the person who started it all, who planted that thought in your head and then made it fester, I'd give them a good old talking to."  Sherlock frowns, but John raises his hand before he can say anything. "And yes, I know you don't need me to fight your battles for you. It was presumptuous of me to take that liberty. I see that now. And I apologise. I'm truly sorry, Sherlock."
It’s so good. As far as kissing goes, Sherlock seems to be an extremely eager learner. John finds himself imagining what else this mouth can do, and his cock grows hard again so fast that it makes him feel a bit light-headed.
Sherlock looks up and swallows. John puts the napkin down on Sherlock's desk and then takes the other man's head in his hands.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock suddenly talks over him. "I don't--- feel well." He sways and leans onto John more heavily. "
At home, an unpleasant task awaits me. I have to tell Mrs Hudson. She cries, and I take her into my arms and rock her back and forth. She’s tiny right now, all her usual flourish gone. I allow myself a few tears then, too, and I’m not sure whether I cry because I feel so sorry for lying to Mrs Hudson and hurting her so much or because I already miss Sherlock with such intensity that I’m afraid I’ll go insane.
John stops kissing him and pushes his face against the other man's neck to gently rub it with his beard, and Sherlock responds immediately, groaning under his breath and rutting against him with small, urgent thrusts.
"What about you?" she mumbles into his cardigan, and he dreads the words that will follow now, the shock, the incomprehension. "You--- where are you going to live? Will you--- be okay?"
, Sherlock. I should have been braver. I should have been a better man. A long time ago. Long before---"
"John," he addresses him softly, and he can tell that the other man has seen him, recognised him too, but when John raises his head and looks at him, his eyes are glassy and dazed.
Sherlock brushes his earlobe with his lips in a barely-there kiss. It’s tender and fleeting and yet, John can tell,
John lets out a long whine that makes the hair at the back of Sherlock's neck stand on end. John is breaking apart, and there is nothing he can do to prevent it. He feels helpless and hates himself for his inability to deal with this the way he feels he should.
“You give me much to think about,” I answer instead and step closer. “Are you well? Your behaviour strikes me as--- well. Curious. You seem miles away somehow.”
There’s no patience whatsoever involved in what we’re doing now. We’re mindlessly rutting against each other, like animals, going harder and faster the longer it lasts, but it’s alright. We both need it like this right now.
Sherlock is surprised, but obeys immediately, squeezing John’s flesh in his fingers and marvelling at how he can feel each and every thrust vibrate through the hot and sweaty body on top of him. John is speeding up his pace, grunting with the effort of it, and Sherlock imagines his fingerprints on John’s buttocks, red and burning, marking John as his even after all this is over.
"You're gorgeous," Sherlock breathes, and the sound of his own voice startles him – and John as well, apparently, because he gasps and opens his eyes again.
He does as he is told and spreads the slickness around his opening with slow, careful strokes of his fingertips, and I watch him and grind the heel of my hand against my hardness to give myself at least a little relief from the desire throbbing within my loins.
I glance over my shoulder. Mycroft is still sitting in my armchair, perfectly motionless. In the half-light, he looks like a sphinx waiting for a weary traveller to solve its riddle. I gesture in his general direction, feeling my jaw set into a stern expression.
His right hand wanders to my front and he strokes his palm up and down the underside of my cock with not nearly enough pressure, and I clench my teeth and will myself not to groan with impatience. My whole lower body is on fire, and he only intensifies the feeling when he uses his free hand to spread me open for him and his incredible mouth.
He’s always enjoyed looking at Sherlock, and maybe that should have made him think more than it did, and earlier. But there you are. It took him a long time to come to terms with what he feels for him, and even longer to finally do something about it. He regrets not seeing it sooner, and not having the courage to act upon it when he did.
"Okay," he breathes and then scatters a line of open-mouthed kisses along the waistband of his own boxers on John's body, ending with a gentle nip at his hip. His fingers knot into the expensive silk bunching up under his palms as he massages John's buttocks, learns how well they fit into his hands.
They've been so busy, what with moving to the cottage and making it a home while simultaneously working on cases, and now that they've been living here for almost half a year, things have only just begun to slow down.
“Can you at least come and take a look at the couple’s house? Look for some evidence we can use in court?” Greg asks pleadingly.
Sherlock, red-cheeked and panting a bit, turns his head to look behind himself. In a few graceful movements, he leans back to make a long arm and retrieve the required item without having to leave John’s lap, passes the bottle to John, and wraps his arms back around him.
I think of that now, as I sink into the water and feel it slosh around my thighs, my hips, my waist, my chest. I listen to its murmuring rush and let myself be lulled into a dreamy state.
It seems to take forever, but then, finally, they’re there, and John holds Sherlock very close and rocks him, ever so gently, back and forth in his embrace. His lids flutter open again.
"How?" he wants to know, swallowing hard around the lump of terror in his throat that's threatening to take his air away. "How can you know? What if--- What if it comes back? What if we have a fight one day and I do it again? What if you do something that upsets me and I lose control? How can you be so sure that you're safe with me?"
“You say this is a matter of life and death – give me the chance to decide how I want to deal with that! What if you die and I stay behind, never to know what happened? What if he kills you and I could have prevented it? Do you have any idea how that would make me feel? Do you even
Sherlock nods. His nose bumps against John's. He feels stunned, stupid, and slow, and at the same time finds himself lost and completely confused, his head going into overdrive trying to process what John wants, or thinks he does.
"Sher---" he starts, but Sherlock draws him in for a hard kiss that smothers the rest of his name before it can make it out from between his lips.
Sherlock seems to be genuinely oblivious to what John is trying to communicate, and John, aware that he'll have to
at all – even if he won't be able to really participate, at least not apart from giving Sherlock pleasure.
"I've put a lot of thought into this, Peter. And I'm aware that it's a selfish decision. It's okay if you hate me for it; I understand. But I can't go on without him. How many years would I have before my own deterioration is complete? Five? Would you like your daughters to remember me like that – lying in a bed in some old people's home, having to be fed and changed like a baby? Not knowing who they are? Because that's what would happen, Peter. I'm leaving with him, because it's the better alternative. I'm sorry for hurting you, Rosie, and the kids. It's the most terrible thing I've ever had to do. But I've made up my mind, and nothing you say will change it. And as for Rosie finding us – she has
It’s meant to be a warning, but he’s too late, and Sherlock doesn’t show the slightest inclination to pull away, so he supposes it’s okay.
“We have all the time in the world,” I try to reassure him. “You don’t have to reveal all of yourself at once if it’s too hard. I’ll wait. I’ll wait for as long as it takes.”
“Come,” I tell him and pull him up and along with me as I walk backwards towards the bed. “I would kneel on the floor if I could, but my leg won’t allow it, I’m afraid… This will have to do.”
"My hands missed touching you this time…" Sherlock whispers and does it again, memorising the feeling, before letting go and putting his arms around the shorter man to pull him close. John puts his cheek against his chest. "I love you too, John," Sherlock mumbles into his hair. "This was so beautiful."
When she finally meets his eyes, the look in them is raw and pained and hits him like a punch in the gut.
He doesn't stop until he's all the way inside, until his loins are pressing against Sherlock's buttocks, and they stare at each other in the mirror, drawing long, shaky breaths and groaning softly in between.
The man's voice keeps coming in waves, sometimes clearly, sometimes not more than a distant mumble. He must be making circles through the flat, walking up and down, passing the door every so often.
He looks paler than usual in the silvery light, and there's a fine sheen of sweat glistening on his forehead. John follows his gaze, his mind spinning. It's obvious that Sherlock is really convinced that his late wife has returned from the dead, just because – and now he can see it too – the woman in the painting shows a slight resemblance to her, and he's not sure how to react. This is a bit like at the pub in Dartmoor, but Sherlock wasn't panicking as much back then.
"Let me see," he tells John and turns around, and John puts his hands around his face and smiles up at him.
He imagines his brother smirk, amused by Sherlock implicitly admitting that yes, indeed, he's hurting inside today.
They don't talk about what happened in John's bed over breakfast. They just eat, and then clear the table, and then John plays with Rosie and Sherlock goes through their e-mails to look for new, interesting cases.
Sherlock tries not to let his expression betray him as relief and regret battle for dominance inside his heart.
"Just do what feels good," John says, his voice rough, and kisses him on the lips, then on his cheekbone. "Just---" He thrusts against him, aligning their erections, and moans deeply. "Like that."
"Lean back again," John says and lowers him back into the bath so that he can stretch his tense muscles.
---” he says lowly, breaking off when John pulls back and thrusts in again with a smooth, controlled movement. “Oh,
"You seem to be of the opinion that there's a deeper reason for my preoccupation with Irene Adler," Sherlock says carefully. "There isn't, John. I want to know what she's got, or what she knows, to make her such an interesting target for the Americans. That's all."
. He fought for a day and a half, and then withdrawal set in with vengeance, and that was when he stopped resisting and simply tried to stay alive. He didn't even want to, really – John was gone, so what was the point? His body, however, had different ideas, and its survival instincts were so strong that somehow, after almost two weeks of suffering, he emerged on the other side and found himself weak, but, and it took him a while to recognise the feeling for what it was,
"Getting tired?" he asks him softly, and Sherlock sighs loudly and opens his eyes to look at him again.
Sherlock lets him slide from his mouth and gives him a crooked smile. He’s panting ever so slightly.
"I'm alright," he replies, and really, his voice sounds firm. No trace of pain. His cheeks are flushed, and his gaze is clear. "I feel
scared, Rosie. I'm--- not finished. I need to tell him so many things, hold him, apologise to him for things I did in the past. I'm terrified I'll never get the chance."
Sherlock inhales shakily, a sound so sweet that John’s heart clenches in his chest, and then there’s warmth all around him, slick and tight and so,
Sherlock sucks in a sharp, surprised gasp at that, his eyes snapping open again, and John tilts his head to nip at his bottom lip.
,” Sherlock begs, and he can sense John slowing down, thinking, wondering what on earth could make his friend sound like this.
John catches her, kissing her on the cheek before setting her back onto the ground. “Hello to you, too, darling!” he says, frowning in mock disappointment.
This is so different from what I experience when I do it on my own. It's so much more, so much bigger. I'm losing my mind, and I don't even care anymore.
I listen to him inhale and exhale in a slow, steady rhythm, my eyes closed, my cheek pressed against my pillow, and imagine him in bed with me.
Sherlock starts to cry and hides his face in the crook of John's neck, bucking against him erratically.
He reaches out with one arm to pull the duvet up and over their naked forms to keep Sherlock warm. Then he pulls him closer again and shuts his eyes.
, but Sherlock is bored already, and in the evening the three of them have dinner and then Sherlock does the dishes while John reads Rosie a bedtime story, and afterwards John takes a shower and Sherlock decides that he's going to ask for it this time, before it gets worse.
"I should have known that your version of romance includes spending the night in a cold, empty mansion… without food. You never eat. It figures."
I’m too empty to make another sound. My tears are dripping on his clothes, making tiny dark spots on the navy blue silk.
Ever since John moved back to Baker Street, Mrs Hudson has been establishing the habit of coming over in the afternoons to make tea for "her boys" and sometimes have a chat. When John is out and Sherlock is busy with case work or one of his experiments, she stays quiet and just puts the steaming mug on the table or desk next to him and leaves. When Sherlock is alone, but unoccupied, she makes him sit down on the couch with her and they talk for a while - it's mostly small talk, superficial trivialities, but Sherlock knows that she's not doing it because she's interested in his take on London weather or the current state of the government (he doesn't know anything about the latter anyway). She's just checking. Checking if he's okay. Checking if he's still clean. And when John is around as well, Sherlock can't help but deduce that Mrs Hudson checks whether he's treating him right.
Tears are pressing against the back of his throat, and he covers his face with his hands to hide himself. He's so ashamed. It's true – he doesn't deserve this friendship. He doesn't deserve this kind of love. Now he's on the verge of crying because of it, and he doesn't deserve that, either. It's
They stay like that for long, blissful minutes, but then the baby monitor crackles and springs to life, and they hear Rosie cry and babble in her sleep.
I take a moment to revel in the feeling of our erections being pressed against each other and the soft, damp plumpness of his bollocks pushing against mine, the contact even more electric than I imagined it earlier. His hand is back between my cheeks in no time at all, but now there are two fingers nudging at my opening, and I put my head on his upper arm and hide my face in the crook of his neck when he slowly pushes in and stretches me open with small, careful thrusts. He’s breathing against my ear, murmuring sweet nothings to get me to relax.
Sherlock knows Mrs Hudson hasn't forgotten the days gone by, the shouting, the slamming of doors, the bruises Sherlock tried to hide. The long silences. The hazy hours spent lying on the living-room floor, high and crying. The vomiting and soiling himself and falling asleep in the hall, not even able to make it to the bathroom anymore.
“What do you mean?” John asks absent-mindedly, too focused on the task at hand, and works his way down the button row of Sherlock’s navy-blue shirt, his fingers sliding along the expensive silk, and then he reaches the waistband of his trousers and has to pull the fabric out of it to open the garment all the way.
.” He cups the side of Sherlock’s face with his palm, stroking his cheekbone with his thumb. “That was---
He’s just finished preparing a large mug of steaming Lady Grey for John when the man himself enters the kitchen and, after a moment’s hesitation that feels like several days to Sherlock, clears his throat.
"Sorry…" I say lowly and lick his ear, put my tongue inside it, and he jerks below me and exhales shakily.
Sherlock turns his head and sucks in a large gulp of air, then grabs John's arms and holds on to them as if he was a drowning man and John the only fixed point in an endless sea of pain.
Sherlock tries to breathe evenly, but fails. He doesn't have the words to tell John what this means to him (he's always been bad at relationship talk, and addressing bedroom issues is no exception), but the way John allows him to feel safe and challenged at the same time, the way he manages to merge banter and intimacy so lightly, so effortlessly, makes their encounters special and unique and something that belongs only to them. John sweeps him off his feet, constantly, but Sherlock knows he'll always be there to catch him in the end. No one else could ever make Sherlock feel even remotely like this; he's sure of that.
“Let go,” I pant and slide my fingers against his crack, and suddenly he reaches behind himself and grabs my hand to push it down the back of his trousers and under the waistband of his boxers.
"You're amazing," he tells him, and there's no envy involved in it whatsoever today – Sherlock deserves this, deserves to feel this kind of pleasure, and he'll do everything to keep it coming to him. "You're---
Sherlock is very, very pale, and thinner than John remembers him. His hair is the same, though, and his suit, and his scarf, and his coat.
I swallow. My brain helpfully provides me with about half a dozen ideas of what we could do in the bathroom by way of – or
He buries his hand in her dark hair and pushes a little, his hips bucking into her mouth, and she stills and just lets him do it.
When I get home, Mycroft’s sitting in the clients’ chair, facing Sherlock, who’s lying face-down on the couch, his upper body hanging halfway over the armrest, his hands shuffling files and photographs littering the floor in front of him.
“Dr Watson. I’m about to go to the airport. I’m going to Serbia to get Sherlock. I won’t be in touch for a while.”
is not nearly strong enough to explain the heady, irresistible pull he feels when he looks at the man who used to be his best friend. Has Sherlock always been this beautiful?
After studying him for several minutes, Sherlock finally asks: “Would you like to move back into your old room?”
They lie motionless for a minute or two, breathing together, and then John experimentally flexes his hips to push himself against Sherlock's hand.
Sherlock is amazing. John wants to tell him, but he can't find the words to do so. Coherence has left him long ago.
“I never walked into that nest, John,” Sherlock pouts. “That’s simply a story you fabricated for your blog.”
I hum lowly and run my tongue around his tip, feeling the texture of his skin, learning about every ridge and vein, and his thighs tremble against my sides. It's only the second time I'm doing this, so I'm still a little insecure about whether my technique (if you can call it a technique at this point in time) is acceptable - is this good for him? Am I going fast enough, hard enough, deep enough? He's sitting in front of me, keeping his body still, and I let him slide inside a little deeper and watch his face to see his reaction. When I suck him in, hollowing my cheeks like he did when our roles were reversed, he groans and lets his head fall back, baring his gorgeous neck to me.
Enjoying the buzz of the alcohol softening the edges of everything I’m feeling right now, I think about telling Sherlock about Mary, but then remember that I can’t. Who knows when I’ll be able to talk to him again? In one month? Two? Six?
They establish a careful rhythm of back and forth, and after a while Sherlock feels his body accomodate to the intrusion, all his nerve endings coming alive and more and more often registering pleasure instead of pain, and he focuses on the waves of heat undulating through his middle now and at the way John’s breathing is becoming heavier with every second that passes.
“Alright!” Rosie squeaks as she turns towards the bus stop and dashes away, leaving John—and her school bag—behind.
It has been a long, long time since I last touched another man this way, and for a moment I wonder whether he has ever done it before, and if so, with whom. A hot surge of jealousy washes over me at the thought of another one having him like this, and I grip him more tightly and dive into his warmth with vigour bordering on violence, kissing and licking and even biting at his entrance until he whimpers in pleasure and lets go of me with one hand to cover his mouth with it instead.
In reflex, he pulls away and starts to scramble backwards, out of reach of John's arms, and John lets go of him immediately and holds up his hands.
John laughs. Ah. More of Sherlock’s influence. He reckons he should ask her to speak more discreetly about the endeavours of the notorious detective and his live-in partner, but it’s not exactly a secret.
John won't call it off. He's angry at him, and rightly so. And he'll never be "by his side" again – he's made that quite clear. If it all hadn't already been lost before, it definitely was the moment he stepped into the restaurant and disguised himself for his big "surprise".
He breaks off and sighs, sounding upset with himself, his brow furrowed in frustration. His whole demeanour is radiating stress, unease, even a slight hint of panic. John wants it to stop, wants to make this easier for him, but isn't sure how to proceed. He nods and, following a spontaneous impulse, takes Sherlock's restless hand in his, entwining their fingers, wordlessly encouraging him to elaborate.
And it's not like the achingly blissful grimace of passion and release on Sherlock's face when John held him close and kissed his brow and guided him through the aftershocks of a climax that, from the looks of it, had shaken him to his very core.
John is catapulted back into the past, and their untidy living-room at Baker Street appears in front of him, as clearly as if he was standing right there amidst the mess of experiments and scattered papers and toys littering the floor.
,” I murmur, and then a sound I can’t control escapes my chest, like that of a wounded animal, and I’m so shocked by it that I begin to sob, loudly this time, and my legs give way and I have to hold on to the dissecting table to not break down, and that’s when I remember that Molly will have to do her job later, and that your body will no longer be whole afterwards.
John's thoughts wander forwards and into the future, to the next day, and a cool wave of apprehension washes over him. He'll tell Rosie tomorrow. He's almost sure how she's going to react, but he hopes he'll manage to make her see the reasons why he's doing this, to make her understand, at least so much that she won't hate herself for not intervening.
“He’d probably manage on his own, but I don’t want to take any risks,” he eventually says. “And he’s been gone long enough, don’t you think?”
And so John tells her, because he has to keep himself from going insane, and because it's her history, too. He talks for almost half an hour, and she doesn't interrupt him. He talks about his years without Sherlock, about their fights when he returned, and about the reasons Sherlock had for leaving him, and then they just sit together in silence, sipping cold tea, still holding hands.
The breath catches in John's throat at seeing his expression. It’s one of wonder, but there’s also a lot of barely concealed doubt. He nods.
The first night he spends back at Baker Street, John can't sleep. He lies in his bed, eyes wide open, and watches the shadows wander across the walls of his room, listening to Rosie snoring softly in her cot. He's glad she's only so little. He's glad that when she's older, she won't remember the days leading up to the here and now.
The ensuing jolt of pleasure-pain causes Sherlock to gasp and throw back his head, and John, looking punch-drunk, traces his cheekbones with his thumbs.
Pushing gently, he guides Sherlock’s mouth back to where he needs it now, and Sherlock follows willingly, opening his lips when John’s cock comes within reach, and John presses down,
He doesn't know how long he's sitting there by Sherlock's side. Someone pulls him to his feet after an indeterminate amount of pain has passed, and then there's Lestrade, and Molly, and even Mycroft.
Sherlock closes his lids for a second, his chest rising and falling rapidly, and then he turns his upper body to open his bedside drawer and take out a small tube of lubricant. John’s heart skips a beat. Sherlock faces him again and holds out his hand, offering the tube to him, and he takes it, willing himself to stay calm.
John doesn’t understand, but he puts his hands on Sherlock’s arms where they are crossing in front of his own chest and just holds on to him. Sherlock sighs. His mouth is right next to John’s ear.
“Mary hates me right now, and I don’t blame her. But… I told her that I’ll be there for her if she wants me to – or if she needs someone and no one else is available. And I want to see my daughter. I want--- I won’t give up custody if I can help it, Sherlock. Is that alright with you?”
John is tempted to touch him, then, to take his curly head in his hands and caress his brow and tell him how beautiful and brilliant he is, and he's scared it's showing on his face, so he takes a deep breath and decides to end this here, while he still can.
When he pulls out, Sherlock appeals to his protesting limbs to cooperate and straightens up, his joints cracking.
John is chewing the insides of his cheeks, his arms pressed to his sides, stock-still. Sherlock knows he's scared to move, to make contact. He thinks he's not allowed to anymore. He doesn't know that despite everything, he still is.
“It might be sufficient, for the time being, if you provided us with insights, Sherlock. You could do that from here while you complete your healing process. My people could do the foot work,” he says, his tone not betraying the fact that he’s just lost this battle.
Sherlock's whole body breaks out in goosebumps when John ends the kiss and runs his tongue across their knuckles instead, pushes it into the gaps between their fingers, sucks the last traces of honey right off their skin as if it was the most delicious thing he's ever tasted.
, and the fact that he needs to let go, needs to trust his lover so completely to be able to enjoy it is what makes it both thrilling and terrifying. John knows that.
