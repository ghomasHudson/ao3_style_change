John stood frozen, his instinct demanding that he mewl needily for attention from his mate, reassurance that this Alpha would not touch him. He ignored it, trusting Sherlock to handle the situation. He could tell that Sherlock's sire was a powerful Alpha; he was clearly not used to being disobeyed. John noticed that he hadn't even mentioned the second option; a fight for dominance. If Sherlock could beat him, he would no longer have to recognise the man as his pack Alpha. John shifted nervously, his back starting to hurt from being on his feet for so long. He dug his hand into his pocket and did the only thing he could think of to help. He texted Mycroft.
The Omega crooned to his mate, hushing and reassuring and praising, as the Alpha suckled meekly. He wiped the tears away, rocking him, holding him, sending love and forgiveness through their bond. When the first breast was empty he transferred Sherlock across to the other and smiled encouragingly as he latched on. "That's it love, good boy," he murmured softly, stroking his hair. "No need to be sad. You're not a bad Alpha, you love me too much for that to be true. You haven't even questioned or protested my decision that we'll sleep in our bedroom, have you? Even though it's your right as my Alpha to demand that we sleep in the nest? You'd do anything for me Sherlock, we both know that. You love me too much to want to risk upsetting me by saying we'll sleep in the nest, even though that's what you want. I couldn't ask for a better Alpha. Yes, you got a little rough, but I'm built to take that. I know you needed to claim me, I
John shifted slightly so he could reach Sherlock's lips without squashing any of the babies and kissed him languidly, savouring the sensation and sending more of his complete adoration through their bond.
"Please," John whined, Sherlock's hands cupping him making his milk even more insistent on leaking. "I'm so close to leaking. I've got pads in my bra to catch it but I - I'm so full, Sherlock, I - oh god," he breathed hotly, "too late. I'm leaking already. I can feel it, Sherlock, I'm
do I look? I certainly feel it," he murmured, lapping submissively at his mate's scent gland, trying to taste his mood.
" he whined, "please, it's okay, nobody's touched me..." He let out a low moan as Sherlock's huge cock found his prostate, the extra stimulation finally triggering his wetness.
"No, sweetheart, this is grown-up food," John cooed fondly, lifting his parsnip-laden fork a little higher out of Benedict's reach. "You're not quite ready for it yet." The pup squirmed and whimpered in displeasure, but conceded a high-pitched giggle when John tickled his foot. When John looked around the table he couldn't help but grin himself; Mycroft looked calm and assured at the head of the table, checking that the pups to his left and right were sufficiently amused with their toys while he ate, and the Omegas and Mrs Hudson were all fussing over the babies near them as well. Greg and Sherlock were deep in conversation about a particularly clever locked-room murder and Molly was too busy covering Arthur in affection to eat much of her meal.
"I knew an Abigail who went by Abby... Alistair is better," he hummed. "I feel like it's a mix, though. I can't tell the ratio, but I feel like we've got some of each," he purred contentedly. "Mmmm... if I'd known you knotting me would feel this good I'd have thrown myself at you the second you got here..." he moaned, clenching on Sherlock's knot again, suddenly delirious with bliss, knowing he was stuffed full of Sherlock's babies. "And now you've filled me so full of your babies... I'll look full term with one baby by the time I'm five months gone with these ones... I'll have to sit with my thighs spread to accommodate my huge, swollen belly, stuffed with the babies you've given me," he whispered, not caring anymore if that spurred Sherlock on to try and encourage more eggs to attach, even wanting to hear him say it.
"Quite so," Sherlock agreed, "but I did not know what apprehensions you may have had, regardless." The Alpha paused, imagining his Omega in the throes of labour, birthing one baby after another; the thought pleased him, and he felt his heart rate pick up. He reached a hand up to card through John's hair as the Omega eagerly stroked his own belly. "It will be incredible, seeing you like that," he murmured. His fingers pressed gently down to massage the man's scalp. "You'll be showing in no time," he said, almost reading the Omega's thoughts, "I cannot wait to watch you grow."
"Yes, yes," John agreed eagerly, panting, hurtling towards the edge quickly as he was still so sensitive from his first release. "Please, oh, please, I need it, need you to come in me, want to be so full of your seed it forces my belly to swell out even further... Ngh, oh, so good, fuck, yes,
Sherlock's body was humming with pleasure. The Alpha grinned as his mate began to clean him. "We're in the shower, you know," he murmured, but he might as well have been talking to a puppy for all John understood. He had no desire to sadden his precious, obedient partner, and knew how easily any sign of disappointment could injure the Omega in this state. "Good boy," he crooned, letting John continue to work, his hands still holding John's hips strongly, keeping the gravid man pressed up against the wall, "Came so well for me. Did everything I asked. Such a perfect partner..." He gave him loving, lazy kisses where he could reach. "Let me know when you're ready to come off my cock... or should I take you to see our guests just like this?"
It took a moment for the words to register; Sherlock had briefly holed himself up inside his mind palace while John dressed, not wanting to spoil the Omega's surprise with his own deductions. He turned slowly, all questions his brilliant mind had formed completely vanishing when his eyes met the sight of John's cock enclosed in suggestively sheer fabric. His lips parted dumbly and his pupils dilated as his gaze travelled up John's gravid body, taking in how the Omega's bulging belly pushed the waistband of the panties low, how heavy and full it looked in John's hands, perfectly accentuated by the green fabric; the swathe of bare skin and the mound of his navel displayed gorgeously between the parted fabric; the way the globes of his breasts looked even rounder in the cups of the bra.
Time seemed to slow down as the Alpha and Omega nuzzled and kissed on the bed, fawning over each other and their children until they had a pile of sated, gurgling pups laid out around them, babbling and managing the odd coherent word. John sighed happily as he glanced out of the window and saw a light fall of snow, drifting placidly towards the ground; everything was peace and warm and love, his Alpha was secure and settled behind him, their children thriving and growing, and soon they would have three more new-born pups, their family growing until John could bear no more children.
John giggled at Sherlock's tone and expression. "Of course. We. Bet I can find a better house than you," he challenged, equally playful. "The sooner we find it the better, my nesting instincts are demanding I prepare the nursery..." he admitted, pressing his face into Sherlock's hair and standing, a little wobbly from the recent double orgasm his mate had given him, and tottered off in the direction of his laptop.
Sherlock crooned happily at his mate, paying more attention to the nub of John's belly button. He slipped a finger through the opening of the Omega's shirt, between two of his buttons, and began rubbing the sensitive mound directly, hushing John's small whimper. "Such a good Omega, so desperate to be touched," he murmured sweetly, so that only his mate could hear, kissing John's scent gland, "So needy. Nobody will think anything of us here like this - an Omega clinging and whimpering to his affectionate Alpha. But you'd do anything for me, wouldn't you?" He increased the pressure on John's navel, beginning to rub in faster circles.
John smiled fondly at the familiar excitement, frowning a little as Sherlock said he'd prefer to work from home. That wasn't like him... but then he heard the reason, and his expression cleared. Sherlock was protecting him and their babies and that made him feel something a lot like lust for the Alpha. He licked his lips as Lestrade and Sherlock discussed the protection in question and as soon as Sherlock was off the phone he lunged at him, kissing him deeply, rubbing his round belly against him sensually. "Such a good Alpha... protecting me and our litter..." he breathed, kissing along Sherlock's jaw. "I hope you told Lestrade not to expect you within the hour... because I want to show you my appreciation," he whispered, glad of his mate's habit of sleeping naked as he kissed his way down the Alpha's body and began lapping at his cock.
" he purred, making it sound like the most erotic thing on earth. "You did your duty as a mate, as a
"Isn't Daddy clever?" John crooned to Iris, nuzzling her nose before setting her back in the pram and grasping the handles, pushing it forward once more. "I do like the bridge," he admitted shyly to Sherlock, "I used to come to this park at weekends when I was in medical school and the view over the pond and across the rest of the park is lovely... and I used to throw pennies into the wishing well at the other side."
from knowing, but he didn't expect the information to be thrust right under their noses. Was it too late to change the date? The time? Maybe they could put it off until next year, take a vacation for now, pretend like it wasn't happening after all. He took a deep breath, "Just... seating. I was thinking I should sit after all. With you." He gave John his best, most composed smile, kissed him on the cheek, and handed him back the plate. "I'm sorry, can you excuse me for a moment?" he said, swallowing thickly, "I need to make a call about... plans... confirm the flowers, you know..." He rose from the nest and hurried from the room, leaving his rather confused mate alone with his breakfast. A call to his brother was in most urgent order.
John glowed at Sherlock's words, a shy smile painting his lips. "I'm glad you think so. I love being special to you." He stroked Sherlock's hand affectionately with his thumb as their waitress cleared their now-empty plates and left them with the dessert menu. "Read it to me," John murmured lazily, "I don't want to let go of your hand, and the pups are wriggling like mad. Need to soothe them." He stroked his swollen belly in slow circles, closing his eyes, a slight blush on his cheeks as he was very aware that he looked utterly domestic and Omega. He hummed as Sherlock read him the choices and opted for baklava, leaving Sherlock to order as he went to the bathroom; pregnancy was already taking a heavy toll on his bladder.
"They both look lovely," John beamed. "We can see how they all feel when we visit them. We should check which schools are nearby too, see which house has the best ones nearby. I have a feeling we'll
"They seemed like effective measures at the time," Mycroft managed, suddenly very interested in the drink in his hand instead of the mirthful gazes of the others. Sherlock snorted, "I'm not exactly sure what you expected of poor Lestrade. I believe I was already well past the point of 'out of control' at the time." When Sherlock first began to interest himself with New Scotland Yard, he'd shown up to nearly every crime high as a kite; it hadn't taken but a minute for the DI to call him out on his seemingly boundless energy, his unmistakably dilated pupils, the dark circles under his eyes from days gone without sleep. Their first encounter had nearly ended in disaster; in a fit of anger, the other Alpha had caught Sherlock by the arm and forcibly yanked up his sleeve, exposing the tell-tale track marks littering the thinner man's arm. And then Sherlock had started spouting off deductions left and right, so good that the other Alpha couldn't help but give him his attention. The relationship between the two men had certainly never been smooth, but Lestrade had concerned himself as an almost paternal figure in Sherlock's life after that, and the consulting detective was by no means surprised that Mycroft had paid him a visit.
Several seats down the Alpha fucking the club Omega's mouth came with a long drawn-out grunt, breathing heavily through his nose. The servant swallowed what he could and allowed the rest to spatter over his face and chest, drawing a deep purr from the Alpha.
Sherlock crawled between his mate's spread thighs, hooking John's legs over his shoulders and pressing readily inside. He could thrust into his mate powerfully in his position, and did so eagerly, having to restrain himself from setting too hard or punishing a pace in consideration of the Omega's sore and reddened hole. The Alpha took advantage of the position to watch his mate's full breasts bounce as he fucked him, creamy milk rolling in thick rivulets down the twin mounds. He dipped his head to close his lips gently over one dusky nipple, taking it in his mouth and suckling delicately. John's breasts would continue to fill and grow, and Sherlock nursing just a little would not steal milk from their pups who needed it more; in fact, John would have more than enough to feed their litter after the Alpha's encouragement. It wasn't long before he felt another knot swelling, stretching the base of the condom.
Seeing John rub his churning womb completed the picture of perfection between Sherlock's legs, and the onlookers recognized it. The blonde's Omega was already mewling and moaning for permission to come, her mate thrusting hard into her and making her belly bounce; the redhead clutched it and suddenly gave a cry, clear fluid gushing out around the cock filling her and soaking her Alpha's lap. Her mate grinned and continued thrusting harder as the Omega began to pant, belly contracting tightly. "Ripe and ready for the birthing suite," the blonde growled, "She'll be whelping within the hour."
. The Omega rocked his hips to meet his mate, quivering with arousal and satisfaction, blissed out on the feeling of the happy, wanting Alpha inside him, of Sherlock completely present and gazing at him with such love.
John hummed his agreement, pressing kisses along Sherlock's collarbone before going back up to kiss his lips, softly but deeply. "We don't have to decide on the last name today. We've got until February," he breathed quietly, peppering little kisses across Sherlock's face. He settled back into Sherlock's chest, inhaling his Alpha's scent. "Any cases on at the moment? We should probably get out of the flat, have a bit of fresh air. If nothing else we could go for a walk in the park?" he suggested shyly, knowing the exercise would be good for the babies but knowing also that the activity was a little pedestrian, in every sense, for Sherlock.
he sent tenderly, setting the dark-haired pups with their siblings and beginning to pile their babies on top of Sherlock with an achingly loving kiss to his mate's forehead.
"Ngh... ahhh... yes, yes," John chanted mindlessly, tears beginning to stream down his face from finally feeling satisfied, the almost-knot stretching him deliciously wider, his slick channel so full of his Alpha's come it was already leaking freely into the bath. "Nghhhh, so good... mmm," he purred happily, eyes fluttering closed as he smiled blissfully and writhed on Sherlock's engorged cock. "Ahhh, that's better," he added, the relief and satisfaction evident in his voice. "So much better. So full of you... ngh, I love it... full of your babies, your cock, your come. Love being this full of you. Love being just a vessel for you." He shuddered and released his white-knuckle grip on the edges of the tub, suddenly realising just how exhausted he was. "Nest, please?" he mewled submissively. "Clean, nest, sleep?" As always, being so thoroughly claimed by his Alpha had pushed him into his Omega and he found himself able only to form the most basic words. He ached for crisp laundered sheets, their eiderdown quilt, the soft cushiness of their bed. "Pillow," he asserted, proud of his coherence.
Sherlock answered with a low rumble, capturing John's lips in a fierce, heady kiss. He added a third finger, thrusting rhythmically into the Omega's slick wetness, his fingers dripping, smirking against John's lips as his mate began to lift his hips, whimpering as he rocked into the Alpha's fingers. The Omega's small hard cock bobbed eagerly against his gravid middle, and Sherlock began to undo his own fly with his free hand, John's noises encouraging him on. He pushed down his pants, his own enormous cock quickly freeing itself from his trousers, precome dripping from the dark, plump head. "Mine. Want you," he growled, removing the rest of his clothing quickly. He teased in and out of the Omega's hole with the head of his cock at first, but the urge to take his mate was overwhelming, and soon he was burying himself inside to the hilt with a groan, his hands cupping the full roundness of John's heavy belly.
The large tree dominated one whole corner of the room, wrapped in crocheted garland and fairy lights, decked out in an eclectic variety of ornaments - some from their home in Baker Street, others parts of a set, others crocheted by the Omegas, and some even newer - most notably, thirteen "Baby's First Christmas" ornaments, and another bearing the dates of the couple's two anniversaries. The skirt under the tree was invisible through the piles of colourful toys and presents.
Stroking his Omega's belly in large circles, the Alpha remained discouraged by the lack of praise and fawning from his mate. When someone was happy, he thought to himself, they showed it, full of joy and excitement. They talked about it. When people didn't talk about their experiences, or acted neutral, their feelings towards the situation were likely negative. The Alpha bit his lip, looking back at Miles as the baby nursed. Had he done badly after all?
, he grinned, guiding the pregnant man upwards. He set the plate aside for a moment as he helped guide the Omega down onto his massive cock, his hands steadying John's hips and then rubbing his belly possessively as he seated himself.
an old sonogram machine from the clinic... It was due to be thrown out because we got new ones. It's old but there's nothing actually wrong with it... It's in the upstairs bedroom. We can use it to scan me... We won't be able to see any detail, not at two weeks, but we'll be able to see the little balls of flesh and count them," he breathed, smiling beautifully at his Alpha, mewling quietly as Sherlock touched him, loving the idea of Sherlock drinking as much of his milk as he could handle.
They stayed like that until the doorbell rang at precisely three o'clock, a three-second ring. John roused slightly from his almost-doze, warm and comfortable under the blanket having his belly stroked, and blinked stupidly before his brain came back online. "Bet it's Lestrade," John murmured quietly, smiling fondly as his Alpha got up to answer the door. He was both pleased and surprised that Sherlock was voluntarily allowing another Alpha into his territory, where he was nesting with his heavily pregnant mate. He wondered idly if it was because Lestrade had moved between John and Anderson during that incident, Sherlock knew the other man could be trusted around his mate. He snuggled happily into the blanket his mate had given him, purring as he stroked the silky fur.
John's moans grew louder and breathier as Sherlock's lips and hands blazed a trail of sensual fire across his swollen belly, each firm, possessive touch bringing him closer to the edge. The triplets continued to move, sensing their sire's approval and their mother's excitement, and the Omega couldn't help but keen as his mate rubbed over every inch of his skin. As the Alpha swirled his tongue around the nub of his navel, pushed out by the weight of their children, John cried out weakly and bucked his hips, coming in small spurts onto the sheets.
As much as John needed his needs as an Omega met, Sherlock required his needs as an Alpha to be met, as well. Months without properly claiming his mate had led to a gradual build-up of instinctual frustration; finally finding himself in bed with John again had released the floodgates, tipping his precarious hormonal balance in favour of primal instinct, and the addition of the collar had only intensified the reaction. He'd needed to fuck John almost brutally, to utterly dominate his Omega and satisfy himself that John was under his command. On a short fuse, John reacting in any manner other than what he expected or desired was enough to turn the Alpha as cold as ice. His stomach churning with self-doubt and disappointment, he hurried downstairs and silently retrieved the two pups from the surprised Omegas in the sunroom.
Sherlock purred. "My pups," he rumbled, "A perfect litter of three. Round, healthy triplets that you begged me to put in you, dropped eggs so I could fertilize them and make you swell out like this with my children." He continued to rub the Omega's gravidity, adding a little pressure to his motions for emphasis. The Alpha thumbed over his mate's navel, regarding John's belly with pride and admiration, as if it were a fine work of art, created by his own skill. "And before this you carried the thirteen now sleeping in their cots, grew so large you were pinned to the bed for months, unable to want anything besides food, sleep, and my cock." He kissed him, and smiled against his lips. "You don't have to dream it anymore," he murmured, rolling his hips, "You have it, you have me, always, whenever you wish."
"Guess that's my cue," John smiled, "it was nice to meet you, Victor." He shook the other Omega's hand and went to the crying pup, lifting her to his neck, patting her back as she nuzzled into him and calmed at the scent.
When he was clean he returned to his Alpha like a faithful puppy, eagerly seeking his next instruction, cooing when he was permitted to lick Sherlock's cock clean.
Mycroft stood stock-still for a few moments before raising his arms too, encircling his younger brother with them lightly and patting him stiffly on the back. Mrs Hudson repressed a sniffle into her handkerchief as Molly, Lestrade and John watched with wide, disbelieving eyes. The brothers broke apart after a few moments and Sherlock returned to John as Mycroft sank back into his seat. John pressed close to his mate, positively radiant. "Well done, love," he purred quietly, his breath teasing across his ear, his hand resting innocently on his outer thigh.
, shuddering as it drew another orgasm from him. He was too deep into instinct to feel guilt about what he'd just done; no more than an Alpha, breeding his mate was his only concern, and he began to kiss and lick at John's neck, paying his mate more gentle attentions to encourage more eggs to drop. He crooned in pleasure, pressing his cock deeper and letting loose another flood of seed.
"So demanding," Sherlock moaned. "You're full of questions today, my Omega."  He thrust lightly into John's fist, but let the Omega's hand do most of the work. "Mmm, yes, I will only get bigger... The larger you get, the more litters you have, the more my cock grows... I love it, forcing you to stretch... nnh... wider... My size physical proof of how many pups I've sired, how virile an Alpha I am... It's already becoming difficult to hide - imagine how it will be by the time we're done..." He groaned, his breathing becoming heavier as John worked him. "It feels good, knowing how many I've… mmm... stuffed into you, how
- but he fought against the Alpha side of him encouraging that such thinking was correct, that John should be kept somewhere very safe, protected by him and away from all threats. It was rational but it wasn't; he couldn't keep his mate so insulated without John becoming unhappy, and he didn't want John unhappy. He closed his eyes against the feelings, feeling a black mood rapidly descending.
"Loved seeing you like this last time," Leo purred, "so heavy with a mixed litter for your pack. You loved carrying babies from all four of your Alphas, didn't you?" The pack leader finally withdrew, sending cum and slick cascading down the back of the Omega's thighs. She stepped back, allowing Leo to step in to her place. "Ready?" he asked the helpless breeder, rubbing his thick cock against the Omega's slick entrance.
Omega. His Omega who smelled very, very wrong. Sherlock slowly sank down onto the couch, straddling his mate as best John's huge belly would allow. He tilted John's head away from him carefully, sniffing around his scent gland. Apprehension began to leak into the Omega's scent, but there were no markers of interaction with another Alpha, no traces of the presence of a challenger, nothing to disturb their bond. Sherlock only huffed softly, still growling as he began to scent the rest of his Omega. It didn't take long to discover where the offending scent lay - it was nearly everywhere. And distinctly not his. He snarled and bared his teeth.
- it was too close to many of his previous fantasies about the detective, when they'd been living at Baker Street and he'd thought the man could never want him. "Yes... please..." John keened pathetically, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's neck, pliantly waiting to be hoisted up against the wall and onto his mate's cock.
Sherlock purred in return, settling down with their youngest beside his mate. Enora's cries quieted as soon as a bottle was presented to her, her tiny lips latching on around the nipple as she began to suckle eagerly. The Alpha purred and licked his mate's cheek, watching John nurse. The couple was still completely nude, but there was no shame amongst pack members. Even Mrs Hudson felt no embarrassment in their presence; they were an Alpha and Omega in their natural state, she well understood. As a Beta, the landlady never thought she'd be allowed to so much as see the inside of the nest, much less be given the privilege of supporting John with the pack, nursing the pups at such an impressionable stage.
When they were dried to Sherlock's satisfaction John managed to stagger through to the bed, awkwardly shuffling to climb on top of it like a particularly chubby seal trying to get onto an especially slippery ice floe. He flopped onto his side with an ungainly "oof!" of surprise but quickly recovered, caressing his belly almost defiantly while he purred and glanced at his Alpha.
"Of course," Sherlock smiled, stepping forward to take the jumper from his mate and press a kiss to John's cheek. He purred when John seemed to melt into the small gesture, the Omega instinctually pressing himself closer to his Alpha, seeking more of Sherlock's touch. Sherlock had noticed his mate slipping gradually more and more toward his Omega state since John had become pregnant; the changes usually manifested themselves in small things - increased affection and approval-seeking, an attachment that meant John spent less time on his own and more around Sherlock - but today seemed to have been a tipping point of sorts. The shift had become more than obvious, and it pleased the Alpha immensely. Sherlock placed another kiss to his Omega's forehead before retrieving a nursing bra and the requested shirt. The Alpha took his time dressing his mate, allowing his hands to linger for far longer than necessary over John's full breasts and belly; he couldn't resist pressing a sweet kiss to John's navel before buttoning the Omega's shirt, smiling at the response of a few small vibrations under his lips and hands. As soon as John's shirt was done up - the collar not nearly covering the extensive amount of purple marks covering the Omega's neck - Sherlock helped him on with the jumper, the oatmeal covered garment a perfect fit. Last were the pants and trousers. He had his mate brace his hands on his shoulders as he helped John into the elastic-waisted bottoms. Finished, he looked up at his now well-dressed mate and purred with satisfaction and pride, standing to kiss his Omega and pull him into a tender embrace.
Sherlock was buying time, too, giving a few more minutes for the additive in the bath to begin taking hold of his partner. He'd already noticed a small spike in temperature; the rest would be soon to follow. The harmless aphrodisiac would also loosen John's inhibitions just a little - as his libido spiked, he'd be carried further into subspace, and relax more about their upcoming activities.
"Yeah?" John breathed, drunk on his Alpha's obvious pleasure at the memory of the encounter. "I couldn't help myself... I felt like I could
Sherlock managed a gracious smile and began to undo the silky, deep red ribbon of the box. The coal black parcel was much smaller and more inconspicuous than the others; Sherlock would hardly have noticed it, had he not known Molly still had a present to give. The Alpha paused, then lifted the lid. His eyes gleamed appreciatively, even as he felt a small sinking in his heart for the Omega pathologist. "Well. It appears we have a date," he smiled, lifting two tickets to the London Symphony from the box for his mate and the others to see, along with a gift certificate to a rather low-key, but extremely good, Italian restaurant nearby. He raised his eyes to Molly, who had bitten down harder on a lip that was now trembling dangerously, her eyes sparkling with unshed tears. This year he could not rise to kiss her on the cheek; it would not be appropriate for him now that he had bonded with John. "They're perfect," he replied, holding her gaze, "We could not have asked for better. You've been more than thoughtful, Molly." He sent another pulse of uncertainty through his bond with John, wondering if the Omega might rise to comfort her, or simply have better words of gratitude and reassurance than he.
John gasped and arched when the servant gave a particularly clever twist of his wrist, pleading incoherently and faltering in his rhythm on his playmate's cock; they leaned in and began to kiss heatedly, encouraging each other on as they both drew closer to release. John's moans grew more wanton and whorish, any idea of volume control abandoned in the pursuit of pleasure; he felt voluptuous and sensual, his hole softening further as his body anticipated his Alpha’s demands. The doctor squeezed the club Omega's cock lightly as he began to pump it in earnest, purring to encourage him to come, and the servant groaned low and shocked.
Sherlock frowned at the idea of live-in help, but knew in the back of his mind that it would be necessary. His breathing subtly quickened as John spoke, his fingers rubbing small circles over the swells that would fill and expand to become obvious breasts. "You'll be full to bursting," he said huskily, "Constantly dripping with milk, your breasts ballooning over your enormous belly. I'll have to help you take some of the edge off..."
"I know," John purred happily. "This time, I'm full of your babies... Thirteen of them, thirteen children you gave me... You can take me slowly, I'm already full of your brood, we've got time to explore each other," he crooned, wrapping his hand around Sherlock's cock, using the precum to slick his entrance, rolling on to his hands and knees to present himself.
The room erupted with cheers, whistles and applause as the couple emerged, identical beaming smiles on their faces. Sherlock wheeled John over to the table with the cake on it, a large four-tier hexagonal design, simple, with a cascade of flowers down one side like Sherlock had suggested. John had to sit side on to the table and twist a little awkwardly to be able to grasp the knife, but Sherlock's hand on top of his own, guiding and steadying, made the job easier. He brushed Sherlock's long fingers with his thumb tenderly just as they sank the tip of the blade into the bottom tier and cut the cake, the photographer snapping away to capture the moment, before Sherlock stole another kiss from his new wife and wheeled him across to their little table. John looked up at him, smiling, reaching out for his hand and giving it an encouraging squeeze. He knew Sherlock had been dreading this moment, the speech he'd have to make; the father of the bride was conspicuous in his absence, but John had been adamant that his parents not be invited, and they had agreed the traditional best man's speech would also be dispensed with, given that the embarrassing stories about Sherlock consisted of either drugs or dead bodies. The Omega mewled softly, demanding attention from his mate, and pushed reassuring love towards him through the bond.
"My parents' names open doors. The name 'Mycroft Holmes," opens doors," Sherlock corrected jokingly, "'Sherlock Holmes' gets them slammed in your face. But I will make the call." He picked up the phone, very tempted to simply ask for March 31st, loving the idea of John walking - no, waddling - down the aisle, as pregnant as he could possibly be and still be able to stand on his own. He punched in the numbers and spoke to a variety of staff before finally reaching the person to book the room. "January 1st... yes... very understandable..." he nodded, listening some more before asking the man to wait a moment and covering the receiver as he turned to John. "January 27th, February 11th or 20th, March 1st or 25th," he rattled off, "Would you simply like me to choose the earliest possible?"
"John," Sherlock murmured, his voice deep and tender. He hushed his Omega with an apologetic press of soft lips to the bloodied ones of his lover, suckling away the red stains and laving gently over the wounds to begin the healing process. The wetness of John's tears shone on his own cheeks when he moved back, and he nuzzled his saddened mate, allowing him to sob as he spoke. "You ran to protect our pups. You are perfectly capable of fighting still, but not in this condition - our children are too vulnerable." The Alpha smoothed a hand over the swell of John's belly, "Your body tells you to keep them safe, knows that I will take care of the combat while you remove yourself from harm's way. You still can fight in a pinch- you shoved away Anderson's initial advance very effectively- but what if he had landed a blow to your stomach?" Sherlock shook his head, his eyes reflecting his Omega's distress. "Someday you will fight by my side again, but not now. Can you understand that? It is too risky. You know it is by instinct, though it goes against everything else you are." He hid his face in John's shoulder, his gentle caresses unspoken apologies for everything that had happened, both between them and back at the Yard. "Had I guessed the danger, I never would have deliberately put you in such a situation. I've failed you and our pups by underestimating the risk."
John squealed breathily, tightening his hold on his Alpha. "Ohhh, oh yes... I can feel it, feel how much of your seed you've put inside me..." He leaned in close to Sherlock's ear, still rocking his hips, and whispered to him in a low growl; "Next time you breed me, I want you to swell me with your come. Fucking fill me, inflate my belly with it." With a teasing nip to Sherlock's ear he dropped his head back onto the pillows, panting and moaning."Ohhh, Sherlock, I can feel it, so ripe for you, please,
The Alpha frowned slightly, stroking a hand through John's hair as his mate began to snore and ignoring the ridiculous stirrings of arousal at the heaviness of John's girth on his leg. If he went out and bought the pies, by the time he got back... He swallowed at the thought of feeding John, of being able to make his mate even larger and heavier. And he could squeeze in the case as well - just briefly pop over to the crime scene for a few moments, have a short look around. It wasn't far from the shop. It might actually make John happy if he did so. And Mrs Hudson would be in before long, not to mention John's mobile was just within reach.
to her child as she shrugged off her shirt and removed her bra, showing him he was welcome to her breasts. "Come here, Remi. Let Mother care for you."
"We found that this was the easiest way to get them to settle," Mycroft drawled, "although I would appreciate it if you could remove whoever is kicking me in the bladder." John laughed and helped his mate shift their pups off Mycroft and into a pile in their father's lap on the sofa. The babies stirred but did not wake, and John squeezed Sherlock's hand as he watched the snow fall peacefully outside.
The Alpha pulled the Omega closer by his hips, making John's belly press against him even more, and hummed in approval. Sherlock cleaned every last drop of himself from his Omega's face, suckling at John's earlobe to remove a final drop. When he finally finished, he paused - and let out a soft, embarrassed chuckle. "Sorry," he murmured, pulling back and blushing, "You were fantastic. I guess a part of me got a little carried away."
oh god, Sherlock, tell me - ah! - tell me how you're going to make me pregnant again," he breathed, tears streaming down his face in sheer pleasure as his Alpha fucked him, reclaiming him.
John snuggled closer eagerly, pushing himself against his mate like a kitten demanding attention, his eyes sliding closed lazily as Sherlock stroked his hair. He was aware there was another Alpha nearby, but not a threatening one; Lestrade's scent told him that the man would defend him if Sherlock was unavailable, so he could relax in his presence. He had been dropping in and out of his Omega more frequently of late, and the morning's exertions meant he was slipping into it more easily. He pressed his nose to his Alpha's throat and inhaled, settling further into Sherlock's lap.
Felix squealed and laughed with delight, squirming in his father's arms and relaxing further at the attention although he nuzzled a little closer anyway, as if afraid he'd be put back in his bath if he let his guard down. Lucy perked up at the sound and began to giggle as well, burbling happily as she splashed Enora, and John ruffled her hair as he pushed their baths closer together. "They're starting to wrinkle," he hummed softly, catching Imogen's little fist as she waved it at him and examining her pruned fingers. "Few more minutes, babies?" Several of the pups babbled in response to his questioning tone of voice, grinning and squeaking, and John chuckled at the sound.
John laughed at that. "No," he agreed. "Maybe just dropping my jacket, that should still hide the bump well enough. If I wear a t-shirt underneath instead of a jumper the bump will be
"I don't know how I'm supposed to be carrying any mince pies like this," he commented to his sons, as Adam tugged a fistful of dark locks and squealed in glee. Felix gripped his shirt tighter and watched Sherlock worriedly, as if afraid that his daddy would try and leave him again. The Alpha found a burlap shopping bag left on the counter and ended up piling a Tupperware container full of the Omega's treats, several bottles, and a couple napkins into it, just in case, before returning to the living room. He propped the pups against him again before unpacking it and starting the film, smiling as he offered a small, sweet pie to his mate.
The door was opened for them. Out climbed an impeccably dressed Sherlock, a sleek black suit complementing his form flawlessly. The Alpha adjusted his cuffs, gold cuff links gleaming richly in the dim light of the car park. "Omega, come," he ordered imperiously, taking a step towards the door to offer a hand to the enormous, heavily pregnant man inside.
he tried lamely, not wanting to begin worrying John with thoughts of how they could curb their youngest's Harry-like tendencies. In his own opinion, there seemed nothing wrong with the child, but if this was how Harry started out - could there be something they could do to steer her in a better direction?
, he couldn't - he was supposed to hold out. Trembling, he forced himself to lie down and press his covered cock into the Omega's dripping hole.
Sherlock inhaled sharply, his eyes widening in shock as he reeled backwards for a moment, only to be steadied by his Omega's gentle hands. It took a few long moments of John's soothing before he came to rest atop him again, his heavy breaths beginning to slow as he pressed his forehead to his mate's. He sought answers through the bond, and only felt John's love envelop him in return, encouraging his decision. Sherlock swallowed. "You want me to collar you tonight... Omega..," he whispered slowly, looking into John's eyes. It was not a question. The Alpha searched another moment, then bowed his head, planting a tender kiss to John's lips. "Then you shall have my collar." Sherlock smiled, genuinely, and pulled his mate closer.
"From the first time we spoke," John murmured reverently, rolling his hips decadently. "Ohhhh... I couldn't believe how gorgeous you were... I could scent how powerful an Alpha you were, wanted to know how big your cock would be... wanted you to crowd me up against the wall and press it against me, rut against my belly and show me exactly how big it was... wanted you to bend me over the worktop and fuck me right there... right from the start... ohhh, god, you know your cock is bigger since the pups were born? I can feel how much bigger you are..." John began to pant lightly, the feeling of riding his Alpha's enormous, thick cock rapidly sending him crazy with lust.
John arched into the touch, allowing it to relax him, feeling the stretch as the pup crowned, stretching him wide, feeling every little sensation as his hole opened further to allow the baby's head to push through it, stretched taut as he pushed and moaned, panting lightly. He let out a long, luxurious groan as the rest of the child slipped from him in one slick but slow movement, hearing his mate's purr as he cleaned and scented, clamped the cord, wrapped it in a towel, brought it up for John to see. He smiled softly, purring at the baby, sniffing delicately. Girl, Alpha. He kissed her tiny forehead as he brought her to his breast, carefully shifting the three pups he'd already fed to make room, while Sherlock located the tag for the second-born girl. Lucy Elspeth. John mewed quietly as she latched on and suckled, watching as his mate slipped a tiny orange hat over her dark curls. He felt almost relaxed, even as his body was telling him the next pup had engaged; he'd been in labour nearly two hours, and was only just beginning to feel the effects. He felt safe and protected, his Alpha guarding their nest and their pups, and purred for his mate as Lucy grunted softly around his nipple, pushing relaxation through the bond; time for a rest, we can scent these pups for a while before the next one arrives. He dipped his head and nuzzled Adam's stomach, his purring never ceasing as he scented each baby in turn, nuzzling and mewing.
Sherlock's goodbye with Molly was brief; the Omega was shyly eager to ride home with the DI. He smiled faintly as he watched her go, and closed the door behind him. Immediately, among the fading fragrances of the guests and mince pies, he scented something was off.
Emily growled as Brendan began to plead more desperately for her cock. "Shhh, pretty," she cooed, "let me take care of you... Let me take the hurt away." She smoothed an appreciative palm over his backside, feeling the underlying plumpness which betrayed his previous litters, and lined herself up with the other hand. "So ready for your pack, aren't you? Ready to carry our pups again?" Brendan squealed and nodded feverishly, rocking his hips in a desperate effort to impale himself on Emily's cock, but the breeding stand held him firmly in place and he could do nothing but kneel and wait to be bred. "Alright, my sweet, let's see how many you can give us," Emily purred, gripping the Omega's hip and pushing in.
John hummed and groaned in satisfaction as his Alpha's orgasm triggered another of his own, leaving him breathless and panting.
John purred and sat up as he sensed his mate return to the bed with their children and scooped the babies into his arms with a practiced motion, holding them both in the right position for a feed. He smiled when he looked down and saw they were in their I <3 Daddy onesies, nuzzling Sherlock's cheek and settling against his chest. They enjoyed a lazy lie-in, slowly accumulating pups in a wriggling pile of warm, sated babies as John fed them one by one; he chuckled when they had to wake sleepy little Arthur to feed him, the tiny Alpha in his mint-accented sleepsuit dozing happily until he was cradled against John's chest and finally opening his eyes just long enough to latch on with a sleepy mewl of contentment. On the bed Felix and Viola were waving their chubby fists at each other and giggling, and the sound made John purr and snuggle further into Sherlock's embrace; the rest of the babies burbled to each other animatedly, filling the nest with soft coos and high-pitched squeals.
Most of the pups were contented to be lay carefully back on the floor, but Felix began to cry as soon as Sherlock began to move him, causing the Alpha to pick him up. Adam, too, wouldn't budge, and so the father set off to the kitchen with one pup clinging to his curls, and the other resting against his shoulder.
At his Alpha's approval John's disappointed whimpers ceased, changing instead to encouraging purrs and mewls. He moaned happily, feeling the fat knot beginning to swell, his body beginning to tighten around his mate in preparation for keeping all of his seed inside the Omega, ready to make him more pups. His breathy cries grew more needy, rising to a higher and higher pitch, the implications obvious;
"No," Sherlock murmured. So many lost years. They should have had so much more time. If they hadn't met already so far into John's fertile years... If they'd overcome their fears and bred earlier... They had time yet, years ahead of them to raise their family, to grow old together - but the fierce, bright, primal need of heat, and the joy of conceiving another brood that would make John grow ripe and round and heavy, was numbered and fast dwindling. He pressed his nose into the Omega's hair and breathed in, far away in thought.
John chuckled at Sherlock's words. "Alright... Maybe not right this second. After a shower... But since we're showering anyway, I think we should have sex again first... I feel like I need to be stretched around that magnificent Alpha cock again," he purred seductively, pressing himself up against Sherlock hopefully.
"I love you too," John murmured back, happily pushing his face into his Alpha's neck, lapping submissively at his scent gland. He let his eyes slide shut and began to purr, tentatively at first, but growing louder as he felt the love pushing through the bond - not enough to disturb the guests, but enough for Sherlock to hear it. Soon he was purring steadily, a metronome of contented rumbling bracketed by soft inhales, ignoring the murder mystery entirely in favour of cuddling up to his Alpha, pawing lightly at his chest. He relaxed by degrees, pushing strong bursts of love and happiness through the bond, letting Sherlock know he felt better, and gradually grew more comfortable. His purring became mingled with grunting little snores as he fell asleep, and by the time the lights came back up he was fast asleep against his mate's shoulder, still clinging to his jacket, a blissful, peaceful smile on his face.
The Inspector blushed and licked his lips, considering. Her scent was attractive, delicately floral - pretty and sweet, just like her. It'd been ages since he'd felt like this with someone; he caught himself beginning to grin and bit it back, going redder. Christ, it was like he was a fifth former again, without the raging hormones. He noticed the pathologist looking at him curiously, and quietly cleared his throat, squeezing her hand reassuringly, and closing it further in his own. "I know," he said quietly, urged on by the blossoming of hopeful notes in her scent, "But you're making it very difficult for me to want to." Her eyes widened; for a moment, he thought she would pull away in fright.
Sherlock watched the young man's approach with a shrewd gaze, straining to hear the conversation. He wasn't sure what would produce a worse outcome - shouting at the lad, or leaving his place in line to run and protect his mate. The young man didn't seem to pose much of a threat, however, so the Alpha only growled low and shook his head vehemently at John. His Omega was perfectly capable of holding his own with strangers, and Sherlock knew John was already a bit exasperated by the Alpha's overprotectiveness during their excursion. On pins and needles, he decided he would let him handle things for now, but was ready to step in if the boy moved any closer to his mate.
John kept his face steadily calm during the exchange between the Alphas but brought his hands up to cover the bump at the mention of approval. He frowned, vaguely registering the use of the word
Sherlock paid the Beta's amorous expressions no mind, barely noticing them before dismissing them from his thoughts as if waving away a wisp of smoke. The servant wasn't competition or companion, and could not be used for the sorts of pleasure Sherlock sought; in short, he was utterly uninteresting aside from his usefulness as a waiter. Stroking his groaning, trembling mate's hair, he flipped idly through the discreet black binder that seemed to be a fixture in every room.
"You could have this, you know. A relationship like mine with Sherlock's," John replied quietly. "He respects me as his equal because I have my own mind, my own opinions - I've seen enough of the world that I've learned how to stand up for myself, how to hold my own in an argument, to form my own opinions and views. It seems scary, I know - it's so easy to feel lost when you're pushed out of your depth. I was horribly homesick when I left home for university and the army, but I came out the other side as a stronger person, a better person. Our pack will always support and care for you - and you don't have to stay here to help with these pups, I don't want you trapped here thinking you must help us. We'll be happy knowing you're happy. You're obviously very clever - Mycroft has been telling me how your tutors can't keep up with you," he praised, "so if you've found a subject you love, maybe going to university would be good for you - study it in more depth, meet more people your own age who love it too. The world is your oyster, Remington, and you know what? I think you can show Siger exactly how wrong he was about you. Prove that he was an idiot by being all you can be." He reached out to stroke the boy's hair, reaffirming their pack bond.
Sherlock purring grew deeper as he watched his Omega's gyrations, admiring John's pendulous, milk-soaked belly and breasts as the Omega arched his back and licked his lips, keening and whimpering. He smoothed his thumb over the plump head of his cock, and moaned softly as he smeared wet precome over the sensitive tissue. His gaze roamed slowly up and down the Omega's form, lingering on John's dripping thighs before roaming upwards to appreciate his exposed cock, swollen and painfully erect, standing out desperately from its black lace frame. The Alpha stretched languidly. The amount of approval he chose to show was crucial; praise John too much, too early, and the Omega might misunderstand his preferences. He watched as John's exposed belly began to glisten with sweat, a stray drop breaking away to roll slowly from his navel to his delicate undergarments. Sherlock licked his lips delicately. John's breasts were heaving, too; swelling beyond capacity to please the Alpha's desires, the nipples glistening and darkening. He watched as John tilted his head to bare his throat invitingly, squeezing his breasts, squirting thick jets of milk aimlessly onto the floor to relieve himself as he moaned, begging needily for his mate's cock. It was almost too good a show to give up, but his cock was beginning to twitch, his balls growing too heavy for comfort. He needed release. Finally, he had to relent, tugging on the Omega's leash with a commanding growl.
A dazed sort of grin spread across Sherlock's lips as the two boys continued. He could feel the tiny vibrations in their chests that accompanied the sounds, and it filled him with a warm love and growing sense of pride. Soon, he was feeling the tiny tremors on other parts of his body, as several of the other pups began to manage their siblings' accomplishment.
Sherlock watched in utter pride, purring to encourage Lestrade and Remington to take their fill, to drink as much as they wanted from his mate's heavy, milk-swollen breasts. The pack scenting had relaxed the young Alpha, the assurance, support, and love lowering his threshold of aggression and fierce possessiveness. Sherlock had experienced deep pleasure in watching the pack members stroke, nuzzle, and croon at his mate's enormous belly, admiring and honouring John and what Sherlock had done to him, and bonding with their pups. He'd found himself wanting to go further, desiring to share John's fullness even more with his family. The sight before him was gorgeous: the gravid Omega appeared a glowing fertility goddess, filled with his Alpha's cock as two pack members suckled at his immense breasts, the others paying tender, reverent attentions to his bulging womb. John was his, but like this he was a mother to all the pack, nourishing their family, deepening their ties.
Sherlock easily swallowed down the small amount of thin, impotent seed his Omega produced, continuing to work John's cock expertly in his mouth until the final pulses of the orgasm had faded. When he popped off wetly, he sat back for a moment just to watch John caress his own belly and praise him to their pups, his Alpha incredibly pleased at the scene before him, smirking with pride at what he had done to his mate. As much as he enjoyed looking on while his semen-covered Omega was laid out so prettily in front of him, crooning to his belly with spread legs, he felt an equally strong pull to join John, keep him closer. The Alpha eased himself down on the sheets next to his mate, turning John on his side and taking several long pulls from each round breast, further asserting his claim. Most of his own semen had already dried, but he dipped his finger into what little was left on the sheets, opening his Omega's pliant mouth and pressing it to his tongue; he grinned at how eagerly John swallowed the substance and licked his finger thoroughly afterwards, wanting all he could get. Sherlock withdrew his thumb and kissed John instead, his eyes dark and flashing proudly. "Mine. Say more," he said when he pulled back; his hands dropped down to cup his Omega's full belly to make his point, "Tell them how good I am to you."
Sherlock had been holed away, unmoving, in his mind palace for the entirety of John's shift, the black cloud John's departure never leaving him. His Omega's scent began to bring him back to reality, the fragrance tainted with the smells of others - Omegas, Betas, but no Alphas, he realized. He could smell the food on the kitchen counter, as well, his mate's attempt to please him. The attempt was even clearer when he sensed John at his side, his uneasiness made clear through their bond. The Alpha rolled over slowly, looking his naked mate up and down with sorrowful eyes.
. He hushed more of John's whines, groping a sticky beast in one hand. Continuing to rut, he began to grow harder, even needier, the effects of the aphrodisiac more intense in his excitement. "Mine," he growled,
Sherlock licked his lips at the sight of the naked, gravid Omega writhing and mewling on the sheets. John's breasts jiggled and swayed as he begged, the nipples large, dark, and plump, pert in their fullness, drops of creamy milk already beginning to force their way out of the tips. The Alpha traced a finger down John's spine and between his legs, tracing the wetness of the Omega's hole with teasing promise before moving to open the box that contained the pump.
"You've dropped at least another five already," Sherlock growled, "I can smell it on you. You were made for this, made to waddle around with a big, ripe belly of my babies on your front, made to swell and birth and then swell again for me." The bed was shaking with the Alpha's thrusts. His thighs were trembling with the exertion as he felt another release building, his nearly-spent cock filling with a third wave of seed. "I'm going to give you another full litter, breed you until your belly's spilling past your knees again, remind you what it's like to be
"Hush, love, I know," he soothed. "I know you'd never hurt me on purpose. I won't have safewords," he said fiercely, "we don't need them. We just need to communicate more about what we want and expect out of sex and intimacy. We can talk about it later," he purred, still rocking his mate, rubbing his back, giving him the comfort he needed, crooning softly as Sherlock's hands moved uncertainly to his fly. "Yes, love," he consented softly. "Whatever you need," he agreed, pliantly letting Sherlock tug off his jeans and jacket, kissing his Alpha's lips. "Love you. My Alpha. Yours, always and only yours," he breathed into his ear, knowing his mate needed to hear it. "I'll never want anyone else, couldn't ever want anyone else. I love you, I love you," he murmured, stroking his Alpha's cheek with one hand, looping the other arm around his back in an embrace. The Alpha whined a little as he pulled at John's clothing, until the Omega was completely naked and laid out on the sun-warmed tile floor. He gazed up at his apprehensive, saddened Alpha and spread his legs invitingly. "Come on, Sherlock. I'm yours. Come inside me, love." He hadn't realised Sherlock would be so affected by his words; the pain had been a slight dull ache, like the ache when he
Siger's signet ring had cut a shallow gash across his cheekbone when he delivered the blow, but it was no more than a scratch as far as Sherlock was concerned. He'd endure far worse if it meant protecting John. The youngest Alpha kept his stance, his feet planted firmly apart, teeth bared in threat as he growled low and deep in his throat.
Sherlock lifted the lid of the box within, and inhaled sharply. Thirteen hand-knitted hats and booties, in the thirteen colours they'd chosen for their children, were nestled lovingly within. "John..," he almost choked, passing the box to his Omega to see. They'd shared their plans for the nursery with the landlady, although she'd not been allowed in their nest - and obviously she'd kept them perfectly in her memory. They were skilfully done, and obviously had taken ages to make as a result of the sheer quantity of them. "This...," he began, looking up at Mrs Hudson with slightly wet eyes, "Thank you..." He rose to give the elderly lady a kiss on the cheek, huffing in surprise when she pulled him into a tight hug.
he noted as he quickly cleaned it, the baby wailing loudly as he brought her to John for scenting and her first meal. John's sandy-coloured hair dried into airy curls on her head, which were quickly hidden by a pink knit hat.
enough - but you're very pretty and it's time you acknowledged that. I mean look at you, with your prefect little arched eyebrows, big trusting eyes and cute as a button nose," he smiled warmly, pleased at her deepening blush and lessening sniffles. He knew his little speech had been a risky one; it could have reminded her that she wanted to be enough
"Mmm," John hummed thoughtfully, stretching and dropping his hands to rub them in small circles on his  belly. "I reckon I'd only be able to take about half of you. You'd feel my walls around your cock, but it'd only be a light grip..." He sighed happily and rolled his hips, obviously enjoying the feeling of Sherlock's stiff cock pulsing inside him. "I'd be so
"I know, Sherlock," he breathed softly, capturing his Alpha's lips in a grateful kiss. "I love you. Normally I wouldn't be so distressed, I think the pregnancy hormones are kicking in. It'll be a bit haywire for a while I'm afraid but it should settle down..." he smiled. His heart swelled with love for his incredible Alpha and he couldn't wait to show everyone his bump, rub their faces in how virile Sherlock was. "I want to do something for you, Sherlock," he purred into his ear, kissing up his neck and sucking lightly on his earlobe. He leaned in close before whispering intimately. "I want to suck you."
"Oh, I'm sorry princess," John soothed, reaching for the wailing pup and lifting her to his breast, cuddling her close. "There now, that's better, isn't it?" Eleanor whimpered and burrowed into his neck, clinging to him and settling with a soft huff. Her brother was settling in Sherlock's arms as well; Alistair had relinquished his grip on his father's arm and was trying to grab the droplets in his fists, cooing and giggling as the water splashed off him. He turned his face up to his father and burbled happily, beaming widely, as if to say look Daddy, this is brilliant!
Sherlock hushed his mate with a hand on John's belly, cupping a handful of warm bathwater and smoothing it over the swell. His eyes grew darker, and he purred deep in his throat. "Good Omega," he rumbled quietly in John's ear, the head of his cock already creating a firm pressure against his mate's entrance. "That's
radiated strongly from the Alpha. Thirteen perfect, healthy pups. He'd bred his mate, filled him full of his pups, watched John grow and swell and birth like he was made to, and now they were parents - father and mother to a litter of a truly incredible size. Sherlock nuzzled John's neck and cheek happily as he watched them all, showering his Omega with affections.
"Yeah..." Alistair echoed, continuing his crawl up onto Sherlock's chest. He settled down next to Felix, placing an arm around his brother.
John grunted as the next pup crowned, the stretch less painful than it had been with the first, and cooed softly to his son as he felt the head slip free, panting as he pushed hard and with a wet slide delivered the next baby into his Alpha's hands. He turned to look at him, mewling in enquiry, beaming when Sherlock held the boy up for him to see. Another shock of dark hair, but this time without curls. John's eyes sparkled as his mate shuffled back up the bed, pressing the cleaned and swaddled pup to his breast to nurse. He cradled the baby in the crook of one arm, purring, looking to his mate for approval of the two healthy sons he'd birthed so far.
Sherlock growled, John's pleasure made obvious by his words and actions. His fantasy had been a little more appealing, to be certain - John contracting tightly around him, crying out as Sherlock's cock kept his passage open despite his body's best attempts to squeeze down - but the Omega's description of the reality was enough. He gripped John by his shoulders, and in one swift move, flipped him onto his back with an animal snarl and began to take him hard and fast.
John smiled, watching as Mycroft smoothed his hands across the swell of his mate's gravid belly. Greg was scenting Molly as well, blissfully unaware that he was growling under his breath. The sight made John want his own Alpha, and when Jasper and Percival had finished nursing he brought them both into the nest, settling close to Sherlock.
"You mean someone boring," Sherlock answered, not bothering to conceal his contempt for the kind of Omega John had described, "No one is incredible but you. Not even Irene." Irene had been intriguing, but the Alpha had never had the slightest interest in bonding with her; it had been an understood fact between them, and while the other Omega had tried for a brief fling, Sherlock had refused flatly. John was his only interest, the only Omega he'd ever considered bonding with. There had been other propositions over the years, but the detective had turned his nose up at all of them - he had no use for a snivelling, dependent incubator, he'd thought. But John was nothing like that; even completely Omega, he was astounding, perfect. He nuzzled his mate back, breathing in his Omega's scent, humming softly. "No one else. Not ever. You never have to be afraid again."
Sherlock sniffed, trying not to show his incredible interest in the case. John had a tendency to be irritatingly on point about the Alpha's desires. The case
"I did," Sherlock answered. He gently took John's hands and twined their fingers together, guiding the Omega over to a chair in front of Lestrade's desk, and pulling the man down onto his lap. "Now, to business," he began, gathering John closer against him as he spoke, shifting pointedly so the Omega could feel his arousal pressing through his trousers. Sherlock kept himself perfectly composed, explaining to Lestrade the significance of the symbols painted on the bodies even as he grew harder under the Omega because of John's protective display.
Sherlock nipped ferally at the Omega, driving his cock hard into his mate, his eyes dark. He gripped the collar between his teeth and tugged back on it just a little, just enough to briefly restrict John's breathing; the second's message was clear,
Mycroft knocked at the door, as was traditional, and John called out to him with permission to enter. The pack Alpha stepped into the nest and for a moment he was dumbstruck - he knew they were having thirteen babies, of course, but the sight of it was something he hadn't anticipated. Thirteen perfectly formed tiny humans, all obvious mixes of Sherlock and John - and even a couple with his own auburn hair.
Sherlock sent quietly, sighing fondly and closing his eyes as he nursed, settling safe and warm against his mate. He purred as he felt John's hand in his curls.
Sherlock obediently kept his mouth shut for nearly the entire length of the film, bravely and stoically enduring each cliché and the absolute impossibility of most of the storyline. At a few moments, he opened his mouth to protest the utter absurdity of it all - but catching the captivated look John's face as the Omega stared at the screen was enough to silence him before he even began. John's happiness was oddly contagious, and Sherlock even found himself beginning to relax and think less about the film as time wore on, his mate's contentment pulsing through their bond.
John mewled submissively and rocked back onto his mate's still-hard cock, all but fucking himself on it. "Yes, yes, I need it, oh god," he whined plaintively, giving high-pitched little grunts as he moved, his tight but pliant hole dragging wonderfully along his Alpha's thick shaft. "Can't get enough of you today," he moaned, "can't think of anything else... want you to claim me over and over, even when our guests get here I want you to sit me on your cock and bounce me in your lap in front of everyone so they can all see how you own me... ohhhh, fuck!" He licked his lips, his breathing laboured, as he continued fucking himself on Sherlock's cock, the water rippling and splashing around his massive belly.
He moaned wantonly as he dragged the flat of his tongue over the servant's leaking hole, revelling in the heavenly scent and taste, pushing his face against the other Omega's arse and eating him out until his face was shiny with it. John’s cock throbbed violently when he realised he could taste the three Alphas who had bred the club Omega in the man’s slick; there was a hint of firewood that belonged to one, the tang of salt and sea air from another, and coffee from the third. The scents told him that the three Alphas were not of one pack, and images of the servant being bred for show at the club by paying members flashed through John’s mind, made him squirm helplessly with lust.
"Oh fuck," John whimpered needily, Sherlock's words going straight to his cock. "Yes Sherlock, yes, make me beg, beg you to fuck me as I lie there huge and swollen with your litter of thirteen... everyone will know how often I'll be begging for your cock... at this rate I won't even be able to hide the bump for six weeks, you're making me swell and grow with your pups so fast... if you keep suckling from me like that my breasts will grow sooner too and they're much harder to hide," he groaned, blushing a little at the thought. He began to cant his hips gently to rub his small cock against his Alpha's stomach, unbelievably turned on, certain that by now he was so wet Sherlock would feel the fluid begin to drip onto his thighs. "So hungry for my milk, aren't you?" he purred, squeezing his breast for Sherlock again, wanting to beg desperately for his cock right that second but wanting to see Sherlock as mad with need for him as he felt. "You love that you've done this to me... look at me already, only two weeks carrying your enormous brood and already looking four months gone... already making milk just because you wanted it..."
John mewled in pain at the bites but bore them stoically, his submission forcing him to take whatever his master wanted to give him. When Sherlock tugged on his collar he bucked his hips back against him, dropping his head the instant he was let go to fully expose the back of his neck to his Alpha, his breathing growing laboured and his sounds growing louder, more pained and desperate as he was fucked.
"Mmm... my Alpha's ready to give me what I need, hey?" John purred playfully. "On your back, gorgeous. I want to ride you," he murmured huskily, "I want to see you. Want you." Sending a pulse of lust and love through their bond, the Omega gently encouraged his mate onto his back and with some difficulty he shifted himself to straddle Sherlock, sinking onto his massive cock. He mewled in pleasure as he felt the Alpha's hands on his plump hips, placing his hands on top of his mate's and clasping them. "I love you," he whispered, gazing down at the detective, "I love you so much, Sherlock. My gorgeous, clever detective. You've always been my Alpha, right from the start."
Sherlock replied, pushing in farther, increasing his pace in response to his mate's need. He kissed John deeply, fucking him faster, moaning in pleasure as he felt John's swollen belly pressing against his own middle.
Sherlock took the collar, but first placed his other hand in John's hair, stroking it with reverence. He purred lowly, looking into the Omega's eyes. "You... are the most perfect, most loving, most gorgeous Omega I have ever laid eyes on," he said, his tone full of an infinite tenderness, "And I count myself so
As he danced he watched Sherlock stroking himself, mouth watering at the thought of his prize, and the sight encouraged him to display himself more wantonly. He squeezed his breasts, spilling milk over the dark silk draped across his swollen stomach, slid his hands down to cup his belly and lift it, showing off the weight he was carrying to entice the Alpha. John twirled and snaked his hips and caressed himself, lustful and uninhibited, all the while moaning and panting and keening as he watched his mate for signs of approval.
"Go ahead," John said evenly, carding a hand through Sherlock's hair. "Sherlock is going to finish his feed, but he can stop to answer your questions. Can't you sweetheart?" He smiled when the Alpha mumbled a tiny
"We'd best get these little ones to bed," John said softly, his tone full of meaning. "They can't sleep here..." As if on cue, Beatrice and Mrs Hudson walked in, followed quickly by Catherine and Remington; in no time each of the pups was ready for bed and sleeping soundly in their cot, snuggled up with their new bears. "We'll just be in the lounge if you need anything, boys," Mrs Hudson chirped, switching on the baby monitors as she retreated from the nest.
.' Hesitating, he remembered that his knot would never swell so much as to hurt John; as soon as John signalled pain or alarm, the Alpha's knot would deflate instantaneously. He moaned softly, taking his thrusts slowly deeper.
, he pushed through the bond, smirking. "Get up on your hands and knees," he ordered, "I'm going to mount you and take you like the animal you are."
He was beyond speech, beyond being able to think of anything but his Alpha's lips and tongue exploring his wet hole; they hadn't indulged since the pups had been born, and John was suddenly a little apprehensive that having birthed thirteen babies would mean the experience wasn't as pleasant for his mate.
Through the haze of urgency and anger, the Alpha suddenly felt a calming wave of love roll through him. In the back of the cab, his hands came to rest over his heart, and he swallowed back tears. John. Wherever he was, John was feeling love for him, so intentionally and strongly as to send it to Sherlock; it was as if he was sending him a message on a mobile phone, but one of emotions rather than words. They were still connected, Sherlock thought, and they could use that, no matter what. The Alpha focused hard, sending a mixture of concern and love towards his mate, hoping for a response that would tell him more about the Omega's current situation.
The Alpha was rapidly building to another climax, each hard thrust bringing him closer, making his knot swell and catch a little more on John's hole. The room was filled with the sounds of skin slapping slickly against skin, and with powerful Alpha growls and whorish Omega moans.
Sherlock stuck his tongue out at his sibling, but said nothing. It would be silly to feel hurt - it was to be expected that the pups wouldn't be excited by dinner, after all, when there was nothing on the table they could eat. Next year they'd be one, and he'd come up with a special menu of children's food to keep them busy and happy. But most of them seemed contented even now, shaking the rattles or cuddling with the teddies they'd brought with them. When Iris and Imogen seemed quieted enough, Sherlock let them both down a little to sit in his lap and play quietly with one another while he finished his lukewarm food. Soon enough, the rest of the pack had finished their dinners as well, and it was time for the Christmas pudding. Beatrice, Catherine, and Mrs. Hudson efficiently cleared the plates, and went to the kitchen to retrieve the cake.
"Well, congratulations," he said honestly, "I'm really happy for both of you. It'll be lovely having some cousins for this lot." Imogen began to shift in her seat, dissatisfied that she wasn't getting any attention; she was seated between Sherlock and John and they were both engrossed in discussing the new arrivals. She half-hiccupped and whimpered, reaching her chubby little arms out, straining to get to her father - before letting out a plaintive wail that was unmistakeably "
your knot must be to have held enough come inside me to fertilise thirteen eggs..." He smiled coyly. "Let's get in a cab... there will be too many
. He had bred John and these were the incredible results, tiny combinations of both their DNA. He purred deeply, looking over only a fraction of their family. The Alpha turned to kiss his labouring mate, showering him in approval through their bond;
John moaned in triumph and swallowed a few mouthfuls before pulling off, letting it pulse across his cheeks then down over his breasts and belly, drenched in his Alpha's come, beginning to rub it into his own skin happily when his mate had finally finished coming. He felt a little drunk on his seed again, submissive and pliant and Omega, and didn't even realise he was purring as he licked his lips clean and continued to massage his mate's come into his gravid belly. He rolled onto his back and smoothed his hands over his small breasts, smearing Sherlock's spilled seed all over his chest, ensuring he was thoroughly marked while Sherlock lay there panting, recovering. He wondered idly if Mycroft was still listening. He climbed onto Sherlock, straddling his lap, pushing his belly forward in a silent demand to be rubbed and worshipped.
"Not at all," Victor returned smoothly, watching with a hint of amusement as John arranged himself in Sherlock's lap, clinging to him, fawning over him and purring absently to himself. "We were a little late actually - Caroline didn't want to let of of Ollie and we had quite a job convincing her to stay at nursery," he added, smiling and exchanging a fond glance with his mate.
John pressed close to Sherlock in the cab, trying to climb into his lap, rubbing against him insistently, mewling for skin-on-skin contact, to be knotted. The pups were kicking in his belly, sensitive to the danger that had just passed, and he wanted his Alpha's touch to calm them. He would never quite remember how they got back to the nest from the Landau, but later he would recall the way his mate undressed him and held him; desperate, needy, relieved. "Please," John breathed, wriggling in his arms, "please, you, safe. Knot."
John let the Alphas talk, not bothering to follow the conversation, simply enjoying his Alpha's heat and presence, feeling the vibrations in his chest. He had never felt so secure. He couldn't wait to birth the pups, knowing how much it would please Sherlock, who would praise him and worship his belly and milk him to help the pups feed. The thought made his breasts start to leak milk, just a little. He whimpered at the sensation, his breasts all but empty. He would have got up for tissues to mop it up, but then he felt something else, something in his belly. He gasped and pressed his hand to the bottom of his gravid bump. One of the pups had moved.
The Omega continued to fuck himself vigorously on the toy, his face open and trusting as he kept his eyes locked on his Alpha. He licked his lips and moaned brokenly when the toy swelled a little further inside him, stretching him, making him ready and open to take his mate's enormous member.
Sherlock, ah - mmm, feels so good, oh goooood... I love it when you make me take it, when you hold me down and take exactly what you want... it's so goddamn sexy... ah, yes, yes, please, Sherlock, give it - harder - " He began to pant more heavily, his breasts heaving and bouncing. He cupped them in his hands, ran his fingers lightly over his sensitive leaking nipples. "Yes, oh, yes, Sherlock, I love having your huge cock inside me, can't get enough... I knew you had a big cock before we bonded, all those times you paraded around in a sheet, and I -" he bit his lip before continuing, a slight blush on his cheeks, "I went and got a bigger toy, so it'd feel more like you, and I'd fuck myself on it while I rubbed my face against your pillowcase... sometimes I couldn't stop myself moaning your name..." He was keening with every exhale now, his little cock throbbing in his mate's hand, his skin flushed and shining with a thin sheen of sweat, utterly wanton and debauched. "Oh god,
Mycroft almost swore aloud at the traffic, every traffic light he met mysteriously turning green, impatient and apprehensive. His stomach was tying itself in knots and suddenly he felt six years old, called into his father's study to be belted for some minor infraction. He lifted his wrist to his nose and sniffed delicately. Fear. Well, he thought wryly, some things never change.
inside him, panting lightly. "Oh god, Sherlock... this is where I'm going to birth your pups," he whispered darkly, a smile spreading across his face as his pleasure built. "This is where I'll swell so big I can't
His maternal scent continued to wrap around Sherlock in sweet, comforting tendrils, enveloping him in love and security.
John's movements were so slow and languorous as he came that Sherlock nearly thought he'd failed to satisfy his mate as well as John had wanted, until he felt the Omega's release. No, John was not thrashing as his small cock spurted uselessly between them, but this was something ... better, the Alpha realized, something he'd never felt from his partner before. It was so consuming, so complete - and before he knew it, his own body was responding as well, a knot inflating quickly at the base of his cock. Two more short thrusts found them bound together, their feelings swelling and enveloping them both through bond until the boundaries between Alpha and Omega, between Sherlock and John, blurred. For a moment, there was only them, and Sherlock was not sure which hands or skin were his, which mouth - only that it felt absolutely glorious as they somehow managed to continue their motions, lost in a rolling sea of absolute, loving bliss.
He pressed a reassuring, soft kiss to the tip of John's nose, the corners of his eyes crinkling when he smiled. He kissed John again, this time his lips pressing to his mate's, and purred lowly.
to fuck me or bond with me or breed with me," he insisted again, still close to tears at the painful thought. "You're not even trying to look for that thing you need anymore... you're... you're going to fuck me, aren't you?" he gasped, half-hopeful, half-afraid.
The Alpha slicked his hand with pre-come from his own cock, before wrapping his fingers around John's small, erect member. He began to pump slowly, his thumb paying special attention to the sensitive head, moving over the glans and John's leaking slit with just the right amount of pressure. He rutted his own cock against John's heavy belly, his free hand sensually moving across the stretched skin.
The last one slipped out without John intending it to, but it was too late; he had begun to slide back into his Omega, to become incoherent with want as he ached for his mate.
John pressed his face into the crook of Sherlock's neck, opposite Felix, and the pup reached out to touch his mother's face, cooing gently. Sherlock's scent calmed and reassured him, and he felt much better for hearing the Alpha's promises through their bond.
John offered him a quiet purr and a tiny smile, rubbing his bump. "Babies are riled up," he murmured. "Need Daddy's touch." When Sherlock approached, still hesitant, he pulled the hem of the shirt up to sit at the top of his belly, exposing his rounded swell for his Alpha's touch. He pulled the blanket over both of them and closed his eyes as his mate stroked and massaged his swollen middle, calming the pups. "Daddy always takes care of us," John purred happily to the pups, rubbing his belly with his mate. "So warm in the blanket Daddy bought us, nice and cosy in the pyjamas he fetched for me. Daddy's such a good Alpha, loves us more than anything in the world. Yes, that's better, isn't it? You're always calmer when Daddy's stroking us." He rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder, warm and happy. He licked his cheek affectionately just as the oven bleeped.
make her grow enormous with a mixed litter of pups for our pack... In the end, we purchased an Omega from this club and bred him together.
," he whined, fucking himself more desperately on his fingers, his hand making obscene slick wet noises as it moved, his lubrication now dripping down his thighs and pooling on the floor. "Ahhh.. fuck, please, hold me down and
these triplets, that he didn't want the Alpha to continue to punish himself for it. He knew that mistakes had always been harshly punished by Siger, but there was tenderness and love in their bond that had been sadly absent from the relationship between father and son.
Sherlock cleared his throat slightly, and put on his best apologetic smile. "Actually, John and I were rather hoping to tour this one on our own." "Oh?" Mary asked, looking a bit taken aback. She opened her mouth to enquire the reason, but the Alpha headed her off, "We can always find our own way to the last place if you don't want to wait around - or possibly home, if my Omega begins to feel too tired." His hand moved up the bump to rest on where the swell began right under his Omega's round breasts, thumb sneakily beginning to rub small circles along the side of one of the pert mounds. The agent seemed confused and almost a bit offended, but Sherlock had obviously closed the conversation and she could only nod in understanding, unlocking the last place with the request for them to call her if they decided to see the last home that day.
When the pack leader finished soothing the wound, the younger Alpha dropped to the ground and rolled over on his back, exposed and vulnerable to his sibling. He whined once more, looking for all the world like a puppy seeking its master's approval - much like John did in his Omega state.
Sherlock responded to his mate with a deep, low, rumbling purr, readily offering him all the affections he was asked for until he was called to attention by a deeper purr than his own. Mycroft had lingered, though the pack Alpha now stood beside the low bed, towering proudly over his brother. Sherlock immediately dropped his eyes out of deference, only to feel a strong nose nuzzling his temple moments later, a large hand caressing his cheek. The young Alpha closed his eyes. His sibling's purring resonated throughout his body, washing Sherlock in approval, gratitude, and love.
," he gasped and groaned, rocking faster with him, overjoyed to be so full of him, knowing he'd soon give the man six daughters and seven sons and eagerly take the next litter his Alpha wanted to fuck into him. Happy tears began to spill down his cheeks as his litany of
"I'm going to beg for it," he promised, "After birthing thirteen in one go, three will be simple, I'll be awake for all of my micro-heat and I'll beg you to put more of your babies in me..."
Beatrice's grey eyes finally snapped their undivided attention to her son, widening in a moment of painful recognition. Her face crumpled immediately. A sob escaped the Omega's throat as she began to curl in on herself. Sherlock dropped his head to her shoulder, burrowing his face against her neck. "I'm so sorry," he breathed.
"Glad we've got that sorted," John said briskly, snapping the Alphas back to attention. "Now look, I know why it happened. Sherlock was sick, we needed to take care of him and this was the fastest way to get him back to normal. I know our hormones went mad, I know it got out of hand, and I know none of you buy into that Alpha supremacist bullshit. I know none of you would ever force an Omega to do anything against their will. I'm glad we're closer as a pack." His voice was steely but even, and he paused to exhale hard through his nose. "That said, if EITHER of you EVER even come CLOSE to behaviour like that again, I will throw you out of the house and refuse to let you back in for a MONTH!" The Alphas paled; pack bonds could easily weaken over the course of a month, as well as the fact they'd lose the benefits of socialising with the pups - lowered blood pressure, increased serotonin levels, stronger imprints on the pack scent. It risked the pups being a little unfamiliar with them when they were finally allowed back in.
When they were dry and dressed again, curled up on the sofa, he pulled out a paint catalogue and began thumbing through it, pointing out the colours he liked to Sherlock, saying which ones he thought would work in each room. Greens and blues predominated, mixed with earthy browns and creams, with a soft pale buttercup yellow for the nursery. "I thought as a theme... Maybe bees?" he said shyly. "I know you like them, and our nursery will be a constant
"More than you can imagine," Sherlock purred, "I would watch you in your chair, a free, unbonded Omega, drinking your tea and reading your mundane newspaper. I would imagine myself walking from the kitchen to the sitting room, collar in hand - securing the leather around your pretty neck before you could even turn 'round. I'd order you to stand and pull down your trousers, then command you to drop to all fours on the living room rug. I'd mount you, claim you, breed you as you sobbed for more, confused and in sudden heat, obedient to my every request."
The Alpha could vaguely hear the sounds of the guests entering the reception room. Voices chatted happily, chairs shifted, and before long, the couple was notified it was time. Sherlock smiled warmly at his mate. "Shall we, my wife?" He gripped the back of John's chair, wheeling his mate from the anteroom as the toastmaster announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, please be upstanding to greet the new Mr and Mrs Holmes-Watson."
John nodded vaguely and licked his lips, snaking a hand out to steal one of the hash browns from Sherlock's plate and munching on it contemplatively as Sherlock picked at his food. He began to rub his swollen belly in increasingly bigger circles, closing his eyes lazily as he felt his stomach protest at the volume of food he'd forced into it. "I'm going to get changed," he purred playfully, gripping the edge of the table to help heave himself to his feet. "You stay here and finish your breakfast... don't come through until I call you, it's a surprise," he said sternly, kissing his Alpha's nose and waddling away towards the nest.
relief. He struggled out of his jumper, exposing his belly, unhooking the clasp of his bra with one hand as he pushed Sherlock onto the nearest sofa and straddled him. He cupped his breasts, rolling them in his hands, keening as they leaked more freely. "Sherlock... please..." he moaned, kneading his twin mounds and gasping softly as milk spurted out of them in jets, forced out by the pressure Sherlock had allowed to build.
enough to insist on having you here, and you are repaying him poorly for his trust. However, considering his
Pictures of just after they'd bonded, taken by John; pictures of the Omega's growing belly, when the first thirteen were no bigger than little grapes, then becoming bigger, forcing their mother's middle outwards, until John's belly was at the middle of his thighs, the end of his knees-
Sherlock had washed quickly and quietly, the Alpha absently scrubbing himself as he watched John get clean. His Omega, washing the evidence of his claim away. John had not noticed as Sherlock grew even harder with each bit of his seed that disappeared from John's skin and down the drain. His erection wet and throbbing, he'd inched closer to his oblivious mate, licking his lips in anticipation as he watched the suds running over John's shapely hips and full arse. This Omega was
There was a short pause as John nuzzled and burrowed further into the warmth of Sherlock's chest before the Omega took a deep breath and spoke. "Yes," he murmured honestly. "I want your collar. I want you to be able to take me to Pendleton's, earn the respect of the clientele - it'd be useful for work, but more than that, it would show them all how very wrong about you Siger was... Show them all how you're a strong, worthy Alpha, with an Omega who adores him and a father of thirteen with three more on the way... I want to be able to feel it around my neck when you're not here, or if we have to visit a particularly traditional household for a case... Besides, I think you'd like it, wouldn't you? Having me naked but for a collar, purring invitingly and spreading my legs for you even as I caress my swollen, pregnant belly full of the pups you put in me..." He lapped gently at his mate's chest, pushing affection and security through the bond.
"Aahh!" John gasped in surprise and pleasure, his whole body jerking as a shiver ran up his spine. The buzz against his prostate, the extra stretch from the thickening toy, the lust-darkened expression on his Alpha's face, it all combined to push him even closer to his orgasm; not quite in subspace yet he knew he
, another Alpha. He looked up at his mate, his eyes showing his exhaustion after so many hours of labour; six hours already, and still another four to go. Adam was waking from his sleep and began to cry for more milk; John shifted Alistair to his other breast so Adam could have the nearest one and let his mate pick up the crying baby to help him feed. He cradled the two boys as they nursed side by side, smiling serenely, crooning to them. He glanced over at Sherlock, who was busy tending to their other pups, nuzzling and scenting them, making sure they were warm enough, and mewed softly.
"I'll keep my mouth shut, then," Sherlock smiled. "It would be unfair for me to really play anyway." He took the advantage of the wait to lean in and kiss his adoring mate once more, placing both hands on the swollen belly that was now beginning to extend beyond John's knees. When they broke apart, he let his gaze drop briefly to John's swollen breasts, unfortunately (in his opinion) well-covered by the dress. "You'll have to let me know when you need to take care of these," he murmured, cupping the heavy mounds shamelessly, and smirked at the blush rising on his Omega's cheeks.
Sherlock purred, turning back to his Omega. "I know," he rumbled, slowly licking away one fat drop from a nipple, only to have it rapidly replaced with another, which quickly broke and rolled down the Omega's large breast, "Isn't it gorgeous?" The Alpha smirked and looked up through his lashes at his mate, rubbing John's belly approvingly as he latched on. He waited to suckle for a moment, giving a hum of pleasure as the difference in pressure did the work of drawing John's milk out for him. "So
The Alpha paused as soon as he crossed the threshold, having to let out a breath to steady himself. "
He grunted as he moved faster, gripping John's hips with both hands and taking full advantage of the position.
At some apparently invisible signal the pianist in the corner began to play and a hush descended on the room as the first few bars of Rachmaninov's
?" John admonished gently. "I have someone in mind, we served together in Afghanistan. He got back last week, six months of leave. As for rings... I have an idea... I saw some in a shop a while back, look like plain silver, but hidden inside the band there's a tiny saw blade and lock pick... They'll probably come in handy and it'd be our little secret," he grinned. "If you want something more... traditional, we could have some custom designed instead?"
continued, growing in volume. It didn't take him long to come, feeling so many sensations at once. He clenched and writhed on Sherlock's cock, screaming in pleasure, rocking faster to encourage his Alpha.
As soon as they were in the cab, the Alpha pulled his mate onto his lap, purring quietly, running his hands possessively over John's heavy belly in hopes of stimulating the Omega to produce more milk. John mewled quietly as Sherlock rubbed his belly, his navel still exposed; he had a feeling it wasn't going to go back in until after the birth, now. He guided his mate's hands to where some of the pups were moving, moaning softly as Sherlock's touch woke the rest of them, and then he felt his Alpha's demanding mouth suckling at his scent gland and the familiar slight ache in his breasts began as they filled to capacity with milk. By the time they got home all John could do was whine, struggle out of his clothes and crawl onto the bed, writhing as he begged Sherlock to hurry and set up the pump.
Sherlock didn't need to stroke himself to hardness in preparation for entering his Omega; he was already fully erect, just his hands on John's belly enough to interest his cock. The Alpha purred as he draped an arm over his mate, caressing John's gravid middle once more. A breathy groan escaped his lips as pressed inside John's tight heat easily. He began to rock them both together in a gentle, slow rhythm. "It was nothing," he murmured as he pressed a kiss to the hollow behind John's jaw. He suddenly felt embarrassed of his mate catching him in such a moment. "I was... teaching them about the outside world. Explaining winter and snow ...," he cleared his throat gently, blushing, "And how they have such a brilliant mother."
The doctor blinked once, and contemplated the necessity of ordering a CT scan for the Alpha. "Alright. Name them," she challenged.
swell. Small, but unmistakably a pregnancy. He beamed and ran his hand over it. Solid. The babies had filled the available internal space and were beginning to grow outward. He showered quickly, drying his hair to make it fluffy and warm, then threw on his dressing gown and sauntered through to the kitchen. "Morning, love," he smiled, kissing Sherlock's cheek. "I’ve got something to show you…" He stepped back and dropped his robe to the floor, smiling shyly at Sherlock, and turned sideways to display his little bump.
"Open the larger one first," he explained when he sank down on the mattress, handing John both gold-wrapped parcels. He said nothing more in the face of John's curiosity, only motioning for the Omega to open what he'd been given, his pupils dilating in anticipation as John tore away the paper and lifted the lid of the rich red box underneath. The air seemed to vibrate with anticipation as he lifted the lid.
His face lost some of its tension and he panted open-mouthed, grinding his hips down onto Sherlock's eager mouth just a little, pliantly surrendering and letting his mate push his thighs further apart to give him better access. The Alpha's tongue felt unbelievably good inside him, encouraging him open, and John was quivering before he knew it; he felt like he could come just from Sherlock eating him out, although he never had before. "G-
"The bigger I get, the longer I'll knot you," Sherlock growled, nipping at John's earlobe, "Though it varies, of course - the more desperate you are, the longer the knot will stay inflated." His fingertips just brushed the base of the Omega's erection through his trousers, but went no further, retreating back up the heavy curve of John's gravid belly. "And if I mean to get you pregnant, of course...," he hummed, massaging the skin. John tried to squirm underneath him and the Alpha's grin grew wider. "Am I going to make you come in your trousers, John?" he asked innocently, "With my hands on your big belly? So gravid, so fecund... I love seeing you waddle with this on your front, though it was most pleasing when you couldn't
again." He waited for Siger's grudging nod before stepping back, slowly withdrawing the blade. Quick as a flash he flicked his wrist, cutting a deep gash across his sire's cheek, a mark of his defeat. The older Alpha grunted but bore it, eyes defiantly raised.
Sherlock looked up and smiled at his love from underneath the pile of their babies. Lucy, placed next to his head, tugged curiously at his curls, her eyes wide with wonder and delight. Blake was also exploring the softness of his sire's dark hair, rather uncoordinatedly trying to pet it by repeatedly hitting his small hand against it, the Omega pup's expression every bit as focused and determined as his father's when he was on a case. Pups were cozied up to Sherlock's side, draped over his legs, nestled in the curve between his neck and shoulder. He chuckled when he felt a tiny pink tongue begin to lap interestedly at his elbow, Alistair apparently trying to scent his father though the taste.
Sherlock resisted the touch for a moment to turn on the water of the shower, soaking them both. He kissed along John's shoulders, his hands moving quickly but not urgently along with his Omega's, traveling up to John's breasts. He cupped them lightly as he rocked against John's hole, the tip of his cock just pressing against the slick entrance, hushing John's whines by suckling his Omega's scent gland, before pushing in all the way, squeezing John's breasts simultaneously as he thrust in. Healthy streams of milk spurted against the walls in time with the Alpha's thrusting; he kept up a steady pace, drawing out both their pleasures. "Tomorrow you'll have pumps on you," he growled, dropping one hand down to John's belly and rubbing the swollen mound that contained their pups, "I'll have you on your hands and knees, be able to keep both hands on you like this while they do all the work milking your heavy teats, your belly hanging low, pushing towards the floor... fuck, you'll look so good for me, my Omega."
Sherlock pointed to a different white crib; an image next to it showed that it could easily be converted into a toddler bed - they would only need to buy a different kit to replace the crib bars with low wooden railings when the time came. "It doesn't have the storage space of yours, however," he noted, "But it would save us the cost of thirteen intermediate-sized beds in the long run. We might consider buying small chests of drawers to fit at the end of each one - it would save you some of the bending down the under-bed storage might require. And they could become nightstands or some such nonsense later on when they move to larger beds." He look back at Johns selection approvingly, however, one arm snaking around his Omega's back and rubbing the side of John's well-defined belly.
Sherlock blinked stupidly for a moment. John was always the vocal one in their lovemaking; Sherlock panted, purred, moaned, growled - but rarely vocalized his pleasure verbally, at least not in the strings of exclamations and colourful expletives John so favoured. Kissing his way up the Omega's neck, the Alpha only purred louder, the sound vibrating richly through his chest to fill the room.
He gave a deep, growling purr as he watched his mate eagerly eat the cake out of his hand. Crumbs of the lemon and poppyseed confection were soon the only evidence left as the Alpha reached for another piece, and then another, bringing each to his mate's lips as John rocked slowly against him. Between slices he began to lick the mess from the Omega's lips and chin, cleaning away the smears of frosting and cake before kissing John in earnest, tasting the sweetness in his mouth.
knowing how I feel? You could still take me right here... force that huge cock into me, force me to take your massive knot," he panted, licking his lips. "You need me... you said so... nothing else is
"Alright. Hmm... I love you, babydaddy," he hummed, smoothing his cheek across Sherlock's chest, comforted by his arms and his knot. He closed his eyes and rested, not allowing himself to fall asleep until the knot deflated, wanting to enjoy every second of it this time.
. The Alpha didn't want control, didn't want John's submission; he wanted to make love to John, with John. Their push and pull had been equal before, and it had coaxed him into desiring to penetrate the Omega, but the hint of John slipping into instinct made him hesitate. He held back, slowing the movement of his hips, changing mental directions to focus on only the kiss and the way John felt as he moved beneath his hands.
John calmed himself with Sherlock's scent, picking up traces of his own Omega scent due to the bond. He relaxed his grip on Sherlock's coat, nuzzling his neck as his sobbing quieted, soothed by his Alpha's presence and their mixed scents. "I think it's time we called your brother," he rasped wetly, tears still clinging to his eyelashes. "Tell him we definitely want it. Right now... Right now I want to go and choose some things to make the nest with," he breathed, winding his arms around Sherlock's waist and resting his head on his shoulder. "Now, I'm going to warn you, when Watsons nest, we choose familiar patterns and fabrics. There's going to be a lot of wool and tartan. Earthy colours. Khaki. It will be very working-class and clash horribly with the rest of the lovely classy decor. But it's only temporary," he chuckled, a little giddy at the prospect of shopping for nesting materials with his bondmate.
John's straining breasts were enough to make the Alpha half-hard; he took a deep breath as he ran the cloth over the gigantic globes, which were in truth a little more oblong than globe-shaped, the amount of milk it took to feed thirteen babies causing them to grow far beyond the size of the average nursing Omega. They leaked heavily, and he tutted over the mess they were making of his clean mate, leaning in to take a few small pulls to slow the steady streams of thick, creamy milk that had begun to leak from the Omega's swollen nipples. The pert buds stood out obscenely from the dusky, plump areolas, begging to be suckled from, evidence the Omega was in desperate need of relief. When he'd taken several tiny swallows from each, he finished John's chest, moving the cloth up his clavicle and then down one arm, washing the skin intently and with absolute love, taking John's hand in his to clean each precious finger, doing the same for the other arm when he'd finished. Then to John's neck, paying special attention to the dark skin of the bond mark; up along the Omega's jaw; making circles over each cheek; tending carefully to each feature. When he was finished, he rinsed the cloth to run it softly over his mate's thin lips, draping it over his thumb and swiping it slowly along first the pink of John's upper lip, then the lower, kissing his love's soft mouth before reaching for the shampoo. Towering over his mate, the Alpha had a much easier time working the lather through his partner's sandy locks, massaging John's scalp as he washed the hair atop it.
," he yelled, just to annoy him. Sherlock didn't have to know that while he might be able to say that, he absolutely could not do it now that Sherlock had forbidden it. He was beginning to feel a little unhinged with the need to be filled and fucked and claimed, felt his head tilting invitingly when he caught a strong blast of Sherlock's scent. He let out another needy, wanting whine, unsatisfied and hating it, wanting
so possessively is... wonderful," he whispered, tilting his head back to allow his Alpha to claim his bruised lips again. "Speaking of which... We should start booking things for our wedding... We've got the date and venue, you could start getting your suit made, we can book everything but my suit," he smiled happily, rubbing his hips against Sherlock with a little more enthusiasm. "Tomorrow. Right now we should eat, before the food gets cold..." he said, pretending to be regretful, wanting Sherlock to claim his rights and then use the microwave for something other than eyeballs.
pleased with you, my Omega, my pet." He stroked John's hair and crooned to him, swiping a finger through the semen on his collar and holding it to John's mouth for the Omega to taste.
The Omega whimpered softly as his Alpha moved away, purring happily when he returned; he lifted his arms and legs agreeably as Sherlock dressed him, cooing in delight at the Alpha's murmurs of praise when he was fully clothed. His desire to be close to his mate rather hindered Sherlock's attempts to get dressed, but soon they were both clean and presentable, and John blinked up at Sherlock vacantly, waiting for his next order with a sweet little innocent smile on his face, as if Sherlock was the best thing on the planet.
of activity anyway... We could get some bumblebee wallpaper for one wall, a big bee rug... Bee mobiles to hang over the cots," he mumbled, blushing a little that he was being so Omega and domestic. "Oh... The pups are still moving," he hummed softly. "I wish you could feel them, but I doubt you'll be able to for another couple of weeks... God, and we should try to get them registered for a school. Thirteen of them in the same year group... We might need Mycroft's help with that, to get them all in the same school. And... Sherlock... We should think about a way to allow you to work from the nest. I'll need to stay in it for a month, minimum, because I'll be too full of your litter to move. I might need you with me all the time and with nothing to do, you'll go insane... We need to make sure we have a laptop in there or something, maybe get Lestrade to bring crime scene photos," he finished quietly, biting his lip.
, force your huge cock into me, make me take it," he panted, the words like honey to any Alpha, showing the submission of the Omega, praising, asking to be claimed.
Sherlock leaned down and captured John's lips with his own, drawing the Omega into a deep, sensual kiss. He moaned at the welcoming warmth of John's mouth and the needy slide of their tongues against one another. The mark on his neck smarted just a little but he loved it, making no move to reprimand John for it. Encouraged by John so lovingly, sensually wrapped around him, he moved his hips faster, harder. He needed to mark John soon, to please both his mate and himself, to cement their reconciliation. His orgasm coiled low in his belly, pulsing and building in slow waves until it overwhelmed him and he shuddered, coming with a long, low groan, spurting long ropes of seed over his mate's swollen chest and belly.
He let his head roll back as he massaged his breasts, cupping and squeezing them, brushing his fingertips over his plump nipples and pinching them lightly, making his milk start to drip and splash onto his bump. Every thrust made him jerk back against the headboard, utterly pliant, taking everything the Alpha wanted to give him as he kept touching himself, moaning and gasping from pleasure as he caressed his full breasts, displaying himself proudly,
"I agree," Sherlock said, gently canting his hips to rub himself against the Omega at the mention of his virility. "It is perfect," he continued, quietly understanding and sharing the sentiment behind the selection. "Truthfully, I do not know of anyone else whose name I would give to one of our boys. Artemus, Amadeus, Bennet, and Linus appeal to me on meaningful and aesthetic levels, however."
… size of our first litter speaks for the strength of our bond. I could easily have sired a comparable one on him again, if his Change weren't so near. As such, I want to draw -
The Omega purred in his sleep as he felt his pup latch on, instinctively cuddling him close. His heat hormones dropped as he nursed, and he held the pup against his breast tenderly, crooning to him, letting him imprint further on his scent and voice. His scent markers changed to include more reassuring notes, promising warmth and safety to the tiny boy. Alistair suckled happily, secure in his mother's arms, feeding greedily on the creamy milk John provided. As he finished nursing, John let Sherlock put him back in his cot, flopping onto his back in his exhaustion. The gap between Alistair's birth and Benedict's meant that the younger pup was still dozing happily, not yet in need of his next meal, and John's heat hormones began to rise again, helped along by the fact that John's thighs were now covered in his mate's cum; he'd landed in the puddle of it that had spilled from the broken condom. He spread his legs instinctively, his thighs dirty with amniotic fluid and sweat and his mate's seed, and began mewling for his Alpha's cock again, his scent blooming as the contact with his mate's seed induced him to drop an egg. He thrust his needy hole up at his mate, ready to be filled again, moaning in frustration at the aching emptiness he felt inside him.
"Kn - knot," John breathed needily, shuffling down the bed as best he could and turning onto his side, his back to his Alpha. "Knot, please, need it, need you, please knot me," he mewled, turning his head to kiss and lick at Sherlock's jaw, needing the security and reassurance just as he had the last time. He purred in approval as his mate yanked the broken tracksuit bottoms down and kicked his legs to help get them off, the scent of his slick suddenly thick in the air. He was already wet and open, ready to be knotted. "Please... need it... please, Alpha, please knot me..." He suckled at Sherlock's scent gland, whimpering.
John whined in apology, moaning as his Alpha fingered him; he was so slick and open it was doing little more than tease him. "Ngh - you wanted - ah - hear me... spoke for you - can't... don't want to... demand... I -
Sherlock hummed agreeably, closing his eyes and losing himself to the kiss as he caressed his Omega's plump form.
"So did we," Sherlock answered with a smile, inwardly a bit surprised by the ease and truth of the statement. He placed a soft kiss on Enora's head as he rubbed slow, soothing circles over her back. "I'm glad you came - both of you." He stood to help show them out, keeping the pup tucked lovingly close, minding her every movement as if he'd been made just to be her father. "Please, do let us know when you're free again. We'll set another date - and perhaps someday a play date, after these next pups are born," he said, smiling at them both.
Sherlock fucked John harder, faster, groaning as the Omega orgasmed and contracted around him. He kept up his rhythm, his hand not leaving John's oversensitive cock, hoping to wring a second orgasm from his mate even as he was hurtling closer and closer to his own. "They'll all know you're mine, they'll want you, but they can never have you- Only mine- Always-" he nipped at John's neck, nudging the Omega's head back so he could kiss him fiercely again, John's feet no longer on the floor. He wanted the Omega to come again this way, while he was kissing him, and wouldn't let his mate turn his head or hide his face. "Mine," he growled into John's mouth.
Sherlock began to relax some as he felt his mate's love wash over him, still keeping up his mental calibrations - angling his hips up to penetrate deeper, touching John's breasts, sensually teasing the dusky, pert nipples, pressing kisses with a hint of teeth to the Omega's jaw. He sent back understanding, his own discomfort, hurt, and hesitance buried.
perfect," he murmured gently, tilting his face up, seeking more kisses on the lips. He purred when he got them. "And later, I am going to show you exactly how much I appreciate my genius of a husband." He kissed him again, warmly, smiling a little, fighting the urge to snuggle into his neck again and go back to sleep. He drew back and swiped a thumb across Sherlock's cheekbone affectionately. "Time for the rounds, I think," he murmured regretfully. "Although I'd much sooner stay in your lap." He struggled back into his wheelchair with Sherlock's help and allowed his mate to push him to the nearest guest table while the waiters brought out more champagne flutes and a string quartet began to play.
"Oh, love, come here," John cooed softly, drawing Sherlock into an embrace, holding him against his chest. "It'll be alright. I'm still in there when I'm in my Omega. I know I adore you, I know you'd do anything for me. Your presence makes me feel safe. I'll come back to you, I'll always come back to you. We'll have a few hours together before the birth. We've still got some time now. Please don't be sad - this will stop me going mad from being trapped on the bed by this enormous belly you've given me. It's not too late to get a skype link set up so you can still consult on cases, stop you going crazy too, I know - I know you'll get bored and I don't want that," he choked out, eyes filling with tears. Sherlock didn't want this, didn't want John stuck in his Omega while he was trapped there looking after him. He hated that his mate was upset because of him, would be bored and frustrated having to do every little thing for him while he grew fat and needy.
Adam (burgundy) is like a mini-Sherlock, pale skin and dark curls. He has a face shape similar to Sherlock's, but he's got John's eyes.
The Omega's eyes widened and his breathing hitched as he gave a keening little whine. "Oh, please... now, please, fuck me first," he whimpered needily, wriggling forward to cross his legs and haul himself to his knees, turning round slowly to present to his Alpha. He pressed back towards Sherlock, kneeling forward just a little, the water supporting his bulk making it a little easier to move. "Please," he breathed, legs spread wide, the oval shape of the tub providing plenty of space. "Please, I need it... Need your big cock in me... take what's yours... claim me again..." He knew he sounded needy and desperate, but couldn't help himself; it was already starting, his more constant need for his Alpha as his pregnancy progressed. They'd been having sex more frequently in the last few weeks but there was something different today, something in John that couldn't be satisfied, and he wanted Sherlock to fuck him again and again until it hurt, even though he couldn't explain to himself why.
Before the conversation could go any further Catherine emerged, holding a flailing and obviously displeased Enora. "She wants you," the Omega murmured apologetically, handing the baby to Sherlock. The pup calmed immediately and reached out for her father, trying to burrow into his neck. John could sense that the rest of the pups were growing fussy as well, but before he made his excuses to go to the nest Victor spoke up.
Sherlock grinned and rolled his eyes. "Please, John. As if I could possibly turn down the opportunity." He began to rub large circles over the Omega's oblong middle, keeping his touch feather-light at first, then adding just a slight, soothing pressure. "If it's any comfort, you were fantastic," the Alpha murmured, nipping gently at his mate's ear. "I'm sorry, however. I did not mean to hurt you." John had seemed fine, had shown no signs of anything worse than a belly ache in his blissed-out, post-orgasmic haze. In fact, the Alpha had been proud of what he'd done to his mate. But ever since the Christmas incident, there was always a niggling worry in the back of Sherlock's mind, an anxiety that he would forget himself and harm his Omega in his eagerness. He sighed softly as he remembered when they had first been looking for houses, how he had denied his mate relief and John had chastised him for the pain it caused.
John vaguely registered the newcomer's voice, thinking it was familiar. He stayed on the bed, wriggling happily to get comfortable on top of the duvet, legs spread to accommodate his rounded belly, his breasts sitting pertly above the swell, his cheeks still a little flushed, nipples rosy and plump from Sherlock's suckling, eyelashes lowered demurely as he smoothed his hands over his bump, crooning contentedly to the babies, too quietly for anyone else to make out words but enough that they'd get the gist. The obvious semen stains on his skin and his purpling bruises from the earlier rough claiming completed the picture: he was very blatantly a blissfully pregnant Omega, recently claimed by a strong Alpha whose claim wrapped around him like barbed wire. He looked up as he heard the door open and saw his Alpha, purring loudly at his return, realising there was another Alpha behind him who was not a threat. He eyed him up suspiciously, still purring and rubbing his bump defiantly. As he had been in Lestrade's office he was too Omega to register anyone's speech but his own Alpha's, knowing that Mycroft (he recognised him now) was speaking. He looked to Sherlock, who did not seem threatened, so ignored him and rubbed his bump again, feeling the vague outline of some of the pups.
When he had drained the servant’s breasts just enough to alleviate his discomfort John leaned up and kissed him with milk-wet lips, allowing the other man to taste his own milk. John's cock was standing at attention and throbbing needily, and when he sneakily dropped his hand to the lowest curve of the servant's belly he felt the other man's erection pressing against the back of his hand. He began to stroke it firmly while the other man lowered his head and suckled hungrily from his breasts, lightly teasing the servant's shaft in time with the rhythm of his mouth. The servant gasped and reached out to return the favour, struggling to reach John’s cock with their bellies pressed tightly together as they indulged in their pleasure.
Sherlock dazedly nuzzled John's lips away from his jaw so he could return the affections, some part of him determined that John would not submit to him as if what had just passed between them was completely the Alpha's doing. He was beginning to feel himself again, slowly, recognizing his fingertips at John's shoulder and the curve of the Omega's waist, feeling the heat of the shower spray as it pattered firmly against his back. He pressed softer, shorter kisses to John's cheeks, nose, eyelids, forehead - and finally lips again, stealing a few more tender seconds as their mouths brushed against one another's. He grinned against his wife's skin, not yet capable of speech again himself, luxuriating in the warmth and wetness, in John and the softness of John's body and the gentle pulses of love washing between them.
, Sherlock said quickly. The Alpha had all but tumbled forward at his mate's feet when John opened the door,
John smirked. "I think they know exactly where we are," he smiled coyly, "and I think they'll be glad of the bonding time with the pups. Right now, though, I think I should be a good Omega and take care of that lovely hard cock..." He palmed Sherlock's cock, humming in approval when it twitched against his hand. "It's been a while since I've let you rub your come into my skin," John murmured conversationally, "and even longer since I've let you come all over my tits... Would you like that, my Alpha? You want me to toss you off and let you come all over my big, ripe belly and my huge milky tits, let you rub it in afterwards?" As he spoke he ran his hand up and down the length of Sherlock's cock, feeling the outline of it through the Alpha's trousers. "Fuck, you're so big... Sometimes when I haven't touched you like this for a while I forget... And you're going to get bigger, aren't you? Tell me," he demanded, unzipping Sherlock's fly and pulling out his cock before wrapping his hand around it and pumping gently.
Out in the sitting room, Mycroft Holmes breathed a sigh of relief, as did the entire pack. The Alphas and Omegas, as well as Mrs Hudson, had spent the entirety of the birth in Sherlock and John's home; instinct dictated that they be nearby to protect the expectant couple from threat or poachers. They'd spent the long day and night together, the faint sounds of John's moans and cries of newborn pups drifting down the corridor. While their bonds were not nearly as strong as the one between Sherlock and John, they all shared a swell of joyful warmth in their chests when each healthy pup was born. Beatrice had not been convinced to stay with the others; she'd taken a blanket, a pillow, and a spot by the door of the nest, keeping vigil until the birth had concluded. She'd returned to the pack when the microheat began, satisfied. They'd all heard the shouting that followed hours later, and had fallen into a shared grief when Mycroft revealed the reason. Now, however, they all rose together, taking each other's hands and heading towards the nest, eager to greet the again-expectant mother and the newest additions to their pack.
he said carefully after a moment. His fingers slowly uncurled, and he looked up without quite meeting John's eyes. The Alpha shifted to his feet almost automatically, his body responding to his partner's need. Taking John's elbow, he helped the heavy Omega to standing and lead him over to their fussing children.
... A nice hotel? The Dorchester or The Landau or somewhere like that. Marble and a ballroom but still urban. And we wouldn't have to travel for the reception," he thought out loud. "And I don't know about you but I can't stand fruit cake. I'd rather have Madeira cake," he grinned into Sherlock's neck. "And I know... I killed for you almost as soon as I met you because I knew somehow, my life would revolve around you. You'll do such a good job protecting me and our babies," he breathed, putting his hand on top of Sherlock's and helping him stroke his bump.
John took a deep, steadying breath. "Thirteen." It rang heavily in the silence of the room, John praying that this Anderson would have more sense than his relation. Before the doctor could say anything John spoke again. "What relation are you to
Sherlock groaned softly as John contracted around him again and again, feeling his cock pulse as every last drop of his seed was wrung from him. He nuzzled John's temple, pressing gentle kisses along the side of his face. "I love you, too," he murmured, exhaling slowly in the realization that they hadn't even properly kissed yet. He nudged at the Omega's face, bringing a hand up to cup John's jaw and turn the man's head gently so he could see his eyes. "I love you," he repeated so John could look at him as he said it, and dipped down to capture his partner's lips in a tender kiss.
Sherlock purred as he worked perfumed shampoo through his Omega's damp locks. The water they reclined in was tinted a blushing pink, the label on the sleek bottle Sherlock had chosen from one of the shelves proclaiming the bath oil a potent aphrodisiac for heavily pregnant Omegas.
he growled. In the back of his mind, he knew he had to be careful; fulfil too many of John's requests and the Omega would never fully drop into subspace. When John's collar was on in this setting, absolute dominance was key.
. The bed had begun to creak lightly with their motions. Sherlock's gaze travelled between the Omega he straddled and the mirror, which offered him a full view of a powerful Alpha primally forcing his overlarge cock down his partner's throat. Sherlock's pupils dilated wide. At the image of his own dominance, he felt more of his Alpha side emerging, wanting to take full pleasure from the Omega he'd collared.
when I birth the litter after that... and the one after that... Tell me, my Alpha, how many more pups do you think I can give you?" He leaned in to lick and nuzzle at Sherlock's throat, whining happily as he scented his incredibly virile bondmate.
"Yes, Alpha," John murmured demurely, lowering his eyelids and sending as much love as he could through the bond. He hadn't meant to make his Alpha feel guilty; it was just as much his fault, since he hadn't researched collaring or subspace beforehand and should have known that Sherlock would not have understood why everything was not perfect between them. He pushed the feeling strongly towards his mate, soothing and forgiving him for his part and meekly begging to be forgiven for his own. Imogen and Miles cooed happily as they nursed, their mother's love washing over them as well, and soon all of the pups were humming and squeaking in contentment.
John sent a wave of strong, pure love through the bond, gasping as his mate's touches milked him, squeezing Sherlock's arse to encourage his movements, stroking his curls with the other.
Sherlock grinned smugly in return. "They all underestimate us," he mused, approvingly beginning to rub slow circles over the heavy mass of John's belly as the Omega enjoyed his treat. He started on his own food at a look from his mate, knowing John wouldn't let them leave until the Alpha had finished his portion as well. He ate slowly, his appetite still upset from the incident, his cheeks flushing in deep embarrassment as he replayed the situation in his mind. How had he been so rash? He hadn't expected a single question, a single look to affect him so heavily; he could still feel the ache at the thought of John having had another serious Alpha in his past, even though he knew it wasn't as he'd thought it to be. The detective growled low in his throat at the thought of anyone attempting to touch his Omega like the Colonel had. With a start, he realized he was still holding his half-eaten sandwich in his hands, as his mate watched him keenly.
not to. He'll never love you like he loves me - he never did. You're only making it worse for yourself you know, if he finds you here - he will kill you. If he finds out you threatened the pups, he'll kill you
"Good evening, Sir. May I take your name?" the doorman asked Sherlock, inclining his head in respect.
"Nothing," Sherlock murmured slowly, black dread curling around his heart. He knew Mycroft would never completely have been able to keep
"We'll need leashes if we're to keep track of them all," Sherlock groaned, "We only have so many bodies to chase them with. Baby gates  - we're going to need lots and lots of baby gates, though that won't stop them from crawling under and over and into everything they can manage." He huffed good-naturedly as Lucy gave a particularly hard tug on his hair, while Blake's developing motor skills failed him, the little Omega's hand missing his father's curls and smacking the Alpha soundly in the eye. "John, our children are ganging up on me," Sherlock complained with a smile.
Sherlock blinked as it clicked. He turned his head, looking a bit comical as he stared at his mate, his face slightly obscured by John's breasts. "Of course," he breathed, "Oh, that's brilliant..." A smile spread across his face and he sat up, upsetting John's laptop and quickly throwing out a hand to prevent it from crashing to the floor. The Alpha set the device gently on the table and kissed his mate. "She won't be able to say no. She loves us, and she'll love our pups. She's always wanted to be a grandmother - it will be perfect. We could call her 'Nana Hudson'..." He beamed happily, his eyes shining. The Alpha nearly jumped up to rush downstairs and ask, but caught himself; it was his Omega's final choice as to who to ask, and when to ask them. He sat back down as soon as he'd lifted a few inches off the cushion. "Would you like to ask her soon?" he said sheepishly.
John mewled and arched his back, letting his Alpha claim his body. "I had no idea your instincts were that strong," he gasped. "Even the faint smell of having briefly brushed past another Alpha would have made you go mad?" The thought of Sherlock being so utterly possessive made him very wet very fast and he wriggled down onto Sherlock's fingers, rubbing his hands and belly against Sherlock's cock. "Please..." he whined softly, needing to be claimed to soothe the Omega who had displeased his Alpha.
The Alpha certainly looked as lost as a kitten at the question. "Present?" he asked stupidly. The last twenty-four hours had been such a roller coaster that he'd utterly dismissed or forgotten any thought that John might have an anniversary present for him in return, or at least one that the Omega would still be willing to give. "I don't understand."
The colour drained from Sherlock's face as he looked at his Omega. A corner of his mouth twitched downward dangerously. "Have I really embarrassed you that much, John?" he asked, his tone even and quiet but laced with an edge of frost. The Alpha abruptly pushed his chair back and stood, not waiting for a response as he left the sweetheart table. He obediently strode over towards his mother. Beatrice Holmes immediately dropped her gaze from her son, unwilling to look the Alpha in the eye as he bent down next to her. Mycroft eyed his brother with concern, but said nothing of it.
He could feel a burst of eagerness from his mate, spurring him onward. He increased his pace to harder than before, so close to the edge, his half-swollen knot now filling John's mouth more and more with each passing moment. He swore, the bed creaking furiously with their motions. The sight of the Onega underneath him, hands sensually caressing the full globe of his belly, breasts leaking and bouncing, mouth dripping and stretched wide around his cock, had him coming within minutes. With a roaring cry, he thrust deep and felt his knot inflate, growing rapidly, filling all the available space in the Omega's ready mouth.
With a low, growling purr, the Alpha crawled forward to straddle his mate's swollen middle, using one hand for support against the mattress as he lowered himself down to rut against the Omega's belly. He panted softly, feeling precome beginning to slick his way, making his thrusts slide easily against the Omega's skin. The fluid soon began to run in heavy, clear drops down the curve of John's rounded abdomen - after the distress of their talk, the Alpha's body was over-compensating as he worked to re-claim his mate, his primal biology wanting to mark John as strongly as possible. He grunted with each undulation of his hips, his enormous member squeezed deliciously in the pressure between his flat belly and John's gravid one.
John purred agreeably, continuing to pet the Alpha like he wanted, with just a little extra pressure where it was most appreciated. "There now, that's better, isn't it, my sweet one?" he crooned softly, "Yes, Mama's milk tastes nice, doesn't it... you have as much as you want my darling, that's right... mmm, good boy, suckling so well... ohhh, yes, you have a good feed love, there will always be more if you want it..." He pressed gentle, adoring kisses into Sherlock's hair as the Alpha suckled, purring quietly and continuing his litany of encouragement and endearment. Usually when Sherlock suckled him it was lazier, because he couldn't be bothered to go and get food, or more intense while they were in a haze of lust, but this felt more like Sherlock wanted the security and nurturing of nursing from him, and John was more than happy to provide it. His scent changed to push out more maternal markers, as it had at their wedding, and John sighed happily, pushing love through the bond.
He grinned as he watched John's pupils dilate rapidly, the Omega blushing red as his breaths turned to rough panting.
"This weekend," Sherlock murmured, his tongue laving over John's scent gland as he kissed the spot softly. Guilt still curled heavily in him over what had transpired; he had protected his Omega and their pups, but he felt that somehow he should have deduced Anderson's reaction and avoided him altogether, or known to stand in front of his mate instead of leaving John so open and vulnerable on his lap. "I know how much you want to begin with the nursery. Baker Street won't be sufficient for nesting if you know you won't give birth here and the pups won't live here permanently. Perhaps I can call and ask if we can move the date forward and see a few things tomorrow."
Sherlock continued to shower his mate with affections, his every motion showing his love and asserting his status. They passed many long minutes that way, purely Alpha and Omega, dominant and submissive, in utter bliss and satisfaction.
of the milk his mate was producing. He'd have to stuff himself to finish both breasts. He inhaled deeply, gently taking his mate's wandering fingers in his own when the waitress returned with Sherlock's card.
He smiled as their eyes met, gingerly handing him the now-sated Blake, and carefully shifted to kneel, gripping the headboard for balance. He panted and rubbed his belly as the next pup engaged, looking to his mate;
Moriarty whimpered at Sherlock's words, spreading his thighs invitingly, his body pale and slender and long-limbed, so like Sherlock, so unlike John with his tan and downy gold hair and muscular build. "I can be good for you..." he murmured, losing himself to his Omega as his heat progressed. "I'll be a good Omega. Take your cock and your pups like I was meant to... Ohh, I need it, fill me, please, so
John hummed happily into the kiss, the warm contented feeling of being knotted and full of come making him more relaxed. He rubbed his belly fondly. "You've definitely put your babies in me now, I can feel it," he murmured, his Omega biology telling him he'd conceived. "Oh, Christ... be careful what you wish for!" he gasped, his body telling him exactly what was happening.
The baby blinked up at her father, her tiny fingers grasping randomly as she sought her mother's scent. John purred softly, nuzzling their newest pup. "Hello, Miranda Rose," he murmured, "hello beautiful girl. You've got your daddy's eyes, you lucky thing, haven't you? Ohhhhhh... and it won't be long before your brothers join us." He arched his back as the next pup began moving into position, feeling its head engage. "Better feed you quickly, hey?" John knelt upright on the bed, gently taking the baby from his mate. His breasts had begun to leak already and he was glad of the relief, purring contentedly as the new arrival latched and began to suckle hungrily. Sherlock's scent surrounded him and the baby, making both of them feel secure; John leaned back against his mate, smiling down at the tiny girl, his hole still loose and ready for birthing, the remaining two pups still wiggling and kicking for space in his belly.
... So heavy with your pups already... I've gained nearly half a stone in weight... Going to look full term with one baby in just a few weeks... Have to constantly fight the urge to rub my bump in public... Ahhhhh, fuck... Love you, Sherlock, love how you take care of me, put your scent on me... Ohh god!" he cried desperately, so close to coming, but wanting his Alpha's pleasure first - this was an apology, after all.
Catherine purred responsively, cupping her son's cheek. "What's that, my dear? Would my darling like a nurse too?" Her fingers didn't hesitate for a moment as she moved to work open the buttons of her blouse. Her full breasts had long gone dry, she knew -and Remington knew, too - but just as a child received comfort by suckling on a pacifier, she knew her son would be soothed by the motions of nursing. She pushed out all the motherly, inviting scent markers she could manage that would signal
"No, love, it's alright, we'll be calmer with them here," John purred softly, cooing gently as Alistair and Imogen began to mewl for milk. He easily pushed his pyjama top out of the way and held them close as they latched on and began to feed lazily, gazing at his mate with a soft smile.
Sherlock's eyes lit up immediately at the puzzle, scanning the photograph, his mind jumping into action to deduce the details. "A case?" he asked curiously, "No... no, not quite - there's been nothing reported in this location as of late. But ... it's a clue, yes?" He looked to his mate to explain what was meant by gifting the mysterious picture.

Quints and twins alike were entranced as Sherlock explained how he'd deduced the identity of a brutal axe murderer by his preferred brand of trousers, and chased him through crowds of tourists at Covent Garden.
