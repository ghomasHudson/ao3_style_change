Will laughs and pulls Castiel around so that they’re facing each other. Moving to the music comes naturally, so Castiel winds one arm around Will’s neck and lets himself get lost in the sound and the feel of Will’s hands on his hips. They move together, not grinding, but just shifting to the pulsing beat. There is nothing inherently sexual about the way they’re dancing, but Castiel feels his body respond anyway. The twist of arousal isn’t completely unexpected, but Castiel is relieved to feel it anyway. Although he had found Jacob physically attractive, he wasn’t aroused by him, even when the other man had kissed him. If just Will’s hands on his hips and a pounding rhythm have this effect on him, it is a very good sign.
Donnie leans back against the booth and points his bottle at Dean with a smirk. “When have you ever let that stop you?”
Ellen puts her arms around him, pulling him in for a quick hug. Dean’s become more comfortable with the affection over the years, but he still finds it unsettling sometimes. “Good. If you ever want us to take Ben, you only have to ask.”
Dean’s eyes flick to the rearview mirror, but Ben has his headphones on, happily listening to the astronomy audio books Cas gave him for Christmas. Cas must have helped him set it up while Dean was sulking. Just another thing Cas thought of.
As both men rise, Cas takes the mask and costume from Dean, giving him a sympathetic look. “We are going to my classroom. There are fewer children, so there will be less activity. It might be easier for Ben there.”
After a few moments, he rolls over and opens his eyes again. He stares up at the ceiling and tries to make out the swirling pattern of the plaster, but it’s hidden in the shadows. The notes—he’s sure they have names, but he doesn’t know them—waft through his head over and over. Dean can't shake the feeling it’s a snippet of a longer melody, but it’s not one he knows.
“Aww, I’m proud of you, Clarence,” she says with a wicked grin. “I’ll just give you some space. If it takes longer than five minutes for him to come over here, we’ll go home.” She glances over to where Balthazar is grinding against the pretty blond woman. “Either way, I think we’ve lost Zar.”
“If we hadn’t met, she would have won gold; she was that good,” John says, grimacing as if it’s an effort to force out each word. “Instead of wasting her talent as a teacher, she would have been living her dream. There would have been no reason for her to be on that road that night, and she’d still be alive.”
There are no lights on in the classroom when Cas arrives, but that’s not unusual. He’s usually the first one there. He turns on the computers and is raising the blinds when Meg and Becky arrive.
“Nah, leaving the door open in case there are any eligible bachelorettes here today,” she returns with a grin that almost immediately clouds. “Honestly, though, everything with Dorothy really wore me out. Not sure I’m ready to jump back on the horse just yet.”
“Perfect.” Dr. Harris uses a small light to check Dean’s pupil response. Dean jerks when the doctor claps right next to his head, and he hits his elbow on the desk. “Sorry about that,” the doctor says with a chuckle as Dean rubs his arm. He uses the small hammer to tap below Dean’s knees until his legs jump. “Everything looks good. You appear to be healing well.”
After Michael, even once he’d settled into some semblance of semi-permanence with Raphael, Castiel couldn’t bring himself to think about the prospect of children. He threw himself into his Special Education degree and told himself that his students would be enough to take the place of the children he and Michael had dreamed of. It was easy, after all, when he moved to Lawrence because Malachi was certainly not interested in ever sharing Castiel’s attention.
Castiel reaches out as if to stop him, then pulls back before actually touching his arm. “No, I mean, it’s not that I wouldn’t be interested, I mean, normally,” he stutters, still unable to find words to convey his meaning.
Cas clears his throat loudly and sets the boxes down with less grace than he’s capable of to give them a chance to regroup. “This is all the packing peanuts I collected, but I think Charlie is bringing two more garbage bags. You have the toys, right?”
Ben considers that, his face scrunching up. After a few moments, he turns to pin Cas with a measuring look. “Friends like daddy and Ash?” he asks shrewdly.
“S’mores are a Winchester-Singer-Harvelle family tradition,” Dean announces when Cas turns down his offer of one of the sugary treats. Jo snatches it out of his hand before he can push it at Cas again. She takes a big bite, hissing as it burns her mouth.
Ben relents and they find some paper towels in the garage to clean up his blotchy face before going back out to the yard. Dean prompts Ben through the apology. Annie, never one to hold a grudge, throws her arms around Ben. She hugs him tight, earning an eye roll and a grimace from Ben but no comments. Thankfully, Benny and Sam shut down the grill while he and Ben were in the garage. Instead, Jess leads the kids in a game of freeze tag while they wait for it to get dark enough to start the fireworks.
“Of course, it was,” Gram says, ruffling his hair, so her fingers brush the bandage. “We’ll let you rest. I just wanted to see for myself that you’re okay.”
There’s a parking lot ahead, a paved space in front of a little white church. Too caught up in his pain to even see the irony, Cas pulls over and shoves the car into park. He drops his head to the steering wheel as sobs rip through him. What a fool he’s been to think that someone like Dean could possible want him. He saw the draw between Dean and Ash time and time again, but he wanted to ignore it and believe Dean. Decades together and Cas really thought he could come between them. How stupid could he be? He should have known he would be the one to get hurt.
While the parents bundle up their children, Castiel makes his way over to where Dean is helping Ben with his coat. As if sensing Castiel’s presence, Dean looks up, finally making eye contact for the first time. His eyes widen fractionally. “Oh, ah, hey, Cas,” he murmurs.
Dean sighs, the sound heavy and weary even across the phone. “No, uh, I’m actually on my way to the hospital—”
Castiel stiffens. “Of course not. He is the parent of one of my students,” Castiel insists, getting up to rinse his empty mug. He turns it over on paper towels beside the sink, using the movements to keep him from looking at Charlie.
Castiel is, of course, right as usual. Not only does Patty introduce him to Hank Nettles, the photographer in question, but a murmured word to a passing waiter nets them two bottles of IPA from Patty’s brother’s microbrewery.
Meg appears at his side. “Ben, why don’t you go help Justin with his computer game until it’s time to go back to class,” she says brightly. She turns to Cas as soon as Ben bounces across the classroom and narrows her eyes. “You need to pull yourself together,” she snaps, then sighs wearily. “Cas, why are you doing this to yourself?”
Dean watches Cas approach one of the mothers. She nods, glancing over to Ben and Dean with a friendly smile. Cas goes to the shelves at the back of the room and returns with a pair of socks. “Ben, Justin is going to let you borrow his socks so that your ankles aren't itchy. Let's get your suit on and you can go say thank you.”
The rest of the evening passes in a blur of ghouls and cartoon characters, but Castiel is distracted from the joy he usually finds in the holiday by replaying the encounter with the Winchesters over and over. The last of the candy is passed out just before nine and Castiel moves the chair back into the garage before returning to the house and turning off the porch light.
Dean stops at a café on the corner and buys a coffee, caffeine be damned. There are little round tables set up on the sidewalk out front, and Dean sits with his coffee to think. He closes his eyes and imagines himself on the street across from the music store. There’s a name in faded blue letters on the window above the drum set, but he can’t remember what it was.
, Dean repeats silently. Not five anymore. The five is now four, and Dean is the only one who hasn’t settled down. Benny and Andrea, Sam and Jess, and even Garth and his girlfriend Bess have recently started talking about tying the knot. And then there’s Dean, still carrying a torch for the only one of them that got out and is never coming back. Pathetic.
Something in Cas’ eyes softens at the mention of Ben. “I haven’t, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t here. Did he say where he left him?”
Ellen pulls the straw from her soda and chews on the end as she considers her next words. “It’s hard when you’re bringing them up by yourself. You start to focus so much on the small details that you miss the big picture.” She places a hand on Dean’s arm. “Like taking care of yourself and being a person for yourself, not just your kids.”
. Before long, Dean is stopping for gas in Eudora before continuing to head south to Baldwin City. It’s been months, no, over a year since Dean has had a day to himself to just drive. Every now and then, he glances over at the passenger seat, almost expecting to see Sam or Ash sitting there. The empty seat gives him a little bit of a pause. Sam is happily settled into married life and career, and Ash is living it up in San Francisco. Yet, Dean is still here, in Lawrence, surrounded by family but feeling more alone than he ever has.
Castiel reaches the gate just moments before the numbers next to their flight on the board change to
It would take a stronger man than Cas not to respond to the insistent thrusting of Dean’s tongue or the way Dean’s hands come up to cup Cas’ jaw so that he can manhandle him into the kiss. When Dean rocks his hips forward in a slow, dirty grind, Cas isn’t particularly surprised to feel that they’re both half hard. Still ravaging Cas’ mouth, Dean slides one hand down Cas’ chest, not seeming to notice the shock of arousal that goes through Cas when he ghosts fingertips over one nipple.
The evening passes with laughter, beer, and good conversation. Dean’s almost forgotten what it feels like to laugh like this. Eventually a pizza, nachos, and hot wings appear on the table, and it isn’t long until Jo is challenging the boys to a game of darts. It comes to none of their little group’s surprise that by quarter past one, Jo and Dean are the last two standing.
Dean glances back at him, his posture still rigid, but his face relaxes. Cas smiles slightly and reaches for his hand and he’s glad when Dean takes it. As they walk away from the booth, Cas slips the brochure into his coat pocket. Maybe he’ll bring it up again when they’re alone.
Ash shakes his head and in the light of the half-full moon, Dean sees the glint of moisture on his cheeks. “I’m gonna hang out for a bit. It’s not far. I’ll walk back to mom’s.”
Castiel’s thoughts continue to spiral throughout the rest of the movie. He laughs in the appropriate places and gasps at the explosions, but he’s spurred on by Dean’s reactions rather than a true interest in the movie. By the time the end credits roll, he’s fairly certain he wouldn’t be able to tell how the movie ended if asked.
Black curls bounce around her face when she nods, her eyes tracing over the door to the psychology clinic, and she gives a small hum. “What have you been doing with yourself since you graduated? I never heard from you about publishing your paper on the Wichita Nation.”
“Spoilsport,” Dean mutters, before turning back to Sam. “Nah, man. Just got here. Took some time to shovel Missouri’s walk when I picked Ben up. That high school kid next door used to do it, but I guess he’s too busy with his new girlfriend or whatever. Last thing we need is her slippin’ and fallin’.”
Dean smiles, finally glancing sideways to meet Castiel’s eyes quickly before looking back at the road. “Wouldn’t have offered if I minded, Cas.”
“Dean, I told you it’s okay.  I wasn’t intending that to slip out, but I won’t take it back because it’s true. I’m not expecting anything in return. That’s not how love works.”
With no warning, Dean shoves Cas back against the pillow, shifting so he is laying half on top of Cas. He doesn’t break the kiss; he uses the added leverage to turn the tide, ravaging Cas’ mouth instead. Cas is so caught up in the passion of Dean’s assault, he doesn’t register the way Dean’s hips roll against his thigh at first. After the several thrusts the hard press of Dean’s erection is impossible to ignore.
With everyone taking a few items, it doesn’t take long to carry all of the food to the dining room. Soon the long rectangular table is bursting with steaming dishes. The room is a bustle of activity as everyone shuffles to find a place to sit. Dean passes out bottles of the pale ale to everyone who wants one, skipping Castiel and John. Castiel recalls that Dean said his father is a recovering alcoholic as well. Castiel is happy to find himself between Dean and Sam, but the seating certainly doesn’t limit interaction with the others at the table.
Dean cracks a small smile. “Asked Charlie about me, did you?” He grins at Castiel’s blush but continues. “Sammy was away at Stanford when my dad finally decided to get his shit together, get sober. He started goin’ to meetings, doing things the hard way, ‘cause that’s the only way my dad knows how to do things. He had six months under his belt when Ash came home one night and told me he got a job offer from some big computer company in California. That’s what he always wanted to do, computer programming and stuff. He said he was moving, but I couldn’t leave my dad, you know? He’d just started gettin’ it together and he was still shaky. Anyway, so I stayed and Ash went.”
As much as Cas wants that, aches for it, he can’t let himself be greedy. Dean has a life, a full-time job, and a child to take care of. The last thing he needs is to spend his time taking care of a grown man who can’t drag himself to work or even seem to remember to feed himself. He looks down at the end of the bed, where Juliet is curled amongst the blankets. At least he remembered to feed her last night.
The tiny woman pushes a long black curl behind her ear before leveling a glare at Becky. “Jesus, has this woman ever even worked with kids before?” she asks with a sneer. Most people find Meg to be snide and off-putting, but anyone who has seen her work with children has learned to look past her thorny exterior. Meg is much better with kids than she is with adults.
“Mr. Winchester, and Ben I suppose?” she says warmly, making it both a statement and a question at once. “I’m Pam. I suppose that should be Dr. Barnes, but I can’t seem to get used to it, so you’ll just call me Pam. I hope you were able to find the place okay.”
There’s a short squabble while Castiel tries to talk Ash into driving the van so he can ride with Charlie and Dean. Meg says something low and clipped into Castiel’s ear and the fight drains out of him.
Dean pulls into the driveway and Cas opens the front door before Dean can even put the car in park. Unlike Dean, he looks refreshed like he slept like a baby, with none of his usual morning grumpiness. Dean hates him a little bit.
Dean is bent over his duffle bag, digging through the clothes for something, but Ben is standing beside the bed studying something on the floor with a confused expression. Cas steps forward with the water just as Dean turns back from the bag holding one of his old t-shirts.  Ben turns and bends down. He picks something up, but with his back to Cas, he can’t tell what it is. He hopes it isn’t the condom wrapper.
Cas rolls his eyes and chuckles. He is about to follow Dean into bed when a soft chirping from his phone tells him he has an incoming call. Given that it’s almost midnight, he’s not sure who could be calling this late. He looks down at the screen before answering it, shocked to see Kali’s name on the caller ID.
“He’s Ben’s teacher and we’re friends. That’s it. There’s nothin’ goin’ on,” Dean insists. If he says it enough times, maybe even he’ll believe it.
As soon as Dean is out of the way, Ben steps forward and wraps his small arms around Cas’ waist. Cas lets out a choked off sound and brushes one hand lovingly through Ben’s hair before the boy releases him. “I’m sorry you’re sad, Cas,” he says gently. “I hope daddy’s soup helps you feel better.”
Dean is halfway to the music shop before his heart rate slows and he loosens his grip on the steering wheel. Music blasts from the speakers, pounding along with the discordant notes inside him, and he tries to lose himself in it. The fight repeats in his head and Dean tries to talk himself down. If John could get to Castiel, he would have done it already. Castiel would never take what John has to offer. With Dean broken, there’s no reason for John to bother. None of it is reassuring.
Cas slides one hand along the couch cushion and winds his fingers through Deans. He stares at their clasped hands for a long time before raising his eyes to Dean’s face again. “Dean? What about Ash?” he asks softly, hesitant to speak the question out loud.
Cas nods and lets Dean pull him in for a kiss. They’re standing in the house of a woman who didn’t think Dean was important and Cas kisses him anyway. It feels a little like a betrayal.
“My older brother,” Jo answers, giving Dean a light squeeze before he releases her. “He lives in San Francisco now, which is probably how I’ve managed to stay out of jail.”
The muscle in Dean’s jaw clenches with the effort of holding himself back. What is with the meddling assholes in this family? “Did I miss the part where that is any of your goddamn business?” he snaps.
Donnie cocks one eyebrow. “The part where I told him I would keep fucking you? Or the part where I said I wouldn’t care if you were with him while we did it?”
They must leave from the back of the lot because Dean doesn’t see them go, but they are pulling up in front of the showroom fifteen minutes later. Carl climbs out of the passenger seat and going into the building, but Cas is smiling, so Dean and Ben get out of the car and make their way over to him. “I think I’m going to take this one,” Cas says, gripping Dean’s bicep. “Thank you, Dean. I don’t think I would have done this if it wasn’t for you. This is going to make my life so much easier. Carl is going to run some numbers.”
Seeing Ben every day doesn’t become any less painful, but at least Cas keeps himself in check. There are no more breakdowns in the classroom. Instead, the collapse occurs every day when he gets a single text from Dean. They’re always one line, usually only a few words.
Cas smiles and meets Dean’s eyes in their reflection. “I am too.” He squeezes Dean’s arms, then turns in the circle of the embrace so that they’re facing each other. “I like this,” he breathes, pressing his cheek against Deans. “I like spending time with you both.”
This isn’t the first time Ben has mentioned his dislike for Austin Kemmery. Dean glosses over the digression to focus on getting the story he’ll need for the doctors. “Yeah, I’ve heard that about Austin. Did you ask Miss Morgan to let you take a break?” Ben’s Individualized Education Plan addresses his sensory processing issues, and if he needs to leave the room or get his noise-canceling headphones, they’re supposed to let him.
When the waitress drops off their sodas on the table, Dean picks his up and raises it as a toast. “Dude, here’s to hopin’ the bun in the oven is a boy. You’re overrun by chicks.”
He hasn’t cried. That’s not right, or at least it doesn’t feel right. He should be feeling something other than hollowness. It should hurt, rip his heart out, and make him sob. Instead, there’s just desolation, like he can’t feel anything at all.
Cas pulls out a folded piece of paper and waves it at him, showing that sure enough, the different dealerships and models of cars are highlighted in different colors. “Not a word,” he mutters, and Dean bites the inside of his cheek.
He knows that it’s true, that this is what needed to happen. He knows that being with Dean will be worth this discomfort, but it doesn’t help lessen the empty feeling in his chest any.
Cas’ voice is steady when he answers, but Dean can hear a twinge that tells him everything is not okay. “Let’s just get to the car, Dean. I’ll explain, I promise. I just need, I need to be away from here, okay?” He turns his face into Dean’s shoulder. “Okay?” he mumbles into the fabric.
Dean stifles his grin, but when he turns to Castiel, the other man doesn’t bother to hide his pleasure. “Awesome. How would you like to be volunteer roadies?” he asks, slinging his arm over Dean’s shoulder. “Extra hands to load the gear is always nice.”
Dean takes a deep breath and continues down the hallway to the waiting room though he’s not sure how he manages to look calm at all. “Hey, bug, you wanna go wait in the car instead?” he asks, praying that his voice is steady enough to get past Ben. “You can finish listenin’ to your book. If Mr. Novak likes this car, you might be gettin’ your surprise sooner rather than later.”
Dean is slower letting Charlie up, but he grabs her hand to haul her to her feet. “She started it. We were just defending ourselves,” Dean protests.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas breathes and then they’re kissing. It’s perfect, just this side of messy. The hot press of lips, Cas’ hands scrabbling against his shirt to get a grip to yank him closer, one thigh shoving between his legs until they’re rutting together. Dean breaks the kiss to trail his mouth, open and wet, down Cas’ jaw to his neck. Cas is babbling, a constant string of praise and endearments, “Dean, so good, gods, Dean, I love you, Dean.”
Dean doesn’t respond for a long time, his thoughts a tangle of threads that he can’t seem to weave together into a coherent response. Ash is coming home. Seven years later and Ash is coming home, possibly to stay. “Why?” is all he can think to say.
Charlie stares at him a few moments longer. Finally, she nods, the motion jerky with reluctance. “I have a blog post to write by Friday. I'll finish it, then head to the pool. Call if you need me.”
Dean considers whether it’s worth fighting over two minutes and nineteen seconds. At one time, he would have put his foot down and insist Ben come to the table immediately, but he’s learned a lot since then. From Cas. Dammit. Cas suggested that if it’s less than five minutes, and there are no time constraints, he should let Ben finish. If it’s more than five minutes, he should stick to his guns and make Ben transition. That suggestion has saved more than a few mealtimes. He wants to childishly ignore the advice just because it came from Cas, but that seems more pathetic than he already feels.  “Fine. Two minutes, but when it’s over shut it off and come to the table. If you don’t shut it off, no TV the rest of the night.”
Castiel remembers what John told him about Ash’s father, that he had been John’s best friend. The death must have triggered something in John if he’d finally given up his nomadic ways to settle down in Lawrence again. Castiel studies Dean’s face but the other man won’t make eye contact, instead studying his beer bottle intently. The good humor he’d had while playing is gone entirely.
“Women are fickle creatures, darling. Alas, they have left me. I shall have to find another,” Balthazar rejoins, swirling his wine in the bottom of the glass. “You should be glad that men aren’t as capricious.”
Dean glances down and takes Ben’s hand. “He’s a little nervous around dogs. Had a bad experience once when he was little, almost got bit. Now he don’t want nothin’ to do with ‘em.”
Castiel looks back with wide, hungry eyes and catches his lower lip between his teeth. Dean basks in the intensity of Castiel’s stare, frissons of heat skittering through him, and tugs the silk down Castiel’s legs. Castiel’s cock bobs free, already half hard. He draws in a sharp breath when Dean wraps his hand around the length and gives it a firm stroke before leaning in to close his mouth over the head.
In an incredible stroke of luck, they snag a parking space just a block away. The club roars with people, a driving beat shaking the floor and walls and reverberating through Dean’s chest as soon as they make it through the doors. Electronica isn’t Dean’s thing, but a beat is a beat, so he’s willing to overlook the lack of guitars once in a while. Lisa is at the bar, her nose ring glinting in the stage strobe lights each time she turns to place a drink on the counter. Dean shifts into an open space and waits. Her face lights up as soon as she sees him.
“Come on, baby, give it to me. Next time, I want you in me with nothing between us. Want you to fill me up so that even when it’s over, I can still feel you inside me.” Even with Ash, Dean has never done this without a condom, never even thought about it, but suddenly it’s something he wants with every fiber of his being. He wants to know that he and Cas belong to each other so completely that they need nothing between them.
Cas slides off the couch and kneels in front of Dean, a galaxy of emotion in his eyes as he takes Dean’s hands. “I know you would, but I could never ask you to do that. He’s your family and I trust you,” he murmurs, pressing kisses to the backs of Dean’s hands, his lips a soft caress over Dean’s knuckles. “I do trust you, Dean, no matter what I said. I knew you wouldn’t do that to me. I was just so scared that I forgot that there are no guarantees to anything in life. I’d rather have you for whatever time I can get than lose you completely because I’m too frightened to fight for what I want. I don’t want to be that person anymore.”
It certainly isn’t the end, though. Dean gapes at his son until Cas takes pity on him. “Only people who like each other in a very special way hold hands,” Cas says slowly though he’s looking at Dean and not Ben.
“We’re going to keep going with Ben,” Jess says suddenly as the crowd of children fade away. “Why don’t you catch up?” Castiel sees the look that passes between her and Dean, but he isn’t sure how to interpret it.
Dean nods again then clears his throat. “Yeah, I, ah, I’ve never gone without a condom,” he forces out as if speaking is a trial, “but I get tested every couple of months just to be on the safe side. I haven’t been with anyone since the last time I got tested.”
Cas leans forward and places a gentle kiss at the corner of his mouth. “I don’t think you could be a plain old mechanic if you tried, Dean.” Dean scoffs, a soft punch of air that sounds less like a laugh than he intended it, but Cas just narrows his eyes.
“Oh yeah, definitely,” Garth gushes. Everyone knows the slender man for his bubbling enthusiasm, which makes him perfect for this group. At ages eight to eleven, these kids have been swimming long enough the novelty has worn off, but they lack the commitment of the older students. They’re not ready to train for competition.
When Castiel breaks the surface, he treads water as he slicks his hair back and gives Dean a wide grin. “Come here,” he says, motioning with one hand.
Three courses in, Dean is just getting ready to flip into his turn when a shadow passes over him, and a splash reverberates through the water. Weight hits his neck with a jarring thud, sending him careening toward the pool floor. In shock, Dean gasps, and the acrid water floods his lungs. He’s sinking, drowning, a flailing weight driving him deeper into the water. His feet hit the bottom of the pool and, in a panic, he shoves off, using the momentum to twist away.
Right. Dinner. This is something he does know how to do. When he first got full custody of Ben after Lisa’s death, he was terrified that he wouldn’t know what to do. His father looked him in the eye and said
Charlie takes a sip of her coffee and groans loudly in delight, much to Castiel’s chagrin. Several of the teachers still milling around in the lounge look over at her. “I saw Meg in the hallway with Ben Winchester yesterday. Is he in your class?” she asks, making an abrupt shift in topic.
“Won’t know till you try.” Dean nudges his shoulder with the edge of the controller. “Come on, sit up.”
“I’m Castiel,” the guy says, holding out his hand. He ignores Dean's frantic attempt at flight. “Where did you study? Not K.U., not playing Satie like that. Tell me you didn’t go to Juilliard.”
In a repeat of the night they met, Will spends the rest of the evening moving between backstage and the dance floor. During the intermission between the two sets, he takes a few moments to confer with the band before wrapping his fingers around Castiel’s hand and leading him to the bar.
A spiral of depression and partying followed, until the night a month later when he woke in a hospital bed hooked up to monitors with an IV in his arm and a tube down his throat. Meg sat beside the bed, looking even tinier than usual in a pair of black tights and a baggy sweater, pale and drained. When she saw he was awake, she crawled onto the bed with him and curled against his chest. With a voice that trembled, she explained how the hospital had called because she was listed as his emergency contact in his phone. A customer at the club where he’d been partying found him passed out in the hallway to the bathroom and called 911. The ER doctor had already diagnosed alcohol poisoning and started treatment by the time Meg arrived. She explained, voice thick with unshed tears, that he’d started having convulsions shortly after the ambulance arrived. The nurse had told her that if he hadn’t been found when he had, he would likely have died or had lasting brain damage. The last drink before he passed out, one he doesn’t even remember, is the last one he’s ever had.
Dean is silent, his throat tightening with emotion. Dean spent so long angry at his father that they almost lost this chance. Dean could have packed up and went to California with Ash and never gotten to build this relationship with his father. From a distance, it would have been easier to hold onto the pain and frustration that always came along with having John Winchester as his father. Instead, Dean gave up the person who meant the most to him in the world after Sammy and stayed to help John with his battle for sobriety. Because of that, he not only has this relationship with his father, but he also has a son who is now the most important person in his world. Dean figures it was a decent trade-off.
Dean nods, keeping his pleasant grin fixed, and hefts four gallons of milk onto the belt. Charlie piles the chicken behind them. “Didn’t do too bad. Charlie cleaned up in the two-hundred-meter breaststroke.”
“You do exactly what he’s been doing,” she says. “Healing, seeing his doctors”—she gives Dean a pointed look—”and being honest with them about what’s happening. Keep the appointment at the college and your follow up with the neurologist. And try not to be too hard on yourself, Dean. You’ve got to give yourself time to heal. It’s frustrating when you’ve got all these demands, but you won’t meet them by pushing yourself.”
Castiel turns the conversation to music, and Dean is happy to play along. Despite his lack of musical ability before the accident, music has always played a big role in Dean’s life. They find they have a lot of musical interests in common, and they’re debating the best Led Zeppelin album when Peggy stops in front of the booth with a heavily laden tray.
“Maybe, but he’s not, you know?” At Dean’s blank look she adds, “Right all the time, I mean. He likes to think he is, but he can be kind of stubborn. I love him to death, but he’s not the ultimate authority on everything.”
Ash chuckles and climbs out of the car without responding. Score one, Winchester. While Dean collects the luggage from the trunk, Ash scoops Ben out of his booster seat and carries him into the house. Dean follows and drops the bags in the living room next to the tree. Dean and Sam divvied up the ornaments they had from when they were kids, so the tree was sparse the first few years. Between purchases and handmade ornaments, it is finally starting to fill in with Dean and Ben’s collection.
Ben catches sight of the face painting booth and tugs him forward excitedly. He launches himself at one of the KU art students running the booth, chattering excitedly. “Can you draw stars or planets or rocket ships? Or maybe Iron Man? Or the Flash?”
There are still dishes in the sink from making the potato salad for the picnic, but Dean can’t find the energy to rinse them and load the dishwasher. He heats leftover meatloaf and slumps in front of the television, mindlessly thumbing through his Netflix queue. It’s pathetic how much Cas has changed his life. Just a few months ago, dinner and TV alone was normal, but now the silence in the house is stifling. Even when Cas is only sitting next to him, the sound of his breathing and the warm, heavy weight of him pressed to Dean’s side are enough. Dean shivers with a sudden chill.
Dean pushes the heavy glass door open without pausing and looks around. Ash stands by a stack of amps with two teenage boys. He nods in Dean’s direction and jerks his head toward the piano with a grin. Castiel doesn’t seem to be around, and Dean’s shoulders slump as he takes his seat.
“Maybe,” Cas responds with a shrug, “but there could be a number of factors contributing to his fidgeting. It could be the presence of strangers, the way the paint feels drying on his face, or even his overall excitement about the festival that is making it hard for him to regulate himself. It doesn’t hurt to allow him a break, so it makes more sense than forcing him through it.”
He approaches cautiously, waiting for Dean to tell him to go away, but the other man just flicks his gaze up for a moment before turning back to the window. Castiel slides into the booth opposite him. He remains silent and this feels so much like waiting out Ben or one of the other children that he starts counting in his head before he even notices he’s doing it. Just shy of thirty, Dean looks up and meets his eyes.
“I want to be with you.” Cas takes a few quick, shallow breaths and Dean worries he will hyperventilate. His breathing calms again before he says, “I want you to be happy, Dean. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.”
Seeing the panic on Castiel’s face, the man leans back. “Look, man, I’m sorry if I read you wrong; if this isn’t something you’d be interested in,” he says, starting to get up.
a girlfriend, let alone that she was sitting at the other end of the couch. Bracing himself, he confesses, “I remembered that I shouldn’t be touching him; that his girlfriend probably doesn’t like it.”
Jody’s eyes snap with anger. “He’s not doing it on purpose, John. That was a panic attack he had yesterday. There’s no physical reason I can see, but who knows what’s going on in his brain. Between the traumatic experience and the TBI, this is nothing to mess with.”
Dean stomps back to the bedroom, pulling Ben along despite his struggling, and pushes him into the room. “What the hell, Ben? Seriously? I was up half the night folding those and you just fucking dump them on the floor? Why the hell would you do that?” His tone is still sharp, but he’s managed to rein in the volume.
Dean strums the guitar lightly, finding the weight and repetitive motions comforting. He doesn’t get to play as much as he’d like these days. He and Ash bonded over music, and most of their nights were spent with Ash playing video games while Dean messed around on the guitar. After Ash left, he spent hours in the music store downtown, hanging out and playing. In fact, that’s where he met Lisa when she came in to pick up a part for her mother’s piano. Now, the only time he picks up the guitar is when he’s playing for Ben. He’s the axis around which Dean’s entire life revolves.
Dean sucks him through it, swallowing reflexively while continuing to nuzzle his softening dick even after Cas falls back against the door bonelessly. He clamps his eyes shut and tries to slow his breathing, eventually pushing Dean away when the stimulation becomes too much.
“Give it up, dad. You’re not gettin’ my TV. Maybe now that you’re not dumpin’ money into that shithole, you can save up and get yourself a nice 55-inch.”
Cas spreads the papers from the clipboard out on the bench in front of them. They work through the lists methodically; with Dean offering suggestions for whether the work is essential or just something he’d recommend. He also gives an estimated price for each item. When Cas adds everything up, the total comes to just under five thousand dollars.
Meg steps back, her eyes narrowed into thin slits. “Ash was at Dean’s house? Can I guess from your reaction that they weren’t playing Monopoly?”
“If you’re sure,” Dean returns, studying his face. After a long moment, he turns to the blond at his right. “This is Jo. She’s a friend of the family. I guess I was actin’ a little nervous, so Jo offered to come along with me.”
Dean flushes slightly at the praise and takes a drink of his juice to cover his discomfort. “It’s not that hard,” he insists. “You just follow the recipe and most things turn out pretty good.”
Dean takes a few swallows to gather his thoughts and sets the bottle down with a loud clunk. “This is fucking awkward.”
There are days when Castiel hates his complete ineptitude with cooking. He would like to be able to create exquisite meals made of fresh, healthy ingredients. After an unfortunate situation with a frying pan shot flames over a foot into the air, though, he gave up trying. Instead, he lives on a whole foods diet he supplements with take-out and things that are easily microwaved. The only things he makes on the stove anymore are omelets and he can’t even remember the last time anyone but Meg turned the oven on.
Castiel struggles to keep up with the conversation, glancing between them. “Oh, yes, ah, I’ve lived here for several years.”
She narrows her eyes before shaking her head with a small sound of disappointment. “Ash and Sam are opening the pool. Tanker delivered the water this morning, so they’re hookin’ up the filter and doin’ the chemicals. The grill and chairs and stuff need brought of the garage.”
Dean shakes his head. “You just said you don’t like it. If you don’t like it, we won’t do it. That’s the end of it.” He won’t be anything like the guy who hurt Cas. Cas deserves better than someone who only thinks with his dick. No matter how hard it will be, he’ll figure out how to do without.
Dean smiles and pulls the pan of pizza pinwheels out of the oven. There’s something so freaking normal about cooking a meal while Cas and Ben play on the floor that it makes something warm bubble up in his chest. He pushes the pinwheels off the pan with a spatula and tries to focus on the good feelings instead of the frisson of terror that quickly follows.
Meg look shoots daggers, then she throws up her hands with a huff. “Yes, whatever, shagging, fucking, so on and so forth. We’re getting off topic here.”
“I’m flying up to Ann Arbor to see Anna late Friday night. We’d be back Monday evening if you want to come,” Meg shares. “There’s still time to get you a ticket.” Anna Milton is Meg’s older sister. Her daughter, Krissy, is a big part of the reason Castiel has this life that he didn’t even know he wanted. That summer in Chicago twelve years ago set Castiel’s life on this trajectory.
Dean can't help but agree. Although Bobby isn't his father, he’s filled the gap every time John Winchester wasn’t able to be the father his boys needed. John may have brought him into the world, but Bobby Singer had just as big a role in making him the man he is today.
Dean puts his hand on his father’s knee. “You haven’t been doing it alone. Grandma and pap, Jody, they’ve been there for us. And you did all right, Dad. Look at Sammy, big man on campus now. He’s gonna be a lawyer. And I swear I’m okay. I just can’t swim anymore.”
“That’s not right. This is a 2014 Honda CR-V,” Ben states. “The manufacturer’s listed miles per gallon is twenty-three city, thirty-one highway. That’s what the book says.”
“That part didn’t hurt. It was worth getting the piano tuned.” Dean tilts his head to rest on her shoulder and she kisses the top of his head before she continues. “No one has played that thing in years.”
Cas stands, a little shaky and numb. He wants to bury his head in Dean’s shoulder and hide from the whole damn thing. Instead, he takes a few steps closer then stops. “You and Ben are everything I always wanted, Dean. I’ve been terrified that this would happen, that Ash would decide he wants you back, and that your history with him will win out just like it always does.”
Ash shrugs and closes his eyes. It makes Dean want to reach out and shake him. “Maybe ‘cause I’m not sure what you’ll say. Probably ‘cause I’m not sure what I would say back.”
“You should probably skip the traumatic brain injury and almost drowning, though.” As soon as the words are out, Dean could kick himself. If this is the quality of his flirting, it’s probably a good thing he hasn’t had to rely on it to get laid.
Dean wishes he could pinpoint the fight Ben is talking about, but he and Ash fight so much sometimes that it’s impossible without more details. He just shrugs uncomfortably. “Okay, well, yeah, me and Ash, we figured out after Lisa, uh, after your mom died that we still liked each other in the kissing way,” Dean ends lamely. He feels Cas shaking slightly behind him and he knows he’s trying not to laugh at Dean’s embarrassment.
Dean catches himself on the door handle and pulls himself upright. He shakes his head as he yanks the door open. “I have every business. It’s my life. Not yours. She’s not coming back and neither am I.” He slams the door behind him and yanks his keys out of his pocket. Fuck the doctors. Dean needs to get away as soon as possible.
“Asshole,” Dean adds in agreement. “Okay, so what you’re telling me is that if I need someone to help me get rid of the bodies, Meg is the person I should talk to?”
Having a height advantage, and being evenly matched for weight and build, Castiel could have defended himself, but he was so shocked that it never occurred to him to punch back. He lost his balance when he hit the wall, collapsing into a heap on the floor. It was only a moment before Malachi was on him, screaming allegations, accusing him of sleeping with Meg, ripping at his clothes. It was like an increasingly volatile re-creation of his last fight Raphael. Castiel’s blood was smeared everywhere, wide red swaths on the tile beneath them and across both of their faces and hands.
Castiel can’t bring himself to meet Will’s eyes, so he just nods and leads him into the living room. Castiel sits on the end of the long pale couch and waits for Will to take a seat. He isn’t surprised when the other man chooses to sit right next to him rather than putting distance between them. He waits in silence for Castiel to compose himself.
Cas rolls his eyes. “Dean and Ash. When I went to Dean’s house this morning, Ash was there in his underwear.”
Annie has stopped crying now, nothing but little whimpers against Benny’s chest. Ben, however, is still struggling and yelling. His fists are pummeling Dean’s chest, and Dean grunts with the impact when one catches his chin. “Sorry, man,” Dean says to Benny and then repeats the apology to Andrea when she appears beside him.
“I could tell you it gets easier, but I’m not sure it does,” she says with a small laugh. “I think we just get better at handling it.”
Cas doesn’t respond for a moment, weighing his words. He’s glad Dean is talking to him, instead of shutting him out like he does to his family, but he’s not sure now is the right time to delve into this. “It’s hard, Dean, to be a single parent. Your family loves you and Ben. Sometimes it feels like they’re questioning your judgment, but they’re just trying to help.”
Castiel does a double take. “Jesus, Dean.” He wraps one hand firmly around his dick as if he’s trying to stop himself from blowing. “Tempting as that is, I’m not waiting. Come on.” Castiel holds out his hand to help Dean up and leads him to the bedroom.
“Okay, no problem,” Dean says. The doctor steps over to the other patient, and Dean wracks his brain for how to talk Ben into this.
She nods and presses a hand to Cas’ arm. “Come on, Castiel,” she directs. “You look exhausted. We’ll go up and you can lie down for a while.”
The edges of the tattoos are thick black lines with no shading. On his right wrist is the lotus flower, but Dean only recognizes the symbol on his left as Egyptian. He reaches out to run his finger over it, but Cas pulls his arm back before he can touch. Dean swallows tightly and waves his hand to indicate Cas’ wrist to cover the awkwardness. “Egyptian, right?” he says, forcing his voice even.
Dean gives her a cheeky smirk. “Yeah, I’ve heard piercings make a lot of things, ah, sensitive. He got piercings anywhere else?”
Dean chuckles and releases him. For a moment, Cas wants nothing more than to pull him back, to continue what they started, but then Dean picks up his guitar and Cas remembers that he wanted Dean to play for him. He climbs onto the bed and settles himself against the headboard, legs stretched out in front of him. “Come here,” he murmurs, indicating the space between his spread legs.
“Yes. Ben is very visually oriented. He may respond better to a video, perhaps coupled with a shirt that smells like you for an added sensory component.”
Castiel squints at him. “It would be awesome to be able to play any song I knew. Rehearsals would go a lot quicker.”
He doesn’t look up when he hears Juliet pad slowly across the room with a soft whine. She curls onto her side, a warm weight pressed again him and rests her head on his hip. Without opening his eyes, he raises one hand to run his fingertips gently across the top of her head then down her back to rest on her flank.
Cas lets his head fall back against the headboard and closes his eyes. The vibrations of the guitar transfer through Dean’s body to his chest, making the music feel like its coming from inside him. There’s such a contrast between the man between his legs and the angry, barely controlled man that appeared earlier at Bobby’s. Cas has seen the anger in Dean enough times to know its there, but he’s never seen it bubble so close to the surface.
“For fucks sake, Samuel. It’s a flat blade. Grab one out of the toolbox right there.”  Ash is on the other end of the pool, setting the timer and ensuring that all of the GFCI receptacles are working properly. He stops and pushes his hair back out of eyes as soon as he catches sight of Dean. “Your brother is beyond useless with his hands,” he snarks.
“Really? What? Are you fucking kidding me? You’re giving me whiplash. One minute you’re playing Cas up, telling me I should take a shot with him and the next you’re jerking my chain. Is this a fucking joke to you?”
Castiel thinks about denying that he’s nervous, then answers with a sigh of his own. “It’s been a long since I’ve, well, since I’ve done this.”
Cas pulls back, trying to free his hand, but Dean holds tight, so he just sighs. “I don’t know if that’s a good idea, Dean, with Ben right across the hall.”
Dean leans into the pressure, feeling the tension drain out of his shoulders, before turning to face him. This isn’t only his first swim event since the accident; it’s also his first public event with Cas by his side. Sometime in the last three months, Castiel became Cas, and he’d wedged himself into Dean’s life and never left.
“You’re a charmer, that’s what you are, boy,” Missouri cackles. Turning back to Ben, she presses her cheek to his. “I’m gonna miss having my partner in crime with me during the day, Benjamin. You never know what kind of trouble I’ll get into all by my lonesome.” Ben doesn't respond, just presses both hands to Missouri’s cheeks, staring into her face like he sometimes does. Dean’s always thought that Ben has an awkward way of looking at a person either too much or not enough.
When the elevator doors slide open, Balthazar is leaning against the back wall. He looks as tired as Cas feels. “You look like shit, Cassie,” he says, his British accent more pronounced with his fatigue.
“I don’t believe I saw that in the school rules, Benjamin. I’ll have to discuss it with Ms. Johnson. Perhaps they’ll make an exception for me.”
Ash responds with a shuttered look, his voice defensive. “Nah, I’ll see them tomorrow. Let’s just go home.”
Dean sighs softly. Ash comes home for Christmas every year. He usually starts the week staying with his mother and Bobby, but by mid-week he typically migrates to Dean’s house. If he’s starting at Dean’s, something must be wrong. Dean types out a response under the table, trying to be discreet.
The conversation turns light again and they exit the restaurant in the midst of a debate over whether punk rock could be considered the forefather of '90s era grunge. “You know,” Will says as they start toward the lot where they left the truck, “if you want to walk a couple blocks, we could head down to Supersonic. Ava said they’re getting a boatload of old LPs in from an estate sale today. We could take first crack at it.”
Cas reaches out and takes his hand, winding their fingers together. He stares at them for a long time, then tips his head back to look up at Dean. “He doesn’t seem as clear about your split as you suggested.”
There’s a soft chuckle, quickly stifled, and Cas assures him, “Of course, Ben. If you’re late, I will give them treats, though I’m confident you won’t have to stay overnight.”
Ben snags his coloring book and crayons and runs over to the older man. “Color with me, Uncle Bobby?”
It took Dean and three nurses to restrain Ben the last time he got shots, so Dean doesn’t want that either. “I doubt there will be shots, bud. They’re just gonna check you out and make sure you’re okay.”
“Don’t,” Dean says, his voice low and calm despite the pain in his chest. “Don’t bring her into this. You made it perfectly fucking clear you didn’t want to see what I was doing, so you don’t get to throw her in my face. If you ever mention her again, I’ll bring guys home and blow them on the stairs in the foyer.”
“I’m not here for parent night, Miss Masters,” Dean retorts sweetly. Two can play this stupid game. By the time he turns back to Cas, the other man has shrugged back into a long-sleeved dress shirt and is buttoning the last button. “You don’t need to do that, Cas. I don’t know why you hide them, but your ink is awesome.”
Dean steps back, pulling him under the water again. Although it’s not burning him anymore, he feels warm everywhere Dean touches. This is better, so much better. He tries to smile against Dean’s chest, but the muscles in his face won’t cooperate, so he just sighs and lets Dean hold him.
Sam and Jess’ car is already parked in the driveway behind John’s truck when Dean pulls the Impala up in front of Bobby and Ellen’s. While there’s quite bit that can’t be done until tomorrow, including most of the cooking, getting the pool opened and moving all the lawn furniture out of the garage will probably take most of the day.
“It’s cool, man. You don’t owe me any explanations. I don’t expect you to wait around while I figure out how to pull my head outta my ass.”
Pam takes the envelope and slides the papers out. As she flips through the forms, she makes a few soft humming noises that Dean wants to ask about. Instead, he looks over at Ben. He’s holding Benson tight against his chest, studying Pam intensely. Dean reaches out to run a hand through his hair and says softly, “You okay, bug? Not nervous are you? Nothin’ to be nervous ‘bout.”
All the words Cas wishes Dean would say swirl in his mind. He wants desperately to believe Dean, to trust that Dean’s feelings for him are strong enough to overcome the past that Dean shares with Ash. He remembers the way they were at Christmas. Ash’s easy, confident charm and the way he drew Dean like a moth to a flame. He watched while Ash played Dean, first flirting with Cas and then turning Dean on as easily as flipping a switch. He has never asked, but he’s almost certain Dean slept with Ash after he, Gabriel and Kali left. There doesn’t seem to be much that Ash wants that he doesn’t get.
Ash tilts his head. “Okay,” he says with a smirk. The song fills the silence for a few beats before he adds, “Should I call him?”
Cas releases Dean to grasp sharply at his shoulder and tug until the other man gets the hint and allows himself to be manhandled until he’s facing Cas. He straddles Cas’ legs, grinding against him as he pulls Cas in for a wet, filthy kiss, tongue thrusting lazily into Cas’ mouth.
He doesn’t respond at first, not even to offer some brush-off. Even Ben has commented on how short-tempered Dean has been all week. He was so wound up last night that Ben asked him if he needed wrapped in a blanket to calm down. He’s tried to put it down to stress over handing over the GTO, but he knows that’s not the case. It’s what he tells Jess anyway.
“You’ve always been blind to the shit he does. He’s been playing you since we were kids. Things weren’t as Rainbow Brite as you remember them.”
Dean squashes the little voice telling him that waiting around for Ash is stupid. It sounds suspiciously like Sammy. He’s not waiting around. It’s not like he sits around pining over the guy, but if he happens to be available when Ash is back in town, no one can fault him for taking advantage of it. It’s not hurting anyone.
Dean’s tired, so he doesn’t fight it. They pass John on their way out of the lobby, and he tells them he won’t be home for dinner. Dean and Charlie exchange glances since John is almost never at the house at all.
This thing with Cas, though, feels different. It feels more like planning for the future. He wants to know Cas, to find out what makes him tick, and how he thinks about the world. Dean wants to curl up on the couch with him and watch movies, take Ben to the park, and just
Two of the younger girls in the first row pull Dean’s attention away from Justin. They both clearly enjoy swimming, but the taller brunette needs to pay attention to the angle her arms hit the water or she’ll pull a muscle. Dean points it out to Garth, who says he’s been trying to correct the habit for weeks. He’s walking back to the bleachers when a hushed voice, clipped in anger, draws his attention.
“I told you to leave him the fuck alone, Balthazar. You know better than to bring up Malachi,” she chastises, angry now.
After a few moments of silence, Cas sighs deeply. “Anyway, that was a long, drawn out explanation of how the non-rebellious teenager ended up heavily tattooed and pierced. I got the wings first, right after I changed my major. They were a symbol, I suppose, of the feeling of freedom I felt at choosing my own path.” He brushes his hand down his side, fingertips grazing Dean’s chest. “The tree of life came next. I took several religious art history classes that year. Although my family wasn’t particularly religious, I had a hard time at first with the way my and Michael’s relationship changed when we started sleeping together. It helped me to look at other religions, to see that love and connection are universal.”
Jess rolls her eyes even more dramatically. “Mr. Pacifist,” she jokes. “You know he won’t even kill spiders in the house? Wanted me to catch one in a cup and take it outside. He sulked the rest of the night after I smashed the fucker with my shoe.”
, but he doesn’t. Even if he had the guts to open that can of worms, he certainly wouldn’t do it with Ben in the car. Instead, he punches the power button on the radio and shoves in a cassette.
Finally, after a few more minutes of conversation, Dean looks over at Castiel. His eyes are wide and excited, with a smile splitting his handsome face. He gives Castiel a thumbs up.
Dean nods; a jerky movement that doesn’t come close to capturing everything he wants to say. He looks down at his watch. “I don’t want to leave you like this.”
John shifts uncomfortably before turning to look at Dean. “You know you don’t got to worry about me if you two are more than friends, right? I might not understand it, but if bein’ with a guy makes you happy, that’s all I want. Cas seems like a good guy, even if his brother is a bit of a weirdo.”
Dean and Cas do snuggle up on the couch. It feels weird to just sit with Cas pressed against him without the television to distract them. Instead, they talk more. No matter how much time they spend together, how much they text or talk on the phone, it seems that they never run out of things to say. They talk about the progress Dean has made on the GTO, about the upcoming holiday, and the projects the kids in Cas’ class are making for the Autism Walk in two weeks.
The boy comes to him in his dreams as well, and Castiel has meditated on the image, trying to gain some insight into why the boy has been appearing to him. Castiel began adding the child to his drawings when he was a teenager, but the youngster didn’t start appearing in his dreams until he moved to Lawrence. No matter what the boy is doing, it is only his back Castiel sees, never catching even a glimpse of the child’s profile. His hair is fine and silky, a dark mahogany brown, very similar to the shade of Castiel’s own hair. Where Castiel’s hair is choppy and unruly, sticking up in every direction despite his attempts to tame it, the boy’s hair lies close to his head, soft waves ending in small curls against the back of his neck. By his size, Castiel guesses he can be no more than five or six years old. He’s thin but not scrawny and seems to possess a strength that belies his youth.
Cas stares down at his hands folded in his lap as if he can’t bear to look at Dean. He nods slightly, a movement that Dean wouldn’t have caught except that he can’t tear his eyes away from Cas. “I know,” he whispers, his voice gutted. “That’s why I didn’t come in.”
They stand together like that, holding on to one another, as they watch Ben talk with his usual animation. The patter of his voice carries to them, not the words, but he doesn’t sound sad. At one point, he waves his hand in their direction, as if he’s calling Lisa’s attention to them and a strangled sob escapes the man beside him. Castiel tightens his grip and stays silent.
“You don’t have to,” Dean says, scooping Ben up in his arms again. Unlike Ben, Dean’s eyes are red and swollen, though he’s wiped away any evidence from his cheeks.
Instead of embracing Michael when he asked Castiel to move in with him, Castiel panicked. Not expecting that reaction, Michael was full of hurt and confusion. Looking back, Castiel knows he should have asked Michael to wait, to give him time to become comfortable with the idea. He should have explained what he was thinking and feeling, how the offer of a key and commitment reminded him of the expectations leveled by his father. Instead, he ran; ran from Michael and all of their happiness.
“Well, he invited you to his family’s Christmas and he’s willing to put up with complete strangers to have you here, he watches you when he thinks you aren't looking, and he was obviously irritated when Cinderella was seducing you during lunch. I’d say it’s pretty obvious.”
Bobby is behind the gnarled old desk in his office when Dean wanders in. He smooths out the check and lays it in the center of the forms Bobby is looking at. “Damn,” Bobby says with a low whistle. “Looks like you did it, kid.”
Sam reads the first question for Jo’s team. “The largest sculptures in the world are 90 feet high, on the face of Stone Mountain, near Atlanta, Georgia. Which three people are depicted on these sculptures?”
Dean is grateful when he senses a presence to his left. He’s hoping its Jolene coming to his rescue. Though she and Candace have been friends for years, she has taken to running interference for him. Neither of them has mentioned what is happening, but he welcomes her help.
“Dean! Dean, look at me. Can you hear me?” Charlie’s voice breaks through the crashing noise. Dean swings his head around and finds her crouched next to them. She leans in, gripping his arms and shaking him. He focuses on her face, on the shapes her mouth makes as she speaks. “Answer me, Dean. Are you okay?”
“She forgets I’m not in elementary school anymore,” Castiel says when she passes through the swinging door into the kitchen.
He throws the box on the counter and crouches to pull the pizza stone out of the cabinet. It may not be homemade, but at least the crust can be nice and crispy. He sets the stone down gently and pulls the cardboard tab to open the pizza just as he notices his phone buzzing in his pocket.
“Seriously. I’m sitting over here without a beer for almost nine months now and you’re over there wasting perfectly good IPA. That’s some kind of crime,” Jess grouses good-naturedly.
Meg’s face softens slightly at his obvious discomfort. This is the side of herself she only shows a few people, Castiel being primary. It transports Castiel back to when they first met; when she brought her first-grade class into the gallery for an art class he was offering. He’s reminded that no-one knows him better than Meg, not even his brother Gabriel. Meg is the axis around which his life rotates. “I just don’t like it when you leave marks, Clarence,” she murmurs softly, relenting long enough to rest her head against the center of his chest.
“She did? That’s, uh, good. Yes, we need to talk.”  Gone is the smooth, scholarly professional from earlier. In his place is the awkward, easily flustered man that Dean is rapidly falling for.
“No, you listen,” she snaps, cutting him off. “Castiel was under the impression that you and he were forming a connection beyond friendship. Despite the way you encourage him with your disgusting flirting, this is clearly not the case. He has been through too much to waste his time on an immature, insensitive cad, which you clearly are. If there is the slightest bit of decency in you, which I severely doubt, you will walk away and let him be. He doesn’t need you playing with his emotions. We are leaving now. You should come say your goodbyes.”
As grateful as I am to anyone who reads this monster that has taken up most of life for the last year, I want to give extra special thanks to those of you who followed this story as a WIP. Your feedback kept me going when I was struggling and made me excited to post a new chapter every week. Keep an eye out here. I've got a couple other things in the works over the next few months but don't be surprised if some timestamps pop up every now and then. I don't think there's any way I can leave these guys forever.
Rather than heading toward the porch, Dean leads them through the yard to the back of the house. Bobby and Jo are fiddling with the grill, arguing loudly about something Cas can’t quite make out while Ash and Ben sit on the upper deck. A sleek paper airplane floats directly over their heads as they come around the corner and buries itself in the lilac bush next to the garage.
“Awesome,” Dean exclaims. “Cool then, I’ll, uh, guess I’ll see you on Wednesday then.” Before Castiel can respond, he turns and jogs down the driveway. Castiel watches him until he catches up with his family and they turn the corner to the next block.
“You don’t work your way up to dungeon master without learning a thing or two about people,” she says with a wink.
“Are we eating out for lunch?” Cas asks, fiddling with the radio. When he doesn’t find anything he likes on the dial, he reaches under the seat and pulls out Dean’s box of cassettes. He rifles through them until he finds what he’s looking for and Dean smiles when Seger’s live album drifts from the speakers. He adjusts the volume until he’s satisfied and shoves the box back under the seat. Only then does he look up and realize Dean has been watching him out of the corner of his eye. “What?”
Castiel gives Dean’s hand a slight squeeze before pulling away. They finish their meals in companionable silence and even though Castiel is thoroughly stuffed, he lets Dean talk him into ordering a rich peppermint hot chocolate and panna cotta for dessert. The waitress brings two spoons and winks when she sets the dessert between them. Dean dips his spoon into the creamy dessert and holds it out, his eyes flicking from the tip of the spoon to Castiel’s lips before raising to meet his eyes.
Dean glances away quickly, refusing to acknowledge Cas’ look, but he does lean away from Ash. Not that it does any good. Ash continues his teasing despite several pointed looks from Dean. He wants to pull away or say something to Ash, but he’s not sure how to do it without causing a scene. Ash is definitely not taking the hint. Dean is grateful when Sam’s team finally answers the winning question correctly. Without meeting anyone’s eyes, Dean quickly excuses himself to run upstairs to the bathroom.
Patty shrugs flippantly. “Two or three photographers and a half dozen writers from various blogs and local magazines. Nothing more than usual.”
Dean can feel the blood rising in his cheeks. “I, ah, holy shit, man,” is the only response that seems fitting.
Dean doesn’t let go until they’re pulling up the long driveway. There are cars parked along the entire length, but Dean follows it to where it curves around behind the barn. There’s only room for one more car in the small gravel patch.
“Here you go, Ben,” Cas says, holding out the water. Ben turns and Cas sees what he is holding at the exact same moment Dean does if Dean’s gasp is any indicator.
Castiel chuckles and dutifully keeps his hands to himself though he continues to shoot Dean heated looks. Dean hadn’t planned on today’s activities being of the physical variety, but he’s finding it harder and harder to remember why waiting seems like a good idea.
“If you two are done baiting each other, I could use some help chopping,” says the woman in question. She shoves the ingredients onto the central island and then turns back the stove. She spins the dial, bringing up the flame under the pan, preparing to transfer over the salmon fillets.
“She’s bubbly,” Meg responds as if this is the worst damnation. Of course, in Meg’s world, greeting each day with a smile is certainly suspect.
Cas nods like he was expecting Dean’s answer and leads them into the living room. The large wall of windows at the back of the house reflect the indoor lights back at them, making it look like they’re facing a giant mirror.
Juliet lets out a soft whine as he pushes the front door open. She’s wearing a purple cape with gold and silver stars and a pointed hat held on with elastic. Although it seems silly, she appears to enjoy joining the festivities. Seeing the children covering the sidewalks in front of the house, she gives a happy wiggle and follows Castiel outside.
The last time he was in a club, he had been able to lose himself in the music. Although the vibrations reverberate through his chest the same way tonight, he can’t get into it. After a while, his head hurts and his eyes go fuzzy. His chest aches. It’s too much. He has to get away.
Part of Dean expects Cas to immediately come over to him, but the other man winds his way through the small groups of parents slowly, starting with the group farthest from where Dean, Jolene, and Candace are standing. He continues to sneak little glances at Cas as he chats with the mothers about the upcoming volunteer opportunities at the school, and by the time Cas is talking to the group just a few feet away, Dean is strung tight as a bow string.
Castiel is confused for a moment before he realizes that Dean must have contacted his father to come stay with Ben. The amount of foresight Dean puts into every situation is impressive.
He turns wide eyes on Dean, the blue gaze even more defined against the unusual paleness of his skin. When Dean reaches him, Cas steps closer and seems to crumple into himself, hand grabbing reflexively at Dean’s bicep. “Is everything okay?” Dean manages though his arm is shaking with the effort of restrained violence.
Dean watches as she goes to the TV in the corner and loads up the DVD, his heart in his throat. She returns to sit next to him on the bed with the remote.
Trying is all Dean has ever done, but his attempts to be the son John wanted, the son Mary would have been proud of, have never been good enough. Frustration wars with his desire to see his plan through. He twists under John’s outstretched arm and spits back, “I did try. I tried, and it killed me that I couldn’t do it.”
Cas pulls away and Dean raises his hands to cup his cheeks, thumbs wiping the wet trails away. They stay like that, Dean gently soothing him, coaxing him. The heavy, suffocating vice that has been wrapped around his chest for the last two hours starts to ease, until Dean leans in to kiss him and Cas twists away, stepping out of his arms and putting several feet between them.
His eyelids flutter open and he’s staring into Castiel’s eyes again. “Two, Cas. Just two, and one of them wasn’t Ben’s mom. Sex is easy, but it burns out and I don’t want that to happen with us. I want this to be about more than gettin’ off.”
Dean chuckles and shakes his head. “Yeah, my boyfriend. We’ve only been together for a couple weeks. Guess it’s still new.”  Dean glances around the crowd behind Hank to see if Cas has returned, but he doesn’t see him.
When Ellen arrives with the food, there are a few minutes of silence while everything is sorted out. Three burgers, a grilled chicken salad, and nuggets for Ben, along with two bottles of beer, two glasses of iced tea, and a chocolate milk. Castiel peels the top off the bun off to add more ketchup, then pauses when he realizes that Dean hasn’t even touched his burger. Usually, he’s three bites in before Castiel takes his first.
. I met Ash, and then Meg, and there were all these doors opening. It’s about rushing full force ahead, taking what you want, and leaving no prisoners.” Castiel presses his lips to Dean’s forehead and buries his nose in Dean’s hair for a moment. “I had to decide. Lay down or fight. I chose to fight, but these remind me. It was always a choice.”
Will insists on paying for Castiel’s coffee and even though it’s less than two dollars, it feels significant. They walk hand in hand back to the lot where he left Meg’s SUV. Castiel pulls open the door and slides into the driver’s seat with a shiver. Will waits while he starts the car, turning the heat up full blast to warm the interior.
A loud banging on the door makes him jump even though it happens the same way every morning. “I’ll start breakfast,” Charlie calls through the door. “If I don’t hear you in the shower when I get to the kitchen, I’m coming back with a bowl of ice water.”
Castiel digests that information. He thought it odd that Ben never mentioned his mom, but he didn’t want to ask. “That’s very sad,” he responds, “for both of them. To lose a wife and mother so young—”
“I, ah, I gotta say somethin’. I wasn’t going to, but I just can’t, I mean, I don’t want to not say it tonight and then lose my nerve, ‘cause I tend to be chickenshit about this kind of stuff and this is important. You’re important, and I promised you I’d tell the truth, and even though I feel like I’m going to puke on your shoes right now, I gotta say it,” Dean rambles and rambles, until Castiel wants to grab him by the arms and shake him until he spits it out.
“Take it easy, Dean,” Sam chastises. “We haven’t told anyone else yet. She hasn’t even had her first OB appointment yet and we want to make sure everything is okay before we tell everyone.”
Ben nods solemnly. “Mr. Novak says if I don’t go under the desk tomorrow, he’ll let me look at the telescope again. Benson likes looking through the telescope.”
Dean can recite the story; he’s heard it enough times. Deanna likes to remind Dean how much his mother loved her family, how happy she was with her life despite having given up her dream. The story is supposed to reassure him, but the possibility of what Mary could have accomplished if it wasn’t for Dean is always there. Mary was happy despite having Dean, not because of him.
Castiel squints at the three of them in confusion. “Will one of you please tell me what is going on?” he pleads.
He’s no more prepared to see Dean when he pulls open the door than he was at parent night over a week ago. He’d waited with mounting tension through the first twenty minutes of this week’s meeting, but Dean and Ben never came. He wasn’t sure whether to be disappointed or relieved.
“Hold your fucking hips still, boy,” he shouts, and Dean tries to tune him out. His hips are stable even with the power of his kicks and his arms cut through the water as he propels himself forward. Even when the water covers his head, flooding his ears and drowning out the world above the surface, John’s words are audible. “Your arms are spaghetti. If you can’t hold your form, maybe you need to spend more time in the gym. One day off is enough to make you lazy.”
Castiel thanks her; he has a sufficient picture of the situation now. He walks over to the science center in the back of the room, selecting a few books on astronomy before returning to the desk. Castiel folds himself down into a seated position next to the desk, being careful to keep himself out of sight of the boy. “Ben?” he asks softly. No response, but Castiel isn’t surprised. He slides one of the books in front of the opening of the desk. If Ben is looking that way, he’ll be able to see the bright picture of an asteroid belt on the front. “I heard you like astronomy. I thought you might like this book.”
Dean snaps his head up at the sound of tires squealing on pavement, just moments before a silver Audi pulls around the building.  He drags himself to his feet before the door opens and a bearded man wearing dark aviator glasses climbs out. Dean doesn’t know a whole lot about suits, but even he can tell that the man’s clothes are expensive and tailored perfectly for him.
Once everything is in place, Dean unfolds one of the lounge chairs and falls back onto it, letting his eyes drift closed. He hears Sam approaching and isn’t surprised to see his brother’s long, lanky body filling up the chair beside him when he opens his eyes. They sit in silence for a few minutes before Sam takes a deep breath.
“That sounds nice. I wish our family was closer together. It gets to be a pain dragging everyone all over the country every year,” Jolene responds. She turns to Cas. “How about you, Castiel? Are you going to visit your mother again this year?”
Dean isn’t sure what to say about Miss Morgan’s level of compassion—or the likelihood of getting third-degree burns from the heater—so he’s relieved when his phone rings. He pushes the speakerphone icon and cuts off Cas’ immediate panicked litany with, “He’s okay. I’ve got him, and you’re on speakerphone.” The last thing they need is Cas saying something while he’s upset that Ben repeats at school.
They kiss goodbye in the morning, hello when they see each other after work, and before bed at night, but they’re chaste, almost friendly kisses. Just a soft, warm press of Dean’s lips to his before Dean pulls away. Cas has tried to lean into the kisses, opening his mouth and even moaning, but Dean just licks his lips and walks away. There is always something amazing he has to show Cas, or he remembers a funny story about work. Every single time. It’s infuriating.
Castiel tips his fedora forward with two fingertips and flips the tommy gun up to his hip with his foot. “There are many things my father taught me here in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer,” he intones.
“And that’s more on you than it is on me. On you and Bobby and Ellen, ‘cause they picked up the slack when I couldn’t. Your mother’s death broke me, Dean. When I should have been there for you, and for Sam, I let it sweep me away.” He looks to where his youngest son has scooped up his grandson onto his shoulders and smiles. “You did a good job with him, Dean. You were just as much a father to Sam as I ever was, even though you were just a kid yourself and never shoulda’ needed to. And you’ll do just fine with Ben too. I’m proud of you, boy. I don’t think you’ll ever know just how damn proud of you I am.”
Cas shakes his head. “I’m fine, Dean. Finish your breakfast. I’m just going to walk out to the lake and back.”
Kali and Castiel leave Gabriel rolling around on the floor in the hallway and carry the bags to one of the spare bedrooms. It is so rarely used that Castiel had been sure to air it out and turn the heat on to prepare for their arrival. By the time they return from the bedroom, Gabriel has made his way into the kitchen and is rooting through the refrigerator.
“It took me over an hour to get the slime out of the carpet!” Candace exclaims, punctuating the end of her story with a grimace. Jolene and the other parents laugh, so Dean joins in even though he wasn’t really listening. He managed to place himself toward the side of the cluster of parents, out of Candace’s reach. She has continued to ignore his subtle rebuttals over the past few weeks, so he’s had to escalate to keeping his distance. He really hopes she doesn’t force him into an outright rejection.
Dean kneels on the pavement in front of him. “Have a good day, buddy. I’ll be here at three to pick you up. You’re gonna have so much fun.” Dean takes Benson and tucks him gently into Ben’s backpack. He tries to push down the queasy feeling in his stomach and presses his lips to Ben’s hair, the soft waves tickling his nose. He feels tears prickle behind his eyes and tells himself it is just normal first-day-of-kindergarten emotion.
“Cut it out,” she says with a glare. “If I hear you call him ‘the smart one’ one more time, I’m going to beat you senseless, and you know I could do it. He’s not the smart one because you’re not the dumb one.”
Ash climbs out and shuts the door behind him. Dean takes a few deep breaths in the quiet confines of the car before following. He feels raw and rung out and there is a headache creeping up behind his eyes. He’d rather just start the car and drive home, but that isn’t an option, so he reluctantly follows Ash into the house.
It’s all the encouragement Cas needs. He tugs the bedside drawer open and pulls out the wrist cuffs. It only takes a moment to fasten them, though he pauses to drag his tongue lazily down the sensitive skin of Dean’s forearms before clipping the carabiners in place. He steps back and watches as Dean gives a few experimental tugs on the ropes though he only has a few inches of slack. “They’re not pinching you?” he asks, voice thick. Seeing Dean like this, spread out like a banquet for him to feast on, makes him uncomfortably hard, but he resists stripping out of his jeans.
“I don’t know. I mean, I like the guy a lot but we’ve spent the last four months dancin’ around each other. I didn’t even realize he wanted more, but I guess he did, and I fucked it all up,” Dean reaches for his bottle and then sets it back down when he remembers that it’s empty.
Ben cheers and Juliet wiggles her whole body. Castiel hands Ben the end of the leash, explaining how to signal to Juliet if he wants her to slow down. He takes a few treats from his pocket and hands them to Ben. “Give her one now, one when you get to the trees and one when you come back."
“I’m not denying it.” He wishes he could, wishes he could say that Ash has never had any kind of hold over him. “But this isn’t Christmas. He’s not taking the job, Cas. He knows that there’s nothing here for him anymore because he knows that I’m in love with you.”
Oliver promises to send Dean’s grandparents in and leaves, stopping to drop the clipboard into a metal sleeve on the wall by the door. Dean stares into the darkness behind his eyelids. No matter how hard he tries, he doesn’t remember being in the pool or the accident. His muscles ache, but no worse than usual after a challenging training session. The pounding in his head and the ache in his chest are enough to tell him something unusual happened though. If he swallowed water, the dry rasp makes sense. Chlorine does a number on him.
Candace laughs and pushes her arm playfully, sloshing juice over the edge of the cup. “Oh, hush. I suppose you’re hosting Christmas this year, Betty Crocker.”
Donnie stares out across the field, not meeting Dean’s eyes until Dean steps in front of him. He looks at Dean and rolls his eyes. “Okay, fine. Maybe there was a part of me that thought it might turn into more. I wasn’t looking for anything when we first hooked up, but I got used to you being around.”
His spirits lift every time he sees Dean’s name on the front of his phone, but it is always followed by crippling fear at how much a few words means to him. He takes to wearing one of the rubber bracelets again and snapping it every time he thinks about texting Dean back. The sting feels a hundred times worse after not feeling it for so long.
Charlie pours herself a coffee in the big Star Wars mug she bought in Rio last year. While Dean was in the hotel room stressing over his technique, Charlie had gone sightseeing with half the German team and a few Swedes. She dumps a long stream of sugar from the dispenser without measuring it and adds more flavored creamer. Dean’s teeth hurt just watching her. Every time John criticizes her diet, Charlie smiles sweetly and nods. Then she hits the Dairy Queen drive through on the way home.
Once everything is put away, Dean glances around for Ben’s backpack. It’s been pretty much ‘snag Ben and head home’ every day this week, but tonight he really doesn’t want to go. He’d rather snuggle up on the couch with Cas until he has to get Ben home for bed, but he’s sure that Cas has things to do. “So, ah, I guess we better get out of your hair,” he mutters, finally noticing Ben’s backpack on the little table by the door.
Once Dean closes the office door behind him, he can no longer hear the splashing from the pool or John’s voice barking directions at Charlie. He pulls up a few videos on the laptop—from this spring and last year—but watching himself on the screen is frustrating. What good is critiquing his form when he can’t even get in the water? Dean closes out of the video archive and pulls up Instagram. It auto logs him in, and he spends a few minutes posting pictures from the Arena Swim last weekend. Coming up with witty captions and hashtags takes longer than picking the photos.
The worst part is that he knows Meg is right. He knows that nothing happened between Dean and Ash and he knows that Dean loves him. He’s pushing Dean away because it’s easier than facing the fear that Ash is more important to Dean than he will ever be. Thirty years of shared experience is a lot to go up against.
Ash raises his hands in mock surrender. “Stand down, amigo. It was a joke,” he says. Although he appears to be trying to placate, the smirk is back and his tone is slightly challenging. Castiel gets the feeling once again that he is caught in the middle of a conversation he doesn’t understand.
This is wrong, Dean knows it. It doesn’t solve anything and Dean is still pissed about the way everything has gone down today. But it’s also so achingly familiar that Dean can’t force himself to stop. Ash kisses him again before shoving the door open and pulling him inside. He pushes the door closed behind them, effectively sealing out all of Dean’s better judgment.
Dean finds Cas on the porch with Benny’s youngest daughter curled up on his lap, Cas’ hand petting her thick black hair. Dean slips up behind him and presses a kiss to the top of his head. “Hey, babe. You about ready to call it a night?”
It seems so strange to be in this house, with the familiar smells and sounds, the same ceiling and walls he has stared at a thousand times, and know that his mother isn't just down the hallway. It’s unbelievable that he won’t walk down the stairs to breakfast and find her sitting in the dining room, nursing her second cup of coffee for the day even though the doctor told her to cut back on caffeine.
“He don’t need a shrink.” John’s jaw is set, and he bites the words out through clenched teeth. “He needs to get his shit straightened out so we can get back to work. Nationals are in two months, and at the rate we’re going, we might as well just forfeit now. There goes everything we’ve worked for.”
Cas’ smile is wide, lighting up his eyes as he leans in to press a kiss to Dean’s cheek. “That’s wonderful. I know that’s something you’ve always wanted.”
Jenny’s brow wrinkles in confusion.  “I don’t. My sister has a cat, but I live in an apartment where I’m not allowed to have animals.”
“Actually, yes, that’s, uh, that’s right. I accidentally gave you the mileage for a Honda Civic,” Carl bites out with a grimace, shooting a dirty look at Ben.
Castiel grits his teeth and refuses to rise to the bait, as he knows that Gabriel is intentionally trying to irritate him. He chances a peek at Kali and she is also determinedly ignoring Gabriel’s antics. Castiel wonders idly if a lifetime of tolerating Gabriel somehow equipped him for dealing with young Autistic children. He assumes, then, that he should be grateful that his brother is a pain in the ass.
It’s almost three times as large as the original sketch and only half painted, but it’s clearly him, lying stretched out in Cas’ bed. His face heats at the memories of what they’d done just after that. Though it’s only been barely two weeks, they haven’t managed to find themselves with enough alone time for a repeat. Dean is itching to try out the other toys he knows are hiding in Cas’ nightstand.
“We’re all done. There are no more presents. You opened them all,” Jess explains calmly. Her voice has taken on the nervous, questioning tone of someone who knows that a meltdown is imminent, but they have to try anyway.
“How do I fix it?” Ash’s voice is small and broken like a child. Even when they were kids, Ash was always the bold one, the one who seemed so much older than they were. Dean has never heard him sound like this; not even after his father died.
“I am happy. Am I doing something that makes you think I’m not happy?” Dean guides the car up the driveway and puts it in park. He turns off the engine before dropping the keys on the seat between them and turns toward Cas. In the dim light, he can see the unshed tears in Cas’ eyes. He reaches out and takes Cas’ hand, interlocking their fingers. “Talk to me, Cas. If I’m doing something wrong, you have to tell me, or I can’t fix it.”
Dean gives Cas a side eye when he snorts, and Cas quickly looks away. “Yeah, me too,” Dean says with a straight face. “That would have sucked.” Mack isn’t the sharpest guy Dean has ever met, but he’s so full of good spirit it’s hard to dislike him.
Dean smooths one hand over her hair. Their nightly routine in college had been curling up together to study or watch TV, and it’s a habit they’ve continued. Convincing John to let Dean live on campus hadn’t been easy, and he'd been even less thrilled when they moved out of their dorms into a shared off-campus apartment junior year. They know there’s nothing more to it than friendship and comfort, no matter how uncomfortable it makes John.
Dean’s eyes are wide, and he studies Cas for a long time before he sighs. “I don’t know, Cas. I can’t shake the feeling I’d be taking advantage of you.”
“Figured what we paid in parts and overhead on the garage, then I split it in half and took back what I already paid you in wages so that there is your share of what the garage cleared beyond what we woulda made without the job.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says with a tight smile when he climbs into the passenger seat after settling Ben in back. He reaches across the seat and Castiel meets him halfway, squeezing his hand lightly. “Thanks for doing this.”
Dean slips back into the house and returns with a camera, pulling the door shut behind him. Castiel notices that Dean is also wearing only socks, and he finds it oddly adorable. Castiel, Gabriel, and Kali place their cargo near the porch railing while Ben directs the three adults to crouch around the plastic figures. Dean mutters to himself and messes with the buttons on the top of the digital camera before snapping a few pictures.
“So I did what I’ve always done, exactly what my father wanted. At least, until my second semester. There was a fellow student in my American Literature class, Michael. He was, well, he wasn’t like anyone I’d ever met before. I didn’t really have any friends and I mostly kept to myself, but the first class he sat down beside me in the lecture hall and asked to borrow a pencil and a piece of paper because he hadn’t brought anything to class.” Cas stops and chuckles at the memory, raising his hand to play with the short hairs on the back of Dean’s neck.
“You were just a boy when John started you both down this path, and I turned a blind eye for a long time and told myself it was what you wanted.” She brushes her hand through his hair, letting her thumb trail along his cheekbone, and Dean chases the gentle touch. “I let John convince me to keep these videos from you and Sam because it was so painful to watch them myself. But it’s easy to see how wrong I was. You need to do what makes you happy, the same as she did.”
Fat chance. “I won’t,” Dean lies. “I just want to let my sponsors and the team know if there’s any chance.”
“Huh,” she says, putting her hand on his shoulder. “Good luck with that. I used to date a guy like Ash. Lots of mixed signals that kept me hanging around way longer than I should have. It caused all kinds of problems between me and Sam when we first started dating.”
Dinner is quiet. Ben is still subdued and it’s clear that the distress of the afternoon has taken its toll on him. He keeps Benson right beside him throughout dinner, occasionally leaning over to whisper something in the dog’s floppy ear. Every time he looks at the dog with wide, watery eyes, it makes Dean’s insides clench.
Household chores with Ash were always something they put off until one or the other finally got fed up and did them. The last dish in the cupboard or last pair of underwear was usually the tipping point. With Lisa, nothing Dean did was right anyway, so he tended to avoid doing chores with her. She left him a list and he finished it, end of story.
Dean bites his lip while Ben thinks it over, then nods slightly. “Okay, Mr. Novak. I’ll be right there. I won’t go anywhere else. I’ll go right there to those rocks and look at them while you and daddy decide.”
“Nah, they’ve just been friends forever,” she says, twisting the cap on her empty bottle repeatedly. “Got that old married couple vibe. If you’re going to make things right with him, you’re going to have to get past her. Seriously, dude, talk to him. With grown up words, not that grunting and half-baked innuendo you Neanderthals consider talking.”
“You're not going to the gym? Don’t skip out because of me,” Dean replies, turning the phone off and shoving it in his pocket. The mystery tune will have to wait.
He’d been so in love with Michael, with his charm and his quick wit and his generosity. Although he knew that his parents wouldn’t be thrilled when he came out, he couldn’t imagine that Michael wouldn’t be able to win them over, so Cas had brought him home for Christmas during their senior year. It was during the ensuing fight that the truth about his degree came out.  It was the last Christmas he’d spent at home until after his father died.
Dean takes the edge of the wrapping paper and carefully rips across the top of the package. Inside is a plain cardboard box. He pulls the last bits of paper away and lifts off the lid. There’s a moment of shocked silence, then a gasp.
Dean must sense the movement, because he pulls back, eyes wide as he tracks the way Cas’ tongue flicks out to clean between his fingers. “Holy fuck, Cas,” Dean breathes, and his softening cock twitches against Cas’.
There’s more laughter, but Dean can barely hear it over the rushing of blood in his ears. He sees Ava’s eyes go wide so he knows she heard it too. His hand clenches reflexively on Ben’s head. Everything in Dean tells him that it’s a bad idea, that he should just ignore them, but he can’t. Who the fuck do they think they are?
“I didn’t know you were coming. One of the guys has an in at a club downtown tonight. You should come out with us and round up some ladies.”
Castiel says nothing while Gabriel climbs into the backseat, grumbling the entire time as Kali holds the front seat forward for him. He waits until Kali is settled in the seat next to him, serenely ignoring Gabriel’s gripes, before turning the key in the ignition and gracing his brother with a response. “I happen to like my car, Gabriel. Not everything is about father.”
Once Ben is tucked into bed and Dean’s old guitar is back on the stand in his room, he pulls out the mahogany Martin. He hasn’t played it since New Year’s Eve, when his father had insisted he play Auld Lang Syne, but it’s too beautiful of an instrument to leave languishing in the closet. Dean runs through some chords, his fingers automatically strumming the opening to
“With Ben, with, just, with everything you need. You should go. You should go and when I’m better, it will be okay. I just need some time to get better.” The heat of Dean’s body pressing against him is making it hard to think, hard to remember why Dean shouldn’t be here.
“Yeah. Charlie came down and took some pictures of some of the cars we’ve done and is settin’ one up for us.”
As if his smile is infectious, Dean starts to smile and kisses Cas again, deepening the kiss until Cas almost forgets where they are.
, then sends Benny a text to let him know everything is okay with a promise to fill him in tomorrow.
Dean takes another step, the water lapping at his collarbone, and reaches for Castiel as he coasts past. His fingertips skim Castiel’s arm. “You sound like Sam and Charlie.”
Dean bites back a bitter laugh. “Yeah, he said I could, but I can’t. I mean, I’m allowed to, but I freak out every time I try to get in the water.”
“Ew, gross, Dean, enough. Go find Cas and forget I said anything.” Sam’s mouth screws up like he swallowed something foul.
Dean chuckles. “Not tonight. I gotta get home before my dad sends out a search party and I wanna do this right. I wanna take you out on a date and hold your hand in the car and kiss you goodnight at the door.”
Castiel narrows his eyes. With the house paid off, his salary is more than enough to live on comfortably. He knows that Dean goes to work before Ben leaves for school in the morning and he often works late enough that they miss the parent night. The thought of Dean working so hard to support them and still not being able to buy the things he needs makes Castiel sad.
Dean would like to knock him on his ass for that, but he figures that would be a bad way for Cas to get a car. “How about a test drive?” he says cheerfully instead.
Castiel and Meg had picked up Juliet the day before Gabriel arrived and they were inseparable for the duration of Gabriel’s three-week stay. While Castiel was at work, Gabriel walked the dog and puttered around the house. At night, Juliet would curl up in Gabriel’s lap while the brothers talked in a way they never had before. As horrific as the altercation with Malachi had been, Castiel welcomed the opportunity to become closer to his brother that it had triggered.
When Dean returns from the men’s room the woman is still standing at the bar, her back to him. Dean steps up beside her and raises his hand to flag down Natalie. When she drops the beer in front of him, the woman turns, her blue eyes skipping over his face to something behind him. Dean would bet that twenty he just lost that she’s looking at Jo.
“Are you going to kiss?” Ben repeats, sucking another mouthful of cocoa through his straw before digging out a marshmallow with his fingers and popping it into his mouth. “You said that you and Cas might kiss sometimes, but you don’t, so I was just wondering if you were going to finally kiss now.”
Juliet is dancing around the door still barking when Cas reaches it. Expecting Meg, he doesn’t bother to look through the peephole before shoving Juliet away and yanking it open. The admonishment dies on his tongue as soon as he sees who is standing there. Decidedly not Meg. He silences Juliet with a firm command.
Dean’s fingers skate across three lines of strange markings resting on Cas’ abdomen, just to the inside of his left hip. “And this one?”
Dean looks around the bright, friendly space in confusion. “You’re taking me to an art gallery?” Definitely something he’d never done before.
The rest of the evening passes in a blur. He mingles and talks with people, Dean always at his side. When the constant barrage of patrons wanting to shake his hand becomes too much, Dean whisks him away to the back hallway to allow him to catch his breath for a few moments. By the end of the evening, he has sold four paintings and Dean has taken down the contact information for two people who want to discuss commissions. His head is spinning.
“Don’t be silly,” Aaron exclaims. “Jump in and we’ll swing by your car and grab his booster so you can all go. It’s important that the car works for the whole family.”
Ben and Cas are already set up in the living room when Dean comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn and drinks. Ben is in the middle of the couch, but Cas has taken the seat on the far end that Dean has come to think of as Cas’ spot. The smile that breaks is so wide that Cas looks at him strangely as he sits down.
Ben slips his hand into Castiel’s and he forces himself to focus on his student, the reason he’s here. Though spending time with Dean is an added bonus, it was really the desire to watch Ben experience something he so clearly loves that prompted him to accept the invitation. Dean takes Ben’s other hand and they start toward the gift shop.
“I’ll call you back,” he says, cutting off the call with Gabriel mid-whine. “How much of that did you hear?”
Dean wants to argue, but he knows Ash is right. They need to get back inside, if only to do damage control. He puts his hand on top of Ash’s and squeezes. “Okay, yeah.”
Dean scoffs. “Winchester Restorations. Might be gettin’ a little ahead of yourself there. We don’t even know if he likes it yet.”
“You really should join us in the twenty-first century, Castiel. The grunge era is over,” Balthazar throws back, stretching his arms over his head. His movements cause Meg to roll more firmly onto his lap, but she doesn’t react.
The photographers shift them to the other side of the women and Cas takes the opportunity to mutter, “I get the feeling your friendliness gets you in trouble.”
“You should volunteer for the Secret Santa day,” Candace is saying, pulling Dean’s attention back to her. Her hand is resting on Dean’s forearm though he was so caught up in Cas that he didn’t register her touching him. “Jolene and I are volunteering. We’d love to have you there.”
Cas must read the tension in his body because he tries to drop Dean’s hand. Dean won’t let him. He holds on tighter, pulling Cas in so they’re standing pressed together as he turns to face his friend. Maybe it’s for the best. With Mack’s love of gossip, everyone in the swimming world will know everything going on with Dean within minutes of Mack walking away. As effective as doing a press release.
“Well, you’re pulling it off smashingly, darling. The dark circles really bring out the blue in your eyes.”
, Dean thinks indignantly. He isn’t sure how he expects Cas to handle the situation, but the approach Cas takes certainly isn’t one of the options.
A brief shadow passes behind Dean’s eyes. “It was good. I mean, things have been goin’ real good. Smooth, ya know? ‘Til today. I really screwed up, Cas.” Dean sighs deeply, then relates the events of the morning. “I just lost it, man. I really try not to yell, ‘cause I know it freaks him out, but I lost my shit. I even cursed at him. I always hated when my old man swore at us, but it was like all I could think about is how I work so hard and he just fucked it up and made more work for me. There’s always more work.”
took him and Billie, all he was left with was the echoes of what he'd said, the reverberation of what he'd done, reflected back at him and ringing in his ears. All he was left with was the dark and the cold and a restless sleep, of which consisted a facsimile of what he perceived the world to be.
circled him slowly, like a predator assessing it's prey's next move. "I'll admit, I wasn't expecting to see you so soon. You are one stubborn angel."
Dean walked hesitantly up to the desk, cleared his throat and said "Chief." The man looked up and immediately broke into a smile. "James! What can I do for you?" Dean gave a small smile and replied, "I was just wondering if I could take a couple weeks leave?" He hoped to high hell that he could at least get a week. "You sick boy?" He looked Dean up and down, as if assessing his health. "Uh, no Chief. It's a bit of a family emergency."
Snuggled tightly against his chest is a sleeping Cas, and they fit together like pieces of a puzzle.
The funeral is held a few days later, at the top of a small hill overlooking the sea. The weather doesn't seem to match their mood, the sun shining mockingly at them. Although, she supposes, that's just what he would've wanted. In his will, Dean stated he wanted to be buried next to his old army friend on that hill. Everyone thought it a strange request, but said nothing over it, too consumed with grief. Maisie guessed though, he wanted to be buried next to his lover. Perhaps he thought it would help reunite them in the afterlife, or perhaps he just really loved the guy.
He still, every day, misses Cas with his entire being, but there's not much he can do about that. He accepted a long time ago that he's not coming back and Jack's not going to just pop him back on earth
She looks expectantly at him. "You're probably wondering why you're here and why I've set this all up." She nods an affirmative and gestures for him to continue. "Jess, we've known each other for almost five years now and Jess, my feelings for you have only grown." Her smile widens and she opens her mouth to speak, but he interrupts. "Jess, I like you a lot." She grins and says, "I like you a lot too, Sam." His smile couldn't be convinced to turn upside down for anything. "Just so we're clear, not platonically right?" She laughs and replies, "Yes of course,
When the song comes on, it starts out as a sort of locker-sounding door closing and then it gets into the beat. Dean can't deny that the song has him hooked, the beat and the lyrics.
Fuck! Sam's being a bitch, saying there's nothing we can do. Fucking Jack isn't answering any prayers.
Cas. 'Cause he can do that now, just look, unabashedly, fully. And no one would care because they knew, all of them, how in love they were.
"I'll save up. I'll save up and come up there to visit you." No one is going to tear him away from Cas and he is always going to fight the assholes trying their best to do it. Cas smiles sweetly at him and says, "I'd like that." He leans in to give him a much needed hug.
rough night filled with alcohol and bad decisions, which Dean would know about, or has had a fight with his dad. "You okay?" Dean turns a concerned look on his best friend. Cas simply shakes his head and says, "I'm alright, I just don't feel like going." Okay, what now? "Who are you and what have you done with Castiel Novak?" Cas just shrugs and blushes, turning to face the window. "I just want to spend some time with you, okay."
he stops as he sees Dean, but instead of being embarrassed, he smiles wide and pauses the song. "Dean!" Dean smiles back and moves to stand inside the room. "Hey buddy, what you listening to?" Cas' smile gets bigger and he replies, "Melanie Martinez! Her music is truly good! And she sometimes sings about real issues going on in the world and-" Dean can sense a rampage coming on and he intends to stop him right there, but he just looks so
A rustle, sounds of scrambling, and then a second someone was plonking themselves next to Charlie on the window seat. "Too much noise?" The newcomer asks, turned to look at Charlie with a lopsided smile.
It makes a bit of sense, considering Sam's excitement over the phone and his slip of 'someone'. And Jack has got to have at least
For making that stupid deal in the first place. But he couldn't really stay mad at him, he never could.
Dean had just been about to get some coffee from the bunker's kitchen when he heard it. A carousel sort of tune rang out through the bunker and Dean was utterly confused by it. Why on earth was there a carousel noise in the bunker? And why was it coming from Cas' room? And then he heard it- lyrics. A woman was singing along to the carousel-sounding tune.
Dean had loved Cas for almost as long as he'd known him, even if he hadn't realised it until later years, and he never once thought Cas reciprocated. He always thought angels couldn't feel things- emotions- like humans could, Cas himself had said so.
Sam and Jess were the best of friends, have been ever since they were eleven. But recently, Sam had been developing feelings for his best friend. He thought that he had read the signals correctly that said she felt the same way, and tonight he was going to make a move on them.
Cas' face suddenly goes all sad and he frowns. "About that.." He finally turns and makes eye contact with him. Dean frowns too now and turns to fully face him. "Just drive, I'll tell you on the way." Dean knows he's stalling, but he complies and starts the car again and backs out the driveway, onto the road. "Anywhere in particular?" Dean asks, but he has a suspicion he already knows where Cas wants to go. "To our usual spot."
She hopes Novak can rest easier now he has his other half. After everyone leaves, she walks up to the headstones, touches them both and says, "I hope you're both at peace. Rest easy. I love you." she then walks away, tears sliding silently down her face.
I moved in, the place is quite sweet- if not a bit lonely- with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a small living room and kitchen. Kinda looking forward to having my own kitchen.
She can see his mind has drifted off to past times. It’s getting late and she needs to get back home if she wants to get enough rest for work tomorrow. She gets up, “I’ll come back tomorrow, ok?” He breaks out of his staring match with the window and looks at her. “Sure, Maise.” He gives her a small smile and goes back to staring out the window. She smiles back and walks out, back to her car.
me?" Dean blushes and looks away again. "Uh, yes? Maybe, I-" but he doesn't get a chance to finish that sentence before Cas is crashing into him and kissing him fervently. "I like you too Dean." He says with a huge smile on his face.
Dean grins back and allows his hand to be taken and dragged into Cas' room. "Let's listen to more songs! And then maybe we can 'fool around' later on." Dean's eyes widen and he swallows, mouth suddenly dry, but doesn't protest and follows him.
"Jess! You look wonderful, come in." He steps aside to let a blushing Jess in. She smiles at him and quietly thanks him. He shuts the door and leads her straight into the dining room, where everything is set up. He waits nervously by the doorway while she takes everything in.
Thank you to anyone who left kudos and read not only this fic, but also the whole series! I really appreciate it!
It's been a long day, but it is a Thursday and Maisie has to see him. So she drives out to Ocean Elderly Home. She checks in with the secretary and a nurse leads her to a small room right at the back of the Home, the one with the best view of the ocean. The nurse, Meg, leads her to the door and then leaves. She stands at the door frame, just taking in the room. It’s a small, but spacious room. Filled by a single bed in the middle of the back wall, a small bedside table holding a lamp, a small dresser against the right wall and a tiny wardrobe against the wall next to the door. Across the room from the dresser, is a huge singular window that takes up most of the wall, complete with a window seat. In front of the window is a set of chairs, in which one is occupied by a man with light grey hair and bright green eyes, gazing out the window.
all his prayers about bringing Cas back. Dean doesn't see why he would come down to earth, after months of m.i.a, and
listen to them because you were the one asking, but I actually do enjoy them. They're really good songs Cas." Cas brightens at that, but gives him a confused look. "But why didn't you listen to them when Sam asked?" Dean gulps and Sam snickers. "I- uh, well-" Sam smiles wide and leaves before he can be victim to any more glares Dean is throwing his way.
Just please come back. I know you're not gone, not really. You wouldn't do that. Not to me. So just come back.
Which is why he never ends up telling Cas he loves him, not when they're sitting shoulder to shoulder under the dim light from the shade. Not when they're throwing one last get together with their friends before he leaves. Not when he kisses Cas one last time before he drives home alone, tears welling up in his eyes as he desperately tries to think about anything other than he might never see him again. And not even when he's hugging him goodbye at the gates of the airport, waving farewell at him while he walks away from Dean and everything they have, albeit unwillingly.
Sam startles, like he forgot they were still standing in the doorway, and steps aside to let Dean in.
He thinks Melanie's songs will always have a special place in his heart, if it weren't for Cas loving her songs so much then perhaps Dean never would've had the courage to tell Cas.
He stares out the vast green garden, at the colourful flowers dotting it. At the brilliant blue ocean and the even bluer sky above it. He looks at the sun, so bright his eyes can’t bare to look at it for too long. He almost laughs, just like him. He was so bright, full of light and love. He decides the sun is him, looking down at him and smiling brightly. He smiles back.
The next story I'm going to be telling is about my two closest friends, who I am happy to say are still my best friends to this day.
"So, Jack, are you going to be staying here for a while?" Jack smiled brightly and replied, "I'd love to stay here, if that's alright with you guys." Eileen smiled back and said, "Of course, I know Sam would be delighted to have you here." she then looked at him, "And you? Will you stay here too?" Cas smiles, pleased to be welcomed into their home, and signs back a "Yes".
Sam and Eileen are getting married in about a month!! I'm best man, of course and– surprisingly (or not)– Charlie is best woman!
Dean switched his phone screen off and put it in his pocket, he'd answer as soon as he knew when. He took a deep breath and knocked on the office door. Dean had been working at the fire station for almost a year now and he had never once asked for leave. But Sammy said he just
