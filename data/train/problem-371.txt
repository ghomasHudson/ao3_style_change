“Don’t waste time, go. They’re near,” my patient wheezed. “Put… two cartridges... into my pistol. One for the enemy. One for me.”
The main bedroom did not disappoint our expectations in its grandeur, dominated by a massive four-poster bed. That night, our little adventure affected John in a most agreeable way: he had me so vigorously that I clutched the velveteen sheets and moaned his name at the top of my voice, unafraid to be overheard.
“On the contrary, Mrs. Langley, you have been truly brave,” Holmes assured her. “Despite your fear, you didn’t stay silent. I must commend you on your method of communication. It was rather ingenious.”
“I suspect that some of them won’t show up again. They’d rather pay more to my neighbour than risk being associated with me,” I said with a shrug.
The side street was squalid and quite deserted. It often amazed me how one could find himself in the underworld just having turned round the corner of some grand London thoroughfare. I could feel Swinsby ogling my posterior as we went, and that alone made me yearn for a thorough bathing once this charade was over. The current situation was my own fault: had I not been so irresponsible, Holmes wouldn’t have taken the case and I wouldn’t have been constrained to endure the company of this detestable personage. Thankfully, the brothel was only a few yards away, and then Holmes would emerge and do whatever was necessary for his plan to succeed—
“They must have been following me as I was walking back to Baker Street. Taunton Mews is often deserted even in broad daylight, so they took advantage of that,” John said.
1) The fact that Holmes was no match for Moran in a hand-to-hand fight and that Watson described him “thinner and keener than of old” received a bit of elaboration here.
John grunted, bending his arm and exposing his wrist. A mischievous smile touched his lips as he regarded the bracelet.
Bloody hell, he’s wearing his hubby’s nightshirt. Could you two be more cute? Also, these Victorian nightshirts are so damn sexy, especially considering that nothing was worn underneath.
Peaceful and healthy routine, really—like sleeping in, regular meals, regular walks in open air, regular sex. Also, the diversity of Holmes’s interests never ceases to amaze me. A comparative analysis of a Celtic and a Semitic languages? Why the hell not? Piece of cake. But of course all Watson’s efforts were ruined when a case found them even there.
I was seized with despair. The very thing I had strived to avoid by removing myself from Baker Street had come to pass. Holmes needed me, but so did all those people. This was not an occasion I could simply drop everything. Stamford, who peeped out of the tent at the sound of the commotion, only nodded as our eyes met. Bless the man.
Long hours passed in anticipation, and while I tried to busy myself with reading and writing, my thoughts would wander off to the recent chain of events. Finally, Holmes came back. The twinkle had disappeared from his eyes, replaced by steely resolve. He cast off the wig, the false beard, and the rest of his disguise until he remained in his shirt-sleeves and trousers. His brow furrowed, he sank onto the sofa. My instincts told me that his quest had not been fruitless, and yet he had a chagrined air about him.
“Perhaps that explains how this secret refuge came to Mycroft’s attention,” I replied. “He is a man of the city and cares for the charms of the countryside no more than I do.”
“I have a message for you from Rache,” the boy said in a low voice. “The Bar of Gold, Upper Swandam Lane.”
“It shall not be a duel, but an execution,” Moriarty continued. “Your life for Watson’s, as you proposed.”
That was a serious development. The stranger in my surgery was dangerous to associate with, and the consequences for me could be rather bleak, from an interrogation at best to being imprisoned at worst. Still, having once taken him in for treatment, I couldn’t just throw him out.
“Tut, tut,” Mycroft replied in that infuriatingly dispassionate tone of his, so familiar to me since my childhood. “The doctor’s grief is safer for you both and most convincing for others. He burned your will in the presence of the solicitor, by the way. Said he didn’t want anything in benefit from it and that he would rather your possessions went to me.”
Sleep eludes me. In such cases I used to busy myself with chemical researches or updating my indexes or whatever past time came to mind—it’s easy to focus on the task at hand when the house and the street outside are perfectly quiet as they can only be in the middle of the night. I used to spend nights and nights in the sitting-room while I could be in bed, embracing the sleeping John. How I reproached myself for my stupidity during those endless three years we were apart. And now, feeling his body against mine and listening to his deep breath, I wouldn’t leave our bed for the world. There is much to do in my brain-attic. I can analyse past cases and compare them with the current ones or inventory my knowledge and skills in different spheres, marking which require refreshing and which can be forgotten.
The Old Ones wage wars between themselves, but it is us they send to fight for their ambitions. So it was for centuries, ever since they came from the fathomless depths and invaded the lands of men. Men lost the Great War, and now they are doomed to kill each other whenever the Old Ones order it. The war in Afghanistan was no exception. Amidst the savagery of the Maiwand battlefield, I gazed into the abyss of primordial darkness living deep in the caves of Tora Bora our troops were to conquer. Damaged irretrievably, I was invalided out with two unwelcome mementoes: a crippled leg and a pervasive sense of terror which could be kept at bay during daytime but was inescapable at night. My surgeon’s hand was still steady, though, and the wound compensation was enough to establish a practice in London upon my return.
But eventually we had our reward for all the difficulties. The beach was covered with fine shingles stretching towards the horizon, waves lapping at the shore and shimmering in the sun. Several fishing-boats were tiny specks far away on the sea. At the base of the cliffs there was a curious maze of shallow caves and grottos, and the shoreline curved near some of them, forming natural swimming-pools.
The man didn’t seem to believe any of it. He made a move to grab me by the arm and drag me out forcibly, but at that moment the door to my consulting-room creaked open.
In the past, during the nine years of my self-imposed celibacy, I had used cocaine to subdue my baser instincts. The drug had been rather effective if detrimental to my health in the long run. But now I had John. As soon as he would come home my torment would be over, and satisfaction would be all too sweeter after such yearning. I kept repeating it to myself, growing more and more restless. At last, when my nerves were about to snap, I heard the hall door bang and the familiar steps climb the stairs.
Having consumed Mrs. Hudson’s delicious breakfast, we took our carpet-bags and strolled to the gymnasium, enjoying the crisp morning air. It was a good warm-up before our vigorous exercise. Keeping fit requires diligence as one gets older, so we sparred until we were drenched in sweat and flushed with exertion. I had to restrain myself not to ogle Holmes with his hair askew, his nostrils flaring and his cheeks coloured, his damp shirt clinging to his chest… At the same time, his gaze travelled along my body, titillating me. That was the usual peril of our training together. Ever since our reunion we found it a bit too difficult to be discreet in such instances.
“One of the vilest of their kind. I first encountered George Saville in February of this year in Paris, when his accomplice Émile Henry hurled a bomb into the Café Terminus.”
Muffled voices were coming from the parlour. I hadn’t expected another onslaught of emotions upon hearing them. Mrs. Hudson, Jenny, and Billy were having tea. I left my valise in the hall, trod softly, and peered through the half-opened door. Jenny had remained almost the same: merry and good-natured as ever, she was sharing the latest piece of gossip. There was more white in Mrs. Hudson’s hair, but she was hale and energetic, the Scottish shrewdness of her comments still unparalleled. Billy had grown visibly, from a skinny tadpole into a lively adolescent. It was he who noticed me first and dropped his cup on the table with a loud clatter. Jenny shrieked at the top of her lungs while Mrs. Hudson stared at me and then started to cackle.
He captured my mouth and kissed me roughly, demandingly until I was breathless and so hard it was maddening.
In a fight that ensued the young man was killed by accident, and both the criminal partner and the older brother escaped from the train. In Bert Coules’ adaptation the partner was so distraught that he shot himself while in ACD’s story he says the following:
“My practice is sold,” John said with a satisfied smile. “What am I to do next? Perhaps write stories again?”
“Thank you, Doctor,” Mycroft said dryly after I had finished. “The memorial service shall take place tomorrow at ten o’clock. I have arranged for a four-wheeler to be sent for you.”
“Certainly, certainly. Oh, Mr. Holmes, always takes matters to heart a bit too much.” Lestrade sighed sympathetically and hurried off to hail a cab.
He listened carefully as I described how Rance and Stamford had brought him to my surgery and that had it not been for Stamford’s assistance, he wouldn’t be there now.
Holmes left with renewed energy while I went to the bathroom, whistling. My fatigue had disappeared, replaced by tingling joy. I took my time to prepare myself thoroughly. Water was pleasant as it poured inside me, warming me up, and then I released it, becoming clean for my Holmes so that he could do with me anything he wished. I was at a half-stand just musing about it. Before we had consummated our love, I hadn’t had a slightest idea how enjoyable I would find intimacy with a man. I had experimented by stimulating my prostate with my fingers but could never imagine I would crave being fucked. Sherlock taught me that, as he himself loves immensely being filled with cock.
“I’m sorry about the children, but had I succeeded, the end would have justified the means. Others shall come in my stead,” Saville cried, losing his composure. “This government must fall! The monarchy must fall, for it has outlived its usefulness. It treats its finest people as canon-fodder and idolises such fools as General Gordon—”
The next day John was glowing, and some colour had returned to his countenance. It warmed my heart endlessly that he was showing signs of recovery which, I hoped, would be steady with the passage of time.
“In fact, you won’t have to pretend much,” I pressed on. “Go to the officers’ club, say that you used to serve with the Colonel—which is true—and lend your ear to someone gossipy. You’re an excellent listener, John, and you have a natural gift: people like you.”
He helped me back to my feet, looking frantically around. His gaze stopped at a niche in the wall filled with empty boxes. He led me to that niche, seated me on one of the boxes, and stacked the rest so that I was hidden from view.
“Have modern conveniences installed, to begin with,” I replied in kind. “Bringing water from the well and heating it is a back-breaking job when one fancies having a bath. The way some upper-class people exploit their servants is ghastly. A good sewage system would also be necessary, of course. The small lumber-room at the very end of the hall could be transformed into a water closet while the empty room next to the large bedroom could become a fine bathroom. There is enough space for a full-length bath, and it wouldn’t be cramped as our bathroom at Baker Street, for example.”
We did need a country vacation. Begrudgingly, I came to admit that. Fresh air would benefit John’s complexion and both our shredded nerves. Besides, John’s birthday was nearing. Only an elaborate costume allowed me to run about in search of a gift.
There was no sense in the usual course of things anymore. My practice which I had struggled to buy first and then to develop was but a shell of normalcy now, a veneer to maintain. My writing? Pointless. The lights had gone out in my life.
We wired our assent, and a carriage arrived for us that same evening, so we had to pack swiftly. John’s eyes sparkled with excitement as we rattled out of town at breakneck speed, heading south in the thickening twilight through Brixton, West Norwood, and Croydon. From there the carriage turned sharply east and proceeded for many miles until turning south again. We peered through the windows, but it was difficult to make out any clear landmarks amidst the farms and fields shrouded in the darkness. I reckoned we had crossed the western border of Kent, and John confirmed my conjectures.
Goodness, the beauty of Holmes and Watson’s relationship in this story! This time the Canon is gayer than the Granada adaptation: Watson panicked so much at the news of Holmes’s injury that he didn’t pay for the newspaper (in the Granada he did).
“John, my work should be completed by May,” I said, focusing after a momentary relapse. “The closer I get to them, the more dangerous it is for those dearest to me. This flat is becoming unsafe, so I have already made some provisions. Mrs. Hudson shall visit her sister in Kent, and Jenny and Billy shall have leave for a fortnight. You shall move to Mycroft’s, for his rooms are under government protection, and you shall keep your revolver with you at all times.”
On Christmas Day we slept until afternoon, for the following night would be a long one. Judging by delicious smells from downstairs which woke us up, Mrs. Hudson had returned and was preparing a festive dinner for the Irregulars. We had gifts for them too: good winter clothes to keep them warm and ensure that none caught cold. When the clamorous squad arrived, they reported to Holmes excitedly the results of their mission. They had located every member of Saville’s anarchist group and informed Lestrade, as per Holmes’s directions. It pleased Holmes very much, and the dinner we had all together was delightful.
“Our names won’t tell you anything,” Holmes said. “But you have something we’re after. I know where it is, and you’ll come with us at once. If you’re considering running away, remember, I have a lovely picture of you.”
“The squire is indeed a congenial neighbour,” he said. “I borrowed a couple of bicycles from The Gables. They are in the garden shed.”
’s passing, and you vowed never to be so vulnerable, didn’t you? You’ve never been intimate with anyone.”
Now I was sliding my fingers inside him back and forth, mindful not to touch his prostate while coaxing him to open up more. Sherlock moaned and hummed, his cheeks flushed. I leaned forward and wrapped my lips around his prick—I still hadn’t learned to receive all of him without an onset of reflex gagging, so I sucked the head and took in as much as I could, frigging the rest of his length with my other hand. Sherlock moaned louder as he clutched fistfuls of the sheets. He bent his legs and raised them, whining, utterly debauched.
Holmes tries to reason with him that this is the only way, and given the circumstances, it is justified. It’s clear that both Holmes and Watson are of alike mind regarding the law—that it is to be followed, but it’s not always fair, and can be broken at dire circumstances. Indeed, Holmes is lucky to have such a companion who shared his views.
I had to prepare myself, for personal cleanliness is always of paramount importance, especially when it comes to intimacy. It was necessary. I pulled the skirts of my dressing-gown together to conceal my improper state and made for the bathroom. The newly installed water heater was a blessing, worth every penny it had required. Indeed, it would have been rather awkward to ask Mrs. Hudson for hot water.
When our relationship had transitioned from platonic to physical, at first he had preferred being taken. Soon, however, he had come to enjoy the reverse role as much, moved by my vulnerability and unconditional trust. His caring for me has no bounds. Being the only man I have ever had, he taught me same-sex love practices, and we keep exploring each other. Our closeness makes it easy to experiment and try new things. It is a most fascinating journey.
He’s absolutely heartbroken when he learns of the tragedy, to the point that nothing except avenging his client can be on his mind. Watson handles the news much better in comparison:
However, which room Watson left before coming to Holmes’s room? The towel suggests that it was either bathroom OR that second room intended for him:
My other patients were gaping and talking excitedly in hushed tones. I asked them to return another day or to go to my neighbour. Ushered to the door by the constable, they began to clear out reluctantly, grumbling, for the physician next door charged more than I.
. The flow of incoming correspondence made us wonder if it would be necessary to hire a secretary. On one occasion, we were mobbed in Kensington Gardens when we sneaked out for a stroll. I realised that in the observable future I wouldn’t be able to work discreetly without a disguise.
“What sort of a coaching establishment?” I asked, peering at the magnificent turrets with sharp spires.
“Your colleague was away today, I take it,” Sherlock remarked, ringing the bell to have his place laid.
This story is set in 1898 (or 1899, according to different sources) and was published in 1926/7, so Holmes and Watson can be considered a long-married couple by then. What I love about the text is that Watson’s admiration of Holmes is ever present, even though they’ve been together for years. In Bert Coules BBC Radio Dramatisation Watson comes off as jaded and long-suffering which frankly spoiled the pleasure for me although the adaptation is superb. Unlike the radio drama characterisation, Watson of the Canon is always eager to help Holmes however whimsical Holmes’s requests might be. So when Holmes asks Watson to go and investigate a trivial-looking client, Watson replies:
I couldn’t believe my ears. Of course, Mycroft didn’t think much of John, considering him merely an indulgence of my baser needs, a pretty face. He hadn’t expected our relationship to last and hadn’t met John until we had been together for several years. Yet cruelty wasn’t in my brother’s nature.
I caressed his cheek. We kissed again, and then I had to pull back and get up. Obliging him in this delicate matter pleased me. It marked how close we were: being as self-reliant as he was, he didn’t shy away from asking this of me. After years spent in self-imposed isolation, now he yearned to be touched and loved when I tended to him.
Holmes and Watson do take on the case and solve it successfully. Some details differ from the short story, but the essentials are the same.
As for Wilde/Bosie and Raffles/Bunny, Wilde is actually Bunny in everything but the looks and the age. Wilde is brilliant, of course, which is more Raffles-like. On the other hand, Wilde adored Bosie beyond measure in spite of (or maybe because of?) Bosie’s character, forgave much, and indulged Bosie’s whims while he could. Wilde eagerly submitted himself to Bosie’s will, not the other way around. Like Bunny, Wilde went to prison. (Well, Bosie did too, but that was another story altogether, and long after Wilde).
Holmes took out the keys, and we entered through a narrow side door. Being thus constrained to hide, having driven under veil of night across the whole city to this crude shelter in order to just be ourselves, didn’t depress me in the least. On the contrary, it aroused me even more. The blood pounded in my veins, heat flooding my lower belly as I followed my Holmes along the maze of dark, dingy corridors. His hand was quivering, gripping mine tightly; he was as tense with pent-up desire. While we could only dream of living openly, of our union being acknowledged and respected, not persecuted, in the existing circumstances our love life certainly didn’t lack excitement.
There’s the same devotion and respect of privacy in Watson and Holmes’s relationship. When Holmes is absorbed in the case, Watson doesn’t disturb him in spite of being curious but waits for Holmes to open up himself. Watson is a very patient man. It’s a rare quality which Holmes undoubtedly valued in his Watson, and it must have been one of the traits which made Watson so dear to him:
I clutched John to my heart’s content, knowing that he didn’t mind my post-coital clinginess, that he in fact enjoyed it. There was only our mingled heavy breathing and the musky, acrid scent of our release. As we exchanged sloppy kisses, John was getting boneless in my embrace. It was time to tuck him into bed.
It was only half past ten, so the Colonel and I reminisced about our army days, sipping whiskey and water. The Colonel’s manner was perfectly unassuming, but for some reason I had a persistent feeling of discomfort. Perhaps it was the way he looked at me. The easy camaraderie with which he spoke was belied by the simmering passion of his intent gaze. Nothing untoward was happening, and yet being alone with him seemed wrong. After a while I couldn’t stand it and expressed my intent to turn in early. The Colonel’s face fell.
In the distance there were a few other soldiers loitering around and striking up conversations with passers-by. A young corporal, a fresh-faced lad, was having a lively chat with a trim, fashionable civilian about thirty. The man was clean-shaven; he had curled fair hair, languid brown eyes, an upturned fleshy nose, and a sensual mouth. His smouldering gaze seemed to be undressing his companion as they spoke. The dandy perfectly matched the description Holmes had given me.
The truth was excruciating; it left me gasping for air like a fish thrown ashore. Being involved with me had brought so much suffering into John’s life. I had only wished to protect him—and I had—but at what cost? I had hurt the one closest and dearest to me, hurt him almost to the point of his breaking. And, despite all of this, he had forgiven me.
So basically, Holmes receives all the necessary data from Watson, forms a theory, and then goes to France because the time is ripe—there the paths of Watson and Green would intersect, and Holmes just has to wait a little, which he does. If Holmes indeed said that Watson did nothing, it would be teasing, not scolding in earnest. Whenever Watson was
1) It is generally considered that Milverton’s case was well after Reichenbach, but I tend to agree with the Lenfilm version because there are some hints in the Canon which support
instead of the expected Christmas-themed story, hit me like a bolt out of the blue. John was severing the ties. There would be no further instalments. He presented to the world his version of my demise, having expanded and fictionalised the newspaper article he had written in ‘91 while he was still believing me to be dead.
“His coping method? You… you brute!” I cried, tempted to tear the coffee-cup from Mycroft and smash it.
Some hours must have passed. It was a sense of terrible nausea that brought me to consciousness. I rose, tore off the collar which was smothering me, and staggered to the water closet. My legs gave out in front of the lavatory. My knees painfully hit the tiled floor. I hadn’t had any food since morning, so what came up was mostly bile. I hadn’t been that sick for over ten years, not since the time before meeting Sherlock, when I had been adrift and alone. Now I was adrift and alone again.
I had never had any resentment towards Mycroft, but at that moment I did. I loathed his business-like tone and his cold aloofness which didn’t differ from his usual bearing in the slightest. If he was hiding his grief, he was doing very well indeed, for there was no sign of it. His younger brother was dead, and the man was left alone in the whole world, for God’s sake! His conduct convinced me that whatever nonsense I had written about Sherlock’s being an emotionless machine, it was actually true about Mycroft Holmes. While Sherlock had merely taken on that mantle to protect himself, Mycroft seemed truly heartless.
“I have,” he replied, the pensive expression of his eyes softening. “Are you game for a walk and sparring after breakfast?”
As if reading my thoughts, John went still; his hands released my wrists and slipped down to frame my face. Panting, he gazed at me, his blue eyes intense and his cheeks flushed. The sensation of him within me, of our connection, was endlessly comforting. I was safe and loved. He leaned down, and his lips touched mine gently, reverently, in stark contrast to his ardour just a few moments ago. His tongue claimed my mouth, making love, not ravishing. When our lips parted, John resumed his pace slowly. Ever the romantic, he seemed to have forgotten our little game. I smiled at him and pinched his buttock, encouraging him to go faster. He grinned back impishly and pulled out.
Having retired to the guest room, I thought of her and Lestrade, of their support given in spite of their own grief. Unlike ten years ago, I wasn’t completely alone after all.
“We must split, John,” I said as we sat in our suite in Strasbourg. “You go to Baden or Karlsruhe, and I shall proceed on to Geneva.”
Having alighted, I tipped my hat at Parker the garrotter who was loitering on the corner. Moran’s henchmen must have spotted me already at the station, for I had returned proudly as myself. Parker scurried away, followed by my laughter.
“Not really, no, sir. At the memorial service ‘e was terrifyin’ to look upon, so pale I thought ‘e was ‘bout to faint. Then I’ve been to Mrs. ‘udson’s. She said ‘e was drinkin’ loike a fish, shut in upstairs. Quit makin’ ‘is rounds—‘is colleague takes care of ‘is patients. The boys ‘eard that ‘e thrashed a reporter who followed ‘im, and Inspector Lestrade hushed it up.”
Moriarty clearly wanted to instill dread by informing me of his proximity. Instead of a sudden and deadly move he was playing a cat-and-mouse game. Fleeing in panic would be indulging him, and that I wasn’t going to do.
That was one of the major changes I now came to observe in him. He had been better than me at expressing emotions, but now it was as if something within him shut down and wouldn’t let him speak. The pipe had obviously reminded him of me during our separation. I assured him that I didn’t mind in the least and that it was as much his as it was mine.
I took the whistle from John’s pocket. The police forces answered our summons at once, led by Lestrade. The inspector reassured himself of my belonging to the realm of the living much in the same way Billy had. Once I had had the last word with Colonel, who was seething with cold fury, I expected that I would feel triumphant. But I found no emotion stirring in my soul, none whatsoever. There was nothing but weariness. I just wished them all to go away and leave John and me in peace.
After an English public school, a university, and the army to boot any man was bound to be at the very least aware of homosexual liasons. I myself hadn’t been a stranger to occasional flings in the past, but the idea of doing it for money or some other benefit had always been revolting to me. If we failed to retrieve the letters, I’d rather do the dirtiest and lowest jobs instead of that relatively easy way of earning.
I caressed his thigh in silent agreement. He started to descend, taking me in very slowly, inch by inch. His lips parted as I entered him; he was as maddeningly tight as he had been the first time he gave himself to me. I watched his face for any sign of pain, and all my senses were on the alert lest there be tension in his body as my prick pressed deeper into him. It was agonisingly slow, yet John’s features were enraptured. That was the only thing I cared about.
He was appalled to find out that Dr. Smith was more up-to-date with medical research. She received him courteously while he was rude. It got only worse from that point: she proved to be a better specialist than he, and most of his patients, despite initial distrust, eventually chose to be treated by her. But the most mortifying thing happened when Dr. Ripley got injured and became Dr. Smith’s patient himself. She never gloated, btw.
“Many of them could have been among the hapless victims of the Hamleys bombing, had there been no warning messages,” I said grimly as Holmes and I were looking at them through the window.
In twenty minutes, clerks of the City and Suburban Bank were squinting suspiciously at Holmes and me while Swinsby was getting the contents of his vault. My uniform was so filthy in the back that brushing had been useless—it had to be washed. Mrs. Hudson would not be amused. Taking into account the disastrous state of our sitting-room, I decided not to risk her wrath and do it myself.
“A Turkish bath would do you good,” John said, gazing at me with concern. “Let’s go this weekend? I can reserve our private rooms.”
Amidst our shared gloom, struggling with nightmares and mood swings, we sought consolation in making love. More often than not my body failed me. I would remain limp despite fervently desiring John and needing him. At first John was reluctant to have me in such a state, but soon he was persuaded otherwise, for it was immensely comforting for us both.
“Damn,” he hissed, trembling and wiping beads of sweat from his forehead as he settled down again. “One more day, not longer. I can’t go on imposing on you like this, Doctor. You need a quiet life after the horrors of Afghanistan.”
Holmes didn’t reply. There was clearly something on his mind, for he didn’t utter a word during our hurried walk back to Baker Street. Once at home, he studied the toy minutely, smelled the crate, and then wrote a note which he sent off with Billy. It was only after that that he bathed. Half an hour later, when Billy returned with a reply, Holmes went out immediately.
No one dared disobey. They all scurried away as quickly as they could, leaving me and the gargantuan man alone face to face.
Holmes examined the larder and approved it as a passable hideout. We removed all signs of his presence from the bedroom—bandages, cigarettes, dirty dishes—made the bed, and had Martha’s solemn promise to keep quiet.
Please, John, I thought in despair. You must have recognised me. Are you giving me the taste of my own medicine? Is this a way of telling me that you wish to have nothing to do with me? If that were the case, you would have said so in a straightforward fashion. It is not like you at all to be cruel.
My worst fear became reality when I entered the dimly lit room. He was as white as the sheets of his rumpled bed. All of the symptoms of the influenza were present. Just as in the most severe cases among my recent patients, he was shivering, his breath laboured and wheezy. His hair was sticky with sweat, and hectic spots were bright upon his sunken cheeks. His eyes were enormous in his gaunt, bony face and held a feverish glint. Patients who looked that way didn’t last long.
The next day he rummaged in the wardrobe in his room for about two hours, and when he emerged, I dropped my newspaper and burst out laughing. Holmes was unrecognisable in his attire of Father Christmas, wearing red coat and hood, bushy white beard and gold-rimmed spectacles. His his cheeks were ruddy, and his figure was completely transformed, having attained almost Mycroftian corpulence.
Appalled, I broke off the melody on a half-tone. He sprang to his feet and dashed off to the opposite side of the room where he stood by his desk with his back to me, his shoulders twitching. My first instinct was to run away upstairs and never touch my violin again. How stupid it had been of me to assume that I was helping. My meddling had only done more damage. Yet leaving John alone and upset, without even an apology, would be the height of selfishness and cowardice. Through sheer will I forced myself to bring John a glass of water and put it on the desk beside him.
This story illustrates how tragic the consequences of miscommunication may be. There are also some curious parallels between Mr. and Mrs. Cubitt vs. Holmes and Watson. I will go through it by themes rather than in chronological order.
I offered John some of my books, and the moment he turned around to examine the gap on the book-shelf I had pointed out, I finally threw off the wig and the side-whiskers and straightened myself out.
“If I remember rightly, you’re a fancier of Eastern weapons, aren’t you, Doctor? Here are the few I’ve gathered over the years,” said the Colonel, gesturing at the display case in the corner of the room.
The entire time I was attending to Mrs. Hudson, Holmes stood beside his bed like a ghost, his expression blank. I had no wish to see him further and would have left for Southwark immediately, but my coat had remained upstairs. When I went back for it, Holmes was still frozen to the spot. Without paying him much attention, I put on my coat and headed out.
Music had always been more powerful than words with us, so I played for John day after day. He listened to his favourite airs, and his eyes spoke to me even as his lips were sealed. One evening I found the courage to play him a piece I had composed during my wanderings. From the very beginning his face reflected the same agony, the same longing I had felt while thinking of him.
“I never get your limits, John. You definitely have a knack for housekeeping,” Sherlock said, his head cocked on one side. “Well, for now let’s make do with what’s available to arrange our evening ablutions.”
his consent to an interview. As for me, I shall start writing up the case of the Reigate squires at once, while everything is still fresh in my memory.
“This house could be more than that,” Sherlock said at last. “Have you ever thought of what we are going to do in retirement?”
He turned onto his stomach and parted his legs slightly. The invitation was impossible to withstand, so I climbed on top of him and pressed myself to him. Sweat was pouring from us as I rubbed my prick along the cleft of his arse and then pushed it between his thighs. He welcomed my thrusts with contented grunts; his inner thighs were hot and moist, and his scrotum against my prick just perfect. Tension was growing in him quickly, and I could feel the first tremors in his body beneath mine. A quick release after a long day would do him good indeed. An extended pleasure would be sweeter still. I paused, catching my breath.
Here’s a gentleman’s honour which Holmes values so much. Surely, he wouldn’t have taken advantage of one woman to protect another. Watson, of course, wouldn’t hear of Holmes risking alone. Just as Holmes, Watson has his own personal code of honour:
When I returned to our flat, a terrible malodorous smell attacked my nostrils the moment I entered the sitting-room. Poor Gladstone darted past me and through the opened door down the stairs, apparently to seek refuge in Mrs. Hudson’s parlour. The state of the room was appalling: heaps of papers strewn everywhere, vials with reagents occupying every surface—even my desk—and acrid smoke ceiling-high.
. Here’s another example of Holmes being infuriated by men mistreating women. When he learns of Gibson’s advances towards Miss Dunbar, the governess, he is outright disgusted and says so in Gibson’s face:
Note the season, it’s winter. We’ll return to it later. Holmes demonstrates an immense repulsion to Milverton, calling him
John grunted, his chest heaving heavily as he was adjusting to my length. He was a feast for the eyes, in his scarlet tunic, mounted on me with his prick at full stand. I knew I was on the brink and wouldn’t last. John let out a luxurious groan when I was completely sheathed in him. For a few moments he visibly relished it and then started to move. It was glorious. My gorgeous officer rode me, his rigid cock bouncing up and down, his hips undulating in a smooth, graceful rhythm of a cavalryman. It was more than I could bear.
I held him in my arms as tremors ran through his body and he reached the peak. With a low groan he spent hard, thick white spurts hitting the fireplace screen. Gasping, he shuddered from the aftershocks, and I kissed his nape soothingly. He let out a happy, sated sigh, leaning back on me.
How could I have ever doubted him? How could I have ever known the separation would affect him so? Perhaps I had made a grievous mistake by denying him the right to fight our enemies together.
We finished our session before we could become outrageously obvious. As we headed to the dressing-room, Holmes was discoursing upon the ways our training regimen could be improved, mentioning various practices he had studied on the Continent. Suddenly he fell silent mid-sentence. On the bench beside our lockers there was a small crate with a narrow strip of paper pasted to it. The message contained only two words:
The stout, good-natured landlord served us a freshly-cooked, nutritious country dinner which was most welcome.
Holmes might sometimes disparage Watson’s tendency for romanticism and/or sensationalism in his stories, but it’s clear that he actually cares a lot about Watson’s literary endeavours. If he hadn’t, he wouldn’t have mentioned them, right?
On the evening of May 3d we arrived at Meiringen, a picturesque village where I’d hoped we could spend a few days in peace. We had barely been ushered to our hotel rooms, however, when the landlord came and said that there was a telephone call for me. It was an ominous sign, for I didn’t regularly keep Mycroft appraised of our whereabouts. Careful not to show my anxiety, I asked if I could take the call in a private place. The landlord graciously offered his study.
I had discovered that the syndicate frequently sabotaged operations of British intelligence. That was a direct challenge to Mycroft himself, and thus all his resources were fully at my disposal. I had long resisted Mycroft’s attempts to recruit me for government service, but finally this gave him the upper hand in the matter. I wanted to be done with it as quickly as possible, so I had to be at peak efficiency. This often meant that I would forego rest for days and weeks, functioning on various chemical stimulants. Frankly, it’s surprising that I didn’t develop a severe addiction.
He gestured across the path, at a vantage point where Colonel Moran stood with his rifle at the ready. Indeed, there would be no time to draw the pistol from my pocket or the knife from my boot.
Mine had a gaping hole. I needed to do something which would distract me from the emptiness, at least during the daytime. Outside, the journalists had cleared off, so I decided to take advantage of that to visit Jackson, who was kindly treating my patients in my absence.
“The charity event would have been cancelled. It would have prevented this attack, but, sadly, not future ones, and next time we could receive no warnings.”
We enjoyed another fortnight of our blissed domesticity. Mrs. Hudson’s cooking gradually worked its magic, and as the weather was getting warmer, we had more energy and went out more.
The urge to touch myself, watching him, grew stronger and stronger. My prick begged for attention, but I was completely still, mesmerised by the sight of my beautiful soldier undressing.
“Yes, I have but a few friends,” the Colonel replied. “The house and my hobby take up most of my time.”
We walked several blocks along shabby backstreets which Holmes clearly knew like the back of his hand. The exertion was difficult for him, and he leaned on me several times when he was short of breath. He stopped in front of one of the drab stables, rapped on the gate quietly, and uttered a single gravelly word, “Rache.”
who is rather outgoing and knows every bit of gossip in the village. The very same housekeeper then takes care of an injured Murdoch, being obviously proficient in administering medical aid. And note that when Murdoch pleads for
“Surgeon of the Royal Berkshire Regiment has reported for duty, sir,” Watson said and saluted, slightly touching his cap.
“I am sorry for having distressed you all,” I continued more gently. “Especially you, my dear Mrs. Hudson. I promised once that I would never trick you again, and I failed to keep my word. For that I apologise from the bottom of my heart.”
Soon after Holmes’s birthday, the epidemiological situation worsened. Many doctors caught the disease themselves and brought the contagion to their own homes. Fearing for the welfare of my household, I decided that a temporary relocation to my surgery in Paddington would be best. During the same time, Stamford asked me to help out at Bart’s, so now my schedule also included the hospital and the medical tent it maintained for the poor in Southwark. Days blurred into a relentless round of sick rooms with sufferers of every age and station in life.
(1898). There, two partners in crime, an older leader and his younger accomplice, do a series of outrageous and clever scams all over the States. Just like Raffles, Sparrow MacCoy is very savvy about criminal affairs while Edward, just like Bunny, is a “
Holmes sprang to his feet, took the tray from her, and carried it to the table. She snorted, shaking her head.
Upon our return to our rooms, we ascertained that Mrs. Hudson was safe and sound. It was by this time well after two in the morning, so we all agreed to postpone further discussions until a more reasonable hour.
every month. Newspapers requested interviews with me more insistently than ever, and I didn’t turn them down, for I knew they might reach Sherlock. It was an opportunity to have at least some sort of communication with him, albeit one-sided and censored.
“Then it’s definitely worth buying. These parts are quiet and beautiful. The place is ideal for resting without any disturbance.”
His composure was impeccable. His eyes were more steely than usual, reflecting the additional self-control he exercised over his emotions. The relationship between the Holmes brothers had never been effusive. Nevertheless, they had always cared deeply for each other.
. The main character of the story is Hugh Lawrence (who resides in Baker Street like the future Sherlock Holmes). He is invited to the house of his friend John H. Thurston (Watson is also John H.). Hugh is a doctor (like Watson) and Thurston is a chemist (like Holmes). The story tells how Hugh act as an amateur detective to solve the strange behaviours of two guests of the house.
“Under the present circumstances who can guarantee that we won’t be disturbed?” John replied pointedly.
“John, please,” I said, striking a match and lighting his cigarette. “Once again, stop blaming yourself for things you’re not guilty of. For the past three years my life has been what Mycroft wanted it to be: without you and in the government service. He surely got the most out of the debacle I had entangled myself in.”
As ever, Watson reads Holmes with ease, and not only him, demonstrating his observation skills by noticing the fake Garrideb’s moods too. As ever, they are comfortable around each other: Holmes touches Watson’s wrist as a signal for action in the ambush, doesn’t lose an instant to rip Watson’s trousers with his pocket-knife to examine the wound, and then Watson leans on Holmes’s arm.
I functioned as if an automaton, participating in the necessary proceedings, answering questions and so on. A local newspaper requested an interview from me, but I declined, of course. There was nothing else to be done in Meiringen. It was time to return to London.
“‘On Boxing Day at three everything shall be over,’ he said. ‘Lord Roxton shall have the taste of my dynamite.’
I mean, you would expect some accuracy from a physician writer? XDDD But instead he often used a popular trend as a plot device. You never cease to amaze me, Sir Arthur.
“All night I didn’t sleep a wink, racking my brain how to give Mr. Holmes a clue. In the morning I picked up a discarded broken clock, put some gunpowder into it, and adjusted its hands. Through acquaintances I found out the address of Dr. Watson’s practice.
2) Before 1886, marriages could be solemnised between 8 and 12 o’clock in the morning. Upon introduction of the Marriages Act of 1886, it became legal to get married until 3 in the afternoon. In SCAN, Holmes says, “It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind” and Godfrey Norton urges him to become their best man: “Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.” Therefore, SCAN took place before 1886, and not in 1888 as Watson tells us.
After lunch Holmes retired upstairs, and I reopened my surgery. The rumour of the black carriage’s visit must have spread quickly, for there were no more questions from my patients. Nobody wished to know anything they weren’t supposed to, for the Special Division itself was unmentionable.
At that point I decided that the most sensible course of action would be to get away to the Continent with John, having left all threads in the hands of intelligence services and the police. Mycroft agreed with my plan, seeming quite relieved, for he preferred to have his den to himself and putting up with someone else for a week had been grating on his nerves.
Blood rushing in my ears, I rose, snatched the will from the desk, and strode to the fireplace. The solicitor watched me startled and confused while Mycroft was… intrigued.
London had changed over the three years of my absence. I noted numerous differences during my drive to Baker Street. Emotions threatened to break through my crumbling composure as I rattled past the familiar places. My city. I would need to reacquaint myself with it.
? Isn’t that a weird choice of words? Has Watson been married at all in his life? Each time it doesn’t compute, I take it that the two good gentlemen are mystifying us.
I followed John upstairs, stepping as quietly as I could. The door to our bedroom was slightly open. I stopped just outside it, watching John through the narrow slit. John was unbuttoning his tunic slowly, a complacent smile still playing upon his lips. The whiteness of his shirt contrasted with the scarlet of his tunic; with his neck and chest exposed, he looked debauched, and yet I knew that this wanton officer belonged only to me.
When we were about to leave, John confessed to Mrs. Hudson that he had known of my secret and apologised profoundly for having kept it from her.
”. These two are ridiculously in love as ever. War or no war, Holmes will find a moment to treat his Watson to delicious wine.
“Come in, will you,” John said suddenly, without turning his head towards the door. “Or would you prefer to come where you are, just from watching?”
“It will blow over,” I said soothingly. “He’ll get off his high horse, and meanwhile we shall live by our own wits as we always did.”
“In this case you’ll come with me. As you undoubtedly have heard, there are members of the Royal Family who lend their assistance to the Special Division. Their methods will surely help you to remember.”
And then the situation went downhill. Much to my dismay, it turned out that the doctor loved Sherlock back. They became involved. Now they were in constant danger of being discovered and disgraced. The indiscretions they allowed themselves were appalling—they could gaze at each other as the love-besotted fools they were, transparent to anyone more or less observant. I watched them from my brougham on several occasions when they were out on the street, having a walk or investigating. Sherlock was annoyed by my supervision, yet thanked me for my advice to be more careful. Naturally, I ensured that their household would not betray them. Their landlady and servants were trustworthy folks.
This ordeal produced a dismal effect on Sherlock. While we were driving to the station, his hands shook; a pulsing vein bulged on his forehead.
“Stamford,” Holmes said thoughtfully. “Yes, I know the chap. Perhaps I’ll have an opportunity to thank him properly. And, for that matter, you, Doctor. You really must let me go. If I stay, it could mean trouble for you.”
I raised myself and embraced him. He kissed me forcefully, desperately, as if fearing a foolish step from me, the kind which had already crossed my mind.
I cursed Moriarty and his gang and my own stupidity. I pleaded with God for a miracle, that He in His mercy would return Sherlock to me alive and well. But neither prayer, tears, nor curses could undo the past and mend the present. The present was beyond any hope of mending. The only thing for incurable cases such as this would be anaesthesia.
And just a quick note on the margin: for a seasoned spy Von Bork is rather too talkative. Eagerly describing how his safe works and even telling Altamont the password? Really?
“Oh no-no, Dr. Watson. Your modesty will do no good on this occasion. You are to be an equal co-owner.”
Holmes stared at me as if doused with a bucket of cold water. Truth to be told, I was somewhat shocked myself. Perhaps weariness and nerves had contributed to my ire. Worried by the yells, Mrs. Hudson came trotting from her parlour.
“I’d expect something more solitary from Mycroft,” I said. “In any case, the solution to this mystery is near.”
. Now he knew it only served the purpose of protecting our privacy, so the mention of it would catch his eye.
Holmes snorted with distaste. Then he rose, went to his desk, and brought me a small book. The name on the cover was unfamiliar to me. It was a collection of poetry: lyrical, beautiful verses imbued with Gothic mysticism and decadence that belonged to the pen of a talented author.
When the service was over and the priest departed, we stood in silence for a while. Wiggins sniffed quietly, looking very young without his cheeriness and confidence—a bereft child once again. Lestrade’s brow was furrowed and his jaw set; the captured members of Moriarty’s organisation would surely get what they deserved. Mrs. Hudson was wiping her eyes with her handkerchief, her lips trembling. The mourning crape made her seem small and frail, but she strove to keep her posture straight. Wiggins accompanied her towards the exit, and Lestrade led the way to shield her from the pestilent reporters.
"You are such a good boy. Your cock is all nice and hard for me, hmmm? You want me to suck this, Sherlock?"
He placed my penis into his mouth, and I cannot even explain what euphoria it was. Sucking, kissing, techniques that I was wondering how he even did that with his tongue.
! Was this his punishment for fucking his girlfriend? That was literally three years ago! He needed to get over it, but he apparently hadn’t.
And not a lot of people like doing what I do! Doing experiments on dead carcasses of animals and the occasional prostitute, shooting guns in the house at walls, not eating nor sleeping for days. I mean, I believe that stuff is very enjoyable to do.
“I’m coming, John, I-I’m-AUGH” Sherlock shuddered, streams of white spurting out of him as his asshole tightened around John’s cock. “Oh my God, Sherlock, you’re gorgeous, wow, absolutely gorgeous!” John cried out, fingernails digging into his hips. Sherlock smiled encouragingly, looking back at his lover. “Come for me, Daddy, c’mon, come inside me!”
We had both orgasmed at the same time, collapsing hard. After about five minutes, slowly John pulled out of me, and got up from his bed.
He woke me up aggressively and angrily, as if I had done something wrong. I told him to fuck off, and that made him even more livid.
On another note, if you all have any suggestions on what you would like to happen in the story, please let me know! The readers are the most important part of the story, you know <3
I shrugged nonchalantly and stomped on my cigarette. "My brother wants me to go make 'friends' and so we made a bet. I of course lost the goddamn bet."
Before he could reply, I pushed him out the door and locked it quickly. His insistent banging and begging me to let him in quite annoyed me so.
"Wow. That was, uh, incredible. Fantastic. A-amazing." Samuel stuttered, avoiding eye-contact with me.
Eventually Mycroft came into my room without knocking and saw that I had fallen asleep with razor in hand and my blood stained white sheets.
In addition to wanting to John back, that man that touched me made me feel repulsive. The whole experience of being free by dancing was absolutely ruined by him. My teeth started chattering from how disgusted and angry I felt, and so I decided to count the money I had received from the tips. I counted £275, which was a surprisingly high amount as I had only grabbed a small handful from what was on the stage.
I barely got out the words "John, you should know I am a virgin", before he shoved his tongue down my throat even further. His hands roamed my body, grasping my buttocks and bulge. I made noises that I have never heard myself make before, which was quite an odd experience.
When John finally looked around, he suppressed a gasp. As far as the eye could see, beautiful men, with their dicks and balls and asses, were all fucking, getting fucked and sucked and everything in between. Moans filled the air, with curses and swears and “Harder Daddy!”. How glorious.
"Well, you could either leave straight through the back or front door, or you could go out and meet some your adoring fans as they buy you drinks and tell you how beautiful you are. Your pick!" He laughed gently.
"You haven't been surrounded by people besides me and the...occasional dead prostitute in two years. You avoid people at all costs. How could you possibly know they wouldn't like you?"
"GENTLEMEN!!!! PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FOR THE ARMY DOCTOR YOU ALL KNOW AND LOVE, THE ONE, THE ONLY, HAMISH!!!"
And just letting you know, its okay to upset and sad and frustrated with the writers, okay? They led us on and messed with our feelings. I love you, okay? And we all deserve the best. So enjoy <3
The music blaring should've hurt my eardrums, but I was too focused on the beauty of Hamish. His sculpted legs were of God-like structure, his chest that had blonde hairs splattered all over it, and he wore a skimpy outfit, so his arse and bulge were also very pleasant to see.
The tears that fell seemed to have shaken the ground beneath me. Everytime it reached the floor, my body convulsed.
"God, you are just so sexy." John grumbled into my mouth as he unhooked my belt and slip my Belstaff coat off.
"Mycroft," I sighed, rubbing my temple. "People don't like me and I don't like them. Why should I even bother?"
All noise I was making was incredibly unrecognizable and unattractive, but seemed encouraging to him.
I would never tell him that he was my first kiss. The stripper I met about twenty-five minutes ago gave me the best thing I had ever experienced.
After more convincing myself silently, I sneaked through the security guard as he was chatting up another young fellow and making suggestive comments towards him. I shuddered.
I had cried that night for the first time in about four or five, possibly six, years. I felt completely broken.
"You'll be okay, love. I'll be gentle with you." He whispered, as he kissed my hole once more before gently and slowly pushing himself in me.
"Is that so, Mr. Holmes? Well, tell you what. You perform tonight, and if the crowd likes ya, you're hired. Fair?"
“You want me to fuck you, nasty little boy? Is that what you want?” John hissed, nipping at Sherlock’s neck and relishing in his moans.
He pushed me onto his bed, climbing on top of me and sucking on my neck. By this time, we were both naked except for our pants.
“It’s my birthday, and my friend made the arrangements, and I don’t really know what I’m doing, and I-” The queen laughed and put a manicured nail to his lips. “Shhh, honey, it’s alright. Follow me.” She grabbed John’s hand and led him down a path to a room on the left side. CONSULTING DETECTIVE was splattered on the door, and John raised an eyebrow. “He’s one of our favourites here. A quiet man, and expensive, but can read you like a book… and then some. I hope you have a good time, and I’ll buy you a drink afterwards. The names Tracie.” She winked, kissing John on the cheek and sauntering away.
Next thing John knew, he was hearing those goddamn lyrics as this gorgeous consulting detective pushed him onto this couch that literally appeared out of nowhere;
His answer was sealed onto my heart when he pressed his lips upon mine. Passionately, wildly, absurdly.
I had arrived precisely twenty minutes before his part of the show, that way we would have plenty of time to talk.
I thanked him once more, as I went into my room to change back into my "normal" clothes, and gave myself a pep-talk before going out to see the people.
"I was a protégé of a very well-known violinist and had the wonderful opportunity to play along side him as well as by myself in front of the Queen when I was eight years old."
I turned around and there John Watson was. Visibly shaking and eyes puffed as mine were, I was speechless.
"I...I, thank you John. You are absolutely incredible." My reply came in a croak, pleasure flashed before my eyes from love-bites being placed upon my neck and collarbone. He chuckled, and the vibration hummed through my bones. The arousal was absolutely blinding me, until I felt his hot breath on my groin. "You want this, Sherlock? You want me to suck this?"
“Shut up and sit down in that chair.” The voice replied. John frowned, and crossed his arms over his chest. “Excuse me?”
“This is a fucking joke! You don’t seriously think I like cock, do you?” John Watson huffed and puffed as he, quite frankly, knew he liked cock. He loved cock. And supposedly, everyone else knew it too, including his best friend, Greg Lestrade. Greg, that fucking
"Oh, Sherlock. That was eleven years ago. People change. You have to experience life or else you're going to die alone! And I...I don't want you to die alone." He croaked the last word.
It all became a blur from the sensations. He hit my prostate over and over again, he pulled my hair and made me moan his name. I couldn't tell you how long intercourse was, if it was five minutes or five hours.
They swarmed like ants around me, giving me praises that ranged from lovely ones such as "You are the most gorgeous man I have ever seen" to crude ones such as "I'd love to suck your cock, do you charge?"
I can be an emotionless machine. Love? What is the point of love? Love is a sentiment defect found on the losing side.
I furrowed my eyebrows at his preposterous statement. "I don't have time to 'bullshit', Mr. Hunary. I'm an accomplished musician with a lot of talent, and you would be lucky to have someone like me work at this institution."
"AND NOW GENTLEMEN!!! WE HAVE A BRAND NEW DANCER HERE TONIGHT, SO DON'T BE TOO AGGRESSIVE AND ROUGH WITH HIM, BUT MAKE HIM FEEL SPECIAL. WELCOME ABOARD, 'DIRTY LITTLE VIRGIN'!!!!!!"
"He had consumed me, he had consumed my entire being. I wanted him. I wanted him to destroy me. But once he did, I wanted to die."
“I’m sorry, how the fuck did you know that?” John croaked. “I never told Lestrade about Mary, and my parents, and…”
No. That surely couldn't have been from me? The lighting must've been weird, his pupils were dilated a tremendous amount.
I couldn't even say anything, my fears of losing my virginity were being washed away by the sinful thoughts that clouded my mind palace. My mind palace was a sacred place for me to retreat too, but at that moment, I just did not care.
"Uh, 'Dirty Little Virgin', you're up." Samuel, the stage manager, called out to me. I nodded, and slowly followed him to behind the thin and silvery curtain. There was no turning back now, I had to go up there.
“Hello honey, do you happen to be John Watson?” Someone purred in his ear. He turned around and saw a beautiful woman.
I saw him, sitting there at the very table where I first laid eyes on him. My heart stopped, but I continued to ignore him and move my body to the sound of the violin. Suddenly, I reached the extremely cold metal pole and very s l o w l y climbed to the top of it, sliding my way down in a graceful manner just using my legs. I slid to the bottom and started to roll around, grabbing various parts of my body in a sensual motion, closing my eyes and slightly moaning.
Inhaling the smoke, John instantly felt lighter, happier. “This is so good… w-who are you?” He asked suddenly. The man had lit his own, exhaling the smoke right into John’s face. “Sherlock Holmes.”
I can ruin the self-esteem you've been building up for years and tear it down in thirty-seven seconds.
"Hey pretty boy, why don't you sit down by me?" A blonde-haired man that looked similar to Rocky from The Rocky Horror Picture Show said to me, smiling devilishly.
He came towards me, crawling on the ground, licking his lips, and I felt my erection growing rapidly. Shakily I took out a fiver and slid it towards him, but he ignored it and kept on grabbing his crotch in front of me.
The stage was dark, and the dim spotlight shined on me as I scanned through the crowd. Eyes never left my sight, their mouths agape; it was quite extraordinary.
My heart, my supposed robotic heart, stopped completely when I saw him. John was there, at the table I sat at when I first saw him. But he was sitting in someone's lap, his arms locked around their neck. He looked adoringly at them, the way he looked when first started talking to me.
Mycroft was screaming at my door to let him in so we could "discuss these matters and let his men handle the situation", but I kept telling him to shut up and go away. Alas, I grew tired of his insistent yapping and so I let him in.
The bitter cold scaled through my bones just like the drugs used to do. Those sounded extremely pleasing at the moment, but I settled on a cigarette.
I couldn't stop sobbing. I loved John, I really did. I wanted him back, but my pride, or whatever the hell it was, it was standing in my way.
"Oh shut up Sherlock, it's true. I do care and I just want this... young man to not cause you any pain."
“Awh, c’mon mate! It’s your birthday. You haven’t gotten laid in a bit, obviously, and this place seems right up your alley!” Greg smiled deviously, pushing John out of his car and handing him a tenner. “Enjoy yourself buddy, I’ll see you tomorrow. Hopefully you’re not too sore by then. And remember, the word to get in is Basket!” And on that delightful note, he screeched away, leaving his friend stranded in some strange and unknown land.
"Well, Mr... Holmes," The man looks up at me from his glasses, glancing at my quite impressive resume after I placed it in front of him impatiently. "Do you have any experience in dancing or performing in front of a crowd?"
I ran my hands through my thick and curly hair once more, looking in the mirror with terrible lighting and making sure I look decent enough; a black g-string along with a long sleeved, flowy, and thin black shirt.
John was going to explode once he saw me. Oh, the bastard needed to prepare himself for what I was going to do.
The amount of "whooping" and "hollering" that exploded from these men quite startled me, but I shook it off and let the music start to flow through the audience.
Usually dancers pick erotically explicit songs to gyrate their bodies too, but I decided to take another route. "Infra 5" filled the room softly, and the room hushed as I came out.
I sniffed and rolled my eyes. "Mycroft, I don't understand why you have to care so much. Is it really necessary?"
Hola everyoooone, I suck at updating but here I am once again. Since johnlock didn't become "officially" canon like it was supposed to, hopefully all the beautiful fanfic that the brillant fans in the Sherlock fandom write will fill your heart.
“What’s the word?” The mysterious man growled, sounding halfway like a fucking Scottish werewolf. “Ehm… Baskets?” John squeaked, suddenly very frightened.
I moaned unintentionally, and he must've heard it, as he bit his lip and gently touched my face. He was bloody glorious.
Next thing I hear is opening of condoms wrappers and a bottle of lubricant being squeezed. I braced for this, John's penis was slightly above average (from what I've seen with certain realistic porn videos and walking in on Mycroft and another man accidently) and I had never experienced sex before.
I've always known I was gay, since I had no attraction to women whatsoever. So this event definitely wouldn't be hurtful on the eyes.
“DADDY!” His knees started to buckle, as he screamed into the pillow. Once John heard that, he knew he was coming soon. “C’mon Sherlock, you gonna come for me? C’mon babe, yea, c’mon!”
