It’s what Sherlock would want. What he would need to solve this thing.
Restlessly pacing around Baker Street and worrying his bottom lip with his thumb, Sherlock’s eyebrows were furrowed together and had been furrowed for the past ten minutes as he tried to puzzle out the case he had been working on for the past three days. Sleep had eluded him for the previous 72 hours, and it didn’t seem to be coming any easier that night. Dark was smudged under his eyes, the fingers on his free hand were flitting around him anxiously, fluttering through the sky and drumming on his thighs, and he was a little unsteady on his feet. Still, he paced, unable to calm his mind until the case was finished.
“Sherlock…” John said, his skin starting to feel hot and prickly, his fingers tingling painfully. The fingers pressing into his skin suddenly felt unbearable, and John started to writhe around on the table, trying to twist free of the hot press of hands all over his arms and legs. “Sherlock, wh-what’s happening to me?” John can feel the fear in his own voice.
“Sherlock,” John whispered, putting his hand on Sherlock’s face, wiping away the still-flowing tears. “Look at me, will you?”
“I don’t care what he deserves, dear brother, telling him will not help him heal. It will not help us control the situation,” Mycroft snapped. “My men know how to handle this, they’ve dealt with the effects of it before. John is in good hands, he is as safe as he can be, so please leave this room! You are making it very difficult for my men to work with all your pacing and incessant mumbling and fretting!” Mycroft’s voice started sounding farther and farther away, but John could tell that he was at the end of his rope, stress fraying the edges of his nerve.
Sherlock set his pen down on the table with a shaking hand. He folded the note carefully and clutched it in his hand tightly before gingerly picking up the gun lying beside him on his bed. Biting his lip, he tried to hold back the whimper making its way up his throat. He squeezed his tear-rimmed eyes shut and tried to calm himself with deep breathing before tightening his grip on the gun.
“Hmm?” Sherlock hummed after a few seconds as if he hadn’t heard what John just asked.
When they reached their destination, John set Sherlock down on the edge of their sink, causing Sherlock to roll his eyes. “John, I don’t think that was necessary, I can-” John shushed him and placed a kiss to the tip of Sherlock’s nose. His face turned a very pleasant shade of pink, and John winked at him.
John could feel himself getting faint, could feel himself starting to sway on his feet, and had just enough time to squeeze out, “Sh- Sherlock…” before he was collapsing, passing out in the arms of the man he had needed most of all.
As Sherlock carefully set John down on the portable gurney and kissed John’s forehead, John tugged on his sleeve and said, “Thank you, ‘Lock.”
“Oh, and John?” Sherlock said after a little while, running his fingers carefully along John’s arm. “I don’t listen to them. Well, I try not to. It gets to me sometimes. But then, I look at you, and the amount of utter awe in your eyes is enough to remind me that they’re wrong and that they simply aren’t worthy of my attention or my pity. They don’t deserve to know the real me, the me that only you have the privilege to know.” John hummed in agreement, thoughts slowly draining out of his mind as his focus shifted only to the hand running gently up and down his arm and the comfortable heat surrounding his body. John felt high and happy, holding Sherlock closely on the floor of their flat. What he wouldn’t give to stay like that forever, bathed in the quiet bliss of their apartment, drunk with everything Sherlock.
Ava got her phone and connected it with Sherlock's computer.
"No, I don't think I am. But you might be his."
"How?"
Slowly he pushed the door open. He sneaked inside. The room was dark as night, and John couldn't see a thing. It smelled like acrylic paint, vomit, blood and urine. He softly closed the door behind him and searched for a light switch, hoping that it wouldn't lit up the whole garden. He reached with his hand across the wall next to the door until his fingers found what he was looking for. With the Browning steady in his left hand, he switched the light switch with his right.
"Is he missing? What happened?"
"Been to Blenheim Grove, behind Peckham Rye Station? She's there most of 'er time."
"Yes he is, isn't he?" Sherlock answered her question. Esmeralda turned the paper and lay it back as she had found it.
"No. You shouldn't. I'm just going to break your heart. I'm sorry, Sherlock."
David tried to hit him. John ducked just in time, so the fist aimed for his head missed target.
"I told Mycroft."
Partially collapsed lung: shortness of breath and nasal flaring. Can deteriorate into tension pneumothorax if left untreated.
She asked John.
He had to say that Marc did a proper job not spilling any blood. Except for the torn lip. He was a bit worried about the dislocated knee, that was an severe injury. Probably needed surgery to fix it again. He knew the partial collapsed lunge and the contused or ruptured testicle were worrisome too. Better not think about that.
"Can I get you a spare sweatshirt? I have one in my car, just in case if I wanted to go sporting after work, you know."
But he came back after almost a year. He looked good. Happy, even. He took me out for coffee, just us old friends. We talked. I asked him how he was doing. What had happened to him to shine like he did. He didn't want to say it at first, but after I pushed him, he said that I earned to know the truth, that I deserved it. Thanks to me he got clean, got his life back on track, and he finally told me that he had met someone. That he had fallen in love. And that he was going to do everything in his power to keep this person in his life. That was about four years ago. He kept his promise, and I only saw him using a couple of times since then. But he never felled back into the destructive lifestyle he had lived for years. Because there was someone for him to live for now. He whined the last time he shot himself up. Telling me that he was so scared that you would find out and leave him. I told him that the only way to prevent that from happening, was to stop doing it then. And I know he did. A day before his so called suicide, he came to me, asking for help. He told me he was about to break the heart of the man he loved to save his life, and he needed the homeless network to help him out. So we did. He came to see me when he raised from the grave, to thank me again for my help, and to tell me he was back again, and that you had given him the black eye. Which you had all the right to do, if you asked me. He was here two weeks ago, asking if we wanted to look out for three men, but came back last week to tell us that he narrowed it down to two. I didn't speak with him anymore afterwards. But I can assure you, John, he's not shooting up. He would have come to me to do it, because he doesn't trust anyone else to look after him when he does, and I would have done everything in my power to prevent that from happening."
"Are you drunk?"
John didn't answer. Instead he turned back to Sherlock and dropped himself on his knees next to him again.
"You seem... tense."
"I still do, handsome."
"You know as well as I do that when the serum is still in my system, the sedative won't do it's work. And I'll be damned to shoot myself."
"Try to distract him, I'm going to get the sedative."
A few days later the village was attacked. Bombed. Sadeq died. His body was taken to our hospital, and I sat with him all night, drawing him, as a last goodbye. I cried. It felt as if I lost my own father. I didn't know you at that time, of course, but you always say coincidence doesn't happen. That the universe is never that lazy. The universe must have really hated me at that moment, because the next day exactly that happened. I was in the middle of a surgery, trying to fix one of my boys, when a nurse entered the room. He told me that my parents had died that morning. Car accident.
Sherlock looked up at him and blinked a few times.
"You just did."
John and Sherlock looked at each other and Sherlock's jaw tensed.
"Now I am going to prepare you for our first painting. Please hold still. This could sting a bit."
“We’ll face him, together Sherlock. And we’ll win,” John said, hoping to whatever being out there that the hallucination would end soon, or it would soon wear Sherlock out to exhaustion.
John gave her a half smile.
Its been months now since leaving you. Ten to be precise. Three hundred and four days. Four hundred thirty-seven thousand seven hundred and twenty-five minutes. I have been all over the world. From America to Taiwan, from Russia to Australia, from China to South Africa. Sitting in planes, roaming the streets, infiltrating in his network, taking it apart one piece at the time. It's so much bigger than I had estimated it would be, and it took me longer than I had expected. It should have been just a couple of months, sixty-one days, ninety at most. But I keep discovering more. I miss you. I miss you being beside me, I miss your company. I know I made the right decision, taking this one on my own, but I wished I could have taken you with me. Without you, I feel incomplete, alone.
“... really, you should put down that gun. It isn’t getting us anywhere, and honestly, do you want to stand there all night pointing that thing at me? It’ll get dreadfully boring,” John heard Sherlock drawl. John’s teeth gritted when he took in the cocky tone of his words, clenching and unclenching his hands and wishing for his gun.
John, after quickly putting the shopping away, walked slowly towards Sherlock and dragged a hand across his shoulders, settling on one and giving it a firm squeeze. Sherlock looked at John and smiled morosely before turning back towards the window, scanning the dark horizon in front of him.
“Someone call an ambulance, I think he’s been drugged with Rohypnol, it can be fatal if he doesn’t get medical attention as soon as possible!” John shouted, a frantic edge to his voice. Sobs started breaking out of his chest, and he felt Sherlock’s fingers playing in the hair on the back of his neck.
“But-” John grabbed him by the front of his stuffed up, starched shirt and pulled him down, bearing his teeth.
The pressure in his lungs was building, the panic in his brain increasing in a similar amount.
“Sherlock Holmes!” John snapped, his hand clenching and unclenching in his lap. Sherlock jumped and looked at John with widened eyes, as he had not been expecting John to shout him out of his mind palace. John, staring at the bags under Sherlock’s eyes, sighed and stood up, reaching a hand out towards Sherlock. “You’ve been pacing endlessly for nearly the entire day, and you haven’t slept in nearly four days. I don’t think I’ve seen you eat anything more than a piece of toast during that time, and don’t think I haven’t noticed that you haven’t been drinking any of the tea I make for you either,” John said softly, closing his hand gently around Sherlock’s forearm. Sherlock looks away from John almost guiltily, staring at the ground, not trying to wrench his arm from John’s careful grip. “Hey, is everything alright?”
“Good.”
“I have had quite enough of your little jokes, Sherlock!” Mycroft bellowed, sending both John and Sherlock into a state of shock. Mycroft nearly never lost his composure, even John knew that, and it was unsettling to see him in the midst of an outburst.
So, he just sat there and hoped that Sherlock would notice he was gone, and that he’d be able to deduce where he was.
“I’ll be okay, John. I promise. I’ll tell you about it tomorrow, but we’ve both had quite the emotionally exhausting day, so I think it best if we wait. Is that alright?” Sherlock asked, his arms still linked around John’s neck.
“It’s… good,” he said, sending John and Lestrade into a fit of happy laughter.
His trousers were ripped along the outside of his thigh where a bullet had obviously skimmed him, and blood was soaking into the fabric around the wound.
He’d never have to worry about being abandoned ever again.
Maybe they’re his.
Sherlock nods to himself, brushing his fingers over John’s face and pushing his hair back, pressing kisses all over his face, trying to stop the swell of tears he could feel in his eyes. “Don’t worry, John,” Sherlock said between kisses, the pale face of John Watson still held between his hands. “We’ll find out what this is, and who did this to you, and they will pay, and you will wake up, and everything will be right with the world.” John started to shake in his unconscious state and Sherlock pulled him closer to himself, wrapping the parts of John that he could in his long coat, tears dripping onto the shoulder of John’s jumper.
“John,” Sherlock said, gasping and shaking against John. “I don’t want to alarm you, but I think I’ve been shot.” He gasped again, and his legs seemed to give out. John barely caught him in time, trying to force words of comfort out of his mouth but unable to push them past the panic. When John grabbed him, Sherlock let out a pained moan and dug his fingers into John’s shoulders. “Yep, I’ve-” Another gasp. “Definitely been shot. Twice. Once in the-” A deep, shuddering breath. “Once in the right shoulder, once in my hip. Too bad-”
"Yes... yes, sure."
John raised an eyebrow.
"Almost no brain activity, Non-communicative, Unemotional and the most disturbing of all, contagious. They seemed to have developed an taste for human flesh. And when they bite, they spread the virus."
"Goodbye, John."
"I don't trust him." John explained.
"Where's the ambulance?" John interrupted him. Greg focused back on John.
"And the genetics labs there?"
"You didn't know that at that time."
But while he told him, Sherlock just buried his face in the files of the case. It felt if he was avoiding him. John feared that Sherlock somehow had managed to find out what John really felt for him, and that that was the reason for his behaviour. When they got home Tuesday night, Sherlock was in a mood. They ignored each other in the cab, and when they got home, Sherlock slammed the door of his bedroom so hard, John feared that he had slammed it out of it's frame. He didn't see him for the rest of the evening.
"Sherlock told me that you were clever."
Sherlock watched the screen intensely, seeing the cells react, and he looked up when Ava took her seat behind her own desk.
"The doctor was in this morning."
"You don't expect me to end up like Beth or Clive or Daniel? Do you? There's nothing else we can do, gorgeous. And I like to keep some of my dignity before I die."
Mycroft was silent.
"No."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
"Nah. Don't feel like 't. Yer on yer own, man."
"How are you planning to do this?"
"You do realise it can take a year until full recovery?"
"I couldn't sleep."
“For obvious reasons, that's going to be a problem.”
John had been looking forward to it. Not the class itself including interaction with the other students, or the teacher. Not even so they could work further on the case. No. He felt the need to draw. To direct his emotions somewhere. Especially when he was struggling like this. And paper was a good thing to use. It was weird how fast it had become something essential for him again. The years of avoiding pencils and paper seemed forgotten.
"O, John. This is breathtaking." She said softly, stroking her fingers across the side of the paper. She looked up at him as if she couldn't believe that the man in front of her had it in him, and John felt himself getting a bit uncertain, shy even, and he cleared his throat before speaking to her.
"You're a very skilled model, aren't you? Christ! It's that I can see you breathe from time to time, otherwise I would swear I was looking at a statue!"
"I drove you into suicide. I almost killed you."
"How many are there?"
"Ah, hello Gerald. Came to pop out for a smoke?"
Ava started coughing. Her hand in front of her mouth. Looking like she was in pain.
"You mean months."
"Good? Are you kidding me? It is perfect, Sherlock. Absolutely perfect. I... I just... Well, thank you. I want to thank you. It's very thoughtful of you, very sweet."
"I could pose if you want, so you can work further on your piece."
"Back again?" The soft voice asked him. Sherlock refused to answer. Instead he was trying to get his weight on his toes, so his hands would get some more blood. He already couldn't feel his fingers. He really needed his fingers. They were important.
John was standing in front of the window again, looking out, avoiding Sherlock's gaze. He was quiet.
He really was beautiful. Looking like John helped, of course. His skin glowed, his eyes were a pretty deep blue, and the angel was here just for him. Sherlock had too say it, he had to let this spiritual being know that he acknowledged him. So he braced himself, looked the angel John in his eyes, took a breath as deep as he could and opened his mouth. His voice was raucous, an almost unrecognizable rumble.
"There is nothing to forgive." John said.
"I'm sorry, John." He whispered with a hoarse voice into John's neck.
"Well, what would you like to eat first?"
John smirked at this and they focused themselves back on the case.
John laughed.
John walked with him outside. Standing in front of the hospital, Mycroft gave John a cigarette and handed him a lighter.
Marc chuckled and walked around to face Sherlock's front. Sherlock could see the man had some sort of wide belt in his hand that he used to slap him with.
"Bloody hell, you're burning up. Sherlock, can you hear me?"
It was true. It was something he had never said to anyone, ever. And now he said it. He even said it to a attractive woman who was definitely interested in him. Yes, it was an act, he was supposed to act as Gerald's boyfriend. It was not real. But it was.
"John..."
"Of course. Just promise me not to do anything stupid."
He kept walking. Ignoring the cold now he left without his coat.
"That would be the light of my day! Or week, actually."
John searched the street for an empty cab, got in, and sat with his phone in his hands staring at the screen for the whole thirty minute cab ride. He had been running around for hours. He looked at the time on his phone. It was almost half past two in the morning now. Sherlock had run out on him at eight forty five. Almost five hours ago.
"And?"
"Yeah. Had a nightmare, bad one. Wanted to make sure you were okay."
"Now. Listen to me. There has been an accident at this particular facility."
He remembered that. Good conversation. And the most intriguing player he had ever had against him. Would Moriarty be here too?
"Is John there with you?"
"Hello handsome, good to see you. Alright. I told you I had a sample of brain tissue that I injected with the new serum? It has been in incubation for twenty hours. I hope I can see any difference."
John shook his head.
Sherlock could hear the man walking and ruffling around.
"...I'd rather not." He finished his sentence.
"Christ Sherlock! Stop talking about your balls. It's distracting."
"A bit faith, John. I'm keeping the doses low, so I can think properly. If you'll excuse me, I need to go to my mind palace and analyse my injuries."
"No idea. But this is the only way to find out, isn't it?"
"You're quick."
"My god. Why are those people even trying? Look at this. It's hideous."
Sherlock rolled his eyes at him.
"O, shit! Sorry!! John, are you alright? Oh! Your shirt!"
"Yeah. I figured."
"Yeah. They really like you."
"Sherlock, I don't have time for your childish games. We need your help." The voice at the other end of the line said.
"Are you telling us that there was some experiment that went wrong?" He asked.
"Good night, Gorgeous."
"What? How do you mean?"
They talked. Ava explained where she was now, and told him everything she had found out about the virus. It confirmed the sheets of data Sherlock already had received from his brother. John came back and went off again to get Sherlock equipment he needed, so he could set up a lab at his side of the glass, with a computer that was linked to the machine's in the secured area. That way he could follow every test and experiment that Ava was doing. Every hour or so there was someone from the facility that came to check on them, but both Sherlock and Ava seemed to deep into their conversation to notice that. Deep in the night, with John fallen asleep in his chair, Ava started to yawn.
"We're on a night out. That's all the excuse I'll need. And were not undercover yet. As soon as David comes in, I'm Gerald again." Sherlock replied, and he left John standing at the end of the bar on his own.
"Always?"
"Sherlock? Hey. Are you with me? Keep still. Try not to move."
"That's great!" John said.
They ate and talked. Sherlock joined them again after a few minutes, getting a look from John, which he ignored, and after dinner they talked and drank some more.
Sherlock's lips were plush against his own. Still a bit swollen, but warm and inviting. Sherlock's hand went from the top of John's hand to the back of John's head, keeping him in place and to intensify their kiss. He stroked his tongue over John's lips, asking for permission, and John opened his mouth for him. For the second time their tongues met. And they both felt a sparkle in their body's. After almost a minute, Sherlock's body began slightly to tremble, and unfortunately for him John noticed it. He pulled back.
"So, not in my... absence?"
"Sherlock Holmes."
"Impossible."
"I bet he doesn't. I want to help you. Well, I want to help Sherlock. He did so much for me, it's the least I can do for him. But because you say he never tells you anything, I need to tell you a few things first."
John was silent for a few. seconds.
"Sherlock? No, I can't say I have. Why? Is there something wrong?"
"It's just... I don't know. What do you expect of tonight?"
He asked the smaller man next to him. John looked up at him and smiled.
"Are you painting me?"
"So you're having fun without me, then."
She asked him.
"He will, John."
there was a droplet of rain falling from Sherlock's hair onto his collarbone, rolling down towards his chest, just to follow his path down towards his belly button. He saw the skin shiver where the droplet rolled down, leaving a small wet stripe behind.
Ava threw the ashtray she had on her desk across the room.
"He never shut up about ya, whenever he was 'ere."
"I'm not surprised, really. But this one happened two days ago." Ava said, pointing to her cheek. Then she rolled up her sleeve, showing a bandaged arm underneath. She started to get the bandage off.
"She told me to follow my heart."
"I might, eventually."
"Cheers." He replied and took a sip.
"Sherlock? Hey. Are you with me? Keep still. Try not to move."
"Nope."
The smile came back at John's face, letting Sherlock's heartbeat slow down again.
"Cheers." He said and raised his glass toward John's.
With a small smile on his face, John took a seat in the chair next to the bed.
"Still low tar?"
"Dr. Watson is inside. And they have a one visitor policy. I can wait."
"What kind of accident?"
I really enjoyed writhing this one!
"We do." Sherlock confirmed, taking John's hand in his own.
"Good. Because you and me are going to make sure that this will never fall into his hands, or in anybody else's."
"Me neither. But it has been close. It would have killed him, eventually."
They heard Mycroft sigh.
"I'm making sure we get a confession out of that fucking arsehole before sunrise." She said as goodbye and left.
"Does he do that a lot?"
"Yes. We didn't really get into a fight. I... I kissed him, and he ran off. I really thought he was angry with me."
Sherlock quickly joined John in his (Sherlock’s? Their?) bedroom, flopping down onto John who was already laying on the bed, knocking the air right out of him. “Sherlock-”
John’s hands scrabbled uselessly at the hand on his neck, trying and failing to pull it off of him. He could feel the crushing weight on his windpipe, could already feel his lungs starting to resist at the lack of oxygen.
He groaned and shook his head as he woke up, but when he realized he could not move any of his limbs, he knew something was wrong and snapped into alertness in a second, scanning the room just as Sherlock had done just a little bit ago. His eyes caught on Sherlock and he growled, trying to free himself from the rope binding him to the chair. When he realized he wouldn’t be escaping anytime soon, his gaze snapped to the other man in the room, narrowing his eyes and baring his teeth.
“John, please, John John John John, please,” Sherlock babbled to himself, pushing his palms over his ears to try and block out the sound of John searching for him.
After what felt like an hour, Sherlock had stopped trembling completely, his tears dried, and he was no longer gripping at John’s clothes like his life depended on it. He was limp with exhaustion, and John laid him carefully on his bed, swiping his thumbs across Sherlock’s sharp cheekbones one last time before standing up and turning to leave the room. A hand clutched at John’s wrist before he could get far, and when he turned back around he was met with the sight of Sherlock, sitting up in bed sleepily, holding John's wrist in his too-thin hand. When Sherlock seemed to realize just what he was doing, his face turned red and he layed back down in bed, hiding his face from John. Smiling softly, Watson sat back down on the edge of Sherlock’s bed, resting a hand gently on his shoulder. Flinching slightly at the unexpected touch, Sherlock burrowed his head further into his pillow, trying to dismiss John.
“Stop it!” John faintly heard someone say. He couldn’t tell who, couldn’t tell what direction it was from.
John went under as the burning seemed to consume him completely.
“Don’t tell me she’s-” Sherlock cut himself off, his mouth unable to form the next word.
Sherlock came to consciousness minutes before John did, and immediately wished that John wouldn’t wake up yet, not until he could find a way out of the situation they were in.
Not this time. John was pointing a gun at him at Lestrade’s side, his hands shaking, his chest heaving with emotion.
One second they were laughing, and the next, Sherlock was still and alert, squinting at the top of a building. Before John could ask him what was wrong, Sherlock pushed John against the nearest wall and covered John’s body with his own, tucking John’s head safely into his neck. The next second, gunshots rang out and Sherlock grunted, his body jerking roughly against John’s once, then twice. Panic slid down John’s throat and into his stomach, cold and suffocating.
Slowly, however, things started changing, as things are prone to do.
“I want to retire, John,” Sherlock said softly. “My knee only gets worse as days go by, and I’m finding that I’m getting a little bit too old to be running around London chasing criminals.” John found himself relating to Sherlock; his shoulder was in pain more often than not, and after every case he had a deep-set exhaustion in his bones that took days to shake off. “It’s just- I’ve been wondering if you’ll still love me, when I’m no longer adrenaline and blood pumping wildly through your veins,” Sherlock said quietly, his voice shaking around the words. John felt it like a physical punch and he gasped in a breath, causing Sherlock to flinch, his eyes watering.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock had been kidnapped a week ago. Everyday, his captor seemed to come up with a new technique of torture to try and drive Sherlock up the wall. There had been that chair that he was tied to, with blades sticking through the back of it so that if he relaxed he’d get stabbed. Oh, and that one day, they showed him footage of John that they had gotten from somewhere on repeat. He had to watch all day as John was punched and kicked and spit on, and Sherlock had just about lost it.
Sherlock screamed and screamed, but his voice was muffled and nobody heard. He was almost relieved when the man dragged him to a waiting car and hit him over the head with a gun, knocking him out cold.
“You’ll be okay, John,” Sherlock said, more of a comfort to himself than anyone else. He held John tighter, sobbing as John started trembling violently in his grip.
‘I’ll kill that little pet of yours.’
Sherlock didn’t blame him at all, as he was also revolted by the man in front of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock!” John shouted, panting and struggling wildly in Lestrade’s grip. Just feet in front of him was Sherlock, tied up and being dragged away against his will. They had his hands tied behind his back and were dragging him backwards, pulling his arms behind his back too far, most likely dislocating Sherlock’s shoulders.
“Steel-toed boots?” John said quietly, turning back to look at Sherlock. The man nodded, his gaze still wandering the room, his free hand flitting nervously around his ribs.
“Don’t speak, Sherlock, you’ll make it worse,” John said, his voice shaking as he rocked Sherlock comfortingly, the adrenaline in his system starting to wear off, leaving him feeling hollow and shaken.
“Sherlock…” John whispered, moving to stand in front of Sherlock, the man still not meeting his gaze. “Do you really think I wouldn’t love you anymore?” Sherlock hesitated, his bottom lip wobbling slightly.
When John heard Sherlock stumbling uneasily up the stairs to their flat, he immediately knew that something had happened while Sherlock was out.
“He didn’t think you needed them,” John said back, pushing his legs to go even faster as he heard the men catching up to them.
“Shit, John,” Sherlock hissed out, clenching his thigh tightly in both hands. “I think I broke something in my leg.” John looked down to Sherlock’s leg, twisted slightly the wrong way, his foot still stuck under the root that must have tripped him. Trying not to cause Sherlock too much pain, John felt around on his shin and knee, surveying the damage. Sherlock whimpered and swore under his breath at every press of John’s hands.

“Because, little Brother, I have better things to be doing at the moment,” Mycroft said, his voice clearly full of restrained emotions, something John could understand well. It was bound to happen sometime, when dealing with Sherlock, and Mycroft had been doing that his whole life.
“I’ll wake up soon John, but I think I need to sleep for now. I just need… I’ll see you when I wake up,” he murmurs, his eyes fluttering shut, his limbs going slack. John’s heart dropped as he sped up into a run.
Thank you all for reading!! I hope you enjoyed this one, and as always, I appreciate comments and Kudos!
“Too late,” John said, stepping into the room, not flinching when the gun is whipped around to be pointed at him. He glances as Sherlock and notices a dark look in his eyes.
John was lounging comfortably in his living room, his feet propped up in front of the fire, a hot cup of tea resting at his elbow on the side table. He was reading the newspaper when Sherlock walked behind him, breezing behind his chair in near-silence. John almost hadn’t heard him wouldn’t have if it weren’t for the sound of something smacking into their kitchen table.
Thank you all so much for reading!! You're amazing, I love you all, and don't forget to leave me some comments and Kudos while you're here! <3
Thank you all for reading! I really appreciate all the sweet comments I've been getting recently, you guys are giving me life! Because, as you know, comments and Kudos keep me alive
Faintly, he realized that was a bit not good, but when he felt Sherlock’s hands press roughly against the wound on his leg he hissed in another sharp breath and swore again, groaning from the pain that he could feel creeping into his knee, his shin, his hip.
Sherlock burst into the doors of New Scotland Yard with John on his heels, breathing heavily, eyes scanning frantically over the room. His eyes landed on Lestrade and he hurried over the man, grabbing him by the forearms and pulling him closely, quietly asking, “Do you have her? Dear God, Lestrade, please tell me you have her.” Lestrade opened his mouth then snapped it shut, looking over Sherlock’s shoulder to where John was, a pained expression on his face. Sherlock shook his head in disbelief, his eyes widening.
All he knew was that a few moments later, the pressure on his neck was released, and he was falling, falling, falling…
“Listen, John,” Sherlock whispered in a rush. “There are more men here, and they’re all armed, and that means I need you to get out of here for me right now. Got it? They’ll-“ The sound of boots clunking in the hall interrupted him, and Sherlock cursed, pulling John over to a second door in the room, shoving them both out of it and running down the hall. John could hear them catching up, but he didn’t care, only ran faster.
, John thought,
“Please love, not this time, stay awake for me, okay?” John pleaded, digging his fingers into Sherlock’s clothes. “I need you to stay with me, can you do that for me?” Sherlock shook his head, pressing his face into John’s chest.
Sherlock rambled on as if he hadn’t heard John. “If I had gotten shot in the left shoulder, we could have matching bullet wounds. Wouldn’t that be romantic, John?” Sherlock asked, his voice starting to slur. John could feel the blood starting to seep heavily through the wool of Sherlock’s beloved Belstaff. “I’m ruining my coat, aren’t I?” Sherlock mumbled, his head lolling as John picked him up, one arm in the crook of his legs and one around his shoulders. “I don’t want to have to buy a new coat, John.” Swallowing loudly, John tried to push his panic away.
A pause. Then a minute shake of Sherlock’s head as he sighed and buried his face into John’s chest, his whole body deflating. John gathered up his detective lovingly into his arms and pressed a soft kiss to his hair, swaying them back and forth slightly. “Is this about the little girl?” After another short pause, Sherlock nodded again, wrapping his arms tightly around John’s back. “Oh, love,” John said quietly, burying his nose in Sherlock’s hair.
“No, I don’t want to get up,” he whined, knowing that it would make John laugh. He giggled and smiled before suddenly placing his arms snugly under Sherlock and standing up with the man still clinging tightly to his chest.

Sherlock pressed kiss after kiss to Johns' neck, and with an exhale, all of the tension seemed to leave his body. “I love you, Sherlock, don’t ever think that I don’t,” Watson softly. “Sure, you’re pompous and don’t know how to be kind to strangers. You’re dangerous and you’ve almost given me a panic attack on multiple occasions, but none of that matters because you’re you, and that’s enough. You are enough and I will never stop loving you.”
This was just not on.

Before John could ask him if he was okay, Sherlock asked, “What do you want, Samael?” His tone was biting, which seemed to make Samael even happier, evil laughter spilling forth from his mouth.
“Okay. Yeah, okay,” John said. “Avoid the back for now, right?” Sherlock nodded, and John settled his free hand on Sherlock’s hip, pulling him in for another soft kiss. Sherlock seemed to melt into it, his chest rising and falling steadily against John’s, arms wound tightly around his neck as if he never wanted to move. Taking Sherlock’s bottom lip in between his teeth, John nibbled it gently, causing Sherlock to hum softly and tilt his head slightly, unbothered by the fact that the kiss was crawling along at a slow pace.
A small smile made its way onto Sherlock’s face, and before long, he was digging his fingers into John’s back and giggling quietly. John pressed his lips to Sherlock’s neck as a small smile lifted up the corners of his mouth.
His other hand went to rub comfortingly at Sherlock’s back. Sherlock’s shoulders shook with sobs, and John whispered into his ear to soothe him, almost like what he would do with Rosie when she wouldn’t calm down. “Sherlock, shhh, it’s okay. Stop crying. God Sherlock, you should’ve told me.” John stroked a thumb over the back of Sherlock's neck. Sherlock whimpered softly and slid off his bed, collapsing in a pile in front of John.
“Where in God’s name are you, Sherlock?” John gritted out, pushing himself even faster, watching over his shoulder to try and catch a glimpse of the man that was running after him. John couldn’t figure out the floor plan of the storage building for the life of him, he felt like he had just been running in circles for the past ten minutes, always on the lookout for a curly head of hair.
"Red button?"
Sherlock looked a bit piqued at her but he got up and went for his coat. John watched the scene in front of him. Sherlock wasn't the man to take orders from anyone. But he gave her the same look as he have John when he gave into something that John had said. John looked back at the woman behind the glass. She was getting her things together and glanced one last time on her screen to see what the cells were doing and she looked up at John, a sad smile on her face.
It didn’t take him long to find the small, rickety door at the side of the building and creep in, listening intently for voices and signs of danger. His ears perked up when he heard faint voices, and as he crept closer, he started to make out what they were saying.
“Thank you, John.”
John turned to Sherlock and opened his mouth to say something but was cut off by Sherlock whipping his head up to look at John, his eyes tear-stained, his cheeks red with embarrassment. “I don’t need your pity, John,” Sherlock growled, moving to retreat to his bedroom. John grabbed his sleeve and pulled him close, tucking Sherlock’s head into his chest.
Thank you all so much for reading! I hope you enjoy this chapter, I had a blast with it!! Comments and Kudos give me life <3
his brain finished for him. Sherlock lifted his head to meet John’s gaze, cheeks still slightly red from crying earlier.
He hated this.
He had never felt so relieved to see the red and blue flash of ambulance lights.
John was still trying to get his foggy, panic-filled brain to understand what Sherlock was saying. “I-- I’m a healthy alternative to drugs for you? But how does that work? I don’t physically do anything to you,” John said, shaking his head to try to clear it.
“Are you alright, John?” Sherlock asked timidly, scooting closer to John while promptly ignoring the glass littering the floor. John just smiled and moved his good arm up and cupped Sherlock’s face, caressing his thumb over his cheekbone.
“Honestly Sherlock, would you stop throwing a fit like this? It’s just a short, simple case I need you to take off my hands! Helping me won’t bring about the end of the world, will it?” Mycroft spat, his umbrella handle clenched tightly in his hands. Sherlock, sneering, pushed himself out of his chair and got up in Mycroft’s face.

“I’ve been thinking quite hard about some things,” he managed to say, his eyelids fluttering slightly. John put a hand over Sherlock’s that was resting on the cane handle and realized it was now clenched tightly. His eyebrows furrowed slightly.
“I’ve always wanted to watch someone die of asphyxiation… and now that I’m the cause of it, it’s even better,” the man whispered, his eyes wide. He pushed John against the wall with even more force, a manic giggle spilling out of his mouth. John could feel the blood rushing in his face, could feel the loss of oxygen starting to get to him. The force on his throat was causing pain that was verging on unbearable, and though he tried to command his hands to get this man off of him, his muscles were no longer listening to him.
“Then, I knew it would take you some time to fully forgive me,” Sherlock continued, becoming frantic, his fingers threading roughly through his hair. “I had caused you so much grief, the least I could do was let you take it out on me. Despite my return you still fucking proposed to Mary, and then on top of all of that, you asked me to be your best man at your wedding.” He let out a broken laugh, his fingers tightening in his hair, just short of pulling on it. John was frozen in his seat, itching to move, but not quite sure what to do.
“John,” Sherlock interrupted in a rough voice, “you’re rambling.” The man’s face turned pink as he clamped his mouth shut tightly. Sherlock laughed softly, and John couldn’t help but laugh as well. He was a mess at the moment, but he didn’t care. Sherlock didn’t care. Because it didn’t matter, did it? Nothing mattered apart from them and the time they were sharing at the moment.
“I… I don’t know, John. I just don’t want to be alone,” Sherlock mumbled, looking down at his hands encased in John’s, a familiar melancholy feeling rising in his throat. John hummed in understanding and squeezed Sherlock’s hands even tighter.
“Christ,” John said, settling down in his chair to eat, a grin on his face, “I actually want to eat. I’m
“Enough, Mycroft!” John shouted, stomping a foot on the ground in anger. At least Mycrift had the decency to look a little ashamed of himself, but his face was still mostly engulfed with hot anger.
John couldn’t quite remember how it had happened, or when it had happened. He only knew that he wished he had been paying more attention, wished he hadn’t been so lax.
“Christ Sherlock, are you alright?” John asked worriedly. Sherlock groaned and squeezed his eyes shut, his muscles too weak to sit up and bury his face into John’s neck. “Don’t worry, you’re safe now, just rest.” He felt a soft kiss on his temple as he slipped back into unconsciousness.
On its own accord, John’s head turned slightly, his lips seeking out Sherlocks’. As their noses brushed together, Sherlock gasped in a small breath, his fist clenching around John’s shirt. A breathy laugh escaped from John’s lungs, and before he knew what he was doing, he pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips. The detective gasped once more before sinking into the kiss, moving to thread his fingers through John’s short, blonde hair. Despite the fact that the kiss was far from perfect, John knew it would be the one that he cherished for the rest of his life. Sherlock’s lips were dry and chapped, most likely from repetitive biting and chewing at the soft skin, and John relished in the rough feel of it against his own slightly chapped lips. It just made the moment that much more real.
"Fuck off!" He told David and turned around again.
"It wasn't because I wasn't curious."
David was standing straight up from the wall he had been leaning against. He looked a bit embarrassed when he looked at Sherlock.
"Yes. I figured that. It's just... You're not going to go sit there naked, are you?"
"So?"
"Definitely not. You've been the star in all my fantasies for the last years. I'll manage."
"I don't want to talk about it. But let's just say, that I'm happy that you took this case. It opened a lot of new opportunities for me. I was afraid that I couldn't enjoy this again. But I do. So... Thank you, Sherlock."
John's hands went further down and he began sucking the man's neck, dragging his tongue over that long pale piece of skin, biting him just above his shoulder. Getting Sherlock squirming and begging, just as he liked him.
Ava rushed out of sight, and Sherlock took the opportunity to place his purchased gift for her into the hatch. He felt a bit silly of doing so. It was nothing he had done before. But when she came back, he could see why he did it. This woman was interesting, smart, had a quick mind and he felt some sort of connection.
"Right behind us. Is he going to make it?"
"Hmmm... Won't enjoy it yet anyway. Too sore."
"You'll probably know better than me."
Ava did as he said.
"Don't make me repeat myself. You heard me."
John gave him a half smile.
"Thank you, Ava. See you."
Hello again! Happy easter!
That was also true. Damn! How did he get himself into this mess?
"Sherlock, wake up."
"I told you that I had help from your homeless network to find you, remember that?"
When his cigarette was finished, his head was still working full speed. He needed to make it stop. Or at least slow down a bit.
Sherlock's heart stuttered but John continued.
1 new message:
They talked about their art class, and about Gerald's talent to sit completely still for over an hour. They talked about art models in general, and about the ones that went missing while modeling for their class, and John even ordered them another round.
"That's sounds... painful."
“six weeks now. I'm really bored out of my mind, as you can understand. There's just so much I can do on my own."
"I'm a friend."
'Be patient, Dr. Watson. All thing will come to an end, eventually.'
But after that night, everything had changed. It felt as if Sherlock finally managed to convince himsèlf of being a sociopath, instead of letting everybody else believe it. He was more distant from his feelings and emotions than he had ever been before the fall. The only thing that seemed to matter to him anymore was the work. But John could see cracks in that mask. From time to time John saw a real smile on Sherlock's face, he felt the man's eyes linger to long at him, and he could see joy sparkle in his eyes when John did something stupid or funny. And with every small and careful step Sherlock took to become more himself again, the butterflies in John's stomach seemed to flutter more and more. The last two months had been hard. Sherlock's mask seemed to crack further and further, revealing the true man underneath. His actions were more thoughtful; he tried to take John's feelings into account. He laughed more and John had even seen him blush a few times. When he took on the case of the missing art models, he went even further. Sherlock seemed intrigued with this new side of John he had never shown him before. But getting back in touch with his creative side made him more emotive, affectionate. It was starting to get harder and harder to ignore the butterflies that were just trashing his stomach now.
"Well, that was a deeper conversation than I had meant it to be. You two should go home now. Enjoy each others company. Trust me, I'm a teacher, I know such things."
"No?! You need to take the serum, Ava."
John grinned.
"What?"
"I think we need to wait now. Any other pressing investigation's going on?"
"Christ. He was hitting on you, wasn't he?" John muttered.
"John? Hey! John!"
He shouldn't be up, and definitely shouldn't be walking with crutches with his shoulder, or knee, or ankle. Sherlock didn't care. He sat himself up in his bed, ignoring the pain of his bruised ribs, and he swung his legs off the bed. He reached for the crutches next to the bed and stood up. He stumbled towards John, slowly.
"God I'm pissed. It has been weeks since I had any alcohol, let alone wine like this."
"Good morning gorgeous."
The young man that had talked to me went back with me to the crack house, and offered me some of his stash. He didn't call himself Sherlock at that time, and he definitely didn't look like the posh boy he actually is. Although you could hear it in his speech, definitely upper class. From that time on we became pals, and we both lived in that house for a few weeks together. He talked about helping out the police whenever he was clean, and I told him about my dreams for the future.
"I don't like her, John. I don't 'like' people. You know that. But I do respect her work until now."
"Are you talking about yourself?"
"Hold still. I can't work when you are moving."
"No, he's my friend. And he's missing. I really need to find him."
The man said. Who was that? Why was he here? His head hurt like hell, and his thoughts seemed to spin in his head. Sherlock tried to open his eyes again, but it didn't work. He knew he had to go, he had to try to escape, he needed to find John. Sherlock tried to move again, pain spiking through his body. But then the man (Marc. Marc Jenkins. Art student, mid to end fifties, suspect in the missing art models case. Well, more than a suspect now.) Stamped his foot hard down on the inside of Sherlock's left knee. Sherlock felt something pop and tear, and with a scream he passed out for the fourth time.
"But your'e in quarantine. There's no way to get one to you."
"I know."
John's phone went of. He grabbed it out of his pocket. Mycroft.
"Yes."
"You two start, I'm just going to get some fresh air. Be back in ten."
John hesitated. This woman looked smart, and she was definitely not high. Should he lie? No. Too much at stake.
"Give him the medical attention he needs and you can provide."
John clenched his teeth for a second and shook his head.
"I am. My name is Anahita, Nita on the streets. Why are you looking for Sherlock? What happened? How did you know to come to me? Did he tell you about me?"
John looked at the IV with morphine.
John bent down until his lips met Sherlock's. And very softly and sweetly, trying not to hurt him, he kissed him.
"Oh? You need me? Why? What for? Do you have any credits left to ask for my help?"
"And doctor Watson?"
"No. No, it's fine. You're busy anyway. And I'll find something else to draw."
He had travelled the world, tearing apart terrorist cells, drug cartels, he had caught serial killers, child molesters, rapists. And he was about to die in the hands of a middle aged amateur painter in the middle of London. Beaten half to death, laying naked on the cold ground in his own piss, vomit and blood. Of all the stupid things he had done in his life, this may have been the stupidest. He should have never walked out on John.
"It's quite comfortable, actually, even though it's a bit too posh for me. Where are we going?"
"I'm running a slight fever."
"I told him to sod off just two days later."
"Not that. Being in love."
Passionately.
"I've loved others before."
Was the angel blind? He couldn't move, he wasn't going anywhere.
There was only David smoking in front of the door. The others already back inside.
"At least we got this time together."
"It's not just the Continents. I didn't settle for less than three. I always wanted to show them the stars. If the second orgasm is so much better than the first, why not push it further?"
Sherlock's voice was just a bit more than a whisper, and he saw the small smile coming back at John's face, while he was staring at the flames again. Sherlock looked at the man in front of him. He studied how his face was lit by just the fire in the hearth, a small smile playing on the man's lips. It was perfection. Sherlock felt a sweet ache in his stomach and chest. And instead of repressing this feeling as he usually did, he let it flow over him. He felt his cheeks redding and his heart beat hard against his ribs. The realization hit him. He had been carefully avoiding this. Shutting it out and ignoring it. Keeping his statement of being a sociopath, a machine. But he had been fooling himself for years, thinking that he could control this. After four years since meeting this remarkable man, his feelings hadn't changed a bit, but only had gone stronger. He was still deeply in love with this wonderful, beautiful man.
He was bloody gorgeous. The man in front of him was a personification of sex and lust. He looked like a marble statue out of the Era of the Roman Empire, his skin pale and no body fat in sight. John felt his heart beat in his ears, and when Sherlock's eyes found his, he didn't know how fast he had to look down at the white paper in front of him.
Happy reading! Kudos make me smile!
John grinned at his phone and wondered himself about the trust the genius had in him, when David put down a pint in front of him.
Ava kept silent.
"Mycroft. I found him... Yes, but barely, he's losing the battle. I need an ambulance, right now. And the police. We're in his atelier behind the house. Suspect is probably sleeping inside the house... I'm going to kill that son of a bitch!...Yes, of course... I'll do my best... I will. Just... Hurry, Mycroft. "
"Yes, from Clive. He's the easiest to handle, and he already had a big hole at the back of his head, so I can almost spoon it out." Ava said in the phone while walking towards the back of the lab. She opened the door of the machine and took the sample out with a pair of long tweezers. She sliced a small part from it and put it under her microscope.
When he entered the cafeteria, John looked up at him and gave him a warm smile.
Davis asked him. Sherlock tilted his head.
Not good.
"I'm going in. You're coming?"
"You killed him."
"Yeah. I thought about changing it into a fitness room."
"Yeah?"
Requires ice, rest, and limiting any weight on it. The leg can be elevated to reduce swelling.
John rushed upstairs towards his bedroom and thought about the most disgusting things that came to mind. After his starting erection decided that it wasn't going to challenge the things John was thinking about right now, he set himself to work, getting himself dressed for a proper night out.
"This one, on the other hand, happened thirteen days ago."
"Contagious biting zombies? We're not risking that."
"That would be great. Thank you. I appreciate your help and your discretion."
"You need to buy me a new pack." She said while getting one out.
John frowned at the woman behind the glass.
Esmeralda patted his shoulder and stepped back from him.
"Good for you!"
"Top or bottom?"
"Because, then we would not have wasted all this time, Sherlock."
"Accepted. I do feel myself obliged to tell you one thing before you speak to my brother."
But Sherlock's gaze seemed apathetic, as if he could see John sitting next to him, but didn't recognise him. John saw another shiver running down his friend's body. Quickly he took off his coat and tried to put it over him as gently as he could. Sherlock moaned.
1 new message:
"Most of the time he denies having them."
"I promise." John said, turning around the corner to search for a cab.
I put the gun back into the drawer of the nightstand and closed it again. I sighed and stood up, getting ready to go to work again.
"He's not a flirt."
"I borrowed one from the owners of the hostel. I was bloody worried, not hearing anything from you."
"It's half past two."
"Ava!"
"Me too, Sherlock. Me too." He said in a soft tone, his hands stroking Sherlock's back.
"He came back. Listen, can you ask around for me if anyone seen him?"
"Are we going to smoke?"
"Do you accept commissions?"
Gregory turned towards the elder Holmes brother.
John told him that he had drawn even before he could walk properly. He loved it. His parents encouraged it. But when he got older, his drawings became more personal. He started to draw things that he didn't want to share. It became something private, a way to express himself towards himself, a way to handle the world around him. He kept drawing, but he didn't share it with anyone anymore. It had become his life journal. Some people around him knew about it, but most didn't. He went through High school, carrying his sketchbook around with him, played rugby, studied hard and was a popular boy. He made his parents proud and his sister jealous. Then he went to medical school, carrying his sketchbook around with him, putting his emotions on paper. He studied hard again, was still popular, played several sports. And he kept drawing for himself, never showed his work to anyone. (All did Mike Stamford see some of it, being his roommate, when he left some unfinished work on his desk.) There were girlfriends that wanted to see it, or even asked to be drawn by him. But he had refused every time. He never felt comfortable enough to share it with anyone.
Not good.
"I do. But he fought for it. He's not leaving you behind this time."
John closed his mouth and shook his head, but Ava wasn't finished yet.
"Can I keep you?" Ava smirked, and added when she saw Sherlock's face;
'Be patient, Dr. Watson. All thing will come to an end, eventually.'
"And you said you were married to your work! You should have told me!"
Sherlock just nodded.
In the army it had been even more difficult to keep it for himself. They were packed up together at the other end of the world, there wasn't much room for privacy. Of course some of the boys saw him work, they peeked over his shoulder and asked questions about it. But John always kept them at bay. Telling them to mind their own business and bugger off. As a captain he was out ranking them, and that helped, of course. Although he always managed to be one of the boys. Some of the people he had drawn had seen their own portrait, but definitely not everybody.
John grinned sheepishly at that.
"I need to go, Nita."
"We did."
Silence again. Sherlock could almost hear John's mind working as hard as his own. What did he mean by that?
"Good for you. Well, let's see. You should install skype or something on that computer. I don't have an intercom at the back, and when I'm working there it would be nice if you could join me in that way. My phone has good reach, even back there."
“Ah, finally! I thought you weren’t going to come out and kill him in the process!” The words were infused with fake cheer, but Sherlock saw them for what they were, oozing, bubbling, back sludge pouring from the Irishman's mouth.
“You know, I could stay away from you, but that wouldn’t be very fun, would it? Anyways, you couldn’t get me to run away from you even if you tried,” the man sneered, blood and saliva dripping from the front of his mouth. John gritted his teeth before opening his mouth, but before he could get any words out the man was slamming him against the wall, one of his hands closing tightly over John’s throat.
Sherlock picked up the drink and sniffed at it once more before bringing the edge of the glass up to his lips, taking a small sip of whatever was in the glass. His eyebrows shoot up in surprise and he pulls the drink away from his face before bringing it back in slowly to take another, deeper swing of it.
“Sherl… ock…” John said, swaying unsteadily on his feet, the dart dropping to the ground. Sherlock rushed towards him and managed to catch him before he could fall, cradling John’s head carefully in his lap. The dart was laying just a few inches away, the tip of it coated in a fine layer of John’s blood.
The kiss broke suddenly, the loss of contact dizzying for both men. When John shook the fog out of his mind, he saw Sherlock cradling his injured fist, pressing on some of the raw skin carefully. John internally slapped himself for not remembering to patch up Sherlock’s fist and moved to get the first aid kit. Sherlock stopped him with a firm grip to the wrist, pulling him back down to lean against him once more. “It’s fine, John,” Sherlock mumbled, pressing his face into John’s good shoulder. “It’s not bad. Don’t let it ruin this for us, please, just… I need you to stay here with me, for at least a little while longer.” John nodded and threaded his fingers through the dense curls on Sherlock’s head, something he had dreamed about doing ever since he walked into that lab at Bart’s. Except now, he didn’t have to imagine it. This was real.
“John,” Greg ground out, fighting hard to keep John in his grip. “They have a gun and I can’t let you run after them! Stop fighting me, you idiot!” John didn’t listen, could only hear Sherlock screaming and groaning in pain, his feet scrabbling for purchase on the dusty ground, trying to stop the men from pulling him any further.
, he’d never go shopping ever again), Sherlock dropped the shopping on the concrete and ran into the building, ignoring the law enforcement that were trying to get him to stay back.
When the gnawing hunger didn’t fade after a while, Sherlock ran his fingers roughly over the skin on his stomach, leaving red streaks on his pale skin instead of helping distract him from the pain. He groaned softly and folded in on himself, wrapping his arms around his folded legs, tucking his head between his knees and his chest. He tried humming classical music softly to himself, but the loudspeaker turned on and a voice said, “No no no, Sherlock, you mustn’t make any noise, remember?” Sherlock flinched and pulled his legs in tighter, trying to hold back the noises building in his throat.
