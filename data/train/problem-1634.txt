Another set of stairs proved to be a challenge, though he was appeased when the door he’d come through closed behind him and blocked out most of the noise of the rain. Now his breathing, his heart, and his footfalls were the only things deafening him as he made his way up the stairs, the cold metal of the banister held firm in one white-knuckled grip.
“I swear, you’ve magic cab-hailing powers.”
“I’m getting my degree in chemistry.”
Sherlock glanced towards the front of the car, and his smile dropped immediately when Lestrade’s eyes searched him carefully, almost knowingly, in the rearview mirror. Sherlock’s own eyes narrowed defensively. “Shut up.”
Sherlock gasped as he took a step back, his back hitting the wall and his hands scrambling for purchase on the smooth surface behind him as he looked around frantically; he was still standing, but it felt like his head had hit the floor. “What the fuck is this?” he asked on a hurried breath, eyes wide and frantic.
Blessington had with those Russian blokes earlier in the day, then I have to consider the rest of this evidence as circumstantial.”
it seemed like such a grand piece of information. Nevertheless, Sherlock tucked the detail away in a folder that sat on a familiar deep, black cherry stained oak desk, in a new, small room in his Mind Palace with two twin armchairs and the lingering scents of tannin and cheap, but subtle and pleasant cologne.
“Well,” the DI said with raised eyebrows and a heavy sigh, “looks like he won’t be needing your help anymore; he’s dead.”
Sherlock rose precipitously, and didn’t look anywhere in John’s direction in favour of the door, which he swung open brashly, and proceeded to stride through the lobby and to the main door, much to the surprise of John’s secretary, and much to the dismay of John and Greg, who both watched Sherlock exit with wide, startled eyes and agape mouths.
“I’d like to make it at least twenty minutes into the party without blacking out,” he retorted, and tipped his head towards where he knew the kitchen to be; the location was made obvious by the white-yellow light emanating from a place across the room that looked to be the only actual light in the place that was turned on and not filtered through a plastic, coloured lens. “Speaking of; care for a drink?”
“Yes. That,” Sherlock agreed with a nod. “Ah. Yes. East. This way.” He gave another stunted nod and turned to resume his stride down the pavement, and despite the fluttery feelings in his chest and stomach, he found himself growing more confident and more focused with each step, and he smiled unabashedly when he heard John’s laughter from behind him as the man moved to catch up.
John looked dubious as he leaned against the counter. “Okay… Can you give an example?”
sass, either. He also decided that he probably didn’t like her much.
“Mm, I can see that,” Irene hummed, flashing both boys a salacious grin before waving them away with a flippant flick of one wrist. “Go, then. You boys have a good night,” she finished with a wink, and Sherlock didn’t even wait for a farewell from the other two women before he was tugging John along with him and heading for the front door.
“So you’ve mentioned,” Sherlock murmured, but he didn’t look terribly pleased. “Not clever enough to have saved an innocent man from being killed by the very men he hired for protection. After he hired
,” the man in blue said sharply, his weaselly face contorting into a distasteful expression as one white-gloved finger pointed at Sherlock threateningly. “I don’t want it contaminated. Got it?”
Sherlock tilted his head towards a green bottle sitting on the little shelf in the corner, and John reached for it as Sherlock moved the luffa over his good shoulder and across his neck. John deposited a bit of pearly fluid in his hand before replacing the bottle, and with a cheeky grin, reached up to rub his hands into Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock chuckled, carefully cleaning around and over the scarred front of John’s shoulder with tender precision.
“Key to the flat,” Sherlock supplied, and John beamed.
“Why can’t you?” John challenged simply.
“Come for your things then, Sherlock?” Irene asked, opening up her purse and pulling out a white carton, a lighter, and a wallet to hand over to him.
“So.” John moved to sit in the empty chair with a soft sigh, making himself comfortable before looking up at the young man before him with a small smile. “Sherlock, was it?”
“Nice to meet you, Irene, Sherlock,” he said, and Sherlock wasn’t sure that his name had ever sounded so nice on another person’s lips.
“No,” Sherlock responded, brows furrowing just slightly. “You just look… exhausted. Uneasy. You’ve had far too much coffee today, you had to use your cane to get to work, and you were shaking this morning; you nicked yourself with your razor,” he said, one long-fingered, pale hand coming up to ghost his fingertips over a spot on his own cleanly-shaven jaw.
The comment had her rolling her eyes, though her cheeks did tinge the slightest shade of pink as she came forward, hips swinging suggestively and heels clacking against the hardwood floor. “Ah-ah-ah, you don’t get to come crawling back now, Johnny Boy,” she teased, and brushed past him to grab the finishing touch to her costume - a stereotypical nurse’s cap of white with a centred red cross.
for this man. As the depths of their love for one other.
With his post-work routine finished, John shed his jacket to place over the back of his desk chair and made his way to his bed, sitting down with a soft groan of relief and toeing off his shoes, kicking them off to the side once removed. The bed under him wasn’t extraordinarily comfortable; it didn’t give much support, the sheets were low thread count, the duvet being one John had used throughout university and had put away in a storage unit when he’d gone to war. But John didn’t mind - it was better than his cot in Afghanistan by a long-shot, so he was by no means complaining.
Sherlock doesn’t know what John is thanking him for. So he just breathes a soft “thank

Sherlock leaned his head back against a shelf. “Well. While I’m not entirely
Four car doors opened and slammed shut in tandem and a series of voices John couldn’t make out accompanied the sounds of feet hitting the ground. He could just barely make out the sounds of a set of keys jingling through his panic when he was tugged by the arm, and he turned to find the circular beam of Sherlock’s small torch flying frantically around the vast space of the inside of the warehouse. Just as a pair of feet plodded around the ground just on the other side of the door and a clumsy hand fumbled with the doorknob, the doctor was pulled roughly around and to the ground. He landed on his arse pressed close to Sherlock, and looked to see the man’s torch turn off just as the door they’d come through swung open.
“Dammit,” John murmured to himself, though he was grinning madly as he hastily followed.
“Ah, no. I’m not- that is, we’re not together,” he amended.
They were both silent for a few long moments, before John cleared his throat and, smiling shyly, began to speak. “So-”
“-come out with it, John.”
“I learned from the best,” he said with a quiet smile, before turning and stripping off his briefs (which John admired in the reflection of the mirror over the sink with a private grin), before reaching into the shower to turn on the tap. “Besides, you have a therapist anyway,” he quipped before stepping into the shower and tugging the curtain closed, leaving John unable to argue and instead chuckling to himself as he turned on the sink.
A week after what John had come to remember as quite possibly the most interesting, entertaining, and perplexing intake session of his career, found the ex-army doctor ambling casually through the quad outside the hospital and his practise, on the way back to work from his lunch break.
“Please, your life hasn’t lacked excitement. You went to war,” Sherlock said.
it’s a crime scene,” John tried between his own bouts of quiet laughter, chastising both himself and Sherlock for their immaturity - however well-merited. “
“Not good?” the other asked, nursing his own beer.
“Brilliant. We’re here!” she nearly squealed as they neared a fenced-in garden filled with people loitering about in costumes - or what passed as costumes, Sherlock thought as he glanced at a man wearing pineapple-themed shorts, a shirt with pineapple print, and pineapple-shaped sunglasses - all smoking cigarettes. Sherlock envied them as he was pulled past the haze of cigarette smoke and through the front door of the house that the garden led to, and he found himself pulled from the reasonably-calm chill of the night and shoved into a space that was thrumming with sound and heated by the sheer number of bodies which inhabited it. A guttural groan of dissatisfaction was swallowed up by the thumping bass, much to Sherlock’s dismay, as he was pulled eagerly by Irene through the initial crowd.
“It’s fascinating,” the younger man said on a careful whisper, a curious hand rising between them to let gentle fingers brush across the prominent webbing on the outskirts of the starburst marring John’s skin. “Beautiful,” he continued, and something in John’s chest shattered.
“Hullo,” John responded, still a bit taken aback.
(See the end of the chapter for
it, fuck’s sake,” John laughed with a shake of his head.
“You can’t rush perfection.”
“What,” Sherlock said, his smile audible in his words, “drunkenly snogging in a broom closet?”
John noticed something in Sherlock’s eyes light up at all of the information that had just been divulged, as if it had confirmed whatever he’d already known, or as if hearing it all together connected so many different facts in his head. He swore, if Sherlock were thinking any louder, he’d give away their hiding spot.
“She didn’t give you much trouble?”
“There’s someone else-
Third and final order of business: The past few weeks have been hectic because of work and back-to-university nonsense. Bear with me while I attempt to get myself on some sort of schedule again. Thank you all for your patience with me and my inconsistent updates. I appreciate you more than you know.
The pair worked, John thoroughly lathering Sherlock’s thick locks, the heady scents of eucalyptus and mint overpowering the lavender of the body soap, Sherlock cleaning meticulously under John’s arms and down his torso. Then they traded; John took the luffa and gingerly but thoroughly cleaned over Sherlock’s shoulders and pectorals as Sherlock began scrubbing shampoo into John’s hair. John’s scalp tingled as it was massaged, and he hummed as he dragged his soapy hand over Sherlock’s ribs, caressing the jut of one prominent hipbone with his thumb. He carefully cleaned around Sherlock’s groin, and stepped closer so their bodies were almost touching so that he could reach around and wash the man’s backside. He grinned mischievously up at Sherlock as his hands curved around globed flesh and squeezed injudgently, and Sherlock huffed through his nose, a slight smirk curling the corner of his lips as he gave a playful tug of warning to John’s hair.

“Where did she crash?”
was the cause of the prickling threat of tears behind his eyes, the bile rising in his throat, the tremour that seemed to stem from the marrow in his bones. The all-encompassing dread that he couldn’t help but feel, even though he knew it wasn’t right. He knew he was in his flat in London; but every alarm was an air raid siren. Every sudden bright light was a detonated IED. Someone dropped a heavy book on a table, and to him it was a flashbang.
Something about Portugal. And Hemmingway. And Toby. Right?
“Um. Should I go back to my flat and get ready?” he asked tentatively, unsure if Sherlock had any other unspoken
Anyway, thanks for reading, and I'll see all of your shining, beautiful faces back here next Saturday!
Before John realised what he was doing, he found himself reaching for a syringe and snapping the needle off of the end, and then reaching for another and giving it the same treatment, before tossing them into the rubbish bin by the sink. In his mind, he justified his actions by telling himself it wouldn’t do Sherlock any good to work with him through his detox, only to put him back in an environment with drug paraphernalia strewn about and easily accessed. After a few minutes, a neat accumulation of needles and syringes and plastic baggies had found their way into the bin, and John sighed tiredly to himself as he made his way into the small, adjoining bedroom.
Best,
Rosie takes a brief moment from her guttural wailing to gulp for air, gasping as her tear-filled eyes look at the door to the flat longingly. “Daddyyyy,” she moans miserably, voice catching on a pathetic sob.
us on this case, but do not go out on your own. Are we clear?”
“It’s for
Sherlock, in response, just grinned and hummed lowly, and John, unsure of how to continue, fell silent.
Their breath mingled in the scant space between their faces, and Sherlock caught traces of wheat and barley with an underlying tone of leathery cologne in the air they shared. John’s forehead brushed against his again and Sherlock opened his eyes -
“Oh, you know,” John mused as he removed his own. “Breakups. Exam stress. Traumatic relative deaths.”
Upon opening his eyes, Sherlock was met with the sight of his doctor kneeling before him, a paper cup of water in one hand, an orange bottle in the other, and a look of concern on his face.
“Oh, um… Yes,” Molly said, her smile returning. “He’s brilliant. Really, brilliant. Thank you for asking.”
“Younger than thirty years old,” Sherlock dismissed with an irritated flick of one wrist in the air, “and yet you are apparently less adept at using technology than my

- and was now making a cut in the layers. The slit-throat effect was finally beginning to take shape.
John and Greg stood by the door, Greg seeming to resignedly accept the fact that Sherlock was poking about the room wearing his street clothes and a pair of gloves, while John watched Sherlock with rapt attention and fascination as he fluttered about the room:
“Aye, they prolly think you two are in good ol’ Mother Russia,” a third voice supplied, words drawn out and heavy-laden with a severe Cockney accent. “And we dinnit even left a tag on this last one, so they won’t even know it’s us.”
“We will,” Sherlock chirped, striding forward, and John followed eagerly. Then, as they passed the DI, Sherlock turned to look at him. “Oh, and you may want to put
“Uh.” John pauses. “Dunno.”
Thankfully, the rain had let up - if only a touch - since he’d last been outside, and John was able to stick close to the sides of the buildings as he made his way down the pavement to avoid the worst of the downpour. As he hunkered down in his jacket, chin tucked into the neckline and hands buried deep in his pockets, he let his mind wander on the subject of Sherlock.
“Well, because you’re not well-off-”
“Twenty-eight.”
” Sherlock said, teasing.
“Yes, I’m- heading home,” he said, knowing he didn’t sound quite as confident as he’d intended to, but John’s hand in his own grounded him.
“Jesus,” John said, bringing a hand up to dab under one eye once he’d regained some semblance of control. “That is incredible. Wow.”
Ten minutes later, the pair of them exited Irene’s flat, Irene strutting triumphantly down the pavement with Sherlock trailing along beside her, his arm locked hopelessly in hers, his other hand at his mouth as he picked at and grumbled about his new fangs.
Sherlock had spent more time in and around this new room than he cared to admit. And while the time he spent in there certainly wasn’t devoid of mulling over the finer details of John Watson, the space was dedicated to more than just a fanciful borderline-obsession; the room, and its atmosphere, brought about a sense of serenity and security that he otherwise lacked. It had proved, thus far, to be an almost therapeutic place where the detective could pour over case details; and while the John Watson in his head was no match for the real thing, this figment still wasn’t too bad of a soundboard for Sherlock to bounce ideas off of.
“It was,” Sherlock confirmed, and John heard a rustling of paper as well as Sherlock’s footsteps as he pulled on and laced up his shoe. His attention was derailed by the
He was met with thumping bass that nearly drowned out the melody lines of the music, and dimness which was periodically cut through by coloured lights as a couple disco-ball lights rotated where they were fixed to the ceiling in various places. Nerves already settled by the small bit of alcohol he’d consumed, John confidently pushed through the throng of people already dancing and mingling and drinking, Mary close behind him, and it wasn’t long until they ran into a familiar face.
It was the exact same room as earlier, and there was no stereotypical, blood-curdling scream in the background. The only differences in the room this time were that there were a few ultra-bright florescent lights on stands in the corners of the room, there was a piece of rope that was tied to the bare rafters of the ceiling that was frayed at the end, and there were a small number of people draped in blue milling about, talking in hushed tones, jotting down notes, going about their own business. It was quiet, but not excruciatingly so; for all intents and purposes, it was a rather calm atmosphere.
spend thirty minutes on your coiffure?”
Anderson’s and Sally’s faces were both comically stricken, Sally’s gone a bit pale, though she still had it in her to look defiant, and Anderson’s face rather mortified before he schooled his expression. “Now, listen,” he said hurriedly, waggling his finger at Sherlock, “whatever you’re trying to
“I’m waiting for someone.”
“Sherlock?” he summoned quietly as the sounds of tires crunching against gravel grew nearer, and he chanced a glance over his shoulder to see Sherlock still faffing about with the fucking doorknob. His heartbeat grew louder in his ears and his hands tightened around his gun when he looked back to see the car had crossed more distance than he’d anticipated. “Sherlock.” He took the smallest step back with one foot, though he kept his eyes on the car, not daring to run until he heard Sherlock direct him to do so. But

“He got most of the goods earlier in the day, didn’t he?”
He watched John’s eyes rove over the pair of them; starting at Irene, giving her a quick appraisal, before moving to Sherlock himself, and he could feel his body heating up where John’s eyes fell - starting at his feet and moving up his body until they locked eyes. John’s ocean blues looked momentarily startled, before a rosy blush coloured his cheeks and he averted his eyes to look at the alcohol on the counter. “Well,” he said, and cleared his throat, “I don’t know about anyone else, but I’d like a drink.” He reached for one of several bottles of beer that had been put out when Irene suddenly spoke.
and take responsibility for his past. Even if it killed him. Which it did.”
“Hm? Oh, yes, you probably should,” the detective responded, and stepped to the kerb, throwing one gloved hand in the air - which was interesting, as John hadn’t seen him put gloves on. “Bring your gun,” he added with an air of nonchalance as a taxi miraculously materialized seemingly out of thin air beside where Sherlock stood.
“I- thank you,” John managed after another moment, genuinely touched by the statement.
He closed his eyes in preparation for the familiar feeling of calm and sharp focus, but when Victor pulled the tourniquet off of his arm and retracted the needle, something felt off. And then Sherlock opened his eyes to see Victor’s shit-eating grin. And then the room tipped sideways.
to solve this case. A day spent in John's flat, however pleasant it may have been, was a day wasted. Deciding he'd rather be found out than be confined to bedrest, Sherlock let out a slow, steady, fortifying breath. “I deeply appreciate your concern… but allow me to put your mind at ease by informing you that the heat has less to do with my affliction, and more to do with this proximity, as well as this physical contact.” He held his own breath, his heartbeat thudding in his ears in the silence. The doctor’s hand went eerily still and Sherlock could have
And he does.
clear just what Sherlock was interested in. “Get ahold of yourself,” he grumbled, “you’re a
What Sherlock could see of John’s profile from his peripherals turned absolutely scarlet at the insinuation, and Sherlock would be lying if he said his own cheeks didn’t gain a rosy tint as well. “Oh- no, I- um-” John tripped over his words, and Sherlock found it impossibly charming, however inconvenient it was.
No one cared
“She’s looking for a rebound, evident by the vibrant shade of red on her nails and lips… but she’s not completely ready to let go of him. The small, heart-shaped locket around her neck could be from a family member, but every time she looks at another man, she bites her lip and her free hand moves to fiddle with the locket. So, he left her. Sentiment, she would have gotten rid of it if it were the other way around.” He finished and let out a long exhale through his nose, jaw setting as he readied himself for the inevitable outburst;
“Whatever.”
“Shut up, you,” Pavel growled through gritted teeth, and Sherlock let out a feigned whimper - but his eyes, fixed on John’s, were clear - almost
Sherlock scoffed. “Hardly,” he murmured, and turned around to see a young boy in rather tattered clothing, face marred with a smudge of dirt, ratty, dirty blond hair shoulder length and looking in desperate need of a wash, sitting on the bottom step of the pagoda with a cup in his small hands. Giving a small smile, Sherlock made his way down the first few steps, and hopped down the last two, and ignored John’s curious eyes as he approached the young boy.
“You’re thinking… that you had a brilliant time last night,” the man said, taking a step forward and cocking his hip against the bench, resting there with his hands cupping his coffee to his chest.
“Good idea,” Lestrade murmured as he turned another corner.
He retrieved his phone from his pocket, ready to text Sherlock to ask where he was, when the sound of the door at the bottom of the stairs followed by light footsteps coming briskly up the stairs announced the man’s arrival. John turned to welcome Sherlock with a smile. “Hey, you.”
As he stood admiring himself, Mary had taken up the space beside him, looking in the vanity as she coaxed her blond locks, which she’d grown out to shoulder-length, into soft, loose, ringlet curls with an iron.
Sorry for shattering the illusion. ;)
Hi, everyone.
“Good night,” John whispered as his own eyes closed completely.
“Brilliant,” Sherlock chirped, a skip in his step as he led the way around a corner, and it was then that John realised he had no clue where he was being taken.

Greg nodded. “Great.” He turned to leave, but not before giving John a small wave in farewell.
The doctor set his jaw and clenched his teeth together, a huff of breath leaving him agitatedly as he frowned heavily against his own frustration; a frustration that he recognised all too well as the sort that stemmed from internal conflict. And John knew himself well enough to know just what was causing him his anguish.
“No more than you,” the small boy countered, his innocent expression vanishing as a smirk played at his lips.
“Six minutes?” Sherlock approximated, and put his phone back in his pocket. He was about to tell John that he didn’t
The pair of them remained silent for a short while longer; Sherlock studied the rings and lines in the wooden table while John tinkered around in the room behind him, before the creaking of wooden floorboards underfoot signified the doctor’s approach.
John made another muffled noise, this one conveying pleased yet confused surprise as Sherlock’s lips moved against his own, and it was nothing like earlier; not chaste, brief, sweet - but hungry, frantic,
“Snogging-”
to the chorus of their feet pounding hurriedly down the stairs,
“Yeah, yeah,” the first voice said dismissively. “Warren has the boat ready. But you’ve no reason ta worry, Harley said the cops were crawlin’ all over Heathrow this morning. They’ve not got a damn clue.” There was a rustle of fabric followed by a clink of metal against metal and concrete as the voice trailed off.
, I’m going to fucking
"You didn't have to," John retorted, gesturing vaguely at Sherlock's face. "You're all red, and you've just said it's because of the contact," he said, looking horrified at himself.
To all who have stopped by to read, leave kudos, and/or comment, thank you so much. You're the best. I love you all.
“Hush,” she admonished, though her lips were parted in a smile. “I’m going to look fabulous, and I’ll pop a pair of fangs in,” she explained, and Sherlock snorted.
So he stopped by Sainsbury’s, picking up milk, eggs, beans, bread, jam, a few other odds and ends; just the essentials, really. He didn’t have money for much else. The woman at the queue was sweet; her ruby-painted lips curled into a polite smile when she spoke to him, her long, dark hair cascading down and falling in soft rivulets over her slim shoulders, and John willingly let her distract him from his thoughts regarding his newest client. He indulged in a few long moments of harmless flirting while he swiped his card - he learned she was a new employee, and they both liked the same brand of jam - but it was over quickly and John bade her a good evening with a charming smile and a polite nod, before collecting his purchases in their plastic bags and taking his leave.

“You spoilt brat.”
"The hell are you on about?" John asked.
Sherlock stewed where he sat and remained silent, slim arms crossing over his chest as his eyes attempted to burn a hole through the door.
Sharp verdigris eyes locked with John’s at the end of the narrative, and Sherlock’s body appeared stiff, anxiously awaiting a response from the doctor. For John’s part, all he could do was stare for a few long moments, before puffing out an almost startled breath of laughter, and he shook his head as a smile formed on his face. “There you go again,” he marveled.
“Yes. You want to get clean,” John surmised.
But isn’t that what they always say? Hindsight is 20/20?
Until he saw the time, glaring at him menacingly from the upper right-hand corner of his phone screen. It was half-eleven. The realisation that he had apparently been rummaging through old news articles for nearly two hours had John’s fatigue suddenly hitting him like a lorry. A quick glance at the television revealed that the news for the day was over, and the screen was simply showing the forecast for the next week, with soothing music playing in the background. The digital clock on his nightstand blinked teasingly at him, reading 11:34 PM, and he sighed dejectedly, knowing that he had to get up in just over six hours.
“I’m going to stop you there,” John said before Sherlock could go any further, and Sherlock, obediently, fell silent at the firm and determined tone of the doctor’s voice. “Sherlock,” he addressed, and the detective could hear the man shifting his weight between his feet, along with a slight rustling of fabric signifying a change in posture. “I won’t lie and say that coming home to you lying in my bed
the killer was found. So long as they had been taken into custody and brought to justice, the public appeared satiated. John would bet his next paycheck that hardly anyone actually read the articles in their entirety; he would be lying if he claimed to have read them himself, before tonight. He had seen the headlines of the news stories come up on a news feed: “Killer Strikes Again,” “Another Homicide Shakes Central London,” “Murderer Still At Large,” and finally, “Serial Killer Apprehended.” And he’d thought, “what a shame,” and then “what a relief,” respectively, and he’d gone on with his day.
“Bit warm,” John said in a mumble, and Sherlock just hummed in response, savouring the contact until John pulled his hand away; and while the prolonged contact could have been seen as excessive, Sherlock was willing to forget entirely about professionalism for the moment. “You’ve been awfully twitchy,” the doctor continued, and Sherlock opened his eyes again to see the concern clearly written in John’s expression.
His wandering fingers found their mark and a dim, exposed light bulb flickered on overhead, illuminating the small foyer. On the wall adjacent to the door was a series of hooks, each adorned with a jacket or coat or scarf or bag, and it appeared Sherlock had run out of hooks because a few jackets and bags had found a place scattered on the floor in amidst several discarded pairs of shoes and boots. John sidestepped the small pile of garments and headed into the small kitchen, and he had to hold back a groan when he turned on the light. The detritus that was scattered on the kitchen table and over parts of the countertops painted a picture of very recent recreational drug-usage; several syringes were strewn about, small bags that clearly used to contain white, powdery substances, and a dirty metal dish over a Bunsen burner that John didn’t have to be a man of science to know
“My deodorant?” Anderson asked, sounding as lost as John felt.
There it was. Sherlock took a deep breath and turned to lean his back against the counter, and he scanned the crowd who stood, unaware of his wandering eyes, mere metres away. His iridescent gaze fell upon a young woman in a short, tightly-fit dress that was white across her chest, orange over her midsection, and yellow at the short skirt. Her black hair was short and styled, shaved on one side, and she stood shifting her weight between her feet which were clad in strappy, black heels. Over her right shoulder was a small, white purse. In her left hand was a red cup, which she steadily sipped from with rose-red lips.
Hey everyone! Just a heads-up regarding my update schedule; I am moving to one update per week, which will happen on Saturdays. Thanks for reading, and I hope to see you all back here next week.
Poor Sherlock just keeps getting guns pointed at him.
“Doctor Watson! How are you, mate?” Lestrade greeted, and Sherlock rolled his eyes heavily at the over-abundant enthusiasm - though he was placated slightly by John’s happy smile, which he caught out of the corner of his vision.
The curly-haired man’s cheeks flushed slightly. “Well. Most find me abrasive at best,” he supplied, averting his eyes to study the array of liquours on the counter.

, he reminded himself, and he closed his eyes tightly against the apparitions that danced through his agitated thoughts. Trembling hands fisted his mangled sheets while unsteady, shaking breaths passed between his lips as he forced himself to calm down. After a few long minutes of carefully-measured breathing in a feeble attempt to pacify his racing heart and mind, John swallowed thickly and dared to open his eyes again. His vision swam once more and he could almost taste the threat of nausea creeping its way up his throat, so he pried one hand away from his sheets, knuckles white from gripping and aching in protest as his fingers reluctantly released their firm hold on the duvet to fumble for the light switch on his bedside table lamp.
He’d made it a point to be involved in as little as possible when it came to extra-curricular activities, and he’d succeeded his first and second years at uni. Now, in his third year, apparently Irene had grown tired of not being able to boss Sherlock around at all hours of the day, and had thus decided that he was going to be her “date” to a Halloween party.
Just a quick note to you all: be sure to check the tags periodically for added content warnings as new chapters are added.  Thanks so much, everyone, and I hope you enjoy.
going to be receiving my monetary compensation from him, I think he owes it to me posthumously to at least keep me occupied by letting me find his killer.”
John huffed again, hands falling and clapping against his own jean-clad thighs. “And it
,” John exclaimed, though thankfully in hushed tones so as to not draw attention.
Mind made up, Sherlock carefully walks across the floor in his stockinged feet to retrieve his mobile from the sofa before ascending the stairs as gracefully as possible so as to not jostle the sleeping toddler in his arms, and he shoulders open the door at the top of the landing, not even turning the light on as he carefully creeps inside the room. It feels like he’s invading John’s privacy; which is strange, because he’s never felt that way before whilst rummaging through his flatmate’s things. But he pushes the thought aside as he approaches the cot, and he reaches into it with one hand to pull back the miniature blankets before gingerly, carefully lying Rosie down on the small mattress. Her eyes open slightly, and for a brief moment Sherlock panics, getting ready to start singing again - but the moment passes as her eyes fall closed again and her small lips part with her gentle breaths. Sherlock lets out a soft breath of his own as he reaches down to cover Rosie with the blankets, making sure she’s tucked in, before he turns towards the rest of the room.
With a shaky exhale, Sherlock raised a tentative hand to rest against John’s chest, just over a tear in his battered jersey, and the heat that radiated from the spot of contact grounded him. He began to move, reservations swept away with his inhibitions as the alcohol in his system took its course. His hips swayed, knees bending, body moving where John’s hands gently guided him. His other hand found its way to John’s waist, much to the other man’s delight, if the grin that spread across his face was any indication.
Sherlock blinked and bit the inside of his cheek before taking a breath. “I actually… Well. Play for my own team, as well.”
John’s hand had stopped moving, his eyes wide, and Sherlock noticed. The brunette looked between John’s eyes and John saw the moment the younger man began to panic.
“Gesundheit,” Greg quipped, and John had to bite his lip to stifle a grin at the remark combined with the eye-roll Sherlock gave that threatened to make his irises disappear.
When he’d checked the gun earlier in the day, there had been four bullets left.
Irene’s laugh filled the room as she turned to appraise herself in the mirror. “Of course not, darling. I’m trying to look appetizing; not ancient.” She brought a hand up to where she’d tucked her dark tresses into a beautifully effortless-looking updo with a modern take on Victorian elegance to tuck away a stray hair that Sherlock didn’t believe was actually there; she’d doused herself in enough hairspray to make his eyes water just by standing next to her.
“Greg,” the DI deadpanned, turning his head back to look at Sherlock.
Sherlock knew was beyond John, but it was clear that Sherlock knew - and when he met the man’s eyes again, he could tell that Sherlock knew that
“Sorry,” John apologised again, averting his eyes. “I’ll shut up.”
“You think he would have come forward about his past?” Sherlock asked dubiously, “and risk facing the same fate? Not a chance.” He huffed, slumping back in his seat. “Blessington was spineless. He turned in his former leader with no prompting and ran away from his life; granted, it may have been in the name of justice rather than out of fear, but it still stands that he would never be willing to come to police
; and John smiled softly and nodded in understanding. The small smile that took hold on Sherlock’s face was triumphant, and John’s chest swelled with pride.
Ah! It’s
John’s concern grew. Now that he mentioned it, Sherlock was looking a bit peaky. “Mm. You okay to make the trek to the road for a cab?” he asked gently as he slowly slid down off the ledge and stood before the detective, who took a fortifying breath and nodded.
“Third Suicide Victim Supports Serial Suicide Theory,” John said, brows furrowing as he read the headline underneath Sherlock’s pointing finger, a short article lining the side of the front page. He looked up. “There’s been a third?”
At that moment, movement from the door of the complex they were parked in front of drew their attention, and John appeared, hands tucked into his pockets and hurrying towards the car with an unfairly adorable and quirky smile on his face. Sherlock couldn’t help but smile back out the window, even though the doctor likely couldn’t see it, but his concentration was broken by Lestrade speaking again.
“You’re more original than that,” John said, only mildly chastising.
these leads to the detectives at NSY. And still, he remained nameless, no proper credit being given.
“I know asking you to behave yourself is a tall order,” John tried quipping, though he was met with another eye-roll, “but I think we’ll both enjoy ourselves a bit more if we both keep a level head, hm?”
With John in the lead, they emerged from the thickest part of the crowd and wound their way through other mingling groups of people before they came to stand before a door that led under the staircase. Sherlock, pawed at John’s shoulders as John worked the doorknob with a clumsy hand, and as the door opened and he turned around, Sherlock all but tackled him back into the dark room that had been revealed, hands clutching at the fabric of John’s jersey.
John sighed indulgently, blinking his eyes open blearily to look at an unfamiliar ceiling with a small smile. His head was mildly aching, an unfortunate side-effect of enjoying five glasses of rich, red wine over dinner, and his muscles protested John’s mere existence; an unfortunate side-effect of a passionate night of lovemaking. John found he didn’t mind in the slightest.
John was in high spirits as he packed his laptop into its case and slung his messenger bag over his shoulder. He bid Rachel farewell as he passed the receptionist’s desk on his way out of the clinic, and he greedily filled his lungs with the crisp, late-afternoon air as he stepped outside. For once in his life, he felt perfectly at-ease. The puzzle pieces of his chaotic life that had once seemed so far out of his reach were finally falling into place; he was working in a field he was growing to love, he was living in a perfectly lovely flat with the man he’d fallen madly in love with
“She’s had a recent falling-out with her former fiancé,” Sherlock stated, and John’s head whirled about in his peripheral vision to look at him.
“How much time have you got left?” John asked, and Sherlock’s brows knitted together as he reached into his pocket with the hand not preoccupied with holding his drink, pulling out his mobile to glance at the time.
out, Dr. Watson.” John opened his mouth to protest, but Greg held up a hand to stop him. “Hey, I’m not judging or complaining. Far be it from me to complain about
Quickly, John pushed himself up, half leaning on Pavel, and wound up his arm before he hurled his fist at the man’s face with a muted grunt, his fist making contact with Pavel’s jaw and making the man shout- but a moment later, the larger man regained his bearings and hurled a meaty fist at John’s head, and John’s vision swam as he pitched sideways with a stifled sound of pain.
“Then we can find a different flat. I’ve had my eye on one downtown. Nice little place, and the landlady likes me. Offered me a discounted price.” The nonchalance with which he rattled off these facts as if they
“Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you’d go deeper.” Sherlock said in almost a purr, eyes glimmering with mischief, and John narrowed his eyes at the other as he recognised the very same line from when he and Sherlock had been texting about the young woman who’d been strangled to death.
Sherlock grabbed a half-empty pack of cigarettes from one of his coat pockets and drew a smoke out of the pack by the butt, before lighting it cooly with the bunsen burner and extinguishing the small, gas-fueled flame for the time being. He took a long drag, letting himself imagine that he could still feel the burn at the back of his throat, that he could still feel the sensation of the nicotine high that hit after the first drag, that he could still taste the bitter tobacco on his tongue. The smoke that was expelled on his relieved exhale hung in the air like miniature, low-level cirrus clouds, slowly dissipating. Letting the fag hang from his lips, both of Sherlock’s hands moved to nimbly snatch up the two small, clear baggies of white powder; one filled with heroin, the other containing citric acid. He needed no assistance from measuring instruments, as his practised, chemists eye aided him in pouring near-accurate amounts of each substance, with the addition of a small amount of water from a nearby water bottle, into the small, metal bowl over the bunsen burner, which he then ignited.
be spending my time tonight indulging in some recreational substance usage.”
He is completely out of his depth. He is worried about John. He and Rosie both need comforting. And so, entirely on impulse, he does the only thing left that he can think to do.
“Do you have anything to say to other university students who feel their safety is threatened in wake of Laura’s death?”
“Not too sure,” John admitted. “I was following you.”
anyone else?” he asked haughtily, and John fought the urge to roll his eyes and groan.
“He’ll do that,” he said with a smile as he walked past John, headed back towards the building. “You learn to get used to it. He’s a character, he is.”
“Hm?”
“Do you know you do that aloud?” he asked in a murmur.
Not hearing any protests so far, John swiped his tongue slowly over Sherlock’s perineum, before laving the flat of his tongue directly over the most private spot on Sherlock’s body.
As always, thank you so so so very much for reading. I'll let you all know now that we're nearing the end of this story. By the next update I'll know how many more chapters exactly there will be. Until then, I wish you all a fantastic weekend and a great week ahead. Endless thanks once again to each and every one of you reading this. See you back soon. <3
John didn’t have to look to have a good idea of what he’d find, should he get closer; any number of possibilities, protruding eyes, pale face, or perhaps red and swollen, cold skin, blue lips… a part of him was curious, wondering what sort of damage had been done. But Sherlock was at work, and John didn’t want to disturb him.
John quirked a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re… not uncomfortable.” The conclusion lacked confidence. Sherlock merely hummed in response.
“Sorry, sweetheart,” Sherlock said mockingly, a sneer in his words, “maybe next time.” He fisted his pocket for cash.
“One vodka cranberry, coming right up.” John retrieved one of several bottles of clear alcohol and a half-full jug of cranberry juice, and carefully measured out with a practised hand a moderate amount of vodka before drowning it in juice. The drink finished, John handed it over to Sherlock with a smile, and Sherlock thanked him with a nod.
“Oh, just pitch it,” he said, nodding to the dumpster in the lot by the car. “It’s contaminated. No worries, just get rid of it.”
acceptable,” he grumbled resignedly, and Irene smiled.
“Of course,” John said, not bothering to hide the fondness in his voice, and he reached out once more to gently push his fingers through the young detective’s curls before stepping away.
“Oh, and Greg?” Sherlock called again, and the DI looked up wordlessly, eyebrow raising in silent inquiry. “My brother will be contacting you regarding one of the pieces of evidence here,” he said, nodding towards the gun the man had just kicked away. Lestrade followed his gaze and then looked back to Sherlock, clearly puzzled. But when Sherlock proceeded to tip his head to the side, indicating John, Greg’s eyes widened in comprehension. Meanwhile, John went crimson.
Sherlock pretended that he couldn’t feel the warmth radiating off of the other man from this close, just as he pretended not to be dangerously close to leaning into it. “I’m fine,” he responded automatically, turning his head to look up at the other.
“Jesus.” John scrubbed a hand over his face. “So, potential potent DXM-cocaine mix. Whatever it was, it was a shock to your system. You don’t remember most of last night, you wound up in my flat, you’ve no idea how the crash is going to be with this -- And you think I’m going to just let you leave and go home where I can’t watch over you?”
“Fine, alright. Let me know how that shit works out for you; I can hook you up with more anytime you like. It’ll cost you a pretty penny, though,” Victor said with a wink. He sounded like he was under water.
He stopped, slightly out-of-breath, and gaped at the sight that greeted them both:
And what he felt was intense. He was hesitant to put a proper name to it, for fear he would mislabel it and call it something too big too soon; and he wasn’t sure who he was more in danger of spooking with that sort of declaration; Sherlock, or himself.
“Yeah,” Greg confirmed, “we’ve got people looking through everything going into and coming out of Heathrow from around the time of the sighting up to now.”
“Did he, um… What did you talk about?”
Sure enough, when Sherlock approached the monitor alongside the DI, the face of Pavel was clearly visible where the man stood at the queue in the shop. He pursed his lips as he glanced at the timestamp in the corner: 11:52. “Identities were revealed yesterday in the evening,” Sherlock murmured, eyes scanning the screen. “A three-hour flight to Russia… if they
were the one saying that professionalism was no longer an issue, seeing as you’re no longer my patient, by your standards.” He huffed, bringing a hand up to pinch the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger, as though he was staving off a massive migraine.
Greg sighed again and shot John a disbelieving, yet apologetic look. In return, John just smiled reassuringly.
John’s lips pressed together in a tight line as he frowned mildly at the main doorway. “I’m not entirely sure,” he murmured, and stared at the door a few moments longer before shaking his head and sighing, bringing himself out of his reverie. “But they’re gone. And you’re right, office hours are nearly over… You can pack up and leave early, if you want,” he said, giving her a smile.
“This is a
Toast eaten and coffee quaffed, John stood from his chair, holding his hand out for Sherlock’s dishes (he rolled his eyes at the toast crusts left behind on the on the plate - the picky git) and walked them to the sink. “I have to take a shower,” he announced, and turned to find Sherlock slowly rising from his chair with a devious grin. “What?” John asked, freezing with his hands half in the sink, a look of caution on his face.
They burst through into the cool night air, and John chuckled breathily as he had to almost jog to keep up with Sherlock’s long strides. “Eager, are we?” he asked teasingly, and Sherlock grinned.
His voice cut off into a surprised sound when a pair of tanned hands grasped the lapels of his wool coat and tugged, causing Sherlock to stumble forward, his hands colliding with John’s chest in a futile attempt to stabilise himself, and he hadn’t even a moment to process exactly what was happening before his mouth was covered by John’s.
the girl asked again, this time not bothering to hide the malice in her tone.
The remainder of his trek home was uneventful, but John was thankful for it. Overhead, the normally overcast London skies were extraordinarily clear, the scattered and wispy stratus clouds that graced the sky tinged pink and orange by the setting sun. The tranquil scene was greatly juxtaposed to his bleak mood, and any other day, John would be thrilled to elongate his stroll just to enjoy the nice weather. At present, though, he really just wanted to get inside and settle down for the evening. He was tired, and no amount of abnormally good weather was going to change that fact.
Sherlock blinked his eyes open and looked up from where he was standing against a wall with crumbling plaster in a room dimly lit with scattered candles, into the smarmy, grinning face of one Victor Trevor. “Back to the land of the living, are we?” the man crooned, inching closer, and Sherlock fought the urge to grimace.
think, don’t you?” the young woman replied sassily. And, John decided, it wasn’t a very
Sherlock hummed, his head tipping back slightly in a slow nod. “Sister. There’s always something,” he mumbled to himself, before fixing John with a focused stare once more. “Anyway. Your experience?”
A mumbled series of expletives he couldn’t make out sounded behind him along with trudging footfalls as John made his way across the room. The footsteps stopped near the bed, from what Sherlock could hear, and the detective paused in tying his shoe as he pondered a moment.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Greg said, and ran after him. “Sherlock! What in the hell-”

Thanks so much for reading! I LIVE for writing this for you guys. Thank you so incredibly much for existing. <3
Then came the day that John knew to be a week since he’d last spoken to Sherlock face-to-face. The hours ticked anxiously by, John tending to regular clients and casting furtive glances at the clock between appointments, and when closing time finally came, John was crestfallen, having thought that the young man would show; after all, Sherlock had come exactly a week after their first meeting, which was now exactly two weeks ago to the day. When John locked the door of the office behind him and started home, he felt drained; but it was different from the usual fatigue that plagued him after a long day at work. It was a deep, mental lethargy brought on by building anticipation, and the resulting disappointment. Mentally, he kicked himself, knowing that he’d been a fool to think Sherlock would ever allow himself to be kept to some sort of schedule. He didn’t seem like that sort of man.
And it was abundantly clear by the burgeoning tumescence making its interest in the proceedings known against Sherlock’s thigh, that he wasn’t the only one affected by their intimate dance.
Sure, offering up his medical expertise and personal experience in the hopes that he could change a few lives and help a few lost souls wasn’t terribly exciting, but it was
For his part, John just smiled, and he had a feeling it looked a touch too giddy, but he couldn’t really help that at the moment. “That was… absolutely brilliant. Incredible. Jesus, Sherlock—how did you do that? How could you
“You mentioned before that you didn’t
When one imagines walking into a room where someone died, whether it be by suicide, homicide or tragic accident (were one to imagine those sorts of things in their free time for whatever reason), one would probably expect a scene straight out of a horror film: a dramatic, blood-spattered room backlit by the occasional lightning strike seen through the floor-to-ceiling, sheer-curtain-covered windows. A body, lying in the centre of the room, on display, covered in blood.
Sherlock’s grin only grew. “Not people. He used to be a butcher," he explained.
After a silence that stretched on far too long, Sherlock finally spoke. “May I see?”
It was at this point in his inspection of the other that John decided to glance to the side, and as their eyes met, John’s lips curled in a sweet smile. Sherlock returned it without expressly giving himself permission to.
Acting too quickly to properly aim, John pointed his gun at the man taking aim at Sherlock, who was prone on the floor, and he fired. There were shouts of surprise and frustration, and then one of pain as the gun previously aimed at Sherlock clattered to the floor and the man gripped his wounded arm, the grey fabric of the hoodie he wore already growing dark with blood.
“Where we’re headed; Battersea Park. They’re... stationed in Battersea Park?” John asked incredulously, nose scrunching adorably to display the doctor's lack of comprehension.
John’s heart leapt into his throat, though he was careful not to show his disquiet as he felt the car pull smoothly away from the kerb and into traffic. He glanced to the door he’d come in and knew it would be locked without him having to try to open in, and he pursed his lips as he looked out of the tinted window.
John huffs a weary laugh. “I’m sorry,” he whispers back as he lies down to face Sherlock, and the brunette’s expression softens at the realisation that John truly is sorry; the bags under his eyes tell of sorrow and trauma, his eyes lacking their normal luster. He is unharmed… at least, physically.
At that, John rolled his eyes, a smirk taking shape on his lips. He reached with his other hand to pick up his coffee.
Sherlock reels slightly at the topic-change. “Well,” he sighs, “I have a reason to be.” His arm tightens minutely around John. “Two reasons, actually,” he muses with a small smile, closing his eyes as his ears pick up Rosie’s soft breathing nearby.
announced the lifts’ arrival, and the pair stepped in, John rolling his eyes as he did so, before the doors shut. They were deposited on the ground floor of the building and Sherlock, wasting no time, took long, decisive steps - one to John’s every two, he noticed with a smirk - to cover the distance to the front door, and once outside, practically ran to the kerb and threw his arm in the air. Not a moment later, a black car pulled up to the kerb, and John let out a laugh of disbelief.
John frowned. “What? Why?”
“Yeah, I’m fine,” he said, brow furrowing.
wasn’t enough to stifle the pleasant warmth that seeped into Sherlock’s chest and seemed to settle in the bones of his ribcage, however, as he read and re-read the messages. It was unusual to have someone who wasn’t blood worry at all about him. Besides his dealers, of course; but the motivation behind their mild concern for his well-being stemmed from his being a source of income. Never before had Sherlock experienced concern for his livelihood past the obligatory familial sort; his brother kept constant tabs on him while his parents got information through their eldest son. Other than that, as far as Sherlock was concerned, no one cared. No one had cared for a long time.
, the most brilliant man in the world would forget to silence his
“John?” she asked politely in a quiet voice before pushing the door open slightly. She gave him a light, apologetic smile and a subtle nod to let him know his services were indeed required, and he nodded back as he stood up straight and came to the door, following the young girl out and in the direction of the desk.
“Oh. Brilliant,” he said, sliding it into his chest pocket and patting it to ensure its security. He looked back up, turning his smile on Sherlock, who was standing there with a pleased expression. “Thank you.”
anything…” The man’s voice trailed off as he looked between the two men in the back seat via his rearview mirror.
John watched after them before turning back to face Sherlock, and the smile that took over his face made Sherlock’s stomach do a flip. “So.”
“Intoxication would be top of my list, but I know you’ve not taken anything,” John said. “Other than that… embarrassment…”
“Rachel here will actually take care of you, if you’re going to be hanging around,” he said with a nod in the young secretary’s direction, and the woman smiled politely at them both. “In the meantime,” John continued, “it was nice meeting you, Greg. I’ll, um… hullo,” he said, smile soft and kind as he peered around Greg to the very clearly annoyed young man who was staring rather pointedly at the exit. “Would you like to step into my office with me?”
it, he preferred it to the outside. His legs, trembling, nearly gave out under him, and Sherlock, unthinkingly, stumbled to the neatly-made bed, where he threw himself down and landed with his face half-buried in the pillow.
as he practically
“What, you’ve a problem with mine?” John asked, his wounded tone and expression clearly a front.
And it had to have been only a moment ago, because the room wasn’t flooded with police. He could hear their vehicles outside, still not having arrived. Christ, how long was it
“Nosebleeds-”
you worked that one out; somebody told you,” he spat, clearly unimpressed.
“Stop. Stop it, we can’t
“Yeah, that’s girlfriends for you,” he murmured, and Sherlock pursed his lips.
But the afternoon had brought with it more rain outside, and a storm cloud inside that loomed, unseen and menacing, over Sherlock’s curly head. Withdrawal symptoms were steadily beginning to show themselves as Sherlock’s temper shortened like a lit fuse, and while John had known this was what he was getting himself into when he’d offered to let Sherlock stay, he was already dreading what the coming hours and days would bring.
a surprise,” he said, and Sherlock could almost assuredly hear the smile in his voice, “but… if I’m honest, I’m incredibly glad that I did.”
Between everyone in the warehouse, many bullets had flown; and the building acted as a terribly efficient echo-chamber, distorting John’s memory of just how many times a gun had actually been fired. But he knew that his finger had pulled the trigger of his own gun four times.
“Ah, Anderson,” Sherlock greeted, the pleasantry holding plenty of mockery, “here we are again.”
“Oh?” Sherlock leaned as casually as possible against the counter. “Why not?” He nearly flinched at his own question, but apparently he hadn’t dug his hole deep enough, because he kept talking. “You seem like someone who would be well sought-after.”
“So,” Sherlock rejoined, and John’s eyes widened momentarily, looking almost surprised at the sound of his voice, but the expression was reigned in as the other man cleared his throat.
” he corrected adamantly. “You’re alive. They didn’t defeat you.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “He’s more than capable of handling himself, John. And it’s not as though he isn’t compensated well. That ten quid was a down-payment. He’ll collect the rest later.”
Sherlock nodded his head once in affirmation. “I will.” The verbal confirmation made John’s entire body relax with relief, every ounce of tension seemingly melting away before Sherlock’s eyes. The detective wondered at just how much his own safety and well-being meant to the man before him.
“You’re the most agreeable therapist I’ve ever been forced to deal with,” the detective added, and John smiled at the odd compliment.
Home.
that’s cold.”
Sherlock visibly deflated, and John looked at Lestrade as though the man had punted a fucking puppy.
Sherlock’s smirk remained. “You’re thinking that it’s awfully nice of me to make you such a lovely and well-balanced breakfast,” he said teasingly, eyes shifting to the plate of toast still in John’s hand.
“I’m here to see Lestrade,” Sherlock said cooly, and John had to school his features, because he knew that was a lie.
“Right,” he said at length. “Do you, um… mind telling me what this is, then?” he dared to inquire, looking back at the girl, who had yet to look up from her phone.
Since the impromptu breakfast with the therapist, Sherlock had excused himself to the bathroom to relieve himself, and had done a full-bodied examination, pouring over every inch of himself to be absolutely sure he hadn’t neglected to recall something crucial; but aside from a fresh pinprick in the crook of his left elbow, he was unscathed. He wondered at how he’d managed to make it from Victor’s drug den to John’s flat alive, let alone unharmed. Regardless, he was satisfied with his self-inspection and decided it best not to count his blessings.
Mary frowned, brow furrowed with a mixture of annoyance and concentration as she pulled back to sit upright in her own chair in front of him. “You’re the one who wanted to do this,” she accused, waving her spoon, still covered in white, viscous liquid, in John’s direction. “Are you going to let me continue, or are you going to keep up your whinging?” A teasing smirk played at her lips.
better, and more to do with you actually
Sherlock let out a low hum and began pulling at the hem of his shirt to disrobe, which John tried and failed not to watch. “I’ll go first,” the brunette said as he pulled the garment over his head and tossed it into the slowly-growing pile of blood-stained garments, “because I am certain I will fall asleep waiting for you to finish.”
Sherlock sat back in his chair and took what looked to be a fortifying breath, his eyes moving to look unseeingly towards an empty place on a wall. “Do you want to hear from the beginning?” he asked in a mumble.
“Do you
“Show me,” Sherlock demanded, and Lestrade huffed.
The wink he gave John following his advice was unexpected, but impossibly charming to the point where John’s cheeks tinged pink. “Oh. Okay,” he said dumbly, and then, a touch awkwardly, climbed into the back of the cab. The door remained open, and John ignored the annoyed huff of the cab driver in favour of looking up at where Sherlock stood on the pavement, one gloved hand on the top of the door. “I’ll meet you back here tonight, then?” he asked, breaking the silence after a moment.
“Well that makes two of us, then,” John said, his smile bordering on salacious. Sherlock’s throat bobbed with a swallow, and his eyes watched the pink tip of John’s tongue dart out from between his lips to moisten them in a quick motion before he asked: “Can I get you a drink?”
“Alright. Thanks, John,” the girl said with a smile, and began to gather her things.
“I see no reason to believe that the two must be mutually exclusive,” Sherlock rejoined, his grin audible in his voice.
– who loomed menacingly over him with a gruesome grin.
Miracles are on the long list of things in which Sherlock chooses not to believe; it sits right between the concept of God, and medicines that claim to be
“Have you got a tenner?”
“We’re having a stakeout.”
, he self-diagnosed as his vision momentarily crackled black around the edges, and he groaned inwardly - but all thoughts of his own well-being vanished when he turned his head to find Sherlock, white as a sheet, eyes wide, hands clenched at his sides, with the barrel of John’s own SIG pressed to his temple.
- when the man’s lips parted and the soft, pink tip of his tongue appeared to quickly moisten his lips.
He felt
” His head tipped back to clunk against the plaster wall behind him and he let out a pathetic whimper.
“Mmnh,” was the only sound Sherlock made in response.
The smirk that appeared on Sherlock’s lips shouldn’t have looked as teasing as it did. “John, I’m shooting up with cocaine. I hardly think engaging in acts of
This unyielding concern was reaching Mycroft levels of ridiculousness, Sherlock thought to himself as he scrolled through the text messages he’d received from John over the past several days; it was no small wonder that the man’s sandy-blond hair was prematurely greying, if he fretted over all of his patients like this.
“Walk-in?” John inquired, his exhaustion audible in his voice and visible in the small smile he offered her.
“John? Did you pack any decent trousers in that duffle you got from my flat?” he asked as he quickly typed out a response:
“Oh, we can’t have that,” Matvei said, and raised his free hand to hold it out to his side and slightly behind him, palm up in a silent request. “You failed with Sutton, and you will fail with us. Except this time we will not force you to live with your failure,” he said with feigned compassion, and John’s worst fear was realised when one of the other men in the warehouse stepped forward and deposited a pistol into Matvei’s outstretched hand. He should have expected it, but nothing could have prepared him for the painful throb of terror in his chest at the sight of Matvei’s Cheshire grin combined with Sherlock’s sharp eyes widening with barely-suppressed panic as the gun was raised.
He doesn’t really know what any of this means. But he’s brimming with happiness. And he decides, as he relaxes fully into the mattress and into John’s warm embrace, that he’s okay with not knowing tonight. Maybe tomorrow, he thinks, they’ll talk. They’ll wake up in each other’s arms, and John will insist they talk about it, because that’s just something that John would do. Where they go from there has yet to be known.
“Making tea,” the doctor said, as if it were obvious - which it ought to have been, Sherlock thought as he moved across the room to grab his shoes where they sat by the door.
“There are
Her eyes, which looked more green than they actually were due to the deep, subtly-shimmering moss shadow that framed them, met his own in the mirror, and they danced with mirth. “You of all people should know, darling,” she teased as she set her eyeliner down in favour of a pair of false lashes, “or shall we pretend that you
All thoughts of himself vanished, though, when he remembered Sherlock was still in the room - but he couldn’t entirely be blamed for nearly forgetting, as the room was dead silent save for John’s own breathing and the sirens outside. He looked up, wide-eyed with concern, to see Sherlock, whose eyes were even wider than his own, staring at Pavel’s body on the ground. His hair was disheveled from having been grabbed and pulled at by two separate people in the span of five minutes, likely still sticky with the blood from Pavel’s fingers, and in his pale hand was John’s gun; he held it in a white-knuckled grip it by the barrel, having bashed Pavel over the head with the heavy solidity of the butt of the SIG.
at a crime scene he surely wasn’t entirely
John glanced at the side of Sherlock’s face and knew this to be true.
The office, albeit small, was homey - a deep, black cherry stained oak desk stood along one wall, upon which sat his closed laptop, a notebook and pen, and a small picture frame displaying a photo of himself along with some of his best mates from the army, decked out in their fatigues, arms thrown around each other’s shoulders as they smiled beamingly at the camera. The blinding sand of the afghan desert where his platoon had been stationed served as the backdrop for the impromptu photo shoot, and while images of the bone-dry hell that served as his home for three years brought back plenty of unpleasant memories, he couldn’t help but smile back at the men in the picture, including the younger, stronger, happier version of himself.
?” she asked scathingly. “How do
Another minute of self-soothing went by before John concluded he may as well get up; the luminous, viridescent, digital numbers on his alarm clock flickered tauntingly at him, reading 04:27. Not much point in trying to sleep for a measly two hours longer. So he pushed his sheets aside, sweat-damp skin breaking out in gooseflesh when exposed to the tepid air of the room as he swung his legs over the side of his bed. His teeth bared against the violent surge of pain that shot up his right leg when he tried putting weight on it. Cursing silently under his breath, the doctor reached, resignedly, for the cane he kept tucked between his bed and his nightstand for situations such as this, and pushed himself off of the bed, gingerly adjusting his weight on his feet and leaning heavily on the cane for support.
when I’m high.”

John laughed, an adorable, genuine, high-pitched, giggling thing that had Sherlock’s stomach doing flips. “No, no. I did it because- because you're lovely." His cheeks flushed profoundly as he gave the compliment. "And I'm glad you're not complaining. I’d hate for you to complain about it.” His breathing evened out as his laughter died, and after another moment of letting his eyes trail over Sherlock's face, the doctor cleared his throat and averted his gaze. “We should probably…-”
John just smiled. “I reckon I have to if I don’t want you to be miserable.” Relieved at the incredibly small smile he was rewarded with, the doctor gave Sherlock’s leg a gentle squeeze. “Give me your address and a key, and I’ll run and get your stuff; I have to get bread from the shops anyway.”
The sounds of ceramic shattering, along with his wooden cane clattering against the linoleum floor, along with the piercing wail of the car alarm outside that had caused him to react in such a manner without even thinking, had John’s hands flying up to cover his ears as he huddled against the cabinet he’d fallen against.
“Good,” Sherlock whispered, and let out a breath as he settled further into the mattress. “Go to sleep.”
Since John’s grouch-suppressants apparently weren’t genetically passed to his offspring, Sherlock tries offering Rosie all of the things that make
The Russian was all but crushing John with his weight, making it hard to breathe, and by God, there was a hell of a lot of force behind his fist. Said fist was raising in the air, ready to deliver another devastating blow, and John’s hands were pressed hard against the man’s thick neck, trying and failing to locate and depress his carotid arteries - he braced himself for the next blow, knowing full well he would very likely lose consciousness. He just hoped the police got in before the man got to Sherlock-
“Then how do you know?”
follow you home?” An accusatory finger pointed in Sherlock’s direction. “If you need help, just tell us; we’ll jump at the chance to put him down-”
John’s chuckle is quiet, and tired. “Yeah. Me too.” He hums softly. “Wish you would have been there, though. You probably would have gotten through to her better. I was too emotional about it.”
Until then, all my love and my sincerest thanks to you all. And if you'd like a little something to tide you over until then, if you're at all interested, I whipped up a little 3 chapter, 21,700 word something called Allhallows' Affair for the Halloween holiday that I'm pretty proud of. Go and give it a read, if you'd like!
“You’re the one who started it. Don’t blame me,” Sherlock murmured, smile in his voice.
“Please,” he croaked out, unable to remember when his mouth had gone so dry. His head tipped back against the wall behind his chair, groaning when his head throbbed unpleasantly as a result of the mild contact. He listened to the soft sounds of the cup being refilled, followed shortly by John’s gentle footfalls on the threadbare carpet in an easy gait, before the man sat down in the chair next to him.
“I can’t force you to do so,” the doctor said with a hint of reluctance, “but may I ask why not?”
he thought to himself with a grin as he made his way off campus to catch a cab. Normally, he’d be immensely put-off by the idea. But now, he basked in it.
John’s eyes widened, and his cheeks coloured. “Oh, no, we’re not- Mary and I aren’t together,” he said with a shy smile, and then he blessedly answered Sherlock’s unspoken question with what he said next. “I’m actually not seeing anyone, at the moment.”
Put-together as always, Sherlock sported his (surely designer) black trousers and silky button-up shirt beneath a fitted black blazer, and the suit served its purpose of portraying a composed and poised individual, but John peered past the facade. Sherlock looked tired. Not quite as disheveled as the first time he’d seen him, but definitely not bright-eyed and bushy-tailed like he’d been in their second meeting, either. Though the younger man was certainly more relaxed in the doctor’s presence, which was great progress, in John’s eyes.
going back to my flat," he mumbled.
“Uh... “ The doctor cleared his throat, suddenly feeling a bit put-on-the-spot, as he looked between Lestrade and Sherlock; the former of whom looked a bit tired while the latter looked enraptured. John just barely fought back a blush. “So. Not like someone killed him and then strung him up - clearly ante-mortem hanging; cyanosis - blue face and lips, blue and swollen tongue with teeth indents in the tip to show it was pressed against his teeth… um. The- the rope is fixed here-” he pointed, “not high enough to exert pressure mainly on the bottom of the chin, neither was the point of suspension low enough to induce slow asphyxiation… I mean, the jugular veins weren’t obstructed while the arteries remained untouched or anything. Um… the knot,” he touched delicately at the knot fixed at the side of Blessington’s neck, “must have pressed against some part of the cervical sympathetic. That’s why his eye’s open.” He chewed his lip, searching for anything else to say. “Ah, likely vagal inhibition, since he’s not all swollen - but it could have been something else, and the congestion could have drained through the vertebral venous plexus, if it wasn’t damaged. Which, considering his size, is likely… but I’d need more than five minutes with the body to tell you.”
“You- you want me to come with you?” John asked.
Sherlock blinked a few times in quick succession. “I- yes,” he affirmed. “It was the least I could do. His mother is a lovely woman. She helped me collect information on a school administrator who was embezzling funds a couple years back. And his brother is quite adept with a lockpick, he-”
The statement shocked both Sally and John, but the look of confusion on John’s face contrasted greatly with the look of sudden fear which was quickly overwhelmed by searing hatred that appeared on Sally’s.
“Mm,” he confirmed with a subtle nod. “You said I could have tea later. It’s later.” The justification was accompanied by a mild shrug, and Sherlock couldn’t quite help the soft chuckle that bubbled up from his chest, however much it made his head ache.
He’s been in John’s room before, he thinks to himself. Not always with John’s permission. But this is a special case, isn’t it? He looks down at Rosie and thinks that, yes, it is acceptable for him to put Rosie to bed and wait in John’s room until the man returns home.
“Yeah. Go on, it’s been a long day. I’ve got some paperwork to finish - I’ll wrap that up quick and close everything up when I’m done.”
Have some fluff.
“Police!!”
John reached for his phone with a hum, and peered at the screen as it woke up. “Nearly six,” he said, and set his phone back on the vanity. “I’ll start getting dressed, then?” He didn’t wait for an answer, but instead turned to the single bed in the room, on which laid a pile of white and red - Mary’s costume - and a folded pair of black rugby shorts and a blue jersey. They were an old practise set from a previous year that John still fit into - he hadn’t grown much in his three years of uni - and he and Mary had taken to the outfit with scissors before taking it outside to stomp into the dirt earlier in the day.
“Good night, John.”
“This is the most - ridiculous thing - I’ve ever done,” John managed between his laughs and heaving breaths.
“Why do you like this shirt so much?” he asks suddenly, and John’s fingers still. He can feel John’s body heating in embarrassment.
I'd like to give my sincerest, heartfelt thanks to every single person who has given this work even a shred of their attention. I can't put into words how much I appreciate all of your support. Every hit, every kudos, every comment, has given me an unfathomable amount of joy and a sense of purpose I sometimes find myself searching for in the monotony of everyday life. This has been an incredible journey for me as a person and as a writer, however cliche that shit sounds. Thank you all so much, for giving me, and this fic, a chance, and for giving it and me so much love. I really can't thank you enough.
A short distance away, Sherlock’s mobile
Sherlock fixed John with a look that John couldn’t quite decipher. “Because I have no interest in searching for another therapist when I have a perfectly acceptable one right here.”
Sherlock managed to not roll his eyes at the public display of affection and instead turned to Molly, who was blushing obnoxiously and smiling to herself. “I- I assume he’s treating you well, then?” he asked, earning a surprised look from both her and Irene at the uncharacteristic display of almost-concern. He ignored their looks and instead waited for a response.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, trying to get the other’s attention, but it allegedly came across as a sigh of passion, the answer coming in the form of an acknowledging hum against Sherlock’s carotid. Sherlock’s hips gave an involuntary jerk forward at the teasing brush of teeth against his throat, followed by the soothing sweep of a tongue that had him making a noise dangerously close to a squeak.
a therapist,” the youth mumbled derisively, eyes moving away from John and falling on the armrest of his own chair, where his nimble fingers idly picked at a loose thread poking out of a seam in the fabric.
, that he was supposed to be helping the other man get clean and remove him from the path of self-destruction, none of that stopped his heart from stumbling its way through some sloppy semblance of rhythm at the thought of the young genius currently in his flat.
“Molls, there you are. I’ve been looking all over for you- oh! Hey!” Greg had stepped up to toss an affectionate arm around his girlfriend’s red-draped shoulders, when he noticed who Molly was speaking to. He looked them both over and grinned. “Who let you two in?” he asked, and Irene and Molly shared a chuckle while Sherlock tilted his head in clear confusion.
“Leaving me to pay for the cab then?” the doctor groused, and Sherlock smirked.
Greg spoke confidently, but Sherlock's gut was heavy with a sinking feeling. He shook his head as he stood up straight, vacating the computer to scrub a hand over his face and wander over to lean against the closest wall, suddenly feeling lightheaded. “They would have wanted to leave the country as soon as possible. I’m surprised they even waited this long," he murmured to no one in particular. “A flight to Russia - most likely destination given ancestry, no stops… two one-way tickets… large amount of money given time restraint and potential luggage. Desperate to leave-” a breath left him in a slightly laboured puff as he pinched his eyes shut against the light in the room, which had suddenly grown brighter. His train of thought, verbalised, made little sense; even to him. What had he been saying? He peeled his eyes open to look at where the worker had resumed his position at the computer, joined by Greg, and he regretted the decision instantly.
“Good, thank you.” His pale fingers grasped his toothbrush, a pair of pants, and a pair of socks before finding a soft, byzantine blue tee-shirt with a subtle vee-neck, and the pair of jeans. He was pleased to find that they were dark and rather slim through the legs. They weren’t his dress trousers, but they were suitable. Upon standing, he turned and made a bee-line for the bathroom, calling “get dressed” over his shoulder as an afterthought, and was just crossing the threshold into the bathroom when a meek-sounding voice emanating from the bed stopped him.
Happy Saturday!
Suddenly, John had a very good idea of which of these men he was most likely seeing.
“What?”
“I’m sorry,” he breathed quickly, and John nearly laughed, because there were streaks of red marring the man’s porcelain skin, on the tip and side of his nose, just above the perfect Cupid’s bow of his top lip, and on his cheek. Despite the fact that he
know why all of that, instead of making his head whir and blood pump with the thrill of a good mystery, made his heart pound in a different sort of stuttered rhythm that had nothing to do with the rationale of his brain; he
Which was
“Oh! No, no, no,” Sherlock says, voice panicked, before he returns to the melody of his lullaby. “L’était une p’tit’ poule rousse, qu’allait pondre dans la mousse…”
“Just after one.” Sherlock glanced at the small digital numbers in the top right corner of his phone screen as he held his mobile aloft over his face. There was a brief shuffling beside him as John shifted enough to peer up at the mobile screen as Sherlock opened his messages.
It was this newfound lack of doubt that aided in prompting John to cross the threshold from verbal confirmations and subtle touches to something a bit more substantial. It’d been a split-second decision that John really hadn’t even thought about. One moment he was nearly seething at the prospect of Sherlock having homeless children do his bidding for scraps; and the next moment his heart was swelling almost painfully in his chest because Sherlock was the
The woman’s smile was fond as she nodded to him. “I will. Thank you again.” With a final wave of farewell, she departed, making her way through the small waiting area and through the front door of the establishment.
Sherlock tipped his head. “Potentially two of the members are out of the country. But there’s been another robbery; one that sent nearly half the bloody police force - you saw how many officers were rushing down the hall. Likely a rather significant heist. Pavel and Matvei weren’t the only members of the gang, that much is certain. So even if Pavel and Matvei
hell she wasn’t spilling out of it. Though it probably had something to do with how snugly the black bodice hugged her waist. More attention was drawn to her bust by the emerald pendant that hung about her neck, and the green that seemed to be the underlying colour scheme for the night was mirrored in the subtle and dark velvety green of the long skirt of the dress, which was covered in a layer of elaborate, black lace. The sleeves of the gown started below Irene’s shoulders and ran the full length in dark green velvet down to taper nicely at her wrists and end in a subtly-ruffled cuff where her slim hands with emerald-painted nails and a couple flashy rings emerged. “What do you think?” she asked, black, strappy heels of an absurd height clicking primly against the marble floor as she spun a slow circle.
