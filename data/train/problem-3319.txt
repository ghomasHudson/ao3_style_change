“So what are you even supposed to be?” Castiel asked, breaking the silence.
“Uh, S-Sure,” Cas answered, stepping to the side in a silent invitation.
“Nothing on Aella but I might have found another case.” Sam responded, not looking up from the screen, “a werewolf in Massachusetts, three dead, two missing. Sounds interesting, wanna check it out.”
Cas’s typing indicator popped up and disappeared a few times before he finally said: Watching Netflix.
Dean rolled his eyes at his goody two shoes brother before sighing and lifting his head up to scan through the novels.
Someone bumped his back with their elbow and he turned, looking down at the familiar smiling red-head in front of him.
Also, for personal reasons, the next chapter may not be out for a while.
“Well no shit, Sherlock. You have to bring it up,” she snapped.
“Say it,” Castiel whispered.
It was hard for Dean to keep his focus on what was happening in the room. His mind kept wandering to the scenario he had imagined a few days prior with the smaller man pinned against a wall as they kissed roughly.
Cas hummed in agreement, “I should go too, my dad’s probably waiting for me. I’ll text you later?”
Castiel’s breath hitched. Dean kissed him. Or did he kiss Dean? It didn’t matter. He needed more. He surged forward, deepening the kiss. He forced Dean back until he was leaning against the counter, trapping him there with his hips. Dean whimpered into the kiss, sending the blood in his face rushing south. His hips twitched instictually, trying to relieve some of the pressure.
“I bet. I can’t believe you drive that rustbucket still. It’s ancient and on the verge of being unsafe.” Gabe snorted.
“No,” Cas lied, his voice quiet. He looked away, sure that his face couldn’t get any redder.
“That Winchester boy you like got in an accident,” he said, expression unchanging.
“Oh,” Charlie said confused, “Oh!” she repeated with a tone of realization. Cas looked at her confused and she looked at Dean briefly before glancing back to Cas and saying, “Wanna go to the roof?”
Castiel felt like he’d been punched in the gut. Had he done something wrong? Was Dean mad at him? Thoughts rushed through his head, making it spin. “What?”
“Dean?” Sammy asked. Dean jumped. Sam was staring at him, concern and guilt dripping from his eyes.
“Is there anything you’d like to tell me?” Chuck asked.
“I- Cas- what?” Dean asked, his hands reaching up and framing Cas’s face.
“He’s cute. Pretty introverted though, not your usual type,” she noted, taking a sip from the beer in her hand.
“Yeah. Jesus, Cas,” Charlie sighed, “One of us has to go after him before he does something stupid.”
He felt the hair on the back of his neck rise. Sensing a pair of eyes watching him, he quickly scanned the lunchroom. He quickly found the source. It was Castiel, the cute boy from his pre-calc class. Dean quickly decided to take a shot at flirting from a distance, but the other boy had already looked away. Dean’s face fell a little. He sat, staring in disappointment for a moment longer, hoping the blue-eyed boy would look at him again. When he didn’t Dean rejoined his teammates’ conversation with an awkward chuckle.
I'm definitely projecting onto them tho which isn't good. I'm just *lonely* lol. I'm also a huge romantic and sap so this is probably the cheesiest thing I've ever written and I couldn't be prouder. Prepare for the next chapter to be emotionally draining.
“Your girlfriend did?” he asked.
“Oh shit, I’m out of...whatever the hell this was,” Charlie said, obviously lying, “Be right back!” Dean shot her a frosty glare but she just winked and walked off, closing the door behind her.
(Please don’t be upset at this, I’m only on season 11)
Dean: Idk, I’m just bored ig.
Cas gulped as he climbed out of the car. This was happening. “You’re not gonna murder me, right?” he laughed as they made their way toward the building.
“I stole dad’s cell when we left,” Balthazar said with a wink, “time to go.”
Dean shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He took a few deep breaths. His mind searched for other things to think about.
“So, I’m having this barbecue thing later,” he paused looking back up at Cas, “if you want to come.”
“It’s that bad, huh?” Cas mumbled, guilt washing over him again.
“Nah,” Cas answered, contemplating going back to get his. He completely lost his train of thought as Dean took off his jacket and opened the bottle. His mouth went dry as he watched the toned muscles flex under the black shirt.
“Yes!” Gabe gave a victorious fist pump along with a semi-evil smile.
“Yeah,” Cas whispered back, “Go to sleep.”
“Shut up,” Dean said, shooting a quick smile of thanks to the girl.
“Sure,” Cas responded, pulling open the door and stepping in. Dean followed him in.
“Is it the new kid? Did he hurt you?” Gabe interrogated, this time with a look of concern and rage.
“It probably didn’t mean anything. Besides, I’ll buy him a coffee Friday to pay him back.” Anna exhaled sadly at Castiel’s statement. She looked back at Gabriel who was now fidgeting with his phone. Cas eyed her curiously, “Did I interrupt something?”
Cas: How could I not ;)
Dean sighed. This whole “End Of The World” was starting to seem normal as it became a routine. When was the final shabang? He knew he wasn’t able to escape this life, not properly at least. There would always be another hunt up until the day he died. One boss fight after another like a bad, never ending video game.
“What the hell was that?” Dean demanded, half limping, half storming through the dungeon door.
Cas starts a routine of visiting and taking care of him which is rudely interrupted by John Winchester. However, fate seems to be on Castiel's side.
He counted the street lights as Gabe and Anna sang poorly along to Carry On My Wayward Son by Kansas. Balthazar patted his legs to the beat mouthing the words.
“Dude, you okay? What’s wrong?” Gabe asked.
“Are you ashamed of me or something?” he asked, his voice breaking.
“Hey, sleeping beauty.” Dean teased, hoping for a reaction out of the other boy, “I got you something.”
“This weekend. You gotta ride?”
“Yeah. I mean, I practically raised the kid,” Dean laughed awkwardly, “Can we talk about something else. I’d rather not think about my brother right now.”
A shudder traveled up Cas’s spine at the memory. The last party that Gabe had dragged him to was a wreck. He’d finally given into Gabe's pressures to drink some of the alcohol. Turns out he was a lightweight drinker because he only had a few drinks before he lost the ability to function. Once he made it home his plan to stealthily creep back to his room had gone amuck as he lost balance and a lamp came crashing down waking up the whole house. His dad was fuming with anger at Cas’s drunken state and grounded him for a month.
Is Cas not gay? He’d heard rumors. Maybe they were just that, rumors.
“I know, I just wasn’t expecting--”
“Yeah,” Dean said with a smile, looking up at the sky.
Dean found himself entranced by the gorgeous blue eyes as they studied his face, eventually coming to rest on his own. The world seemed to slow as he kept that blissful eye contact. The temptation to lean in and kiss the other’s lips was next to overwhelming. The thought caused his mouth to go dry and Dean felt his tongue dart across his dry lips in response. The blue eyes across from him darted down, following the swift movement.
Cas had calmed down by the time Ellen had brought them their food. She set two chocolate milkshakes and a very large basket of fries in front of them.
“Cas,” Dean waved him over. Castiel took the spot next to him with a smile. An array of foods was laid out on the table. Everything from burgers to various kinds of salads. The group passed around the plates, making conversation as they stocked up on food. Dean introduced Cas to the remaining people, “You’ve met Charlie and Sammy. That’s Eileen, she’s dating Sammy and she’s deaf, and that old git is Bobby.” Bobby looked up at that, murmuring something that sounded like “Idjit.”
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! It was a fun one to write. I am not very good at dialogue still so I apologize for it's clunkiness. I was really looking forward to writing the accident(I'm weird like that lol) but then when I wrote the last bit I just knew it would be the perfect place to end the chapter. The next chapter should hopefully be out soon but we'll see how my schedule holds up. If you made it this far, please drop a kudos. I am not new to writing but this is the first thing I've "officially published" and it definitely won't be the last and the exposure would be nice. I am thinking about adding some more *ahem* e x p i c i t  c o n t e n t *ahem* to get more views ;). Might not tho.
He wasn’t sure how long he sat there for, but it was long enough for his tailbone to start aching from sitting on the tile.
“So,” Cas copied.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean laughed a little, face turning serious when Cas’s fell. “Yes, yes of course I want this. You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this. If you’re not ready-”
“Holy fuck,” Dean said.
Cas’s already flushed face darkened. “Yeah, I didn’t know I’d be going home with someone,” he muttered. He lifted his hand to pull at the velcro on the choker.
“He’s shorter than I thought he would be,” Charlie said, her eyes fixed on Cas who was nursing a beer near the door to the house. Dean followed her gaze, smiling when Cas looked at them.
“Clearly he’s not,” Charlie said, exasperated.
They stood, bodies still pressed together, panting as they came back down from their high. The musky smell of sweat hung in the air. Castiel swiped his tongue over the mark he’d left on Dean’s neck to soothe it. The sweat stung his lips. He brought his head up to look at Dean. Dean looked back at him.
Once again the whole world was in danger. Once again no one knew but the Winchesters and some close friends. Once again all of the pressure was on Sam and Dean Winchester to fix it.
“Thanks,” Eli replied, Cas blushed as he saw the other's eyes quickly comb over his body. Eli’s polite smile turned into a flirty smirk as he met Cas’s eyes once more. He matched Cas’s stance as he replied, “I like your shirt. So what’s your name?”
Before Dean knew what he was doing, he felt his head rising towards Cas’s. However, when Dean’s nose hit Cas’s, he quickly moved away. Mumbling something under his breath about “Sorry” and needing to go, he stood and rushed towards the door inside.
“Cas, what the hell are you talking about?” Dean asked again, his stomach churned.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean said as casually as he could, forcing a smile, “You hungry?”
“Let me take you out on a date,” Dean said again, “Let me make this up to you.”
“Whatever you say. Go on, your distraction awaits,” Charlie said, pointing her beer at the brunette.
!!!!!!!!!TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sorry this took so long to get out! It's also a lot shorter then my other chapters but i felt this was a more appropriate ending to the chapter then the one I had originally written. This chapter also features our least favorite character in the show, John Winchester :p. I hope you like it regardless. Don't forget to drop a kudos if you haven't already! Thank you for the 17 I have already gotten, the 3 bookmarks, and 213 hits! It means a lot!
Cas: I...
“Good morning to you too, Grumpy,” Balthazar said from where he was sitting on his bed. Cas opened an eye and peered out from behind the peak in his pillowcase to make eye contact with Balthazar. There was a sarcastic smile plastered on his face like he usually had when their dad and Michael fought. He shut the screen on the laptop postured precariously on his right leg.
“Dean, what happened to Cas- it wasn’t your fault,” Sam said, leaning against the doorframe. He continued when Dean shrugged,“ he saved you. It was his choice.”
Dean ripped his arm away and crammed the key into the lock before getting in the vehicle.
He fell into bed, not bothering to change, and passed out almost immediately after his head hit the pillow.
He needed a very long, very cold shower.
He let out a breathy laugh, teeth dragging lightly against the mark he left. Dean’s waist jolted forward at the touch, making Castiel hiss. He could feel Dean hard against his leg. He brought his forehead down, resting it on Dean’s shoulder. Emotion nearly overwhelming him. Fear, joy, arousal, anxiety. His breath was coming in pants. His head felt fuzzy.
“Yes,” He answered, definitely not noticing that Dean wasn’t wearing a shirt or the drops of sweat that had accumulated on his skin.
Cas pulled his sleeves down to his hands. A few more of his classmates came through the door. Cas kept his eyes stuck to it. His stomach knotted with stress as he waited for the green-eyed boy to walk through. Eventually, he managed to pull his eyes away from it. He checked his phone. It was only 7:31. There was about 14 minutes until class started. Cas felt himself relax a bit. It was short-lived, however. Dean was standing at the door. He held two drinks in his hands. Cas made eye contact with him. Dean smiled. Cas had never wanted the ability to turn invisible more than he did right then. He settled for the next best thing of shrinking down in his chair as Dean walked over. Cas’s head was spinning. He felt a dull pain shoot through it. He raised his hands to his eyes. Pressing gently to relieve some of the pressure.
“A dog?”
His heart shot up into his throat and Dean forced it back down. The tears that had filled his eyes when Sam was still with him returned, threatening to spill over. Taking a shuddering breath, Dean realized what was happening. What he was actually seeing.
The last of many. An end to their lives as hunters. But only the beginning for what they could still be.
Without wasting any time, Cas got to work healing Dean’s wound. And as the wound faded and Dean’s consciousness returned to him, he realized that Cas wasn’t disappearing. In fact, Cas was only becoming clearer. A real person. The tears that had come and gone before, returned again. Dean backed away from Cas, finally able to support himself after being stuck for what had felt like an eternity.
“Dean,” phantom Cas started. He sounded so much like the real Cas. His mind had really perfected him. Created a version of his angel to ease him into death. “You’re not hallucinating.”
Frowning at Dean, Sam took the phone and read over the text. When he was done, he grabbed his own phone and tried to turn it on. It refused to come to life. “Eileen’s at the bunker. She was trying to get ahold of me, but…” He showed the black screen of his phone to the others again for emphasis. “Can you get the rest of that to go?”
“Well, to be fair, when I said it you didn’t say anything.” Cas threw back.
“Oh, thank god…” he sighed as he held onto them.
The room started to darken around him, and Dean figured it was really his time. He’d died before. It was nothing new. Just once more unto the breach. But when his mind came back to him, refocusing on the world around him, Dean saw that it wasn’t his vision that was darkening. It was the actual room. All of the lights began to burst, creating an inky blackness and he didn’t understand what was happening.
Still unsure of the dog in front of him, Cas didn’t know what to do. So, Dean took his hand gently in his own and held it in front of Kansas’ nose. She gave him a quick sniff, a light bark, and then her tail started up. It whipped back and forth, a propeller on the end of the dog. Tentatively, Cas removed his hand from Dean’s grip and pet her lightly on the head. Kansas nudged his hand with her nose to get more attention and he obliged.
Too much of him was convinced he didn’t.
“Sam, I’m not a toddler.”
“Cas?”
Two uncles. A father. A mother.
Dean opened his mouth to say something when Sam knocked on the driver’s side window, stopping him completely. Rolling down the window, Sam smiled and said, “Eileen are going to go out for a bit. Are you two ok on your own?”
He nodded even though Charlie couldn’t see him, and he felt Cas rest a hand on his shoulder. “We’ll be there. How many wolves you got?”
Dean’s head dipped, consciousness becoming too heavy a burden to bear for much longer. But phantom Cas was already at his side. Carefully sliding him off of the screw, phantom Cas helped Dean stand despite the hole in his back.
Cas was gone. And Jack was god. And Same would be alone. And Dean… Dean would be dead.
After they had left the barn and dropped the two boys off, Sam, Dean, and Cas stopped at a local diner. Dean ordered something called ‘The Triple Meat Surprise’ while Sam got a simple salad. Cas didn’t get anything. He was just along for the ride.
Jack had been watching his dad ‘fix’ his hair for maybe twenty minutes. He was already on his second bowl of cereal. Finally, his dad turned to him, an expectant look on his face. “You look fine, dad.” He reached for the box of Cookie Crunch, but stopped when he saw Dean’s face morph from Nervous Guy Before A First Date to Tired Dad. “Jack, what did we say about the cereal?” Jack hung his head, embarrassed. “Two bowls a day, max.” He intoned. Dean nodded, tossing him an orange from their fruit bowl. Dean hesitated, before turning back to the mirror. “Maybe I should change?” He asked, tugging at his jacket self consciously, “Maybe I’m overdressed.” Jack eyed his black shirt and gray slacks. Mr. Novak wore a suit and tie to teach high schoolers every day. Dean could wear a ball gown and probably wouldn’t be overdressed next to him. “Roll the sleeves up.” He suggested, nodding in satisfaction as his dad complied.
Dean groaned, hanging his head. “Is that all the women we know?” Cas asked, wrinkling his nose. “Just about.” Dean confirmed, “Unless you count Jody’s girls.”
“Dean?” The hunter was standing in the doorway with a bouquet of purple flowers. “I read that purple flowers attract bees.” He said as a greeting, smiling sheepishly. Stunned, Cas stepped aside, letting Dean in. He accepted the flowers, looking around the room with a sigh. “I have nowhere to put them.” He looked down sadly. Dean shrugged. “Well, it’s not like you’ll be here long, anyway.” Cas’ eyes snapped up. Did Dean know about his financial situation? “I mean,” Dean clarified at Cas’ confused look, “You’re coming home with me. Right?” Castiel felt hope well up in his chest. “I can come home?” He whispered, taking a step closer. “Of course, Cas.” Dean smiled, “But, y’know, I’m pretty beat.” He yawned, as if to prove his point, “So how about we head out first thing in the morning?” Cas nodded enthusiastically. “Alright, then.” Dean looked around the room, “Nice place you got here.” He smirked. “No, it isn’t.” Cas rolled his eyes. “But being human is so-” “Expensive?” Dean finished for him. Cas smiled, and his face almost hurt. It had been a while since he’d been truly happy. “Yeah,” Dean smiled softly. Throughout their conversation, they’d gravitated towards each other, the way they always did. “Cas.” Dean shifted uncomfortably. “Can we, uh, can we sit?” He motioned to the couch. Cas nodded.
Number Three: Castiel
“Jack!” Claire motioned for him to take the empty seat next to her. He felt a few of their classmates’ eyes on him as he sat in the back of the room. “How was he?” She asked, doodling absentmindedly in her notebook. Jack looked away, embarrassed. “He thought you and I were on a date.”
He kept his breathing even until he heard the door close, waiting until Dean’s footsteps retreated before snapping his eyes open, pulling out his phone to text Claire.
“I know.”
Jack and Claire were curled up on opposite ends of the couch, a half eaten pie of pizza in between them. They both managed to make some progress with their English papers, but planning a perfect day in at least 5000 words was turning out to be harder than Jack had thought. He also didn’t fully understand why he had to work on a project due in May when it was only September. After nearly three hours of brainstorming, they’d both agreed that the perfect day would start with waking up at 7am, but fully rested, so you could fit as many fun things as possible in the day. They’d given up fairly quickly after that, patting themselves on the back for at least having any kind of direction, which was definitely better than most of their class, judging by the WhatsApp group. So, they’d ditched the essays in favor of ordering the pizzas, which led to a debate about whether pineapple was a valid pizza topping (it wasn’t), and they turned on New Girl for background noise while they talked.
Dean raised an eyebrow. “And how do we feel about Claire?” Jack tilted his head, confused. “We...” he furrowed his brows, “we feel like you just went on a date with her dad?” Dean tried to laugh it off, folding the box and tossing it into the can. “Not a date, kiddo.” Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Jack frown down at his phone. “Not a date?” He repeated, putting the phone back in his pocket. “Cas and I are just friends.” Dean returned to the living room, holding out a hand to help Jack stand up. “Bedtime, little one.”
“My angel.” Joseph muttered, “I am so very glad I met you.”
Nearly an hour later, Dean had one hand on the steering wheel, the other clutching Cas’ tightly, as Rockford disappeared in the rearview mirror. They’d had a quick call with Sam to let him know that the shifter was dead, and Dean and Cas were on their way home. Sam was happy to hear Cas was coming back, and made it clear that he did not want to hear about how Cas was Dean’s ‘loved one’.
“Shut up.” Claire huffed, reaching over to punch him lightly in the shoulder. The two shared a quiet laugh as their teacher walked in, greeting the class. “So what do we do?” She whispered. Jack shrugged, turning his attention to the board.
“Stay safe, Sammy.” Dean reached over and ended the call. He upped the volume of his music, and pressed down harder on the gas. “I’m coming, Castiel.” He whispered, though he knew the ex-Angel could no longer hear his prayers. “Please, just hold on a little longer.”
“Alright, then.” He stood up, effectively silencing all the chatter and speculation about what Mr. Novak and Coach Winchester were planning.
“Castiel, is there anything you can do?” Joseph shouted over the pounding against the door. “I don’t know!” Castiel cried,  arm outstretched in front of him as he recited another incantation. The hidden wards on the walls glowed dimly, and he knew they wouldn’t last much longer. “Hoc domui munito!” The wards were barely visible, and he could see the door begin to break. “It’s over.” Joseph whispered, staring at the door with wide, unblinking eyes. “Don’t say that.” Castiel snapped, “Please, Joseph, don’t-” he was cut off by the door flying off its hinges, splintering into a thousand pieces as it smashed into the wall, just narrowly missing the two of them, and three men stood in the empty doorway.
“Dean Winchester!” A familiar voice roared behind him. Jack cast an absolutely terrified look at him, and disappeared in the time between one blink and the next. Dean turned to see Castiel storming toward him. He was still in his vessel, but... there was an aura of other around him, and he had a faint blue glow, his grace much closer to the surface. Dean couldn’t help but be thankful he was already dead, because wow, Cas gave a whole new definition to the phrase ‘if looks could kill’. He steeled himself, remembering that he was also pretty damn pissed at the angel. “Cas-”
Cas waited until the door shut, though he knew Sam was waiting right outside to hear anything he could. “Hello, Dean.” He reached forward, brushing his hair away from his face, “I guess this is what happens when I leave you alone for too long.” He chuckled. “You know,” he said casually, “If you wanted to get my attention, you could’ve just called.” He leaned closer, so their noses were brushing against each other. “I love you, Dean Winchester.” He whispered, closing the distance between them and sealing their lips together.
“Yeah,” Dean sighed, “Oh.”
Dean’s phone buzzed, and he pulled it out to see a text from his younger brother Sam.
They were both silent as Dean continued to barrel down the highway. “You know where he’s staying?” Sam asked. Dean nodded, before remembering that Sam was over the phone and not in his usual spot by Dean’s side. “Yeah, we have location tracking.” He admitted. Sam chuckled, and Dean wished he was here, so he could smack him. “Good luck, Dean. Stay safe” Sam spoke quietly.
He cried for Dean, who had made Sam promise he wouldn’t try to bring him back.
They stayed there for a while, until Cas leaned back slightly. “Dean.” He mumbled, as Dean slipped his arms around Cas’ waist, pulled him forward, and began to place kisses along his jaw, and down his neck. “We have to go.” He gently shoved Dean’s face away from his neck, smiling playfully.
“The, the bell rang a few minutes ago. I thought...” Dean trailed off, embarrassed. “No, no, please.” Castiel motioned for him to come in. “These miscreants were just running off to their next class, right?”
Sam: How soon can you get here?
Well, he thought as Miracle curiously sniffed the seat where Cas had been, not totally alone.
“His tie is green.”
Cas shrugged modestly. "Well, I helped a little."
“I’ll see you in a few hours.”
Dean closed the door behind them as the three entered the motel. “Apparently Aliya went to visit her father the day before she went missing. Uh...” he looked at the name her daughter had texted him, “Joseph Saloman.”
Dean turned to look down at Cas, who was fighting a smile. “What’s happening?” He whispered, eyes flicking between Sam and Eileen. Cas just shook his head, picking his book back up and standing, taking Dean’s arm gently. “Let’s go.” He whispered, tugging at Dean.
“Son of a bitch!” Dean rubbed at his shoulder, trying to think. “So that thing is walkin’ around town wearing my face now?”
“Never.” Dean promised, guiding Cas’ face so they were eye to eye. “Never again.” He said softly, leaning in a bit.
And then he heard a muffled curse, and could picture Dean sitting with his back against the door, staring off into nothing the way he did when life became too much. "Hey, Bee." Dean sighed. Cas sat down, wincing at the ache in his very human knees. "Would you like to talk about it?" He asked gently. Dean huffed a small laugh. "I'm fine, Cas."
Baby was the best.
‘No you don’t.’
“-And don't forget, papers due on Tuesday!”
Sam bolted upright, barely sparing a glance down at Eileen as he leapt out of bed, yanking a pair of pants on before throwing the door open. “Dean!”
“You were honoring his wishes.” Cas reached out, placing his hand on Sam’s. “I don’t blame you.”
“Dean, I can literally feel your anger.” Castiel glared at him, “It’s just a stupid tape deck.”
‘Goodnight, Kline.’
Dean.
“What was that?”
‘Hey, gonna have to take a rain check on Saturday. Work :(‘
—————
“Don’t think any of you were around much back then.” Sam muttered. Cas turned to him sharply. “God works-” he froze, eyes wide. Dean leaned in, a confused look on his face. “How does he work?” He said, smirking. “-in mysterious ways.” Cas whispered. “There it is.” Dean huffed a laugh, clapping him on the back as he passed, making his way to the fridge. “So, why don’t we go get lunch, and then head over?” He tossed a beer across the room to Sam, who caught it easily. “Sounds good.” He called, then softer, so just Cas would hear him, “Are you sure you’re okay?” Cas lifted his eyes to meet Sam’s, which were wide in concern. “I don’t know.” Cas admitted.
“Why can’t I remember yours?” Cas whispered, swallowing around the lump in his throat. A tear slid down Joseph’s cheek as he reached out, cupping Cas’ cheek gently. The boys exchanged a look as Cas leaned into the touch, eyes filled with fear and confusion. “My angel.” Joseph muttered, wiping a tear that Cas hadn’t even felt slip out. “What did they do to you?”
"So, what now?" Dean asked. Cas looked down at where their hands were still entwined.
And then Dean cried out, “You always leave! Every time. And why not? I’ve never given you any real reason to stay.” Cas pushed himself up. “Dean, open this door.” He all but growled. “Now.” Something in his tone left no room for argument, and Dean didn't even comment about bad luck as he slowly shuffled to his feet, slowly unlocking the door and opening it.
Dean had been so ready to impress Cas with his encyclopedic knowledge of cars, some of which he may or may not have googled compulsively until very late, but the guy was on another level. He was animatedly telling Dean everything about the inside of the 1963 Aston Martin, pointing out parts of its engine that he had never even heard of. If it were anyone else, it might have bothered him, but he was honestly just content to smile and listen. Cas was clearly having a blast.
“Please don’t hurt me.” Cas sobbed, and Dean’s heart broke. He cut the last tie, catching Cas as he pitched forward slightly. “I’m not gonna hurt you.” He pressed a soft kiss to Cas’ temple, helping him stand. Despite everything, Cas pushed his face into Dean’s neck, sighing softly. “‘M s’rry, Dean.” He mumbled. Dean squeezed him as tight as he could without pressing on his injuries. “Why are you sorry?” He tried to maneuver Cas onto the bed so he could take care of his injuries. “You- He- It. It kissed me. I thought... I thought it was you, but-“ Dean helped him lie down, propping his head up. “But?” Dean prompted before he could stop himself. “But it said it loved me.” He whispered, curling into himself on the bed. Dean froze. “Cas,” Dean breathed, frantically opening cabinets looking for a first aid kit. He really didn’t want to leave the ex-angel alone to run to the car. “It’s okay.” Cas continued, eyelids drooping, “I know you don’t... I know...”
“My goodness, angel, I know you aren’t about to blame yourself for the Second World War.” He glared at Castiel, who fell silent, looking down guiltily. “That’s what I thought. Castiel, you keeping me hidden as long as you did is what saved my life in the end. And, well,” he turned, drawing Castiel’s attention to a picture on his nightstand, a very happy family. His family. “God works in mysterious ways.”
Barely half an hour until the wedding.
“Add the blue sweater.” Claire spoke from behind him, making him jump slightly. “It brings out our eyes.” He turned to her, and she sighed. “What’s going on, dad?” She moved the one pair of jeans he owned aside as she took a seat on the bed, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you like this.”
“End this.” Naomi said, a bored expression on the vessel’s face. Joseph screamed as Castiel was ripped away from him. “No!” Castiel thrashed against them as they began to drag him away. “Wait!” Joseph lunged, but the angels were gone. He heard footsteps coming closer, a horrified look coloring his features as he looked up onto the faces of two German soldiers.
“Where is he?” Cas demanded again, clicking the gun’s safety off. “Where is Dean?” The thing chuckled, taking a step closer. “Come on, Cas.” It smirked, “We both know you aren’t gonna hurt me. Put the gun down.” Cas realized he was shaking, but he held the gun as steady as he could. Before he could react, the thing lunged, knocking the gun to the ground. “No!” Cas cried, as it grabbed his hands, pinning them behind his back. “We could’ve had a lot of fun, angel.” It whispered in his ear, wrapping- where did it even get a rope? Castiel certainly didn’t have any, he barely had food.
As soon as he heard the front door shut, he grabbed his phone again.
Something flickered across Cas’ face, something like pain. “I did.” He agreed slowly, “I summoned the empty, and it took Billie along with me. It... taunted me, for what felt like years.” He shrugged, “I thought it had been.”
The two talked a bit more, about the freshman class, about the last faculty meeting, about how awful Vice Principal Marv Scriver was, before Dean pulled his car into the lot. He smirked to himself at the looks sent their way.
Jack hesitated. “You are in heaven,” Jack admitted. He shrugged sheepishly, “we, I- we wanted to let you rest for a while, while your body heals, and then... break it to you slowly, I guess.”
Dean Winchester was a nervous wreck.
“Not quite.” Cas chuckled, trying to move away slightly, but Dean’s hands kept him close. “Sam’s right outside. He’s waiting” Cas said, but Dean just scoffed. “Let him wait.” He smiled, eyes sparkling. “My Prince Charming just saved me. I gotta thank him properly.”
The conversation had flowed easily between the two for the entire drive out to where the show was set up. They talked about work, sharing stories from their respective classes. Castiel told Dean about his cat, who Claire had found on the side of the road a few years ago and begged him to keep, and Dean had laughed, because he had done the same thing to Jack the day he found Miracle. They talked about their time at University, and Dean told him that his degree was actually in sports therapy, and he’d minored in education. His plan had been to work in rehabilitation with injured soldiers, but after adopting Jack he decided he wanted something that could help him learn more about kids. Castiel told him he’d always wanted to teach history, and he did everything in his power to make sure it was Claire’s favorite subject, but he lost her to cheerleading. “Hey, don’t act like it’s some tragedy.” Dean laughed, “I see her practice when I’m with the football team. She’s crazy strong.” Castiel smiled. He’d been to every game since she joined the squad, of course, and this year she was team captain. “She’s awesome at dodgeball, too.” He added, “I’ve had to make a rule, no one’s allowed to pick her first. Has to be at least the third round.”
------
In one swift movement, he pulled Cas in by his tie, sealing their lips together. It was everything their first kiss should be, all the lingering stares and coming back to each other and the hope and the promises of forever all crashing into one perfect moment somewhere that wasn’t quite heaven but not quite Earth either, and Dean made his choice.
“Here you are.” Sam repeated. They stood in silence for a moment, before Eileen finally spoke, “So, tuxedo?” She gestured toward his outfit. “Yeah.” Sam looked down, “I, uh. Old friends’ wedding. You know.” He shrugged.
“Now, or you'll all be writing those essays in detention.” He laughed as the kids scrambled out of their seats. Dean waited silently until the last one had left, doing his best to ignore their whispers.
“Well, someone is cheery this morning,” his dad peeked over his glasses with an accusatory look, “This wouldn’t have anything to do with that Dean boy would it?”
“Oh, those aren’t real,” Dean answered, glancing over at him. “I have other ones though,” he continued after seeing Cas’s disappointed face.
Minutes went by. Cas hadn’t responded. Finally, after what felt like an hour Cas asked: When are you coming back to school?
“Astronomy at Heaven’s Gates,” Cas smiled, “My classes are mostly sophomores and juniors looking for an easy A. And you?”
There was so much that Castiel wanted to do. To Dean. To himself. Some things seemed plausible for their current situation. Some things would have to wait until later. Most things required him to stop what was happening and no force on heaven or earth could do that. Most of all, he wanted Dean. He wanted to feel him. To hear him. To smell and see and taste him. He wanted to lose himself in Dean. Nothing else mattered.
“Oh dear,” Rowena tsked when they burst in, “What happened?”
“Do you want to get out of here?” Dean asked, his lips brushing against the bare part of Cas’s shoulder. The words were spoken so softly that Cas almost didn’t hear him over the song.
“Finally,” Gabe said, “So, what’s our plan of attack?”
“Hey, Ellen,” Dean answered. Ellen pulled him into a bear hug when she reached him, only letting him go when he said he couldn’t breathe. He heard Cas laugh behind him and shot him a dirty look.
“Off to work?” Dean asked, panting slightly. Cas tried his best not to pay attention to it.
“Hi,” Eli said with a smile,” what can I get you today?”
“Yeah man, text me the address,” Dean said. Maybe he’d be able to pick up a chick or two to take his mind off the blue-eyed boy for a while. Dean’s cell phone pinged with the texted address.
“No,” he whispered, “No. Not this again. Cas-“ he said frantically. He looked up at Cas, “please,” he whispered, “don’t leave me.”
Cas relaxed a little as Dean pushed the up button on the elevator. He glanced up, meeting Dean’s eyes. He licked his lips unconsciously, drawing Dean’s eyes to them. Cas shifted closer until their mouths were almost touching.
Dean walked into his room after showering in his usual Jeans, flannel, and gray shirt. He was rubbing his damp hair with a towel. Cas was standing by his desk. He was inspecting something in his hand that Dean couldn’t see what though.
“Dean, wait,” Castiel grabbed his other hand, pinning it against the table. Dean stopped, the hand clutching his side relaxed a little. “Dean?” Cas asked, pulling away his hand. Immediately, Dean was pressing his hand into his side again. Hesitantly, Castiel touched his arm. “Dean? What-”
“Winchester,” Coach Cain called him over. Dean picked up his water bottle from the bench. His breath was coming in pants, his body not yet adjusted from his coma, “Take it easy out there today. This is your first practice since you woke up. Don’t push yourself. We don’t want to make things worse.”
“Yeah, coach,” Dean wheezed. He sat down on the bench, giving himself a break. Pain pierced his side and back. His lungs felt weak. He downed some more water, scanning the bleachers. People were scattered across them. Cas sat on the top row on the far left of the benches. Dean smiled to himself, raising his arm in a wave. Cas waved back timidly.
“Girls, usually,” she answered with a cackle. Dean took a shot at her arm, missing as she dodged. He looked up at Cas again. Sam had made his way over and was talking to him. They were both laughing at something Sam had said. “Go talk to him,” Charlie said, shoving him away from the grill, “I can handle this.”
Another sigh escaped him when he saw who sent it, this time, one of disappointment. It was just Gabe making sure he was still going to the party tonight. Cas had forgotten all about the party. His main focus yesterday had been on the cute barista and Dean Winchester.
“Okay,” Cas said, hiding a smile against Dean’s shoulder.
“I don’t mind helping,” Cas answered, already reaching for some empty beer bottles on the table, “I’m right next door, anyways. I’d feel guilty not helping.”
Castiel looked up at him, pulling away slightly, “Do you,” he took a breath to steady himself, “do you want this?”
Refocusing his attention on his phone, he clicked on the message icon and texted back that he was coming to the party. He turned the device off and walked out of the bathroom. There was still a while before the party and the much-needed distraction of getting wasted. He hummed to himself as he walked out of the bathroom to his bedroom to put on some clothes.
It didn’t last long before he was getting shaken awake by a familiar pair of hands.
“Okay,” Cas replied, shrugging his dad’s arm off his shoulder.
“That thing threw us clear across the room when we touched it,” Dean spat. Castiel grabbed his arm, holding him back.
“That’s Uhm, that’s good,” Dean breathed, his face flushed, “I uh, I am to-” Castiel cut him off with a kiss. He rolled his hips forward into Dean’s with renewed confidence. His breath hitching in his throat at the contact. “Cas,” Dean pleaded into the kiss. The sound of Dean moaning his name was nearly enough to push him over the edge. Biting back his own moan as he ground their hips together faster.
“Yes. Now, go get dressed before I change my mind,” Chuck smiled at him.
Cas didn’t answer. Something behind Dean caught his eyes. His face broke out into a sad smile. Dean was just about to look behind him when something touched his shoulders. He looked down in time to see black goo creep its way up his arms towards Cas.
Dean forced his eyes open. There was a bright light and lots of machinery. A parametric hovered over him.
“Why did you back away?” Cas shot back.
Dean finally gets a chance to kiss Cas. However, when he tries to take it, Cas pulls away, leaving Dean embarrassed and ready for another drink. Dean later finds Cas kissing Eli and, feeling hurt and betrayed, tries to escape in his car. This doesn't go well and Dean gets in an accident.
Dean took a minute to respond: The Doctor said I should be okay to go by Thursday. Why?
Dean looked at him again. Tears started to well up in his eyes. Cas’s face softened. Dean took a deep breath, “I’m sorry. For the other night. I didn’t mean to upset you,” Dean said quietly, his voice wavering.
“So no drinks this time,” Anna said while holding back another laugh.
“Long.” Cas’s father shot back bluntly. Cas chuckled.
He finished getting ready, Sam was already waiting in the car. Dean did one final mirror check, quickly fixing an out of place strand of hair. He grabbed his duffle bag with a grunt and strut out of the motel room, locking it behind him.
“Yeah, not really my type,” Dean said, not looking away from Cas.
Sam remained unamused. “We have to work” he buried his face back in the book and kept it there, even when the waitress sauntered over carrying a tray with their food and coffee, which was unusual for a diner but it was early. Dean eagerly tore into his burger and wondered what the day would bring. They were planning to meet up with Castiel back at the bunker. They were only in town for a case involving some odd hybrid between a vampire and changeling. It was weird, but so were monsters.
A light was shining into his room. Dean groaned at the glare, hiding his face in the neck of the girl next to him. What time was it? He glanced at the clock on the nightstand. 6:15 AM, too early for Dean. He lifted his head, looking for the source of light.
Someone must have heard his silent prayer because Dean came rushing in just before the bell rang. Although he looked like he had just rolled out of bed, he was still incredibly handsome. The green eyes locked onto Cas’s as Dean took his seat in front of him.
Cas didn't remember much past seeing the accident. He remembered running over to the car, someone yelling about calling 911, and sirenes.
“Here,” Cas said, tapping Dean’s shoulder with the cup, “it’s to make up for Wednesday. I wasn’t sure how you like it so I just got black. I got it a while ago though, so it’s cold now. Sorry.” He blushed, realizing he was rambling. Dean had turned around in his seat and was now looking at Cas with a smile. It was evident he was holding back a laugh.
By the time class was over, Cas’s nerves had died down. He knew better than to ask for the keys to the truck during classes. He’d ask after school was out.
Dean sighed, taking a drink of the fresh beer before standing up.
“Hey, Dean.” a low voice said behind him with a nudge to his shoulder, “You going to Adam’s party?”
Sirens.
“Hello to you too,” Cas laughed, pulling out of the kiss.
“You do?” Cas cocked his head, confused. Eyes flicking around Dean’s head looking for them.
Dean: I was jealous. I felt stupid and embarrassed. I’m new to this whole...gay thing.
“Where do you want to go?” Dean asked.
“Good morning,” Cas told his dad, forcing a smile and grabbing some cereal from the cabinet above the fridge.
I hope you like this chapter, sorry it took so long to get out. I've been really busy since school started again and haven't had much time to write. This was probably my favorite chapter I've written so far because of the excessive sexual tension and chemistry between the two.
“N-nothing.” Cas managed to get out.
He turned his eyes and head slightly to put a name to the voice. It was Kevin.
“Yeah, why?” Dean asked with a glance in his direction before shoving the key into the handle and unlocking the door.
Their lips separated after a little while. They pressed their foreheads together, not ready to stop touching but too overwhelmed with emotion to continue the kiss. What little space there was left between them filled with their heavy breath.
“Partially,” Cas answered, his voice hoarse with sleep.
“Oh,” Dean said.
“Yes, but first,” Dean summoned the remainder of his strength and pulled Cas into another kiss, “I love you too, my little angel” he whispered, gently planting another kiss on Cas’s lips before letting him go.
“Yeah, grab a mug, they’re in the cabinet above it,” he said, gesturing at the coffee maker. Cas pulled himself off the door and walked over to it. Pouring some coffee into his cup, he turned around eyes watching Dean again. He crept up behind him, hands finding their way around Dean’s waist with a satisfied sigh.
“Dean,” Cas whispered his name. Their lips were painfully close but not yet touching.
“Wait, Cas,” Dean blurted, standing. Cas turned his eyes towards Dean, looking at him expectantly. Before Dean could think about what he was doing, he closed the distance between him and Cas.
Cas had taken off his jacket and wadded it into a sort of pillow as he lay on the ground, staring at the sky. It was dark up here but Dean could see him clearly. He felt his breath hitch as he stood there, staring at the beautiful human laying in front of him. Charlie cleared her throat, nudging his side and gesturing for him to sit next to Cas.
“Okay,” Cas managed to choke out.
Dean: Lemme guess, you need a ride.
“Cas!” a yell, this time he was being shaken.
Cas took a while to decide what to wear. Eventually, he stood in front of the bathroom mirror in skinny jeans, a plain white tee, and a jacket overtop it. He ruffled his hair a bit to make it spiker and put on some extra deodorant before leaving the bathroom. It was about 10:30 when he and Balthazar crept downstairs and outside. Gabe had agreed to meet them at the end of the block to avoid suspicion.
Castiel’s morning had been uneventful as usual. He didn’t have any friends in his first-class today. Instead of gossiping about the new kid, he stared out the window listening to the hushed whispers of girls debating about what he would look like. Cas finally glanced at the front of the classroom when Mr. Shurley cleared his throat. By his side was a boy. His eyes were scanning the students. Cas looked back out the window. Sure the boy was cute but Cas had no intention of talking to him. Not at the moment at least.
He found himself guiding his fingers towards Dean's own. He tucked them in the space between Dean’s palm and the mattress. Warmth spread where their skin touched. Cas smiled gently to himself as he traced the skin gently with his thumb. Without thinking about it, he leaned down and placed a lingering kiss on Dean’s forehead. Judging by the lipstick marks he found there, he wasn’t the first to do so, but he was certain he was the only boy to do so.
“Hey Sleeping Beauty.” a voice said. It was accompanied by a small thunk. Cas peeked out from behind his hands. Dean had set the drinks on his desk and was now gesturing to the bottles. “I got you something.” he smiled.
“You, what!” Charlie exclaimed, “That’s great!”
Lots of love from your local homo,
“Nice catch,” he muttered, finally finding words.
“Right,” Cas said, looking down at the dress, then twisting his head as far as it would go to look at his laced up back. He let out a defeated sigh, turning to Dean, “Do you mind?” He asked, twisting around.
“What are we talking about?” he said nonchalantly. A small smile spread on Cas’s face as he felt Dean’s hand grab his under the table. The conversation faded to the back of his head as he picked at his food. Dean had asked him out on a date. Today. Did this make them official?
I am so sorry. Somehow the last few paragraphs of chapter 4 didn't get copied and I just today realized that they didn't . So here's part two of the last chapter. The next chapter might take a little bit longer to publish because I've hit a bad writers block on all of my projects. I'm working on it though.
Thank you for 3 Kudos, 2 Bookmarks, and 76 Hits!
A glance over towards the anxious ocean-colored eyes brought a small smile to his face which he quickly hid with another sip. He felt his face straighten out with the last sip, turning his head to fully look into the blue eyes. “Just the way I like it.” he managed to get out. It earned him a small smile and blush from the other boy.
Cas turned back to him slowly, smiling awkwardly, “How about that drink then?”
“I don’t know,” Dean interrupted, “I don’t know if I want to know.”
“Dean, I don’t-” he stuttered, “I can’t-”
“C’mon, don’t leave now,” Dean rasped, “it was just getting good.”
Dean finally looked around the Diner, they were the only ones in there with the exception of a lonely old man sitting at the high rise counter, staring at our waitress’ ass. Dean nudged Sam’s arm to draw his attention to it, trying hard to stuffle his laugh.
“Dammit,” Dean swore, leaning farther down in his chair. Their feet touched under the table. Dean gasped, pulling back quickly. He sat up, shifting in his chair, “I should-I should go.” He stood, hand gripping his side again.
Dean: This wasn’t your fault.
Dean sat, unmoved, at his desk. Wondering if that actually happened. He chuckled to himself as he thought of the other boy’s messy bedhead and dazed out, sleepy face. If that wasn’t relatable he wasn’t sure what was.
“Shit,” he swore, bending down to pick them up. Dean bent down with him, grabbing some. Castiel didn’t realize how close they were until he looked up. Dean was crouched, staring at him. Their faces were less than three inches apart. Neither moved. Dean’s eyes flicked down to Cas’s lips making him lick them instinctually.
“But it is. If I had just- I mean-” Cas said between tired sobs.
The rusty hinges of the barn doors whined as they were opened. Dust exploded from behind them, making Dean cough. He walked in. Glass and debris crunched under the souls of his boots. His fingers traced the black symbols marking the wall.
Now, he was sitting in the back of the Ambulance next to where Dean lay unconscious. He was told that he needed to come in for questioning and since he didn’t have a car he had to ride in the ambulance. He would have asked to go regardless, he was the reason behind the crash after all and Dean was his friend.
“Your morning voice is hot,” he said, face flushing as he stared.
Hey guys!
On the day of the party, Cas woke up to fighting coming from the other room. It was probably his dad and one of his brothers fighting over something stupid. He groaned quietly and stretched his aching limbs. The blinds in his shared room had been opened and sunlight shone through the window. Cas closed his eyes again, rolling over onto his side and burying his face in one of his pillows as a shield against the harsh morning sunlight. His blanket had wrapped itself around one leg and his torso. He shivered at the chill that hit the exposed spots on his hip and back.
Cas rocked his hips forward experimentally, drawing a whine out of Dean. He pulled away from the kiss to look at him. Dean’s eyes were closed, his teeth now clamped around his slightly swollen bottom lip. Castiel could feel his nails digging into his back. Another rock of his hips had Dean leaning his head back, exposing his neck ever so slightly. Cas took the opportunity, dropping his hands down to cage Dean in and pressing a trail of light kisses against the exposed skin. His lips trailed up to the spot just below Dean's ear. “Jesus,” Dean groaned as Castiel sucked gently at it.
“Do you want to go on a date with me?” he murmured in Dean’s ear.
Cas peaked his head around the door. Dean wasn’t there but a few more of his classmates had arrived. They all looked as dead as Cas felt. He walked back over to his desk, trying not to trip. His father gave him a sympathetic smile when he sat down.
Cas’s hair wasn’t too terrible thankfully. There was a visibly damp line on his cheek. He was probably drooling. Cas groaned. Before splashing some cool water on his face. He used the water accumulated on his hands to try and control his bed head. It took a minute for his head to clear up and to gain the confidence to go back to the classroom.
“You seem, tense,” Cas replied in his usual monotone voice, “I could fix it?” he offered, starting to reach out to Dean.
“Thank you,” Cas said, grabbing the papers out of his hand and shoving them on the stack. He somehow managed to unlock the car door and opened it, throwing the papers on the passenger seat.
Cas left the room to search the halls for his friends before they left for the day. His backpack felt heavy. It pulled against his tired shoulders as he shoved by his peers. His eyes roamed the crowd, eventually catching sight of a familiar pair of green eyes wandering his way. He smiled as the other boy passed hoping the gesture would be returned, remembering to buy him a coffee the following morning. Dean was engaged in a conversation with a pretty girl and didn’t notice him. Cas had to think for a second to recall her name eventually remembering that it was Meg. Cas caught a bit of their conversation when they passed. It was something about the party on Saturday. Apparently, they were going.
They sat there for seemingly hours, relishing in what had just happened. Fear that they might wake up and find it was a dream settling in their hearts.
“You were acting kinda weird today,” Dean said, concern filling his eyes.
And so the crush began.
“We lived here before. We moved a couple of years after,” Dean hesitated, “after my mom died. I’m surprised I remember it.”
“What?” Cas exclaimed.
“Mister Winchester!” Mr. Shurley yelled.
“Yep,” Dean said, already dragging him towards the bedroom.
“Hello, Dean,” he responded, praying his voice sounded level.
After a few minutes of debate, he pulled up Cas’s contact. His fingers hovered over the keyboard as he decided what to say. Eventually, he settled for a simple ‘You up?’
“Good thing it’s not a party,” Dean smiled, “just a small gathering with some friends and family.”
Sam obviously didn’t believe him but didn’t pry, filling Dean with relief.
He woke up a few hours later to an empty cold. Dean was gone. Cas sighed, shifting on the bed so he could reach the maid dress on the floor without getting up. He pulled his phone out of the pocket on the apron. The time read 9:37 AM. He had gotten approximately 6 hours of sleep.
“That was,” Cas started, grasping for a word but unable to find one.
Dean Drove out of the space he was in, thankful that the person parked in front of him had parked so far ahead which made for an easy escape. He was careful not to hurt Cas or his baby on the way out but as soon as he made it past the other car’s bunker, he was speeding off.
“So what’s your type?” Cas asked, aiming for subtle flirty but probably coming off creepy.
“What?” Cas asked.
Dean: See you at 10
Cas answered back with surprising speed: Always.
“Cas,” Dean called from his driveway. Castiel’s stomach fluttered when he heard the nickname. Turning he saw Dean jogging towards where he stood. Something a bit lower fluttered.
“Okay,” Sammy said hesitantly. Dean stared at him, raising his eyebrows, hoping he would get the hint, “Well, I’m gonna get another beer. Either of you want one?”
“Everyone I’d like you to meet Dean Winchester,” the teacher said, gesturing towards Dean, “Please take a seat.”
“Shit, that’s tomorrow?” he said, surprised.
Dean was the first inside and once he got in he immediately headed towards his room to get some shut eye. His plans were foiled by Sam grabbing the back of his loose t-shirt and dragging him to the Study where Cas was waiting. Dean sighed in annoyance and exhaustion. “Come on, man.” he said with exasperation.
“Forming a game plan. Get your ass down here. We're in the cafeteria.” Gabe texted.
“Thank you,” Dean replied. Maybe it was the lighting, but Cas could have sworn Dean’s cheeks tinted a bit at the comment, “Glad to meet a man of taste,” he said, turning over the engine. Cas adjusted his skirt as they drove. Somehow, it had managed to ride up, exposing the under part of his thighs. He grumbled to himself as he pushed off the seat a bit and swept his hands under him to lay it flat.
“He was late for work, I didn’t have enough time,” Dean shot back.
Cas smiled a little to himself, walking inside, “No reason.”
The group shoved their way through the crowd of people to get some drinks from the bar. It was filled with alcohol and surrounded by drunk high schoolers.

Darkness.
Mr. Shurley let out a ‘tsk’ of annoyance as Castiel ran out of the room. Dean stooped down and unzipped the front pocket of his bag, grabbing some cash from it before zipping it back up. He stood and walked out the door. Dean tugged on the bottom of his ridden up T-shirt as he wandered down the hall to the Cafeteria. His eyes quickly scanned the lunchroom in search of some kind of vending machine. He finally spotted one and bought two Gatorades. One was purple, the other light blue. He wandered haphazardly around the halls, looking for Castiel. He gave up after a few minutes and went back to the classroom. It had a few more kids in it then before but it was still pretty empty. Dean looked over towards his desk. He smiled when he saw Castiel sitting in the desk behind his. Cas looked a little more cleaned up. His hair was more controlled and his eyes were more alert. The dribble remains from his nap earlier had been washed away. Upon seeing Dean his face grew red once again as he tried to sink into his seat further to hide from view. Dean chuckled. Damn, this boy was cute.
He got dressed and wandered downstairs. His father was sitting at the table like usual, sipping on his coffee, and reading his paper. Judging by his attire, he’d just gotten back from Mass. Cas peaked around the corner and found Michael, who also looked like he’d just gotten back from Mass, and Balthazar relaxing on the couch and watching cartoons.
“Don’t beat yourself up, Cas. I’m sure he’d like you if he wasn’t straight. Hell, I would like you if I was gay.” Gabriel stated with complete confidence, making Castiel chuckle.
“Sort of,” Dean answered.
Dean was about to answer when Charlie started calling him over, “Shit, I’d better go,” he said looking back at Cas with an apologetic smile. He held his eyes for just a second longer before turning and going over to Charlie.
Cas’s father sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Fine,” he gave in, handing Cas the keys,” but you’d better leave now. That line’s always long and we still have to beat traffic.”
“Agree to disagree. Your bacon is burning,” Cas said.
His eyes wandered around the kitchen as he waited for the coffee to brew. He found himself looking out the window at Dean’s room. Castiel couldn’t see much. Just a shadow of Dean spooning someone. He sighed and turned back to the coffee.
Cas glanced up at the menu as he tried to get his heart to stop beating so fast. Once it had he looked back down into the other’s eyes with his own smile.
Hi guys! It's been a hot minute. I've been super busy so I only have time to write in the dead of night and usually I'm too tired. Anyways, heres the long awaited epilogue. I was going to do something else but this was more of an epilogue. I decided to turn this into a series so keep an eye out for that. I only meant this to be about 1k words but it got away from me. It's also a lot angsty-er then my writing normally is. Ngl I kinda used it to vent. I hope you enjoy it anyway. More parts are coming, I'm already working on Part 2 of the series. The theme? Prom. I might also do a smut chapter in the future if I'm feeling, I am asexual so idk how well it will go but some of my favorite smuts were written by asexuals so if they can do it so can I. That's pretty much everything, enjoy the chapter. Feel free to leave a kudos or give me some feedback!
“Am I early?” Castiel asked, glancing at his watch.
Cas had always liked showers, alone or with someone. Showering alone was good, but showering with somebody else was amazing. Once you get past the awkwardness and the tight squeeze, that is. Showering with someone is intimate and useful. They can help you reach those places you never quite seem to be able to alone. Like that small spot on your back that you miss because your arms don’t quite bend that way.
“A bit late, isn’t it?” Dean asked, squinting at the watch on Castiel’s wrist. Cas flipped his wrist, checking the time out of habit, and dropped some of the papers in his hand on the ground.
Cas thought, sipping his water. “I don’t know. Both I guess. You didn’t save me though,” he said into the glass.
“Oh, nothing,” Rowena responded, picking through the papers on the desk in front of her, “You best be on your way, dearies. Got lots to do.” Dean stood for a moment, glaring at her, before thundering out of the room. Castiel turned to follow. “Oh and, Cas,” Rowena said. He stopped but didn’t turn back to face her, “Keep an eye on him. He might be a bit- touchy.”
As soon as the door shut, Dean broke. He slouched back into the couch. His eyes and lungs stung. He felt vulnerable, weak. He shut his eyes tight, trying to stop any more tears from escaping.
The waitress left to relay their orders to the chef.
“Nice to meet you, Cas,” he said with a familiar gleam in his eyes, “Have a nice day” he finished with a wink.
“Dean.” Sam said, jerking Dean out of his trance, “Earth to Dean, please respond.” Sam continued sarcastically, getting an annoyed look out of Dean. “What were you thinking about?”
He and Adam had grown up close friends until High School so Cas had been over to the house frequently and knew nearly all of its secrets.
“U-huh,” Chuck replied, his tone dripping with disbelief. Cas hadn’t come out to his family yet as gay but he was sure his Dad already knew. Luckily he never pushed Cas to say it out loud.
“Shall we?” Dean asked, gesturing dramatically towards the door to the diner.
Cas was silent for a bit: I’m sorry.
“What the Hell are you doing here, man?” Dean asked, glancing towards the angel’s arms.
“Oh, uh, thank you,” Cas said, accepting the offerings. He stood, his legs shaky but usable, and walked over towards the door Dean had pointed at. He stopped, hand hovering over the handle, and turned towards Dean again, “Do you want to join me?”
It took him a while to navigate his way back to the main stairs but he got there eventually. He headed down the stairs to look for Charlie and get some more alcohol. Not that there was enough alcohol in the world to sate his embarrassment. He refilled his drink a few times and continued his search for Charlie.
“Boyfriend, huh?” Cas said, smiling at him.
“Really? Wow, I’m flattered.” Dean replied, squinting up at him with a half smile on his face and yawned.
(See the end of the chapter for
Always, Cas lied. He stood up, unplugging his phone and walking out of his room as quietly as he could to not wake Balthazar. He crept across the hall to the bathroom, avoiding the creaky spots. He shut the door and turned on the lights as soon as he stepped in.
“N-nothing,” Dean answered. It quickly followed by another groan as he folded in on himself. Rowena hummed at him again, clearly not believing him.
Cas shifted next to him. Dean glanced over to find Cas smiling up at him. He had tucked his arm behind his head for some extra cushion. Dean felt his cheeks heat up as the blue eyes scanned his face.
Dean responded quickly: How?
“Friend of yours?” Coach asked, glancing up from the clipboard in his hands.
He led them to a car parked at the back of the school. Dean pulled up the directions on his phone after they got in. It had been a couple of years since he’d been able to visit this place.
“What did you do?” Charlie snapped back, “You broke his heart that’s what.”
Castiel could see a lot from his bedroom window. Stuff he wanted to see. Stuff he could go without seeing. Something he had was a very clear view into Dean’s bedroom at night. Dean’s bed was positioned right in front of the window and if he had curtains, he never used them. Which in turn, made Cas buy curtains.
“It’s perfect, thank you,” Cas said, glancing to Dean. Dean grinned at him.
That conversation helped Cas get through the rest of the day with a relatively peaceful mindset.
“Yeah, my parents were pretty obsessed with angles,” he explained, chuckling awkwardly.
Dean sighed, “No, it’s not. Just drop it.”
Dean’s face was already damp with tears but another betrayed him, running quickly down his cheek. Cas raised his hand to Dean’s face. His palm pressed against Dean’s cheek as he wiped some of the moisture from under the closed eye. Cas lifted his head and let his lips meet Dean’s once again. Dean melted into the kiss.
“When he tried to kiss you and you ran away, embarrassing him and making him think you weren’t gay and now we walk in here to find you kissing him,” Charlie said, jerking her thumb toward Eli who was standing awkwardly in the back of the room.
Castiel chuckled, pecking Dean’s lips, “How about I take you on a date first?”
“Are you gonna ask him?” she asked, glancing over at the girl, “Or are you gonna take the excuse to get out of it? Again.”
Dean looked at him, holding his eyes for a second before leaning back in his chair. “I don’t know man.” Castiel cocked his head. “Can’t you use some of your mojo to check?”
The reason for Cas doing what he did next depended on how you look at the situation. One could blame it on the distance between them, their drunkenness, or Cas’s general guilt and horniness. Who’s to say? All Cas could remember was grabbing the other's T-shirt, pulling him into a kiss, and that kiss ending abruptly when two people entered the room.
Dean: What show?
“Hey,” Cas replied awkwardly. Charlie scooted over on the bench, making room for him and Dean. She patted the spot next to her. Cas took the invite, setting his lunch tray next to hers. Dean claimed the spot next to him, pressing their arms together. If anyone noticed, they didn’t say anything.
“You didn’t ask him?” Charlie practically yelled.
“What’s my ‘type’,” Dean asked.
“You know,” Dean answered, voice equally quiet, eyes flitting back and forth between Cas’s eyes and lips.
Cas gave up on his quest to find his friends and headed back to his father’s classroom. Dropping his heavy bag on the floor he slumped into his seat. He heard his dad’s pen scribbling on some papers.
His dad didn’t say anything about the second coffee or the information written on Castiel’s cup. He barely acknowledged it with a questioning look, prompting Cas to explain. Cas ignored him in favor of sipping his iced coffee sleepily.
He made eye contact with his Dad when he got downstairs who was sipping coffee and reading a newspaper.
“That’s for me to decide,” he countered. He stretched his legs out in front of him and leaned back on one hand, picking up his own drink in the other, “What makes you think you’re not? You bought me coffee. That was pretty cool in my book.”
Cas waved awkwardly at them with his free hand; in his other, he held a six-pack of his favorite beer. He turned, holding it out to Dean, “I wasn’t sure what to bring.”
He leaned forward, pecking Cas on the lips. “Bedroom,” he said, pushing Cas off him just enough so that he could lean off the door. He turned, dragging Cas with him, planting little kisses on him as they moved. A gasp escaped Cas as Dean’s lips found his neck, just above where the choker sat.
“Hiya,” the man smiled down at him. Castiel stared back at him dumbly. The man was even more attractive up close, despite the weird angle. Freckles dotted his face. A silver septum ring dangled from his nose, matching the piercing on his eyebrow.
Cas chuckled, whipping his eyes, “I should call a nurse or a doctor.”
Castiel relished in every feeling. How their tongues pressed together. How their mouths fit together. The feel of Dean’s tongue piercing moved around in his mouth. The strain on his lungs because he never wanted this to stop. Dean was the first to pull away, his breath shallow. “Jesus,” he muttered, his hands dropping to Cas’s shoulder again.
“Who’s this?” Ellen asked, looking over at Cas with a smile.
Luckily Dean’s dad hadn’t taken the Impala when he’d left town so Dean had something flashy to drive and impress the ladies.
“I don’t do parties,” Cas said into his coffee cup.
“No! Nothing like that.” Castiel assured him. It had been a couple of weeks since Dean had transferred to their school. He’d started a few weeks after the second semester began. Cas had noticed the air getting warmer. Spring was on its way along, bringing along Promposals and a new set of gossip.
He was even cuter up close. Cas tried his hardest not to blush, though he was sure some of the heat made it to his cheeks. Dean had beautiful green eyes that were crinkled with his perfect smile. His cheek and jawbones were sharp. There was a light sprinkle of freckles brushing his face.
“Remind me, how many times have you caught him staring at you?” Charlie asked, taking a swig of her beer.
“You can go. I can clean this up on my own,” Dean sighed, his head was pleasantly clouded.
“When did y’all move back?” Ellen asked.
“Considering what?” Cas asked.
He was in bad shape. A trickle of blood ran down his forehead, his arm and some of his ribs were probably broken, he was hooked up to an IV bag along with various other tubes. By the time they reached the hospital, he was already wrapped in many other bandages.
Cas:  I caused the accident. You saw me kissing Eli and I hurt you and made you leave and I tried to stop you but you didn’t and it’s my fault.
“A friend invited me. What about you?” Eli asked.
“Sure,” Cas grinned, “Uh, where’d you get your piercings done?”
“Hello, handsome,” he smirked, looking Cas up and down before pulling him into a kiss. Cas smiled into the kiss, his face tinted pink. Neither of them was wearing anything fancy. Dean was sporting his letterman jacket over a white shirt and jeans, while Cas wore a hoodie and jeans.
“It’s past noon,” his dad replied. Cas rolled his eyes with his back turned. Once he had his cereal poured, he sat down across the table from his father and started eating, “So, did you hear?”
Dean nodded and Cas ran out before he could say anymore.
“Do you?” Cas laughed.
Love you all!
“I know,” Cas said.
“You could have saved me,” he said, his voice broken.
“Remember what?” Dean asked, shaking Cas’s shoulders, “Come on, you have to give me something here Cas.”
“Okay,” his father replied. He paused once more before he reached out and put his hand on Cas’s shoulder, “Just…know I’m always here for you and you know I’ll love you no matter what.”
Charlie: Dean Winchester, you see right through me. See you at 10?
Dean smiled, grateful for the help and the opportunity to get to know Cas better. He grabbed some of the half-full dishes, leading Cas inside. ”Recycling goes in there,” he said, pointing towards a large paper bag in the corner. Cas nodded, walking over and dropping the beer bottles into the bag before walking out the door for another load. Dean busied himself with boxing up the food. His eyes traced Cas as he walked in and out of the house. They managed to clean everything up in about 15 minutes.
“Me too,” Dean grinned. Cas opened his eyes to find Dean staring back. The green in them was reduced to a thin line.
At first, Dean just stared up at the sky, processing what had just happened. Groaning in embarrassment, he shoved the balls of his hand into his eyes.
Dean chuckled, “Don’t worry, I think you’re hot too.”
Castiel stood, staring out his window at the darkening sky. He glanced down, just for a second, and saw Dean sprawled, naked, on his bed. Cas choked on the water he was drinking. He ran to the bathroom, spitting it into the sink and coughing.
Dean beamed, “It starts at 5 but come whenever.”
Once he recovered from the shock, Dean melted into the kiss. His hands made their way between them to cradle Cas’s jaw, a thumb trailing a line across his cheekbone. The elevator dinged again, making the pair break apart.
“I love you,” Cas murmured.
“Cas?” Dean asked. Cas looked up at him, “You okay?”
They stood, separating when they got to the hall. Dean had Chemistry on the opposite side of the school from Cas. They met again at the entrance of the lunchroom to eat. Gabe and Anna didn’t have the same lunch period as him today so he would’ve been sitting alone anyway. Dean led him over to a table in the corner.
(See the end of the chapter for
A loud croak pulled Cas from his slumber. He reflexively sat up, still half asleep. Someone was sitting in the desk in front of him. Cas blinked. Once. Twice. His vision cleared. It was a panicked boy. Cas’s still tired brain took a second to register who it was. He gasped in horror when it finally sank it. It was Dean. Sitting there. Staring at Cas.
Cas rushed upstairs and threw on the first shirt and pants he saw. He wound up in jeans and a blue flannel.
“Really?” the man mused, “I’m Dean.”
“Dean, manners,” Ellen scolded, making Cas laugh. Dean mock scowled at them. It felt nice, comfortable.
Eli: Hey Cas!
He smiled, Charlie of course knew he was going to the party, what she meant was more along the lines of “Are you gonna help me pick up some chicks”.
“Dean,” she said, her voice soft. She put down the coffee mug and walked around the counter towards them.
“What?” he asked, looking uncomfortable.
“I’m sorry,” he said.
“You can take the pilot,” his dad said, decisively.
“Okay,” Sam said, pulling off the wall, “Well, sleep tight.”
12 hours and 3 picked up people later, Dean, Charlie, Benny, and Kevin stood at one end of a magnificent driveway. The large, car-crowded, arched pavement led up to an even more majestic mansion. It was like something out of a magazine for the rich.
“You sure about that?” Dean whispered in his ear. Cas jumped, wondering when Dean had gotten behind him. Dean’s breath on his neck sent a shiver down his spine.
Cas took a few long, shuddering breaths before quickly making his way back down to get another drink.
However, much to Cas’s surprise, the second his lips left Dean’s head, the boy's hand clenched around his own. Cas stared at the hands in shock. Not entirely sure what had happened or how to react, he gently pulled his hand out from the other’s. On his way out of the door, he bumped into a man wearing a brown jacket and jeans. The name John Winchester was plastered on a nametag on his jacket. Dean’s father Cas guessed.
Stand by for part 2!
Dean smiled, “Cool.”
Fire started to pool in his abdomen. He was past the point of no return, “Dean,” was all he managed to get out. A silent plea he hoped was heard.
Cas’s phone buzzed, jolting him from his light sleep. He picked it up, hissing at the glare from the screen. It was a message from Dean: You up?
“What?” Dean asked, feeling his jaw hit the table with the word.
“Charlie’s got it,” he shrugged, hoping he sounded more confident than he was. Charlie waved at them with the spatula.
Dean had just dragged Charlie onto the dance floor when he saw a familiar figure walk past. He nudged Charlie and gestured, hoping she’d get the hint. Instead, she turned around obliviously and knocked Cas’s back as he attempted to fight his way through a tight group of people. Thank God for Charlie’s fast reaction time. She was already smiling and dodging the drink in the other’s hand as he whipped around. He made eye contact with her and smiled softly. Dean drank the expression in, missing what Charlie.
Dean took a sip of his drink, “Thanks for your help, and for coming.”
For hours, Dean sat, fighting back tears, John screaming about what a fucking idiot Dean was. It was 9:30 by the time he was done. His voice had grown gravelly. “I’m going out,” He proclaimed, grabbing his jacket and keys before storming out the door.
“I’m okay,” he said in between coughs, “What the hell was that?”
Sam and Dean stopped at a Diner for breakfast. They sat down at a table and waited for the waitress to come ask them what they wanted. The two looked at eachother, noting the shared exhaustion. Maybe they wouldn’t be as tired if they hadn’t stayed up until 4 in the morning doing research.
“I,” Dean started, hesitating as he searched for an excuse, “I don’t know,” He finally said. Cas was staring at him, “I don’t.”
Cas glanced up from the book in his hands, feeling eyes watching him. Dean was standing in the middle of the field. He started towards the bleachers when they made eye contact. Cas checked the time on his phone; 4:49, perfect timing. He stood meeting Dean at the bottom of the bleachers. Sweat made his hair cling to his forehead and his breath was coming in short huffs but a smile was stretching across his face as he tugged Cas into a kiss.
“Yeah,” Dean breathed, his eyes flitting between Cas’s eyes and lips.
They finished their breakfast, paid, and got back on the road.
“There you go, I hope you don’t mind chocolate,” she said to Cas, “This was Dean’s favorite when he was little.”
Dean: I was jealous. I felt stupid and embarrassed. I’m new to this whole...gay thing.
“That’s the idea,” Cas said, making Dean snort.
“I know, but it wasn’t your fault at all. I promise,” Gabe smiled back at him sympathetically, “Let’s just get you home and to sleep.”
Cas gave his dad a small death glare for foiling his attempt but his back was already turned away from the students as he jotted the class plan on the board. The smile soon returned and stayed after he took another sip of the oddly flavored drink.
“Thanks,” the man laughed, helping him back onto his feet. Once he was fully upright, Cas started adjusting the dress. He paused, feeling the man staring at him. “Nice costume,” he praised, looking Cas up and down, “You don’t see many men in maid dresses.”
“Well, it’s nice to meet you, Cas.” Dean said with a wink before turning back to the front of the class as Mr. Shurley began the lesson.
“Nah,” Dean said, he didn’t think he could handle feeling the angel’s soft fingers touching him, especially with the massive hangover he was suffering through.
“Dean Winchester, you will never cease to amaze me,” he said, giving him an appreciative look before delving back into the kiss. Their legs slotted together, chests pressing against each other. He brought his hands up to cup his jaw as Dean’s snaked lower, landing on his lower back. Castiel shivered as his fingers slipped under his shirt, grazing gently over his back.
“Hey, Cas!” Charlie shouted, it was hard to hear over the music.
Cas is invited to a party this Saturday. Dean gives Cas a drink one day. Cas repays him by buying him a Coffee from Starbucks where he meets Eli, a cute and flirty barista who throws Cas into a loop as a new love interest is introduced.
“I know. I’m Castiel.” Cas responded as he gingerly shook the other boy’s hand. Sparks. He must have imagined that.
Sam retreated to bed after finishing eating. Dean followed shortly after, checking to make sure everything was clean to avoid angering John again.
“You’re here early, Mr. Winchester.” the older man commented without looking up from his papers.
“No,” Dean laughed, “It’s just been a while since I’ve done...well
“Who’s driving?” Cas asked. He had his car privileges mostly taken away after the incident, with the exception of running errands.
“Uh-huh,” Coach hummed absent-mindedly, “Alright, bring it in!”
Dean: How?
His eyes wandered the rest of the room before coming to rest on the sight he was avoiding.  Dean’s limp body lay on the hospital bed, the only indicators of life being the steady rising and falling of his chest and beeping of the heart monitor. His body was littered with cuts and bruises, and his arm was wrapped in a cast. Cas felt his stomach lurch at the sight. Tears started to well up in his eyes. He blinked them back and walked to stand to the left of the bed.
Anna sighed in defeat, ultimately Gabe’s car was safer and less...noticeable.
Cas shifted once again, this time sitting up on his elbow so he could take a swig of his drink. He chuckled to himself as a dumb thought popped into his head.
“I used to come here with my family when we were younger. Ellen, the owner, is a family friend,” Dean said, smiling as he remembered.
Just before he was about to snatch up his phone to leave the bathroom it pinged with a text. He grabbed for it too quickly and fumbled. It’d nearly fallen to the ground but he’d caught it between his fingers and stomach last second. He let out a sigh of relief, sending a silent thanks to whoever was listening before flipping the phone over so the screen lit up.
Eleven hours later after a lot of internal debate, Castiel was ringing Dean’s doorbell. The door swung open almost immediately. Dean was standing on the other side, his face lit up in a laugh. “Cas,” he said, a hint of shock in his voice.
“Nothin’,” Cas studied him a second longer, eyes lingering on his lips before looking back up at the velvety sky above him. That was a lie, more than anything, he’d wanted to sit up and press their lips together. He couldn’t. Dean was straight. Instead of doing any one of the million things he wanted to do he said, “beautiful, isn’t it?”
Cas thought for a bit, still staring at Dean’s arm. “No reason,” he said after a bit.
Balthazar hummed an okay and laid back down. Cas plugged his phone back in, lying on his own bed. He stared at the ceiling until he drifted off. Three days. Three days until he could see Dean again.
“Dean!” Castiel called out, racing over to him. He reached out his hand, touching Dean’s forehead. “It didn’t work,” he muttered. He tried again. Nothing. Dean writhed when Castiel pulled his hand away.
He hesitantly raised the cool cup to his lips, parting them gently as he tipped the cup back to allow some of the bitter liquid into his mouth. Immediately, he got the urge to spit it out. The coldness of the drink was...unanticipated, to say the least. It took a second before Dean got used to the temperature before swallowing the liquid in his mouth and going in for another sip. Coffee was coffee and he needed it today more than ever.
“It was nice to meet you too,” Cas answered, standing up and shaking her hand. She turned, practically running out of Dean’s yard. He chuckled, knowing exactly why she left so quickly. Cas tilted his head at him in a silent question.
“Oh, no,” Gabe said hastily before asking, “There’s gonna be a party this weekend at some kid’s house. Wanna go with us?”
Cas felt like his head was about to implode. Bile rose in his throat and he forced it down. His eyes were still fixated on Dean’s unmoving body.
Cas watched Dean drive away, unable to do anything but stare. He stood, watching him pass car after car, coming up at an intersection. He watched Dean not stop at the red sign. And he watched as a dark blue van came barreling from the left, hitting the side of the impala just behind where Dean sat and made it roll.
Castiel frowned at him, “Why do you say that?”
“Nope,” Dean smiled at him in thanks. Cas shook his head, indicating to the half-full bottle still in his hand.
“You don’t have to-”
Dean looked back up at the speckled sky, “Yeah,” he responded, unsure of whether he was talking about the canopy of stars above him or the boy lying next to him.
Cas thought for a second before responding.
Cas had expected that Dean would have visitors. A few of his close friends, his parents, and maybe a few other classmates.
“Jesus, Cas. What the hell? I could have killed you,” he yelled.
That caught Deans attention, “Oh?” his voice hitched a little.
“Thanks,” Dean said, brushing against Cas as he squeezed through the tight space. Cas took a sharp breath at the contact. Dean looked at him. His back was already turned.
“Black is fine,” he said. Cas handed him one of the cups. Dean accepted it gratefully. He blew on it a bit before taking a sip. He sighed and closed his eyes as warmth washed through him. He opened his eyes to find Cas staring at him. His face was flushed and his mug was halfway to his open mouth. Dean licked the coffee remnants off his lips. Cas looked down at his coffee, taking a sip. Dean looked at his own coffee, smiling.
“What did I do?” Cas asked, looking back at her confused.
This time Mr. Shurely looked up from the paper and folded his hands before answering. “I don’t recall asking. Now have a seat. I need to finish grading these.” He gestured towards Dean’s desk before going back to his writing. He made his way to the desk in front of the boy.
“My, you’re chatty today. We’ll explain in the car. Just, come on. We need to get home.” Balthazar responded, grabbing Cas’s arm and dragging him out the door to the car. He sat in the back while Gabe and Balthazar sat in the front. When Gabe started the vehicle, the clock glowed brightly, showing it was almost 3 AM.
“No,” Dean said quickly, walking back over to Cas and pulling him into a hug, “No. Never.”
“Party pooper,” Gabe said jokingly, “It would’ve been funny to see a second time though.”
“Cool,” Dean said, checking his phone for the time, “We still have a bit, don’t choke.”
“How was the date?” He asked.
“You sure?” Dean asked, eyebrows furrowed.
Cas choked on the next bite, remembering what happened the previous night. He coughed viciously for a minute in an attempt to dislodge the crumb of cereal stuck in his throat. “No, I did not hear about that,” Cas eventually choked out, which wasn’t a complete lie because he witnessed it, was even the cause of it, not just heard about it.
Cas and Dean go to a High School/College party to unknowingly distract themselves from their feelings for each other. The separation is short lived as they wind up running into one another at the party. Charlie tries to get Dean to confess his feelings for Cas by not so subtly creating a romantic situation.
“Fuck you,” Dean laughed breathily.
“Sure you can,” Charlie laughed.
“I can ask him tomorrow,” Dean shot.
“Shit,” Dean swore, grabbing an oven mitt.
“Nothing,” Cas replied, earning a confused look out of the two sitting in front of him, “Dean gave it to me.”
“Yes, yes. You’ll kill me. Run along now,” Rowena retorted.
“Sorry, teach,” Dean said, turning to the front.
“Why not?” Dean asked.
“He’s pro’ ly not even GAY,” Dean whined, “god im such a f-f-fucking idiot.”
After a few minutes of not being able to sleep again, Dean got out of bed, careful not to wake the other. He walked to the bathroom, looking for clothes. He found some pants and slipped them on. He glanced at the mirror, fixing his hair quickly, and walked out.
Dean watched him walk away, nearly falling when Charlie tugged him along. Cas led them down a hallway, up a few flights of stairs, and made too many turns to remember. Eventually, they made it to a narrow staircase at the end of a hall. The steps were steep and dusty. Dean had to walk up them sideways to fit and nearly fell a few times. Cas was the first to reach the top. Cool air rushed in making Dean shiver. A few steps and an awkward squeeze out the too-small door later, he was standing on the roof.
Cas laughed. He was so happy he couldn’t hold it back.
“Nope,” Dean grinned, “You’re actually the last one here. I’m glad you came. Come on in.” Cas obeyed, walking into a well-decorated living room. There were a handful of people strewn about the furniture. They all looked up at him when he came in. Dean closed the door and started introductions, “Cas, this is everyone. Everyone, this is Cas.”
“I’ll leave you to it then. Nice meeting you, Cas,” Sam said.
Dean: Are you okay?
“Don’t be,” Sam said, “I said we shouldn’t wait but Cas insisted.”
Chuck hummed doubtfully, looking over the paper at him, “Okay, he’s at the hospital, in a coma.”
Cas took a deep breath, trying to center himself. Some tears had fought past his defenses and were drawing wet trails down his face: I...
“What?” Cas asked.
“Where the arrow of Bra-man or something is.” Dean said, still unmoving from the position he was in.
Cas still had his head resting on his hands. Upon closer inspection, Dean realized he was asleep. Cas’s back was rising and falling steadily under the large, blue-grey sweatshirt he was wearing. Dean leaned a little over his desk while putting his bag down to look at Castiel’s face. His usually blue eyes were closed gently. His long lashes reached for the bags resting under them. Dean’s eyes wandered down towards the man's plump, chapped lips. They were slightly parted. A small trickle of drool ran out from between them, getting caught in the light stubble on his jaw before trickling onto the back of his hand. A light snore emitted from the parted lips with every breath.
“You tell me, he was fine earlier,” Castiel glared at her. He sat Dean down on one of the chairs around the desk. Dean groaned when Castiel pulled away.
Dean reached behind Cas and grabbed the note, not breaking eye contact. He slowly unfolded the note.
A few people sat around it debating about something. Cas didn’t know most of them, not personally, but there was one girl he did know.
“Fine,” Cas sighed, giving in, “You know the routine though. You’ll have to smuggle me out.”
His face flushed and he promptly sat down about a foot away from Cas. The blue eyes turned to him for a second before looking at the sky again. Dean’s legs were pulled up to his chest with his arms wrapped tightly around them. His drink was sitting next to Cas’s on the ground.
Enjoy!
Dean, confused by the sudden subject change, answered: The Doctor said I should be okay to go by Thursday. Why?
“You too,” Cas answered, shutting the door. He started the engine and put it into drive. Smiling at Dean before driving off.
Dean found himself unable to sleep. He pulled out his phone to check what he had missed. It was a bit cracked but luckily the damage was pretty small. He’d found it sitting on his bedside table.
“I’m sorry if I… made you uncomfortable.”  He begins to pull away - so this is what mortified feels like.  He’s not expecting Dean to pull him back down.  He’s really not expecting Dean to come close and capture his lips in a chaste kiss, but he sure as hell kisses back.
Dean stares at the glass in his hand.  He could go back to bed, but it’s not like he’ll get any more sleep tonight anyway.  Not with Hell lurking in his brain, just waiting for an opening.  So he abandons his water and makes for the living room with two beers.  The couch bounces a little as he takes a seat beside Cas.  “What are we watching?”
They have a little get-together in the bunker, after it’s over. Part victory celebration, part memorial. Just a few people - Eileen, Jody, Donna, Bobby, Charlie. They tried to get Jack, but either he’s too busy being "hands-off" or doesn’t hear their prayers. And is that even how to contact him now? They don’t really know how this works, they’re kind of outside the regular playbook now.
Cas hummed and sat up. His head felt clouded and tired but in the best way. Dean held out a pair of boxer shorts, a towel, and a pair of sweatpants. Cas tilted his head at him in a silent question. “I keep a lot of spares. The boxers are new I swear. The sweatpants aren’t but they looked like they’d fit you. The bathroom is over there if you want it,” Dean answered.
“Sit,” he said, gesturing at the empty seat next to him. Cas obeyed, preparing for the worst. Chuck sat for a bit, contemplating his next words, “So.”
Cas’s face flushed, “No. Nope. No,” he said. Dean laughed as Cas somehow blushed harder.
“Wh-” Dean groaned, shifting in the chair, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“I’m just stressed,” Cas said, looking at their hands.
“Yes, I do Dean. You know it too, I know you do,” Sam murmured. Silence filled the air. Neither knew what to say next. Dean yawned and rubbed his eyes. It had been weeks since he’d gotten any real sleep. Not that Sam looked any better. “You were screaming,” he broke the silence.
“Yes,” Dean confirmed in between breaths “Probably gonna need an Advil though.” They stood for a second longer before Dean leaned into another kiss. “Alright, I’d better go change.”
“Oh,” Cas said, the small smile returning to his face.
“Oh, hey Dean! How’d it-” Charlie started, stopping when she noticed his expression, “What’s wrong?”
Guilt welled up further in Cas, breaking free in an exhausted sob. He pressed his head to his knees, hiding in his arms. His phone dangled from his hand. Emotions overwhelmed him, paralyzing him in the moment. A few minutes went by before the tears stopped and he was able to breathe again. He stayed with his arms and knees tucked safely around his head for a few more seconds, regaining his grip on reality. He lifted his head, unlocked his phone again, and typed the only thing he could think of: When are you coming back to school?
“Hot dogs it is,” Dean smiled. He stood up and turned towards the kitchen, wiping his face off while his back was turned. He opened the mostly empty fridge and grabbed the packet of hot dogs. He put two in the microwave and stood, staring at them as they cooked. His eyes still stung and his body felt heavy.
the bitter substance inside.
“Hi, I’m Dean,” he said, reaching out his hand for a handshake.
“Another one?” Sam asked, concern dripping from his voice and face.
Dean’s room was practically filled to the brim with flowers, balloons, candy, and cards. It reminded him of that scene in Harry Potter after he had confronted Professor Quill and wound up in the infirmary. Cas chuckled to himself at the thought.
“Yeah,” Cas smiled.
Cas felt nervous but confident this morning. It was a big day. He wasn’t sure when Dean would show up but he shoved down the nerves as he sat down at his desk. He made a well-planned decision to stay awake that morning in case Dean arrived early again. Popping an earbud into his ear, he closed his eyes and let his mind wander to the different ways the green-eyed boy might react to his coffee offering.
“That does sound like you,” Chuck laughed, “Go ahead, have fun. As much fun as you can sitting on cold, metal bleachers that is. I’ll meet you at the car at 5:30; if it’s not over before then,” he said, glancing at the clock at the front of the classroom.
They looked at each other for a second before Gabe spoke, “Well,” he paused, deciding what to say next, “He is alive.”
Charlie: You know it ;)
Sam shut the lights off again when he left and leaving Dean to his thoughts.
“Yeah,” Dean chuckled. They stood, staring at each other for a few seconds before the doors started to close. Dean flung his arm out, stopping them. He looked at Cas, wide-eyed, before breaking out laughing. Cas snorted, following as Dean walked out of the elevator and down the hall to the left.
“Oh, uh,” suddenly he couldn’t think. Cas sighed, starting toward the door. “Wait,”  Dean stuck his arm out, stopping him. Cas looked at him, confused and annoyed. Dean stared at the floor, finding his words, “I’m sorry.”
“What is it this time?” Cas said, voice muffled by the pillow.
Cas: I’m sorry.
“Would you like to go visit him?” his father asked.
“It was still a cool thing to do. You didn’t need to pay me back.” Dean promised.
His Dad was going out on another business trip today and wouldn’t be back until Tuesday at least. He had left earlier than Dean was expecting, probably sometime around 4 AM. Dean woke up late and barely had time to throw on some presumably clean clothes before waking his brother and dragging them both to school. Normally he wouldn’t be very concerned with being a few minutes late to class. There was only one reason that caused him to be in the rushed state he was in now.
Once he was sure he was out of earshot of the classroom, he did a little victory jump.
“Yes, but first,” Dean pulled him back down to meet their lips once again. He pulled back just enough to whisper, “I love you too, my little angel”
“So how do you guys think you did on Mr. Singer’s quiz?” Cas changed the subject to pull the two away from their glaring contest.
“I know exactly what to get you boys, and don’t you worry about paying, it’s on the house. Now take a seat, I’ll have it out for you in a few minutes,” she ordered. Dean led them to a booth in the corner of the diner. He sat down, Cas scooching in on the other side.
He tensed, his hips faltering as a wave of pleasure crashed through him. He fell onto the bed next to Dean, panting. The smell of sweat hung in the air. Dean let out a burst of laughter beside him. Cas looked over at him, confused. “What? Did I do something wrong?” he asked.
Cas chuckled, slowing down his fry eating.
Dean: Yeah, you?
Cas moved his hand around Dean’s arm and trailed it around his torso to lock with the other one, pulling Dean into a hug. Dean sank down to the ground on his knees. They slumped into each other. Dean breathed in Castiel’s smell.
The nerves were overwhelming as he waited for a reply. Minutes of anxiously tapping his foot on the ground passed before he finally gave up and turned towards the mirror. He almost laughed at the messy hair and large purple bags under his eyes. He was only wearing boxers and a loose t-shirt which he pulled down from where it was bunched under part of the boxer’s waistband. He tousled his hair, and reached for the toothbrush by the sink, finishing what he could of getting ready without his clothes.
Cas nestled into his shoulder. Between Dean’s heartbeat in his ear, the monotone sound of the TV, and the steady rise and fall of Dean’s chest as he breathed, Cas was out within minutes.
Barely an hour until the wedding.
“I should’ve fought harder.” Castiel insisted, “Joseph, what you went through, because of me, it-”
He pushed those thoughts aside. “Dean,” Cas continued, “Dean says ‘I need you’. He says ‘We’re family’. He says ‘I’d rather have you’ and ‘Don't ever change’ and ‘I’d die for you’. But Dean. Doesn’t. Say. I love you.”
“Alright,” he called out to the sweaty kids after checking his watch, “You have maybe ten minutes before the bell, hit the showers!”
November, 2012
Castiel’s blood ran cold. “Stop!” He gave Dean one last shove, scrambling away. “What the hell, Cas?” Dean protested. Cas was looking around wildly, finally finding the pistol Dean had given him the day he left, tucked under his pillow. “Who are you?” He demanded, aiming it at him. “Where is Dean?”
“Dean, where are you even going? You haven’t said a word to me since-”
“Castiel?” Joseph stood on shaking legs. The brothers turned to Cas, who was standing behind them, looking as if he’d seen a ghost. “It is you, isn’t it?” Joseph took a step closer, moving past Sam and Dean as if he couldn’t even see them. “I’d never forget those eyes.”
Dean smiled, looking out past the kids to where his baby was parked next to Castiel Novak’s monstrosity. Cas had almost punched him at the last faculty Christmas party for calling that thing a pimp-mobile. Since then, a few of the other teachers had been secretly placing bets on when the two would get together.
“Jack!” Dean called out, standing and walking into the living room, “Get your feathery ass out hear!” Dean glanced at where Castiel had been, only to find that he had also vanished. “Jack!”
Claire waited until she heard her father’s door shut, and then opened her text chain with Jack.
“You’ll be close by?” Dean picked up his knife, tucking it into his coat jacket. “Right outside,” Sam confirmed, “I promise.” Dean nodded, casting one final look at their scattered papers. “Right, then.” He was about to turn, when the familiar fluttering of wings made him freeze. “Hello De-”
“Payback’s a bitch.” Dean hadn't stopped laughing since the email had arrived. Sam scoffed, finishing tying his tie before turning to Dean. “They’re friends from college.” He reminded his brother, “They think I left Stanford for Harvard Law, not... y’know.” He gestured vaguely, “All this.” Dean swung his feet off the bed, rolling his eyes. “Hey, weddings can be nice.” He tried, seeing how uncomfortable Sam was at the idea of lying to his old friends all night. “You got a date?”
“You never woke me up.” Charlie said first thing in the morning. Sam hadn’t moved from his spot by Dean’s bed, where he was reading Slaughterhouse Five, occasionally reciting a few lines out loud in the hopes that Dean would tell him to stop touching his stuff the way he always did. He looked up at her, and he was sure he looked terrible. “Sorry.” He muttered, “Guess I lost track of time.”
"Oh, my mistake." Cas scoffed, "You've locked yourself in a bathroom barely an hour before our wedding, but of course. You're fine." He rolled his eyes. "I'm not an idiot."
Wait.
"That dad." Claire confirmed. "And my dad, Castiel Novak, agreed."
“Human.” Joseph whispered. “But humans are not capable of horrors like these.” Castiel felt a wave of sympathy at the faraway look in Joseph’s misty eyes, no doubt remembering his younger sister, and his father, and everyone else he’d known and loved and lost. Not for the first time, he found himself wishing he could simply fly them to a secluded corner of Heaven, where no one could touch them. But he supposed a two bedroom apartment tucked away in east Berlin would have to do. “Everything happens for a reason.” Castiel said, though with each passing day Joseph seemed to lose more of his faith in the angel’s promise. “I don’t suppose today is the day you can actually, y’know, tell me the reason?” Joseph tried, but Castiel just smiled sadly. “Figured.” Joseph sighed, “Though, there is one good thing to come from this nightmare.” Castiel tilted his head in confusion, and Joseph laughed, reaching out to punch him in the shoulder. “You, Castiel.” He took a step closer, expression growing serious. “Whatever happens, whatever is going on out there,” his dark brown eyes searched Victor’s blue ones, looking straight through them into the very core of the angel’s grace, “whatever else, know I am so very glad that I met you, Castiel.”
“I haven’t gone to see him yet.” Cas filled in the blanks on his own. “I thought it was best to let him get settled. Bobby told him I’m okay, though, and I’m sure Jack will be over to give him a full tour soon enough.” Sam rolled his eyes. “Cas, I think the last thing Dean wants right now is to spend more time away from you.” Cas looked away, embarrassed. “Look, after you died, Lucifer called Dean from your phone.” Cas’ eyes widened. “He sounded just like you, and he said he was hurt. Cas, I’ve never seen Dean move like that. And when he opened the door? He was so devastated. I don’t know what went on between you two, but... I know he needs to see you. Probably more than I do.” Cas opened his mouth to protest, but Sam cut him off. “Look, I understand.” And he truly did. “At the end of the day, you were the best friend I ever had. But Dean... he was always something else, wasn’t he? Something... more profound.” They both chuckled. “I’ll be okay. I promise. You should be with him.” Cas hesitated. “But... Maybe Jack could visit once in a while? Just so I don’t go completely insane on my own.” Cas’ eyes softened. “Of course, Sam.” He promised. “But you won’t be alone. When we set the world right, Jack gave everyone a choice.” Sam leaned forward, intrigued. “With the other worlds gone, the refugees were... changed. They’d been merged with their original versions, and Jack asked them if they wanted to stay in heaven, or continue their new lives on Earth. Some, like Bobby, opted to stay in heaven, but some of the younger ones...” Cas smiled as Sam’s phone pinged. The screen lit up with a text.
‘Changed his outfit three times, and I think I can hear him giving himself a pep talk in the bathroom’
They drove in silence for a few more minutes. “We could talk about this.” Cas suggested quietly. Dean glanced over at him, brows furrowed in confusion. “This.” Cas pointed between them, “Us.” Dean sighed, fixing his eyes on the road. “What’s there to talk about, Cas?” He asked, “You want to talk about how I told you I love you, and you hid from me for a year?” He held the steering wheel tighter, gaining speed. “You want to talk about how I cried every night over there, begging you to come back to me, and you ignored me? Or maybe you want to-“
Claire rolled her eyes, smiling fondly. Her dad loved to talk about the story of her birth, and especially loved to jokingly remind her that she cost him around 100,000 dollars just to make her exist. “Blue.” She repeated, finding it on the bed and handing it to him. Castiel nodded, wordlessly accepting it and pulling his shirt off. “The brown shoes and belt.” She added, pulling out her phone. She scrolled through her chats until she found Jack Kline’s- Or was it Kline-Winchester? She never bothered to ask- number in their grade group chat.
"This isn't a memory." Dean realised. Cas took his hand, leading him to sit down.
“Dean,” Cas took a step closer, “Tell me what really happened.”
“It was the heat, of the moment!” They both sang loudly as they sped on.
“And even after.” Cas promised without hesitation. He smiled when Dean chuckled weakly through the door. “And even after.” He repeated. “No more leaving.” Cas sat up sharply. “Is that what this is about? You think I’m going to leave you?” Not for the first time, Cas wished he had even an ounce of his grace left, so he could get to Dean, and then take them both somewhere very far away. Dean mumbled something he couldn’t quite make out. “What was that?”
Dean turned to see him standing, blue eyes full of hurt. “Jack.” Dean sighed, “Wanna give us a minute?” Jack nodded silently, giving Dean’s arm a gentle squeeze before he disappeared. “We could have a forever together.” Dean turned back around, gazing out a window to the beautiful front lawn. “Wasn’t that always the plan, on some level? You and me, enjoying the peace?” He felt the couch dip as Cas took the seat where Jack had been, though where Jack had curled into him for comfort, Cas sat stiffly, staring straight ahead. The only indicator that he even knew Dean was there was his hand that slid over, to Dean’s, gripping it tightly. “If that is what you want.” Cas said slowly, unblinking, “Then of course we can. I’d follow you anywhere, I think I’ve proven that.” Dean bumped their shoulders together in an attempt to get the angel to loosen up. “Don’t we deserve it?” He asked quietly, “After everything we’ve been through, the soft epilogue, the happily ever after, don't we deserve better?” He saw Cas’ eyes soften. “It wasn’t meant to be like this.” He whispered, “You were going to-” he cut himself off, looking down guiltily as Dean leaned in closer. “I was going to...” he gestured for Cas to continue, but he shook his head. “I can’t.” Dean nodded in understanding, squeezing his hand. “Cas,” He lifted his free hand, turning the angel’s chin so they were facing each other, “Forever won’t be worth it if you’re like this the whole-”
“I’ll come back to you.” Castiel promised.
Sam ran down the stairs, two at a time, and pulled Cas in for a bear hug. He felt the tears he’d been holding back for hours begin to spill out of him, and he choked out a sob. “I know.” Castiel whispered, running a comforting hand up and down his back. “Let it out.”
Claire slid into a seat in the cafeteria, dropping her tray unceremoniously. "Did you hear the news?" She smirked at Jack Kline, who was staring at her. "Hello? Anyone home?" She shrugged, taking a bite of her sandwich. "Your dad asked mine out on a date."
“You didn’t hear that?” Sam looked at them, “Dean was calling me, I thought you were hurt.” Dean yawned, leaning on Cas for support. “Sammy, I was asleep.” He mumbled, eyes not quite open. “You still are.” Cas laughed, gently nudging Dean off his shoulder. “Can we please just make a rule that pranks end from 10 P.M to 7 A.M? Please?” Cas shrugged. “Sure,” He agreed, “and maybe we don’t use anything that constricts our breathing anymore, Sam?” Sam cocked his head, confused. “Are you trying to say this wasn’t you?”
The class groaned. “What,” Castiel asked innocently, “None of you want to spend your first weekend back writing about the Industrial Revolution?” 23 kids gave him matching looks of annoyance. “Well, what are your plans for the weekend, Mr. Novak?” Anna, one of his best students, was smiling sweetly. The class was looking at him expectantly. He knew how much they liked to hear about his personal life, seeing as he barely had one.
“Never thought it would take our dads dating for us to hang out.” Claire mused, taking a bite of her second slice, “We could’ve been awful at writing essays together for years.” Jack rolled his eyes, smiling. “Do you really think they’ll start dating? Like, actually dating?” He tried to hide his excitement. His dad tried so hard to never let Jack worry about him, but they’d lived together for fifteen years. He knew his dad was lonely, he could see the faraway look Dean would get whenever they watched cute couples on T.V. “I think so,” Claire said with a shrug, “they’re on a date now, aren’t they?” Jack thought about it. “What if they really don’t know it’s a date?” He asked, “Oh, come on.” Claire gave him a light shove, “They aren’t stupid.”
Cas was shaking. Dean cursed, sitting on the bed and pulling Cas halfway into his lap. “I’m sorry.” He repeated quietly, gently rocking them back and forth until Cas stilled. “Cas, I’m sorry.”
“We get you for a whole week this time.” Sam repeated, coming closer to give Jack a hug as well, “That’s nice.”
Dean felt a shift in the air, and practically jumped backwards when he saw the way Cas was looking at him. The angel’s eyes were wide with horror. “Dean,” he whispered, eyes unfocused and glassy, “Dean, please wake up.” Dean looked around, confused. “Cas, I am awake.” He stood, beginning to back away slowly. Cas’ eyes remained fixed on the spot he had been occupying, unblinking. “Please, Dean.” And wow, it was weird to hear his voice so full of emotion while his face stayed completely still. “Not yet. Not like this.” Dean heard a noise behind him, and whirled around to see- Sam, but... not his Sam. This Sam was somewhere around 8 years old, and he was looking up at him with that damn puppy face. “Why’d you do it, Dean?” But before Dean could answer, Sammy disappeared in a cloud of gold smoke.
And yet-
“Take me home.” Cas whispered, face buried in Dean’s chest. “Please, Dean, don’t leave me here.”
And then Cas hesitated. "Is it… Is it me?" He asked quietly. "God, Bee- Cas, no!" Cas’ shoulders sagged in relief. "If there's one thing in this world I'm sure of, it's you." Cas waited patiently, and was rewarded when he heard Dean sigh. “It’s just, if we do this… it’ll be forever. ‘Till death do us part and all that.”
“Let’s talk World War One.”
“Who’re you texting?” Dean paused in the doorway. Jack smirked up at him. “Everyone. I’m planning a party the second you get going already.”
“We have a broken tape deck, we drove this whole way without music, and you did not complain once.”
“Do you remember when we used to dance?” He could practically feel Cas’ glee, and he pretended not to notice as Cas slipped his hand over to grab Dean’s phone,  and began filming. “And incidents arose from circumstance.” He smiled, lightly squeezing Cas’ thigh. “One thing led to another, we were young.” He laughed at the face Cas pulled at that. “And we would scream together songs unsung.” Cas put the phone down, and Dean made a mental note to threaten Sam’s life if he ever shared that video, since he was pretty positive Cas had just sent it to him. Possibly Charlie, too.
Dean took a few moments to gather himself, before turning back, looking Castiel straight in the eye. “I didn’t know you could feel the way I do.” He admitted. “She- when Hester told me, she said my touch corrupted you. I thought, God, I don’t even know what I thought. Uriel told me you like me. Meg told me you like me. Hell, you even told me you loved me before. I don’t- I didn’t, didn’t know that you could feel love like that. Or if you did, that it couldn’t be the same kind I felt for you.” There were tears in his eyes, but he continued. “I’ve never been good with feelings. You know that. But I- Cas, I need you. You’re family. Cas...” he struggled with what to say next.
“Nothing.”
Whatever.
Jack glanced over to where his dad was debating between combat boots and dress shoes. “Put the boots back, dad!” He scoffed, turning back to his phone.
It was such a beautiful day outside. The roads were all but empty, and they had maybe four hours left of their drive to a town in Nebraska for a possible Wendigo.
"Do they... know, that it's a date?" Jack felt stupid even asking, but then he thought about his dad, and figured it was a safe question. "Listen," she lowered her voice, "I think this could be really good for both of them."
One where only women could get through the door.
Number Two: Sam
"The official Winchester Uniform." He announced proudly. "It's very comfortable. I understand why you've worn this every day for the past 40 years." Dean gave him a light shove, and they both just stared at each other, laughing lightly.
Barely an hour until the wedding.
Castiel tried to keep his expression neutral. Of course Dean was just playing a part. “Right.” He said flatly, “Of course.”
“Mhmm.” Castiel hummed noncommittaly. One of them had forgotten his name and accidentally called him ‘Professor Green Eyes’. He then had to break it to the the girl that he was not a professor, and his eyes were blue.
A million memories flashed before Dean’s eyes. Castiel did say I love you. But he also said ‘You’re our best hope.”  ‘We’re making it up as we go.’ and ‘I always come when you call.’ and
Cas’ mouth snapped shut, and he shook his head slightly, blinking rapidly. “Dean.” He repeated, “You, uh.” He looked the hunter up and down nervously, “You look...”
—————
“Sonofa-!” The three ducked quickly as sparks and glass rained down. Dean looked around, confused. “I thought we checked the lights when we moved in.” Sam shot Cas a look, and at least the angel had the decency to look apologetic. “I guess we missed that one.” Sam shrugged, and Cas sent him a grateful smile.
“Yeah, no.” Dean clapped Cas on the shoulder, “It’s still ass o’ clock, and you get grumpy when you don’t sleep. He’s here for a week, you can talk more in the morning.”
