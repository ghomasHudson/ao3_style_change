The date started off right, both sharing anecdotes, childhood memories... When both were done with their dinner, John payed for it and accompanied her home, since she didn't live far from the restaurant. The night was beautiful; the sky full of stars, it was quiet, the moon was shining...
The doctor looked at his now boyfriend and tried his best not to laugh; he was so smart yet there were many simple things that he did not know. Finally, after a while of laughing at Sherlock, John took pity on him after his fifth threat of throwing the bloody machine out the window
The doctor still couldn't believe what he was hearing, he was speechless. He kept on looking to Mycroft, who certainly was worried about his little brother. The man continued talking
"Are you... embarrassed of me?" he asked, almost whispering and looking at his feet, because he felt very vulnerable and he didn't want his boyfriend to notice it
The detective's lips slightly curved upwards and his eyes glittered with so many emotions; after all he had to go through while dismantling Moriarty's network, Sherlock Holmes was going back home.
John got close to the corpse and started examining to see if there were any indicators of the cause of the boy's death but he couldn't find anything relevant. When the doctor was done, it was the detective's turn to examine the body. Once he finished, without saying a word, he headed to the dressing rooms.
Sherlock's eyes opened wildly. Did he hear that right? Did John Watson just admit that he was in love with him? His cheeks were now burning red and he felt the butterflies in his stomach wanting to get out of their cage.
Recently, he had lost interest and enthusiasm towards the activities he used to enjoy the most: solving crimes, doing experiments...
The army doctor hailed a cab and on his way to 221B he thought about what Donovan just told him: that Sherlock was a psychopath. Sure he's different, but a psychopath?' thought John to himself.
John stood there for a while before he started talking, looking at the name written on the black, cold stone. 'Sherlock Holmes' it said. John still couldn't believe that his best friend was dead and as annoying as Sherlock could be, John missed him and his madness so much. He missed their little adventures... everything.
Quite a while after John had gotten back to his new flat, found Sherlock with the woman's suitcase that he had found in a rubbish container, both men met with the murderer (through the victim's phone found in the suitcase) and went to have dinner at a restaurant called "Angelo's", so that they could see the murderer when he arrived.
"What the-? Sherlock?". His mouth hung open. The detective nodded and took a few steps closer to where the doctor was standing, with a shy smile on his face and said
What John didn't get, though, was why was Sherlock playing such sad songs; he seems fine... right? 'It's Sherlock anyway' started to think to himself the doctor 'He keeps his emotions aside. He says that they are a waste of time...'. John felt really sorry for Sherlock in that moment; Sherlock must have experienced very tough things through his life to make him build this walls that separate him from his own emotions.
John separated and went to Sherlock's neck, cautiously in order not to leave any marks on his pale soft skin. Before the doctor could go back to his mouth, the detective's lips were on his neck.
Minutes after Sherlock suddenly got up from the sofa, looked straight into his flat mates' eyes and said
Sherlock was really excited. John loved to see him that happy (even though if it was because someone had been murdered and he was chosen to solve the case); his eyes sparkled a little more than usual giving him a more... human appearance, also, he smiled genuinely. A smile that only John had the good fortune of seeing. 'He has such a beautiful smile..." the doctor thought to himself while putting on his coat.
"what?! I'm not gay! I like women! Why does everybody assume that I am gay?!" John replied loudly. Sarah, again, smiled a little and said "I know you and Sherlock are going to be very happy together..."
"Why do you care so much anyway?!" asked the slender man raising his voice too and trying to fight back his tears.
"The shoes are missing... That's odd." Said Sherlock frowning and putting his hands under his chin, just like he always did when he was thinking. Several minutes passed, until Sherlock opened wildly his eyes and stormed out of the dressing rooms running.
"Not dead. Not. Dead" John's anger was growing every time more; he was livid. The detective, however, remained silent so John kept on talking
The two men got dressed and, holding hands, they got out to the street to hail a cab. However, once they were outside, the doctor let go of Sherlock's hand.
"Well, it was about bloody time you two got together!" and just when he stopped talking, Mrs. Hudson was also in the room
"What a beautiful night" said the doctor almost whispering, while looking up at the sky full of bright stars. Sherlock, who was still looking at john replied "Yes. It is indeed beautiful". But that moment got interrupted due to Sherlock's phone ringing.
"For god's sake! It got broken! Someone broke into our house and smashed it! What the hell does that to do with our son, Mr. Holmes!"
The detective rolled his eyes and sighed. He hated this kind of talk, he didn't like talking about his feelings
Now sitting on his armchair, the doctor looked up to where his flat mate was: Sherlock was laying on the couch, hands resting under his chin, his typical thinking position. He had been there like that for hours and he was a total mess: dark circles under his eyes, his usually smooth curls were all messy and disheveled, he was much thinner because he was barely eating...
The two men stayed like that, tangled in each other's arms, for a long while until John started to roll out of bed in order to go and prepare some breakfast. That, though, was interrupted by Sherlock tightening his arms around the doctor's torso
"Introducing that kind of poison into someone's medicine was done purposely, which means that it had to be someone Holden Byers knew and who had access to his things, therefore, who went swimming at a similar time Holden did. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean that the person was friends with Byers." Stated the detective, now with his hands below his chin and eyes closed, his thinking position.'Well, this is going to take a while, so I better get myself comfortable' thought John. This way, he sat on his armchair and started writing the case on his blog. Not much later, Sherlock opened his eyes and said "Marty Reed"
"I'm going for a walk. I'll be back in a while". The detective didn't respond. John just sighed sadly and when he got out of the flat, a black car, sent by Mycroft, was waiting for him.
John, who still believed that there was something bothering or concerning the detective, decided to ask Sherlock what was wrong with him but the detective only looked at him and said
“Moriarty slipped up, he made a mistake. Because the one person he thought didn’t matter at all to me was the one person who mattered most. You made it all possible, and for that, I thank you. Good night, Molly” said the detective on his way to the door, leaving a very confused and blushed Molly behind.
John swore that he could see sadness in the detective's eyes but he wasn't sure so he let it go. But Sherlock was hurt. Even if he said he didn't, he did have feelings and now those were hurt. With all the courage he could get, he said
The detective finally got out of bed and found Mrs. Hudson leaving a tray with a cup of tea in the kitchen.
John tossed and turned on his bed that night. After almost two years he was going to visit their old flat, where Sherlock and him used to live together. The doctor was not sure if going back there was a good idea but he really felt that it would make him feel a little closer to Sherlock again, and that was all it mattered.
John hallucinated about Sherlock being alive very frequently, and when he told someone about it, even Lestrade or Molly, they just looked at him pitifully and tried their best to comfort the doctor. John's therapist had been telling him to take some pills to stop having those hallucinations, but the doctor didn't do it.
Sherlock sighed heavily. Now John would never want to talk to him again and he may even find a new flat mate... No. He couldn't start spiraling like that.
"I know what happened to your son" said all of the sudden the detective, making everyone's jaw to almost drop to the floor
Not much after, he arrived at Mycroft's office. It wasn't very big nor very decorated. It had one chair below a big window with amazing views. There were also some wooden book shelves, one tiny shelf in front of the window and another one, much bigger, full of books, at the end of the room and in front of it, there was a very organized desk; there was a small lamp on it, two phones and a pile of papers.
They remained like that for several minutes until Mrs. Hudson came in with a tray full of cookies, but just as she entered the room and saw the empty ring box on one of the armchairs, she left the tray aside and headed to where the two men were standing
Not much after, the doctor woke up, also smiling while remembering the events of the previous night.
Mrs. Hudson looked at him with a strange look on her face, smirking a little, as if she was insinuating something.
That same afternoon, the two men were sitting on their respective armchairs. Sherlock still looked as if there was something in his mind that made him nervous, but John couldn't tell what.
Sherlock, on the other hand, noticed that every time someone assumed that John and him were dating, the army doctor would deny that at the moment, as if he was embarrassed. 'Is John really embarrassed at the thought of being with me?' Sherlock asked to himself. Usually, he didn't really care about what people thought about him, however, he didn't know quite well why but Sherlock cared about what John thought.
"One word, Sherlock!" started saying John a little louder than he intended to "One word is all I would've needed to let me know that you are alive!" said the doctor, almost yelling. After a few seconds of silence, John managed to calm himself down and said
The doctor was now staring at Sherlock again. Not staring, observing... He could see that the light hit the detective's face just on the right angle to make him look more relaxed than a few minutes ago. John's eyes moved to Sherlock's lips. The corners were usually straight or turned slightly down, but at that moment, they were a little turned up. His eyes glittered with so many emotions, yet he was so still, distant, as if he couldn't react to what had happened.
"Well, you know, it was well played; poison in the medicine, the shoes were the key to solve the case... It was clever..." John did a small pause to gather the courage to ask "Did you like it?"
Next morning, John and Sherlock headed again to the hospital to ask Neil some more questions, but once they were there, they found Jane's bed empty and Neil crying helplessly next to it.
They hailed a cab and went straight to the local swimming pool where Donovan greeted them "The freak and John are going in!" she said to the other officers. John hated how Donovan treated Sherlock, who didn't seem to care at all about the woman insulting him, but every time the army doctor heard Donovan's words... he felt furious.
John noticed that there were two paintings hanging on the room's walls. The doctor looked at the time and wondered where would Mycroft be and at that exact moment, the man entered in the room.
Sherlock, after a while, headed to his room as well, where again, he felt this lump in his throat. He was devastated. He couldn't stand the thought that he was hurting and pushing John away, the only person who accepted him from the very first moment. Sherlock felt disgusted with himself and once again, he couldn't help it but start crying. He kept on crying for several hours until he managed to calm down. However, he was not able to fall asleep so he spent the entire night sitting on his armchair watching crap telly and criticizing everything about it.
"you see, the thing is I have been in love with her for 2 years now, but I have never had the courage to tell her how I felt and now..." he tried to restrain the tears, took a deep breath and kept on saying "Now, I am afraid it's going to be too late..."
"mmmh. Good morning" he said, with a hoarse voice, still a little bit sleepy even though he had woken up earlier.
"I'm so sorry, John" he said with his voice breaking. He really was sorry and even though he hoped not, deep down he had known all the time that this was exactly how John would react. And Sherlock couldn't blame him.
"Fine?! How can you say that you are fine when you have been moping around for weeks?!" said the doctor raising his voice in anger "I know you, and I know that you are not fine! So why don't you tell me what the hell is going on?!"
"As you said, Holden loved these. He scrubbed them clean, whitened them where the color started to disappear and changed the laces three... no, four times. Even so, there are traces of flaky skin where his fingers have come in contact with them, so he suffered from eczema. The trainers are well worn but much more so on the inner side. Which means that Holden had weak arches."
After a while listening to Sherlock playing his violin, thinking about how there was no way that his friend could reciprocate his feelings, John couldn't help it but to burst into tears. He cried his heart out until he fell asleep.
When John arrived at the restaurant where Sarah and him were going to have dinner, that the woman was already there. The doctor apologized for being late, but she didn't mind at all.
That way, after a few minutes at the crime scene, the two men headed to the hospital to ask some questions to one of Jane's best friends: Neil Lee.
"Where else was I supposed to put it?" replied the slender man. John was livid, he didn't even have words for this.
Both men kept on walking until they arrived to the University's laboratory, they entered in and John looked at his surroundings "Wow. Not very different from my day!". Looking around him, he saw a man sitting in front of a microscope, examining something. The man asked Mike for his phone but John's friend claimed that it didn't have battery so John offered the still unknown to him man his phone, "Thank you" said the man. Mike then intervened introducing John "This is an old friend of mine: John Watson" and out of the blue, without looking up from the borrowed phone he was using, the man said "Afghanistan or Iraq?" shocked and confused Watson asked "I'm sorry, what?" The man sighed and told him "You heard me well: which one was it, Afghanistan or Iraq?" .  The man had now stood up and was looking straight into John's eyes, waiting for an answer. John looked at him, he had dark curly hair, very prominent cheekbones and the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen: they were a mix of green, blue and grey. "Afghanistan" replied John nervously. 'How could he possibly know about that?' thought John, when again, all of the sudden the man asked "How do you feel about violin?" John, frowned, and confused asked "sorry, what?" "The violin,  I play it sometimes, it helps me to think and also, I can spend several days without talking. Would that bother you? I just thought that flatmates should know eachother's flaws" the man answered.
The consulting detective opened his eyes wildly and started scanning the room. Neither of them realized how tense Sherlock was until he relaxed his muscles. John just stared at him with a mixture of sadness and concern in his eyes. A little smile appeared on the detective's face; his flat mate was not mad at him because of the drugs, he still cared about him. They stayed in that position for a while; John's hands cupping the detective's face and both looking deep in each other's eyes.
"Marty Reed, he killed Holden Byers." Said Sherlock as if it was the most obvious thing. John opened his mouth to ask a question but before he could say anything the detective started talking
"Sherlock, here" said the doctor chuckling a little while helping the detective through the simple technological process. Sherlock could be such a child sometimes.
Guys I really want to thank you for all the support I am receiving! I am so glad to see that you  are enjoying the fanfic!
"What? No! Of course not" replied John looking tenderly at the detective, not quite understanding what was he talking about. However, the detective frowned and fighting back his tears he said a little louder that he intended to
Sherlock just inhaled deeply and started throwing all of his papers away, looking for cigarettes. The doctor couldn't help it but smile a little, he was a crazy man sometimes but after all, it was the crazy man he had feelings for.
"Sherlock! You have been disappeared for weeks! What on Earth has gotten into you?! You could at least reply to my messages!" and just when he finished his sentence he saw the two men sitting on the couch holding hands, smiled like a proud dad and said, lowering his voice this time
The doctor tried to avoid eye contact, since he felt a little embarrassed by asking that and also, because he was afraid of Sherlock rejecting him. However, the detective, with a little smile on his face, said
Once he took it off, the doctor smiled at the sight of the detective; he really was handsome. Their lips found each other again and, not much after, both men were on the bed, kissing passionately and exploring each other's bodies, trying to memorize every single detail of what had happened during the last few hours.
"That my dear Watson, is a very good question." John blushed a little when he heard 'my dear Watson' but it didn't last long because Sherlock carried on with his deductions.
Now it had been two years since Sherlock's suicide and, even though John was still hurting because of it, he was feeling a little bit better; he had managed to move on a little; he didn't get drunk that often, he didn't have so many breakdowns, he managed to sleep a little better... Also, he started eating properly again and he managed to get his job back at the hospital where he had worked before Sherlock's death. Nevertheless, as much progress as he had made, he was still in pain, he just learnt to live with it. Besides that, John was still deeply in love with Sherlock... Since he admitted his real feelings for the detective, his love for him had done nothing but growing stronger every day...
The detective prepared himself a cup of tea and sat on his black armchair. Sherlock felt really sad at the sight of John’s empty chair in front of him; and for the first time I years he felt insecure ‘what if John doesn’t want to see me?’ thought Sherlock to himself. He was afraid of how the doctor would react to his return from the dead. He had not cared at all about how others would react to it, but when it came to John… it was different; he was afraid that he could not want to see him again. ‘Sentiment’ started thinking to himself the detective ‘dammit’.
Quite a while after John had gotten back to his new flat, found Sherlock with the woman's suitcase that he had found in a rubbish container, both men met with the murderer (through the victim's phone found in the suitcase) and went to have dinner at a restaurant called "Angelo's", so that they could see the murderer when he arrived.
Sherlock breathed relieved and hugged John. After a while, he puts the ring on the doctor's finger, and both men hugged again for a longer time now. Still in each other's arms, they started to slow-dance listening to the sound of the rain outside.
Once John had his breakfast prepared, he sat on his armchair trying to read the newspaper but he couldn't focus. He was still thinking about how much he liked Sherlock and how much it hurt him that he would never be able to tell him due to his fear of rejection. Seeing Sherlock in that state, so dejected, did nothing but make John feel sadder. His heart sunk a little when he looked up at where his flat mate was standing; he looked extremely tired, probably for not having slept last night; he hadn't even changed his clothes. But what was bothering Sherlock so much? John felt helpless... He couldn't stand seeing the man he liked so much suffer that way while knowing that he couldn't do anything about it.
John stood up and started pacing around the flat; nothing had changed since he left. Mrs. Hudson hadn't dared to clean the flat nor rent it. Then, all of the sudden John heard it, he heard his voice. It couldn't be right, it couldn't be him, no.
John looked at Sherlock again and he noticed that he looked very relaxed; he looked very soft and warm. The doctor tried to stop himself but he couldn't. His fingers found their way to the detective's cheekbones, god, those cheekbones. Sherlock didn't seem bothered by Jon's touch, so the doctor continued exploring his face.
"About what", responded the detective, who was now sitting on his armchair looking directly at the doctor's eyes.
Sherlock started to walk away mad and embarrassed, leaving the doctor behind realizing how he just hurt Sherlock. He was not embarrassed of him but all that was new for him. Still, that was not an excuse and he had upset his boyfriend for no reason at all 'what the fuck is wrong with me?!' he thought to himself. He then walked as fast as he could to Sherlock, turned him around, grabbed him by his jacket and pressed his lips against his.
Slightly afterwards, he could hear Sherlock playing his violin downstairs. That piece was even more sad than the ones he had been playing until that moment and it did nothing but intensify John's crying. Again, he cried his heart out until he fell asleep.
He paused briefly, looking all the time straight into John's eyes, that now were starting to get full of tears. Sherlock continued his little speech
"Okay, then. Good night Sherlock" said the doctor trying to smile and to hide the tears in his eyes.
Once he got in there, he started to remember everything: their first case together, their afternoons drinking tea silently, Sherlock shooting the wall or playing violin...
The doctor didn't reply. He just looked at Molly about to deny what she had just said but then it hit him; she was right. He was not only sorrowful about Sherlock's death; he was heartbroken and as much as he had denied it for years, it was true: he was in love with Sherlock Holmes, he had always been, and he unconsciously knew it, but he refused to admit that it was true, why? He didn't know. John was in love with Sherlock but now it was too late because the consulting detective was dead and there was nothing John could do about it... Why couldn't he have realised his love for the detective sooner? Why didn't he say anything when he had the chance? Why? Why did he have to be so afraid to admit his true feelings?
John could swear that he glimpsed sadness in the detective's eyes for a short second, but Watson just nodded and decided to look out the window. Neither of the two men said anything during the journey until they arrived home, when the doctor, trying to break the ice, asked
Sherlock actually felt bad with himself for wanting to smoke: he felt like he was letting his best friend down, and therefore, losing the chances to date him some day. Besides that, the detective still felt the urge to smoke and decided to use his best weapon; he gave John a look with puppy eyes and, trying to calm down said
The detective hugged John back and buried his face in John's sandy hair. Sherlock had always believed that love, sentiment, was a chemical defect found in the losing side, a human error; he had always tried to divorce himself from such feelings, but now... now he was in the losing side and if that was how it felt, he didn't want to leave.
"Erm, I have no idea of how to dance..." But the detective didn't seem to care about tha fact that John didn't know how to dance, he simply said
"Really well, John, really well", said the detective with the corner of his lips slightly turned upwards. John, too, smiled with triumph.
Hours later, John decided to get dressed and go out for a walk so that he could give away a few curriculums. The army doctor struggled a little while walking since he suffered from a limp and it was necessary for him to use a cane. Once he'd submitted his curriculum to some hospitals, he felt really tired and thirsty so he went to a little stand where, while he was ordering his coffee, he bumped into an old friend of his: Mike Stamford. "John Watson!" Mike said with a huge smile on his face, "It's me, Mike, from University, remember?" Mike said, seeing how confused John looked; "Mike? Mike Stamford? Oh my god, mate! It's been almost what? 6 years? " said the army doctor while hugging his dear friend Mike.
"He has been clean for a year now, but I am afraid that, after what you told me, he might go back to his old habits".
"Walking through the dressing room I noticed that Marty had the same bag as Holden, so they went to the same Highschool - both bags had the same Highscool logo -. Marty was not a very popular boy. He was probably what people like to call "a nerd", since a poison like the one he used, wouldn't have been used by anyone... And seeing that no lockers near him were occupied confirms my thesis that Marty was not someone who people wanted to be friends with; while lockers near Holden Byers were all taken, sometimes even shared so that they didn't have to be near Reed, so he was a popular boy, people wanted to be around him... Marty wanted to feel integrated in the popular group but they kept on rejecting him. That same day, Marty attempted again to be in their group and somehow, Holden Byers mocked him, making Marty feel like he was nothing, so as a revenge, he introduced that same morning the poison in Holden's medicine meticulously calculating the time it would take for the poison to take effect so that it coincided with the moment Holden would be in the pool swimming. Then, the poison would start working and, therefore, paralyzing Holden Byers' muscles and making him drown, so it all looked like an accident."
After a while, they were told that Jane couldn't make it and they proceeded to ask a few more questions to the victim's friend, and suddenly, while Neil was talking, Sherlock opened his eyes and stormed out of the room, leaving behind a very confused John and Neil; the doctor apologized, gave his condolences to the man for his loss and went to look for his friend.
"Sherlock, are you okay? You've been acting quite strange since yesterday..." his sentence was interrupted by the detective
"I... I did it for you John... If I didn't jump, one of Moriarty's workers would have killed you..."
"Great" he said chuckling "I am definitely going mad!". He bursted into a nervous laughter, but stopped laughing when he heard it again, louder and clearer this time
"Sherlock, you know that we cannot do that yet. It could be dangerous; we have to make sure first that there are no more Moriarty's workers free..."
Both, detective and doctor, looked into each other's eyes, feeling as happy as ever. Then, after a while of staring at each other and gasping for air, they sat on the couch.
They found him looking inside a trash can. He kept on looking in it for a while until he got out exclaiming "Found them!"
"Oh shut up, John" he said leaving the room dramatically. 'He is such a drama queen' thought to himself the army doctor.
"Oh come on! I dismantled his network, Mycroft, there is no more danger! Besides" the detective stood up and started pacing around the tiny office "I need to know London again; breathe it in, every quiver of its beating heart, without hiding from anyone anymore."
Lestrade looked at John, clearly confused, and John looked back at him and just shrugged his shoulders. Both men, decided to see where the consulting detective was going.
Greg gave them the directions and left the flat. Sherlock was really happy to be able to work on cases again and John loved to see how excited the detective was.
Not much later, they were at a little book shop, where a 28-year-old woman had been seriously injured during a robbery. Everything developed as usual; Lestrade would tell them the facts about the victim; John would examine the body, the Sherlock did the same thing and finally, they went to interrogate people who were close to the victim, whose name was Jane Miller.
"Uhm, well, yeah, that's it... See you soon... mate" and with that being said, he left. 'Mate? What on Earth was I thinking?' said John to himself laughing a little bit.
"If I told what to whom?" he replied chuckling. Molly looked at him as if he should already know what was she talking about and softly said
"What are you doing here, Sherlock?" he asked, clearly pissed at the fact that his little brother teased him with the diet.
"Did you tell him, John?" the doctor frowned; he had no idea what she was talking about and he asked
John couldn't be around Sherlock without feeling a lump on his throat; all those feelings he had towards the detective were doing nothing but become stronger, and trying to repress them was not helpful at all...
The army doctor pecked around the space between Sherlock's nose and lips, making him smile a little. When he did so, John kissed the corner of his lips and then moved on to his jaw, his neck... He started to lose it and moving his hands to the slender man's neck, he kissed his lips. He felt so good, so right. The detective moved his hands to the doctor's back, pulling him closer until the only thing between them were their clothes.
A few minutes later, John came back from the kitchen and handed Sherlock one of the cups of tea he was holding. Both men sat on their respective armchairs, John reading the newspaper, and Sherlock finding it inevitable to stare at his flat mate. He has never noticed how handsome John actually was: his blonde grayish hair, his dark green eyes, as deep as the sea; his shirt wrapping his upper body... 'Good heavens. What am I even doing?' thought Sherlock to himself with a little smile on his face, not taking his eyes off John who, suddenly looked up from the newspaper and asked "What's so funny, Sherlock?" "N-Nothing. It's just that you spilled a little bit of tea on your shirt" replied the detective, whose face was now turning burning red, clearly embarrassed that John caught him staring. 'Oh shit. I'll better go get changed' said John chucking and heading to his room to grab a clean shirt.
It was winter, so the black grave was covered in white snow ohn was telling Sherlock about his day and how tedious it had been... After that, he mentioned that he felt ready to visit the apartment they used to share; 221B, Baker Street; and he was going to do that the following day.
He kept immerse in his thoughts until he heard John calling him "Sherlock?" "Sorry, what?" asked the detective "What are you going to order?" "Oh. Just some spaghetti and water for me, please" said Sherlock, a bit embarrassed for not noticing that the waiter and John were talking to him.
Days passed and the two men were not getting any new interesting cases; John was fine with it because that meant that he could totally focus on his job as a doctor, but Sherlock wasn't taking it so well... He used to smoke ass another alternative to drugs but, after a few weeks, the doctor told him to quit, since it was not good for his health. Sherlock quitted smoking and he had been doing quite good, until one morning, when John was sitting on his armchair while reading a nice book and enjoying a cup of tea, the consulting detective emerged from his room with his pyjamas on and his blue robe, all of the sudden, and started screaming
The following day, John was still very confused about what his date said the previous night; the doctor decided to put these thoughts away and go prepare himself a cup of tea.
Both men stayed like that for a while, until the doctor let go, planting a kiss on the detective's cheek and whispering
The two men woke up tangled in each other's arms and decided that, since there were no interesting cases to solve, they would spend the day at the flat.
The detective was totally focused on what he was doing. He was sure that those trainers were the key to solve the murder 'but how?'started thinking to himself 'Why would the shoes be in a trash can? Did Holden throw them away? Impossible. How can a pair of shoes be related to the boy's murder?'. The detective kept examining minutely the shoes with the microscope while John kept pacing around the room for several minutes until Sherlock finally looked up from the microscope, directly at John, and told him "Go on, then".
'Oh John, what have you done to me?' Thought to himself the detective with a big smile plastered on his face. He closed his eyes again, enjoying that moment.
Both men headed then to the kitchen to have some breakfast. John prepared some eggs and toast while Sherlock was struggling with the coffee machine.
They arrived to Scotland Yard and Sherlock explained to Lestrade everything that he'd told John moments earlier. The doctor just looked at his friend, fascinated.
Then, the taller man put his hand, softly, under John's chin and closed the gap between their mouths.
"That's all we are going to need for today." And after John had said goodbye to Neil, the two men went back to 221B, still thinking about what happened in that hospital room.
“Welcome back Sherlock” the taller man, came even closer to Molly, smiled at her tenderly and gave her a little kiss on the cheek
Once John was in his room, he laid on his bed and started crying his eyes out. It hurt him so much to see Sherlock like that, pushing everyone around him away and not being aware of it. He cried until he fell asleep.
Not much after, they were at Lestrade's office, explaining him how the crime had been committed. Turns out that Jane had been injured by one of her ex-boyfriends: Josh Thompson; as a revenge for leaving him a few months ago. He went to Jane's shop to try, again, to take her back but she, of course rejected him and this caused the man to get furious and not to be able to control his actions; this way, he attacked Jane. When he realized what he was doing, she was laying unconscious on the floor, he panicked - because he thought she was dead -, and ran away, explained the detective.
Sherlock then, noticed Mrs. Hudson, who didn't understand what was going on; thanked her for the tea, once he saw the cups next to him; and told her to leave. He then directed at John
Sherlock fell to his knees, sobbing without control. John remained silent. Sometimes silence was all they needed. The doctor approached the slender man, who was now on the floor, tears rolling down his cheeks. He was more in love with Sherlock than he remembered. The two men were now just a few inches apart from each other. Sherlock looked abnormally confused, he didn't understand what was going on, but he didn't complain. He just remained there, observing John's face and trying to memorize every single inch of it, when suddenly, the doctor leaned to kiss Sherlock. Their lips moved in unison; it was a soft and brief kiss, but long enough to say all of those things they had always wanted to say but never had, a kiss that said 'I love you'. Both men parted and remained there, just looking into each other's eyes.
"I mean" started saying the detective, smirking "you missed almost everything of importance, but you know..." John stopped smiling and cleared his throat.
"The gap. Look at the gap" he said as if everyone knew what he was talking about. Before anyone was able to say something, he proceeded
After a while, Sherlock pulled away and looked at the doctor, who started to laugh, not mockingly but with pleasure. He felt relieved now that they both had confessed their feelings. The detective was smiling as well. He had such a genuine smile plastered on his face; he never thought that he'd be loved.
After a few seconds, John pressed his lips on Sherlock's again. John pried his lips open and grazed Sherlock's lower lip with his tongue, asking for entrance, which was gladly guaranteed by the detective. They both explored the other's mouth until they broke the kiss, gasping for air.
When the food was ready, they sat and ate in silence; not an uncomfortable silence, though. Once they finished, John washed the dishes and Sherlock sat on the couch, where minutes after the doctor would sit as well.
Sherlock tilts his head to the side and presses soft lips to John’s temple, his cheek, his jaw. Then he pulls back and gives John a level look.
"Nothing. I was just telling you." Sherlock yawned and slid is hand under his cheek, closing his eyes.
There is companionable silence as John finishes making the tea and Teddy waits until he is seated opposite before asking, “Mate, are you sure you’re okay? You seem…” He trails off, waving a vague hand in John’s direction, face drawn together.
“I have my theories,” she mutters, eyes trained back on the two boys, who are now full-out chucking handfuls of water at each other.
And so the man had, lingering at the door for a moment and looking back at Sherlock sorrowfully. Sherlock had thrown a pillow at him, but all it did was bounce off the door when it was closed with a soft click.
Feeling a bit out of place and a bit like he’s intruding, John slips out of the kitchen door once more. The sound of music fills the air, along with a triumphant, “Listen to the lyrics of this song, Sherlock, really
John realises that he has lost, and is in fact smiling slightly. He forces himself to scowl and closes his laptop with a lot less force than he had opened it with. It's a complicated emotion, wanting to stay angry at someone but also actively trying to smother it. Suddenly tired, John sighs and stretches, thinking longingly of his bed. Just as he moves to stand, he hears a creak behind him and spins around, startled. His racing heart slows as he watches Sherlock pad more into the room, eyes on his bare feet and looking a bit miserable.
They never did get to investigate where Luke Ford was, because the next day Sherlock punched a customer in the face.
“And what time did you get in last night, young lady?” Mrs Holmes suddenly asks, her back still turned to the room.
"John..." Sherlock breathed, "...you look awful." With that diagnosis he let his friends face go and sat back again.
The eye darts a look up and down Sherlock’s body and flicks to John and Rachel before the door opens a tad wider, revealing a pale haggard face with deep lines around the eyes and rotting teeth bared in a nasty grin.
Sherlock locks his own fingers around the back of John’s neck, leaning his face down into the muscle of his shoulder. He breathes shallow and rapidly into the material of John’s shirt, shivering madly against him as they gyrate shamelessly into each other.
John had never seen Sherlock drunk before, had seen him feign intoxication many times for cases, but as much as John liked a drink, Sherlock hardly ever indulged with him. John supposes it isn’t really his drug of choice.
John felt like he had missed a large chunk of the conversation. His face must have shown this as Sherlock let out an all-suffering sigh and rolled onto his back, pulling his arms free from the many layers of wool and gesturing at the ceiling as he spoke. "His owner was a murderer. You know, the builder...baker...banker? I don't know, the one who killed his wife. He was sentenced to life, remember? There was no one to look after him," he glanced back at John.
John glances over his shoulder, spies Mrs Hudson ruffling curly hair with a fond look and Sherlock doesn’t even try to pat her hands away.
"Sure. If you love stabbing pig carcasses." John snaps, irritation peaking as his brain throws him a picture of what other stress relief he was imagining occurring between them moments before.
"What are you doing?" John called a bit tiredly. He really hoped Sherlock hadn't spotted a pair of curtains perfect for setting fire to or a ladle perfect for pouring acid everywhere or something along those lines. John had absolutely no desire to go bin diving that morning. Or any morning to be perfectly honest but sometimes duty calls. "Sherlock?"
They called themselves Redbeard and Bluebeard, and Sherlock didn’t even complain about the fact it was impossible to grow a blue beard. He wore the name with pride, and when Mummy bought him a captains hat, he demanded she go back to the shop to buy another one.
Suddenly the door opens and John stumbles backwards in alarm. Sherlock stands there, rumbled in his pyjamas and wide eyed.
“Hey, hey, John,” Jules suddenly stumbles closer, resting his free hand on John’s shoulder. “You should stay ‘way from Sher’ock. Ser’sly. Ser-seriously.”
John blinks at the sudden dismissal. Wants to argue that it’s not even nine o’clock, wants to demand what the problem is. But this isn’t Sherlock from home, who is used to sparring and arguing with John until one or the other awkwardly apologise or they storm away. To
“Well, I better be off,” Teddy moves to stand before pausing. He glances at Sherlock’s door then back at John. “Mate,” he smiles a bit sadly, “open your eyes.” He then gives John a pointed look and makes his way up and towards his coat which is hanging off the back of John’s chair. John watches him with glazed eyes, mind elsewhere and heart thudding.
"Why? Can't you just go and read your little list? That makes it all better usually, doesn't it?" Sherlock sneers viciously.
Mycroft steps leisurely over to him, letting the door swing shut behind him. “Hm. I hear Sherlock in particular has formed some sort of...
John nods with a strained smile. He wants to ask what happened in Sherlock’s room, but also really doesn’t want to at the same time. In the end, he doesn’t need to. Teddy gives a bright grin and lifts up his wrist to John’s face, allowing something shining to catch the light. John stares.
“Ah right,” John nods, self-preservation causing him to adopt an air of familiarity. What the hell is he doing in West Sussex? The last time he had been anywhere near Sussex had been that insane christmas with Sherlock’s parents. Where he had reconciled with Mary. It’s a painful memory and he pushes it from his mind. Another thought overtakes it. No, the last time he had been here was the night before last. And he had been down a well...
John’s heart falters and he grips the banister hard as another round of, "Harder, Jesus, go harder!" is heard through the wood.
Sherlock gives him a hooded look, flicks his eyes up and down John’s body in a considering manner. He shrugs.
John stares at his mad, insane, genius, occasionally caring friend for a moment before giving a grin and throwing the glass at the wall opposite.
“Interesting,” he looks back up at John. “It’s very very important to me that you’re not angry with me John, I think it would break my heart right now if you were.”
As Sherlock disappears, John glances around the room feeling vaguely smug, and notices Mrs Holmes’ eyes following her retreating son’s back. Mycroft, however, is staring at John with narrowed eyes. John smiles at him innocently, as Mrs Holmes follows Mycroft’s gaze before giving John a little wink. John nearly spits out his wine.
John closes the door softly, leaning his forehead against it. He takes a deep breath and turns around before jumping in alarm. Sherlock is standing right behind him, face impassive.
“And are you enjoying it there?” Mrs Holmes asks, casting a quick glance at her son, who slumps a little in his chair.
Sherlock holds the stand for a few seconds before his elbows suddenly give and he crumbles hard onto the floor with a grunt.
He remembers now. Fell out of bed. That’s embarrassing. Why is the floor so cold? Oh yeah. The window is open.
“More than you’d think,” John replies. Takes a deep breath, lets it out very slowly. “What’s this about a cup of tea?” He gives them a smile that is half pleading. They glance at each other once more, Toby shrugs at her and she sighs.
John licks his lips, glances up pointedly at Sherlock as he does so. Sherlock bites the inside of his cheek to hide a small smile, eyes downcast coyly as he sways in time to the music. Sweat beads at the base of Sherlock’s throat and John fights an overwhelming desire to lean over and lick at the salty skin.
Sherlock looks at him for a moment, looking a bit grim, before flickering his eyes around the dusty room and settling on a fixated spot. Without looking away, he raises a hand slowly and points. John doesn’t look, but Rachel does. She lets out a strangled cry and darts forward.
They were working undercover for a case, something about a drugged homicide, Sherlock forgets. Sherlock was dressed in tight jeans and a black t-shirt, John in a similar get up (
Across the room, Johns motherless daughter sleeps peacefully in her cot, unaware to the the awful turmoil keeping her father awake.
Sherlock simply pointed into the alley and John squinted into the shadowed space. There, huddled into a corner, was a small figure. John took a few steps inside the alley, noticing the tremors running through the tiny frame.
“Don’t. Just-don’t do that.” John shakes his head at him, eyes emploring and lips pinched together in a tight line. Sherlock’s eyes have widened, and when John lowers his hand his expression has transformed into such an honest look of vulnerability that John has to actively stop himself from reaching out and tugging him into a hug. A second later, the look shutters and Sherlock is a blank mask once more. He turns back to face the garden again.
John turns his panicked expression to Sherlock, who stares back at him for a long moment before they both dissolve into silent laughter.
Sherlock’s hand on his cock falters in it’s slow stroking, and he lets out a small yelp of surprise. John drags his hand roughly up once, then back down, then lower, reaching out with one finger to stroke along his perineum.
John’s right hand reaches out to grasp at Sherlock’s jaw, fingers tucking under his neck where his head is laying on the mattress. He tilts the face under his palm slightly, and Sherlock allows it before brushing his tongue against John’s bottom lip.
When she turns around again to grab some bread, he flings the cloth at Victor’s face where it lands with a wet slap.
Rachel watches him go, her face twisted unattractively. She looks back at John. “How can you possibly-”
Sometimes, Sherlock would find himself staring at John from across the room, eyes drawn to him like a beacon of light. The sun would filter through the room and bleach John’s hair, or the moonlight would transform it to a glittering brown. Sherlock would stare and stare at him, and his pulse would race in the strangest way, and when John glanced up he would look away quickly.
It frustrates John how seamlessly he slots back into the space when it’s been almost over three years he last slept here.
They jump when a soft rap of knuckles knocks against the door. They stare at each other in momentary panic, then a quiet voice calls, “Are you finished? They’ve started talking about politics and I try to lean away from that topic of conversation due to a lack of interest.”
John is starting to feel quite unsure of himself, wonders what on earth the detective is thinking. As a show of bravado, John spreads his hands up in a shrug and leans further back into the sofa, a perfect picture of ease. It lasts for about a second. As soon as John moves, Sherlock follows and crowds into him. Onto him. Knees pressing into the cushions on either side of John's hips, hands mirrored on either side of his head, gripping the back of the seat.
The manager had suspected one of his employees, as no one else had access to the freezer and CCTV, and so John and Sherlock had gone in there to find out anything they could. Lestrade had been a bit reluctant to let them, seeing as every time they went undercover something went wrong. But Sherlock had twisted his arm and the DI had allowed them three weeks top and after that they were to give up.
It’s dark and cold, occupied by a lot more people than any other room they had walked past. Most are scattered around on blankets on the floor, a few piled onto a collapsed and stained sofa in the corner. No one pays them any mind, too out of reality to comprehend what is happening around them. John sees Sherlock’s face in them all and wants to hit something. He’s never seen his friend in this state, thankfully, but that doesn’t mean he never
“Woah, woah, easy,” comes a steady voice and suddenly a hand is resting on his shoulder, pale eyes filling John’s vision.
John looks down at the hand, irritated and suddenly feeling very sober. Jules extracts his hand, noticing John’s mood.
Which is odd, in a way. John has never really been able to picture Mycroft as a young man, just assumed he came into this world looking vaguely stressed with a receding hairline. John watches as his blue eyes pan over to his brother as his mother pats him affectionately on the cheek, and John wonders at their relationship in this world.
Sherlock looks confused for a second before considering the statement. “They’re Victor’s friends,” he shrugs.
With this is mind, John simply tilts his head in affirmation and smiles back. Mycroft quirks an eyebrow then turns to leave once more.
Sherlock’s hands still and he glances up at the lighter, following John’s gaze. He sits up fluidly, “Don’t know. It isn’t mine.” Sherlock plucks it from John’s fingers and leans over to place the object in his bedside drawer, closing it again with a snap.
John frowns. Okay. What does she expect him to do about that? Not that he’s surprised it didn't work out, but that's hardly John's business anymore. He hasn't seen or spoken to the woman in weeks. “Oh. Right. I'm sorry to hear that-”
John takes a small step forward, intending to drag Sherlock away from the girl and out of the club when a thin man, taller than Sherlock with bleached white hair, saunters over and gives the dancing pair a considering look. John tenses, wondering if it’s the girl’s boyfriend, but she casts a sly smile over to the man and then he is pressing up against Sherlock’s back, running his hands down his sides and grinding his crotch into Sherlock’s arse.
Sherlock goes willingly, twirling the girl around his body while she smiles up at him in delight, hands already grasping at his waist with prying fingers.
“Do you really know where he is?” John asks quietly. The three are jammed into the back of a taxi, John sat in the middle. Rachel is staring out of the window, paying them no mind as she watches the passing scenery of London with her bottom lip between her teeth. John doesn't know why she didn't just sit opposite them, squashed as they are, and being the last one in the car. But the warm press of Sherlock's thigh against his own is enough to stop him caring too much.
One of the most surreal moments of John's life was when he and Sherlock had to go undercover in Tesco. As sales assistants. For three weeks.
He almost wishes it wasn’t a saturday, then he could use the excuse that he had work and effectively avoid the inevitable.
Sherlock sighs dramatically and gives John a look. "Haven't you ever wanted to smash up an entire house before with absolutely no consequences? And I don't know, maybe it'll make you feel better."
The shout is right by the door now, and John raises his eyebrows at Sherlock when he hears the distinct sound of a body being shoved and wrestled with.
“Shhh, everyone is asleep!” John hisses, trying to grab at him but Sherlock dances out of his grasp with a laugh.
John shakes himself and stands. “Of course. Sherlock will be pleased to see you once more before you go.”
Sherlock’s breathing hitches suddenly, his eyes squeeze shut for a moment before forcing them open again.
Sherlock thinks about Enzo, with his charming smiles, delicate touches and soft words. The infatuation that caused him such heartbreak, caused him to smother any and all romantic feelings for so many years. He wonders what he’s doing now, if he’s married and happy. If he ever thinks about Sherlock, the young teenager who had fallen in love with him and he had rightly rejected with such care and compassion. Thinks about how the man who had told him to stop punishing himself for
Redbeard and Bluebeard sprinted around the grounds of Musgrave for hours, squealing in delight and bashing their small wooden swords together with gusto. Then, when their little legs grew tired and the sky was beginning to darken, they had laid side by side in the grass pointing out funny looking clouds above them.
Eyes heavy, John closes them with a deep sigh as he dips a finger slightly inwards to press the tender flesh against a sharp tooth. Feels the tip of a soft tongue flick forward, Sherlock’s body instinctively tasting the intrusion. John retracts his finger, rubs the wet digit across the lips under his touch before sliding his hand away, lazily stroking at curls with the hand still holding Sherlock’s head to his chest.
Jed is fine. Not an overdose, as John expected, but a relapse, as Sherlock explained with knowledge only gained from experience.
“Are you cold?” John asks, already tugging at the tied knot of Sherlock’s shirt sleeves still around his waist.
"No, let me speak!" John slams the door closed behind him, shutting out the light. Its dark now, dim light from a lamp post outside is filtering through the curtains, making Sherlock's eyes glow angrily. John knows he's pushing it, and tries to create a calm air about him. He doesn't know why Sherlock makes him so angry, why he makes
Suddenly, a hand snatches the remote out of his and the sofa dips as a body settles next to him. John frowns at Sherlock, who is now flicking through the channels at lightning speed.
John blinks. They had never spoken about the list before. John always assumed Sherlock knew of it, but to have it thrown in his face suddenly takes him by surprise. Is that why Sherlock is so angry? He doesn't approve of the list?
John didn't hit him that hard, Sherlock didn't even stumble, but the intent was clear. John wanted to hurt him. And he did.
The penny drops. “You little shit!” John cries, lunging at him and knocking him flat on the bed. Sherlock lets out a surprised bark of laughter, trying half-heartedly to squirm away as John pokes sharp fingers into his ribs and waist.
The man’s smile gets impossibly wider and he shakes his head as if it’s the most awe-inspiring thing he’s ever heard. “A doctor! How wonderful, how marvellous! Your parents must be endlessly proud, I know I would be that’s for sure. I would be telling every man I passed-”
“Cheap,” John murmurs to himself in surprise, thinking it rather nice that the town had kept the phonebox in the same working condition as he can remember of them when he was younger. Rare to find one that even works at all, these days.
Birds are chirping. Why are there birds chirping? John had closed the window to try and retain as much heat in the flat considering the broken ones downstairs. They shouldn’t be that loud.
their erections line up perfectly. John grinds forwards, reaching one hand up to grip the back of Sherlock’s neck and tug him down to press their lips together again.
“You like being dramatic.” John retorted. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and before John could react, the younger man slapped the sweet box down out of John’s grip and it fell to the floor with a bang.
A little flutter of butterflies in his stomach, an almost daily occurrence, John wonders if there will ever come a day where the sight of Sherlock doesn’t result in it.
“Wanted to do this-since I met you,” Sherlock breathes quietly, letting out a small gasp when John pulls his head away and reaching down to suck harshley at the skin over his pulse point.
“What was the point of that? We are actually supposed to be here, you know!” John snapped, the cage digging into his back uncomfortably.
John’s eyes narrow dangerously and opens his mouth to give a scathing response, but Sherlock beats him to it.
John quirks a smile at the memory, looks back at Sherlock’s expectant face. The other man smiles tentatively and
“I thought I would show John around the town while Sherlock’s at the shop, if you fancy it?” Victor turns to John in question.
When Sherlock couldn’t take it anymore, the ache in his groin too much and worried the man could hear his rapidly beating heart, he would give Enzo a side-eyed glare, careful not to turn his head towards him too much, and the man would chuckle and retreat. Sherlock’s relief and disappointment following him out of the room.
As John leaves the table, he can’t help but notice the way Eurus’ eyes follow her brother’s retreating back.
John frowns in confusion, then darts his head up when a breeze of cold air ruffles his hair from the opening door.
Victor gives Sherlock a bit of a desperate look and his friend actively ignores it, heading towards the door.
John pushes up the fabric of Sherlock’s top, pawing at the soft skin of his back and he can’t believe it’s taken so long for them to do this why haven't they done this before why didn’t he
Downstairs, directly below him, his best friend is astonishingly asleep (maybe or maybe not on the floor). He knows this because he can’t hear a peep of noise under him, learned behaviour to know what to listen out for. A habit he won’t ever lose, it seems. Always listening for him, his friend, waiting to hear a body roll over in bed or the soft padding of pacing feet on carpeted floor. His best friend who has died, and resurrected. Who hurt John so many many times and who has unwaveringly, frustratingly always
“Either of you lovebirds want a drink?” Jules suddenly shouts as he appears to the left of them, hands full of bottles. The boy seems to be in a much chipper and generous mood than usual, probably because Sherlock has hardly paid Victor any attention all night.
"Let go of me!" Sherlock cries again, furious now. He yanks his wrist away and this time John let's him go. He doesn't reach for the door again, though, and he retreats back a few steps.
The ceiling has a new crack. Dust particles float around the room and settle in John’s throat as he breathes slowly in the darkness. A car headlight pans across the room, peeking through the closed curtains and disappearing as it hits the wall over the bed.
John clenches his teeth, staring up into Sherlock open, amused face. If John were anyone else, he would have heard nothing but honesty. Would have
The three boys all hold their breath, waiting for the inevitable comment about The Dog Incident. But it doesn’t come.
Teddy seems to have taken a shine to the detective, asking him about his work and sending him compliments every two minutes, varying from his intelligence to his looks. Sherlock usually ignores remarks like these from other people, but with Teddy he smiles charmingly, visibly enjoying the praise and allowing Teddy to continue.
John bats his hand away in irritation, gripping the back of Sherlock’s neck once again and tugging his head forward to rest their foreheads together in an imitation of the moment earlier.
John mimics him, Victor just behind, and takes immense pleasure on how easy it is to scale the wall with his younger legs.
Rachel looks like she’s about to start crying again for a moment before anger fills her expression. She snatches up her coat and bag and, without looking at John, storms out of the door. John slams it shut behind her.
John gives him a moment, rubbing his hands roughly over his face, then walks over to the open door. He leans against the doorframe, watching Sherlock wash his hands.
John peeks through his fingers at the clock on the wall, blinks in surprise. “We slept late, it’s almost eleven.”
John frowns, heart thudding for a different reason as he feels Sherlock’s trembling intensify as the man fights to get impossibly closer. John darts a quick hand under Sherlock’s shirt again, turning the backs of his fingers against the now-freezing skin and he stops moving abruptly.
Sherlock is still shivering, and John understands what he means when Sherlock had mumbled the word ‘vibrating’, his muscles are severely tensed under John’s hands, so much so that they’re trembling with the force of it.
John slams the laptop closed without thinking, his eyes snapping up to see Sherlock leaning against the doorway of the kitchen, face closed. His impossibly pale eyes glance at the laptop before flickering up to John’s face. He raises an eyebrow and John wills himself not to flush.
John stares at Sherlock’s lost expression and feels his heart break. He swallows down a lump, he knows Sherlock truly means it. When he doesn’t reply, Sherlock continues.
Sherlock frowns a little at that, affronted at being compared to anyone else. John quirks a teasing eyebrow at him.
Sherlock gives John an impish grin and places the mug back down, leaning on the unit and mirroring John’s stance opposite him. “Calm down John, I’m only teasing.”
“Get back, everyone get back!” John shouts, giving Victor a sharp look. The boy immediately reads his expression and begins forcing the ring of people backwards to give John more space.
There's probably heaps of grammar mistakes, so I apologise for that. Also the late update-life got in the way.
John clenches his jaw, biting back a retort as Mycroft turns away towards the door once again. John takes a deep breath, striding over to the railing to grip onto the wood with both hands, knuckles white. It’s infuriating, he knows
John’s List file is still up on the screen from where he had looked at it earlier and has a quick skim. One bullet point in particular makes him bark out an involuntary laugh before cringing in embarrassment.
“I need to talk to you about Alfie,” John murmurs before his nerve leaves him, holding onto his irritation with both hands to stop him from falling apart.
His fingers collide with metal and a soft thud penetrates the silence as it’s knocked onto the carpet.
John returns to his exploration of the skin of Sherlock’s back, grunting as the man wraps his long legs around John’s waist and pulls him closer.
John darts a sharp look at Sherlock, who to his credit gives Victor a convincingly innocent look, and notices with a pang the deep purple love bite on his neck he had only moments ago sucked into the skin.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Yes, yes your purse! You’ll have a picture of him in there won’t you? That’s what you people
John pants into Sherlock’s mouth, can’t form any other coherent words, not when Sherlock reaches down to grab his arse, pulling him in tighter.
Sherlock strokes John’s length with surprising gentleness, fingers fluttering around the head and massaging the silky skin with such delicate care that John just
“Honestly, I don’t know why you young people feel the need to get yourselves into such a state everytime you go out,” Mrs Holmes is tutting, placing a mug next to Victor’s hand.
the whole affair is, his parents humouring him slightly with obviously put-on expressions of sympathy.
“You play?” John asks moving towards it, never really having given thought to Sherlock being able to play multiple instruments having only seen him with a violin under his chin, bow in hand. Seems ridiculous never to have entertained that thought before, considering.
They stand there, panting, eyes boring fiercely into each other. John wants to grab at him, shake him, to hit him again. He wants Sherlock to hit him back. He wants….
“Oh. Right.” John frowns, feeling somewhat wrongfooted, not expecting that answer. He supposes maybe he’s been overthinking this. Always tends to do that when it comes to Sherlock.
John Watson limped into his life, smiled at Sherlock, and called him amazing and incredible and extraordinary.
“This way!” Sherlock interrupts, playing a rather twisted tour guide as he bounds up the stairs, leaping fluidly over missing boards with practiced ease. “Watch your step now.”
John exhales slowly, nodding. He knows this. “Everything is so fucked. I don’t know what to do.” John confides tiredly. Teddy is unwavering.
Sherlock seems to really consider the question now he knows John isn’t trying to start a row, and he pauses for a long moment before saying in a small voice but with utter conviction, “Because no one ever has.”
Mr Holmes asks Sherlock how working at the shop is going and the conversation turns more comfortable as Sherlock begins prattling on about how
“Then there’s Eurus, our youngest,” Mrs Holmes continues. She doesn’t say anything else and goes back to eating.
Just after two pm, there is a knock at the door. John, desperate for a distraction from the turmoil in his mind nearly runs in his haste to open it. Teddy is standing there, a big smile on his handsome face.
Even so, John is very fond of the list and sometimes looks back on it just because he can and because it makes him smile.
John snaps his eyes open and turns towards the slurring voice, groaning inwardly as Jules stumbles over to as he tries unsuccessfully to light a fag hanging from his lips.
Sherlock stopped trying to move towards John’s retreating form, blinking up at the ceiling momentarily as John gestured angrily up at the black and white cat.
They all stop breathing, dread filling their chests as they stare at each other with wide eyes. Then, the footsteps start again, this time walking quickly towards the shed and they all tense. Sherlock raises the plank of wood higher, John clenches his jaw and tenses the muscles of his thighs, Victor plants his hands on the floor ready to propel himself forward.
"Oh?" Sherlock steps forward again, now in John's space. He waits for the final blow. "Maybe you're right," Sherlock’s tone lightens. John frowns, confused. "Maybe it’s just a distraction from your lonely, loveless life. Just like your sister’s is a bottle.”
John flexes his fingers unconsciously and Sherlock twitches under his hand. John turns to watch his face again, his profile blank, jaw clenched and breathing a little shallowly.
Sherlock’s eyes finally slide open, the mismatched irises vibrating as they flick over John’s face, around the dancefloor, to the ceiling, back to John.
They allow themselves a moment to get their breaths back, Sherlock sliding to the floor, resting his back on the wall, tilting his head back and closing his eyes.
“Sherlo’k? May I come in?” The man had muttered, and Sherlock had shaken his head slowly, rolling it on the door from side to side, even though the man obviously couldn’t see him.
The piece of music Sherlock was playing at the beginning of this chapter was Melodia Africana III by Ludovico Einaudi, one of my absolute favourite composers. (Also, yes I am aware this particular piece wasn’t released until 2001 but shuffle played it by chance as I was writing that scene and I couldn’t resist)
When they arrived, Sherlock started to play violin and John watched him. He loved it when the detective played violin, he looked more relaxed, more... human. It was majestic.
The ride wasn't very long, but it felt like ages to John. He was very nervous. A man gave him directions to arrive to the place where he was meet with Sherlock's brother.
That night John was awakened by screams coming from downstairs. It was Sherlock who was screaming. John, scared that something might have happened, trotted off downstairs as fast as he could, but Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. John went into Sherlock's room and he saw him covered in cold sweat, moving furiously on his bed and muttering something that John was not able to understand.
Two years later now, and there was John, standing in front of Sherlock's grave. It's true that two years ago he said that he wouldn't come back there because it was too painful, but a couple of days after that, he couldn't help it but going again, even if it was just to sit there in silence, immerse in his thoughts.
After a short while, the waiter came back with their orders and both men started eating and John asked Sherlock to deduce some of the customers from the restaurant, which the consulting detective did. "Brilliant!" said John smiling warmly at Sherlock, who just smiled back. He didn't know very well how to react to compliments, especially when someone complimented his deductions, since that didn't happen very often.
John was a total mess; he didn't sleep good, he didn't eat properly either, he didn't talk unless it was really necessary, he got drunk almost every night, he didn't go out... also, he hadn't even tried to date anyone, since he was too afraid of getting too attached to someone and end up hurt... just as it happened with Sherlock. He just didn't feel ready to get into a relationship, he was still very sorrowful about Sherlock's death, which, of course, was totally normal. But there was something else; even after begging at Sherlock's grave for a miracle, that Sherlock stopped being dead, there was something that didn't feel right. John felt as if he forgot to tell him something but didn't know what could it possibly be, since, according to him, everything that he needed to say, had been said. Nevertheless, he still felt like something was missing. After spending some days trying to figure out what could that be, it hit him.
John, who was beginning to get a little angry and tense, asked "So, is that it?" The man simply replied "Is that what?" "Well, we don't know anything about each other, I don't even know the place we are going to be meeting nor your bloody name!" said John, a little bit louder than he intended to. The man stopped in front of the door and deduced almost everything about John's life, leaving him speechless. Once he was done, he opened the door but before he left he turned around and said "The name's Sherlock Holmes and the adress is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon!" shutting the door behind him.
While having dinner, Angelo congratulated Sherlock for having found a partner finally but John, nervous and tense, claimed, for the second time today that they were not dating but the man ignored it and brought them some candles to make it more romantic. Then, John felt intrigued and asked Sherlock about his love life "So, erm, do you, eh, have a girlfriend?" he asked "Girlfriend?" replied Sherlock "No, not really my area" he said. John frowned, confused, and then he realized what he meant "Oh, so a boyfriend then? Which is fine, by the way" Sherlock then looked at John straight in the eye, making him feel shivers down his spine "I know it's fine." said the  detective dryly. "Okay, okay... So, do you have a boyfriend then?" insisted the army doctor while licking his lips. Sherlock looked at him again and simply said "No." John then said "Okay. Unattached. Single. Like me..." and all of the sudden Sherlock seemed to realize something, looked John straight in they again and said "John... I think that you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I am flattered by your interest, I am not looking for any..." Sherlock's speech was interrupted by John almost choking on his drink and saying "No no I wasn't hitting on you, no." But then John thought to himself  'I wasn't hitting on him, right? I'm straight... I have no doubt of that... or do I?' but he left those thoughts aside and continued eating his dinner until Sherlock saw the supposed murderer and started running after him, causing John to follow him as well.
"Stay a little longer, please" said the detective, almost whispering. John finally gave up and they both stayed in bed cuddling for a little longer, listening to their heart beats; he tightened his grip around Sherlock's waist.
They arrived to the crime scene, where Sally Donvan greeted both the detective and the doctor with disgust, but neither of them gave it a lot of importance. They went upstairs to see the body of a woman. Sherlock started examining it, looking for evidence and after a while he asked for her suitcase and when Lestrade told him there was no suitcase when they found the woman and, out of the blue Sherlock screamed "Brilliant" Oh, clever!" and left the room, with a very confused John and Lestrade.
John just looked deeply into the detective's eyes. He was having trouble to breath, he couldn't think properly and swallowed whole by so many emotions John yelled
Now, the detective was hidden near his grave, in a place where he couldn't be seen but that allowed him to hear John when he talked to him. He was sitting there, listening to the doctor talk about his day, when suddenly he said that he was ready to visit 221B for the first time in almost two years... 'This is my chance' he thought to himself 'My chance to tell him that I am alive" and as soon as John left, Sherlock ran to Mycroft's office. It wasn't very decorated nor big; it was quite simple. It had one chair below a huge window with gorgeous views to the splendid garden outside. There were also a couple of wooden book shelves, one tiny shelf on the wall in front of the window and another one, much bigger, full of books, at the end of the small room and in front of it, there was Mycroft's desk, very organised; there were two small lamps on it, two phones and a rather big pile of papers.
Sherlock was bent onto his microscope with two cold tea cups next to him. Mrs. Hudson entered in the kitchen with a trade with a new hot cup of tea "Don't know why I even bother", she said, mostly to herself, when John came into the room as well. "john! Thank God you are here!", said the woman "he hasn't moved from there since this morning!" she said exasperated.
'Couldn't I just stay quiet?' thought the doctor to himself while grabbing his jacket to go out for a walk. Sherlock wanted to move, to talk, to tell John that he loved him too, but it seemed that his body and his mind were not willing to coordinate. It wasn't until John was about to leave that the consulting detective managed to finally say
On their way to where the crime had been committed, John asked Sherlock what exactly did he do, to which Sherlock replied "I'm a consulting detective, only one in the world, I invented the job" John was surprised, he had never heard of such thing and asked "What does that exactly mean?". The consulting detective  smiled and said " It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me." John chuckled and said "Yeah, but police don't consult amateurs." Sherlock simply said "Well, when I asked you yesterday if it was Afghanistan or Iraq, you seemed quite surprised" "I was, how could you possibly know?". Then Sherlock inhaled, looked at John and explained how he managed to deduce him. "That was  amazing" genuinely said the army doctor, looking now at a very confused and unsure Sherlock "Do you really think so?" "Yes, that was extraordinary; it was quite extraordinary" replied John with a warm smile directed to Sherlock who still couldn't believe what he was hearing "People don't usually say that..." "And what do they usually say?" inquired, curious, John "Piss off you freak!" said Sherlock smiling a bit sadly.
Sherlock saw most of these things. The detective spent the first months after his "death" there, near the doctor, looking after him; but he had to be really careful not to be seen, or his friends' life would be endangered. Only Molly and Mycroft knew that he was alive; she was the one who helped him to fake his suicide, after all.
That day John was meeting with Mycroft to see if he could help him in any way, if he could know anyhow what was bothering his little brother.
Both men continued to stare at each other for a long time. Sherlock moved a little closer to John and bent down a little. Their noses were practically touching. They stayed like that for several minutes until the detective took a deep breath and staring into the doctor's eyes said in a barely audible voice
And at that exact moment, it hit John; he hadn't been the only one alone during those two dreadful years. Sherlock had faked his death to save his best friend's life. The detective explained to John how, during almost two years, he had been dismantling Moriarty's network; Sherlock had fought for almost two years while Jim's workers were still a threat. John didn't know any of that, of course he didn't. It wasn't until that exact moment that he understood the real purposes of the taller man. His best friend, John, would die if he didn't jump. And now that the doctor was aware of it, who could really blame Sherlock for making sure that John was okay?
John was livid... Fury was running through his veins at that moment, but instead of punching Sherlock in the face or anything similar, he started to sob uncontrollably and asked
The two men thought that the kiss would become more gentle and soft eventually, but it was the total opposite; they both felt every time more restless and aroused.
After a few more hours Lestrade, John and Sherlock left home. The Detective Inspector, said goodbye to the two men and went to Scotland Yard, while the consulting detective and the doctor hailed a cab and went back to 221B.
"I haven't dared to go there since I moved, you know..." said the doctor, chuckling sadly. He kept on talking
"Obviously, Mr. Anderson. There were two types of vinyls in the burn-out remains of the car; effectively a costume."
Both men sat down on a bench at a park and started catching up. "So John, tell me, what have you been up to these last years?" John's face saddened a little when he heard that question: all the memories were coming back to him now. "I have been in Afghanistan, in war" Mike looked at him without knowing what to say, but John kept on talking "I decided it was time for me to go back home when I got shot" said. "oh wow, I had no idea, I'm so sorry John..." Mike replied quietly. "Oh no, don't worry, besides the limp, I'm fine now!" said John, with a little smile on his face. Then, after both men had talked about what they had been doing, Mike asked "Hey, do you wanna visit the University? I work there so it wouldn't be a problem to let you in if you want to see it." "Yes! that sound great mate!" answered John excited to see the place where he used to study years ago. 'Will it have changed a lot since I was there?' thought Watson to himself.
Sherlock kept on playing violin for several hours, not caring about what time it was nor if John could hear him from his room. He just felt the imperial need to keep on playing to keep his thoughts aside. But it didn't really work; his mind was all over the place, asking questions that he might never get the answers to.
On their way to where the crime had been committed, John asked Sherlock what exactly did he do, to which Sherlock replied "I'm a consulting detective, only one in the world, I invented the job" John was surprised, he had never heard of such thing and asked "What does that exactly mean?". The consulting detective  smiled and said " It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me." John chuckled and said "Yeah, but police don't consult amateurs." Sherlock simply said "Well, when I asked you yesterday if it was Afghanistan or Iraq, you seemed quite surprised" "I was, how could you possibly know?". Then Sherlock inhaled, looked at John and explained how he managed to deduce him. "That was  amazing" genuinely said the army doctor, looking now at a very confused and unsure Sherlock "Do you really think so?" "Yes, that was extraordinary; it was quite extraordinary" replied John with a warm smile directed to Sherlock who still couldn't believe what he was hearing "People don't usually say that..." "And what do they usually say?" inquired, curious, John "Piss off you freak!" said Sherlock smiling a bit sadly.
They cuddled for a little while, and when John looked up at Sherlock, the taller man couldn't resist it but kissing his boyfriend. His lips were so warm and soft, the detective loved the touch of them on his own lips and skin... But their kiss was interrupted by Lestrade storming into the room screaming
Neil couldn't stop crying while talking about his best friend, and the way he talked about Jane and how his eyes sparkled a little when he mentioned his best friend, made both, detective and doctor, assume that he was Jane's boyfriend. That's when Sherlock asked him
The doctor stood up, went to the kitchen and hugged Sherlock from behind. The detective almost dropped his experiment when he felt the sudden hug from John; he was so concentrated that he hadn't noticed that his boyfriend entered to the kitchen.
"Mycroft, please!" he steadied himself, took a deep breath and said again "Please. I need to go back."
John was having trouble to sleep too. What Neil said... Sherlock was exposed to danger almost every day, what if at some point something happened to him and the doctor hadn't been able to confess him how he felt? 'It wouldn't matter anyway, if I did confess my feelings towards him... He is always saying how he doesn't want to get involved in any romantic entanglements and such...' John chuckled, sighed and not much later, fell asleep.
Sherlock couldn't help but thinking how John would look like shirtless, he used to be in the army, so he must be quite fit. Sherlock's face turned even more red and he almost choked on his tea at the thought of the army doctor being shirtless. 'What is wrong with me today? I am fantasizing about my flat mate John, my pulse is accelerating every time he is near, my stomach doesn't feel like usual whenever he approaches me... Oh no.' the detective's eyes opened wildly 'I have feelings for John Watson... No, it can't be possible. Sentiment is a chemical defect found on the losing side and I don't have feelings. Or do I?' kept on thinking the detective with his eyes on John, who still was writing his blog, the whole time 'Analyzing all the factors that I have been experiencing recently, to have feelings for my flat mate is the only possibility.' Sherlock, after a while of thinking about his feelings for John, started to feel a bit blue, because John would never like him back... , since the army doctor always showed interest towards women. That, however, didn't mean that he was totally straight. Sherlock had been analyzing John, they lived together so Sherlock found it inevitable, and deduced that, even though if he didn't admit it, John was not straight. 'Bisexual maybe?' asked to himself the detective.
"But it was a Skype call, Mr. Holmes" replied David, still not understanding what Sherlock was trying to say
"Seriously? Sherlock with an intuition?" said John chuckling. The detective turned around and said to his now boyfriend in a flirty tone
The doctor started to get a little bit nervous when he started thinking again about what had happened the night before; did it mean that they were now dating? After a while of thinking about it he asked
It had been several months now since the detective's death and John still went to his grave every single day. He just talked to him about anything and everything or sometimes he just sat there and cried. This went on for months, until one day the doctor went to visit Sherlock's grave, as usual. He walked through the mossy hills of the cementery until he arrived to that solitary black grave that laid beside a very tall tree, which, now barren, had no use in shadowing the grave.
"Hmmm. Well, they are a pair of trainers, I'd say new but the soles are well-worn so, Holden must have had them for a while now..."
John woke up to the sound of Sherlock's violin. 'Has he stayed awake all night?' asked the doctor to himself; he just shrugged and went downstairs to have some breakfast.
Once they had reached the murderer and arrested him, they went back to their flat, gasping from air from all the running they did. Both, consulting detective and army doctor headed to their rooms to get some rest and while getting changed John realized something: he had forgotten his cane at Angelo's restaurant. He got into the sheets and a huge smile covered his face. For the first time in years he felt... alive. And all of it thanks to the great world's only consulting detective Sherlock Holmes.
"Ah, shame" said sarcastically the doctor, while walking to the kitchen. "Is there anything to eat? I'm starving"

He got into the sheets and a huge smile covered his face. For the first time in years he felt... alive. And all of it thanks to the great world's only consultant detective Sherlock Holmes.
After a long while of staring at his very handsome and talented flat mate, the doctor realized how late it was and decided to go to get some sleep. Before that, though, John said
Greg was astonished, and so was John; how could he possibly solve crimes so fast? It was a mystery to them. Sometimes John wished that he could be inside the detective's mind to see how it worked because it never ceased to amaze him how smart Sherlock was.
"An outside eye. Second opinion, it's very useful to me" interrupted Sherlock. John just shrugged, grabbed the shoes and started his deductions
He asked for the tea through one of the phones on his desk and a few minutes after, a man came into Mycroft's office with a tray with two nice hot cups of tea and some pastries, he left it on the Sherlock's brother desk and left.
The doctor nodded and not much after he was on his way home. He couldn't stop thinking about what Mycroft just told him. Sherlock had a drug addiction... He decided that when he got home he would register every corner of the flat to find anything and throw it away.
"Listen, er, has he ever had any kind of" he paused and frowned a little "boyfriend, girlfriend... a relationship? Ever?"
David and his wife Amanda were starting to get a little angry because that had nothing to do with their son but still, Mr. Anderson said
The doctor took a deep breath and opened the door. He looked at his surroundings. The detective's room wasn't as John expected it to be at all; it was very tidy and it didn't have any decoration, just a small night table. John sighed and started looking under the bed, the closet, the night table's drawers... Nothing. But then he looked under Sherlock's pillow and he found a little box. John's eyes widened and his knees were weakening. He took a deep breath, opened the box and there it was... a needle with some morphine and next to it, a little tube with a bag that contained cocaine. John couldn't believe his eyes.
"Good night Sherlock", he said, yawning. Still no response from his flat mate. 'What has gotten into him?' thought John to himself.
After several hours, the detective stood up, went to the window and started playing on his violin. Not much after, his phone received a notification. It was Lestrade, again, asking him help with another case. Sherlock stared at the message for a short while, but he decided not to reply. He put his phone in his pocket, lifted the violin and began to play the same tune again.
After that, the doctor started looking everywhere, trying to find any stash that Sherlock could be hiding. He started there, in the living room; he had to be very quiet and cautious in order not to wake Sherlock up. John spent two hours looking in every corner and he found nothing there. He proceeded to look in the kitchen, even in the bathroom, but still he found nothing. Then there was only one place left to look: Sherlock's room. John felt very guilty; going into his flat mate's room... It was invading his privacy, but after all, he was doing it for Sherlock's sake.
John clearly VERY confused asked "wait, who said anything about flatmates?" "Well" began explaining the man while putting his coat and scarf on "I told Mike this morning I needed a flatmate and now he comes here with you, a retired military who was in the army in Afghanistan not so long ago. Pretty obvious, tight? Well I must dash now. I have to go and see some bodies at the mortuary. I found a very nice flat in centre London, so I'll meet you at 7.00 p.m tomorrow".
"Sherlock, you know that I'm here for you, right? If you need to talk or anything you can just-" his sentence was interrupted by the detective
When John started laughing, he looked straight into the taller man's gorgeous eyes and leaned on to kiss him again. The kiss started softly, but it deepened. Sherlock ran his hand through John's sandy hair; the doctor tangled his fingers in the detective's dark soft curls, provoking a small noise to escape from Sherlock's throat. It drove John mad; he tried to bring the detective close as close as humanly possible.
Grinning and with a huge smile plastered on his face, John arrived to 221B and, as soon as he entered into the flat, Sherlock, who had been working very hard on a case, told him "I need to get some air, we're going out tonight"
After a couple hours, they were done with dinner and decided to go by foot back to 221B. They didn't talk much on their way back, the silence they were sharing was not uncomfortable at all. John looked at Sherlock a couple of times and realized that under the moon light, lots of shadows appeared on his friend's face, giving him a threatening but at the same time attractive aspect and the doctor, realizing how handsome the detective was, smiled, and looked away so that his flat mate couldn't catch him staring. Sherlock, out of the corner of his eye, looked at John too, he could see he was smiling, what about, he didn't know and didn't care, as long as he could see John smile. The doctor looked very handsome under the moon light...
"Yes, we have heard a lot from you. Thank you very much for coming" said the woman on the edge of tears. Her husband, David, put his arm around her in order to comfort her, and said
THIS CHAPTER IS VERY VERY VERY SIMILAR TO THE FIRST EPISODE OF THE BBC SERIES "SHERLOCK" BECAUSE I WANTED THEM TO MEET EXACTLY AS THEY DO IN THE SERIES.
"As I was saying, future is as important as the present... and... well, Iam not the emotional kind but, I don't see mine without you, John."
John, after a while, started getting ready for his date with Sarah. He was very nervous because, lately, his dates weren't ending very well because, even though John could feel attracted to his date, it didn't feel right... Once he was ready, he leaves the apartment with a grumpy Sherlock in it.
The doctor couldn't believe what he had just said; he had just confessed his feeling to Sherlock. Hi could feel his heart expanding in his chest as it heated faster than ever.
"It was your birthday Mr. Anderson, of course you were disappointed that Charlie, your son, couldn't make it back from his gap year." Started explaining the detective.
Once they were in, Lestrade started telling them about the dead man "His name was Holden Byers. 19 years old. He was a very promising athlete. He had some sort of fit in the water. When they got him out... it was too late."
That day, John noticed that Sherlock was acting a little bit weird, more than usual. He acted as if he was nervous, but what on Earth could he be so nervous about?
John came back from his walk and saw Sherlock asleep on the couch. He smiled and sat on his armchair, where he spent several minutes looking at his asleep friend; he looked so innocent, so relaxed... His lips were slightly parted, his long eyelashes were now on his prominent cheekbones, and his curls were falling on his smooth and pale forehead.
Not much later, Sherlock decided to finally go back to Baker Street. When he arrived, he couldn’t help but staring at the door for a while; ‘221B’ he thought with a smile forming on his lips ‘home’.
He scooted a little closer and allowed his mouth to take the place of his hand. He didn't kiss him, he just stared at him; he was breathtakingly beautiful. John ran his hand through the detective's curls, and when their eyes met, he could see the hunger and desire in the taller man's eyes. The doctor knew that Sherlock was not going to stop him, he even looked kind of desperate, as if he was begging for John to keep touching him.
Molly was about to finish her shift; she went to her locker to grab her things and go home, but as soon as she was going to close the locker again and leave, she saw, on the mirror hanging on the locker’s door, a man behind her. She gasped and started shaking in fear, but then, the man came a few steps closer and became visible. It was Sherlock. The woman, who understood perfectly what was going on, smiled and said
"I wish..." Sherlock looked at John very confused. He deduced wrong. John just gave him a little smile, and Neil continued talking
The army doctor hailed a cab and on his way to 221B he thought about what Donovan just told him: that Sherlock was a psychopath. Sure he's different, but a psychopath?' thought John to himself.
Sherlock told John to wait for him there in the flat, since he struggled so much while moving, but all of the sudden he frowned and asked John "So army doctor, huh?" to what John replied "Yes..." "You must have seen a lot of injuries, and violent deaths" said the detective smirking "Yeah. For too much" replied John quite unsure of what was going on. "wanna see some more?" Sherlock asked. "Oh god yes" and both men left the flat, hailed a cab and headed to the crime scene.
"It's Sherlock. How will we ever know what goes on in that head?" the woman replied with a little smile on her face. John smiled back, and finished his breakfast quietly.
After a while of staring at Sherlock and wondering what was it that was bothering him so much, the doctor decided to go get some fresh air. This way, he got dressed and headed to the street.
"I thought it just sort of... happened". Mrs. Hudson laughed at the comment, hugged Sherlock and went back to her apartment.
"Virtually undetectable. There were tiny traces left in the trainers, from where he'd rubbed the cream into his feet. That's why the murderer threw them away!"
"What about that Swedish case?" asked John, in order to find a case for his friend so he would calm down.
"Oh my god, Sherlock, are you blushing?!", he said laughing, causing the detective's cheeks to go even redder
John was at the morgue talking to Molly, who became a close friend of the doctor when Sherlock died, when out of the blue the woman asked
The next morning Sherlock and John went to the lab to examine the evidence collected from the crime scene. While examining some of Holden's clothes, the detective and the doctor's hand brushed accidentally. They both looked down to their hands, both trying to hide their smiles, feeling butterflies on their stomachs. Sherlock gazed into John's beautiful green eyes until the doctor cleared his throat and went back to work, with his face burning red.
Then, he saw Mrs. Hudson opening the door of her apartment. He went inside, where the woman gave him a cuppa and some biscuits. John noticed how mad she was and apologised for not keeping in touch with her. The woman understood how much he had been hurting and how hard it must have been for him, but still, she would have liked a phone call. Nevertheless, she forgave him. Sherlock had asked Mrs. Hudson not to tell John that he was alive yet, since he didn't know, and she obeyed. John stayed there for a little while, talking to the landlady, until he decided to finally go upstairs to see the flat he had been living in for five years.
But he got no response. Instead, Sherlock picked up his violin and started playing. John sat on his armchair and listened to him, with his eyes closed. After a while, though, the doctor started to feel tired so he went to his room to have some sleep.
"Could you stay for a while?" asked Sherlock in a barely audible voice. John smiled warmly and sat down on the detective's bed until he fell asleep.
"Okay. Tell me where the crime scene is and we'll be there in a few minutes" said the detective, whose eyes glittered with passion and excitement.
John pulled himself into the detective's lap and started kissing his face, softly; he planted a kiss on his forehead, on his cheekbones, his nose, and so on. His breathing became raggedy and one of his hands moved on to John's hip.
John's jaw dropped to the floor "Amazing" is all he could say. Sherlock never ceased to amaze the doctor, how could he deduce so much from just a pair of shoes?
"If anyone can throw any light into all this darkness, surely it will be you" David was now smiling sadly. Sherlock smiled back, stood up and started pacing around the room until he stopped in front of a little table placed next to a bug window.
John arrived to the flat late in the afternoon. He pulled the key out of his pocket and held it in his palm, staring at it. After a few seconds, he inserted the key into the lock of the door, hearing the familiar "click" of the door unlocking. He pushed it  open and went inside. Partway down the hall, John stopped, staring at Mrs. Hudson's door and breathing out an anxious breath. In his head, he starts to hear Sherlock's violin playing. Then, he looked up the stairs as a snippet of an old conversation sounded in his mind "That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever done" "And you invaded Afghanistan!". John smiled sadly as the memory faded out from his mind.
"And?" inquired the detective, amazed at his flat mate, who even though missing the most important things was doing very good and looked very adorable while trying to deduce.
At that precise moment, Mrs. Hudson came into the flat and said "Oh! My boys are going on a date!!" "N-No, Mrs. Hudson, we are just going to have dinner we are not-" John was interrupted by their land lady saying "Ah, I am fine with it, there is no need to hide... Anyway, You boys have fun!!" she exclaimed, heading to the kitchen to place the food she had just bought to Sherlock and John.
"Well, with the facts you have given me, I would say that my little brother is suffering from a broken heart."
"No, I didn't tell him..." he chuckled cheerlessly and looked at Molly, who was staring at him pitifully. There. He finally said it. He felt a huge relieve but at the same time a big amount of pain; he was in love with Sherlock but he couldn't tell him now. Then, curious, John asked
Meanwhile Sherlock had been waiting the whole morning for the doctor, but he didn't show up. The detective started getting nervous. Did John regret the idea? Did he think he wasn't truly ready to visit 221B? He entered in a spiral of negative thoughts, with a sad smile on his face.
After a while, Sherlock proceeded to examine the shoes, meanwhile John was talking to Molly, asking her if she'd found anything odd on Holden Byers' corpse, but she said that she didn't find anything.
Sherlock, too, stared at the doctor for a long time; he enjoyed observing John's face, he wanted to memorize every single detail of it. Sherlock approached John, whose face cheeks were growing redder by the second. The detective felt his heart racing in his chest and felt how the butterflies in his stomach wanted to be let out of their cage.
When the detective and the doctor arrived to Jane's room they knocked on the door and went in, where Jane was laying in the hospital bed in a coma, they also found the man, sitting in one of those uncomfortable chairs, holding Jane's hand and with red and swollen eyes, from all the crying. He clearly hadn't moved from there in hours and he had had no rest either.
John sat on his armchair and contemplated Sherlock playing violin. There was something very majestic while he did that; his delicate hands moved very gracefully when he drew the bow across the strings making that wonderful music that filled the silent room... Also, his usually frowned face looked very relaxed and passionate while he was playing; his features softened and his eyes were closed but his heart was open, since the pieces Sherlock played were his way of telling people how he felt. John could spend entire days watching his best friend playing, and he wouldn't get tired of it.
John's cheeks reddened when he heard Sherlock's flirty voice and he coughed a little bit, clearly nervous. Lestrade just looked at the two men with a smirk on his face. The detective kept on looking at the little table for any clues.
"I am measuring the coagulation of saliva after death" stated Sherlock. Watson face palmed. 'He can really be a pain in the ass sometimes' thought the doctor to himself.
"You know... I wanted you not to be dead, Sherlock..." the detective just looked up at where John was standing and with a sad smile on his face he said
"I differ with you because, even if right here and right now obviously matter, the past is very important..." he paused for a while. John looked very confused. What was he talking about? The detective looked quite nervous, but why? He inhaled deeply and kept on talking
"Yea, the son who was in the Alps. DNA tests match perfectly" he paused briefly and sad again "Night of the party, the car is empty and a week later they find the boy dead at the wheel!"
This situation went on for several days until John decided that he had had enough. He couldn't see Sherlock like that anymore, it was like he didn't even care anymore if he was pushing away the only few people that truly cared about him. This way, John decided that he had to talk to him; he went to the living room, where de detective was laying on the sofa, probably in his mind palace.
Sherlock and John said goodnight to each other once in the flat and went to their rooms to get some rest. However, it took Sherlock a long time to fall asleep since he started thinking again about John denying  that they were dating when people asked. John denied it as if only the thought of them both being together repelled him... Sherlock felt sick just imagining that John could actually be repelled by him. But why did he care so much? He was used to people rejecting him and telling him mean things but when it came to John... When it came to John, Sherlock cared: he cared about how John saw him, he cared about John's critics and compliments, he was even a bit scared that John could leave him because he got tired of his "non ordinary" habits and such. After a while, this spiral of negative thoughts that had been in Sherlock's mind, seemed to disappear when the consulting detective realized, with ta huge and genuine smile plastered on his face, that John was the only person to accept him from the very first moment. Was Sherlock Holmes, the man who claimed to be emotionless, starting to have feelings for his flatmate and best friend John Watson?
They managed somehow to stand up, without breaking their kiss, and walk into Sherlock's room, where the taller man took John's jumper and t-shirt off. The detective saw the scar on his best friend shoulder and kissed it, gently.
On his way back home, he couldn't take off his mind what Sarah told him. 'I am not gay. Am I? I mean, yes, Sherlock is a very attractive man with his beautiful eyes, and his cheekbones and those dark curls falling on his smooth forehead skin, but... Oh my god. Do I really like Sherlock? Well, it doesn't really matter if I do because there is no way that he is ever going to reciprocate since he doesn't believe in love and such' thought John. He had never been attracted to a man before but it's true that when he was around Sherlock he felt different, and despite the fact of believing that Sherlock could never like him back, John hoped that there was, at least, a small chance that his feelings were reciprocated.
"What? Why?" asked John chuckling. But Sherlock didn't reply, he just stood up and headed to their room (John had moved into the detective's room a couple of months ago), leaving a very confused Watson in the living room. 'What the hell has gotten into him?' started thinking the doctor to himself. At that exact moment Sherlock came back, but he didn't sit on his armchair, he just stood in fron of his boyfriend and said
