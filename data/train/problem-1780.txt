“O-oh, sure, let me just put a coat on,” he responds, taken aback for a mere moment before he understands what’s happening. They’ve done this social dance before.
It makes the need for dying relax a bit. Makes the internal screams of wanting to make it all stop a bit softer.
“There’s… one last thing with all of this that I’m not quite sure of,” Sherlock says with a nervousness that I thought was completely dissipated since Moriarty’s death.
“You look beautiful,” I whisper.
Sherlock complies, handing the gift over with a grin. John rips the gift-wrap off with gusto, unveiling a denim jacket, lined with green tartan.
“Yeah, I suppose I should, shouldn’t I?” I try to hide the pain the phrase brings me. He gets up, looking almost lost. Then, he grabs his jacket off the door and his keys out of his pocket. “I’ll see you tomorrow?”
Some time later I feel a blanket cover me and there’s a feeling of warmth radiating through my chest. Not pain, this time.
Doesn’t matter. Moriarty.
“I do pray I do not sound foolish or rude in asking you this, but it would be dishonest to say I have not wondered. If this trial may negatively affect you and Dr. Watson directly, why have you remained in England for this last month when it would be infinitely safer upon the Continent?”
“They were rather fantastical, I must say. It is time for me to step down to earth once again.”
I was greeted the following morning with a horrendous nightmare of Burdett’s bloodied corpse, haunting me and startling me awake. Holmes roused beside me, reaching out to calm my mind as short breaths escaped my lips.
Finally, he sees a water droplet fall onto the light grey concrete beneath him, and he realises that it is coming from his eyes.
“Now what’s this, Holmes?” he asks.
I awoke the next morning with a beautiful happiness in my chest.
This fic has quite a few time jumps, and I wanted to specify that this takes place before the events of Chapter 2.
Two sets of giggles fill the room as Sherlock and John lay on Sherlock’s bed. It’s a warm summer morning, without doubt making its way into a hot summer day, and they’re both just wearing their blue jeans. Sherlock turns to face him, and the fast paced conversation from before takes a striking halt.
gonna make her cry even more?” His voice slithers across the room.
“Faith had precisely what was coming to her, Mr. Holmes. She wasn’t long for this world as it was, anyway, was she? But you know that already.”
His father may be the only one with alcohol running through his veins, but the Watson household slows and sloshes with drink as if it exists in the walls.
Instead of that, I say, “Yeah, I did.” He doesn’t respond, and slowly dozes off.
The park reminds me of my recurring dream of me and her, walking along. It’s horrid and it stings as if the bees buzzing around me began to attack. I know they haven’t. Bees remind me of—
“Oh?” Holmes hummed, still keeping his eyes on the mirror as he unbuttoned his shirt.
If Moriarty’s threats on that rooftop were genuine, how are these things allowed to fall through the cracks? Was this all just part of some horrific plot?
He doesn’t say anything for a bit, just simply nods. He kisses my chest and rests against me—a comforting weight.
“But you saved me time and time again, not only from myself, but in every way, all the time. You sacrificed more than anyone ever should to keep me from harm, and I’m sorry it took me so long to see that.
“O-oh,” I stammer for a second. “I didn’t know you’d want to.”
I removed my clothing, adorning myself in comfortable pyjamas before I lay down on our bed. I watched as Holmes wet his hair in the water basin, removing the oil from his curls, and put his own sleepwear on when he was finished. As he closed the wardrobe and turned to get into our shared bed, a knowing smile grew on his lips.
“As… friends? Right?” he replied slowly. John’s chest felt heavy. He couldn’t tell if Sherlock was offended or just confused.
Sherlock is sitting, smiling, flirting, with another boy.
“Wilde’s case is making certain that my mind shall not be at ease even once until it has all mulled over, it seems,” said I.
He stares at me for a second, blank faced, before responding with, “Oh.”
he remarks before fading into the shadow of an elm tree.
“It was my idea, Mrs. Holmes. I should have known better, I’m sorry,” John interrupts, drying his hair on the towel carefully, making sure to check if he’s bleeding.
“I hope that’s alright with you,” I utter, running my hand up and down his forearm.
I looked up at my companion to see his eyes already upon me and a grin spread across his face.
for letting me,” he replies, as if capable of hearing my thoughts. He kisses me and I wonder how it’s possible for me to be this lucky.
Rather than getting an answer of words, I felt his thin arm reach around my back. My defensive mind forced me to make certain of what Holmes undoubtedly was already aware of; no one could be seen for miles. I leaned into him and laced my arm around his back as well.
“NO!”
“I’m completely knackered after all that,” he says, putting up his jacket in the dark.
When she catches up after two, three, maybe 100 minutes, Mary tries to place her hand on his shoulder but he jumps away from it. He hears an echo of a voice, like a distant memory of a current event. John’s eyes burn, much like his lungs.
. “HANDBAG!” I turn back around and she’s gone and I run downstairs. “Stop! Wait!” I can’t let her get away she can’t possibly get away
“It was nothing. I just… freaked out for a second. It’s fine. Let’s go somewhere else,” he responds, standing up and taking his bag from Mary’s hands. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.” There is no genuinity behind his words.
John gets dressed in his jeans and stonewashed denim jacket, lined with multiple homemade buttons of bands he (at least openly) enjoys. Led Zeppelin, Queen, Sex Pistols, Depeche Mode, etc. He leaves off the more “flamboyant” groups.
She means the best. Anyway, I’d better be off, the surgery’s packed today and my break’s over.
Phoenix
“Okay.”
“Leave me alone.”
“Yeah, we did,” he says with an attempt at a chuckle.
“Hi.” Sherlock looks a bit like a lost child, but he sits down next to me and stares forward. Trying to be the sane one here. He always was in the end, wasn’t he? I’m certainly not right now, that’s for bloody sure.
don’t?” Sherlock looks more confused than John thought he would.
“I know that things have been difficult for you these last few months, and I know that you and Sherlock both have… have been through a lot. I hope I’m not imposing or anything by—”
“I believe it will, as long as our discretion prevails,” Holmes agreed.
I let myself see him more. We solve cases sometimes, other times we just watch telly and eat take away. It’s almost like before, but it’s not. After he…
Gear up for the last chapter, it will be out soon!
On the morning of April 20, I awoke to find Holmes sat beside me, fully clothed, with a letter in hand. Initially, I thought it was from Mycroft once again; perhaps we had received news on the Wilde case. However, as I regained my sense, I realised the flamboyant scrawl of a signature upon the bottom of the page. Certainly not something the systematic Mycroft Holmes would do. I sat up silently to see what Holmes could possibly be so drawn in by, and was able to read what was written.
The delivery room has probably 8 nurses in there and our doctor all crowded around Mary. I know this is bad but I can’t get close enough to ask any of them what’s wrong and my brain is only about half-working. I know I should stay anyway,
We join up with Mycroft and Lestrade and the details all begin to fall into place. The pieces Moriarty and Mary decided to leave out, like the fact that
“Sherlock… I assure you that—” Mycroft tries to explain but,
“Let him,” Lestrade confirms. They resign and agree, ushering me inside. I silently thank him. “Sherlock, I’ll follow behind and meet you there, okay?” I nod and sit beside John on the way to hospital once again.
————————————————
————————————————
When I was still young and lonely, I’d thought it impossible to ever be at peace enough to give up high-stakes, adrenaline heavy work that constantly made my brain work. So full of self hatred that the idea of stopping terrified me. When I started to reject cases to instead visit a museum with my husband (something warm fills me up even saying it still), or to stay at home and read a book, retirement becomes a thought in the back of mind.
“Do I get to call you my boyfriend now?” he asks me, smiling. I can’t help but smile back.
I hope this full and complete conclusion gives you peace and makes up for any sadness still left over. It's no longer 1895, and Holmes and Watson deserve to live happily in every possible adaptation.
“John Watson, do you take Sherlock Holmes to be your husband?” The word is remarkable, beautiful, perfect, everything I wanted; the word is made to be attached to Sherlock.
“Hello, Mr. Watson,” Sherlock says with his typical false confidence voice. John holds his breath, stopped in his perch like a bird, helpless to the will of its predator.
“I have decided to take up your habit of staring at the man I care for,” he responded in a hush.
Mrs. Hudson sighs and Sherlock closes his eyes. “Mrs. Hudson’s right. I’m burning up. I’m at the bottom of the pit and I’m still falling and… I’m
“Oh, thank you, Mrs. Holmes,” John replies, bowing his head before Sherlock pulls him out of the kitchen and up the stairs.
lips.
As we arrived, he finally spoke.
We decided, after over a month of deliberation, to hold the ceremony in the (actually tidy/partially cleared out) living room of 221B. Lestrade, Molly, and Stella helped us move the sofa up to my old bedroom, along with the coffee table, extra chair, small bookshelves, and the desk. It took multiple days, but Sherlock and I managed to decrease the level of clutter by quite a bit. All that remains is the lighting fixtures and our respective chairs. They’re leaned up against the built-in bookshelves, but we felt it was important for them to remain.
“Well, you’ve changed. You no longer top up your tan and your roots are showing.” Don’t know why that’s relevant. Got to be. Maybe not. “Letting yourself go?” Ooooh. I answer my own questions with 20 second latency.
“After the journey they’ve had, I should think they would want fresh, hot tea. Would either of you like some? It is no trouble, surely,” I said, already making my way to the kitchen.
“Okay,” Sherlock submits, knowing this isn’t going to get him anywhere. “It’s nothing, then.”
“I came in a taxi.” Liar.
me, there’s been a tension I can’t really explain. He’s more willing to touch me than he was before, but it’s as if the moment he realises that he’s touching me, he has to stop. I don’t know if it means what I want it to. I don’t know if it can.
“John,
I wish I had enough willpower to be angry.
Sherlock Holmes 11 July 20:12
Over twenty years have passed since I met John. My hair has begun to gray (only slightly) and the sharp angles and lines of my figure are starting to ache. I have been “Sherlock Holmes (and now Watson) The Consulting Detective” for the majority of my time here, and now is the first time I’m thinking about the future.
TWs: drug use, suicidal ideation +mention, self harm mention
“John.” Sherlock turns around, bringing a cotton pad dampened with alcohol up to his friend’s cut lip. John pulls away.
They’re wrapping up his wound on his thigh next to me. He’s sitting up now, most of the colour returned to his face. He looks over to me and gives me a small smile. I return it.
I thought
“It is most unfortunate, the things those like us must do to live a happy life.”
After a moment I notice the tears begin to fall down John’s face. His sobs are soft and reserved, but still raw. I let myself get up and set my tea down. I walk over to him slowly, tentatively as he covers his face.
“What were you speaking to him about?” I asked.
A few tears escape onto my cheeks and I cup his face, smiling. He reaches into his inner jacket pocket and pulls out a small, dark wooden box. It clicks open to reveal a ring (steel, lined with black, it’s lovely), and he takes it out, looking at me.
“For…”
“You… erm.” I squeeze his hand with the one not holding the paper. “You amaze me everyday, Sherlock. You gave me an entirely different view on the world I walked in, and it made me want to live from your perspective. You may not believe me, and you may think I’m embellishing, but I saw…
Smith sighs and looks down, but the grief seems plastic, forced. Nothing close to what I feel. It makes something red and angry boil in my chest.
There is nothing more to say, except:
I hope that this was enjoyable for all of you reading as it was for me writing it. These characters mean the world to me, and this part of their story is the closest to my heart compared to all the rest. Whether you play the Sherlockian Game with the canon timeline like I do, or just enjoy these two being soft with one another, please let me know how you felt about this subject matter and the way I told this story.
“Yes, yes I think it does.”
I kiss him slowly with both hands on his cheeks, telling him how important this is to me in the best way I can.
“You can’t pretend like that didn’t just happen. You scared the shit out of me!” She sits next to him and tries to touch him again, this time on the knee. He accepts with little but an internal reluctance.
“That’s okay, love,” I respond, running a hand up his arm.
“I-I don’t know if I can just—” I want to say yes. So badly do I want to say yes, John, but—
“And what, Sherlock, do you propose?”
Thank you to my boyfriend and editor, Finnen.
Today’s the day.
He pulls me into a kiss and everything is weightless and wonderful. “You’re my boyfriend,” he says playfully. I feel like a giddy teenager, talking like this with him. But the innocence of it is incredibly refreshing given our track record.
“Well, Sir, I completed the coursework so quickly that I had time to conduct some additional experiments and tests that I thought you may want to take a look at,” Sherlock explains. John smiles warmly while looking down at his desk. Many of the other students look bemused by his frank nature of explaining, but John finds it charming. Mr. Sawyer shakes his head with a grin, takes the collection of papers, and continues down the line.
“How do you propose we do that?” I asked innocently, avoiding the grim nature of it all.
He stops himself, takes a breath, and realizes that John is curled mostly into a ball at this point on the far left side of the bed. ⅔ of the bed are completely clear. Sherlock sighs in relief,
“Good,” he begins rolling up the other sleeve. “Say that for me. Say it.”
“What is it, John?” I think I know, but it’s not enough. He turns and looks at me, but I stare at my tea.
“You know why I’m here.”
“I WILL NOT HAVE A DYKE IN MY HOUSE!” The sentence is an explosive, burning everything in its wake. John has a sense of knowing, knowing that this conversation is no more than an inevitability that he could have foreseen with ease. But seeing it play out in front of him, on Christmas Eve, somehow makes him feel even more sick than he’s anticipated before.
“Not at all, I think it makes you optimistic.”
Much love,
I scoffed playfully and tapped his right leg with my walking stick. He chuckled softly, however a pensive expression overcame his features almost instantly. I knew what must have been causing it, so I asked the question both of us had been avoiding.
When he came home from Mary’s earlier in the afternoon, there was a letter on the kitchen counter from an alias he recognised all too well, Sherrinford. They had created codenames for one another back in Year 11, sort of like a game. John’s was Ormond. Now, they held a separate meaning all together.
“You are a soldier, and a doctor. Two things I knew about you from the moment I saw you. You are endlessly vigilant and set on keeping people safe; something I’m not always as good at.” I look down to where the scar under his ribs rests beneath layers of clothes and smile sadly. The one time I failed. “You save lives, everyday, all the time. And you saved mine.” He swallows again and mindlessly runs his thumb along my hand. Tears fall and make the tiniest sound as they hit my collar. I reach up to wipe the marks from my face.
“You,” I mirror from just 6 hours before. I can’t keep my eyes open. I have to close them so the world doesn’t escape through them. Tears start to form under my eyelids and before they can fall John speaks again.
I take a deep breath after a fittingly long silence. “He took Sherlock away from me for two years, because of what
is what I don’t say. “You can keep your scars, I want to see your handbag.”
Plans must be sorted out, and discussions must be had.
As I finished this chapter up, I got more emotional about it than I thought I would. The catharsis of their lives and circumstances throughout this story came directly from my heart in so many ways, and I cannot begin to say how much they mean to me. I hope that was clear from the reader's point of view.
“Y-you don’t, er, mind?”
I sigh, and let go of his arm. “Fine. Go. Tell me what I need to do.” I still feel like I’m suffocating and realise it wasn’t the car that did it. I look back to Mary and gesture mindlessly for her to follow inside. I keep forgetting she’s here.
“Hey,” he speaks softly and holds my arm. His fingers leave indents in my skin. “You okay?”
Holmes let out a deep sigh, “Knowing the pride and confidence the playwright displays, I feel he will not opt for escape. He will wish to face the battle, regardless of consequence. The criminal justice system of the British Empire, however, is unfortunately not forgiving enough to allow him a victory.”
All John can think about for the rest of the evening is how Mrs. Holmes knew that her son was out of the house in the middle of the night after all of thirty minutes, whereas it will be a genuine surprise if his parents even notice that he stayed at Sherlock’s tonight at all.
“I-I think I’m in love with you too, John.” John stops breathing for a moment, then remembers he must keep breathing because he lives in a world where Sherlock Holmes loves him back.
“Think I just did, didn’t I?” Fake it ‘till you make it’ is  a saying, right? “I’m sure that was me.”
He gives me a puzzled expression like he doesn’t know what I’m talking about and I hate it. “It’s all right, John,” he says finally. His voice is calm and quiet; careful. He’s being careful with me.
“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it? The dead can’t speak, Sherlock.” Never in my life has hearing my name made my ears ring.
Three days passed uneventfully, and it was then time to walk the half mile to the train station, on our way to Wembury in the southern peninsula. The rocky beaches seemed appealing to my need for relaxation, as well as Holmes’s need for mental stimulation and discovery. He had been there before as a young child, so I was intrigued to see somewhere attached to a time before I knew him. He typically disliked any discussion of it, as his parents were long passed, and he felt detached from the individual he was as when he was young.
“Go to the police; they’re really excellent at dealing with this complicated sort of stuff. Tell them I sent you; that ought to get a reaction.” Giving up, then, aren’t I? “Night-night.” It’s fine.
“No,” John mumbles, looking at the floor.
At least he’s welcome somewhere.
anyone, Sherlock. These are the facts as they exist.”
Oh. We’re at Baker Street. Sherlock rushes onto the street and it takes me 5 seconds longer than normal to realize why we shouldn’t even be here. I step out of the car quickly and grab Sherlock’s arm.
“Good morning, my love,” I reciprocated. It was simple, yet so full of feeling and depth. Only our hands and knees marked points of contact between us, and yet there was a constant energy shared, as if we occupied the same space, the same life. Holmes inched nearer to me, draping his arm over my waist to caress my back. I eased my way closer, allowing him to hold me tighter. I pushed my heavy eyelids open to greet his soft blue-grey irises, and I felt utterly calm.
“Goodnight, Sherlock,” once more.
What could’ve led him to—? It couldn’t be— No, why would he possibly—
“Kiss me again?” I ask.
Harry Watson 11 July 19:22
“It’s. Nothing.”
“You promised me there was nothing else,” I butt in finally. Done being passive. Done letting this just be between them. “You
“Sherlock, what the hell are you doing?”
“You’re not going to want to climb up another flight of stairs, I imagine, with…” I lazily gesture to the wound in his thigh that’s brought me far more trouble than it’s worth.
“You can’t carry on like this, little brother. Sentiment gets the better of you yet again.” Know-it-all big brother Mycroft’s voice gets more authoritative.
about tea.
“Handbag.”
“Lestrade, do entertain the courtesy of arresting my elder brother,” Sherlock spits out before standing up alongside me. The two of us storm out of the bleak room, my heart racing. The second we get into the sitting room of 221B, I turn to Sherlock (calmer, this time).
Mycroft
I so desperately don’t want him to leave my sight.
I’ve seen John in his suit during fittings in the months leading up to this intimate affair, with only a small gasp and a kiss to his temple. But when I see John in his suit the morning of our wedding day, I could swear (if I had less knowledge of the principles of human anatomy) that my body begins to melt at the sight. His hair is styled only slightly, his short bangs pushed back with my assistance and expertise. His perfectly tailored trousers and jacket compliment his compact and masculine figure in such a way that shortens my breath. I stare at him from the doorway while he preens himself over. I got myself dressed in the bathroom, for purpose of ceremony.
Both young women blinked back an empathetic sadness between one another before Miss Bennett found the words to reply.
“You secretly like these Bond films, don’t you?” I ask him when the living room is dark and we’re far too close together on the sofa.
In the secret darkness of this suite, we could cherish the few remaining days we were allotted before we had to return to the life of Sherlock Holmes, the Detective, and his friend, Doctor John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Here, we could be Sherlock and John, husbands, nothing more.
Just half an hour ago he was going to leave. Again. And now there’s all of this shit with Moriarty and he told me to go back to Mary a week ago but maybe it was all part of the plan. Does he even have a plan? How am I supposed to know anything anymore? How am I supposed to follow behind him like a loyal companion if he won’t fucking tell me anything?
“If I’m so sloppy, why have I not been caught?” He knows the answer.
“You don’t have any clear idea of what needs doing yet, and he hasn’t made any direct contact with you. I’m taking you to the bloody hospital.”
I stare at my left hand in shock for a moment and then throw my wedding ring off my fourth finger. The sound it makes as it hits the floor makes my ears ring.
Over the last year we have been going through the process of moving out the place we’ve called home for two decades. Mrs. Hudson no longer inhabits 221A, and memories line these rooms like wallpaper. The sounds of central London, while once appealing and calming to my deafening thoughts, is now overwhelming and filled with risk we don’t seek nearly as often. I found a small cottage with a stretching garden, perfect for beekeeping. John thinks it’s charming. There is a surgery in town where he can take part time hours, and our garage is the perfect place for a laboratory. Today is the last day of moving boxes into the house. Molly and Stella assisted us through the process. They’ve been together almost as long as John and I.
“What…
I see him stirring, wanting to leave. “You don’t have to stay. You can go home. You’ve had a long day.”
We sit in silence, ultimately sitting nearer to one another than usual. His hand rests between us, tapping against the leather, and I stare at it for most of the ride back
John sighs despite himself and leaves the safety of his bedroom to face the day. Downstairs, the sound and smell of fry up envelopes everything. The sweet smell of the beans, the sausage sizzling on the pan, the hint of egg surrounding it, the perfect aroma of toast, and the tomatoes add a bit of freshness to it all. The beauty of his mother’s breakfast almost erases the knowledge that the same pan those sausages sit in now, hit the floor only 8 hours previous, just almost.
“You see, Mr. Holmes, I have a need to confess. Part of Jim and I’s business arrangement is that he needs people killed and I need to confess to those who can stay quiet.”
I haven’t seen John in weeks. I work. It’s okay.
“I am going to request that Miss Bennett and her companion meet us here to discuss the more delicate details of our current plan,” he announced passively. “I will be back within the hour after sending the telegram, in time for tea. I would ask you to join me, however the sight of the both of us together raises the risk of public recognition by at least thirty-five percent. Do you require anything from the main road?” I knew it marred him to say this, but it was not untrue. Still, he placed a comforting palm upon my shoulder as he spoke and I smiled up at him. I placed a small kiss upon his knuckles before covering them with my own.
This chapter is much less case focused, and I hope you all enjoy it!
My eyes shutter open and he’s there, by my side. My heart may burst with the pure joy that he’s still here.
“It’s.” Forgot what I was going to say. Oh! Right. “For a case. It’s for a case.”
I sit on the side of his bed delicately and initially just attempt to call for him.
My companion had an expression of dread form on his face that faded just as quickly as it arrived. He composed himself as fast as he could before answering the naïve woman.
I decide to stand and take his hand in mine, gesturing for him to get up with me.
“Oh,” John was slammed back into reality for a moment to notice that he had, in fact, put the last three ornaments on the same small branch of the tree, and the last one was about to fall off. He took the extra two off and attempted to find other branches.
His lips formed into a small smile, one for my eyes alone, and the two of us walked back to our private quarters.
There is a rather intense level of protectiveness John feels towards his friend, but it is in no way unnecessary. In the short few months they’ve known each other, there have been a dozen incidents in which nasty notes and comments have been left in their wake. As they have gotten closer, it has become harder for John to resist retaliating in some way. He knows where that nasty impulse comes from, though, so he tries his best to kill it.
The train ride is uneventful, and as they arrive in Brighton, the streets are bustling with families and students along Palace Pier. Mary grabs John’s hand, and leads him to the new Twister ride with no hesitation. His hangover is still lingering a bit, but not enough for him to resist the thrill rides.
I wish the world would cease to spin.
at all,
Our walk along the Newton Brook utterly alleviated my existing concerns, yet the moment I saw Mycroft’s name upon a small letter at our cottage, all my worry returned. Surely it was yet another update on current trial proceedings, and I was ill-equipped for the truth. Holmes opened the envelope with a certain care and focus that put my nerves on edge. He was methodical and stoic, often how he behaved at the most dangerous of crime scenes.
He squints his eyes and takes a deep breath, opening up again to look at me.
I don’t work until I do, I suppose. There’s a knock on my door after two weeks. I know the flat looks like a drug den. I don’t really care if I’m honest. But there’s a knock on my door. Client. No one else minds to knock anymore.
“It’s okay,” I offer.
“John you can’t put three ornaments on one branch, they’ll fall off.”
. “Your life is not your own. Keep your hands off it, do you hear me?!”
“Leave them!” Lestrade bellows.
“If you’d be comfortable with that, yeah,” he replies gently. We both know he’s completely qualified, but there’s more to it than that.
“Yeah.”
————————————————
“It’s painfully early,” I say, trying not to startle him. Sherlock must know I’m awake, but even still.
I have a new lead in an aspect of Moriarty’s game if you’re interested.
“I don’t care about the fucking facts, this ISN’T JOHN’S FAULT!”
“Hello.” His tone is light, but I see his fingers twitch against the table just slightly.
I don’t know why he thinks I deserve it.
“N-no, it’s fine, I just. Rosie has a crib here, you barely work at the surgery anymore except when they call you in every now and again, you’re sleeping here, I just thought that. I dunno, maybe you—” words are difficult.
The beach that day was lovely. April’s chilled winds passed through us with ease, and the ever-present English clouds overhead were rather calming. Holmes’s arm was intertwined with my own as we paddled along the shoreline. We only felt the cold beach water every other time the tide came in, and it quickly became soothing as opposed to jarring with its temperature. Our trouser legs were rolled up a bit to avoid the wetness, and everything felt at ease.
“You know.”
His expression was empty as he met my eyes. Despite his predictions, it was clear he was more affected than he anticipated. The silence surrounding us grew, black and vast and entangling both of us in its mist. But, my muscles were finally able to break through the stupor, and instinct took over. I wrapped myself around him, overcome with a need to be near him. He responded instantly, our breaths synced and anxious.
“I’ve been out of the house more in the last 24 hours than I have been in the last month. I hadn’t gone more than 6 hours without a drink until you pulled me out on this case yesterday so. I should thank you. I didn’t know I needed a distraction.” Oh. “So I’m sorry, okay?”
Holmes’s jesting countenance slowly replaced itself with one of true contemplation as I spoke. As I finished, only a temporary pause was needed before he replied.
Every scar across his torso, those he chose to have to let his true self shine, and those that were inflicted upon him from unfriendly hands, were different pieces to a story of Sherlock Holmes. It’s a story I would read again and again, loving every possible minute.
John only works four hours today, so I utilise my time as best as possible to make it truly perfect. Signifiers of our lives together cover the sitting room entirely. His old cane leans against the chair next to the sofa. My violin with the song I composed back during our first New Years together (which I imagine he didn’t know was for him at the time), sit on the coffee table. A menu to Angelo’s (which we both admittedly know back-to-front) is on the desk.
“D-do you mean…?” I can’t assume. I can’t risk it.
“What is it?” I ask calmly as we walk up.
“Joooohn, come on, get up! The day’s already started and we’re losing precious time!” Mary Morstan, aged 17, tugs at John Watson’s covers with a fervency that he does not understand. He groans in response, trying to pull the covers over his hungover head to at least somewhat muffle his girlfriend’s pleas. He has always hated his birthday.
I have to be sure this isn’t another hallucination, another falsity I’ve invented to pretend he’s here when he isn’t. When I see Mrs. Hudson pulling him out of the car, I get the slightest confirmation it's real.
Figuring out that Magnussen worked for Moriarty was one of the easiest threads to tie. Almost too perfectly sensical. Almost too logical. Of course, why wouldn’t he use a press giant with no moral code? The pieces of some horrifically twisted puzzle I thought were long over and solved. For the first time, the work is lacking the fun and passion it once had. Perhaps it’s because
For a moment words don’t come. We remain still in this quiet room, and I realise that I have to clear the air. “John, I don’t care about her. She texts me every once in a blue moon when something interesting enough happens in my career that she hears about it. She probably just congratulated me on solving this case with Smith. She’s married… to a woman.”
“It’s ok, it was an accident,” he tries to push out a smile, “I don’t think we knew we were doing it, huh,” John’s voice is 60% breath now and he puts his forehead against Sherlock’s, closes his eyes. Sherlock lets out a shaky breath.
And we go get chips. Brilliant.
“Sherlock, it’s alright, I’ll be okay, I promise. You’re under advisement from a doctor, remember?” He’s trying to reassure
What am I supposed to say to
I’ll be honest. I did not once in my life, before meeting and falling in love with John Watson, believe I had a future beyond the next month. Future was not part of the vocabulary required to exist, and I barely wanted even wanted to do that for the first 30 years of my life.
We spent the remainder of the afternoon sorting through each individual situation, each problem. Finally, after eating no lunch and imagining the agony of dinner being passed as well, Holmes found something. He batted the existing letter from my hand and replaced it with one he had spotted.
“Fine. Then you won’t,” she says, with a surface level emotionlessness that John sees through in milliseconds. She turns away from her father, makes her way upstairs to get her bag, and in less than two minutes, Harry Watson is out of the house, out of this broken idea of family. Catherine shouts after her to stay—they’ll work it out, they’ll talk about it—but her pleas are ignored.
spot on her trousers and on the floor.
Holmes stared blankly at the cream coloured paper, motionless. The quiet of the room was interrupted by him ripping the top, breaking the seal on the truths concealed inside. As he unfolded the singular paper, he read the words in silence. This was not one of Mycroft’s updates he would say aloud. My partner’s face remained composed, still, and lacking any characteristic expression of which he was known for. He gestured for me to take the letter from his hand, to read the words myself, and I accepted the offer with reluctance.
As we boarded the train, we had our luggage taken care of before taking our seats in a private first class cabin. Holmes was dressed in a light grey suit, perfect for spring, and I wore one of a taupe colour. His hat matched the suit, and was Cahill in style. Mine was my favourite bowler cap. I must say, our attire was well coordinated.
“Sherlock,” Holmes began, looking at the paper. “As of the fifth of April, W has lost against Q. W awaits potential charges and a second trial. More news forthcoming, Mycroft.”
I throw back the rest of my glass of whiskey to shock myself out of the thought.
“Didn’t you know, dad, dykes set the trends now?” She says, trying to poke at his chest. Before she reaches him, though, he grabs her arm.
I nod and turn my hand around in his so I’m holding it back. Something small to tell him this is okay. He doesn’t pull away. Instead, he tilts my chin up, making me meet his eyes. My breathing quickens.
Maybe, John thought, he imagined it in its entirety.
“John,” Mary whispers from somewhere. “John, what’s happening?” She sounds concerned.
(See the end of the chapter for
“John?” he asks, making sure I’m still mentally here.
He adjusts a bit so their faces are on the same level. They are looking each other in the eye, and John feels electricity surge through his entire body. “From the very start, John. Always.”
“I-I know that you’ve had negative experiences before with… relationships… and I know you might not…” he trails off again and tightens his grip on my hand.
and I don’t know what I’m doing. Dear God.
Clamp my eyes shut. I

“Yes?”
chair next to me.
“I’m on my way.”
“What do you need, Sherlock?” Oh, John.
“Even the murder of my daughter?” Ooh, his confession comes rather easy.
He has to this time.
Her words register for the first time, but he cannot make himself look at her. Once, twice, now three times he has tried to answer, but words will not manifest in his mouth. How can he articulate what just happened when he doesn’t know? What possible explanation is there for this?
“John,” Sherlock says, as if his name is a statement in and of itself, and rests atop John’s chest, looking up at him despite being the taller of the two.
“Go ahead and wash up, John. I’ll have a cup of herbal tea ready for you when you get out, yes?” Violet offers, looking back to John and her son with a warm smile.
“Thank you very much for the compliment,” I said, turning the two of us towards the door.
“Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else?” she asks, as if she knows my answer must be yes. She’s not allowed to know that.
The trail of items go on to tell the best story I could manage of how we got from the beginning to the present. It leads him into what is now our bedroom, where I’ll be waiting.
Special thank you to my wonderful friend
“I’m sorry?” Just as confused as I am, Faith. Promise.
(See the end of the chapter for
He feels Sherlock tense underneath him a bit.
We’ve silently crossed a precipice into something else that is only somewhat clear to me. I allow myself to rest closer to the middle than to the side, and John follows suit. We’re not touching, but it’s a near thing. I’m tentative to turn my head to look at him, feeling his eyes on me. But his presence beside me calms something deep I have yet to recognise. Before John doses off completely, he mumbles:
We are officially at the half-way point of the fic!! I hope you enjoy this and get excited for what's to come.
“Or is it because I’m so obviously a victim who needs to be protected by all of you? I don’t need your protection, or your mum’s, or anybody’s! I don’t need
The Personal Blog of Dr. John H. Watson
I hope you like this more relaxed chapter, it was very nice to write. Any feedback is always welcome, and kudos/comments are always appreciated
“No, not American; left-hand drive, that’s what I mean.”
“I love you,” he whispered to my skin.
The following Monday, John is meandering his way between classes. He is halfway through Year 10 now and yet to grow taller than 1.6 metres, whereas the rest of the boys in his year have largely surpassed him.
Wow!! Only one chapter left to go!! The twelfth will be a fast forward into Holmes and Watson's lives 30 years after the Wilde verdict, so I truly hope you all have enjoyed the 11 chapters of this story so far. I want to write more fics in the future about other aspects of their timeline, so please let me know if that is something you would be interested in.
“I didn’t choose to come here, but I still need any help you can provide and I know that a distraction could do us both some good.” I hate that he’s right. The anger resurfaces yet again because he’s
“I—well,” he begins again. “I had a whole speech and now I can’t seem to get it out.”
John sits down, “Tea?”
The birds chirp carelessly and it feels hateful sometimes. As if the world is mocking me with its plethora of life. It’s starting to be spring, and it feels all too cheery.
Rather than expressing my rage before my solemn lover, however, I simply said, “Then it shall be so.”
“Sherlock you don’t have to—”
Eventually I feel a heaviness come over my eyelids from our last adventure, as he continues to play for me. I lean back on the couch, sinking into the throw pillows, and begin to doze. The sound of his classical drawl leading me into a calm rest.
“What exactly do you mean by that?” I’ve clearly upset him.
To my surprise, our bedroom door creaks open slowly from behind me and John tiptoes in.
Harry Watson 11 July 17:58
My marriage is a ghost. It already was. I drown my first week of being childless with 4 bottles of scotch whiskey and I do not know when my wife is here and isn’t.
John falls asleep on the sofa one night after a long and exhausting case. Rosie’s with Mrs. H because he and Sherlock were out all day and she was gonna bake her cookies. (She’s almost 2 now, she can eat cookies. It amazes John, little things like that with Rosie.)
Oooh boy, we've finally got some true angst on our hands haven't we? Let me know what you think of this chapter please, as your feedback means the world to me.
“Can we go outside for a bit? Skip rocks on the creek or something?” John asks, beaming up at Sherlock.
Sherlock’s eyes opened again at the question, “Do you really not know?” his voice was soft, and his arms wrapped around John’s waist in response.
“We should get some rest,” I said with a hoarse, unused voice. Holmes nodded, and we made our way to the bedroom with our hands intertwined.
“No,” is all I say. Then he’s sitting up and looking at me. “What do you need?”
We share a hug, leave the coffee shop in opposite directions, and I stare ahead of me. It’s time to go with him.
They decide that Rosie can have the room upstairs to herself from now on. Sherlock and John won’t be needing two bedrooms.
She sits down and tells me her name is Faith Smith. I’m not too far gone to not be here right now. Still here in my flat. Still hear her words. Sometimes I’m not here at all.
The thoughts of her in the nursery and walking in the park still sit in my mind throughout everyday.
It could be fun, Sherlock!
The day carried on with minimal effort, Holmes and myself resting and mindlessly working on small projects. As I read a thrilling adventure novel in the parlour, Holmes approached me, adorned in his jacket and hat.
It’s about time, you two! The three of us should go out for drinks to celebrate.
“Sherlock,” he’s short for breath as he walks toward me, “Sherlock, are you alright?”
“Oh, of
There are certain days, as time passes, where it almost feels like things are getting better.
“I love you,” he returns, simply. We’ve said it thousands of times over the years. It is natural and everything that’s needed to erase the agony we’ve had to endure.
They see Mary dead on the floor and Moriarty dead in the pool first; utterly shocked.
“I would argue that you may be even more so,” I teased. The smirk upon Holmes’s face grew wider, and he brought his right hand up to my jaw to pull me into a kiss. His lips were soft against my own and the weight of the day melted with each second. When we separated, our eyes met and the world surrounding us ceased to exist for a brief second.
“No. W-why do you ask that?” I’m starting to feel like J—
John finds joy in little else but that smile.
“My skirt?”
puts away the last few things they brought down, turns off the lights, and sits on the right side of the bed to take off his shoes. Lies down, facing right, with all his clothes still on and lets his eyes shut out of exhaustion. Something about John’s weight on the other side of the bed is comforting as he falls asleep.
“But you’re not the end of his plans for me, I’m sure. You
The three of us head out the door, out of the flat, and Mycroft has left the car outside. His new-found (or maybe not so new found. Necessary?) faith in my ability to take care of his brother is both strange and comforting.
I wake in a cold sweat, hands clammy and sheets mussed at the foot of the bed. I hear the faint sound of his violin. I haven’t heard him play since my wedding, and I notice my cheeks are wet. I try to fall back asleep and his playing manages to ease the thoughts circulating in my brain.
John inches his hand towards mine and decides to covers just my fingers with his own. Much like the conversation we had a few weeks back in the kitchen. The rest of the room is chilled, but his hand is warm and welcoming.
“Put pressure on it. As much as possible, don’t worry about hurting me.” Oh, John, if only I could manage not to worry about you. He sounds soldier-like, as always. Despite the strength in his words, his face is losing colour and I feel tears well up behind my eyes. “Hey, hey,” he says, grabbing my other arm. “I’ll be fine, all right? Just call the ambulance, we’ll be okay.”
There is a case with these busts of Margaret Thatcher being smashed all over London. Reminds me of that case John and I had after The Woman business with that other Thatcher bust. It was painfully boring. As I solve this new case I realize that in the other one was probably the overbearing girl best friend who did it and she framed the victim’s boyfriend for it. Homophobia. Framing. Maybe that old case was more interesting than I thought.
I find it almost laughable how many times she decided
John scoffs, “You? Sherlock Holmes? You want to go to the beach? With people, children, and noise?”
To my dismay, he pulls away after the fleeting moment in which we crossed over the line we’ve been dancing along for far too long. I don’t let him speak first this time.
“I’m gonna make you my husband today,” Sherlock declares, lips almost touching my own. I bridge the gap, tenderly sharing an existence.
“HE ALMOST DID KILL US, MYCROFT!” I scream, standing up now in my own fit of outrage. “HE TRIED MORE THAN A DOZEN TIMES!”
She scoffs. I would too. “You can’t know that!”
Finally,
Watson?” He says my title like he questions if I deserve it.
I turn toward the window and look down on the street to look for something. There’s nothing. People. It’s cold outside. March chill. There’s a couple walking on the pavement hand-in-hand and I try to pretend it doesn’t make my chest cave in. I turn back to her and shake my head.
By the time they finish everything and send us home, it’s well past midnight. Lestrade offers to drive us, and we’re both so exhausted that I hardly process the ride at all.
“John! John, are you alright?” Sherlock stammers through his words, his voice higher than normal.
“What are you talking about, ‘too far gone,’ what’s happened?” There’s an anger that fills up my chest to the brim and I hate how selfish the anger is.
and it’s only then that I notice the tear tracks imprinted on his cheeks. We are still briefly before he decides to speak:
“Sherlock, look at me?” he asks cautiously.
Miss Bennett frowned, placing a hand upon Miss Sampson’s knee. “Are you in a similar thought as myself, Mr. Holmes, about the inevitable conclusion to a trial this grim?”
He pulls away a bit, hand still resting on my cheek (warm, comforting, safe).
I wish I could tell him. I wish I could tell him that all of it is a lie and that Mary tricked him one last time. I wish it was that easy.
Maybe not drinks for me, but come to our place for dinner?
“You must send her our new address, then. This is too important to waste time with such things,” I said.
For all the birthdays I’ve had in my life, my 35th is set to be the best so far. Our wedding is just three weeks away, and 221B has changed its scenery quite a bit. It’s not a large guest list (neither of us keep many friends), but I have meticulous charts and lists of every detail. John tries to tell me that it’s all going to work out fine, but I can’t seem to stop double and triple and quadruple checking every last step.
“B-but, er, but what about. You always. We’re not,” John knew what he was trying to say despite his inability to let it out.
“I cannot thank you enough for all you have done, sir,” she said, mumbling slightly against Holmes’s collar.
After a moment of silence and existing in this frozen section of time, the weight of room deepens and I readjust a bit to look at Sherlock properly.
“My case.”
I wished to comfort him somehow, to be capable of finding the words to soothe his worried mind. But, if I could not calm myself, there was no possibility for me to assist him. I looked to my right to see that the curtains of the parlour windows were open, revealing the empty field outside. The darkness outside seeped into our rooms as the dim lights from within leaked into the open air. My impulses compelled me to pull away from my lover, rushing over to the windows to close the curtains, as if I was concealing the rest of the earth from our light. Anxiety rose and fell within my chest, and I turned back to Holmes once more, seeking the comfort of his presence.
“OW!” James over-dramatises, placing a hand to his torso, before meeting John’s face yet again.
“But, sir,” one of the EMT’s tries.
“Just, text her back.”
“I never thought… I didn’t think you would want—”
“Yes, of course,” I exhaled, thankful for the understanding nature of our guests.
“N-no.”
What they’re doing here is not what friends do, is it? I mean, it’s Sherlock and maybe Sherlock doesn’t know how friends work and maybe John doesn’t either but. John’s never heard of other people doing this with their best friends, and Sherlock’s more than just a best friend. He’s family, right? Sherlock thinks John is family, apparently. He’s a single father about to move into a flat with another single man so he can have someone to raise his daughter with. That’s not something “just friends” do, is it?
But then he realizes just how
“It’s nothing.”
“What?” he responds in a deadpan. The music wipes away the feelings trapped in his brain, like a clean slate. His face tightens, and the redness in his eyes turns into nothing but a distant memory.
“John,” I mumble close to him. Just saying his name is enough to ground me. I place my hand on his shoulder. “John, what do I do?”
Indeed, they will.
I try to laugh, ultimately letting out a breathy open-mouthed sigh. “Y-yeah. That’s, er, that’s fair enough.” It’s a truth I know I can’t fight.
He moves his hand off me (cold.
Exactly one month after John lost his child and Mary managed to escape our trap is when I decide to bring cocaine back into my bloodstream. I pretend those events are unrelated.
Sounds a bit too close to home.
“Shut up. I’ll be at the hospital in 20 minutes.” He hangs up. Always here to help, it seems.
The sun set over the earthy, unpaved country road, leaving shadows of trees upon our faces. After a silent, peaceful moment of this, I decided to say what was occupying my mind for far too long.
It seems to go on like this for hours, years, millenia, before James Watson gives up. He falls to the floor beside his bloody, battered son and laughs. The sound makes John’s ears ring.
Shove off.
I realise that I haven’t said anything.
“John,” I push out, 70% air, 30% the actual word. “Are you… sure?” It’s merely a whisper.
This car feels utterly suffocating.
We avoided John’s extended family as well as mine, and no acquaintances, to avoid unnecessary questions about Mary and the both of us being gay. Plus, there truly isn’t enough room for anyone else.
“Now that, I’m not too sure. Best of luck to you, though, James, and I’ll make sure to call your missus as soon as we hear a word.”
Instead, Sherlock hands him a cassette tape with the cover still on. It’s brand new, and John has never seen it before. In the top left corner is the word
I pretend I’m not worried about leaving her out of my sight.
I read about your… public declarations this morning.” The words sting the insides of my mouth.
He reached into the inner pocket of his jacket and revealed the small envelope in which the telegram was concealed. He broke the seal upon it, and opened it up to read.
Before he can see what he’s doing, John’s fist plunges into James’ stomach, sending the venomous figure onto the floor with a drunken stumble.
Smith takes us into his “favourite room.” The morgue, naturally. He tries to mock me and Sherlock brings up something I have yet to hear today:
“Sherlock? Can I tell you something if you… if you promise not to run away?” John gulps.
“Sherlock.” Ooh, he’s disappointed in me, I see. Big shocker, this one.
I open the door and the look on her face tells me this is
As time passes, I keep trying and failing to help. Sherlock is always there in the waiting room with a full cup of water when I come back.
Political cartoons adorned the front page, mocking both sides in the least subtle form of subtext. Only a few paragraphs in, I decided I could no longer take it. I folded up the offensive article and shoved it into the desk in the parlour. Holmes emerged just then from his study, instantly spotting me in an irritable state.
“Sherlock.”
and shoves his face firm into the pillow.
My life has been defined much by what my senses experience. I use my visual and audible and tactile senses for the work I do everyday. My deductions rely on me to be able to see, hear, smell, touch (and sometimes taste) the world that surrounds me. I have experienced my senses while high on cocaine, morphine, various other opiates. I’ve been drunk, and seen what the world was like with alcohol masking it. I’ve experienced being touched in (most) ways through hugs, kisses on the cheek from my mother and Mrs. H, pats on the shoulder, hands running through my hair. I’ve received 195 bee stings in my life. I’ve smelled Mrs. Hudson’s various pies, biscuits, and cakes. I’ve been burned, beaten, shot, kidnapped, whipped, stabbed. I had thought it was highly unlikely for there to be a sense I could not predict or had not felt myself.
“Has to be for a case. Moriarty! It’s Moriarty’s fault.” That usually gets him to shut up when I’m sober, right?
“I didn’t confess anything!” Smith protests. “What would I be confessing to?”
“You are smitten, Sherlock Holmes.”
he breathes.
I haven’t seen John in a month.
“It’s all here, isn’t it? Look.” I stand and show her the paper. It has to be, right?
“Stop relapsing?” he asks, so delicately.
Time to go meet Culverton Smith.
It’s well past midnight when we’re giggling and this time I actually haven’t had anything to drink. Just the mix of late night tea and post-case adrenaline which leaves us gasping for air between giggles on the sofa.
I shut my eyes and take in another deep breath. I don’t know what else to say right now. I get up and make us more tea to do something with my hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlo…” he mumbles. For a moment I think he might be awake and know I’m here, but he starts wrestling around again and whimpering quietly. That means—Oh.
I know what I wish he would say, and I know what I expect from him. Time seems to stop as I wait for which one it will be.
For a few moments, my friend merely kept his eyes locked to the message. I remained quiet, uncertain of how to respond. The local newspapers had said nothing related to the case, as only London papers found interest in the issue. So, these few words were our only source of information on the subject. I had not anticipated the trial to conclude so swiftly, but our safety was very much at risk regardless. Mycroft’s words of a second trial and potential charges only fueled the fear in me further. As I lost myself in negative thoughts, Holmes finally spoke.
“Good?” he clarifies.
John Watson 11 July 19:58
The day drudged onwards despite an overwhelming need for it to cease, so Holmes and I spent much of the day indoors. We were much more affectionate that Monday in comparison to what was usual, yet it felt natural and utterly necessary.
Let a scoff escape my lips. Of course. “You only want me sober for my

Here we go.

Need to stop prioritising him over other people. Need to take care of this other situation.
John’s eyes flicker open and he feels warm. Safe. Comfortable. Before he notices anything else, he notices the light of the morning seeping in through the small window in Sherlock’s bedroom.
Harry Watson 11 July 18:52
“I’m on my way.” What? Why would he. He doesn’t. He wouldn’t.
————————————————
I start going on walks. Occasionally I find myself in Regent’s Park, far too close to the flat I still think of as home. I don’t know if I’m going there on purpose or not, I just go.
“Perhaps a more secluded one. I heard about this hidden beach in Whitstable that’s only an hours drive from here. Come on, it could be nice. We’ve done nothing whatsoever since summer holiday started, and we both know our families won’t do anything of actual interest,” Sherlock pleads.
“Sherlock, are you awake?” he says in a hushed voice. He’s carrying something but I can’t see what.
A pan hits the kitchen floor downstairs with a loud
“I love you,” I mirrored to his forehead.

“I’d love that.” John beams back at me. Truly beams, as if he’s a ray of sunlight. My chest fills up.

s and other sweet nothings while they don’t let the other go.
“We’re going to miss the train to Brighton if you don’t get up now, John, come on!” She curls up next to him, and starts poking his back over and over. John groans again, irritated even further.
“Murder castle, but done right. I have a question for you. Why are you here? It’s like you walked into my den and laid down in front of me.” His vocal quality is not unlike a snake.
he gestures to the general image of High Me, “doesn’t get any worse.”
My voice returns to me and I push out a hushed reply, “Sorry.”
“Where else would he have gone, then?” A tinge of his true nature seeps through the question.
The Cure, was it? John snaps his fingers in recognition. The weight of the lyrics shakes something in his gut, but he ignores it to face the situation at hand. He searches around the garden, looking for something he could toss up at the window. There is a twig from the neighbouring tree, a few small pebbles, and a patch of flowers. Seems the pebbles will have to do.
“Of what?”
in this situation. How ridiculous.
“Even after… everything?”
Thank you all so much for taking time to read through this and go on this journey with me, and I hope you come back to read the epilogue (weddings and Sussex and dogs and a soft experience of growing old with one another).
Sherlock seems to push down the smile on his own face as John looks up at him, but before he can think of why that is, there’s a knock on the door.

And that same evening I made a vow to protect you no matter what happened to me,” he checks with me to keep going by stroking his thumb along my knuckle and I respond in kind.
“I was given a telegram from my brother this morning by the innkeeper just before we left for the station, though I have yet to open it,” Holmes answered. “I thought it better to wait until we were in private.”
“Gladly.”
John Watson 11 July 19:07
Hello everyone! It’s been awhile since I’ve posted on here, and many new things have happened that I want to share.
“What were you doing to him?!” he demands. “What were you doing?!?” Before Culverton could feasibly respond, John shoves him towards Lestrade. “Restrain him, now.”
Sherlock sprints over to John as fast as his legs can manage.
Later that evening, we retired upstairs to sleep. Our room had two single beds, separated as is custom. We quietly pushed them together, and prepared for rest. As we lay together in the dark night air, Holmes spoke once more whilst resting atop my chest.
Then I wake up screaming and shaking violently and try to shove my face far enough into the pillow that maybe my breath will magically stop needing to escape my lungs.
That leads into the title of this post: Changes. There’s been rather a lot of changes coming at us both lately, some of which we chose and some of which we didn’t. Despite some of the more negative changes, I’m back in 221B, for good this time, and I’m happy. Really, really happy for the first time in quite a while. And it’s all because of Sherlock Holmes. I’m not quite sure how he does it, though it seems to be that every time I need him, he’s here. I try my best to do the same for him.
“Indeed. This game is on, as you say. Tell me, Sherlock, do you
“N-nothing. Give me mine.”
“Moriarty’s back, John, we have to do something. Now.” Sherlock looks at my hand, latched onto his bicep. I pull him closer.
John was taken aback by her gentleness for a moment. He has been visiting Sherlock’s house for years at this point, and yet even still he is shocked by how forgiving Violet and Siegfried are to both their own children, as well as to him. Even if there is discipline, it is backed with an obvious concern, and most of all, love. Sherlock and Mycroft may not always see it, but John does. John always, always does.
And then he’s gone. I notice just how large this room feels without him.
“Right,” I say. “I-I’m sorry too, John. You didn’t need to deal with… this… after everything.”
In all of it, we were lucky enough to have protective eyes in high places through the turn of the century, and we are now secluded enough in Sussex that it is safe to publish cases once more. It is impossible to deny, however, just how deep the roots of fear became in the years after Wilde’s imprisonment.
“No, no not really. I’ve just been suffocated after a week long cocaine binge. A bit short from alright. But I got my confession, didn’t I?”
I stand up. I know I have to go
“Expect nothing less from me, John,” Sherlock confirms with a nod, only to lock eyes with John. The two dissolve into giggles right as they reach the classroom door.
INTENSE TW: physical abuse, graphic physical violence, homophobic slurs, violent homophobia, alcoholism, and verbal altercations. Please please tread lightly with this chapter, specifically at the beginning. It gets rather intense, and I don't want anyone reading past a point they feel comfortable.
I allowed him to put his weight against me, lying down on the cushions. I wrapped my right arm around his waist, my thumb running a line along his back. His head fit in the curve of my neck, peppering soft kisses just there. Bringing my lips to his crown, I repeated a similar motion.
“I love you the same, Sherlock,” I whispered as my fingers passed through his loose hair. I gently leaned my head down, so my lips could meet his forehead, and he hummed in approval.
The door shuts behind them, and John can’t seem to stop his mind from running away from him.
Outside the window, summer breeze blows, coming from the west. Our words are carried with the air, wrapping around one another.
“Hello,” I reply. He keeps making over his clothing as if there’s anything in need of fixing (there isn’t; he’s perfect), when I walk over to him and hug him from behind, kissing his hair. I pull away just enough so my voice isn’t muffled, and lean my forehead against the back of his crown.
Sometimes, I go into the surgery and it reminds me of that night just a few months ago. The lights start to burn my eyes and the sounds of medical equipment moving around the hallways makes my ears ring. I have to leave early, stumble over apologies and excuses as I squirm my way out of the office. I go back to the always empty house, and I pour myself a drink.
John’s heart leaps in his chest. He wonders if Sherlock could hear it. “Yeah, yeah I think I’d like that.”
“John…” she lets out a sigh and drops her head.
Sherlock lets out another sigh and sinks into John. It’s still early in the morning and they’re both being pulled down by their own sleepiness and comfort. John feels his heartbeat quicken and he swears he can hear it in his ears. He’s
Sherlock’s voice pulls him out of the inevitable spiral for a moment.
Holmes did not speak any further, we merely shut our eyes and attempted to let rest overtake us. The weight of him sat on my chest, keeping me grounded to the bed and to the world. Our breaths linked up as I slipped into a deep sleep.
idea how lucky you are?” He really doesn’t get it, does he? “Yes, she’s a lunatic, she’s a criminal, she’s
I pull a chair up next to the right side of the bed and let him sleep. I can feel the weight of the day pulling me down as time (hours, minutes?) passes. Sherlock’s sleep deepens. My hand is placed lazily on the bed. I never text Mary.
It’s quite a sight to see, in fact. The diagram depicts a system in which the bees may roam freely outside the window, and yet still be accessible indoors. Sherlock is more of a theoretical inventor at this stage rather than a legitimate one, but the sheer thought behind it is astonishing.
“All right. I promise.”
“Hello,” he repeats back, returning the smile as well.
and it shatters the illusion John is inhabiting. His mother’s gasp can be heard through the floorboards and John stops breathing for ten seconds. He fights the urge to rush down to the ground floor and protect her, knowing that would only worsen the situation. As an alternative, he turns all his bedroom lights out, pulls the duvet over his head, and covers his ears with the thickest pillow he can find.
He sighs. “Sherlock, I might as well tell you now so
I don’t sleep much, only when my body gives in and I have to. I change John’s dressings twice. My mind races to think of what might be possible now that the cause behind 5 years of torment is gone.
“I must admit, you are rather fascinating, my dear,” I said. His eyes met mine as he wrapped his gaunt arm across my chest, resting his head upon my shoulder.
John sets his tumbler down with more force than necessary, “Just. Let me do this.” He grits through his teeth and I recede. “We need to finally discuss
“I’ve been a complete. Fool.”
I awakened to see Holmes curled into a semi-circular shape, mirroring my own position. His right hand laid on the mattress, and I could not help but place my hand over his. After a few moments of soothing silence, drifting in and out of sleep, I felt Holmes’s fingers curl around my palm.
It’s warm and safe. My empty, dark flat dances with life. I feel like everything is floating around me and my brain is finally calm.
Initially I think it’s just because he’s getting older, until he says one morning:
with me. Clearly, my lack of a response indicates something to him when he asks:
“I mostly enjoy watching your reactions. The way how, despite seeing them dozens of times, you manage to still be entertained and surprised by the plot twists and the one-liners as if you’re a new audience member,” Sherlock answers.
John’s swears his chest may burst. They keep their arms around each other’s waists and they’re touching almost completely from the torso down. “I love you, Sherlock.”
“Is everything all right, John?” he murmured.
He spends much of his nights at her family’s home, at this point. It’s acceptable, and his parents don’t mind as it often means they have one less mouth to feed. He’ll take the sick feelings over a broken nose.
No words I could possibly muster would even begin to mend the situation at hand, so the best effort I thought of was to remove the space between us and pull the man I love into a warm embrace. I wound my arms around his thin torso and buried my face in the crevice of his neck and shoulder. He reciprocated, wrapping his wiry arms round me. Our chests rose and fell with one another, and I knew Holmes required no words to understand my message. Stroking my back slowly, he spoke once more.
one, do you, living in isolation, no human contact, no visitors.” Interesting.
“Does that make me your boyfriend too?”
The two couples complete their final journey to Paddington after the trial has concluded, though Watson's thoughts are far from soothed.
The word safety rotted my eardrums. Safety had become synonymous with fear, with hiding away from the risks of the world and those who inhabit it. Safety was not, by any means, the life Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are meant to live. Safety was poison, was danger, was prison.
As we fast forward a few years into the future, John's life exists in a setting quite unlike it was in the years before.
“You’re sure?”
I don’t work.
Silence. Endless. Until,
The next time it happens, it’s in his chair and Sherlock notices within half an hour. He gets worried about John’s neck getting a crick in it, but he doesn’t want to wake him; he looks so peaceful. John doesn’t sleep through the night like that, though, wakes up a bit later and instead of taking the initiative to go home, he silently moves to the sofa and falls back asleep. Sherlock feels the weight come back again.
“We did it,” I declare.
“Was there a time you were intending to tell me that the only way for all of these pieces to possibly have worked,” Sherlock continues. “Were if someone incredibly close to me provided access to constant viewing abilities for my daily activity?”
I got the rings with Mrs. Hudson one day when John was at work. She reassured me of exactly what John and I would need. Now, I stare at his, twirling it through my fingers while the box sits on the bedside table.
“Excellent,” Sherlock beams and kisses him.
John thinks to himself, noticing a twinge of shame form in his chest. Still, he’s come all this way, so he will follow the cliche regardless.
I try to blink the thoughts away enough to respond, “W-why are you telling me all this?”
“What do you think, John, shall we help the poor girls?” he asked jestingly. I knew he would regardless, given his impulsive decision to offer Abigail all that he did within one day of having her acquaintance. It was more a question of
“I believe I have at last discovered why you were so quick to assist Miss Bennett and Miss Sampson in their escape.”
Cheap, light beer doesn’t burn when going down like it did when he was younger. John downs the bottle, nursing an appropriate buzz before sitting down to play Punch Out on the NES. He owns very few valuable things, but his Walkman and his NES were two that he makes sure to protect. Given the nature of his household, he never leaves it in the living room, so he has to set it up every time. But, his parents are out of the house for a wedding of a coworker or some other shit John didn’t bother to listen to, so he has the common area to himself for a bit while Harry’s out with friends.
Though my readers may not think this in any way characteristic of my companion, Holmes did, in fact, adopt the domesticity of our cottage with ease. One morning in particular, I awoke to the smell of fresh tea and an empty space in the bed beside me. I wandered down the hall to find my partner stirring cream into two cups. He had heard me leave the room—he always did—yet he kept a focused gaze on the task at hand. Once he stirred both adequately, his eyes met mine.
“All done!” he announces with a kiss to my clothed lower back. I pull my trousers back up and turn to him, smile wide across my face.
It’s half-ten on a Wednesday, when much of London’s secondary school students are winding down to sleep. John Watson, however, is quickly, shakily, making his way across the city.
He sighs again and leans down to meet my forehead (he seems to find comfort in it). “Just stay with me?” His voice is so unbearably cautious and delicate.
The pain that has lived within my chest for all 34 years of my life ceases entirely when John holds my face in his hand as his lips meet my own, and I swear I could do anything.
The weeks that pass without seeing Sherlock are filled with buying things for the baby. We set up the nursery, I paint the walls. She sets up the bookshelf. It’s
The Christmas holiday has quite an adverse effect on John.
“Shame!”
I’ve never once seen Mycroft Holmes more terrified than I do at this very second. He very well should be terrified.
I can’t see who did it. I can’t manage to keep my eyes open. The last thing I think of before my vision goes black is wishing for Sherlock to come find me.
Over the following weeks I sort things out with a realtor and leave most everything inside the flat for other people to deal with. It feels cursed, and it is unquestionably impossible for me to sort through the shit in the nursery without going completely mad.
It’s satisfying and relieving only for a moment until we’re both on the floor and John’s blood is on my hands. He’s been in danger too many times in one day. My body goes into overdrive and I have to remind myself to breathe.
“Hm. It might.” I realize she handed me her phone to show me a picture of her father. She’s at least 5 years younger in the picture.
“I built this whole wing. Kept firing the architect and builders so no one knew quite how it all fitted together. I can slip in and out anywhere I like, you know... when I get the urge.”
Sherlock responds, almost to prevent me from punching the man, “So… no signs of depression or suicidal thoughts whatsoever?”
“We’re both a bit of a mess, then, aren’t we?” his tone is kind despite his negative words.
Hospital rooms have become a common place for John and I to end up, it seems. Always me hooked up to an IV and him slouching over a stiff chair beside me.
I draw in a breath to ground myself after our short laughing fit and glance at him. He meets my eyes, and the room seems to pause along with us.
You’re starting to sound like me.
I toss my phone aside and look back at John.
right now?”
“Take me home, Mycroft.”
I look at him, grin spread wide across my face. “If that what you wanna be called.”
“Harriet, who said you could cut your hair like a dyke?” John and Catherine freeze. Harry looks up at her father, dumbfounded for a moment before her undying wit peeks through. Perhaps she thinks it’s safe right now. James Watson is holding a buzz from a night of mulled wine, that isn’t quite to the stage of violent drunkenness. Maybe it’s safe.
It’s okay.
John Watson 11 July 20:07
“John.” The way Sherlock says it sounds like a wish, a prayer, almost. Like he’s asking for nothing and everything all at once.
Holmes turned his head to face me and frowned. He took his time before any kind of response escaped his lips.
A knot formed in my chest, a physical reminder of my conflicting emotions. There was pain of the circumstances, yet undying love and need for this man before me. The world was brutal and cruel, uncaring towards those who inhabit it, but Holmes and myself could shut that world out for now. We could wrap ourselves up in one another’s proximity and ignore the hard edges and dangerous spikes of the world we lived in for the moment, so we did.
“Hey,” Sherlock greets him in a voice John misses so much more than he can anticipate every time he doesn’t see him for a few days.
Sleep is impossible. I rarely dream, but when I do it’s the same “Did you miss me?” over and over again until I can’t keep my eyes shut anymore.
It was not the conviction. That was, at most, frustrating and disappointing. Conviction was expected. What brought my thoughts to a seizing halt was the description of the court’s reaction. Of how the public shouted the heavy, far too meaningful word of “Shame.” How, in this very case, Shame had been used as evidence against Wilde’s lover and himself. How the love that dare not speak its name was meant to be beautiful, a symbol of a feeling that united men like us, now turned into a weapon. It was that one of the most prominent men in London culture was shouted out of a courtroom with this very word, sent off to a maximum sentence for being “indecent.” That the judge would mock the case itself, mocking the prisoners for wasting his time.
I follow behind Sherlock up the stairs to 221B. Once we get into the sitting room, I check. I always check, every time I’m here for the last six months. Chair’s still there.
he was going to assist them.
he thought. He pulled Sherlock towards him a bit more, pressing their foreheads together, and Sherlock closed his eyes. It would take the slightest movement for them to kiss.
We were on the train to Hatherleigh in Okehampton, Devon, and throughout our entire journey, Holmes had a nervous composition. An apprehensive air surrounded him, and after a few moments of being lost in thought, he would grasp onto my pinkie finger. It was as if I anchored him somehow. I hoped for more signs that all was well in his mind, some verbal response, perhaps. Instead, I simply received a chilled hand against my own.
“Hm?”
Still unmoving, John wondered if he should do…
“I recommend you keep it that way.”
“I admit that I am having trouble understanding why you accepted a mere burglary case so far outside of London. Is that brilliant mind already wavering in your fourth decade?” I teased a bit to hide behind the inquiry of it. He knew my implication.
