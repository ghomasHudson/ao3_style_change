"Well I wish he would. I cant read his mind... I guess technically I can, but I promised myself a long time ago I wouldnt do that to him." Cas said, a little frustrated.
"I kissed him back. For just a minute. Then I freaked out and ran. I went to the bar, and met some chick, we talked for a while, then I kissed her. I couldnt stop thinking about the kiss with Cas though, so I stopped it. And when I looked up, Cas was standing there, just watching me make out with this chick, when he'd just kissed me hours before. I chased after him, but he was gone. I'm such a fucking idiot." Dean got it all out as fast as he could, and looked up at Sam.
Cas awakens to Dean's voice, his hand stroking gently through Cas' hair. He looks around and sees they're parked outside their apartment, so apparently he slept all the way home.
"Clearly it was something really bad if Ca- if he, left, and you're spending days in here drinking yourself to death and" Sam sniffed the air "not showering."
Dean turns to face him, looking right in his eyes. "Did you not get the part I said earlier about someone who doesn't understand your passion not being worth your time? You should've said something. If I hadn't understood, then there'd be no point in continuing this." He points between the two of them. "This is who you are, and I think who you are is pretty damn great."
In an attempt to avoid more unwanted panic, Dean quickly but quietly took the clothes into Cas' room and set them on his bed, returning to his room just as quickly. He then turned the lights out and crawled into his bed under the covers. Laying there, he replayed everything that just happened in his head, until he finally drifted off into a fitful sleep.
Dean, finally not desperate, took his time to explore Cas' mouth. His lips were warm and soft, and only slightly chapped. Dean slid his tongue into Cas' mouth, actually tasting him. He tasted like rain, and honey, and something else sweet. Dean ran his fingers softly through Cas' hair, making a sweet noise come out of his mouth.
Dean reached his right hand forward and placed it on the back of Cas' neck. Then he slowly leaned forward and pressed his lips to Cas'. Each time they'd done this, a shot of electricity had raced through Dean's entire body, and this time was no different. He snaked his left hand around Cas's waist and pulled him flush against himself. He felt Cas relax and lean into it. Dean gently pressed his tongue against Cas' lips, and Cas willingly opened his mouth to accept it.
"Can I order you something I think you'll like? If you don't, I won't be offended, but based off my observations this evening I think you will."
Cas sat there for a minute before standing up. "I need a break" he said to Sam, then turned and walked out of the room.
"No Cas. I think he did it because hes wanted to for a long time, and you leaving finally pushed him to act."
It happens again less than a week later, this time on Monday. Different stop, same man, but this time he's carrying a door. Yes, a fucking door, a door to the front of a house. It's clearly old, the paint peeling, the knob a dull brass.
He'd loved Cas, and he was sure Cas had loved him back, but he figured after enough time had passed Cas would've moved on. He was brilliant, beautiful, and so determined, anybody would've been lucky to have him.
Dean put on his most dazzling smile. This was something he could understand, women. He knew women. He loved women. Though he'd basically given up that one night stand life, he still enjoyed a womans company. "Thanks sweetheart."
The next day, Fern Guy is back, but he's not carrying anything. He gets onto the bus, flashes his pass, and sits down in a regular seat.
? Dean was standing there, staring at him, and he could've asked him to stay. Asked him to talk, tried to explain what happened.
It was several minutes later when Dean returned, which wasn't a surprise as the bar had gotten quite busy by then. A beer and a shot glass were set in front of him, and he looked up into Dean's smiling face.
Dean smiled, and looked up into Cas' face. He stared for a moment before noticing the stoic look, a glint of anger in Cas' eyes.
There's banging for another minute, silence, then Dean sliding in through the door and looking around.
Dean turned the rest of the way around. "I know. I know what it means. I just want to be happy for a few damn minutes Cas."
"Its fine, come in. Coffee should be ready in a minute" Dean said, wrapping his head around what shed just said. Sam left a note. She was wearing Sam's clothes. Dean's many things, but hes not an idiot.
The second day was even harder. Dean stayed in his drunker stupor, curled in his bed, drifting in and out of fitful sleep. When he was awake, he spent the time trying to figure out what the fuck went wrong, and how he really felt.
"You broke my heart. I think I deserve to know why." The tears in his eyes send a crack through Dean's chest. He's right, he deserves to know. He deserves more than that; he deserves everything. As hard as it is to talk about, Dean's just going to have to do it, because it's not fair for Cas to hurt over this when it wasn't his fault, when he did nothing wrong.
Cas sat there, on top of Dean, breathing heavily and staring into his face. "I could've lost you. Again." He whispered.
He really does need the work, as his errands (aka his job searching) that morning had, in fact, not panned out the way he'd hoped.
"Alright. You ready to go?" He asks, standing up. He hears Dean get up behind him and move around the kitchen.
Holy fuck. Cas was an attractive kid, beautiful with his messy hair and glasses, nose always in a book. But this Cas, the one before him, is definitely a man. Hair still a mess, piercing blue eyes still the same, but he is fucking hot with his five o'clock shadow and muscles straining against his button up, spring sun shining behind him like a goddamn beacon.
It's just a date, not a big deal. He used to do this all the time, before life circumstances got in the way. Before he, himself, got in the way. Too many failed attempts, too many assholes, too many dates gone wrong and he became bitter and distant to the whole thing.
Cas turns around slowly. "Hello, Dean." He says, and looks and holy fuck. Dean's tshirt, hands, arms, and face, they all have smears of grease. His pants have a hole in the knee, his hair is fucked, and Cas is pretty sure he's never seen anyone look that hot in his life.
Dean wakes up that morning to loud voices floating down the hall and through his closed door, and his heart clenches at what he knows is Cas' voice.
Dean grunted, feeling himself grow harder in his pants. He realized that Cas' dominance over him was beginning to be a huge turn on, which was new for him.
Dean looked at Cas' face and saw actual worry there. "Hey, I'm good, really. Would I have liked for him not to walk in on us? Yes. But not because I'm ashamed of this. Not at all. It's just not how I really wanted to tell him."
Dean stood there leaning back against the library table, his heart sank into his stomach. Cas was leaving. He'd finally had enough of Dean's bullshit and he was walking away. He could hear Cas' footsteps and knew he was at the bunker stairs.
They haven't had sex in a while. Well, approximately five days, which is quite a while to them. Dean's been having such a hard time this week, and he feels awful for not giving his relationship his full attention.
"What did Claire lie about?" He hears behind him, and turns around to see Cas and Claire standing there.
"I have to run home, I forgot my nail gun. I'll be back." He closes the door without waiting for a response, and Cas still just sits there staring.
"Oh Cas good, can you help me look through these?" He asked, as he set a pile of books onto the map table.
Dean is just sliding the last pancake onto a plate when the girls suddenly grow quiet. He turns around, and Cas is standing in the kitchen doorway, half asleep still, and looking amazing in Dean's sweatpants.
Cas cuts those thoughts off there. The last thing he needs right now is for those kinds of memories to flood his mind before bed. Or at any time at all, really. That's his past. Dean broke his heart, and he can't even think about approaching that again, no matter how long ago it was.
Cas kissed along Dean's jawline until he got to his ear. "Let me make you feel good." He whispered, then continued to kiss down to Dean's neck.
Dean doesn't know how long he stays in his car, in front of his brother's house, sobbing into the steering wheel, but it's dark by the time he looks up. He wipes his face as best he can, grabs his bag, and heads up to the door.
Cas sighs, but Dean can tell he's trying not to smile when he dips his spoon in and takes a bite. He watches as Cas contemplates, then shrugs. "It's alright." He says after a minute.
He can't actually see the man's personal area, luckily blocked by the seat back in front of him, but it's clear even more now as the man's hand speeds up as he watches Dean.
Dean reaches up and wipes away an escaped tear. He looks away for a minute, and when his eyes find Cas' again he can see determination in them.
Setting the box down, Cas turns to his daughter. "You really need to put this stuff away. That's what you're doing tomorrow." He says. When Claire tries to argue, he holds up a hand "no, it's been four days and you've done nothing to get settled."
Cas is getting close, fast. It's been so long, and Dean feels so good around him. He drops to his forearm and takes Dean's cock in his other hand, pumping it in time with his thrusts. They're staring into each others eyes, foreheads almost touching, lips grazing, breaths mingling. It's the most intimate sex he's probably ever had, and it's incredible.
Cas is clinging to Dean, fingernails digging into his back as his orgasm draws closer, arousal and pleasure swirling through him, clenching in his stomach, sweat dripping down his neck. He's holding Dean as close as they can get, his stomach sliding along Cas' cock on each thrust, giving just a small bit of pressure. Dean's angle is just right, the head of his cock passing against his prostate each time, and he's so fucking close.
His childhood sucked, teenage years even worse, and he can relate well to what Claire said about the highschool being hell. There was one bright spot in all of that, and even now all that thought does is bring a dull ache to his chest.
Dean smiled "maybe I should almost die more often, if this is the result." He let out a small chuckle.
Smiling at Cas one last time, he said "goodnight" and hurried from the room, down the hall, and into his room, closing the door behind him.
Dean's hands were everywhere, grabbing and scratching and pulling as Cas slammed into him. Dean was almost chanting his name Cas, Cas, Cas, mixed in with what sounded like please and finally.
Dean tugged at the hem of Cas' shirt, and Cas pulled back long enough to pull it off and do the same to Dean's. He slotted their mouths back together, and turned Dean around, walking them toward the bed. He laid Dean down on his back, and as Dean scooted up in the bed, Cas crawled over him, draping his body over Dean's. Cas' sense were overloaded. Smell, taste, feel; everything was Dean.
He makes his way down the stairs and is halfway to his car, stupid chicken following, when he hears the door open. "Dean, wait!"
Dean pulled back the blanket on the bed and climbed in, motioning for Cas to follow. His heart pounded as he watched Cas slide in next to him. 'Cas is in my bed' just kept repeating in his head.
Cas plunged his mouth down a few more times, grabbing the base of Dean's cock with his hand and squeezing.
They ate in relative silence, just enjoying the morning meal. Dean looked at Sam, and watched him eat a piece of bacon. An actual piece of pork bacon, not some fake turkey crap, fried in it's own fat and dripping with grease. Hmm maybe this was turning out to be a good pairing afterall, if she could get him to lay off so much healthy shit.
Cas let himself bask in it for a moment before the events leading up to this hit him, and he pulled out of Dean's grasp, taking a step back. "You're here with Anna." He blurted out.
Cas sits at the kitchen table staring at the stack of papers in front of him. The words blurred, ink smudged from the tears dripping onto the pages.
"I thought you'd want to get back to your party, I didn't mean to make it seem like you weren't welcome to stay." Cas says.
Several hours later, Dean opened his eyes. It was fairly dark but he knew he wasnt in his room, and he could feel someone breathing beneath him.
"I find I quite enjoyed them. The way humans perceive magic is quite entertaining to me" Cas smiled, sitting down on the other end of the couch.
Cas feels hurt, and a little bit angry at Dean, but mostly angry at himself. He swipes away unwanted tears and goes to the fridge, pulling things out. Eggs from the chickens, bacon that he's pretty sure Dean bought a while ago but hasn't gone bad yet, and bread which has a few days left until it spoils.
He's wanted to comfort Cas since he sat down, wanted to hold him or touch him in some way, but he's pretty sure the only reason Cas allowed it before was that he was mid panic attack and needed something to hold onto.
Dean pulled his mouth off, and grabbed the base of Cas' cock with his hand, pumping softly up and down a couple of times, while he kissed his thighs and his hips again.
Dean hit play on the remote, and the intro music started playing. Dean cast a sideways glance at Cas, sitting straight on the couch, legs down to the floor, looking so not relaxed.
Dean drew in a sharp breath as the cool air hit his hard member, immediately warmed by Cas pressing his own clothed hardness against him.
As Dean pulled away from the Bunker, he shook his head. He was an idiot. If hed just asked Cas to come, he would have. He could be feeling Cas hands on his body right now. But no, he couldn't just ask.
Cas' face splits into a brilliant nose crinkling teeth showing smile, and Dean's stomach flutters. He leans forward and pulls Cas into a kiss, pouring all the love and gratefulness he feels into it. Pulling back, he says "thank you" and they stand there holding each other for a minute.
, letting out a low groan. He wants it, wants Cas, but this is their first date and he doesn't want to fuck it up. He doesn't want this to start like every other time, quickly jumping into bed, hot and heavy only to fizzle out just as fast as it started. He wants this to last, he knows, because Cas is something special, he can feel it. So he keeps his hands in Cas' hair, fingers carding through the thick strands.
Once Cas is gone, Dean looks around again. The house is cozy, soft lighting, the sun flowing in through the floor to ceiling windows all along the back of the house. There's a fireplace set into the wall in the livingroom, bookshelves surrounding it.
Once outside, Dean sucks in the chilly fall air, filling his lungs and cooling his body. Cas still has ahold of his hand, and pulls him around the side of the building before stopping and turning to him.
Charlie contemplates for a moment, then gets right to the root of it, in true Charlie fashion. "What did you talk about today?"
"It's alright, it's just embarrassing really." Cas says with a self deprecating laugh. "We were in my room, and I couldn't... Nothing was working. I had to use memories, and I was on enough shit that it worked, and isn't that just sad?" Cas drops his hands back to the table and looks out the window. "Afterward, she wouldn't talk to me. She was pissed."
"That's because I'm an idiot." Dean said, giving a small smile. When Cas didnt smile back, he continued. "I wasnt trying to leave you when you'd just gotten back. Well, I was but... What I mean is..." Deep breath. "I dont know how to do this." He finished.
Cas' eyes snap open and he turns in Dean's arms. He can see the open vulnerability in Dean's face, the love shining in his eyes, and it is so magnificent, so heartwarming.
"Shuddup" Dean says, but he can't wipe the smile off his face. He pulls out his wallet and hands Charlie his credit card while yelling for Emma and Claire to come downstairs.
Dean does all the talking to the receptionist, and Cas just stands there feeling useless and guilty. They take Lunch right to the back, and then he has Dean's arms around him.
He can feel Cas hard behind him, rutting against his ass, and he wants him so badly, wants Cas to know how much he wants him. Dean rolls over and pulls Cas on top of him, kissing him deeply, running his hands all over Cas.
When Cas turned back toward him, Dean pulled his body against his own and pressed their lips together. Dean moved his hand up, cupping Cas' face, and slid his tongue into Cas' mouth. He heard Cas moan into the kiss, and used his other hand to pull Cas' body tight against him.
Cas stepped forward, closing the small space between them, as he set his hands on Dean's hips, feeling Dean's other hand move to rest on his upper arm.
"Alright? Just alright? Man, what happened to your taste buds?" Cas is still trying to suppress a smile, and that makes Dean smile. "What the hell are you eating anyway?" He asks, pointing at Cas' dish with his spoon. It's a light almost grayish brown with flecks of black in it.
Dean watches in his mirror as the guy gets it down to one of the benches that face sideways. He sits down, pulls the plant against him, tucking it between his thighs, and then just sits there.
When Cas opened his eyes, he could see the panic written all over Dean's face. "Dean, I-" he started.
Cas stood there staring at Dean for what felt like an eternity. Dean was breathing hard, his pulse pounding in his ears the only noise in the room.
He gingerly picks up the laptop and sets it on his lap, clicking through the open tabs. They're all apartment listings. Dread fills Cas as he realizes that Dean's planning on moving out, and probably soon if he's searching this thoroughly.
He's exhausted. After the emotionally trying lunch, the conversation with Claire, and attempting to get the house in some kind of order the rest of the day, all he wants is to go to bed. But, he said he'd get this done tonight, and it really shouldn't take too long. Claire's upstairs, hopefully unpacking, so he might as well take advantage of the quiet.
He can see a smirk forming on Dean's face, a twinkle in his eye. Dean leans forward until his lips are at Cas' ear, then whispers. "I have a pair on, in case you wanted to confirm that I do, in fact, wear them."
Cas sets his phone down and flops onto the couch, his worries from last night coming back again, plaguing him with thoughts of Dean out with someone else.
"Enthusiasm is good." Cas replies, biting his lip again, and damn if that doesn't draw Dean's attention to his perfect pink lips, makes him want to feel them against his own.
Or, in reality, he's afraid to see him. After the last time, the hug Cas gave him that was so full of warmth and gratitude, Dean's afraid when he sees him again that he won't see any of that, and everything will just be back to the way it was before; when Cas was dating someone else and Dean was nothing more than his daughter's friend's dad, and his boss, essentially.
Cas ran his hands down Dean's sides as Dean attacked his neck again. Gripping his sides, Cas pulled Dean against him as close as he could. He felt like he couldn't catch his breath, and, as an angel, he didnt even need to breathe.
Dean, holding Cas' shoulders against the door, crushed his lips against the other's. Cas kissed back, grabbing onto Dean's bottom lip with his teeth.
Cas is on him the second the door is closed. He's pushed Dean up against it and Cas is pulling at his shirt until he lifts his arms and let's him pull it over his head. He gets the same back, and when their lips meet again their bare chests press together and it feels so damn good.
"He said you were bad. That you wouldnt get out of bed, you were constantly drunk, and that you threw a glass at him." Cas answered.
Once Dean had finished with the rest of Cas' skin, he crawled back up and slowly kissed him. "You are so beautiful" he said.
Cas tightens his hand, thumbing at the head of Dean's cock, collecting precum. Dean flicks his wrist as it comes up and he feels Cas stiffen above him, a guttural groan tearing out with Dean's name as Cas spills all over their hands. With the extra slick from Cas' release, Dean's hand slides over them easily, jacking Cas' through his orgasm, pulling himself over the edge after only a few more strokes. His orgasm hits like a tidal wave, washing over his body, pleasure coursing through him. He works them through the aftershocks, then finally releases their spent dicks when Cas shivers in overstimulation.
Cas washes his hands and ushers Heather out of the workshop, locking it up behind him. He heads inside, pulling his phone out as he goes, and sees a message from Dean.
Once they're both inside, and the car is started, Dean turns toward Cas. "So, you live near the stop you usually get off at?" He asks.
They entered the building and approached the ticket window. When the woman motioned for them to approach, Cas took out his phone. "I already got tickets" he told Dean, as she scanned the picture hed pulled up.
Cas doesn't know why he let's himself hold Dean's hand, be comforted by him, but he needs it right now so he let's it happen. It feels nice, having someone there in a situation like this, when he's so used to doing everything alone.
Dean watched as Cas opened the bottle and squirted a bit onto his fingers, rubbing it around. Cas leaned over him, pressing their lips together as he slowly circled Dean's hole with his finger and gently pushed in.
"You know? You know. Okay so that makes it all better." Cas said, voice still filled with anger, though Dean could hear it faltering just a bit.
Dean stops the bus in the parking lot. "I'm gonna drop you here, because they'll have a fit if someone's with me when I pull in. That's my car, the black Impala" Dean says, pointing toward it. "Just wait there for me, I shouldn't be more than ten minutes."
Dean feels disheartened at this, but he understands. Cas probably has shit to do. "Alright, let me throw some shoes on and I can drive you."
"Because I didn't think it mattered. How did you even find out?" Sam asks, and he can hear the kids in the background and Sam moving into another room for quiet.
Dean settled back against Cas' leg. He was suddenly nervous, though he wasnt sure why, as hed been fine through the entire last movie. He was now extremely aware of every point on his body that was touching some part of Cas.
Taking solace in Cas' body, he gives himself over. Cas opens him up slowly and thoroughly before pushing in, filling Dean's body and soul. He needs this, needs Cas, and needs Cas to know that.
He gets out the door and into the garage okay, and settles Claire in the backseat but she can't sit up, so he lays her down and covers her with the blanket that Emma hands him. She also hands over one of his hoodies, and he's thankful because it's a chilly night, so he slips it on then slides in behind the wheel while Emma climbs in the passenger side.
It's not long later that Dean's ears pick up what the men are saying, and it's not pleasant. The words are crude and sexual, directed at the woman they've surrounded, and Dean can feel himself start to shake in rage. They're taunting her, explicit scenarios spilling from their mouths.
"It wasn't your fault. Guys like that, they're overbearing and entitled and rude, and they walk all over anybody in their way. Unfortunately, I'm quite versed in that kind of man, and I've been in your situation before." Cas huffs. "You handled it better than I did, and I think its noble that you stood up for what you believe."
Tears are gathering in Cas' eyes, and he can't stop them. He tries to subtly wipe them away, but Dean looks up at him and concern covers his face. "Sweetheart" his tone is so loving.
The second their lips meet, it's like coming home. A warmth rushes through Cas, happiness singing in his veins.
Dean glances up at Cas, who's eyes are half lidded, mouth open just a little staring back down at him. Dean takes the head of Cas' cock into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the head and dipping it into the slit, and Cas lets out a strangled groan, fingers digging into Dean's shoulders.
He finishes the entire tub, no judgement, it was only half full anyway, and throws it away before flopping back on the couch and turning on the tv to whatever's playing on the syfy channel.
Dean wakes with a nervous giddy excitement roiling in his stomach that he hasn't felt in a long time.
Dean pops off to get a breath, and Cas hauls him up, crashing their mouths together, tasting his precome on Dean's tongue, and Dean rubs his cock along Cas' thigh, needing some sort of relief, releasing a choked sound at the friction. Cas holds him tight and flips them over, straddling Dean's hips and lining their lengths up as he leans down and sucks on Dean's bottom lip, plunging his tongue back into his mouth.
"I'm not trying to cancel, I just need a minute. Or maybe ten." Cas says, stopping a few feet away. "I'm sorry, I lost track of time. Please don't leave."
Dean sighs, not really wanting to get into this right now, but knowing she won't give up easily. She's as stubborn as he is. "It was."
Dean turned the corner into the kitchen, and there Cas was, sitting at the table with his back to Dean.
As he pulled on his last piece of clothing, and continued to attempt to control his breathing, he heard Cas behind him say "Dean" quietly.
Dean just stood there for a minute, digesting everything Cas had said. His heart was beating so hard he was sure Cas could hear it. He closed his eyes, and when he opened them he looked into the depths of Cas' blue eyes. "Did you mean what you said?"
As he raced down the road, he couldnt stop the thoughts from crowding his head. Cas kissed me. I kissed Cas back. What the fuck, why did I kiss him back? Of course I kissed him back, what else was I gonna do? Um how about not kissing him back, there's an option. But I wanted to kiss him. What? No. Yes. No. God damnit all to hell.
Cas looks at Dean for backup, but Dean just continues to eat his burger, not even looking up or acknowledging their conversation.
Cas kisses down his neck to his chest, sucking a pert nipple into his mouth and gently biting it. Dean's back arches below him, and he feels fingers in his hair, unintelligible words and noises spilling from Dean's lips. He slides across, giving the same treatment to the other nipple, before moving further down.
Cas growls against his neck and bites down as hot liquid spreads between Dean's thighs. That's all he needs, orgasm crashing through him as he moans out Cas' name, dick pulsing, come spilling out over Cas' hand, dripping down onto the bed.
They prepare the food, all working around each other in the kitchen, joking and laughing and playing, and it's perfect. When Dean goes outside to grill, Cas finishes up inside with the girls, and they're all sitting down at the patio table on the deck as the sun is going down behind the trees.
"I dont know what this is. But I cant stop it. I have no control over it" Cas said, looking back down at his hands in Deans.
He climbed out of bed, and started to make his way to the door, when he saw it quietly open. Dean stopped halfway there, and watched Cas sneak back in.
Courtney sopped the remaining syrup off her plate with her last piece of pancake, and popped it into her mouth. Swallowing, she said "damn that was good. Thanks, I needed it."
Once inside the offices, he's made to wait in the starch white waiting room for a solid fifteen minutes before he's called into Naomi's office.
Looking down into Cas' face and seeing the exhausted joy behind his eyes, Dean smiled. "You're amazing."
"No. I have to be here. She's my best friend dad. You wouldn't leave your best friend alone at the hospital, would you?" She says. Her stare is so intense he's taken aback.
"What about your dad?" He's hesitant to ask, with how shitty a father he had been, but he's curious.
They finally pulled into the lot of a large white building, and Dean looked at the sign as he parked. "The museum?" He asked, turning the car off and looking around. He wasnt into the whole art thing, but Cas had planned this so he would at least pretend to enjoy it.
"I don't want to hurt your car. I dont need an angel blade in me before the rest of our date." Cas smirked, which made Dean smile more.
"When I was nineteen, I got married to a woman named Lydia. That, in itself, is a complicated mess." Dean looks off into the distance, like hes remembering. "Anyway, not long after that, she got pregnant. It wasn't on purpose, but I'd always wanted kids, so I was happy. Turns out, Lydia was not. She wanted to get rid of it, but I convinced her not to."
He wants to ask what happened, why he left, why he didn't say anything. He wants to know so badly, the words are on the tip of his tongue. But the moment passes, and Cas just doesn't have the nerve to ask. To know why the man he loved left him without even a note.
"I know. I know you'd never do anything to intentionally hurt him, but you did. And it's gonna take some time for him to process it."
Claire holds up her hands in surrender. "Okay, I'm sorry for lying, but come on, it all worked out."
He makes his way to the door, a scathing remark about minding his own business on the tip of his tongue that gets cut off as soon as the door is open.
He has about a million other questions he wants to ask, but he won't. He can't bring himself to do it, because he knows he wouldn't get any answers anyway. She's loyal to Dean, and that's admirable, but he wants to know.
"Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. Just my date from last night? He texted saying I'll regret what I did. Asshole can't take a hint." Dean replies, dropping the phone back to the floor. "I'm not worried about it." He snuggles back into Cas, and feels Cas' arm relax around him.
Cas discreetly moved his left hand off the table, and set it on his own left thigh. He saw out of the corner of his eye that Dean's interest was piqued.
It's a Thursday night and Dean is working later than usual, taking the last routes of the day to cover for a friend who has a date. It's been a boring, as usual, day and Dean is very much looking forward to finishing the shift and having the next few days off.
He watches as she pulls her usual sarcastic expression over her face. "Yeah, I'm great." She says. "Sorry it took so long, we got caught up talking about our project."
Getting the clock back up the aisle isn't as hard as some other items he's had to do this with, but it's not that simple either. Luckily, the people on the bus today are nice and make sure their feet and items are out of the way, and he gets it off without any problems. Once he's on the ground he looks up at Dean.
"Cas" Dean breathes out, voice shakey, and finally, finally opens his eyes and Cas can see the beautiful brilliant green shining. "Hey" he says quietly.
The girls are talking Charlie's ear off, and Dean is looking at him with something unreadable, and he just wants to go home.
Cas fell to his knees next to him "please dont let me be too late." Cas pressed his fingers to Dean's head. It took a few moments, an excruciating few moments, but Cas saw the hole in Dean's stomach start to heal, pushing the knife out and onto the floor.
They wandered the room for a while, Dean never letting go of Cas' hand. He didnt care what anybody thought of them, two guys, holding hands, checking out cars. He wanted the world to know that Cas was his.
Silence. Deafening silence between them. It's uncomfortable, and Dean wishes he didn't live here so he could run out the door.
"What's wrong?" He looks concerned, but his eyes are blown wide with lust and he's panting and Cas can see that he wants this.
Dean looks at Cas, and Cas' face shows fond exasperation. "She'd told me last night all her homework was done, and it was not so I made her do it before she was allowed to come over. And now she's upset because she's 'late' even though it's only 5:15" Cas says, airquotes and all, and Dean is filled with affectionate nostalgia.
Dean laughed "Yeah, pretty much. He watched as she wandered into the library. "Oh my god!" He heard her shout.
Dean shakes his head, a small smile pulling at his lips. "A story for another time. I'm fine, really."
"Look, I'll tell you this" she says quietly, and Cas holds his breath. "I think you'd understand why he did it. You've just gotta give him time. And push him, but not too hard. I love him, I do, but he's a stubborn ass at times."
Dean was scared, terrified even. It wasnt something he'd ever even considered before Cas. But he knew he wanted it.
Dean smiled, and glanced at Cas. He could see a hint of jealousy in his face, but he was trying to contain it.
"Go ahead and ask." Dean says. When Cas looks up at him, he chuckles. "I can tell when you want to ask me something, so go ahead and ask."
Dean wrapped his arm tighter around Cas, and buried his face as deep as he could. Cas laughed again causing his chest to rise and fall, then leaned his face down and pressed a kiss to Dean's head.
Dean went looking for him, checking the kitchen, even his own bedroom, but no Cas. Dean made his way down the hall to Cas' room. The door was closed, so Dean knocked.
Setting his phone aside, Cas turns the lamp off and slides down in the bed, pulling the sheets over himself. For the second night in a row, he can't banish the thoughts of Dean.
They heard a knock on the livingroom door and broke apart, panting. "Damnit, what?!" Dean growled. 'At least they knocked this time' he thought.
Still not willing to let Dean win whatever game it was he was playing, Cas made no move but to turn the page of the book he was now not even reading. Every fiber of his being was now focused on that one point of contact. Dean's hand growing hotter against him, until it felt like it was on fire.
"Much, thank you. Okay, there's food on the way because I assume if you haven't been showering then you probably haven't been eating," she says, then turns to look him right in the eye. "You really did fuck up, but Dean's your best friend." Cas pushes down the need to cry again, and just nods. "He won't be mad forever, but you're probably gonna have to give him some time. You broke his heart."
Cas pulled back an inch and looked at Dean, before he slid down and started kissing Dean's chest. Kissing and nibbling all over, leaving small bite marks, Cas made his way down. He stopped for a second when he reached the top of Dean's pants, and Dean looked down at him. 'So beautiful' he thought.
It's a nice evening, a little chilly but not cold, stars sparkling through the city lights and fluffy clouds that are crowding the night sky.
Need and want course through him with those words. He's never wanted anything more than he wants Dean in this moment.
"Me too" Cas' breath hitches as Dean takes his nipple into his mouth. "Dean, please. I need more. Need you." Cas grabs Dean's biceps and pulls him up, crashing their mouths back together. He slides his hands down Dean's stomach and pops the button on his jeans, pushing on them to get them down.
"I can see why you'd be worried" Sam said. "But let's try to give him the benefit of the doubt. It seems like he's been good so far."
Dean slows it down, gentle swipes of his tongue, pulls back and lightly nibbles on Cas' bottom lip before pressing another kiss against it. Their lips part, but they're still so close, breaths fast, tasting each others air.
The rest of his shift is uneventful, and Dean makes it back to the station on time. The second he's off his bus though, a woman is standing there as if waiting for him. She looks at him a moment, then says shortly "Naomi would like to see you on her office." And she walks away. Okay then.
Dean nodded. "That's why I told you this time. I wanna be honest with you. I dont want her, but its... nice. To talk to somebody. About things." Dean didnt know if he was making any sense.
"Uh, yeah, sure. You can, um, come in." Dean steps back and Cas enters while Dean closes the door behind him. "Hang on a sec." Dean takes the couple of steps to the stairs and yells up. "Emma!" while trying to keep his stupid betraying voice steady.
Later that night, as Cas is taking off his jeans to change into pajamas, two things fall out of his pocket. The first is the phone number of the guy from the diner, and Cas smiles to himself as he sets it on his dresser.
Cas was both a little annoyed, and a little impressed that Dean would use sexual teasing to get back at him for offering to help Sam.
"We ended up back in my room." Cas puts his head down, and rubs his forehead with his hand, the beginnings of an emotional headache coming on.
"Its not how you think it is" Dean said, reaching out to lay his hand on Cas' shoulder. Cas pulled away, taking a step away from Dean. Dean's heart sank into his stomach. "I fucked up Cas. I'm so sorry."
As Cas pulled out, Courtney leaned forward, resting her chin on the seat between them. "So you guys live in a big house, or something?" She asked.
It's hard to not reach over and touch him, run a hand down his arm or lay it on his leg, especially after having him in his arms all night, but he doesn't. He's not really sure what they are, or what they're actually going to tell the girls, so he just eats his breakfast and keeps his hands to himself, figuring they'll talk about it later.
Cas collapses down on top of him breathless, and Dean brings his arms up around him, holding him in place. He presses a kiss to the top of Cas' head, and they lay like that for a few minutes until they catch their breath.
Cas rolls his hips against Dean, and he can feel how much Cas wants this too. Feels his hard length pressing against his own, and he wants to touch, to feel, to see every inch. He grips Cas sides, pushing him back a little, and Cas whimpers. Dean presses another kiss to Cas' lips, then takes him by the hand and pulls him up the stairs and into his room.
As Dean leaned closer, Cas could taste his sweet breath, a mix of whiskey and pizza and something that was just Dean.
"What're you doing here?" He asks, then clears his throat, leftover sleep making his voice deep and gravelly.
Dean took a deep breath and shook his head slightly. Then he reached around, wrapping his arms around Cas, and pulled him flush against him.
"You're not. You're shaking. You've never done that before." Dean said. He looked around and saw a dirt road surrounded by trees up ahead. He turned down it, driving maybe a mile before he stopped the car.
He enters the number in his phone, then stares at it for a solid five minutes while sitting on his bed, before typing a text out. He then proceeds to delete the text, write another one, and delete that one as well. This should not be that hard. Finally, he just types up something short and to the point, and hits send.
"Winchester" he heard someone growl directly behind him. He whipped around, pulling the demon knife out of his pants where it was tucked. But he wasnt quite fast enough. As he stabbed forward, digging the blade into the man's chest, he felt something pierce his stomach.
"So, what do you guys do?" She asked. Just then, the waitress returned with their food. As she set the plates in front of them, Dean and Cas looked at each other.
"I shouldn't be more than a few hours." He calls out as she slams the door and jogs up the path to the house. "Not that you care" he mumbles to himself.
Dean reached back, grasping Cas' hand in his, and continued to stand defensively in front of him. "No." He said firmly.
Cas stopped for a second, but didnt turn around. He sighed and took another step, foot landing on the first stair.
He looked into Cas' eyes and saw the earnestness there. Suddenly Dean was very aware of Cas underneath him, and something hard poking into his side. "Oh."
Cas is shaking, both from the depleted adrenaline of the attack, and from worry about the chicken. He shrugs, and tries to hold back the tears he can feel gathering in his eyes.
Wordlessly, Dean pulled off Cas' torn shirt, and threw it to the floor, running his hands back over Cas' chest.
By the time the girls come back over, their ice cream is long gone and they've been contentedly talking about anything they can think of, and Dean has forgotten to be mad at Emma for lying to him.
Worry flashes through Gabriel's eyes for a second before he covers it with obviously feigned ignorance. "Who's that?"
They've veered off into a more suburban outcrop of downtown, heading towards the park, and conversion is still flowing freely when Cas becomes distracted. It takes Dean a couple minutes to notice, but Cas has slowed his walk and hasn't said a word in a while.
Cas just sat there for a few more minutes in silence, staring once again at the open book. Sam opened his book back up, resolving to let Cas take it from here.
"We never left." Dean replies, handing over one of the cups of coffee. Cas takes it automatically, and just looks at him like Dean's said he's a time lord and asked him to go for a ride in his tardis.
Dean knew, though. Sam didnt sleep with someone for a one night stand. He wouldnt take that step unless he actually had some sort of feelings.
Cas was stunned, he couldn't move for a second. What was happening? Why was Dean kissing him? After the shock wore off, Cas pressed back, deepening the kiss. He let out a small involuntary moan.
"Do you really have to ask?" Dean smiled. "Yes, Cas. That's was... Probably the most amazing sex I've ever had. In my life."
After they had breakfast, they all made their way into the library, where Sam had clearly already been this morning. Books were strewn about on all the tables.
"Overexcited is an understatement" Cas laughed. "So, you want to take this slow? I'm not sure exactly what that entales. I'm new to this whole thing."
So, in a reverse of last weekend, Dean follows him onto the porch. He says "Cas" and when Cas turns around to look at him from the top of the steps, he says "do you need anything?" And he doesn't know if he means physically, or emotionally, or relatively, but he probably means them all and just wants to give Cas whatever he needs.
"You didn't ask me if I wanted any of that. You just assumed, or thought of the worst case scenario. But you could've just asked. I would've been honest with you. I'm always honest with you."
Realization hit Cas. When he'd figured out Dean had overheard them, he didnt even think about the fact that he'd said he loved him.
"No Sammy. I just want a break." Dean said, swallowing the second glass and setting it down. He shook his head and walked out of the library.
Cas just sat there, the hard on in his pants pulsing with need. He watched Dean take a sip out of his glass, then turn sideways to look at Cas. As Cas could see, Dean was sporting a pretty heavy bulge himself.
"Well, I was just wondering. He's been here for us, and you guys really seem to get along fine, so I was wondering if there was anything there between you, you know, other than what happened in the past?"
"Well then, hell yeah I'd like to go out with you." Dean says, grinning full out now. He can't believe this, after the hell that was this evening, that it could end with him getting a date with the hottest guy he's maybe ever seen.
Dean shrugs. "It's been that way since Em was six months old. It's fine." He goes back to chopping onions and the strangling silence ensues once again.
Cas asks if they need anything else, and Gordon waves his hand in dismissal while picking up his fork and knife. Dean looks to Cas and says "we're good, thank you." And Cas turns to walk away.
Michael means nothing to him. Dean is everything, and Cas doesn't know if Dean will forgive him for this.
Cas looks at him then, expression still blank, eyes distant and unfocused. "Thank you Dean, but I think I just want to go home and sleep. I'll talk to you tomorrow."
Cas bites his lip, and he's shifting around nervously now. "If this is too forward, I apologize, but... I would like to take you out and show you what a good date looks like."
It's too much, so Cas does none of that. He unwraps his sandwich and takes a bite, and it's the best damn breakfast sandwich he's ever had.
Dean's mind wouldnt stop 'Fuck so good. Cas. So hard. I want him. Hot body. Cant stop. Dont stop. Wait. What am I doing. Fuck. This is crazy. This is Cas .'
"Missed you" Dean says against Cas' chest, licking and sucking at Cas' skin. "God Cas, I missed you."
When it seems like Dean isn't going to elaborate, Emma pipes in. "Dad owns a restoration shop, Winchester Restoration, over on Main."
"I'm very sorry sir. I'll discount your meals, and I'll speak to Cas about his attitude. Your wine is on me tonight as well. Would that be satisfactory?"
"Cas, relax a little" Dean whispered, leaning closer to him. He already knew if he made too much noise hed get hell from Sam.
Once he's showered and in bed, he's resolved to put on a happy face at home and act like nothing bad happens at work from now on.
Finally, Dean moves. He's across the threshold, pressing their lips together. Cas makes a surprised sound, startled for a second, before bringing his hands up and gripping Dean, pulling him closer. It's been so long, too long, and he needs this. Needs Dean. He pulls Dean further inside and pushes the door closed, backing Dean up into it.
Suddenly there was a noise, and both jumped apart to look at the doorway, attempting to look casual.
"It's alright, no big deal. You know, you can call me Cas, if you'd like." Cas says, and notices a pleased smile on Dean's face. "We should head out though. You have school, and I have more errands to run tomorrow."
Dean rushed to the kitchen, where he found Sam dumping out the popcorn machine, the smell of burnt popcorn filling his nose.
It starts slow, soft, Cas' lips are warm and wet from the rain, and Cas let's out a pleased noise. Dean wants more, and he gets it pretty quickly. Cas deepens the kiss, pressing harder against Dean, bringing their bodies together until Dean is pressed up against the wall, Cas against him. He runs his hands up Cas' arms and neck, tangling one in his hair, and parts his lips a little. Cas' tongue swipes out against his, and he moans low in his throat, arousal curling in his stomach as Cas grips at his hips.
He stalled as long as he could, but it was pointless. He'd told Dean he would be there, and he would. So, with resignation, he steeled himself and left his apartment.
"Dont be ridiculous. Come on." Dean says, and turns away to head down the hall back to the kitchen. Hes trying really damn hard not to freak out right now, and he doesn't think it's working.
Once they're seated at a patio table, Dean stares Emma down, and she doesn't even look up from her icecream when he asks "what was that?"
The room shook, breaking them apart. Dean looked desperately at Sam for help, but he was busy holding onto Courtney, who looked terrified.
Cas forces a smile, forces himself not to pull away until he needs his hand to eat, forces himself to make conversation. Dates should not be forced, and he's feeling worse and worse about it as the night goes on.
As Dean pulled on his own clothes, he attempted to stop the panic that started creeping into his chest.
He tells Dean that Claire's awake and insisting on seeing them, yes both of them not just Emma, so Dean wakes her and they follow him back to her room.
"Yeah?" Dean looked at him. Cas was making that cute head tilt he always made. "Yeah, Cas. Let's go."
"I, uh-" Dean coughs. Cas looks up at him, and Dean's rubbing the back of his neck, his nervous habit. "I have them with me, if you want to compare them to the invoices." Dean says, motioning to the bag still on the table in front of him. He opens it up, and Cas sees a myriad of colorful cloth nestled in the bottom.
Instead, he continues to eat his breakfast, they both do, without saying a word. When Dean's is done, he takes his plate to the sink, rinses it, and sets it into the dishwasher. He says "thanks" without looking at Cas, then goes back outside.
"Though, maybe this is your second chance and you should tell Cas yourself. He would understand, anybody would."
Cas listened. The song seemed familiar, but he didn't actually know the words. He was watching Dean, and Dean was looking at their table.
The rest of the day passed pretty quickly. Dean made himself busy around the bunker with various tasks. He finished washing his bedding, and decided to wash his clothes too, since it seemed like Cas might be wearing them more often, along with the bedding he'd stuffed in the bottom of his closet yesterday. He also cleaned the kitchen and the bathroom.
"Clearly that isn't true, otherwise I'm sure they would've taken more than two point five seconds before offering the jobs." Cas says knowingly. Dean can deny it all day long, but both Bobby and Ellen had all but said they were hiring him based on Dean's word.
"Alright, so" Courtney set her bottle down, and turned more towards Dean. "What exactly are you forgetting tonight?"
Cas shifts on his feet and bites his lips. "It's just a thing. Would you like to help?" Cas asks, walking to the back of the room and picking up a sander.
It's his fault. He should've anticipated something like this, gotten a fence installed or something. He thought he was far enough out from anybody that nothing like this would happen, but he should have. He should've known.
Dean looked over at him and, realizing he was eating a vegetarian pie, said "ugh Sam really? Rabbit food on a pizza? Ridiculous."
Dean stands up too. "Neither do I! And neither do any of the people you treated less than yourself tonight. Lose my fucking number, asshole." He pushes away from the table, chair falling over behind him, and storms out of the restaurant.
Or, it was, until he makes a stop downtown and sees the top of that dark hair behind the crowd loading onto the bus. Everyone else gets on, and when Dean next looks at him he can barely see the man around the... Is that a fern? Yeah, it's a giant potted fern, as tall, if not taller, than the man.
Sam left, and didnt bother him again that day. Dean spent the rest of the day thinking about how bad he fucked up.
In that moment, Dean realized something. All Cas ever wanted was for Dean to feel good, for him to be happy, for him to approve of the things Cas did. He gave up everything for Dean, never thinking about the repercussions for himself. He gave up his family to be by Dean's side.
"Uh, sure. Thanks" Sam replied, furrowing his brow. He wanted to ask Cas if they'd talked yet, but didnt want to call out in front of Dean that Cas had confided in him.
Another bit of time passed before Dean slowly slid his hand up a little, so that it was resting on Cas' thigh now, still continuing to act like hed done nothing. So Cas played along, and made no move to show hed noticed the change.
'Say the words. Just say them. He wont reject you. He'll leave. No he wont. This is Cas. I want him. I need him. I lo- damnit. Say it.' Dean's head was screaming at him now.
As they descended the stairs into the war room, Sam came running up. "What the hell happened? I would've called you but you dropped your phone. Here" Sam tossed Dean's phone to him.
Dean's a little confused, but it's not like this is the first time Cas has asked him to help. Dean started spending time out here with him after he moved in, and it's nice, watching Cas get so lost in his passion. Cas has asked for his help on several occasions, usually just sanding, or nailing, but sometimes more.
Dean's pretty sure he's done talking now, but he doesn't know what to say to that. What he really wants to say is of course he was here, where the hell else would he be? He wants to say that he'd always be here if Cas would let him, because even after seventeen fucking years he's still in love with Cas, loves every single thing about him, and never wants to let go. But, he doesn't say any of that, because that would probably not go over well, so he reaches out and takes Cas' hand, and Cas let's him, and they sit there in silence just holding hands.
Neither are aware of the two girls sitting at the top of the stairs listening, arms around each other and tears in their eyes.
The kids have drawn Emma cards (well, the 4 year old drew a card, and the two year old scribbled all over a piece of paper) but she's pleased with them and makes sure they know how happy she is, then puts them right on the fridge.
Cas picked up his beer, and downed the rest of it. When he set the empty bottle back down, he looked at Dean. "Actually, I think I'm going to-"
Dean looked into Cas' face at that. He felt bad about listening in, but he couldnt help it. Obviously Cas wasnt going to tell him these things. "I didn't mean to at first. Why didnt you just tell me you were worried about this?"
As Dean turned back around, he could feel the liquor finally taking hold in his blood. His head was starting to become fuzzy, and the thoughts of Cas' lips on his began to fade away a bit.
Everything feels so good, his skin burns where Dean's lips touch it, he's being lit up from the inside out, and he loves every minute of it. Dean's fingers speed up, thrusting in and out, stretching him, crooking to pass over his prostate sending increasingly pleasurable zings through him each time. Dean mouths over his cock, and Cas' hips thrust up unintentionally, searching for the heat.
Cas looked down at himself, covered in Dean's blood. Dean could've died. He could be gone, if Cas had been a moment too late. He held his hands out in front of him, looking at the blood all over them, and he started to shake.
"Eh hem" Courtney made a fake coughing noise. "As cute as you guys are, I'm being ignored over here." She said, smirking.
"You don't know that." It's Charlie's turn to sigh. "Look, that was years ago. You're both different people now. Maybe you could, I dunno, try again?"
"Dean, I dont know what you want from me here. You need space, but you dont want me to go. I'm not sure what to do with that." He tried to pull his arm from Dean's hand.
Dean couldnt stop smiling. He reached over and took Cas' hand. 'This, moments like these, that's what makes it all worth it' he thought to himself.
He wants to hug him, and kiss him, god does he want to kiss him, and he wants to make sure Dean knows that this
"I got them from my freezer. I made them, actually. I do that, then freeze them for a quick breakfast when we're running late, which happens, you know, often, with a teenager and a business, and... yeah." Dean seems flustered.
What feels like hours later, Dean is climbing back onto his bus and heading back to the station. He's ready to go home, ice his face, and hug his boyfriend, not necessarily in that order.
it too soon to have that discussion? He loves Cas, can't imagine a future without him, so wouldn't talking about these important things be the next step? Obviously not here, not with this shit going on, but sometime. Right?
"Yeah, can we dad? Emma says his burgers are the best." Claire says, as the girls come into the room. He hadn't even heard them come downstairs.
Dean feels really good, and Cas is great. He can't help wondering what it'd be like to kiss him, if Cas will want that once this night is over. The way Cas keeps looking back at him is making him feel warm all over, making him feel things he hasn't felt in a long time.
Cas sat back on his knees, looking down at the wonder that was Dean's naked body. Raking his eyes from Dean's face, down to his hard cock, and back up again.
"You are absolutely not intruding on anything." Charlie says, linking their arms together and steering him to the swing where she lightly pushes him down onto it before sitting next to him.
"Hello?" He says, assuming it's probably work wanting him to pick up a shift, or maybe Dean checking in.
"The only person worth talking to in the hell they call school around here." Claire replies with snark.
Cas opens his eyes and sees Dean, Emma, and Claire by the front door. "Hey" he croaks, then clears his throat of sleep.
Claire and Emma both look concerned for a second, but it passes quickly, and Dean is handing Emma money and they're heading out the door.
"I'm glad to hear it." Sam turns back to the stove and turns the burner off, and a minute later there's a plate filled with bacon and eggs sitting in front of Dean, and Sam sits down next to him with his own plate. "So, what're you gonna do?"
"I am, if you're amenable." Cas says. "What you said about it being hard to meet people? I know how that is. And I like you. What you did out there" Cas gestures behind Dean. "It was impressive."
"I think I'm going to head out, I just stopped in to see Gabe for a minute. I have a home office to get set up, since I actually have work now." Cas says, and is (annoyingly) pleased to see disappointment on Dean's face.
So, he tells her. He tells her how bad he messed everything up, and that he didn't know how Dean felt, and he wants him back so badly but he doesn't know how to fix it.
As Dean stood there, his body just barely touching Cas', he felt that pull in his chest again. It caused his heartrate to speed up, his breath increasing in pace and intensity.
Cas moves back up Dean, making sure every inch of his clothed body runs over Dean's hard length as he goes. He stops to suck another mark to the other side of Dean's neck, then pulls him back into a searing kiss.
A stab of unwanted jealousy spears through Cas' chest, and he reluctantly climbs out of the truck to follow the girls up the path.
Cas didnt say a word, just continued to wash. By now the dishes were both clean, but he didnt want to move. He was enjoying the closeness.
Emma's at breakfast with them because Claire invited us, but you should've seen his panicked face when she did so I told them I had work to do and sent Emma along. And you should see him. God, he's like Doctor Sexy meets Indiana Jones meets Batman meets Chris Evans all rolled up into the one that got away. Jesus Charlie, what the fuck do I do?"
"Dean" Cas said, trying to get Dean's attention. Dean was pressing kisses, licks, and small bites along Cas' jaw and neck.
"Hey, buddy" Dean says, and the man starts, turning his eyes to Dean. He doesn't stop moving his hand, looking Dean up and down with a salacious grin. "Get off my bus, now" Dean says, trying to keep his anger under control, trying to keep the other passengers from being subjected to this.
Cas sits down, and the girls are just staring at him for a minute before Claire says "good morning, dad" almost like a question.
Slipping the card back into the box, Dean closes it and looks into Cas' eyes. He can see so much love shining there it makes his heart stutter. "Okay." He says, because if Cas believes in him this much, enough to do all this, then he'll give it a shot. He does love it, Cas is right, and it would make him happy.
Cas sat back and popped the lid on the lube, pouringing some over his fingers. Dean opened his legs wider, and Cas leaned down, dragging his fingers along Dean's crack and over his hole softly. Dean's body jerked beneath him, and Cas bit a smile back at how responsive Dean was for him. He use more pressure, and his finger slipped past that tight ring of muscles. Dean groaned as Cas pushed his finger the rest of the way in, working it around to stretch him.
"Uh, so, you've heard things." Cas says. He wonders what she knows. If she just knows about what's happened the last couple days, or if she knows all of it, from so long ago. So, he asks, because she seems like the kind of person to just be straightforward with. "What do you know about me?"
Cas makes his way into the room, and when Dean sees him, he tries to pull away to get up but Cas can see Claire's hand tighten where its gripped in his shirt.
"Ah, yes. Well, the things I've been getting wont fit into my car, and my truck broke down a while back so I figured the bus was the best solution." Cas replies, shifting uncomfortably. "I'm sorry if I've made things hard for you. I can stop, if you'd like."
Dean sat up now, and looked at him. "You know, you dont have to stay here all night doing nothing. I'm sure it gets boring."
"You. All of you. I want you in me. Please." Dean gasped out, as Cas bit down and sucked a mark into Dean's hip.
Cas shakes his head. "No, I'm sorry about everything. I don't care about any of that, I can live without it. I can't live without you." Because he can't. He tried, and it was miserable and lonely and he hated every minute of it. Cas buries his face into Dean's chest, and Dean holds him close, tight against him.
"I made dinner. Let's eat, and maybe we can get your mind off of this, okay?" Cas says. Dean nods, and Cas leads him to the table.
He could feel Cas' hands slide around him as he kissed him back. Dean felt Cas press against him, turn them around, and start moving him backwards, backing him into the table.
Removing the rest of his own clothes, Cas pulls out a bottle of lube and a condom, and kisses Dean again while he lubes up his fingers and rubs them over Dean's hole. Dean pushes down against him, and Cas let's his finger breach the rim, pushing in gently and marveling at how amazing Dean looks like this, flushed and panting and needy.
"Shh" was Dean's response. He then leaned his head down until his lips were against Cas' neck. He felt him shiver again as he pressed a light kiss there.
Once Dean's gathered himself, he talks. "I did hide something from you, but it isn't what you think it is." When Cas scoffs, Dean holds up a hand. "Please, just let me get this out."
Dean's gaze slides to the papers in front of Cas, and his eyes widen. "Are those-" he cuts himself off and swallows roughly. "Are those divorce papers?"
Cas rolls his eyes, but stands up and stretches before walking over to the group at the door. "I'm sorry. You made dinner? You didn't have to do that."
He looks away, because it's always hard to talk about. "After you..." he swallows, gathers himself, and starts again. "After, things were pretty bad. I finished out highschool, but it was a rough time. You know how my family was. I decided to push college back a bit, and worked with my dad in the church. I was living, but not really living, you know? I had pressure from them about everything, not least of all was the insistence to find a 'nice girl to settle down with'." Cas rolls his eyes at that.
Dean could see that Cas was trying to act unattached, but he could see the hurt below the surface of his face. "I made a mistake Cas." He shook his head. "A huge mistake. I shouldn't hav-".
"See. Dad can totally help you." Claire says. Cas stares at her, and she stares back. "Unless your errands worked out today." She says with a knowing look.
Dean's heart drops to his stomach, and he turns away before Cas can see the disappointment in his face. He'd actually thought they might have more together than just sex, but clearly he misread the situation. "Alright then. Well, thanks for last night." Dean says, as he heads back to the counter and mindlessly starts scooping grounds into the coffee maker.
Throughout the movie, Dean found himself adjusting his position slowly, until he was sitting right next to Cas, almost sitting on his feet. Everytime he snuck a look at him, Cas was so engrossed in the movie Dean didnt think he even noticed.
At this point, Cas doesn't know what to do with himself. He'd figured these two 'interviews' would take most of the day, and if they didn't pan out he would hunt around some more. He never expected to be offered two jobs in an hour, plus the one Dean offered him last night. It's a really good feeling, having this off his shoulders.
Dean's stomach flipped. He felt like he'd been waiting to hear those words for so long. He leaned forward and kissed Cas, with everything he had. When he pulled back, he said "I love you too, Cas."
"Gabriel is the reason I moved back here, of all places." Cas supplies, and can almost see Dean mentally shake himself out of his scrutinization.
Cas watches as Dean pulls a small stack of papers out of the bag, sliding them across the table. Moving the divorce papers to the side, Cas takes ahold of Dean's offering and looks down at them.
When she eventually wakes up, he apologizes profusely for not being there, and she tells him it's fine and it's not his fault.
Dean closed his eyes and listened to the beating of Cas' heart against his ear. He could get used to this.
Cas rolled his eyes and sighed to himself. It had been a while. A long while. He'd been purposely avoiding Dean for months, probably close to six months now, in the guise of being too busy, when in reality it was pure self preservation.
"Its Cas. Sam ran out to get food, said he'd bring back pie. Can I come in?" Cas said through the door.
Cas is startled awake, falling off of the couch onto the floor, heart pounding wildly. There's a loud banging coming from the backyard. He looks at the clock, sees it's 6am and wonders what the fuck is happening.
Emma comes into his room, and that automatically wakes him up because he's a single dad and has always had to be on edge ready for anything to happen. He keeps his eyes closed though and listens as she heads further into the room, around the bed, until he feels bed dip on the other side and Emma is curled up next to him. He peeks his eyes open and she's staring at him expectantly.
The entire drive to the hospital Cas is worried, distressed, and guilty. He was on a date and didn't even hear his phone and something happened to Claire. How selfish could he possibly be to not even think something could happen to her.
Once everything is set up, and the chickens are safely in their new pen around their coop (which they are not happy about, since they're used to free run of the yard), he calls the vet's office to make sure he can come pick Lunch up now, then heads out again, in his car this time.
So, he doesn't pretend, but he does let himself have a few more minutes of this closeness before he rouses Cas awake, and watches as he stumbles half asleep down the hall to his room before cleaning up their dinner mess and turning everything off. Dean locks up, brushes his teeth, and falls into his temporary bed, alone, just like every other night.
"I won't" Claire says, and as soon as Cas turns back around she rolls her eyes at him. Dean can't help the chuckle that escapes his lips, as he gets back to making lunch. Teenagers.
Dean moved his thumb around, slowly rubbing a circle into Cas' thigh. It was becoming harder and harder to focus on what he was supposed to be doing, and he could feel his member start to grow just a little hard.
Letting his head fall forward, a couple of tears escape and Cas swipes angrily at them. He can fix this, he has to.
Cas' mind was spinning. This didn't add up. His thoughts flashed to Dean singing on the stage. "But, your song."
Cas pulled back a fraction of an inch and opened his mouth a bit to breathe. Dean took this opportunity to plunge his tongue into Cas mouth.
"Hah, yeah no. It was the worst date I've ever been on. The guy was an asshole, and I ended up yelling at him and storming out." Dean replies, dropping his head back to the pillow and laying back into Cas' heat.
It's silent in the bus, they still have a good ten minutes until they're at the last stop, when all of a sudden Fern Guy says "shit!" and all hell breaks loose.
"Yep. Oh, hey. Dad and I are going to breakfast. You guys wanna come?" Claire asks, and Cas panics. He doesn't think he can deal with any more Dean today.
As Dean pulls out onto the road, he's very tempted to say something. They've never been alone before, and this would be the perfect opportunity. He wars with himself over it. Fern Guy's stop will be his last one of the night, then he can head back to the station.
Later in the evening, after purposely and blatantly ignoring the laptop bag he'd set by the front door on their way in earlier, Cas grabs it.
Cas looked up at Sam again. "I love him Sam. I have for a long time. I will stay by his side as long as he'll let me. But, I will have this fear until Dean realizes what's happening and, figuratively speaking, all hell breaks loose."
Dean spends the next hour setting it up and then helping Emma rearrange her room, so when they're done the entire floor is basically one giant bed. They have a guest room, but he's sure once they get started no ones going to end up actually sleeping until they pass out from sugar overload.
She nods, says she'll be right back, and heads off to the back of the restaurant and through a door.
"Emma's with a friend." Dean replies, then takes another sip of the tea before setting it down and turning to her.
Cas took a deep breath and sighed. Fingers playing with the mug in front of him, Cas steeled himself with the nerve to ask Dean what hed been wondering all night.
"Oh. Good morning." She said, looking embarrassed. "Sam left a note, said he went running, and that youd be sleeping late." She paused, looking down at herself. "I thought I'd make some coffee, but... I see you're already doing that... Well, now that I've sufficiently embarrassed myself." She made to turn around.
As the waitress walked away, Courtney said "What? I order what I like. I hate women who order a salad, then spend the night hungry and wishing they'd just had the damn burger."
"Hey, that's enough." Dean says, staring them down. One of the men laughs harder, and they turn back to the woman who now looks frightened, shoulders hunched in on herself trying to make herself seem smaller. "I said, that's enough. Knock it off or get off my bus." Dean says, holding himself back from approaching them.
"So? I didn't ask for that. I didn't even want her here. She overheard me and Charlie talking about tonight at school, and invited herself. I don't even like her."
Once done, they turned to enter the main part of the building. "This way" Cas said, motioning Dean to follow him.
After a shower, Dean collapses into bed with sore muscles but a pleasant thrum through his body. He feels relaxed and happy for the first time in a while, and he's drifting off before Cas even crawls into bed.
"Come home with me" Dean says, before he can even think about it. Cas pulls his head back a little and stares at him wide eyed. "Or not, that's okay too. I just- You're gorgeous and sweet and perfect and I just... I really want you. But we can take it slow." Dean runs his thumb along Cas' jaw, and Cas leans into the touch. "We can go out tomorrow, and next week, whenever you want. See where this goes, and I'll be here whenever you're ready."
