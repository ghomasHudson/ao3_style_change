John pulled him closer and kissed him. Not a chaste peck, no, nothing like that, but a full assault on the man’s lips. Victor stiffened at first, panicked eyes still open, before relaxing into the kiss. When John’s tongue teased his mouth, he opened it, and the thing morphed into a full-blown snog. John was holding the back of his head, and the doctor poured all the feeling he wanted to share with a different man, nonetheless, into the kiss. Victor’s hands found their way to John’s hips, and he held him firmly as the kiss continued. They heard the door slamming before they both pulled back. Victor’s pupils looked dilated; John could see only a little bit of green and blue on each eye. He looked at the door, and then at John before tutting,
Sherlock just kept staring at the multiple gears and panels, while giving them one of his unusual smiles. John was almost jealous of the machine, almost, because if Sherlock was stating that he believed they knew them, he probably also believed the fact that this people said that they were going to be married. Someday.
"But it is time for me to join Father at the hospital. Thank you, John, for the honour of taking care of dear Libby before you take her back home..."
“No deduction needed. Madame Delcourt recorded a detailed account of her findings in the journal. She also knew who was after her and why. My aunt left it for me, to safe keep. It won’t help us catch the man.”
"My darling Luna, I must apologise, because I sincerely thought you didn't want to know about me. I also waited for an owl from your side."
“Mycroft was clearly lying, Sherlock. He asked me before to keep this from you, you remember the conversation from the day you came back?”
“No. Victor is a man, sometimes, he is very handsome, and everyone is attracted to him, even straight men. I wasn’t the exception. Neither are you. And you are an idiot; you are missing the point. The question is not if you are attracted to men in general, the question is if you are attracted to
Victor gave him a wink and a flirty grin and John couldn’t help but roll his eyes. They went to the room now shared by both him and Sherlock, and Victor looked around while John searched for the book. When he found it, he took off his shirt and vest, picking up his wand. Victor gave his chest a longing look. John laughed.
"Deduction is not magic; it is science, it is observation, as you know John because you at least are experienced in one of them."
"Ha! I thought you might have forgotten the Bond days. That 'muggle actress' is a witch, her name is Victoria Vertro, or she can also be a wizard, depending on her mood. He is not here right now, so I can introduce you to her. You might get to meet him later if he decides to come out. He is famous in the Wizarding World, you see."
John pulled out his wand, pointing it at his friend for the first time. He performed the spell, and he felt good as Sherlock's unfocused eyes seemed to relax when they saw it was him. He looked completely at ease, trusting John had to do the spell, apparently recognising the magical effects. John felt humbled that the man believed in him that much.
"I know you wept the first time you saw a memory of hers Mycroft, but I think John can handle himself."
“This must be a joke from your brother. Time travel? Aliens? And why did he text you? He usually calls!!!”
Victor started jumping up and down, grabbing John’s arm. But the look on Sherlock’s face, smug, like he dared the rest of them to doubt John’s brilliance. That look alone almost melted John into a puddle. He squared his shoulders and straightened his posture.
“Yes, darling? Mac sent me outside. Apparently, Mummy doesn’t approve of my smoking habits in the house.”
Sherlock smiled back at John, that smile that actually reached his eyes, the one that was only for him.
“So basically you are saying we are facing God knows how many Morans inside this tunnel, who armed not with magic but guns?”
“I’m so sorry, Johnny. But I know I speak from everyone in this room, well except Elle perhaps, because she’s going to be so far away and she barely knows you, you can count on us, for anything. I happen to be an excellent babysitter.”
“Brother, we need your help. I need your help. I need a spell that will let me go around in circles without angering father.”
Two black cars were waiting for them outside of the emergency room, no doubt Mycroft was well known there, and they wouldn’t want to risk leaving through magical means. Mycroft and Alissa rode into the first one, leaving the rest of them to cram in the second one. Sherlock got in, John after him, and Victoria got the second window. She yawned and started some mindless chatter about all the times she had been in a hospital before today. John pretended to listen, nodding when it seemed right to do it. His mind was back at the hospital, with his daughter in the NICU. Sherlock looked out the window, ignoring both of them.
“I don’t know the first thing about babies, but you know how fast I learn. You could take my room downstairs, and with some modifications, it can be both bedroom and nursery. I’ll take the room upstairs, and as soon as the baby gets her discharge, everything will be ready for her, and we’ll take her home to Baker Street.”
“And that’s when your intel is a day late. Emilio is no longer the leader of the London nest. The fangers have a new leader, and you are not going to like it. Marie, Myc. It’s strange she didn’t send a messenger for an audience with you.”
“He is in a slaughterhouse on the other side of town. That specific type of dust and the fact that it tastes like dried blood pinpoints his location to three possible spots. We need to divide. Time is of the essence here.”
"Magic is inherited, so yes, she can be a witch. It's less likely since I'm muggle-born and you are a muggle, but she can have magic."
“Charmed bracelets with shield charms. My brothers sell hats like this on the store, not a deflective as this things, though.”
Sally never took her gaze of them until she reached the corridor which presumably lead to the bedroom area. The flat didn’t seem very big, but it was modern and looked comfortable enough. There was a fireplace, with a big painting of a little girl with reddish brown curly hair, green eyes and a happy look on her face. John recognized the picture from Greg’s desk, this was his daughter, Addy. She looked a little like Molly, and he recalled the last thing his sister told him. So Addy was not Greg’s, biologically at least, and she was Molly Hooper’s niece. Molly was Greg’s second, so Sally could only be his third. Harry was right about Sally, she could be a bitch sometimes, but he had trouble imagining mousey Molly Hooper as the fierce werewolf she really was, the werewolf protecting her pack and niece with her own body against intruders. The Molly he saw right there at the door was not someone he would like to cross if he could avoid it. After all, his long years walking this earth had made him a little (not a lot, true) wiser. His musings were soon interrupted by a happy squeal coming from the bedroom area, and soon enough, a little girl that couldn’t be more than ten was coming running their way, clad in a pink sleeping gown, followed by a troubled looking Sally, who clearly was trying to herd her back to her room and failing miserably.
Whatever is wrong with Molly seems to make her tire easily, and they ascend the second set of steps slowly.
“I’m going to take it all away,” John murmurs against his neck, the vibrations of his low rasp making Sherlock shiver, making his cock stir and thicken. “I’m going to wipe away every trace of that bastard. Every inch of your skin, every last place on your body.” He gently pushes Sherlock’s head to the right and brings his lips to the juncture of his shoulder, biting and sucking a mark just below the edge of the black leather. Sherlock hears himself make a choked, desperate noise.
Sherlock reaches into the pocket of his dressing gown and pulls out his collar. The metal hardware jingles as he drops it in John’s lap and waits.
They make their way down the highway at a hair over 65 miles per hour, the passing scenery rapidly shifting from distinctly rough-edged urban to evergreen woodlands, empty for the most part of houses or people. The sun sinks lower behind them, midday brightness giving way to the more burnished yellow-gold of later afternoon.
The man shrugs, but opens the door, allows John to enter. Glass tanks holding snakes of all sizes and colors fill the workshop. Behind the craftsman’s workbench, an elaborately carved wooden rack holds an albino boa constrictor. The snake lifts its head, regards John with cold, glittering black eyes.
Sherlock obeys, making a low, raspy moan as his hips start to move in counterpoint with their joined hands.
The woman laughs with genuine humour. “Oh heavens, no. In fact, I find myself in need of your assistance.”
Sherlock glances up from his work, delicately selects a golden brown blob and pops it into his mouth, chews, swallows.
“Delusional parasitosis,” Sherlock answers, which is partially truthful--one track of his brain is contemplating the fascinating case an old school mate of Lestrade’s sent down from Liverpool. A gruesome murder-suicide of a couple universally described as happy and loving, which turned out to be a fascinatingly tragic saga of a housewife so convinced she was infested with parasites she ended up inadvertently killing her husband and herself with a meat pie spiked with a lethal dose of veterinary insecticide.
Sherlock is deeply sunk into subspace now, all reluctance and shame burned away, and this awareness of what he’s doing to John makes the shivers of pleasure at his own humiliation all the sweeter.
“It’s gorgeous, innit?” John says, and even his voice sounds younger, less weary, his carefully-cultivated accent a bit rough, more rural around the edges.
“I absolutely don’t mind putting in the work,” Sherlock purrs. “Let me take care of everything. You just take it easy. Okay?”
He wraps his arms around Sherlock’s slender waist; they hold each other tightly for a long time, entwined in each other, swaying almost imperceptibly as John weeps, silently, against Sherlock’s warm soft skin.
“Sherlock,” John says, aiming for a neutral, conciliatory tone. “If my being here is making you uncomfortable, I can go upstairs. It’s fine. Really.”
“You taste so good,” John murmurs, shifting attention to the other nipple, teasing it with a wet tongue as his thumb circles and tease at the other nub of spit-slicked flesh.
Jefferson is useful, to be sure, but he most certainly not what anyone would call bright. It is not his fault. He is the way he was made, and despite his dimness he is one of Jim’s tribe, one of his brothers, and Jim cares for him despite how frustrating his limitations can be.
“Not arrested, no,” Greg answers, still looking from Mary back to the two of them as if trying to process the information his eyes are giving him. “Taken in for questioning.”
“Hey, no.” Jim cups a warm hand around the back of his head, kisses his forehead, his cheek. “No, we won’t. Okay? Sebastian. We won’t.”
And in the space of a breath, Sherlock's congenial facade drops away. His pale eyes glitter, hard and cool as moonstones as he speaks.
“But Jesus, I’m only human,” John grumbles to no one as he walks down the pavement, eyes on his feet, his breath puffy clouds in the chill night air.
“It should,” Sherlock says. “Only the starter is electric.” He turns away from John, opens the oven door, feels the heat as he sees the blue flame. “Yes, still lit.” He closes the oven door, straightens. “The gas furnace, however, won’t work in a power outage.”
He observes John and the baby with overt fascination while inhaling three of the pastries in a row, adrenaline and success stoking his appetite.
Sherlock begins to moan, low choked gasps gradually becoming heedless animal cries as his body responds instinctively, pushing back against John’s movements, seeking more pressure, more fullness as he thrusts down against the push of John’s fingers then pressing up into the heat and friction of his skilled mouth. John can feel Sherlock’s muscles tightening, the tension in his body spiraling higher as his climax approaches.
“Well, you did a lot of things. I knew you were special since the beginning, I told you. Oh, she is going to be something. I wonder if she is going to be a Gryffindor like Ollie and you. Maybe she is going to be a Hufflepuff.”
“Mycroft. What was Greg Lestrade doing at the scene today? With all his team? Surely this was a matter for the Shadow World.”
"Let's ask for a different Department. No doubt Mycroft might have seen us through the CCTV, but if he has immersed himself in some magical affairs, he might ignore his muggle surveillance for a while."
John couldn’t give an answer to that, so he accepted a pair of latex gloves from Sherlock as he started to pick the pieces and throw them in.
He emphasized on the p, while he continued to work on Victor’s legs now. They started hearing movement more rooted in the tunnel, and Victor transfigured a rock into a big glass wall, effectively shielding them from whatever was dormant within. If getting in was proving to be a nightmare, John didn’t want to imagine what lay ahead.
John felt her tears on his clothing, and she placed his hands on her back. The orderlies that carried Sherlock left them alone, and John opened the bag, touched the detective and the man just sat upright, clearly alive. He looked at John in surprise.
"Of course. I was evident for me that would be the arrangement; I told my brother the first time he suggested this course of action."
“So, your sister is a very powerful warlock. So are you, and you started using your magic again, so you have stopped aging. In fact, I see your aging process is actually reversing itself. Do warlocks age until certain age?”
"Well, you'll be seeing the man himself soon enough. He was delighted when he was asked to join the team."
And she stood next to Mary, waiting for her permission before grabbing her arm. Mary seemed to relax when she was standing next to her, and John wondered what was it about that woman that made him feel so lightheaded.
Mycroft cleared his throat and opened the door. The rest just followed him out of the room. Alissa just had a vision, and she almost collapsed into Harry’s arms. Mycroft walked to his wife, concerned look on his face, before she opened her eyes, fear eclipsing her beautiful features.
“Yes, Dora was like family. My father mentored her for a while, you know? He was a good friend of Alastor Moody, God rest his creepy soul, and he helped Dora fine-tune her abilities back then. I’ve advanced things a little by mixing it up with transfiguration. How much does young Ted like the subject? Because I remember Dora was brilliant but clumsy.”
She took out her wand and started chanting like the last time John saw her inside the pensieve. She walked around the room, looked out the window, and then stopped. She looked at John, pained look on her face.
He was livid with anger. He wanted to punch someone, hell, kill someone. His wife, the assassin, left his baby. Because he didn’t care that she abandoned him, not after all the lies and deceit they both inflicted on each other. He cared that his beautiful baby, less than a day old, will apparently grow up without a mother. Soon that dawned on him. He was a single dad. He felt he was bound to be a crappy father anyway, but now doing it all on his own? He opened and closed his left hand before he sat down back again.
John remembered some snips of Hermione’s written account of Harry’s part in the Wizarding War, he thought there was something important about that particular memory that was terrible for Harry, but he couldn’t remember. Sherlock looked at the doors.
Victor managed to look offended, then started browsing through the books, before grabbing one and placing it in John’s hands.
“Yes, I remember him, a Hufflepuff through and through that guy. He looked a little like Oliver. How is your brother these days?”
“I’m so sorry, my friend. I’m sorry you had to face this alone. I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you, to protect you from whoever did this. You were always a thinker, a philosopher, but never a fighter. I’m going to find them, and it would be their turn to be sorry.”
“Really? So close? I thought it was further away in the family tree. No wonder the bullet to the head.”
John tried to keep the bile from rising when she used the possessive ‘our’ for Sherlock. But then he realized that the Sherlock they knew was married to him. Could that even be possible?
John is smiling at him, but it’s not a kind or loving smile. It’s a fierce, hard smile full of terrifying promise, a smile that says volumes. It says
John feels simultaneously annoyed, jealous and just a bit grudgingly protective. He makes a sour face. “Wiggins went with Sherlock to help him. Close ties to the homeless community and all that. Apparently, I don’t
His captors are clearly aware that intellect is Sherlock’s most formidable weapon; in between interrogation sessions, they inject him with powerful tranquilizers before shoving him back into his cell. His brain numb and blank, Sherlock spends the hours floating in a drugged haze, long stretches of fuzzy grey nothing interspersed with strange, blurry impressions of touch and movement.
John laughs, self-deprecating. “God, I’m just irresistible like this, I bet. Sexiest invalid in town.”
When their private pastimes involve the more ornate and ritualised trappings of BDSM, Sherlock knows he still holds the majority of control over their exchange of power. But in the sessions when John decides Sherlock is in need of the belt, there is no doubt at all over who is in control of the situation, on every level and in every detail. And it’s not Sherlock.
“Mycroft,” John finally says, after regaining a measure of calm. “Look. I don’t want to look at a bunch of paper. What I want is...what
The guilt for losing his patience with Sherlock sets in almost immediately, but on the heels of that is a spike of annoyed, helpless frustration.
“It means,” replies Sherlock, “that there may be a connection with the Chinese counterfeiting network we uncovered five months ago. I need to look at the plates again and check for two distinctive identifying marks. All of this I explained to you an hour ago, if you had been capable of paying attention for all of ten seconds.”
“Come on,” John says, not unkindly. “We’ll go back to the hotel, talk it out. You’ll figure out a different approach. You always do.”
John wakes alone in his bed to find he’s already touching himself, hand shoved in his pants, wrapped around his throbbing prick. He realises there’s no one here now, no one he needs to lie to, to hide from, so he gives in and slides his pants down under his hips to free his straining cock. He spits in his palm before taking himself in hand again and pulling roughly, thumbing across the tip as he cups his balls with the other hand. His mind is still half in dreamspace, hearing the echoes of Sherlock’s needy, breathy moans in his mind, still feeling the weight of his long lean body, miles of skin pressed up against his own.
--had owed a certain dowager countess, so he settles for a small shrug of feigned indifference. The movement shoots pain through his body despite the morphine drip, making him wince and gasp a deep breath.
“I don’t either,” Sherlock grumbles, voice muffled against the sofa cushion. “As I told you several times, I was
Neat rows of wooden clothespins festooned each side of Sherlock’s trembling body, trailing down his torso and along his thighs, framing the stiff, flushed cock that jutted straight out from between his thighs, bobbing a bit with each trembling breath he took. The silver buckles on his collar gleamed in the low lamplight. His hair was disheveled and damp with sweat, and his breathing was coming in tiny, hitching gasps as tears trickled down his face below the rough black fabric that covered his eyes.
True sleepiness is beginning to pull John under; he closes his eyes, letting familiar natterings regarding shortcrust pastry cover him like a warm English blanket. He’s not really sleeping, not yet; worries about his daughter and their future are still trying to steal into his thoughts, but a soft cotton wool batting is wrapping around his mind, keeping all the unpleasantness at bay, he feels comfortable and drowsy and safe and --
(Underneath the hazy fog that makes it so hard to concentrate, John marvels again at how changed a man Sherlock is, and then wonders if he is really so different, or if the events of the past three years simply wore away at the cold uncaring façade until the true man underneath finally was able to emerge. He doesn’t really know the answer, and is starting to suspect that perhaps, in the end he never will.)
John curses under his breath as he moves to the window. The rain has stopped; he watches Sherlock leave the building, coat swirling gracefully about this his slender frame as he disappears around the corner, out of sight.
The two spend a long moment looking at each other, their gazes mutually heated and searching, and John wonders briefly if Sherlock might make good on his request tonight, despite his words to the contrary just minutes earlier.
He loves it, all of it, and now that he knows he can have all of that not with a passing acquaintance or a near-stranger he will never see again but with someone he loves desperately, with his whole heart--that realisation overwhelms him, a wave of searing desire crashing through John’s body as he worships Sherlock’s cock, wrapping his fingers around the base as he sucks hard, hollowing his cheeks with each bob of his head, then pulling back and swirling his tongue around the head before taking him in again, as deep as he can, nose pressed into dark wet hair as he swallows around his shaft, pushing down his gag reflex, working him with the muscles of his throat, making him shudder and groan in wordless pleasure.
“I want to -- You should know that -- ” Sherlock shakes his head. What seemed so perfectly clear just a few moments before, when he was under the influence of a cascade of mind-scrambling sex chemicals, is now more complicated, and so much harder to explain.
The pair hang up their coats on the hooks downstairs; Sherlock slips ahead of him, taking the steps with increasingly unrestrained urgency. John lets him, willing to linger a bit, all the better to take in the view of his long legs and obscenely plump and perfect arse in motion.
“Needs more sugar,” he rumbles sleepily, passing the mug back to John. “Now what I would like is you to find the duvet and lie down with me.”
“I really thought,” he begins, haltingly and John sees a single tear shining at the inner corner of his eye. “I really thought...John, you don’t know -- I’ve never been so afraid in my life. I was so sure you were going to die, and I couldn’t stop it, I couldn't do anything, and I --”
John pulls his jacket tighter around himself--it’s almost spring, but there’s still a chilly bite to the air- and turns to leave even as he wonders why he’s fighting against what he wants so very hard, what exactly it is he’s trying to prove here.
John doesn’t even take a moment to consider Sherlock’s last words; trap or no, he would not, could not ever willingly abandon Sherlock again, no matter the cost.
“You’re so beautiful,” John says quietly, hands cradling his slim hips, thumbs rubbing against the ridges of his iliac crest. “Do you know that?”
“Yes,” John admits without dissembling. “I do. And it’s a liability, it makes me far too close to this to function effectively. I’m not his doctor, not really. I’m his---well, I don’t exactly know what I am to him, right at this moment. But I do know I’m absolutely not equipped to deal with this.”
Despite the alcohol and benzos he still dreams; disjointed visions of gunfire screaming falling and blood soaked curls and dead bodies in desert sand, images of chaos and violence that he can’t really remember after waking, though tears still stream down his face.
Within moments John has reacquainted himself with the basics of fellatio, settling into a slow, steady rhythm, gentle, nothing fancy or complicated, a straightforward ebbing and flowing tide meant to carry him to his climax without teasing or frustrating him.
“Mr Lee,” Sherlock says evenly. “I see you found something more profitable than murdering teenage pop starlets.”
He’s seen that face before. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out Jefferson’s photographs, carefully studies the image of the sad-eyed woman reclining across a cheap hotel bedspread.
“You heard what Lee said. He’s angry at the damage I’ve done. He takes it personally. Whoever this person is, he didn’t come to be James Moriarty by letting bygones be bygones. No, he’s going to come after us. Not me, but us. What we have is the most important thing in the world to me, and that makes it my greatest liability.”
As Sherlock holds him, John lets his words wash over him, through him, a gentle wave of simple, utter honesty.
“And you’re a bit danger-prone, and I’m much more concerned about your well being than the NHS missing ten quid worth of plaster and gauze,” replies John. “Besides, I’m not in their employ any longer so they can piss right off.”
“I wonder if I can determine which hive she came from,” Sherlock muses aloud. “Did you know there are almost six thousand managed hives in the city of London?”
“No, you can’t. You can’t even help yourself, though you don’t know it yet.” Lee grins, and it’s a gruesome vision, a death’s head. “Goodbye, Mr Holmes. Tell Jim Moriarty I’ll see him in Hell.”
“You’re right. That wasn’t nice of me.” In a show of slightly over-exaggerated contrition, John stretches upwards to kiss Sherlock’s pouting lips, his stubbled cheek, the tip of his erudite nose. “How about this: All we have on our agenda right this moment is to hurry up and wait for a phone call, right?”
“All done now, it’s finished, you’re all done. Shh.” John fumbled the blindfold from his eyes and reached down between Sherlock’s legs, working the plug loose. Sherlock gasped and shuddered as the slicked glass pulled free from his body.
Before this, before the two of them, Sherlock would have stayed up the entire night, dissecting mouse livers or finding something to roast with his blowtorch--seemingly desperate for anything to distract himself from the constantly swirling maelstrom of just being him, of thinking, of analysing, of processing the endless streams of data that he could never seem to disregard.
"I felt guilty when you fell. I could have stopped it, you see, but I never carry my wand with me anymore. It felt like my parents all over again. Magic failed me, or I failed magic, I failed you, and you killed yourself. I wasn't enough to save you, and I thought many times when you left that maybe if you knew I was a wizard, we could have used my magic to get you out of whatever Moriarty had planned. I thought me keeping" my feelings, John thought, but said instead "that fact to myself contributed to your death."
“I’ve meant to tell you; my godson wants to meet you. He is one of the few metamorphmagi left in Britain, and he wants to meet another one, with experience, like yourself. You remember his mother?”
John started laughing again, and Sherlock looked at him and smiled. Then his face changed, morphed to the sour look he reserved for his brother only.
Victor's eyes came back to focus, his green eye turning into an alarming shade of orange, like a cat.
"You are right. It doesn't. But she was very knowable in the Dark Arts and kept some valuable artefacts in her collection. It might have been a burglary all along."
The woman looked pleased, satisfied, she was clinging to her husband's arm, but if you paid further notice, you would realise that she was not there, per se.
Mycroft proceeded to shed his gloves, revealing the voyance rune on his right hand, followed his suit jacket and then he undid his expensive cufflinks and very posh shirt, revealing heavily marked skin underneath, filled with permanent marks and white scars where temporal marks had been drawn time after time.
He shrugged at the comment and extended his left hand, in which John noticed a beautifully carved golden ring, with the letter T in cursive. It was bigger than a standard band, in fact, it seemed like several rings, each which a feather carving that reminded John of a phoenix’s tail.
Sensing this was the only moment of privacy he was going to get with Sherlock in some time, John decided to speak.
"They both went to school together in France. Mycroft and me, we went to the same school, but we were never acquainted with each other. You could say we ran with different crowds."
“John, Dr. Watson, sir, I can tell you my mate here is telling the honest truth. I do know you both from the future. There was a case, but there was more to it. Aliens were involved.”
Flourish and Blotts was almost empty, as he expected on the first Monday of January. No kids buying magical textbooks, no parents fussing over parchment lists. He was standing on a corner, book in his hands, "
John sighed as Victor chuckled, following his partner out of the room and up the stairs. The door to his room, their room now, was closed, and he opened it and entered quietly. The door to the ensuite was open, and Sherlock was removing his clothing, a vacant look on his face.
"Moriarty's dead, John. But one of us, either Victor or Alissa, probably Victor, messed something up. Someone is alive who shouldn't be, someone that I think was the second most dangerous man in the muggle world and the most dangerous in the magical one right now."
He went back to his seat, and they kept looking at the files in silence. Soon Sherlock had the wall filled with pictures, of his ‘rats’, the people they were going to watch in the next couple of days. As he finished placing the last photo he could feel John standing next to him, his very presence anchoring him back in London. He was back, and John was here.
“Yes, you should be sorry. I don’t want to be held responsible, but if he comes near me and threatens me or any member of my pack again, I don’t care if he is the sodding prince of whatever, I’m going to impale him in the nearest iron fence I can find.”
“Yes, I’m afraid he chose to regenerate into a rather charming body. A body who mirrors exactly the appearance of my currently deceased mother.”
They talked Quidditch for a while, Victor seemed surprisingly knowable, and John had been out of the loop for so long that he enjoyed catching up. He reached the store he was looking for and bought the potion while Victor was distracted looking at potted Venomous Tentaculas. Then Victor demanded to know what he had bought, and John refused, so he pouted as John steered them all the way to Flourish and Blotts.
"Yes, it's been a while, but I can do it. But wait, I wanted to ask something first. What were you doing in Diagon Alley? It had something to do with Moriarty's threat?"
"Wizard, living among muggles, been away from the magical world for a long time now. Probably a traumatic event, suggesting by your reaction when entering this pub. Robes are old, and they don't fit like they used to. Muggleborn, going by the fact that you adapted and thrived in the muggle world, even becoming a doctor and a captain in the army. You never wanted to come back, never regretted leaving until something recent caused you to worry. You were reading a book when I saw you,
John took advantage of the discussion to stand near Sherlock, amazed at how his partner was separating the potion into each of its components.
“And don’t forget my mother only authorised this mission today. We need to make haste and finish this once and for all. Moran must be in custody and Azkaban today.”
He laughed nervously, not meeting John’s eyes, which is great because he had a murderous look on his face. At that moment, Harry chose to appear.
“No. I think I seriously underestimated Moran’s prowess with this particular brand of dark magic. You can see the eyes?”
"Well, he will be younger than John's girl, and my wife seems to think we won't be sending our son to Hogwarts."
"Don't be absurd Mycroft Holmes. You knew this was going to happen eventually. Your brother, storming your office, asking you about why he is the last one to know that his partner is a wizard. And I'm here to remind you that any new incident from the Moriarty case had to be filed under my office and through Harry. We are looking for a very dangerous man now, and I want the Auror office on it. Let me remind you that you are on our side, not supposed to be helping with your brother's vendetta."
“I’m starting to see a resemblance between those Shadowhunters and a fascist regime. But you have a toddler in the house, so I assume he must be yours, I don’t think someone would leave a toddler around you that much if it wasn’t.”
“Yes, you and Seraphina if I recall, you were not supposed to bring you own entourage. I don’t want more than one Shadowhunter in this flat.”
"And after we finish the spellwork, and we obliviate you, John needs to do me. Just a punctual obliviate. I need to forget the name again."
around. Are you staying for a while? Daddy doesn’t say it, but he is usually happier when you are around. Why don’t you visit us like you used to? Are you mad with Daddy? Or is Daddy mad at you again?”
Sherlock looked pained for seconds before it all disappeared once again behind the facade. John wondered how much Sherlock knew the lady, and how he didn't react when he saw her dead, as Gabrielle had.
Ah, so hungover, not sleep deprived. Coffee and pot for their landlady. So be it. Her cell phone rang.
Clary Fairchild/Fray/Morgenstern is the main character of the Mortal Instrument series, who is dating Jace Herondale, both of them are the leaders of the New York Enclave, and heads of the New York Institute.
“Don’t ever think of doing something like that again, John Watson. It was hideous to see Victor disappear into this forsaken place and then you decided to follow suit as if you two were alone in the whole wide world.”
"Mycroft must know. He knew all about her after I revealed the existence of the flash drive to him. He knows everything that goes on, on both worlds."
"I guess I have to call Tum now. This case is starting to be so much more bothersome than usual, so much legwork ahead for all of you. I offer you my condolences."
“Says the guy named Sherlock. He was raised Pin Yin, that’s the name my sister gave him, so as soon as he had a say he changed his name.”
“Most of them do, in fact. My sister stopped aging when she was 21, in my case it varied, I usually look in my early thirties, but she looks younger. My brother, on the other hand…”
He released Victor into a magically conjured gurney, and he was about to follow Sherlock into the lift when he heard a voice behind him.
“Darling, you must be careful love. Not everything outside wants to play with you, dear. Some things out there want to do you harm.”
Mycroft hadn't moved from the chair for the whole conversation, and he remained eyeing the Daily Prophet while John and Sherlock looked at the picture.
John was patient most of the times, but this whole thing with traps and riddles was getting on his nerves. Sherlock started talking, eyes never leaving the doors.
As soon as Sherlock gave the order and they released, the whole room started spinning, and doors began closing as they moved closer to Gabrielle. John noticed that their latching spells were all golden, all but Sherlock’s, who had a silvery latch on Gabrielle, very thin, almost non-perceptible. When John stepped after Sherlock through the door, he noticed that all the latches had vanished, but Sherlock kept his cord on. John saw, but the rest of them, including Gabrielle, seemed oblivious to the fact that Sherlock kept his bond to her. John moved to cover the latch from the rest of them, trusting his partner’s judgement blindly. It was too dark, but he could feel Sherlock’s quiet approval of his actions.
John Watson lifted his head so fast he almost gave himself whiplash, just in time to see the back of a man wearing grey wizarding robes, and a mop of messy dark curls walking away from him.
“Being a werewolf doesn’t mean you are especially bright or even remotely intelligent, brother mine. That applies to the rest of Downworlders and Shadowhunters too, I’m afraid.”
“Easy does it, Miff. We were bringing some stuff from John’s flat. No doubt Alissa already told you what happened today.”
"Yeah, and I didn't forget you were a crap one. Sherlock taught you how? You never seemed like you wanted to learn."
“Well, you wouldn’t have been a Malfoy, even if your grandmother had the name. She married a Watson. And, I think you might have misinterpreted something there, John. Your daughter is a witch. And she is going to be a handful if she can produce something like that barely two hours after being born.”
A tall, gingery and lanky man with spectacles, freckles and a bookish manner was getting a canape from one of the magical trays before his wife grabbed him and placed him in front of her new found friend.
How could you ever do that to your poor wife? She directly told you not to go, and you go around bothering her when she is in such a delicate state! I would have expected something like that from Sherlock, you know all the dreadful things he has put our dear John through, but you?
John opened the curtain, stark naked and dripping wet. Sherlock took him all in before handing him a towel from the rack. John dried himself a little before wrapping the towel around his waist.
"Starving. But I really should get back home. I should talk to Mary about the protection and safe house. I don't want my wife and child in any more danger if I can help it. You need me to help you out of the Ministry?"
Mycroft just had this type of luck. It didn’t matter if he kept out of the field most times, preferring to use his massive intellect to deal with difficult affairs and sending the rest of the London Enclave to hunt the demons they were supposed to keep at bay. But as soon as he found himself distracted and angry, angry at himself for snapping at one of his only friends and insulting his intelligence, he found himself under a surprise attack by not one, but ten Ravener demons. He did his best to eliminate the threat by himself. It would be lying to say that he wasn’t a little relieved when the others joined him, especially since the demons had surprised him and managed to hit him one or two times with their poisonous stingers. As always, he carried his weapons and stele with him, but he felt the energy draining from him, even as he drew more healing runes on his skin. As John ripped the head of one of the last ones, he felt the last of his energy drain and it required all of his strength to keep himself upright.
Sherlock is back, and both of them start going back to their routine. John is elated, having his friend back and everything is strictly platonic, at least for now.
“You can tell them apart when they sing, and Patronuses are usually silent unless they are conveying a message from the caster, and even if they take the form of a bird, you couldn’t tell the difference in this case without the singing. Since he fancies himself American, it’s a crow for him. I always thought it morphed into a raven because he finally had shown his real self.”
They moved onto the lift, followed by a couple of paper aeroplanes. John remembered from the last time he was here that they were interdepartmental memos. Many things had indeed changed. The Fountain of Magical Brethren, which towered in the atrium the last time he set foot in that place, was removed from its spotlight. He remembered someone saying a creepy statue took its place when Voldemort took over, but now a monument with the names of all that died fighting him was on that site. He passed it without looking, not wanting to remind himself of all the losses. Sherlock was fidgeting in the small space of the lift, and Hermione kept looking at him disapprovingly.
“Race of aliens from planet Gallifrey. They are the guardians of time. Ianto is one of them, just out of the Time Academy. He and his brother, sorry, sister, are helping his parents fight a race of aliens in a planet called Agora.”
. The baby? I wanted her as soon as she came into this world because she is a part of you. And it’s a blessing that she inherited your magic because that is something that I share with her that your former wife doesn’t, and that makes her a part of me too. Now that I have you, I’m not letting you go. You have seen me at my worst, and you love me, and I frankly don’t deserve it, but you make me want to be a better man.”
"Well, you didn't notice me at Hogwarts, that is for sure, nor I remember you. I was only a student there for half a year before my mother sent me to live with my grandmother in France."
"She's not my real aunt. She's Victor's aunt from his mother's side, but I've called her auntie since I was a little child. Her sister is my mother's best friend."
"Yes, like in the muggle government he is the Ministry, well, him and Granger. She was never happy with my brother's arrangement for me. When she took office, she wanted to interview me herself, and get rid of my wand, but Mycroft somehow changed her mind."
“What, him? If he one day gets the honor of meeting Alexander Lightwood, it would do him good knowing he is excellent in bed and all mine.”
It's still Sunday on my side of the globe, so this update is on time (just barely). I hope the ones who are still reading like it. Thanks again for reading! Comments and kudos make my day.
“You keep telling me about my sight. I’ve seen the Institute. I’ve seen boys with tattoos in that precise building.”
"But you are right about something, John, he knows about you being a wizard, he probably knows everything there is to know about you, from both worlds. I'm going to curse him in his sleep if I ever get my wand privileges back."
"Because she just did John, Mycroft is going to back her campaign. She is going to run unopposed. With that, and Harry Potter as her successor as Head of Magical Law Enforcement, the woman will win in a landslide."
“I guess they are; you could say that. Unlucky, complicated wands, with unlucky, complicated owners. We of all people should know!”
"Mycroft was in Slytherin? Yes, of course, he was, he's such a git. Wait, how do you know which house I was in? And I would have remembered you if I saw you at Hogwarts."
“Enjoying yourselves? Enjoying? You almost got murdered today! You are a total wanker, the most conceited, insufferable, excuse for a wizard…”
“So it seems. He can control more than one body, but he cannot infuse much of his living energy on them, so the decomposition process is not slowed down, like in the main body he inhabits. I doubt those bodies could perform magic. In fact, I told my brother that I assume he needs wizards’ bodies to perform magic with them. By the look of these bodies, he managed to decimate the rankings of one of the cartels that roam in the nearby Ciudad Juarez. They also supplied the weaponry. Which is unfortunate, we prepared for magic, not warfare.”
"Those days until September the first were hard. My parents tiptoed around me, murmuring to themselves when they thought I was not looking. The only one who was excited and elated for me was Harry, go figure. My sister told me she knew I was something special from the first time she saw me, mind, the girl was only two, but Harry was supportive and loving to me, and she, being a pre-teen with a lot of anguish about her sexual orientation, made that even more incredible. She made me tell her everything about the Alley, made me show her my books and was adamant to see me off to King's Cross when term started. My parent's left me before we even got to the wall between the platforms. Harry took me to the wall and waited till a wizarding family with two kids was standing next to us. The mother smiled, and Harry took her cue and told her she was waiting for someone to take her little brother to Platform 9 and three quarters. She kissed my head (she was taller than me at the moment) and waved as the nice witch lady helped both her sons and me through the wall. At that moment I made my first wizarding friends, Luke and Oliver Wood, Oliver was starting Hogwarts that year, and his older brother Luke was a third year Hufflepuff. We got into the Scarlet Engine, and my first journey to Hogwarts began."
He grabbed his umbrella from the door and walked out of the flat. Greg sat back down, clearly still angry.
“Amazing. You got all that how, Sherlock? Because you said he would be expecting you even before you read the Codex.”
At this Sherlock’s eyes widened, and John could see that there was no way out of the conversation now. Of course, his mad, brilliant flatmate, who he now fancied himself to be in love with,
was furious, she still is. She is granting permission only if Sherlock apologizes and something else. She didn’t say. It could be anything. My mother is a brilliant woman, she is the Head of Congress, but she can be a little wicked sometimes.”
John tried to concentrate in their previous location. Nothing happened. He then worked up thoughts about a different place, Holmes Manor. Again, nothing. 221B.
"Now, Victor, you do your thing, grab me with your left arm and wrap your wand arm around John's arm. Lift your robes so he can touch you. John, we are going to lend our magic to Victor, to empower his spell. This is a charm I invented myself, and it needs contact. Raise your wand, and make the infinite sign with it, an inverted eight-figure, while saying
He flicked his hand again, and John was now wearing an outfit similar to Harry’s, black leather trousers and jacket, with a tight white T-shirt that showed his muscles in favorable light.
“I’d rather go wandless for the rest of my life than accommodate to your wishes. I’m a grown man, and I've meant it before. You both don’t have a say in my life. Victor, I don’t tolerate you for two days sharing the same space. How the hell do you expect me to tolerate you as my handler?”
“This was more difficult than before, Alissa, had to go to the Department of International Cooperation before setting this one. Are you sure you want to appear unannounced?”
“Oh, I wasn’t wearing this particular face at the time. But it’s good to remember. Let me tell you a story.
“I’ve thought about what you said. I’m prepared to stay in the muggle world. But you need to give Olivia a choice. If she gets the letter, which I don’t doubt she will, she should be able to go to Hogwarts or any magical school of her liking.”
“I shed the Verlac as soon as I went to school. The name was a handful itself, without adding two surnames to the mix, and a French one, to the patriots’ dismay. Never trust the French.”
And the memories were just that, memories, his parabatai was dead and that empty hole was never filled again. Even when his best friend, the wolf he once saved, tried his best, no one, no one could repair what he had lost. And that was before. Before James, before Riegan, before they left everything else unsaid.
Victor nodded, and they group arranged their positions again. Victor kept watching the hole in the wall, before coming to a full stop and removing the wall. It opened to a circular room with multiple doors. Sherlock smirked at Alissa, and she raised one eyebrow at him.
"So your brother is indeed expecting you. This door only appears when the staff is expecting someone outside the Department. It changes depending who is on the other side. Black is your brother's office directly. Most people he allows in his office appear through the Floo Network, so he knows you'll be using this way then."
No sooner they had started planning for the evening, Mycroft on his phone and Alissa with her head through the fireplace, that a silvery swan appeared.
The book opened, revealing a blank page. Sherlock tapped the page with the wand. The page remained blank. Sherlock smiled, as he touched the page again, this time saying,
Sherlock stopped composing after around 3 pages, having found out that his frustration and unfamiliarity of love were overpowering what he wanted John to hear, and maybe this wasn't such a good idea. He proclaimed (temporary) defeat, and continued his experiment on the different rates of post-mortem decay in animals through different types of poisons.
He started off sweetly, thinking of John when he thinks hard on what to write in his blog at one in the morning. John when he runs out to buy takeout for Sherlock on a whim because he thinks Sherlock looks pale (and knows that he is on another one of his "fasting" streaks).
His nightmares were getting worse as of late, and the melodic tones of a piano would be perfect. Sherlock imagined playing Liebestraum on it for John, but his violin would have to do for now.
He doesn’t notice the hesitant steps that were making their way closer, the man that stopped to lean on the doorway, entranced and completely mesmerised by the music.
The things he’d been planning for the day had been put away and replaced by this re-awakened task. After all, John was in a sour mood and Sherlock could try to make it melt away with the notes that were specially picked out and arranged just for him. He retrieves his violin from the corner of the room, gently puts the piece on the stand, and gets a pencil.
It feels like flying and falling, as he lets out everything about John, how he thinks he loves him but lost all his faith in the concept. Out of all the peo?ple in the world, this broken soldier came and brought the spark of life, the reason for existence in his wake. A druggie with an IQ far higher than Einstein's who always stands out and a retired army medic who seems to blend in everywhere he goes doesn't seem to fit, but it just does.
John, still shocked, just continues to wait for the tea, feels confused. What did he say? Is it about him going to work? Or about him staying over at Mary’s? He decides to ask, unfazed by the current mood that he knows he shouldn’t be surprised over.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, lets out a loud sigh, and tries to burrow further in the cushions. The coffee pot beeps, so John answers Sherlock with a rivaling harrumph and goes to the kitchen.
“Mummy’s invited you and John to visit Holmes House this weekend, and you know how upset she’ll be if you won’t come,” he says, with an exasperated tenor. He turns to John with a mockingly pleading look in his eye. “Do convince him to come, our mother’s been wringing her hands silly!”  he truncates, and heads out the door. “See you there!” he calls out to the room, both occupants not sure of whom it was directed to.
Sherlock had a secret. Only a few people knew it (Mycroft, Mummy, Father, Mrs. Turner, Cook, and the Gardener at Holmes Manor) and he's not planning to add any more people to that list.
After he got off university and lived off his own, he had no access to a piano. Their grand piano at the mansion was his source of joy in the times of silence at home, for he would play with his violin in his room or in the garden, much to the amusement of the gardener and the birds resting in the trees.
It really didn't bother him before, and it shouldn't be bothering him now - but it is. His hands sometimes grew wearing of his bow against four steel strings, which frankly surprised him, and they ached for the smooth ivory keys he grew up with. There could only be one reason for this.
“Are you sure you want this?” John asks, low and serious. “Not playing a game here. I need to know you’re sure.”
The transition back to normalcy is sometimes a little tricky, after all. Sherlock closes his eyes and wills the awkward, painfully self-aware moment to pass.
John nods. “We’re finished,” he says calmly, far more calmly than he feels, every inch the professional as he banishes the press of difficult, unsettling feelings (sorrow, disappointment, anger, confusion) to the farthest darkest corner of his mind.
“You should see yourself,” he murmurs. “Covered in my come. Absolutely defiled. My filthy creature.” He leans forward, uses his thumb to collect the semen spattered across Sherlock’s chin, presses the digit to his mouth. Sherlock opens his mouth, licks John’s thumb clean.
“You make it sound like we’re ancient,” he says softly, not in annoyance but in something that sounds close to acceptance.
Sherlock’s entire body is shivering uncontrollably. He doesn’t know if he’s burning hot or freezing cold, his voluntary muscle control is on the verge of going offline completely, and he can’t make his fingers release the top of the wooden rail.
After a few lovely minutes of snogging Sherlock breaks away, panting a bit for air as he rests his forehead against John’s.
John crosses the small room, seats himself on the piano bench next to Sherlock, their thighs pressing together. Sherlock doesn’t pull away.
Doctor Sheldon is rapidly depleting his reserve of patience, and this time he actually does roll his eyes at John’s words. “What situation could possibly be so urgent that it cannot wait another 72 hours?” he asks, and by the tone John can tell he’s on the edge of writing this noncompliant jerk of a patient off as a lost cause.
Sherlock gazed at him, at an uncharacteristic loss for words. As the first officers on scene clambered noisily down the wooden staircase he raised his hands, mindful of the confusing gloom, gesturing with his head towards the bedraggled man cuffed face-down on the floor. Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock saw Lestrade’s shock of silver-white hair in the darkness as the DCI descended the steps. He turned his head, saw the Chief Inspector look at him with a questioning glance.
Sherlock obeys, looking up into John’s eyes, his enormous pupils surrounded by a rim of stormy blue.
John chuckles. “Some grovelling wouldn’t be remiss, either.” He sets the last screw in place, descends the ladder, smiles at Sherlock. “I need to flip the breaker back on, then I’ll come upstairs.” He looks at the wrapped parcel in Sherlock’s hand. “Don’t suppose that’s something for dinner?”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock says, cutting him off. “More than fine. And if I’m not, I’ll let you know. Please, John. Just kiss me.”
The two of them drift into an exhausted but not uncomfortable silence, the calm after a raging storm, all of their emotional energy utterly spent. They stay like that for a long time, curled into one another, drifting perilously close to sleep as the first pale apricot streaks of dawn appear in a dark grey sky.
“Sherlock,” he whispers. “Sweetheart. Your cock is so beautiful, so gorgeous. I want to feel it. I want to hold it in my hand. May I touch you there? Please?”
“The theatrics are what make it fun,” Sherlock says, breaking his silence, voice cool and even. “And in point of fact, she’s not planning to kill us. Are you, Maria?”
Atherton smiles. “I like to think I see the sides of people others sometimes miss. It’s crucial to my line of work.” He stands, extends a hand to John. “I’d love to have you come work with us, Doctor Watson, if you’ll have us.”
John draws his knees up to his chest and leans his back against the cold brick, trying to find a comfortable position three hours into the enterprise. Sherlock holds himself quietly through sheer force of will, trying hard to not acknowledge that he feels every bit as damp and chilled and uncomfortable as John looks.
What he doesn’t expect is the sound of a cap being unscrewed, and the cool plastic of a water bottle against his lower lip.
John tries to stay serious for a moment, then realises the ridiculousness of his pose--naked, incredibly erect, holding aloft a tube of KY Jelly--and gives in to the giggles as well, practically doubling over with near-hysterical laughter.
“Open your eyes and look at me.” John orders him. Sherlock obeys. John holds his gaze as he slowly and deliberately undoes his jeans and pulls out his half-hard cock. He gives himself a leisurely pull, tugging at his foreskin, brushes his thumb over the slit.
“No, I think it’s murder,” he continues. “I just need to figure out the how, and why, and where. Pretty much need to figure out everything other than what’s right in front of us.” He gestures at the dead man’s hairline. “Which includes Professor Macpherson’s affair with a much younger woman, judging from the hair dye, recent botox injections, and--” he indicates an area on the underside of the jaw-- “this tiny smudge of pink lip gloss right here.”
He pulls out his phone, is about to text Sherlock...but then something in him (guilt, apprehension, residual annoyance, take your pick) stays his hand.
“Hello, gentlemen,” Wiggins says as he ducks into Lestrade’s office. “Detective Inspector,” he says, holding out his hand. “I’ve heard a great deal about you from Mr Holmes. All good, of course.”
John reaches down, pulls away the sheet covering Sherlock’s back. He sucks a quick burst of air through his teeth at the sight, and going by that reaction Sherlock knows the evidence of last night’s encounter must be something truly impressive to behold.
Of course the DI is, as ever, more intelligent than he appears, and knows that setting the hook with the prospect of showing up the resident Yard techs is a bait Sherlock is constitutionally incapable of resisting.
John eyes him warily. “Maybe you could,” he concedes. “Doesn’t change a thing at the moment, though, does it?”
John cuts him off. “I know, love. It’s fine. We’re both--” John searches for the right words, fails. Instead he turns his head, finds Sherlock’s mouth with his own, and kisses him. Sherlock tastes terrible from cigarettes and dehydration, and John doesn’t care in the least.
“I need you to find her.” He tries to grab onto Sherlock’s tee shirt, to pull him closer, but his hands are uncooperative, his fingers sluggish and numb as they fumble against the fabric. “Promise me you won’t stop until you find her.”
After some time passes the hazy, numbing fog begins to recede a bit, enough to allow John to begin to catalogue the jumble of confusing feelings in his head and heart.
Closing in on 2 a.m, their online search for the right Lou Andrews is proving frustratingly fruitless.
So clearly, he’s not in fantastic shape overall -- he’s peeing into a bag, he’s incredibly nauseated, his mouth is Sahara-dry, his head is pounding, and this is just the immediate first impression of the situation.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock breathes. The tension of the rope and the tightness of the cuffs around his wrists sends shocks of white-hot arousal down his spine. God, how he loves to be tied up by John, the absolute safety and trust and freedom of it, and how relieved he is that his enjoyment of it hasn’t been dimmed a fraction by his recent experience. Sherlock grinds his hips lewdly into the mattress and groans in mindless pleasure at the friction against his aching cock.
John keeps watch over him, the whole night through. with only his own ghosts and memories for company.
Sherlock teases his nipple gently with his teeth before repeating the maneuver on the other side, licking and sucking at the rosy-brown nub until John is gasping his name and seeing stars. He slowly moves his way down John’s torso, exploring him with his lips and tongue, tasting him, pressing kisses into the softness of John’s belly as his large hands roam restlessly up and down the length of his body.
“Horrible,” Sherlock huffs. “Tedious. Boring. Time-consuming.” He pauses just slightly, the corner of his lip twitching in something close to a smile. “And much as it galls me to say it, not altogether without merit.”
“I’ve already grown tired of sheep,” Sherlock says dismissively. They’re hopelessly dull.” He pauses, considering. “Bees, though. They’re much more interesting. The complexity of their colony behaviors is astonishing.”
him, liking him enough to graciously deal with Sherlock rebuffing his tentative advances that first night (and relatively kindly, though it didn’t feel that way in the moment), liking him enough to put up with his many, many annoyances and peccadilloes, his odd habits and rude responses and thumbs in the fridge and jars of eyeballs in the microwave.
“So good,” he rasps, “you’re so good, just a little harder, just--” He wraps his smaller hand around Sherlock’s, guiding him, showing him the short, jerking stroke he likes best, just this side of too rough, making John gasp as he thrusts and moans and sighs, reveling in the lewd display of it, spread out and naked, writhing shamelessly and pornographically in Sherlock’s lap. The very thought of it all sends hot sharp shivers of pleasure throughout his body zinging along his exposed, singing nerves, pushing him over the edge into--
John almost objects, feeling plenty well enough to fix his own toast, then he remembers the conversation from last night and takes a seat. Sherlock seems something close to...cheerful as he spreads butter and Marmite, cuts toast into triangles.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John breathes as his tongue finally works its way inside of him, teasing him, leaving him open and dripping wet with saliva. “God, that feels so good, fuck.” Sherlock lifts his head and kisses the small of his back as he slips a finger into his relaxed opening, making John gasp out a string of small incoherent sounds as he arches his back and clenches tightly around the intrusion.
John’s back arches off the bed as he comes with a guttural, animal cry of pleasure, his stretched hole clenching and spasming around Sherlock’s fingers, the pressure against his prostate making him come harder than he ever has before. The wrenching bliss seizes his body, waves of mindless ecstasy making him shudder and cry out as his semen spurts gorgeously across Sherlock’s face, his willing, open mouth, his full lips and waiting tongue.
There is a moment of rather poleaxed silence from both men. Then Sherlock sighs, his shoulders sagging just a bit.
“So Billy,” John says conversationally to the skull, as twilight begins to darken the sitting room windows. “It’s just you and me tonight, mate. Help me out. What am I not seeing here? Common compounds, not restricted, easily available to anyone with Internet access. So where did these traces come from? What do they mean? Do they mean anything at all?”
John spreads his legs just slightly, shifts Sherlock’s body  forward a bit until he’s tipped just slightly forwards, a bit off balance, his cock nudged into the space between John’s clothed thighs. He can’t help but groan and wiggle a bit at the delicious feel of rough denim against his cock. John presses a warning hand into his back.
“So now,” Maria continues, “I need cold hard cash to get back on top and out of this low-level shit, and I know how to make a deal. I found more than a few who want your heads on a platter, but a surprising number of individuals are willing to pay a tidy sum for both of you, the matched set, still breathing and conscious. There’s a disgraced Austrian baron hiding under an assumed name in Argentina. He’s offering seven figures just so he can...” Maria shakes her head, her mouth puckering into a grotesque moue of mocking sympathy. “Well, let’s just say death may be far preferable. But as long as I get paid...well. Too bad, so sad, but needs must and all that.”
On the left is an open doorway leading to a formal dining room. Sherlock goes right, into the main living area, and John follows.
“Of course you don’t,” John hisses. “God forbid I forget. Sherlock Holmes is so clever, so bloody clever he doesn’t need anyone else, and he certainly needn’t concern himself with the people who care about him. He’s so bloody above it all he needn’t ever stop to think about the people he leaves behind, does he?”
And the truth at the heart of it all is this: He doesn’t want to know the details just for the sake of knowing; that terrible knowledge would be as sharp and cold as a knife in his heart, but even that pain, he thinks, would be a relief from the exquisite, endless hell of
Sherlock hums in mock contemplation. “Counteroffer. Fluids, no food, toothbrush, and a hot shower. With you in it.”
John hums his approval;. His fingertips slide across Sherlock’s collarbone, tracing the dip between his pectorals. “Tell me more.”
His phone buzzes. He picks it up. It’s not Sherlock. It’s his sister. He rejects the call and shoves his mobile under a stack of unopened mail.
John thrusts upward without hesitation, seeking and finding with unerring instinct borne of long intimacy, groaning as his cock breaches Sherlock’s body and sinks home with a single long, slow slide. Sherlock closes his eyes and moans at the feel of it, the marvelous sensation unlike any other, the push and stretch of it, the burning fullness and the bone deep satisfaction of being filled full, being taken over so completely.
“There’s a Rite Aid on practically every corner,” John says, thinking aloud. “Why would people drive that kind of distance  --not far, not really, but just more than one would expect -- to a small local chemist’s on the other side of the river, in a really dodgy part of town?”
He doesn’t mean to, but of course John falls asleep. One puts an exhausted 44 year old man in a comfortable bed at 2:55 in the morning, it’s and absolutely inevitable conclusion, no matter what frame of mind he is in.
“Do you want--” John breathes the words in between frantic kisses, and Sherlock’s nodding before he can even finish the sentence. “Do you want to touch it?”
Morning and afternoon slip past, and neither one of them wakes until the sliver of daylight from the window has given way to full night, their room dark except for the occasional passing flicker of headlights as a car pulls in our out of the lot beyond their window.
John can’t help but laugh, and Sherlock grins, his eyes crinkling at the corners in pleasure at John’s amusement.
Sherlock’s mind has never been this disconnected from reality, this terrifyingly untethered from the empirical physical world that is the foundation of his self, and something very like panic skitters along the edge of his mind, a metallic bite of fear that has nothing to do with the pain of the crop against his back. He sees the body in the mirror tensing, shoulders hunching; he sees his diaphragm constricting, his respiration becoming short and shallow, eyes widening in fear.
John crosses the lounge area and crumples into the seat next to him. He feels completely empty, drained, too tired to move.
Sherlock is beyond language now, utterly nonverbal as John fucks him with aching, deliberate slowness. Each roll of John’s hips makes Sherlock cry out in ragged, broken sobs as he pushes back against the measured thrusts. He is broken, devoid of thought, reduced to a rutting animal focused only on the heat, the fullness, the friction of John moving inside his body.
John stops instantly, releases Sherlock’s cock from his mouth, pulls back. “What’s wrong?” he asks, stroking his thigh reassuringly.
Sherlock’s hips twitch, a small involuntary thrust into John’s grip. It feels unbelievably good, and a small needy noise escapes Sherlock’s throat at the sensation. “I’m just--” oh, bloody hell, the friction of it, sending sparks of pure pleasure through his body-- “making sure you know what you’re missing out on tonight.”
Sherlock is sitting on the his bed, clad only in soft cotton pyjama bottoms, frayed at the hem from many washings. His pale torso is far too thin, every rib visible. The bullet hole is healing well but still livid and draining just slightly; the thoracotomy scar starts under his right arm, follows the curve of his ribs, stretching around to his back. It looks minor, almost inconsequential, but John knows it hurts him almost as much as the hole in his chest.
“I feel like I could sleep for a week,” John answers honestly. He doesn’t voice the thought after that one, that just being here, back at Baker Street, home with Sherlock, has made him feel more comfortable, more relaxed than he has been months, feeling like he could sleep well for the first time he doesn’t even know how long.
Then there’s the baby. Although he can’t help but be concerned about her, most likely she is not his biological child.
Each drag of the B&H lights Sherlock’s face just briefly in a slightly-otherworldly pale orange glow.
Sherlock jaw snaps shut and he goes very very still, and John suddenly understands that Sherlock has once again, for all his intelligence, let his desire to be clever very much get in the way of the more immediate short term goal of
“Travis was my best mate,” Rocco begins. “He hadn’t been on the streets that long when I met him...three or four months is all. His mum kicked him out when he started acting odd, having hallucinations, saying things about aliens and whatnot. She was scared of 'im. Lots of people was scared of 'im. But he was sweet. Harmless. He had weird thoughts, sometimes, but Travis would never hurt a soul.
When they’ve made it down to the first floor, John takes a deep breath and pastes a calm, relaxed, I’m-not-bleeding-internally look on his face. Patricia is at her desk awaiting them -- well, John, mostly -- with a hundred-watt smile.
“Well, thank you for that,” John says. “It was damned foolish of you, though. You took a huge chance, facing her armed, relying on me to get myself loose in time.”
It’s a bit of a pull and strain, but together they manage to wrestle the white tee up and off without causing John any immediate damage. John collapses back onto the bed with a sigh, Sherlock lying down next to him, careful not to jostle.
John strokes them languidly, reveling in the sensation of Sherlock’s hardness rubbing against his own, the saliva on his hand barely more than an additional damp stickiness, giving a rough edge to the sweet, lazy pleasure.
A utilitarian and rather worn fold-out sleeper chair is jammed haphazardly into the machinery- crowded room. Sherlock is curled up on the blue vinyl, his head pillowed on one folded arm as he sleeps, and John knows he must have been out for quite a while for the ever-vigilant Sherlock to fall asleep in such an unguarded, vulnerable manner, as if exhaustion literally knocked him over.
Gregson is at the hospital where his wife has just delivered their second child. Clearly the two of them are not aware of global overpopulation issues.
“You turned them away,” hisses Sherlock, crowding close into Lestrade’s personal space. “People who knew him, cared about him. They knew something terrible had happened, they came to you asking for help, and
John reaches for the best way to let her down gently without closing the door entirely. He settles for a half truth.
“Some day, she will know,” John says. “One day, years from now, she will know what I did. What will I do on that day?”
“We just offended Mrs Hudson’s delicate sensibilities. The least we could do is pick up after ourselves.”
The chimes ring out in Lestrade’s distinctive pattern--three half-second bursts, one after the other in rapid succession, heavy initial pressure on the doorbell. The nimble click of Mrs Hudson’s heels tapping faintly down the hallway precedes the slight creak of the opening front door; the reedy tones of her greeting are met with the deeper rumble of Lestrade’s clipped yet polite response.
“You like this?” John asks between panting breaths, his low and gravelly, his voice roughened with pleasure.
, you know why. I would do anything in the world to spare him any more sorrow. I love this man enough to commit crimes against anything. So you have to do it to me too. But before that, I need to erase the memory from the room. Otherwise, I'll see it the next time I'm here. We need a powerful spell for that, and you need to give Victor back his wand. John, we are going to need you too. Victor, memory transfiguration. You lead."
“Twenty-five minutes,” Sherlock repeats before ending the call. He looks at John, his expression absolutely controlled, his eyes focused and intent.
No more is said about it. Sherlock merely nods, ducks into his bedroom, leaves John to follow of his own volition.
His right hand releases its grip on the back of the chair, sliding his hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck, dips his head down to kiss his reddened mouth. Sherlock kisses him back hungrily, greedily, his tongue hot and wet in John’s mouth, hands roaming across his back, his hips, his arse, fingers demanding and hungry, wanting in a way he’s never been before.
“All right,” John echoes, and ducks into the ensuite to get ready for bed, first using the toilet then brushing his teeth carefully, making sure there’s not a shred of coriander leaf stuck anywhere; not that he’s at all certain what, exactly, is going to happen tonight, if anything, but, well, just in case.
“Oh God,” Sherlock gasps, on the very edge of climax, every nerve ending alight. “Yes, please, oh god, anything, just please,
“You’ve shouldered so much of my burden,” Sherlock murmurs, lips brushing against the shell of ear, voice just barely above a whisper. “So much, and so bravely.”
“I’m hungry,” Sherlock announces, sounding a bit surprised. “I haven’t been hungry since… well, since we’ve been here.”
The woman is older but not quite yet what could properly be called elderly, possibly a bit past sixty, well-kept and still quite attractive in her own way. Her pale skin is a bit weathered but not yet papery thin, crow's feet spidering away from the corners of her eyes, a touch of botox obvious in the smoothness of the glabella muscles between her brows. Her light brown hair is short and well-coiffed, in that slightly overly fastidious way women of a certain age seem to gravitate towards, topped by a pair of cheap plastic reading glasses perched atop her head. Her clothing--a coral pink sweater set and khaki trousers--is  casual but stylish, clearly expensive. Her earrings are clearly genuine diamond, set in white gold, and a bit too large to be precisely tasteful.
“Why do I feel like this is going to lead to a second career as some kind of consulting entomologist?” John says, returning to the sofa. He takes off the ice pack, begins carefully spreading the cool pink lotion over the sting. With the stinger gone, it’s already looking less angry.
Sherlock has a brief, confused flash of the shoreline before a tsunami, the tide pulling away from naked sand, and then his orgasm crests and breaks and he’s coming hard, a sob torn from his throat as he convulses helplessly, drowning in an overwhelming wave of pleasure  but he does what he is told and watches, he fights every instinct and keeps his eyes open and he sees himself in the mirror, his cock spurting forcefully, two days of denied arousal onto his own stomach and chest and John’s fist, his face twisted in an open-mouthed rictus of pleasure as the bliss explodes across every nerve, lights every cell on fire for a single timeless moment.
Sherlock nods, snuggling down against John with a sigh, his eyes already drifting shut, a trace of his lovely smile still lingering on his lips.
Gentle hands stroke his back, trace the old silvered scars that mark his flesh. “All right, love,” John whispers. “It’s all right, shh.” The mattress springs creak as John climbs onto the bed and settles himself behind Sherlock. Fingers wrap around his wrists, stilling the desperate push of his hand. “My turn,” he whispers, and guides Sherlock’s fingers out and away, positioning his arms in front of him on the bed, sliding a pillow under his hips. He kisses the back of Sherlock’s neck and gently pushes his head down to the mattress, nudges his knees apart.
The front door crashes open, and Adam Kravitz comes charging into the room, breathing heavily, with a gun in his hand. He points it directly at Sherlock and John. His finger, of course, is on the trigger.
At the gorgeous wet heat enveloping his cock, John makes a high-pitched, undignified noise, somewhere between a whimper and a squeal, his hips thrusting upwards involuntarily. After several gasping breaths he manages to raise himself up a bit on his elbows, hands fisting the sheets, to watch Sherlock hard at work, sucking his cock with an intensity that borders on worshipful.
“Sit down,” Sherlock says, herding John into the nearest dining chair. “I’ll get you some toast before you take your medication. Someone was clearly homesick, there’s Marmite in the cupboard.”
John wonders what will happen on the day that wall grows so high he and Sherlock can no longer see each other anymore.
Whether Sherlock hesitates because of nerves or because he’s deliberately drawing out the delicious torture of this tension, John isn’t entirely certain; the moment spools out and stretches, tight as a quivering bowstring, and just as John is about to say something, anything at all to break the tension of the moment, he feels the first, feather-light brush of the pads of Sherlock’s thumbs ghosting up the backs of his calves, along the shallow dip between the twinned muscles of gastrocnemius, up behind his knees and back down again, then up, slightly firmer this time.
They gaze at each other in silence, each unable to find the right words. Or any words. Another moment passes.
John exhales, clenches and unclenches his fist. Looks up at Sherlock, emotions tucked away behind stone walls, blue eyes gone grey and unreadable.
“Me too,” John answers, his eyes suddenly stinging hot all over again. Unable to look directly at Sherlock a moment longer without dissolving into tears, John turns his head, presses a chaste kiss to Sherlock’s shoulder, tastes the concentrated salt of the drying sweat on his skin.
(It’s true. Shortly after quitting the surgery, a six-figure sum had appeared in his bank account, along with a missive hand-delivered by one of Mycoft’s minions, indicating that the funds were a reward from the Americans for the capture and return of the woman John knew as Mary Morstan. John didn’t particularly believe it, but he didn’t refuse the money either. It would have been pointless to try, anyway, as Mycroft Holmes refuses to comprehend the concept of 'no' as an answer.)
"You have a vast and varied medical background,” Mycroft replies, his cultured voice gaining the slightest edge. “You must be somewhat familiar with the the nature of organized crime in the Eastern European community and therefore not unaware of what horrors prisoners--hostages--are frequently subject to. Cuts and gouges and beatings, as unpleasant as they are, are nothing,
He never even seriously considers removing himself to the second, made-up queen bed nearer the wall. In his most secret of hearts, John he doesn’t think that he can go ever back to that gulf, that level of physical separation. Not now, now that they’ve crossed that threshold. He needs Sherlock close to him, close enough to anchor him to earth, close enough to keep him from spinning off into the cold void of grief and fear.
“I think the rest stays,” John says. “I like the way it looks on you.” He picks up his now-cold tea, holds it to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock drinks. As John puts the cup back on the table, Sherlock sags a bit, rests his cheek against the fabric of John’s jeans. John picks up the leash and pulls Sherlock up.
The man looks up at the pair, expression carefully, blankly neutral as he visually catalogues them carefully from head to to toe.
Sherlock drops his head against John’s shoulder and laughs quietly, a low, rich chuckle. John groans.
“Say you’re sorry for being bad,” he rasps in Sherlock’s ear as his fingers pinch and twist at his nipple.
“I really am,” John chimes in. “Couldn’t be better, in fact, so can everyone here dial it back just a notch, please, and put the murder hardware away for the moment?”
, I’m angry and I’m rude and I don’t even know what I’m feeling or thinking half the time, I never understand the simplest things--”
“There are a score of registrar’s offices within ten minutes of Baker Street,” Sherlock sighs dismissively, although the idea of his parents’ house and morning suits and pale blue flowers and finger sandwiches doesn’t repulse him nearly as much as he feels it ought. “And whatever we decide to do, rest assured you won’t be--”
“I suppose so. But--” John tries to find the words for what he’s feeling. “But I wish--I wish you were the first.”
“Janine told me,” John says. “Six days ago. Well, she told me about you and David Foster. But it only confirmed my suspicions.”
“You’re so beautiful,” he murmurs against heated skin, thumb tracing the prominent lines of his collarbone, the long line of his neck, the sharp edge of his cheekbone. Sherlock responds with a pained whimper, pushing his hips upwards, writhing under the weight of John’s body on top of him, his cock flat against his belly, pinned in the space between their bodies. John can feel the sticky wetness of his leaking precome smearing against his skin as Sherlock writhes underneath him, tiny pleading gasps and cries trapped in his throat.
