“You are so grounded.”
“Thank you,” he replied, unsure of how to react to the sincerity in Tony’s voice. This was the longest sentence he’d got out of Tony since Thanos.
“Remember to be back before 10 o´clock, cap,” Clint warned him, “or Fury gets a heart attack.”
“You are really the sweetest man in this horrible world,” Tony spoke up after a while, leaning somewhere beyond Steve´s reach. The lamp flickered into life and Steve closed his eyes with a force, because of the brightness and because of what it meant.
“What about you?”
“Nice to meet you, Mr. Stark,” he finally managed to spill, taking his hand after Natasha had kicked Steve´s foot.
The only person on Earth who remembered how half of the universe perished and who held all the infinity stones in his hand bringing everyone back to life was not willing to tell a word about it. Not to reporters, not to Fury, not to new or old Avengers, not even to Pepper or Rhodey. The Sorcerer Supreme, Steven Strange, seemed to at least understand little bits here and there from his own experiences with time manipulation, but even he didn’t have a full picture.
“Excellent. Jarvis will get rid of those cuffs as soon as I´m out of the room. You have here shower and clothes if you would like to change. By the way, I haven´t thought about any possible way how we could eat with you restrained, so I hope you won´t feel like arresting an innocent person here, most of all when this person is serving a dinner.”
Tony didn´t seem to be concerned by the mentions of the camera, but then Steve remembered his face was covered when he´d found him.
“No… light…”
“Oh, glad you asked. Jarvis, how is it going with our plans?”
“You have nice long lashes and thick brows. Sometimes when you sleep next to me and you wake up with your face pressed on my chest I can feel them.”
Tony just let the air leave his lungs in a shallow, torn exhale.
He let him because he wanted those hands near him again, he wanted to fell the guy´s cologne and see him moving and walking with broad shoulders up and down with each breath.
“No.” And it was the truth. Steve tried his damn best not to. “Not when I know it´s important to you.”
Natasha hushed him immediately with a frown, but it was too late for Steve´s grin already formed on his lips. He had to look like a teenager drooling over his crush while recalling the strong body under his hands, the perfect bright eyes and a smile he would kill for… he stopped the track of his thoughts before they could end up somewhere more south.
There was like a second of eye contact between them, when Steve knew that Iron man understood he was not going to change his mind.
“Why not? Tell me. I can take it. I will take it. You don’t need to be alone in this.”
It was like if everything was happening in a slow motion. Tony turned away, and Steve still couldn’t draw in a proper breath.
A tear dropped from the corner of Tony’s eye, and Cloak wiped it away quickly.
“Please, don´t.” He sounded broken and scarred and it took some time till Steve found a possible reason and fought away the horrible feeling in his stomach.
The truth was no one could prepare him well enough for a distraction and fear binding him into a nervous ball of worry whenever someone aimed a weapon towards the man in the iron suit and fired. Each and every time his breath got caught into his throat, feet froze to the ground and all his attention was suddenly on him and him only. Like nothing else existed for Steve in that moment, all his surroundings blurred, his eyes desperately searching for a familiar red and gold colors in the sky.
Steve stayed quiet because he desperately wanted to hear more.
Clint came to stand next to him watching now clear skies.
Steve was there just in time to catch Tony when his legs failed to hold him and he maneuvered the smaller man so that most of his weight was now on Steve.
“Yeah, I know. It´s okey to tell him anything you are alright with. He probably knows I have a crush on you. You can tell him I was trying something, but you had no interest or whatever you like, captain.”
“It´s not a stupid idea, Steve.” The voice was somewhere next to Steve´s right side and he realized that Tony had to stand up while he was talking. “You can do that if you want. I´m standing right here.”
“Sleep well, darling. We’re going to have a lot of fun tomorrow. You need to gather a lot of strength.”
Iron man… Tony didn´t reply to that, but he didn´t have to.
The voice was choking on the words when answering. “It was… a trap. I´m sorry. I don´t… There was a gas. I… I breathed… in. ´m… sleepy, Steve. You… find me?”
“I do.”
And after that one question Iron man laughed quickly and cheerfully. “Yes, cap, like me.”
“Thank you for saving me, Steve,” he whispered into his partner’s mouth after a long moment of the two of them just starring at each other. Tony pressed their lips together in a brief, loving kiss.
Steve nodded. “That sounds more like what I would do, Tony, and you know that. It sounds about right that Tony Stark made someone fall in love with him at the end of the world.”
“I´m sorry I put you in this situation. Do you want me to stop visiting?”
Steve shook his head, a smile back on his face.
Steve bent closer in the way where he expected to find Tony´s face, he let his hand stroke the other man´s cheek and smiled when Tony leaned in the touch.
Steve frowned. Strange couldn’t mean him, could he?
Morgan nodded, pleased by the offer.
It was Steve’s fault he let him think that. Because he’d thought Tony would not be interested in him in that way he’d never approached the man scared that their friendship would be damaged. And then Accords and Siberia happened, the biggest mistake in Steve’s life. And now he learned that despite that Tony still trusted him and maybe loved him in the time lost between their two worlds.
“Sure.”
“What about my eyes?”
“Iron man, is that you?” he asked with a small hope in his hoarse voice.
“You did?” Steve couldn´t fight an amusement in his voice. “And what do you plan to do with me then?”
Only after an hour or so, he calmed himself enough to get out of the bed and find something to drink and eat in the kitchen. He returned on his toes, which had as much of an effect as an elephant trying to sneak around.
“Stark is strong, but he is not invincible. His mind is… rather damaged, I guess you noticed,” he started.
“Sir knows you are here, he canceled the lockdown, you can enter.”
“I… don´t know…”
There was a big bed right in front of him and a small table with a lamp, a pile of clothes on the armchair and two doors, no windows. One was locked, what Steve quite expected, the other one led him to the nice bathroom, where he took a long enough shower to forget on the burning and exploding buildings at least for now.
“Steve…” Tony groaned into the phone again and the supersoldier went still. “Please… Help me.”
“Fine. You won. I can´t really imagine anything better than spending my night throwing up in front of you.”
“He will ask me questions. What should I say?”
“Can you walk? I can carry you upstairs,” he offered, when he saw how much troubles it gave him just to hold his eyes open. At least he thought so. He couldn´t see Tony´s face through the hoodie and the dark of the night around them.
“What did he say?” Clint asked this time very seriously.
“Take care, captain. We´ll stay in touch.”
Steve had to recall one more time that no one had any idea who Tony was and that for some reason they were playing this game, so Steve went with it.
Tony just laughed bitterly glancing up on the stars like he’s just remembered something.
He nodded. And went to his room. It was better than to stay alone in his flat.
“Uhm,” the engineer hummed, “I think that’s all.”
“You already know how I look so this is really ridiculous. Just open your eyes.”
“Give me the knife, Tony, it´s okay.” He watched as the man´s beautiful eyes returned to something what only he could see. Steve tried again. “I will protect you. Please. Give it to me.”
Steve´s eyes fell down on the unconscious man lying beside his feet.
“What is it about?” he asked curious.
Director Fury sat in his office, looking at the wall in front of him. He took a few deep breaths.
“What color?”
“What is it?” Steve asked. He was still very close. He could almost sense Tony´s eyes meeting his.
“He kidnapped Captain America,” Fury tasted the words on his tongue like it was a two days old lunch.
“Tony,” Steve groaned.
“Why is it that I have to be always silent, but Iron man can talk all the time?” Clint complained. “By the way, SHIELD has just finished clearing the path, so it´s only you two and those three civilians. Captain is right, Iron man, if you can´t deactivate the bomb, let it blow.”
Steve let Tony babble with a fond smile forming on his face, all tension leaving his body at instant.
After that he could hear Tony sucking in the breath like he had trouble to import air into his lungs for a moment.
“You can, Tony. You have every right to be. Please.”
He turned his head and the metal eyes settled on Steve´s face. “I am no hero, captain. Don´t worry. I don´t plan to die today.” And there was a smile and easiness in his voice, which made Steve feel like it was all not a big deal and everything will end well and that was such a rare feeling in Steve´s life that he had to mentally drag himself back to reality.
“Come on. Few more doors to break.”
Tony nodded slowly, thoughtfully, and he smiled with something horrible written all over his face. Steve just stood there unable to ask what was wrong. Tony gave him a long look that Steve couldn’t read out and then nodded again, letting go of Steve’s hand.
“Because you don’t mean it.” Tony sighed. His eyes full of longing and affection. “You are doing the same thing now. You are willing to start something with me only because I was on that damn ledge 5 minutes ago. I should have never told you about this.”
“Thank you for saving me first,” Steve murmured smiling into the next kiss, and then the next one and then one more.
The desperate look on Tony’s face was the last thing Steve needed to see to let his hands gently grab the engineer by his arms.
“I assume,” Strange went on, “that during that time he was only able to choose and remain on the right path with a help of a very close person.”
Steve´s smile started to widen as he was speaking and at the end his face almost hurt. The rest of his team was clearly on the same page with him. Nat even hugged him, whispering softly in his ear.
“As I was saying,” Steve started again. “I had a small crush on Tony when I was younger. But I’ve been over that for years. And I doubt I’ll even see Tony – it sounds like he isn’t involved in any way.”
Steve politely shook her hand, a smile that looked more like a grimace gracing his face. “I’m Steve Rogers, ma’am. I’m the Head Trainer for Stark Racing. It’s great that you both were able to come out. Your horse will be running in a few hours.”
“One of those foals is now two years old, and is showing real promise. He’s the first Avenger offspring with the right bloodlines to win at a classic distance. All he needs is a chance.”
“Just thinking about the Derby,” he said.
“Someone rides that thing?” Tony asked, appalled.
“Oh, Tony. Is he what this is about?” She shook her head at him in exasperation, then started forward again, headed straight for Steve. Tony trailed after her, wishing he had come up with a plan beyond “find Steve, explain himself.”
Steve’s blue eyes turned steely. “You know, I just might believe you on that one. My mistake.” He turned to Barton. “I need to look after Avenger. I’ll see you tomorrow morning.” Without saying another thing to Tony, Steve clucked to the horse behind him and walked away.
“Holy shit, what did I do last night?” Tony asked back, looking around the room for a TV remote. “Did I puke on someone important? Do I want to turn on the TV and find out?”
And then he was staring at his parents’ faces, as the scrolling bar on the bottom of the screen pronounced Howard and Maria Starks’ deaths.
“I’m so close, Obie - I just have to get it all figured out before graduation.” Tony stopped himself before he started going into detail, knowing from experience that Obie wasn’t interested in the nitty gritty of his work. “So, where’s dear ole’ dad? I was supposed to meet him here.”
“It’s Bucky, you prick. And you weren’t just a drunken hook up. You were the guy Steve had been idealizing from afar for years that suddenly showed up in his life, took his virginity and then bailed on him the next morning!”
“You have a great horse there, Tony.” Steve held his hand out for Tony to shake. Tony grabbed it, but instead of shaking it, he pulled Steve in to him.
“I think you mean if the horses around her make it through the first ten seconds unscathed,” Bucky laughingly replied. Steve grinned in response. Widow was a fighter for sure. She often reacted to new situations with teeth bared and ready to attack. But she loved to run even more than she loved to fight, so Steve was sure she’d come through the race on top.
On the pillow next to him there was a folded piece of paper. Steve reached for it, his hand trembling slightly. Unfolding it, he read the short note written in a messy scrawl.
“Fury offered me a job as Head Trainer of Stark Racing.”
“Rogers, you’re with me,” Phillips bellowed.
At Tony’s blank look, Fury explained. “He won a race. Some horses need several tries, but he broke his maiden his first time out, winning by seven lengths. It was an impressive first race, but he wasn’t against elite company. Look, give me a year to turn this farm around. A year from now, if Cap is as special as I think he is, he’ll be running in the big races. Not only will that increase his value, but that will increase the value of Avenger and the other foals from the Avenger Initiative.
In the year Steve had been riding at Aqueduct, he had mostly exercised maidens and claimers – lower end horses that had never won a race, or who were only able to win against lackluster competition. In the last few months Phillips had put him on a few allowance-level horses when their regular exercise riders weren’t available. But Avenger was the first stakes-level horse Steve had been trusted to ride regularly. For the last month, Steve had been on the horse six days a week. And the few times he’d breezed the horse made him appreciate the difference between this horse and others that he had ridden. While racehorses were exercised every day, they were only asked to run full-speed, or breezed, about once a week. Most horses Steve breezed slowed down by the fifth furlong, or started feeling less fresh and eager. Avenger always felt like he wanted to keep going, and his stride just got bigger and stronger the further he went.
“Steve Rogers, Avenger’s exercise rider.”
Bucky reached over to pet Steve on the head again, missing and swiping his ear instead.
“Oh, Tony. I get why this is awkward for both of you. But I was expecting something way worse. If you only met once, it isn’t a huge surprise that you didn’t remember him – you meet so many people.
Clint moved to the next stall, which looked deserted. Tony peered inside, and then jumped back as a lithe black horse lunged towards him, teeth bared.
Nick stepped over to the wall behind Tony and switched on the lights, and then walked over to Howard’s desk, taking a seat in front of it and gesturing Tony over.
Steve smiled slightly and shook Tony’s hand. “Actually, we’ve met,” he said. “Several years ago.”
“Sure Stevie. No more mention of the Tony Stark crush.”
Honestly, the last few hours weren’t overly clear in Tony’s mind. He remembered being at his dad’s party, bored and getting drunk. He remembered wandering around the room, hoping to find something (or someone) to occupy his time, and hearing a gorgeous brunette talking about a crush on him. And he remembered the thrill he felt when he realized that the person who had the crush on him was the same guy who not three hours before had been telling him he wasn’t worth anything. He’d decided to show Pint-size how wrong he was.
“Absolutely, Mr. Stark. Every horse has a different running style, which is modified to fit the individual race being run that day.”
“Your father also got impatient with his trainers when they weren’t winning the races that he wanted them to be winning. He went through big name trainers as quickly as he went through expensive horses. He’d hire them on with huge contracts that he’d end up paying out when he decided they weren’t producing winners.”
Tony kept walking, avoiding her eye. Pepper wasn’t wrong – he had been distracted over the past few weeks. Ever since he left Stark Racing three weeks ago, he’d been thinking about Steve.
Steve and Bucky stood next to one of the towering sycamores in Keeneland’s paddock, watching as a groom led Black Widow. She looked acutely aware of the crowd around her, with her ears pricked forward and extra energy in every step. Steve thought that in this moment she looked an awful lot like Zenyatta, one of the all-time great race mares. Of course, Zenyatta had been a giant at 17.2 hands high, so more than a hand taller than Widow. Plus, Zenyatta had a pronounced white stripe down her face, where Widow was solid black, without a white hair to be seen. But both horses had a way of moving that made them seem like predators, rather than the prey animals that they actually were.
Bucky looked over and caught his eye, widening his eyes in an expression of “can you believe it?” This was by far the biggest race that he and Bucky had ever been involved in. There were more fans, more finery, and more cameras than they were used to seeing. In fact, the race was being broadcast on television as part of NBC’s Road to the Kentucky Derby.
“Hungover?”
“Fuck!”
Yet, when Tony had woken up the next morning, he started thinking about the vitriol that Steve had expressed for him the day before, when sober. He didn’t want to be around if Steve woke with regrets, so it had been easier to just leave. He had gotten into the car he’d sent for and mentally moved on, delving right back into his AI project. He had never paused to think that Steve might not have moved on so easily.
“Meanwhile, Steve gave up a great job to come train for you, and I followed the punk, because that’s what I do. He’s going to win big races for you, because that’s what he does. Then he’ll be out of a job while you’re sitting in your tower counting your money. So since your big plan is to fuck him over, if you could do that from a distance, that would be great. I don’t need you hanging around making things worse.”
Tony’s eyes, which had looked so sad earlier in the day, now danced with merriment. And despite himself, Steve felt a little warmed by that fact.
Tony let himself into his father’s office at Start Industries, and then stood for a moment in the dark, looking out through the clear walls into the city below. He hadn’t yet decided what to do with the space. He would prefer to stay in his labs and workshop, where he could continue the breakthroughs and innovations that had kept Stark Industries on the forefront of tech companies over the past decades. Plus, he had few good memories of this particular office, having stood in it several times while his father berated various personal and professional decisions that Tony had made. However, Tony also knew the value of the show – of bringing investors into the immaculate office that dominated the top floor of Stark Tower, and of holding meetings with the city stretched out behind him. Maybe if he had the space completely redecorated, he’d be able to use the office without feeling like he was sharing with Howard’s ghost.
“Look pal, it ain’t every day you’re talking to Nick Fury, okay? Hell yes I was trying to listen in. I would’ve been sitting inside your office blatantly eavesdropping if I thought you’d let me.”
“Aren’t you supposed to be meeting with the vet about Dum Dum’s tendon? I thought today was the day for updated x-rays and ultrasounds.”
Steve cut him off. “Mr. Stark, I really need to get going.”
Tony stopped in his tracks. “Wait, what? I met Avenger’s exercise rider the one time I got dragged to the races. He was a little guy with a big mouth. Absolutely nothing like that guy.”
“Well, it looks like that isn’t going to work out for him, doesn’t it,” Tony replied. “If you saw my press conference, then you know I’m selling all of dad’s businesses outside of SI. That includes Stark Racing. From what my lawyers tell me, that racing farm is the biggest resource drain of any of our holdings. They say it’s right in the middle of prime horse country, and that we’ll be able to get a good amount of money for the property. The horses will go to auction in the next few months, and I’m told a few of them might be worth something.”
“Long story short, I met Steve twenty years ago at the one horse race I ever went to. We fought, then we flirted, we got wasted, and we fucked. I left the following morning and didn’t see him again until three weeks ago when I found out that he’s now my horse trainer. I didn’t recognize him at first, which isn’t my fault – he looks totally different now, Pep. And I maybe hit on him before I knew who he was.”
Steve got up from his desk and walked out of his office and into the main barn aisle. Bucky followed, still loudly questioning Steve’s life choices. Steve looked around, taking in the sights and smells of Howling Commando Farm, where he and Bucky had both worked for the last decade. He could hear the horses in their stalls, munching on hay. He could see Dum Dum's big grey head hanging over the stall door, looking inquisitively their way. Yes, he loved it here. While HCF wasn’t a huge racing program like Stark Racing, it was a solid one.
Tony turned in his father’s chair, looking out once again across the city. He really had no urge to own a horse racing farm. What did he know about horse racing anyway? He’d only been to a race one time in his life.
As Steve had expected, the two horses in the lead were starting to slow, and Black Widow was able to overtake them. But another horse – the horse that had been dead last at the start – had also made a move, and was coming up on Widow’s outside. Steve saw Natasha push her hands into the filly’s neck, asking her for more speed. And just like that – the race was over. Widow seemed to drop into another gear, pulling away from the other horses so quickly that it looked like they were standing still.
But for some reason, Steve kept going back to his confrontation with Tony Stark earlier that day. He still wasn’t sure why Phillips had wanted Steve to accompany him up into the stands. Phillips seemed to think that Steve would make a good trainer one day, no matter how often Steve protested that he wanted to be a jockey. So maybe Phillips had wanted to impart some sort of trainer-wisdom on him. That had backfired. Phillips still wasn’t talking to Steve, furious at him for the way he had talked to a client’s family member.
“Absolutely not. You’re not my type.”
“Sure thing, boss,” Clint replied. “Showing the king around his Camelot sounds like a great time.”
Honestly, Steve had been on his mind for more than the last few weeks. Ever since he had agreed to keep Stark Racing, he had occasionally wondered about the exercise rider than he had connected with so many years earlier. His monthly meetings with Fury, which were often filled with discussions of Avenger and his progeny, inevitably brought memories of his one horse racing experience to mind. Which then led to thinking about Steve, in a vague and pleasant way.
Reaching his side, Obadiah threw his arm around Tony’s shoulders, pulling him into a short but forceful hug. Then he stepped back, studying Tony with cheerful, knowing eyes.
Pepper started to drift towards the stall, and Steve blocked her with his body. “I wouldn’t get too close to this one – she can be pretty feisty. But she’s in tip-top shape and ready for this race. If I were a betting man, I’d put money on her to win her race today. And then it will be on to bigger and better races for her.”
Of course, Tony reminded himself meanly, Hitler had loved his dogs.
“Rogers, enough. Tony, good to meet you,” Phillips said, pulling Pint-size away from Tony. That left Tony standing alone at the front of the box, his headache now pounding. Fuck, he needed a drink.
Peggy and Phillips then started talking strategy as they walked towards Avenger, with Steve and the Starks following while avidly listening in. Avenger was a stalker, preferring to run right off the lead. Peggy’s job was to urge him forward at the break, angle him towards the inside rail as soon as possible, and tuck him behind the first few horses. Ideally, that is where he’d stay until they rounded the far turn, when they would make their move.
Just then, Tony saw the Stark Racing logo hanging from the next barn over. And sitting on a folding chair in the aisle way was Steve, his eyes shaded with sunglasses and his head tipped back. With his long legs stretched out in front of him and his hair gilded in sunlight, he looked unfairly gorgeous.
As Obie was talking, the picture on the screen panned from horse to horse. And when the number seven horse was shown, there were his parents, dressed to the nines and conversing with an older, gruff-looking man. Tony squinted at the saddle pad of the horse his parents were standing near. Under the words “Wood Memorial” was the horse’s name: Avenger.
There was the one question he shouldn’t have asked, the first question he’d ever asked Tony, back when they first met.
“They weren’t really a thing in my day, Tony,” Steve said. “And in my defense, there are a lot of buttons.”
Mostly, these questions didn’t need to be asked out loud.
“I wish you’d come here to ask me something else,” Tony had said. “Anything else.”
“Nothing, I just can’t believe I have to show Captain America how to wash his tighty-whities.”
When a question finally formed in his head, weeks later, it couldn’t have been less helpful and it couldn’t have made Steve feel more helpless:
“You’re very welcome,” Steve said and closed the washing machine’s door with a bang.
Is there something you’re missing?
Can I overstep every line you drew in the sand and then some more until there are no more lines left, just you and me?
Is there any chance that you can forgive me?
Possibly, probably, it had been the moment when they were all sitting around that table at HQ together, listening to Secretary Ross talk about the Sokovia Accords.
Can I tell you how much you mean to me or am I overstepping every line you drew in the sand?
If Steve would talk to Sam about this – and he won’t – he was sure his friend would tell him that the question felt more appropriate for a romcom heroine than for an actual supersoldier:
“What?” Steve said, trying and failing not to get infected by Tony’s laughter.
Do you want to share a bottle of scotch?
Somewhere between New York and Sokovia, somewhere between long briefings and even longer debriefings, somewhere between loud post-mission dinners and quiet glasses of scotch with Tony in his workshop, something formed in Steve’s mind that wasn’t so much a question as a feeling that he couldn’t quite place.
There was a question Steve did his best to push away, even while his brain kept circling around it:
Tony was more, so much more than the sum of his armor’s shiny parts.
“Captain Steve Rogers,” Tony asked, his voice dripping with amusement. “Are you telling me you don’t know how to use a washing machine?”
Looking back, he deserved every last ounce of snide in Tony’s reply.
Mostly, he found an answer in some shape or form.
Possibly, probably, it had been the hundreds, thousands of moments when Steve chose not to tell Tony what he knew about the death of Howard and Maria Stark.
Even before he spent seventy years on ice and his whole life became one big question mark, something or other had always been keeping his mind busy.
Why hasn’t he called yet?
Is there any chance that you will let me forgive you?
He didn’t want to look at that one too closely. Or else it might disappear.
As Tony’s lake house got smaller and smaller in the rear-view mirror and it became impossible to tell whether Tony was still standing on the porch, Steve’s mind was starting to spin with all the questions he’d never asked.
Where did it all go wrong?
Do you want me to stay for dinner?
Will you show me how to use your washing machine if I pretend not to know how it works?
“Laundry goes in the big hole, in case you couldn’t tell,” Tony said, helpfully.
Possibly, probably, he could pinpoint the exact moment if he tried.
What should they do now? Was there even a chance that they could do this without Tony? Was Tony right and they shouldn’t do anything at all? Could Steve live with himself if they didn’t at least try?
Something in Steve’s chest felt tight when he asked himself if he would ever get Tony to look at him like that again.
Mostly, Steve worked them out in his own head.
Tony’s laugh was a thing of beauty. It left his body so suddenly that it felt like Tony might be surprised to hear it himself.
Sometimes, when Steve felt especially weak, he’d think about just chatting to Tony, like they used to do in New York. When everyone else was asleep or at least pretending to be, when they found themselves in each other’s company in the early hours of the morning, talking about everything and nothing, because it was better than staring at the ceiling and anyway, there was a look in Tony’s eyes when he talked about something, anything that he was unabashedly excited about, something that didn’t have anything to do with saving the world, and that was a much better sight.
Anyway, I hope all of you guys are doing well or are at least ok, that's all for now, so byeeeeeee.
Now he can just hope he can go through the whole day without breaking.
Two completley different persons and yet, they had the same affect on Tony.
One time, Clint asked if it was true that Tony didn't have a soulmark. The rest of the team looks up to stare at him.
It's a normal day and he doesn't care.
"Have you even listened to any of my mes..."
Tony ignores the messages she leaves.
He doesn't answer.
He doesn't have a reason, so he
) once was true. But the marriage from what Tony can remember has never been a good one.
it isn't. That's just how soulmates are. A perfect fit for each other. Soulmates are like gravity to each other, always pulling them together. They just have this kind of balance, always shining brightly, practically screaming perfect.
Tony doesn't know what that was about, but he feels a little bit empty when she walks away.
Tony can't blame them honestly; he does too sometimes.
But, now, when he's on one of the worst low's he's ever been on in his life, he does what he does whenever he's been broken down too pieces, both metaphorically and literally.
Tony went quiet, the question so abruptly out of nowhere, before he quietly explained his soulmate died a long time ago. Which isn't a lie, per say, he's just withholding some information. He shrugs at Clint's
He shouldn't be feeling like this. He knows that.
He has so many problems, so many fucking problems, he just can't be bothered enough too care about it anymore).
Always so disappointed.
Jarvis was the first person Tony trusted.
Tony has never been fine.
It was a mistake.
(He remember Rhodey telling him when they were younger it's OK to ask your friends for help. To tell him if something is bothering Tony.
(Later, on the good days, he'll hide in the workshop and build. On the bad days, he'll hide with a bottle and won't build anything.)
Right?
Tony sometimes thinks it's his fault Obie turned out the way he did.
feel this way, because why should he feel so fucking horrible when he doesn't have a fucking reason?
It's one of the nicer dreams he has had in a long time.
Tony didn't even know that you can be jealous of robots.
The house is by the sea. It isn't like his house in Miami, but he doesn't mind it.
He was already having a bad day, anyway.
Rhodey calls too. Tony doesn't pick that call up.
They always comes at the worsts moments, he realizes quickly. When there's people in his face and phones everywhere and people are yelling and asking-
No one notices him leave.
Pepper and Rhodey were both lifelines to Tony.
He can feel a bitter taste in from his coffee when Bucky and Steve looks at eachother like there is nothing else in the world. He ignores it and continues drinking.
He finds out by JARVIS.
Another month passes by.
He closes his eyes for a second.
Tony knows he shouldn't be so disappointed.
with a shrug, feeling a little bit awkward and a little bit pleased.
Tony can remember creating U, DUM-E and Butterfinger.
Honestly.
Bruce doesn't ask anything more about it, because he's nice and doesn't want to pry.
Tony thinks of Steve and Bucky and their stupid, perfect smiles.
It's nice to feel okay for a change.
Yinsen starts coming back to Tony's dreams, although Tony can't figure out why.
He can still remember the rage burning in him when Yinsen died.

Tony doesn't talk to anyone. Doesn't try to get help.
But even though it was a mistake, it was just another proof that he is, in fact, an idiot who can do
Tony is tired.
Pepper tries to call him.
Tony miss feeling human.
Tony knows Yinsen believed those words to be as true as the sky is blue. Because Tony is an egoistic bastard with dead soulmates and he would be alone even after he escaped that hellhole.
He doesn't know if he wants to tell them or not. It's not
Either that, or they just doesn't care.

Tony leaves.
It wasn't their fault.
He didn't know she was right beside the building with the robot in it.
Tony can't remember last time he got that drunk after a fight.
And so, Tony ate his cake alone, with the company of his bots, in the workshop.
The punch in the face wasn't who they were.
Tony is alone.
Tony doesn't say anything about it and acts like he usually does, poking fun of Clint and generally being the smarter one in the room, except for Bruce. (And Natasha, because she is smart, just in a different way).
He thinks he deserved to know.
And if the day when he doesn't have any more idea comes-
But most of all, Tony is happy he can at least do something right for once and help a grieving man.
Tony can remember those few movie night he attented.
Tony doesn't know if he should laugh or cry when they discover the Winter Soldier.
When Natalie turned out to be Natasha, Tony didn't even get surprised.
"Tony, are you okay?" Rhodey sounds...scared.
, Tony thinks when Bucky's been in the tower for some time. Tony can't help but falling for him too, for his dry humour and the rare smiles he can sometimes get, when his mind isn't plagued by the things he did as the Winter soldier.
They're perfect. They're broken and wrongly coded and they're perfect.
But since talking with Bucky, Steve had been on his mind in a very different way. Instead of a pleasant, fleeting though about a fun-filled night, Tony was now viewing their interaction in a different light. He couldn’t pretend that he hadn’t known Steve had a crush on him – that had been part of the allure in the first place, finding out that the boy who had been so verbally dismissive of him actually been into him. And he had also known that he was the first person Steve had ever had sex with, and had tried to make sure the experience had been good for Steve.
“Lots of strange names with racehorses – generally based on their parentage. He’s out of a Smarty Jones mare named Doctor Smarty. I’ll tell you that training on this one has been interesting. He’s normally really easy going, and learns quickly. However, when he gets upset, holy fuck, watch out. He becomes practically unmanageable. Thank god I learned how to fall at an early age, because I’ve ended up on the ground a few times. I’ve started calling him “The Hulk.’”
“Daydreaming?”
Tony took his mental image of Pint-size and added six inches of height and a hundred pounds of muscle. Then he aged him twenty years. What he ended up with looked a lot like the trainer who had just walked away.
Tony took a moment to mentally compose himself as Clint waved the horse and rider over.
With that, Steve turned and opened the door to Black Widow’s stall, clucking softly as he slid inside. Tony watched after him for a moment, and then started heading towards the grandstand. He needed a drink.
Bucky nodded sagely. “And do you keep the copy of People magazine with all of those pictures of Tony under your bed because of how sorry you feel for him?”
Pepper shook his hand once again, this time letting her hand linger in his for just a moment. “We’ll be there – won’t we Tony?”
“Who’s Black Widow’s jockey?” Tony asked, pulling his attention away from glaring at Bucky.
Steve looked back at him, defiant and debauched. “What do you think Tony? Enjoying being ridden so far?”
“Steve. Steve. Stevie!”
“How’s our girl?” she asked, before focusing in on the filly in question.
Tony had just come from a press conference, where he had laid out his vision for Stark Industries. He was planning on selling all of the various side-businesses that his father had purchased, and focusing his time and attention on tech development.
Steve smiled at the redhead in front of him, thinking that only Natasha would describe riding a tricky filly in a maiden race as “fun.” Unpredictable, frantic, scary – those were maybe some of the words other jockeys would have used. But not Natasha – she seemed to thrive on the difficult horses, and the challenging races.
“So tell me about this one,” Tony asked, while cautiously running his hands along the horse’s face. The horse sighed and lowered his head, his eyes closing slightly.
“I specialize in the young horses, so I’ll show you some of those to start.”
Beside him, Clint whistled. “Holy shit, man, what was that? Steve is normally Captain Politeness, and he couldn’t wait to get away from you. What did you do to him?”
“And who might you be?” Tony asked.
Clint nodded. “Yes, that was your breeding stallion, Avenger. He’s in his twenties now. Steve rides him several times a week after the horses in training are done for the day.”
Steve then paused and momentarily closed his eyes, causing his long blond lashes to sweep his cheekbones. Tony heard Pepper inhale next to him, and felt a moment of triumph – at least he wasn’t the only one thrown by Steve’s good looks.
Aqueduct was absolutely packed, with individuals from every walk of life crowded into the grandstand. Tony glanced around the box where he was supposed to meet up with his parents: empty. Granted, he was supposed to have shown up several hours ago, but it had been a late night. He had dragged himself away from his workspace as the sun was coming up, knowing that he needed at least a few hours of sleep to deal with Howard. Even now, surrounded by the excitement and excess of the racetrack, Tony’s fingers twitched with the need to get back to work. He was so close – so close – to figuring it out. Yet, here he was, wasting his time on yet another of Howard’s follies.
In the afternoons, Steve’s purpose at the track wasn’t as obvious. He wasn’t a groom like Bucky, so he wasn’t leading the horses to and from the racetrack. He wasn’t a jockey yet, so he wasn’t able to ride in the races. He wasn’t great at picking a winner, so he wasn’t even able to spend his time betting – not that he had the money for gambling anyway. Without a set task, Steve felt aimless and in the way.
“Tony Stark, Pepper Potts – I’d like to introduce you to Natasha Romanoff, Black Widow’s jockey.”
But Tony could also remember how passionately that man had believed in Avenger, and how he had stood up for the horse against all detractors. Pint-size had really believed that the horse was special, and destined for big things. Maybe he had been right.
“Races like the Kentucky Derby?” Pepper asked.
“Here,” Barton said, grabbing Tony by the shoulders and turning his body slightly. “You can pet him. He’s a perfect gentleman. But you need to approach him from the side, instead of from the front. Horses can’t see you if you stand directly in front of them, so always make sure you can see one of their eyes when you approach. Keep your hands down low, and touch him on his chest or neck. People always go right for horses’ faces, which can spook them.”
While Rhodey was a calm river, Pepper was a raging fire. Both of them had their ways of handling Tony and both of them mostly suceeded.
He can remember what Rhodey said in the phone message.
No one helps him.
The thing is, Tony has never been
He can still feel his arc reactor,
"Tony? Why aren't you answering? I've been trying to contact you for
), doesn't sleep (
He ignores the burn right between his shoulder blades, where a blue sun is hiding.
He doesn't say anything Bucky is well enough to move into the tower.
He got Bruce his own lab.
Sometimes, Tony just stops. He stops with whatever he's doing and stares out into the thin air, his mind empty and his eyes unfocused.
Natasha stares at him. He stares back. She shakes her head and walks away.
Bruce is there a lot. Sometimes Tony joins him.
"Tony, are you okay? I..."
He haven't seen Pepper for some time now.
I hate quarantine.
He dreams of laughter and smiles while screaming for help.
Not as a teen.
He thinks nobody is just bothering to talk to him.
He wonders if he had gotten help when he was younger, would he still be as fucked up as he is now?
"Tony, seriously, what are you doing? I'm gone for two months on a mission and suddenly, you won't speak to me. Is it because the fight before I left? Because I didn't mean to punch you and..."
He wants to thank her for that.
It doesn't matter. He doesn't sleep that much anyway.
The team had a nice, relaxing night out.
They're just the last straw that finally breaks the surface.
They don't talk much.
No one tells Tony.
Disappointed.
Like the fact that it's only supposed to be a rumour about him being a drunk, arrogant, shithead.
“That was fast, Fury. How did you possibly already know I was here?”
“I’m not sure exactly what I like, Tony. I’ve never done this before,” Steve admitted, looking vaguely ashamed.
The paddock judge called for riders up, and Phillips gave Peggy a leg up into the saddle while Bucky continued to walk the horse forward. Avenger swiveled his ears back towards her, and Peggy talked to him in a low voice while she got her feet situated in her stirrups. The big thoroughbred arched his neck and began to jig a little with anticipation. He knew his job, and he was ready to run.
Steve and Natasha went over their plan once more, and then it was time. Bucky took Black Widow’s head as Steve tossed Natasha up onto her back. Immediately the filly twisted and crow hopped sideways, before popping up into the air in a partial rear. Bucky cursed and held on while Natasha sat, soft and still on her back, laughing at the horse’s antics.
“Tony, this is Stark Racing’s trainer, Steve Rogers,” Clint said as the man – Steve – dismounted. Tony watched as he pulled his helmet off and ran his hand through slightly sweaty hair, pushing it off his face. Tony held out his hand.
Apparently noticing the same thing, Bucky put the brakes on. “Sorry Dollface, it ain’t me that got the crush.”
Maybe Tony should regret that he’d never made good with his father – that they had never mended the divide that had sprung up between them when Tony started talking back at the age of 11, and that had deepened when Tony came out as bisexual at the age of 16. But there were only so many times he could try with someone who didn’t accept him for who he was.  So fuck Howard. Fuck him for not accepting who Tony was, and fuck him for dying before he could learn acceptance.
“Wait a minute,” Tony said, “did he say Avenger? As in the horse that retired from racing decades ago? Is that who he was riding?”
“Are you going on about Tony Stark again? Who cares what he thinks? Avenger won! All our hard work paid off. And we are Going. To The. Kentucky. Derby,” Bucky enunciated.
“We’re here, boss,” Happy said, pulling the vehicle up to an imposingly large gate with “Stark Racing” curved into the wrought iron. The driver rolled his window down and typed in the code, causing the gate to slowly swing open. And then they were pulling down the long driveway towards the buildings ahead.
“Tony, it’s nothing to do with last night. Figure out where you are, call me back, and I’ll come get you. Don’t turn on the TV. Just stay put.”
“I don’t know, Pepper. I just feel bad about this one. The kid I knew twenty years ago was really something. And Steve Rogers now is still really something.”
The look of shame morphing into one of determination, Steve moved off of Tony’s lap and rolled off the side of the bed. Holding Tony’s eye, Steve pulled his own pants down and off, standing in front of Tony in just his grey boxer briefs.
“Call me Pepper, please,” she responded. “And yes, this is my first time.”
Tony threw himself down into the small sliver of space between Steve and Bucky on the couch. He turned sideways, so that his head and shoulders were in Steve’s lap, while his legs were across Bucky.
Brody (or Buddy, or whoever the fuck) had face-palmed. “You didn’t remember him. Great. Nice to know that the poor schmuck was pining over you for years, and meanwhile you didn’t remember he existed.”
“Alright,” Fury started. “The first thing you need to understand is that Stark Racing is a full service breeding and racing facility. Some farms only breed horses, and others only train horses. Stark Racing does both. While we don’t have a huge breeding program at this point, we do have one stallion and eleven broodmares. Seven of those broodmares are currently pregnant, set to foal any day now. On top of that, we have two foals already on the ground, plus nine yearlings, and dozens of two- and three-year olds.”
So maybe he had a crush – past tense. That had ended earlier today.
“I am Stark Industries,” the man started, quoting something that Tony had said just hours before at the press conference. “Mr. Stark, I’m here to offer you the chance to be part of something more than that.”
Tony looked at the horse, who was placidly eating hay and ignoring them. “The Scientist? Seems like a strange name for a horse.”
As he went to settle back into the bed for hopefully another few hours of sleep, he happened to see his phone’s notification screen. He had 89 missed calls and over thirty voicemails. What the fuck? Scrolling through the missed calls, he saw Pepper dozens of times, but also Obie and several of the board members of Stark Industries. He must have missed something pretty fucking important, though he had absolutely no idea what.
Around the first turn Widow was next to last out of the eight horses, with a few lengths between her and the last place horse. Natasha had her right on the rail, and she had settled well, not fighting her jockey’s hold on her. Meanwhile the first two horses in the race where in a speed duel, laying down sub-12 second fractions. That was perfect for Widow – it meant that they most likely would tire each other out before the finish, allowing Widow to sweep in at the end.
“Noble steeds?” Tony questioned? “Did I inherit a racing farm or a Medieval Times?”
“Steve Rogers is the current trainer. Fury hired him six months ago. He’s out on the track – come on, we can walk out there and I’ll introduce the two of you.”
Pepper and Tony were both screaming as Black Widow crossed the finish line two lengths in front of the next horse. Steve couldn’t stop the smile that spread across his face, thinking back to the last time he’d watched a race with Tony.
“This is Captain America, Stark Racing’s great hope. He’s run four times in his life, and he’s been in the money every time against elite competition. He placed second by a head in the Fountain of Youth Stakes just last week. Cap would have been first, but he stumbled coming out of the gate and wasn’t able to make up the distance before the finish line.”
Nick smirked, reaching out to shake Tony’s hand. “I have eyes and ears everywhere on this farm. Now, I’m assuming that you would like a tour of Stark Racing?”
“Come on, Steve, loosen up a little. We’re going to the Kentucky Derby!” Bucky’s words slurred just a little, a testament to the number of drinks he had consumed since they got to the celebration. Steve toyed with the empty bottle in his hand, picking off bits of the label.
Tony looked around for clues as he started the coffee. “Pepper, light of my life. I have absolutely no idea where I am – a hotel somewhere. I’m sure I’ll figure it out soon. So what did I miss? And just how much trouble am I in?”
As they rounded the far turn, Steve saw Natasha drop lower over Widow’s neck, asking her to pick up the pace. They shot through a narrow opening between two horses, and then Natasha guided the filly over to the rail, asking her to squeeze between the rail and the third place horse. Steve again held his breath, worried that Widow would lose her focus on the race and focus instead on the horse practically touching her instead. But as though she had been doing it her whole life, Widow pushed through the opening without hesitating and was then in the clear, chasing down the dueling leaders.
“Pep, what the hell is going on?” Tony asked, worried. Pepper was normally all for him facing up to the embarrassing situations he got involved in. For her to be telling him not to turn on the TV – he couldn’t even imagine what was going on. He finally found the remote control and turned the TV on, switching until he found the news.
“I know plenty of guys worth ten of you, even without all the money.”
Tony didn’t look convinced. “That blush says otherwise. I bet it goes all the way down – want to show me?”
Obadiah pointed to one of the huge screens decorating the grandstand. On it, horses were being walked around by men wearing numbers, while a variety of individuals stood in small groups watching.
“Perfect,” Natasha responded. “I think she and I are going to have fun today.”
“Right, Tony,” Steve corrected himself. “As I was saying, there’s a plan for every race. Of course, it can all absolutely change once the gates open. Especially in a maiden race.”
With that, Bucky had stormed into the office, slamming the door behind him. Tony had stared at the door for an embarrassing length of time, weighing his options. Did he try to continue the conversation? Fire the guy, who apparently worked for Tony in some capacity? Walk away and pretend like the whole thing hadn’t happened?
He doesn't care about his soulmark anymore.
Tony miss feeling alive.
Tony doesn't know if he is dreaming anymore.
(He doesn't deserve help anyway.)
Not when he's with friends.
he thinks to himself,
Not until he saw her try to run away as the building collapsed from his repulsors, the robot going down with it. Of course, because the world hated him, the building fell sideways, right where Natasha was.
Tony can sometimes see Natasha staring at him.
He doesn't know.)
He threw them away without using them.
He helps to, for lack of better words, 'decode' the Winter Soldier.
Not when he's in his workshop.
Howard and Maria Stark died two years after he got his soulmark and he can't bring himself to cry for Howard.
He tells the team he's going on vacation and doesn't give them more information.
, getting ripped out in some of his dreams.
He watches, instead. He watches Steve laugh. Watches as Bucky smirks next to him, watches as he leans against the kitchen counter. He looks at the faint touch between their shoulders and the two hands that holds them together. He still can't help but glance at Steve's soulmark under his left collarbone, even though he's seen it a thousand times before. It's a simple mark, really, just a circle with lines coming out from it, twisting and turning. It looks like a sun, a sun with a dark, yet vibrant, blue color. Tony glances over at Bucky, staring briefly at his right upper arm, where he knows the exact same sun will be hiding under the long sleeve shirt he is wearing. Tony turns his head up to their faces, as Steve rest his head on Bucky's right shoulder and whispers something softly to him, obviously not meant for the rest of them in the room to hear.
Tony doesn't know why he doesn't feel happy, knowing he probably will soon get his answer.
Tony waves off their
Click.
Tony turns his head towards Steve and Bucky. Steve is also listening to Thor's voice, but he focuses more on the drawing he's currently drawing in his sketchbook. His head is in Bucky's lap, while Bucky plays with his hair. Tony thinks the position can't be that nice to be in since Steve has to keep his arms up to be able to draw, but he's also pretty sure it doesn't bother Steve, because of the super-serum and all. Tony can't see what Steve draws, but he can see Bucky smiling every time he looks at it. Steve's eyes are shining and Bucky seems more happy than he has ever been since Tony met him.
Tony wakes up in his bed. He stares at the ceiling for five minutes, before he sits up. He is still in his clothes he had in the workshop, but his hands are bandaged and aching. He looks away from them. He notices that on the right side of his bed there is a tray with sandwiches and a water bottle. He can't feel the taste of the food when he is eating. He can't feel the hot water when he showers.
It's easy to slip into his old drinking habits now when neither Rhodey or Pepper is there to stop him.
From the age of 23, the media thinks Tony is a drunk genius who loves to sleep around.
"Tony, this isn't funny. Pepper said she hasn't heard anything from you in
He wonders if he has passed the point of ever recovering.
Pepper calls Tony and he picks up, only to stop the call one second later, after hearing her voice.
(Tony wasn't drunk, but he wasn't in his right mind set when they fought, tired, too tired to care.)
A perfectly normal day.
Tony wonders how long he can be awake without going insane.
Tony sometimes feels as though ants are crawling on him, under his skin, in his bones, on his skin. As if his lungs are constricting, heaving, too large, too small and in the way, mind running, fuzzy, what is he even thinking? Is he thinking? Is he alive? Is he moving? Crawling, running, walking, hiding, something blooming in him, ready to burst open, bones snapping and turning inside out, scratching him from inside, growing in size, sucking in all the air-
They stop asking.
JARVIS tries to help him in his own way. Telling him when he last ate or slept. JARVIS tells him where all the other Avengers are and always sounds so comforting when he speaks to Tony.
Tony builds. He builds until his hands are bloody and aching, until his eyes are bloodshot and his legs feels heavy. He builds, he upgrades and invents. He does anything he can thinks of. He ignores Jarvis attempts to talk to him about how long he has been awake without sleep, since he last ate and the last time he left the workshop. He ignores it when Jarvis says Bruce wants to come down to see him and he ignores when Steve also tries.
(He does. A little. But honestly?
I've updated the first two chapters now. You don't have to read them, but I would recommend you do. I've changed some stuff and added some stuff, especially in the first chapter. If you notice something is wrong with them, like a paragraph is missing or something doesn't make sense, please tell me, because I really want this story to atleast ne ok.
Tony can't bring himself to say anything to Pepper and Rhodey, even if he would trust them with anything.
But this time, he woke up alone and cold.
Jarvis was the father Tony wished Howard could have been when he was younger.
problem.
There's no sound excpect his own screaming.
ALSO THANK YOU FOR 800+ KUDOS AND ALL THE COMMENTS AND BOOKMARKS!!!
He fought with Rhodey. He can't remember what they fought about, but it ended when Rhodey punched Tony.
Tony never has and never will, correct the media.
Tony doesn't talk much at all anymore.
It's about time Tony starts to be more like others.
At least, never when he's been in the picture.)
(He couldn't bring himself to get help when he obviously didn't deserve it, was the truth.)
Because JARVIS is
He can still feel his fingers and toes freezing when the first (and only) night came.
(People in school always joked about how the only friends he'll ever get is those he builds himself and he's not about to admit that it is true.)
The knife was dull and worn and it hurt so much that tears came into his eyes. The cut was jagged and deep and bled, pouring down his thigh (
Tony wonders what it's like being dead.
Not when he says he's fine.
He won't be surprised if she knows or at least suspects he didn't really tell the whole truth to them. But she doesn't say anything.
Most people believe everything that the media says.
He can still remember Yinsen calm voice talking to him when he needed distraction from the hell they were in.
He knows it should be a nice change to wake up in his room, but all of his emotions are buried somewhere he can't reach them and he's too tired to bother to try.
Tony has a hard time to remember Rhodey coming for him.
Jarvis says he's been asleep for 9 hours when he asks.
He hasn't used it much. Only sometimes. There isn't many people who knows he owns this house. Rhodey and Pepper knows.
(Might be because of guilt, but Tony always feels guilty.)
No one notices he is even there.
Rhodey and Pepper calls sometimes. The calls are short and stiff and Tony still doesn't say sorry.
and..."
(To have someone to talk to is also a reason why Tony built JARVIS, but he doesn't like to admit that fact.)
The soulmark hurt when he got it, which he thinks is lucky, because otherwise, he wouldn't have known it was even there before somebody else saw it. Tony got his soulmark at 15, two years earlier than the average time to get one. He doesn't tell anyone. Tony had learned by Howard at a young age that he was nothing worth and that the only thing that mattered was his name. He had been learned no one would love him. So how could he ever be good enough for two of the greatest heroes of all time? He only knows it is them because Aunt Peggy showed him a picture of Steve's soulmark one time and said Bucky also had one, much to her disappointment.
Tony breathes in.
"Tony?"
Hi again.
Tony can remember days when he was younger and Obie would give him the pieces he needed for his work, but couldn't ask his Howard, because Howard... well. Was Howard. So Obie would hand it to him behind his back, or when his dad was in another room, smile and wink at him briefly, before acting like it didn't happen. Always making sure Howard never noticed.
Tony can't help but think Rhodey is the lucky one.
Aunt Peggy was a fantastic woman.
Tony is fine.
DUM-E actually uses his fire extinguisher right for once.
Tony is fine.
Tony's shocked he hasn't died of alcohol poisoning yet.
Not really.
He dreams about laughter and smiles, the feeling of belonging and being torn apart while Yinsen watches.
A mistake.
He dreams of pain coursing through his body and wishing to die.
He ignores them and builds.
For all he cared, his soulmate could have been a nobody, someone with an ordinary life, an ordinary look, a normal person.
Tony collapses 8 hours later.
, screaming at him or helping him into bed or both. Sometimes he'll wake up on the floor in the workshop, cold, while DUM-E bumps into him, much more gentle than he usually is.
I'm writing the third chapter and my plan is that it will be the last chapter. Don't know when it'll be done. School has started again (on distance, of course) and I'm so freaking behind all of my school work.
Tony knows one of two statements is right.
In reality, Tony doesn't care his soulmates are who they are.
Tony hides in his workshop for two days after his fight with Rhodey.
Because Steve and Bucky are together and Tony can see the affection radiating from them.
No one does of course.
He dreams of flying, higher and higher, so high he can almost reach the sun, his wings taking him there.
He ignores their baffled looks, only tells Steve if they need help or anything, they can contact him by Jarvis.
He ignores the disappointed feeling in his chest.
So he shut up about it. After all, they were already dead. It didn't matter.
It was a dark green color, formed as a circle and another circle around it. Yinsen had it on on his right knee.
Tony has managed to create an arm to him like the one he had before, the only difference being that the new arm is covered by a material so it looks and feels more like skin. Bucky also tells him it feels more real and less like a metal piece stuck to his shoulder.
Sometimes, Tony gets the most ridicoulus ideas.
He's eaten four times. He thinks.
"No, I'm not okay."
Quarantine sucks.
He throws his coffee cup across the room. It shatters in thousands of pieces.
Not when he's down.
Tony has always been very good at lying.
He's so tired.
The scar that's left is a harsh reminder. Of what?
Tony has never felt this alone before.
Click.
Tony also knows Yinsen believed he could be different, do something good for the world. That he would do something great.
It's been a while since Tony talked to the others outside of missions.
CLICK.
It's nice.
He leaves 4 o'clock a thursday, after being awake for 28 hours and sleeping for 14 and he ignores his team calling after him.
He's just so
But he just can't bring himself to care anymore.
Thor goes to Asgard.
For now, he'll build whatever he sets his mind too, ideas always coming and going.
But this is completely different.)
He dreams of wings getting ripped off and falling, never landing.
He dreams of broken laughters and shouting and darkness and the sense of something closing in on him.
He stays in bed for 19 hours and doesn't bother to move.
He's paler, he notices when he looks into the mirror. Paler and thinner. His face is gaunt.
When Tony meets Steve Rogers, he doesn't say anything. He thinks for himself, that when the right time is, he will. But there is never a right time. Because Steve hates him, ranting about Howard and how Tony is not a hero. (Which is fair, because he isn't, not really).
He is always alone in darkness.
He feels too tired to keep up appearances around Steve and Bucky anymore.
Tony can still feel the water burning in his lungs and voices yelling in his ears in languages he doesn't understand.
He likes this dream.
He dreams of drowning and screaming, pain soaring through his body as he sees the rest of the Avengers staring motionless back at him.
Maybe he ripped her heart out too.
Tony wishes soulmarks didn't exist.
Why should he?
Tony wonders how Natasha, Clint and Phil makes it works.
When Tony was diagnosed with depression at age 14 and gave the doctor's note to Howard, he scoffed at him and paid the doctor to keep quiet.
good.
But that didn't mean he wasn't allowed to get hurt. So he got drunk and woke up with a headache. Nothing unusual.
Not when he's beaten down and crushed on the ground when he fights.
Tony watches again. He watches as Thor booms about Jane to anyone who will listen. He's practically beaming, saying there is no one else he would want to be with. Which is obvious, of course, since Jane is his soulmate and there's literally no one else he would be a better match for (in theory). Tony notices Clint rolling his eyes when Thor isn't watching and Natasha hitting him slightly on his head. Tony's eyes drift towards his wrist. He can't see it, but he knows Clint's soulmark is on his left wrist, a dark red, twisted line going around the wrist like a bracelet, with pointy thorns coming out from it. Tony knows Natasha has the exact same one on her ankle, although he's never seen it. He also knows Coulson has one around his right wrist.
Not when he's in a cave making bombs for criminals.
When Tony was 18 years old, he cut himself.
Tony doesn't know what he did to deserve her kindness, her care.
A part of him hopes they'll come and check up on him, even though they've fought, even though he knows it's stupid to hope. They're as equally stubborn as he is.
He has never gotten help. Not professional, at least.
He dreams of being scared and alone and hopeless and tired and hungry and...
This story will apparently be three chapters instead of two. Sorry!
Whatever relief he tried to find never came. Instead he could barely move, hand shaking when he lifted the knife and threw it in the trash bin, almost falling when he tried to stand up.
Tony doesn't care much about anything anymore.
Howard had said with a sneer to Jarvis. Tony hid behind the door to the kitchen, body heavy and mind dull as he listened to him.
He doesn't dwell on it too much.
WARNING: PLEASE READ THE TAGS. THIS DEALS WITH LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS.
Tony thinks of Obie when he gets drunk. He thinks of the trust he had for him, the respectful mask and confidence Obie always had. He thinks of Obie's black soulmark on his neck. He thinks of that one time Obie told him during one of his drunken ramblings that "she wasn't worth it".
The memories of his birthdays the last two years still hurts.
Tony can't help but smile when JARVIS talks to him.
Tony wishes he had died in that cave.
He's tired.
It's been a long time since Tony seen Pepper and Rhodey.
Now he can just hope he can go through the whole day without breaking.
It's been five months since Bucky moved into the tower.
He dreams about falling, falling and falling in darkness.
(He lied. He did cry. Out of frustration and confusion and shock.
Life, perhaps. But Tony doesn't have an excuse to be tired.
It ends with Tony crying helpless on the ground, hoping somebody would come. Anybody.
He wishes Yinsen could have gotten his happy ending.
It's getting harder to see the difference between his dreams and his everyday life.
There's simply no place for Tony. Never has been and never will be.
Then he can breathe, a sharp pain slicing through his body as air fills his lungs, his head killing him, body shaking from adrenaline and he's-
"Tony?"
He's too tired to care.
"Peppers and I are getting really worried. Please, just answer..."
Tony thinks about how his limbs feels like stones. About the soulmark. That he hasn't eaten in god knows how long. That he feels alone. That he is
Click.
Tony doesn't ask who brought him up to his room.
His hands are sore and his arms are tired, but his mind is focused on the devices in his hands.
His heart still beats twice as fast when he thinks back at the conversation.
), doesn't stop (
Tony doesn't know how he will manage to lie about his soulmark for his entire life.
If it was not for the fact he that has so many ideas, too curious to find out if he can build it, fix it, make something new, revolutionary, he might have tested the theory.
Until he was stupid enough to destory everything (
He doesn't know.
Bruce asks why and Tony says he has a lot to do in his own workshop.
Tony swallows.
Tony takes his coffee and goes to his workshop, telling the rest of the team he'll be downstairs and fix the things they broke this time in their last fight, which wouldn't have been a lie if he hadn't fixed that yesterday.
) times when they couldn't deal with him and there were (
Not when he was a child.
Call him dramatic, but he's never coped with feelings well.
He shouldn't be surprised, after all.
He doesn't initiate conversations.
Rhodey doesn't have a soulmark.
Tony wishes the robot hadn't.
“Okay, deal. You have your year, Mad Eye Moody. I’ll plan to come check the place out in six months or so. Be ready to dazzle me.”
“I don’t want to talk about it, Bucky. End of subject. Forever.”
“The best ones are generally a little quirky,” Clint explained. “All three of the ones I just showed you are well on the way to being fantastic race horses. But if you’re looking for an uncomplicated, knows-his-job kind of thoroughbred, here’s your guy.”
He remembered more kisses, Steve becoming bolder as the night went on. And he remembered Bucky telling them to get a room, because he wasn’t interested in watching them fuck right there in the bar.
Tony was nodding as Nick talked, easily able to see his father’s fingerprints all over the explanation. His dad had always wanted success immediately, and was hugely impatient with anyone that he didn’t feel was helping him reach his goals. It was one of the major reasons that he and Tony had never gotten along – Tony hadn’t been willing to fit himself into Howard’s very narrow ideas of success.
And suddenly, there he was, swaggering and smiling, looking disheveled and like he’d also had too much to drink. Tony looked at Bucky, taking in his lazy sprawl and his bedroom eyes, and Steve could see his interest peaking.
In the mornings, Steve knew exactly where to be and what to do. As an exercise rider, his job was to get on the horses that he’d been assigned to, and work them to the exact specifications of the trainer. On a good morning, Steve would ride seven or eight horses, starting at 6am and finishing before lunch. On not as great mornings, Steve would only ride three or four horses, and then spend time hustling the backside of the track looking for trainers that needed a rider. Either way, he knew what he needed to do.
