He wanted adventure, excitement, thrills. He wanted the blood pumping through his veins, making his very breath come out in shaky excitement. He wanted to help, to feel useful, to feel needed. But more than that, he wanted to share his wants with someone who also wanted the same things. He wanted to know that he could have a "partner in crime" of sorts. Someone who would be right by his side as he tried to catch his breath, and perhaps even take his breath away. He glanced over and saw Molly still eyeing him. He wanted so badly to reveal his inner feelings, but found he couldn't make his mouth move. A voice in his head told him that it would be a bad idea if he said anything.
"You see, John," Sherlock continued, "I had gotten used to being shagged on a regular basis. It was almost like you were training me. When I heard you come home, I would instantly become hard and the throbbing between my legs was intolerable. It was the same when I thought about you, at all hours of the day and night. My mind would work up these wonderful fantasies about you and different positions, toys and even having sex in public places where we could get caught with your cock inside me. I miss you filling me up, I miss your powerful thrusts and the wickedly naughty things you would whisper in my ear as you made me moan and cry your name out in spine tingling ecstasy. That's one place where the pain is."
Sherlock cleared his throat, but didn't reply. The rumble came again. John looked down at Sherlock's stomach. "Sherlock, was that your stomach? Are you hungry?"
"Not a chance, you were up there way too long! John, I'm just trying to help you."
Lestrade had left, frustrated that Sherlock had belittled him again, but wasn't surprised. Since John had left, Sherlock had gotten a little worse. He was snappy, borderline bitchy, and he was almost desperate for a case. He constantly texted the DI, asking if there was anything new, anything old that he could maybe take a look through to see if there was anything different that jumped out at him. Lestrade had been annoyed, until he realized why Sherlock was acting this way. He was lonely. John was gone, and he was still having a hard time trying to function without him. He had been as accommodating as he could, but the criminals weren't just up to par. Lestrade shoved his hands in his coat pocket as he got closer to his car. Only a few more months and John would be home. Then everything would be okay. Lestrade started the car then sped away, back to New Scotland Yard with the new information that Sherlock had given him.
Mycroft drummed his fingers on the table, waiting while his phone call was yet again bounced around from person to person. Phil was almost as hard to reach as Mycroft himself was. His teeth ground together as his assistant answered the phone. When Mycroft told her his name, she sputtered and he heard her rush around, trying to locate Phil. He rubbed his eyes as he waited.
"Bad day, was it?" John turned his head and gave a small smile to his friend, Molly. The female octopus swam up beside him, her eight tentacles easily keeping up with the movement of John's tail. Her bright gaze eyed him curiously.
*~~~~~~~~~~*
Sherlock gasped and bit his lip. Such a small gesture was making him harder than he could remember ever being. John released his finger and moved his tongue all over Sherlock's hand, stopping to press his lips against his palm. Sherlock's cock twitched more forcefully, dangerously close to coming in his trousers. He groaned and tried to pull John closer. He couldn't come like this, and tried to pull John up so he could catch his breath. Before he could, Sherlock was pushed to his back on the grotto floor and felt John's weight slide onto him. His mouth was plundered by John's seeking tongue, wrestling with his while John's fingers snaked into his hair. The light tug John gave had him gasping and turning his head to the side. John attacked his throat, licking behind his ear and sucking at the junction where his neck met his shoulder.
Sherlock widened his eyes.
John swam forward, catching a struggling Sherlock by the chest. He pushed him forward, back to the surface. They broke, and Sherlock greedily sucked in the air. John helped him sit on the lip of the rock, and pulled himself up to sit beside him. John stroked Sherlock's back as he regained his breath. He smiled shyly. "You jumped in after me?"
John smiled brightly. "Promise."
He had gotten so used to someone sleeping beside him, and when John went to serve his country, Sherlock found it incredibly difficult to sleep. He would wake up at odd hours, reaching out for the shorter man, trying to catch his scent or feel the softness of his hair. He caught a few naps here and there, somehow fitting his long and lanky form into John's chair, hugging the Union Jack pillow and wishing with all of his might that it was John. Sweet, caring, John. His blue eyes would look up at him, reflecting all of the love that the consulting detective found difficult to believe that anyone could feel for him, even after all of their time together. Even when John got upset that Sherlock went for days without eating or sleeping, and when he threw a fuss and forced him to at least sit down for a few moments, Sherlock felt the fierce love and devotion that John had for him, wishing that he knew of a way to show John how much he was loved in return. Eating and sleeping didn't really do the trick, and most of the time Sherlock over thought things and ended up making a mess of the situation. He shuddered at the thought of the Valentine's Day fiasco.
"I don't have that right now. I need to know what happened to a soldier. When will you know for sure?"
Sherlock grinned and picked up the pillow. "Today it was only twenty minutes late. You're getting better."
Sherlock set the phone down on the side table, like John asked, and took his nipples in his hands. He tweaked them, gasping at how sensitive they had become. The need to be shagged, no, fucked, slammed into him and he thrust his hips into the air. He let out a small moan as continued to roll his nipples between his fingers.
"Someone very important to my family is part of that regiment. I just wanted some information to pass along." He rubbed a hand through his immaculately combed hair and sighed. He had already asked Anthea that he needed a car to take him to Sherlock. Mummy had always stressed the importance of family in a crisis and he also felt some strange pull to go to him. "Thank you, Phil." He disconnected the call, not wanting to hear the fake well wishing or false sympathy. He didn't have time for either. He grabbed his umbrella and made for the door.
John would be home within the next three days.
"Oh, dear. It-it's about John."
Sherlock's back arched when he felt John's hand touch his cock. The air left his lungs as the hand slowly started pumping up and down, using the precome pooling at the top to lubricate the way. Sherlock wound his fingers into John's hair, tugging lightly, trying to pull him up for a kiss. John had other ideas. As Sherlock tugged on his hair, John darted his tongue out and gave a lick from root to tip.
Mycroft reached out and grasped his arm. "Sherlock, please breath. John is, well..." He cleared his throat. "Sherlock, John is very injured. He was shot in the shoulder. He's still touch and go." He didn't want to tell Sherlock everything, but he also felt that he had a right to know.
"So, it was up to me to determine how long the milk had been left on the counter, and once I had, it led me to the murderer. But enough about me, John. I want to hear about you." The edginess he was feeling melted away as John started talking about what they had been up to for the past week. Moving equipment, doing patrols. Dull. But, he liked hearing John talk. His voice, while not as low as his own, was soothing. Sherlock gripped the pillow as John's voice washed over him.
John heard Sherlock moaning as he pinched his nipples. The sound made his hips thrust, his cock sliding up and down in his hand. He desperately wanted to be there, sucking Sherlock's cock as he made those delicious little moans. John moaned. "How does that feel Sherlock? Tell me how that feels."
Sherlock inhaled sharply. John had promised phone sex the last time they had spoken, and it sounded like he was about to deliver. He cock hardened slightly. He willed his body to take it slow so he could savor how John was planning on taking him there. "Perhaps."
The tears rolled unchecked down his cheeks as he sobbed against his love's hand. He babbled nonsense words until his voice cracked, and even then, he clutched John's hand like the lifeline it was.
Images of John floated through his mind. John smiling, John laughing. John's eyes bright with excitement and his breath coming out in huffs as they chased a criminal through the streets of London. John moaning and groaning as Sherlock buried his cock deep inside John's arse. John coming. John in his arms as they wrapped around each other in the post-orgasmic fog.
Sherlock groaned, his hands scrabbling to curl around John's shoulders. He had never been so aroused so quickly before and his head was spinning. John tugged at his shirt, trying to undo buttons while nibbling on his earlobe. Sherlock gave a breathless laugh and tried to help him with shaky fingers.
"Of course I have, don't be daft. My mother was quite fond of her fairy tales when I was younger. But that's all they are: fairy tales."
Sherlock shouted and bucked his hips, earning a satisfied groan from John. John bobbed his head, running his tongue along the smooth, hot skin, tasting the salty flesh, listening to Sherlock fall apart above him. He pulled off of Sherlock with an audible pop and moved his hand up and down the shaft, and suddenly deciding to play dirty, started massaging his prostate from the outside. Sherlock was practically sobbing, frantically thrusting towards his finish.
Sorry for the wait, everyone. General craziness is abundant in my life, apparently. As usual, any comments or critiques welcome :)
"What do you wish to know?"
Sherlock's hand squeezed around his own cock, pistoning himself between John's cock and his own fist. He felt the tingle starting in his balls, moving up to tighten in stomach, then explode outward as the orgasm swamped his body. He cried out, arching his back as he shot his come all over John's stomach. John cried out and followed soon after, coming deep inside Sherlock's convulsing arse. Sherlock collapsed onto John, coating them both in sweat and come.
John blushed a bit. "I, ah, sometimes peek onto boats to try and find out more about humans, and, I've.....seen some things before."
When they slept, Sherlock curled around him, clutching him as tight as he was able. Sometimes he lay his head over John's heart, but mostly he lay his hand over it. Reminding himself that it was beating, that John was back here with him, alive and for the most part, well. John sometimes woke up, screaming and in a cold sweat. Sometimes he barked orders, sometimes he pleaded with someone to just make the pain go away, sometimes he called out for Sherlock. The barking orders he could handle, but when Sherlock heard John cry out for him, or for anyone to just make his pain stop, that was what broke Sherlock's heart, over and over again. He would stroke John's hair, murmur in his ear, sweet nothings and soothing words mostly. He would wrap his arms around his lanky frame, rock him as he waited for the trembeling to stop.
"Jesus, Sherlock," John moaned, closing his eyes. Listening to that had made John unbearably hard. He could picture it perfectly, having sex with Sherlock in an incredibly public place that added the very real possibility of getting caught. Making love with Sherlock in their shared bed, listening to his lover moan and groan his name as he pleasured him for hours on end. He had imagined all sorts of new positions he wanted to try with Sherlock when he got home and knowing Sherlock was thinking the same things was enough to drive him wild.
"It's been two bloody days. Surely someone knows something?"
"No, John. It wasn't enough. I don't want to have sex over the phone with you. I want you here, in our bed, making love with me."
Sherlock eyed him. "Is that so? Well, I'm told that I have never been the most polite person."
Sherlock's hand shook as he ran a finger down the golden brown tail. John tensed up and bit his lip, but made no sound. Sherlock flattened his palm and ran it up and down. When he was expecting the fin to be rough and scaly, it was unbelievably smooth and soft. John made a noise, a soft noise, that had Sherlock's head snapping up. That was a moan. Soft as it was, there was no denying that John had just moaned as he stroked his tail. Sherlock's cock twitched.
Molly had so far been the only creature that wanted to spend time with him, and he was sure she felt she had some sort to obligation to him, because he had saved her by cutting her out of a human's fishing net. Somehow, that made the hurt worse. It made him feel like he was so repulsive and undesirable that someone would only like him if they felt like they were obligated to. He turned over in the water, gazing up at the surface, slowing his movements to a lazy paddle to watch the sunlight dance through the water. He had convinced himself long ago that he was content with his solitude. He reasoned that it was a good thing he didn't have to rely on anyone for anything, or be accountable to someone. He was free to do whatever he wanted and go anywhere he pleased with no one caring what he was doing at any given moment. He was free for the rest of his life...free.
"Sherlock, you need to see a doctor," John insisted, "you could be having-"
John was also trying to catch his breath, but for a different reason. The man was, putting it lightly, beautiful. And even that was an understatement. His dark curly hair complimented his pale, nearly translucent skin. His cheekbones were high, and looked ridiculously sharp, but it gave him a look of royalty and elegance. He was lean, leaner than John, who had always been teased for being on the thin side of their merfolk spectrum. This man was captivating, and John was entranced. He bit his lip and lightly reached out to stroke the man's cheek as his breath returned. He had been right about his cheekbones. The man leaned into his touch and let out a small sigh. His eyes blinked open and John felt a moment of panic. He shouldn't let this human see him, he should get out of sight. But when John saw the man's eyes, their color and the brightness in them, he couldn't bring himself to move. The man opened his mouth to speak, and that's when he felt one of Molly's tentacles wrap around where his body met his fin and pull him down below the surface.
"Mycroft...I don't know."
A week went by and still, no one had heard anything about John. Mycroft was getting desperate. Despite his reputation as the "Iceman," Mycroft was worried and visibly so. It was starting to unnerve everyone around him. He had set up round the clock surveillance on Sherlock, and made sure someone always had eyes, to make sure that he didn't do anything drastic. Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson gave constant attention to the depressed detective, but he still continued to lose weight, and lose interest in everything: the work, the experiments, his life. He hadn't said more than a handful of words or eaten more than a few mouthfuls of food in over a week. Mycroft was buzzing with nervous energy. He knew that Sherlock had lost his will, and was soon going to lose everything unless he found John.
*~~~~~~~~~~*
He heard a snort. "With all of your inside men, you don't know what's happening? Give me a break. Mycroft."
"John? Are you there?"
John smiled. "Of course. That was more satisfying than the jerk off session I gave myself last week. How are you?"
Sherlock's eyes widened and his breath left him in a rush. Shot? Touch and go? Sherlock felt dizzy. His John, his everything, shot? He felt Mycroft push him into a chair and ask a faceless person for some water. Sherlock took a deep breath as the water was pushed into his hands.
He looked to John's face, noticing that his eyes were twitching, indicating coming out of a deep rest. Hope bloomed in his chest as he squeezed John's hand. A squeeze back. John's eyelids peeked open, just a little, but enough that he made eye contact. The scratchy, soft voice was like music to his ears.
Mrs. Hudson fed him.
Phil sighed. "Mycroft, I have nothing. It's only been two days. We're still trying to reestablish connections. You have got to give me more time."
"Is it true? What they're saying on the telly?"
Sherlock took his eyes off of the man, John, and shook his head, trying to clear the fuzziness. He was starting to feel just a tad too warm, despite the coolness of the rock he was sitting on. Sherlock clutched his head and shook it again. "Where am I?" He demanded.
"I'm here, John."
Sherlock, hastily dressed, eyes wild and hair no less so, burst into Mycroft's office. Mycroft, expecting him, stood and tried to speak, but Sherlock beat him to it.
John felt the blush creeping up his neck to flood his cheeks. The way Sherlock was looking at him made his heart and stomach do somersaults. When Sherlock leaned in for another kiss, John accepted with a smile. When Sherlock lowered his head, nipping on John's neck, his hands reaching towards John's nipples, a loud rumble echoed throughout the grotto. Being so close, John felt the heat coming from Sherlock's face. John pulled back, eyes searching.
"Bad news out of Afghanistan this evening as we have learned that the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers have come under heavy fire. We don't know much as of now, but we do know that there was a series of Semtex explosions. Other units in the area are unavailable to reach the Fusiliers, and all communications have been lost. The British Government are in the process of trying to reestablish a connection as we speak. Officials are asking that any family members of these soldiers please hold all calls and instead report to..." Sherlock didn't finish the broadcast as he had fallen to his knees, hearing a loud buzzing in his ears. His blood had run cold, the numbness now completely overtaking him. His vision blacked out as he sank further onto the floor.
Sherlock's stomach dropped to his knees as his head shot up. He took in her face, the look in her eyes. Shock, fear, a small glimmer of hope through the tears in them. He swallowed.
"He needs air!" He shouted at her.
John inhaled and bit his lip. He knew Sherlock liked being commanded as much as John liked commanding, but hearing Sherlock disobey like that drove him crazy. He adjusted himself on the wall, trying in vain to ignore the erection straining against the zipper of his pants. "God, you have no idea what you do to me. I love you, Sherlock Holmes. More than any words in any language could express."
*~~~~~~~~~~*
"I know!" She shouted back. "It's a grotto with an air pocket! Hurry!" John propelled them through the water and into the entrance. He broke the surface of the grotto and laid the man down on a rock. He wasn't breathing. John turned him over on his side and began to pound the man's back. He may have swallowed a good amount of water, and was hoping his heart was in the same place as the merfolks', so he could try and start it again.
John sighed. "Sherlock, please tell me that you were at least polite to him? I'm not there to play safety guard you know."
Sherlock closed his eyes and let the warmth he felt at John's words wash over him. "And I love you, John Watson. More than anything in this, or any, world."
Sherlock sat up, though his arms shook a bit. That had been an incredibly intense orgasm, far better than any he had given himself over the last few months. "Where did you learn to do that?"
He grabbed the Union Jack pillow and hugged it tight to his chest, heart clenching and tears streaming down his face.
Even though Sherlock knew that John was safe at home, Sherlock hovered over him insistently. He didn't let John out of his sight, terrified of leaving him on his own for more than a few minutes. He knew that he was being insufferable, that he was being very overprotective, but look at what had happened when they had been seperated. He watched at John constantly. As he ate, as he drank his tea, as he read the paper, but most often as he slept.
John smirked at the cracking. He had practically screamed when he came, and it made John ridiculously proud that he had done that to someone, and that they had actually enjoyed it. "Are you always this articulate after an orgasm?"
Sherlock shoved his hand down his pajama bottoms and pulled his cock out. It was now fully erect and throbbing. He needed release, and he needed to hear John's voice as he came. But even he wouldn't dare cross Captain Watson.
Sherlock was about to offer a rebuttal, but when John only said his name, he was flabbergasted. "Yes?" He offered weakly.
Sherlock grinned. "Well, I think I may have dirtied your chair, and caused a rather embarrassing stain on the floor, but otherwise, fine."
It was while he was out on that patrol, however, that the shit had officially met the fan.
"I missed you too, love. It's wonderful to hear your voice." John had smiled when he heard Sherlock ask him what had taken so long. They had intel that said there was going to be an attack soon, so the higher ups had ordered them to move it along. They had taken everything apart and moved as ordered, and it had taken them a little while to get everything situated. He had worried constantly that Sherlock was freaking out, scared, and it made John upset. He didn't want to be so far away, but he felt it was his duty. He thought about Sherlock all the time, and had regretted missing their phone call. "Don't worry, Sherlock. We got some info that we were going to need to relocate for better helicopter access and it just took us a little longer than usual to get situated." He hated lying to Sherlock, but didn't want him to worry any more than he already was. "I'm fine, Sherlock. Perfectly fine. How are you holding up?"
He watched as the color drained out of his world. He felt the warmth leave his body, leaving nothing but a cold, empty shell.
excited. But when he looked downwards to check him out, he had been flabbergasted. He had no legs. Instead, there was a long, brown, shining tail. He reached out to touch, but drew his hand back when John flinched. Without making eye contact, John motioned for him to touch his fin.
"You are exactly three days, six hours, and forty minutes late calling me. What happened? Are you alright?" Sherlock silently cursed himself. He had wanted to start out with something lovey dovey, or heaven forbid, sexy, but hearing John's voice, after their usual appointment on the phone had been missed, reminded him that they were thousands of miles apart. Not hearing from John was.....torture. It made Sherlock nervous when he went too long without talking to John. His mind palace had a secret, heavily locked door that was full of all the scenarios of what could happen to John in Afghanistan. Bombings, terrorist attacks, surprise ambushes, or even being a victim of friendly fire. He heard John chuckle and was brought back to the conversation at hand.
"Not until I see John. Where is he? Is he alright? Mycroft, tell me where John is!"
John threw his head back against the wall. He was really starting to regret ever starting this. He wanted to be in their flat, fucking Sherlock until he couldn't walk. He wanted to taste Sherlock's cock in his mouth, taking him so deep that it hit the back of his throat. He wanted so badly to feel Sherlock buck and writhe against him as he came. He just had to make do with his hand. "Keep one nipple in your hand and take your cock in the other. I'm so close, and I need you to come with me. Now, Sherlock."
Sherlock saw John struggling and tried to swim faster. The octopus had a few tentacles wrapped around him. He had no weapon, but was filled with a surprising amount of rage. Though they hadn't known each other for very long, Sherlock felt oddly protective of his newfound companion. He started tugging on the tentacle wrapped around John's waist, trying desperately to free his John. He heard John shouting, but was too full of possessiveness to make out words.
She unwrapped her tentacle from around John. In truth, the man frightened her. A lot. She darted down, away from John and the man.
"Mr. Holmes?"
Sherlock bit his lip. "I have this ache. These two aches, actually."
Sherlock scoffed and inspected the boat again. "I should like to join you on your outing today captain, if it isn't too much trouble, of course." Sherlock batted his eyelashes at the men, knowing full well they couldn't refuse him. Without waiting for a response, he climbed into the boat, sat down, crossed his long legs, and waited. The men glanced at their captain, who then began barking out orders to find extra food, and another life jacket, which Sherlock refused to wear, then they set sail.
"It's time for our cleaning duties, so I have to go. Bloody awful timing, too. I hate to get off the phone after hearing that from you."
"I know, I know. But, I can't help but think that she is right. I am ordinary. Even my tail is ordinary, I'm boring. No one wants to talk to me, no one ever wants to socialize with me. I'm just too...dull." He felt a pang of sadness go through him. The words rang true, but that didn't mean it hurt any less. His sister was right: he was just too boring. Earlier, she had laughed at his jealous expression when she was leaving to go out with her friends, and delivered the harsh words with a smile. John and Harriet had never really got on, but that didn't give her the excuse to be so cruel.
He heard the DI sigh. "Not good. Can't get him to do a damn thing. Hasn't said a word, except to snap at us when we try to clean up. Any word on John?"
John was at the edge of his rope. Sherlock had been acting strange....well, stranger than usual. He had been unusually patient and attentive. And while John had appreciated and had basked in it while he knew it was going to last, there was something missing. While he had been healing, there hadn't been any sexual contact of any kind. He had craved the feeling of sweaty skin against his own, of hearing the heavy panting and deep moaning in his ear as he thrust his cock in and out of Sherlock's tight heat. But he was mostly missing the intimacy. He had missed Sherlock so much during his time in the military, and he had been hoping that when he was healed enough that he and Sherlock could share some sexy time, but he was two weeks after he was given the okay for strenuous activity, and Sherlock hadn't made any sort of move on him at all. He was getting desperate. The wanks he had been given himself in his seldom private moments were unsatisfying at best.  His balls were bluer than the ocean.
The captain shrugged again. "You hear stories every now and again of someone coming in off of the water and raving about magical mermaids who sang to them or saved their life or something like that. Wouldn't mind having a look at one myself."
"Mrs. Hudson! I don't want to hear about my brother. Whatever he and his fat arse want, I don't care."
Sherlock watched the figure disappear and felt a wave of anxiety course through him. He scrambled up as quickly as his fuzzy head would allow without him vomiting, and peered over the edge. He didn't see any blood staining the surface, but it was too dark in...wherever they were to really see below the surface. He wanted the figure to come back, to ask it where he was and how he could get home. But more than that, Sherlock didn't want to be alone. As he strained his eyes to try and see farther below the surface, a face bobbed up and almost knocked heads with him. He let out a gasp as did the other figure.
Sherlock held his breath.
Mycroft clenched his hand on the phone. "Not good enough. You know."
And as the hours stretched on, and still nothing from John, Sherlock's anxiety went through the roof. Something was wrong. John wouldn't forget their "date." Out of the two of them, Sherlock was the more likely to forget. Sherlock practically threw his laptop onto the couch, got up and paced. He ran his hands through his hair, pulling and tugging his curls. His heart rate was accelerating at an alarming rate, even for him. He paced by a lamp. and in a sudden flux in his frustration level, he knocked it onto the floor.
"You've never heard of a mermaid before?"
"This had better be important, Mycroft. What is it?"
John wiped his eyes. "All I can say is that I feel that same way. I miss you. I miss hearing your voice everyday, or you playing the violin. I miss holding you in the night, and waking up to you every morning. I miss the way you call everyone an idiot, believe it or not. I just plain miss you. You're the missing piece of my heart."
The captain blushed slightly and shrugged. "We weren't going to go much farther than a couple of leagues, and the camera is for tryin' to catch a glimpse of a mermaid."
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock tightened his grip and shouted. He threw his head back on John's chair and screwed his eyes shut. He was so close. "It's so tight, sir. So tight." He continued to stroke, running his thumb over the opening of his cock, using the pre-come as a lubricant. Every time his thumb ran over the slit, he pinched his nipple, and the pleasure was overwhelming.
"I warn you, I'm in no mood for games. What happened?"
John's fingers dug into his hips, helping him bounce harder on his cock. Sherlock was making the most pornographic songs that he had ever heard and it served to heighten John's arousal. He felt the tightening in his stomach. "Touch yourself, Sherlock," he ordered, "I want to feel you squeeze my cock and I want  to feel your come on me. Do it."
No laughter, no love, no feeling at all.
That's all he was. A shell.
*~~~~~~~~~~*
"Yes, John, but not soon enough."
"Sher.....lock."
dipping his tongue into his naval. Sherlock panted heavily, threading his fingers into John's hair, coaxing him downward. John grinned and went lower, swallowing Sherlock down in one go.
"Oh, Sherlock! Sherlock, your-your brother, he-he"
John sniffed again and took a shaky breath. "Yes, I'm here. Sherlock....that was..."
Sherlock came to with a heavy thumping on his back, and just when he thought the firm hand was going to crack his spine, he vomited up an incredible amount of sea water. He rolled onto his back and struggled to catch his breath. He felt a hand stoking his cheek. It was very light, almost hesitant, and he leaned lightly into the touch and the hand continued its gentle stroking. His vision was blurry, but he could distinctly make out a form, a man going by his supposed shoulder width. He assumed it was one of his guards. As he drew breath to speak and ask where he was and how long he had been out, the figure suddenly slipped below his vision.
John sped up too. "Sherlock, fuck, Sherlock, Sherlock. NOW!" The orgasm slammed into John like a truck. He went rigid as the pleasure swamped through him. He bit his lip, wishing more than anything that he could scream with his orgasm, but instead allowing a small moan to slip out.
"Have you been a naughty boy?"
"You think I haven't exhausted all possible leads, Lestrade? That I am just sitting here on my arse eating cake all day?" Mycroft snapped the words out with more venom than he anticipated. He took a steadying breath. "Apologies."
Sherlock shuddered. "Yes, Captain. I wish you were here so you could be inside me, thrusting deep until you hit that sweet spot that makes me scream."
John, alarmed by the sudden change in mood, sat up, inspecting Sherlock for some sort of wound. "Sherlock? Did I hurt you? Shit, I'm sorry. I just wanted to feel you and-"
"Sherlock please, take a breath."
"Who's an idiot? I wasn't going to do anything more than say a few words to him! Geez, calm down and let me go!" He tried clawing at her grip, but she just continued to tighten it against his abdomen.
"As do I, John, but I know that the cleaning needs to happen."
He then took a good look at the man, as he now saw that it was indeed a man, and felt an unfamiliar feeling flow through his veins. The man had sandy blond hair that had water running out of it and onto his shoulders. His eyes were a deep blue, just like the sapphires in his mother's crown and had these adorable crinkles at the edge of them. Sherlock shook his head. Adorable? Since when do I use words like 'adorable?' His gaze traveled down the sun-kissed skin, the broadness of the man's shoulders. His muscles were lean, but Sherlock sensed the power beneath them. Sherlock's mouth watered a little when he thought about those muscles rippling beneath his mouth as he trailed his tongue... he shook the thought away. The other man had opened his mouth and was trying to say something.
John's heart broke, but sweetly. "Sherlock. I wish I could be there. Soon, though."
John cocked his head. "Sherlock? When I breached the surface, those men in the boat were calling for 'Your Highness.' Is Sherlock a nickname?"
Mycroft hung up the phone with a decisive click, rubbing his eyes as he did so. He sat back in his chair and sipped his drink. John was on his way home, as long as he stayed stable for the next forty-eight hours.
Mycroft adjusted his lapels. "Unfortunately, yes. You seem frightened." He said it as fact, as she was used to people coming straight to the point with her.
Sorry for the wait, everyone. But this went through 3 drafts that didn't feel right. I know it's short, but the next one will be a doozy. Enjoy :)
"Thank you. Any new  cases?" John slid along the wall of the small equipment room and pressed his back against it as he listened to Sherlock talk. He was exhausted. Cleaning duty had doubled since a few of the other men had come down with a serious case of pneumonia. Not to mention the extra patrol duty and setting up the new equipment. When he heard Sherlock's voice, though, his exhaustion had just melted away.
"FUCK!" Sherlock's hips bucked, feeling John's mouth envelop his cock in a tight warm heat. "Oh God, John, what are you-fuck-fuck-fucking YES!" John's tongue swirled around the tip, lapping up the liquid and swallowing around it. He flattened his tongue on the red glans and sucked him deeper into his mouth until the tip bumped against the back of his throat. His hand started slowly pumped up and down, milking him while his mouth continued to bob up and down.
"Ah, I'm, well...ah...." John found himself staring into the grey green eyes and finding himself at a loss for words. The man eyed him curiously, roaming over his shoulders, his face. John felt strange as he felt
He stared at the shards, feeling the numbness creeping up on him. He bit his lip and picked up the television remote. He slapped it against his palm before he switched it on. He repeatedly chanted to himself "please be okay" over and over as he looked for the channel he needed. When he found it, the bottom banner scrolling across the bottom of the screen had his vision tunneling and his heart stopping. Breaking News From Afghanistan.....
"The second, and most consistent source of pain, is in my heart."
"Yes."
John was dizzy with arousal. Sherlock's moans were encouraging him to move on, to try and give this gorgeous man more pleasure. He felt nails dig into his back and moaned into Sherlock's neck. He tasted salty and sweet at the same time. He slid the shirt off of Sherlock, and felt the muscles bunch under his tongue as he ran it down the shoulder, down his chest and sucked a nipple into his mouth. He swirled it around his tongue, delighting in Sherlock's sharp gasps. He lightly took it in between his teeth and tugged it this way and that, while his fingers tugged at the other one. Sherlock's fingers dug into his shoulder blades as the moans came out of his mouth like a cascading waterfall. Sherlock began panting his name as John continued to lick and suckle across his chest, down to lick his navel. He fought with the trousers for a moment, desperate to get to the ultimate prize, and pulled them forcefully down Sherlock's legs. This...other garment was still in his way. It was thinner than the trousers were, and it only covered what John was seeking. John stared at this garment quizzically before hooking his fingers on the top of them and tugging them down. The cock bobbed freely, leaking against Sherlock's stomach and nearly purple with Sherlock's arousal, making John drool with his desire to taste it. He cautiously reached out to touch.
"I know you didn't mean it. I would be just as frustrated if I were you. It's just.....I know what John meant to Sherlock. John was good for him. I just don't want to see Sherlock go down that road again."
Sherlock blinked at the bluntness of the question. "Yes, though the proper term would be 'oral sex.' Where did you learn how to do that?"
"Yes, well, he," she gestured upstairs, "there's been an awful lot of racket coming from there. He was screaming for a while. From what I heard, I didn't think it would be wise to go in there. The whole street heard him. Why, Mrs. Turner next door called and said that she-"
Sherlock wanted to keep his eyes open, but the pleasure was too overwhelming. His eyes clenched shut as John continued to deep throat him and tug at his balls, while the other hand continued to pump up and down as John started moving faster. Sherlock tightened his hand in John's hair. His belly quivered and he felt his balls tighten in John's grip. "John-I'm gonna come...I need to...John, if you don't stop....please, FUCK!" Sherlock came with a loud roar, echoing off the grotto walls and back to his ears. He shot out his come into John's mouth, growling when he felt John swallow around him. He moaned and groaned as John continued to suck.
"Hello, Detective Inspector. How is he?"
John pushed him down on the bed, licking into his mouth and tweaking his nipples. Sherlock was being reduced to a quivering, moaning mess on the sheets. John licked his way down Sherlocks' neck, his chest,
"How'd I do this time?"
Freeing his arms, Sherlock pushed away from the sink and dragged John behind him, practically running to their bedroom.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock's eyes narrowed. John was more than willing to please him, but he did a complete 180 when it came to his own needs. He didn't want to be pleasured? But the signs that he was turned on were there, so maybe he just didn't want Sherlock to...? He shook his head, and the thoughts away. Sherlock scooted closer to him and opened his mouth to ask again, but before he could, a tentacle shot out of the water, wrapped around John's waist and pulled him under.
Sherlock, while he was curious to find out, never let the thought slip pass the "idea" phase. He did like the captain, to an extent of course, and he did his job rather well.
John struggled in Molly's grasp once again. "Molly, let me go!"
While Sherlock was staring off at nothing, and subsequently not paying attention, a rather large wave hit their boat, causing the occupants to shift. Sherlock had time to let out a small gasp as he was thrown into the air before landing in the water with a huge splash. He heard muffled shouting, but he had hit the water harder than expected, and he felt himself growing fuzzy. He tried listening for a neighboring splash, to indicate one of the guards had jumped in after him, but the fuzziness continued. He finally felt hands grab him and propel him forward as his vision faded to black.
Sherlock sighed and picked up the remote. As he did, his mobile rang from his desk. Sherlock was across the room in an instant, snatching up the phone. He saw the name and instantly his heart started racing, butterflies flitting about in his stomach. He answered the call.
Sherlock stared at John, cock twitching. That moan was so soft yet so passionate that all Sherlock wanted to do was keep hearing it over and over again. He was absolutely positive that the sound alone could make him come. He wanted to approach John to hear it again, but he was giving off the vibe of 'please don't come near me right now.' He was shy, painfully shy, but that was probably brought on by the years of self esteem issues he was clearly suffering from. Someone had hurt his self esteem.. He clearly wanted Sherlock to get off the topic of him moaning at the tail touching, so he would oblige until they could circle back around to it more comfortably.
Sherlock took what he felt like was the millionth trip through his castle. He was so completely and utterly
They both got off the phone that evening, huge smiles adorning their faces as they thought about each other.
Mycroft had already texted John's room number so Sherlock could just go straight there. When he reached the room, taking a moment to catch his breath, he hesitated as his fingers brushed the door handle. The thought of seeing John this wounded made his stomach flip, and Sherlock had to swallow and take a deep breath before he could open the door. He stepped inside, allowing his eyes a moment to adjust. His gaze rested on the form lying in the bed, hooked up to what seemed like a dozen machines. His breath caught as his eyes narrowed in on the bandages around John's torso. His arm was in a sling, face deathly pale underneath the mask that was assisting in delivering the oxygen to his lungs. His face, neck and hands were covered in bruises and scrapes. His frame looked too thin, and he definately had lost some muscle mass. He looked like a shell. A shell with his lovers' face.
The weeks had dragged on, and with their phone conversations becoming more and more sporadic, the weeks had seemed longer. John and Sherlock hadn't been able to talk on the phone for a while, and even his bones ached from missing his detective. He had heard the pout and worry in Sherlock's voice when John had mentioned that their phone calls would have to wait for  a while. He knew Sherlock worried, and bloody hell, sometimes John worried about himself too. But he did his best to reassure Sherlock that all would be back to its usual self before too long. Sherlock didn't like it, but he had accepted it.
"Where is he? Where's John? She said you found him, so where is he? Mycroft, where is John?"
God, he wanted a cigarette. He refrained, as he had made a promise to John that he wouldn't smoke, but the old itch of wanting one in stressful times was crawling on his skin.
Sherlock's heart skipped a beat. "I don't."
*~~~~~~~~~~*
He picked up the phone and threw it across the room, hearing it clatter to the floor. He crawled into John's chair, wrapping his dressing gown closer around his thinner frame and curled in on himself on the chair. Through the open door, the one that Mycroft had had removed due to his concern of a relapse, he heard Mrs. Hudson's phone ring downstairs. He rolled his eyes and burrowed deeper into the chair. He heard a slamming door, feet pound up the stairs, and winded breathing.
"We have contact again." Phil.
"Are you out, Sherlock?"
"John, will you allow me to return the favor?" He wasn't entirely sure how to make the merman come, as he couldn't see any sort of genitalia, but he wanted to have John walk him through it. He wanted to show John the amount of satisfaction that he himself had just received.
What the fuck was he supposed to do without John?
*~~~~~~~~~~*
Mycroft wasn't overly surprised to see Mrs. Hudson hovering at the bottom of the staircase leading to 221B, but it did when he saw the fear and sadness in her eyes.
"So am I. I want you to squeeze your cock, Sherlock. Grip it hard and move your hand faster."
The remote slipped from his grasp as the reporter came onto the screen.
John took a deep breath. Before Sherlock had touched his tail, he was worked up. He wasn't sure how he was going to react, so it made him nervous. But when the prodding turned into stroking, John couldn't help but feel aroused. No one had ever touched him like that. It had felt as soothing as it was arousing. The moan had slipped out unintentionally, and he had seen Sherlock's head snap up, but Sherlock was actively ignoring it. John was grateful. "Yes, just surprised, I suppose. I've never had anyone touch my tail before."
Molly sighed. "You shouldn't take everything Harriet says so seriously. You know she's just giving you a hard time."
Apparently, John didn't share the same feelings on it.
The right side of Sherlock's mouth twitched into a small smile. "Sherlock." He wasn't sure why he left off his title, but his intuition had told him to do that. His intuition was rarely wrong.
"Can't, or won't?"
Sherlock stroked slowly up and down on his tail. He leaned in until their foreheads were practically touching. "I do," he said softly.
John fleetingly thought that "Your Highness" was a strange name to bestow, but humans were humans. He dove back under the water, tracking where this person might have fallen in. He looked down, down until-Aha! John flicked his tail swiftly as he caught sight of the person, sinking like a boulder. What concerned John was that he wasn't trying to kick back to the surface. He flicked his tail faster as it dawned on him that he may not have been conscious.
He had gotten off the phone with John a little over a week ago, painfully aroused and full of desire. He had wanted some release, but without John there to shag him until he couldn't walk straight, he had to settle with his hand. It wasn't the same as John's firm hand, stroking him until his orgasm hit him like a ton of bricks, but it was all he had until John came home. Perhaps that was why he was so edgy: he needed a proper orgasm.
"I almost lost you!" Sherlock sat up, wiped at his eyes and plunged on without giving John a moment. "You were late......and th-the telly........bombs....and no one knew anything......then Mycroft.........you were hurt! They said you almost died from your wounds! You almost left me!" He pulled John against his chest, sobbing into his uninjured shoulder.
John stroked Sherlock's cock, adding the twist at the tip he knew would drive him crazy. Sherlock whimpered and started thrusting his hips in time with John's strokes. John continued to lick and suck at Sherlock's neck, reaching down to tug at Sherlock's balls. Sherlock groaned and wrapped his arms around John's neck. His hip thrusting became more erratic as he felt his balls and stomach tighten. And just when Sherlock was about to explode, John moved his hands out of reach, keeping him right on the edge. Sherlock groaned again, and reached down to finish the job himself, but John captured his hands and restrained him. Sherlock's hips thrust uselessly, looking for friction of any kind, but John moved far enough away to deny him.
He grabbed the man, as he now noticed his gender, around his middle and went to break for the surface, but found it too far away. He hadn't even realized how far they had sunk. He looked madly around, and saw Molly gesturing towards an entrance.
Sherlock's moans were music to his ears. He came so hard down John's throat, and he tasted so good, John couldn't help but continue to suck and swallow, determined to savor everything that Sherlock was shooting into him. His nipples were so tight and he was so turned on. He wanted this moment to last forever. He always wanted to hear that growl that Sherlock made when he came, wanted always to taste him and feel his hands in his hair. He knew he would always want Sherlock.
John smiled. He may have acted like a bratty child when John told him his military plans, but he knew that deep down, Sherlock supported him. "I'll call you soon, love. I'm making plans for a little bit of phone sex on our next scheduled phone call. You better be prepared."
"Easy, Sherlock. I'm about ready to burst, and I want to make this last a little longer. I want you to put the phone on speaker. This is the week Mrs. Hudson is away, right?"
John had squeezed his hand.
Sherlock wasn't sure what had woken him up, wasn't even sure when he had fallen asleep. The machines still beeped next to him, the sun wasn't up yet, the light was still dim, no one was in the room besides him and John, but something had. Sherlock sucked in a breath and shot his head up.
The breath he had just taken in was let out in a gasp. The room was a complete disaster. Papers strewn all over the floor, broken glass everywhere. The furniture, save for John's usual chair, was upended and the stuffing ripped out of the cushions. The television was knocked over, the screen cracked, and the back looking as though Sherlock had stomped on it. The knife that had been used to hold important papers to the mantel was sitting in Sherlock's tight grasp. He sat on the floor, in front of John's chair, eyes glazed and puffy as he stared vacantly at it. Sherlock Holmes, the man who thought of his brain as a hard drive, and his body as just transport and nothing more, had been crying. Mycroft moved to slowly kneel in front of Sherlock, keeping the knife always in view.
John wiped the sweat of his forehead, deciding that he needed to shower. "I look forward to doing this again, though."
"John!"
John licked his lips. "I wanted you to feel what I have felt these last two weeks. I've been starved for the feeling of your skin on mine. I want to feel alive, to feel my heart pounding in my chest because of pleasure and not fear. I've been absolutely dying to be inside of you. Can we have sex? I feel like I'm going to spontaneously combust if I don't fuck you soon. Please?"
John perked up. "Only what?"
Sherlock wiped a tear that fell from his eye. He heard another voice over the phone speaker, probably another officer. He couldn't quite make out what John said, but his instincts told him that it was time to say goodbye. "Sherlock?"
*~~~~~~~~~~*
It was the phone, but Sherlock ignored it. He was curled on the floor, in front John's chair. He held an old shirt of John's to his nose, trying desperately to find more of John's scent. He felt the sting in his eyes, but knew no tears would fall. His heart clenched.
"John, listen to me. You. Cannot. Talk. To. Him. Just come with me, and we'll pretend that nothing happened. Okay? Please, John. Humans are bad news."
"Sherlock, don't you dare come. You aren't allowed to come until I am inside you and you ask my permission." He continued to stroke and massage, while Sherlock practically bit through his lip trying to comply.
So these thoughts of adventure and excitement, with someone, festered in his mind. Never even entertaining the notion that they would someday come into reality. Nothing ever happens to me anyway, he thought with a grimace.
Sherlock quickly obliged. He lightly gripped his cock, gasping as the heat rushed into him. "Ready, Captain."
Not without his John.
John wasn't sure how to phrase that he was a merman without it sounding strange, so he decided that Sherlock should just see it for himself. He motioned for Sherlock to scoot back, then boosted himself onto the lip of the rock. His face flamed as he heard Sherlock gasp. He looked into the water and did his best to avoid eye contact.
John, speechless, did nothing. Said nothing. He let Sherlock cry on his shoulder, feeling all of the pain and worry flow out of him. He knew Sherlock had been holding back, he knew that's why he curled around him so closely at night, why he was watched almost every minute of every day. Sherlock was afraid that something was going to happen to him. What could he say to that? He cleared his throat. "Sherlock, love, you know I would never leave you. Not willingly anyways." Sherlock grunted and buried his face in John's neck, taking deep shuddering breaths. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock and pulled him as close as he was able without his shoulder twinging. "I mean it, Sherlock Holmes, you aren't getting rid of me that easily. I will never leave you. Never. I love you, you tosser. So much. Alright?"
"John," Sherlock whined, "what are you doing? Why would you do something like this?"
Sherlock couldn't stop the soft moan. "Yes, Captain."
Finally, finally, the cab pulled up to the hospital. Sherlock shoved bills at the cabbie, not even bothering to count to see if it was correct. He ran through the doors, straight to the stairs.
"Sherlock, it's an active military zone. Even I can't allow a civilian into an active war zone. I can't do it."
John blushed a deeper shade of red. "Of course not, I was...preoccupied." He gave him a small smile but still couldn't look him in the eyes.
"Oh, John. My John." He reached out and gently grabbed John's hand. "Oh, God, John...how can....someone....what.....?" John had once pointed out that when Sherlock started to stammer, it meant he was getting overwhelmed. John was always good at pulling him out of this state, but now, John was just lying there. Deep smudges under his eyes, looking so weak and frail. His strong John. Sherlock took a deep breath, and squeezed John's hand as tight as he dared. "John, my John. I know you can hear me. I need you to do something for me, please? You've always had a hard time denying me anything, especially if I add that word you always try to get me to use more often. I need you to come back to me, John, because I need you." He laid his head on the back of John's hand and closed his eyes. "I need you, John. I can't go back to how things were before you, and I don't want to even entertain the notion of a world without you inside it. No one-no one understands me like you do. No one is as suited to me as you are. I can't work, can't eat, can't sleep, I can't function without you. Please," he begged as a tear rolled down his cheek, "please don't leave me. Don't leave me. Don't leave me."
Deciding to take things into his own hands, he waited until Sherlock was making him a rare cup of tea. Cornering him against the counter, he ran his hands up Sherlock's chest, tweaking his nipples through his shirt as he took his earlobe in his teeth Sherlock moaned, unconsciously leaning back into John. John licked the shell of Sherlock's ear, panting into it, as he unbuckled Sherlock's trousers and shoved his hand inside. He grasped Sherlock's cock, smirking as he felt it grow to better fit his hand. He licked Sherlock's ear, before nibbling on the lobe. Sherlock moaned, his eyes fluttering shut as the arousal slammed into his gut. He had wanted to reclaim the intimacy that had been lost during John's time in the military, but he had been afraid of moving too quickly.
John was getting used to the extra duties that had befallen him since some of the men had caught pneumonia. He liked having things to do, he liked being useful. But more importantly, having a lot to do meant he wasn't so distracted by how much he was missing Sherlock. After their rather steamy conversation, John's need for Sherlock had been growing everyday. He found himself reaching for him in the middle of the night, and his heart ached every time he didn't grasp Sherlock. Whenever his CO was droning on and on, he heard Sherlock's voice in his head. "Dull" "boring" "not worth my time." His CO had only caught him smiling once, and had subjected John to extra PT for laughing at his efficiency campaign. John still heard Sherlock in his head, but had become an expert at keeping his face statue like.
It was all a murmur, wordless and unintelligible.
the eyes roll over his body, he felt too....hot. A feeling started stirring low in his belly and shooting warmth out to the rest of his body. He felt the flush rise into his cheeks, and shook his head against the approaching blush. He cleared his throat and tried to talk again. "I'm John." He said stupidly.
He moved to try and catch Sherlock's attention. "Sherlock?"
"Try me."
Sherlock interrupted once more, knowing that he needed to state his feelings before he lost the courage to do so. "You misunderstand, John. It isn't a physical pain I feel, but a psychological one. My heart is functioning perfectly, but it misses you terribly. It misses you in the night when I can't sleep, and cries out when I reach for you and you aren't there. It breaks over and over again when I return to the flat, knowing you won't be there, but still half hoping you will be, putting the kettle on, flashing me a smile, pulling me into your arms just for the sake of holding me close. It sends pain all over my body and I can't help but cry at the overwhelming feeling of loneliness that creeps up on me. Your things that are lying around the flat even bring tears to my eyes. They lie about, untouched, practically screaming at me that you are not here, and the feeling is unbearable. My heart is missing a piece of itself and it knows it won't be happy again until you, the missing piece, are home with me, safe and sound. That is the pain my heart feels, John. I miss you."
His mobile rang, and pulling it out of his pocket, smiled as he saw John's name on the caller ID. "Hello, John."
"Your Highness? Your Highness!"
He didn't know what it was. Tasteless, odorless.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Yes, John, I am painfully aware of the fact that you are not here. And I don't see the reason why I should have to play nice because of that. Lestrade is an idiot, and he always has been, and I haven't treated him any differently since you have been away."
John huffed. "He's different, I can tell already. If you saw-" He was interrupted by a splash. He looked up to see Sherlock swimming towards them. John struggled in Molly's grasp again. "Molly, let me go!"
Sherlock licked his lips. "The first, and the most insistent, is in my loins."
Sherlock slapped a hand to his mouth after the gasp escaped him. When John had motioned for him to scoot back, he was confused. When John boosted himself up, he was a little excited. Okay.
A splash interrupted his thoughts. Since he was closer to the surface than he ought to have been, he heard it as if it were happening right in front of him. He immediately swam to the surface, wondering what had happened. He heard shouting, and his heart started pounding. Humans. Humans were close by. He breached the surface cautiously, he hadn't noticed a boat go by, but then again, he had been so deep in thought that maybe it had passed by. He saw a boat and mentally slapped himself for being so careless. His kind were sought after for the amusement of humans and thus, their king had told them to always be on guard and cautious. These humans, however, paid him no attention, were not even facing his direction, but were frantically looking at a space below them, calling someone's name.
He sighed, and dove beneath the waves. His sandy blond hair plastered to his head as he dove further below. He let out another sigh.
*~~~~~~~~~~*
"That isn't good enough, Phil. I need answers. I need more than that. I need to know where the soldiers are. I know you know something."
. His brother, the fat arse that he was, had seen to it that Sherlock was not allowed in the weapons room, or on the firing range, or any where else that would have offered a reprieve from his boredom. He had only shot through the walls a few times, and that experiment where he had attached a spear to a gun? That had merely been a miscalculation that Mycroft had overreacted to......even if that guard had to be airlifted to the hospital. However, if Mycroft hadn't been interfering with his activities and hobbies, then none of that would have happened.
*~~~~~~~~~~*
*~~~~~~~~~~*
John's blush grew deeper. His breathing became harder as he became more aroused. The deepness of Sherlock's voice coupled with the stroking of his tail by his firm yet gentle hand, was doing interesting things to his body. He needed space, and quickly, because all he wanted to do right now was shove Sherlock down and suck on his cock until he came down John's throat. He cleared his throat, shook his head to clear his thoughts, and scooted away from Sherlock. The distance helped, but not much. Just looking at him made him want to do dirty things to this man. He scooted to the other side of the rock, not daring to go back in the water in case Molly was hovering around. He folded his arms across his chest and drew his fin up.
*~~~~~~~~~~*
give off the vibe of 'I'm going to harm you' at all. And John felt in his heart of hearts that Sherlock could be trusted.
Phil sighed again. "We have a unit that is only a few kilometers away and the firing has decreased exceptionally. If everything goes well, and the firing stops, we should have a unit there soon. I will let you know as soon as we make contact, Mycroft, you have my word." The line went dead and Mycroft set the phone down. He cursed under his breath and ran a hand lightly over his meticulously combed hair. This wasn't good.
And waited.
"I wasn't on your boat."
John opened his mouth to tell Sherlock to stop acting like an idiot, then thought of a new plan. With a small grin on his face, he moved to the door and braced his back against it, making sure that no one would be able to get in. "Sherlock."
Sherlock nodded. "Just get him to me."
Sherlock glanced at John with a smile. He leaned over to John and placed a gentle kiss on his lips. John inhaled as he returned the kiss. Pulling away, Sherlock ran his thumb along John's bottom lip, looking at the daze in his eyes. Sherlock smiled. "Of course."
Sherlock panted, his cock searching for any sort of friction as his hips thrust wildly. "It-ah, God-it feels good. Really good."
"If you weren't on the boat, then where did you come from? I honestly doubt that you were in the middle of the ocean just for recreational swimming."
Sherlock stared at him a little harder. He had assumed that this man had been on their boat and he just hadn't noticed him. When he asked his name, he knew that he hadn't been a part of their party. But that just raised more questions. If he wasn't in the group that Sherlock tagged along with, then who was he? Where did he come from? There hadn't been any other boats for miles.
"John," he breathed with a smile.
"Are you alright?" Sherlock tried to play nonchalant, not wanting to frighten him away.
"Patch me through."
John panted, slightly embarrassed at the amount of fluid that was on the floor in front of him, but hearing Sherlock as he had come was satisfying. While he regretted not being there in person to have sex with Sherlock, he was glad that they at least got to do something. "Yes, Sherlock?"
Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back as he continued to look at the boat; this could be a wonderful observation exercise. He could see how his guards behaved when they were free of royal responsibility, something Sherlock would never know. "How far out were you planning on going? And why are you taking a camera?" Sherlock questioned imperiously.
*~~~~~~~~~~*
"Shame, really. It's quite beautiful."
He gave Sherlock's cock one last lick before pulling off. He licked his fingers clean, savoring the taste, then licked his lips soundly. Sherlock was still breathing heavily, arm thrown over his eyes when he pointed a finger at John.
John's heart was pounding from the excitement at the possibility of having his questions answered, but now it was pounding from Sherlock's skin on his. He felt the electricity at the touch and felt a quiver in his belly. He could see Sherlock's arousal. He had peeked onto boats before and had seen the male and female of Sherlock's species doing....interesting things with each other. Running on adrenaline, and feeling emboldened by Sherlock's obvious interest, John sucked Sherlock's finger into his mouth and ran his tongue over it.
"There he is. There's the Sherlock that I remember. Petulant, but correct. God, I love you."
"Don't be an idiot! You can't talk to that man!"
Now Sherlock snorted. "Fish?"
John moaned. "Pull yourself out, Sherlock." John pulled his own zipper down and freed himself. He gripped his steel hard cock, almost trying to tame it. He had fantasized about this for weeks, and he was damned if he was going to wait any longer.
Sherlock's head snapped up. "Mermaids?"
"Will he-will he be okay? John?"
"Both." At Sherlock's distressed and angry look, he sighed and rubbed a hand over the back of his neck. "Listen, I can do my best to get John home sooner than later, but I absolutely cannot allow you to go to a war zone. Do you understand?"
When John received the okay from the doctor that he was allowed to return home, Sherlock wasted no time bundling him up and whisking him away back to Baker Street.
Sherlock checked on his experiments in progress, but nothing needed his immediate attention, and he simply did not have the concentration to start something new. He felt antsy, his heart beating too fast. He wanted to do something, anything to get his body under control. The old itch of his previous drug use started rearing its ugly head. The faded track marks on his arms were starting to feel hot again, and he absently rubbed at them as he sighed deeply. He passed by his brother's study, door firmly shut as he heard him talking on the phone to someone. He stuck his tongue out at the door, having more than half a mind to burst in and ruin whatever trading deal Mycroft was trying to negotiate. However, the old lesson their parents had instilled in them, "Country above all," forbade him from doing so. He sighed and went to pace the castle grounds,
Sherlock gave no time for adjusting before he started moving. Slowly at first, wanting to be gentle, but picking up speed after some encouraging hip thrusts from John.
Phil sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. "Mycroft, we don't know much. All we know is that there was a patrol sent out around their perimeter, and there was an explosion. We lost contact a few minutes later after a second explosion occurred. We're trying to reach them, or any squad around them to find out what's going on. The keyword there is 'trying.' I'm afraid I can't give you more than that because that is all we know at the moment. What's the big concern?"
John stopped struggling, but Molly didn't loosen her grip. John peered at her over his shoulder. "You don't understand, Molly."
John popped open his eyes, staring into the darkness. "Why? Was it too much?"
"The attack in Afghanistan. What's happening?"
Sherlock blinked. "You learned that by watching?" John nodded. "And I thought that I was a great observer." He ran a hand through his hair, remembering John's fingers running through it and gave a contented sigh. He slid his gaze over to John, but what he saw made him instantly go to his deducing mode: dilated pupils, having difficulty making eye contact, ragged breathing, but not from exhaustion; squirming, lip bit-He started back as the solution hit him in the face. John was aroused, not having found his release like Sherlock had. He cleared his throat to grab John's attention.
Lestrade talked to him.
Sherlock paced the flat. He was right at the end of a case, and he was edgy. He had kept up hope that Lestrade would have figured out who the murderer was before Sherlock had to step in. It was transparent who had done it, and he was frustrated that no one was keeping up with him. The one man who kept him grounded, and who also kept him from lashing out at everyone for their stupid comments and questions, was thousands of miles away.
John was caught off guard, “Sherlock? What do you mean, how are things 'with' him” He hadn’t missed the emphasis on that small word and John knew exactly what Mycroft was eluding to but was unwilling to give him that satisfaction. “And for god sake, call me John."
John stood, “How the fuck dare you? How dare you… You, you arrogant son a bitch.”
“No Mycroft. I erm. I tried to type in several things but nothing, nada,  the time machine bit works as you said. I could see myself in the past, but couldn’t do anything at all. You need to have someone sacked!”
Of course, John suddenly realised why he had been set this task. Mycroft had known how deadly this technology was. He needed John to try it and rubbish it. He had trusted John to do the right thing.
John bristled. “Mycroft, what do you want? Surely you are not getting a kick out of my humiliating lack of progress with my romantic intentions towards your brother?” There, he had said it!
John Chuckled.
He then typed in
John’s face snapped to Mycroft’s. “Milan? Harry is in Milan? “
John analysed the scene that had happened years before. The letter? No one except their dad read the letter. John looked up as he heard his father stumbling around in his room. He knew what came next, what must have happened all those years ago,  dad must have intercepted the letter! John thought quickly and punched into the keyboard
“Come, please sit down, I have a pot of tea just made. Cake?”
“No John, I brought you here today to make a decision. It’s now, today, or not at all. Either way, when you leave this room you will know nothing about this experiment. I’m sorry John but if you decide against the experiment I have no reason to hurt you. But, the knowledge now you have it would be a threat to you forever, so these few hours will be wiped from your mind. In fact, the tea? Sorry, but it contained a drug that will become active in a few hours if you choose not to take the journey. By the time you get home, you will have no memory of this, just a bit of a headache. If however you wish to go ahead. You will not be missed by Sherlock… or whomever will be in your life at that time.  No matter how long you stay here, or on your journey, you will be returned to the time at the exact moment we picked you up in Baker Street.”
The message flashed red, stark and bright against the whiteness of everything else. Ok, John breathed out slowly.  Mycroft had told him about this, just before he had started the drip. He had to just input the furthest date he wanted to go back. He knew that when he got to the required date, he just need to tap plus or minus for half hour increments into the past or future.  He stood for a moment. Going over some of the thoughts he had had that afternoon in the time Mycroft had left him to deliberate.  He didn’t want to revisit his childhood. But he needed to try and see what happened to Harry. He remembered his sixteenth birthday, His dad had been drunk as usual. It was a rubbish day. But made so much worse when he saw Harry. That night when she came home, she was drunk, sodden drunk, hardly able to stand. She had been a good sister till then. They had stuck together. She had been a brilliant artist. Loved the idea of being a fashion designer and had applied to go to university. But when the refusal came through on his birthday she had just seemed broken. It was as though that had been the one thing that could have saved her.
John’s footsteps felt heavy as he made his way up to bed. Not even bothering with the bathroom, he stripped and laid under the duvet, his mind going around and round as he listened to the gentle notes of a haunting sad melody being played down stairs.
“Christ..”
Both John and Harry turned as Their father came out glowering…. “Clean this fucking tip up both of you. I’m off out.”  Young John turned to Harry, hugged her and told her that this was the best birthday he could ever have had.
The door slammed open behind him, making both him and Sherlock jump.
As he stepped out of Speedy’s licking the crumbs from his lips, he froze….. “Shit, nooooo”, he glared at the black car, with its black windows, sitting there waiting.  The rear door opened, and he got in. No point in questions, rants or tantrums, he never won. Better to get it over and done with.  John smiled tightly at Anthea, as he fastened his seat belt. He had long since realised that communication was not part of the arrangement, he could ask, but she would ignore. He could glare, she would just smile in an absent sort of way. Instead he reached down and pulled a bottle of water from the on-board fridge that John knew was always stocked well with water and champagne. Christ, champagne? Why the hell would Mycroft feel the need to stock his car with a bottle of the finest Bollinger. Jesus, it probably cost him as much as a month of John’s rent.
*** JOHN HIDES HIS PORN IN A MUCH BETTER HIDING PLACE ***
“You can, John” Mycroft uttered the words clearly but quietly. Then just sat waiting.
Before long John wandered out into the corridor and found himself thinking about Sherlock, God that man could have been Sherlock. Maybe he had treated him at some point and never even known.  What was Sherlock up to now?  He knew that in his own timeline his younger self would be in Afghanistan in a few short months.  Going out as a qualified doctor shortened his army training considerably. That and the lack of soldiers. He was 25 at this point in time, so Sherlock was 21.  It would have been easy for the young John to go looking for Sherlock before now, meet him at university, bump into him at a coffee shop maybe. John knew though that Sherlock had struggled a lot at School and at university. He had hated it. Was there ever a good time to break that cycle.  Against every bit of him that ached to make things better for Sherlock, he doubted that allowing the younger John to meet Sherlock when he was so angry and distrustful of the world would have a happy outcome. Maybe it would do the opposite.  But, he desperately wanted to see him, to witness him as a young man, full of fire.
John Blinked and when he opened his eyes he saw the young John fly down the stairs just stopping as the flap of the letter box opened.  “Harry, a letter from University"  John shouted excitedly as he ran up the stairs into the Bedroom as Harry was pulling on her jeans.
***INPUT REQUIRED DATE***
He jumped when part of the wall seamlessly slid away to reveal the form of the man who had once again summoned him.
He blinked, opening his eyes slowly. Unsure for a moment what time it was, he realised that he was waiting for Sherlock to get the CCTV recordings from their last case.  He watched the pair as the recordings played out. He watched himself and Sherlock laugh as the indiscretions played out in front of them. John smiled as he watched Sherlock, his Sherlock. He drew a sharp breath as he noticed Sherlock watching him. He had been intent on the video footage. Hadn’t noticed as Sherlock’s gaze settled on his face, the tenderness, the fond smile as he gazed over at John.
Mycroft smiled. A slow but certain smile. “I see, erm. Nothing could be changed John?”  His expression said a thousand words.
John allowed himself the time to remember Afghanistan.  He remembered his training. Remembered his comrades. The officers, his juniors, his friends.  For the first time, the memories didn’t hurt as he thought about his time as a soldier and army medic, a side effect of this time travel procedure he thought. Some detachment.  He allowed his mind to wander. Those dark cold nights hunkered down as the insurgents tried to wait them out. The rounds of gun fire splitting the night.  He remembered the boring times, the men playing cards, the rivalry as they mucked around playing pranks on each other, the gentle teasing. And the not so gentle hand jobs behind the barracks. Those moments of bonding between frightened men living so closely but all wanting to get home safe to their loved ones.  Then John remembered his last battle, when he got hit. He recalled every moment. That fight, should never have happened. The loss of life, his friends, those in his care. If only things had been different.  He knew that he could get his younger self to walk away from the corridor. Change his mind about signing his life away to the military. Knew that he could at last be free of the nightmares. He could be unhurt, undamaged. But then….  He had met Sherlock because he had been damaged.  He met Sherlock because of Afghanistan.  “No. No no….” His hands were tied.
