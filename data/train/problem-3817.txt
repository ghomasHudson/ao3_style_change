Cas met Charlie, Benny and Gabe in the cafeteria and informed them about Dean. "Oh my god! That asshole!" Charlie said looking pissed. "Yeah, Dean wants me to come over after swim practice since we can't go on our date." Cas said pushing his potatoes around on his tray. "Good. Someone should go see him." Benny said. Cas didn't know who this Alistair was but he wanted revenge for hurting Dean.
“Bye papa.” Henry said and reached out for Dean.
“Yes.” Cas grinned.
Mary loved the monkeys, but Dean was very uncomfortable around them. I could see the look of relief once we moved away from the monkeys, "alright bug, where next?" I asked pushing the stroller foreword. "Uhh, fishy!" She clapped so we turned around and headed for the aquarium. "Mama, I hungry." Mary said once we got done looking at the penguins, "okay, we'll go find somewhere to eat lunch." I said and we found a nice picnic table to eat our food.
"Do you wanna open it first?" Cas asked when they got to the kitchen, "nah, we'll open it after supper." Dean said and watched them take the package downstairs.
“How’s Cas doing?” Dean asked while Charlie combed through his hair.
“Just a bad dream… Can you get Cas?”
“You’re such a bitch.” Dean replied.
“Yeah, well she doesn’t know that.” Amelia smirked.
Cas was able to slip out a half an hour later and he carefully got up and cleaned himself up and grabbed a washcloth to clean Dean up as best as he could while he slept. When the alarm went off Dean took another quick shower. They dressed in jeans and nice shirts before heading to the roadhouse to meet everyone.
Knowing Sam was an early riser Dean went ahead and started frying the bacon and making the waffles. Dean quickly transferred everything to the dryer and almost ran into Mary again in the kitchen, "Dean, you didn't need to make breakfast." Mary smiled grabbing a cup of coffee. Dean just shrugged his shoulders, "I was up and down here anyway." He grabbed everything and put it on the table along with the orange juice when Sam stumbled in rubbing his eyes. "Wow, mom made waffles. Awesome." Sam smiled, "no, she didn't." Mary grinned helping herself to some breakfast. "Dean? You can make waffles?" He looked confused and Dean laughed, "yes Sammy. I can make waffles. Now shut up and eat."
~0~0~0~0~
He heard her before he could see her, Lucy came sprinting around the corner and jumped up on Dean, "Lucy! Down!" he yelled rubbing he chest slightly where the dog's paws landed, but reached down to scratch her ears. "Dude, this is weird…" Gabe whispered, "what? Why?" Dean asked making his way to the kitchen. "Because this is a teachers house and I'm about to sit down and have breakfast with him like it's a normal thing." Gabe continued. "Oh, shut up. It'll be fine." Cas huffed and went to catch up to Dean. Everyone was greeted warmly by Ellen and then greeted by the familiar "Idjits." from Bobby. Once they were done eating the left, Dean dropped Benny and Andrea off and turned to Cas, "you want to go home or come to my house?" "Uh, let me go home first. I need to shower and I don't have anymore clothes then I'll be over." Dean nodded and dropped him off and headed home to shower himself.
The rest of the basement was split into another medium sized bedroom and a small kitchenette. They went upstairs where Sam and Mary were sitting at the island, "Mom it's beautiful. Thank you so much!" Dean said walking over to give Mary a big hug, "you're welcome sweetie. We had contractors coming in shortly after your accident and I'm surprised they got it done so quickly… Now, Ellen said you can have Jo's old crib since we got rid of yours and Sam's, so we'll just need to get a changing table." Mary said.
"It's okay, I'm just glad to know she's okay. We can stop by tomorrow if you want." John said and the other three agreed. Dean and I walked into the room and Mary was in a small bed with an IV attached to her arm and a heart monitor. "Oh god. She looks so small." I whispered walking to her bedside and brushed back her curls and then held her small hand and Dean held the other, not saying anything for an hour. Mary's eyes fluttered open and she looked around the room, "mama?" she called out in a small voice and I started crying again, "I'm here baby, so is daddy."
"What?" I whispered becoming furious, "Cas, it was a mistake, I was so drunk I didn't know what I was doing, I was talking to Ellen one moment about everything then the next thing I know Lisa shows up and we started talking and she kissed me and I kissed back for like a second and shoved her off. When you came in tonight, I just got done telling her that what happened never should have and for her to leave us alone." Dean explained and before I knew it my hand was connecting with his face and a loud smack rang through the parking lot. "Don't come home. There will be a bag waiting for you on the porch. I don't care where you go after that. I'm not talking to you right now Dean Winchester. And I will determine when you will see Mary again." I said shoving him one more time and climbed into my car. "Cas! Cas please!" I heard Dean beg as I slammed the door and drove off.
Dean looked to see what time it sent and it was sent almost an hour ago,
"No, she wont sleep in her room for her nap. I don't know why but it just throws her off and she won't sleep tonight just put a few blankets on the floor and put in a movie and she should go down. Although she might curl up with you where ever you're at."
I started scrubbing the shampoo in his hair, and I noticed Dean frowning; "what's the sour face for?" I asked leaning back forgetting the hair for a moment, "I feel like our two year old. I should be able to take a shower and was my own god damn hair. I'm what… 25? 26?"- "You'll be 27 next week." I interrupted. "Not helping Cas. What I'm trying to say is that this fucking cast annoys me. My arm itches and it's sweaty and it's making it smell funky. I miss being able to hold you in both my arms." Dean sulked.
“Gramma.” Henry whined once he came back downstairs.
“Charlie, it’s fine. I promise. Come over and hang out with me and Henry. We’ll go swimming or something.” Dean heard her sniffle and mumble an okay before she hung up.
Dean grabbed his phone and pulled up Cas's number and sent him a text,
They went into the nursery and Cas set the car seat down and pulled Henry out. "Oh baby you're home!" Cas let out a watery chuckle and set him on the changing table. Henry looked around the room with wide eyes, "I know it's a lot to take in right now, but this is you're home now." Cas said softly as he changed his son into bumble bee footy pajamas.
“Those are fine.” Dean said pointing towards a pack of 10 with different sized canvases. Cas grabbed two packs and followed Dean up to the register.
They drove for a while in comfortable silence before Sam reached over and turned the radio down. “How are you doing by the way… since you know.” Sam asked.
He did
"Dean, baby put the blade down." Cas said gently and Charlie's heart broke a little, "Cas i-it wont stop. Make it stop!" she heard Dean sob and she started crying as well, she also noticed Benny come up next to her.
“Sorry big guy no room for you to join.” Dean whispered and grinned when Cas jumped and spun around.
“I love you. Go get ready, the wedding starts in an hour and half.” Cas told Dean.
“Okay daddy.”
“I’m back from my business trip and I’d love to see you guys and see how Henry is.”
"An accident? Ar-are you okay?" Dean asked looking over me trying to find any injuries, "I'm fine just a few bumps and bruises, the twins are fine too." I said and Dean eyes widened "tw-twins?! Cas!? You-you're pregnant?!" Dean said and it felt like ice water was dumped down my back. "Yes, Dean… I'll be four months along at the end of the month." I said and placed his hand on the bump. "What? When did this happen?" Dean asked tears forming in his eyes. "Dean? Wha-what's the last thing you remember?" I asked putting my hand on top of his on my stomach.
He threw on a pair of jeans and just kept the sweatshirt on and ran down the stairs. Him and Sam were halfway out the door when Dean turned around remembering the fight with his mom. "Mom! I'm sorry about last night." Dean began, "it's fine honey, we'll talk when you get home, no go!" Mary shooed her son out the door.
"Alright Cas, everything looks good. You are free to leave." Dr. Hansen said. "Thank you doctor." I said and slid off the bed. "Ready to go Cassie?" Gabe asked handing me my coat, "no, I'm going to go see Dean, I haven't seen him since I've been here." I said pushing the elevator button to go up to the floor for coma patients. "oh, okay… well I'm going to go the bakery down the street. Call me when you're ready to go home." I just grunted in response and stepped out of the elevator. I stopped in front of Dean's door, mentally preparing myself for what I might see. I took a deep breath ran my hand over the small bump and pushed the door open.
Cas replied.
"I'm Dean…" "Great! if you could just sign here, now, it's kind of a big package, where would you like it?" The delivery guy asked and Dean's eyes widened at the package. "Jesus! Who's this from?!" He asked quickly scribbling his name down, "unknown sender. But it is safe I promise." he said. "Okay, um just follow me I guess." Dean said and lead the way to the living room.
Dean ripped open the bag, grabbed a few and held it out to Cas who took some. Later in the class Bobby sent Dean down to the office to get more paper for his printer, as he was walking back he almost ran into Alistair. "Why hello Dean." Alistair greeted, "leave me alone." Dean said moving around him and picked up his pace holding the paper closer to him.
"I uh, um… okay." Dean said quietly the blush crawling up his skin. Dean stood up and just stared back at all the eyes facing him. "H-hi, um so it's pretty obvious what you do in here, but I will warn you, it's harder than it looks…. Um, if you thought this was just an easy 'A', thinking oh I can just take this class, all I have to do is take pictures you're wrong. Uh, this is also the yearbook, so if you'd like to volunteer to work on the yearbook this year, there's a sheet on Mr. Singer's desk, he and I are the editors this year. Um… This class focuses on improving your photography skills, w-we work a lot with photoshop. So yeah, uh. That's it." Dean said and sat down quickly hiding his face from the rest of the students.
“Cas please fuck me. Please.” Dean started begging.
“Get the fuck away from my house bitch.” Dean growled again.
a minute later. And 4. Hurt her, and I'll kill you. Make myself clear?" Dean threatened the boy when he came in "Dad! Oh my god!" Mary squealed horrified.
"Cas and I could smell watermelon last night and we thought it was the pup… Never mind." Dean said softly and Mary chuckled, "that's great! But you need to remember, I'm a beta, I can't smell things as well as you and Cas." She said patting his cheek a little. "Well, I don't think a lot of people will be able to smell it yet… I smelled it first and it took Dean a while before he smelt it." Cas said grabbing some juice from the fridge.
"Well yeah, I know it's your favorite and it's our anniversary." Dean said after he opened my door. "Hello gentlemen, how can I help you?" The waiter greeted, "yes, we have a reservation under Winchester." Dean said "ah, yes right on time. If you'll follow me." The waiter said leading us to a table. "Would you like some wine or any other beverage?" "Wine would be great." Dean smiled at the waiter and he returned with a bottle and two glasses.
“Yes. I track all my friends.”
"I'm okay… Don't think I'm depressed or anything, I mean, yeah it was hard going home the next day without Henry. But, Cas and my mom and everyone has been awesome. I'm just counting down the days for when I can bring my baby home." he grinned.
“Honey we can do them later.” Ellen said.
~_~_~_~_~
“I’m sure I do, I’ll shower before I get into bed.” Cas set him down and helped Dean get undressed before getting him under the blankets. “I’ll bring you up some water and crackers or something later.” Dean just nodded.
"Is it going to hurt?" Dean asked quietly, "yes." Mary said quickly, "well, way to sugar coat it…" Dean mumbled, "I'm sorry sweetie, but yes it's going to hurt, you're too young for the medicine to numb your lower half." she explained. They talked for about half an hour before they asked everything the needed to know, "come on Cas. I'll take you home." Dean said getting up from the couch, "I'm going to tell Gabe." Cas announced once they got into the Impala. "I figured you would… Just make him promise not to tell anyone yet." Dean pleaded, "I will… Will you be at school tomorrow?" Cas asked, "no, mom already called and explained everything but said I would be staying home the rest of the week to give myself a chance to adjust or whatever." Dean smiled softly and pulled up in front of Cas's house. "I'll talk to you later." Cas said kissing Dean quickly before getting out.
“I will.” Henry yawned and allowed Jody to take him.
“Yes and no.” Dean sighed. “It’s obviously going to take me a while to get over it but I’m done being depressed.” Cas hugged him tighter.
"So Cas, I was thinking…" Dean said once we put Mary in her room, "that can't be good." I teased and headed back down the stairs. "Ha, you're so funny. But seriously, I was thinking if you know, after your next heat… If you don't get pregnant, we could go see Doctor Madison. See how things are going…" Dean said softly, I turned around before I got to the living room and looked at him. "That sound's fine Dean, I agree, that I should get things looked at just so we know." I said and kissed him.
“Where else could he be?!” Dean yelled.
“Aunt Charlie?! You sleeped over?” Henry asked.
“You too?” Henry asked.
much and you make me so happy. So, you coming to check on me made me so much better.” Dean explained. “But now, I need you to go back to sleep, so daddy can go back to sleep.”
Dean walked Henry up to his classroom like he did every time, “have a good day at school, I’ll pick you up in a few hours.”
“Whyyyy.”
“Well, Henry is staying with Bobby and Ellen for a couple days just to give Dean and I a little break but we could still do dinner or something.”
He blew through the living room causing Lucy to bark and chase after him, Dean ignored his mom when she asked where the fire was and bolted down the stairs. "CAS!" Dean said trying to catch his breath. "Dean?! What's wrong?" Cas asked standing up to get closer to Dean, "prom night…." Dan wheezed, "yeah, what about it?" Cas asked getting confused. "W-we had sex for the first time since Henry was born." Dean continued to wheeze, Cas chuckled a little, "yes Dean… We did, and it was great." Cas said, still confused to where this was going.
“Henry. What did I say about that word?” Cas sighed.
Before the movie even ended Dean started moving his hand up higher on Cas's thigh and began nibbling on his throat. "Mm, Dean." Cas moaned tilting his head, "let's go upstairs." Dean whispered, "but the movie isn't over." Cas said, "we'll finish it tomorrow." Dean said rubbing Cas's quickly growing member through his jeans.
"I-I think my water just broke." he gasped and then Ellen noticed the puddle, "yes it did. Jo, I want you to go down stairs and pack a few things for Dean and the baby." Ellen instructed, "got bags packed already." Dean panted, "in my room-foot of the bed." he gasped and squeezed his eyes shut as a contraction rolled through him. "Bring him some new sweats and a pair of boxers too please." Ellen said and grabbed Dean's arm to get him out of the mess, "go sit down for now sweetie, I'll clean this up." Ellen said softly.
"Thanks Mary." Charlie smiled, "no problem sweetie, I'm going to bed, don't make too much noise, oh and Lucy is in my room so don't worry about her. Night love you all." Mary said and as she left there was a chorus of love you's and nights making her smile a little. Once the door was closed Charlie tucked her shirt off, "woah! What are you doing?!" Benny and Dean shouted at the same time and covered their eyes. "What's it look like I'm doing? I'm putting pajamas on." Charlie said, "really?! Benny, like you've never seen a girl naked. And Dean, we are all best friends here, I know you guys wont jump me." she continued, "yeah Charlie, but it's weird…" Dean said grabbing an AC/DC shirt out of his drawer and when he turned around he blushed and closed his eyes.
"It's none of your business if or if not Cas got kicked out of his house, now leave me alone." Dean snapped and started walking away before Michael grabbed his bag and pushed him back into his locker. "Let me go." Dean growled, "oh, I will. I just wanted to let you know that we all know it's true. And we all think you're disgusting." Michael grinned and walked away.
he said quietly so he wouldn't wake Dean,
"Cassie." Gabe whimpered. "How did you do this? It fucking hurts!" Gabe said wincing as another contraction rolled through his body. "It'll be worth it once Alex gets here." I said and sat in the chair next to him and Dr. Maddison came in. "Hello Gabe, now, I know you're a month early, but you've had a good pregnancy all through, so I have a good feeling that everything will be fine. Alex will probably have to be in the NICU for a while." She explained and Gabe just nodded. "Let's see how far you are… Well you 9 centimeters already, it shouldn't be too long. I'll go prep and get the rest of the nurses and by time we get back you should be ready to push." Dr. Maddison said and threw away her gloves.
"Yes mama. We went to the park!" Mary beamed, "you did? Well that sounds fun. Why don't you go to the kitchen and you and Aunt Charlie can make a pie to take home to daddy." I said putting her back down, "okay mama, I be back." Mary said running to the back yelling "Aunt Charliieee!" "I'm her actual freaking uncle and she doesn't even say hi." Gabe pouted over at the register, "oh hush Gabriel, you know she gets excited seein' her mama." Missouri said. "Oh Cas honey, Mary is just so precious. She definitely has a lot of energy." Missouri said sitting down and I gave her a cup of tea. "Thank you." She murmured taking a sip. "Yeah, well I blame Dean. He gets her all riled up and it takes forever to get her calm."
He could hear a faint growl come from Dean, "I was going to ask you if you wanted to go for a little bit anyway. Now I want to go and kick her ass." Dean huffed. "Dean. We can go but let's try to ignore her." Cas said and sat up but stayed at Dean's side. "Okay, I'll get Sammy to watch Henry for a while tonight. You can stay at the party longer if you want but I'll only stay for a few hours." Dean said and picked up his pop corn.
Panic started to rise as she double checked under the beds, closets and anywhere else she could think of. “Henry?” She called out, “okay! I give up! You win!” She yelled and waited for a giggle or Henry to come running up to her but there was nothing. “Henry?!… HENRY!”
“Oh, okay.”
“Nothing to be sorry about, let’s get some food in you…. I’m guessing Dean’s upstairs?”
"I don't want you to." Dean mumbled against Cas' neck, "alright, just give me a chance to explain to her okay?" "What are you two idjits doin' behind my desk?" Bobby grouched, Dean and Cas pulled apart and Dean wiped away the remaining tears, "sorry, was working on yearbook. Stupid hormones." Dean sniffed putting his glasses back on. "Uh huh…" Bobby said eyeing the two knowing something else was going on.
“Dean. Henry’s school’s on fire.”
“Will do.” Dean said and hung up, “alright I’ll meet you at your house.”
Charlie said and hung up.
He picked up the carseat and headed out to his car when he ran into Amelia. "Oh, sorry!" She apologized, "it's fine." Dean said and moved around her, "Dean." Amelia called out. "What?" Dean sighed and turned back around, "c-can I see him?" she asked, when he just shrugged Amelia smiled and bent over. "Oh he's so precious, he looks just like Castiel." She grinned, "yeah, I should go now." Dean said and went to leave again when Amelia stopped him.
“I can pick something up, what do you want for supper Henry?” Cas asked.
“Not sorry.” Dean continued to laugh.
“With Henry… You were yelling pretty loud and he got scared.”
Sam came downstairs a few minutes later with sandwiches and bottles of water, "I figured you'd be hungry…" Sam said handing Cas a plate with two sandwiches and a couple bottles of water. "Thanks Sam." Cas said and uncapped one of the waters and handed it to Dean, "thanks." he mumbled and took a drink. Once Henry was burped and changed Dean came back to the living room, "Dean? Can I hold him?" Sam asked and he gently handed his son down, "you can hold him anytime Sammy." Dean said and went to go eat his sandwich.
His ears were ringing, blinking his eyes a couple of times, Dean gathered his surroundings, Cas was laying on top of him and John had a gun. That’s when he felt warm sticky blood soaking through his shirt and that Cas was laying way too still.
“Where’s Cas?”
“Thanks for the food Charlie, I’m just going to eat upstairs, Gabe you can crash on the couch if you want.” Dean told him and grabbed his plate and a couple bottles of water. By time Dean got into their bedroom he heard the shower shut off and Cas move around in the bathroom.
“I just thought it’d make me feel better and you of course.” Cas just held Dean close and let him cry it out. They laid there for a while longer before Dean spoke again.
Cas noticed Dean was unusually still so he stopped. "Dean? Are you okay? Do you want me to stop?" Dean snapped out of his trance and just stared into the boy's bright blue eyes that were filled with concern. 'Yep, definitely in love.' Dean thought and it scared him a little. "I'm fine. Promise." He smiled and leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Cas's cheek, and they got back to business. Cas pulled Dean's pants and boxers off and just stared at his body. This is the furthest they've gone so far and Cas was nervous.
~_~_~_~
“Right. Uh, hang on.” Dean pulled out his phone and called the police station.
'hopefully' he thought to himself
"Care to explain why you were beating the daylights out of Mr. Hill?" Crowley asked once they were seated in his office. Cas was still fuming and he barely noticed Crowley getting up to open his window, "calm down, you're stinking up my office." he complained. "He was threatening Dean." Cas bit out, "threatening how?" he asked. "basically told me he was going to rape him. He thanked me for 'opening him up' for him. And he asked if the rumor of him being pregnant is true." Cas said, "ah, but it is true, may I remind you Mr. Novak."
“Dean you have to breath. Look at me and copy my breaths.” Cas instructed and took big deep breaths and released them slowly. It broke his heart seeing the fear in Dean’s eyes. He noticed Dean frantically scratching at his scars so Cas took his hands into his own and let Dean squeeze them as hard as needed.
Henry started whimpering so Dean put the pacifier back in his mouth and Cas took him out of the carseat and held him; as soon as Henry was in his Papa's arms he settled down. "Alright, this is the last yearbook meeting for the year." Bobby started, "now, everyone's pages look good. Dean, I'll stop by sometime at the end of the week and we can go over it some more."
"Come on, let's finish packing and I say we break in that new shower." Cas grinned and Dean just laughed, "okay. I love you." he said finally looking into Cas' blue eyes, "I love you more." Cas smiled and quickly pecked his lips against Dean's.
“What’s wrong?” Cas whispered back.
“Daddy! Papa!” Henry yelled and ran over. “What taked you guys so long?”
"Uh, yeah… I um, I have something to tell you…" Benny started and Cas paused the movie so they could listen. "What did you get Andrea pregnant?" Dean chuckled, and Benny grinned just a little, "no… I um, I'm moving back to Louisiana. Like right after school." Benny said and everyone just stared at him in shock.
"You're such a saint for taking in Dean's mate…" the nurse, at the front desk said while her and Mary were talking about the weekend's events. "Well, of course I'm a little upset they're in this situation, but what's done is done." Mary sighed leaning on the counter. It had been a slow day at the hospital so she didn't really have much to do, she was picking at a scratch on the counter when the nurse spoke up. "Um, Mary is-isn't that your son?" she asked and Mary turned around and was frozen at the scene in front of her. Sam was running behind a gurney tears running down his face non stop, and Cas was at the gurney's side also crying and looking down.
Dean gasped after a few moments so Cas started bobbing his head faster and sucking a little harder. "Oh god, holy shit. Fuck!" Dean shouted and shot his load down Cas's throat. He swallowed and sat back, "tha- wow." Dean said coming down from his high, "do you, uh. Do you want me to help with that?" Dean asked noticing the obvious bulge in Cas's jeans. "If you want." Cas said and as soon as they began to shift positions Dean froze and looked terrified. "Dean? What's wrong?" Cas asked sitting up and went to touch Dean's check but he flinched away. "Cas, stay away, you gotta take me home. Like now!" Dean said and started breathing heavily.
"It's Dean's mom.." Cas said hitting the accept button,
Once they got comfortable with Cas still knotted, his phone started ringing. "Seriously?!" He groaned and they both hissed when Dean reached for it, "dude, it's your mom…" he said handing Cas' phone back. "Well this isn't going to be awkward…" he mumbled and answered.
“Dean. You went through a devastating event. If anyone should be apologizing, it should be me. I should have kept my own hormones in check and toughed it out.”
Dean grabbed the remote and turned the tv on and made sure the volume was low enough not to disturb Henry. He shoved a bite of the sweet and sour chicken into his mouth before sitting against the headboard.
“Me either. But I can’t imagine my life with out him, or Cas.”
Between his two and only friends his Mom and Sam, he couldn't tell them because he felt like he didn't want to burden them with his problems. Today was the first day of Junior year, sure Dean got good grades, the only class he actually enjoyed was his photography class. Dean shook himself out of his daze and cranked the water as hot as he could stand it and viciously scrubbed his skin, riding himself of any trace of his heat. "Fuck being an omega." Dean growled and threw his scent blocking soap on the floor and shut off the water.
"You still have a scent of watermelon on you." Cas mentioned and Dean broke off his kisses, "should stay with me as long as Henry nurses." He said not even bothering to look up at Cas, only too busy unbuckling his belt and pushing Cas' pants down freeing his erection.
They got the painting arranged and they headed back to the school. "It's weird coming here on a Saturday…" Dean said pulling into a parking space, Cas agreed and helped Dean carry things inside. They found Ms. Barnes right away and she showed them where to hang Dean's paintings, Ms. Holt already has your sketch up, I gotta say. You're very talented Dean. I know Mrs. Rosen will be happy with your set designs." Ms. Barnes said before walking off.
I woke up to Mary's blue eyes staring at me, "mama? Where's daddy?" Mary whispered and fresh tears started forming. "Daddy'll be home in a few days." I whispered back not knowing if it was the truth or not. I knew my heat was coming up in a few day's and I didn't know what do do, I want to talk to someone, but I don't know who… An hour later I picked up the phone, "Hello Cas, how are you honey?" Missouri's sweet voice calmed me down quickly, "Hi Missouri, I-uh.. Can you come over? I just really need to talk to someone." I said with my voice shaking a little "of course honey, I'll be over in a minute."
Mary went to hand Dean the wipe but stopped when she saw her son's eyes clenched shut, "Dean? Are you okay?" She asked and Tessa just handed Mary the picture and left the two, Dean shook his head no and took in a shaky breath. It was real, this was actually happening. 'I'm 16 years old and I'm going to be a parent.' he thought to himself and he felt the first hot tear roll down his cheek. He hated that he was crying so much lately, normally it took a lot for him to break down.
I was in a dead sleep when I heard a small voice. "Mama?… Mama wake up." I woke up and Mary was standing on my side of the bed with tears running down her face. "Mary, baby. What's wrong?" I asked sliding out of the bed crouching down to Mary's level and she wrapped her arms around me and started crying. "Mary, honey tell me what's wrong, you're scaring me." I whispered pushing her curls back and wiping her tears.
Hey guys, it’s not a chapter and I am SO SORRY! So much has been going on in my life lately and I just haven’t found the time to sit down and write. I really appreciate all of your comments and your patience! I’m hoping to sit down sometime this weekend and get a new chapter out for you guys. Please continue to be patient with me and I will try to get you all a new chapter. XOXO 💜
"I don't know why or how we have so many Christmas decorations." Dean grumped while we were digging through the boxes and I just threw packing peanuts at him. 2 hours later we finally got everything up the tree was decorated; "looks good." I sighed contently snuggling closer to Dean. I must have fallen asleep because I woke up to Dean yelling at Mary; "Mary stay away from the tree!… God damn it Mary Elizabeth, what did I just say!?"
“He was an angel.” Mrs. Bradbury smiled and handed Dean a plate with cupcakes.
Dean's eyes were wide and he was breathing kinda heavy, "Dean? What's wrong?" I asked getting nervous, "I-I remember. I remember all of the wedding! Every detail." Dean said still breathing heavily. "Oh my god really?! What else?! Do you remember anything else!?" I asked sitting up on my knees and cupped his face with my hands. "No, just the wedding. I remember freaking out so much and then Jess brought in Mary saying you knew I was freaking out and Mary would calm me down. I remember seeing you for the first time when you came dow Bobby's steps. I remember our vows, everything." Dean smiled and I smashed our mouths together and moved to straddle his hips. "Cas, what are you doing?" Dean gasped when we broke apart, "what's it look like?" I said and rolled my hips down causing us both to moan.
"Come on you guys let's see if the list is up!" Charlie said grabbing Benny's arm "calm down red." Benny huffed pulling his arm away. "Oh, really?! That's going to be awkward… Oh, and guys Benny owes us 20 bucks!" Charlie said running away from the list. "Well there's no point of me lookin' see you tomorrow." Benny said following Charlie. "Oh… Now I see why Charlie said that's going to be awkward…" Cas said cringing a little, "Dean look!" he said pointing to his name. "What!? Why do I have to be that? I'm perfectly fine with just scenery." Dean frowned and they walked away. "Hey, when we get home you can bake me a pie! That way you can get into your character!" Dean said jogging after Cas, "only if you narrate everything." he called back.
“Take your time. We’ll be alright, won’t we?” Cas asked Henry, who just nodded, too focused on his pizza.
"Okay, open your eyes!" Mary said letting go of Cas' hand and moved to the side, they opened their eyes and saw Sam standing in front of them, "Merry Christmas guys!" he yelled but Dean and Cas paid no attention. "M-mom, what is this?" Dean gasped looking at the new refurnished basement.
In his “art” room, Dean grabbed a blank sketch pad and his pencils.
I growled while unbuttoning his jeans. "Fuck." Dean whispered and picked me up so my legs were wrapped around his waist and carried me to the dinning room. Dean put me down once we were in the room and quickly got down to his knees taking all of my length into his mouth; "Fuck!" I yelled gripping Dean's hair as he bobbed his head. Dean stood up and removed his jeans and boxers and pushed me over the table so my ass was facing him, with out any warning he slammed in. "Ah! Fuck. I've missed you." I whimpered, "missed you too Cas." Dean said a little breathlessly.
“OOO thank you daddy!”
"Okay honey, I want you to go and take this." She said pulling the pregnancy test out of the bag. "Mom, I-I don't need that, I wasn't in heat when we had sex. I couldn't get pregnant." Dean said backing away, tears spilling down his face. "Dean, you can get pregnant out of your heat if you are true mates." Mary stated and Dean started sobbing, "mom! What if I-I am! I can't have a baby, I'm only 16!" He wrapped his arms around Mary and sobbed against her shirt breathing in her scent like he did when he was little. "I know baby, but we wont know until you take the test." Mary soothed running her fingers through her son's hair. "I'll leave you to it." She whispered kissing the top of his head and went back downstairs.
Once Henry was situated in his swing from Cas' mother he found a re-run of Dr. Sexy and kept the volume low and sat close to Cas and started eating. They ate in silence and once they were done, Dean decided to do a little bit of laundry. The only downside of moving to the basement is that he had to carry everything upstairs, he had already washed their sheets and Henry's crib sheets so he gathered his and Cas' clothes and trudged up the stares.
An hour later they finally had an outfit picked out, "thanks Charlie." Dean said and gave his friend a hug mindful of his ribs. "You're welcome, now I'm going to leave so you can take a shower and get ready. I trust you can make yourself look presentable." She teased, "yes, now go. Hey! Will you take Lucy out for me?" Dean called out, "sure!" Charlie yelled from down stairs and Dean went to go shower.
Once he was mostly dressed there was a soft knock on the door. “If it’s Cas go away. If not come in.” Dean yelled. Charlie poked her head in.
I said leading her up the stairs. "Okay, these are just some vitamins that I took, and these are the pills to help you with the morning sickness." I said handing her to small boxes. "Thank you, hopefully these work." Amelia said and we headed back downstairs; "there you are, are you ready to go?" Jimmy asked when we walked back to the living room. "Yes, Cas was just giving me some things to help with my morning sickness." She said putting on her jacket, we said our goodbyes and I went back and saw Mary starting to fall asleep on Charlie's lap.
A week went by and I still hadn't heard from the clinic and the stress was starting to get to me. I wasn't sleeping well and I was barley eating. "Cas, relax. Please, you haven't slept and when was the last time you actually ate a meal? Besides, all this stress isn't good for your body if we are going to have another baby." Dean finally said one night. "Come on, I'll draw you a bath then give you a back rub." He said pulling me off the couch and dragging me up the stairs. Dean stripped me down and started the water, "join me?" I asked as I climbed into the water and Dean took off his clothes and climbed in behind me so I could rest against his chest.
"Dean, I'm fine. Gabe, he went into labor and I want you here." I said and I heard Dean let out a breath he was probably holding.
Cas clung to his brother and let a new wave of tears flow. He saw Charlie sneak into the kitchen to give them some privacy and so she could start eating.
"And here we go! Looks like you got a boy and a girl! Congrats, now I'm assuming you'll want copies." Doc said already printing them out. "Cas! A little boy! I'm getting a little boy!" Dean said tears in his eyes, "and another little girl. Mary sweetie, you're going to have a little brother and a little sister!" I said after I wiped the gel off my stomach and tugged my shirt down.
Cas ground his hips against Dean's and they both moaned when their trapped erections rubbed agains each other. "God Cas, don't stop." Dean gasped and attacked Cas's mouth. Five minutes passed before they both came with long moans. "Fuck." Dean gasped and Cas just placed a small kiss on the side of Dean's neck. "Fuck indeed." He whispered and sat up, "I really hate to do this, but I should be going. My parent's will be wondering where I am." Cas said and Dean just nodded and followed Cas to the door and gave him one more kiss and watched him drive away. 'Yep, I'm screwed.' Dean said to himself.
“Are you sure? He can be kind of a handful…”
Both Dean and Cas woke with a start when the timer went off on Cas’ phone. Dean grumbled and clung onto Cas when he tried crawling out of bed. “Dean, if you want a pie that isn’t burnt I suggest you let me go.” Cas laughed.
“Uhh pizza!”
“Some words are just for grown ups. Not 3 year olds.” Dean told him.
“DEAN!” Cas yelled after him and followed. “Dean you can’t go in!”
“Good. I’m glad. I wish I could help you with that stuff.”
"You know, it's nice to finally have that damn cast off." Dean said once we got moving. "Yeah, I'm sure it's a lot easier for you now. And it'll be nice to have you there since Gilda's sick and I'm making Gabe stay home." I said, "yeah, why are you making Gabe stay home? He was so pumped for this." Dean asked, "because, he's 6 months pregnant, being on your feet for this long is going to kill him and I don't want to listen to him complain." I said, "uh, Cas… You're five months, how's that any different?"
Dean thought for a few seconds and sighed, “alright.”
“Hi aunt Charlie!” Henry yelled from the back.
"Why all day?" Dean asked,
"Thanks dad." Dean said and I followed him to the right hanger. I had already seen the damage done to the Impala, so I knew what we would be seeing but I grabbed Dean's hand right before we went in. Dean pushed open the door and froze, "oh baby." Dean whispered, let go of my hand and walked up to the Impala. "Oh my god Cas, how am I even alive?!" Dean said quietly when he saw the passenger side, "You gave it your best shot… Your heart stopped in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and once again during your coma." I said quietly a lump forming in my throat thinking back.
"So Dean, where's Cas taking you friday?" Mary asked, "what?! Dean you're going on a date?!" Sam said eyes wide, "yeah… Um I-I don't know, he said we would talk about it later since he sorta asked me during photography." Dean said focusing on his plate. "Oh, well I'm sure you'll have fun where ever he takes you." Mary said, "yeah, but not too much fun." Sam giggled "Samuel Jonathan!" Mary scolded and Dean blushed bright red. "Well, I do want to meet him so have him come over either tomorrow or an hour before your date." Mary said and Dean nodded.
“Well, he’s yelling loud enough Henry’s in my room crying because he thinks Dean’s hurt.” Charlie said.
"Dean, did you really just run down two flights of stairs to remind me of this did you?" he asked, "Cas. We didn't use a condom." Dean said finally getting his breath back and Cas froze. "Shit." Cas whispered, "uh, um w-we, do you think you'd be able to get pregnant that fast? I mean after already giving birth?" Cas asked, his turn to start panicking.
He worked on his homework long after Mrs. Tran left, so when Cas came home around 4 with Sam, they were both shocked to see Dean working. "Are my eyes deceiving me or is Dean doing homework?!" Cas teased, kissing the top of Dean's head as he walked by. "Shut up. I do my homework." he grumbled.
~_~_~_~
Anyone else totally fucked up by the latest episode of Spn?!
Dean could hear Naomi gasp at Dean's black eye, which was starting to look better, "oh dear, what happened?!" Naomi said and Cas was confused at the concern his mother showed. Dean was shocked but snapped out of it, "uh… Some guy at school jumped me… Got a nice bruise on my side too." He said trying to make a joke of it. "That's horrible." Naomi said, "well, it's good to meet you anyway Dean." Bartholomew said, "now dinner is almost ready so please make yourself at home." Cas's mother stated and they turned around and went back to the kitchen.
“Oh, hi mom.”
“That’s a good idea.”
“He’s alright. His oxygen is a little low that’s really the only issue, they’re waiting for him to wake up before they look at his lungs.”
She took my blood pressure and drew some blood, "okay Cas, I'll take this to the lab, it'll probably be a few day's before we get the results, but if you follow me, we'll get the scan, take a look and then you can go home." Dr. Maddison said and I followed her to another room. "Okay Cas, I'm going to have to have you strip down to your boxers, you can leave your shirt on but the metal in your jeans will mess up the scan." She explained and left the room to take my blood sample to the lab. I stripped down and laid on the table. The scan was quick, so once I was dressed again I followed the doctor back to our original room and she put the picture of the scan up on the board.
'See, everyone know's you're nothing but a waste of space. Your brother can't have friends because of you, your 'mate' is being kicked out of his family's lives because of you. Your dad, left, and your mom has to work even harder because of you. Why can't you see that you make everyone else's lives miserable.' the voice ranted and no matter how hard he snapped the hair tie or how hard he dug his nails into his palm, nothing worked.
Hi, I'm so sorry that it's been forever since I've updated. I'm such a shitty person for that... I just have a hard time writing now and I don't know why... I've got plans and ideas for this story, I just don't know how to quite get there yet. I'm sure I've lost most of the readers for this, so I'm sorry again for that. I'd love to hear from you guys, wether it's to let me know you're still interested in this or if it's to give me some ideas.
“Could you talk louder? I’m trying to listen.” Charlie’s voice startled them both. “Okay, well I think I’m going to go home, well back to my parents. See you later, thanks for listening Dean.” Charlie kissed his cheek and slid out of the bed.
“AMELIA! SHE IS NOT MY DAUGHTER! We have
“Why don’t you go take a nap?” Cas suggested.
“Charlie?” Dean walked up to her.
"My old friend Amelia was getting a bit obsessive so I told her to leave us alone and she did for a while then she kept trying to come on to me, so today after play practice she stopped me backstage and we were arguing and she kissed me. Apparently Dean saw it and stormed off before he saw me pushing her away." Cas explained. "Dean, honey calm down, I think Cas is telling the truth." Mary said softly.
“Do you want one?” Cas asked after grabbing one for himself.
"I'm sure you are. Have you had any thoughts about self harm lately?" He asked, "uh, briefly shortly after I got home with out him but I didn't act on it… I just kinda ran across my mind." Dean said playing with his hands. "Well, good for not acting on it, now, if I believe, you haven't self harmed since your accident?" Dr. Hansen said and Dean nodded.
“Don’t you dare!” Dean giggled but let Cas catch him.
So when Monday rolled around and when Dean woke up not in heat, he was a little curious… 'Probably nothing, it'll probably start later or tomorrow.' Dean thought to himself and went downstairs to watch tv. Dean spent the day watching tv and starting his paintings for the art show. He'd already drawn a picture of Lucy for the drawing half of the contest, so now he just needed something to paint.
Cas couldn't sleep much after so he turned on the TV in the room and had it on low. By time 7:30 rolled around, Dean was still out but there was a soft knock on the door. Cas slid out of the bed and pulled the door open and gasped; "mother? W-what are you doing here?" he asked, "your father and I had a very long argument about this, but I-I needed to see me grandchild." Naomi said a little teary eyed.
"Shit." Cas said getting up to go after Dean he went to the bathroom door and knocked. "Dean?" when he got no answer he pushed the door open, and saw Dean sitting on the closed toilet with his head in his hands. "Dean baby, please don't stress yourself right now." Cas said softly moving to kneel in front of Dean, a movement he noticed he does a lot, he carefully pulled his hands away. He gripped both of them in one hand and lifted Dean's head with his other.
“Hey, are you home?”
"I'm the owner, Zachariah wants me there so he can make sure everything's perfect and besides, I'll have a chair to sit in every now and then." We pulled into the parking lot of the community center and started pulling everything out of the van. "Oh you're here! Fantastic. If you'll follow me I have the tables set up for you and everything and Castiel I know you requested a chair for you so I will go find one." Zachariah said and left us to set up. When we finally got everything set up, I felt a sharp kick to my side.
“Please tell me you didn’t drive.” Dean whispered.
“No, I know. I just was still in my dream I guess when I woke up and you tried touching me. I was yelling at you in my dream… Told you you’d never see Henry again and when I went to leave I fell down the stairs. That’s when I woke up.” Dean curled into Cas and let him rub his back.
"I'm only a beta so I can't really do anything to stop him, but just know Castiel, that I didn't want you to leave, or Gabriel. I'm sorry for how things have gone down, but we're moving to California… I'll try to keep in touch with you but I can't make any promises." Naomi said and handed Henry over. "Goodbye Castiel." she whispered and for the first time since Cas was little, Naomi kissed his cheek. She ran a finger down Henry's cheek and left.
“Dean!” Charlie yelled and stood in front of him. “Cas already went in.”
Dean sat on bench outside of the shower stalls while Jessica cleaned up. “Dean?”
He then sent a more personal message to his brother,:
“Uh, no.”
“No bud, just you. Aunt Ellen wasn’t special Henry time.” Dean decided to pick Henry up since he was much like his daddy and papa and isn’t a morning person. He carried him to the bathroom and got Henry to go potty before washing his hands and brushing his teeth.
Dean sat in the tub shivering from both the cold water and his heat, all he wants is Cas and he doesn't know why. I mean sure, they were boyfriends and he was an alpha; but Dean never craved an alpha before. Dean though about tonights events, how good it felt to be touched. He felt his dick twitch so he ran his hand down his chest and slowly started stroking himself.
Hi guys! Sorry for a short chapter and it's kind of a jumpy one but not too bad... I just wanted a little filler chapter before I get back into the plot... Anyway, like always let me know what you think, I love hearing from you guys! Enjoy! :)
“Yeah!” Henry giggled and squirmed out of Deans arms.
They stayed in silence while Charlie styled his hair. “Alright, were done. But I want you to try something.”
The way to the hospital, Dean stayed quiet. He just stared at the window and wished today never happened or even if he had his blade. Shaking his head as if to clear his thoughts he shifted in his seat and absently scratched at his wrist.
Cas was shocked at Sam's answer but was happy he felt that way, he grabbed the chips and a big bowl and went back downstairs. Cas set the food and placed the drinks in the fridge and headed towards the bedroom to wake up Dean, knowing Charlie would be here shortly. He was halfway to their room when the bathroom door opened and a very sleepy Dean walked out rubbing his eye, "hey, your up." Cas smiled, "humph, damn kid wouldn't stop jumping on my bladder." he yawned. "Well, don't go back to sleep, I held Charlie off as long as I could but her and Benny should be here in about 20 minutes." Cas said ushering Dean to the couch, "I'll get your glasses."
“Call if you need anything.” Mary told both Dean and Cas.
Once Henry was all cleaned up, Dean got him in his car seat and loaded up the Impala. “Thanks again Ellen.”
"Oh, well it's none of my business what you two fought about so, I'll head home then. You okay to take him upstairs?" John asked "uh, help would be nice I don't know how well he's going to do with stairs at the moment." I asked shifting under his weight. 5 minutes later we finally got Dean into our bedroom and we dropped him onto the bed where he started giggling. "Idiot." John grumbled and patted my shoulder and left. I started pulling off Dean's boots and socks when I heard him start snoring; I rolled my eyes and continued to strip him down to his boxers and under the covers.
“No. It’s not.” Charlie argued and dragged him to the bathroom.
“Okay, still, say goodnight to everyone else.” Dean told him. Henry made his rounds and made sure to give Dean and Cas a longer hug before running over to Mary. She picked him up and carried him up the stairs.
“You ready for bed?” Cas asked.
~0~0~0~0~
"Next contraction I need you to push hard for me Dean." Tessa said and Dean took a big breath, brought his chin to his chest and pushed. "That's it Dean, keep going honey." Mary encouraged, "oh my goooddd!" Dean almost yelled after taking a breather, he grabbed Cas' hand and pushed again.
“Alright, give me like half an hour then I’ll be there.”
"You're coming with me tomorrow right?" Dean asked once he and Cas were a their lunch table, "of course. Then we can go to my place and tell my parents. They got home a few days ago so they should be back to 'normal'." Cas smiled. "What's tomorrow?" Charlie asked, "my uh… My one month check up." Dean said blushing a little, "ooohhhh! You better show me the sonogram." she demanded and went back to her lunch. Dean leaned over, "I have something to show you." he whispered in Cas' ear. "Oh yeah and what is that?" he whispered back, "you'll see after lunch." Dean grinned and pecked Cas' cheek.
“Yeah, I need to borrow the suburban. We’re going to move some of Charlie’s things and we don’t have enough room.” Dean explained.
“You slut.” Amelia shrieked. “You will hear from my lawyer.”
“Dean, that’s a wonderful idea. I love it.” Cas said as he rinsed the shampoo out of Dean’s hair.
~_~_~_~
Picking up on the panic in Cas’ voice, Dean’s heart started racing. “Cas? What’s wrong?”
"You told Charlie and Benny to bring their lunch today right?" Dean asked pulling out a bag out of Henry's diaper bag, "yes, they will be here." Cas said not bothering to look away from Henry. Dean put a sandwich chips and a bottle of water in front of Cas while he put things out for himself when Charlie and Benny walked in. "Alright! Hand him over!" She said throwing her bag on the floor and a brown bag on the table, she reached down and took Henry from Cas and sat down. "How is it you get cuter and cuter everyday?" She asked in a baby voice earning a small smile from Henry, "ugh, you're gonna be a heartbreaker when you're older."
“Can we talk about it later? After Henry’s in bed?” Dean asked, his appetite gone.
“How’s Henry?” Gabe asked.
Cas smiled a little and wiped away Dean's remaining tears. And they both were assaulted with the smell of watermelon making them both chuckle. "I guess the pup was feeling left out." Dean said moving a hand down to the bump. "I guess so." Cas smiled and helped Dean up; once he splashed some water on his face Cas handing him his glasses and they went back to their room.
"Alright, just text me next time you do that okay?" Mary asked and went back to breading the chicken. "He-hey mom?" Dean asked quietly and sat at the island so he was across from Mary. "Hmm?" "A-about last night… I really am sorry, I shouldn't have said any of that." Mary stopped what she was doing and looked up and Dean could see the tears in her eyes. "I know sweetie. But just know that I'm only doing this to protect you. I even gave Sam a curfew to make things fair." Mary said and made Dean laugh, "you gave Sammy a curfew?! He never goes anywhere besides Andy's!" Dean said "yeah, well it's only fair" Mary shrugged tears long forgotten. "So how was your day?" "Good, um… Cas and I.. We uh." Dean started trying to figure out what to say, "you and Cas what?" "We… haveadate." Dean said so fast Mary almost didn't hear him. "What? Honey that's great. When is it?" Mary smiled, "uh friday." Dean said smiling too, he left Mary alone to start on his homework.
Jessica nodded her head and started rocking a bit. “Okay, mind if I tell you a little story?” Jessica looked over at Dean and nodded.
After dinner, Dean and Cas were washing and putting away dishes when Cas brought up the fight. "So, Charlie slapped Amelia today." he started and Dean dropped the bowl he was cleaning back in the sink, "she what?! Why?! And why did I have to miss it damn it?!" he huffed, "they were at each other's throats and Amelia called her ugly and that's when Charlie lost it, Benny and I had to literally pull them apart. In fact, Benny carried Amelia outside." Cas chuckled.
“I told you!” Charlie nudged him. She was right, it was subtle enough that you couldn’t tell he was wearing mascara but it did make his lashes darker and make his green eyes pop.
Cas took Henry from Dean and carried Henry up the stairs. Dean sat back down next to Charlie and his phone rang. “Hey Sammy.”
“I will, goodnight.” Dean said softly and kissed her cheek before getting out of bed and leaving the room.
Dean replied saying he can get off early and come home in about an hour. Mary was asleep snoring softly as I gently rocked the recliner and I eventually began to drift only to jolt awake when Mary started moving. At first I thought she was just adjusting her self but she wouldn't stop moving, "Mary?" I whispered trying to wake her up thinking she was having a bad dream when she started to shake uncontrollably, "Mary! No no no… Oh god Mary wake up!" I shouted holding her down.
“What? Why?” Cas asked and reached for Dean’s shampoo and began massaging it into his scalp.
“Charlie, spit it out.” Dean interrupted.
"You sure?" Dean asked and I nodded, "just be gentle." I whispered and moaned when Dean slowly sunk in. "Oh god, when was the last time we did this?!" Dean moaned and slowly started rocking into me. "I-I don't remember." I started laughing which quickly turned to a moan when Dean hit my prostate.
“Almost papa, gotta brush my teef… No daddy I want dose.” Henry frowned and pointed to his dinosaur pajamas.
"If that's alright with you of course." Cas chimed in; "what do your parents think of it Cas?" Mary asked, "they're out of town, I called them and informed them of the weekend and they just told me to be safe and to call Gabe if I have problems.. Which is odd, because I'm sure Gabe will be with us." he said. "Alright, as long as you
Henry looked up from his blocks when Dean came up behind the couch. “DADDY!” he ran towards Dean who quickly picked him up, wincing slightly at the pull of his fresh cuts.
do that again.” Dean cried.
They sat there for awhile munching on chips when Dean felt his phone buzz in his pocket. He slid his phone out and saw that he was getting a call from Cas, he slid off the stool and went to the living room. "Hello."
"Cas, Sam. Stay outside the room." Mary said turning back to her son, "but-" "now!" Mary yelled and they both flinched but went outside. 20, very long minutes later, Mary came out of Dean's room. She saw Cas pacing a little down the hall and Sam hand his face hidden in his hands while sitting in a chair. "Cas." she called out and he ran over, "is he okay?" he asked, voice shaking a little. "He's stable. You found him just in time, any longer and we would have lost him." Mary said, her own voice breaking at the end.
Cas chuckled, “good. Let’s get some sleep.”
"Thank you so much Missouri, you're a life saver." I said running up the steps with her and Mary in tow. "No need to thank me, I may be a beta but I know how tough heats can be. It's a good thing you got home so quickly, being a beta my senses aren't as strong but I'm starting to smell you. Now tell me what Mary needs for the night and lets get her things ready to go so John can just pick her up at my place." Missouri said heading up the stairs.
“Well congrats Charlie. You didn’t need to move out now.” Dean said.
Cas hissed at the sudden coldness on the overheated flesh, "Dean you're wearing too much clothing." Cas frowned and helped Dean out of his shirt and pants, "that's better." he mumbled and slowly pushed Dean onto the bed and crawled on top of him. "Thank you for tonight. I love you Cas, so fucking much." Dean whispered, "I'd do anything for you Dean, I love you too." Cas also whispered and ducked down to capture Dean's lips.
“I’m sorry!” Dean sobbed.
"Sam, go watch Henry. I'm taking Dean to the hospital." Bobby said and Dean just glanced at the back of the Impala, slut was now down to 'ut' and there was red water running down the driveway. "He's asleep, he should hopefully stay asleep til Cas get's home." Dean said and got in the truck.
He eyed Bobby as he made his way to the table, "Bobby? Is everything okay?" Cas asked nervously, his head shot up not realizing that his class was slowly spilling in… "Oh uh… Stay after class, Cas… I-I have something to tell you." Bobby said and took a long drink out of his water bottle before starting class. "Alright settle down, now, I got some personal family things goin' on right now, so I'm pushing your deadline of the family collage back to wednesday, for those who already finished kudos to you, maybe add a little more to it? And for those who haven't finished, well get too it."
"What do I do?" Dean whispered, eyes becoming wet, "talk to him, get to know him a little bit. Maybe he'll even ask you out. Bobby said he was an alpha, but just because he is, don't feel like you have too. Just because you're an omega does
Right as Mary went to help Dean the doorbell rang. "Caaaasssss." Dean moaned and a tear slipped out, "mom, get Cas." he pleaded not knowing why he had the sudden need to have Cas next to him. Mary went to the door quickly, grabbing Lucy on the way to put her outside, as soon as she opened the door, Cas could tell something was wrong.
“Well then don’t break her heart.” Amelia stated and opened the door. “Claire honey, come on in.” Claire stood up off the front steps and ran in.
"Hi baby, were you good for Missouri?" I asked kissing her cheek; "she was a perfect little angel." Missouri said letting me into the house. "We made cookies!" Mary smiled still clinging to me when I sat down, "you did?!" I asked and got a big smile and Mary shook her head yes. Missouri came back in and set down a cup of tea, "thank you." I said and switched Mary to my other leg when the other one began to fall asleep. "So honey, how was your date?" Missouri asked, "it was really good, uh… Mary sweetie, go play so Missouri and I can talk."
He took a sip of his beer, playing with the bottle a little. An awkward silence fell upon them, no one knew what to say now that Dean was back and safe. “Do you wanna talk about what happened?” Sam asked after a moment, hesitantly. Dean shook his head, taking another sip. “No, I’m good. I think I’m just gonna hit the hay, I’m exhausted.” He replied, finishing the beer and getting up. He said goodnight to the pair and left the kitchen, hoping he could rest easy after all he’d been through. Nothing was ever so easy, though. He inevitably ended up having nightmares about what happened to him. He jumped awake in a sweat, hearing footsteps and briefly, irrationally, feeling a panic bubble up in his chest. He quickly relaxed when he heard Cas' voice, though, telling him he could come in. “Are you alright? I heard screaming.” Castiel asked with a concerned frown, walking over to the bed. Dean flushed and nodded a little, turning the lamp on before running a hand down his face tiredly. “Yeah, it was just a bad dream, that’s all.” He replied, though unable to keep how shaken he really was from Cas. The angel could tell just by a look, even if Dean tried to hide it. “Do you want to talk about it?” Cas asked as he sat on the edge of the bed.
When Dean put the sheet in front of Cas, he spoke up, "Dean, I-I don't think it's a good thing to talk to the teacher like that." Cas said quietly so only Dean could hear him and Dean started laughing, like holding his stomach and wiping away tears laughing. "I-I don't understand, what's so funny? Dean talking back to teacher's isn't polite and it can get you in trouble." Cas said frowning, "Cas, man. Bobby don't give a shit, he's my uncle. Only I talk to him like that. It's okay." Dean said once he got his breath back, "oh, Oh! Okay uh that makes sense." Cas said dropping his gaze to the table.
“Sorry.” Dean started slowing down but picked up the speed about 10 minutes later.
"I'll see you boys at home." Mary said kissing the top of Cas' head on her way out. "Uh, Tessa… C-Can I ask you something?" Cas asked, "of course." she said turning back around to face him. "Uh, it's kind of embarrassing…" he started, "you want to know when it's safe to have sex again don't you?" she smirked and Cas turned bright red and just nodded and found the floor very interesting, "i-it's just that uh… My rut is coming up next month and I uh, I didn't know if I needed to stay with my brother so I wouldn't hurt him." Cas mumbled.
“No not now.” Dean groaned, not have hearing his father’s voice in his head since high school.
Dean pulled into a spot that was open next to Cas’ suburban and texted him. He shut the impala off and got out when he saw Cas walking up.
"Easy, dare." Ash just grinned, "I dare you to chug that whole beer in one go." Charlie just snickered and started chugging, "that's right bitches!" She yelled once she downed the thing and belched. "Baby, hand me another." Charlie said, "alright, Dean truth or dare?" She continued. "Um, truth." "Do you love Cas?" Everyone gasped and looked at her, "what?! It's a simple question." Dean just looked into his boyfriends eyes and smiled, "yeah, yeah I do." and he leaned in for a soft kiss. "AWWW" came from all the girls. "Alright, Benny truth or dare."
?" Cas said, "ugh, fine. But I'm coming back tomorrow." He said grabbing his clothes out of the duffle and slowly walked to the bathroom.
“Yeah?”
Weeks went by and April was now almost over, and Dean and I were going out. Missouri had agreed to watch Mary for the night since Dean and I hadn't had a actual date in a while. It was 6:30 when Missouri came over to pick up Mary, "okay bug, be good for Missouri and daddy and I will come get you tomorrow." I said kissing her forehead. "She already ate so she should be good to go." I said handing Mary's bag over. "Don't worry about a thing honey. You and Dean have a good night." Missouri smiled and walked over to her house.
“Dean. I have to get to work.” Cas said softly but Dean didn’t even look at him. “Henry’s downstairs with your mom, please eat some of the breakfast I brought up for you.” still no answer. With a sigh Cas just kissed Dean’s forehead and left the room.
Charlie spoke a few words but they weren’t heard by Dean. He just continued to grip Cas’ hands. All he knew is suddenly Henry was at his side holding two boxes. “Here daddy.” Henry said and handed him the blue velvet box.
“Aw that’s cute. Are you going to let her?”
"Ho-how did we not know?" I asked still staring at the monitor, "well, considering you're only two months and the first month they didn't separate like they normally do. But seeing as they're separate, it'll more than likely be a boy and a girl, but we wont know for a while." Dr. Maddison explained, printed of copies and I put my shirt down and sat up. "Okay Cas, since you're already bigger than last time, is there anything else different from your previous pregnancy?"
“No.” Sam glared.
Once they pulled apart they turned around to their family who was clapping and cheering and they headed down the aisle and into the house.
Once Dean was out of the way, Cas carefully picked up his sleeping son and carried him down the hall, trying not to wake him up in the process. “Papa?” Henry whined.
“H-hey.” Sam finally spoke.
“He will when she talks. She’s not talking now is she?” Cas glared.
20 minutes later Jo and Ellen walked in and found Dean in the living room upstairs with Lucy. "Hey, you got like a whole set up downstairs, why you up here?" Jo asked plopping down next to him. "I dunno, just felt like being up here." Dean said and bumped his shoulder against Jo's.
Dean said, his ears turning red and he saw Cas stop and stare at him.
Since he couldn't sleep he quietly grabbed the diaper bag out of their room and went to the nursery to pack a few things to take to the hospital and then threw a few pairs of his and Cas' clothes into a bag, finally around 2 in the morning Dean crawled back into bed and fell asleep. By time morning rolled around Dean groaned and woke up looking for Cas, he stretched and felt a small twinge in his stomach; Dean just shrugged and considered it over stretching. He went upstairs andCas with Mary and Sam. "Hey, feel any better?" Cas asked and he just shrugged, sat down and slumped into Cas' side.
Right off the living room was a big bathroom with double sinks a walk in glass shower and a separate tub, next to the bathroom was the master bedroom with a king sized bed already in, with two dressers and two separate closets. "Oh my god, this is huge!" Cas said looking around the room, it was painted in a soft dark cream color. Next was a medium sized room, "ooh, this can be the nursery Cas!" Dean said pulling Cas in further into the room. "The crib can go here," Dean said pointing to the wall, "a-and the changing table can go here." he said gesturing to the opposite wall.
Hey guys... PLEASE don't be mad at me... It has been a shit show the past few months. I lost my grandpa suddenly and I was super close to him so it hit me hard. Then I had to up root my life and move and I just now am starting to get in the groove of things. Any way enjoy the chapter. <3
“I got you.” Cas whispered in Dean’s ear.
“Have you seen her around?”
Dean set Henry down on the island counter and went into the pantry to get the macaroni noodles. “Papa, I want hotdog not a burger.”
“Get to the school. I’m on my way there now for crowd control.”
He didn't know how, but he knew something was wrong with Dean. "Hi Cas, um give me just a second, let me put Lucy outside." Mary said and chained Lucy up so she wouldn't run away, "okay follow me. Uh I should tell you, Dean had a small accident. He'll be okay don't worry." Mary reassured him when he saw Cas start to panic, "Lucy just knocked him off his feet and he landed on his bad side, so I need you to help me get him off the floor, he's too heavy for me to get him up and I need you to keep him calm while I check his ribs." Mary said and Cas just nodded and followed her into the house.
"Okay, so the results wont be up till tomorrow, so I say we rent the movie and we can break in your new living room. Charlie suggested at lunch. "Okay, I do have to work for a few hours after school though." Cas said. "Okay, we'll come over around 6:30." Benny suggested.
“I don’t know I kinda thought about Benny or even Charlie.” Sam shrugged.
Five minutes later Coach Rufus blew his whistle, "alright ladies! We're done for the day." He called out and everyone grabbed their towels and met the coach in the center of the room. Dean couldn't hear the conversation but he could see everyone nodding every now and then and they were dismissed. Cas walked over to Dean drying his arms in the process. "Hey." he said still a little breathless. "Hey, how was practice?" Dean asked kissing Cas's cheek real quick. "Long. Give me a few minutes and I'll be out." Cas said, "okay, you can shower at my house, so hurry up." Dean winked and Cas just chuckled and walked to the locker room.
“What can we do?”
Charlie came running into the room, “what the hell is going on in here!?”
Dean got back home and plopped down next to his mom on the couch. "Hey sweetie. How was school?" Mary asked turning down the tv. "Good. Long, boring mostly." Dean grinned, "uh huh. So what are you and Cas going to do tonight?" She asked, "uh, I'm going to pick him up after practice and he's going to shower here real quick, then I think we're just going to go to the Roadhouse and go to our spot for a while then come back here and hang out for a bit." Dean said and laid his head on his mom's shoulder for the remanning time he had before he went to pick up Cas.
Dean pulled up the driveway and they met Mary in the kitchen. "Hi boys. How was school?" She asked, "Fine. Boring." Cas and Dean answered at the same time and Mary just laughed and let them go upstairs. The went into Dean's room and Dean began getting some clothes to change into for tonight. Cas set his duffle on the edge of the bed and pulled out his clothes.
he smiled,
“Oooo thank you!” Dean grinned and immediately dug in.
“Papa tuck me in.” Henry sniffed.
“Well then it’s a good thing I made you these.” Mary said startling both Dean and Cas. She set down two miniature apple pies in front of Dean.
“So, Sam you going to tell us why you’ve been in a bitchy mood all day?” Dean asked.
"Sounds good Cas. See you then." Dean said and hung up the phone, and when he turned around Mary and Sam were standing in the living room with him smiling. "Really?! You guy's couldn't have given me 5 minutes of privacy!?" Dean groaned but smiled anyway. "Sorry sweetie, we both are just happy that you found someone." Mary smiled, "mom, I haven't found anything. It was just going to be a date, now we're just hanging out." Dean said his blush returning.
"I-it's the only way to get him to shut up." Dean continued to whisper, "to get who to shut up?" Sam asked and grabbed the gauze to wrap Dean's bicep. "The voice. Dad's voice. I-in my head Sammy." Dean said crying silently. "It's going to be okay." Sam said once Dean's arm was wrapped. "Now, give me your blade or whatever you use to cut yourself with." Sam said, "what?" Dean asked looking up at him. "Blade. Now." Sam said holding out his hand, Dean pushed his glasses up and retrieved the blade taped in the cabinet.
He waved at a few nurses as he got closer to Henry and he felt his heart flutter a little when he saw his pup sleeping. He had his little hand in his mouth and he was sucking on it, Dean chuckled a little and carefully picked him up. Henry made little snuffling noises as Dean moved them into a chair; he smelt his father and Henry blinked open his eyes. "Hi baby." Dean whispered and smiled, "how's my boy doing today?" he asked and chuckled when Henry grunted, as if he was answering his daddy.
“Yeah, I’ve got my appointment in the morning.”
"What's up?" Dean asked, "I just wanted to make sure you guys were still planning on coming over tonight." Bobby said, "Oh, um mom said she'll try to make it, uh one of the nurses has something going on and is having trouble finding someone to cover her shift, so mom said she might be working a double. But Sammy and I will be there as long as there's pie." Dean smiled. "You and your pie." Bobby rolled his eyes, "alright get, I'll see you at 6." Bobby said and Dean waved and made his way to the door, only to almost run Castiel over. "Shit Cas, you can't just stand in front of the door!" Dean said catching them both before they fell, "sorry, I just uh, I wanted to wait for you." Cas said and looked down to see both their hands on each other's arms. Dean followed his gaze and let go, "alright, come on, I'm starving."
Castiel. He was suspicious, sure, but he didn't consider that it could be the actual angel shrunken down and pretty much paralyzed. He walked over with a frown, picking up the toy and the note before sitting down on the edge of his bed.
The elder Winchester rolled over, lazily grabbing the blanket to cover them and cuddling up close to Cas as he enjoyed the afterglow of his orgasm. “Dean, that was...amazing. Sex is amazing.”
Dean smiled, eventually coming to a stop and leaning against a tree. “So, when I wake up in the morning you won’t be there?” He asked, watching Cas expectantly for his answer. In actuality Dean had grown kinda fond of it. It reminded him that he really did have a guardian angel on his shoulder. Watching over him, keeping him safe. It was nice.
Dean wasted no time in pressing the toy against his ass, bring his finger and thumb up to hold Cas' head and rub his face in tight, merciless circles against the puckered muscle. It sent shivers all though him and he moaned again, rubbing the angel up and down between his cheeks before pressing his small head against his hole once more. Cas wished to god he could at least struggle, could get Dean to stop, but he couldn't do anything but just take it. His body was held tightly as his face was pressed against the wrinkled skin, passing though the humid opening this time and twisted to go in easier. Everything was much much tighter in here and the smell was overbearing. The heat, too. He was starting to sweat as he was slowly pushed in further, the muscles clenching and unclenching as they got used to the foreign object. He could hear Dean moaning all around him, feeling his heartbeat pulse loudly in the distance. His feet and ankles were still held by Dean's fist but the rest of him was inside, the hot walls gripping him tightly with barely any release.
“Just peachy.” Dean grumbled, taking a couple painkillers with Cas.
was great." Dean hummed tiredly, lying back against Cas' fingers. The angel smiled, trailing a playful finger down Dean's chest. "There's more where that came from." He replied, giving him another moment to rest before flowing his grace through him and doing it all over again. He played with Dean for hours, bringing him and himself to orgasm over and over again in a number of different ways with only a few breaks in between to rest and eat. By the time they was done it was very late and both men were pretty exhausted and ready for sleep. Cas let Dean stay on his chest, being gentle with him of course. They both fell asleep pretty quickly, Cas laying a protective hand over Dean to cover him with the warmth of his palm.
"I heard you, you know. That conversation you had with Gabriel in the kitchen. You knew it was me and yet you used me as a masturbatory aid again anyway." Castiel said, voice booming to his tiny ears. Dean flinched at the volume, but then realization hit him. "Oh."
“Yeah? Well, good luck with that. I’ve been to hell, there’s nothing you can’t throw at me that I haven’t already been through. It’s not like I’ll be here long anyway, my brother will be looking for me. And once I get outta here, I’m going to kill you.” The guy smiled, cold and clearly unfazed. “Oh that's not going to happen, sweetheart. Not for a while, anyway. We’re gonna have so much fun until then, though. If you’ve been to hell already like you say then you’ll feel right at home here. I think I’ll go with the more...psychological torture with you. You are a handsome devil, after all.” He replied with a chuckle, putting the knife aside and instead wrapping his arms around Dean's neck. “Now, before we get started why don’t you tell me your name?” He asked, getting more comfortable on the hunter’s lap by rubbing himself against him, making Dean breath hard out of nose and clutch harder at the chair. “My name? Oh, sure, it’s bite me.” He snarled, instinctively trying to back himself further into the chair as the man pressed himself closer, face only inches away with a smirk. “Be careful what you wish for.” He whispered, before closing the distance and forcing himself upon the struggling hunter.
shaving my hair like that. No matter how much you like it.”
He kept going like that for a while, relishing in the feeling of their cocks rubbing together. When he wanted more he moved his free hand down to stroke them together, feeling Cas' hand squeeze his shoulder as he sucked a dark mark on his neck. He didn’t keep a slow pace for long, too eager and aroused for that. No, he wanted it fast and messy, loving the unabashed moans of pleasure coming from Cas.
“Well then, I guess that makes us a couple?” He asked, instinctively sitting closer. “Yes, I guess it does.” Cas replied softly, placing his hand over Dean's. He couldn’t quite believe the way that progressed either. He’d heard the prayer, sure, but now he had actual confirmation about Dean's feelings for him. “So, would you like me to stay and watch over you?” He asked, waiting as Dean considered it. “O-Okay. Yeah, sure. Thanks.” Dean replied, feeling much more at ease with Cas there. He lied back down, watching as Cas ran a gentle hand through his hair. The touch sent a pleasant shiver down his spine, relaxing him enough to go back to sleep. They’d have plenty more time to talk tomorrow. Cas turned the light off, wishing him goodnight.
“So, you remember last night now?” He asked, staring at his coffee.
Whatever his thoughts, last night was about to be explained to them and they should hopefully start to remember.
Dean pulled away with a flushed face, licking his lips as he carried on staring at Cas. “Okay...’night Sam...” He murmured distractedly, swallowing his nerves. He distantly heard his brother say goodnight to Cas as well before hastily heading to his bedroom, leaving them alone together.
Sam snorted a little, humouring him for now. “Okay. Dean, truth or dare?”
“Goodnight, Dean.”
chaining his right hand to Cas' left. “What the hell? Why—? What the hell!” He exclaimed, meeting Cas' confused expression with his now pissed off one.
. He whimpered, wishing for all this to be over. Dic was just getting started, though, eventually replacing the tongue with his cock and once again straddling Dean's hips to press himself close. The mix of pain and pleasure became even more intertwined with rough, hard thrusts that repeatedly hit his prostate. The only thing he could do was shut his eyes tightly and try to pretend he was anywhere but there, with someone he loved having sex with him rather then the rape that it was. He thought of his angel, his sweet smile and ocean blue eyes. It wouldn’t be the first time he fantasised about Castiel, in fact those thoughts had started getting more frequent the more time they spent together. He found himself falling more and more in love with each passing day. And right now, he wished to god he was with Cas. Feeling loved rather then humiliated like this. He found himself praying against his better judgment, begging for help. He didn’t mean to spill his feelings out, it just happened.
After that night Dean and Cas started actually classing themselves as a couple, making up for lost time with affectionate touches and make out sessions. Apart from that, though, not much changed. They still stared all the time and worried over each other, still often making Sam feel like the third wheel. It took months for Dean to start feeling like himself again after what happened,
“What? ‘M curious.” Dean defended, looking at Cas expectantly.
"I'm really sorry again, man. Come on, let's go get Gabe to turn you back." The hunter said once Cas was ready, letting him onto his palm so he could carry him. The tiny angel simply nodded, holding onto his fingers as he sat in his hand. Now that he could actually look around and concentrate on his surroundings properly he realized just how scary and overwhelming it was to be this small, he was so vulnerable and weak. He couldn't wait to be back to normal. The walk to Gabriel's room wasn't too bad, but even though Dean was holding him securely every step still shook his whole body and sounded ten times louder then they usually would, making him incredibly uneasy. Still, it didn't take long at least. Dean got straight to the point when he knocked on the door and entered the room, expressing Cas' anger for him since the tiny angel didn't exactly look threatening like this. "Alright, you've had your fun, time to turn Cas back to normal."
“Does this make us lovers?” Cas asked after a moment, nuzzling a little at his hair. Dean flushed at the question, not sure where they would go after this.
"Are you really going to do this to me, Cas?" Dean asked with more of a challenging tone then a fearful one. He did trust Cas, after all.
“Alright, new game! Truth or dare.” Exclaimed the elder hunter, taking another shot and pointing at Sam. “You pick first, Sammy.”
Dean licked his lips and looked away as he answered, and was that a blush covering his cheeks? “How should I know? I can’t control my dreams.”
“Is that how you see me when you dream?” He asked.
At least the main torture was over with now, Cas thought, and he could finally recover his sore, used body a little. He wasn't sure what was going to happen now, it seemed as though Dean wasn't going to remove him for a good while and he doubted Gabriel would release him and turn him back just yet. He just hoped it wouldn't take Dean too long to figure out it was the real him he'd been using as a sex toy now.
him. It was in the heat of the moment, he didn’t mean for it to happen. Now he was going to have to talk to him, wasn’t he? He had to know if Cas heard it, if it was going to change their whole dynamic. Maybe it was a good thing, it was bound to come out eventually.
alone, he now had an angry angel squirming and kicking against the buttplug in his ass. He put his mug down and hurried back to his bedroom as he considered what to do. He felt really bad what he put Cas through and should get him out right away, but
“Oh, I didn’t drink nearly as much as you guys did. Wait, you do remember how last night went, don’t you?” Sam asked, smiling wider when the looks each of them gave showed the answer to that question. “Oh my god, you don’t remember!” He chuckled, before getting an annoyed punch on the arm.
Sam sipped his coffee once he finished with his explanation, still smiling as he looked at the pair. Dean and Cas both looked a bit uncomfortable, having started to recall how they’d acted. How much they’d flirted with each other throughout the evening. How it had felt to kiss. What happened
It felt like forever for the bastard to come, filling his insides up with heat. He didn’t stop there, though, jerking Dean off with the sole purpose of forcing him to come too. There was no fighting it, he couldn’t stop his body from reacting to the stimuli. He barely stopped himself from moaning as he came, exhausted and spent. Dic pulled away, getting himself dressed and grabbing his camera to take another picture. “Wha--?” Dean didn’t have any time to react as he heard the snap, opening his eyes with a frown. “You stay here and rest, baby. I’ll be back later.” Dic said as he grabbed a butt plug, putting it in Dean's ass. The hunter whimpered and watched his kidnapper leave, leaving him cold and alone.
“So, last night, huh? Pretty fun.” Sam remarked, earning an annoyed scowl from both Cas and Dean. “What’s up with you? How come you’re not hungover?” Dean asked, sitting down at the table with his friend.
Beside him was...himself. Well, a version of himself anyway. Certainly not a version he would have ever expected to see though. The dream Castiel had the sides of his head shaven in a rather punk rock fashion and a weapons belt clipped around his waist, right above the black cargo pants his was wearing. He was carrying a rifle with him, which was casually perched against his shoulder as he walked. A bullets belt was slung over his other shoulder diagonally covering his shirtless chest, and upon closer inspection he appeared to have a pentagram tattooed on the side of his head. It was certainly...surprising to see to say the least.
and judging by the size of the bulge in his pants his member was bigger then Dean too. The tiny hunter looked all the way up to Cas' face, easily spotting the arousal there from a mile away. "Now, I want you to strip for me, Dean." He was ordered.
“And you like that look on me?”
wanting to end up where he thought he was going to. Getting licked felt pretty good, and so did being rubbed against a cock just a little bit bigger then him for the most part, but he did
Dean and Cas walked into the kitchen with their heads down low, heading for the coffee machine first. Sam was already there reading a newspaper, smiling far too brightly when he saw the pair enter. “Hey guys, how'd you sleep?” He asked with a knowing expression, taking a sip of his coffee.
“S-Sorry, I didn’t mean to—I just wanted to show you that I felt, that I feel the same way.” Cas said once he pulled away, a little shyly. Dean chuckled in what could only appear to be shock and scepticism. “You have feelings for me? Then, why the hell did you never say anything?” He asked. Cas made a snort of derision, replying, “Why didn’t
Dean nodded a little sympathetically. It had been freaking great, but not exactly meaningful. It wasn’t loving, more rushed and heated. He had wanted Cas' first time to be more special.
“Yes. Do you?”
Cas sat back after his turn taking the shots, giggling a little and smiling triumphantly. He was two beers and 10 shots in and was already wasted. Sam had been taking it slow and Dean was trying his hardest to catch up to Cas' level of drunkenness. He needed much more with his high tolerance, but he had started feeling it after a while. They'd played a few normal games and a few drinking games, and now they were at the point where they were nicely tipsy.
Dean bit his lip as he settled back and dropped his hand and the toy down to his waiting cock, wrapping his fist around it lightly and gladly pressing the tiny angel against the hard surface. He started jerking lazily, enjoying the slick feeling and the sight of his best friend being rubbed up against his member. Castiel still couldn't move or fight it, of course. He could only moan and curse in his head as he was pressed against the huge, hot, pulsing thing. Brought right up to the head and back down again over and over. Occasionally Dean's hand would grip tighter and move faster, moaning loudly far above him, none the wiser of what he was putting the angel through. He was sometimes gripped so tight it hurt, but at the same time the feeling of that giant cock rubbing up and down him felt great. His own dick was being pressed and rubbed pleasantly, and he would sometimes feel a vein pass over him and throb madly. A few times he was stopped just below the head and rubbed in tight circles over one of those veins, pulsing relentlessly against his chest.
“Good. He’s had a long day. I never did get him down for another nap.”
The months flew by, so did a heat and a negative pregnancy test. It was the 4th of July and I was pulling Mary's hair into a ponytail, when Dean came into the room. "Dad asked if we could stop at the store and pick up more buns and mustard." Dean said reading the text off his phone. "Yeah, that's fine." I said quietly, "go get your towel from mama and daddy's bathroom and I'll put it with your swim suit sweetie." I told Mary once I got her hair pulled back. "Cas what's wrong?" Dean asked, "I don't know… The last test was negative. What if I was only meant to have Mary and Mary only?" I said quietly not looking at Dean.
“Yes, just be careful.”
Taking a deep breath, Dean continued. “I walked into the house… Went up the stairs… And… You were in the shower. With her.”
“I’ll be down in a minute.”
"You hungry?" Dean asked and unbuttoned his shirt a little and brought Henry up a little and he latched on immediately. "I'll take that as a yes." Dean chuckled and ran a free hand gently through Henry's hair.
"You have a Christmas present waiting." Mary said and walked towards the kitchen. "Mom, it's Christmas Eve, there are lots of presents waiting." Dean whined but they followed her. "Hush and follow me." She said and opened the door to the basement; "okay, Cas sweetie take my hand and Dean take Cas' and close your eyes." Mary smiled a little and they just stared at her confused but closed their eyes and allowed Mary to lead them further into the basement.
Cas’ knot went down a few minutes later and Dean looked down at his shirt. “I should probably change…”
"Hello Claire." I said and tickled her neck causing her to squeal and giggle. "Dean, come to the living room please!" I hollered towards the kitchen. When Dean walked in with half a cookie stuffed into his mouth I rolled my eyes. "Really Dean. A cookie?" "Wha?" Dean asked with his mouth full and shoved the rest of the cookie in his mouth. "Anyway, Dean, this is my twin, Jimmy and his wife, Amelia." I said gesturing to the two. "Holy shit! He's definitely your twin Cas!" Dean said staring at Jimmy and he laughed, "um hi." Dean said a little quieter and shook his hand and Amelia gave him a hug surprising Dean a little. "How are you feeling?" Amelia asked "uh, better… Still a little sore in some places, arm is a bitch though." Dean said lifting the casted arm.
“We go on a date, perhaps? That’s what people do when they...have feelings for one another, right?”
12 hours ago
"Wait, what? No!" Dean exclaimed, looking between Gabriel and Cas. His objections were ignored though as Castiel gave the archangel a slow nod. "...Alright."
“Just let go, come for me.” Dean said, giving their cocks a squeeze. Castiel gasped, needed no more encouragement to do just that. He threw his head back, shivering all over as he came between them, soon feeling Dean do the same.
Dean gave his ass a small clench, taking a sip of his coffee. Gabriel smirked, having heard Cas' desperate, angry prayers throughout the whole ordeal last night.
“Alright. I’ll be back in a bit, okay?” Sam said gently, giving him a tiny smile of reassurance before he left, leaving him alone with Cas. There was a second of awkwardness between them as the angel didn’t know what to do, eyes landing on the bathroom. “Would you like me to run a bath? I’m sure you’d like to get all those...bodily fluids off yourself.” He suggested, catching the way Dean self consciously pulled the trenchcoat further around himself. “Sure, yeah. That-That sounds good. Don’t expect me to let you wash me, though.” He replied playfully to cover the awkwardness, smiling a little at the small tug it gave Cas' lips. “Your loss, you’ll be missing out.” He replied as he headed into the bathroom to run the water. It eased Dean's tension slightly and he waited quietly, looking up at the angel when he came back in. “Dean...can I ask you something?” He asked after a moment. “Sure. Shoot.” Dean replied. "At the house, why were you wearing such...revealing shorts?” Dean blushed at the question, wishing Cas hadn’t seen that. Stupid photos. “It was the only thing I could find to wear.” He complained, scowling at the smirk Cas gave him. “Well, they suited you.” He said as he went back to check on the water. Dean blushed harder, standing up to try and stretch his legs. Cas made it sound sarcastic, but it
Cas was wondering past Dean's room when he found himself stopping, gently pushing open the already ajar door to check on the sleeping hunter. He was sleeping peacefully, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself from going in anyway. To really make sure he was sleeping well. Dean was beautiful when he slept, clutching lightly at the blanket as he snored lightly. Castiel sat carefully on the edge of the bed beside him, watching over him a while.
Cas was held there for about five seconds before being pulled out again, getting down to his shoulders before he was shoved in again faster this time. He was pushed and pulled for a while after that, the moans getting louder as well as the heartbeat that reverberated though him. Dean was rhythmically clenching and unclenching his ass around Cas, the walls gripping him tighter and tighter almost as if they were trying to squeeze the life out of him as he was thrust in and out at lightning speed. It was relentless, but his body was still reacting to the stimulus and getting him incredibly hard. He couldn't stop himself from coming, his body shivering all over. Dean was also getting close to the edge, jerking himself off as he thrust Cas in and out his ass. When the hunter came his muscles gripped down tighter then they had before, and Cas could only wait for the crushing pressure to subside as he heard his own name being moaned at a boomingly high level. He was shoved in as far as he would go, unmoving as Dean came over and over again, working though the last spasms blissfully before it was over and the tight grip turned to occasional twitches. That was
“Anyway, I should leave you to it.” He added gently, finding himself gravitating closer to Dean before he left. The elder hunter nodded a little, hiding the slight disappointment in his expression and smiling instead. “I'll see you in the morning, then.”
The next time he woke up he was sat in what seemed like an operating chair, his wrists and ankles tied with straps and his legs spread. He was once again naked, exposed in a far worst position then before. A clinical looking light hung from above illuminating the room, a table off to the side containing some of the tools he’d seen before. He heard footsteps behind him and whipped his head around, clenching his jaw as his kidnapper walked around. “Ah, you’re awake! Good, good.” The guy exclaimed with a sinister sounding cheerfulness in his voice. He wasn’t half bad looking for a psycho. Short, slightly curly dark hair, a strong jawline, dark blue eyes, a slim but strong body. He was wearing jeans and a plain red shirt, not exactly a criminal mastermind looking type. Dean tightened his jaw as he observed the guy. “So, what are you, huh? A demon?” Dean asked with a scowl, testing how tight the straps were on his wrists. The guy smiled at the question, wondering over to the table to play with a knife. “Me? Oh, no, I’m human. I was possessed, though. For four years. Do you know what that’s like? To not have control of your body for so long? To watch, and feel, the kind of things your own hands are doing to others?” He asked with an unhingedness that sent a shiver down Dean's spine. He didn’t answer, which was just as well since the guy kept talking anyway. “It's hell. That thing used me for years, taunted me, made me do things I never thought I’d do.” He walked over to the hunter, waving the knife around as he spoke. It didn’t faze Dean, he kept up the stoic expression despite the fact that a crazy person was wielding a sharp object in close proximity to his exposed body. His genitals being the most vulnerable.
Cas prayed desperately, feeling the ridges of Dean's giant fingertip move over his pecs and nipples, feeling out his abs and hips before pressing lightly on his tiny cock and balls. He couldn't help the shiver and tingles that ran through his entire body, reacting to the stimuli against his will. He'd dreamed of Dean touching him sexually loads of times, but not like this when the hunter didn't even realize he was touching the real Cas. His cock hardened and raised up, causing Dean to tilt his head curiously. "You like that, huh? I wonder if the real Cas would like this. Guess I'll have to make do with you." He muttered to himself, gently holding the tiny cock between his finger and thumb to rub and pull on. It stiffened more, raising up to Castiel's stomach as it filled with blood and started leaking precome. If the tiny angel could moan he would, Dean's giant fingers were all encompassing, every touch was electric.
“Pshh, easy. I have an amazing singing voice.” Dean replied confidently, waiting until he heard ‘Shake It Off' by Taylor Swift Start playing. He shrugged a little, owning it completely. It got some chuckles out of Sam and Cas, but he stuck with it until the end.
“Hey, you look awesome like that.” He defended.
Cas smiled at the proposal. “I-I'd like that. Thank you.” Of course, he did hope for steamy nights as well as the slow love making. He wanted to experience everything with Dean. He didn’t realize how much he'd been missing all his life.

He begged, dreading how long his friend was going to keep him in there.
The small angel moaned in his head, shivering hard as he was slicked up. He was then shoved head first into Dean's mouth, whimpering internally. Everything was hot and damp as the tongue played with him, rubbing up against his body and face as he felt Dean's teeth press down teasingly. A huge moan reverberated through his whole body, a hundred times louder then it would normally be to his tiny ears. Only his legs were out, being held tightly in the giant's fist. It was scary, but he was way more aroused to care. It did feel amazing, like his whole body was getting a blowjob. He was a tiny bit disappointed when he was released, only to be brought down to something new.
“Wh--it's called BDSM, and yes. ‘S just for a bit more fun, right?”
Sam smiled and nodded, pouring five out as Dean made a small sound of discontent. “Nice try, bud. Next time though, give ‘im somethin' harder.”
“Ha, nailed it. Cas, truth or dare?” Dean asked afterwards, taking another shot.
the best damn orgasm Dean had ever had. He relaxed back in bed and let go of his softening cock, sighing happily as he gave his ass another small squeeze.
Over the course of the night, though, Cas started having some pretty hot dreams after their day of fun, managing to get hard once more. He unconsciously gripped his hand down on Dean and lowered him down his body, wrapping him around his cock again. The movement understandably woke Dean up and he called up to the angel when he realized what was happening, but it was in vain as the giant squeezed him tightly around that hot, pulsing cock once more. He was dragged up slowly, before being squeezed tighter and lowered back to the base a couple times. No amount of screaming helped, Cas was soon completely hard and moaning lightly in his sleep. Dean was dragged for what felt like an eternity before Cas was finally done with him, rubbing hard and tight until he came and was satisfied enough to let go and roll onto his stomach. Dean, though, stuck to his dick with the sticky substance, ending up being smothered between the giant member and the soft mattress. He tried to wiggle his way out but that just made Cas grind down on him, his thick cock knocking the breath out of Dean. The tiny hunter gave up and eventually just laid there to try and to get some more sleep before morning.
Dean found a random Disney movie and continued to share his dinner with Henry until it was gone. Cas took Dean’s plate and took it downstairs for him.
Dean replied almost instantly not caring if it seemed like a teenaged girl thing to do,
"Who would have thought I would enjoy baths this much?" Dean chuckled and I smirked and relaxed into him while Dean traced lazy patterns on my stomach. We got out once the water started turning cold and I dried off and put on some pajama bottoms and crawled into the bed onto my stomach and I felt Dean crawl up over me and started kissing the back of me neck. "Whatcha say Cas? Mary's with Charlie tonight and we haven't had 'grown up' time since your last heat." Dean whispered running his hands up and down my back. "Not tonight Dean, I'm tired and just want to sleep. I have to be at the bakery in the morning." I said and Dean's hands stilled.
if he does something stupid like that again I'll beat him… Wait, what's that smell?" Charlie said sniffing the air then leaned forward and smelled me, "oh my god, you two had sex?! What is it with you guys?" Charlie wrinkled her nose but I could see a small smile forming on her face. "Charlie? What are you doing here anyway?" I asked moving towards the living room to sit, "I was coming over to see how you were doing because of what happened and obviously to kick his ass. And I guess when I saw the Impala something snapped."
Luckily enough, Charlie listened just this one time, "I'm going to take a nap, because those hospital beds are the most uncomfortable places to sleep." Dean yawned, "lay with me?" he asked "of course." Cas smiled and followed Dean into the bedroom. Cas shucked off his jeans and crawled under the covers, as soon as Dean got comfortable, snuggled up to Cas' side, there was a solid kick to his side. "Ugh, you have the worst timing." Dean groaned, "what?" Cas asked confused, "the pup is moving and I can never sleep when he does." Dean sighed and jumped a little when he felt Cas press his palm to the side of his stomach and start rubbing. "This help?" Cas whispered, "hmm, a little." Dean mumbled and eventually passed out.
“You smell like smoke.” Dean mumbled against Cas’ chest.
“Come on, it’s not a lot, I think it’ll just make your eyes pop even more.” Charlie explained. “Let me put it on and if you hate it I’ll take it off.”
By time the bell rang at the end of the hour Cas was a nervous wreck. He didn't know why he was so nervous, he just had an uneasy feeling sitting in the pit of his stomach. Cas waited for everyone to leave before he went up to Bobby's desk. He looked up at Cas, "sorry, son… But Dean's not gonna make that date of yours tonight." Bobby said looking sad "what? w-why?" Cas asked sitting back down, "that kid Alistair jumped him this morning, I had to take him to the hospital…" Bobby said, "what?! Oh my god. Is, is he okay?" "He'll be fine, he has a black eye and plenty of bruises, but he felt horrible about canceling you date, so Mary, his mother said you can go over after school." Bobby said, "okay, thank you Bobby." Cas said and Bobby just nodded.
Back at school Cas felt all giddy inside for his date tonight with Dean. So, by time Algebra II rolled around Cas was more than excited to talk to him, but when he got in the room Dean was no where to be found. 'He's probably just late to class…' Cas thought to himself, he just sat there waiting for Dean to walk through the door. He overheard a few people talking behind him, "yeah, I heard that one of the teachers had to take him to the hospital…" one girl said, "yeah, but they were an omega right? Does it really matter?" a guy said and Cas suddenly became very angry and slightly worried, how could that jack ass talk about an omega like they're a pice of trash?
We got home and I put Mary in the living room and turned on cartoons. "Mama?" "Yes Mary?" I called from the kitchen "Juice?" she asked coming into the kitchen as I was putting the pie on the counter. "What do you say?" I asked already pulling out her sippy cup. "Please mama." Mary said trying to mimik Sam's puppy eyes. "Good girl." I said and handed her some apple juice, "want me to put in 'Frozen' while we wait for daddy?" I asked pulling a bottle of water out of the fridge. "YA!" Mary screamed and ran to the living room stepping on Squirt's tail causing him to run and hide under the table.
Cas found his phone tangled up in his sheets and quickly found Dean's number and hit the call button. It rang a few times before he answered,
"He won't stop." Dean whimpered, Cas knew he was talking about the voice so he made it so Dean was sitting in his lap with Dean's nose against his neck, he started carding his fingers through his hair and hummed 'Hey Jude'. "It'll be okay baby I promise." he whispered and went back to humming.
“I’m sorry.” she whispered.
Both boys laid there in each others arms once Cas was able to pull out, they just laid there in comfortable silence when they heard Henry start to whimper, "there's our cue." Cas chuckled. They pulled their boxers on and Dean went to get Henry. "Cas, bring me a shirt and some sweats please." Dean called out through the baby monitor.
Once the two go their food, Dean started looking for Charlie and Benny. He found them in the back by a window, "follow me Cas." Dean said and made his way over, "hey red, Benny." Dean greeted and sat down, "guy's this is Cas, Cas the red head is Charlie and the scary looking one is Benny." Dean introduced, "wow, you're like really hot." Charlie blurted out and Dean stiffened, "um th-thank you?" Cas said shocked by the sudden complement, "but don't get any ideas big boy, I don't swing for your team." Charlie said and winked.
“Hi sweetie, what’s up?” Mary asked.
“Come on Sammy. You’re never this sour.” Sam stayed silent.
“That sounds wonderful to me Dean. I don’t care as long as you’re mine in every way possible…” Cas said pulling Dean close to him. “That sounded creepy I’m sorry.”
"Oh gross. Look we all know you're having a baby but for the love of god, I do
He frantically looked for Cas and Henry’s teacher. He found one of the preschool teachers and ran up to them but the closer he got he realized he didn’t see Henry. “Where’s Henry?!” he asked.
An hour later Mary and I were downstairs munching on milk and cookies when a sleepy Dean made his way into the kitchen. "Well look at sleeping beauty." I teased and Dean flipped me the bird. "How ya feeling?" I asked him while I put a few cookies and a glass of milk down. "Eh, arm hurts a little and my head, but I'll live." "Here, take this." I said and handed Dean on of his pain pills.
