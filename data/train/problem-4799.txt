instead of mulling over things which can’t possibly be fixed by words said on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere during a single evening – they end up making their way into their bedroom still debating over politics, the president and Fury’s plan, eventually falling asleep almost at the same time, Tony’s head on Steve’s chest, his fingers deep into the other’s brown hair.
“Give me a dance, would you? Just one. And then I promise I’ll leave you alone, if that’s what you want.”
“Can you teach me how to date?” Steve eventually spits it out, his voice higher than usual, thus betraying the nervousness inside of him.
He makes a pause, mostly to catch his breath – he seems to have talked until there was no air left in his lungs – and Tony nods encouragingly, still not knowing where this is going but figuring he should have bought Steve a gift too, if only he hadn’t been so damn busy.
“You didn’t shave…” he sighs, grabbing Tony’s arm and blocking him halfway while he’s about to put his foot down the first step.
They’ve all but walking across the hangar – once again, Tony losing himself in such a sight – when a young woman in uniform approach them, salutes Steve – who, he could swear, holds back an annoyed sigh – and welcomes him back to the base. Tony blinks, not because he’s being
“Yeah, but you wouldn’t have kissed me if we had, you seemed on the verge of throwing up.” Steve remarks as finally calming down; he takes a couple more bites to finish his wrap and walks to the bin to throw away the paper.
Yes, Tony knows, and wants to say that it is impossible to forget that when he has a perfect example of it right in front of his own eyes in this moment, but decides to keep it from himself for fear of sounding shallower than he intends to. Steve is handsome, of course, but that’s not what he’s thinking about. His
Tony cocks a brow at that: “But Eyepatch there called you ‘Cap’, which I take is short for ‘Captain’…”
As he wonders what the hell is going on between the two of them – and whether he actually wants it to
Fighting against every fiber in his body and groaning in pain, Tony forces himself to open his eyes again, and slaps his face as hard as he can in order to get his sight to come into focus. What he sees confirms what he already knew – although he was refusing to believe it – and sends the chilliest shiver down his spine. It’s not just that Steve is being held at point gun – he’s been serving for the last few of years, since they finished college, and Tony has made his peace with the fact that his lover is somewhat
, he ponders as he starts inspecting both front and back doors, the first step of a fairly long list to tick off before the bank actually opens at 9.
Steve looks down at his mouth, sighing softly while pondering that question over, but eventually he has to shake his head in defeat: “Jokes aside, I do think we ought to be careful, Tony. I don’t know how much… caught up you are with the domestic situation but it’s not looking too good.”
. The team is already worried about him as it is – has been for over a year now, although it’s gone by in the blink of an eye, seasons changing without him realizing it, his senses and his perception of time completely dulled out by the pain,
“Take your fucking hand away!” he screams, turning so fast that Mark barely realizes the five fingers that hit his cheek, loud and hard. For a second they just stare at each other, both in disbelief, then to prevent anything worse from happening Steve shakes his head and mumbles an apology before rushing out of the room first and the hotel just a minute later.
. Fingers tapping restlessly on the table, eyes fixed on the small blue circle that keeps rotating in the middle of the screen, he can’t help the hundreds of doubts which are now flooding him. What if he made a mistake in his calculations? What if his suppositions were wrong? Or his plan had flaws he had simply been too
It’s not that nobody is allowed in his greenhouse except for him – he has indeed invited the others to see it, and they have all popped in from time to time, either to chat with him or to check on its progress – it’s that Tony’s is the last voice he was expecting to hear.
“Let’s go sit down, c’mon.” he replies, pecking his lips again before eventually taking the beer off his hand, unscrewing the cap and taking a long sip as heading towards the living room. They take their seats on the couch next to each other and without further ado he summarizes Nick’s plan to Steve, painfully watching his expression changing from interested to confused to plain hurt by the end of his recap, and again Tony has to fight against the urge to say,
it must be to basically lose consciousness and wake up seventy years later, without any awareness of the time that has passed while you were out of it. He struggles to imagine what it’d be like if that had happened to him. He thinks he’d be able to adjust, with time, although he’d probably be even more of a loner than he already is. Find it even harder to make friends, someone to trust. He throws a furtive glance to Tony, as if he was afraid to be spotted. Based on the short conversation that they’ve had, and then the even briefer one with Fury, Steve doesn’t believe the same could apply to the guy next to him. Just based on a first impression, Tony seems the kind of person who finds it extremely
“Yeah, well, that’s why I chose to go with it. Edward is my middle name. And what about you, Mr. … ‘Grant’?”
“Steve? Steve, wake up…” he whispers, and his voice sounds weird and way too low for his liking, making him realize just how
“Strongest cocktail you can,” he replies, slipping a hand into his back pocket to get ahold of his wallet. But before he can grab it, an arm gently hugs his waist, making his eyes widen with surprise and mixed feelings surge into his stomach. It’s rejection and guilt and sickness, but also need for intimacy and release and an anger he’s never actually dealt with.
“Yeah, just being prudent, y’know?” he nods before smiling at Steve, and for a moment he feels nervous again as when he saw him on the rooftop yesterday, every thought about politics and the government disappeared from his mind. He wants to kiss him, because he wants to feel safe again and happy and at peace with the world as he had before knowing what was going on, but he has no idea how Steve would react to a sudden burst of affection and he doesn’t want to start with the wrong foot, if that’s an expression you can still use after everything they’ve already gone through.
that he has to resist the impulse to scratch his whole body in an attempt to get rid of his own skin. He stretches his hand towards the dashboard and picks up the pager, starting to type a message when he realizes that just is not going to cut it, not with the way he’s feeling right now.
“I mis—“ Steve starts, but before he can say more the loudest bang announces the explosion that blows all of the tents away, and throws both of them against hard rocks. If Tony wasn’t a genius and hadn’t figured out nanotechnology in just a couple of weeks, he would have been lying down senseless right now, struggling for his life. But as it happens, in the couple of seconds that pass between the explosion and his body hitting ground again, his latest suit engulfs his whole body, protecting all his vital organs. The hit he takes still hurts as hell, but at least there’s no significant damage.
this so badly that he’s beyond caring about the consequences. If he dies, so be it. Chances are nobody would ever know for sure anyway, and pretty soon people would just assume that he took off indefinitely. Would anyone remember him? Yeah, sure, for like a few years maybe. But give it a decade and nobody would lose a minute of sleep over his name. ‘Stark? Oh, yeah, I knew him once, giant pain in the ass, huge ego, did a tons of mistakes, nearly destroyed the planet more times that he saved it, it’s a tight race. He never knew when to stop. He probably killed himself or became a monk or something.’ He can see a conversation like that happening all too clearly.
The soft snicker Fury comments his statement with makes him feel stupid, but now Steve realizes that he probably deserves it. And all of a sudden, a sequence of events spanning his whole life begins to form into his mind, pushing him to question
As long as explanations go, it sounds quite credible, so he doesn’t protest any further even if he’s not sold. Instead he grabs what looks like a pint of beer and gently clinks his friends’ glasses before swallowing half of the alcohol in one go. What’s the point in savoring your drink when it’s not going to change the effect it has on you? Still, as the beer makes its way into his stomach, he has to admit feeling a bit funny, although he can’t really elaborate on that.
“So, um, where are you going with this, Rogers? I’ve got a few parties waiting for me in Manhattan…” he pretends to be serious, knowing that the other is aware of his game anyway, but that doesn’t make it any less fun to play.
“Relax, it’s just me.” replies a familiar voice, and although he instinctively relaxes and a part of him is glad to hear a friendly sound, he can’t help but wishing he wasn’t there.
“Shit. Okay then, you’re coming with me,” Mr. Field says, his voice dripping with desperation, and just as Tony wonders who the
“Yeah, well… Someone had to do it, right?” he shrugs as to say that’s not a big deal, but Rhodey knows him too well to just believe that.
“Oh, I think I’m in love...” he replies, and for once his words couldn’t be more appropriate because the statement is nothing short of reciprocated by all of the others, and Tony can’t help but feeling somewhat proud of him, because Steve Rogers delivering a fully successful line in this kind of environment is not something that many have had the privilege to witness.
Tony groans in embarrassment, letting himself go against the chair and wanting to disappear again, only this time because he doesn’t think he has it in him to show his face anywhere else now that he’s positive others actually know about them. Not because he’s ashamed or anything like that, it’s more that the whole ‘Civil War’ mess sounds ever worse now. Superheroes against superheroes over a political, moral, ideological issue? You can get behind that, if not in practice, in theory at least. But if you know that the head of both factions were lovers? That makes it looks like the modern version of
“Who the hell are you talking to?” comes a familiar voice, and he blinks because it can’t be, can it? His mind must be playing tricks on him for sure. He turns around and of course, the voice wasn’t in his head, it is
of these. He’s just a man in a suit, and perhaps that’s why his mind has been spiraling down this past decade or so: he’s been meddling with situations beyond human comprehension, and that’s bound to have an effect on you in the long run.
at him to stop – he can’t help but leaning in for yet another kiss, less chaste this time, tongue slipping inside Steve’s mouth to caress his, gently yet hungrily. He parts only once he’s completely out of breath, taking a step back as to remind the other that he doesn’t have the same super soldier stamina, and it’s only now that realizes what Steve has been holding for all this time above their heads: a mistletoe.
“Look, I know it might not look like it, but I’m actually Tony Stark, I’m technically your boss, so…”
what he’s supposed to do with his life. Using everything in his power to try and better the lives of many? Or maybe he’s just getting ahead of himself and is just a pretentious jerk. Jury hasn’t reached a verdict yet.
. Oh, his father would have been furious about it, he has no doubts about this, and would even bet the old man did anything in his power to stop it. But who could have thought of such a thing? It doesn’t take him long to realize that was probably Pepper, or maybe Jim or Happy. Or maybe all three of them. And suddenly, like a big wave you don’t see coming, he get

So, except for Stephen (who looks slightly annoyed and/or bored almost every single time he gets in touch with him), the only person he hears from constantly is Pepper, who, by the way, still knows

And away he gently pushes Steve’s arms off his shoulders, picking up his pace to catch up with the rest of the team as they make their way through the icy snow.

if Pepper hadn’t sent him a present, which of course he got notified about just because the courier couldn’t leave it outside his Manhattan apartment (he hasn’t set foot in it ever since he got summoned in Washington) – and on New Year’s Eve he actually falls asleep on the sofa at 6:30pm after a long day tied up to a polygraph machine in a remote military base somewhere in Virginia. He’s so exhausted all the time that he only realizes a new year has indeed started when he puts the wrong date on an official document, writing 2020 instead of 2021, and although he chuckles it off with the aid, he knows he can’t possibly go on like this – which in itself is quite indicative of his wellbeing, as normally those kinds of thoughts are as foreign to his mind as possible.
“Hey, you can’t just do t—“ the doctor protests, looking at him as if he was insane. Which he probably is, right now.
“You go first…” Tony encourages him, not wanting to put a dark twist to the evening – it’d be really unnecessary and uncalled for, and it would probably prompt all kinds of questions from Steve, ones he doesn’t have the answers for, although he surely wishes he did.
“Kept waiting on an invitation, but it never came. Told myself not to take it personally, but well... hard to do when you’ve invited even Hank’s ants over and not me...”
, he tells himself – mostly because he keeps a list of reasons in support of his statement – he just… feels okay as long as he keeps certain thoughts out of his mind. It takes a few, long weeks but eventually a global compromise is reached to reintegrate the finances and belongings of the snapped population back in place, and although extremely slowly, things go back to normal. Sam gets his apartment in D.C. back, and insists Steve moves in with Bucky and him. He doesn’t want to – he’s happy as he can be about his two best friends, however being around them all the time hits too close to
, his body reclaiming attention, acting as if it had its own mind. And so he finds himself not only reciprocating the kiss, but holding Mark closer, almost possessively, although he doesn’t understand
“Oh for godssake…” he sighs, taking both the glasses and the hat off. Still, it takes Peter a couple more seconds to recognize him.
Steve, who had been taking a sip of tea during the break of silence, can’t hold the liquid in his mouth as hearing those words and ends up spitting a bit out: “I’m sorry, what did you just say?”
“Hey, it’s Friday, hopefully evil guys will want to just stay home and have a drink instead.” he chimes in, and now his arm is resting on the head of Steve’s chair, in what he hopes to be a soothing gesture. “Anyway. This is a double date, ladies, let’s try and keep our work out of it, shall we? From this moment on, we’re just four regular people enjoying each other’s company and food, wishing to get laid later on.”
“Like that’s gonna help you…” giggles Steve, letting him go and stretching once alone on the bed. Tony shows him the finger and jumps off the bed, heading to the bathroom to do his business and wash his face, picking up some freezing water from the ice bucket and wetting parts of his body with it, figuring the coldness would chase some of the tiredness away. Before returning to bed, he stops by the minibar and takes out an energy drink, emptying half the can in one go.
avoiding the other’s eyes, he can’t help but notice how the only seat available is right next to him.
The pilot’s voice sounds so remote to his ears that for a moment he doesn’t understand where it’s coming from; he gives a little pat on her shoulder as a thank you, then steps out of the helicopter and follows the agent greeting him inside, where they’re joined by the hospital’s head physician.
He takes a deep breath, passing a hand all over his face as if he was scrubbing dirt off it, then nods: “Yeah, I… god I don’t know how to start this… okay… uh… Look.” Tony sighs again, looks down as if he had prepared a speech and only needed to read it again real quickly – which, by the way, he hasn’t done. “I’ve been thinking. I can’t… give up Iron Man. I mean, of course I
He doesn’t know where these words have come from, and judging from the expression on Tony’s face, he’s not the only one.
He could swear he doesn’t hear Nat’s voice calling his name, but it must have happened all the same because his brain registers it, albeit extremely slowly. He snuffles and rubs the tears away from his face, blowing his nose before tentatively standing up, his legs shaking and not just because of the cold.
“Fear not, Hank Pym, for I am already aware of the situation, as my brother Loki is responsible for the theft. Together we shall bring him to justice!”
“What’s… ‘here’, exactly?” he asks, even if it’s a stupid question that gets treated as such, because he receives no answer. Sam and Bucky just get out of the car instead, and his oldest friend opens the door for him. Steve gives him a look between exasperated and resigned.
, because now that the reality of the situation is hitting him, he can feel his mind quickly slipping away, letting his body being in command for once. So just as he’s about to come he places a hand on top of Mark’s head, pushing himself out of his mouth and throwing a quick glance down.
Steve is about to reply, but Tony precedes him, looking down and talking as if he was answering a simple question in physics class back in high school: “Energy can’t be destroyed or created, it can only be transformed…”
“I don’t know how to let you go…” Steve’s words are a feeble whisper almost so unintelligible to his ears that he can’t be sure if he actually said them or if it was his imagination instead; he forces himself to open his eyes, and surely enough he finds the blue ones looking straight into his, fragile and unguarded. He wants to reply something back – anything would do at this point – but before he can his body decides that enough is enough and takes over the wheel, prompting him to grab Steve’s t-shirt to pull him even closer, starting to kiss his lips slowly but hungrily at the same time before sliding his tongue inside his mouth to find his, caressing it gently to extort a muffled moan out of him as his hands are already reaching under his tee to touch his skin, finding it so warm and knowing for a fact his own would be just the same. Steve closes his eyes at his touch and lowers his own hands on the other’s bottom, touching it gently and softly over his trousers, and this time it’s Tony who can’t keep a moan from escaping his lips, warning his brain – or whatever there’s left of it – that there’s no going back at this point, not anymore, but he already knows this and he wishes he can stop, but he just
– and when they didn’t… well, Tony rarely shut up, except maybe for when he was between his thighs, and in that case it was his muffled moans to fill the air.
The conversation naturally switches to their usual topics – whether they should update the team’s rooster and with whom, who is Clint dating, how long until the X-Men bring another disaster to their doorstep – and for a while they forget they’re on a pretend-date, at least until the bill gets left on the table for anyone to grab. Tony doesn’t flinch, waiting to see what his dining partner will do, and despite stretching a hand to grab it, Steve actually stops halfway through to look at him, biting his lip as withdrawing his fingers.
, he asks in his dream, more out of habit because he’s used to have him on his private comms, his voice always providing a safety net no matter how weird the situation they were stuck in was.
Tony wonders, but he knows deep down that this is obviously his own job, and one of the reason why they work so well together. Tony is the one who makes Steve stop being a soldier for the time being, because if something does happen when they’re in the same room, he wouldn’t have to make apologies and feel bad for having to leave. Because of this knowledge, Steve can relax when Tony is around. He likes to think that he’s the only one who can do that.
Although neither of them never says the words out loud, they both know two things for certain: a) this is the only day they’re going to get together, possibly for a long while, and b) it’s not over until the morning light comes through the curtains, although it would be more prudent to leave in the dead of the night, when darkness makes it harder for someone to follow you. So, even if they had actually agreed for Tony to go soon after midnight, once the moment arrives they find themselves staring into each other’s eyes, both trying to find the right words to say out loud without sounding so damn
about Fury’s plan (although in more than one occasion he has come very close to just blurt it all out to her).
Tony sniggers softly, a small smile on his lips as he follows the invitation, letting himself go in the most classic of trusting exercises, sure that his body will be met by the other’s. Which of course it does. Steve’s muscly arms wrap instantly around his shoulders, giving him that sense of safety and comfort that he had been craving so much in the last few months. He closes his eyes, stretching a hand behind to meet Steve’s neck, caressing it listlessly and staying silent, allowing himself to find some peace in the stillness of the moment.
The awkward moment seems to be averted, because there’s a general nod and the sound of chopsticks getting separated one from the other. He can already feel the magic combination of rice and fish melting together in his mouth while his thumb and index fingers are about to close on a nigiri, but before they can, he becomes painfully aware of a new subtle atmosphere of suspension around the table.
that we get the ring somewhere safe, and to do that, I need to get it out of the suit. It will only unlock with my fingerprint, so…”
“And I thought you had taken all of my advices…” he sucks in a deep breath, shaking his head, hands on hips for dramatic effect, once again trying to guess the correct course of action.
He is okay though, just in dire need of rest. They know the fight is far from over, but they figure they have gained a bit of time, and that hopefully will be enough. Tony burns through the steps of his recovery, and in just over a week he’s back to his usual self. After hearing about how he sent Loki on his way, Fury offers him free usage of one of the top notch SHIELD labs in the States, which Tony eagerly accepts, feeling again as that kid in the old Ronald Dahl book when he wins the chocolate factory. The place is just a couple of subway stops away from Steve’s apartment, which the blonde offers up to him on the day he’s given the okay to leave the hospital.
“For some reason I think there’s more to the story…” his friend replies, trying to meet his eyes although they keep escaping his, moving swiftly around the room.
“Tony, are you okay?” Steve asks from the opposite side of the room, the first time he’s actually said anything since walking in, and Tony is surprised to realize that he had almost forgotten what it sounded like. It also has the effect of making him refocus on what was one of the goals of this meeting, which was definitely not to have a shouting match with Fury.
Steve is about to say something but gets beaten to it by Janet, although the remark isn’t exactly the kind he had in mind.
With their drink and food orders out of the way, Tony decides it’s time to test the level of the conversation game Steve would bring to the table while on a date, so he asks him to start talking about the first random thing that pops into his mind. The other takes a few moments to think it over – Tony stops himself from rolling his eyes as he can’t believe Steve actually doesn’t have a reply ready – but when the other eventually does, he wishes he had been more patient.
The sun is on its way out when he finally achieves his goal. He’s lost track of time along the way, and tiredness hits him all at once so that he almost falls asleep in the shower. He decides to skip dinner and go straight to bed.
His voice leaves behind a funny silence, which quickly grows to be uncomfortable for him because Steve keeps mum for the longest time, leaving Tony wondering what the hell the other is thinking.
“Why did you stop?” Tony sighs, taking his hand away and looking at his companion, shaking his head in disapproval.
That’s the pattern today’s morning and early afternoon had subscribed to, and Steve had just sat down to look over some new intel when the red alarm had begun blasting in his office. He had waited the standard ninety seconds to see if it stopped, and when it hadn’t, he had quickly got up and headed downstairs to meet Tony and the rest. Ten minutes later they were flying towards the emergency.In half an hour, they were facing an alien resembling a giant larva who had decided that Atlantic City looked like the perfect spot to transform into his own ‘home away from home’, for lack of a better term. The tourists on the boardwalk were excited, snapping pictures and selfies with their phones. The guests inside the casinos weren’t paying any attention instead, and Steve could swear he had spotted a security guard telling off a driver for stopping her vehicle in front of the entrance. Of course, they had tried to come to a peaceful solution - they always did - but alas, that had led nowhere, probably because they couldn’t make themselves understood. Then the alien had mistaken Wasp for a real, exotic insect - one he had to try - and had dislodged an incredibly long tongue in her direction. Mjölnir had hit the slimy appendix when it was just a couple of inches away from Janet. Needless to say, the alien hadn’t taken that blow very well. He had started deploying what looked suspiciously like micro rockets in their directions, one of which had landed right on Steve’s shield. He thought he had blocked it, or at least deviated its course, but something had gone wrong somehow because just a second later everything went bright and scorching and before he could even articulate a single sound his eyes had rolled back and he had lost consciousness.
“Okay…” Steve nods, redness still spreading on his cheeks as Tony leans in for a goodbye kiss before disappearing out of the door.
“Steve fucking Rogers, ladies and gentlemen…” he moans out loud, hugging himself and staying there until tiredness finally conquers his body. This time, sleep doesn’t wait too long to catch up on him.
As the other man helps him to come up into a sitting position, his eyes regain their ability to focus. He forces a smile out, not knowing whether or not he’ll be successful.
“I was wondering whether you’d classify this as a ‘successful date’ or not…” Steve eventually blurts out, trying to keep the question somewhat casual by using a boring word and adding a little shrug.
“W-What’s happening…?” comes the mellow, sleep-infused reply, one that Tony can’t hear because his eyes are still shut even though he’s now sitting in a totally upright position.
“Hey, Tony…” he decides to call instead, and it’s a relief to hear it coming out decisively stronger than before, although still not to its normal standards. But he’ll take this small victory. “Tony,” he says again, slightly louder when the other doesn’t even flinch.
Tony turns to look at Steve as he spoke, his own heart aching when he hears the increased tone of terror in the other man’s voice. For once he doesn’t think, he just leans his hand on Steve’s shoulder, squeezing it gently hoping to transmit some reassurance of sorts.
Steve doesn’t know if he agrees with this statement – in his opinion it can easily be used by people with no moral ground to justify bad decisions – but finds himself smiling nevertheless, at the way Anthony has used his nickname. Maybe it’s because the other has told him about his adversity towards the Army, but on his mouth it sounded exactly how Steve himself likes to hear it being said. Just three simple letters with no deep meaning or connotation whatsoever, because he’s captain of
Steve, who had really enjoyed the peaceful half an hour preceding this moment, arches a brow in the other’s direction, having no idea what any of that could possibly mean.
“Do you want to walk home?” Steve asks him once they’re done with their dinner – yes, they split the bill as if this was an actual date, and what about it? – although is snowing and it’s cold and they’d be better off calling an Uber.
. Steve had been holding his breath since hearing Tony call his name, part of him expecting some sort of confession, part of him dreading a different kind of talk. He’s been in love before, of course he has, and yet this feels like nothing he’s ever experienced already, whatever
“Yeah, well, my job, it doesn’t come with days off, not at the moment I’m afraid,” he explains, a hand attempting to comb his hair while he looks for a piece of paper and something to write with. Once he finds both, he quickly scribbles his name and number on it and stretches it over to Grant, who is still looking at the whole scene with puzzled eyes. “Here. I wish I didn’t have to leave like this, but…”
He walks with quick steps, one hand buried deep inside the pocket of his jacket clenched in a fist, the other holding the flowers he picked up on his way here, just as he does every single morning. As always when he’s just a few feet away, he takes a deep breath, closes his eyes for ten seconds, and then walks the last five steps that separate him from the red and yellow statue. He brushes the snow off the picture before kissing it, lips almost freezing instantly at the contact with the glacial glass that contains it; he blinks to get rid of the burning feeling and it’s only now that he realizes his eyes are already wet.
But Steve puts his hand on his mouth to keep further words from coming out, staring into Tony’s eyes and shaking his head.
– probably just a reflex of his subconscious, still mostly asleep – before he forces himself to cut it out.
“You could go back with me…” Steve suggests, although he feels stupid doing it, sure that if it was a possibility the other would have already mentioned it.
” Steve’s voice again, less edgy and more controlled now, which soothes Tony, even if just a little, and prompts him to try his best to come to a sitting position, fighting against his own body, whose energy seems to be running out. It’s a very weird feeling that he actively despises.
“Thank you. I figured… we need a reminder there’s beauty in this world, especially in times like these, you know?”
‘I’ve gone ahead. See you there’ he scribbles on the whiteboard on the fridge, and then he’s on his way out.
. Found it in 1944 and was on my way back when a group of… mercenaries attacked me. I’ll save the story for another time but you need to understand. The rings? They’re
kiss you, there and then. The things you said… they hit me hard. But I didn’t know how to explain it out loud so I figured…”
Steve tries to smile, but it’s so tiny and fragile that Tony has to look away: “We are… a couple of i-idiots, you… you know that, right?”
“Had to see you.” he smiles harmlessly, and that’s enough for Tony to snap off his trance and leap towards the other, grabbing the collar of his t-shirt to pull Steve’s face to his lips, starting to kiss him with a hunger that he had no idea was residing within him. His rational side knows that this can’t be a social visit, that there’s something else, that Nick would have never ever agreed to tell him his location, but right now he couldn’t care less about any of that, all he wants are his kisses and feeling his body against his and smelling the perfume of his aftershave on himself, because it’s been too fucking long and it had been driving him insane. Tony’s hands are already slipping underneath his shirt, caressing his abs while his mouth goes on Steve’s neck, nibbling it slightly harder than his intentions were, but self-control has never been his forte, it’d be stupid to think he could have any now; he can feel his briefs and trousers growing tighter and the thought of that makes him moan on the other’s skin, and before he realizes his hands are trailing down to undo his belt as his head starts feeling even lighter, all of his thoughts disappearing from his mind because he just can’t think anymore, he has to explore and touch and…
“Well, it could be programmed to say a few standard sentences – after all it was built for the war – but if this is indeed the case, we’re talking about a level of technology which was years from being
,” he admits, about to give him another taste, but then he stops on his lips and frowns, tilting his head to fully look at the other: “You
. “Good,” the man replies, keeping his gun aimed at him but shifting his glance back to Jean, as does Tony, trying to ignore the voice inside his head to come up with some sort of a plan.
Both women’s eyes set on him for a response, but Steve has absolutely no idea what to reply, the only recurring thought in his head being,
“Okay…” Steve replies with a puzzled expression that tells him he still believes his behavior to be decisively odd. “Well, don’t just stay there, come…” he adds, feeling quite awkward himself now for some reasons he can’t quite point down. He walks past Tony and heads to the kitchen, grabbing a couple of beers and stretching one to him. “I got the impression you didn’t like my iced tea, so I bought a six pack the other day, kinda hoping you’d stop by again…” he gives him that shy half-smile of his, and the moment he sees it Tony thinks,
The being interrupts Steve before he can finish his sentence, and for the second time its voice sounds very human in its vexed accent: “You’re not familiar with the Laws of the universe, I
“There’s a sofa bed in the living room, very comfy, it’s gonna be good,” he says, maybe a bit over enthusiastically, just as Tony is finishing lacing up his shoes. It really doesn’t take a lot of convincing – Tony knows he’s probably going to inherit the family fortune at some point, but that’s going to take a lot of time and patience, so for the time being he has
“Which part of ‘your ten minutes are up’ didn’t get through that big brain of yours, exactly?” the guard’s voice interrupts his offer, and Steve finds himself chuckling for a brief moment at the absurdity of the situation.
“Mrs. Young, could you please put me through my counterpart in Wakanda? I need to make sure that both of our countries agree on the same line at this meeting.”
“Our sources are scarce on the matter, so it’s unclear what their relationship was like. We do know that Stark senior spent a lot of time – both during and after the war – trying to find his son…”
it’s making him, because slowly but surely he loses the red line of his thoughts, words coming out of his mouth without a logical concatenation. Tony decides to wait it out, painfully as it is, but when the other says something along the lines “I wouldn’t be a soldier if I wasn’t a soldier”, he knows he
Part of him wants to scream at Steve, and another part wants to give up his game and just kiss the idiot standing a few feet away from him.
It makes sense, obviously, but he’s still very doubtful about his own participation in this matter. Labels and he don’t really go along, never have, so he never stopped to consider what his not so secret affair with the other meant, way back when. And now, well, it simply doesn’t matter anymore, because what’s the point? It’s in the
“G-Guess so…” he replies, noticing just now that the other’s hand is upon his. So he takes it to his lips to leave a soft kiss on its back, staring at his man in silence and smiling as brightly as he can.
“No, it’s okay, I was… lost into my thoughts,” the other replies, his eyes not meeting Tony’s, as if he was embarrassed, “What’s up?”
“What do you mean?” Jessica asks him, a quite confused smile on her lips as she turns to Carol as to make sure she heard him correctly.
He knows that Miss Goodwin is looking at him, he can feel her scared glance, so he turns to her and gives her a brief nod. But if he thought she would fall in line just like that, he was solely mistaken.
Steve is right there by his side. He can tell by his smell, by his eyes that he senses on his body, by the feeling in his gut. And because of all of this, a tiny smile pops up on his lips as he gathers all the strength he can to open his eyes and speak a few words: “W-What are you doing he-here?”
that sounds. And although he cares and should rectify them, all he can think about right now is to get out of the compound as quickly as possible. He double taps his reactor and in just a couple of seconds his armor is up and running, hence allowing him to lift the remaining few boxes all at once. Rhodey looks at him and shakes his head more vigorously, following him along.
“Mission? What mission?” Tony finds himself interrupting the other, his voice slightly higher in pitch, despite his best intentions. Steve blinks, and gives him a puzzled smile.
“Good afternoon to you too” Fury replies in the flattest of tones, as if he hadn’t just been shouted at; he lets himself on a chair, gesturing for him to do the same. “Stark, please.”
? Or even magic rings, for that matter, capable of sheltering a part of the ocean so that it appears only under set circumstances? I was down there for a few days before I found the entrance – and there’s no doubt in my mind that it wasn’t because I wasn’t looking
The answer about his medical condition comes just after eight am on the following morning when he finally has the chance of speaking with his doctor. With a practicality Steve is glad for, she explains how the explosion had released some sort of toxin in the air which had somehow affected the serum in his blood, causing the broken arm, the headache, and the semi-comatose state he had been in for four days before waking up. That’s a long time, he thinks, but out loud he just thanks to the doctor and asks when he can leave the hospital. She replies whenever he likes since his values are already going back to normal, which is a relief to hear.
everything around them was. They’ve just made their way back to the house now, and Steve has gone sitting on the edge of the pool as waiting for Tony to come out of the bathroom, so that’s where he finds him a few minutes later, feet in the water and eyes up to the sky.
“No you don’t, because he didn’t show that side of him to anyone else but maybe four or five people.”
“Uh, excuse me, who are you, where are we, and most importantly, how do we get out of here?” asks Tony, a nervousness in his tone that he wishes he could disguise somehow. If the being minds to be questioned, it surely doesn’t show any signs, as his voice doesn’t register any variation as he answers.
Except for a few moment of consciousness – like when Jocasta gets back, reporting that everything worked perfectly and the system is fully functional, or like when the pager goes off multiple times in a short while as Steve tries to figure out just
“I had the same, which can only mean one thing,” he sighs, shaking his head to himself and covering his face with a hand, “I hoped we’d get a slightly longer break from them this time, I can’t stand those damn stones…” On the other end, the line has gone silent for the last few seconds, although it’s only now that he notices it. It doesn’t take a question for him to realize what Steve is thinking, or to figure out that his dream had Tony holding the gem instead. “I’d never ask you to forget me, you know that, right?”
Curious if that’s the case. He always thought either his own being would completely cease to exist, or that it would perennially fluctuate in the ether, as if it was a really high frequency sound, imperceptible to humans but there nevertheless. But this… he doesn’t quite know how to explain it, because it’s like he still
It takes some time – and a couple more of handkerchiefs – but eventually he manages to get all the crusty blood off Steve’s face. He knows it does nothing for the wounds, nevertheless he thinks it makes him more… himself, and maybe that could help him on a psychological level. He has no clue really, but at this point it doesn’t really matter to him. And maybe it’s just his mind playing tricks on him, but when Steve talks again, his voice sounds somewhat stronger.
Steve’s smile grows a bit now and it becomes lighter, giving Tony the smallest flicker of hope in his heart; he stands up and heads to the sink nearby, fishing a handkerchief from his pocket and letting some cold water on it before going back to his seat. He moves the chair closer to the bed and then carefully and gently starts cleaning up Steve’s face, trying to be as delicate as he possibly can.
“How did you know it was me?” Steve replies, although it’s merely an excuse to postpone the real question he’s come down here to ask him.
“Glad you like them…” the other replies, pausing for a second before adding: “Hey, look what I’ve just found…”
Steve doesn’t exactly know why the revelation surprises – and angers – him so much. It’s not like he even knew the old man had a son, and frankly, this changes nothing about the hero he grew up idolizing so much. But maybe it’s deeper than that. Maybe it’s because, although he remembers almost nothing about his own father – mostly fragments that now and then returns to his mind like deja-vus – the sense of abandonment and the consequent belief that his dad’s taking off was his fault have never really left him, and hearing a somewhat similar story can’t but make him all the more sympathetic towards Anthony.
in comparison – adding another one to the mix is not going to upset some crazy balance in the universe or anything like that.
, and couldn’t imagine him wearing anything else. Now, Tony can feel his eyes welling up at the memory, so he forces himself to look away before speaking again.
“Doctor, a word?” the eyepatch appears on the doorframe again, and just as she excuses herself holding a finger up, the blonde guy re-enters the room, only this time he grabs a chair on his way back and positions it next to Tony’s bed, giving him a earnest smile.
“Look at you, arguing back to me. I have to say, I’m impressed. Fine, I’ll give you 7 then, but only as a… personal favor.”
Rhodey smiles and is about to reply when FRIDAY’s voice plays in the room, catching them both off guard. Tony had completely forgotten he had installed the A.I. in the speakerphones of his room.
– he stops halfway through pulling the cables off when the date comes back to his mind and he realizes with a wave of panic that he hasn’t contacted Steve ever since. He gets ahold of his phone again and quickly types in a message: ‘Sorry for being AWOL, things have been crazy. Tomorrow okay?’ He sends it via normal messaging, the one that doesn’t require internet access, and for the first time since meeting him he’s actually glad Steve was born in the twentieth century. The reply arrives not even five minutes later: ‘Tomorrow is great.’
As he says this Tony could almost swear he can spot some kind of embarrassment going on, which quite confuses him: “What is it, a condom? Are you just remembering that now?!” he frowns, but Steve quickly (and frantically) shakes his head, and now a decisive redness is emerging on his cheeks.
He takes a deep sigh, shaking his head to himself as to get rid of all these nasty thoughts, the last thing he needs right now. Can’t be going into the most terrible battle kind of wishing you were dead already, can you? It doesn’t seem that productive, or smart. He opens the drawer of his bedside table and looks at the bunch of envelopes tied together by an elastic band. The first one says ‘Pepper’ on the front, but the rest of them are all directed to different people (although he can only hope that, was he to actually die, there would indeed be some of those other addressees left alive). Rhodey, Happy, May, Steve, Bruce, Nat, even Thor; he still doesn’t know why he wrote letters to all of them – it was only meant to be one letter for Pepper, to try and explain, once and for all, why he did what he did, over and over – but after the first one he found himself not able to stop. His words contained far too many feelings, they were soppy and cheesy and totally uncharacteristically of him, so much so that, were people to read them, they would probably think someone else had been their author instead.
And right then Steve does something that Tony will remember for the rest of his days. He puts both of his hands on his shoulders and looks at him straight into his eyes, giving him several shivers all down the spine.
But Tony has no intention of obeying, so he follows the stream of nurses in the room, standing aside as to not obstruct their maneuvers.
,” he teases him back, half a smirk across his face as he lays a close fist against the other’s chest, fully aware that Steve doesn’t particularly enjoy being called by his former title. That is, unless it’s Tony doing it, and again, he ignores the reason for it. Steve leans a hand on Tony’s wrist, but instead of moving his fist away, he just
“Stark, I’m serious. It wasn’t a coincidence that we found you. The Watcher summoned us, you’re needed back on Earth. Now.”
“You still don’t get it, do you? I know this plan sucks, but it’s the best I’ve got. If it fails, or if you refuse to go through with it, you and Rogers and I and those kids and every other minority out there won’t be able to have a life
His next step is calling off another kind of engagement, and this one turns out to be slightly more painful than the ‘we’re going to get married’ type he had with Pepper; but, although he feels really guilty thinking of it in these terms, he also can’t deny it is the truth. They both return to L.A. the following morning, but after telling Happy to drive Pep to the SI Headquarters, he gets back on the plane to fly to upstate New York.
“You and I both,” he replies without lifting his eyes from the paper, finally recognizing Moon River, “How can I help y—“
Another pause, this time longer. Steve allows it to happen, despite wanting to know more about his condition and less about the circumstances, but he senses that would be a mistake. He has never witnessed Tony being as raw and open as he is right now, and god knows how many times he has tried to have a conversation like this before.
Steve manages to get him, almost instantly, probably without even trying. Tony doesn’t understand how or why this happens – or when it actually started – he just hopes the other will never stop doing it, because he doesn’t think he could do without it now.
“C’mon, Tom, let’s leave this shit hole,” Mr. Field nods to his accomplice, who is still brandishing the gun around as if it was a flag at a 4
Tony is confused, and wouldn’t mind an actual explanation, but that’s a door he doesn’t feel like opening right now.
“Say it, Steve.” he sighs, and he swears, he’s gonna buy him a book about flirting one of these days.
They stop in front of Steve’s room, and the doctor steps in front of him, giving a deep and penetrating stare that makes the whole of Tony’s body grow limp in a second, so much so that he has to lean a hand against the wall to stay on his feet.
, Steve. And then the world, of course. So, you see, that’s what love does. It fucks up your brain so you don’t think straight anymore. You make impulsive decisions because your heart is the one beneath the wheel, not your mind. Why exactly do you think we got stuck in here, both of us?
Steve shakes his head, now visibly awkward, and sighs heavily before distending one of his hands underneath a pillow and taking a small black box out, holding it tight as speaking again.
His voice is shaking too evidently now for him to keep pretending he’s not hearing it; so he turns to face him, and does something that he would have never done back on Earth: he takes Steve’s hands into his, leaning his forehead against his, and starts singing softly:
, he wonders as he brushes his teeth before quickly getting dressed, eyes attentively exploring his surroundings in search of clues that could reveal his whereabouts. But even as he makes his way downstairs – aided by some sort of ‘smart watch’ on his wrist that shows him where the meeting he
“Well, without knowing exactly what happened, or the extent of his injuries, I can’t tell for sure. But if I had to just go with my gut feeling? This guy is clearly a fighter. Wouldn’t make sense if he gave up now, just as help has come for him, would it?”
But it only gets worse, because now Steve is stretching a hand forward, taking Tony’s into his, and closing the remaining gap between them.
Unfortunately for them, his prediction turns out to be just right: although the whole month sees an increase of reportages and exclusives from the most important national newspapers about the president’s plans for the country, it seems like they fail to reach their goal, because in the polls conducted by the White House and independent parties alike, people don’t seem too concerned with the situation, the most popular conceptions being that “they could be made up” and “I’ll believe it when I see it”. Not for the first time, Tony is left wondering when exactly the world turned out to be so
And he closes his eyes although he’s not tired or anything, but he figures it’s better to not give Steve the chance to start a conversation again, especially not the kind that he guesses is still on the other’s mind.
Steve throws a quick glance backwards to spot the damage, and he hears him sighing quietly: “Probably did it on purpose. I’ll try to get SHIELD to pay for it,” he then adds, as the idea suddenly hits him.
on the spot.” Tony jokes, mostly to hide the truth behind what he’s saying, which is that he had in fact actively enjoyed their fake date together.
, not after being put second, after he had gone and messed up the fragile equilibrium in his life for the umpteenth time.
“At one condition,” Tony lifts up a finger before propping himself slowly up on his elbows, “You call me ‘Tony’. Only a few people used my full name, and one of them was my father, so I’m definitely
Both of them stare at their surroundings, probably to avoid saying other stuff they might later regret; but it’s a lost battle, because surely enough, Steve pretty soon follows up with the question Tony was dreading to hear – one that has no reply he wants to share out loud: “Tony, where are we?”
Rhodey’s voice catches him a bit by surprise as he’s busy packing up his room, mostly because he had lost himself into not so distant memories that felt to be coming from a lifetime ago. But he’s decided to ignore his feelings and power through what needs to be done, as he knows he wouldn’t be able to finish it on time were he to stop and take a moment every time an item reminds him of something.
“Alien invasion permitting, we’re going shopping tomorrow as well, don’t want to hear excuses.” he eventually says after he manages to combine the least of two evils between a top and a bottom, passing both items to Steve, who grabs them with a sigh and proceeds to wear them, muttering something beneath his breath that Tony can’t possibly understand.
“Anyway, Rogers is gonna have to lay low at least until the elections, then, if the worst becomes a reality, phase 2 will have to be put in motion.”
“Hey…” he replies, and after another moment he opens his eyes, just because it feels stupid not to. Steve gives him a faint, tired smile and without asking permission he sits down on his bed, just by Tony’s tummy, although their bodies stay separate, not touching.
Steve stays there, face against the metal bars, watching the other until he’s all but disappeared from his vision; then he sighs softly and slowly goes back to the hard bed, lying down with his eyes fixed on the ceiling, the shadow of a smile still brightening up his whole face.
“Where?” she then asks, and damn, it’s a single word but hits him like a full-blown fist in the face.
human, even with the serum, because guess what?, that doesn’t make you invincible or anything, it just gives you extra strength and stamina, but if you get hit badly… well, this is what happens, I suppose.” He stops at this point, shakes his head to himself, pinches the bridge of his nose as trying to focus his words to what he actually wants to say rather than a confused mumble. Not that he fully knows what that is anyway. But he feels he at least
“Say, as rare as it is for me to have something broken, surely it doesn’t require spending a night in a hospital. Adding to this your uncharacteristic lack of words… What’s wrong with me?’
– is a middle aged, 5’9”, slightly on the plus size, brown eyes and hair, white dude who – Tony doesn’t know for sure, but has very little doubt about this – is married to an equally standard-looking woman with whom he has two kids, rigorously a boy and a girl.
“Ssso, to summarize… It’s 2019, I’ve been frozen for seventy years, superheroes and demigods actually
Steve stays silent for a short while, those words running into his brain as they get processed and then accepted; he nods eventually, smiling a bit in his direction: “I figure… that’s for the best. But before we move on, I just want to tell you again how sorry I am. And…” he gets closer to Tony, putting a hand over his mouth to keep him from talking, as he was just about to. “And it’s important to me that you understand this, I am fully aware that my actions didn’t make any sense, I wasn’t being rational, it was all pure… emotion, if you want to call it that. The… lying to you, that is. Not the Accords. But then again, that wasn’t really the problem, was it?” he adds, once again underlining it more for his own benefit. “I’m sorry, Tony.”
Steve offers him a smile – small but honest, all that he can manage – and gives a brief nod. The words that follow are not exactly
. How everything turned black, the sounds ended and this emptiness began. But if this is indeed the case, and still he can hear the voice, does it mean…?
– lying on his elbows, legs spread to reveal his butthole, dick dangling hard between them. Yeah, Steve read the clues correctly alright. He smirks without any joy, and if he could see himself in the mirror he wouldn’t be able to recognize himself.
“Yeah, you’re missing the fact that it’s Saturday evening, you shouldn’t be working.” Tony smiles at him, gently taking the piece of paper Steve was still holding into his hands and putting it away with the rest.
Tony knows what he would do if this was a normal circumstance: take the person’s hands in his, smile gently to them, wait a few seconds for them to be comfortable and able to move away or stop him if they wanted to, and then, if they stay in their position, lean in and kiss them slowly and gently, no tongue involved – that’s for a later time.
“Are you… alright?” the other asks, frowning, not quite sure what to make of such a secretive entrance.
, taking a tentative step towards the other man. Which has the only effect of making Tony take one back, stretching both arms out as to put more distance between the two of them.
“We’re here, we’re all g—“ Steve starts replying, but before he can finish his sentence Tony closes the already small gap between them and leans the tiniest of pecks upon the other’s lips. When he’ll think about about it later, it’ll surprise him to realize that he didn’t actually
“Who would have thought, Rogers? Maybe you’re not completely hopeless after all…” he nods, straightening on his chair as reaching out for his wallet in the back of his pants. “
calls him by his first name, except, well, mainly Pepper and Steve, plus he’s never told him he could do that – although that might be beside the point, him being the President and all.
Once his job officially starts – he can’t believe everything that has come before was only a very long, very elaborate prep talk – the reality of his position and just exactly how high up he is suddenly dawn on him, making him realize for the first time just how
“Ross did. It was alright at the beginning – as you said, he was more mad at you for leaving than me for coming back – but pretty soon things begun getting out of hand to the point that I felt I was actually committing treason to some extent, so I quit. I had no other choice, really. And maybe that’s what he wanted all along.”
, he reminds himself, and after a couple of seconds more, he taps his fingers on the table and smiles widely: “You’re gonna love it. Shall we begin this feast?”
Steve nods towards the villa: “You said this is all yours, right? Like… Do you have people running the house, or…”
“Okay, um, let’s go…” he mumbles, stretching a hand towards the other and hoping he’s not blushing – but he
“S-Steve Rogers,” he mumbles in response, stretching his hand forward a fraction of a second later to be polite; Thor looks at it for a few moments, as if unsure what to do with it, but eventually holds it, so tightly that Steve is about to groan. Luckily for his dignity, the other lets it go just in time.
“What is it?” he asks, turning around to look at him, but as he does, he finds Steve’s face mere inches away from his own, and before he can even formulate a question, the other’s lips capture his with such willingness that Tony doesn’t even
tells it? Really fascinating – but the bottom line is, a kiss under the mistletoe is magical, and you know what they say about magic, it bounds two people
Two people get a job done in half the time, and having his best pal with him allows Tony a more than welcome distraction from his own mind. About an hour and a half later everything is either securely packed up and ready for the storage or messily thrown in a tall pile by the door, waiting to be disposed of. While Rhodey begins the first of a few trips to move the boxes from the room to the garage downstairs, Tony does a quick survey of his surroundings, a vague sense of uneasiness and melancholy slowly making his way inside his bones as he looks at the now empty bedroom. He shouldn’t feel like this – after all the time he has spent here has been really brief (and sad for the most part) compared to what used to be his studio in the Avengers Tower – but still something about it makes it feel so…
It happens in the middle of the night, when they’re both deep asleep. First comes the roar similar to a thunder, which is what wakes them up. Then, as their eyes struggle to adjust to the sudden alertness of their nervous systems, a bright, blinding explosion follows, shattering all the windows in the flat and taking with it a couple of inside walls. Steve is the first up, feet uncaring about the shards scattered all across the floor as he tries to make his way to the bedroom.
So he tells him, and after he hangs up, he puts down on paper some questions he needs to ask people once he gets back to the US, before heading to the bathroom to take a shower. But as the warm water pours down his face and body, new fears start crawling up to him, making him shiver so much that he has to cut his ritual short. What if something happens to Steve while he’s on this mission? Would he even hear about it right away, or would Fury keep it from him until a ‘more suitable time’? And what about if he gets hurt and taken to a foreign hospital? Would he be allowed to go inside his room, sit by his bed, hold his hand and whisper into his ear that everything will be alright? He could probably get away with it in his own country, given his official position in the government and everything, but what about in a foreign nation that is not Wakanda? He doesn’t think they would give a damn about the US Secretary of Defense if that meant going against protocol, or the patient’s privacy. He has never thought about it in those terms before this very moment, and he wishes he wasn’t doing it now either, but for some reason these considerations keep popping up into his mind like bullets straight off a machine gun, and no matter how
is going to take place – his deductions and ideas stop at the general understanding that he is in some sort of high tech cave. As to where this is or why he’s here, exactly, he has nothing: no matter how hard he tries, he can’t seem to have any precise recollection of what he might have been doing yesterday, what might have led him to such strange a place or even what kind of meeting he’s about to take part in. He’s not even sure this is, in fact, Avengers business, or just his own – a prospective that he really doesn’t look forward to, because in his present state he definitely is as useless as a sipping straw in his whiskey. The weird watch on his wrist gives out a brief vibration as he reaches two big, blue doors, and when he looks down at the display, a red dot tells him he has reached his destination. Tony stares at it for a couple of seconds, fascinated albeit confused as to exactly how such a thing is even possible.
Sitting in one of the conference rooms of his hotel a day later, waiting for Fury (and hopefully Steve) to show up, Tony’s mind is a clusterfuck of thoughts and feelings and words as he nervously taps his fingers on the big table, checking his watch every other minute, wondering if they are actually going to make it or if something will happen at the very last moment and all of this will have been for nothing. Plus, he’s growing extremely queasy at the thought of meeting Steve for the first time in almost five months, not having had any form of communication with him, not knowing if he’s okay or what he’s been up to and if that involved fighting or just laying low. What if he’s got hurt, lost an arm or something? What if he can’t make it because he’s in a hospital bed? He doesn’t think he could be dead – Fury would have told him somehow, right? Or maybe he wouldn’t, thinking that he might pull out of the mission if he knew Steve had died…
judgement – and not General Ross’s – been trusted instead of believing I was, I don’t know, pining after Rogers or something.” Which obviously was what he had spent an awful lot of time doing, but thank got they couldn’t possibly know that. He hadn’t planned to go ballistic like this, but something inside just didn’t like the subtle accusation that had been moved against him and he knew he had to set the record straight there and then, before they thought it was his weakness. Which, again, of course it is, but he would deny it on his deathbed if it helped the case.
“Now you just have to trap the piece of sushi in the middle, like this…” he says, and without thinking it over he demonstrates it, picking up the hosomaki and taking it to Steve’s mouth, watching the other as he parts his lips to let the food inside.
a pain in my ass, just as much as Rogers is. But my personal feelings are irrelevant in this matter because we’re talking about national – and international – security, there is no room for individual grievances.”
He wants so desperately to lie, to say that he was just really pissed off with Nick for the way he’s kept him in the dark this whole time, as if he was not to be trusted; but he’s tired from having to lead a double life as it is and he knows Steve would read right through his thoughts, so he just goes with the truth: “It’s hard, one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. And I’m so… forcefully isolated that I had to upgrade Jocasta to have someone to talk to…”
There’s a moment of absolute stillness in which neither of them speak or move, one out of breath for how
– and still it forces him to go down memory lane to find an answer, the one place he really needs to steer away from. It’s got to be before the snap, because after… after it’s like he wasn’t
Steve lets his hand go, freeing his mouth, but Tony doesn’t have words to say for once, because it seems like their minds are communicating again, silently exchanging words and thoughts as they used to before shit went down; that’s the best feeling he has ever experienced in his life, and he was missing it so damn much. How many nights had he been staying up, wondering if this would ever happen again, being connected so deeply to another person that all it takes is a look or a gesture to transform ideas into actions, fear into reassurance, pain into joy? As these invisible links are connecting again, Tony catches Steve’s free hand with his and intertwines their fingers together, stepping in closer and starting to kiss him slowly, closing his eyes and focusing on the movements of his own lips, as if they were somehow able to convey secret meanings, inexplicable with words. The other isn’t surprised by this out-of-the-blue gesture and doesn’t hesitate to reciprocate, squeezing his hand so tightly that it starts to ache, but Tony takes little notice of it, because this instant that turns into minutes has lingered in his mind for so long that had become a parasite, always present, always ready to pop up unexpectedly, causing him pain and anger and resentment because why would you ever throw away something
As Tony had more or less anticipated, an alien emergency is exactly what happens the following day, just as he was getting ready to push Steve into the elevator to go shopping, and the not too subtle smile of relief on the other’s face doesn’t go unnoticed either.
, but in the end he would always chicken out because he’s just too scared of losing that little of Steve he actually gets nowadays, and if that means keeping his mouth shut and pretending everything is
like. They haven’t spoken much since he landed back to Earth – there was a strong, long hug, one which he was longing for and had craved so much, but after that, it was like neither of them had the energy or strength to try and say all those things that so desperately
, but he stared at me for so long that I just said yes so he would stop. It was a comedy from the Thirties – I actually remember watching it in the theater when it came out – and it was so funny but I still couldn’t laugh, no matter how hard I tried to. It just… My eyes become watery on their own, it’s like I have no control over them nowadays. That was nice anyway, a few other people ended up watching it with us, which felt like the old times except, well…” his voice trails off, and he snuffles hard, rubbing the back of his hand under his nose before he can continue. “Are you having a party of some sort today then? I think it would be amazing if that was the case, and if it’s not a tradition yet, you should try and create it, if someone can re-write the laws of the afterlife is you, baby. After all, anniversaries are a thing on Earth, why shouldn’t they be over there too? It just seems apt to me. We… There’s gonna be a vigil here in like, ten minutes, I tried telling them that’s not what you would have wanted but I was in a minority, so they went ahead and organized it all the same. There’s gonna be a bunch of people you can’t stand so, I don’t know, maybe look away? Or focus on the ones who really care about you, because they all are gonna be here.”
“Get your hands off me!” he yells, shoving Steve with all the strength he can muster, managing to make him stumble back of a couple of steps. But he has no time to enjoy his little victory because before he even realizes it, a punch lands on the left side of his face, sending him against the wall first and then, as his head hits the hard surface, on the floor, where everything turns suddenly pitch black.
his area of expertise, see just how many of his most notable ideas turned out in global catastrophes merely because he hadn’t weighted in common sense factors.
“Getting these damn rings back, that’s what I’m doing. I’ve lost enough time trying to play nice. Turns out my father was right after all. Sometimes the end does justify the means. This is an example.”
“What can I say, I got bored one day and this ad popped up on my laptop, so I placed a couple of bids and kinda forgot about it until I received a notification on my phone saying that I’d won one of the auctions. It’s called… Baccus Island, but we can change the name if you don’t like it.”
They fall in another silence, and he knows it’s just a matter of time until Bucky voices his thoughts yet again, but luckily for him Sam comes back with plenty of drinks on a tray. Too many, in fact.
There’s a brief pause during which Steve comes really short of pushing for more details, but reading into Tony’s eyes how reluctant his friend is to have this kind of conversation, he decides to bring the subject back to dating: “I don’t get it though, you are in a way talking about your job.”
“Was that General Ross by any chance?” he asks, because he doesn’t see the point in pretending to be a complete idiot when they both know he isn’t.
“Obviously we don’t know how the serum actually works, which is why the doctors had to improvise a bit with the prognosis. If you ask me, they were trying different things to see what happened, which is why I was so glad when you opened your eyes, it meant t—“
“Son of a bitch…” he mutters to himself, shaking his head and sighing before answering to Steve’s question: “Let me guess. You don’t know that I met with Fury, like, six weeks ago.”
“We’ve gotta stop meeting like this, Steve…” Tony says, half a grin on his face which he knows is there just to hide the lingering concern behind his misleading light tone.
“Here, let me show you…” he offers, picking up his own set again to show it off to his companion. “You just put your middle here and then you move them with the other two fingers. It might take you a bit of practice, so don’t worry, it’s completely normal.”
“Well, you can say what you want about Tony, but I really feel he’s been giving me some solid advice.” Steve chimes in, once again coming to his rescue, causing all sets of eyes to focus back on him, Tony’s included, staring at him for a split second before adding, in what later Tony would think of as nothing short of a social suicide: “Like, did you know that you
, he ponders, the image of that strange creature he encountered just a couple of days ago still vivid in his memory.
“Okay, well, merry Christmas…” he wishes to his lab, deciding he’s allowed to feel sorry for himself right now, he’s like a fallen resistance leader or something along those lines who used to be surrounded by people who enjoyed his company, but who now spends his days alone trying to understand where it all went wrong. Except, Tony knows perfectly
And then, just when he thought he had managed to find a way to be okay with what he’s doing, it comes another blow; it’s the Monday before Election Day, and the campaign’s last stop is, unsurprisingly, in Indiana. The crowd is their biggest ever, and for the occasion they ask him to stay on stage for the whole duration of the President’s speech; not thinking much of it (and, to be fair, not seeing any plausible reason to decline), he agrees, so instead of walking off stage he takes place on the right of the man now talking into the microphone. It’s the same words he’s heard over and over for the past month and a half: enough immigrants, less taxes, who cares about the environment and so on – pretty soon his mind goes back to the final fight with Thanos, how he and Steve and Thor and Carol had spent months planning each and every move they were going to do once on Titan, practicing for twenty hours a day their steps and even their speeches, just to make sure they had everything covered as much as possible.
But before he can conclude what, without any doubt, would have been a very disastrous sentence, Tony’s elbow digs deeply into Steve’s side, making him shut up at once as his eyes turn to him.
Steve, who has stayed silent throughout his recounting, doesn’t say a word still for a minute or so, possibly mulling over the amount of shit that has just been regurgitated onto him. He takes a sip from his bottle, and Tony has to look away because every time he’s not delivering bad news all he can think about is kissing the man next to him and touching him and getting lost in his smell and his body. But he can’t, not now – who actually knows
But now that he’s heard that ‘of course’, Tony is not afraid to push his intentions further; after all, the year spent in space has cleared up his mind exactly how he wished it would.
Five minutes later, Steve is floating in the ocean water, eyes squinted to spot anything out of the ordinary, although he’s not quite sure what

His first stop is Tony’s quarters (calling them simply rooms would be highly inaccurate, given their size), but after knocking on the door for a good ten minutes, he assumes he’s either not in there, or very deeply asleep. So he finds with Jarvis, who, very unhelpfully, tells him that “Master Stark left very late last night and hasn’t been back yet”. Finally, he tries asking the others whether they have any idea where Tony could be, but unsurprisingly, nobody does. The man is very good at keeping his private business completely separate.

, he loves this man so much and had missed him so badly that being in his arms now seems too good to be true. He wraps his arms around Steve’s neck and stays silent, just staring into his eyes as if it’s the first time he’s meeting him, and wonders how the hell he has managed to survive in the past when Steve was missing, or dead, or during any other shitty situation that has happened to them.
