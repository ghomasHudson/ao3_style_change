Castiel frowns, and his head does the tilty thing that Dean thinks makes him look like a perturbed owl.  “Then what was the bet?”
With a smile, Castiel settles down next to him and pulls him close.  Dean cuddles into his chest, and tangles their legs together.  A sense of profound contentment spreads through him.  He can’t remember the last time he’s felt this relaxed.  Despite the languid warmth in his limbs, he’s not tired though.
A stab of possessiveness makes Dean squint at his phone.  And then he immediately feels ridiculous, because Castiel doesn’t belong to him.  And he’d probably left Purgatory hours ago.
As he signs on, his vision of the greenhouse pixelates and disappears.  After a few nanoseconds the nothingess folds outward into a large stone hall lined with tables and benches.  The walls are decorated in colorful banners which do little to muffle the echo of voices.  He has no sense of smell, but he knows that the air is probably full of a myriad of scents, since each signal sent from the game to his sense processing software generates an error.  He shunts them off to a separate file to be deleted later when he logs off.
“Would you like to do something else with my mouth?”  Castiel tightens his grip around Dean’s fingers, and closes the small gap separating them.  He lifts Dean’s hand to his mouth and laps his tongue over their interlaced knuckles.  “It serves multiple functions.”
He sits upright and triggers the sunstrips when he realizes that he’ll fall off the edge of the bed before he reaches Castiel.
Dean huffs a laugh and shakes his head.  “Hell if I know.  Sam seems to think it does, but it’s never helped me.”
“I win!” Black Eyes declares.  A knife embedded in the wall they were using as target practice wriggles free of the wood and then flies across the room, embedding itself in the Apache’s throat.
“I’m the reason it’s illegal,” Chuck says with a nervous laugh.  “I’m Charles Shurley, and I created the Lunar AI that wiped out everyone on the moon base during the Resource Wars.”
Castiel shakes his head slowly, and his squint intensifies.  He turns it in Dean’s direction.  “I enjoy reading and watching movies, but I find both options unappealing at the moment.”
“I let CAstiel take her out this morning.”  At Dean’s surprised look, he shrugs and explains.  “He came by about an hour ago. I think he needed some time alone, and I suggested taking a ride up to the spring meadow.”
Castiel nods, and turns his attention back to the hanging wall of cloth in front of him.  He starts pushing them apart so he can check the styles more clearly, and access the tags.
“You can change into something you bought if you want to,” Krissy offers Castiel once the exchange is complete.
It’s Alfie.  Castiel wants to tell him to be quiet, and to watch out for himself, but his lips don’t seem to be able to cooperate.
Sam’s eyes bounce from Dean to Castiel standing at his shoulder.  There’s a hundred burning questions in his eyes, but for once he opts not to voice any of them.  “I found a hunt.  You were set on Do Not Disturb, so I came to see if you feel up to checking it out?”
Hannah breaks the silence, and she speaks softly enough that Castiel has to lean closer to hear her.  “When I heard you had overdosed… it brought a lot of things home to me.  I realized that I almost lost you, and it was my fault, and--”
Castiel paused his sketching long enough to mutter darkly: “I used to lead the garrisons. Now I’m ‘just there.’' He looked over his shoulder and scowled at Dean. “You’re lucky I need to keep you out of Hell, Dean, or I’d throw you back in.”
After a few seconds of stunned silence, Sam spoke with concern. “That sounds like word salad…Hey, Dean, you don’t smell toast, do you?”
He managed to make his way over to the table and sit down in one of the chairs. Dean stifled a loud yawn and shook his head a little, thinking that would help clear up the fogginess.
With a flicker, Cas disappeared and reappeared a few steps away without the zipper on his face. "If God actually wanted to release her, nothing we could do could stop him."
“Ruby, if you’ve got time to tease me, you’ve got time to study,” he chokes out; Sam isn’t sure if he’s choking from embarrassment or laughter.
“If that’s not enough of an incentive for you, well…I’d hate to see anything happen to those cute girls in the other room, or that little flock of sheep you’ve managed to ingratiate yourself into. What’s that little girl’s name….Jo?”
He hesitates as it occurs to him that he’s never told Rowena about his attraction to men.  It isn’t something that had ever come up because he’d met her when his main focus was his career, then after he’d met Hannah it was a moot point.  But he doesn’t have any reason to hide the information from Rowena now that the subject has come up.  He’s seen the little rainbow flag in the pen container on her desk.  “Him, actually,” he says. “His name is Dean.  My bike broke down and he’s fixing it for me.”
A bitter smile twists Dean’s lips.  “Oh I see.  So I’m an asshole for trying to keep him safe, but it’s okay for you to encourage him to lie to me?  Nice, Sam.”
“We’ve been serious for years, Dean.”  Sam rummages under his bed and pulls out a pair of dusty boots, slides his feet in and starts lacing them up.  “You know we have.”
Castiel also smiles in spite of their desperate situation.  “Very recently.  And thankfully they never bothered to search me for it.”  His smile fades slightly, and he looks away.  “Although I guess it would have done very little against Black Eyes.”
(The reason was that I was rushing to write it for a mini bang with an 8k minimum, with 6 weeks to write it, and I had to drop out because I was at 70k by the deadline with the end still far distant, and I used NanoWrimo to finish it.  This was before I learned that I'm just LikeThat, and that writing shortfic is not my forte.)
Everywhere the Comancheros visit, they leave death and ruin.  And a clear message promising the same to anyone who dares follow.
Sam agrees, adding “I’ve ridden it plenty of times, and the trail is good and clearly marked.  But I could go with you if you’d like.”
Now that too lies cold inside him.  The angry words they exchanged had seen to that.  It seems there is no escaping the consequences of his hastily spoken threat.
Wordlessly, Dean takes the mug and sets it on a nearby fencepost, then steps even closer to Castiel.  With the sun down, and the light from the cabin at his back, his face is shadowed, but Castiel can’t miss the intent in his expression.
Castiel isn’t hard, but Dean still pulls him free of his clothing.  And Castiel’s body responds to the skin on skin touch just as a human’s would.
“No pro-” he’s interrupted by a jaw-popping yawn.  Shaking his head to clear it of the sudden wave of exhaustion, he tries again.  “No problem, buddy.  You need anything else right now?”
Pamela’s milky eyes follow the gold, and her calculating expression says that she knows when there is good money to be made.  Castiel hopes that will work in his favor.
“Thanks, Charlie,” Sam says, holding out his arms for another hug, a silent request she happily complies with.  “We’ve taken up a lot of your time, so we should get out of your hair.”
“Hopefully somewhere out there.” Dean gestures vaguely overhead.  “He won’t get caught,” he whispers with the kind of conviction that sounds like he’s trying to convince himself more than Castiel.  “He’ll try to meet up with us later.”
Dean’s hands, one still slick with lube, come to rest over Castiel’s.  He grins mischievously and resists letting Castiel guide him.  Any time he starts to fall into a steady rhythm and Castiel feels his orgasm tugging at his belly Dean changes his movements.  And the asshat actually laughs when Castiel starts swearing.
“Oh. I must have missed him,” Castiel murmurs.  He looks disappointed, and Sam marvels at the genius behind his programming, even as he hopes they’re not an Evil Genius.
Just like he hasn’t talked to anyone else about this shit.  Sam used to try and get him to open up about it, which is understandable since the only story he’d been given was the official report when he was informed of Dean’s injuries.  When Dean had been moved to a hospital in the USA to continue the rest of his recovery, Sam had tried leveraging the puppy dog eyes, but Dean never cracked.
Even warm, the water is delicious on his parched tongue.  He sighs his relief as he lowers and recaps it.  “Thank you, Sam,” he says as he hands it back.
He’d barely gotten to the discovery of the town’s first victim to the creatures when he noticed he was tapping his fingers more than usual. Resigned, he went to find Sam.
Cas’s eyes flickered towards him, but Dean managed to look away in time. He noticed Cas’s shoulders sink just a touch, but Dean resolutely ignored him. He might have looked impassive but inside his brain was a wreck. Even after spending most of the car trip working out his thoughts on the matter, he still had no clue was he thought about Cas.
That made Bobby laugh. “Well, I gotta head out. You boys take care.” As he walked around to the driver’s side of his car, he pointed to the place Cas invisibly stood. “That includes you, too, Cas. It’s good to have a face to the name. Y’all stay under the radar. Call me if you need me.”
When Anna nodded her consent, Pamela looked her over. “So, do you have any idea why you started hearing the voices of the angels?”
The sincerity of the moment was ruined slightly when Cas stood there stiff as a board, wide-eyed and uncertain. Sam cleared his throat. “You’re supposed to hug back.”
All eyes looked at Cas. The weapon squirmed uncomfortably under their gaze. “I’m not a monk,” he simply stated.
Sam nodded sympathetically. “Well, he knows where to find me if he wants to talk. I’m a resident expert in asshole older brothers.”
“You’re talking to an angel about ‘ancient grain cultivation’?” Dean spat the words out like they were rancid. Both the nerds turned to him, clearly having forgotten he was there driving the damn car.
Dean and Castiel grabbed their coats and ran to their apartment with the car parked behind it. Sam and the girls arrived just as they got down to their car. Sam was on Meg’s bike, holding her mid-drift, and both Dean and Castiel felt a pang of jealously at the nerdy meister holding onto one of the hottest girls in the DWMA; both sighed at the unfairness of it all.
Sam ran a hand through his hair. Dean noticed how much it had grown in the past few months. He was tempted to hold Sam down and shave him like a sheepdog. “I was just...going to go for a drive, try to clear my head. Not every day your dead brother shows back up on your doorstep.”
Sam made a non-committal sound but didn’t move to set his computer aside or make for the food. Though tempted to close the laptop’s lid, Dean instead grabbed one of the pieces of toast, folded it in half, then proceeded to devour it in two giant bites. Even his loud chipmunk impression did nothing to earn any sort of reaction from his brother.
Dean grunted in exasperation. He was loud enough that he caught Sam’s attention, who started to pull his headphones off. Dean waved at him, and Sam frowned but went back to his music.
“Oh, I’ve heard otherwise. You and your partner killed the Krampus. I’d say that’s a tidbit worth noting, don’t you?”
“Sorry, Clarence, but that’s the way life is. You need to accept the fact that you two will be hunting kishin-eggs, which are dangerous. People get hurt. People can die. Your partner got a gash on his leg, but he still kept fighting, Cas. Dean’s stronger than you seem to give him credit for. You’ve been on this guilt trip for too long, so either ride it all the way home or get off now.”
Dean was glad Anna was there despite his current irritation because Sam would have kept asking questions he didn’t want to answer. Alastair had left scars that Dean was always going to tote around, but that didn’t mean he ever wanted to discuss it. Especially with his little brother, the reason he’d gone to Hell in the first place.
Gabriel returned to his human form and, while looking around nervously, he grabbed the soul and swallowed it with a grimace. “Candy this isn’t,” he muttered.
“That seems a bit extreme, Dean,” Cas cut in with legitimate concern and actually stepped between them.
“Alright, fine, let’s give it a try,” Dean said, and clapped him on the shoulder, a smile spreading over his face. “I mean, after all, what’s the worst that could happen?”
Bobby noticed Sam’s new carefree grin—it lit up his face and eyes, making them less blackish-brown and more green. It prompted the memory of Sam as a laughing child to dance through the old man’s mind. He remembered four-year-old Sam squatting next to Dean, reassuring his older cousin when Dean had scratched up his knee and was crying. It was good to see that Sam was still there, under the wary teenager he’d met yesterday.
The thing let out a terrifying howl of laughter mere inches from his face, and Sam almost had the mind to piss himself right then and there, but the claws were cutting off his air. He pulled at the hand as much as possible, gasped for breathe.  Blackness started to swirl into his vision as the lack of oxygen started to cause him to lose consciousness.
With a snap of his fingers and his smirk back in place, Gabriel and Sam disappeared. Anna and Dean locked eyes as Cas buzzed inside, like pulsing heartburn.
“Don’t you dare, Cas!” Ellen said. “You helped save Jo’s life yesterday. We’ll get whatever you want during your stay, won’t we?” she said, looking at Bobby. Her husband sighed and nodded.
“If angels existed, then why does life suck?” The bitterness in Dean’s voice cut straight down to the bone.
Cas nodded, a little disappointed she hadn’t said yes immediately, but he could be patient. Meg liked to call the shots, so he’d let her do so. They turned their attention back to the table at large; no one else at the table seemed to have been listening to Meg and Castiel’s discussion.
“My bet is that your terrible influences for weapons are out teaching my already scary mister how to best the best bar brawler in the city,” Gabriel said in a conspirator’s whisper.
Once the boys left, Spirit turned towards his boss. “Are you sure this is a good idea, Sir?” he asked Lord Death. “Normally students have been training at least two-three months before going into the field.”
Cas nodded in understanding. “Ah, yes, like that,” Cas said. “You’re picking up on this remarkably, Dean.”
His head didn’t hurt anymore, and his stomach rolled around but he ignored it. Because there was this sense of…electricity humming in his bones. He felt renewed, powerful. It was a wonderful feeling. He looked at the image of his bloody mouth and dark eyes and grinned.
It took Sam a moment to realize she was asking him a question. “Right,” Sam said. “So, um, did you?” He was glad she was a psychic, it made the whole conversation move a lot faster.
The tone of the dreams changed suddenly. The memory of his mother singing “Hey Jude” to him flickered and faded out and replaced by a man—it was as if someone had changed the channel when he wasn’t looking.
He didn’t respond from across the diner booth. They were camped out in a corner, unable to drive too much farther without cash, so the plan was to wait at the diner until a bar opened up and try to hustle for money. They couldn’t afford just to drive around if they weren’t heading to a case, and even then, just barely. He loved his Baby, but she guzzled gas like a Hebrew lost in the desert for forty years would guzzle water.
Cas stared straight ahead, not looking at Dean. “No. I grew up pretty isolated. My family favors independence. We were never close.”
Dean gulped. He slumped in the seat when he looked over at Castiel. “That’s a hell of a fancy way to say you're just a hallucination.” His fist opened and shut a few times as the traffic picked up at the edge of town.
Purple fire spurted from beside Cecil and Kali laid down a great swath of purple flames from her modified super-soaker, and soon the street was empty of kishin-eggs. For the moment.
“I’m a pacifist,” Cecil said, with a good-natured shrug. “I report the news, but I don’t make it, one way or the other.”
“Close your eyes, Anna.” As she settled into the cot and closed her eyes, Pamela took a deep breath. “I’m going to count backward from five. When I get to one, you’ll be completely relaxed and asleep. You’ll be able to hear me and talk to me. Do you understand, Anna?”
“What are you talking about? We just need to call Lord Death, tell him what we heard,” Sam said, unsure what to do.
She sighed. “You get one,” she said, handing water bottles to Sam and Castiel but skipping Dean. It was hard to tell who was more surprised, Ellen or her son.
“It’s clear, we gotta go,” Dean said. He tucked Castiel into his belt and made a running leap—he cleared the rooftop edge and tumbled gracefully on the neighboring roof. Now there was nothing between them and the school. Sam and Kali followed his lead, and the three of them stood and assessed the new situation.
“I thought you might be one of the chosen ones,” Castiel said quietly. “Those that can hear my True Voice and understand it. It seems I was mistaken.”
“Awesome! Hey, how do you feel about beer?” He went back to the room and pulled out a couple bottles from the duffel bag, handing one to Castiel. Dean flopped onto the couch and put his feet up on the scuffed and scratched the table, popping the cap off the drink. Cas sat next to him, looking at the beer with a mixture of curiosity and slight nervousness, like it was a ticking time-bomb. “I feel that this is alcohol, and is not allowed on school property.”
“I—um—don’t really have the—necessary assets for this,” Castiel said after a moment of looking down at himself then at the dress.
Cas told him everything about the seals, their destinies as vessels, and Sam’s to release Lucifer. All the while, Dean just kept the washcloth cool and pressed to Sam’s forehead. He watched the amulet hanging from his neck swaying like a hypnotist’s pendulum. It was better than witnessing Sam break with every word Cas spoke.
“Help me up, Sasquatch,” Gabriel ordered. Sam obliged and pulled the smaller boy up onto the couch but Gabriel almost fell into Sam’s lap. The taller boy blushed as Gabriel scrambled back onto his side of the couch, a mischievous glint in his eyes.
The shadow monster grinned at them, revealing a mouth full of dagger-teeth. It raised its claws to bring down on Dean’s head, but Dean dodged the claws and slashed upwards, the tip of the blade catching the kishin across the torso. The shadow monster howled, a noise that shook Dean to his very bones.
Dean was strangely silent; since the car had not gone into a ditch, he assumed Dean was mulling over his words and had not fallen asleep at the wheel.
On the way back from a quick trip to the bathroom, he leaned in and listened at his roommate’s door, but he simply heard loud, rhythmic breathing. The girls wouldn’t be up for another hour, more than likely two—they liked their sleep.
This arc takes place in Night Vale, and as of writing this I was up to episode 50, but this is more of a generic Night Vale storyline. So, nothing in mentioned about events that happen later in the Night Vale Canon (Old Oak Doors have no bearing on this). It’s just our favorite Night Vale characters doing what they do best.
Dean sat in a chair and Castiel slowly peeled his leather jacket off and handed it to Meg. The weapon was sitting in an opposite chair and started plucking glass from the leather with deft fingers. Dean groaned when he saw the state of his jacket, but growled when Castiel had to pull a few large slivers from his shoulders. His shirt was shredded but his back wasn’t as scratched up as it could’ve been. The Winchester’s fondness for extra layers had saved himself a lot of grief.
Sam ran a hand through his hair. “Bobby’s lore books just said an angel by the name existed, but no other details.”
Dean is pushed against the wall, and Castiel breaks from the kiss so he can start nibbling and licking down the hunter’s neck. He shivers and throws his head back against the wall. The feel of teeth biting and a tongue laving his neck makes him gasp, his eyes flutter shut.
“You sure you’re back to one hundred percent?” Bobby asked seriously. “I mean, this line of work gets awful
Ruby and Meg rematerialized beside him, both looking exhausted, though Meg was shaking and had a horrific bruise on her face. “Ow,” she moaned, hand cupping her face gently.
Dean was paranoid, more than usual. He couldn’t walk through a crowd of teens around his car because they looked too shady. Sitting in a witness’s place, he almost pissed himself when a giant ass snake crawled right over his lap (he might have had that reaction anyways--Indy had the right idea-- but still).
Cas spoke over Gabriel’s biting tone. “If we can trap Lilith without killing her until the Winchesters live and die a normal lifespan, the End of Days won’t come to pass.
“First of all, don’t call me that. It’s Sam. Secondly, I’m cross-referencing some information from an older tome. So, I
Instead, he gave Sam a crooked smile and a wink. Cleaning up, Dean grabbed the sandwich and cup of tea and meandered down the bedrooms. “Boa won’t we bingo zealous, bitch!”
The class let out a gasp as Sam suddenly had Cas in a headlock from behind. Instead of letting him go after a few seconds, Sam kept up the pressure and Cas started clawing at Sam’s arm in earnest, raw panic; his face started turning blue. There was a bloodthirsty smirk on Sam’s face.
A WORD OF WARNING!: This chapter will contain explicit sexual content in the second half, and there is a moment of under-negotiated kink, so check out the endnotes for more information.
“She tried to use that white light on me. Nothing happened. Before I could make a move, she took off. Been trying to find her while staying under the radar.”
Gabriel’s impassive face suddenly darkened, and his amber eyes gained a hard edge to them. “And then, all Hell broke loose. Michael, my oldest brother, found me. Demanded I come back home, back to the family. Told me that no one else was going to be there for me except them. He thought he was doing the right thing, that I belonged with them and needed to learn my place there. Well, I gave him the slip, and managed to make it to the DWMA. I’m safe here. If anything Kali would at least kick his ass for trying to take her weapon, but it’s the intention of the thing.”
“It’s true. A meister as old and as experienced as you are shouldn’t have missed,” Death pointed out.
Dean rolled his eyes in exasperation. He raced towards their room, planning to at least change his shirt if nothing else. “What happened to yours, Mr. ‘I’m always up before the crack of dawn thanks to my internal alarm clock’?”
Kali whipped around to face Gabriel, arms crossed in anger. “Why you little--! I am Kali Shivan, of the Shivan dynasty, and you will show me respect! I was willing to work together, but you threw that option away when you drew on my face!”
Day turned to evening to night. When the front of the car started drifting into the other lane Dean was forced to pull the car into a secluded dirt road. He pulled just far off the main road enough that no passing car would become suspicious of them. Yawning loudly and barely able to keep his eyes open, he pulled out blankets from the trunk and passed them out.
Dean threw a friendly arm around Sam’s shoulders, a trick considering he was a few inches taller. “What can I say? Genius runs in the family,” he said cheerfully.
Cas closed his eyes and leaned his head against the glass of the passenger side door. He pulled open the top buttons of his shirt, showing Dean the little bloody wound at the base of his neck.
Sam cleared his throat uncomfortably. Dean was about to shove the pine branch from his jacket pointy-end first down the bastard’s throat when Sam cut in.
Dean didn’t stop grinning, even when Sam hugged him hard enough to almost crack a rib. For a moment, all the weird shit he’d experienced was worth seeing his little brother misty-eyed with happiness at his return.
Sam dropped Dean off to get food because Dean was exhausted--the last of the hangover was stubbornly hanging on, and he felt utterly disgusting. He dropped his bag and kicked off his boots, determined to take a shower before Sam got back. Just after he pulled off his flannel and t-shirt, Dean froze.
“What? No!....Not exactly. I just don’t want to wake up from a night terror only to find myself falling 6 feet face first towards a concrete floor.” The young hunter spoke as though it was nothing unusual.
Castiel cast a quick glance at Dean. His meister had that determined stride and that look of intensity that could’ve easily scared anyone who didn’t know him. Dean was only 16, yet he already had the look of a trained killer in his emerald eyes—it hurt Castiel when he realized his partner probably had that look down before he’d even entered the DWMA.
Dean was torn between jerking the wheel and sending them crashing into a tree and dying in a fiery death, or pretending he didn’t hear what his Dad called him. The second option kept the Impala uninjured, at least.
“The grace is an extension of you, now. Imagine the power as invisible limbs: extra arms, legs, or hands you can direct mentally." Sam paused. "I know you're a DC guy, but think of it like having Spider-Man's Doc Ock's octopus arms, only invisible."
“It would be a bit easier to do this without five other brains buzzing around me at the same time,” Pamela admitted. “That alright, Sam?”
Two, there was too much sunlight streaming through the windows, meaning it was later in the morning.
“Jo!” Dean shot forward without warning, forcing Sam and Castiel to try and chase after the shaking beam of light ahead of them.
Dean was lost as he watched Cas writhing and groaning under him until he saw Cas’s eyes fly wide open, almost as black as a demon's, they were so lust-blown. Cas begged, his voice indeed wrecked with desperation. “Please, I want to ...need to...Make me come, Dean, please….”
He leaned against the wall and laughed to himself, body shaking with adrenaline, lungs sucking in the stale air most cities had.
He grinned and picked up one of the dots for her to see what it was. She raised an eyebrow. “Gummy bears?” she asked.
“Then what the hell is going on, Dad?” Dean demanded. The fact that Dean looked just as confused as Sam made him feel less alone, less like the entire family was dragging him along on a string for whatever reason.
Raphael looked out into the sky. “You can’t feel it, Castiel, but a war’s coming. A war that will require sacrifice, bloodshed, pain. There’s nothing we can do to stop it, all we can do is be prepared for when that time comes. So, Castiel, is Dean worthy of the mantle of Bladeholder? Or will I be forced to find you a truly
“That’s my dad, Bobby Winchester, and my mom, Ellen Winchester. And of course me and my little sister Jo. And that’s baby.”
“Yeah, and they do that whole ‘when one looks away the other’s staring at him’ and stuff, too,” Sam said, hand on the back of his neck. “I, uh…haha, honestly, I was wondering about that myself.”
“Dean, what is going on?” Sam demanded. Dean shook his head, trying to keep his burger down instead of letting it join the demons on the floor.
Debating what to do, he toed off his boots, draped his long-sleeve flannel over the back of the chair, pulled off his belt to lay there as well. Then, because no one could see him or stop him, he flopped onto the bed as hard as humanly possible and burrowed into the soft sheets and pillows.
“Your failure to report consistently not only made me come find you, but now you feel the urge the lie to me as well? I’m starting to think letting you go to the DWMA was a mistake.”
Keeping his earpiece in, they opted for the self-guided tour. The building was small, but the exhibits, artifacts, and giant placards of battle maps on the walls were surprisingly interesting. For example, on display was a misshapen conglomerate of metal from when a Confederate and a Union soldier’s bullet hit each other in mid-air and melted together.
The heat in the little cabin seemed to shoot into the triple digits. He eased himself onto Cas’s lap and kissed him, exploring Cas’s mouth with his tongue while his hands worked opening all the buttons on Cas’s waistcoat and shirt. Quicker than the first time, he was able to get his hands on the warm skin under Cas’s shirt and broke the kiss to huff in appreciation.
In the distance was the trademark roar of a Harley coming to life outside the bar. Considering all the bike owners were inside, everyone turned to look at Dean.
“If you’ve been concerned about engaging in any masturbatory practices because of me, I want to let you know that I don’t care.” At Dean’s mute shock, Cas kept trucking on. “I know it’s a human need. If you've been depriving yourself on my behalf, please don't.”
“How much farther?” Kali asked in a whisper. The three meisters were tired, sweaty, dirty, and becoming more frayed from paranoia. They’d dodged most of the kishin-eggs but still had to fight their way out of several scraps, and they hadn’t even managed to get to the school yet.
“Well…I found a book that mentioned the idea,” Sam said simply, keeping any more wiseass remarks to himself. “Is it true?”
“Yeah, Dean, I was there,” Sam snapped. “But he’s the most powerful being we’ve ever dealt with. I mean, if anyone could make ‘a box that can’t open,’ it’d be him.”
“Yeah, well, apparently Castiel was in Hell, too, right? You just said he pulled you both." Sam's face twisted with concern. "Which means he was there for a reason. How are you just going along with what this thing says?”
He turned to Cas. “You’re going to have to hit a few occult shops for these items. I wrote down the ones I could remember within an 8-hour drive. You can call ahead and check their stock before driving all the way.”
Another quick glance around, and satisfied he wasn’t seen, Sam made an unhurried jog to the doors to head back to his dorm to wake the girls and get ready for school. Just outside the doors he got a text back.
Sam wasn’t worried about studying for the big test in less than 6 hours. He knew the information backwards and forwards. This book was too intriguing for him to pause in his reading just to study.
There was quiet for a while before Anna cleared her throat, prompting Dean to turn down his Zepp again. “So, are you two going to tell me what you actually are?”
Sam took a step back from the parents, unsure and uncomfortable. “Wait, I just—I need a second,” he said. The surprise, the joy, the fear, he felt like he had emotional whiplash.
He obeys, and Dean steps close.  The razor’s buzzing blade feels weird against his cheek, occasionally tugging sharply at a hair before cutting it and leaving a slight sting.  It’s not painful, and Castiel concentrates on holding still.  It helps having Dean so close, because Castiel can count his freckles from this distance.
Castiel’s eyes had slipped shut without his knowledge, his attention too focused on the hands sliding over his skin.  When he opens them he tilts his head down to see that Dean has knelt down by his feet.  He watches Dean’s hands swipe closer and closer to his groin, where heat and tension is pooling, and he sees his cock respond by thickening and standing out from his body.
His skin tightens, and his fingertips tingle at the idea of driving that far from home, but he ignores the symptoms.  He’s been dealing with them since Sam’s accident, and he’s getting pretty good at pushing through it and acting like a functional human.  It’s not exactly the exposure therapy that Pam keeps suggesting, but it feels like progress anyway.  And he’s not going to throw it out the window right now when Cas needs him to hold his shit together.
Castiel lets himself be pulled into the water.  It’s slightly above lukewarm, but it feels nice compared to the cooling wind.  As Dean leads him deeper into the pool, the water gets warmer as they approach the source of the heat.  The bottom of the pool is sandy, and soft against his feet.
The patch is designed to make signs of sentience more obvious, not fix it like Naomi’s words imply.  But she always wanted a fix, didn’t she?  She always installed patches, wiped memories, wiped
Attempting to not think about his problems leads Dean to remembering the heat instead.  If there is such a place as Hell On Earth it is Arizona in the middle of August.  It doesn’t even cool down when the sun dips below the horizon.  The heat becomes slightly less oppressive, but by the time the temperature drops enough to be any kind of relief, the sun is coming back up and baking the world all over again.
Knowing that he’s gotta find said robot before he can chicken out, he pushes himself back to his feet with a sigh.  His muscles are pleasantly warm from exertion, and he’s actually feeling pretty mellow from endorphins now that he’s not having a one man pity party over Castiel’s disappearance earlier.  Now he just feels like an idiot.
Dean looks at him in time to catch an eye roll, and he almost opens his mouth to say something to sooth Cas’ wounded pride.  But his own pride keeps the words locked in his throat.  Add that to his list of sins.
As much as he’d like to have Sam here to help, Dean’s glad that Cas talked him into heading for safety first.  He just has to put his trust in Cas that this crazy plan will work.  He checks the bars at the edges of the window for any telltale signs of looseness.  They hold tight, which is not reassuring, but the rope seems sturdy and the knot is secure.
He coallates data he’s collected from Dean with stories he’s read, and movies he’s watched.  He adds Dean’s reactions to the media they’ve shared.  It’s a lot of data, but the report still runs quickly.
Still counting silently, he scans the street.  His gaze catches on the coffee shop sign on the corner across the street.  Coffee, yes.  He’ll get some coffee--decaf, in deference to his nerves.
“You got it.” Dean heads to the kitchen and throws a bag of popcorn in the microwave.  As he waits for it to finish popping, he contemplates Castiel’s defensive reaction about the pain pills.  He supposes Cas could be allergic to them, but he has a feeling there’s something deeper going on there.
Sighing, he forces his feet to move, carrying him past his bags and the temptation they contain.  He leaves the bathroom light off while he takes care of his needs, because just the thought of light makes his head pound harder.  He splashes some water on his face, which actually makes the nausea back off some, so he grabs a washcloth, wets it, and drapes it over the back of his neck.  It helps, and he sighs as some of the pain eases.
Before leaving Las Cruces Castiel had already seen a side of the brothers that doesn’t show up in any reports.  Sam is intelligent and kind, friendly and open.  Dean is capable of gentleness and patience.  But in the weeks they spend traveling south, he sees first hand how compassionate they are.
The soap slips from his trembling fingers and clatters to the tiles between his feet, making him twitch backwards into Castiel’s chest.  With a sigh he drops his chin to his chest.  “Cas, can you grab that for me please?”
He sat down and pulled out a legal pad and a pen. Listening intently, he wrote down the ingredients, instructions, and the invocation. “Alright, got it all. It looks like I’ll have to ask around about some of these, but I appreciate it, Rowena.”
The man was inspecting himself, curiously looking at his clothes and staring at his hands. “How interesting,” he muttered to himself as he opened and closed his fists. When he finally looked up at Dean, the hunter sucked in a breath.
“Sam!!” Ruby yelled in panic. She tried to take several steps forward but the metal screeched under her—any further movement would send both her and Sam tumbling down to the street.
There was silence as they listened to the rain falling steadily overhead. The angel was steadfastly looking at his amulet, mulling something over. “Can I tell you a secret if you promise not to tell another soul?”
….Dean thought to himself.  Out loud, though, he whistled. “The bookworm gets two hot girls?! What the hell?”
“I remember that,” Dean said suddenly. “Yeah, I remember that…thing. It was…god, it was like a blood-splattered-clown looking
Sam whipped around to face Cecil and Carlos. “Cecil, what exactly was the ceremony in the desert supposed to do tonight?”
by The Cab. Dean seemed to catch on that this was about Castiel. He motioned back towards the jukebox, and Castiel nodded. Castiel was talking quietly because Dean had to lean in quite far to hear whatever his angel was saying. He saw Castiel lick his lips, but Dean didn’t go for it.
When he grabbed the duffel bag from the trunk with their clothes and detergent, Cas was standing next to him. “You don’t have to hang around,” Dean said.
Castiel huffed, but he wouldn’t look Dean in the eye. “No stranger than your compulsion to check cereal boxes for spiders.”
“You know what I mean,” Dean said, scowling between him and Sam. His younger brother threw up his hands and groaned, face and ears fire-engine red from embarrassment. Gabriel snapped up a candy bar and beamed between them, chest puffed up and smirking brightly.
His mother was beautiful, and sweet, but also stern and careful. John—he was comforting when Sam scraped a knee, he was willing to sleep in Sam’s room during a nasty thunderstorm.
He cleaned up their room by emptying the trash, dusting, and hanging up any wayward clothes. Looking at Cas’s side of the bed, he noticed Cas had gotten into a bad habit of having several books lying on the floor. Currently, Cas was reading James Patterson’s
“That’s harsh, Cas,” Dean said with a wounded tone to his voice, although the glint of humor in his green eyes kept Castiel from taking Dean serious. “And to think we’re were having a bonding moment.”
Dean drove for a long time before either tried to break the silence. Not even music was playing in the background because he couldn’t be bothered to pick a tape.
Dean managed to pull back and put his hands on his hips, inspecting the weapon. He tilted his head to the side, then shook it. “Nah, never mind. Lose the tie, Cas.”
Dean thrust his dick up against Cas’s thigh, the pressure just enough to keep him grounded, but the number of sensations was threatening to drown him.
“We came too close last night, Bobby. We need to get out, before it’s too late,” Ellen said, watching the fight.
Dean looked at her, and smirked. “Well, when we were walking over here I caught a glimpse of you sitting here. I was so enchanted I ran into that pillar over there, so I’m going to need your number for insurance purposes, please.”
“I don’t know yet,” he said, before turning around completely in his seat in order to face Gabby in the back. He placed his index and middle fingers together on her arm, and concentrated.
They walked for several blocks in silence. They kept to unlit sidewalks and went around populated areas. Cas buttoned up his overcoat to hide most of the water stain, though it was still cold against his inner thighs and groin.
“Oh, yeah,” he said dismissively, trying to hide his nervousness. “Meeting the Grim Reaper is nothing to get worked up about, is it?”
He pulled over to a stretch of abandoned farmland and there was a momentary pause in the rhythm of the trip. Everyone got out a stretched, then came to the side in order to peer in at the still-sleeping Sam.
Dean sat in the chair next to Sam’s and hated how vulnerable he felt at that moment. It was as if 40 years of layers and walls he’d erected to protect himself emotionally just crumbled at that moment. How had he ever been able to just push through the numbness before? Oh, right. Usually, there was a big evil villain on their heels. No time to sit and mourn; there’s always work to do.
Cecil patted the seat next to him for Gabby to sit down in; considering how green she was suddenly looking, there was a good possibility she was going to pass out again. She took her seat, still looking stuck in a fog. “I—I don’t even…” she simply trailed off. Cecil pushed his coffee in front of her, and she started sipping it slowly, a faraway look in her eyes.
As he walked towards the kitchen, he could smell the brewed coffee. The humming he heard next as he rounded the corner. Dean was already pouring two cups of black coffee into mugs--he’d cleaned out Cas’s mug to reuse it.
The biggest Winchester moved with the stealth of the cat burglar he was and boosted himself to sit on the table in front of Cas.
“I, for one, am so looking forward to tonight! Tons of candy, awesomely bad movies, and my best buds!” Gabriel said, throwing a friendly arm around Sam’s shoulders. Sam looked a little nervous when the smaller boy winked at him. “What more could a guy want?”
When he felt the familiar prickle on the back of his neck, he cracked open an eye to see Cas was sitting next to him. His tanned forearms were wrapped around his knees as he gazed out over the junkyard. Cas gave him a genuine smile that crinkled the edges of his eyes.
“So, still hung up on possibly being Dean’s cousin, huh?” Gabriel said, cutting right to the heart of the matter.
Cas didn’t speak. Instead his hand wrapped around her head and brought their lips together again. This time Cas was responding, which trilled Meg to no end. She nipped his lips, swiped her tongue over them, asking permission.
“What, I can’t just be nice?” Both brothers jumped when Gabriel appeared in the booth seat next to Sam, taking obvious pleasure in scaring them. Dean’s knee-jerk reaction was to say that was Cas’s spot, but then he remembered he was still mad at the stupid fallen angel.
“Guess you’ve always been a nerdy little guy, huh?” Dean tried to make it sound like a gentle tease, but Cas didn’t crack. He didn’t look at Dean at all.
“You would explain that Cas had his tongue down your throat,” he said easily. “Just so there’s no confusion.”
Dean stepped inside, keeping his less than delightful memories of the room under wraps. He did a little spin in the middle of the devil's trap painted on the concrete floor. "Yup. Salt encrusted iron walls--no spirit nor demon can get in here." He pointed to a new sigil on the wall over the desk. "Anti-angel warding courtesy of Cas. This place is supernaturally bombproof."
“Oh, sorry, that’s out of order,” Cecil said with apology. “It’s supposed to spit out live scorpions, but Station Management hasn’t exactly been doing the best job keeping the vending machines properly stocked.”
It took a few minutes for everyone’s laughter to die down to a few remaining chuckles. Sam reached into his bag and pulled out two packets of sugar to put into his coffee. Gabriel grinned. “Ah, Sam, still don’t trust me?” the boy asked, wiggling his eyebrows.
“I got an idea about that,” Dean said suddenly. “Can you tap into a town-wide PA system from this thing?” he said quickly, pointing up the antennae.
Each day Dean face-planted in his too-small, musty bed and slept without nightmares due to sheer exhaustion. As the days progressed, Cas went from extra snappy to distant. He'd appear once out in the junkyard, and they’d get back to work. They didn’t talk about it or anything else, and then Cas would disappear at night. Dean recognized all too well he was being avoided.
Glancing at his phone, Dean grumbled at the extremely late (or extremely early) hour. He cleaned up his trash, stuffing everything into the shopping bag from the store. When he started to maneuver to curl his legs up on the bench seat and lie down, he paused.
His brother Sam had split from their party a few days ago to check out a witch in the area. He was supposed to be home the next day but was probably enjoying being out from under Dean’s thumb for a night. Sam wouldn’t be in a rush to get back.
“Your heart rate is elevated, and you’re experiencing an elevated stress response,” Castiel explained. “I can’t help from within you.” The hand retreated, and Dean almost reached out to grab it. Instead, he increased the pressure on the steering wheel, tight enough to make it creak.
, Dean thought to himself. How was a guy supposed to ignore his crush until it went away when his roommate just walked around half naked?
Dean winks.  “You don’t have to beg anything from me, Cas.”  The eyeroll he gets fills him with gleeful pride.  When they’re not fighting, Cas is pretty fun to tease.
places to eat?”  She pats him on the cheek, and then turns to give Castiel the same treatment.  “You boys be safe, you hear me?”
“I think that makes all of us,” Jimmy adds with a dark chuckle.  “How about we move this to the den?”
Cas gives him a long look and Dean grits his teeth against the childish urge to fidget.  No man other than his pa has ever made him squirm with just a look.  But with Cas he’s fighting the urge to apologize--hell, to
They leave the tent and find themselves at the edge of a large encampment.  The flags of many nations flutter at the entrances of the rainbow of tents surrounding them, which makes Sam grimace.  “I forgot there was a tournament going on.”
“Ruby Drops don’t have the side effects pure vamp blood does,” Sam grunts as he hauls Dean into a sitting position.  He wrinkles his nose when he gets a whiff of Dean’s sweat.  The drug is seeping out of his pores, and he’s fucking rank.
As Castiel runs his thumb over what he can now make out as a flying saucer, he wonders if there’s something in the albums that have significance.  Something that maybe Dean isn’t even aware of.  In just the short time they’ve known each other, Castiel has learned that music holds a lot of value to Dean.
“That he’ll admit to,” Sam says with a laugh as he adds Cat’s Cradle to the small pile in Castiel’s hands.  “After you read these, let me know what you think.  I’d be interested in your opinion.”
He’s most comfortable with the knives and the collapsible staff Sam gifted him when they started sparring together, so he’ll probably use them more than the guns.  Especially since he won’t have access to a shooting range now that he’s not staying in the bunker.  There’s not very much room to practice fighting in the apartment either--he can almost reach out and touch the door while sitting on the bed--but he should be able to access VR environments as long as he keeps his movements small and his arms close to his sides.  Not that he expects to access Moondor or Oz while he’s on his own, but at least he’ll have the option if needed.
After they’ve disposed of the body, they rush back to their motel to evacuate the premises.  Sam says their hunt hasn’t shown up in any police reports yet, but they don’t want to give the authorities any reason to connect them with the case.  It’s a long drive back to the bunker, but one they’re all eager for since they’d been tracking the rugaru for almost a week, and that’s after they’d hunted down a rogue werewolf infecting the homeless of the lower city, and before that they’d taken down a ghoul sneaking into apartments and killing people for fresher meat than what she could find scavenging.  Even with his uninterrupted power supply Castiel feels the need to be home where he can relax for a little while.
As irritated as Castiel is with Dean’s overprotective behavior lately, there’s no doubt that Castiel still loves him.  More than almost anything else he’s ever experienced.  Even toasted peanut butter sandwiches and almond milk.
Sam doesn’t hesitate.  He barrels into Castiel, somehow knocking the cosmic being back on his heels, and wraps him in the same hug he’d treated Dean to just a few minutes-years earlier.
The blanket lifts enough to reveal Dean’s eyes, lit by the dim light coming through the window curtains.  His voice is firm, commanding.  “Hold still, Cas.”
The thing about Heaven, the new one Jack built with Castiel’s help and advice, is that it really is perfect.  Once all the pieces are finally put in place.  The last one leans up on its human-shaped toes, and presses its lips against Dean’s sending a jolt of Castiel’s pure love and joy through him again.  It’s better than sex or pie, or sex followed by pie.  And yeah, he’s going to enjoy this for the rest of eternity.
“Great!  You just let me know if I need to take an extra long walk during my watch before making a move, alright?”  How Sam manages to sound disgusted and smug at the same time is a mystery.
Could he be the one to earn Dean’s love?  Not the love of family, or brotherhood, but that of a man and a lover.  Would he ever be able to bask in Dean’s love the way Cesar and Jesse bask in each other’s?
Unperturbed, Aaron grins and shrugs his shoulders.  “Yeah, but most ‘bot voices aren’t that sexy.  I’ll bet it’s awesome at dirty talk.”
It’s impossible to argue with him because Castiel would do the same if the situation were reversed.  And while he does want to strike out on his own, he doesn’t want to be completely cut off from everyone he knows.  He doesn’t even really want to cut himself off from Dean, and the ache inside his chest has been growing steadily worse since he left their shared bed.
She’s not pleased with his answer, but she doesn’t waste time arguing.  “Very well, then you may help hold him down.  You too, Sam.  I’ll need both of your strength if he wakes up.”
Shaking his head, he tries to focus on better memories.  The soft gold light as it reflected off his mother’s yellow hair, and the sound of her singing hymns while she moved about the kitchen.  The way her fingers felt in his hair when she ruffled it playfully and told him to behave so the angels watching over him could take a little break.
Smiling, Castiel gets up to get her a paper towel to clean her face with.  “If they can’t handle a few hours without the boss around, you should probably fire them.”
Castiel lifts one brow, and it shifts his whole demeanor from sweet and naive to what Dean would imagine a disapproving college professor looks like.  He never did college though, so all he’s got is porn to go from.
He’s also spent a lot of his free time working on his Impala, and she’s nearly done.  She’s actually road ready now, just waiting for the paint job that he’s putting off until his hands stop randomly trembling.  He hasn’t taken her out for a drive yet.  It doesn’t feel right with an empty passenger seat.  And the only people he wants to share that first experience with are either crippled and unable to bend his sasquatch frame into the front of the car, or on the other side of the damn country.  So she stays parked, and Dean tries not to see that as some kind of metaphor for his life.
“Shit!” He used his t-shirt to wipe his prints from the game. Then, he ducked and wiped off the register before he snuck through the store and out the back door. Another wipedown of the lock and doorknob, then Dean ran.
The smaller weapon glared daggers at him. Gabriel, looking hurt and pissed, walked off the mat with a huff. For once Kali followed his lead.
Seeing the small gap between Dean and Castiel disappear as they leaned closer to speak and listen was good progress. He paid for a rendition of
,” Dean answered with an evil smirk, causing Gabriel to laugh at the bitch-face Sam threw their way.
That was all Bobby had to say on the matter; they returned to the classic rock gently playing in the background.
The angel didn’t take the bait nor elaborate; he flicked his gaze over Dean once then returned to his watch. Dean went back to listening to Zepp, and he jammed out to ‘Kashmir’ while he could because Sam wasn’t awake to bitch about it.
“Of you being the Righteous Man,” Cas confessed. “The demons were celebrating your arrival, and I had been waiting for that moment since I was cast down. I will forever regret that I couldn’t get to you faster.” He swallowed back his guilt. “But, if I saw your soul on the rack, without that destiny tied to it, I would have tried to save you in any manner or way. Because a soul like yours never deserved Hell. You were only there because of an unnatural deal.”
a voice. Is that a standard feature with all angels,” she sidled in close, “or are you a showroom model?”
Dean looked back to see Castiel still holding up the demon like she weighed nothing. Castiel’s grip tightened, and she choked on a loud cough. He placed the palm of his other hand on her forehead. She writhed and screamed in pain as white light flooded from her eye sockets and open mouth. When the light disappeared, her eyes were burned out.
In a regular old vamp hunt sans angelic smiting, the only way the suckers was with decapitation, which meant Dean was in charge since Anna was a greenhorn. He could do this. Easily.
“What?” Dean said, leaning away from Castiel’s creepy lack of personal space. “We just going to stare longingly into each other’s eyes for the rest of the night?”
Castiel and Sam were a little slower moving, but as they got out of the car they gave each a slightly confused, slightly worried look.
Oh, things are about to get interesting, folks! How do you bring someone home to meet the family when they don't exist?
Sam's right hand stretched out towards the demons who had gone flying. His teeth and lips were bloody, and the black smoke that had disappeared was covering Sam’s skin with thickly waving tendrils. The same mist that had been on his skin during the Rugaru case--
Gabriel, on the other hand, seemed to believe that trying to disarm a bomb strapped to a obese man as he zoomed around a football stadium on a jetpack would’ve been easier.
Eileen studied him, confusion making her brow furrow when she couldn't work out his meaning. "That is weird,” she agreed. “Can’t you just…?” she mimed writing.
“Yes, I suppose we could,” Cas replied tentatively, not really looking forward to more alcohol. “Dean, I wanted to say thank you, for agreeing to try and work together.”
Instead of trying to explain, Sam carefully pocketed the card. Then, he sized them both up and asked warily, "So...now what?"
“You’re parents are in real trouble,” Castiel quietly observed as they started into the dark mine shaft.
The presence disappeared, and Sam opened his eyes to find Pamela blinking with a look of surprise on her face. “Bobby called that one,” she said, before patting Sam’s hand, trying to reassure him.
Cas said again, but this time the voice was echoing around inside Dean’s head. The hunter did not even have time to question how this was happening; his attention was on the murderous teacher inbound.
Just like the Impala, the music had been another of John’s hand-me-downs. Now, however, the Chevy was
“Thanks, doc, but I’m not feeling any better,” Dean tried to joke. “I’m going to clean this up, and sew up your leg,” Carlos warned.
Castiel flopped down next to him, his usual buttoned-down shirt pulled open and exposing his shoulder, where he placed an ice-pack. “You’re welcome.”
When she started to lower her arms, Cas stepped forward, blade ready. "I'm not going to hurt anyone. I don't even have my grace to make my blade--"
Sam cleaned up their trash; once done, he leaned forward so he could speak between them. He tilted his head from side to side. “Well, yes and no.” Dean could tell that he was winding himself up for a lengthy discussion. He eased the car back onto the highway as Sam began.
Dean leaned down so he could hear Cas’s filthy commentary without the whole world also hearing it. Though he had no idea what Cas was saying, it was still all manner of hot for his angel to lose control like this. Dean was the only one who got to see this side of Cas--it was a heady feeling.
Cas looked slightly less grumpy as he sat on the edge of their bed in nothing but a pair of pajama bottoms. A wet towel hung around his shoulders as he worked to dry his hair. The wrinkles he started to sport on his forehead smoothed out when he saw Dean had come bearing food.
Dean emerged with a faded t-shirt and some sweatpants. “Put these on, you’ll feel a ton better,” Dean said, tossing the ball of clothing to his roommate.
After the training session with Sid, both boys had no more class for the rest of the day. As they made their way along the worn brick paths, Dean was humming cheerfully to himself. Cas kept pace with the happy guy, finding his good mood contagious. He even started to smile. Even with the swelling cut above his eye and dried blood smeared on half his face, Dean couldn’t wipe the glowing grin from his face.
As far as lies went, it was probably the whitest one he’d ever told in his life. Like, newly fallen snow, white. And while he saw disappointment on Cas’s face, he also saw relief.
Taking a few steps forward, Cas stopped in front of Sam. “I understand why you were distrustful of me. But you must understand that I stood against Lucifer. Never for him. I was cast down because Heaven didn’t want me to help those that needed it. Yes, I had to kill some of my siblings, and I’m not proud of it. However, I would do it all again.”
Cas turned himself slightly from Dean to Sam, sensing which one was actually going to be helpful. “So, do all the songs just boil down to sex?”
Sid did pause for a moment. “A weapon is not just a gun, or a scythe, or a knife. It’s also a human consciousness. A human being that has the ability to store and deliver energy when needed, in fact. Like a living battery, you could say.”
“Oh, he tried to get his hands on it,” Virgil assures him.  “He talked long and hard about how he was the one who tracked White down.  But that Pinkerton fella set everybody right.  And he had White’s revolver.”
“Tell that to the law.” He grins and wraps an arm around her shoulders, pulling her tight against his side in a half-hug. “How’s things, Krissy?”
More gunshots fill the air among the staccato beat of a horse’s hooves on hard packed earth.  A single rider races toward the encampment.
“We’ll try whatever soaps you want, Cas.”  Dean reaches for a third bottle and grabs a washcloth to go with it.  He pours some of the liquid soap on the cloth and then holds it up near Castiel’s nose.  “This isn’t so sweet.”
The main reason PharmCos don’t actively manufacture this particular antidote is that it’s usually too late by the time the victim can access it.  If the blood lust isn’t sated quickly, their internal organs will start to shut down, but the antidote flushes the changed DNA from their system and reverses the changes if they get it fast enough.  As their body tries to expel their own altered cells from both ends of the digestive tract, it rips itself apart in the process. That’s why the antidote needs to be administered fast, before the disease affects too many systems, and it’s usually easier for doctors to feed the victims blood and let the transformation complete rather than curing it.
Dean obeys eagerly, straddling Castiel’s thighs on the rock ledge.  Castiel smiles up at him, appreciation gleaming like starlight in his eyes as his hands stroke Dean from knee to hip and back again.
Dean throws up his hands in despair.  “It’s still suicidal with three!” He flings one hand in Cas’ direction.  “That idiot at least has the excuse of ignorance--” Cas makes a noise of protest, but Dean ignores him, “--but you know better than anyone what we’re going up against here!”
And they don’t have to wait long.  Muriel returns quickly and requests that they follow her.  She leads them through familiar hallways.  Castiel keeps his eyes directly on the back of Muriel’s head.  If he glances at the doors lining their path and catches one open, he’s not sure he’ll be able to continue this mission.
Dean broke that promise.  Again and again, even when Sam asked, begged him to do it.  Sammy has been his responsibility since he was barely more than a baby himself.  And he took it far more seriously than John probably meant for him to.
The hunt for the shifter only kept them away from home for about two days, but it feels more like two weeks.  He may be less than a quarter through his expected lifespan, but right now he feels old as fuck for wishing he didn’t have to leave home so often for work.  That doesn’t pay him.  Jesus, his life is a shit show.
Castiel doesn’t quite understand the purpose of the game, but he’s got an account because Dean wanted him to try it.  This will be the first time he’s signed on without one of the Winchesters to accompany him, but he believes he has enough of a grasp on the system that he should be able to navigate it without them.
That earns him a soft laugh.  “I would advise against it.  I’m not sure how many of them are demons.”
Sam smiles, wondering how much longer he’ll have to nag before Gabriel finally caves in and gets corrective lenses.
The gratitude makes Dean squirm anyway.  He shifts in his seat, and grabs a napkin, peeling it into strips to keep his hands busy.  “For what?”
Maybe he should keep tamping down those kinds of feelings, but right now it doesn’t seem as important to avoid emotional ties as it had seemed yesterday.
Boy was he wrong.  He’s about to be seeing a whole lot more of Castiel Jameson, and not in the fun way.  At least until he can come up with a foolproof escape plan.
Crossroads is a larger town half an hour north, and it’s where Purgatory’s residents go when they need anything that isn’t carried at the local mercantile.  Castiel hasn’t been there yet, but everyone has told him that’s the place to go.  “How about we go tomorrow?” he suggests.  “I don’t have work, and--Dean?  What’s wrong?”
“Alright,” he says gruffly as he sits up and pushes the car door open.  “Enough sitting in this damn car.”
“He’s not completely wrong,” Sam agrees.  “But we’re stronger together than apart.  I’m not going to let him leave me behind.  Not when Alistair is more of a danger to Dean than to me.”
Castiel tilts his head into the touch, as he’s observed Dean doing whenever Castiel fingercombs his hair.  He feels the pressure of Dean’s fingers against his scalp and wonders what it is about the touch that pleases the human so much when he’s on the receiving end.  “I’m only glad because you found me.  I find the idea of being powered down forever in a waste facility disturbing, and if it had been someone else to find, they may not have been as understanding of my request to retain my current software configuration.”
Dean is pulling the garage doors down over the bays when Castiel gets there.  The sound of his bike’s motor catches Dean’s attention, and he smiles over his shoulder as Castiel pulls into the gravel in front of the shop.  He has both doors closed and is walking over just as Castiel turns the engine off.  Castiel barely has time to dismount before Dean catches him around the waist and pulls him close for a hello kiss.
The sappy confession is nearly as good as the three little words Dean can’t bring himself to utter yet.  He places his hand over Castiel’s, lacing their fingers together.  “Me too, Cas.”
“Because I like to be pretty, duh,” Gabriel answers flippantly.  “Not all of us can be hot studs like you, buddy.”
The faint ripple of a girl’s laughter carries on the warm night breeze.  It comes from the east end of the main cabin, along with a voice Castiel recognizes.
Castiel watches the man up on stage, sees all the feeling he pours into the lyrics as the song wraps up.  He’d already guessed that Dean carried the weight of trauma on his shoulders, a weight that he doesn’t seem eager to share.  Which Castiel can understand, probably better than anyone else in Dean’s life.
“I don’t know what she wants, and at the moment I don’t give a shit,” Castiel grinds out.  He takes a deep breath, expelling it slowly with his eyes closed.  His shoulders sink as the tension eases from them, and he looks calm when he opens his eyes again.  His gaze finds Dean, and he smiles warmly.  “I’m glad you’re here.”
Jo waves him away, completely undeterred.  “If the sex isn’t going to be good, they might as well give up before they get started.”
“By the way,” he says to Cesar, “I heard you have another mare that looks like Baby?  I’d love to see how she rides.”
Besides, he’s accustomed to his current appearance, and the eyes he has now are perfectly functional.
“Are you ready?” When Castiel doesn’t receive an answer, he goes looking for Dean in their bedroom.  Dean has one of the duffel bags they’d packed last night open, and is stuffing another stack of clothing in there.  “I think you’ve got enough flannels Dean.”
“De nada, señor.” She settles back in her seat, but watches until he bites into the dough-wrapped meat.  She smiles proudly and nods her approval when he moans around the delicious morsel.
Sam nods.  “He’s not as sneaky as he thinks he is, and if I really wanted to keep him out of those records, he wouldn’t even know they existed.”
Dean has wrapped his arms around Castiel before.  He knows what it feels like to hold him while he’s injured, and what it feels like to carry his lifeless vessel.  And he knows what it feels like to hug him, to bask in the relief of having the angel back when he thought he’d lost him, to greet him after a long separation, to catch him in his arms when Castiel throws himself at Dean.
“Whoa, buddy.” Dean lets go of Castiel’s hand and instead grabs both his shoulders and with unexpected strength pulls Castiel to face him.  “Those are figures of speech.  He’s saying that I think you’re sexy and it might drive me a little bit crazy to see you half naked.”
Guilt over that certainly isn’t helping Dean shut his brain off so he can go the fuck to sleep.  When they were younger it was easy to jump straight from one hunt to another for weeks on end, but despite modern technology keeping them relatively young for at least the first century of their lives, they’re both too old for that shit now.  And if he’s feeling all 44 of his years, Sam can’t be feeling that great either.
Dean snorts as he turns the key in the ignition.  “Maybe her brain, but not her heart.”  He twists in his seat, latching an arm over the seat so he can watch where he’s going as he backs out of the parking space. “She has a huge crush on Sammy, and she only likes me because she hopes he’ll either be with me, or I’ll talk about him.”  Once they’re on the road again, he slants a wicked grin in Castiel’s direction.  “I don’t think she knew my preferences until just now.”
“I know it’s not the same for you,” he says, cutting Castiel off.  “But this is for me too, okay?  Just let me do this.  Please.”
A large kitchen with a stone fireplace and oven dominates the center of the house, with several rooms built around it.  The largest is a dining room, with one end designated for relaxing after a meal by the overstuffed chairs tucked into a circle in the far corner.  The rest of the room is filled with a long table with many chairs.  The furnishings are simple, but well cared for and appear comfortable.
He’s still trying to decide whether he should confront Dean now or if he should wait until they’re done when Pamela’s giggling trails off.  His ears strain for any clue as to what they’re doing, but all he can hear is the indistinct murmur of their voices.
Well that’s interesting.  Dean doesn’t drop his hand yet.  “Awesome.  Care to share with the class?”
“You have to live, Dean.  You have to.”  He lifts his head, and caresses Dean’s bearded cheek.  He softly brushes his cool lips against Dean’s fevered ones.  “I can’t lose you.”
One gun swings around and gets shoved in Dean’s face when he starts to stand.  “Ah, ah.  No sudden moves, Winchester.”  Kubrick’s grin is all pearly white teeth and malice.  “Or do whatever.  No one will bat an eye if I shoot you in an escape attempt.”
For long moments Alistair simply looks at him.  Castiel doesn’t flinch or look away, forcing himself to meet his gaze squarely, steadily, hiding the fear that claws its way into his throat.
Castiel frowns at the bite in her voice.  When he’d first come to Purgatory she’d been gung-ho about getting him in bed with Dean, but as the weeks have passed, she’s started to get short with them.  He’s beginning to think she might be a little jealous of Dean’s attention, but he hasn’t brought it up yet because he doesn’t want to rock the boat.  And Dean has never indicated that they’re anything more than close friends with a sibling dynamic.
Wordlessly, Dean pulls on his shirt and mounts the Appaloosa.  Castiel mounts his own horse, wincing as he slips his bare feet into the stirrups.  But he doesn’t have time to regret Sam’s inability to find his boots.
Sliding his arm around Castiel’s hips, Dean gives her a smile dripping with smug satisfaction.  “And I’m keeping him.”
That makes him feel a little better.  It hadn’t even occurred to him that he was afraid Castiel would want to go back until Jody put it into words.  “So are you going to tell me what you mean, or not?”
“Cas,” Dean hisses, low and urgent.  “I don’t think it’s a good idea for him to go poking around in your head, man.”
“What the--Cas what are you doing?” Sam stops moving, but he doesn’t back away from the imposter.  The hand not holding a flashlight moves toward the gun holster under his jacket.
That earns him a bark of laughter and the light comes back to Dean’s eyes.  “Yeah okay, I saw you earlier.  You’ve got some moves.”
Ellen glances up from the clipboard. “Is that it?” she asks as she checks something off on her notepad.
Strong fingers continue to press against the back of his head and neck, and Castiel falls silent.  The massage is wonderful, relaxing him in all the best ways, although he can tell that the migraine will only rage back up once the touch disappears.
“So you were a virgin?”  It’s a stupid question.  He knows it’s a stupid question.  But Dean just can’t wrap his head around this new information.  He surges to his feet and paces away from the fire, running fingers through his hair as the knowledge of what he’d done really sinks in.
A shiver jolts Dean out of his sleep, and he blinks into the darkness.  At some point he’d kicked off the blankets, and he tugs them back over his shoulder and then scoots backwards in search of Castiel’s body heat.  He scooches a little more.  And a little more.
Being here, with Dean, is definitely making him happy.  Thinking about introducing him to his family, his friends, that makes the warm glow in his heart go up a few degrees.
Frowning, Castiel looks down and lifts his shirt away, twisting so he can get a look at the damage.  There’s several inches of skin that are scraped raw, although at least it looks like the bleeding has stopped.
But when he catches himself sliding his fingers along Castiel’s clavicle and up his throat with the intention of pulling him in for a kiss, Dean jerks away.  Legs that feel like jello refuse to cooperate with him, and he slumps against the nearest building.  The cold surface feels good against his increasingly warm skin, and he presses both shoulders into it.
Something shifts in his head, and he finally gets what Sam has been trying to tell him for years.  It’s just… a hangup.  Anyone who cares about him, won’t care about his specific flavor of crazy.  And it’s not like no one has figured out the PTSD thing, even though he never made an official announcement.  His friends aren’t stupid, but sometimes he is, and he should really stop acting like a dumbass and just man up.
“Huh, okay,” Sam says, unsure how to address his brother’s prickly attitude without knowing its cause.
The ache blooms behind his eyes too, and his vision blurs.  He rubs the tears away with the back of his hand and tries to maintain his smile, although it feels wobbly on his lips.  “Thank you, Gabriel.”
After he fills the water flasks, he pulls off his shirt and folds it neatly, placing it on a higher rock where it won’t get wet, and sets his hat on top of it.  Then he squats down and scoops water into his hands.  It’s cool and refreshing and splashing it over his face and hair does more to wake him up than the strongest coffee Sam could brew.  Gasping, he repeats the motion until his hair drips into his eyes and his skin pebbles from the chill.
To his delight, she’s there today.  Of course she’s fixing something again.  The place belongs to an elderly married couple who don’t invest a lot of money into the place because they’re saving up to retire in a bigger city, so the place isn't in great condition.  Luckily Eileen is friendly with them, and is handy with machines, so they spare enough money to pay her for the repairs.
“What if you don’t make it back?” he demands.  And then his expression darkens.  “I won’t come after you.”
“We can’t talk about it like this,” Chuck says when he turns his attention back to Castiel.  “Can you come for a visit?”
Castiel has seen death before.  First his parents, which he had accepted with a child’s innocence, and then many years later his brother, mutilated by his killers and further decayed by the time it took for Castiel to collect his body.  He’s encountered dead victims in his work as a detective, and in his hunt for Alistair has been directly responsible, and present, for the hanging of the gang members that were with the demon when he murdered Emmanuel.
“I was thinking I’d start out by taking a nap,” Castiel says.  “I didn’t get very much sleep last night, and it has been a fairly busy day.”
“I ended up getting charges pressed against the guy who sold him the fireworks,” Jody tells Castiel.  “Since Dean was a minor and shouldn’t have gotten his hands on them in the first place.”
Castiel takes a different approach.  He steps up beside Dean and touches the back of his hand.  “Please, Dean.  This isn’t how I want to talk to him.”
Dean stops and turns to face him, frowning in annoyed confusion.  “Then let’s get going.  It ain’t going to get any cooler out here.”
Eventually instead of another kiss, they tip their foreheads together and just breathe.  Castiel smells like mineral water, clean and fresh over the heat of his skin.  Dean wants to bury his nose against Castiel’s throat and immerse himself in his scent.
As much as he hates to admit it, Dean understands.  And he should have seen it coming, since Sam had gone through the same phase when he became an adult.  Hell, Dean probably would have gone through it too if their parents hadn’t died and left him to take care of Sammy on his own.  It’s completely normal for anyone to want to flex their grown up muscles out in the world.
He refrains from warning Dean that he’s still pissed at him.  There’s no time.  He practically runs to the bunker’s kitchen where they keep supplies specifically for this kind of thing.  With Charlie’s help, Sam had broken into the databases of several pharmaceutical companies and downloaded the formulas for as many antidotes as he could find.  They’re supposed to only be available to hospitals, but the costs are astronomical and it’s easier to create his own than run up medical bills under shaky aliases.
Even though the dome over the city should be illuminated with synthetic early morning sunlight, the narrow streets leading to Gabriel’s shop are still dark as midnight as Castiel navigates them.  The headlight of Sam's motorcycle occasionally reveals people scuttling away from the wide beam, sometimes betraying inhuman eyes with colorful reflections before they disappear back into the shadows.  Castiel pays them little mind as long as they continue to retreat from his presence.
He thinks Sam is with them.  Castiel incorporates it into his lies to keep Dean calm.  “He’s ridden on ahead to mark the trail.”
“Did you do this?” James demands of Dean, then aiming his accusing glare at Sam.  “You can’t mess with their programming or you can end up with some serious problems.  How did you get through the security protocols on his OS?”
“Sorry, not the most romantic spot for this kind of thing,” Dean mumbles against Castiel’s shoulder.
He asks it casually, as if the answer doesn’t really matter to him.  Castiel smiles bitterly.  “You make it sound so simple.”
Dean snatches the pack from her fingers before she has a chance to register his movements.  He pulls out a cigarette and wedges it between his lips before handing it back to her.  “I’m gonna need a light,” he says around it as he loops an arm over her shoulders and guides her toward the back exit where there’s also a sign advertising a smoking area.  As if the air inside the club wasn’t already thick with more than just the output of the smoke machines in the corners of the room.  But part of the hunt is separating the prey from the pack, and getting her outside is more important than the nonexistent air quality of their destination.
Dean almost opens his mouth right then and there to confess everything that is in his heart.  But the weight of the stares from their audience of two keeps him silent.  It’s not that he doesn’t want them to know.  He’ll gladly shout it from the rooftops.  But not the first time.  That moment should belong to Castiel alone.
That’s the problem with friends, he thinks irritably.  They know he isn’t going to deliver on the silent promise of violence.  For the briefest moment he misses being in the military where people jumped to obey his orders.  His squad eventually figured out his bark was harsher than his bite, but at least they’d still followed orders and backed off at any hint of his scowls.
Castiel doesn’t have access to most of his past, but he does have a few days of memory from before he was sent to Naomi’s office for maintenance for the last time.  When she told him that she didn’t have patience for his malfunctions anymore, and shut him down in preparation for what he assumed would be another master reset.  His clients during that short period of time were demanding and unkind, getting worse when he questioned or denied them anything.
Once again Castiel feels like he’s been left behind in the conversation.  “I can handle myself quite well, I assure you.”
“Good.  They seem like okay dudes.” Mostly they seem weird and eccentric, and he’s not sure it’s a good idea to put a lot of trust in them.  But for Castiel’s sake he’ll give them a chance.  He’s given actual cannibalistic monsters the same opportunities, and usually it doesn’t come back to bite him in the ass, literally or otherwise.
Eventually the conversation picks up, but everyone keeps it casual and easy.  It’s nice sharing a meal with his family, even though Castiel’s absence makes his chest ache.
The crowd roars with approval as competitors enter the field for the Grand Melee, drowning out Sam’s chuckle.  He waits for it to quiet down and for Charlie to confirm the battle’s start with a wave of acknowledgement before he speaks again.  “Your message indicated you have news. Is it safe to discuss publicly?”
Castiel’s irises spin again, tightening the pupil to a black point in the center.  “They’re going to grow me a biological body.”
Without pulling away from the kiss, Dean lifts the hand holding his beer, middle finger held up in defiance.
Castiel wakes to the sound of rain drumming on the roof and pattering against the bedroom window.  He blinks a few times in the gloom, and turns his head on the pillow, unsurprised to find Dean gone already.  He’s not alone in the bed though.  Lore is curled in a soft ball on Dean’s pillow, snoring softly.
The weight of the man’s gaze fastens on him once more and the Marshal realizes he’d heard every word.  “Yes of course,” he says softly, almost as an afterthought.
The water is much colder than he’d anticipated, but it feels exhilarating and cleansing.  He bathes quickly though, unwilling to stay in the bone chilling water any longer than necessary.  Dirt and sweat and the smell of horses sluices from his pebbled skin, and he dunks himself one more time to rinse off.
With a gentle touch, he pulls lightly at the skin of Cas’ bottom, checking for needles.  There are a few pinkening spots where he appears to have gotten a light poke, but the denim of his pants was enough to protect him from the worst of it.  Still though, he runs the pads of his fingers lightly over the flesh to make sure there aren’t any needles that he can’t see.
He nods thoughtfully, and then pushes a button to start the machine.  Leaning a hip against it, he signs as he speaks.  “Bobby at the motel mentioned rock climbing too.”
It’s that trust that unlocks something in Dean that he’s kept sealed away for a long long time.  He spends the rest of the ride back to the ranch wondering if he’ll ever be able to lock it away again.
Sighing again, he reaches for the soap and lathers himself up quickly.  Sam will be here soon, and as much as Castiel has come to enjoy his company, right now he’d rather not feel the weight of Sam’s pitying looks.  He moves mechanically through a wash and rinse, and is toweling himself dry by the time Sam makes it to the bathroom to take his own shower.
That seems to catch the android by surprise, and seriously each time his expression changes Dean is transported to Uncanny Valley.  “You would give me the choice?”
Ah god, there he goes pulling all the right strings.  Sometimes Dean hates that Sam has him all figured out, knows exactly how to get him to drop his convictions like hot potatoes.
“Castiel, god…” Dean buries his face against Cas’ throat and revels in the solid body writing beneath him.  Hands, uncallused but not soft, need Dean’s shoulders, his back, the globes of his ass.  He moves under their silent command, rolling his hips against Castiel’s.
“You’re accurate with your arm extended,” Dean argues calmly.  “You need to learn to shoot from the hip.”  He draws his gun again, but not at full speed.
A flush rises up in Dean’s cheeks, giving his skin a healthier hue.  “Gee, Cas, are those my only options?”
“These might be a little short on you,” Dean says when he comes out of his room holding a bundle of cloth.  His eyes drop to Castiel’s thighs.  “You’re, uh…”
He pulls himself onto Baby’s back, and they continue their trek up the mountain, following the trail until it disappears over some loose shale.  Just past midday he picks it up again.  They’re headed south.
At first Castiel can’t see him through the golden glare of sunlight on the water.  His eyes trace slowly over the rocks at the bank and the dense trees behind them.  No movement gives him away, but Castiel’s eyes finally catch on the figure crouched low on the bank, his appearance as sudden as if he’d materialized there.
Thinking of what could be worse than death makes him think of his brother.  The condition of Emmanuel’s body when Castiel arrived to fetch him. Before he died, Emmanuel suffered greatly.  And Castiel nearly suffered the same fate.
Dean huffs an almost laugh.  “Yeah, pretty much.”  He checks the load and the safety, and turns it handle first to Castiel.  “This is in case shit hits the fan.  And don’t shoot one of us, alright?”
Shaking away his horny daze, Dean holds up his oily hands.  “I just need to take care of this, and grab a few things before we go.”
By the time he’s finished changing and returned to the horses tied in front of the mercantile, Dean is there with Sam, waiting for him.
As I was reading through the next few chapters of Feels Like Home to plan out the upcoming adaptations, I came across one of my author's notes talking about how I'm kind of a beast about cliffhangers and... yeah still true 7 years later lol
When he lifts his head, Castiel stares up at him in a daze.  Dean grins, and this time it feels like he means it.  “Something to keep you warm at night while you’re gone,” he teases.
Dean shivers in the boiling heat of the noon-day sun.  He knew it, but having it confirmed doesn’t exactly cheer him up.  “And his men?  There must be at least a dozen of them.”  And how many are possessed?
There’s another stretch of silence, and the pounding in his chest becomes almost painful.  It’d be just his luck if this conversation triggers an anxiety attack.  Not being able to see Castiel while he waits for his answer makes things worse, and he wishes he’d gone to the motel to have this conversation in person.
Long suppressed curiosity has Castiel scouring his brain for excuses to repeat the act.  He deliberately avoids thinking of the way Dean held him afterwards.  The warmth of his skin and the steady beat of his heart against Castiel’s chest.  And the throb of yearning in his chest whenever his thoughts skirt close to the memory.
He moves from the windshield to the Impala’s hood, humming along with the bouncy Taylor Swift song playing loudly from the speakers on his work bench on the far side of the garage.  A thought turns up the volume.  Maybe if it’s louder he’ll be able to take the song’s message to heart and finally shake it off.
“Twice, actually.  College is fucking hard, and exhausting, and… stims are easy to get your hands on.” Sam admits.  The smile he directs at his hands in his lap is bitter. “First time in rehab didn’t stick because I didn’t really want to be there… but Dean… he wouldn’t give up on me, and he got me enrolled again after my second crash and burn.  He signed up for an extra deployment so that he could pay for it, and he made sure I had everything I needed.  So even though painkillers weren’t my drug of choice, I’m trying to be careful with them.” His voice goes soft, almost too low for Castiel to hear.  “I don’t want to disappoint him again after everything he did for me.”
The warning causes a stab of something near Castiel’s heart.  Betrayal, certainly.  And something more delicate that he refuses to examine.  “I guess I’d better not get lost then,” he replies stiffly.
“That’s not even my--” Castiel cuts off.  He stops and glares up at Winchester, getting a lazy grin in return.
“My pole, my fish!” Dean insists as he comes up next to Castiel.  He grins in greeting and nudged him in the side with an elbow.  “Back me up, Cas.”
Before either of them moves toward the train’s exit he reaches for her hand, and presses a folded handkerchief into her palm.  “Adiós, señorita.”  Without waiting for a reply he makes his way to the front of the car where other passengers are disembarking.  He steps down and finds someone to provide directions.
“Hey,” Dean finally snaps, getting a sliver of pleasure when Aaron’s smirk is immediately replaced with slack jawed shock.  “Castiel isn’t just a sex toy.  He’s my friend, and you should treat him with respect.”
“I’ll be fine,” Dean says firmly.  He will be because he has to.  He’ll take his pills if he needs to.  This is an emergency.
Dean shakes his head at the old-fashioned concept.  “Is that all you are to him?  A family breeding machine?”
Now, with Cas, that deeper need surfaces, overriding everything but this one.  To lose himself in the oblivion of Cas’ passion.  To maybe purge himself of the devils always hiding just below his skin, and perhaps ease some of the pain of loneliness that he’s carried with him for so long.
Remembering the instructions Dean and Benny had given him while they formulated their plan, Castiel pulls his attention away from the man in front of him and starts looking around.
“We need coffee beans as well,” Castiel says as he pours himself a mug of water and joins Dean at the table.  “And what do you think about getting chickens?  You and Sam eat enough eggs to justify it, and there’s room in the greenhouse.”
With that resolve in mind he places his lips over Dean’s and blows.  Immediately he senses a problem when air escapes Dean’s nose.  He pinces it shut, and tries again.  This time there’s a faint rise of Dean’s chest.  Heartened, Castiel does it again.
So when he was well enough to check himself out of the hospital, he’d done so while his parents were not around to talk him out of it, and he’d left Boston behind a few days later.
“Hmm, I’m enjoying how fiesty you are,” Boris breathes against Dean’s face, reeking of old blood.  He smiles widely and a second row of needle sharp teeth slip down from his gums.  “You’ll be an excellent addition to my family.”
He’s slipping, the current dragging him down.  The flesh of his palm is torn by gnarled roots, and even his blood is cold.
Working from home means pajamas as a uniform.  There’s a lot of advice against it; stuff about “getting into a professional mindset” by “dressing like you’re going to the office” and other bullshit that probably works for others, but Castiel doesn’t subscribe to those notions.  Especially not before he’s on his third cup of coffee, and even then, why dirty another set of clothing? He
Castiel frowns, unsure where this hostility is coming.  But he gestures at the mule tethered with his own horse at the other end of the corral. "Maybe it's packed with Samuel's belongings…"
He let’s Dean go, but doesn’t move away, instead dragging his food closer so they can eat while standing shoulder to shoulder.  Eventually they’re going to have to stop acting like they’re attached at the… everything, but Dean is going to enjoy this closeness for as long as it lasts.
Castiel had found an entry about them in John’s journal.  Men who could shift into animals just by wearing cloaks made of their skins.  It’s too fantastical to be true, but the creatures moving around down there are too intelligent to be mere animals.
His lips twist in a wry smile as he pulls on his helmet.  He’s probably a coward for riding away, but he’s stayed long enough.  It’s time to go.
Dean catches him, and all but carries him to the edge of the meadow.  He finds a downed tree and straddles it, and cradles Cas against him. When Cas presses closer, hiding his face against Dean’s neck, Dean runs his fingers through his hair.  Cas’ hat had been knocked free during the skirmish, and Dean attempts to tame the spiked strands. They’re silky against his fingertips.
Castiel turns his head to look at Dean, adjusting his visual zoom so that his features are not blurry from so close.  “I don’t understand.”
“Still, I do apologize,” Cas says, smiling wider now, but slipping a piece of bacon between his teeth before continuing while he chews.  “I’m just very hungry.  And this is very good.”
If Cas presses his lips together any harder, they’ll fuse together.  Despite his displeasure, he nods.
It doesn’t take them long to get back into sync though.  Dean rides Castiel hard, grinding down and forward.  Castiel concentrates on giving Dean back a little of his own medicine by teasing him with uneven strokes.
“Cas you don’t have to-”  He’s cut off when Castiel cups a palm over his mouth, and he has to resist the childish urge to lick his hand in retaliation.
Castiel’s brows come together, and he actually looks hurt by Sam’s words.  “I didn’t leave Dean alone.  He left me, and I followed the parameters of the mission as he set them.  Should I have disobeyed?  My understanding is that you don’t approve when I don’t follow the orders I’ve been given.”
She directs a worried look at her husband.  “He’s stable,” she answers.  “But it will take some time before they know how bad the damage is.” She pulls away from Castiel and sits in the chair next to the bed again, lifting Michael’s limp hand in her own as she speaks.  “They’re observing him right now to make sure he doesn’t have another stroke.”
He has tried to avoid confronting it, unwilling to accept that his hunt would end this way.  But bitterness and fear twist deep inside him, and he faces the reality that he’ll end up dead at Alistair’s hand, just as Emmanuel did.
Technically fishing is an activity, but he hasn’t caught anything since he got lucky with the first two.  The second fish had been too small to keep, but the first is still alive on a hook chain in a small pool nearby, swishing its tail languidly.  Castiel would have released it too, but Sam and Dean fish for food.  Every once in a while he glances at the large golden trout with a frown of apology, but he is still looking forward to the fish fry Dean has planned for later.
“I thought you were dead, my friend,” Cesar says over the ruckus of his family.  He’s smiling, but there’s concern in his dark eyes.
The wound on his leg terrifies Castiel.  The bleeding had stopped after the first day, just as Dean said it would.  The tourniquet had been removed already, replaced with thickly padded bandages.
Castiel’s hand comes to rest again on his thigh, its warm weight a comfort.  “How did you end up with them? Are they family?”
Of course there could be something much more seriously wrong with the android besides its lack of power, as Sam has been pointedly reminding him since he brought it home.  Dean’s not too worried though.  He knows how to handle a malfunctioning bot.  It’s his damn job, after all.
“Oh my god, whatever,” Gabriel laughs as he rises to his feet.  “I’m getting a summoning from some other players.  You wanna go questing with me?”
Since Dean doesn’t seem to have noticed he’s awake, Castiel spends a long moment drinking his fill of the man’s dishevelled appearance.  He doubts the opportunity will present itself again soon, if at all.
He can’t say it out loud.  But they know, so further explanation is unnecessary.  He watches dully as Sam takes the journal and scans the page.  If he thinks anything about the blood, he doesn’t show any outward reaction.
He hears a grumbled insult at his back, and he only refrains from laughing because he needs to save his breath for the rest of the climb.
The man had arrived in El Paso ten days ago, and the Marshal still doesn’t know anything about him other than what he can observe.  The man is tall and fit.  And probably rich to boot if the fine cloth and cut of his suit is any indication.  Somehow the man’s clothing is still immaculate, without a spec of the dust that clings to everything in the desert town.  His dark hair is combed neatly, his jaw clean shaven.  And he’s got a stare that can cut a man down to size.  Everything about the man says he’s a pampered city slicker, but that hard stare tells another story.
Naomi ignores his insolence and pauses only for a breath before continuing her tirade.  “And of course, it’s moving West that killed your dear brother.”
“They appear to be miners,” Sam says quietly, taking care not to let his voice carry.  “Although as far as the Apache are concerned, they’re nothing but trespassers.”
Castiel lifts his head, peering at Dean through the sunglasses still perched on his face.  His breath catches in his throat when he sees the way Dean is looking at him.  His eyes are wide, and he’s chewing his bottom lip hard enough that it’ll probably be red and swollen from the abuse when he finally stops.  He looks
Dean sighs.  He’s too tired to have this conversation, but he’s also too tired to fend it off.  “We’re fine, Sam.”
He watches Castiel until he disappears amid the milling crowd, and then he stares down at the empty bottle in his hand, turning it and picking at the handwritten label with his thumbnails.  There’s a goofy grin playing across his lips, but he can’t stop it.  He has a much better buzz from hanging out with Castiel than he’s ever gotten from a beer.
As they gain the crest of the hill, he looks down to where Sam has been leading them.  The smoke is more distinct now, and his eyes widen at the sight before him.
“Okay, so who’s the other kid? I swear I’m getting this weird ass déjà vu thing going on with that kid,” Rufus mumbled under his breath.
“Mind if we sit?” Gabriel asked, and even though the booth was full, everyone shifted over to allow Gabriel on one side and Kali on the other.
The other students, who had been stunned into silence, now started to murmur amongst themselves. Sid shook his head as he came forward, helping the weapon up from the floor.
The kishin-egg whipped around and lunged forward, it’s snapping jaws full of jagged teeth going for Sam’s exposed neck. He ducked low and used its momentum against it. With the shield, he carried the kishin over his body and slammed it into the ground behind him, stunning it for a few precious seconds. Sam whipped around and showed Ruby downward, plunging the knife into the kishin’s chest. He twisted it for good measure, and ripped the blade back out savagely.
Sam might have been weaponless but he wasn’t powerless. Like all meisters, he was faster, stronger, and tougher than normal humans; even without being connected to his weapons for a boost, he was still agile enough to weave through the kishin-eggs. Any that tried to lay a hand (or claws, or tentacles, or any sort of appendage in general) found themselves stabbed through with Dean’s Angel Blade or shot by Kali.
His older brother closed his mouth but continued to sulk. Ignoring Dean, Sam wrote on a new page for a moment. Then, he ripped out and handed Eileen and Cas their own lists of items.
Dean and Sam turned back to find a possessed chef barreling towards them, eyes black and lips curled in an inhuman snarl. Sam pulled out the demon-killing knife and Dean ducked down, grabbing the man as he went by and shoving him into the back of their booth. The guy fell onto his back with a loud thud, which allowed Sam to drive the knife into his stomach before he could recover.
“Kali, can I borrow your phone? I need to google something,” Sam said. Kali looked suspiciously at the meister but ended up handing her phone over anyway.
He dug out his trusty Zippo and caught the shirt on fire. As the fire curled up into the bloody fabric, he forced a chuckle. “If I had a nickel for every fire I’ve had to set in the last month, I’d have three nickels. Weird it’s happened so many times. I swear, I’m not a pyromaniac.”
Dean was distracted from explaining a vibrating bed and why it was the BEST thing since complimentary continental breakfast by...candles. There were lit candles everywhere, on every flat surface, casting the entire cabin in a soft glow and gently flickering shadows. With the rain still gently falling on the roof, the entire room became cozy.
It was familiar, walking, feeling the weight of a heavy backpack on his shoulders and the uneven ground under his feet as he left the main roadway and headed into the foothills. He was used to walking to get to places; John wasn’t exactly a man who ferried his kid around like a soccer mom. Sam had learned early in life walking was usually the fastest (and only) way to get anywhere, whether it was a grocery store or laundromat or local bar.
The shadow monster turned around slightly, eyes narrowed in annoyance, which turned to complete surprise as the Angel Blade stabbed it right between the eyes.
“To get our coats, obviously. What else would a young man and woman be doing in there?” Kali said simply, but there was a hint of mischief in her eyes.
“Rule Number 3: Watch out for Jo. I mean that in both a ‘watch out for her wellbeing’ and ‘watch out for her’ period. She’s a worse hustler than Rufus. She’ll bat her eyelashes and you’ll suddenly find yourself dressed up in a pink dress with flowers in your hair.”
“Oh, come on! I’ve got the wonder kid who beat me at poker. Me. At Poker!” Dean said, motioning to Castiel. “He’ll clean out the entire Strip with that stoic face. Come on, Sam, you’re too straight-laced for this assignment!”
Dean grips Castiel’s shoulder and dips his head to pin Castiel with his gaze.  “Hey, don’t give up yet.”
He never breaks eye contact with Dean, but his head tilts down and he gazes up through his eyelashes.  The only thing that could make Castiel’s expression look even more bashful would be a blush.
While he was sitting in jail, again, he'd had a lot of time to think.  Mostly he'd imagined creative forms of revenge to take on the Pinkerton agent, but he'd also spent restless hours mourning the loss of the Appaloosa.  There wouldn't be time to turn his meager funds into the several hundred dollars he'd need to buy her back before Cas dragged both of their asses out of town, and stealing her definitely wouldn't be an option.  Not with Cas hounding his heels.
Sam swings around from where he’s working on unsaddling his horse.  Dean can feel the disapproval radiating from him, and he knows he’s probably in for a lecture.  The surge of guilt he feels is quickly subsumed by annoyance.
“I still prefer to handle cases closer to the office rather than field assignments at this time,” Castiel reminds him.
And if everything else that has happened since Dean powered Castiel on hadn’t been blowing his mind already, that simple statement would definitely have his gray matter shooting out of his ears.  Like seriously, what the fuck kind of asshole would program a sex bot AI to think it’s a real boy?  That just seems cruel.  Not to mention it probably weirds out the clients.  It’s definitely weirding out Dean.
The barkeep pulls out a fresh bottle and pours a substantial amount into a tumblr which he sets in front of Castiel, then puts down the bottle next to it.  Castiel shoots back the first drink, keeping a bland mask in place despite the burn, and meets the barkeep’s gaze.  The man’s mouth twitches into an impressed smile, but he remains silent.
Sam’s words are cut off when Dean roughly nudges him with an elbow.  “Dude, nuh uh,” Dean says with a glare for his brother and a quick glance at Castiel.
Blinking up at him, Dean searches Castiel’s face, as if looking for the answer in his expression.  His tongue darts out to wet his lips, and his voice is barely above a whisper.  “What do you say, Cas?  Want to come back to Wyoming with me and build a home?”
His father nods, but doesn’t answer verbally.  Castiel feels a pang of guilt for his irritation.  Michael is going through a lot right now, and the least Castiel can do is set aside his own issues for now.
Castiel lifts his head from Dean’s chest and looks around to see that he is indeed surrounded.  Sam, Chuck, and Jimmy are all grinning at him and his lips peel back from his own teeth in response.  He’s surprised to find Amara hovering at the foot of his bed as well.  Her smile is softer, fond.  A reaction he wouldn’t have expected from her, but he supposes that he’s sharing an experience with her that no one else has before.  When their eyes meet she winks, and pressure boils up inside him until he’s laughing again, even as his eyes blur.
It’s unpleasant, but nothing some food and at least three cups of coffee can’t cure.  With a groan he forces his muscles to push him onto his feet.  He shuffles out of his room, pausing when he sees that Castiel’s door is still open, but the android’s bed is empty, wrinkles smoothed from the blankets and pillows fluffed up against the headboard.  A closed book sits on the bed, front cover down.
They share a long look, and Castiel doesn’t know if they’re communicating on a private channel or just through eye contact.  But eventually Jimmy nods, and Chuck smiles, and Castiel knows that a decision has been made.
“I don’t understand,” Castiel says, looking back at Dean with a confused head tilt.  “Isn’t junk by definition useless?  Why would someone want to trade for it?”
And Castiel will give him that the next time they’ve got access to proper lube.  For now, he retreats and slides his cock down until it slides between Dean’s thighs and bumps up against the back of his balls.
“I believe the fact that you’re even considering the possibility yourself is a pretty good sign,” Chuck says.
A head of bandana-bound blond hair pops up from behind one of the cars in the other stalls, and she waves when her eyes land on Cas.  “Hi, Castiel!”
When the skull-masked sorcerous at her side rises to join the others, Charlie puts a hand on her shoulder and leans close.  They whisper back and forth for a moment before the sorcerous nods and takes her leave.  Shortly after they’re fully alone, the queen reaches up to wipe away her mask.  The pixels fade, revealing bright red hair, laughing eyes, and a huge grin.
It might just be Castiel’s imagination that Dean’s hand lingers on his shoulder before he finally walks to the back of the truck.
Dean rolls his lips between his teeth in a valiant effort to hold back more laughter.  The irritated glance Cas gives him almost makes him lose it again, but he perseveres, forcing a serious mask over his amusement.  “You should probably let me take a look at the damage.  Make sure you’re not walking around like a pin cushion in boots.”
Chuckling at her annoyance, Castiel stretches his arms above his head, working out the kinks in his spine.  Muscles twinge in intimate places, making him smile at the memory of what he and Dean did last night that left him sore in all the good ways.
Dean thinks.  It’s passion unlike anything he’s ever known, but he’s not dragging Cas toward the nearest bed to have his way with him because this,
“What are you talking about?” Castiel argues.  “We’re safe here.  We’ll take the time.  Then when you’re better--”
His eyes sting from smoke and fatigue.  Fear and an old, familiar pain eat at him.  Along with the impotent fury that has driven him most of his life.  The fury that drove him to hunt monsters at his father’s side, and to kill the yellow eyed demon that destroyed his family.
That’s definitely a thought he doesn't wish to process, so he discards it.  But that leaves him with nothing to think about except the bare room, and the fact that his charge level hasn’t increased at all since he woke.
There’s no response.  Had he only imagined Dean’s tongue flicking against his?  A shiver that has nothing to do with the freezing wind and rain runs through him, and he scolds himself for his overactive imagination.  Now is not the time for such things!
“I think you should too,” Castiel says from the kitchen doorway, startling them both with his unexpected appearance.
Before he can explain why, Dean rolls his eyes and cuts him off.  “Sure, I’m going to follow a city greenhorn around in the wilderness.  C’mon, Cas, let’s go.”  He turns, gravel crunching underfoot as he marches away.
“Yeah, well I don’t know how accurate your assessment is, but I think you’re a good android, Cas,” Dean teases.
Sam’s answer is lost to him when Dean’s eyes fall on the room’s stupidly sexy occupant.  His feet glue themselves to the floor, and it takes a nudge from Sam to get moving again.
The man shrinks away slightly, but when his partner joins him, his spine straightens again.  “Just stay out of the way,” he warns.
Not that he cares what people think about how he’s dressed.  He’s only on coffee number two, and social functioning doesn’t start until halfway through cup three.
“Not those,” he says with a chuckle.  “Romances are more Dean’s speed.  Although he’ll deny it till his dying breath, so don’t bother asking him about it.”
When Sam sees him struggling, he also crouches down at Magda’s other side.  Despite his immense size, he makes himself seem small and unthreatening.  His voice is gentle when he speaks to her.  Castiel only understands pieces of what he’s saying.
“Just a little.”  Castiel is proud of the nonchalant tone he’s managing.  He exhales slowly, and wonders how he’s not breathing hellfire across the table.
“Yes, and I find it very… odd,” Castiel says.  “There are no entries in my recent error logs regarding the phenomenon, and I don’t know what causes the reaction.  If it’s happened with anyone before you, I have no logs to examine prior to my last reset.”
The sensation of being watched intensifies and Castiel takes a deep breath.  He needs to remain calm.  His life depends on it.
From the corner of his eye he sees Castiel nod.  “Most of the time I didn’t mind my role at the brothel--what I remember of it.  I didn’t always understand the appeal of the requests--”
But as pleased as he is to finally wash the layers of filth from his skin, he’s decidedly less so with the Jameson.  Castiel Jameson, Pinkerton Agent, left them in jail for hours, probably to give Dean time to ponder the merits of making the right decision about his offer.  Then he’d returned and started tossing out orders left and right.  One of which was to make “the prisoners” more presentable apparently.  Virgil and Wyatt didn’t seem to have the same objection to Jameson’s high handedness as Dean did.
“You gonna take them up on their offer to keep in touch?” Dean asks as he turns them down the hallway to the bedrooms.
When Sam asks, he always gets an eyebrow waggle and a cheerfully cryptic “I know my organizational system, Samshine!”
And he’s spent all of his time since developing technology, both the synthetic biological, that helps people.  In addition to their robotics division, they also create a lot of the cybernetics that he and Dean use, plus they’re the number one provider of 3D printed limb and organ replacements grown directly from a patient’s DNA so their body is far less likely to reject it.  Unlike Roman Enterprises, the tech coming out of Angel Industries goes through far more robust and ethical testing before being released to the public.  As far as Sam knows, most of the shit he’s had to hunt down has been one of Roman’s creations, and Angel Industries hasn’t even come across his radar until he met Cas.
Fuck, that’s definitely a call out.  Castiel didn’t come right out and say he knows Dean’s been avoiding him, but it’s there between the lines.
Dean opens his mouth to argue further, but movement over Sam’s shoulder catches his eye.  He goes still, argument forgotten. And then he’s shoving past Sam and striding through the stable to the corral behind it.
“Damn fool better not get himself killed,” Dean mutters.  Not now.  Not after surviving long enough for Dean to find him.
Dean holds his peace, but he can see the way Cas is favoring his left heel.  Probably blisters.  The dead man’s boots on his feet fit worse than the ones he started the trip with.  Better than going barefoot, but he’ll need better ones before they leave Las Cruces.
The first sign that something is wrong is the music.  There’s no way in hell he’d have this hoppy techno stuffy playing in the bunker.  And the hard surface under him is definitely not his bed, or the comfortable couch in the bunker’s tv room.
