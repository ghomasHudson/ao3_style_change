Gabriel shut off the program and stood silently in the middle of the room. He sighed deeply. “You’ve gotta be shitting me.” He pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head, then walked over to the door. He touched the wall next to the door, but didn’t feel the hum he felt earlier. He opened the door and walked into the hall, where he reached out toward the wall in front of him. His hand was millimeters away from the wall when a voice interrupted him.
“Keelah!” Raan’s eyes grew wide.
A masked medic leaned over Sam with a needle in their hand. Sam felt a poke at the side of his neck, and his world went black.
Udina’s eyes widened slightly at Castiel’s mention of Cerberus. He looked down at the floor for a moment, shoulders drooping in a faked show of resignation as he composed himself. “Well,” he said, straightening up and adjusting the hem of his suit coat, “I can see that you’re committed to wasting your talents helping other races rather than helping your own. Mark my words, gentlemen, this will not end well.” He turned and walked out of the hospital room, pausing halfway down the hall to pull up a screen on his Omni-Tool. “They’ll be in Room 403 at Huerta Memorial when you get here--perhaps your methods of persuasion will be more effective.” he said
“Son of a Bitch!” Dean yelled.  “Sorry, Cas, but you have no idea how long I’ve wanted this.”
Ash walked over and clapped him on the shoulder. “Good game, Dean. Better luck next time, Man,” he said, smirking.
Castiel placed his hands on Dean’s chest, feeling Dean’s heartbeat racing in time with his own.  He brushed gentle fingers to Dean’s injured shoulder, tracing the scar.  Dean inhaled sharply as Castiel leaned forward to let his lips follow his fingers, tweaking Dean’s other nipple as he mouthed over his shoulder.  Castiel moved down to Dean’s nipple, taking it in his mouth, licking and biting it gently between his teeth.  Dean growled at that and shoved his hips forward to rut against Castiel and mouth at Castiel’s neck.  Castiel didn’t recognize the keening noise he made as Dean sucked a mark into his collarbone.  He thought he surely would burst into flame with how hot his skin felt.  He was painfully hard and so was Dean judging by the way he could feel Dean pushing against him.
Also if anyone does fan art and would draw some of Cas's *ahem* costumes, well that would be awesome. :)
Dean turned to Cas kissed him, cupping his cheek.  “Let’s go home, Cas,” he said.
Welp. Have some smut. Also, I forgot part of the end of Chapter 1, didn't get copy-pasted and I think it's worth going back to see because I am quite proud of the Golden Girls reference, frankly.
“I like you.  I really, really like you.  And...I want you,” Dean said.  “And you’re so close but I don’t want to fuck this up for you or for Ben and -”
“Dean - what?” Cas asked, breathless.  Dean watched him shiver at the loss of body heat.  God he was so beautiful - his hair a mess, his lips swollen, bite marks covering his neck and his cock so fucking hard.
“Cas - wait -” Dean’s brain caught up to what was happening. “Do you want to grab dinner or coffee or something?!” he asked.
Cas’s periods of lucidity gradually increased.  He was not himself yet but he had worked up to a few sentences and twenty minutes of awareness.  Most often those sentences were “Go away, Dean.  Leave me to die.”
And he left taking the goodwill he’d temporarily earned with him. What an asshole, thought Dean.
“Yeah?!” Dean was surprised that he was practically yelling.  “WELL I LIKE YOU TOO,” he shouted.
“Can’t you wait until after the holidays?” Dean asked.
Dean choked on the sip of water he’d taken. Cas smirked at him, the asshole.
Cas groaned his frustration.
*****
Dean moaned and Castiel licked his lower lip and then drew Dean’s tongue out.  Castiel sucked on Dean’s tongue and let him push him onto his back so that Dean was lying on top of him.  He wrapped his leg around Dean and thrust up as Dean thrust down.  Castiel slipped his hand under the waistband of Dean’s trousers and grabbed a handful of his ass.  Dean moved to suck Castiel’s throat and began unbuttoning his shirt.  With each button, Dean tasted and teased the skin revealed.  He slipped the shirt from Castiel’s shoulders and ran his hands over his chest.  Castiel gasped a breath as Dean bent to lick and suck first one nipple and then the other until Castiel felt like he would explode if Dean didn’t touch him.  Castiel clawed at Dean’s back and shoulders.  Dean continued to work his way down, dipping his tongue into Castiel’s navel.  He locked eyes with Castiel as he unbuttoned his trousers.  Castiel lifted his hips as Dean pulled the fabric from his body, freeing his aching cock.  Dean stared down at him.  Castiel raised himself up on his elbows.  Dean lowered himself and taking Castiel’s cock in his hand, he ran his tongue around the head.  Castiel collapsed back onto the bed and arched his back, groaning.  Dean took more of Castiel into his mouth and began a rhythm, bobbing his head up and down and hollowing his cheeks, his hand working in tandem with his mouth, his tongue driving Castiel mad with need.
“Astrophysics. Aiming to work for NASA” He grinned.
Dean shoots him a look, while Cas rolls his eyes.
CAS: It wasn’t your fault Dean.
Cas nods “Thank you- I think- I think I just needed to hear that.”
“I mean it, History class first day of school I’ve wanted to kiss you.”
“Mhmm” Jack nods with another yawn.
He looks around the park, noticing no movement anywhere. He lets in a large inhale. There’s something he hasn’t tried yet. It’s worked countless times before. And hell, maybe Cas will hear him but won’t respond and Dean won’t blame him. But he has to scratch that itch that’s been under his skin for days.
“What?” Dean says looking directly bad at Cas.
“Hopefully” Jack agrees mid-yawn.
DEAN: Goodnight Jack.
The first time he laid eyes on the nerdy, overly dressed guy his heart tightened and his palms started to sweat. That feeling has yet to go away.
The team continues to go crazy for him and he just basks in all his glory. Feelings supern accomplished that he could help his team win, The cheerleaders all chant his name and get the crowd to chant with them. It rings in his ears and he’s so glad for this moment. When the people finally begin to part and Dean can catch his breath, he looks up into the stands to find Sammy waving enthusiastically at him. He waves back, but not before noticing that Castiel has vanished from his spot.
It took some time for Dean and Cas to show them around, but in the end it was a relief that the bunker wouldn’t stay empty. It was getting passed on, as the Men of Letters had always planned on.
Dean drops to his knees next to Cas, grabbing onto his hand squeezing it tight. He shuts his eyes trying to hold back his tears.
“I couldn’t tell you how long I’ve waited to do that Cas.”
“Naomi” Dean grits out.
He's sure glad the room is pretty dark as his cheeks flare-up, “Sex. They mean have sex.”
“No no thank you for telling me. I know it’s not easy for you.”
He stands in the door way admiring the view. The simplicity of it all, as if none of their issues or their past had mattered. It was just, now.
“Okay enough enough! No throwing balls in the hallway! And get to class!” Mrs. Anderson yells from the door to the math room.
“Love you too Dean. You’ll always be a pain in my ass.”
“Right on. Talk to you later Jack.”
Jack presses a button and the lights dim and the screen turns on “Like every tv in the house, you guys are hooked up to every streaming service you’ll ever need. This is your home, you gotta
“I told him that I’d always look out for the both of you and he seemed to take that at face value. I told him he had to promise me that he’d come home and explain everything. He said he will, he promised. We hung up shortly after that. I’m sorry Dean but I… I’m not sure how I feel about all this.”
But as if to answer his question, Cas comes waltzing in holding the biggest bowl of popcorn. They don’t say anything to each other as Cas flicks the lights off and sits down on the couch. Dean has his arm resting along with the back cushions and Cas takes this as an invitation to scoot in under his arm, tucking himself in perfectly. He leans back against Dean while Dean can’t help in snuggling closer. There’s no panic, no worry, no ache in his chest just peace. Cas looks up at him through thick lashes and Dean can’t hide the smile that’s hogging up most of his face.
“Good” Jack smiles.
“Yeah, Cas did when I moved in.”
Dean knews that look, he’d given it to Cas millions of times. Even when they weren’t anything, most times he hoped Cas wouldn’t catch him but the odd time he wished he would. It’s a fond look, like the person is holding your heart in their pocket. Dean couldn’t be happier for the kid.
But then he stops.
“He loves you though. Like you love him. You know that right?”
Then the line cuts dead.
Dean leans forward and kisses Cas’ temple “go get some sleep honey.”
The good was all the above. The bad was Sam showing up to the bunker at 2am. Pounding on the front door in the pouring rain. Dean and Cas were in bed-- making up for lost time.
“Welcome to The DeanCas Cave” he says as they step down the stairs.
“How's Thunder from DownUnder doing?”
Dean gives him a positive smile, “Of course kiddo.”
“I accept your apology” Castiel smiles. “Thanks.”
They both stumble out of the cave heading towards their respective bedrooms. Dean though, heads into the bathroom instead, leaning over the sink to brush away the beer and popcorn taste from his mouth. He’s in the middle of foaming up his mouth when Cas joins him using the other sink.
The show went to commercial when Jack spoke up “I think you two should have a kid. One that’s actually under 18 at the time of adoption.”
“Dean?” a soft voice says.
Dean runs a hand over his face, trying not to let his emotions consume him. Jack’s speech echoes in his mind, the sincerity, and sadness in his voice. Dean feels bad about putting this burden on Jack when all he’s been trying to do is care for the kid. He promised Kelly that. He and Cas promised Kelly that.
Cas smiles into Dean’s neck, “I like the sound of that.”
They’re about 6 hours from returning to the bunker after burning a cursed object in Reno (Dean wanted to leave asap ‘cause the sketchy owner of the museum kept offering Dean an outrageous sum of money for his car and there’s no way in hell he’d ever sell her) and well... Dean suddenly can’t get his mind off the idea of setting up a small room to be like a movie theatre. Or more appetizing to Dean, a Dean cave. Just somewhere with a large TV, a small bar, a popcorn maker, and a large enough couch that he and Cas could cuddle on.
Tonight is their fourth night in Manhattan and also their last before they head back to the bunker in the morning. And Dean can’t sleep, not like he has the other previous nights but tonight, it's worse. He tosses and turns, the moon too bright as it peers into the decent but expensive hotel room (Sam said they could splurge for once in their life).
Dean stays quiet. Not wanting to startle Cas in case something bad has happened and Cas is having a panic attack. But then all of a sudden there’s the sound of wind in the room and Dean is suddenly on the couch instead of the recliners.
Dean once again finds Cas’ eyes, they’re both radiating the same excitement. A life, together.
Jack gets that nervous looking twitch that Cas sometimes would get when he desperately wanted to zap out of somewhere.
“Who! Who! Who!” the crowd shouts amidst drunken giggles and screams.
“I dreamt about it weeks ago. But it felt… real…” Dean answers sounding distant.
Dean and Cas both got to be in the delivery room when Grace arrived into the world and to say they both didn’t get choked up is an understatement. They’d both been crying off and on since she was born 5 hours ago.
“Right. Well, hopefully, they back off” Sam adds.
“Holy shit. Finally. I didn’t know if the eye fucking was an Angel thing and Dean happened to pick it up but. Wow this really. Wow.”
CAS: lol definitely a perk.
“See that’s where you’re wrong Sammy. Jack’s like 3 years old.”
“Oh my god, Dean!” Cas’ voice booms well Sam’s cackling echoes throughout the room. Dean hesitates on getting up for a second, feeling like maybe he should fake falling asleep or something. But decides against it and grumpily gets up, sitting back in his seat.
Yes. He wants to shout, wants to collide into Cas make him moan, make him come undone, make him the closest Dean can get him to become human. Instead, he walks over to Cas’ outstretched hand and puts a beer into it.
“Dean,” Sam says carefully, “Give it time. He’ll be back.”
Dean most times has to snap him out of it with a simple press of both his thumbs to the back of his neck, makes him sigh and come back to earth.
Dean pulled it from his pocket, the dead battery sign flashing “Yeah yeah it’s dead sorry. What’s going on?”
Gabe swallowed his bite of food “Actually. A friend of mine, her parents are selling their establishment in San Fran. It was a restaurant but with some elbow grease I’m sure you could switch it up.”
“And he agreed?” Jack asks.
So he suddenly makes his mind up and knows he’s gonna do it. Somewhere far away from everyone else’s spaces and the common areas. Somewhere you can blast the volume and no one outside will hear the electrifying sounds of dinosaurs roaring or helicopters whirling or earthquakes rumbling. Or having Cas on top of him, making Dean moan loud enough the whole town of Lebanon should hear him.
For a week straight, Sam and Dean work at trying to find a backdoor into Heaven, something that will get them in without alerting the dickbags in the garrison. While researching Dean tries to hone in on that feeling or glow Jack was talking about. He feels for it every morning when he wakes up and every night before he passes out. It’s the one thing that lets him know that Cas is still alive.
“Finally!” Dean hears Benny yell and a few more people follow suit and Dean couldn’t be happier. He stares at Cas’s bright blue eyes that are dilated from pure excitement and Dean wishes he could just swim in them.
Cas paused “I’ll be sad when they leave.”
Cas is quick in pulling their mouths together, only breaking apart when their daughter coo’s between them.
Jack goes silent.
“Having fun Winchester?” She asks as he approached.
Dean half-smiles to himself, “Hey… hey kiddo. How’s school going?”
“Dean” it’s soft, like an apology.
“Don’t!” Naomi shouts with a wave of her hand. By the wheezing sound, Sam has lost his voice.
“Then why don’t you and the other older angels give up your grace! You all care so much about Heaven then it’s your duty to do so!” Jack shouts and Dean wants to cheer for Jack.
“Holy…!” The child’s eyes widened and his jaw dropped. He looked up at Israfel, who smiled and nodded.
CASTIEL: (looking back up) Yes. All of it happened--there are some things that were left out from a few books, like Sam drinking demon blood. (DANIELS’ eyes go wide) But that only lasted for a couple of books. Otherwise…(CASTIEL takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly) yes, it’s all true. As fantastical as it still seems, the three of us really do come from a world where there are angels and demons...and monsters.
Joker shook his head. “Really? No offense, but it sounds like the angels where you’re from are real asshats.”
“For saying yes. For being my friend and companion. For letting me share the love that you and Hannah have for each other. Stannis and Gabriel, they're good men...they remind me that I couldn’t have asked for two better humans to have kids with.”
“No problem.” Kaidan smiled and finished putting on his undersuit. “You know what? Let me finish getting suited up, and I’ll check over the rest of your gear. Just to be on the safe side.”
“A large part of me still does,” Gabriel admitted as he slowly rose to his feet. “Rasa, whatever you may think of me, whatever I may have thought of myself; I’m not an object or a tool. We both know that. I’m my own man now. I can make my own choices--” He reached out to her again. ”And I
Cadfael smiled broadly and put a hand over his heart. “I’ll see you soon,” he whispered, before turning and walking out of the assembly chamber.
Sam scratched his head for a moment. “Well from what Cas told me about angels,” he said, brushing a stray lock of hair from his face, “Sometimes an injury that affects certain parts of a vessel’s brain may cause an angel to “reboot” and revert to his original instruction set. There was this one angel named Samandriel who got captured by Crowley--”
"Come on, Kaidan!" The pair of biotics blitzed up the stairs and out the smashed back door into the junkyard. A circle of fire sprang up around them, but Shepard extinguished it with a biotic nova. In the instant before his barrier could recharge, a heavy thump on the back of his head knocked him out cold.
“This is Lieutenant Victus of the Ninth Platoon. We’re under fire, my men are scattered...”
“We’ve taken too many losses--what am I supposed to tell my men?” Victus turned to look at the remainder of the Ninth Platoon. His shoulders fell. “I’ve failed them, Commander.”
Cadfael sighed deeply. “Camael was the last, thankfully. But still--proportionally speaking, our losses are about the same as everyone else’s.” The archangel looked out over the assembly chamber. “There are going to be some empty chairs the next time we meet. We expected it, but it still stings, knowing that there are good mortals and angels that won’t be around anymore because of this war.”
“I understand that you were reckless, Admiral,” Shepard barked. He leaned forward to get in Gerrel’s face, blue-green eyes alight with barely-contained anger. The scar on his jawline burned bright red and his lips were curled into an angry snarl. “I understand that you unnecessarily endangered the entire Migrant Fleet when they should have been evacuated, and that you did it for your own selfish reasons.” He balled his hands into fists, squeezing until his knuckles cracked. “This is exactly the sort of short-sighted bloodthirsty behaviour that I was afraid of,” Shepard continued.
Horizon.
“That’s the third time that’s happened. Why are they moving me?”
A clip from EDI’s cameras of the angel materializing in the
Eve got down from the bed and put her arms around Dean in a motherly embrace. She kissed the top of his head through her veil and gently stroked his hair. “It took a lot to share that with me Dean,” she said quietly after several minutes. “It’s never easy to lose people that you care for, but know that every moment that you live, every battle that you fight brings honour to your fallen loved ones.” She stepped back and put a hand on Dean’s heart. “They are not here physically, but you carry them with you every day. Let them give you strength, as my sisters who died give me strength.”
“Well I wouldn’t call you that,” Dean quipped.
Shepard fixed the angel with a look. “No jumping ahead. We go as a group.” Castiel pursed his lips in frustration. “I’m serious,” Shepard said. “Especially with--”
The ship shuddered as the Heavy Fleet’s guns began to pound it. “All fleets!” Shepard radioed, “Hold fire! I repeat, hold fire!”
“As long as it’s not spaghetti in meatballs from the microwave,” Sam quipped, “I think I’ll be okay.”
In his dream, Castiel was in Heaven--not his favourite eternal Tuesday afternoon of kite-flying. This Heaven was a large meadow under a warm summer sun, and he was laying on his back watching the clouds roll by in a gentle breeze. A dandelion seed-head floated along the meadow, lighting on his chest. The fronds of the dandelion pricked him slightly where they touched him as it got closer to his face. It finally stopped and started pricking his neck uncomfortably for several minutes, before rolling right up on his face.
Door opens. SAM walks in.
“Uhh…Dockside! Dockside looks good—go there.”
“Okay, so wait--if you really are an angel,” Kaidan asked, stepping forward and steadying himself on a handhold, “Then why do you look like one of us? Why not just show up as you really are and kick the Reapers’ asses, if you’re bigger than they are? Well, bigger than most of them anyway.”
“Stannis,” Kaidan said, looking down at his lover. “You know what would have happened--the Alliance would have terminated him in the tank, or imprisoned him and probably charged you with illegal human cloning or something, in addition to all the other shit they were going to hang on you before the Reapers showed up. Could you have lived with that on your conscience?”
“Forty percent…”
Gabriel raised both eyebrows. “Khar’shan?” The image blinked.
“Fair enough,” Dean said. “Though we’re not exactly the, uh, civilian type.”
A couple of minutes later, the door of the shuttle opened and Cortez hopped out with Vega right behind him. They tucked their shirts in and looked around to make sure there was nobody else in the shuttle bay, then shared a quick kiss before heading back to their workstations.
“We split up shortly after escaping the hospital--He said he had to protect the Council.”
“I dunno,” Shepard said. “Hey Glyph, you out there?”
“He took a nasty shock from the drive core,” Chakwas said quietly, placing a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “He’s alive, but he’ll need to stay in the medbay for a while.” She turned to Adams. “Did you see what happened?”
kill him. I’m choosing not to assume worst-case, here.” Azrael leaned forward over and took Sam’s hand. “Hey, look at me please.” Sam looked back at Azrael, who gave him a slight smile. “If Dean were here, what do you think he would want you to do, given that you’re still able to continue the fight alongside your teammates?”
Camael slowly got to his feet and smiled. “My sister’s puppet--did she convince you to spawn another abomination to satisfy her pathetic need to be loved?” Camael laughed softly. “I told Cerberus all about Heaven. Told them about the Nephilim. Imagine their surprise when they realized that they’d had an abomination of their own...and they just let him go.”
“Yeah,” Sam responded, his face turning a little pink. “I really am sorry about that.”
“Yeah.” Vega grinned. “For hardsuits. Hopefully you don’t cut off anything important or crush your
The being shifted into temporal view as a brown-skinned woman with bobbed dark hair. She wore a long-sleeved deep blue jumper dress trimmed with red and gold. “My vessel and I were the last ones off the Citadel before the Reapers overran it,” the angel said, her voice heavy with regret. “Ironic, since we’ll need it again before this is over.”
“No sir--and there’s also no need to worry about fluid spills when you’re working on these parts, since there aren’t any hydraulics. The most we have to deal with is leaking hydrogen, which dissipates into the atmosphere, or trace amounts of eezo.” Steve took another coil out of the assembly. “This coil’s not quite as damaged as the one you’ve got in your hands, but we’re still going to have to replace it.”
“I told him, Israfel.” Israfel turned to see P’a’l standing by a display of pottery, arms crossed and staring coldly at her. “I was there when you and the other Exiles built this with Azrael's help, as you recall. And as your
“I begged them to negotiate,” Tali said sadly. “I did. Why didn’t they listen?!”
“Councilor Udina,” Kaidan said, turning toward Udina and pointing his pistol at him, “Step away from the console.” Councilor Tevos walked up to Udina and put a hand on his arm, fixing him with a stern look. Udina shoved the asari to the ground and pulled out a pistol, which he pointed at her. His face had anger written all over it.
Cas shook his head.  “No, nothing scheduled until Christmas break.”
“I want you to be happy; I love you, Dad.  I’m sorry I ran,” Ben choked out.
Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn’d!
“Oh my God, Jess! I’m so excited for you!!! Is that the ring, let me see it! Regina said it was a full karat! Sam you must have saved for years!” Dean thought she might pass out if she didn’t pause to take a breath, and he wasn’t thrilled by the not-so-subtle dig she tacked on to the end of her rant.
Before he had time to be embarrassed, though, Cas was releasing him, pulling back and sliding out the door.
, but before he could add anything, Cas was rolling the condom on him, and lifting a leg to straddle him and Dean realized what had taken Cas so long in the bathroom. Fuck, he’d been getting himself ready.
Castiel liked Bobby despite having only exchanged a handful of words with the man.  They often drank coffee at the same time at Harvelle’s and after a few weeks, Bobby started drinking his coffee on the barstool next to Castiel.
“You, Dean Winchester, are insufferable,” Castiel continued.  “I healed you.  I care for you.  I feed you.  And you push and push and push,” Castiel punctuated each ‘push’ with a poke to Dean’s chest.  “What more do you want from me Dean?”
Dean glanced at the clock on the wall. “About two hours,” he said.
“My apologies, Dean, but I need to ensure that wound is healing properly.”
“Um, not really, but you got pie, so c’mon in.”
“Is he here?” Dean asked, already starting to push past Sam.  Sam sighed and stopped Dean with a hand to his chest.
Dean felt himself gulp at the intensity in Cas’s gaze. Sure he’d only spent all of ninety minutes in his presence, most of that trying not to pop an awkward boner during a waltz lesson for Christ’s sake, but he really did not want to be in this Roman guy’s shoes.
Bobby cleared his throat.  He took the book he’d been carrying under one arm and opened it.
Sam smiled and before he knew it, he was wrapped in his baby brother’s gigantic bear hug.
“Please tell me you made coffee,” he heard Cas grumble from behind him.  Dean turned and smiled at the sight of Cas, hair going in every direction, wrapped in his pale blue bed sheet.  His anxiety was temporarily abated by Cas’s adorable grumpiness.
Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher!
Location:  Dodge City, Kansas
Cas was still holding the back of his own knee and spread wide.  Dean steadied himself on one arm and lined his cock up with the other.  He pushed in agonizingly slowly before finally bottoming out.
Dean sighed.  “Halloween, okay?  And I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Apparently,” Cas answered and goddamn his voice was even lower and more gravelly than normal.
“Shut up and cuddle.”
Dean took a deep breath and adjusted the full-brimmed cowboy hat on his head.
“Whoa there, Doc,” Sheriff Singer said, placing a steadying hand on his shoulder.  “Why don’t you go clean up and get some rest and we’ll watch over Dean for now.”
Castiel returned early that evening and after supper insisted on torturing Dean by ‘checking’ his shoulder.
Chapter 2:
*****
Sam caught the ball and ran to throw it back to Dean, pretending to avoid the imaginary defense.
“But you blush like one,” Dean said, lifting Cas’s chin to meet his gaze.  He smirked.
He walked to the living room and smiled at the sight of Cas, waiting on the couch, bandana covering his eyes, hands gripping his own thighs. Dean took a deep breath.  He could do this, he thought.
Then he’d said the words that sealed Dean’s fate:  “Oh and it’s a skirt party, so you have to wear a skirt.”
Dean moaned.  “Jesus, that feels good, Cas,” he said.  Castiel growled as Dean’s hand on his ass tightened.  Then Dean squeezed his left hand around Castiel’s gripping their cocks.  Castiel rutted frantically into their hands; he was losing himself.  Dean felt so good against him.  He didn’t realize he was moaning out “So good, so good” with his eyes closed in an endless stream until Dean slid the hand on his ass up to his hair, tugging lightly but enough so that Castiel opened his eyes to look at Dean.
“Yes, Castiel.  I CAN read.  Besides, I’d already read The Scarlet Letter and that windbag Melville's fish story.”
“Mmmmm,” Cas moaned.
“You don’t need to do that, Cas-” Dean started.
*****
After passing through the door, Castiel turned and locked it.  He scanned the room before walking back to Dean.  Dean hadn’t messed up Castiel’s orderly space much.  Castiel could tell he’d run his hand over the books on the shelf and had plucked one of his journals from its spot, of course.
O hand in hand—O wholesome pleasure—O one more desirer and lover!
During the day, Dean read aloud to Cas from his journals.  Every night, Dean continued trying to catch Cas during his moment of lucidity.  Dean told him he knew; he told him he was sorry; and he told him that what happened to Alan was not his fault.  Cas’s reactions to Dean ranged from blank stares to yelling to occasionally beating his fists feebly against Dean’s chest.  Inevitably, Cas would sob - not crying, not even weeping, but full-body sobbing that wracked his weak frame with its force.  Dean would gather him in his arms and hold him until he calmed down enough to pass into exhausted sleep.
*****
“Morphine.” Whiskey Voice said.  “Relax.  You need it.”
Novak’s head snapped up at his voice and he met his eyes again. Dean saw recognition flicker through them.
“Hey-” Dean said sharply, and slammed his palm down onto the table, making Cas look up in surprise and meet his gaze. He didn’t know why but he couldn’t handle that look on Cas’s face. “You’ll get him. You’re gonna nail that son of a bitch,” he said.
Dean looked up, sharply.  Cas nodded once and turned away from Dean to lie back down.
Dean looked down at Cas’s hands, clasped in his. He tried to will Cas to feel better, as though he could push calming vibes through his palms and into Cas. Never mind that he didn’t feel calm at all. His emotions were a stomach-churning mix of anxiety, rage, and guilt. He cleared this throat and Cas looked up at him. One look at Cas’s face and the planned words of reassurance died on his tongue.
Dean cupped Cas’s cheek and sliding his hand down to the bolt of Cas’s jaw he drew him in and sealed his lips over Cas’s.  He licked along Cas’s bottom lip.  Cas gasped and Dean licked into his mouth.  He tasted like whiskey, of course, but Dean didn’t mind.  Cas’s whole body was into the making out - he rubbed himself against Dean and ran his strong hands up and down Dean’s back before settling them on his ass.  He pulled Dean against him.  Dean broke the kiss to groan and run his teeth along Cas’s throat, biting gently.
Cas put his hand on Dean’s shoulder.  “I’m sorry, Dean.”
“You wanna tell me what the HELL is going on and why he’s so upset?” Dean demanded.
“That’s the idea,” Cas said as he settled into place. Dean moved his hands to Cas’s hips, but Cas grabbed them and placed them above his head with the clear message - stay. He reached behind Dean’s neck and gripped his hair, almost tight enough to hurt.
Dean got up and tiptoed to the door.  “Good night, Cas,” he whispered.
“I don’t know,” Cas said squinting his eyes and leaning in even closer.
“I need to watch what I eat, Dean,” Cas said. “My super hot boyfriend is rather rigorous in his appreciation of my body.”
Dean stared up at his reflection in the mirror on the ceiling. He could not believe Cas had gone for the honeymoon suite. Hell, he couldn’t believe a motel on this side of town (the upscale suburban side) had a honeymoon suite. Not that he was complaining. He turned to look at Cas.
Dean smiled. “Happy New Year, Cas.”
“What?” Dean snapped, coming out of his reverie.
Castiel breathed deeply and tried not to think about what could go wrong.  He refused to take up arms, even to aid Dean, and he wondered for the millionth time if volunteering to blow the dam violated the oaths he’d made to himself.  Too late now, he thought, taking his hat off and wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his arm.  He glanced over to where Grace waited, hitched to a slim sapling.  She sensed the tension in the air and tossed her head, nickering lowly.  After the detonation, Castiel would ride hard to Ryan’s position along the west side of the Canyon rim.  “Shh...easy girl,” Castiel soothed her and ran his hand down her neck.  She calmed a bit at his touch but her eyes were wide and she scented the air continuously.
“Shit,” he swore.
“Bobby!” Dean yelled, grabbing a rag and attempting to wipe the grease off his face.
“Ha!  I knew it!” Sam gloated, moving out of the way easily.  “What happened?  Did you screw it up?”
The lamp sputtered and died as Dean finished the final volume covering Cas’s war career.  The volume ended with a single sentence:  “I will never kill again.”  Dean sighed and closed the book having dog eared some of the passages to read to Cas.   Tears slid down his cheeks; he now knew why Cas was the way he was.  And he feared the only way to get him back was to drag him back through hell again.
Castiel blows the dam.  Dean, Sam, and Bobby trap Alistair and his men in the canyon.  But all does not go according to plan.
Dean felt his dick stir at the sound.  Goddammit.  Would he find everything Cas did sexy, he wondered.  He shifted his legs apart and turned to plate up the food.  He set a plate of food down in front of Cas and sat across from him, gathering his nerve.
“No - I mean.  I’m -” he turned to face Cas.  “I can’t lose you, Cas,” he said.
Cas met his eyes.  “How?” he asked his eyes full of tears.
“Yes, Cas - you’re being a selfish prick,” he yelled.  “So you screwed up.  Punishing yourself isn’t going to bring Alan back, Cas.  It won’t change what you did.  But you can try to do some good with the time you have, Cas.  That’s all any of us can do.”
“No, Dean, I need to do this,” he said.  He sighed and started reading aloud.
“Time to cowboy up, Winchester,” he said to himself. Shaking his head, he stepped forward, pulling the door open.
“I see,” Cas answered.  “My apologies, Dean.  My brother and I - our upbringing wasn’t exactly...conventional.”
He sighed. He refused to break out Batman for this. Ellen had talked him into taking an extra-long Halloween weekend shift at the gay bar across town. Halloween fell on a Saturday and one of their staff had quit so they were desperate. He’d bartended there from time to time before but never on Halloween. Tips were good and he’d even scored a few hookups. Although he typically dated women, Dean had been openly bi since his late teens. He just hadn’t been serious with anyone since Lisa, really.
“I asked him to,” Dean said. “But we wanted to tell Ben and well, that went sideways pretty fast.”
“Wait - you live with your brother?” Dean asked.
“This still what you want?” he asked.  “Or I could...” Dean licked his lips and glanced meaningfully back at Cas’s cock.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean and held him while he cried.  He was so angry he shook with it.  When Dean could breathe again he said quietly to Cas’s shoulder, “Sammy and I only made it because Bobby saw the smoke from his place and showed up with a posse ready to put out the fire.”
“Whoa, whoa there cowboy, slow down,” Dean started, pulling out of Cas’s space.
“Fuck!” Dean yelled and threw his head back, groaning.  He pulled on Cas’s top, eager to feel his bare chest against his own.  Cas got the idea and leaning back pulled off the halter top.  He got stuck, arms tangled in the straps, and Dean helped him pull it off, tossing it to the floor.
“Just for that, boy, I’m going to make you watch.  I’m going to make you watch your mother burn before I kill you.  And then I’m going to make you watch while I cut your little brother apart piece by piece,” Alistair sneered.
Sorry for the delay in posting.  Been busy with work and holidays, etc.  I'm working on a Spotify playlist for this fic, for those who are interested as most of the chapters reference songs or have titles "borrowed" from songs.
O to haste firm holding—to haste, haste on with me.”
“Awesome.”  Dean stood up from the chair he had drug from Castiel’s front room to the examination room and carefully leaned the left side of his body onto one of his crutches.  Dean hobbled over to Castiel and without another word, snatched the package from Harvelle’s out of his hands.  After returning to his seat, he wasted no time tearing into the package and shoveling the pie into his mouth.  Castiel was surprised he’d even bothered to accept the fork Castiel had handed him.
“Keys.”  Dean panted.  “In my pocket.”
It was over in moments after that.  Sandwiched between Dean and Sam and Bobby and pestered from above by Castiel and MacLain, the bulk of Alistair’s men died quickly.  Those remaining realized it was over and threw down their arms.  They’d take their chances with a judge, Castiel supposed.
*****
Dean and Ben settled in at Sam and Jess’s and helped set the table and get the rest of the food ready.  The doorbell rang and Sam didn’t seem to hear it in the kitchen.  Dean stuck his head around the corner from the family room.
Dean let out his breath like he’d been punched in the gut. It was one of the hottest things he’d ever seen. He couldn’t stop staring.
“What’s a girl gotta do to get a shot of tequila in this dump?” Meg drawled, rolling her eyes in Dean’s direction and running her hand up Cas’s arm and along the back of his neck.
“I gathered,” Cas deadpanned.
The song ended and as though the spell were broken, Cas reached one hand up behind Dean’s neck and crashed his lips to Dean’s, knocking his hat off in the process.  He snuck the other hand into the back pocket of Dean’s shorts and grabbed a handful of his ass.
Dean pulled out slowly and moved a hand to Cas’s hip.  He slammed back in and Cas howled.
Castiel prodded gently at the area around the bone.  The man groaned.  The tall man made to grab Castiel’s hands from their work but Sheriff Singer held him back.  “Get him out of here.” Castiel said.  Bobby pulled the protesting brother back into the front room and Castiel got to work.
“Are you sure about this, Dean?” Cas asked.  “That’s what I meant earlier about Ben.  I mean I know how I feel, but I am not a father and I don’t know how he will feel about me in his life in a different way.”
“What the fuck did I do?” he said.
“No Sam, it’s not just that I don’t dance, it’s that I am so far from being okay with dancing that I’m the town in
“Is your mom-” Dean asked.
“So what else does a ‘Man of Honor’ have to do, other than practice this weird dance with me?” Dean asked.
Dean just nodded, trying to give Cas emotional support through telekinesis or something.
Castiel’s voice faded to a whisper for the last lines.  Dean felt himself drifting off to sleep.
“What is now, ya idjit?!” Bobby yelled and wheeled himself from under the classic 1975 Caddy he’d been working on.
Goddamn he was so hard and it felt so good to have Cas against him. As much as he was enjoying the making out, Dean couldn’t wait. He leaned down and mouthed over Cas’s bare chest, probably covering his own face in glitter, he thought randomly. Dean ran his hands over both of Cas’s hard nipples, pinching them lightly. Cas gasped and Dean sunk to his knees.
Cas takes his phone out and hands it to her, she swipes through aweing at most of them. Dean took the moment to really be thankful for his life.
Dean has prayed to Cas a total of 12 times and has gotten nothing in return.
“It’s good. Got midterms next week so more studying of course. But I got an A on my cultural anthropology essay so that’s something.”
Dean could barely make out the blue hue in the eyes staring at him, but the weight in his shoulders instantly relaxed.
That’s not Cas’s voice. Far from it actually.
“Is that Cas?” Dean asks confused.
“Thanks for coming guys. Really. It means a lot,” Jack says. Cas looks at him, “Hey anytime. You say the word, we’re here.”
Dean huffs with a laugh, “Uh yeah, this is my project I guess,” he says before returning to painting the walls. This deep navy blue that fits his aesthetic perfectly. He’s got this last wall to finish and then he can move in the few tables and a cabinet he found in the bunkers storage.
Dean hums in thought, trying to understand if that has a deeper meaning than it sounds, “At least I won’t be John Winchester” Dean snorts suddenly curious if Jack has beer in his fridge.
“You were screaming… and it sounded like you were saying ‘Cas’ as loud as you could.”
Dean digs through the fridge when he makes a mental note to find a spot for a mini-fridge in his cave.
“Fuck Cas” Dean groans and just kisses him again because he can. And Cas loves it, just melts into Dean and grips him tight.
Dean knew this was coming sooner or later, that Sam would pry the information out of him so he could figure out a way to help. But Dean’s so tired of overthinking what went down might as well let someone else draw conclusions.
So after their ‘incident’ the other night Dean was positive Cas would be gone in the morning. But he was shocked when he walked into the kitchen to find Cas making a pot of coffee.
Cas yawns, “I enjoyed it. I certainly will wanna watch them again.”
“Yeah yeah he’s right next to me, what’s going on?”
He packs his bags and restocks the weapons duffle. Makes sure Baby has enough gas and refills the wiper fluid. He crawls into bed quarter to midnight, flicking his light off and imagining the open road.
“Where’s. Jack” Dean grits out.
Sam and Jody get married under a bright blue sky. Dean gives a speech that he’d never thought he’d see the day that Sam actually married someone. They laugh, drink and have a good time.
“Don’t even say it.”
“Hey boss?” a gruff voice called from behind him. Dean turned to see Ricardo his main chef holding out the bar’s telephone.
Then Cas is coughing behind them, Dean finds his grey eyes that are filled with sorrow, “It’s barely anything Naomi. Not worth extracting.”
Iris was fit to leave the hospital that night but with Grace being two weeks early she had to stay overnight for some extra care.
“Can someone tell me what's going on?” Dean barks.
“Jack… Honey, are you safe? Can you tell me that at least?” Cas pleads. He’s clearly picked up the terms of endearment thing from a few of the rom-com flicks Cas convinced him to watch last week. And sure maybe Eat, Pray, Love was kinda therapeutic whatever no one has to know that.
“Okay. See you soon Jack.”
DEAN: Don’t worry bout us kid. Focus on school.
She turns back to Dean, but all Dean can look at is Cas’s full-blown panic eyes. Dean hates that look, it’s the same one the last time Dean saw him.
“Yeah what your dad said” Cas retorts, his hand intertwining with Dean’s.
Cas laughs, “See Dean! Even Sam thinks John Wayne is dumb!”
Then Sam is reaching over pulling Dean’s phone out of his hand. “What the hell Sam!”
“It was me,” Sam says out of breath. He’s got an angel blade in his hand and blood dripping down his arm. “Used a banishing sigil. Not sure where they get banished too when we’re already in Heaven but it seems to have worked?”
Cas pulled him closer “Never. I’ll never leave you.”
DEAN: Don’t you have studying to be doing?
“Will do” Sam replies.
“Jack…”
Dean grimaces, “Cas if you saw something in my head that you didn’t want to… I don’t blame you for leaving. Human’s sometimes think things y’know- fantasies or situations they wish they could have.”
“Jack, that was never the point!” Naomi threatens even though she’s the one trapped.
“Alright alright. It’s all downloaded, you comfy enough?” Dean asks already knowing the answer.
It was about an hour later that Dean finally pulled over onto a gravel road. Cas still shooting him odd glances, “Just hang on. Almost there.”
“Wait so you guys have all this and you two aren’t hitched?”
“Uh sorry. Nothing much, chores around the bunker, watching movies. I think Sam and Jody are dating.”
“You think you can angel the stuff from the garage into the hallway?”
Dean snaps out of his thoughts when he catches Naomi staring at him up and down.
I’m sorry. Miss you both. - Dad
Cas turns to face both Winchesters, “You guys had a lot on your plate with Mary passing recently. And I didn’t want to have you both worrying when we had a handle on it.”
“Who do you talk to on the phone almost every night?”
Dean slips his hand into Cas’ as they leave the barn, when they exit there’s a slew of family members all standing by the Impala.
“Doesn’t matter what you think,” Cas retorts with a tight-lipped smile.
“I understand Dean but please-”
Cas turned to Dean with a smirk on his face as Dean replied, “Tell me about it. I’m married to this one and every day I gotta pinch myself to know that I’m not dreaming ”
“No just the once. But I still have the meeting with her on Friday.”
Cas laughs, “I’m tired lets go see how soft our new bed is.”
“Hey, Dean?”
“Yeah?”
“Um,” Cas begins.
“What do you even want to take?”
"Ditto" Dean replies.
DEAN: Say the word and we’re there Jack.
“Dean it’s okay” Sam offered kindly.
CAS: Soon Dean. I’ll reach out to Jack. I’m sorry.
“Do you think he knows?” Dean asks Jo quietly.
They’re met with hugs from Gabe before being lead into the house. A library office looking space is to the right as soon as you enter, it’s decorated like a mini museum.
“Well, I’m happy to have an aunt now!”
believe it now.”
Naomi is standing before them, pacing back and forth in her grey suit. Her heels clicking against the white tiles of Heaven.
Dean and Cas exit the sheriff's office for what feels like the 100th time when Dean catches Cas humming ‘Grease Lightning’ under his breath.
“Hey Dean?” a solemn voice says from out of the shadows.
Cas is gonna love this! Dean thinks to himself and shakes his head to get rid of the thought.
“Welcome to the Dean Cave Sammy” Dean chides earning him a grunt from Sam. “Yeah, thanks for the invite…. Wait! You’re watching Raiders? Dude you know that’s one of my favorites!”
Dean literally cannot think properly, “That’s- that’s not- but-”
Jack warned him that Cas was in a happy hallucination, that breaking out of it wouldn’t be easy. So he’s not sure why he’s expecting Cas to jump back to life with a few meaningful sentences.
“What was what?” Sam questions.
Moments later Cas comes strolling into the room with a grin on his lips. Dean turns his head to look at him.
“Been there. Done that,” Dean calls from the kitchen.
Sam shakes his head “No biggie. Really Dean. Look how happy he is— that’s worth you getting congratulations at my wedding.”
“If there was anything you could do what would it be?” Jack asked.
Sam glances at Dean, “But wasn’t that the deal when you made all those angels?”
“Boyfriend?” Dean tries.
Cas shrugs “Sometimes doing things on your own isn’t the best though.”
“He’s watching Grease.”
Dean’s sipping at a glass of rum in the library alone, when his phone vibrates against the wooden table.
Cas looks over at him, “Jack?”
“Cas? What’s wrong-” he can’t even finish his sentence before Cas is snapping at him.
His mouth is dry, his hands are clammy, he can hear his heart beating in his ears. Sam and Cas are both staring at him but all he sees is Cas. Castiel the angel who rescued him from hell and put him back together. Who rebelled against heaven for him. Who always wanted to do the right thing to make sure the Winchesters- that Dean was okay.
“You make all these comments and I feel stupid for not understanding.”
“I know it’s easiest to think the worse, hell if he was dead at least I’d fucking know where he is but he’s not. I know.”
“Shit I didn’t think,” Sam starts.
Jack nods ,“Everything that I know,everything.”
They head inside the house and Dean grabs two beers and pops the tops off. He hands one to Cas who looks awkward as hell holding it in his hand.
“Like those douchebags will be of any help to him” Dean grunts.
Cas clicks his jaw in annoyance and Dean notices the sudden shift of energy. Cas isn’t looking at him, his shoulders square and tense. He’s contemplating something and Dean can’t look away.
Dean doesn’t mention any of this to Jack, as Jack would jump at the chance to use his powers and the kid does not need that right now. So he goes at it alone, looking up if there’s some way to track Cas or to summon him. He tries everything he can and inevitably, it breaks him.
Suddenly though, his phone starts ringing from his pocket. He pulls it out, looking briefly at the caller ID.
Cas looks at him blankly, but then his eyes soften “I saw-” then he starts to cough. Dean shushes him “Breathe. It’s okay…”
“Yeah?” Cas replies.
“Hang on, here’s Dean.”
“You good?” Sam chuckles
Sam rolls his eyes now glaring at him, “You’re an ass- not that you’ve ever stopped being one. I’m gonna go pack.”
Cas eyes him, and for a second Dean is afraid. Afraid of Cas. The hell?
“What?” He asked her, making everyone else look at him. But Sadie looked at her sister then they both got this awkward grin on their faces.
“I think it’s this one” Cas says, coming to scoop up the wrench and passes it to Dean’s hand.
They’ve been home for five days now. The case in New Mexico ended up being a hybrid Human-Chupacabra that also fed off humans. They took out the nest and eggs, figuring that should do the trick, and looking at reports now it seems it did.
“I haven’t heard from him in WEEKS Dean. I try to distract myself with school, thinking that everything is okay but I can’t stop worrying when I get a second to think. And now I can’t even find him?”
Dean hums, unsure if he should say anything but the words come out anyway “You’re drinking light beer and I think you’re kinda drunk off it?”
“I missed you so much Cas.”
“Hey. Hey” Dean whispered, pulling Jack against him “We’ll figure this out.”
“What apartment number?” Dean asks.
He feels a pang in his chest, it’s heavy like a hundred wet towels were thrown on top of him. He rubs above his peck, hoping that it’s muscle pain. That maybe he pulled something when he was moving books around. But it’s different, unlike any pain he’s felt before.
They get outside standing next to the Impala, the area around them dark and desolate of people.
The recliners he found online, some guy selling them on the other side of town. So he met up with the guy two days ago. $100 bucks cash for the recliners and another $100 for the guy to deliver them to the bunker, no questions asked. On his way from buying the 65 inch TV yesterday, someone had put ‘Free’ on a couch on their front driveway. Dean stopped, checked it out for bugs or rodents, and deemed it acceptable. He called the recliner dude and offered him $300 bucks if he’d help him move it. The guy was there in less than 20 minutes and Dean had the couch in the garage an hour later.
Cas had wandered over to Dean, pulling him in for a hug. Cas kissed his cheek as they had a moment.
“SORRY JACK!” Cas shouts enough for Jack to chuckle when he hears him.
“I dared you to kiss Dean Winchester,” She said back with a tone of attitude that her dare was not fulfilled.
"That's good Jack. I'm glad you talked." Jack just smiles awkwardly.
Jack nods sitting up to wipe his eyes, “Mhmm” he agrees.
“I love you Dean” Cas whispers only to him.
Gabe laughed “Book smart maybe. Street smart, not so much. That’s how me and Jack met. Did he ever tell you guys?”
“I think there are pieces of him in you.”
Across from the office space is the door to the garage, a front closet then next to that a half bath. They walk into the open space kitchen and living room. Off white counter tops matched with oak cabinets and stainless steel appliances. The counters lined with stools to sit and gather, the living room broken off by a grey comfy looking sectional. A large tv is plastered to the wall.
“He’s in Heaven and it’s not good I think?” Jack says.
“Okay. you know where the bathroom is, and you know where my room is right?” Jack nods.
It hits him. His hand flying up to that odd pain sitting in his chest.
“Dean please—” Mrs. Anderson begins.
“Whoa hey when did you get back?” Dean acknowledges.
“Uh, I’m having a hard time understanding how you can make this car systematic, hydromatic, and ultramatic without completely changing it for what it is.”
Dean looks at him, then at Cas, then at the house. Gabe is standing on the porch waving awkwardly. Dean looks back at Jack “Jack no you didn’t.”
They all let out their own little chuckle but Dean clears his throat “I have to thank you, Jack. For everything, you’ve done, for me- for us. I’m so sorry you had to get rid of your grace, I’ll spend every day trying to repay you for that but really thank you, Jack.”
Dean caught it in stride and he’s sure he heard half the hallway swoon. He smiled up at the group of his fellow football players cheering from down the way.
“Yeah, he’ll figure it out. He’s got a plan, if he sticks to it he’ll be back on track.”
“Dean. I’m here!”
Dean focuses on the road and pays no more attention to Sam and his ridiculous conclusions. He taps along to the song playing from the speakers, trying to numb his thoughts from going a million miles a minute. Otherwise, he’ll end right back up in that shit of a mood he was in three days ago.
Dean huffed “Sometimes the heart wants what the heart wants.”
Dean hesitates before answering with a quiet, “no.”
Cas nods “Yes of course.”
DEAN: Hey do you need any ice or water over there? I went and gave some to Ms. Johnsons down the street. She gave me pie not sure if I’m sharing ;)
Dean tossed Cas a sideway glance “And what does that mean?”
Dean tells no one about Jack drunk texting him and calling him dad. Especially when Cas has been the one to parent him over the years. Dean enjoys the idea of having Cas and Jack as his own little family but deep down he knows it’s only that, an idea. Dean has no say in Jack’s life, nor would he feel comfortable in taking on that responsibility. He doesn’t deserve that title, he hasn’t earned it. But still, the fact that Jack drunk texted him that. Dean is really at odds now.
She shakes her head, “Only recently did we realize what was happening with Castiel’s body. It doesn’t happen. It’s not supposed to happen. But when we realized, we had to act” he points between the two of them, “The sliver of an amount that you have has connected you to Castiel beyond the love that you feel for each other, that only happens with—”
By the time they both retreated into the house, the girls were tucked into bed while Sam, Jody, and Jack were half watching an episode of ‘Diners, Drive-in’s and Dives’
Dean chimes in on the phone “Jack what is going on? How long has Cas known about this?”
“You sure Jack?” Cas questions “We don’t have to meet you there if you’re uncomfortable?” “Oh okay. Got it. We’ll be there soon. Hang in there,” then he pockets his phone.
“No no. College. I’ve done research and I wanna go, but I need to apply and that takes high school grades and such.”
Dean goes silent, he’s usually okay with all the supernatural things they deal with. But this, being bonded to Cas beyond previous terms. Feeling him all this time, dreaming of him so vividly he’s ashamed at the comfort and baffled at the complexity.
“I won’t tell you if you’re gonna overreact.”
“First call Jack.”
“You wanna stay in Cas’ room kiddo?” Dean asks softly.
“BECAUSE YOU’RE KILLING HIM!” Naomi looks down at the ground away from them all. Jack clenches his fist as Naomi and her goons cry out in pain “SAY SOMETHING!”
“We’re having a baby” Dean announced.
“Yeah?”
And then Sam was already opening the back door and sitting down.
“Cas you joining us?” Sam says. Dean would kick him if he could.
“Okay, Jess your turn truth or dare?” Jo turns to Jessica Moore and smiles mischievously.
Cas licks his chapped lips, “Dean no. I saw, pain. Pain that I was causing. You hated me cause I was an angel… and I knew what I wanted for so long but that moment, I realized... it was time. When we kissed I knew we couldn’t… me being an angel you being human. But I know what I felt, what I still do. It made it clearer that I wanted to become human, not just enjoy parts of it. But then I saw the pain of me being an angel and what it was doing to you. I knew right then I wanted to get rid of my grace but then I couldn’t! And all I wanted was to come back to you and Jack. But it wouldn’t leave and I didn’t understand!”
“Yeah ditto,” Dean replies at the same time.
Cas kisses him tenderly “If you like it then maybe you should put a ring on it?”
JACK: Damn. He rescues you and you repay him by stabbing him. How nice.
So with Cas hanging around, and learning how to use Google and Instagram and Pinterest. He also learned how to take a selfie (Dean was washing dishes well Cas was sat at the kitchen table. He wanted to learn. So Dean stepped aside, told Cas to hold his phone up and click. A selfie of the two of them pressed cheek to cheek was born. Cas sent it to Jack who replied “You two make a cute couple” and Dean pretended he didn’t read that) Dean’s mood (not-surprisingly) does a complete 180.
“Oh, that’s a weird term.”
It was Cas’s turn to hold her again, sitting in the rocking chair with the tiny pink blanket nestled into his arms. His hair a mess, bags under his eyes, and a few buttons were undone on his shirt. But the smile remained permanently on his lips as he stared affectionately at his baby girl— their baby girl.
He doesn’t even have to knock before Jack is flying out and tackling Cas into a hug.
Cas looks intrigued “Yeah I’d like that.”
“Dean it’s me! I’m so sorry.”
Sam snorts again, “Yeah whatever you say, Dean.”
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading.
And as much as he rather not acknowledge being thought of as some fatherly figure, he does become a bit more active in Jack's life. Sure they texted every other week or so before, mostly about movies or when Jack wanted to vent about Cas (Dean would never tell Cas that) but now Jack sends random questions or a funny photo, or a request to play iMessage pool daily. And Dean usually texts him every other day to see if Jack’s not busy. and when Jack’s not, Dean will call him. They’ll talk about their day (Jack definitely talks more) for about five or ten minutes and then go back to their day. It’s nice, Dean feels like he has a friend outside of his usual crew. Someone who will (at most times) talk about normal things.
Dean looks up on the wall at the little angel decoration that’s hanging about the door, Charlie had sent it when the news of little Grace being born had spread around. Dean was unsure of how Cas was going to react to it but he was the one who called up Charlie immediately after it had arrived. They had talked for almost an hour and after Dean had helped him put it up on the wall.
Dean instructs silently for Sam to go around back. While Dean inspects the front, violently kicking in the door that she had entered into. He waits, then ducks into the empty, dusty gas station.
“Is your phone dead? I tried calling you it kept going to voicemail.”
Jack though runs over and helps Sam stand. Jack whispers something to him then both of them giving reassuring nods as they all stare at Naomi.
“Yeah. Exciting. Yeah.”
“You think he’ll be alright?” Cas questions.
“Deep breaths hun. And hey, congratulations.”
“I-” Dean starts but isn’t sure what to say at all. “ I want to tell you... but I feel like I'll just mess up something we don't even have.”
That was kind of a lie it was usually the same sort of deal, do something gross or lick someone. It wasn’t all that exciting but when you were as high on life and tipsy on booze as Cas and Charlie were it was probably the best game in the entire existence.
“I’ve never seen Sam so excited.”
JACK: I know you told me to tell you when I talked to my TA but I only wanted to bring it up when I had good news.
“That movie, Frozen. It’s everywhere. On commercials, on food, the song sometimes plays on the radio and I think Jack even knows it. The Let it Go song.”
“Everyone knows Dean, the way you make googly eyes at him, always become this macho man when he walks by you’ve been dying to talk to him I can see it in Maths and last semester in History and I just have a feeling that he may like you too.”
“Maybe. Why do you wanna know?”
“Yeah.”
“This isn’t goodbye Dean” Sam said.
“What!” Dean yells, confused as hell by the sudden change of attitude.
Sam sighs, rubbing a hand across his face “As long as you’re okay?”
They stay quiet for a few moments, breathing and looking at each other. Making sure this is real before Dean says, “Can I ask you something though?”
“Why’s that?”
It didn’t take long for them to pack up their things. It took longer for them to finally say goodbye to the bunker for good. The place had become home for some time now and it brought so much comfort. Dean finally having his own room, the Dean cave, the garage. Hell even the water pressure, Dean will miss.
There’s a large screen along one wall, eight movie theatre type chairs face the screen. There’s a neon bar behind them along the back wall filled with different bottles. Followed by a spare bedroom and bathroom in the corner. Again it’s all dark greys and plaid textures that make up the furnishings.
The hallway forks off in front of the bonus room, left or right. They go left first, coming to two guest rooms with a bathroom to share. The right side has the master bedroom. It’s giant. A king size bed sits in the middle and theres still room to move around.
“Would you laugh if I said yes?” Cas asks carefully.
They finished up the Dallas case in less than 48 hours of arriving. But then Cesar had called, asking them for help in New Mexico with a much larger case. Some mass mutilations happening one town over.
“Or we could...?” Dean raises an eyebrow.
Dean slumped again the window, his head throbbing but he lets out a low cackle, “I only do that shit cause I care. It isn’t a bad thing.”
“That about sums it up” Dean adds
Cas is lying there, his arms across his stomach. His face is sunken in, his hair a mess, and his lips almost a grey color. He looks like he’s only sleeping but the color of his skin is telling that he isn’t well.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Sams offers.
“Dude, were you having a nightmare?” Sam asks Dean’s eyes focus and he can suddenly see the concern written all over Sam’s face.
Dean squeezed at Cas’ shoulder and his lower back where his hands were still holding him.
JACK: ok.
So yeah, he hasn’t made any real move to talk to Castiel, didn’t even know if the guy liked guys. So Dean continued to go about his day to day life, wishing for some kind of miracle that Castiel would make the first move, because hell if Dean would even try. Afraid of offending the kid or saying something to hurt him when all he wanted was to hold his hand and look into his eyes forever. Man, he's such a sap.
“No. No. He went away for a reason. Sometimes people do that. And you gotta give them the benefit of the doubt to keep yourself sane.”
“Looks fucking sweet. Thanks for your help Cas.”
“Yeah, we did.”
“Oh, right,” Dean says quietly.
They both stare at each other.
It takes a while before Cas’s next message comes through but it’s a long one.
With Jack not coming home for at least over a week, Dean suggests they look outside of neighboring states to do a road trip again. It has been a few weeks since they stayed in a motel.
“Perfect. You won’t hear from him till you wanna alright?” Jack chuckles “Thanks Sam, I owe you one.”
So instead he looks back up at the Tv, realizing they aren’t even a whole 10 minutes into the movie. Awesome.
“Okay. Okay... Jack… Yeah we’ll be right there,” Cas replies into the phone, “Yup give us a few minutes alright?”
“Heeey” Cas started “That’s not nice.”
Dean feels his chest thump ten times faster, “You’re positive he wants us... both?”
“Hourish?”
Dean stands quickly “Maybe I should go say bye.”
“Hell they could sick Cas on us for all we know” Sam adds.
“It’s fine Dean. We can look out for each other.”
“It wasn’t a long conversation but he asked me about school. He had the nerve to ask me about you. I told him he doesn’t get to ask me that when he up and leaves.”
“Hey, kiddo” Dean whispers, rubbing at his back. It takes a second before Jack is pulling back, wiping at his red-rimmed eyes and mumbling, “Thank you for coming.”
“We’ll see you soon kid,” Dean grins before turning down the hallway Cas in tow.
Cas smiles, “That's a good plan, Jack.”
“Loud and clear Jack.”
Sam collects his big brother into a tight embrace. And it’s like everything comes tumbling back in ten folds. That he’s been masking his hurt for days because it’s what he’s supposed to do, but he can’t do it anymore, he only wants Cas back. For them to talk it out, to come to some solution because as time has told them again and again, they’re it for each other. There’s no way to separate them and even if they have to stay platonic, Dean’s okay with that cause at least he has Cas back.
“Not that I can recall?”
Sam’s silent, fiddling with a loose string on his jeans, “I’m sorry man.”
Sam shrugs, “It’s strange that’s for sure.”
“You’re ridiculous” Cas shakes his head as he begins towards the door.
Cas suddenly looks surprised, “Right! That’s why I came to find you actually. He called, said he’s doing fine. He missed the first three days with enrolling kinda late. But he said he stayed in the library till 11 two nights in a row to get caught up.”
“Cas it is then, Cas.”
Dean whimpers, it’s so painfully Cas’s voice but they’re hunting a freaking siren he can’t fall victim to it.
CAS: We’re okay for now. The fire department dropped some coolers of cold bottles to hand out.
“I think if you were to try it on literally anyone. It probably wouldn’t work.”
Cas sighs, looking down at the floor before gaining the courage to speak “... Jack’s out there, making friends, applying for jobs, going to college. He’s young and so full of life. He’s about to experience so much good of humanity because he’s out of this mess” He gestures to the three of them “And sometimes, I get jealous of that. Cause yeah Jack has powers but he’s also part human. So once he’s out there he gets to make mistakes, to learn from them, gets to feel emotion, and body sensations. And maybe one day, he’ll love someone, he’ll get a real job, he’ll get a house, he’ll retire, he’ll have grandkids. He’ll live a full life going through some of humanity's greatest obstacles and greatest adventures, all in a different way than I’ll ever get to.” Cas sighs sounding defeated, “The human part of himself is thriving and sometimes I wish I still had apart of that in me.”
So yeah, there’s been some helpful tips and some insightful therapy things that’s forced himself to think outside Dean Winchester’s regular habits.
Dean drops to the ground, clutching his abdomen, certain that he has broken a rib or two. He lets out two large breaths, trying to lessen the pain when the word hits him like a punch to the stomach. Soulmates? Dean thinks, feeling dizzy with emotion. She’s playing him Dean know this, she’s trying to get him to submit, get them to give in to what she wants. Dean knows that she knows he would do anything to save Cas. Just like he would for Dean. Dean’s so tired of their bond being used against them.
A week later, they’re on a small hunt in Illinois, nothing but a vengeful spirit so a casual salt and burn will do the trick. Except that they’re at a loss trying to figure out who they need to salt and burn. Sam’s got them at the local library after having been at the police station and had spoken to the neighbors.
“Yeah, his phone's dead” Dean replies.
“Of course Jack. I’ll talk to Sam.”
“Don’t eat it all! Did angel school not teach you sharing is caring,” Dean says half-joking, half-serious.
“She came to take me, Dean, I didn’t go. But I will- I have too” he sounds lost not upset though.
Jody once again smiled up at Dean “I’ll take good care of him.”
“That’s what I thought! You’ve got nothing. I’m unstoppable.”
Cas lets out a heavy sigh, “I know you mean well Dean, but I’ve come to the realization that I will never understand your human references and I will have to live in the dark about it.”
“Cas” Dean croaks. Cas feels over his body before springing into Dean’s arms. Dean almost falls off the bed but holds him tight.
There’s silence on Jack's end.
“I dunno Sammy. It was weird. He was drunk off four beers, he was sporting some pretty thick facial hair and he was yawning. It was like he was human but he… he could still use his powers no problem” Dean half lies.
“I guess,” Cas says and takes a sip. He grimaces but tries to hide it from Dean and that’s when Dean laughs.
“Dean?” he could hear Cas calling his name but it sounded distant and hollow.
And unfortunately, it’s not the warmest welcome.
“But it's not though! Is it! Dad is stuck in Heaven and maybe dying at the head of Angels. Sam left! Because you’ve been a wallowing drunk mess on the brink of explosion.” Dammit, Sam did call him “I’ve got finals coming up in less than a week that I’m barely prepared for. And I missed out on a date that I was really looking forward too and-”
CAS: Well done Jack! You showed initiative. That’s all anyone could ever ask.
The smile that’s usually permanently on Jack’s face returns for a brief moment, “See you later dad.”
“Dammit! I really thought I had you” She took off her sunglasses, zipped down her hoodie and took her hat off. Dean was frozen at the sight of her, unsure if she was actually real.
“We will though. Soon. I just don’t wanna start telling people then things not plan out y’know.”
“Same here” Charlie adds.
“Night Jack.”
The following morning Dean went to check on Sam only to see Jody feeding him ice chips. Jody smiled and Sam tried too, but still grimaced in pain.
“Where we meeting him?”
“What?” Dean questions.
A kid about the same height as Dean walks into the room and sits down at the desk in front of him. He’s dressed in a blue dress shirt and black dress pants, a tie hangs around his neck neatly pressed and his blue eyes sparkle as they catch the sunlight. His hair is brushed to the side and combed to perfection and his smile is radiant, that it lights up the whole room.
“Did you and daddy get to cuddle this morning?!” Dean coo’s to the little one “Yeah, he’s a pretty good cuddler huh. He gives the best hugs too. When you’re older you’ll see how much better his hugs make you feel. It’s like magic.”
“I love you baby brother. You’ll always be the most important thing to me.”
Sam waivers, “Well yeah I can but is he sure? It’s not a walk in the park, college is a lot of discipline and time. And... he’s never even gone to school.”
Dean gives Cas an easy look, “Hey you’ve been kinda busy saving humankind. Give yourself a break man,” then turns to Sam “Jack wants us to make fake documents for him to apply to school. That’s why he called me. Can you do that?”
Jack lets out an aggravated sigh “I’m sorry Dean! I asked him why he left and he wouldn’t give me a straight answer. Then I asked if he was human and he kept saying he has a handle on it. Whatever ‘it’ is. And that he’ll come home soon.”
Dean paused before scratching at the back of his neck “I think it’s too soon...”
Cas’s face falls.
Dean gives Cas a glare “It’s SAM! His opinions are already screwed up as it is.”
“Of course.”
“That’s amazing you guys. Really” Sam said genuinely.
Cas is crying, Dean can feel the wetness against his cheek. Maybe he is too? He can’t tell.
Dean sighs as he looks at Cas who’s getting hugs from Claire and Jack. Cas pulling back to officially introduce them. Claire and Jack shake hands and Jack introduces her to Gabe as she introduces Kaia. They begin chatting as Cas meets Dean’s eyes. He walks over to him with purpose, kissing him on the mouth whispering “Thank you for being my good thing too.”
Jack goes quiet, clearly thinking but Dean speaks up again “Jack don’t beat yourself up about it. You got to talk to him, that’s something alright? Chalk it up as him doing his parental duties and don’t try to read into it too much.”
Dean’s heart hammered, “keyword being: for now” he had said before pulling at Cas’ waist to kiss his cheek. Sam had rolled his eyes “what would you like then Cas?”
“DEAN I CAN’T FIND HIM!” Jack shouts, “I’m the most powerful being in the world and I can’t find my own father! There’s only one explanation.”
Cas’s face is frozen as if he got caught.
It was the third period on the first day of senior year. Dean had history and was walking with Jo to class, he had stepped into the room the odd smell of old tea came from the steaming cup on Mr. Youngman’s desk with a stack of papers ready to be handed out. Dean wasn’t looking forward to learning on the first day. They’d just left summer mode yesterday, there was no way his brain was working. That’s when he turned to look at the desks, Jo called him over to a set of two in the corner but all Dean could notice was the brunette man scribbling into his notebook on the other side of the classroom. It was like the guy knew Dean was staring when he looked up and piercing blue eyes had met his green ones. Taking Dean as far back as ever, Dean just knew he had to know this guy. Except he did the exact opposite, ducked his head and went over to sit with Jo.
Dean’s trying to put together the piece of his dream while saying “we'll leave at 5 instead of 4. Now go back to bed.”
DEAN: Oh you don’t have to?
“The best from the best” Dean grins.
Sam's laughter echoes around the room.
His heart aches in his chest. This wasn't the way things were supposed to go.
So that’s how Sam goes scurrying to his girlfriend, to get away from Dean who’s a wallowing mess. Missing something he never had in the first place.
“Fine. She did call, so I came.”
Grace Kelly Winchester was born on June 30th. The hottest day in June that San Francisco had ever had. She had big blue eyes thanks to Iris but all Dean could see was that they match Cas’s almost perfectly.
“CAS!” He tries to shout but again, silence. Cas’s face is looking at him so innocently yet full of affection. Dean starts to panic, “CAS! CAS! CASTIEL CAN YOU HEAR ME!?” he shouts.
Dean considers this for a second and sees no reason to argue, “Yeah that’d be good.”
Dean chuckles, “Yeah... I should’ve told him. He can recite these movies as if they were written on the back of his hand.”
Dean shoots her a look “So you need me then” he accuses.
They had movies nights daily (there was still a lot that Cas hadn’t seen) but Cas loved to use the internet. He loved to find things for him and Dean to do. They’d go to farmers markets and get fresh fruits and veggies. There was a new brewery opening in Lawrence so they went to check it out (Dean was all over that) Cas even got them out hiking and the view of the top of rolling hills. Sure Dean complained, hiking? For sport? He would much rather pass but Cas had done all this work. So off they went, a trek that was about an hour on foot and made it to the top just before sunset.
Cas still hasn’t responded to Dean’s confession, but he’ll take saving Cas over anything right now “All I want is forever with you.”
“Annnnnd that’s why I’m not telling you anything” Jack laughs.
“Not a lot. Bar’s been doing good, like really good.”
“Yeah what he said” Dean retorts, smirking. Cas now rolls his eyes.
“So what? You’re gonna have liver failure and start bar fights on a Tuesday because of that?”
Naomi snorts “Well then… Cas do you want to elaborate?” Dean turns his gaze to him, and Cas looks stunned.
Dean opens his mouth to argue but Jack cuts him off, “No more Dean Winchester Pity party. Go save Dad.”
“I should probably call him then!” Jack announces.
“Good?” Dean asks standing off to the side.
Sam knocks his body against Dean and gives him a look as if ‘you alright?’ Dean just nods as they do their silent brotherly check-up as he scans the area one last time.
“What?” Cas garbles around his toothbrush, well Dean spits and rinses.
“No problem Cas,” Dean smiles to himself before turning back in his seat. Thankfully, Sam is entering back into the garage when Dean turns the engine of the impala on.
“Don’t overthink it, Jack.”
“Dads it’s fine” Jack cut in making both of them stop talking. “If he hadn’t called me and wanted to work things out, I wouldn’t have given him the time of day.”
Dean likes Jo, she's the ultimate package. Pretty and sweet but also has this snarky side to her that makes her unbearable sometimes. She can wit her way through any situation and yet get that person to be best friends with her. She is the captain of the cheer team but also plays a mean beer pong, loves to party and entertain, and gets away with pretty much everything. Dean could not love her more.
“Cas can we talk?” He steps closer to the guy, almost reaching out to grab him by the arm. Cas turns his head and looks into Dean’s worrying eyes, “Alone, please.”
“I heard from Cas.”
Dean parks on the other side of the highway. Both he and Sam look out the window at the building for any sign of life.
“Gotta go Dad bye!”
“So? A measly, overly vague text doesn’t mean shit! Easy enough to type those words out to get me off his back. And maybe sure, there’s some truth to it fine! But he still left— after everything!”
Dean narrows his eyes at him, “No stop. What is going on?”
“Not you’re fault kiddo.”
Dean’s positive he could hear the smugness in Jack’s breathing, Dean knows he’s walked into a trap with this one.
Sometimes Dean doesn’t know if it’s a look from love or pain. Sometimes that look hurts Dean more than Cas. These last few months, caring for a newborn has been an adjustment period like they always knew it would. But for them, it’s been even weirder. They’ve settled into this parenting thing pretty easily. Maybe with them both being natural caregivers, it was just second nature. No time to think about it. So it’s made their marriage a lot easier, they haven’t argued a ton, they get what the other needs, they’ve become a real team in some ways. So much that Dean almost feels their bond is even stronger than before. Dean could not see himself having this life with anyone else.  They’ve made each other better, stronger and hell maybe even fallen deeper for the other.
“Oh right right. Um Sebastian these are my…” he pauses his eyes flicking back and forth between both men, but Dean glances at Cas who’s looking optimistic. He hates that his heart tightens, before giving Jack a nod of his blessing.
Dean and Cas gave Jody and Sam a few minutes to say goodnight to their girls before they called for a taxi to take them back to the airport. Their flight to Mexico leaving at midnight.
JACK: & I”M SA fe :)
Cas is clutching at Dean’s arm tightly. Dean doesn’t even know what to think, feeling like he’s walking through a house that belongs in a magazine.
“Not like you were any better” Cas side eyed him before grabbing his hand.
“It’s almost like you had more of Cas’s grace in your body than he has in his.”
Dean suddenly realizes he doesn’t remember the last time he saw Cas, has it been 2 weeks? He and Sam dealt with a Tulpa in Iowa two Saturdays ago and Sam had broken a rib. Luckily Cas was with them, as he should be, and fixed Sammy right up. But… was that the last time? Surely he’s seen Cas in between then, but he has kinda been busy y’ know not thinking about how Chuck smited their mother with a snap of his fingers.
Dean had scoffed “Sammy I practically raised you. Enjoy your vacation, you both deserve it.”
“True. But remember Dean, if she gets to you-.”
“It’s fine. It worked out anyway.”
“Give me the phone Sam,” Dean says with his hand out.
“JACK?!” Dean tries to yell but Cas and Jack continue to bicker. He hangs up a few minutes later, confused as ever.
“But Dean and I-”
“Why the sudden drop in?” Sam asks, book forgotten about and now standing by Dean’s workbench.
“Pictures? Please tell me you have pictures!”
Dean goes full defensive mode, “no!”
“You’ve handled worse Dean,” Sam quips.
“How could we not have fun at a Harvelle party?” Dean smiles and winks at her. “Awe Winchester flattery will get you nowhere in my house. Now drink!”
Jack is silent on the other end. The only sign that he hasn’t hung up is that there's no dial tone ringing out.
Unfortunately, tonight was bad. His trauma was creeping up on him in ways that he hadn’t felt in years. Booze and hunting usually did the trick in keeping his demons at bay, but over these years of retirement, he’d forgotten how to cope, even if they were bad methods.
“Frozen.”
“Hey hey hey. It’s okay… Jack… it’s okay” Dean pulls him into a hug but Jack pushes him away.
After the drive home and sleeping the most of yesterday away. Dean woke up early, got groceries, did a beer run, and more gas. Did some laundry, cleaned the kitchen, vacuumed out the Impala, and took her for a wash. All well Cas helped Sam find some lore that Jody was asking for.
“Hey hey, don’t think like that. He’s discovering himself probably. Or whatever. He just needs space.”
Cas looks at Dean, and Dean swallows hard. Realizing how close they are right now, he’s quick in letting go of Cas’ arm taking a large step back.
“Great. thank you so much for agreeing to talk” Castiel says before beginning to turn away.
“Cas?” Dean tries, but he’s shushed by Naomi.
He doesn’t concentrate for the next 15 minutes as Mrs.Anderson goes over the homework that will be due. He only bounces his knee, waiting impatiently for class to be over. The bell sounds and everyone gets up to leave, except Castiel and Dean.
Cas looks sad. He’s frowning well his shoulders sag, and he averts Dean’s stare. The only sound of the clock ticking can be heard throughout the whole kitchen. Sam’s not even typing, only staring at his screen wishing he wasn’t in the room at this moment.
They’re both silent for a while.
“Have you been home the whole time?”
“Then go!” Dean yells “Leave. Like Cas did. He clearly doesn’t want anything to do with me, why should you?!”
Dean froze “Oh… um. It’s Jack.”
“Cas I-I”
Jack pauses before stepping around looking down at Dean “I’m not sure if this will hurt but I’ll try to be as gentle as I can.”
The morning began with a tour of the ship.
Israfel nodded, and a tear ran unbidden down her cheek. “It’s me, K’al.” The pair embraced tightly, and Israfel buried her hose in her husband’s hair as she started to cry. “Husband…” The pair pulled back a bit, and K’al reached up to wipe the tears from the angel’s eyes. "I'm in your Heaven..."
“I know, Kael. Thanks.”
“We’re through the relay in 30 seconds.” Joker looked back over his shoulder at Shepard, who was standing there already armed and armoured. “This is it.”
Dean looked down to Cas. “It’s my job.” He sighed. “It sucks, it’s a big steaming pile of crap, but I do it because it’s the job.”
“So, it’s kind of like fuzzy logic?” Sam asked. He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and looked up at Legion. “Like being able to deviate from rigidly-defined programming and form new conclusions, kinda like EDI is able to do?”
Castiel smiled. “Cats have an uncanny ability to reach places that no one else can.” As if on cue, they heard a high-pitched trill and looked down to see Ninja rubbing against and wrapping his tail around Garrus’ right leg. Garrus reached down and gave the cat a scratch behind the ears, which elicited an affectionate headbutt in response. “He seems to like you,” Castiel observed.
“Really.” Shepard looked at Castiel as if the angel had just sprouted three extra pairs of legs.
“So,” New Guy said. “These are our stowaways.” Muscles had gotten Sam and Dean down on their knees, hands on their heads, a bloodied and dazed Castiel slumped on the deck next to them in Pretty Boy’s grip. New Guy walked out to the middle of the cargo bay and looked at Castiel for a moment. “Major Alenko,” he jibed at Pretty Boy, “When did you start playing rough?”
“So…” Shepard said slowly. “That’s--”
, and Esteban over there will let his twitchy trigger-finger do the talking.” He jerked his head back over his shoulder to indicate a dark-skinned blue-eyed man with a neatly trimmed goatee levelling an assault rifle in their direction.
Jack lets out a snicker, “Alright, I’ll phone him. Uh, thanks again, guys. I’ll talk to you both soon.” “Bye Jack,” Both Dean and Cas say at the same time before Dean hangs up. Cas lets out a large exhale, “What a relief. I’m so glad he got in.”
Dean: Have fun. Love you too.
“Hey, Dean!” Jack’s upbeat voice rings.
“Wait, you think it was an Angel?”
“This is where we first met” Cas says breathlessly, and when he turns to face Dean. The man is on one knee. Cas can’t help the little gasp that comes from his mouth.
Sam looks up from the trunk giving Dean a shifty smile, “Uh yeah… Some weird markings have shown up around the falls. Claire’s off doing a hunt with Kaia in Tennessee, and Alex is on a retreat in Hawaii, so I offered up my help.”
“Okay. Okay. I believe you.”
“Best son ever” Dean mumbles a bit too loud that Cas elbows him. Jack just snorts.
Dean snorts, “Tell me about it.”
The LAST thing he and Cas need is some movie with sexual innuendos and mature subject matter. Situations that Cas might not totally get and ask Dean to explain. Or worse, Cas understanding them completely and Dean having to live with that. Dean already knows he’s gonna spend the evening think about Cas’ tongue in his own mouth and his knee in his crotch. As if he hadn’t been doing that the previous four nights. Great.
“What?”
“You sure?”
Cas shrugs, “Sometimes I feel like it would be easier for a lot of things. But then I’d know what it’s like to get cold or have the hiccups. I could finally get Dean’s dumb references and I could finally relate to you all instead of feeling like an outsider.”
“What’s wrong with him?” Jack asks, sounding like a little kid.
Naomi genuinely looks like a mess, she’s shaking, her suit unbuttoned in disarray, her hair disheveled. But she stumbles over to Sam’s body and touches his forehead. He gasps awake.
“No. No it certainly isn’t” Dean walked slowly closer to the bed, crouching to be at Sam’s level “We had a hell of a time Sammy. We did what we could and I wouldn’t change any of it for a second.”
“Jack…”
“Come on Castiel. Go get your boy” Jo eggs on. But Cas doesn’t move, doesn’t get up, or even look at Dean and Dean is terrified. His worst nightmare and best dream all coming true all because stupid Jo had to intervene. Dean is over this, over feeling what he feels for Cas and being scared of it all.
“I think they put up some kind of warding against me? It took more of my power than I thought. I don’t think Sam made it up here. I’ve looked everywhere. Sorry.”
“Dad it’s fine.”
“Enough to hear you two arguing over dumb movies.”
“If that's too heavy on your angel juice it’s fine. We can go back to Sam, I just don’t wanna wake him.”
Dean stops Castiel with his lips, crashing down on one another and letting all his feeling be pressed into the form of his lips on Cas’ and damn it feels good. And when Cas unfreezes and kisses back it was like fireworks on the Fourth of July.
“How am I supposed to believe you?”
Sam grunts, “Come on Dean don’t bug him. He’s probably out celebrating.”
Dean’s on his third ‘city archive’ book and he’s already yawning. It’s about 8 pm on a Saturday they should be at a bar, eating greasy burgers and drinking beer. Not being nerds cooped up in an empty library.
“To put it in words that you both will understand, I’m making baby… systematic… hydromatic, ultramatic…”
“Thought you knew?” Sam mumbles, “Sorry man.”
But in the end, most of the great memories of high school will be held in this backyard. Day or night this place holds where Dean broke his arm in ninth grade for climbing the big oak tree, or almost died from being held underwater in the pool by Jo. Or how he almost died again by trying to get away from Jo who tried to put makeup on him. He had climbed up onto the shed in the backyard, only to end up falling through the rickety old roof.
Dean grins, “I’m researching buying pool tables.”
“He’s been on campus for almost two weeks and he’s already invited to shit wow.” Cas shrugs, “He’s... adjusting.”
“Cas?” Dean answers.
“Yeah. Like Jody never calls me when she has questions about monsters. It’s only to yell at me for not spending time with Sam.”
“I know.”
Dean hates that he wants to ask about Cas. If the Angel said anything about holding the guy hostage or something, but instead he focuses’ on Jack “Are you safe right now?”
“I know what you told me! But when you sound heartbroken on the phone because he left I can’t let that go.”
“Is it a problem?”
“These Angels don’t deserve shit.”
They’ve come close multiple times to finding a way in without using Jack’s powers, but every time it somehow comes up with a loose end.
When Cas and Jack got home they brought pizza home with them for lunch, Dean was thankful for some kind of greasy thing for once. They ate in the living room, watching the last 45 minutes of Toy Story 3 when Sadie looked over at Dean from the other couch.
“I’m serious. Whatever the girls overheard Sam and Jody saying, they’re right.”
Dean is kind of confused by this question “Why would I tell you about my feelings when I have enough trouble telling them to the people I care about.”
Dean feels like he got the wind knocked out of him. He saw that… all of that. It felt so real, and now… it’s all making sense. “I saw it too...”
“Cas- I can’t see you!” he barks out.
“Thanks, Dad.”
Sam shifts his weight as he too now grows a daring grin, “Okay, so you building the cave was what? A ‘personal project’ and not some way to spend time with Cas without essentially asking him?”
“What about you Dad?” Jacks voice broke his thoughts.
Sam looks up, “You’re kidding.”
DEAN: Come home.
Dean mutters some other gibberish about how he wants to smite her before finding the keys and settling.
Dean was up and out of his chair quickly but not without reassuring the little ones “It’s just Jack. This is his house too remember.”
“Please stop apologizing! It’s not going to fix anything! We need to do something! We- maybe I should’ve gone when they asked me too. Maybe he needed help then? I don’t know why they wouldn’t have said that they had him… ugh fuck! I’m so angry and tired and I miss him and I hate seeing you such a mess without him. I’m so… over it all.”
As much as Dean wants to focus on whatever new equation Mrs. Anderson was going on about, Dean couldn't help but notice Castiel's hands twiddle, and his stock nature got even more stock. His head then turned slightly, causing Dean's heart rate to pick up as if he wanted to turn to say something but couldn’t muster up the courage.
“Hey! You said!” Dean growls and Benny lets out a roaring laugh.
“I may have told him alcohol was more your thing over mine. Sorry.”
“That's Sammy’s old school.”
Cas pauses stumped, “Huh” he whispers.
They both were silent, Dean knew Sam was crying like he was. Hiding tears behind coughs and groans.
“We argued for a bit before he said that this life wasn’t fair, but that he promised he was going to make it right. But then he-” Jack chokes on the last word.
“Do you need anything before I-”
“ya it’s me you idiots who don’t know how to text a girl once in a while!”
Dean couldn’t help grinning as he elbowed Cas in annoyance.
Cas looked at Dean “Out of everything we’d heard that wasn’t one of them.”
“Cas” Dean says in a calming whisper. Ready to explain himself till he’s blue in the face.
Jack frowns, “you’ll have to break him out of it.”
“Me too” Dean nods, even though he has no clue how he could.
“Alright.”
“We’ll come up with some plan alright?”
“Could put them on your laptop so you could watch them anytime?”
“Will try too.”
“Then good, I’m happy for you,” Dean said honestly.
They finish Raiders of The Lost Ark and wait for Sam who comes back into the room freshly showered, PJ clad, and holding two bowls. Sam passes a bowl to Dean and then a cold beer (alright Sam can stay) well Sam gets comfy on the couch behind them.
“Yeah, mix up with a delivery. I offered to stay cause I don’t open tomorrow,” Sebastian rambles with a nervous laugh.
Jack scoffs “It was a whole thing I don’t want to get into it. But I’m fine, really Dean.”
He hugged Cas first and then Dean, squeezing them tight.
JACK: Yeah he paired me up with another student who went over the test with me. I’m part of her study group now.
“Hey Jack” Sam calls “Why don’t we go call your aunt Jody. Give her the good news.”
“Oh.”
“Gimme a sec!” Dean sits up to wipe off the beer he spilled on himself. Jesus fuck he wasn’t expecting any of that to come out of Cas’ mouth. He knows Cas’ eyes are on him but Dean doesn’t trust himself right now, knowing if he looks over he’ll do something stupid.
Dean feels frozen especially with two sets of eyes on him but he’s trying to process all of this. Cas wants to be human? Or included in some parts of it? And he wants a job? A house? Someone, to share that with? He wants to forget heaven and hell and monsters, something Dean’s been internally craving for years but could never gain the courage to do. But Cas… Cas wants that?
