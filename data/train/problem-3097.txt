“Sam, what are you doing?” Nova inquires with a confuse look on her face.
It's already dark when Sam pulls over to an old run-down house. Nova's phone should be around here, hopefully on her alive body.
She heard the engine turning off, and after a few seconds, the driver’s door opened.
She stayed back, working with her magic, trying to find Sam, but nothing.
Two years sober. Until tonight.
“No, that’s not what I’m asking. You don’t believe that what we’re doing will work.” she nods, adjusting herself on the seat, still keeping her eyes closed.“Yeah, our plan is pretty weak. And yes, I really don’t care what will happen to me,” she stops, takes a deep breath, and pauses for a moment.
First time I try writing a story, a FanFiction, actually. Please report any mistakes and thanks for being here!
“Yeah, but I doubt he’s gonna see it.” she states, hoping to be proved wrong.
“I don’t give a fuck, Nova. I don’t care if you’re losing yourself or crap like that. I gave you thousands of reasons why you should get your shit right. What do you think? That I don’t miss him? That I don’t want him back? I do fucking want my brother back, but I don’t do coke in a stall.” Sam spits out, looking down at her.
Nova got close to him, on the verge of throwing up.
She pulled over, not sure to remember how she arrived there.
“That’s some fucked up shit, Sam. I don’t even know where to start to look at it.” Nova is sincere, with no intent to justify herself. She knows that’s even if she’s trying her best, she still has a lot of things to get straight.
“You are a witch, aren’t you?” he asks, and Nova nods confused. How does he knows that’s? “Good, you should be way more open to them” he smirks, blowing a glowing dust on her face. Nova’s eyes are totally white “let’s see if they can use you as vessel.” he mutters. “What? What you did to her?” Sam snaps up. “Calm down, she’s fine.” he says scoffing Sam.
Dean isn’t really the kinda guy who opens up any time he feels down.
“Nice place, huh? The music is great.” the girl says while getting up. Nova hums in agreement.
She hugs him, without knowing what to do, the words stuck in her throat.
Dean was the first person to ever care about her.
"Now, can we go? I need to sleep.” Sam sighs. They approach the exit, but Nova grabs Sam’s arm
Something went wrong, and they captured Sam.
Agent Miller heads back to his car, and for the first time the man in the car moves, tilting his head. He stares at Nova with his blue eyes.
"Why the cop are looking for you? What did you do now? I checked, we aren't late with any payments, so what's wrong?" Nova asks while picking up random stuff.
“I could have done something! I could have brought him back!” she yelled while Sam was trying to hold her back.
She climbs the stairs and enters her house.
John throw his stuff on the floor and walked past her without saying a word.
She looks for a table, but it's all taken.
"Actually, I was wondering why you where here, at the park." she lies, she's curious, she wants to know what the FBI was doing, but Castiel doesn't need to notice that.
"You... You were with agent Miller this morning, right?" she hints. Nova saw his face only for a couple of seconds, but it was enough. Those blue eyes have something different.
Sam gets out of bead and reaches the laptop in his backpack.
He recognized a broken soul and treated it with dignity.
"Well, at least we got what we needed. But never sneak out like that. What are you, sixteen?" he grumbles, looking into the envelope.
Sam looked down, gulping.
"Fuck!" her bed is empty, and her shoes are gone.
He barely notices the pair walking out to meet them, too lost in the memory of sitting under these same harsh fluorescents as he’d waited to describe the events he’d witnessed. It’s so vivid he can almost smell the smoke.
Dean just shrugs.
It blew both of his previous forays into the composition of crush-fueled mixtapes—Cassie Robinson, in the seventh grade, and Lisa Braeden, in the ninth—clean out of the water.
“We’ve been asked to go meet with his trauma therapist,” Ellen says. “We can come back after, give you a ride—?”
The first time Dean left, Castiel had been so confused that he barely registered what had happened. The second, Castiel had looked away just before he did it.
“Yes,” Castiel nods. “I’d like that.”
When he writes the note, the message is blunt. Short. Lacking any sense of the warmth or humor that usually permeates everything Dean does. Though Dean keeps insisting that Castiel has nothing to apologize for, seeing such stark proof of the rift he unintentionally caused still hurts.
For a little while, he can rest.
He slicks the skin between Dean’s legs, fingertips lifting briefly to graze over his perineum, his rim, teasing light before sliding back to circle his cock. Dean’s toes curl at his touch, but when Dean reaches for Castiel to mirror the motion Castiel catches his hand, linking their fingers and squeezing.
“You’re gonna give me a God complex,” Dean jokes, though his voice betrays how overwhelmed he is, and Castiel reaches out to touch his fist where it’s clenched on the bench seat between them. The contact seems to shake something loose. Dean’s hand turns under Castiel’s to squeeze it.
“Not the point, Cas. If you’re serious about… about showing me? This is how you do it.”
“Sure,” Dean says. “What kind?”
Standing with his hands submerged in warm, soapy water, Castiel chews on his lip and wonders how long it will be before Dean returns. If he might arrive sooner than planned. It’s strange how keenly he desires more of Dean’s time.
The grounds are quiet. In a semi-enclosed courtyard attached to the teachers lounge, a handful of neighborhood dogs are sleeping, curled up in travel crates and at the ends of leashes. Dean finds Cas among them, lit up by dim moonlight.
“I just can’t help but feel as though this might be too much to ask of you.”
“Being with you.”
Suggesting they come to the bar was mostly to stop himself from kissing Castiel more than he already had. Coming back this time was supposed to be for proof--nothing more. Instead, as he stood in Castiel’s living room, wrapped around him, he could feel himself wanting to stay.
Agreeing, Dean leaves his blade in place. He waits until Castiel is beside him to ring the doorbell, digging his ID from his pocket as the tinkling melody chimes.
Dean looks up, and Castiel doesn’t think he’s ever seen him look so scared. It makes his blood run cold. Dean’s never shied away from telling him
Whenever he feels himself slipping into the role that John trained him for—barking orders at Sam, talking down to Jack, snapping at Ben back when he’d spent those months with Lisa—he hates himself for it.
“Mm,” Dean tilts his head to look at Castiel’s reflection in the mirror behind him. He sucks his lower lip between his teeth and clicks his tongue. “That’s a shame.”
“Oh,” Dean says, and takes a shaky breath. “Yeah, so about that, the thing is—“
“Sorry. Visiting hours are almost over — just giving y’all a ten minute warning,” he says with an apologetic smile, and disappears to complete his round.
A few blocks away, while Dean keeps watch, John hot-wires a boxy old ’83 Civic they find parked in a street that runs between two competing churches. As they speed west out of the town, a cheerful sign thanks them for visiting Emmetsburg, Iowa.
“Our almost-whats?”
The words are mostly meaningless, but Castiel doesn’t care. He wraps both hands around his mug and inhales the smell.
This might have started thanks to a last-night-on-Earth, time to throw caution to the wind moment of reckless abandon, but now that they’re finally here, Dean needs it to be a first night instead. A beginning.
“What? No, I--”
“What do you mean—?” Sam starts, and Jack cuts him off, breathless with fear.
Alone again, Castiel sits in his living room and attempts to read, but his mind won’t stop flicking back to the man who was here. Dean. Who on Earth was he?
As far as Dean can see, there’s no happy ending for him, either.
“Was anyone else there?”
Point is, he's too drunk for Sam to confront him right now. He doesn't trust himself.
Considering, Castiel nods before he has an idea.
“I ordered a lot while I was waiting,” he explains.
“What are you grinning at?” Dean asks, and Castiel’s smile widens at the question.
Castiel, feeling altogether out of sorts after what he’s fairly certain was the latest-in-life sexual awakening that anyone has ever experienced in the history of consciousness, has no earthly clue. The bunker, while only a short twenty minute drive away, would force them to either separate or risk another confrontation with Sam while they’re both too mentally exhausted to navigate their way to a solution. He’s not sure that going home is a viable option.
It seems to take forever for Cas to climb the stairs. When he finally reaches Dean’s level, he sits down on the other side of the walkway and leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees. His fingers twine around one another in a strange, nervous gesture that is far too distracting for Dean to deal with.
“Where are you going?”
Castiel reaches across the space between them, his fingers brushing the red thread softly. Dean holds his breath.
He doesn’t even need to tell her he needs to be alone; Charlie hugs him tightly and drops a noisy kiss to the side of his head.
“You don’t want—?”
“Couldn’t you have shown her the picture you took?”
“How long to the drop zone, Turner?”
Dean chuckles, and Castiel is glad to huff a low laugh of his own without having to look up the reference or rely on knowledge gained second-hand through Metatron. Though the films about a cannibalistic serial killer aren’t exactly cheerful, his memories of watching them in the bunker with Dean and Sam certainly are. Dean interrupts his thoughts with a thoughtful sound, apparently still planning out the day’s meals.
“But then Cas thought of something.”
“Slipped up how?”
Pretending that neither of them know at this point is a pointless exercise in self-denial. If he’s being honest with himself, it’s been that way for a while now.
“From my perspective, it didn’t go over particularly well the first time, either.”
His voice is thick with tears, and Dean can barely hear him over the ringing in his ears, but when John says “I promise you, Dean. I’ll kill anyone who tries to hurt you,” it’s the last coherent sentence he’ll hear for the next six days.
Halfway to Lebanon, Castiel turns on the radio for the distraction, but the only station that will tune in all the way is playing nothing but a series of advertisements for farming equipment, thinly-disguised as a radio show segment.
Sam sighs.
“Cas, I’m bringing stuff whether you like it or not. I can always google what was rationed, so you’re better off just telling me.”
“Pssh. You love me.”
“I... shit, I don’t know. I don’t know. It’s the smart thing to do, right?”
Castiel feels his breath leave him in a rush. He slumps back in his seat and chances a glance over at Bobby, whose eyes are red-rimmed and haunted. Once, John had been his closest friend. Now, he suspects that Bobby is blaming himself—again—for not noticing that his friend had started slipping until it was too late.
Back at the bunker, Sam slams the door when he gets out of the Impala. He makes a beeline for the bathroom, already unbuttoning the blood-stained flannel before he’s made it all the way out of the garage. Dean won’t be surprised if he never sees him in that shirt again.
Dean’s skin had been soft and smelled of soap. It tasted like water, clean and warm. Frankly, it’s a miracle he’d managed to keep himself from pushing Dean back into the bathroom and into the allegedly capacious shower. How they got from there to here, with breakfast and a trip to Kinkos in between, is all a bit of a blur.
“I’m with you,” Dean repeats, and Castiel lets his eyes close as he breathes in the scent of motor-oil and Dean’s shampoo. This memory, he knows, will become as inextricably bound as all the others. He can’t help but hold on a little tighter at the thought, if only to catalogue every aspect of Dean’s embrace in as much detail as possible.
He tenses. Guilt sinks his shoulders. Castiel feels the burden of it on himself for inadvertently dragging open an old wound.
Sinking down to sit in the narrow space, Dean grips the bottle in his hand. Drains the last of it as he tries to stop picturing the look on Cas’ face before he left. He doesn’t succeed.
The man at the motel check-in window gives them a twin room without asking, and Dean’s discomfort is palpable.
Beneath Dean’s hands, his stomach muscles jump and twitch with every millisecond of accidental contact, but despite Dean’s undivided attention, he gains no enjoyment from any of it. Dean is staring. He looks horrified.
While Dean listens to Garth’s issue with an ever-increasing look of bewilderment—something to do with a suspected cursed object in a travelling carnival he and Bess had taken their daughter Gertie to—Castiel steps away to inspect the life-size figure of a triceratops that stands to one side of the path. It’s a fairly accurate representation of the creature’s size and shape, if not its color or texture. As he waits by the fence, he reads the little sign that stands to the side and recalls how Claire's mind had been filled with facts about a cartoon dinosaur named Cera when he'd briefly and regrettably taken her as a vessel many years earlier. As always, his thoughts of Claire carry a certain amount of guilt, and now that he's thinking of her, he finds that he's a little afraid of how she'll react to his and Dean's new relationship.
That they’d fall into one another before they even managed to get through the door.
“Yeah, well. I don’t love lying to him every time I help you fellas or Jody on a hunt. Something’s gotta give, y’know? But enough about me, let me give you the intel before I have to head in to work.”
- Special Agent Reed & Anderson are references to Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson, because of course Dean would (subconsciously) choose their aliases with like… couple goals in mind.
Rising from his seat, Castiel looks around the room again. Catching on, Dean stands.
Dean still remembers the terrifying words he’d overheard while his parents talked over the potential risks in the kitchen late one night—
Cas, buddy— I’m gonna—”
“Mm, I guess,” Dean agrees, and crosses his arms over his chest, rocking on his heels. “So, what’s the other kind?”
The whole world died when Cas did.
There’s a black and white photo on the wall of a woman with light hair, holding a scruffy-looking Jack Russell Terrier as she beams in front of what Dean’s keen car senses tell him is a Lincoln Zephyr Coupe. A side table stands beneath the photograph, holding a vase of wilting lavender roses whose petals have fallen onto a stack of mail and the floor below.
All the while, Castiel feels Dean’s nerves ratcheting higher and higher. His fear is all tangled up with an involuntary longing for Castiel to be with him through this, but he’d been adamant that he do this alone, so although it pains him, Castiel does not go to him. He just waits.
Castiel barely hears as the conversation moves on. As Bobby asks if Dean knows about Mary’s death, as Henriksen describes what’s going to happen before Dean is due to be discharged from hospital, as Ellen confirms that they do have room for Dean to stay with them at the house,
“It’s not the new year yet. I don’t have to start until midnight has passed.”
The problem, of course, is that neither of them wants to hurt the other. Not really. Not in any way that lasts.
Dean doesn’t finish his question before Castiel sends grace out through his palm in a slow, undulating rhythm. It sinks just beneath the surface of Dean’s skin, but this time he doesn’t direct it. Just lets it flow outward, a spreading heat that rolls from Dean’s stomach to his toes, his fingers, the crown of his head.
He doesn’t even realize that there’s a waitress at their table until Dean is ordering his breakfast.
“But the first time I prayed to you
Finally being open with Dean feels like exhaling; like some long-tangled Gordian knot in his chest slipping free. He just wants to be able to bask in that. Wants Dean to be able to have everything he needs, and not feel pulled in two directions.
It’s scuffed along the bottom, the metal latch rusted shut.
? I mean... I know why it took me to you, because I was thinking about how I wished we’d known each other, but why
All good, man. Just keep in touch, ok?
Dean grinds to a shuddering halt at the sound, and for a moment, he looks at Castiel like he’s his old self again. Like he’s second guessing himself for doing this. Like he’s worried he’s hurting Castiel somehow.
, and that only means it’ll hurt you both worse when it all blows up. You’ve gotta see that. Look at how miserable you both are when you fight with each other now, just as friends, and think how much worse that would be if you tried to be something more.”
like being ripped apart, over and over. Every fucking day. But you know what?”
passing us, though. If you slow down a bit, we could turn around at the rest stop up ahead. Go back the way we came. Throw it off our trail.”
“Killing time?”
He’s exhausted by it. Tired beyond any definition he could even describe. The thought of pushing Cas away and testing the strength of their relationship against the pressure of Chuck’s interference goes against everything that he wants, everything that he needs to stay at least relatively sane, but it’s like he’s stuck on a track that he can’t climb off of.
Sam is quiet for a while. Tension is thick in the air.
“I’m fine.”
“Suit yourself. But I don’t hear anyone else suggesting anything.”
Castiel shakes his head, and Dean takes a steadying breath.
"Do you feel better?" Castiel asks him, staring down at his ruined clothes, past his own rapidly flagging erection, and Dean just laughs as he zips up his jeans. Staggers backward until his back hits the church wall and sinks down onto his haunches.
“Yeah.”
makes it sound like the kind of work that people avoid at all costs, like shifting a boulder that’s far too heavy and more trouble than it’s worth. Castiel can’t help but bristle at the thought that what he feels for Dean could be anything but good.
_____
Sitting on top of a collection of vintage records that would have been an exciting enough find alone is an old military flight jacket. The tag stitched into the lining at the collar identifies it as property of the US Army Air Force, and Dean tests the worn brown leather before he picks it up carefully, wary of damaging such a well-kept piece. The leather is a little stiff at the cuffs and collar, but soft otherwise. Dean turns it over in his hands to find a hand-painted pair of wings spanning the entire back. Angel Eyes is written in curling script underneath them, and Dean traces over the faded letters with his fingertips.
“Told you. Time travel.”
Castiel hums in concession.
Staring down at the steering lock, Dean feels tears welling and spilling over against his will, and doesn’t notice John climbing back into the car until it’s too late. He catches hold of Dean’s arm, and Dean cries out as shards of splintered bone grind against each other, digging into the already damaged flesh.
John sees red. The pickup rolls forward a little when he leaps out of it, running toward Dean with his shotgun in hand, and Dean stumbles, his foot sliding in the puddle of his own sick, and John’s arm is lifting as he gets close, and there’s a
Raising one palm to rest against Castiel’s chest, Dean slides the other into his hair, thumb dragging soft against the back of his ear as he moves him into place, and Castiel lets himself be directed. Lets Dean push him back until he’s pressed firmly against the door. Lets Dean tilt his chin just so, and deepen their kiss.
Dean looks toward the landing. “I should go.”
The fact of the matter is that Dean is more worthy of his worship than any being that Castiel has ever known, and he plans to make that overwhelmingly clear before the night is through. But if he’s going to give Dean what prayed for, he has to be certain that it’s not only what he wants, but that he wants it
“Who says it’s not both?”
So, even though the reaction makes him feel like a supreme asshole, Castiel feels another part of himself shrivel up and die every time Dean smiles at Benny.
“Yeah,” he says, and licks a stripe up the underside of Castiel’s cock. Lets the tip rest against his lower lip as he speaks, still working his hand over the shaft. “Feels good to wait for it, sometimes.”
Jack was their kid, whether he’d started out that way or not.
He carries everything to the counter, and half-listens as Nora apologizes for having no available shifts for him in the coming week.
It took Claire nearly ten minutes to write her reply. He watched as the series of dots repeatedly appeared and disappeared along the bottom of the screen. Cas was expecting a long message. What he received was two words long.
“Cas,
It all feels too easy. Too normal. Somewhere, deep down, Castiel feels himself relaxing into the familiarity of their old, comfortable patterns, even as another part of him feels as though it’s coiling into a tight, dangerous spring, waiting for everything to come crashing back down. He ignores it, and smiles, and pulls one of the bulky chairs closer to the bed so that he can stay in reach while he sits down.
“Cas? You home?”
Dean’s fingers feel numb as he returns the paper under the magnet. So, that’s that, he thinks. There’s a hot, painful lump in his throat, and though he’s pretty sure he should be crying, nothing comes. He just feels hollowed out. Gutted.
He only looks up when he hasn’t heard Dean in a while, and when he can’t immediately find him, he feels his chest constrict.
Water is leeching through gaps around the window. The air is damp; the basement cavernous.
For now, he decides he’ll just go ahead and steal half of Dean’s breakfast. He’s fairly certain Dean will let him get away with it. He told the waitress they’re sharing, after all.
“You’ve been a far better brother to me than any I’ve known before, and I’ve grown to love Mary through you and Dean. Her importance to the two of you makes her important to me, and we’ve become quite close in the time since she came back.”
He grazes his fingertips over the image before placing it carefully on the floor beside him, and reads.
“I’m not a ghost,” Dean says.
“He’s even named after him, aren’t you, Cas?” he says, and Castiel nods.
Dean feels numb with cold only minutes after leaving the relative warmth of the car, but he can’t think about that. What he
in tiny print along the inner edge of the paper label, and slips the record back into place. He’s about to leave when he hears the creak of a floorboard. The living room light flicks on before he can move.
“Not like I haven’t survived on less sleep before.”
“What?” he calls back.
She blinks at him slowly.
“Look, I just need you to promise me that you’re not gonna bail again. ‘Cause he was broken, Cas, and if you’re just gonna take off in a week, or a month, or—“
Dean frowns at the apparent non-sequitur before he shakes his head, and Castiel explains. “Not all prayers are the same. There’s the formal kind—prayers that begin with a name and end with an amen, or at least the impression of one. You’ve directed a lot of those to me over the years.”
And Cas cries out, and arches up, and comes, and everything clicks into place.
The bright sky makes Dean’s eyes water; the bitter cold makes his breath sting in his lungs. He wants to get out of here.
“You don’t have to—”
“Yeah? Wish I could say I made it up.”
Sam will come around eventually, but oof he's stubborn and misguided for now. We'll see a bit more of him and Mary (and a few other people) next time...
It’s absurd how happy the realization makes him, but he feels as though he’s unlocked some heretofore untapped aspect of himself; a capacity for enjoyment in small things, in parts of existence that for the larger portion of his life have been nothing more than background noise.
Because this time, Dean doesn’t immediately look away. He doesn’t step back or crack a joke or lash out or deflect. He looks at Castiel’s mouth, and he keeps on looking. And looking. And looking. Castiel feels as though he might buzz right out of his body if he doesn’t just—
“And uh, pro tip?” Dean adds as they step out of his front door. “It doesn’t matter how much air freshener you spray, that sulphur smell is gonna eat right through it. You’re better off just airing the place out for a couple days.”
“Well, I’ve got a whole bunch of movies we can watch. Lotta comedies, a few sappy ones that I’ll deny owning if you ever tell my brother.”
The guard is a guy named Garth who works at the animal shelter in town, and if it’s possible, he’s even more into the LARP scene than Charlie.
The twisted asshole probably thought that Dean falling for Cas but always being too chickenshit to do anything about it would make for a compelling sideplot. Really, it would explain a hell of a lot. He’s seen telenovela leads with less tortured relationships than what he and Cas have.
“Now for the slow part,” Dean mutters.
Scrolling through the playlists he has saved, Dean finally settles on one he made a couple of weeks ago, and In the Evening starts to play.
“Alright.”
Swallowing, Castiel pulls his arms free so he can touch Dean’s face, and Dean looks up at him. He looks so open.
“Johnson?” Castiel asks, voice wary. Thirty tense seconds pass before Turner manages to crawl over to Johnson’s turret, and then his voice is crackling in Castiel’s ear.
There was no point in continuing on to their planned destination now that he was on his own. As loath as he is to admit it, he needs Crowley for backup. Without access to the myriad eyes of his true form, now barely a shadow of its former glory, he needs the extra set that the king of Hell affords him. Going after Lucifer alone would be suicide, even if this is just a reconnaissance mission.
He’d been okay. He’d been content.
“Sometimes, I pray to you,” he says. The quiet that follows is not unexpected.
They drive past the cops slowly, and Dean’s entire body feels tense as a guitar string. Nobody notices. Nobody does a thing.
“Bobby!” he shouts.
“I bet you do,” he says, pushing at the back of Castiel's underwear until the jeans hinder his progress. He shoves at the denim a little more firmly. They barely budge. Dean looks down, momentarily distracted. “Jesus, these really are too tight on you.”
He has to start over multiple times, discarded drafts piling up in his wastepaper basket every time he accidentally says too much, but finally he’s satisfied. He seals the letter in an envelope, pries up the corner of the carpet with a tire iron, wedges the envelope underneath, then carefully nails it back down.
“What, that smoking’ll kill you?”
“Mm. I was talking about
Because it hasn’t escaped his notice that while Jack looks like Cas, and carries himself like Cas, he acts like Dean a lot of the time, too.
The people downstairs will leave, he tells himself.
“Seems pretty early, even for the kids.”
“Well, he can’t have gone too far with that.”
“It was pretty basic prenatal stuff. Ultrasound. Vitals. Whoever they are, they just want to make sure Kelly is healthy.” He pauses. Makes a face. “Well, that the
“You can rest in here,” Dean tells him, but Castiel only nods, dazed. He tilts his chin up until Dean takes the hint and dips forward to kiss him again. By the time Dean’s words register, they’ve moved halfway across the room.
His hands are hot on Castiel’s skin. Blunt nails dig in as he flips him around to press against him from behind. It’s rough and harsh and violent, and not at all how this should have happened. Not the first time.
Castiel closes up the garage in a daze.
“Look, man, I’m really sorry I busted in on you back there, I wasn’t thinking--”
“The—” Dean briefly lifts his hands, then lets them fall helplessly back to his sides. “The… I don’t know, man. The freakin’ confessions. The discussion. The… the whole
What his goal is beyond
“Tell me what you need.”
“It is,” Dean says. “It’s also a camera, and... a computer, I guess. It kinda does everything.”
Hanging over his arm, the folded jacket is heavy and warm.
“Oh. I don’t… no, this is crazy. You need to tell me what’s going on.”
Dean’s cell buzzes again a few hours later, and Castiel seriously considers kicking it off the bed. He’s never spent so much time being irritated by inanimate objects as he has over the past twenty-four hours. Before he can act on the impulse, Dean sits up to grab the phone, rubbing sleep from his eyes as he reads the message that’s come through.
Castiel’s mouth falls open as he backs up a step, before swallowing convulsively and leaning back for a closer look. He reaches out.
He can tell that Sam noticed. Can tell that he doesn’t want to let it go. He’s always been like a dog with a bone when he knows Dean is withholding something important. But something in Dean’s face, in the inadvertent echo of Sam’s own words, must make him realize that it’s not the time.
Sam answers the phone on the second ring.
“It’s difficult to say,” Castiel admits. “Laying with humans is forbidden, so the conception of a nephilim is incredibly rare. The few that I have encountered in the past were born of seraphs and cherubs.”
Any time that they weren’t out on a hunt, Cas spent the vast majority of his time working at the table in the library or frowning at coffee molecules in the kitchen. Sometimes, he’d putter around in one of the storage rooms downstairs, poking at ancient scrolls and curse boxes and memorizing the locations of things that he thought might turn out to be useful. Sometimes, he’d knock on Dean’s door and wait to be invited to sit beside him on the bed and watch something on Dean’s laptop.
“I made it while you were getting changed.”
Novak’s uncle was unavailable for comment.
“Hey, hey, it’s alright. We’ll figure it all out, okay?”
“Post-traumatic stress disorder,” Dean explains. “Like, uh... shellshock? Combat fatigue?”
Sleep deprivation, he remembers reading once, is often used as torture. People lose their minds. Internal processes go into overdrive and then shut down; the brain starts to misfire, making people see things that aren’t there. Tricks them into imagining phantom sights and sounds and slights that make them fly off the handle for no good reason or retreat into themselves in terror.
“If you’d like to move again, you’ll have to earn the privilege.”
“Cas,” Charlie says.
“Did I ever tell you you’re the best?”
, with
Castiel nods, and trails after him as he makes his way along the path. They don't say much else as they continue the short walk home, and then there's no time to say anything at all.
It’s dark in the loading dock behind the movie theater, and as dusk settles over Wichita, the fall breeze shifts from cool to bitterly cold. The glow from the street-lamps on East 3 rd Street barely reaches the dumpsters they’re hidden behind.
It’s so bright that it leaves an afterimage, and it takes him a moment to register that the power has gone out. When he does, the dark seems so thick it’s almost suffocating. But he can still see the shadows on the walls, taking shape. Reaching out like hands. Like tentacles. Tendrils.
“Okay. Just, uh... tell me your name, first.”
There’s a long pause, and in it Castiel can feel Dean’s fear growing. His uncertainty as to how to continue this conversation gets bigger, grows teeth. It’s almost a relief when Sam speaks again, directing the conversation.
“I—“ Castiel stops himself from completing the sentence, but Dean shoves at his chest again. Shakes him.
underneath, but he fears that it wouldn’t be enough. He needs to tell Dean
“It’s a phone,” Dean says.
“Oh, I already spoke with—“
Perhaps it’s a little cowardly, but he’d like to already be on his way out when Sam reaches the garage. As it turns out, he’s barely got the door open when Dean clears his throat, and he looks back to see him pointedly eyeing the half-deflated rear tire.
From the corner of his eye, Castiel sees when Dean gets another message and writes another reply. A moment later, his phone lights up again. Dean snorts.
Normanby Avenue is flanked on both sides by sycamore trees, and the fallen clocks crunch under Dean’s feet when he steps from the car. Hannah’s house is set back from the road, casting a shadow over the slightly overgrown yard decorated with chipped garden gnomes and a dry terra-cotta birdbath.
against Castiel’s chest, and Castiel would thank him, profusely, simply for existing.
“But we do need to leave soon so it’s not already dark when we get there, so…”
“You don’t know that.”
“I didn’t plan it,” he admits. “It was my friend, Charlie. She didn’t believe me when I told her about meeting you, so I was leaving a message to prove it. I’m... shit, Cas. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have come.”
“Admittedly,” Castiel says, flipping on the indicator to overtake a slow-moving camper van, “I had absolutely no clue what I was feeling at that point. But in retrospect… did you really not notice that I didn’t hesitate to follow you?”
Dean snorts, but finally stops pestering him and crawls to the front of the tent. Chill air rolls in when he unzips the door, and Castiel listens as he pulls his boots on, his feet crunching over leaves and grass as he wanders off into the trees nearby.
“I just got a little... dizzy,” he lies. “It’s entirely possible that I’m just tired, but I doubt I’ll be able to sleep until I’ve ruled a gas leak out. Would you mind?”
It seems that no time passes at all before they’re pulling into the cracked parking lot of an unassuming burger joint called Danburger. To one side of the building is a busy Culver’s restaurant; to the other, an auto parts store with a marquee board out front that reads
“It’s Castiel.”
It catches against his rim on the first pass, making Castiel squirm, and Dean does it again, teasing over the tight muscle over and over, pressing a little harder each time until he finally lets it sink inside.
“She is NOT,” one of the other kids shouts, smearing the remnants of something chocolatey on the window and staring up at Dean like he’s the most idiotic person he’s ever encountered in his ripe old age of five. “The boy lion with the mane is the KING.”
“You better not have been up all night,” he says.
“How's Sam?”
“You could’ve been here in six goddamn hours, any day, for a year. A
It’s an absurd thing to say, and Castiel means to tell him so, but then Dean’s mouth is on him again and he forgets how to speak. Warmth, building pressure low in his stomach, his groin. Castiel’s toes curl against the mattress.
It’s cool among the trees, foggy and dark, and the only light he sees comes from a fire to the north. His plane. From here he can see what’s left of her nose--the painted angel missing most of her face and the curling script below cutting off halfway through.
On the screen, the brief text of Donna’s email slowly loads again, but the attached video and image files that constitute the actual information are still appearing as blurry thumbnails, overlaid with a circular symbol that Castiel has come to recognise as an infuriating sign that the computer is trying to do something it is currently incapable of.
“Oh, it’s nothing,” Castiel assures him as he makes his way back over. “Just—my partner refused to stop somewhere overnight, and now he’s going to spend all day pretending he doesn’t have a stiff neck from sleeping in the car, just so I can’t say I told him so.”
The shed is empty now.
Today, standing in the bunker’s garage almost two years on, he finds himself experiencing the phenomena of olfactory memory once more.
For a moment, Dean falters, but Cas continues before he can worry too much about what that source could be.
, shut up,” Dean says, and takes him fully into his mouth, pinning his hips to the sink with his forearm.
“Can’t sleep?” Dean asks, and Castiel sighs.
Stepping in close, he tugs Dean closer to him and lets the fingertips of his free hand skate down over Dean’s side. Like this, he can feel the warmth of Dean’s skin through his clothes. The relief of it washes over him so wholly that his eyes slip closed. Dean’s breath is soft against his lips, close but not touching.
Dean’s hand closes around his own before he can move any further. Castiel looks down at it in surprise.
“You ready?” Dean asks from the doorway as Castiel hesitates, trying to decide whether or not he should say anything else. Whether it would be wise to broach the topic they’re apparently all avoiding.
“Both,” Dean tells him. The honesty is more than Castiel expected.
“Okay. I’m not going anywhere.” He glances up at the clock on the wall. “Not for the next nine and a half minutes, anyway.”
Climbing down is awkward as hell, but Dean manages, leaving one hand against the log for a moment while Castiel adjusts to his weight. When he reaches up to hold onto Dean’s knees, Dean tries not to read into the way he briefly squeezes them.
And for all his power, Jack doesn’t usually look all that threatening, but he does when he steps towards her, says plainly, “You can try. Run to Billie, tell her everything went sideways on your watch and see how she reacts. What she decides to do to you. Or,” he says, cheerful and bland again. “Help us. Help us find the safest, smartest way to pull this off and she never has to know.”
And that’s it, stilted conversation topics exhausted.
He sits on the back porch and stares into the garden, phone redundant in his hand. Dean feels comfortable here, wants this kind of life for him and Sammy and--
then curls into herself and stares blankly out the window. Cas slides into the passenger seat, shoulders tight.
Nothing is going to change unless they make it change.
Dean doesn’t really know what to say that isn’t more worthless platitudes, more hollow apologies. Chuck is an asshole,
“Eileen?”
Nothing feels real.
He found them halfway across the country when Jack was born, after all.
“Well you probably could,” she says, carelessly. “His daddy was human.”
Eileen sleeps and sleeps, and sleeps.
that he can’t not say anything.
“No.”
“God.” She rolls her eyes so hard her eyes almost white-out again. “I was supposed to get rescued, and in a moment of sweet relief seduce Dean, blah, blah, blah.”
“Because I’m taking the Mark,” Cas says when it’s done. “Someone else will have to destroy this. You or Sam.”
Cas also hesitates for a moment, then offers Dean a wan smile and heads into the bunker.
They run a quick vamp case on the way back into Kansas, and while they’re wiping down their machetes in an abandoned farmhouse Dean has an epiphany. Two, even.
Sure, Dean was John’s obedient little soldier back in the day, and nobody knows that better than Lee, but he’s had enough time to come to terms with his daddy issues.
It’s one of the only rooms in this place with natural light, opaque orange-coloured glass windows line the top of the walls giving the space a time-capsule feel; frozen in 1958.
He pushed up onto his knees, wary, but the clearing is empty.
If this is what freedom feels like, it’s underwhelming.
Cas closes the gap. Moves his hand that last half-inch and gently cups Deans jaw, fingertips just grazing the bolt. It jolts with pain for an instant, then the hot-cold flash of grace and then just the soothing warmth of Cas’ massive hand on his face.
“Are we seriously,” Cas says slowly, turns to face them both head on, the closest he’s been to looking Dean in the eye for days but still not quite right and it rubs Dean exactly the wrong way. “Talking about going to Hell to try to speak to Michael?
“I,” he says, croaky and dry. He’s been crying too. Dean should comfort him, should make his baby brother feel better, but he can’t. Sam takes a breath, clears his throat, tries again. “Jack-- Jack told me. About Cas’ deal.”
They are toys, they are puppets.
They flicker again, Amara to Chuck and back again. They snap their fingers, and vanish.
No answer, and Dean can feel himself getting defensive.
in a way I’ve never been before because I knew the story wasn’t over I knew Jack wasn’t done! I was
That gets a startled, wet laugh out of Sam. He dabs his eyes with the rag at last.
“Why do you care so much Dean?”
“They’ll never be safe,” Sam says, placatingly. “As long as Chuck is out there it’s only a matter of time--”
(See the end of the chapter for
After the second time, he stops by a stump and sits down. Calls, “Hold up Cas, I got something stuck to my shoe.”
It takes a second to pull the lockpick from his pocket, a few seconds longer to click the tumblers into place. It’s not his best work, but considering the echo of snarling hellhounds and the tremor in his fingers he thinks he does okay.
Great.
Heaven probably doesn’t have the man power for a purgatory rescue anymore, especially if Eve is running the joint again. Rowena might let them take the back door outta Hell, but she said herself that the hoardes of Hell were on the sparce side right now.
“Sure,” he quips without thinking. “What’s a little more heartache on top of everything else?”
Dean moves first, gets a few good licks in before Lee shoves him into the table. He grabs Lee round the shoulders and throws him across the room, goes down after him for the pin. He doesn’t think about how close the straddle is to anything else they’ve done before and punching him in the face is a good distraction.
“Deep breaths,” he soothes. And then everything goes fussy and dark.
He doesn’t say it to Dean’s face, of course, but Dean overhears him talking to Jack,“-- selective mutism, it’s a trauma response--” and, “--therapy, maybe? I’ll email Mia, she owes us one, she could--”.
; his dad’s passive agressive bullshit,
“Mom,” Pax tries, and Dean almost feels for the guy. Mommy clearly doesn’t.
“Yeah,” Lee says, soft and patronising. “That’s what got you here.”
“Yup. And he ain’t exactly trustworthy, either. He told us he couldn’t kill Jack, remember? About three minutes before he iced him.”
“I, um. I know I haven’t been doing this as long as you,” Jack says, following close behind. “But. Doesn’t this seem a little easy?”
And the never leaving the bunker.
“Just give us a second,” Sam says, tugs Dean away and whispers frantically
“Maybe, I dunno,” Sam shrugs, but he does wipe his chin and nose.
“Okay,” Sam says, tentatively. “Okay. So what now?”
But, recent questionable parenting choices aside, Dean likes Bess, and he knows she means well. He can’t bring himself to refuse when she hands him another bag of fresh grilled cheese for the road, so he wishes her well and, Christ, does he mean it. Their improbable little family deserves to be safe and happy.
Sam occasionally asks Dean to drive them places - the library, a few museums, sometime a university archive. Mike could zap them all there in seconds, but Sam looks earnest and sad when he asks so Dean obliges.
“Listen,” Sam says. “I can try to jerry-rig up some magic, using a substitute. Then again, the only substitute that would stand a chance of working is--”
“Short version? Sammy lost hope and now I’m free,” Chuck smirks. “But hey, take it easy on the kid! Took a lot to beat it out of him.”
Cas laughs at himself, a harsh little sound, keeps his eyes lowered when he says, “It got a little smushed. Once I had the blossom I fought. Caught them off guard. They fought back.”
And that sounds good, sign Dean up, but;
And he steps purposely off into the woods, so that’s that.
As much as Dean wants to dive right in to kicking Chuck’s pasty ass, she’s right. It’s been a really shitty few days, a little unconsciousness might be nice. As a treat.
, the two of them without any of their baggage, if only for a moment.
“Yes,” Cas sighs. “It did take me. But my grace has been failing for months, and the Empty has no hold over humans. Once I expelled the last of my grace--”
And Dean was getting to that.
They haven’t seen Bess for years, but she looks good. And Garth mentioned his daughter when they roped him into spending Christmas on dangerous undercover mission but now he’s got three whole rugrats, damn. Cute, too, even if they are named after Sammy and Cas.
“I’ll be damned, man, come in here!” Lee pulls him in for another hug.
Fuck,
“I’m ready,” he says, no hesitation. Billie doesn’t smile, exactly, but she looks satisfied.
Conciousness comes slowly, but he’s aware that his face is pressed into the ground before he claws his way back to higher cognitive function.
“Yeah, okay. Go on then, Ralph.”
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Sam says, gentle enough to wound. “Whatever made him happy. I am so fucking sorry.”
Eileen is sat at the kitchen table, tapping away at Sam’s laptop.
Dean slams the patties down harder than necessary to break them apart, sticks them on the grill while Sam frowns at him. It’s frustrating, this kiddie glove approach. Sam, more than almost anyone else, has seen Dean’s absolute rock bottom. And this? This ain’t that. Not even close.
Claire looks at him for a long moment, really looks at him.
, so they can shout and punch and rage at you until they get it out of their system and forgive you.
“To take the blame. Harvest fails? Stillborn child? Our bad, not his.”
He doesn’t regret that, and even when he’s resented the cost, he did what he could to help people. Dean has always been a good little soldier, he’s been ready to die for the greater good since he was 16.
“Dean.”
’. Sam mouths along to all Inigo’s lines, Dean throws a pillow at him halfway through ‘
“What?”
Lee shakes his head, takes a drink.
Joey must be more worried than he looks, though, because he waits until Dean is lined up and then takes a gamble.
Why the fuck not.
He’s had this existinal crisis before - when he failed to stop his mom from making the deal with Yellow-eyes, when that cupid admitted heaven played matchmaker to guarantee his conception, when Michael looked at him with his fathers face in 1978 and told him,
“What am I doing here?” Lee laughs, gestures around them proudly. “I own this joint, man! What are you doing in here?”
When he straightens up, there’s a flash of otherworldly blue eyes in the mirror, and he twists so quickly he falls into the sink but it’s gone, he’s gone, there’s nothing--
“Uh, no,” Cas says, smiles gently and doesn’t back off. Brave guy. “No, it’s not. Jody, it’s, um. Well. You know--” he sighs, starts over. “I was never able to make things right with Claire. What I took from her… I’m never going to be able to make that right.”
“I'll tell you what I’ll do,” he says, and the frustration seems to bleed out of him. “I’ll lock the joint up and you and I can work the case, just like old times.”
“You sure this is the place?” Dean asks.
“But it did,” Cas replies, hoists himself up in the chair like he isn’t still panting. “Ruby said the Occultum was never in Hell.”
“Blessed by a goddess of luck,” Cas muses to the library in general.
But all those other times - the demon blood, killing Lilith, taking on Lucifer, the Trials, opening the cage, working with the Brits. All of those things were Sam hellbent on doing
They all drain their shots, and Lorna gives him one more obvious look over and then heads back to bail out the couple of bar staff struggling to keep up with the rush.
Michael shouts, long and loud and utterly unintelligible, then falls silent all at once.
“Eileen where the hell are you?”
Dean’s ears are still ringing when Cas bursts in behind them, to an empty room and two dumbstruck Winchesters.
Sheriff Dillon does give Dean two useful pieces of information though. One, Angela has no living family and no permanent ties in town. Perfect victim, not many people will miss her. And B, the girl who reported her missing is probably going to be at Swayze’s Bar.
Chuck’s strings or not, Cas always stuck his lot in with humanity. Chuck’s strings or not, Dean should have asked Cas to stay.
“I know, I know it shouldn’t matter, I- I should be past all that crap, I’m 22 for fucks sake--”
“Thank you,” Dean clinks their bottles, and that’s enough of that. “Man, so. I don’t think I’ve seen you since Sammy was in college.”
“Hah,” Jody says. “Well. Nobody’s pregnant yet.”
He tries, but he can’t switch off. It’s not new; he’s been plagued with dreams of drowning since Michael, of seeing his hands, brutally efficient, through a haze of grey and not being able to stop; dreams of waking up in a box, in a grave,
Michael doesn’t have a plan, but he wants to help, he says. He had a few ideas, he says, avenues to explore.
So, I ended up changing a few bits around in this chapter becasue the episode was a hot mess
“You talked to him?” he says immediately, then realises how accusing he sounds, and apologises by answering himself. “Of course you talked to him.”
Dean doesn’t know if God has been pushing them together all this time or if he just put bigger and bigger obstacles in their way and they found their way back together every time regardless. He’s terrified that at the first sign of conflict, they’re going to find out they can’t actually stand each other, that they’ll fall apart and nobody will be there to line up their little hamster tunnels.
Satisfied, he slips his arms through the sleeves of the jacket, and reaches out to wipe the steam from the mirror glass before it occurs to him that he hasn’t had hot water running in here since before breakfast.
just tell him the truth.”
A barman at a public house in Normal reported that the pair were in low spirits when they came in, but “they’d been in together twice before, and seemed deep in conversation on both occasions.”
It takes far too long for Dean to realize that Cas is just doing what he asked.
, Cas. Just say come.”
It’s mostly out of convenience—all but one of the other motels they’ve passed either had fully illuminated NO VACANCY signs casting fluorescent glows across their full parking lots, or they didn’t offer 24 hour check-in—but it’s also a deliberate choice.
that?”
At the desk, the clerk has two room keys waiting along with Castiel’s card, and his brow is furrowed as he tries to parse what he seems to think was a comment directed at him.
Dean’s eyes are lust-dark, his lips bitten red. Sitting back up, Castiel glides his thumb over Dean’s Adam’s apple, down into the dip of his throat. It bobs when Dean swallows.
“What do you
He’s afraid that Dean is going to turn on him again. That Dean will blame him for what happened to Cas. Blame him for this like he’s been blaming him for everything since the moment he was born.
Rocks and dirt are still tumbling into the pit as its walls slowly cave in, but Cas isn’t back yet, and there’s no way that all of Hell’s souls have returned in such a short time.
“Have you been waiting long?”
“Can you honestly imagine Balthazar throwing a punch?”
While Dean considers his point, their waitress comes by to refill their mugs and tell Dean his waffles are on their way. Once she’s gone again, he sighs, rubbing at his brow with his knuckles. His hand falls down onto the table, making the cutlery clatter against the ketchup in its little wire basket.
“Which are?”
Dean’s eyes flash dark, and he crowds into Castiel’s space, fingers rising to clutch at his throat.
“Nothing,” Cas says.
Dean’s focus is slipping, so with a nod he excuses himself and heads toward the classrooms the deputy had gestured toward, leaving her to talk with the others.
“Wow, you should go into public speaking.”
If there’s one thing that Dean’s time in Iraq taught him, it’s that he has to trust his instincts. Right now though, his instincts are convinced that he just traveled back in time. He’s pretty sure his instincts are broken.
“Well, can you?”
“Shit,” Dean says. “Cas, are you--”
Castiel shakes his head, looking at Dean as he walks backward toward the fridge.
Mr Wyatt smiles, and Castiel is saved from any further small talk by Sam and Jo stepping out of the elevator with Sam’s girlfriend Jess pressed to his side, her arm linked tightly around his elbow.
Dean shoots Castiel an apologetic look before he calls back, “Garage!”, then lowers his voice. “Red Robin, tonight. Yeah?”
“Are you alright?”
While Dean goes to his room to pack a duffel bag with a few changes of clothes, Castiel heads for the library to assemble the meagre collection of relevant books they have.
“Huh,” Dean says as he unlocks the door. “So you’ve never seen a TV?”
“Cas!” Dean exclaims, and there’s the distinct sound of laughter and raucous conversation in the background. “Are you here? I figured you weren’t coming. Just let me come open the--”
“Leaving Wichita.”
“Well, I don’t know
He doesn’t have time to fight back the urge to vomit. Somehow, Henriksen seems to know it’s coming, and there’s a waste paper basket in his hands just in time. He retches and retches and retches, heaves until his throat burns. Ellen crouches beside him.
“Yesterday,” Donna says, and Dean deflates a little. “But Kelly never showed.”
notice it for a while, and right now… well. Cas doesn’t get to be human right now, and Dean sure as hell doesn’t get to enjoy watching him. There’s no time for this. They have work to do.
At the cemetery in the morning, the stench of decay is thick enough to make Dean gag. The bodies that crawled from their graves when Chuck pulled the plug have been rotting in the sun for two days, and as they pick their way between corpses and headstones, headed for the crypt where Rowena will cast her spell, Dean has the depressing realization that they’re going to have to clean up this mess, too.
“I’m so glad to hear it, Cas.”
“She brought a few hunters whose names I didn’t recognize—Paul, Hank, and… Jerry, I think? Phone signal was pretty shaky. They’re headed for the town centre in a warded truck. Figured we’d meet there and work our way out in pairs.”
“No, but you’ve mentioned her several times.”
what the FUCK cas
Castiel stretches out, watching Dean dig through his dresser. When he finds what he was looking for—a pair of maroon board shorts—he glances over at Castiel with a frown.
“Yeah.”
angelic in origin.”
Dean lifts an amused brow.
He sighs.
“Damn it,” he murmurs to himself after a sleepless hour, his eyes stinging with exhaustion as his mind refuses to let him stop thinking.
With a groan, Dean rolls his eyes and bats her hand away.
It doesn’t escape Dean’s notice when he picks up the phone the following afternoon that he’s spoken to Sam more times in the past few days than he has in months. The thought makes him guilty, as though he’s using his brother. Deep down, he knows that’s not entirely true.
Dean nods, and tries not to think about the fact that the last time they’d seen her was at Mary’s wake.
But the thought of Bobby and Ellen waiting for him, of having to talk about any of this once he has to leave Dean for the night… it makes his stomach twist, sick with nerves.
He doesn’t let himself cry, though he can feel it in his chest like something trying to hatch, and when he finally sleeps it’s fitful and uneasy. He dreams of an endlessly unfolding road that doesn’t seem to take him anywhere.
“I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m relieved you’re taking this so well. I figured you’d lose it the second you found out.”
the one who gets all weird over leather boots and stetsons. It’s one of the few things that make him think that he’s not the only one of them whose interests extend beyond girls. Rather than say anything about it aloud, he just sighs and rolls his eyes.
On the landing, Dean pauses to listen for a moment.
“You’d be surprised.”
“Well, also. Maybe I’m kinda… I dunno,” Dean chews at his lip. Drums his thumb against Castiel’s collarbone. “Kinda frustrated that I didn’t get to see you get off again.”
“I’ll save it for later.”
He looks in every room, finding no trace of Castiel anywhere, and is turning in place in the kitchen when he sees the slip of paper wedged under the photo he stuck to the fridge yesterday.
“Whatever you’re thinking about.”
Sam huffs a laugh.
As he stares at it, the lighter slips from between Castiel’s fingers. A moment later it clatters against the street below.
It’s hard to tell in the firelight, but Castiel thinks that Dean might almost be more red in the face than he is himself. His heart is racing, set off by Dean’s accidental implication even though Castiel knew immediately that it wasn’t what he meant.
Beside him, John is hunched over the steering wheel, shrouded in shadow. When they pass under a streetlight, sickly yellow light glints off his eyes and casts his features into harsh relief. Dean’s skin prickles all over at the sight. Moments later, his vision dips and fades and grows unbearably fuzzy.
He’s only been alone for half the day. Around nine in the morning, Crowley received a call from Rowena and told him he’d be on his own for a while before disappearing from the passenger seat. Cas was irritated by the lack of explanation for all of three seconds before he realized that this meant he was finally getting a break from Crowley’s constant nattering, and smiled to himself in relief before switching the radio to something he could stand to listen to.
“Okay.”
“That’s not... Cas, what do you think is going to happen here? You think Dean is going to react well to this? That he’ll say he feels the same?”
Dean blinks at the message for almost a full minute before he groans and thumps his head back against the side of the couch. He spent hours with Castiel, and he never once asked about Daniel.
She sounds incredulous.
Henry pulls the door shut and gestures toward the stairs, then follows Castiel up into the apartment. They make their way around slowly, sniffing, and Henry pauses by the stove.

Dean drinks until the whisky stops burning.
“We have our work cut out for us,” John says, peering over the steering wheel at the house. He sounds so casual about it, as though he hasn’t been alternating between deathly silence and unintelligible rambling for the past week. “We’ll do a quick sweep, then you can secure the building while I get us what we need to stay here a while.”
Across the narrow space, John is crouched on the other side of the fold-down ladder, tightly gripping his shotgun and aiming it at the spot where an unsuspecting person’s face would appear if they were to pull down the door panel.
In his head, he sings to himself to pass the time, to keep himself sane. He’s not really sure if it’s working, but as long as he hasn’t forgotten the words, he knows he hasn’t forgotten his life in the time before either, and that counts for something. Every song connects to a distinct memory. Dean holds on to each one as tightly as he can.
It’s not really warm enough to have the windows open—the temperature today barely reached the low sixties before it started dropping again just before school let out—but they leave them down anyway and let the chill breeze sting their cheeks.
Despite a couple of interruptions--a walk-in client who needs an urgent repair on a ripped seam, another client who collects a dress he made for her and requests a second one in a different color, and a call from a regular client turned friend who’ll be coming by the following day with a costuming project for him--he’s finished with the suit by mid-afternoon.
“Stay a little longer?” Castiel asks him after a moment, his voice quiet, and Dean can’t bring himself to say no. He doesn’t want to say no.
Keys in hand, he braces himself and heads for the door.
But—as if determined to prove his every prediction wrong—Dean stops swimming a couple of yards away, his eyes almost comically wide as he stares at Castiel.
When Castiel lifts his gaze back to Dean’s face, he’s taken aback by the expression on his face. Despair just as deep as what Castiel had been feeling on the day he was speaking of. He lifts his hand, brushing his thumb over Dean’s lips.
Castiel just laughs, delirious. Dean grins up at him, his face flushed.

“Yeah, makes sense,” Sam says.
Every time, no matter which version of the dream he’d had, Castiel would wake with a pressure in his chest that felt an awful lot like suffocating.
“What? No, I don’t.”
“Please, come in,” she steps aside, ushering them into her living room. There’s a general sense of clutter around the place, and as Hannah shuffles her way to a well-used armchair, Dean can see why. Though she still seems to have all her wits about her, she’s hunched over at the waist, and he guesses arthritis is taking it’s toll.
Castiel opens his mouth to argue, then thinks better of it. He shrugs.
“Not your brothers?”
,” Dean wheezes, his hand flailing sideways and knocking one of the pillows onto the floor. Dean, to his credit, manages to keep himself from thrusting into Castiel’s mouth, but after experiencing the compulsion himself, Castiel quickly decides that it simply means he’s not trying hard enough.
“They’re not thrilled to be losing their captain,” Mr Wyatt admits. “But they’re a close knit team. They’re just happy for Sam and Jo.”
“Whatever you like,” Castiel says.
The sink connected to the rainwater tank outside. Dean could drink deeply. Clean his face. His hands. His hair. It’s far too long now to go without washing for more than a few days, and it’s so greasy at this point that it smells. His skin crawls, and his fingers twitch at his sides as he wills himself to just
“You need more than a couple of hours, Dean.”
“Hey, uh—” he says, looking out the passenger window in a way that feels deliberate. Like he’s embarrassed by what he’s about to say. “Thanks for organizing this, Cas.”
“You already ate the last one.”
“That’s all I ask. And hey, bonus--you won’t look like crap by then.”
It’s a futile kind of wish, made ugly by the circumstances of reality as he knows it, but he has to hope that in one of those worlds, in some version of reality, they were all okay. Happy, even.
“We had to wait for him to let us know who he was comfortable seeing. In cases like this, we can’t just assume that a traumatized person will be okay with visitors, and the attending doctor asked that we give him some time to acclimatize to his new surroundings before bringing up the topic.”
The second article is much shorter--barely a paragraph--and has no adjoining picture.
He shifts back fully into himself, and Ruqayya’s eyes open. They’re bright and hopeful.
“Relatively,” Dean parrots, folding the bag up and poking it into his jacket pocket. “What a day, huh?”
funny, only he’s never been so furious in his life.
“I did,” Dean tells him.
“Then how did you get into my apartment? I checked all the locks. I always check the locks.”
“Yeah, I guess it is weird I didn’t check those out.”
In the dark quiet, with nothing to distract him or demand his attention, it’s impossible to keep himself from latching back onto his earlier train of thought, and within minutes he’s gone from barely conscious to wide awake, staring at the popcorn ceiling of the empty classroom and thinking. Analyzing. Cataloguing every thought and feeling he can identify, and inspecting each one for proof that it’s really his, and not just some malignant seed left there by Chuck to make his favorite show a little more interesting.
He hates that he’s had the thought at all, but he can’t stop it.
“That sounds reasonable.”
need to find you a molecules workaround, though. You’re missing out.”
more developed than two months,” Parker says. Then he blinks with clearly dawning horror. “What’s the gestation period for a… for something like this?”
“How?”
“It’s cute, but I think it’s a little big for me.”
Castiel folds his hands on his lap and regards her openly.
“I’ve actually, um... I’ve been trying to figure something out,” Dean says, shuffling down the bed and laying on his side to face Castiel across the pillow. “About this whole...”
“I assure you darlin’, there’s very little I
Dean drops off to sleep about half an hour later, just as they’re passing by a sign for Salt Fork State Park in eastern Ohio, and Castiel turns the tape deck’s volume down as quiet as it will go without switching off. As Dean sleeps, occasionally snuffling his face against Castiel’s coat, Castiel listens to the steady thrum of the road and the low melodies of a Pink Floyd cassette.
He’s nothing. He’s a dropout, a deadbeat, a worthless mess of high-functioning alcoholism and anger-management issues and bad jokes, and he knows it. The idea that an angel could ever look at him and see anything worth giving up his wings for has never made a lick of sense to Dean.
“It’s alright.”
Castiel isn’t quite sure how to respond. He clears his throat.
John stands guard for an hour, and Dean feigns sleep until finally, John seems to decide that there’s no imminent threat. He listens as he settles onto the floor nearby, waiting for his breathing to even out. As soon as it does, Dean carefully pushes to his feet. His wrist protests with the movement, but he grits his teeth against the pain and moves toward the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s almost asleep when it occurs to him that John never turns the radio on anymore, and it’s another glaring piece of evidence that the man behind the wheel is no longer his father. Not in any way that counts.
“You know there is.”
“About kissing him?” Castiel asks
For a moment, Castiel just listens to Dean breathe. Slow and measured, trying to calm himself down as he presses his hands over his eyes, thumbs rubbing at his temples.
“So it’s only gonna end in tears,” Dean says.
“So I don’t think the FBI pretext is gonna cut it this time,” Dean says a few minutes later as Castiel drives them across the Mississippi River, and with it, the Missouri-Illinois state line. Castiel raises his brow but doesn’t look away from the slow-moving truck they’ve somehow managed to get stuck behind.
With his skin crawling and his chest aching, Dean turns onto his side and tries to keep himself from listening for the approach of Cas’ footsteps coming up the hall. He honestly doesn’t know whether the sick squirm in his stomach is hope or dread.
“I promise,” Dean says without hesitation. “But, Dad—“
“And you think I’m not capable?”
“I was… I was possessed, wasn’t I? That’s what that was? A demon possessed me?”
Castiel hums in agreement.
It’s been sixteen months.
The morning sun is blinding, and Castiel doesn’t even have a second of consciousness before he remembers the previous night. Lying on his back, he stares at the ceiling and tries not to think about how much he’d hoped Dean would still be here.
“It’s date night, remember? I’m meeting Andrea,” he says, gesturing across the street toward the Italian restaurant where his girlfriend works. “You boys have fun, though.”
“Me, too,” Dean grins. “Best day I’ve had in years.”
Looking back now, he’s amazed that it took him so long to recognize his feelings for what they were.
Parker Thompson, on the other hand, only seems to grow more tense with every step they take into his home. After gesturing for them to sit on the couch, he perches on the very edge of a brown leather armchair, back rigid with his hands clenched on his knees.
“Ooh, intrigue,” she says, lifting her brow as she hops down from her stool.
He doesn’t feel as though he’s going mad, and yet it’s the most reasonable possibility. Tapping his pencil on the paper, he chews on his lip. The record stops playing, and Castiel stands to lift it from the turntable, sliding it back into the slipcover.
“Yeah, why? Did something—“
“I don’t come here very often,” he says after a moment.
I'm sorry. I won’t be back for a few more days :(
For a moment, Dean wonders if this is it. If this is his chance to run. But then he sees John opening a lockbox on the back of the truck to take out a tool bag and a shotgun, and his throat closes up. His palms sweat.
“This isn’t exactly a common situation,” Dean says.
He cries.
(See the end of the chapter for
in my life.”
This isn’t my apartment, Dean thinks, the realization hitting him far later than it probably should have, and he takes a step back out of view before the guy can see him, scrambling for the attic ladder in such a panic that he slips and kicks the side table, sending the pile of mail and the vase toppling onto the floor. Water splashes all over his leg and into his boot.
After a moment, he shrugs. It’s close enough. Dean is alive and he’s home, but the knowledge of all he’s endured is a weight that Castiel doesn’t know how to bear. Above all, he fears the possibility that Dean will see it written on his face. The idea of him seeing it makes him sick with shame.
“Yup.”
To put it bluntly, he’s felt like absolute shit all day.
“Life,” Castiel says simply, knowing there must be more to it, but unsure where to begin.
“But that doesn’t make any sense,” Sam is saying, brow raised as he looks from Jack back to Dean, and Dean wishes that he could just leave. Just lock himself in a room and let the dark consume him. “You were in trouble, what would he possibly—”
Worst of all, Sam saying nothing at all; just looking at them with pity or disgust.
Castiel’s cheeks grow hot, and he looks down at his hands again.
It had been foolish to say it—cruel, even, considering his timing—but with certain death mere moments away, he’d been incapable of holding himself back any longer.
“I… I’m not entirely sure why I called.”
“No, I mean—aren’t you tired of… of this.” He waves between them with an open hand, the movement far too casual to be anything but calculated, and glances back to meet Castiel’s eyes. “We could die tomorrow.”
“So it’s pretty much a straight-shot east,” he says, leaning forward over the steering wheel to check for traffic before he turns left onto US-36. “There’s a diner I like just outside Munroe City that should work for lunch, assuming it’s still there. Best Gerber sandwich I ever had, hands down. Or there’s this real good burger place in Hannibal. Always remembered it ’cause the name makes you think twice about what’s in the patty.”
He looks incredible. Flushed and hungry and more short of breath than an angel has any right to be, with his suit coat rumpled and hanging off his shoulders. His shirt is unbuttoned, his pants around his thighs. His cock is red and curving up out of the white cotton underwear that Dean never bothered to push all the way down. Dean wants to drop to his knees and swallow him whole. He wants it so bad his mouth waters.
“They are. They’ve been good for Sam, too. Did they tell you I’m driving out to Kansas City to get him and Jo tomorrow morning?”
“What do you—”
There were fireworks in the town they drove through last night, and more still all along the horizon, bursting in bright arcs across the sky. Ahead of them on the roadside, a billboard for Biggersons advertises a Fourth of July BBQ special.
, Castiel thinks. Keeping the truth locked away is what got them here—it’s what hurt them both more than anything else.
“Oh my God,” she says, and looks at Dean. “
Even in a best case scenario, if nobody gets killed, John is going to spend the rest of his days in the psych ward of some prison, either realising what he’s done, or believing with everything in him that the people closest to him were possessed by demons. Believing that his only surviving son abandoned him.
“Well, I’m glad I couldn’t,” he says, and this time Dean doesn’t make a joke. Instead, he takes one of Castiel’s hands in his own and lifts it to kiss the palm.
“Then let the good carry you through the bad,” the woman says, pushing to her feet as a blue Honda pulls up in front of them.
The walk back to camp is exhausting in the eighty degree weather, and when their tent comes back into view through the trees, Castiel can’t help but groan in relief. His own stomach started grumbling halfway back, and the thought of the meal they’re about to prepare has his mouth watering before they’ve even re-built the fire.
There are ten of them on board; Castiel, his co-pilot Daniel Fisher, their navigator Rufus Turner, bombardier Alfie Johnson, radio operator Chuck Shurley, flight engineer and top turret gunner Gabriel Sugarman, ball turret gunner Frank Devereux, waist gunners Andy Gallagher and Theo Pike, and tail gunner Bartholomew Messinger.
“I just wanted you to be able to go home.”
Suppressing his crush on Dean for these past couple of years hasn’t been easy, but it’s been manageable. Suppressing
, he’d said, and Dean hadn’t been able to meet his eye. Castiel doesn’t blame him.
Castiel stares at the note for a long time. After the last line, there’s a little drawing that he thinks is supposed to represent a smiling face, and the sight of it makes his chest ache. The note is so cheerful, so happily forthcoming about finding the agrimony that was the most difficult aspect of the spellbreaking ritual Hannah had given him.
Dean snorts.
But just for a few minutes, kneeling in that storeroom, he’d thought that perhaps this was the night. That Dean would make his move. That he’d summon the courage to make a move himself.
Posting this from the airport on my way to Rome for Jibcon, because apparently that’s a thing that’s happening... hopefully all the formatting pastes properly—had to do this from my phone because the airport wifi thinks Ao3 is an inappropriate website. If there are wonky italics I’ll have to fix them when I arrive! Hope you all enjoy the update :)
Digging his fingers into the back of his neck, Dean breathes deeply, slowly, sits down on the edge of the teacher’s desk, and tries to rationalize. He’s real.
“Yeah, I’m probably not far behind you,” Dean says with a smile. “Night, Cas.”
“Cas, I— I can’t, I just—”
charm to keep them preoccupied and out of harm's way. A wee bit of yarrow and bergamot, a simple incantation,  and they won’t have a care in the world.”
“So—”
“I wasn’t paying attention,” he admits, and rocks back on his heel. “I should rest.“
“The roads are a mess,” Sam says, voice shaky. “That’s why it took us so long to get back. We thought— when you didn’t answer your phone, we thought that you might’ve been gone, too.”
Castiel says his name like it’s equal parts curse and praise, and Dean’s mouth splits into a wide grin before he ducks forward to mouth over his hip again, deft fingers working open the button of Castiel’s suit pants.
If they drove an hour or so in the opposite direction, they’d end up in Ventura. They might run into Grandpa Campbell. Maybe even Sam, if that’s where he was sent. If he ever got out of the burning house. If he survived.
“You know?” There’s a dull thump as Sam sits on one of the swivelling seats at the table.
He seems strangely subdued.
Still standing by the bed, Castiel undresses them both slowly, sliding fingers between buttons and gently working them free before leaning in to press his lips to Dean’s chest. His kisses are light, his hands tickling over Dean’s ribs as he pushes the shirt aside.
“Then I wish you luck.”
“Oh, fuck off,” Dean says, though both his tone and the elbow he hooks around Castiel’s neck say otherwise.
It’s late, but there are still a few trucks in the parking lot, and he can smell fries cooking at the roadside diner from here. Salty. Hot. His mouth waters as he looks at the doorknob.
Thankfully, Dean opts to save his swimming for the following day and scouts out a good fishing spot while Castiel gets the fire going. He takes his fishing rod with him, just in case.
If one is true, then the other can’t be. By the time Sam picks up, Dean’s managed to push away most of the guilt.
“So, what are you thinking—we should be looking at the lore on demigods?”
Groaning, Dean rests his head in his hands.
“Yeah,” he replies, voice raspy. He clears his throat. “Yes. I think so.”
“He’s going on active duty?”
He braces himself before he speaks. Any doubt Castiel had about who’s calling falls away.
“Whoa, just— hold up a minute. We’re not gonna hurt you, okay?”
it, but just splashes his face, washes his hair, he’ll be safe. His entire body itches at the thought.
“Well, all the computers in the world are kind of connected. I can access just about any information I want. Like, um. Like a library, sort of.”
doesn’t mean a whole lot if you’re evil. Or a god,” he gestures loosely. “Or both.”
“Um,” Sam says. “Hi?”
he adds, “If something truly bothers you, it’s not bullshit. And I’d prefer you told me. Don’t try to spare my feelings by diminishing your own.”
“You like that?” Dean asks, a little breathless, and licks over the head again. “The thought of me waiting?”
For the first time in the year since he bought it, Castiel doesn’t take offence at Jo insulting his car.
Shadows move across the walls, the trees outside making shapes like long-fingered arms of smoke as every rapid flash of lightning filters through the thin curtain, and for the first time in two weeks, Dean is glad that he’s alone. If John were here, he’d see those shadows and find demons in them. Dean knows better, he
Dean shrugs. It’s not surprising, considering his jacket ended up here.
Castiel doesn’t believe him for a second. On instinct, he hooks his foot around the back of Dean’s thigh to urge him closer.
“That was only like... five or six hours for me.”
“Is this what you wanted?”
“I don't know. Though I do think that there are a lot of things we don’t say to one another, and… I think that doesn’t help.”
“Ah,” he says, nodding carefully. “Well, that certainly makes more sense.”
“I don’t know.”
“Language!” Mary says from inside the house, and pushes the creaking wire door open to raise her eyebrow at her son. There’s paint on her hands, splattered on the front of her shirt. “Dean, are you going to go pack a bag, or will I have to do it for you?”
They both stare down at their ruined lunch in disbelief.
“Hopefully he’ll have the presence of mind to wait until his wife comes home.” Castiel says. “Perhaps we could let him know when the demons have been dealt with? It might give him some peace of mind.”
“Dean feels the same,” Sam adds, tone pointed as he glances over at Castiel again. His knuckles are white where he’s gripping the wheel. “He’s... he...” Sam sighs and shakes his head minutely. “Listen, I hope I’m not way off base here, but... you get how it came across, right? What you said? The way you said it?”
“Come up here,” he says, reaching for him. “Let me touch you.”
Their own kid.
The photo is in near perfect condition, not a single crease in the paper, and from the surface Castiel Novak--dressed in the jacket that lays on the chair a few feet away--smiles out at them with his arm flung around a tall, fair-haired man in a matching jacket, both standing in front of the B-17. His hand is hanging down past the man’s shoulder, obscuring his name printed on the chest save for the first initial D. The lieutenant’s smile is radiant.
!” John screams, louder now, and Dean can see blood on his hands where they’re gripping the steering wheel. There’s blood on the door, too. A splatter of it. A spray.
There’s been a lump in Dean’s throat since they left Chicago. His whole body is tense, preparing for a fight that isn’t coming. Castiel is silent in the passenger seat.
Cas holds perfectly still, hard and pulsing insistently against Dean’s prostate. Dean squeezes around him, and Cas’ mouth falls open at the feeling.
“Thank you for your time, Dr Thompson,” he says.
Pushing himself up onto his elbows, Castiel regards him with a frown.
“Sparing me of what?”
It’s just for a couple of seconds. A couple of long, agonizing seconds when he asks himself if the
He has no idea where on Earth they’re supposed to go from here. If he should try to play off what he said as nothing. If he should deign to address it at all.
There are six files in the folder that Sam sent. He skips the book for now, and looks at the pictures first. One is a pair of newspaper articles from the Normal Inquirer, dated about a week apart and scanned side by side. The earliest announces WAR HERO MISSING in heavy print, and includes a grainy photograph of Novak in a white collared shirt, arms crossed over his chest as he frowns at the camera. He’s got dark, unkempt hair, and the set of his jaw puts Dean in mind of a young Marlon Brando. Basically, he’s gorgeous, and Dean can’t help but feel a little cheated by the universe at the knowledge that he’s sixty years too late to check him out in person.
that would tie this place to Dean or Sam. Instead, he found books on world history, scientific journals, and countless biographies of every influential artist and writer under the sun. Every imaginable topic was covered—from molecular physics and evolutionary theory to the history of the piano and the social habits of birds of prey. Every subject but the occult.
“I love you, Jack. And I’m sorry that I never said it. I’m sorry for how I’ve treated you. I want to do better. To be the… to be the kind of dad that you deserve.”
“This isn’t fighting,” Castiel tells him. “And this is
Dean remembers single seconds as though they spanned entire days, each fragment rendered in his mind's eye with startling clarity. At the same time, he’s missing entire minutes. Maybe even hours.
Halfway across, Dean glances back over his shoulder to grin at him.
.” Castiel wrinkles his nose. “But it was about… four years ago? Not long before Bobby’s accident.”
As much as he wishes it wasn’t true, Castiel knows it is. And he’s proud of Dean for acknowledging it. For keeping himself from transferring his codependent tendencies from one person to another. The brothers are more solid than they’ve ever been, now that their relationship isn’t the fraught, tense, all-or-nothing disaster that it’s been since they were children, and Castiel is more thankful for it than he can express. He knows Mary feels the same.
In the passenger seat, Dean starts counting all the ways that this could go very bad, very quickly. He doesn’t think John is likely to risk ramming the woman’s van, but then again, until very recently he wouldn’t have thought it was likely for him to do
, and he’s going to lose control, and Dean is—
He moves to walk away, to give Dean the space he needs. He’s not planning to go any further than the library to wait for Sam to return, but Dean’s hand catches his arm before he can get further than a step.
Grinning and pink-cheeked, Dean returns the phone to his ear.
First, they deal with the nine that they already knew about. The Sheriff with his missing heart, the two teenage girls covered in blood, and the six party guests who hadn’t managed to outrun Gacy’s ghost. But after sweeping through the town centre and the houses that spread out on either side, they find more.
“Cas?”
want you. But you’ve barely slept in the past four days, and I don’t think I need to tell you how bad that is for your wellbeing.”
“Yes,” he says simply. “I am.”
At some point, Castiel is going to have to let Dean know that the only reason he doesn’t have heart disease is because he’s been quietly maintaining his arterial health whenever he’s healed an injury for the past decade.
Darting his tongue out over his lower lip before he pulls it between his teeth, Dean takes a steadying breath through his nose and tries to redirect his blood flow to his brain as he meets Cas’ eyes.
He’d wished, on occasion, that his grandparents or his mom would break the promises they’d made to him and tell John that Dean’s true interest lay in tailoring, but they never did. Each of them kept their word, and Dean’s secret, as though it were sacred.
“Oh, believe me. I have a
get used to this.
, he thinks suddenly, with startling clarity.
“You did,” Dean interrupts his thoughts, and it takes a moment for Castiel to remember what they’d even been talking about. The god-awful movie they’re about to see. He frowns harder still and keeps walking, following Benny in the dark and trusting that he knows which door to lead them through.
He blinks and lowers the photo to the armrest as it occurs to him that essentially, that’s how he ended up here in Normal instead of staying in Lawrence. Maybe he had to leave because of how he couldn’t be the person his old friends saw him as, but that’s not so different to what Castiel and this man had to do.
“Shall we begin?”
going to Georgio’s.”
“Essentially, they felt that my... proclivities were out of line with their faith, and demanded I fall in line. I could not, so they told me to leave.”
"Nova, Nova wake up." Sam kneels by her side and shakes her body, calling her name. Nova groans and finally opens her eyes.
“No. If something happens to you, then I’ll have to bring back your ass too, and if I bring back Dean’s ass first, he’s gonna beat mine because I let you do this. We will find another way.” he belts.
She wanted to go with them, but Dean didn’t want to be worried about her while trying to save his brother.
“there’s a place here” he points the state of Iowa “it’s kinda off the beaten track, the GPS won’t find it.” he explains, but still not fully telling her what they’re going to do.
“Thank God you’re back,” she whispers while holding him tight.
Two weeks went by, not a single call, nothing.
“Tell me we have a plan.” she sobbed, again feeling her chest getting heavier.
Arms down his side, glossy eyes staring at her face.
“uh-hm” Nova mumbled while curling on herself. Her body isn’t new to drugs, but after the time she spent sober, it takes her a while to pass the effects.Street lights force her to keep her eyes shut. Her heart has slowed down, but her body is still too warm.
"I'll do my best."
Dean was dead, she didn’t say goodbye to him, she didn’t saw him one last time.
“C’mon... Get rid of it.” she whisper to herself. She leans against the wall slowing sliding down. “Fuck.”
“Look, that’s not mine. My friend forgot it at my home. I’ll leave it there. I can’t bring it with me. You can use it or throw it away. I don’t care.” she says, giving her a pat on the shoulder and leaving the bathroom. Nova grabs the foil and goes for the toilet.
“I drive, I don’t know how I’m supposed to read this thing.” Sam nods, packing up all his stuff.
“I need to know... I need to know we can bring him back. Please.”
"No, he didn't even get out of the car. Miller told me they're working on a case, but he didn't tell me more." he stands up, rubbing his face and stretching his back.
“Are you asking me why I don’t throw myself under a train or...?” Sam sighs, obviously don’t appreciate the joke.
Hey there! First chapter is out, I hope it isn't as bad as it looks to me after keeping it in the drafts for almost a year.
The room smells terrible, and there are clothes everywhere on the floor.
“You just don’t give a fuck! You never did. After all, what kind of father would put his kids through this fucked up hell of a life? You let him die, years ago, didn’t you? That’s why you don’t care!”
“What the fuck are you doing? Huh?” Sam walks into the bathroom shouting over the music. Her head tilts up. White powder on her upper lip and a lost glance toward the figure that’s towering above her.
"You and your reckless ass will give me a heart attack eventually." he smiled, helping her to get on her feet. While getting up, a yellow envelope fall out of her jacket. Sam takes it and opens it.
She takes a couple of deep breaths and steps in a circle made of stones. The sun is almost down, and the sky is tinted in a blazing red and orange. Nova starts reading the spell.
Nova returns in, closes the door and head to the door on the back.
She slowly calmed down, so that Sam could let her go. Nova kept staring at John, with hate burning in her eyes.
“You look tense, scared of drugs, princess?” she jokes. Nova clenches her punches long her sides.
“No chocolate on the pillow,” Nova speaks, sitting on her bed and tossing away the blankets.
She walks out while sipping her cappuccino. It's a beautiful day, she will enjoy her breakfast at the park, sitting on a bench.
“We burnt it.” she snapped her head toward Sam, totally in disbelief.
“He was fighting with a vampire” Sam inserted himself in the talk, but his voice breaks, leaving the sentence incomplete.
What happened after have learned that isn’t clear.
“You know what’s the difference between you and him? He wouldn’t have given up so fast. Never.” words flow out like thick lava. “Dean would have been out there, turning everything upside down to find even the weakest chance to bring you back.” she squeezes her eyes, feeling her chest getting heavier.Three months passed by since Dean’s death, but nothing changed. She’s still there, sitting in her car, hands on the wheel, crying her eyes out calling his name.
It was clearly a setup, but they must find Sam.
"Oh-hm, yeah. It is." she answers coughing a little.
“Ok, the good news is that I know where to find what you want. The bad news is that we need to repeat that, tomorrow to get it.” the man explains.
“Why isn’t Dean here, John?” she asked again, but without really wanting to hear an answer.
"You got a new partner, huh?" she avoids the question, but genuinely curious about the new cop.
“That’s enough, Nova. It won’t make it better.” Sam spoke behind her back.
“We can’t let him use you as a vessel. We don’t even know who or what is gonna use you.”
"I need to make a call, get out." he says dryly. Nova tosses what she picked up on the armchair and leaves the room.
Nova starts to speak, but what she says makes no sense. It sounds like Arabic, but it’s not. The man speaks back to her, they’re having a conversation like two friends hanging out at the bar. Sam’s about to freak out when they stop talking, and Nova closes her eyes. She’s back. “You good?” Sam asks, worried. Nova looks around confused, but nods to let Sam know she’s fine.
She didn’t even have a body to mourn.
"I think he went for a jog, I'll let him know you passed by. There's anything else I can help you with?" the agent shakes his head in disbelief.
He leans over her, slowly dropping his head on her shoulder, hiding his face into the crack of her neck.
“What the hell is wrong with you? I leave for ten fucking minutes and I find you doing coke in a goddamn stall.” she leans against the dirty tiles, shutting her eyes. The last time she felt the drug in her body, she almost died. She never thought she could stay sober for more than a week, but he did the magic. Kinda ironic for a witch.
“I’m drawing a path” he says like it’s the most obvious thing in the world “so we won’t get lost.” he adds, but Nova rolls her head and eyes back.
-doing that?”
”WHAT?”
Dean gulped down his last bite. Cas once again marveled at how quickly the man ate.
Have fun reading it!
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas considered his options for a moment. Obviously telling Dean was out of the question, and that lie seemed as good as any.
“Cas, you didn’t...you didn’t do that to yourself?”
”Yeah?”
Cas spoke quietly, still ashamed.
”We don’t have to talk about it.”
”So, you-“
Later, alone, safe in his room, Cas sat down on his bed, leaning against the wall, and dropped his Angel Blade from his sleeve to his hand. He pulled up his sleeve and sighed, noticing that the blood from the morning’s cuts had seeped through his dress shirt, staining it with lines of red. No time to deal with that now. Cas held the Angel Blade carefully and pressed it into his inner forearm, then slowly dragged it across. The cut wasn’t very deep and didn’t bleed enough. He tried again, this time using the sharp tip of the blade and pressing harder into his skin. Dragging it across was very painful, causing him to inhale sharply. This cut was deeper, clearly showing the incision. Red seeped from under his skin, filling the cut and overflowing. Cas watched it fill up, entranced. So entranced by the movement of the blood as it started down the side of his arm that he didn’t hear the footsteps outside of his door in time. He flinched when the door handle squeaked, starting to turn. As the door swung open, all he could do was hide the Angel Blade away and hastily pull down his sleeve.
"Agent, good morning" she greets the agent Miller with a fake smile "what brings you here, so early in the morning?" her glance goes on the bar behind the cop, where another agent is waiting. She can only see his profile, but he doesn't look too old.
The clouded windows made it impossible to see what kinda car was.
A tall man showed on the passenger side and she could finally relax.
“Get in,” he mumbles without looking at her.That trip has been a total bust. Sam thought that Cassie, a retired hunter, could have been useful, and she actually gave them something to work with, but the deal they made was risky.
“No w- “Nova interrupts Sam “Fine. I’ll do it.” she assures. Sam looks at her, not convinced. “Perfect. You’ll hear from me. I’ll let you know when and where.” “You don’t have my number.” Nova points out. He smiles.“Oh, don’t worry. I won’t need it.” he says before leaving them at the table.
“Cash or credit?” an old man with a long bear asks Sam while Nova leans against the counter facing the exit.Sam hands him the cash and takes the key.They walk through a long hallway with flickering lights.This place is trash, but they definitely slept in places way worse than this before.Sam keeps walking, looking at the numbers on the doors.
“N-no. Thanks” she wipes her hands on her jeans.
“I’ll find a way”
"Don't be stupid," he whispers while waiting "you better not die."
"Nothing, my ass! You're always up to something. And it's never something good. I had to lie to them. Miller was with a dude from the FBI. You better watch out. I won't risk my life for you." she states looking at him.
“Alright, there’s the plan” Sam tosses some papers on the table, putting aside his laptop. He unrolls a map and starts to write down crosses and circles.
"Oh, sorry" he splutters "well, I was walking around, it helps me think." Castiel explain. She nods, not really sure what to believe him or not.
"Wait, come again?" Nova asks, clearly confused.
She worked her ass off and lost herself trying to pay her college tuition.
He sits on the bed with his laptop on his laps trying to track Nova's phone.
"No, he's FBI agent, they're working on a case here, but that's none of your business, Nova. Where's your father?" Nova sighs, crossing her arms over her chest.
man talking about what’s wrong, but not this time.
After a long pause Sam sighed “ I don’t know if it’s possible and I don’t know how we could do it, but I know I’ll do everything I can.” the rain slowly stopped, letting the sun shyly sneaking up a little between the dark clouds. Nova nodded, taking a deep breathe “Where do we start?”
She will regret it. It wasn’t fucking worth it, but she already knew it. So why do it anyway?
“We’re closing.” a woman around her fifty shouted without turning her back. “We’re looking for Cassie.” Sam speaks, making her turn. She looks at them with a bothered look on her face. After a couple seconds she shakes her head in disbelief, letting go a smile. “I’ll be damned! The little Winchester, God, your not so little anymore.” she states hugging Sam. “What brings you here? And where’s your brother?” her smile remains on her face. Nova stays silent, not knowing what to say.
Nova has absolutely no idea of what happened, but she’s sure something must be wrong.
She finally unlocked the door, and he got in.
But now, she was once again alone, with no idea of what is going to be her next move.
"The FBI? Did he say what he wanted?" now he's sitting with his back against the wall.
“I’m trying to trust that we’re going to find a way to bring you back... But it’s hard.” the chances that he can hear her are low, but she doesn’t care.She’s stubborn, but that situation is beyond her in many ways. That’s death. How is she supposed to beat death?Quick steps arrived at her ears, and she turned back to see Sam walking toward the impala.
"Your name," Nova starts, "your name, it isn't very common." she points out.
Eyes wide open, her knees went weak, forcing her to hold on to the table.
The rest of the ride goes smoothly, and they arrive at Cassie’s place. Nova kills the engine, and the car goes silent. “It’s 2am, should we wait for tomorrow?” Sam asks, looking at his phone display. Nova turns her head toward the light sign and looks at the window. “The light is still on, maybe there are still people inside. We can try. Maybe someone can give us a place to crash for the night.” she shrugs her shoulders. Sam agrees.
“Yeah, that’s what you said about an hour ago.” Nova sighs, holding her head on her clenched hand. The Impala starts to make a weird noise.
“he’s dead.”
“I need to pee, wait there.” she runs to the toilets and goes into the first stall. The main door opens, and she hears heels tapping on the dirty tiles. A couple seconds pass by and Nova leaves the stall. She walks toward the sink to wash her hands and glance at the girl squatting next to the sink. She sees a white line on the counter when the girl tilts up her head to look at Nova.
“Dean” Nova lets him go and puts her hands on his cheek “Dean, look at me, please” so he does. Still heavy breathing but now focused on her eyes.
“You did what?” Nova whispered, feeling her head going dizzy.
“So what, now we trust witches? That’s ridiculous.” she hisses. Witches are sneaky, and they don’t like hunters.
“No. I just had a rough day.” the girl nods.
He set on a chair and took a deep breath.
“No one knows this place but hunters. They go there to play pool, drink and stuff like that. Cassie works there, an old friend. She has worked with a coven for years, if we’re lucky enough she will help us get in touch with witches that know where to find what we need for the spell, or something like that.” Nova turns her nose.
“No, Sam, there is not! It’s my choice, I’ll do what I have to.” Sam is about to reply when Nova restart speaking
“Yeah, I can see that. But you didn’t say where we’re going. And why we just don’t use the GPS?” she asks, still confused.
“you want...?” she asks, pointing at the remaining line on the counter. Nova hesitates, the words are stuck in her throat.
No one ever thought of her as an actual person.
“What happened? What’s wrong Dean?” she asks while still holding him tight.
She can't get rid of it, not now.
She burst into tears, her body began to shake due to the sobs. Silent tears running down her cheeks. Body leaned against the seat, she felt empty, no more tears, no anger or pain.
"Shit" two bangs on the door make her heart skip a beat "Yeah, I'm coming!" she shouts from the office, still checking around.
“Here’s” key in the latch, the doors opens and a hand goes for the switch.
"Open the door!" Nova walks through the garage, avoiding all the stuff on the floor.
She remembers her hands on John’s chest and face, screaming at him it was his fault.
“You look like you need it.” the girl laughs a little.
Sam knocked on the windows, standing under the heavy rain.
"Who are them? And what's your angle? Because you didn't tell me that and I'm pretty sure charity isn't exactly your thing." he smirks, handing her an old book.
She saw her friend die, and that’s how she met Dean and Sam.
“And...? C’mon Sam just tell me the entire thing, please?” a huff leaves Nova’s mouth. Sam tilts his head a little, but he starts talking right after.
The rearview mirror showed two headlights in the rain getting close. When the car pulled over behind her car. Nova quickly got her gun from the glove compartment. She wiped off her tears and waited for the car to go away.
"There's your cappuccino, and your donut." Nova thanks the girl and leaves the cash on the counter.
Dean called for John’s help. They started following the nest that was moving to Vermont.
“So, who told you I was your man?” a pale man with a drawn face sits in front of Sam and Nova. He’s the man Cassie told them about. “A friend. We need a couple of things, I’m sure we can work out a deal that will make both of us happy.” Sam says while handing him a list. “Dragon breath, phoenix ashes and... What do you need these things for?” he inquires, showing discomfort. “That’s not your concern. Can you find these things?” the music is loud, and it makes hard to even hear their own thoughts. “I think so. But that’s not something you can find easily...” he starts, but Sam interrupts him. “what’s gonna take?” the man smiles, adjusting in his seat. He moves his eyes on Nova.
“That’s why I’m here, Cassie. I- we need your help,” he explains “Oh, and she’s Nova, she’s a friend.” Nova shakes Cassie’s hand with a coy smile. “What happened?” Sam summarizes what happened. He shows the old spell they found to localize Dean's soul, but they have no idea where to find some ingredients.
They stay in silence for a couple of minutes, trying to process what just happened and what will possibly happen tomorrow. “We should go.” Sam speak, looking up at her.
“Is not like we have a choice, Sam.” Nova sighs. She leans in her seat, covering her eyes with her palms.
"Is you father there?" agent Miller asks, but Nova keeps looking at the man in the car. He's wearing a trench coat and has his elbow resting on the window.
"I know." he concedes "It's an angel name" the say with one voice, looking at each other surprised.
His heart pounding so much that Nova can feel it against her chest.
“Dean made me install it on your car” he admitted. She looked at him confused “and asked me to never tell you.” he added.
"Nothing." his voice is lower and slurred.
“breath with me, ok?” he nods and starts to mimic her respiratory rate.
Then killed the lights and the engine while the sky kept turning dark and darker. Nova shrugged her shoulders, letting go of the wheel.
Dean was Sam’s only firm point, and now they both were like wrecked boats in the open ocean.
“You good?” Sam’s voice is low, cold. That tone hasn’t changed since Dean’s death. He’s like an empty shell, and she can relate why too well to him.
They keep looking at each other for a couple seconds, before Miller drives away.
“Where’s Dean?” she managed to ask, switching her glance from Sam to John.
