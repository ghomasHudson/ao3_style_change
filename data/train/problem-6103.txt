“I’m sorry, sir, but it seems as though something has magically interfered with Doctor Strange’s digital footprint. I have not been successful at tracking him.”
. It was unprincipled. It was--” Tony’s complaints stutter to a halt as Steve obliges him by pulling his shirt off and tossing it onto the floor.
“Good thing I’ve got an expert in 21st century nighttime customs here, to explain them to me,” Steve quips. He’s smiling again. And Tony resolutely tells himself that Steve didn’t mean for it to sound as innuendo-laden as it had. It’s

“I’m not stopping you,” Rogers retorts, words clipped. It’s a tone of voice that Tony is used to hearing over comms during Rogers’ fights with HYDRA, but which Rogers tends to keep resolutely under wraps in other, non-superheroic circumstances. Great.
“Can you please explain to me,” Pepper says evenly, like she’s praying for patience, “why you were photographed yesterday afternoon
Natasha locked eyes with Clint and then very deliberately threw back the rest of their shared cocoa. Clint threw up his hands.
Before Steve can figure out whether it’s better to keep Tony on the phone or let him go, Tony decides for them both by saying, “Sure thing, Cap” almost absently, like his mind’s already jumped to something else. And then the line goes dead.
Tony him off before he can walk back his own suggestion. “You got it. One hot shower, coming up. Let’s just go into the living room so I can grab something sharp enough to cut through your uniform. You OK with that?”
?” Rogers blurted out, and both Tony and Bruce turned to stare at him. He flushed – which was another thing Tony could have lived his whole life without seeing on his own face – and fixed his eyes on the snowy ground. “I just mean…you wouldn’t just get detention. She’d probably expel you or something.”
“Your lab!” Strange stares at Tony like he’s been body-snatched. “Has there been an attack? Is everyone alright?”
“Nailed it,” Tony murmured under his breath as he dragged Steve away by the arm. The Third Years meanwhile had gone suspiciously silent behind them. “Who knows what rumors those little monsters will start spreading now.”
“JARVIS,” Tony sighed, squelching over to inspect the damage. “Start a column in the spreadsheet for “Interests and Hobbies.””
Tony takes a deep breath, and can’t help but let out a bit of a laugh on the exhale. “It’s fine, JARVIS. Even the best of intentions are no match for Pepper. You’d better put her through.”
Tony froze. In truth, he’d been brewing without really thinking about it. He’d taught himself to brew this potion in third year as part of a prank, and then he’d gotten curious enough to start tweaking the recipe. When Tony looked down at their cauldron with a growing sense of dread, it was to find that their potion was a perfect shade of sunshine yellow. He shot a quick, panicked glance over at Bruce and Rogers’ bench. Their potion was more of a bright lemon, which was much more plausible for someone’s first try at brewing it.
“It’s really not a big deal. I just wondered if, um, if there’s any way I could take a shower? Hot water helps sometimes. I know it won’t be easy, with—“
Rogers’ expression barely changes – except perhaps for a slight clenching of his jaw –but he practically crushes Tony’s hand in his, like he’d tried to ball his fists but had forgotten that Tony is still attached.
Meanwhile, the server’s eyes are widening in alarm at the turn this conversation has taken, and Steve has finally had enough.
“Clint wants these,” Natasha said, breezing into the kitchen at 4:30am. Tony cursed and caught his coffee mug right before it tipped, and then had to juggle both the mug and the piece of paper that Natasha had just shoved into his hands.
“What? No! I’ve never been less in the middle of anything in my life. More of a beginning and ends kind of person, you know, just very
scientist, and not a magician with delusions of grandeur, I am perfectly willing to revise my hypotheses in the face of new evidence. Not to mention, this totally feels like one of those climactic moments where the music swells, and we’ve all gained new self-knowledge, and a certain curse is lifted. So...”
“Alright…” Steve starts, very slowly. “You came to pick me up, and clearly something happened between us. What was it?”
“Well, that’s alright,” Steve said slowly. “It’s not like I blame you for getting it wrong, you told me from the start that you weren’t sure.”
. At first I thought it was me, but um,” Rogers looks awkward. “I can hear your breathing,” he rushes out in a low tone, face flushing.
Tony moonwalked out of the hallway as quietly as possible, and then hurried down to his lab to think.
, Steve insists to himself, trying to regulate the sudden racing of his heart through pure stubbornness alone. He busies himself with sketching in Tony’s face.
“Wait, no, that isn’t--” he rushes to say, before he stalls, and has to take a deep breath to start again. “I keep trying to…do the right thing, with you, but somehow I keep screwing it up. I only meant. I wanted you to be safe, and I wanted you to keep the Avengers, and it seemed like I was just making that harder for you. I couldn’t have left for anything less. That’s all I—um.”
“There is no need,” Odinson said, and Tony wondered how Odinson managed to make that assertion sound tranquil rather than arrogant. “It is I who I believe can help
to…” Steve trailed off, but Natasha seemed to know what he meant, because she nodded sympathetically.
Steve paused again. Tony hadn’t heard this many unfinished sentences out of him since he’d gotten choked by a Doombot last summer. And maybe it was that – or maybe it was the slight flush that was creeping up his neck, or the way his hands were fidgeting in front of him in a totally un-Steve-like way, or maybe it was Tony himself, and his giddy certainty that what he was feeling now was
“And, look, if we don’t solve it before the start of term, I agree that we should probably go to McGonagall,
Tony himself was only saved serious injury by Romanoff’s quick reflexes. She pulled him away from the cauldron and practically hauled him, coughing, into the corridor. And then she rather ruined the gesture by shoving him into a wall and saying, in a perfectly even tone of voice that nevertheless promised
And that’s…not a bad point, Steve concedes, albeit grudgingly. He shades in a few more details of the Iron Man suit as he considers it. “I don’t have to work within the system, though. You don’t.”
. Rogers can’t be asleep; he must be holding himself deliberately still. Now that Tony’s thinking about it, he can indeed feel the tension in Rogers’ hand.
“Sorta,” Tony says, trying not to look as uncomfortable with the direction of this discussion as he feels.
Because Tony is a mature adult who can acknowledge his own flaws, he could admit that now, in the light of the TV room, the wreaths looked like a reindeer festively trampled a bowler hat.
you wanted to talk to me so badly you turned to crime? Usually it tends to go the other way around.”
“It’s not fair for you to do all the work, not when the spell’s affecting both of us,” Steve had insisted. “You’ll just have to wait until I’m done pretending I know anything about Ancient Runes.”
Tony closed his eyes and forced himself to stand very still, poised on the balls of his feet like a runner suspended in the breath before the starting gun.
He pulls Tony over to the rolling chair that Happy had brought from Stark Tower, and which has been sitting in the corner of Rogers’ living room with the rest of Tony’s lab scraps. Rogers sits down on the chair, props his feet against its wheels, and then gives Tony a small smile, the Captain America equivalent of anyone else throwing out their arms and proclaiming “ta-da!”
. Of course Rogers wears socks – must logically have been wearing them every time he and Tony ever spoke. But even faced with this very concrete evidence of socks, Tony is struggling to wrap his mind around the sight of them.
Rogers doesn’t turn away from his consideration of the coffee maker. “You’re right. A machine? That boils water? Feels like witchcraft to me.”
Tony, meanwhile, has found the door he’s looking for, partially concealed in a hallway off the main ballroom. He pulls Steve into the small supply closet before flipping on an overhead light. They just barely fit pressed up against each other in the tight space.
She was just turning to go and Tony was contemplating slinking back to his lab when he was struck with sudden inspiration.
There’s something Tony hasn’t been telling him. Steve can hear the strange ambiguity in moments like this: moments where Tony hesitates, tempering his reactions when he used to barrel through them full speed ahead. Steve wonders if it has to do with Ultron, but whatever it is, Tony has refused to talk about it, exhibiting levels of avoidance that would almost be impressive -- if they didn’t give Steve such vivid flashbacks of himself, right after the Battle of New York, stuck in Ohio and watching his best chance of running from his problems
“Oh,” Steve says, very quietly. Tony’s expression transitions rapidly from desire, through hasty repression, and directly into alarm. He starts to pull back, presumably to place some distance between them, but that is literally the
Strange had laughed a little hysterically, and Tony had found himself growing concerned about the man despite himself.

spectacularly unfair! Massimiliano has known Tony since he was six years old, and yet in all that time, Tony has
Maybe it’s the fact that Steve’s still groggy, but an honest answer slips out before he’s thought about it. “This phone goes both ways, Tony. You’re still my first call.”
“Wha—” Tony yelped as he was hit directly in the face with the spray of a fire extinguisher. The victim of his tinkering gave off a loud sizzle and some horrible-smelling smoke, which finally cleared enough for Tony to see Dummy, extinguisher-in-claw, whirring eagerly.
“Yes, good job, you did it, you saved the day.” Tony pet Dummy on the top of his claw, and narrowly ducked a fire extinguisher to the face. “Okay, it’s definitely time to put that down now, the fire is gone – oh, why the
“Actually,” Tony cuts in. “I should really get back to some tests I have running. Those flux capacitors, you know, not very stable. Can’t leave them alone for too long.”
. Sometimes Steve just wanted to be a seventeen-year-old who was tired of haunting these cold, dark corridors.
“No, you don’t understand. I must not have travelled back in time like I thought. I must have travelled to a completely different universe.”
Rogers’ hand spasms in his, but when Tony glances at his face, he’s just frowning that familiar frown-of-vague-disapproval.
“They do Muggle post here. So you could write to your friend, if you wanted. We could send him some chocolate from Honeydukes, and just say it’s a common British brand. Americans will accept a
. Pepper had been ill. Tony hadn’t seen her in lessons or at meals for days, and he knew she’d be worried about her Arithmancy essay, and probably hungry for more than the Madame Pomfrey-approved foods that the House Elves had been instructed to bring her. But when Tony had tried to explain this all to Rogers, he’d been incredulous.
, Tony thinks hysterically. After all of Pepper’s meticulous preparation for every awkward eventuality they might encounter at this gala, perhaps the one scenario she
Twenty minutes later, Steve Rogers bursts into Tony’s workshop in all his shield-wielding glory to find Tony gazing at the empty space where a wizard from another universe – apparently – had just disappeared in a gratifyingly cinematic puff of smoke.
, but to Steve, the trajectory of their fraying relationship had always seemed so clear: Tony pulling back since Ultron, Tony trusting Steve less and less, Tony acting like Steve’s judgment was flawed when it came to Bucky and the Accords,
“You are welcome. Luckily, I have written to my brother. He suggests re-casting the spell under the same conditions.”
“Maybe it was in Chapter Two,” Tony murmured. He prodded absently at the pages with his wand, biting his teeth with his tongue, and Steve had just enough time to cast
He considered the problem as he crunched, and Pepper winced, and Rhodey went back to his eggs. What did Rhodey, Pepper, and Steve Rogers possibly have to say to each other in the mornings? They must talk – they’d shared a common room for several years. Then again, Rhodey had always participated cheerfully enough in Tony’s various rants about Rogers, so maybe they really weren’t friends.
been playing with nanotechnology lately,” he muses. “I’ve been thinking about ways I might incorporate it into the suit. There’s a preliminary prototype I’ve been tinkering with in my spare time. It’s possible that a gauntlet made out of nanoparticles could adjust itself to form around both our hands. We’d still have to seriously coordinate our fighting styles, but the main snag to this plan is that I’d have to finish the prototype for the housing unit by hand.”
The second thing Tony saw was Evil Twin Tony’s school tie, swinging out of his collar as he leaned over Tony (
“Yeah, about that,” Tony interjects, still annoyed at the interruption. “Care to explain why you put us under a fuck-or-die spell?”

Tony was so great at fake parties, it took him living with the Avengers to realize how bad he was at real ones.
Tony kind of assumes, based on his anxious binder-reading, the Steve is going to freeze up the moment they exit the limo into the noise of the crowd of journalists, paparazzi, and fans. Not to mention the flashing lights of the cameras. In the tiny part of his mind that Tony had assigned to care about this gala – leaving the majority of his brain to focus on more interesting things – he’d basically planned on having to shepherd Steve through it. Which is fine; Tony’s done it enough times himself that it’s pretty easy for him at this point.
By Christmas Eve, Tony had tried everything that might solve the mystery of Steve’s gift. He’d made and discarded seven more spreadsheets, and reams of half-written equations. He’d bullied JARVIS into trawling the internet for gift suggestions – JARVIS was still refusing to speak to him for that one – and he’d even tracked down Natasha and tried the begging thing again, but the only result of that was that she disappeared so entirely that nobody has seen her in three days, and it’s only the facts that her tea mugs are piling up in the dishwasher and the TV is always turned to the Hallmark Channel that inform them she’s still in residence in the Tower at all.
“Well, like I said, this particular spell is often used in interpersonal therapy situations, or even teambuilding retreats. Think of it like…a magical icebreaker exercise.”
Tony meanwhile has pulled up a set of blueprints on his tablet that he’s supposed to be approving for R&D. He can’t help but sneak glances at Rogers instead. Over the years of their reluctant allyship, Tony has seen Rogers striding, running, fighting, and glaring. But Tony is struggling to remember if he’s ever seen Rogers like this: un-self-conscious, his body arranged for comfort rather than posed for intimidation, or preparing for a deadly flurry of movement.
Steve forces himself to look away from the mouthwatering outline of Tony’s cock in a pair of scarlet silk boxers, since he needs to make sure Tony understands how thoroughly affronted he is. “I’m Captain America, I don’t
“That was the pure and honest truth,” Steve insists, doing the best version of the Virtuous Patriot look a man can do when his boyfriend is ruthlessly divesting him of his pants. “And
“Leaving aside the question of whether Barnes was actually himself, or whether his HYDRA conditioning turned him into another person entirely…which is definitely getting

trying, Rogers, but you keep getting drowned out by this loud whining noise. You might wanna upgrade your comms,” Tony retorts mildly, and is gratified to hear a growl of irritation in response.
Steve doesn’t quite stick the landing – he kind of bounces against the corner of Tony’s mouth before finally getting it right, but Tony’s lips are soft against Steve’s, and already parted slightly, in surprise or possibly a warning. Steve makes a pleased hum and presses closer against the warmth of Tony’s body, while Tony exhales a gust of breath that could almost be a laugh before gently pushing Steve away by the shoulders.
“Um? I called you, and I think I asked you to send a car? I dunno, Tony. It was a while ago, and I was pretty drunk. Can we just—”
, so it’s not like it was— But. I don’t want to add more pressure on the team right now, we’re still figuring out how things’ll work with Vision and Wanda, and I’m not saying
“I do actually know the word for it,” Steve tells him, amused in spite of himself. And maybe if Steve were a little drunker – or if his face weren’t quite so close to Tony’s already – he’d miss the expression of pure

“No, Steve, you don’t get it,” Tony snapped, inadvertently echoing Steve’s thoughts. And Steve felt almost relieved to hear the annoyance in Tony’s voice – whatever it was that Tony was feeling guilty about, at least it wasn’t serious enough to teach him patience.
So it’s with a strange sinking feeling in the hollow of his stomach that Tony watches Steve wake up enough to come to the same realization that Tony’d had, about the cuddling.
. Instead of installing bookshelves, for instance, Rogers has stacked his enormous collection of books on the floor in the corner. Instead of using his desk for work, Rogers has spread what looks like half of SHIELD’s archives across the dining table. His desk, in turn, is covered in a collection of crumpled receipts, flyers, and junk mail. There’s a stack of canvases near the easel, and battered sketchpads piled next to those, but the walls themselves are bare.
“Why?” Some of his bafflement makes its way into his tone, and Rogers tenses, like maybe he’s realized he revealed more than he meant to.
For one thing, Steve had apparently stopped by the kitchens before heading to Gryffindor Tower, because he pulled out a thermos of hot chocolate with the defensive explanation that “your body gets cold easily. I’ve been drinking gallons of tea at every meal,” and they were soon swapping it comfortably back and forth as they walked.
Steve does the staring thing again – the one that always seems to make people do what he wants – until Damian does indeed let go. And then Steve marches Tony toward the dance floor without another word.
“I have a—” Tony blurted out, over the low murmur of Avengers playing with new toys. “For Steve, it’s just—” He made a gesture that hopefully indicated “in the workshop” rather than “in the depths of hell,” and then booked it out of there as fast as he could. Okay, so that brilliant stalling tactic gave him maybe ten minutes to come up with something brilliant that he could pretend he’d had all along. Tony had worked under worse pressure.
Tony led him to a little-used third-floor corridor, where he stopped in front of a newer tapestry depicting a scene from the Battle of Hogwarts. Steve was interested to notice that the fight represented in the tapestry was taking place in what looked like this exact corridor, except where the tapestry was now hanging, there was a door instead.
In his defense, it's hard to maintain enthusiasm for the interstate highway system from the side of the Ohio Turnpike, with a motorcycle that started hissing angrily at 70 mph and now sits beside him, releasing gentle clouds of smoke into the twilight air.
“Mm, only the best for you, baby,” Tony purrs without missing a beat. Steve laughs, and even as he redirects them back to their initial topic, he can’t fight the stupid grin that wants so badly to stay on his face.
easier to work on the gauntlet this way, even one-handed (one-and-a-half-handed? Three hands out of four? How are hands measured, anyway?). Just like with the rolling chair, which Tony had used to move both himself and Steve wherever he liked, something tension in his body eases at being able to see his hand resting in Steve’s on the desk between them. He can trace the path from Steve’s hand, to his arm, to his shoulder, to his face – a constant reminder that it’s
He counts seventeen more cars before he remembers the cell phone that Tony Stark had forced on him before he’d left New York. He’s still not entirely sure how it works, but he does remember his lesson on finding his “Contacts.” There are only two entries programmed into the phone: Tony and Maria Hill.
“It wasn’t your fault,” he says suddenly, breaking their companionable quiet. He hadn’t even known it was something he’d been thinking about, until it’s already out of his mouth. No way to go but forward. “What happened to Bucky, I mean. I read the hospital records in your SHIELD file. He was trying to kill you. He almost did.”
“I didn’t know— Sam and I ran into him a few times as we were trying to figure out what had happened to Fury, but he always had a mask on. He, uh, blew up my old apartment, you know. In DC. Everything was gone. That’s actually how I ended up at Sam’s in the first place.”
, the spell will replace Polyjuice without its uncomfortable interactions with werewolf physiology. If it works, you should be able to use it on the night of the full moon to transfigure into someone who
“Not just in the biblical sense.” Tony smirks at him, and Steve doesn’t even bother trying to disentangle that innuendo. “You comin’ or what, Mad Max?”
Steve caught a flash of Tony’s horror at having forgotten that Steve himself was American, before Tony instantly covered it up with another teasing grin.
He then proceeds with the most passive-aggressive strip tease he can manage. It basically consists of a lot of pointed t-shirt seam ripping, and Tony’s utter refusal to be a coward about his arc reactor scars.
they got caught – was made better by Tony’s very funny (if rather unflattering) impression of Steve. He explained with exaggerated earnestness that “he was seeing Mr Stark back to Ravenclaw Tower
“When we met in New York the first time, it was like I was watching you all from behind a screen, or like I was still on the other side of that sheet of ice, somehow. Still waiting for something to break through it. I felt like more of an alien than Thor was. I kept hoping to feel a connection, or a sense of teamwork, but we just…none of us clicked. You know what I mean; you were there. And at first, I thought it was just a problem with Fury’s scheme – with the Avengers – so I went to SHIELD, and it felt like more of the same.
, to be clear, but with a certain doomed gusto that Steve couldn’t help but admire. As Steve was agreeing to help cover up their magical accident, he told himself it was because of Stark’s truly,
want—” he tries to insist, even as his eyes slide closed, because that seems crucial for Tony to understand.
“I’m sorry,” Tony finally says, and Steve blinks. Wonders if it would be in bad taste to ask Tony to repeat that. “I should’ve come to you first with the Accords. And Wanda.”
And suddenly, the invocation of his name summoning him like Voldemort or something, the closet door is flung open to reveal Stephen Strange himself, standing in the hallway of this Manhattan hotel.
You don’t become an engineer as skilled as Tony without learning how to tread lightly in the face of complex systems.
“You have such a strange home life,” Bruce sighed, but his mouth was twitching at the corners and his face had lost its haunted look.
Although his own nightmares have subsided a lot in the years since Afghanistan, he still doesn’t love things or people touching him when he sleeps, as a rule. But instead of the panic he would expect to feel upon waking with his skull practically being

So he’d burst into the Great Hall late, a bit windblown from a hasty Drying Charm, and still knotting up his red and gold tie. Everyone had turned to look at him, including the professors at the Head Table, and a sudden burst of self-consciousness had caused Tony to stumble. He
He gives Steve a slow, filthy (utterly false) grin, before towing him off the dance floor and then out of the ballroom entirely.
kind of his MO. On the other hand, Rogers has shown himself to be – at least in this specific instance – more complicated than Tony gave him credit for, and he’s also shown himself able to hide that complexity when he wants to.
Natasha said something sharp in Russian, and when they all turned to Clint, he translated serenely: “She says she loves you all, and she’s so grateful that we’re all here together for Christmas, and if you could please pass her a present…What? It’s not
“And how do you know so much about gullible Americans?” Steve asked, his mouth twitching with the effort not to smile.
“I recognize the spell, of course,” Strange begins, once they’re settled onto chairs and have been provided with some odd-tasting tea that Tony suspects may be a hallucinogen.
“In truth, the house was chosen for its connection to mystical energies, which are not beholden to human concepts like street names and numbers,” Strange continues. “Mr. Stark. Captain Rogers.” He nods at them both. “How can I help you?”
“Oh. Um.” Steve says, totally undoing Tony’s masterful performance of chillness by angling himself away. A faint blush has risen to his cheeks, and his eyes dart to Tony’s chest and away again. The blush deepens.

“Steve,” Tony says into the brief silence, and if the use of his first name didn’t put Steve on alert, that odd hesitance creeping back into Tony’s voice
Rogers, ironically, proves to be very skilled at intricate engineering work. He listens carefully to what Tony asks him to do, and his movements as he carries out those instructions are deft and precise, no hesitation or tremor in his hand, even though, out loud, he’s self-deprecating about his own skills.
“Your lack of faith, it just breaks my heart, Rogers. I’ll be there in twenty minutes.” And he hangs up to Steve’s continued protests. Steve stares at the phone in his hand and tries to steel himself for the call to Hill.
there was an attack. Aliens invaded, blew up my building, it was a whole thing. Maybe you saw it on the news. ‘Battle of New York’ ring any bells?”
, sex was just a way to pass the time;” “two words: zombie fish”). He awards himself a point every time he gets Steve to crack in front of a New York socialite.
“Designing my coffee-maker to look like the machines in the movie was a kind of joke with myself,” Tony admits. “Something like: coffee saves the engineer, so the engineer can save the world. What’s the quote from the movie? ‘Machines and marvels?’”
Steve glanced over at Tony, sprawled out on the floor of the corridor with all the sodden, offended dignity of a Kneazle who’d fallen into a bathtub. He couldn’t help it – he started to laugh. Alarm flashed across Tony’s face, and then he seemed to relax, grinning up at the ceiling as all their belongings clattered around them courtesy of one of Madam Pince’s Banishing Charms.
Steve really should have known her name by now. Ellen’s Hufflepuff girlfriend. He’d been trying to memorize students ever since he became Head Boy, and every time he thought he knew everyone, he’d be caught out by another new face.
“I believe you. But it’s really fine,” Steve says flatly. His smile has gone a little forced. Apparently Tony has tripped over another one of Steve’s
“Grey is still watching you,” Steve murmurs. It takes Tony several dazed moments to process the words, let alone remember that other people exist in the world besides them, let alone find the wherewithal to care about
“Yeah, I actually have some notes on that, after the last mission—” Tony and Bruce both glanced around the TV room apprehensively. Even though neither of them could
Steve hesitates, struggling to find the words, watching as the bridge of Tony’s nose, his hair – the humor always lurking in his eyes – comes to life under Steve’s pencil like someone else is drawing it. Tony stays quiet on the other end of the line.

“Fine! Open mine, then.” He gestured at a large object hulking in the corner behind the tree, which was very clearly a ballet barre shrouded in wrapping paper.
“Yeah, well, the old-fashioned futurism was kind of its appeal, at the time. I was really into old sci-fi when I was younger,” Tony confesses. “I’m not sure exactly what I was looking for. Models for a better world, maybe? But they all felt so hopelessly
He presents his tablet screen to Rogers with a flourish. Rogers scans the list, his eyebrows steadily rising.
“Okay, so I thought, maybe we could figure out a way to give him a real challenge. Like, some kind of god-level obstacle course?”
“Tony,” Steve says in a low voice, and enjoys the way Tony’s eyes go wide at the sound. “Believe me. I really,

The server’s frightened retreat does nothing to mask the pointed silence on the other end of the phone.
“Here’s hoping,” Tony agrees absently. He yawns, blinks, and then suddenly he’s shooting up from the bed, nearly braining himself on Steve’s chin in the process. “Oh crap, I forgot--” Steve sits up as well, alarmed, so he’s moderately prepared to catch the foil-wrapped bundle that comes hurtling towards his head.
“Tony,” Steve murmured, barely audible over what sounded like an argument about the proper care of nifflers. “You shouldn’t have—“

The night before, Tony has asked Rogers to point him in the direction of Gryffindor Tower and give him the password, before Bruce had accompanied Rogers back to Ravenclaw. But this morning, he’d woken up late enough that the other boys in his dormitory had already gone down to breakfast, and somehow, despite living in this sodding castle for

super rich, remember?” he drawls in a passable imitation of Tony at his most arrogant. “You gonna help me, or do I have to call Natasha?”
Christmas morning dawned crisp and cold, with slivers of pale winter sunlight filtering through the gaps in Tony’s scarlet bed curtains.
Now, hours later, Tony was flipping through a tome larger than his head as he scratched idly at the back of his neck with his wand. Without looking up from his own reading, Steve gently reached over to lower it before Tony could set his own hair on fire. This had already happened once before, although Tony had paid it as little notice then as he did now. He also had a tendency to conjure glittery bubbles from the tip of his wand when he was thinking particularly hard. Steve had been surreptitiously popping them all afternoon before Pince could spot them floating above the wall of books.
“…Anyway, like I said, I’ve still got a friend on the inside,” Rogers says, ignoring Tony’s question with a brittle smile.
“Buy you a Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks?” he suggested, and hoped he didn’t sound as desperate as he felt for Tony to agree.
“After Afghanistan,” Tony starts quietly, and finds that it’s somehow easier to say the word now, in the velvet hush of Steve’s bedroom. Steve doesn’t jump at the sound of his voice – he just turns his head slowly, pale eyes gleaming in the dark to let Tony know that he’s listening, even as the details of his expression are lost in shadow.
car trip through New York City traffic to figure that out, so he knows his reasoning is sound. But Rogers has never let Tony’s
Two hours, twenty trips around the block because “we need a few more minutes, Hap,” and one extremely effective sit-in protest later, Tony finds himself standing in yet another brownstone, this time in Brooklyn.
“So, short-term, what should we do?” Bruce asked. “While we wait for this to wear off. Unless Tony decides to just
But it’s also true that what he and Rogers are planning to do with this bed – namely, sleep – is something with which Tony does
“Okay,” Tony announces. He experiences a brief pang of annoyance that he can’t clap his hands together the way that he wants to, but hopefully soon he won’t have to worry about that anymore. “Doctor Strange was charmingly nonspecific about what might actually break the spell, but he did say it was used for teambuilding. And, incidentally? Is there actually a market for magical corporate retreat facilitators? Should SI be planning a spell for HR’s next team picnic? Has Apple been doing this the whole time?”
Tony is gazing blearily at Steve’s chest – he’s gotten like three hours of sleep, okay? Give him a break – when Steve suddenly leans forward to study the coffee maker, eyes narrowing at an inscription on its side.
surprising than if he’d learned that Stark had spent the whole night up in Ravenclaw Tower where he was ostensibly supposed to be.
exceed the professor’s expectations, but not rise too far above them. It took a constant and exhausting amount of focus, but Tony was determined to manage it for the sake of Steve’s marks.
. I think I…” his voice goes so low, almost a whisper, that Tony strains to hear it over the sound of the shower. “I think I lost my
Bruce glared at the door-poinsettia he’d just toppled over, and Tony waited a few beats to see if a Code Green was imminent, but Bruce just scowled and tried to nudge the poinsettia closer to the wall.
“Nah. Sleep or coffee, remember? I don’t remember ‘brooding silently in the dark’ being on that list, do you?”
over the whole table before a jet of water shot from Tony’s wand, bounced off the charm, and hit Tony straight in the face.
” He spoke with an odd cadence, as though he’d learnt English from books rather than by ear. Tony tried to remember if he’d ever spoken to Odinson for long enough to have noticed it before.
“Somehow I think I’ll manage,” Tony drawls, anxiety now transformed into amusement. He would’ve assumed Steve had been living in the 21st century for long enough (not to mention World War II) that he wouldn’t still get so flustered by a bit of skin, but Tony’s delighted to be wrong.
“I just!” Steve interrupted loudly, and then didn’t seem to know how to finish that sentence, because he took a large gulp of tea instead.
They didn’t need to say a word now. Together, like partners in a familiar dance, they both pulled out their wands and began circling the clearing, casting a standard safety ward that would contain any magical accidents from spreading past the clearing. It shimmered in the shape of a blue net crisscrossing the space before fading from their view.
“I could barely sleep an hour at a time,” Tony continues. “Part of it was anxiety – and you’ve already seen that particular symptom in action – but when I first got back, I couldn’t sleep with a blanket, or even clothes sometimes, because in my dreams they’d turn into hands. Holding me down. But the worst nightmares were the ones that featured someone I cared about. Someone who died.”
“Do you think you’re the first students to accidentally switch bodies?” McGonagall was in the middle of demanding. Tony frowned.
Steve had continued to believe that he could brazen it all out and have Bucky exonerated before anything happened between him and Tony that was truly unforgivable. And he knows, too late, he’d been as naïve as Tony’d once accused him of being. Steve had assumed that Tony’s acceptance of the Accords and wariness about Bucky had been his need for control manifesting itself once again, just another one of those moments where Tony overdoes things. Steve had missed the real emotional sleight of hand at work. Tony had been scared. And in his own Tonyish way, he’d been trying his best to let Steve see it.
Tonight, Tony sat in a squashy scarlet armchair by the fire, reading one of the Metamorphmagus theory books he’d made Bruce check out of the library for him (Tony and Steve were both still too afraid to face Madam Pince’s wrath themselves). He’d been worried at first that Steve’s friends would notice the book and ask questions, but so far, the only people who’d spoken to him had been a steady stream of younger students asking for homework help, to the point where Tony wondered if it was another Head Boy duty that Steve had forgotten to warn him about. All the other Seventh Year Gryffindors seemed happily grouped around the common room, but nobody was catching his eye to invite him to join them. Tony told himself that he should be thankful, since it was much easier to pretend to be Steve if Steve didn’t have any close friends who would pick up on his strange behavior. But mainly, Tony just felt unsettled, and rather indignant on Steve’s behalf.
It’s to Tony’s credit that he only freezes for an instant, shocked by Steve’s lips pressing lightly and undemanding against his, before he manages to catch up to what’s happening and kiss Steve back. Steve’s breath catches when he feels Tony kiss him back – like maybe he hadn’t
, not a—“ Tony tries to throw up his hands in frustration, but Rogers doesn’t move along with him, so instead it just comes out as a stifled shake of his fist. Trust Rogers not to appreciate the communicative panache of well-executed hand gesture. He’d probably keep his hands clasped behind his back at all times, if given the choice. No emoting allowed.
And so it went, until there were no gifts left under the tree, and Tony was practically vibrating with tension. He was so busy worrying about how disappointed Steve would be – or
They slide into the back of the limo, and a tightness Steve hadn’t even noticed around Tony’s eyes relaxes in the near-solitude. He’s lost his heart-stopping smile and traded it for a subtler, crooked quirk of his lips that has the opposite effect on Steve’s heart: sending it shuddering in rapid, uneven patterns against his breastbone. Tony leans his head back against the seat rest with a sigh, and Steve almost forgets about the scene in the restaurant, distracted as he is by the line of Tony’s throat against the car’s dark leather.
“D’you think there are still Acromantulas in here?” Bruce asked, peering around nervously at the surrounding trees.
Tony had been resting his chin in his hands, but at that pronouncement, he twisted just enough to regard Steve with one suspicious blue eye.
“Well aren’t you just the consummate host,” Tony says, mostly to see how Rogers will react. His hypothesis is confirmed: Rogers’ hand relaxes minutely, and he gives Tony the same charming smile that graces the USO posters lining Howard’s old study.
“You teachin’ Pepper bad habits?” Steve’s voice drawls sleepily from somewhere above Tony’s head. Steve apparently becomes about 50% more “Brooklyn” in the mornings, which is a truly adorable detail that Tony will need to purge ruthlessly from his brain once this whole thing is over and they have to go back to their real, separate lives.
“I had 70 years of pop culture to catch up on, I had no friends, and that movie is on cable a lot. So yes, Tony, I have seen
, only for the other Avengers to react with expressions that ranged from “annoyed” to “pitying,” and really, no part of that spectrum was ideal.
Steve still doesn’t remember the first time they kissed, but he can’t imagine it was better than this: the quiet, shocked noise Tony makes when Steve presses their lips together, and the way Steve can feel, even through the suit, the moment Tony’s whole body melts into the kiss. Tony’s hands come up to rest lightly against Steve’s waist and at the curve of his neck, and his mouth parts on a sigh. Steve deepens the kiss, and it must be enough to rouse Tony from his dazed stupor, because his hands tighten and he does something with his tongue that shouldn’t be
That’s how Clint found him several hours later: mostly dry but still a bit foamy, explaining to JARVIS very seriously why “motorcycle” should go in the “20
The upshot being that in trying to protect Bruce by forcing him to cast the spell first, Tony had practically ensured Bruce would be expelled. And possibly arrested. Once Rogers told McGonagall who’d cast an experimental, unregistered spell on him, it would all be over. And even though there was probably

Steve was shocked to find that lessons were, in many ways, the easy part. The professors didn’t bother calling on him. They also seemed utterly unfazed that he’d forgotten Stark’s schedule and appeared twenty minutes into a class period. On the rare occasions when he

They sit at the kitchen table for several more hours, drinking old-fashioned, futuristic coffee until the sun rises.
Strange had waved off his concern, and continued desperately: “So then, what happened after the Chitauri were defeated?”
– oh my God.” Tony is possibly having some sort of asthma attack on the other end of the line. Steve grits his teeth and suffers through a few moments of Tony’s delighted wheezing before he cracks.
Steve Rogers touches you. This suggests that I am right about my counterpart’s motivations, and that he specifically wants the
“I’m not sure we really have a choice.” Tony raises their clasped hands significantly. “Unless you’re
“Exactly,” Tony retorts. “At 4am, you have exactly two choices: sleep or coffee. Trust me, this is a hypothesis I’ve tested extensively.”
What Tony doesn’t say – but assumes they already know – is that the information that he and Rogers are both down a hand would be like catnip to evildoers.
“It’s fine!” Rogers says, looking horrified, like he’s worried that Tony’s gonna pull out a pair of scissors from some hidden pocket and just start cutting. “Like I said, I’ve slept in the uniform plenty of times.”
“’Approximate’ doesn’t matter much if people are panicking,” Pepper explains, almost gently, like Rogers needs to be guided through the concept of “social media,” or possibly “lying.” Rogers stares at her in polite confusion, and as much as Tony would love to sit back and let this game play out, he doesn’t want Pepper any more irritated than she already is.
Tony stares at his tablet. The math swims before his eyes. A language that he’s spoken intuitively almost since birth has suddenly become incomprehensible. It’s a simple correction – he
for help over the last several years. And maybe he wouldn’t have noticed a pattern: each one of them had involved some sort of threat of explosion or serious bodily harm.
Damian visibly grits his teeth before changing tactics. “Tony, I actually wanted to follow up on the proposal I submitted to SI last month. It’s terribly technical; I wouldn’t want to bore your friend.”
Steve wakes up the next morning with the kind of headache he hasn’t felt in seventy years, and an odd sense of something out-of-balance, like he’s only wearing one sock and his body is still waiting for his mind to notice it.
, it only serves to worry Rogers, who crosses the room in a few quick strides to reach for Tony’s hand.

“That’s it, I’m leaving.” Strange only makes it a few steps before he’s whirling back around. “And for the record, assholes? I can sense the full parameters of the spell now that its been fulfilled, and it was only ever set to release after a certain time. No other conditions. It seems like the only thing my alternate universe counterpart wanted was to force you both to spend time with one another. I take no responsibility for
“Professor, are we in trouble?” Bruce asked, clutching a Cauldron Cake as though ready to launch it and make a quick getaway. McGonagall paused, her sharp gaze sweeping over them, and Steve didn’t think any of them were fully immune to its power. He found himself holding his breath, even as he also found himself uncaring about the specifics of whatever punishment she would assign. He looked around at the six of them, newly united by pilfered chocolate and by guilt, and decided that whatever McGonagall did to them now, it had been worth it.

His statement is both the obvious truth, and also, in a sense, a lie. Tony is indeed very good at sex. It’s not a boast if it’s true. Even more than the mechanics of it, Tony’s good at performing the dances that happen

to panic very often, because there are few problems that couldn’t be solved with either money or processing power, and Tony had plenty of both.
“That’s ridiculous,” Tony snapped, and Steve wilted. Every other option was significantly more horrible than this one. “None of this was
“Hold on,” Rogers interjects. “Why are you assuming we’ll go back to Stark Tower? I have an apartment in New York, too. I even live there most of the year. And all of its walls are still intact.”
Tony brushed a stubborn lock of blond hair out of his eyes – one that had always irritated Steve as well - and frowned down at the passage he’d been skimming.
So they eat cheesesteaks one-handed amidst their rumpled sheets. Steve licks his fingers and pretends to listen to Tony’s rambling story about a Senator, a missing zoo penguin, and a misunderstanding with the DC Park Police, and thinks that love could be a lot worse.
“Thanks for the tip,” he said instead, and then another thought emerged from his sleep-deprived fog: “Hey—how’d you know it was Clint and Bruce that I still needed gifts for?”
of whipped cream--” Tony cuts himself off as abruptly as he started talking, and somehow manages to glance at Steve sidelong while being only an inch away from his nose. He opens his mouth, hesitates, and then says: “I mean. Unless you were committed to the full fugitive-from-justice experience?”
“I do if it’s stupid,” Tony retorts, which admittedly is not his most brilliant comeback, but he’s already feeling a familiar shortness of breath even
He waits for Rogers to get into another snit about Tony disrupting his space, but instead, Rogers just nods curiously at the supplies Tony’s managed to collect: “How are you going to do that one-handed?”
“Okay, so there was this wizard from another dimension, and in conclusion, me’n’Rogers are cursed to hold hands until we break a magic spell.”
Thor and Tony both cheered loudly, and turned to each other with reckless grins. Tony opened his mouth to suggest some other decorations they could creatively destroy, which of course was the exact moment that the entire Tower plunged into darkness.
“The hotel pay-per-view is never a good deal, don’t buy anything out of a stranger’s car, and always wear a condom,” Tony says promptly.
. Rogers is definitely weird about his apartment, and hiding it. He’d grabbed on to that excuse too quickly for it to be the whole story. And five minutes ago, he’d been just as desperate as Tony for the spell to be broken. Tony had perfected the art of misdirection by the age of 18. Does Rogers really think he can fool him?
“I get the rest, I really do--” Tony’s voice sounds strange, vowels clipped like he’s trying to barrel through the words as efficiently as possible.
His pencil digs a little too deep into the outline of Iron Man’s flipped up faceplate, and Steve forces his hand to relax as he retorts: “What, you decided not to go with Sonny and Cher? Mulder and Scully? Don’t hold back on my account, Stark, I can take it.”
“Yes! The conclusion might be rubbish, but there’s some footnotes in Chapter Three that propose an underlying link between Animagi and Metamorphmagi, which…” Stark trailed off, already flipping through the book. Steve grinned and leaned back in his chair.
“It was the kids who missed you most. They’ve been completely out of control without you around to lay down the law.”
So the painfully attractive man that Tony is forced to sleep with for the foreseeable future – and who is also
“So,” Tony says brightly, the instant Rogers hangs up his phone. “Do you call me in for the dangerous missions rather than Wilson because you think I’ll care less if you die, or…“
But that’s fine, that’s no problem, it just means that this Christmas, Tony needs to find Steve the perfect present to make up for the Birthday Debacle. And, possibly, stay in his presence long enough to bestow it.
“If we don’t start opening presents soon, Bruce is gonna combust, and then we’re gonna have a whole other problem on our hands,” Clint drawled from the depths of his armchair.
“It’s your Christmas present,” Tony finally confessed miserably. “Or rather, it was supposed to be. I wanted to get you something you’d actually,
Happy had managed to find a parking spot around the corner where he could wait for them to finish their totally useless conversation with Strange, so they only have to wait a few moments before he pulls up in the car.
“Don’t be cute. No, this is about Steve’s Christmas present. The two of us are gonna figure it out once and for all.”
“When they died, it’s not that I ever wanted those big Christmases back. Some “don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone” kinda thing? No, that wasn’t it. But even as I got better at bullshitting my way through those
“Are you waiting for people to catch on?” Romanoff continued, sounding, at best, only vaguely curious about the highly shocking and highly illegal magical fraud that they’d been perpetrating for weeks. “Because I don’t think they will.”
Steve wonders whether the theatrical sex noises are a bit too obvious, but Tony just mumbles “Jesus Christ” and proceeds to have a whispered but intense argument with FRIDAY. Steve can only hear about one out of every four words of it, but he’s fully capable of inferring the rest.
“Not exactly.” Tony started to explain the whole humiliating failure over again, and stopped abruptly when he actually registered the look on Steve’s face. He looked
Hogsmeade was already decorated for the holiday. The entire High Street was covered in garlands and colored lights that stood out brilliantly against the snow still covering the ground. Some of them looked almost identical to Muggle fairy lights, although some of them…Steve did a double-take. A glittering illusion of a dragon wearing reindeer antlers was slithering sinuously across the roof of Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop. Well, that was one interpretation of the legend, Steve supposed.
useless Steve would surely be at the magical theory. And Stark had given in, finally, with a groan that Steve had serenely pretended not to hear.
Steve does a quick time zone calculation in his head. He sincerely hopes Tony isn’t drunk right now.
The other part of the Home for Christmas Protocol – the actual gifting – proved to be somewhat harder. Tony found himself constantly ruminating on what to get Steve for Christmas. When he was in a meeting about the new StarkPhone upgrades, when he was arguing on the phone with Pepper about the new StarkPhone upgrades, when he stopped by the R&D labs to monitor progress on the new StarkPhone upgrades, when he was redesigning the new StarkPhone upgrades – in short, at every moment of his life – at least half of Tony’s brain was stuck on the problem of Steve’s gift.
Rogers sways a little closer to Tony’s body to get a better look at the housing unit, and Tony thinks “
Rogers doesn’t bother to ask how Tony knows so many SHIELD secrets. He shoots Tony a sidelong, considering look before he sighs and shakes his head. The grip of his hand – which Tony has almost managed to forget – lightens up, even if he still can’t let go entirely. And while Tony usually considers Rogers’ impeccable posture to be one of his more annoying qualities, there’s a slump to his body now that Tony has never seen before, but nevertheless looks habitual. Like Rogers’ squared shoulders are a coat he’s just taken off.
Tony hits the balcony outside their bedroom with a thump and a stumble, and Steve can’t help but feel smug at the tell. He can’t remember the last time Tony botched a landing quite that badly. Before the armor has even finished folding off his body, Tony is making for Steve on the bed, a dangerous gleam in his dark eyes that has Steve shivering in anticipation.

Natasha turned to face him, presumably so she could make sure he saw her smug expression, even as she continued to back out of the kitchen. “Oh, I definitely know.”
Tony looks closer at his screen, and now he can see that small wisps of strawberry blond hair are escaping Pepper’s ponytail. As Tony knows from long years of experience, this is the first and most subtle of Pepper’s warning signs that something has gone seriously wrong.
“Made a lot of progress on the spell so far, have you?” Pepper asks, voice dry as the desert. “Feeling utterly, 100% certain that it’ll be solved by Friday?”
, had an entire wall of windows. So instead, he crammed a Christmas tree into one corner of the TV room, which had zero windows and only two doors. Tony, always the futurist, was not content to leave this problem half-solved.
At first, Tony couldn’t believe that he’d managed to sneak up on two of the most situationally aware people he knows. He’ll go to his grave swearing that that’s the

Just like the night before, Tony wakes up suddenly, with only a hazy sense of the noise or motion that had disturbed him. This time, when he glances over at the other side of the bed, it’s to find Steve still asleep. And yet, somehow, Tony is certain that it had been Steve who’d woken him. He watches quietly for a few more moments, and then –
“Please tell me we’re gonna talk about this.” His tone may be casual, but the look he slants over at Steve contains nothing less than unadulterated glee. Steve closes his eyes and groans.
“You know,” Tony realizes, hours later when they’re both getting ready for bed again. “Now that we have the nanoparticles up and running, it wouldn’t be that hard to program a few of them to stitch up the seam of your suit, if you wanted to rip the arm so that you could finally take it off.”
