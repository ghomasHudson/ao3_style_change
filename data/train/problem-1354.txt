But as a second and third finger were not just requested but demanded, John began to relax. Sherlock was obviously enjoying himself if his leaking cock was anything to go by. Worried Sherlock might come, he stilled his left hand, though he kept a tight grip on Sherlock's cock as he added a fourth and final finger.
The doorbell rings and Molly heads over to it as quickly as she can. Laverne chirps happily as she is scooped up into Molly’s arms and the front door is opened wide.
John went about ignoring Sherlock's groans and complaints. Not only should neither of them be caught drunk right now, should Mary get through their defences. But he wasn't going to have Sherlock, who was recently out of the hospital drunk and high off pain medication. John might be willing to put a bullet through somebody's head, but he was still a doctor, for crying out loud.
“Sherlock,” John growls again. The edge of warning there, but Sherlock savors dancing on the edge too much to not draw this out a tiny bit more. He flicks his tongue in a series of angles and loops that have John twitching like mad. “Want you.
“Stop.” She interrupted, raising her hand to halt his sentence. “Firstly, there’s no right or wrong here. This isn’t a test, there isn’t a correct answer. People change, it’s possible that you have. And that’s okay. But first, let’s work this through logically. What exactly do you feel when in Dr Watson’s company?”
“I’m aware of his ability to get into the heads of others. It just pisses me off when it’s done so flagrantly in my direction.”
“It didn’t sound like you thought it was a mistake. In fact, if I remember rightly, it was you who initiated it.”
The detective’s quiet gaze seems to be absorbing any small amount of data to sort out John’s weaknesses. The barely controlled intermittent tremor in his left hand. The licking of his lips. The flare of his nostrils.
Sherlock shifts the belt around to show a small rounded ball near the middle and almost laughs out loud again at how John’s face becomes a brilliant shade of scarlet.
Sherlock clears his throat, and John looks away from the crowd and back into his new fiance's face. John's mouth opens up to ask what Sherlock wants when the soft pat of a hand lands on the pocket of his trousers.
John nods so quickly Harry can’t help but laugh. It’s almost odd that John can meld so easily with Harry after all this time, as if the last years of turmoil have been simply wiped away. A part of John wants to pretend that the Harry he was angry at for so long was an alcoholic doppelgänger, and his actual sister has finally managed to escape from wherever she had been held captive. Maybe, in a small way, that’s exactly what happened.
“Hey, I’ve not seen you here before.” A voice sidled up next to him, and Sherlock glanced at it out of the corner of his eye. The young man was wearing a tight red shirt, skinny jeans and an expression that he absolutely wanted to be ripped out of both pieces of clothing. Sherlock sipped out of his glass before turning to face the man.
John gives a small wave as Sherlock continues to pull him along the way. The streets in front of them are becoming more full with a variety of parade-goers as they chat happily and sing along to the gay pride classics blaring on the temporarily placed speakers.
He was prattling out nonsense and he had no idea how to stop himself. Did the articles give any advice as to how to pull your foot out of your mouth?
"Fine," John nodded once, a crisp motion that made his teeth click together. It wasn't the first time he'd worked with someone he loathed. He'd do it for Sherlock, and he'd be professional about it. No more jabs at Sebastian. In fact, if he could help it, he wouldn't even look at the man. "I warned you yesterday, Sherlock… sex addict. I'm not like that anymore, but it doesn't change the past."
Sherlock closes his laptop with a snap before crossing his arms. At least he now looks like the petulant child he’s acting like.
He tried to sit back, but the coffee table behind him rammed into his back. So with a great grunt of effort, he got himself on the sofa and wasted no time in reaching for himself. He'd been so close, just from watching Sherlock take pleasure, that his orgasm had been a near thing. But he'd held off, wanting to be alert and soak in every moment of Sherlock in ecstasy.
In retaliation, John’s tiny fangs nip at Sherlock’s fingers, but there is no stopping the cuddling fest. The chirps from John grow louder and with much more indignation, but Sherlock is lost in baby-soft fur and velvety wings. Sharp cheekbones nuzzle in and John flattens his ears in defeat at being too
“I didn’t think you’d mind, you’ve said yourself that you don’t like getting up too early in the morning for case-related things.“
"As for Anderson, he's a dick. If you can't control your urges, you don't enter into a relationship. Easy as that. I haven't been with anyone since I came back to London. Aside from this one girl six months ago. But that was a one time thing, and controlling myself hasn't been a problem. I have two hands and access to unlimited amounts of porn. I can wank if I need it."
Roughly three weeks after their brief talk about Mycroft, John decides to take as many extra hours as he can at the surgery. 221b Baker Street is suffocating him in more ways than he thought possible, and if he’s escaping, he might as well make some money while he’s at it.
"What is it about you?" He sank to his knees and placed a hand on Sherlock's cheekbone, and shook his head, "I'm like a bloody moth to the flame. Can't look away, can't walk away… Just the thought of being in the next room without you makes something inside my chest hurt."
“Careful!” John cries, and squeezes tight around Sherlock. At once, both of them lock eyes and stare. The shouts of the driver are muffled as all Sherlock can hear is the sound of his rushing heartbeat and something that sounds vaguely like the ghost of the song John sang at the first bar.
“Sort of.” He said, shoving his hands in his pockets and smirking at John’s confused expression. “What do you think of it?”
He spends the rest of the day alone, checking his phone every five minutes, hoping for a reply. He sends three more texts, each more desperate than the last. At around three o’clock, he heads out to the supermarket, hoping that the flat won’t be empty when he returns. He’s disappointed. John struggles up the stairs with the shopping bags, and his stomach sinks to find that no one has been in the flat since he left.
Soft classical music fills his ears as he lifts himself into a sitting position and looks around. The dock and Briggs are gone, and in their place is a sprawling hotel lobby. The building is modern and expensive by the look of the dark blue carpeting and large chandeliers, and the light hits the glass in just the right ways to remind Sherlock vividly of a sunrise dancing on the surface of water. He turns just enough for the chestnut coloured leather sofa to shift with his weight, and he places his feet on the floor.
“I just thought that I had a better handle on my gender dysphoria,” Molly sighs, followed by taking a long sip of the champagne. It tastes divinely decadent, and Molly adds at least another £10 to the total of their meal. “I was doing so well, but it took one person and now I feel like I’m tumbling back nearly to where I started.”
They’ve been refraining for months, using stunted communication and guarding their secrets close, but now they’ve started, there’s no stopping. Words pour from their mouths like water, the dam of insecurity finally broken. Every thought, every word that should have been said long before is being said now.
“It’s…” he began, then pressed the answer button and placed the phone to his ear. “Lestrade? I thought you and Molly were — “
John smiled at the phrase. A whisper of the past made fresh again. The violin once more held in only John's grip by its fragile neck. Mycroft felt one uncomfortable bead of sweat begin to form near the right side of his brow.
"I imagined you like this moments after seeing you in the lab," Sherlock admitted. "You in the shadows, staring at me as I worked…" Sherlock moved further down the bed, opened up John's legs, and made his way between them. His own cock rubbed up against John's warm entrance. "In the restaurant," Sherlock went on, popping the top of the lubricant and rubbing a liberal amount on his hand. "Your power over everyone you meet is the best aphrodisiac I've ever experienced."
Sherlock sends the text to Lestrade right before he feels the burst of pain. A deep soreness in his stomach and back, and then the sudden rush of icy coldness. He’s vaguely aware that he can’t breathe, something is pushing on his chest, crushing his lungs, but before he has time to truly panic, everything turns black.
“Can you not hear that?” Sherlock hisses, his eyes scanning anywhere for the source of the noise. Irene leans over to rest her elbow on the frigid morgue table as she watches Sherlock mentally break apart into bite-size pieces. As if he is some kind of rare creature that she’s only seen in picture books.
Sherlock swept through the hallways of Barts feeling very wrongfooted. He wondered how he did any of The Work away from John, and would redouble his efforts to get the spreadsheet fully implemented by tomorrow morning at the latest.
Immediately Sherlock felt John's cock give a violent twitch from inside him, and another gush of climax invaded him. Sherlock groaned as he thrust up in short little bursts, finger still in John's arse, and that was it. Sherlock was
Thunder sounds from somewhere above, and both Irene and Sherlock glance upwards. With a quiet hum, Irene rolls her eyes and finishes off her drink in a few quick swallows, then places the empty glass on a mirror image of the coffee table in 221b. The hourglass she’d been holding earlier stands proudly in the middle, the sand steadily pouring between the chambers. Sherlock dreads to find out what will happen when the sand runs out.
“You are beautiful,” John goes on, his hands now pushing the edges of the wispy dark curls near Sherlock’s v-line. “To think I have the gift to see you like this. Underneath my fingertips to do whatever I want to see your stunning face in pleasure.”
He pocketed his mobile as the man on the corner gave him yet another once over. If anything, Sherlock should be the one concerned. It had been a few years since he had been in this exact situation, and back then he’d already been high as a kite during the transaction.
Sherlock couldn’t read John’s face from that angle, but John’s hands were relaxed by his sides and his shoulders were rested in their normal position, so he couldn’t be angry.
“More like three centuries,” John softly corrects, and his hand has returned to the middle of Sherlock’s back and
John hadn’t realised how much of his life was intertwined with the detective, and, for the first time, he wonders if that was part of the problem. He was with Sherlock twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. They worked together, lived together, slept together and everything in between. The most time John ever had to himself was the occasional drink with Greg, or the rare occasions Sherlock passed out before him.
It took John a lot longer than he'd ever admit to doing more than simply exist within, or, more accurately- around, Sherlock. For nearly a full minute, it was all he could do to breathe in more than shallow gasps. But then, Sherlock's cock rubbed against his prostate, and all hell broke loose. His eyes opened so wide they nearly hurt, and he was more than a little surprised that his shout hadn't startled Sherlock. His cry had been loud enough that he wondered if the neighbours would call 999.
“I mean...that would be nice. There’s a lovely little shop that just opened up at the corner. I think that it’s called The Coffee Bean or...maybe The Coffee Bag?”
“...I even thought that maybe I might just want to sleep with you and no other man, because well, you’re brilliant and gorgeous and hilarious…”
Christ. Looking back, he sees it now. All the times he’d let his insecurities eat into their relationship; all the moments he’d pushed Sherlock into a box, expecting him to know what John wanted without asking. Sherlock wasn’t innocent, he still had his fair share of failings, but perhaps this wasn’t as one-sided as John had thought. Maybe...maybe Harry was right.
in there. Thousands of thoughts and ideas are occurring all at once, and the noise is so loud that it deafens out everything else. I can’t concentrate on anything; I can’t delete any of it and it’s clouding my judgement.”
“I dunno. Like it’s you, but with something else there. Warmer and stronger. Like one of my jumpers. It’s nice, it fits you.”
He keeps his tone as conversational as he can, but John’s wary expression lets Sherlock know that he isn’t fooling anyone.
Davy, and today it’s Kraig with a K. And that’s just this week.” John stands with his mouth hanging comically open. “Really, I wish you all the best with your sexual discovery, but does it have to happen every night above my bed? If I wanted to hear you ejaculate I would—” I snap my mouth shut. Too far.
The relationship hadn’t been bad, but nor had it been the best. Conducted in secret so that John could maintain his tough rugby persona, he and Chet had met in secret. At first, that had helped fuel the spark. It made every hand job, every blowjob or clumsy attempt at more special. But soon, the strain began to wear on both of them, and John broke it off knowing that Chet deserved better. He deserved someone who could be open and honest with him. A partner who would hold his hand while walking down the hall.
was going to retire. Do you still have a key to Anderson's flat? I'm going to need a place to dump all my weapons. His is a good enough place as any."
The next chapter is in the tin. Comments and kudos are loved and at some point I will get to answering them! Hugs and honeybees to you all!
Sherlock paused. Unknowingly, John was offering him an out. He could lie, pretend he was doing some experiment or researching for a case, and John wouldn’t bat an eyelid. Sherlock wouldn’t have to make the first step, wouldn’t have to divulge what he was feeling. But no, he couldn’t go back now. He was sure of this. No matter the outcome, he had to tell John how he felt. They had to figure the next stage out together. And if John rejected him -- well, he’d do anything he could to keep him at Baker Street, even if that meant shutting down his newly realised romantic attractions.
“Kiss me,” Sherlock moaned. “If I forget, you know it always comes back...need your lips and your cock.
Of course John knows. Sherlock gives a little sigh of relief — he’s always hated having to come out to people. It feels so foreign to him; the words always become jumbled in his mouth and his flusteredness bleeds into every word. He’s not ashamed, this part of him is the same as any other, just another fraction of the things that make him

"Forensic scientist?" John hummed aloud, then went on to search for the other officer who'd passed away two weeks ago.
Carefully, so as not to topple them both over, John placed his left foot on the floor, then his right. Without releasing his grip, though he did lessen its intensity, of Sherlock's shoulder's he got them both back on the bed and pulled Sherlock's head tightly to his chest.
“Are you okay?” Sherlock pressed, his eyes darting over the bed, almost expecting to see hidden medical equipment. There was nothing.
“Asexual.” He replied, eyes narrowed in her direction. “Your games were never going to work on me, Irene.”
Irene looks simply stunning, as she always does. Today in a low cut green dress with sexy fishnets, her hair falls in a cascade of midnight ringlets and in her petite hands is an old fashioned picnic basket.
"Nothing more," John repeats, and turns onto his side. The darkness is oppressive around him, but he closes his eyes and tries to will away the image of how Sherlock's lips look in the moonlight, on those rare occasions that Sherlock falls asleep before him. They can do this, he promises himself. They can survive.
Molly went scarlet in the face and placed the mug back at her desk. “Yes, you’re right,” she squeaked and moved over to the table across from Sherlock. “You’re usually right about these things though, so...it makes sense.”
Greg placed a hand on the door and pressed it all the way open. His dark brown eyes shifting into the detective mode to gather information about what was out of place since the last time he had been in the flat. It looked very much the same from a week and a half ago. The front room almost unnaturally tidy with only small touches here and there that told anyone entering that someone still lived here. John’s sensible work shoes nestled in next to what had long become his chair. His coat folded up neatly on the couch that so long ago a lanky consulting detective would steeple his fingers under his chin, close his ever calculating eyes, and decipher crime scenes one grain of sand and speck of blood at a time.
He’d treated omegas illegally in the past, but it had always been with the consent of someone close to them, whether that had been next of kin or even with the permission of their alphas. Once again, he was reminded that this situation was very different. Everything about this situation set him on edge. He could face life in prison for what he was doing, but he knew that he couldn’t have left Sherlock alone on the street.
"You're asking if I loved Mary?" John looked to Sherlock for clarification then gave a snort of disgust. "Absolutely not. She was good in bed and liberal with her wine. But there was nothing between us. I told her from the start that I didn't do relationships, that if sex happened more than once between us, it would simply be out of convenience. I had sex with other women during those three months we were working together. She never seemed bothered by it until the end. It was as if something snapped in her brain. One day she was laughing with me. The next, she was possessive and snapping at me if I did so much as look at a female patient. Complete night and day reaction, no one on the ward could figure out what caused the change."
This isn’t how breakups have happened to John, ever. Usually, there are a lot more raised voices and crying. Is this part of what being with a male partner is about, or is this only Sherlock? He wouldn’t know.
“Shh,” John silenced him with a kiss, slower than before, but charged with the same greedy hunger. Sherlock let his hands fall to John’s thighs, running his thumbs up the inside, towards his crotch. John shuddered at the contact, his muscles tensing beneath Sherlock’s fingertips. John wanted this. John wanted this and
“He... he thinks it would be best for us not to date anymore,” John blurts out, his tone rather more defeated than he had wanted.
"Put the gun down and sit down before you tear more stitches out." His voice was deadly serious, bordering on anger. Already he could see a dark patch of blood seeping through the left leg of his trousers. "Don't make me sedate you again because I can, and I will."
Sherlock passed the driver some twenties, before joining John on the pavement. Whatever it was, he needed to learn fast.
“Well, fancy seeing you on my doorstep...of all people,” she said as her eyes swept Sherlock up and down before stepping aside to allow him into her flat. The gentle scent of freshly cut roses and spiced tea surrounded Sherlock as he entered.
, the test results to their STI screenings had come in just as Sherlock was signing his discharge papers. From that moment, all John could think about was getting his mouth around Sherlock's perfect cock, and feeling his orgasm against his tongue.
A flicker of something like bright fire in the irises of John's eyes, and then back to the more familiar expression of disdain returned.
“That might be a case...what the bloody hell are you typing? God, nothing to do with fungus collection, right?”
“Yes you are!” Sherlock exclaims when he can breathe again, laughter pouring from his mouth and tears dripping from his eyes.
The sounds of pots and pans clinking together drifted through the open doorway, shortly followed by John’s out-of-tune singing. Sherlock smiled into the pillow, his stomach flipping with an unrecognisable emotion. No-one had ever done this before. No-one had stayed past morning light, let alone made him breakfast. He felt out of his depth, unsure as to where the boundaries lay. He had perfected sex—practised and memorised each flick of the wrist, every thrust of his hips that would elicit a specific reaction. He knew exactly where his abilities lay, exactly how to get what he wanted from each encounter, but this—this he had no clue. Was he expected to reciprocate? To make breakfast the next time, or carry out some romantic gesture? He wasn’t sure if he was capable. Yet, part of him wanted to try. That was new too. The caring. He hadn't felt that in a long time.
"I," John attempted to say between his giggles, "Christ, we just met... Do you sleep with all your Twitter followers?"
“No, Greg. I won’t, because I’m sick of this. Sherlock, just tell me whatever you’re thinking, I can deal with it. I’m not some child that needs coddling. I fucked up, and that’s fine. Just tell me that. This, this is too weird.”
Fuck. John had shoved him away for being himself. He’d been so worried about himself, so wrapped up in Mycroft’s accusations that he’d been waiting for something to happen. And when it did, the moment Sherlock deviated from the social norm, he’d allowed his insecurities to explode.
Sherlock pushed forward again, his hands frantically roaming the doctor’s body, hungrily working his mouth open. John’s head hit the wall, but he didn’t pull away; instead, he wrapped his hands around the detective’s waist and pulled him even closer. Heat swelled up into the kiss; a steady glow of burning need that had John hitch a breath into Sherlock’s open mouth.
The door opens just enough for a small right hand to appear through it, clutching what looks like a fresh cup of coffee.
The same sensation of honeybees travelling across his skin returned. Sherlock opened his mouth but found that he was quite speechless. Would John ever cease to surprise him?
“Not interested in being manipulated by another Holmes, thank you,” John sneers back before striding towards the door. He needs to get out of punching range of Sherlock before he does something that he’ll regret later.
Anderson slid the book closer and opened it up to the page and location. The writing in the area was smeared by a rushed note, but it was clearly the handwriting of Sherlock Holmes. Even if Philip hadn't spent years in forensics ignoring the detective's snarky added comments on his weekly reports to Lestrade, now two years of investigating Sherlock's supposed death would have made knowing his handwriting more than child's play.
"The music of his violin won't give me answers," John agreed, and he lifted the violin up like a weapon over his head, and Mycroft stared. "Because it isn't about music. It's about the item itself, and you're terrified about my discovery of that. Your words have ratted you out."
This wasn’t what Sherlock needed at all. He had grown weary of the constant self-reflection and continued confirmations. Labels were meant to make obvious proclamations, yet he still found himself having to further explain.
Irene gave a little knowing grin as she handed Sherlock a drink of whiskey before sitting across from him in a matching loveseat. Her usually sweeping curls were arranged in an upstyle that had probably taken hours, and her dark blue dress and high heels told stories that Sherlock wasn’t sure he wanted to hear.
John breathed in and out too much now as if what Sally told him became the cure to three years of aborted respiration. He was a drowning man, and the realization of it all broke through the surface of his waterlogged lungs and cracked ribs along the way. Yet this was the type of glorious torture that John felt when bullet fragments so long ago had splintered through the tissue and bones of his shoulder. The type of misery that caused the body to fight for every heartbeat until there was no blood left. John refused to die alone on that battlefield.
“It’s obvious, John,” Sherlock sighed, but he could feel himself smiling. “There were a total of three people at the crime scene that early in the morning. Lestrade, Anderson and that new officer, what’s his name...Johnson.” Sherlock pointed at Lestrade and Johnson in the photo, both of them checking out the scattered evidence. “Anderson took the photo, so who else was there? Who else would have a reason to be around a dead body but leave before more of us arrived?”
“How about you?” John prompts, connecting that Sherlock’s mind is stuck somewhere between gears. “I always assumed that you knew you were gay since you were a child, but tonight shows that assumptions can be shit, so...when did that light bulb turn on for you?”
"What the fuck?" John curses, which is immediately echoed by the sound of frantic movement from the other room, as Sherlock half crashes through the door.
“You’re thinking very loudly,” Sherlock mutters as he turns his attention once more to the paperwork surrounding him.  “You and I were romantically involved, and now we’re not. We’re not teenagers, John. The need for dramatic gesticulations and assigning blame is beneath us.”
John’s fingers tightened on Sherlock’s hips, and he focused on his tongue. It positively wrecked Sherlock when John flattened his tongue and took Sherlock all the way in until the tip of his cock was pressed against the back of his throat and his tongue flat against his groin. Which is just what John did now. He relaxed his jaw and sunk down until his nose was flat against Sherlock’s abdomen. Then, with a hum that would have been a smirk if his lips weren’t otherwise occupied. He swallowed. As his throat constricted around the tip of Sherlock’s cock, he felt Sherlock’s legs quiver.
“We didn't have any sausages or beans, so I made pancakes instead. And, yeah...I’m a bit dodgy on the proper batter pouring technique for a skillet,” John grumbled, but he still had a smile. “Eat up, you madman. All that extracurricular activity must have you famished.”
The unsettled feeling increased. Sherlock didn’t need people like Leah coming into their already involved life. Leah. With her perfect teeth and silly little laugh. More than likely both the teeth and the laugh was as fake as other body parts of her were too. With all of them created to lure John back into the arms of the more familiar female form.
With a purr that turned quickly into a growl, Sherlock hoisted John up so that his feet left the ground and slammed him tightly against the wall. His cock slid back into place just as if it never left, and then Sherlock pounded John
John appears to be struggling as to whether to comfort him or continue to shout. Sherlock has seen that same look before in the few people he’d permitted to get too close.
The only door into the room opened and two more officers walked inside. The first one was a woman whom John would absolutely have pursued if this was a different time, place, and alternate reality. Her dark blue eyes peered over to John’s overnight bag and then to Harold before narrowing in on John in heavy judgment. She radiated the no-nonsense quality that probably made her very good at stopping both high-level drug smugglers and twitchy vacationers trying to avoid customs taxes.
"As long as you are on those, I will not allow you to get drunk. But don't worry, I'm going to make you stay sober alone."
With a smirk, Sherlock slows down to a light jog and pulls out his phone. Briggs gives a snarl before he spits in the consulting detective’s general direction.
Sometimes it felt as if the only thing they had in common were the cases. Even then, they were dominated by Sherlock. Sure, John relishes the chases, adores watching Sherlock’s mind at work, but he isn’t convinced his presence is necessary. If he walked away, Sherlock could function just as well without him, maybe better.
"Sherlock, it was bad, alright? Maybe not phonebook bad, but more than half my last regiment, and a good two thirds of another. It was easy, we all needed a connection, and sex was a quick way to achieve that. No one got hurt, or else no one was supposed to. I barely remember Julia. I think we slept together less than six times. She was a corporal, and that's literally all I remember. But after Mary, after I got shot, I was done. That life isn't me anymore, I swear."
“You left,” Sherlock splits out, his long arms waving madly. “Just shagged me senseless and left me covered in sparkly ejaculate.“
John opens the fridge, searching for something to eat, but he is greeted by nothing but a container of blood. He doesn’t have to look at the label to know it’s human.
There’s a rustle of a condom packet, followed by a nudge and a soft slide of John’s cock against me. It is enough for me to answer his another round with a push of my hips, and slowly he enters inside of me and begins to thrust in earnest. The sensation of him is everywhere, and I savour every centimetre of him. The naturalness of him as he peppers kisses across my collarbone and nips at my neck.
It took a few weeks of trial and error, but he finally arrived on a mixture that, when he inhaled, gave him a very familiar feeling of what John did when so near that Sherlock could hold him if he dared. It wasn’t exactly the same, because at the end of things it was just a cologne, but it was strikingly close.
Irene gives a small shrug before leaning back on the sofa, and Sherlock opens the door into the hallway with more force than necessary — he just needs to find a way out of this illusion. Perhaps a shock of some sort will do it. Obviously, Briggs must have stunned him and knocked him unconscious. His mind palace provided the rest.
. The familiar pang of irritation twitched in his stomach, but Sherlock pushed it away. Comments on how John could ‘put up with him’ were made daily by the likes of the yard, but they never hurt any less. Each time the phrase was muttered, Sherlock experienced the same wave of doubt — was John only ‘putting up’ with him? He couldn’t help his mannerisms, couldn’t switch off the traits that others found so annoying. The idea that John was with him despite those was painful, yet it was pointless to dwell.
“Okay,” John interrupted, taking a quick glance at the ceiling as if searching for an escape route. “Lestrade I think you’ve made your point—”
John giggles are so high-pitched that at this point only dogs can probably hear them, and Sherlock leans in to just relish in the beauty. This John is what he wanted all along. The carefree sweetness with that sultry edge that this night was all about. To capture this point in time before everything changes, and scorch it onto every wall in his mind palace.
“Not good?” Sherlock whispered into John’s ear, the amusement clear in his tone, and John chuckled again.
John makes his way to the till as Sherlock doubles back for a rainbow flag. A deep calm has settled over him, and he can appreciate the chaotic energy of the shop far more than he could before. It’s almost comforting, knowing that no one here is eyeing up their physical contact, judging them for their affection. He doesn’t have to worry about what anyone else thinks.
“As if I have to tell either of you the mastery of what I do. All the planning involved..the waiting for just the right moment to strike.”
They crept along the edge of the house until they found the garden, protected on all sides by high fences: no peering neighbours, an ideal murder spot. John broke the side gate as quietly as possible, but they both cringed at how loud it sounded in the darkness.
John snorts out a laugh, and I can’t help but join in. The two of us, him in red pants and me drinking what can only be tangentially called coffee, giggling as madly as if we were at a murder scene.
before plugging the papers back inside his inner pocket. They’ve already deviated from their drinking schedule, but oddly, Sherlock doesn’t mind. He’s enjoying the casualness of the evening.
“You’re exceedingly judgemental of what people use to cope. Especially since you chose Miss Adler as
"While this one," John rolled over, so his right bicep was visible. "is fairly self-explanatory, just the RAMC insignia. I did some of my best surgical work during my time in the army."
Eventually, Sherlock turns and walks back up the stairs, barely pausing to glance over his shoulder, in a clear instruction that John should follow. Once inside the sitting room, Sherlock takes his place by the window, glancing out onto the street and hiding his face. John desperately wants to spin him around, take that face in his hands and demand to know what the detective is thinking, but he refrains. The air is delicate; one wrong move and he could be back out on the pavement.
"Ho voglia di te.  Mi fai impazzire." Sherlock frowned and then looked into John's bemused expression. "Parlando Italiano?"
Sally frowned, then began to push the door closed. John’s face peered back a mirror of the same desperation that Sherlock had given her a year ago.
To give himself something to do, Sherlock adjusts his Belstaff and surges forward up the next street with John right behind. He needs to get a grip on the night and keep the script in the centre of his brain. Record John’s emotions, deduce his motivations, and get his own feelings out of the equation, no matter what.
Anderson chuckled softly, and John gave a small smile back. "Just make a remark about my stupidity and you have him down perfectly."
Sherlock has been collecting information about him and his reactions. More specifically, his sexual preferences. There’s a log sheet of each time they had sex, dating right back to that first time, pushed up against the kitchen table. Next to each one is a complicated rating system, measuring John’s physical reactions and comparing them to the time, location, and type of act performed.
proud of who he'd been before. But he'd seen the issue and had worked on rectifying it. And he'd done a good job.
"Don't stop," sherlock whined,  his toes pointing out and flexing madly, "I love what you do to me."
It's BACK! lol Little by little we are chipping away at this thing :) Enterthetadpole and I are so excited to share the next update of this lovely story with you all. We hope it is all that you've been waiting for and we can't wait to add more to it! :) Thank you all for sticking with us while we navigate school, work, and just life in general as things slowly get back to "normal". We appreciate your support and are lucky to have such wonderful readers! xoxo
Before long, Sherlock is writhing over the bedclothes, feet grappling for purchase as John brings him to the edge. Eventually, John can’t wait any longer, and he opens the bottle of lube with a snap and applies a generous amount to his cock, groaning at the touch. He briefly wonders whether they should use a condom, but he knows for a fact that neither of them has slept with anyone else since the breakup, and they were clean before. Sherlock mutters something, and John looks down into the half mooned eyes.
Sherlock fought to keep his face straight; unwilling to let the hurt slip through his carefully built mask. His Sherlock. John made him sound like a pet — or worse, some lingering presence that he couldn’t wait to get rid of. Had he missed something? Were they not calling each other partners any more?
"A mother found him out here this early morning," Lestrade replied. "Not the best way to start your morning...anyway, he has the marks of being strangled, even with all the decomp. The forensics team placed his death at about a month prior, but hard to tell with all the dirt and the cold weather. We should get a better idea once Molly gets a look at him.”
“How about you stick to the job you’re paid to be incompetent at!” Sherlock spits, tugging at his curls.
“I — I meant it, by the way.” He stuttered. The words felt wrong in his mouth — casual conversation had never been his strong suit. At least with anyone who wasn’t John.
“Not yet.” Lestrade’s voice was quieter, but Sherlock was still able to make him out. “Told us the proper name of the new coffee shop on the corner. Well, more bellowed it at us, but that’s a normal afternoon. Don’t get how you deal with it, John. Especially with...now and everything.”
Molly nods and places her teacup on the table. Better to have nothing to drop, what with her hands shaking the way that they are.
“Oh, no. I’m, uh — we’re not together anymore. My friend, Molly Hooper, works here. She was picking up some of my things for me. I’m just waiting for her.”
“Yes,” John confirmed. “Known about them for a while. Didn’t bother to break them or report you because I knew it wouldn’t have mattered. That’s what you do, right? What you need to do to feel in control. Just another fish in a - “
"Good times, Sherlock," John whispered between licks and nibbles, "don't always require alcohol. This," he said while cupping a firm hand over Sherlock's groin and leaving a faint line of red on Sherlock's jaw from his teeth, "wasn't injured. So, if you're willing… I could suck you off."
Sherlock tries to inhale a shock of breath that his body can no longer handle, but nothing happens, and darkness falls before he even hits the cold concrete morgue floor.
Sherlock gapes back at him and John gives an over-exaggerated shrug. “Might as well get into the full spirit of the night, and anyway...less money that one of us has to spend. I’ll make sure it’s something top shelf.”
He needed to work fast. Even now the scent of the omega’s heat was growing with every passing minute. It had been easier to ignore it when he had been more focused on getting them both indoors, but now there was no outside airflow to block the rolling aroma, the combination of desire mixed with the much softer scent of flowers radiating from all around him
John is laughing, giddy beyond relief, and before he connects what his body is doing, he is holding Sherlock in his arms and feels Sherlock holding him back. The deep baritone chuckles are the best and only sound that John needs to hear for the rest of his life.
“So, this script,” John begins, his tone casual. “Is this just like...a list of places that we’re going, or something more involved?”
“Yes.” He brings the cigarette to his lips and takes a puff, throwing his head to the sky and slowly exhaling the smoke, as if making a point.
you not tell me that your cock felt this good," Sherlock moaned, absolutely accusatory. "I would have demanded to bottom first you inscrutable -
“Here you are,” the server said as he placed the appetiser on the table along with the salads. “Anything else I can get for you, or your friend?” He looked at John expectantly. Sherlock cocked his head, waiting for John to correct him.
"Fuck," it was the only thing John could think to say. As if Sherlock had ripped every other word from the English language from his memory with his cock. "Fuuck," he said again, then his right hand grabbed hold of Sherlock's hips, and they were moving. There weren't the awkward few seconds where each person attempted to match the other's rhythm. There was just perfect harmony as they moved in unison. John's hand slid across Sherlock's erection simply from the force of their movements, and he was pitifully aware that this would not last long. John angled his thumb so it would slide perfectly across the glans on the tip of Sherlock's cock, and managed a wicked grin at the string of curses that rose up out of Sherlock's throat.
So, with a small sigh, John settles on reading the paper. Its crinkling will be slightly less intrusive to an otherwise fussy detective. Thankfully, the newspaper is this evening’s news, so John will need to add giving Mrs Hudson a grateful hug to tomorrow’s to-do list. His eyes scan over an article about a small break in just out of town, then to a bake sale for charity going on over the weekend before his lingering military senses perk up at the sensation of being watched.
They finally make it to the flat, ignoring the hand-written note from Mrs Hudson, taped to the door. It says something about a client stopping by earlier in the night, but Sherlock barely reads it. That’s a problem for tomorrow.
Molly stammered out an explanation that she had texted John right before Sherlock said that he was coming alone, but Sherlock barely took notice of it. John was already striding over and asking her questions about the new information, and Sherlock decided it was best to just take notes and focus on the case for now.
The man who followed her in was older and struck a much more fatherly figure. He had laugh lines that were well worn with age and hair the colour of freshly fallen snow. He could have been the age of John’s father if he hadn’t taken that bottle of bourbon night after night over the last couple of decades. So, splendid. John was trapped in a room with uniformed embodiments of a past he’d been escaping in various degrees. The conflicted army days. The pressures of consistent heterosexuality. The ghost of a parent whom John would never be able to make proud.
John opened his mouth to retort, when Sherlock’s mobile rang this time. Sherlock snarled as he placed his laptop on the table beside him and grabbed at his phone. He frowned at the caller ID.
As he loaded up his laptop and connected to the motel’s wifi, he thought, and not for the first time, that if anyone knew of his pass time, they might fight it odd. After a long day at work, most men opted to watch a bit of porn or take part in some internet gambling. John, for his part, liked to read obituaries. Partly it was to see what families had to say about their lost loved one. But mostly, he liked to check that his client’s names never appeared in the list of the recently departed.
“Isn’t it obvious?” She turns and walks away from him, and the purple shirt has begun to hang off her now, waving ever so slightly as she moves. “You have to really want it.”
price point is 30,000 pounds, John. Get my parents on the phone. My brother has gone insane and needs to be committed. He has access to nuclear codes, dear bloody fuck." Sherlock flapped his hand near his face to try to give himself some additional air. The walls were closing upon him. "That diabolical prick. He devised this all in a masterpiece of villainy to kill me off from the shock of it. I'll come back as a ghost and spook him the rest of his life over this."
“And again.” The figure in front of him rests the tip of her crop on his ankle, slowly running it up the side of his leg. Despite the numbness, he feels a slight tickle as it travels towards his waist.
The marathon of sex is going on in the upper bedroom, and I am trying not to break things, including my teeth from all of the clenching. The rhythmic banging of John’s headboard reverberates through the flat and is a metronome that screams over and over again that he is fucking someone. And
John frowns at the top of Sherlock’s head of dark curls as the slender man is bowed over in clear concentration. His curiosity is in deep conflict with his need to just explain this away as Sherlock being Sherlock. Still, even for the detective, this is odd, and despite John’s enjoyment of relaxation after a day at the surgery, he presses forward.
“I don’t fucking believe you,” John muttered. He was moving, and not towards Sherlock. Away from him. The space between them grew, and Sherlock searched for something to say. To fix this. “Not that you should do anything that you don’t want...I mean, I...I should go.”
Gratefully the woman is dead to the world and her body is swallowed up in a sea of dark blue and downy soft duvet covers. Good. If John is quiet enough he’ll be able to slip out of the bed, find the majority of his clothes, and get a cab back to his hole in the ground of a bedsit before his partner for the night even wakes up.
“There we go, I knew we’d get there eventually.” Irene looks unperturbed, still sat at the microscope, watching him intently. Sherlock’s heart pounds in his chest, only, it can’t be his heart, because he’s watching John Watson pump the remaining blood around his lifeless body.
by the nametag -- reminded John of a few blokes he knew back in his army days. Tall and muscular with sharp eyes that had seen more in a lifetime than men twice their age, and a smirk that could curdle cream.
A thick wave of nausea creeps over him, and John wants to close the program immediately, but he can't bring himself to look away. There's something disturbing and invasive, seeing their physical relationship mapped out like this, as if there was nothing more between them than pure sex.
Sherlock's knees buckled at the intensity of the pleasure. He swivelled his hips and heard the slap on the slap of their skin, the jostling motion of John's limbs as he took every thrust with an absolute certainty that Sherlock never knew could exist in sex. It took all of Sherlock's strength not to roar out something so sentimental that he'd be forced to move out of the country and start a brand new life.
“I do, but I don’t want you to do it as a one off. I don’t want to be one of your one night stands, forgotten by the time you bring the next one home. That’s not who I am. That’s not how I see you.”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock mutters, turning his eyes back to the painting. “I have no place to judge who you sleep with, anyway.”
A small part of him reminded Mycroft that they hadn’t tried stealing classified information at the very least. Not that this was any better. Mycroft hadn’t been able to negotiate to prevent the Major General from viewing the session, though Anthea had managed to cut his feed quickly. Not quickly enough, considering the slew of text alerts on Mycroft’s phone.
“The drama queen gene is a hereditary trait, then?” John chides, ignoring the twist in his stomach as Sherlock brushes his worries off without care. He should have known that Sherlock wouldn’t put much weight behind his brother’s antics. He’d rather pour over old case files. “Why are you looking through all these again? I thought they’d be in your mind palace by now.”
“Is that everything?” Sherlock asks, barely breaking concentration. A stab of anger flashes through John’s stomach. Is that it? Six months of sharing a bed, ended in an almost business-like transaction? He’d expected — well, he’s not sure what he’d expected. Shouting, maybe? Either way, he hadn’t expected such a perfunctory conclusion. A gentle termination of their relationship as if it were a contract. Then again, this is Sherlock. He shouldn’t have expected anything else.
“What were the last few days about?” John asks, running his thumb along Sherlock’s cheek. The detective shivers beneath him and lets his eyes flutter closed, just for a moment.
John made it to the living room, gun held out in front of him, and nearly shot at the man standing in the lounge. He had his back to John and was inspecting the painting of a skull above the sofa. Tall, with a body built quite similarly to Sherlock's (if a bit more obviously muscular), his short hair sat neatly combed at the nape of his neck.
He pauses, his fist centimetres away from Sherlock’s door. Doubt crawls back into his mind — is this a good idea? He pushes it away and forces himself to knock on the door. It opens too quickly, as if Sherlock had been waiting for him on the other side.
John notices that he can’t speak because he’s not sure what will stammer out if he does. His heart is expanding so much that he might float away like a balloon, with Sherlock doing his best to catch him before he disappears amongst the clouds.
“Please,” The bed felt surprisingly empty as John crawled out, fishing Sherlock’s housecoat off the chair in the corner. Their clothes had been long abandoned in the kitchen, both desperate to touch skin-to-skin, unable to wait until they had crossed the threshold to the bedroom. They had almost gotten off against the doorway, but John had had the sense to pull them inside and onto the bed before their knees had buckled beneath them.
How? It was quite obvious Pierce must have had an accomplice; the man couldn’t be in two places at once, and it was true that the details hadn’t yet been released to the public. Not fully. Yet, there was another victim. Freshly rotting.
With a grumble, Sherlock snapped the magnifying glass shut and looked up to meet the steely gaze of Lestrade. He was strongly reminded of how fatherly the DI could be when the moment called for it.
The Sherlock he’s seeing today is one that usually only appears at home, the relaxed, gentle soul whose walls have fallen all the way down. The man that comforts scared children and stops to pet every dog he sees, the man who is usually hidden behind a hundred layers of defences. John knows that Sherlock hasn’t had an easy life, that the defensive, sharp-tongued detective has been shaped by years of being treated as an outcast, but here he gets to witness the true man inside. Over the past year and a half they’ve worked hard to get where they are, acknowledging their flaws and celebrating their successes, and John is grateful for every second of it. He wants more. He wants it forever.
At least that’s what John woke up to in the middle of sweat-filled nights. The looping dreams all with his fingers wrapped around that elegant neck and squeezing until the excuses came out, or he’d be pulled off by the local authorities. Whichever came first. It barely mattered anymore.
Some days John really loved his job. Today was one of those days. He was currently standing with his legs firmly planted over a man who lay cowering on the ground. He had the barrel of his gun pointed directly at the man's head. A thick metallic click resounded through the otherwise still night air as he pulled back the hammer and adjusted his aim. The man below him began to whimper and he thrust out a hand as if his fingers could stop the bullet from reaching his skull.
Mary waited for John to come back to himself. Her eyes glassy with tears that seemed to be not falling only by her own sheer iron will. Gravity be damned if she would cry anymore over someone who was never hers in the first place. She could live with being second best. To be dwarfed in the shadow of a ghost whose eyes lit up the starry sky and whose voice still called out to John beyond the grave.
Silence shouldn't be full of this much noise. The small crackles of electrical intensity that would kill lesser men. Yet both of them somehow were still able to stand upright.
In a moment, Sherlock’s hand was on John’s zip and pulled it slowly down. All the while, he watched John’s face for pleasure. Then with a groan, Sherlock pushed off John’s trousers and black pants to expose his gorgeous arse to the camera. If Mycroft hadn’t already run shouting from the room, that move was certain to do it.
“I have the address,” John said quickly. “We can get there in twenty minutes if we get ready now.” A pause. “Okay, see you there, Greg.”
Meanwhile, Sherlock was doing his absolute best not to punch a hole into the nearest wall. Anderson left over half an hour ago, and yet Sherlock felt that Philip was way too close. Three years he had wasted with all of the lies and excuses before Sherlock had finally had enough of it all. Anderson pleaded for him to give him yet another chance, and Sherlock gave his answer in the form of the engagement band thrown to the carpeted floor of their shared home.
“Of course I’ve missed something—” Sherlock yelled, taking a deep breath as the DI straightened his spine and crossed his arms over his chest. “We’ve missed something, but I don’t think it’s here. I’m going back to Baker Street. Call me if you find anything.”
“Nothing, I just—” John gave a little sigh, and his shoulders fell a couple of centimetres. “I’m trying to make an effort, that’s all. After what happened...”
A server with tons of tattoos and piercings placed two more pints on the table and walked away without a word.
Mary was cunning and knew her way around medication. If she'd managed to get in the flat, even for a second, the open bottle of scotch would have been her first option for contamination. Instead, he changed tactics and went for the still sealed bottle of Black Label whiskey. He poured out a generous helping, drank half of it himself, then brought the rest out to Sherlock.
John’s hands slid around Sherlock’s arse up the small of Sherlock’s back before settling on his hips. He felt a hand settle in his hair and glanced up to see those gorgeous eyes watching him. Though he was fully clothed, he felt naked under that gaze.
“I don’t know, Harry. Stop trying to be his advocate. I don’t need that right now, I need someone on my side. I can’t love someone who won’t love me back. I can’t let myself become consumed by him again, only to have him drop me whenever a more interesting case comes up. I need more than to be something to occupy his time. I need to be respected and valued. What happened with him and me...it’s not what relationships are built on...no matter how much devotion I bring to the table.”
She had been. It was her birthday — the first birthday that she’s spent out, as herself. As Molly Jane Hooper, and she’s been excited to spend the day doing all the things she’s wanted to do since she was a child, but always been too scared. She and Irene had been shopping last week to find the perfect swimwear, travelling from store to store until she eventually found one she was comfortable with. They’d found a beautiful skirt-like bottom, with lots of loose material that made her feel less self-conscious about being so exposed, and Irene had paired it with a beautiful blue bikini top that pinched in all the right places. They were going to have afternoon tea, then lounge the afternoon away in the spa, drinking cocktails at the bar in the evening.
of its contents to me in the morning? It would be unfortunate if the hospital asked me to step through a metal detector with that or my coat in my possession."
"Stay there," John said as he stepped into the living room and motioned for Sherlock to stay on the sofa. While Mary certainly wouldn't be knocking on the door, he wasn't about to take any chances.
By the third day, John is ready to burst. Each compliment grates him; every thoughtful gesture sends him into a spiral of overthinking, and he almost wishes for the return of snarky Sherlock. Anything but this false layer of affection, the overly forced friendship.
John silences Sherlock’s final word with a searing kiss while simultaneously grabbing hold of Sherlock’s wrists and pushing them up to the frame of the headboard. ‘Ambidextrous enough to handle a squirming consulting detective’ should be written on John’s sexual resume. As if anyone would be allowed to see it other than Sherlock and himself.
Sherlock took it all and loved it all. The smell of John’s skin and the taste of his kisses. The weight of John’s body on top of his and the slight sting of his teeth. It was enrapturing and the things that inspired dreams. The pressure inside Sherlock’s loins was building more and more, and John knew exactly when to speed up, slow down and take Sherlock right to the edge.
"You are way too cocky to have such leverage over me, John… and as that saying goes from those ludacris Batman comics, 'With great power comes great responsibility."
Sherlock’s mouth opens long enough to register his surprise before he closes it with a comical sound. Irene’s chuckles fill the room. He turns and opens the door once more, despite already knowing what he’ll find on the other side. This time, he opens the door marked number 29, and sure enough, as he steps through the doorway, the same lilac dressed room is there to greet him. Irene is in the same place, smiling serenely.
“If it helps,” Harry mentions, taking back her phone. “He’s a self-admitted sociopath from what I’ve heard. Prattles on about how working cases is all he cares about so...it was probably a good thing that you scampered off afterward.”
John spends far too much time staring at his plate before he finally prods the slimy substance with his fork. The noise it makes reminds him so much of a Sherlock experiment that he’s sure he’ll never have an appetite ever again.
He grabs my wrist and pulls me over to the bed, accurately predicting that my knees will give out sooner or later. His knees nudge my legs open and my trousers and pants are pulled down to my knees. He slides a condom over my already hard length, and I glance down to see him between my legs. John kisses my stomach, then travels lower until his mouth envelopes me whole. I groan and my hips push instinctively up and in. His mouth is a simmering fire and everything on me feels too tight. He moves his hands and gently pinches my nipples, all the while rolling his tongue around my shaft with a skill that should not be possible.
Sherlock felt his throat tighten, but managed to give a curt little nod before deciding that accepting a drink from Irene was perhaps not the best idea.
"A check that will keep you very well off for the next few years. To leave here and do what will assist you in being more than what I've witnessed on those video clips. You deserve that for being my little brother's…"
The last part of the insult was thrust away by a twist of John's hips that Sherlock knew must be illegal. He'd add that to the list of charges to give to his legal team. That was if he survived this in the end. Murder by orgasms may have to be added to the filings.
“I don’t know!” John desperately tries to keep the desperation out of his voice. Sherlock is standing by the fireplace, watching him like a hawk. It’s like trying to have an argument with a microscope
“Here is a figment of my imagination,” Sherlock replies. “Created by a hit to the head or something equally monotonous.”
As he picks up the two plastic cups, decorated with the symbolic rainbow flag, he mentally kicks himself. How could he be so stupid? There’s an assortment of pride flags hung from the ceiling, and half the couples in here are same-sex. Hell, he and John had been checked out as they’d entered. All the signs were there, but he’d been too flustered by his and John’s proximity to notice them.
“Well, I…” he stutters, before helping me back up to my feet. “She won’t have to hear anything but us from now on...I mean, that is, whenever you are ready for us to get to that level of intimacy. I am in no hurry to do anything thing you do— “
John frowns at Sherlock as if he has two or three heads. Then frowns even deeper as Sherlock lets go of his other hand and takes a few measured steps back.
pulling all-nighters like most other cases, but Sherlock seems unusually calm. Sherlock has theories, of course, but he insists that the bodies are too infrequent to make any definite conclusions. Perhaps that is why the usual indifferent mask never falls, and Sherlock retains his sickly-sweet persona from the last few days.
His eyes roll back as he moans out my name, and it’s better than even my fondest dreams. It’s almost reverent, despite the dirtiness of his words. How he will have me in every part of the flat that has room for the two of us, and I say challenge accepted to it.
Panic was setting in, and Sherlock shifted up to meet John’s gaze. Eye contact. Openness. John liked that. He needed John to be happy again. Pleased with him.
"Present for you, Doctor Watson, from Mr Holmes. Mister Mycroft Holmes, that is," the man said with a gesture to the bags at his feet. "He said to pass along his regret at ever seeing a British Agent in a shirt professing his love for America."
Sherlock’s eyes sprang open, and he pushed himself away from the wall. John was right. A hit wasn’t going to fix him. It might help him solve the case, but what about the next one? He couldn’t stay constantly high again. John wouldn’t allow it, nor Mycroft and Lestrade, and as much as he hated to admit it, his body couldn’t cope. Not again.
Sherlock angled his hips so that John's index finger made contact, and the groan that ripped out of his throat belonged in the back of sex alleys, but Sherlock hardly cared. He needed John to hurry up before he lost whatever was left of his mind completely.
For a moment, the metallic rattling of the drawer being pulled open mutes all of the other sounds, until Sherlock finds himself staring at the corpse of himself. The eyes are open, yet there is only the ghost of what he used to be. The mouth is parted, and those cupid bow lips are a muddled blue. The curls glisten with a wetness that doesn’t connect with anything else about the body. However, it’s what happens next that sends yet another shiver down Sherlock’s spine.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied. “I’m taking us to Angelo’s and then we’ll head back to the flat. You usually enjoy a good meal and red wine before fornication.”
When they’d left the house that morning, they’d been dressed in simple, smart clothes that stood in contrast to the colourful garments the rest of the crowds were wearing. Feeling underdressed, they’d ducked into a nearby pop-up shop to see what accessories they could find, which is where they stood now. Up until this moment, John has not given huge consideration to what identity fits him best. If asked, he would probably claim he was bisexual, but faced with the myriad of flags in front of him, he’s no longer sure.
No, what he needed was to speak to someone directly. Usually, John would be his first call -- the doctor knew more about these things than the detective himself, but Sherlock wasn’t ready to broach the topic with his friend. Nor could he speak to Mrs Hudson or Lestrade; whilst they might have the enthusiasm, they lacked the insight Sherlock required. And Mycroft was out of the question. That left only one other person Sherlock trusted to broach the topic with.
Sherlock never thought that he could care about the solar system, but of course it takes John Watson to do it.
“Speakerphone, if you would…” the older male officer mentioned. “We don’t want any more secrets amongst friends.”
“Hey, come with me a second?” John murmurs into Sherlock’s ear, pulling at his hand and leading him off the steps. They walk around the back of the gallery until John finds a relatively quiet street. A few people are milling at the end, but they ignore the two men.
The comments and kudos for this story have given me life and thank you for them. Also as always thank you to the lovely and supportive SherlockWatson_Holmes for their beta work!!
He had always known he was different. Had always known where his attractions lay, and it had never been a big deal, for him. His parents had been progressive enough to not ask invasive questions or expect him to come home with anyone he fancied. But still, they never talked about it. No one mentioned how he never brought girlfriends home like Mycroft, or how the pictures of Alan Turing and Steven Pinker on his wall weren’t purely ‘for science’. It was as if he didn’t exist.
Or, just follow us both on twitter and watch for the post that will inevitably happen when we start posting #2
So, with such a colourful history, John does his level best not to feel cornered. Unfortunately for the person who John now knows as Sherlock Holmes — consulting detective of Scotland Yard — is not aware of any of this.
It had been only a number of times that Philip had seen Dr. John Watson since the funeral. The copper blonde head bowed and huddled up next to Martha Hudson. Hard to tell who was holding up the other from collapse on that ironically sunny day. Of course, Sherlock Holmes wasn’t
He groans again, cradling his head in his hands, breathing heavily through his nose and trying to will his stomach to stop trying to jump into his mouth.
“You look like you’ve had a nice night,” Sarah says with a grin. “May want to try to keep that happy mood for the gargoyle in room five.”
In the earlier years before Sherlock, or BS as John amusingly called it, he drank when he found himself overthinking everything. Back at University, his younger body could handle the distractions of pub crawls and very enthusiastic women. Now, neither held any more appeal than a nice night at home with Sherlock, watching crap telly and eating Chinese takeaway.
John frowns at Harry, but does what she requests. He tries to pull out any emotional connection to the spreadsheet. Pluck away every bit of sentimentality he possibly can.
"Our results are back, obviously. But if you want me to use a condom, I will." John whispered when his hand had travelled low enough to brush against the base of Sherlock's cock. His lips were on Sherlock's shoulder, and there was a beautiful purple circle rising to the surface where he'd applied just a bit too much suction. He kissed the patch, then ran his tongue over it as he realised he wanted to leave more marks on Sherlock's skin. More and more until there was no doubt in anyone's mind that Sherlock was loved and wanted.
"I'm a former military who had the misfortune of having to report to Mycroft Holmes if you catch my drift," John said after he'd gotten up, ordered them both a pint, and returned to the table. Most of my record is locked up to anyone other than someone of Mycroft's clearance or higher because most of what I did was intel gathering or… morally ambiguous. Does the name Greville Wynne mean anything to you?"
Filthy promises that would have Mrs Hudson clutching her pearls. Granted, I am not sure Mrs Hudson wears her good pearls beyond special occasions, but my point still stands. John’s sex with women was just a thing that I learned to tolerate. A well-known activity that existed in the flat like random clients that beg us to take on level two cases that involve cheating spouses or missing paychecks. This, this feels different.
“Sherlock, it’s a little more complicated than that. It’s not like we just stop having sex and everything’s back to how it was before.”
“How?” Sherlock hissed. “Give me one instance where you pointedly told anyone, on your own accord, that we’re romantically involved.”
Sherlock was relieved that John couldn't see his pinkening cheeks. Whatever Mary Morstan gave him was powerful, but the effects were obviously melded so the person under the influence would remember everything that had been said and done. Sherlock would need to delve into the darker aspects of that later, but for now, he just wanted John to be the only one in the flat so that they could just be together in the best possible ways.
“Yes,” John answers finally. “During cases, I guess? Though nothing as disturbingly detailed as what I stumbled across.”
That was plenty to shut the man up, and the exchange quickly finished. Then, with a sharp turn, Sherlock headed in the opposite direction, already rethinking the wiseness of this plan.
Sherlock could hear Lestrade holding his breath, and the familiar background noise of the yard began to bleed through. The muffled beeping of the photocopier; shuffled feet along the carpeted floor. He must have been in the staffroom. We he grabbing another coffee?
to be your partner. Even when I was in hospital after the car accident, when I was so angry at you for not answering your bloody phone, you were the only person I wanted to see.”
But then he was standing, and the scissors were snipping their way up each trouser leg. When he stood in front of Sherlock, in nothing but his shoes and socks, he grinned. They both made quick work of their footwear. Then (after ensuring the scissors were on the table), John walked up to Sherlock and threw him over his shoulder.
Sherlock looks pointedly out of the taxi car window in response. The larger buildings slowly are being replaced by rolling hills and thickets of trees. Sherlock wiggles in his seat, arms, and legs just as crossed as his mood.
Sherlock rasped out a laugh as he touched John's cheek with his hand. "You made the Braca's area of my brain switch over from English to both French and Italian. I'm also quite sure that if the human soul exists that mine shot through my cock and now has its home somewhere in your digestive system. The least I can do after all of that is take a shower with you."
Sherlock feels as if all the air has been removed from his chest. How different could things have been, if only he’d been brave enough to try? All this time, he’s been convincing himself that John just isn't interested. In him, in men, in a relationship with his friend. And yet, not only was he utterly wrong about John’s identity, John had clearly expressed his interest when they’d first met. Would they still be here if Sherlock had just taken a chance? Would he have still fallen, spent two lonely years wishing he was back home with John, or would they have taken out Moriarty together? He doesn’t know.
Three days was not long enough to scrub through the halls and walls of Sherlock’s mind palace and forget what had happened that night. How could he have been so stupid to think that his lust for John would be enough to stop all of the deductions? It was always the more logical option to only trust his innate ability to read John’s needs. That calculations and analytics were the true way to a long-lasting relationship, and Sherlock desired that more than he’d thought was conceivably possible.
John stilled for a moment and gave a small nod before he continued to walk away. He headed to the front door, pulled his coat off the rack and left the flat without another word. Odd. John usually only went to the surgery on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Had Sherlock not been paying close enough attention to the days of the week? He checked the date on his laptop.
Sherlock glared as Anderson turned on his heel and headed out of the door. Only the echoing of his footfalls and the deep gulps of black coffee were the only sounds to be heard, which was perfectly fine.
John got one knee detangled from the duvet, which was all the added leverage he needed. He altered his angle with a thrust and a twist, slamming his cock straight into Sherlock's prostate. The reaction was immediate. They both screamed. It wasn't a shout, or a moan, or even a groan. It was a primal scream that echoed off the walls and probably ended up bouncing through the broken window where anyone walking past could hear. John's head bent forward, and he lost the ability to keep his eyes open.
After that, it’s a blur until John gently pushes Sherlock into the back of a cab. The driver has a look of apprehension as to what might happen to his car’s upholstery, which is more than fair. Thankfully, John appears to have better control of his speech than Sherlock at the moment, and gives proper directions back to 221b. This gives Sherlock plenty of time to mull over the events of the night so far. His original plan of just finding out more about John has been blasted apart by so much new data that he can’t adequately file it away. Especially when he is the level of drunk that he didn’t believe possible, whilst still being bafflingly conscious.
. Which is how he'd come to be her escort to an art show she was scheduled to attend. Knowing Eugine was local to the event, it seemed like a good enough chance to end this once and for all.
John immediately relaxes once he sees more subtly prideful clothing. There are simple collared shirts with small pride logos along with varieties of small pieces of jewellery and neckties. He pauses to pick up a black leather belt with a slender section of magenta, purple and blue and wonders how well it might fit.
“Is this okay?” John asks, breaking the urgency for a moment. He needs this; needs to be in control — to lay Sherlock beneath him and know that every sound that passes his lips is because of him, but he needs to know that Sherlock’s on the same page.
“I...excuse me,” Sherlock interrupts, his voice almost mechanical. He takes a few wary steps backwards, like John’s a rabid animal that somehow got trapped in the flat. Carefully creating a distance that John doesn’t want, now or ever again if he could help it. John can only watch the taller man retreat into the shadows of the hallway, and the bedroom door slamming shut is a statement of how Sherlock truly feels.
Sherlock glanced over to where John was hunched on the floor, his jeans now bunched into a ball in front of his crotch.
“I know. I get that now, after having time to think things through. If anything, what you did, even though unconventional, was...flattering? To be so important to garner a spreadsheet by Sherlock Holmes…”
He starts at the beginning, in that lab at Barts, and works his way through all the cases. All the breathless runs across London, how he left his cane and the war in the booth of an Italian restaurant. How he was kidnapped by a madman and all he could think about was making sure his detective was safe. How, without realising, he fell in love with a genius that didn’t know the earth went around the sun.
Sherlock closes the gap between them until their skin lies flush against each other; chest to chest. His curls are a tangle from what John’s hands can do when they have a defining purpose. John presses against him, savouring the contact, because he needs the closeness only Sherlock can give him. The next kiss is tentative and warm, with just the right amount of teeth and tongue. Long arms tighten around John’s middle, and they stay like this for who knows how long. Time slows to a crawl and John doesn’t care, but he knows that at some point this lapse in both of their judgements will have an expiration date.
Shifting his stance to regain his centre of gravity, he scooped the omega’s body up from the pavement and worked his way into a standing position. He tried his best not to think too much into the consequences he could face if he was caught but it was harder than he had imagined. John was well aware that what he was doing could land him in serious trouble, but, for the moment, he had a job to do: He would care for the omega and make sure that he was safe from harm just as he had vowed to do all those years ago after being sworn into medical school.
He chided himself when Sherlock didn't recoil from him at the mention of condoms. Perhaps he hadn't read the mood wrong after all. However, whatever was about to happen between himself and this graceful creature. He owed it to Sherlock to be smart about it.
,” Sherlock says. “The large wings, incessant hunger for sex…the emotions that you stir up when you touch me. Hold me. And I concede that incubi haven’t been seen for close to two centuries…”
value your opinion you’re still angry. What the hell do you want from me, John?” Sherlock asks, waving his hand through the air, his face tightly pinched with frustration.
He groans again and repeats the same five words because his throbbing skull is evidently trying to separate itself from the rest of the body. More than likely to find a more responsible owner who knows that men in their late thirties should bloody well stop after eight shots of—.
Sunlight. Both a giver a life and a reminder that drinking too much alcohol is a really shitty decision. John Watson knows this both through general theory and practical application.
The voice belongs to a young man at the front desk, his suit and smile both impeccable. Within a few moments, the front desk clerk is over by the sofa and holding out his hand for Sherlock to take. Instead, Sherlock slides off the sofa and gives the clerk the once over for deduction. Yet nothing comes up. Everything is unknown, from the man’s light brown hair to his over-shined shoes. No significant data is available to collect. Sherlock blinks and takes a step back.
“Erm…” John began, trying to push all thoughts of Sherlock’s nakedness out of his mind. “Three suits and two pairs of dress shoes. My laptop and some medical textbooks. A tie?”
It takes all the self-restraint he has to step away from the door and make his way upstairs. The light illuminates his pathway to a life he thought had gone past all of this, and yet, here he is once more. His old bedroom seems colder than usual as he enters, and in a small pile at the foot of the bed are the three pairs of pants and a couple of shirts that, up until now, had found a home in Sherlock’s top dresser drawer. For someone so meticulous about his own clothes, he showed little care for John’s.
“Why are you here?” he asks, pulling a nearby stool from off to the side to sit on. “Usually it is only me who comes into my mind palace. It’s a place meant for me to sort thoughts and theories. Formulate patterns and clues.”
John rolled his tongue around the base as his hands gripped Sherlock’s arse and caressed in a circular motion. The rush of arousal broke over Sherlock’s body over and over again as he placed his hands into the short golden hair and gave a tiny thrust.
She keeps going over and over the incident again. The purchased wine sits unopened and abandoned in the rubbish bin as she tries to figure out how to deal with situations like yesterday better in the future. She needs to not fall apart at what ignorant people say and do.
“Welsh clay tiles!” He exclaimed, banging his palm against the table and causing a half-asleep John to jerk awake and almost fall out of his chair.
John managed to get his right foot planted firmly on the floor as he spoke. He pressed his weight down on that leg for leverage and brought his other knee up with as much force as he could manage straight into Sebastian's testicles.
John wanders into Sherlock’s bedroom and quickly finds the machine under a stack of case files. He could swear they were reproducing by the day. Absentmindedly, he sits on the edge of the bed and types in what he hopes is the password. For all Sherlock’s whining that John can’t create a secure password, the man never changes his own. It takes John a few tries, but he successfully logs in.
"I should have heard the shower," John shook his head, brushing off the apology. "In the two days I've known you, I've forgotten every ounce of my training. Got you injured, failed to keep a calm head before clearing the flat, what next? Truthfully, I'm surprised someone like Seb hasn't tried to cut my dick off before now. If we can get Julia's number, or arrange a meeting in a public place, I'll talk with her. Just
"Basic stripping is just that. Basic," Sherlock whispered. "These were a gift from a runway designer whom I assisted whilst on holiday in Italy. I never came up with a good enough reason to test them out until now."
Sherlock nodded, carefully placing his violin back in the case, forcing himself to focus on the task in hand rather than letting his brain run wild. It was only during the dessert of apple pie, made courtesy of Mrs Hudson, that Sherlock began to relax once more. The need to go over the particulars of the day slowed down to just relishing the warmth of John sitting beside him on the sitting room sofa. John leaned over, grinning stupidly as Sherlock explained a mould experiment gone wrong from earlier in the week.
“It’s 4:30 in the afternoon,” I shout in exasperation, but the only answer I get is a flood of curse words and groans. I stomp off to the kitchen and heavily contemplate leaving the country for a while. I hear France is nice this time of year.
“I barely speak to Harry,” John snapped. “And even if I did somehow go insane enough to tell my car-crash of a sister that I decided to pursue a…”
Sherlock sighed and considered his options. He could blatantly lie, and risk John calling his bluff, or he could tell the truth. He decided on the truth.
kind of way and I storm out with the rest of the biscuits in tow. Only, when I get to the top of the stairs, I hear the amorous noises once more.
Both of John's hands still at the sentiment of Sherlock's admission. Sherlock’s tenderness when all of his outer shell's thorns fall away is a sight that John has missed.
Mycroft used to tell Sherlock that emotions were for the logically disadvantaged. The well-organised mind was more respectable than to run afoul of feelings and all the nonsense that came with them. Sherlock recalls nodding in agreement at his older brother’s words, even if they were a stark contrast to the life of a pirate that he planned for himself at the ripe age of four and a half.
A couple of weeks into their new arrangement, John feels fairly smug after a late-night snog that quickly gave way to Sherlock babbling something during his orgasm that sounded vaguely French. John can't help smiling off and on at the surgery, much to a few of the other doctors' curious eyes.
with Sherlock? As in Sherlock Holmes? The bloke with the head of wild black curls and the cheekbones for centuries? The lanky maniac who vowed in front of the entire assembly of the Met that after Anderson fucked half of the members of their entomology club that he would
“Okay.” John’s smile spread as he leaned back into his chair, picking up his wine glass and taking a sip.
"I came back, didn't I?" John asked softly. As much as he wanted to reach out and stroke Sherlock's face, he wasn't sure that would be wise. Not when he might bite his fingers off for leaving. "Lestrade didn't know where I was. I was setting Seb up for a nice healthy career. He'll need my laptop when all this settles. I don't exactly like to share those locations with the Met."
knees. To taste you, be tasted by you. I want you to take me apart thread by thread and never put me back again. I'd be yours willingly until the day you decide you're done with me."
"Sherlock," John said cautiously, hands stilling and waiting for the outburst he knew would come, "you can't come tonight. If Mycroft can't protect me, and I'm arrested for murder, I won't have your face tied to the crime. Stay with Lestrade, please?"
The room spun slightly as John tilted his head back. Was Sherlock aware just how kissable those freckles on his neck were? Probably. He seemed confident enough in that department. Still, John was only just now becoming aware of that interesting little fact. He'd have to explore that later.
If Lestrade realises, he never lets on. He gives them a few curious glances, especially when both look a little too pink-cheeked, but never confronts them. John is grateful. They’d agreed not to tell anyone about this arrangement, but John isn’t sure he could lie directly to Lestrade.
dead. This has been apparent long before Anderson had created The Empty Hearse club whose members would swap theories and rumors about how the world's only consulting detective found a way to baffle them all.
Sherlock was so close already. He had marvelled at John in the throes of his climax, but the sweetness of his plea for Sherlock to finish inside him was what unravelled what was left of his ability to be stoic through his orgasm.
But perhaps he wasn’t a better person. Perhaps this was as far as Sherlock could evolve, even with someone as bright and beautiful as John by his side. Alone was what Sherlock knew and understood. It fit him; kept him secure and whole. Alone protected him.
He’s caught, suspended in an invisible current, his body being thrown all over the place, but he keeps his eyes closed and his mind fixed firmly on John. Slowly, he begins to feel a tightness in his chest. It’s faint at first, a gentle ache in his sternum. As the water seeps away the pain becomes sharper, rhythmically pounding in his chest. His body lurches as each pang rips through him, and by the time he feels the first crack of his ribs, his eyes shoot open.
“Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!” John groans through gritted teeth, punching the seat cushion next to him. They were getting somewhere, almost. This is the most they have properly communicated in months, and he just blew it. Who knows if things will ever be the same. Hell, who knows if Sherlock will even want him in the flat anymore. ‘
Sherlock felt a heated curl of want creep within him, and he flicked his eyes to the back of the cab driver’s head before looking over to John once more.
He watches me the entire time. Pupils dilated and lips the deepest shade of pink. His mouth on every part of me he can reach. Hands, edges of my ankles, my eyebrows and my neck. Nothing is left untouched, and this is what I hadn’t expected. That John Watson to be this doting of a lover, but how incredible it is to behold. When he comes, it is a dazzling display of lust and relief bathed in a sunny afterglow. He collapses on top of me and remarkably, I climax for a second time.
Keeping eye contact with the man above him, Sherlock reached over to the nightstand and took out a small tube of lubricant and a couple of condoms. He placed a firm hold of the side of John's neck and pulled him down for a smouldering kiss while simultaneously opening the foil wrapper and slipping the condom on John's erection.
John waves away the apology with his free hand. “It gets us out of the flat and stops him from finding more human body parts to put in the fridge. Win-win all around.”
“Didn’t see you as the type to show off your pride by galavanting around without trousers, but there are all types at -- “
I feel the smile he makes against my lips as my trousers are unzipped. His palm is hot on my pants as he rubs in a counterclockwise pattern; my toes already curling.

“You look ridiculous,” Sherlock mutters as he waves a hand in John’s general direction. “Like a fish in a barrel…”
The amount of warning in John’s voice does the trick, and Sherlock stops in his tracks. He looks like he’s readying himself for an argument. He wouldn’t be wrong to prepare.
“Sherlock, are you following dating tips?” John’s brow furrowed when Sherlock hesitated a moment too long. “Have you...have you never done this before?”
“Out,” John replies, and he is suddenly struck by how right the decision is, even if his heart might actually be shattering. “For the night for now...and for good by the end of the week.”
“It’s called The Coffee Pot, and I doubt that either of you needs caffeine to get on with what you’re both actually after.”
Sherlock huffed out a breath and inhaled the scents of home, John, and everything spectacular. John sighed, and then swallowed hard. He shifted his weight so that he leaned heavily on the first bit of wall that caught him.
Sherlock moves, or at least he tries. His limbs are stiff, and he can’t feel his fingertips. What’s worst of all is how quiet it is now. Only the faint noise of falling water fills the room.
“So that’s it then?” he whispered. “You just tell me this and nothing else? No ideas as to where he is now, or hidden dangers? Was he hurt when you last - “
John doesn’t look over because there is nothing to reflect on. Instead, he opens his hand so that Sherlock’s hand intertwines, and their hands fit as perfectly as John always knew they would.
To his great surprise and delight, the milk was drinkable. He even managed to find an unopened packet of biscuits in the cupboard, which meant he could give Sherlock his pain medication now rather than later after he'd gone to the shops.
Sherlock looks up, his expression of muddled confusion. It’s a rarity to see anything like that on Sherlock’s face.
position. And maybe John will, once he gets over the sheer amount of gall that it takes for someone to rummage through his clothing and be demanding answers for anything.
Harry seems to have taken selfies with anyone who was upright and vaguely willing, and John pauses at a slightly blurry shot. The layout of the club jogs his memory — it was
“John’s in the hospital, that’s what’s happened. They’ve been trying to reach you for hours; your phone goes straight to voicemail.”
He considers brushing past it, leaving things there and trusting Sherlock to do whatever he needs to do. Eventually, John holds his hand out, palm up, and Sherlock deduces what he wants without even asking. The detective reaches under the bed, and there’s a harsh clunk as a floorboard is pulled from its place. Before long, a small bag of white powder is placed gently into John’s outstretched hand.
Irene sighs once more, and Sherlock wants to throw things at her now. His frustration and terror eats away at whatever is left of his brain and skin in equal measure.
“Fucking hell, Sherlock. You were fine for months, but suddenly now you can’t think? Why I love you, I don’t kno—” John bites the words off, realising too late what he’s said.
In front of the wall is a long table covered in smaller versions of the flags. They’re mounted on tiny flagpoles, so they stand independently up from the table. All of the colours have started to swim together, and a task that should have been easy has started to become insurmountable. And this is only one section of the shop.
But now, finally, there was a lead. The soil on the base of Jacob Nelson’s shoe could tell them exactly where he had been initially buried. After three victims and no mistakes, the killer had slipped up and given Sherlock enough information to find him. All he had to do was trace the soil.
“I wanted you to feel comfortable. Because — that was a big thing, for you. And I didn’t want you to feel like I didn’t care.”
Sherlock bit his bottom lip hard as John did so much at once. He was all things in time and space, and Sherlock's head spun at all of John's movements. How John's beautiful pupils dilated as he pulled off each layer of clothing and threw them to the floor. Sherlock tried to huff out a plea for John to keep on the socks, but John already smirked before Sherlock had to say it. Because, of course, John knew exactly what turned Sherlock into a pool of melted lava. John was intuitive and ferocious and
Sherlock shrugs his shoulders, but John pointedly ignores him. Instead, he strides over and picks up a pair of blue, purple and pink socks, then grabs a small flag sticker on the shelf right above it.
They were quickly interrupted by Angelo returning John’s cane, then Mrs Hudson’s fussing about the drugs bust. As the rest of the evening had unfurled, Sherlock had forgotten about the smell that had caught his attention.
“I’d say a penny for your thoughts if I wasn’t already aware that what’s inside that head of curls is a goldmine,” Irene purrs. Her face is somewhat still in shadow, but as if she knows that Sherlock needs to see her more clearly, she leans forward, resting her chin on her hands. “Come and sit. We have a lot to go over.”
“Are you okay?” John spoke this time, reaching out and placing his hand on Sherlock’s arm. There was concern in his eyes, the kind that Sherlock wanted to wipe away, but he couldn’t seem to move. His limbs were frozen in place, pressing the sharp edges of his phone into his ear.
Oh, also all this (previous chapters and this one) take place on a Tuesday. They haven't even known each other a full freaking day yet LOL
"You really mean all of that, don't you, about how you feel about him," Greg mused. It wasn't a question but a statement. "Good then. Sherlock deserves to be happy, and I've known him long enough to tell you that he's never looked at anyone the way he looks at you, mate. Like you are the only person in the room….hell, on the planet."
Sherlock wiggles his other hand out of the silk with minimal effort and lets it fall to the mattress. John sinks down next to him, turning to his side and resting his head on his hand so he can watch Sherlock’s face. He's looking up to the ceiling with his eyes open as if lost in thoughts that he can't vocalise yet. John waits until he can't hold it in any longer, even if he isn't sure how Sherlock will take it this time.
were over, and there were no amount of red roses or handwritten letters to save what they weren't meant to have.
It was an eruption of sounds, and Sherlock couldn’t care less if it was himself or John that was making them. He only knew that he needed more. More skin on skin contact. More of John’s fingers digging into his curls and tugging them like a lifeline. More of this. All of this.
John. Shit, how was he going to feel about being in a place like this? This was his bachelor party, after all. A blush creeps up Sherlock’s neck as he circles the room, trying to find John. He eventually spots him, crammed into a small table in the corner.
All of a sudden, his body melts, and before he can think about it, Sherlock slides out of his chair, kneeling at John’s feet. He places his hands on either of the armrests, leaning forward slightly, scanning John’s face. John’s lips part slightly, his pupils dilate, and when Sherlock brushes a finger over his wrists, his pulse has quickened. There’s no lie here.
“Think you should get any of those messages?” John inquired, nodding his head towards Sherlock’s mobile, which had received at least six alerts in as many minutes.
John took the glass and returned a moment later with it full of water. He ignored Sherlock's scowl then pointed to the pain tablets that sat on the coffee table.
“He almost instinctively knew what this place was,” she continues, seemingly taking no notice of Sherlock’s internal struggle. “Started to try and find a way out. I watched him. Partly out of curiosity...the rest out of pity. Eventually, the inevitable happened. As I’m sure you’re aware, Dr Watson has a very hefty left hook.”
When he finishes, panting from the effort, she wraps an arm around his shoulders and pulls him against her. The coconut scent of her shampoo fills his nose, and he’s glad he came. She might infuriate him sometimes, but she’s still his sister.
“Are you calling my relationship with your brother a drug substitution?” John cocks his head, resisting the urge to punch that ridiculously pointed nose. What the hell is Mycroft playing at, comparing him to Sherlock’s addictions? John is not an object for Sherlock to pick up and put down. He’s not some fix — a chemical boost to be moderated and locked. He is a person. An actual human being who can make his own choices. As is Sherlock, for that matter.
Evidently, John has bedded a world-famous detective, then left him alone in the remnants of his body glitter. It’s not a good look, even if John
Then comes the ruffling of that same pile of paper being spread out to read more closely. Sherlock can almost hear John’s brow furrow as he stares at the diagrams and secretive language. All of it meant to entice, and thankfully, it’s working already.
