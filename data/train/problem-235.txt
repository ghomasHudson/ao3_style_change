“I came looking for you. And this. And, oh, God, that’s good. Summer is an aphrodisiac. Part of me doesn’t want it to end but,” John glances over his shoulder, “you do look awful good in those.”
I smile. “Bosch called it a Fenix dragon, for he said I would, one day, rise from my ashes and return to my Eden and my Watson. And so, I did. I suppose you want to see it?”

A 'Wet Pussy' is gin, vodka, peach schnapps, rum, pineapple juice and cranberry juice. Full recipe in the end notes.
“So that’s why I’m so late, Mother,” I teased. “And speaking of paragons of the male physical form in near nude states…”
“Rising from the ashes, flying over the garden. Here’s the fruit. Strawberry. Blackberry. And the animals. Giraffe. Lion. Porcupine. What’s this?”
The three bobbed together, Mary keeping them afloat as Sherlock and John clung to her. With every breath, cocks and tentacle arms sank deeper into bodies until they were a well-knotted trio, shuddering through the first of the night’s many pleasures.
And if he noted any incongruity between the note of feminine domesticity in the blue-and-yellow quilt which was draped over the back of the settee and the decidedly masculine atmosphere of the rest of the room, it did not rise to the level of conscious, much less comment.
Sherlock hummed. “That doesn’t sound too bad right now. These shoes are not as comfortable as they look.”
“I want to visit a friend in Poole this afternoon. I will stay overnight, and she and I will go out sketching tomorrow. Stay with Francisco. Make certain he does not get into any trouble.”
He saw, he realised, and mirrored in his eyes was the same constellation of emotions that churned within my own breast. I wanted to remain in our sweet cocoon. Why did morning have to arrive so soon? Couldn’t we stay here? Couldn’t we?
Holmes listened, and I was surprised to note that his expression didn’t change. Then he opened his mouth and, to my further surprise, poured out his fantasy.
“We’re covered, Boss. Nothing’s going to happen to you. Or if it does, I go, too. Yeah? We’ll be in hell, knotted together, me jizzing all my nice, hot come up in your sweet cunt for an infernal eternity.”
I am aware of the great trust Holmes has placed in me, allowing me to see him thusly, bare, lovely, and he is aware that I love every inch of him, without forced insincerity or selective disregard.
I held open the handkerchief, now half sodden, and then folded it again so that the monogram and the caduceus surrounded by forget-me-nots, meaning, of course, ‘true love,’ might be seen to better advantage.
“Twirling his umbrella! I scarcely credit him with such an act in public. Spring must have got into his veins. Perhaps he’s in love.”
There, standing before Lestrade, was Mycroft Holmes, looking like a million pounds in a three-piece Savile Row suit at three o’clock in the morning in the middle of utter chaos.
Jim pulled away and sniffed derisively. “I’d be a piss poor criminal mastermind if I couldn’t do file things away for later, Seb!
Holmes huffed. “Watson, that it is patently impossible that I don’t want to know something, especially something about which I’ve just inquired.”
“Damn right I will,” I muttered, shoving a hot bit of potato in my maw and setting my sights on that green bowler.
Then lips began to press teasing kisses to her inner thighs in damp trails towards and away from her centre. There was licking and nuzzling at the crease of her thighs and more cunt-wet kisses and then more sucking of her clit, this time with more force, more direct pressure, more urgency.
As soon as they were in the door, Jim was pushing Seb against the wall; Jim’s mouth was on Seb’s upper arm, biting and licking.
For: the Holmes Minor monthly prompt; the first 200 words were written for [community profile] drabble_zone prompt 173 - work like a dog.
“No. But I shall do everything possible to bring Major Eustace to justice for his other crimes. Blackmailers rarely stick to one class of violation.”
“Here you go, my dear. And don’t fret, hot toddy parties, you always run out of lemons and vibrators.”
Five days on the beaches of Spain had been bliss, and now he had one more day to get things done around the flat before he had to go back to work.
I bid the boy ‘good night’ and shifted a well-wrapped gooseberry crumble under my arm. Fatigue and rain made the short walk from dog-cart to cottage door a rather long affair. Best laid plans, or so the poet Burns tells us. The joy of bringing another life safely into the world overwhelmed the bother of being wrenched out of quiet retirement, but my disappointment was not wholly a consequence of the frantic rap on the door and the call without of “Doctor!”
Lestrade receives a box with a pair of red pants and Mycroft's business card. Mystrade. Get-together. Rating: Teen
They don’t often fuck like this anymore, tethered to one another, linked by chain and a pair of rings.
But before all these, before the fortune, the prides, the satisfactions, there is a single moment of unadulterated happiness.
Victor Trevor scrambled out of the water and joined Holmes on the towel. “All of it, head and heart and body,” said he in his usual baritone. “Listen, mate, maybe you don’t see it, but most of the world is moths, born moths, die moths, and spend their mothy lives bumping against screens and lights and windows without knowing why, but you, you sir, are a butterfly. Born to transform, born to inspire poetry, wonder, extraordinary things.”
His pyjamas had been discarded. Most of the bedclothes, too. He was nude with his legs splayed, hips lifting and falling, arm curled behind him.
Mycroft squatted low and rubbed Lestrade’s arms. Without a word, Moriarty extended a pair of snippers. Mycroft cut the ropes and resumed rubbing Lestrade’s arms.
“Sherlock said you were having a spot of trouble at your family estate, and I am familiar with these woods. Or at least the ones some distance to the east…”
He moved very slowly, as if he had all the time in the world. Then he awkwardly applied lubricant to his palm.
I made noises of comfort, not to halt the flow, but rather to reassure him that I loved him, in spite of the tears and because of them.
“No, but I will advise you to spend less time with the Vicar. His jokes are unsettling, his knowledge of history even more so. Oh, your raffle prize…”
I enjoy watching Holmes at work, for while gardening is mere hobby for me, I consider the hives as much my companion’s vocation as solving crimes was. He looks so at home, with his bees, his cone and bellow.
Sherlock planted her feet on the floor and lifted her hips in invitation, but John moved lower; Sherlock turned on her side, giggling, at the wet, tender nuzzling at the backs of her knees. When she turned back and offered herself again, John accepted, lapping greedily, happily at her clit and cunt.
At the end of Sherlock’s gorgeous legs were a pair of gorgeous, freshly—very freshly—manicured feet. The nails had been painted a shimmery pearl colour and each big toe was decorated with a trio of tiny glittery pink seashells.
Holmes heard the cry as he passed the open kitchen window, then felt something connect with his ankle.
“I brought him a toy,” said Jim. “But I forgot it in my pocket. He must’ve gotten tired of waiting for it.”
Mycroft slid a hand down and squeezed the base of his shaft, savouring the wave of pleasure that resulted. He moaned softly and wanted to do it again.
for the August DW Holmes Minor prompt: greatest passion. Maybe not greatest but a favourite thing to write about. POV Watson.
Mycroft hummed and wiggled his arse, which only made Sherlock want to pound him harder, which he did while singing,
John moved very slowly up Sherlock’s legs and with every repetition, the earnestness of his words increased, and by the time he reached Sherlock’s mid-thigh, his body was warm and his mind was astir.
“Well, mine are non-existent,” quipped Lestrade. He clapped a hard hand on Alphonse Unworthy’s shoulder. “It’s going to be an unfinished work of art, Mister Unworthy. You’re coming with us.”
“It was you!” I breathed. “The old beggar was you! I never guessed.” I shook my head, then regretted it as pain momentarily blinded me. I pinched my eyes shut to prevent the flow of tears.
Holmes gave a defeated sigh. Then his gaze became heated and his voice fell to a purr. He let the sheet drop. “You win, but for the moment, I’m exposed to the only gaze that matters. And I’m not wearing pajamas. Or anything else.”
“I only allow myself one glass when I am at work with a needle,” repeated Mrs. Hudson. “Gin and needles don’t mix. It is a lesson I learned as a child from my grandmother.”
The interesting thing about "Two Guns" Miller [a very complicated drink included two kinds of tequila, vermouth, something called 'mole bitters' and something called 'Giffard Pamplemousse' which can't really be a thing, can it?] is that it is supposed to be garnished with a smoking cinnamon stick tied to the outside of the glass like a gun in a holster.
Or was he asking Mycroft up for sex? It was a rather bold suggestion, but then Detective Inspector Lestrade was not a timid creature. He was a fabulous creature, noble…
But Holmes kept his eye on Watson the whole time, while reading and pretending to read and while tackling some of the correspondence jackknifed to the mantelpiece.
Indeed, it seemed that the bed itself, with its sensual design, was demanding that its occupant do nothing else, once the body’s need for slumber had been satisfied.
“Jealous?” Holmes huffed. “Certainly not. I’ve been absorbed in a monograph on various types of moss while you’ve elected to spend this evening ogling—”
She studied his face, watched the mask he’d been wearing all night drop like landslide, exposing a slab of raw emotion.
A hot toddy is a hot beverage made of a liquor (usually brandy, rum, or whiskey), lemon, honey, and spices. There are many recipes.
“I do.” She pinched an abused buttock and a very faint, almost-stifled whimper was heard. “I like naughty little seats who’ve been disciplined a bit before I rest my laurels on them. It looks lithe and lithesome, but trust me, Martha, it’s as strong as an ox. Have you tried the curried chicken?”
And as John’s blood flows into Sherlock’s mouth, Sherlock uses her tongue, her lips and her mouth’s suction as well as her roaming hands, to tease John to climax.
“I was a dupe, Holmes. If you hadn’t arrived, that blighter Newman’s scheme would have worked perfectly. All that talk of a Spanish galleon!”
“The rumour proved truth. Angus had wasted no time in finding the instructions and collecting specimens at the first two sites. I believe his findings on those of the first site will be published,” she coughed, “posthumously.”
Mycroft hummed again and gripped Lestrade’s thighs while Lestrade held Mycroft’s head, gently but firmly, in both hands, and thrust into his mouth.
I had to remind myself I wasn’t Dickens’ Scrooge, and that this wasn’t the Ghost of Christmas Future.
Mycroft matched Sherlock’s rhythm, stroking his own prick, nudging the sunken dildo, and sucking on the soiled lace.
, you do and you were. I was confused but not hallucinating. I'm not sure my imagination could have come up with that anyway.''
The experience had been a positive one enough that Sherlock felt more comfortable asking for what he wanted. He still had many things he wanted to request of John, some recently discovered, others carefully stored in his mind some time ago. John himself hoped he’d hear Sherlock voice a few more of his desires in the future. They both would, in their own time.
The ex-soldier wanted to say something, snap out of it. He knew from the look on the other's face he should try to reassure him, but he couldn't. For Christ sake, he had trouble just breathing. He couldn't focus, he felt dizzy and as if his heart would beat out of his chest.The pain was too great, as was the confusion and the terror of  he didn't even know what. He was shaking now.
''You should. It's not right for you to hold all that in. You know it...weighs on you. I would know. And John, he cares for you. He would never want to hurt you. You'd have nothing to lose. He'll stay by your side, always, like this or as something else, but if you never ask, you'll never know, and you'll never let go. You'll keep on waiting, and hurting and it'll make you angry, bitter. Trust me. "
'' I’m sorry. That shoulder, it’s a bit of a sensitive thing, bad memories and all. I panicked... ''
Nothing had ever sounded as endearing as that one word coming from between Sherlock’s uncertain lips.
Sherlock excused himself a few moments after the doctor's departure, only to return the next morning with a clean shirt for John. It was Mrs. Hudson's idea, not his, but still, the effort to actually go forth with it was greatly appreciated, as was his help to put it, and the arm  sling he'd be stuck in for a few weeks, on. He had witnessed the nurse's speech on the proper care for the wound and the medications to take and all the usual boring discharge explanations. He had even promised to help and keep an eye on John.
''Okay. Hum.'', he clears his throat, '' What I mean, Sherlock, is that'', he takes another breath''I should be the one apologizing'', he pauses, '' for
Sherlock swallowed but didn’t answer. He wasn’t sure what he would be admitting to if he said he did or what John would think he was admitting to. Nor how he would take the admission. The uncertainty closed his throat with fear of the less favorable options.
''Please, Sherlock'', he adds when his maneuver meets resistance, and he gives in, following to the sofa where they sit side by side. Sherlock stares at his hands in his lap. John turns himself so he can look at Sherlock. His knee nudges Sherlock's.
‘’Sherlock’’, he panted between kisses and groans, ‘’we can just keep this up or you can have anything you want but you have to tell me,’’
He came home to an empty flat. John had told him where he was; out for a pint with friends, to his sister's, or somewhere. He didn't really remember, hadn't really been listening. He had been busy planning his night. The important part was that he was somewhere safe. That's all that mattered, really. John would no doubt tell him about it in the morning anyway.
With this reticence he usually had to engaging anything himself, Sherlock greatly surprised John one evening when, not long after the doctor had retired for the night, he joined him. That in itself didn’t surprise him much. They’d often shared beds since they’d become involved, any time Sherlock accepted to sleep really. What wasn’t so usual was Sherlock pressing against him, an unmissable erection poking his lower back through cotton. He licked his lips, his only movement, and he waited.
''You have to understand Dr. Watson that this was a highly sensitive mission. I couldn't risk jeopardising –''
''Happy Christmas, John'', Sherlock says coming back from the kitchen, a bottle of whisky in one hand and a wrapped box in his other, outstretched one.
Frustrated, overwhelmed and his brain proving useless, Sherlock took the rare opportunity of having nothing better to do to go to sleep and let the drunkenness wear off.
A part of Molly always knew that Sherlock loved John, that he was in love with him, in the deepest sense of the expression, but she had truly seen it and made a decision to accept it when Sherlock came to her to help him save John, by endangering everything that, he, Sherlock, was. Even knowing that and believing that John must feel at least just a bit similarly, she also understood why Sherlock had never brought himself to say it, to anyone. She understood his fear and his pain.
''We have known each other for a long time. You know me, you know how I am. I am selfish and blind and rude and obnoxious and many more things alike. You've put up with me for a long time and that's a feat not everybody can achieve. We have been through a lot together and I put you through a lot. I know and I am sorry for all the times I could've hurt you.'', he sighs, ''There are a lot of things I said at your wedding and if you take Mary out of it, I promise none of it was a lie nor an exaggeration. That day was the worst of my life, but it was for you , what you needed, so I bore the pain. All I wanted and still want is your happiness. Never will I let you down and I still hope to be given the opportunity to prove that for a very long time still. If you'll let me. If you've forgiven my mistakes.''
Sherlock nodded and held still for John to come to him. John leaned in, using his hand to pull Sherlock forward, and their lips met. It was tender at first, rather shy, but it grew more confident, greedier. Their lips, their teeth and their tongues were smashing against each other by the time they had to separate, John losing his poor balance, due to his immobilized arm, and gracelessly falling on Sherlock, unbalancing him too. Their heads bumped together. John had one arm stuck under Sherlock and the other, the bad one, between them. This way, he couldn't move. He was stuck there. Unable to push himself back up, he did the only thing he was able to, he laughed. Sherlock quickly joined him, both heartily laughing, until John's shoulder started protesting. Then, Sherlock helped John sit back but didn't let go quite this fast, stealing another, shorter kiss from him, just because he could.
Sherlock only shrugged, but his eyes must have exposed what was truly going on in his mind as the inspector sobered his expression and sat next to him, putting his kind and reassuring father air on.
In the end, Sherlock came out of it on his own. He suddenly sat up, planted both his feet on the floor and downed his tea.
''John, please, stay with me. I need you. Please John! Don't leave me. You're the only one who matters. You need to stay.''
He teased him this way, enjoying every little moan and whimper it drew from him until he suddenly took as much of his length as he could in his mouth, holding the rest tightly in his fist.
''Oh, just dropping by, to see how you are doing, making sure everything is still going well, without any regrettable incident,'' he remarked his tone growing harsher as he pointed a look at Sherlock.
''You were drunk Sherlock. I saw you. I was worried. You do have a history of substance abuse'', he explained haughtily.
Sherlock misses him an it makes no sense because he is here again. Everybody is rejoiced to have him back, Greg on pub nights, Mrs Hudson whenever she pops in upstairs, the Yard whenever he avoids them having to interact with Sherlock, even Mycroft when he sasses him away, though he wouldn't admit it out loud, all but Sherlock.
John thought if Sherlock didn’t come soon, he would. It seemed only the view of Sherlock he had and his own cock rubbing against nothing but his thigh and thin air could be enough.
His voice was quiet, loud enough only for him to hear, but firm. Clear anguish was slipping through his every word.
Sherlock rushed in the ambulance with him, holding his hand all the way to the hospital, letting go of it only when the staff forced him to.
''Ah, Mr. Watson, already awake. That's good, very good.'', he said, taking the charts at the end of the bed and flipping through them. ''You are a very lucky man. The stab wound is mostly superficial. A few minor arteries were reattached but no organs nor any major nerve endings were touched, so there shouldn’t be any lasting damage. It mostly just hurts a lot. We'll keep an eye on you for another 24 hours but I'm afraid after that we'll have to drug you up and let you go home with orders to rest. It should all heal on it's own. How does that sound?''
A silence filled the room as Molly continued her task and left Sherlock some space, to see if he would prompt her further. As he tried to collect his thoughts and put them in words, she decided to help him and herself.
''There was an event that stood out... He punched someone, for me. I think it was for me. That's what he seemed to be explaining afterwards.''
''The visits are technically over and he needs rest, but I think you'll be able to see him for a few minutes if you want to, though he probably won't be awake yet''
Sherlock wasn’t one to be very demonstrative nor verbal about his desires. John thought it was due to some lingering embarrassment about the needs and wants of his body, and tried to read him as best as he could. Of course, his best could still not always be accurate. To avoid any hurt, John always double checked that everything he did was okay with Sherlock. He knew it sometimes frustrated the younger man who might think him slightly paranoid but he was not about to risk hurting him on account of timidity.
, Sherlock. And I mean it. So, '' he pauses again, then continues, almost in a whisper ''Of course, I forgive you. Did, a long time ago.''
''I won't apologize to him'', John said suddenly as Sherlock reappeared, all humor gone from his voice .
John slid his hand higher to rest on Sherlock’s neck, his thumb gently rubbing his cheek. He was beautiful like this, leaning in his touch.
Sherlock complied. John was in his space, holding his wrists lightly and smiling at him, the softest smile he'd ever seen on his features. When their eyes met, John offered him the plain, simple truth.
''Well, it was bound to happen, wasn't it? With all your crazy experiments and flouncing around.''  John tries, standing to put the pieces on the table.
''Wait. You knew about that?'', John, who had kept himself out of their conversation, suddenly asked, shifting the attention in his direction.
''I supposes that can come with the gift...just this once '', he exclaims, still taking it with him to the kitchen.
He was feeling fuzzy and out of control. Thoughts, memories and emotions came jumbled together, without him being able to reign any in. The room was spinning. He wanted to throw up. He wanted to hide. He wanted to be heard.  He wanted to sleep.   He wanted to be held. He wanted John.
He couldn't answer him, tell him he would be alright, not to worry. He was starting to grow weak, affected by the pain and the shock, and so many things he just couldn’t process right now. He squeezed Sherlock's shoulder hard and slid his hand to his cheek. He seemed so afraid, so vulnerable, but John couldn't help him. He swallowed hard and let his hand back down. Staying awake was proving difficult at the moment. He heard sirens approaching. It would all be fine, someone would be able to tell Sherlock. He shut his eyes, it wasn't like he could see all that well anyway. He could still faintly hear Sherlock's voice, as if he were underwater.
Sherlock turned them over, pulling John over him. He kissed him sloppily, open-mouthed, thrusting his tongue between his lips to lick and suck at his. He grabbed the back of his head, trying to get deeper into his mouth.
He was gorgeous and so arousing like this, unguarded, pure desire written on his features. John was eager to have him naked and under his hands but he didn’t dare break the spell that somehow let him ask and reach for what he wanted. He instead let his own desires show throughout his face and body, letting Sherlock do as he pleased with the knowledge he got of it.
‘’Hmm, got all you wanted?’’, he purred, wiping his hand on the sheets behind him, when he got back to himself.
When John had said he wasn't good with ''that sort of thing'' he had meant it. He felt deeply for Sherlock and his aches. He ached with him, but didn't know how to deal with it. It would just build inside. He was touched that Sherlock had shared so much with him, even if he might not have meant to, but, now, the knowledge of Sherlock's hurt, past and present, was too much for him to properly deal with. He wanted to be the kind of friend who could console him and help him through but all he could manage was feel rage towards everyone and everything that had hurt him, including himself.
John never thought the delinquent they were after would actually do it. They never had the guts. This one had an advantage though; he panicked. The ex-soldier employed his usual tactics. He tried talking him into dropping the weapon, approaching him slowly, trying to look as non-threatening as he could. Then, suddenly, he launched himself at the man to disarm him. Often, the surprise would do most of the job, making his opponents drop whatever they were holding and he'd only wrestle them to make sure they couldn't get their hands back on it.
This was certainly true. He did care for his younger brother, always had, no matter how insufferable he could be and how much trouble he could cause. In the end, he did try to see him in as less pain as possible, be it self inflicted or otherwise, but caring for Sherlock Holmes was not easy, especially not when you were (in his eyes) his nosey and overbearing brother. And try as he might, there were things Mycroft could not sacrifice, not even for his brother nor himself. One had to be detached about some things when one defended the security of one or  more nations. This did not mean, however much he liked to pretend, that he didn't care and couldn't hurt, at least where it concerned his baby brother.
''I know. You can take care of yourself, well, except for eating and sleeping'' he glanced at him playfully, smirking ''You can work through the pain and all. I just wish you didn't have to. You deserve better. If it were only up to me...''
''Mmh'', Sherlock opens his eyes, John staying in his space, ''Yes. I suppose it could be a sufficient incentive, though we'd need further experimentation to get a conclusive answer''.
He awoke sometime later, his mind still somewhat scrambled. He hadn't really slept, just nodded off a few times as the room spun unpleasantly. He got up and out of his room, annoyed, bumped in a nearby wall on his way to the fridge. He looked at its inside for a while didn't find anything  he wanted and slammed its door shut.
Sherlock let his head fall on the offered shoulder and, maybe, the warmth of another living being, even if not the one he wished for, unlocked something in his chest and, maybe, a few tears were let out.
There was a silence. Sherlock looked uncomfortable, even slightly apprehensive of what John would say next. He didn't dare look at him, he always could read way too much in his face and at that moment he thought it might be better not to know.
His mischievousness is gone; the easy jokes, the inappropriate grins, the gentle teasing, it's all gone. His warmth is gone.
He shed down his own bottoms, exposing himself, somewhat faster than he had John’s. He didn’t leave him much time to appreciate the view before he was hovering over him again, kissing him roughly and rearranging himself so both their cocks were aligned. They groaned lowly at the first contact and again as Sherlock thrusted them tighter together, creating light friction, driving them both mad with want.
Sherlock nuzzled John’s neck, holding his torso tightly against himself and sighed in contentment as his blogger rubbed circles in his back and shoulders.
All is silent when he gets to Sherlock in the kitchen. He's crouching with pieces of broken dishware in his hands.
John's reflex when angry had always been to punch things; tables, walls, lockers and, sometimes, people, in this specific case,  Mycroft Holmes. He did it without thinking about it. It were as if his arm had had a mind of it's own but feeling exactly what all the rest of him had been feeling, for years, every time someone had hurt Sherlock. The fog of anger partially cleared his brain and he started thinking again, if not too clearly, as soon as his fist fell back to his side.
''Yes.'',  Sherlock murmured strangely touched and still trying to analyse all that had just been said.
He made it, humming softly, before setting it on the low table in front of their couch. He sat and patted the space next to him for Sherlock to sit. He fidgeted a bit, as if unsure of what he wanted to do, looked at the way leading to the privacy of his bedroom, but obliged anyway.
''No. I don't know'', he swallowed, ''Why do people do this John? Why do they act like it's fun. It's not. I don't feel well...Like I'm going to explode.'', he made a gesture to his chest, tightening his fist over it, ''like I'll lose control over myself. I don't like it John.'' He swallowed again, more strained this time. ''I'm scared''
Sherlock slipped two fingers of each hand under the elastic of John’s pajama bottoms. He looked up at him, seeking confirmation, getting an eager nod for answer. He slid them down, the elastic catching briefly on his cock as he lifted his hips off the bed. The fabric thrown down the bed, Sherlock kneeled just over John’s knees, observing him, licking his lips and palming himself at the view.
''I'm sorry Sherlock. I really am. It's just...He's your brother! He should be looking after you, not hurting you! The others...They're idiots. They're blind. They don't know you, but if at least him could...I don't know. And after last night...'' He sighed. ''You shouldn't have to be hurt like that.''
Hearing the fuss and the worrying silence that had ensued, and knowing for a fact they were not alone in their flat, Mrs Hudson had come up to check on her boys.
'' If you meant it, about needing me, it's okay, you know, and about being, uh, the only that matters. You’re very unique to me too. I mean, our relationship, it’s not something I would have with anyone else. It’s special to you only, because you’re...special, to me, I guess. I’m not very articulate. It’s a bit hard. Um, I think what I really want to say is, I know you said you were married to your work, but if you somehow changed your mind, well, that’s okay too. ''
'' You. I want you. I want to be with you. I want you to be with me, no one else, just me. I’m tired of having you always so close to me but always getting snatched away. It’s so unfair! I want to be the one to snatch you away from others. I want to be the one you come home to, really come home to. I want to be home to you. ''He stopped himself, worry and self-consciousness making its way through his features.'' Is it too much? ''
, he thought but didn't say.  He sighed, shaking his head once. '' When I know someone who could have protected you, saved you that, didn't, well, I get angry. I stop thinking. I lose my temper...You know how I am. '' He lowered his head and his voice as he said that last sentence.
Sherlock loves him more than he ever has before and wants him, to be with him more than he's ever wanted anything, but John won't even give him his friendship back nor his forgiveness. It hurts, but Sherlock tries to hide it. He shouldn't and can't afford to add to the burden he is on John.
Sherlock’s orgasm luckily did hit him first. He held him through it, but switched his hand to his own cock after it seemed the last spurt had come out, stroking himself roughly but efficiently until his cum joined Sherlock’s in his fist.
''You-. You already have, Sherlock. It's-. I - .'', he takes a steadying breath, ''Let's get somewhere comfier first, yeah?''
''You're not just talking about the mug anymore are you?'', John asks sadly and Sherlock gestures no in a small movement of his head, not meeting his eyes, but it's too late. He showed his heart there and can't reign it back in, hidden, safe.
He waited, cautiously eyeing Sherlock, waiting for something that would give his emotional state away. Usually, that would be when he'd make a remark about the Yard’s incompetence and insult them all, explaining how each of them had missed different and so obvious things. But nothing came.
''Okay...'' John was careful now, mindful of anything his body or words could communicate. he didn't want to inadvertently scare or insult Sherlock back into silence. This was important. He focused all of his attention on Sherlock, on listening to him and reading him.
They made him fill in a few papers and then led him to John's room. Lestrade had already taken his leave. As the doctor had warned, he was deep asleep but Sherlock didn't mind. He was content to just observe him, his chest steadily rising and falling with each breath, reassuring him that he was still there. He hadn't gone.
They sat on the edge of the bed and he kept his grip around the detective who leaned on him, his face resting on the top of his shoulder. He just breathed there for a while and John thought he'd fallen asleep until he started hearing mumblings. His voice steadily grew loud enough for him to hear. He was talking about Serbia, about all the other countries he'd found himself in during those two forsaken years, about the physical hurt, about the emotional hurt, about the longing, about the helplessness, and about the hope and the sense of mission that had kept him going.
Sherlock looks lost in thoughts as he stares at the broken pieces. John lowers himself at his level to try and get his attention.
''And you have experience with relationships and people, in general? At least more than I do. Correct?''
The DI let out a sigh of relief but promptly said ''Knew it'' nudging Sherlock, who had regained some life in his features but still didn't look completely like himself.
So Sherlock found himself in a shabby little pub on the the docks drinking with and indulging him. He got spectacularly drunk, but still managed to register anything that could be useful and file it in his mind palace, somewhere he could analyze it, later, when he would be fit. Much, much, later.
Sherlock found himself reaching out to Molly Hooper. She was a scientist, she had experience with relationships and most of all she was the least likely to make fun of him for what he was about to ask. She had also shown a great understanding of him and had been of undeniable help in the past.
One of the specific target of that rage, of course, had to pay them a visit that very morning, showing up, unannounced and uninvited, in their living room.
''Yeh, um, that too'', he swallows, ''I'm grateful that you let me come back here. Home''. This time, it's John's breath that goes shaky and he clenches his hand into a fist, not the one on Sherlock, but he still notices. This, at least, makes him look at John.
''Mycroft what are you doing here?'', his younger brother had demanded in that particular annoyed tone  he reserved only for him.
He talked and talked and talked, explaining his thoughts and opinions and feelings about it all, with a few occasional dry sobs, until he did fall asleep and John held him through it all, his heart constricting with every word of hurt, and guilt building in himself. It was long after he had fallen asleep and his muscles started cramping that he could finally let go of him to let him lie down to go to his own room for what little of the night was left.
They eat until they couldn't possibly eat even a single bite more, then settle in their chairs, close to the warm fire.
Days of silence followed Sherlock's trip to St Bart's. He was thinking but not sulking. Whatever he was thinking about he made sure to do it always in John's presence. Every time, John came downstairs, Sherlock would come out of his room and sit with him, in the kitchen or the living room, according to where John himself was. Then he'd stay with him until the day would end and they'd both go back to their rooms, never uttering a word.  John would deposit food and drinks in front of him and sometimes, when he'd look after paying attention to something else for a while, there'd be small bites and sips missing. Days flowed into each other and John kept on waiting for Sherlock to come out of his thoughts or for a case to drag him out of them.
''Oh dear, did John do this? I heard yelling and he's got quite a temper. He's a good man on the inside he just has those little things he needs to work on, but don't we all? Though, something like this, it's more-'', she blabbered on.
John rearranged himself on his side so he was pillowing Sherlock’s head with an arm, holding him close, and looking straight into his eyes. He kissed him softly as he reached with his free hand for his erection, then some more as he stroked him slowly, spit and pre-come serving as lube. He freed his lips when he accelerated his rhythm, giving his cock firmer and faster tugs, his name pooling out of Sherlock’s lips and their gazes locked into each other’s.
That's not how it went this time. As he reached the man, John felt a punch-like sensation on his shoulder but stayed focused on trying to locate the knife. After a bout of wrestling, it was obvious it was already out of both their reach so he pushed himself back on his feet, ready to spin his opponent around and handcuff him. The other followed. As soon as he was back up, he threw a wide-eyed look at him and ran as if he had seen the ghost of his evil mother. John was about to set after him when he heard Sherlock scream his name, more distressed than the bark he'd normally use to make him follow.  When he turned to see what was wrong, he only saw horror on his face.
Sherlock's fingertips were as thorough as his eyes. He touched lightly, he touched gently, but he touched every ridge and valley at least twice.
John buried his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, nibbling and nipping the delicate skin as he kneaded the round mounds of flesh filling his palms. “And you did it all in those Hallowe’en heels. Fuck.”
“Not for your wanton hole. But for the pleasure of sinking my cock in John Watson’s, there isn’t much I wouldn’t do, including prostituting my own brother’s very fuckable mouth.”
“’Someone’s crumpled ‘er face!’” imitated Holmes in the voice of the country lad who’d stuck his own face in the viewing window at the moment I had. “No, I knew it was a lifeless human inside that horrible shell.”
“During the heat itself? No. I tend to say extraordinary things for the value of extraordinary that is ridiculously pathetic. Granted, I haven’t had a proper heat in a while.”
There are, of course, thousands of possibilities, thin strings fanning out like single-strand tendrils.
When Mycroft was down to his trousers, he went to the antique wardrobe and opened the left side door. On the inside of the door was a full-length mirror.
She was a dark-haired lady of elegant dress and imperial manner who filled the doorway and addressed Lomax directly in Spanish.
“Thank you for returning it. I apologise. Lending a book, then immediately asking for it back, it’s all terribly embarrassing.”
By my second cup of tea, I’d decided acrobat was the most likely candidate. After all, how many cases had Holmes investigated where the culprit’s physical prowess proved a vital clue? The skill required to scale a wall, for example.
John was still sitting at the foot of Sherlock’s bed and still wearing the jumper with the scene of grinning cats, a destroyed tree, and a cheery ‘Have Yourself a Meow-y Little Christmas!”
That brought a faint pink to his cheeks, but he kept his eyes and his gun trained on me while his other hand packed up the ring and slipped the tin box in his pocket. “There are people who want this bauble very badly, want it so badly that they are willing to kill for it.”
He laughed. “Your Solomon-siring days are over, my good man, when Mrs. Hudson sees what you’ve done to the new rug!”
Holmes produced a knife and carefully broke the seal while I held the pumpkin. He lifted the top of the stem. Then, he reached in and pulled something out.
Jim’s eye caught the flicker at the window, and what happened next happened very quickly and very quietly.
Sally hummed and brushed her lips across Stella’s temple, where damp hair met moist skin. “Losing’s worth the aftercare?”
“I believe you are doing the sodding,” teased Holmes. “I am merely the sodded.” He wriggled his bottom.
I wanted very much that your last memory of me to be of me smiling, waving good-bye, then returning to my garden. Remember my warmth, not this coldness that grips me and will not let go. Remember my voice calling out, strong, not this horrid gurgling. Remember my colour, not my greyness.
“…and once again, Mister Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to examining those interesting little problems which the complex life of London so plentifully presents.”
“I know, I know, but I can smell him through the door, and I’m going to a bit crazy worrying about him. Is he okay?”
“I just thought I’d whip something up,” said Mycroft without looking up from the contents of the bowl he was frantically stirring.
Whilst Holmes was about his bees, I’d taken to the garden, flowers as well as vegetables. As an offshoot, I’d also begun to amuse myself by assembling bits of flora and debris into whimsical miniatures. Fairy carpentry Holmes called it when he chanced upon my hobby.
“I had this in yesterday. Just in case. Don’t suppose I need it now.” She snapped it closed and shot them each a glance.
“Your arse, Sherlock. Your cock. Everything in between. You love being tongue-fucked. And sucked off. And when I tease the bit in-between without touching either end.”
John’s sitting, waiting, when Sherlock finally comes home. An untouched cup of PG Tips is resting on the table beside John’s armchair.
as chair every year because, well,” he blushed, “I’m competent. This is my reward.” He held up a pumpkin. “I’m going home to carve it.”
John felt the weight of Sherlock’s body, uncommonly light, and the affectionate nuzzling at his nape, uncommonly heavy. John listened to Sherlock’s breath, uncommonly ragged and uncommonly sexy in his ear, and a thought coalesced.
“No, I want to be fucked today.” Jim released the gun, and Seb twisted away and returned the gun to its place. Then he twined his fingers in Jim’s.
“Well, I suppose the grass is always greener, but today I’d take being cold over sweating through my back-up, back-up shirt and Donovan choosing to stand down-wind from me—rather than the corpse—at a crime scene!”
hit me with your best pot?'', he teases, handing proudly his brand new mug to Sherlock who rolls his eyes affectionately.
''He's going to be fine Sherlock. He's a fighter. You know it. You know him. He wouldn't leave you.''
His emotions must have been written all over him as a nurse gently took Sherlock by the arm and helped him sit in the waiting room. He was helpless. He didn't know what to do with himself. He was paralyzed by too many too strong emotions all flooding him at once. They were like a waterfall hiding and blocking the entrance to his mind palace.
Sherlock  tried to think fast, assess what could be happening to John, what could be his injuries, what he should do:
John would normally get angry, as Sherlock had no reason to get pissy at him like that, but his expression told him he shouldn't. He didn't look well, and not in an ''I'm about to throw up'' way, but more in a ''something I do not understand is happening and it is confusing and hurts'' way.
Upon hearing her voice the older Holmes cursed inwardly and put on his most exasperated expression. He still turned towards her and remembered that insulting her for any reason might result in aggravating his already sensitive nose.
in which 221 is egged by young vandals just as Sherlock moves in and Mrs. Hudson calls the Men in Kilts cleaning service to help clean up the damage.
As a rule, Greg didn’t waste a lot of time on whys. ‘Just the facts, ma’am’ was the only way to survive the job and you couldn’t just switch it off at the end of the day. But even he knew that the why of this was somewhere in that word.
“Have you been a naughty boy, Jimmy? I want to see Papa Seb here put you over his knee and give you the spanking you so richly deserve.”
“And you shall have them, my beloved,” he replied with bow and a gallant kiss of my gloved hand. “Mrs. Hudson is visiting her sister, and we are at liberty to be…”
“Thanks to you, my dear boys. The board has voted: you’re all invited to play the role of fairies next year, especially the Detective Inspector.”
“Daddy, please.” A turn, and Mycroft stared at the arse he’d been holding, cheeks spread, hole winking, “put your lolly in me. Let me make you feel good.”
I suppose that ever since Aunt Ada died, I have been worried that something like this would happen,” said Madeline with a sniff into her delicate handkerchief. “A sense of foreboding, you understand?”
“Yeah, well, the Rat King is going to be like me watching porn and be sorely disappointed because I am not able to keep it up, Sherlock. Not like this.”
Jim chuckled. “He’s the one going to need the therapy when he realises one narrow fellow slipped away into his office, Molly. But don’t fret, I’ve got your therapy right here.” He put her nipple in his mouth and teased it with his tongue.
“Yes, but not before all of the Yard got to see you in your camel-coloured wool dressing gown and dark mauve pajamas with the fleur-de-lis print. You looked regal.”
He took one of her hands. “Later this?” he asked softly and licked her palm. “Or maybe this?” He took her index finger and suckled it. “Or this?” He brought all her fingertips together and rubbed his lips against them. Then he brought his mouth back to her palm, tracing the lines with the tip of tongue.
He walks straight for a table near the windows, where a gorgeous blonde is sitting opposite someone. John can’t follow the conversation – he resolves to learn how to lip read – but Sherlock says something, the woman says something…

For a moment, I pretended I didn’t see it, the subtle shift, the interjection of filaments of lighter grey and other diluted hues into the scene. I stubbornly told myself it was still night, that I had the luxury of lying beside my lover and drinking in his beauty with all my senses for longer, as long as I wished.
“Only ‘be your most idiotic’ day at the Yard!” cried Sherlock, then his expression softened. “I missed you.”
Sherlock stepped behind John and flapped his wings, then two of his tentacles slipped out of their moorings and wound their way through the drape of John’s trousers.
“The Disappearance of the Second Stain.” Case solved by Mrs. Hudson with tonic water and gentle blotting.
Not one of the many offices of my colourful life, except, perhaps, the brief one of husband, has promoted sound sleeping. Son of an angry drunk, medical student, soldier, invalid, doctor, widow, I was destined to spend my nights slumbering fitfully and waking often.
“It was. That is why it took so long to uncover. I dare not make my presence known in the slightest or the whole scheme would have been shut down in an instant.”
At the word, Irene’s head lifted for a moment. Kate caught it in her hands before it sank back into the pillow.
“Not funny, I know, but since you were, until moments ago, a wet pussy, I thought you might find it mildly amusing.”
“Probably from that ordinary detective’s common insect costume. I bumped into him at the fancy dress shop today.”
“Yes, ma’am,” said Bessie. She gave an obedient nod, but her eyes wandered nervously to the stairs and the bells on the wall.
Sherlock’s pupils blew black. “Commencing with the muscle that seems to be flexing of its own accord at this moment.”
“He won’t let you top him, even with the prize of having his cock sucked by me while you do it.” Sherlock unbuckled Mycroft’s belt and opened his trousers.
Kate's instructions lead her to a cabin in a frozen corner of the world. Kate/Irene. D/s roles. Fingering.
Cup met saucer, but just as I rose, morning light struck the gold disc and danced across the room, creating the illusion of a cascade of sparkling snow flurries.
Victoria Station was now witness to my escape, not my deliberation. As the porter huffed and glanced at the waiting train and the clock, I dropped my head. A fine cloth brushed my cheek.
“But that brother of his. He got onto us. I don’t know what he told you about what happened in that train compartment, but Eddie never once considered going straight, giving up our life; that was all his stupid brother’s fantasy. His brother suspected just how close we were. He’d never used it before on us, but he did then. By the time the bastard had done spewing his poison, Eddie had shucked out of his doll’s shell. He threw himself into my arms and kissed me. 'Sorry, love,' he whispered as he lifted my revolver and turned it on his brother. Takin’ people’s money is one thing, shootin’ your brother in cold blood, no matter what kind of bastard he is, is another. I tried to get between ‘em, but the gun went off and down Eddie fell. Well, the rest you probably know. I didn’t even say good-bye.” MacCoy shrugged and addressed the bottom of the empty glass. “My beautiful boy. My wicked boy. We knew it, though. We’d said it many a time. Chaps like us never get a dotage.”

Mycroft paused his sucking to hum around Lestrade’s cock, sending a current of delicious electricity though Lestrade’s body.
“Insufferable as usual. He left me his card.” Sherlock was sitting in his armchair, looking at his mobile.
“She is a beauty and I do adore her and some fine spring day, when I have her top off and she’s purring like a kitten, I want to take you out for a nice, long drive in the country, Mister Holmes.”
“I am a well-travelled man. Your fascination is not as unusual as you suspect. It does not repulse me. In fact,” I nodded, “join me beneath that willow and you can touch—and be touched—to your heart’s desire. Or is observation your only fancy?”
“The Holmes brothers are being especially meddlesome. I need to plan something big and I plan big better when you’re here.”
His mouth was full of cock in seconds, pressed to his forehead the rucked miniskirt, around his face, legs encased in fishnet stockings.

An Easter egg-hunt martini is a vodka martini with egg white and milk and you are supposed to decorate it like an Easter egg with strawberry and raspberry puree.
John glanced at Mycroft’s suit. The floor of a car was no match for something that looked like a country tweed but probably cost more than his army pension.
They sigh and melt into each other, fitting angles and planes together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. They move together, nuzzling necks and armpits, brushing lips across temples and cheeks and chins. They rise and fall, like the tide, or perhaps, more like a curious seabird gliding upon a salty sun-soaked breeze.
“A car will be waiting at the end of your shift to take you wherever you wish to go, including your home or mine.”
Mycroft smoothed a hand down the front of his suit, the suit that had been chosen from his entire wardrobe for this very moment.
“Really? That’s unfortunate. You know, Sebbie, why wait? The way you’re looking, I could go right now. Come here and let me…”
“Oh, oh,” cried Alphonse Unworthy, the first notes of distress in his voice since we had arrived. “Maddie? Maddie! Will you see that my last missive reaches the world?” he pleaded. “My final letter, from an artist’s heart to the earth which feeds him?”
The exercise did nothing to ease my condition for in the hour that passed, I thought of little but Holmes’s profile in that dark grey tweed suit that I adored and his sonorous baritone he made his deductions, wrapping the whole baffling case up like a pretty Christmas gift in a shop window.
The following night, Holmes and I were back in Baker Street, watching the fire, drinking whiskey-and-sodas, each seemingly lost in his own thoughts.
“No guests at all, except Doctor Watson who returned an ID and an umbrella that Sherlock had stolen.”
“You needn’t fret any longer, Mrs. Hudson. I’m done with it,” declared Sherlock. “I have proved without a doubt that Yoshiko’s stalker could, in fact, have lived inside a chair of those proportions. I have called the removal men. They will be here today to take it away.”
Mister Holmes proved apt at pastry-making, and Doctor Watson chopped onions like he’d been doing it all his life. He also seasoned and prepared the meat after a brief orientation by Mrs. Hudson as to the peculiarities of her stove.
They slowed their movements, kissing more languidly and rubbing against one another with less frenzy.
“What shall we do with it, Watson?” asked Holmes when he had removed the figure, statue, ornament, I was not, and am still not, certain what to call it, from a nest of cotton wool.
Holmes poured tea. Watson poured coffee. Bessie brought a cup of hot cocoa and went as red as the strawberry jam when she was thanked gallantly in Spanish.
Mycroft catches up with Lestrade while the latter's on the way home from a sci-fi film festival. Mystrade. Rating: Teen for a bit of public frottage and talking about sex.
John remained on the step—his twitching cock was at the level of Sherlock’s mouth—but turned to present Sherlock his posterior.
“Curious thing. On my way here, I spotted Murray, the winner of the event, walking with his prize, a gold statuette, under his arm. I stopped to offer him a ride, but he said he had no money, just a return ticket to Blackburn, and was planning to walk the streets until his train left. Well, that didn’t seem right at all, so I took him to Motley’s and got him a room. We had a chat in the bar. He’d said he was going to sell his prize, and I recommended against it. I suggested he open a gymnasium in his hometown and use the trophy as advertising.”
“Twelve. So after the kitchen is done, and my boots are done, then you, my beautiful brat, are going to be done.”
Was it Irene’s imagination or did the hand on the neck tighten its grip? Impossible to tell from the distance; nevertheless, Irene squeezed and heard a choked sigh of feminine pleasure.
Holmes seemed not to hear, tapping the edge of the postcard to his lips. “Andrew received a postcard from Amaryllis the same day his twin brother Albert left for Peru.”
As I pass back through the hidden door, I itch and burn. My skin, my whole being feels constricting, confining.
“Wow! Thanks!” She took the drink from him and had a long draw from the green straw. “Nice. I’ve been wanting to try these. Uh, I’m afraid I’m a bit busy. I had an unexpected delay earlier and I’m behind.”
I have left Shaw’s words across Watson’s chest, and when he wakes, I shall tell him, again: that I am his, for now and for always, and no insect—no matter how clever or industrious or evolved—need remind of the wisdom of my heart.
“That’s not how this works, Irene, remember?” Molly holds up the riding crop. “I’ve still got this, unless you safeword, of course.” She tilts her head and smiles.
“Yeah, love that sinister bend to the left, Sherly. As human cocks go, this one’s swell—and swelling! Ha, ha! I crack myself up sometimes!”
Holmes’s words were the first he’d spoken that day. After perfunctory nods, we’d drunk our morning tea, smoked our morning pipes, and perused our morning newspapers in silence. Then he’d set about an experiment and I’d feigned interest in a novel, expecting to doze. In those days, I was extremely lazy and slept fitfully most nights.
“See, Watson? I told you there weren’t any biscuits in that tin,” said Holmes as he extricated himself from beneath the kitchen table.
I was, literally, his fixed point in the darkness, holding the umbrella that guarded the brightest of the torches.
I lick, in overlapping swathes, from the cleft of Watson’s arse to the nape of his neck, following his spine as a boat follows a winding river.
They caressed each other’s neck and shoulders and chest, but looking down, they could barely see Sherlock for the enormous blue wings.
“I presume you charge for your art, Miss Mohels. Some might call that a trade,” remarked the prosecutor dryly.
“That’s why you keep them under fourteen layers of clothing. You’re so sensitive. Keep your eyes closed. I’m sucking ‘em. Wet, hot, just what you need. Let me hear you. Tell me what you need, My.”
“It’s obvious, John, well, obvious to anyone who’s mind isn’t a vacant lot, that the killer must be—“
Mycroft wants to show off a liquor in his tantalus, but there's a problem. Mystrade. Johnlock Silly crack. No smut.
“Watson.” He cut me off with a raised hand. “You will marry a fine woman someday and grow old with children and grandchildren surrounding you.”
“I am close, but Gregory, it would be selfish, not to say unchivalrous, for me to invite you to dinner…”
Moriarty threw off the bedclothes and sat up, swinging his feet to the floor and slipping off his drawers. Then the figure was kneeling before him, dragging his tongue from base to head, then teasing along the weeping slit.
I had no plans to pause in my toil, but as I opened the door, I caught sight of Holmes looking at me, and the heat in his eyes rivaled that measured by the mercury.
“You look wonderful. You know it does something to me, and my eight friends, when you strut about shirtless.”

Holmes beamed as I punctuated my statement with a kiss to his temple, but his expression reverted to its original censorious.
“Then it’s time to break out the toys, isn’t it?” said Irene. “After I have a taste, of course. Molly, open your legs for me, love. Let me suckle that pretty clit.”

Lestrade blinked, allowing the words to settle into his brain. Then he blinked again. Then he got up and closed the door, and, when he returned to his desk, said,
“Neither am I.” Sherlock’s hands snaked round and fondled John’s cock. “Oh, yes,” he breathed, “you’re as hung as I deduced.”
“Promise what?” But John knew. “All right. I promise to read your monograph on glitter if you let me take you home right now and worship you properly.”
Holmes silenced Watson with a kiss. Then he pulled away and laced his fingers in Watson’s. “Why don’t we return to the cottage and I’ll allow you give me a demonstration of just how steady your hands can be?”
“Holmes. I’ve got to go. I don’t want to leave you, but I can’t stay, and you can’t come with me. You see that, don’t you?”
“I did catch the eye of this waiter.” Seb rested his hands on the back of a head. “He was definitely giving me his attention.”
“I don’t photosynthesise, if that’s what you’re asking,” replied Mycroft. “But you can be forgiven the misconception given the only thing you’ve ever seen me swallow.”
“Cecaelia Cove isn’t the easiest place to find, Mary,” said John as he peeled off his pants, “and we can’t exactly ask for directions. ‘Oh, have you see a lovely lady who seems to not have her hands full at all?”
. The tasty Royal Flush is Crown Royal, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, and cranberry juice. Full recipe in the end notes.
John stepped in front of the toilet, unfastened his jeans, and pulled out his cock, but something made him hesitate.
“Lancelot was insistent on returning the book he borrowed before he was taken into police custody, and when I noticed the nameplate of the library on the inside, I took it as a sign. I never waste an opportunity to pay you a visit during the day, and, who knows, the judge may take it into consideration at Lancelot’s sentencing.”
“I know you’re only etched on glass, that you’re only green because the poison’s green, that is, until it’s cloudy and thick and ready for the imbibing. ‘I take mine with sugar!’ Of course, you do. So do I. I’m a doctor who can’t heal, a soldier who can’t fight, nothing for it, but to—”
“I understand what it is to take extreme measures to remedy the boredom of life. But he helped himself to my penknife, a gift from my grandmother which she’d once used to slit the throat of Barbary pirate, and I advised him in no uncertain terms that I would reclaim it one day.”
“Immensely,” said Sherlock, his voice muffled by lace and flesh and lust. He bit at the flesh of John’s buttocks each in turn and groaned.
“I’m not. I didn’t even know this book existed. And, I’m not a Lord, but if you fancy being seduced by a goblin…”
“You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb.”
“I mean, coffee, with a bit of my Irish in it,” said Moriarty, grinning and nodding at his own prick.
It wasn’t until Seb felt that curious change, the expansion and lengthening of his cock which never ceased to thrill and disturb, that he eased the gun out of Jim’s mouth and set it on the bedside table.
