“Hey. I understand now but Cas… I won’t lie. We were a mess without you, you don’t understand how much Jack needs you. How much I need you. You going off like that-” Dean exhales averting his gaze. but Cas grabs his cheeks. Forcing Dean to look at him “I will spend the rest of my life proving to you that I will never leave you. That as much as you need me, I need you.”
Dean looks at him curiously, watching Jack look at the caller ID and hesitate about answering it.
Jack turns seeing him standing there “Oh right. He knows. Everything.”
He has the selfie of the two of them from months ago but also some sneaky photos that aren’t enough to be creepy. Ones where Cas is standing in his trenchcoat looking over a field with an orange-colored sky in the background, another one of him in a plaid shirt reading over a book in the bunker's library, and Dean’s favorite, Cas relaxed in a recliner in the Dean cave with blue light cast over him. Dean’s positive Cas saw him take that photo but didn’t bother to call him out for it, almost posed so Dean could have this keepsake. These few momentos he has are kept in his favorites album, hoping one day he can fill it with more photos.
“Jack you don’t know what you’re doing!” Naomi shouts.
Jack shook his head “It means we can appreciate the time we do have together.”
“Let’s do it.”
“There’s nothing I can do?” Jack asks.
There’s the rustling of the wind through the trees, and the sounds of sirens in the distance but no signature Cas whoosh. “Dammit!” Dean curses, kicking the rocks by his feet.
They gear up, Dean holding onto the bronze dagger in his jacket pocket. Their holding large machete’s in their hands along with flashlights. But guns are tucked into their belts as a precaution.
“Cas I-” Dean starts but is cut off.
Cas grins at him, knowing he’s proved his point.
“Baby.”
“Well it was nice to see you,” Sebastian says to Castiel, “and nice to meet you,” he says to Dean with a smile.
Dean narrows his eyes “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Now it’s Sam's turn to growl “So you got turned down! Whoopdefuckingdo! We all suffer heartbreak! I don’t know why you gotta suck everyone else into your shit. ”
Castiel is sitting poised and proper in between loud cheering high school football fans. He’s wrapped in a trench coat while mindlessly watching the field. Dean really wants to stay mad at him but the guy is so fucking gorgeous that Dean just runs harder and ends up making the touchdown. His team swarms him, all shouting their cheers of excitement of playoffs but all Dean can think is "that’ll show him."
Cas’ once particular vocabulary and perfectly groomed stature became wacked out of hell. Slurring his words and doing karaoke with an also very drunk Charlie, Kevin clapped his hands along to the beat of Don’t Stop Believing well the rest of the crowd of drunk teenagers laughed and sang along. Cas had a few buttons undone on his shirt and had his sleeves rolled up. Showing a little more skin than sober Cas would probably like too.
Dean huffs looking at Sam who seems to have checked out of the conversation, now typing furiously on his laptop. Dean suddenly realizes he can finally get his two cents in, “Okay... then what’s the other reason about not being around a few weeks ago? ”
This was not what Dean was expecting when he answered the phone. Jack usually calls or texts about movies, or candy or to complain about Cas but school?
“Don’t mention it, kid. I’ll give you back to your dad now before he stabs me.” Jack’s laughter can be heard from the speaker as the phone gets passed back. Dean huffs in defeat, “Hey sorry I don’t mean to y’know suffocate you.”
Turns out asking Sam to detail how stories are turned into films takes the trip there and back to get Cas fully acquainted. Cas suddenly becoming an expert on the subject. All well Sam takes on the duty of making a list that Cas has to watch for either, A) life purposes or B) to get Dean’s crappy references.
“No, he’s researching.”
He pulls back gently. Putting his hand on Cas’ chest, forcing him to take a breather. Dean rests his forehead on Cas’, both of them catching their breaths.
When Dean hangs up, Sam gives Dean a doubtful look. (Dean showed Sam the messages and everything) It left an awful taste in both their mouths and now with what Jack was told their uncertainty of what to do tripled. Somethings not right and for once in their life, they don’t have a plan.
They turn the corner and come in front of a plain door. Above the frame, it says ‘infirmary’ in a bland font.
The water stops.
Dean snorts “Just don’t fry me okay.”
Dean narrows his eyes, “There’s no such thing as too much Scooby-Doo.”
That’s when Charlie and Cas begin a not too bad rendition of I Want To Know What Love Is by Foreigner that gets the whole backyard swooning. And Cas, Cas doesn’t sing too badly Dean almost enjoys it so much that he sways a little bit with the tune imagining all the bumbling in love messes he and Castiel could be.
“Stanford is about five blocks that way. Wanted to make sure we didn’t appear in the middle of people.”
Cas frowns, “It’s not important.”
Dean smiles at him “Then just wait.”
Dean now perks up, “Jack? What’s wrong with Jack?”
“Go checkout upstairs alone. We’ll relax down here” Jack smiles. They nod before heading upstairs slowly. Coming to a bonus room that has a few instruments along the wall and a couch along the opposite wall. A window parallel with the front of the house offers some light.
Dean turns back to her, “No! I won't have you belittle me for something you can't be sure I did. Plus you take his word because he’s some skinny nerdy kid who’s on the mathletes, you think I’m some dumb jock who doesn’t know jack squat so you believe him and dismiss everything I’ve worked for this whole semester all because of stereotypes right?!”
“Oh, Castiel isn’t going anywhere.”
“It crossed my mind once or twice” Cas shrugged.
He thinks.
DEAN: I miss you so much Cas. You don’t understand.
“If you still have your powers then you’re not human right?” Dean asks carefully.
Cas reached across the bar and grabbed at Dean’s hand “disgustingly in love?” Cas finished for her.
While Sam and Jody determine that they needed a break from life, just the two of them. So Dean and Cas (after some heavy discussion) decided they could do their diligence as Uncles and have the girls stay with them for two weeks.
“Cas can get the next one” Dean retorted.
The flapping sound of Cas’ wings echoes throughout the garage and when Dean looks up, Cas is standing in the distance between him and Sam.
“This is crazy isn’t?” Dean mumbles.
Dean gasps with laughter “You what?!”
Jack takes in a deep breath, “Fine. But I blame you if this goes wrong.”
“Oh well still? I could put you in contact with them if you have actual interest?”
Dean barks out a laugh, his heart squeezing in his chest.
Mary’s was booming. It had been 9 months since the conversation with Gabe. 8 since he bought the place. And 5 since he opened the doors.
“Oh, that’s nice. Well, don’t let me interrupt.”
When he sits up he’s on a pristine white couch, the room’s dark though with minimal light coming from the dark hallways.
Sam, Jody and the girls flew into San Fran the first week of November. This was Jody’ first time at the new house (Sam had flown in to help Jack with small reno’s) she was absolutely blown away by the luxury the house held. Dean and Cas still couldn’t believe they lived there. But the movie theater room gets used frequently, and the deck out back over looking the city is the best place to unwind. It’s slowly becoming their home after all.
Sam snorts, returning to pack his stuff away then slamming the trunk shut, “Just promise me you guys won’t screw on every surface if one of you decides to finally make a move.”
“I’m glad our stories matched up,” Cas says.
Dean feels a pang of guilt even though Cas doesn’t sound angry. More like he’s trying to convince Dean that Jack needs him too. But they’re broken out of their conversation by Sam speaking up, “You guys should go. I’m gonna head back to the motel, I gotta make some calls.”
Dean spins looking over his shoulder, “yeah?”
But then Dean sees him.
“My bones know they’re in their 40’s”
He cut off a pair of old jeans and had been running around the bar in jorts and a dry fit t-shirt. Sweat was constantly dripping down his forehead and neck, he felt like he was constantly running through a sprinkler. But he and his crew made it work and made sure no one that came in wasn’t offered at least a glass or two of ice-cold water.
Dean took most of the next two weeks off only having to pop in on the weekends and Cas only had
Dean snorts “Same old, same old kid.”
“You’re lucky I love you.”
“Like hell, he’s not!” Dean growls.
“I’m protecting my family is what I’m doing.”
Dean’s about to hit the light but then.
“Cas! Cas!” Charlie’s voice rings in Dean’s ears, and from behind them Charlie comes running at full speed.
Dean shakes his head and offers Cas an easy smile, “Hey it’s in the past now man. We’ll figure it out whatever you’re needing alright?”
“Is he here tonight?”
Dean bellows out a laugh as Sam snickers off to the side “Guess he had to go running to the other parent for advice.”
“Dean I-”
Dean can’t argue anymore and opens the door carefully. He peeks in to make sure there's no surprises and once he deems it’s safe he steps into the room. Shutting the door quietly behind him.
Cas hummed, “Can you put Kline? Jack’s still using it, so it makes sense. Hopefully Kelly doesn’t mind.”
“Huh, so that’s what that is…” Jack trails off, looking at Dean’s chest.
“Y’know. I’ll never get used to it” Sam snorted still looking at the tiny piece of cardboard in his hands.
Tomorrow it’ll be 56 days since Cas disappeared.
Cas looks down as if he forgot, “Oh. I thought that when humans were home they liked to wear comfy clothes?”
Dean growls “Maybe that’s just how I cope!”
“You think we can finish Austin Powers, it was funny.”
“Why? Why would you think that.”
“Actually” Dean paused “We have some news that we wanted to share.”
“You’re gonna get it and you will be able to use that towards your degree.”
“Nah man just drink up, enjoy yourself. You’ve gotta have your first some time right.”
“Whoa, what the-”
“Ok” Sam concludes.
Cas lets out a long sigh and Dean can no longer hold his own body weight above Cas. So he rolls to the side of the bed, but still hugging against Cas’ side.
Dean softens a bit, let’s Jo's words sink it. So what if that was true, and people knew he had a crush on Cas. He was only human and he couldn’t help but fall for those dreamy blue eyes. He’s terrified though, of everything. About people, about himself but it might just be worth it because he wants Cas just that bad.
Dean’s gripping onto Cas’s arm as if the man is going to fly away and this will stop him, “Cas. Castiel! What pain!?”
Dean runs a hand over his face “did he say if he was safe or if he’s still… y’ know?”
Cas takes a moment to think, “Well... I’m showing him around the world. Figured he should learn about all different walks of life, not just ours. I may have gotten a little too… controlling. But we talked.”
“Just perfect” He had muttered.
They ended up driving south through Texas, then west towards New Mexico and then north to California. They stopped when they wanted, ate what they wanted, did whatever people were supposed to do on a road trip. They’d been to these states countless times but never really got to appreciate the beauty in each of them. Cas was always researching for the next thing for them to do, finding the littlest towns that had so much to give. Cas found the best places for pie and Dean always thoroughly thanked him for his hard work.
“Shut it Sam.”
“Yeah, we are sweetheart.”
Sam yelled at him the whole way back to the bunker.
“Good.” He pauses “But actually… I have something for you” Dean says handing the bag across the seat. Cas takes it carefully.
“Don’t try to fight this Dean. You’ll only make things worse for Castiel” Naomi threatens. Dean wants to spit at her but then off in the corner he hears Sam groan as he regains consciousness.
Dean really didn’t think he’d live to see the day.
“Grace. You have angel grace inside you, specifically Castiel’s grace.”
But now, sitting in front of it, he couldn’t believe the barn was still standing after all this time.
Dean clears his throat, “Hey you don’t think we fuck up all the time? Hell yeah, we do. And what do we do? We own up to it, and we learn to make it right. So, what are you gonna do?”
“It’s not you” Dean chokes out.
He meets up with Sammy and Dad after the game, he’s all sweaty and desperately needs a shower but he’s grateful to see their proud smiles. Which is a complete 180 from the mouthful Sam had given him yesterday after having to walk home. Sam may also pried the information out of Dean for his early departure from school.
Cas clears his throat and now stands collecting his coat, “Uh yeah. It’s late don’t want to keep you both up any longer.”
Jack was now having a staring contest with Cas. Dean definitely didn’t want to get involved in that, “Well, for now you have Jack.”
Sam laughed.
Naomi stops in front of Jack “Heaven on its own is dying. We need grace to keep us afloat, but with having newer Angels our power is still faltering. We need old grace to keep our home alive. Otherwise, we’d have lost souls with no direction to go in and there’s no way Hell wouldn’t find a way to put them into their pit of torture.”
Dean smiles, brushing his hair back lightly. “That’s why it’s called trying. I know it sounds scary, but it’s actually a lot of different sensations you haven’t experienced yet. You like it when I spank you, don’t you?” Cas blushes, but nods. “Okay. Why?”
“No!” Cas mutters. “Well…not really. And before you ask, I’m not going to discuss my sex life with you. But I do have a date tomorrow night. And I suppose, despite how much I don’t want to, I have you to thank for that.”
“Sam is betting against you. He says you’ll have to get drunk before you talk to Cas. Rowena and I have more faith in you.”
When Cas stirred in the morning, Dean was already awake, sipping a mug of coffee in bed. He smiled, tugging the angel into a kiss. “Morning.”
Sam smiles. “I’ll try…jerk.”
With that he turns to leave, and Cas leans forward to rest his forehead against my chest again, sniffling softly. "Are you alright?" I ask gently.
Sam blushes, hesitating for a moment before wrapping an arm around him. “I guess...though it might have something to do with the fact that you can just poof in snacks.”
Benny chuckles and shrugs. “Looks that way. Your boyfriend is a chicken.” Dean makes a sound of protest as he gently sets Cas down in a chair, making a face at him as he laughs. Benny frowns over at Dean, looking him up and down. “Maybe you oughta get cleaned up, brother.”
“I’m trying,” he answers. “Almost got it…” Dean yelps again, but finally the bullet comes out, rolling along the floor and leaving a trail of red in its wake.
Dean gives a small smile. “Better with you here.” He glances up as the door opens again, eyes widening when Benny steps through the door. “Benny? What are you doing here?”
I sigh in relief, hugging him tightly, feeling him tense, then relax. “You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice again, man,” I murmur. “Yeah, I’m okay. Must’ve just eaten something bad or something.” He gives me a look like he doesn’t quite believe me, but seems to relax a little. “Sorry about that. Let’s go back.” he nods, cautiously picking up the pad again when we sit down. “Something else you want to show me?” He bites his lip again, nodding and flipping to the second page before turning it around. This one looks like the view from inside the cage; I can see the edge of the mattress at the bottom corner. The bars, chains, and everything else in the picture are red except for the person standing in the middle. “Is…that me?” He nods again. “Why am I blue?”
I nod, turning my attention back to Cas. His frightened expression has smoothed out, and he looks a little bit more like the Cas I know. At some point I must doze off, because I wake up to him whimpering and thrashing, fighting the blankets. “Cas?” I murmur softly. “Hey, Cas. Come on, wake up!” When he finally does it’s with a scream that makes my chest hurt, and he pulls away from me in terror. “Hey, it’s me, it’s me! It was just a dream. Take it easy. You’re okay.” He stares at me with wide eyes for a moment before the understanding dawns on him, and his eyes well up with tears. A strangled sob claws its way out of his chest, and then another, and he grabs onto me, hiding his face against my shirt. I’m too shocked for a moment to respond, feeling his tight, desperate grip around me. “Alright,” I murmur, hesitantly wrapping my arms around him. “Hey, it’s okay. They can’t hurt you. Take a deep breath.” He shakes his head hard, trembling and gasping in between sobs, violent shudders wracking his frame. I sigh, hugging him closer. “Cas, buddy, you’re okay. Look at me, alright?” Cautiously, he looks up, and something in my chest tightens at the fear in his eyes and the perplexed stare of someone not quite in reality yet. I clear my throat, taking a deep breath. “I’m not going to let anything happen to you. You just gotta calm down and breathe for me. You’re safe. You trust me, right?" Slowly, he nods, his head falling to my shoulder, and I tighten my grip on him a little. "Okay, good. Then we're going to do this together. So try to relax. I got you. No one's gonna hurt you on my watch, and I'm not going anywhere. Just keep breathing for me, alright? It's gonna be okay." I rub the back of his neck gently until his breaths start to even out. “There you go,” I murmur, lightly running a hand through his hair. “You’re okay. I’m here. Take your time.”
“Alright, let’s get started,” Sam interrupts. “I’m sorry in advance for this. Try to hang in there. You might want to hold onto Dean.”
“Not in the same way you do,” he explains. “But we have groups of…caretakers, I suppose. Angels who look after the young ones. You can ask Gabriel, he was one of mine.”
That one still hurts a little, but he’s used to the pain now. Sometimes he enjoys it. “I’ll go to hell,” he mumbles.
Dean frowned, looking him over for a moment. “I...don’t understand why you’d want that.”
“Isn’t that scary sometimes?” he asks.
“No, it wasn’t,” I answer. “Are you going to panic again?”
Dean chuckles, having figured out his answer before he’d asked, grinning. “Someone’s been working on his manners. Good, Cas.” He takes the cuffs from their spot on the wall, gently fastening them around his wrists and clipping them together behind his back. He tugs against them absently, but relaxes somewhat, and Dean smiles. “Comfortable?”
I can feel the blind panic before I even open the bedroom door. When I step inside Dean is shirtless, struggling to untie the harness with shaking fingers. “Dean, what are you doing?” I ask gently, slowly stepping closer.
“No!” I mutter quickly, the blush somehow worsening at the thought. “It’s not…I mean, angels don’t…It’s…complicated.”
Gabriel smirks. “Well don’t act so surprised, Dean. It looks like you’ve chosen him back. The wings are an invitation of sorts. And you accepted.”
I laugh at that, nuzzling into his chest softly. “Holy shit, Cas. That was… I mean…Goddamn…”
A little sob escapes him, followed by fresh tears, but he nods, holding onto me tighter. “I’m scared, Cas,” he whispers.
“I’m...not sure I understand,” Cas murmured when they pulled apart, still looking perplexed.
think it sounds like fun,” Sam said smugly, ignoring the scowl Dean threw at him. “It would be good for
Cas shivers at the low growl that leaves Dean’s lips. “Good boy. I like it too.” Dean shifts, and suddenly the object inside Cas that he’d mostly forgotten about hums to life, buzzing against his prostate. Cas yelps, gripping the chair tightly as Dean chuckles. “You gonna cum for me again?” he teases. “Gonna cum while I tease your pretty cock?”
“Fuck…” I murmur into the sheets. “Yes, please…want to be good…”
Sam glares at him. “
Dean smirks, resting their foreheads together. “Good. That’s the idea. Do you like it?”
He nods. “Are we having a nice conversation about our feelings?” he asks.
“Yeah, something like that. Except a new puppy doesn’t try to cook breakfast at three in the morning. Did you want something?”
The tip digs into his skin a little, and he hisses, pain sharp and bright through the darkness. And it’s so sweet that he digs it in further, just to feel.
Cas considers it for a moment. “Can we cuddle a little while longer first?”
TheSongSmith
He wanders off, and Cas glances up at him, chuckling. “Come on, we can’t miss that!”
His fingers shift under my chin, lifting it so that he can kiss me softly. “Good. Ready to try something else?”
Cas laughs, his fingers tracing lightly up my spine. “I was hoping you’d say that. Think you can be a good boy for me a little longer?”
“Feel free to have one,” Cas offers. “I made them for everyone. How are you this morning, Sam?”
There’s a sharp pain in Dean’s chest, and a series of memories flash through his head; the pained expression on Cas’ face during their argument when he’d said the angel didn’t care about him, the careful way he’d touched him in the tub, his patience during Dean’s meltdown. He searches Cas’ expression for a moment, then slowly shifts closer, though not close enough to touch. “You didn’t…you could have used your mojo to clean me up in half a second. Why did you do it by hand instead?” he asks carefully.
I make a small sound, and Sam pauses. “Cas? Did that hurt?”
He carefully pulls me to my feet, steadying me when my knees give out and walking me over to the bed in the corner. Once on my knees he pushes me down until my chest rests on the bed, ass in the air, keeping me still with one possessive hand at the back of my neck. Two fingers slip back into me, and I melt into his hands, moaning softly. “That’s my good boy,” he murmurs, pressing soft kisses to the backs of my thighs. “So obedient and relaxed for me, taking whatever I give you. You think you’ve earned my cock?”
“We have to,” Sam answers gently. “I know you don’t like it, and I’m sorry, but we don’t have another choice. We’d have to carry you back to the car, and even if we made it, you’d bleed out before we got you to a hospital. I’m sorry. I’ll be as gentle as I can.”
I snort, shaking my head. “I bet he was…that fucking girl…”
He hesitates, watching me for a minute before slowly releasing his knees and stretching them out along the bottom of the tub. I smile encouragingly. “Thanks. You want to do this part yourself?” He takes the cloth from me, gingerly cleaning himself while I find shampoo. He whimpers, turning around when I try to sit behind the tub. “Well I can’t get to your hair if you’re looking at me.” He whines again, and it takes me a minute to realize what he wants. I move back to sit beside him, and he visibly relaxes. “So it’s better if you can see me, huh?” I ask quietly, lathering the shampoo into his hair. He nods, and a soft moan escapes him as I lightly massage his scalp. It surprises him so much that he claps his hand over his mouth, and I laugh. “It’s okay,” I chuckle. “Nice to know I’m not hurting you, at least.” The corners of Cas’ mouth twitch up a little, and he reaches out cautiously, lightly touching my arm. It’s hesitant, but it feels a lot like a thank you. “You’re welcome,” I smile back. He willingly tips his head back to let me rinse the soap from his hair and body. I frown down at the water for a moment, which has turned a pinkish gray with the grime and blood. “Alright, all clean. Let’s see what Sam found for you.”
“Then why did you…?” I turn him around to face me, frowning at the slight tension in his expression. “What happened?”
No! Absolutely not! That’s not what I need to think about.
“A good kind of pain?” Dean suggests. Cas nods. “See? That’s already a type of pain play that you like. I’m not saying you’ll like all of it. But you already enjoy some of it. Is trying out some different kinds really so scary?”
Gabe nods. “More than anything. He’s…I can’t even explain it. It’s like…I was living in black and white, and I didn’t even know it, and now everything is in color, and I can’t believe what I was missing, and I can’t go back to that, Cas, I just…” He pauses, slowly glancing up with the most serious look Cas has ever seen on his face. “I was going to ask him to marry me…”
Sheepishly, I nod. "Yeah..."
Dean points his gun up into the air and pulls the trigger. Cas looks at him. “What?” he says. “I think they know we’re here.”
Dean bites his lip, shaking his head. "I've tried not to think about it...I just...I don't think I can do it, Cas. The last time I went back I just...I saw him everywhere..."
“Okay. And Dean?” He turns to look at me over his shoulder, and I grin. “Don’t worry; he still loves you the most.”
Dean laughs. “Am I that obvious?”
“Maybe,” Dean said. “But...I’m pretty happy with my life now. I mean, the current situation aside, I have Cas, and Ben, and you guys, and a job that I love...and yeah, maybe the way I got here kind of sucked, but...the only reason I was able to come out of this on the other side was because of the things you did for me. You were the only adults who cared about me, and you kept Sammy safe and got him help, and that’s not nothing. And now you’re helping Ben, because the way you just accept him as part of the family makes it easier for him to accept himself too. He asked me this morning if I thought you’d be okay with it if he called you grandpa. He already talked to Ellen, I think he’s settled on ‘nana’ for her.”
He jumps at the soft touch against his shoulder, then relaxes, realizing that Dean hadn’t gone anywhere, but was standing a few feet away watching in case he panicked. “Well done, Cas. That was good.” Cas shivers at the murmured praise, pleased at the pride in Dean’s voice. “I wouldn’t leave you like that,” he continues.  “Now, I’m going to go out to the living room to get something, and then I’ll come back. Be good while I’m gone and you’ll get a reward.” Cas nods, managing to stay calm this time as he listens to the sounds of Dean walking away, fumbling with something, then walking back. He leans into the light touch on his cheek. “Good boy. I’m going to move you. Are you okay keeping the blindfold on?”
The younger man frowns slightly. “What do you mean?”
“Are you ready to come, sweet boy?” Cas murmurs, fingers trailing teasingly between Dean’s legs, but not quite touching the switch. Dean manages a shaky nod, gasping as the vibrations turn up again. “Doing so well for me,” Cas purrs, kissing his head softly. “You’re going to come with my hand around your throat,” he orders softly, fingers teasing lightly along Dean’s cock. “You’re going to come under my control, do you understand?”
I shake my head, kissing him softly. “Not at all. I think it all just kinda came out at once. Sorry.”
“Relax Dean. We both figured you guys could use the bunker to yourself, and neither of us really want the details of what you do behind closed doors. It’s just a simple salt and burn, that’s all. I promise I’ll call you if I need any help, alright?”
God smiles. “And I was listening. It’s a good thing you called, you know. I was concerned when dear Castiel fell off the radar.”
“I appreciate the concern,” Dean smiles. “But you don’t have to worry about that. I wouldn’t be encouraging it if I didn’t like the idea. And it’s not really about having sex with other people, even if you do decide you’re okay with that. It’s more about…doing it to please me. I’m taking you there to show you off in front of my peers. I want them to know how good you are; to be impressed with your obedience and your skills. Nothing will happen that I don’t approve of. Your job is just to be as good as you always are for me. It may have a sexual component to it, if that’s something you want, but your role doesn’t change. It’s still about trusting me to make those decisions for you.”
Dean chuckled, watching the pink flush spread through Cas’ face and spill down his chest. “Now who said I wanted you to concentrate?” he teased. Cas’ cock gave an involuntary twitch inside him at that, and Dean huffed out a laugh. “Fuck, you feel good, angel...”
Dean smiles, relaxing slightly. “Okay...good. Actually, I think it’ll be better, if we’re in it together.”
I grin, shaking my head and kissing him again. “No Sir.”
Cas pouts. “The washing machine is evil,” he mutters. “Besides, I really do think it’ll help. And, if you get the chores done, I might be willing to make it worth your while...”
Cas nodded. “Sounds like you’ve got an idea...”
He frowns, puzzled as I bolt from the couch, just managing to close the door behind me before I start dry heaving over the toilet, his imaginary, terrified screams ringing in my head. I have to take several deep breaths before my stomach settles and my imagination stops giving life to the drawing, reminding myself that he’s safe. When the shaky feeling passes I carefully stand, washing my face and the back of my neck. I must be gone longer than I think, because there’s a timid knock at the door before a quiet, low “Dean?”
It takes a little longer than usual, with Cas having to support me most of the way, but we manage to make it into bed. I fall back against the pillows, curling up against him as he pulls me close. “I love you, Cas,” I murmur, nuzzling into his chest.
“Fuck’s sake, Cas, don’t say
There’s a yelp and a cry, and then more static. “Dean!”
Love,
“Shh, shh,” Dean soothes, grounding him with a light hand against his lower back. “Just gotta make sure you’re okay. Deep breaths for me.” His fingers feel along the smooth walls for a minute before slowly withdrawing, and he presses a soft kiss between his shoulder blades. Cas hears the click of a cap before Dean’s hands return, rubbing cream into the sore skin of his ass, shushing him softly when he whimpers. “Good boy,” he murmurs when he’s finished. “You did good.” Cas groans in protest when Dean pulls him up into his lap, dragging the pillow with him. “I know you’re tired sweetheart. Just need you to eat a little something for me, and then I’ll let you sleep, okay? I promise.” Cas nods reluctantly, curling up against Dean’s chest, but he swallows obediently when Dean tips a glass of water against his lips. Cas’ eyes close, and the glass disappears, only to be replaced with the sweet taste of fruit being offered from Dean’s fingers. Dean kisses his temple softly, murmuring praises until the bowl is empty. His fingers travel to the back of Cas’ collar, stroking it lightly. “Can I take this off now?” Cas whines softly. “Okay, how about if I just loosen it a little?” He thinks for a moment, then nods, lifting his chin a little as Dean loosens it, kissing the back of his neck softly. “Alright baby, you’re all done. Just relax now. I’m so, so proud of you.”
Dean opened the door carefully, surprised at the cheer that went up from the crowd below. Claire, Kaia, and Charlie were there, and so were Garth and Bess, and some of their friends from the apocalypse world. Dean couldn’t help but smile as he walked down the stairs, immediately being tackled by Charlie when he reached the bottom. “What are you doing here?” he asked, shocked.
I roll my eyes at him. “Oh come on, now we’re assigning emotions to it?”
“It’s okay,” I chuckle. “As long as you’re not still freaking out.”
The sound breaks Dean’s heart, and he rubs the back of Cas’ neck soothingly. “Okay sweetheart, we’ll fix it, I promise. Just hang in there for me, okay? Let’s go inside and take a look.” He carefully leads Cas over to the bed, gently sitting him down at the edge. “Trust me?” Cas nods quickly, and Dean digs a pair of scissors out of the bedside table, carefully cutting through his shirt to avoid having him stretch to get it off. He slips onto the bed behind him, carefully peeling the fabric away and apologizing when Cas whimpers. He can’t help the soft gasp that escapes him when he sees what’s under the shirt. The bloodstains were bad, but what was underneath it is so much worse, and Dean isn’t really sure that it can be considered skin anymore. “Oh, baby…It’ll hurt too much if I do it myself. We should get you to the hospital.”
When Cas arrives at Dean’s apartment, he can hear classic rock through the door. He knocks and the music softens, followed by a shout to come in. He enters slowly, looking around as he follows the noise into the kitchen, where Dean stands at the stove juggling a number of pots and pans. “Hey!” he greets cheerfully, leaning in to kiss him softly. “Hope today went better than your last day of work.”
“I love you too, baby girl. I’m glad you had fun. Now, go get ready for bed. We’re going to visit Uncle Sammy and Uncle Gabe tomorrow.”
I swallow nervously, nodding. “I…yes. I love you, Cas. I love you so much it hurts, and I don’t know if I want you to say something or not say anything because it terrifies me either way and I can’t breathe just thinking about it. I don’t deserve to…”
Dean answers with a half-hearted growl, watching him disappear. “Dean?” I say cautiously once he’s gone.
I continue to murmur to him softly until his nightmares fade and the trembling stops, his whimpers growing quieter until they fall silent. “You doing alright?” I ask softly. He sniffs, pulling away and nodding. Instinctively, I reach out to wipe the tearstains from his face, and he flinches away. “S’okay. Not gonna hurt you,” I murmur soothingly, moving slower towards him, relieved when he lets me wipe them away. “You wanna talk about it?” Cas swallows and looks away, a crease forming between his eyebrows like he’s warring with himself. An idea comes to me, and I start digging through the drawer. He watches curiously, frowning in confusion when I pull out a pad and pen. “If you can’t tell me what your dream was about, maybe you’d like to show me,” I explain, holding it out for him. He hesitates a moment before taking it, biting his lip in concentration as he draws. When he finishes he rips off the page and shoves it back at me. It’s a crude drawing, but it looks like some sort of table or bench with restraints at every corner. “Oh, Cas…” I whisper, my chest tightening as I imagine what might have been done to him. I’m caught off guard when he grabs it out of my hands, balling it up with a kind of seething rage I’ve never seen in him before and chucking it as far across the room as he can, his breaths coming out in short, angry bursts. “Okay, I understand,” I say softly. “You’re upset. It’s okay to feel that way. They did horrible things to you; things no one should have to go through. It’s okay to be angry and scared and upset. That’s normal.” His expression softens a little with what seems like relief that he’s being understood. “I get it, okay? And I know it’s looking pretty bleak right now with all those memories still so fresh and raw in your head. But I promise you things will get better. I’m always here if you want to talk or draw or whatever. I’m going to help you get better, and then I’m going to find those sons of bitches and make them pay for what they did to you. You’re not in this alone.”
they tell him.
“Sure I can,” he mutters petulantly. “I just did.”
Dean smiles. “Fair enough. We can talk about it if you’d like.”
Sam smiles. “I’m glad. Don’t worry, Cas. We’ll figure out how to change them back soon. But at least you know that for him it’s not about…sex, or responsibility or anything like that. He just honestly loves you.”
“Papa and Daddy are getting married! And they’re gonna adopt me!”
I pull myself up, clenching my fists. “Well, that must be nice for you. I wish I could forget it. I’m going for a drive,” I mutter, not looking back as I brush past him.
I fight the urge to look up at him, but the question comes out before I can stop it. “Why?”
Dean laughs slightly, shaking his head. “I promised you I wouldn’t...and then almost broke that promise, before Cas saved my stupid ass...”
I tug his own shirt off, letting my fingers run over the smooth planes of his chest, leaning in to press soft kisses along his collarbone. He sighs softly, tracing his hand along my spine as we carefully explore each other. At some point we both lose the rest of our clothes, and his eyes widen as I push him back, kneeling between his legs and reaching out to slowly stroke him. “Dean, you don’t…” The sentence ends in a moan as I take a deep breath and swipe my tongue along his shaft. Huh, not as weird as I thought. I glance up at him for a minute, chuckling at the flush starting at the tips of his ears before wrapping my lips around him and sucking hard. He yelps, one hand tangling in my hair and tugging hard. Curious now, I experiment, remembering different actions done to me by a host of faceless women, seeing what kinds of new sounds I can pull from him and starting to enjoy myself. He pants hard, his grip in my hair tightening. “Dean…I can’t…”
It’s quiet for a moment, and when I gather the courage to look up Cas is grinning. “Good boy. Why don’t you strip for me, and we’ll see what we can do about that.”
I shrug sheepishly. “I didn’t have the heart to get rid of it.” He flips to the third drawing, the one of us in the bathroom together. “You always like that one.”
Gabriel looks between the two of them for a moment. “Do you…know each other?”
Dean nodded, swallowing hard and leaning into her touch slightly as he wrestled his panicked breathing back under his control. “Thanks...sorry, I...I think I’ll feel better once he’s awake...”
“Just a light sedative. It’ll wear off soon. I just…from what you said, I kinda figured we might run into something like this. I’m sure he’ll forgive you once he calms down. He’ll understand.”
I hum in response, groaning softly as he plants soft kisses down my chest, reaching out blindly to rub across his shoulders. When I open my eyes he grins at me before ducking down, holding my gaze as he flicks his tongue over my nipple. I gasp, threading my fingers into his hair as pleasure sparks across my hazy brain. “Cas…” I whine.
While he was less than thrilled about his current predicament, Cas couldn’t say the special care Dean took with him on those nights didn’t make him feel warm inside, in a way he’d never felt before. It was a side of the hunter he’d never seen, all warm eyes and soft words, or at least it was not a side previously directed at him, and he both enjoyed being the focus of Dean’s gentleness, and hated himself for enjoying it so much. Because that was one of the most confusing parts of this new human existence: the emotions. He’d felt things, as an angel, of course. He’d felt doubt, and anger, and pity. Even fear. But none of it prepared him even slightly for the incredible breadth and depth of human emotion. The constant shift and pulse of it under his skin, the mix of opposing feelings...even the sheer
He snatched his coat from the back of a chair, practically running to the stairs. “Where are you going?” Dean asked, scowling.
I frown, nudging Gabriel with my shoulder. "Who said you were allowed to bond with my brother?"
He shakes his head. “No…no, it’s fine.” Without a second glance he hurries out of the room, and after a minute I hear the main door close.
Hello my loves! So marriage equality happened and I was like "aw yeah, I'm gonna write the best chapter ever to celebrate" and then it turned into porn. I mean it, this is really just pure porn and some fluff. But something tells me you won't complain. Enjoy!
Cas takes a deep breath, looking up at him, and Dean smiles, tilting his chin up to kiss him softly. “Hi,” he whispers.
“You love him,” Donna whispered tearfully, and it wasn’t a question.
(See the end of the chapter for
A high-pitched squeal escaped Donna, and she danced excitedly in her seat. “That’s so cute!”
I shrug a little, concentrating on the sharp outline unfolding across his back. “I don’t much. But I used to like art when we were in school. It was the only class I ever got an A in.”
So, yeah. You know I can't resist the fluff, especially with Sam and Gabriel THEY'RE SO CUTE. If you liked it remember to leave me a little review! They make me happy :D Also, I'll be posting a new (long) fic over the course of the month (while I write like crazy for NaNoWriMo) so remember to check that out!
He clears his throat, looking unsure for a moment. “Right, I, uh...I guess I’m just...still trying to figure out some things...a lot has changed since I’ve been gone...”
“Yellow.”
I smile, leaning up to kiss him softly. “You were right. I do feel better. And I really should learn to stop holding onto everything. I know it’s not healthy. I’ve just been doing it for so long I’m not really sure how to stop anymore. How did you know this would help?”
Dean looks up, worried. “Something on your mind?”
He finds himself relaxing as the angel’s fingers stroke smooth lines from the insides of his thighs up to his collarbones and back again. Dean lets his head fall back against Cas’ shoulder, his temple resting against Cas’ chin. He lets out a soft whimper when Cas’ fingers shift to his nipples, teasing and plucking at the sensitive nubs. “That’s my boy,” Cas murmurs, pleased at the response. “Feels so good to let go for me, doesn’t it?” Dean manages a hum of agreement, his eyes fluttering closed as he lets himself sink under the weight of the hushed, soothing voice in his ear. One hand travels lower, stroking lovingly over his belly while the other pinches his nipple hard. Dean cries out, arching into Cas’ hands mindlessly. “Beautiful,” Cas purrs, pressing soft kisses along the hunter’s neck and shoulder. “Every inch of this body...” He runs light fingers up Dean’s inner thighs, chuckling at the whole-body shiver it produces. “Absolutely stunning, how responsive it is...I think it knows it belongs to me, don’t you?” He watches Dean’s mouth try to form words for a moment before he gives up, settling on a soft moan. “Yes, I think it knows,” he murmurs, gravely and low in Dean’s ear. His fingers trail lightly down between Dean’s spread thighs and under the fabric to the vibrator, flicking the switch to turn it on low and chuckling at the shudder that runs through the human. “It knows I control its pleasure...and its pain,” he teases, smacking Dean’s inner thigh hard and relishing in the whimper it earned him. “And now,” he continues, fingers brushing slowly up Dean’s chest. “You’re going to let me control its breath too, aren’t you?”
“A little sore,” Cas says after a moment. “But you prepped me so well, it’s really not all that uncomfortable. Better, with whatever you’re doing,” he teases.
“I’m not sure it’s something I can teach,” I answer. “It’s just a part of control that comes with time. You can try. Maybe it’ll work.”
“That’s right,” he answers. “It means I own your body and your mind, don’t I?” I whimper again, and I don’t realize I’m begging until he shushes me softly. “I know, I know,” he murmurs. “Needy little sluts like you need to be filled, don’t they?” I manage something close to an affirmation, and Cas chuckles. “Poor boy. Let’s see if you’ve earned it, shall we?” His fingers withdraw with a loud, wet sound, and he laughs at my soft whimpers of protest, slowly sitting me up. “I’m not done with you yet. Come on.”
per se, but this was way more than he’d bargained for. Cas was still staring at him, waiting for a response, oblivious to his discomfort. Dean took a breath, closing his eyes. “Alright, uh...I’m talking about a different kind of partner...okay, first, you need to take all this stuff and get it out of the area where we eat. Put it in your room or something for now, or...I don’t know, it just...can’t be here.”
“He’s a good kid,” Dean agrees. “And actually, he’s not so different from you. Benny found him first, just like he did with me. I don’t know the whole story, but apparently his parents were pretty demanding too. The poor kid was driving himself crazy. He just wanted to be good enough for once. And Ezekiel had been alone for a while. He’s the kind of person who needs a purpose. But he wasn’t really bold enough to be sought after by most people. He was pretty unsure of himself. Benny introduced them, and they just kind of fit. They gave each other what they needed. They claim they’re not together, but it’s a lie. They’re exclusive, and they moved in together a couple of months ago. So Zeke gets to care for somebody, and Kevin has standards he can live up to.”
He nods, and slowly his breathing evens out. After a minute he looks up at me. “I liked that experiment,” he murmurs, his voice still rougher than usual. “I think we need to repeat it more often.”
He laughs, shaking his head. “I’m not saying anything else. But I mean it about that invitation. I could give your precious little Cassie a lesson or two.”
I huff, swatting him lightly. “Shush...too early...”
Once the party started winding down, Dean nudged Claire, motioning her over to a quieter corner. “So,” she smirked. “How’s it feel to be forty-two?”
Bobby looked up at that, surprised. “He did? What’d you tell ‘im?”
He gives a little shrug as I sit up and stretch, yawning. “Just happy to see you. And I have some good news.”
Cas hesitates, but nods shyly, so Sam hands me a container filled with white cream and a stack of bandages. “Okay,” I murmur, shifting closer. “I’ll be as gentle as I can.” I start carefully covering each mark with the cream, working my way down his chest and torso and apologizing when he flinches. “Alright buddy, I have to get the ones on your back too. That okay?” He tenses, but allows me to repeat the process on his back. I work as quickly as I can, and when I sit back beside him he seems to relax a little.
“You sure?” Dean asks. “We don’t have to.”
“Well that definitely didn’t come from the cafeteria,” Meg says from the door.
He grins. “You want to order room service?”
“Fuck yeah,” he hums, nuzzling closer. Cas smiles, kissing his head before guiding him back onto his heels.
“Well, I…I haven’t exactly been great at following orders the way we’re supposed to,” he murmurs, embarrassed as any misbehaving child in front of their father.
The angel considered it. Serious talks were not typically an activity Dean participated in unless he had no other choice. “Are you drunk?”
The little bastard actually
“It’s working, isn’t it?” Dean chuckles. “How we doing back there Benny?”
The voice laughed. “He’s an angel, moron. And a dead one. That makes him my domain. Not to mention the little deal we had.”
Woah it's been a while....So I've been dedicating myself to finishing up the stories I left hanging. Apologies for any slight differences there may be, I'm doing my best and chugging along to the conclusion! This one will have one more chapter (I think) after the one you're about to read. Enjoy!
“Either. Both. Just…ugh. No.”
Something is wrong, and it makes my chest hurt, but there's nothing I can do to fix it. There's another voice, one that belongs to the other person here.
“For?” he asks innocently. “I told you, I was just bored and thought you might enjoy pie.” I raise an eyebrow at him, and he sighs. “Alright. We need to talk, Dean.”
“Th-Thank you Castiel...”
“Well will,” I insist. “They’re going to pay for what they did.”
He holds his hands up in defense. “I didn’t say anything. I’ve always known you had a soft spot for the little guy. That’s…sweet.”
“Five,” Dean corrects. “But who’s counting?”
“Hmm?”
Cas sighs, holding a hand up. “Gabe, I’m sorry. I completely forgot about lunch. My phone died two nights ago, and I haven’t gone home for the charger yet. I was dealing with something. I’m sorry for scaring you. Now, why don’t you come sit down? Want a drink?”
Cas scanned his face for a moment before his expression softened, nodding. “Of course, sweetheart. Whatever you need.”
“Mom, please…don’t…” I choke out, hating how small and frightened my voice sounds.
I hesitate for a moment, taking a shaky breath. “You can come if you want to. But I’m not going to be very good company.”
“Oh. Okay then. You’re done. Now back to bed before you hurt yourself.”
“Not really. I’m not good at being alone with my thoughts.”
Cas hesitates, biting his lip for a moment. “What if…I might want to try?” he asks cautiously.
“Good boy. Remember, you can stop any time.” With that he begins pressing soft kisses along Cas’ neck and shoulder, his fingers tracing lightly over his ribs. Cas can’t help but relax under the touch, almost an instinct by now, and the knot in his stomach relaxes a little. “Good. Alright, let’s give this a try. One step at a time.” His touch continues, and then suddenly there’s a third hand pressed to his chest, and he does flinch this time, Dean’s fingers stilling. “Cas?”
Cas sighs, lips parting as Dean licks gently into his mouth. He moans softly at the taste of him, shifting to press up against Dean’s chest before slowly pulling away. “You’re incredible,” he murmurs, smiling at the light blush that flashes across Dean’s face. “It makes you uncomfortable to be complimented,” he observes.
He shrugs. “Just exploring. Sleep well?”
Cas nods. “That’s good. Hopefully today will go as well as yesterday.”
He smiles a little. “Dean, Mary Winchester’s heaven is the last Christmas she spent with you. You were around three years old, and your father wasn’t there, but she played with you and your new Christmas presents all day and then watched you fall asleep in front of the tree with a cookie in your hand. It was chosen because the thing that made her happiest was you. You were never a burden, Dean. She loved you very much.”
He smiles. “I’m glad.” He starts planting soft kisses along my neck and shoulder.
He smiles, kissing me again. “Good boy,” he purrs. “Strip.” There’s an odd note in his voice that I’ve never heard there before, and I’m already rock-hard when I push my sweatpants to the floor. There’s something about gentle, mild-mannered Cas playing rough that I really want to see. He grins, giving me a completely unabashed once-over before nudging my ankles with his foot until I widen my stance. Walking around behind me, he takes each of my wrists, bringing them up and interlocking the fingers behind my head. “Stay still.”
Cas shrugs. “I kind of lost track of all the hands after a while, but then I figured it kind of didn’t matter. I knew Dean was telling you what to do, and he wouldn’t let you do anything bad. It was easier after that.”
“Yes. You’re mine, and I’m yours. Bonded forever.”
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Cas murmurs. “I already have everything. Besides, you should know better than to threaten the wards of a Guardian.” He pauses. “I’m sorry, Karael. There is no other way.” There’s a bright flash of light, and when I open my eyes Cas stands alone. Slowly, he turns back to us. “Are you okay?” he asks nervously.
“What exactly does that mean?”
“What, fuck me? Of course I did. You let me do it with you, didn’t you?” Dean counters.
"That sounds like fun..." Cas hums, slipping his shoes off at the door and pulling Dean onto the couch. "Actually, I've been thinking about that..."
I shrug. “I don’t know, I’ve never seen them. But there must be something there if they’re broken. Let’s go see what we can find out.”
He chuckles in response, ruffling Gabriel’s hair lightly and grinning at his pout. “Very true. It is quiet, though. Hopefully we’ll find a way to change them back soon.”
Cas nods, stroking his thumb over the back of Dean’s knuckles. “Did he start that day?”
I lean in, planting a soft kiss on his lips. “It means I love you.”

“Where are we going?” he asks curiously once we’ve gotten outside.
The first thing that comes out is a whimper. “
“That’s right, you’re my perfect boy. You’d let me do anything I want to you, wouldn’t you?” Dean purrs in agreement, nuzzling against him happily, and the angel chuckles. “Why do you let me?”
Dean nods, groaning as he slowly stands up, and Cas stifles a chuckle. “Alright. Remember, if you get overwhelmed again let me know and we’ll leave.” He leans in to kiss him softly, then offers his arm. Cas smiles, putting his arm through Dean’s and heading downstairs.
He glances down at the list. “I think that’s just about it for now. Once we practice a little we’ll know more specifics. Is there anything else you want to add? Any special rules or requests?”
Dean glances away, looking sheepish for a moment before his expression hardens. “Yeah, I guess so. I appreciate the concern. But I’m fine now, so you can go back to…wherever you’ve been.”
“Doesn’t mean it won’t try,” he mumbles.
“But you didn’t lose me,” he murmurs. “I’m right here. I’m not going anywhere, and I’m going to be fine, okay?”
“You sure?” Dean asked. “We can help out.”
I take a deep breath, steeling myself before walking into the bathroom. It does nothing against the slight smile Cas gives me from the tub. “Ready?” He gives a slight nod, his eyes closing as he relaxes against the back of the tub. His head tips back when I rub gently along his collarbone, making a soft sound that goes straight to my cock. Thankful that his eyes are closed, I shift uncomfortably, cleaning gently around his still-healing throat. He groans softly, and I grip the edge of the tub.
“Well that’s a yes. Why don’t you try a few more before we start winding him down?”
Behind me, the couch dips, and I jump a little. I turn to find Sam, who’s frowning. “Why would you think that, Cas?” he asks softly.
“Yeah. He’s a musician.”
Cas nods, his eyes fluttering closed. He starts to respond, but gets cut off when Dean squeezes gently, his words turning into a gasp as his back arches. “Yes…” he hisses after a moment.
I nod. “Yeah. He said I grabbed him, and the power of the human spirit forced some sort of connection. And now that he’s hurt, they’re reaching out to me. He says he’s never experienced anything like it before.”
I quickly search for Dean’s side of the link, but it’s eerily quiet, and something inside me lurches with panic. He wasn’t planning on going on a hunt today, and all week he’s seemed preoccupied, but I can’t even imagine what’s happened. I locate Sam quickly, landing in front of him. He’s wearing a dark suit, but not the ill-fitting one he wears on cases, and there’s a flower tucked into his pocket. When I look around, I see that we’re in a forest, but Dean is nowhere to be found. “Sam? What happened?”
(See the end of the chapter for
When Cas wakes up, it’s because he’s being kissed breathless. He sighs softly, one hand coming up to tangle in Dean’s hair, but Dean takes his wrist, pinning it back down to the bed. So it’s that kind of morning. Dean pulls away slowly, smirking a little. “Good morning, Castiel.”
“Things in heaven had been okay for a while,” he starts, “But there was an uprising. The rebels took control for a while and tried to recruit the other angels. They saw me as the strongest leader on the opposing side, even as a human, and they believed if they could reprogram me the others would follow. I managed to evade them for a while, but I knew they were catching up to me, so I called you. I just…if I disappeared forever I didn’t want you to wonder.” I frown, hugging him tighter. “Anyway, their early attempts were unsuccessful. Eventually they got…more creative. They used you as a means of breaking me. It didn’t work for a while, but then…it did.” He sits up a little. “I am sorry about that. I know you wouldn’t hurt me.”
“Oh, yeah,” Cas blushed. “You know that first night, when I told Charlie I’d found you...I was so worried for you, and you wouldn’t talk to me...you’d barely even look at me, and I knew something was wrong...I asked her to look into recent missing persons cases and see if she could find anyone who might have been you. She didn’t find you, of course, but she somehow got into the police departments files and started noticing a weird pattern of disappearances...She speculated that it could have been some sort of human trafficking situation. It seemed to fit, with your injuries and everything. I’m sorry, I should have told you earlier. I was afraid you’d think I might send you back there or something. I didn’t want you to leave.”
Cas shrugs. “Does it matter?”
Cas hummed, looking around for a moment before tugging him over to a face painter. He deliberated for a long time before finally settling on a heart with the same stripes as his flag. He looked so excited about it that Dean couldn’t help but smile, and when the woman at the table turned to him and asked “Anything for you, sweetheart?” he knew what he was going to do.
When I go back outside, Cas smiles at me from the stove. “How did it go?”
He was cut off when suddenly the smaller man was pressed to his side, his head resting on Dean’s chest. “Is this alright?”
I sit up a little bit, frowning at him. “How?”
“It could be,” Dean shrugs. “Would that make you uncomfortable?”
and who was he to argue? One of his hands landed at the back of Cas’ head, pulling him closer as he kissed back.
“Yes sir,” Dean laughs, kissing him again. “My apologies. So, how’re you feeling?”
Dean shushes him softly. “Well, you did cum so hard you blacked out for a minute,” he teases gently. “And you were really, really deep in your headspace. Your brain is just a little confused, that’s all. It’ll even out. You just hang onto me. I’ll keep you together.”
, and I...I have to get him back, Sammy. I have to.”
“My apologies, Castiel,” he murmurs after a minute. “I did not intend to get so out of hand.”
I kiss his forehead softly, holding him closer. "I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, okay?"
He nods, and I feel him rummaging again with his free hand before his fingers slowly withdraw. I whine, and he chuckles. “What’s wrong?”
Dean shushes him again, shaking his head. “I know baby, it’s okay. That’s not important right now. I just need to know what happened so I can help. Did that man do this to you? Did he hurt you?”
I chuckle softly. “I guess you’re right. That’s kind of new for me, actually. It might take me a while to get used to, but I’ll try.”
He smiles. “Love you too. So? Is it something to try again?”
Dean nods, grinning. “I’d really love to see how it looks on you, but I don’t think Ellen would appreciate that much.”
He smiles, shrugging. “I was…finishing my backup plan.” I raise an eyebrow at him, and he chuckles. “It’s a surprise for you. I’ve been working on it for a while, actually, but I thought I should finish it before I talked to you, in case you required a little more coercion.”
Cas sighs, dropping his gaze. “I just…had a dream, that’s all. I’m fine.”
He ignores me, stretching. “Dean?” he murmurs finally. “Is now a more appropriate time for breakfast?”
Gabe grins. “Well, Sam has taught me a lot of things you don’t know about,” he winks.
Dean smiled, hugging her tighter. “We’ll do our best...we missed you too, Charlie.”
Cas shushes me softly, his thumb moving lightly along my cheek. “Dean, how many times do I have to tell you to stop apologizing? Believe me, I was fully prepared for it when I came in. I think your wall just came down all at once. But I’m glad you got it out, and that you told me about these things.”
Cas considers it for a moment. “Because I’ve given you every chance to hurt me, and you haven’t,” he answers finally. “You showed up in my apartment one day, and I let you tie me up and blindfold me, and…you came back. You take care of me. I don’t really have a reason not to trust you.”
“Why?”
“Woah, woah, easy there,” a low, gruff voice says. ‘It’s me, I swear...”
He nods thoughtfully, and I glance up at him. “What?”
Dean wrote.
“I think so,” Cas answered after a moment of consideration.
He comes over from where he’s been searching and cracks it open, frowning as it falls to a certain page. “Looks like a spell book to me.” A piece of paper sits inside with what appears to be last names. Some of them are familiar, and I recognize them from Sam’s research. “We got ourselves a hitlist. There’s some dark shit in here.”
“Where is Dean?” I ask.
“What do you think we should do?” he asks.
“I don’t know, Sam!” Dean hisses back. “I don’t know how to fix people, much less angels.”
A hand stroked lightly through his hair. “Whatever you were dreaming about must have been frightening,” Cas murmured. “I think you had a panic attack. I know it’s scary, but you’re okay.” He rubbed Dean’s back lightly for a moment, though it didn’t seem to help him relax. “Let’s go take a walk, okay?” he suggested. “We’ll get you a drink on the way.” Dean nodded slightly, holding onto him tightly as he shakily stood up. Cas kept an arm around him, letting him press close and lean against his shoulder. The contact was soothing, giving Dean something to hold onto when the memories tried to push their way into his head. He accepted the glass of water Cas offered gratefully, sipping from it quietly and letting himself be led outside. Cas walked slowly, keeping Dean tucked under his arm as he led him across the lawn. Dean finally looked up when the familiar scent hit him; dust and leather and hay. Cas opened the big wooden door, tugging him down to a bench, and Dean smiled gratefully as his heartbeat slowed, listening to the soft shuffling in the barn. Cas looked him over for a moment. “Okay. I’m listening.”
TheSongSmith
He wakes up screaming and unable to breathe, the walls of his torture chamber still swimming in front of him. Vaguely, he hears his name being shouted above the noise, and he blinks a few times, trying to clear his vision. “Cas? Cas! It’s okay, you’re not there. Baby, look at me. I’m right here. You’re okay. Just look.” Finally, Dean’s face comes into view, drawn with concern, and Cas manages a wheezing breath, his cries quieting. Dean must notice, because a little bit of relief leaks into his expression. “Hey, hey, focus on me. You with me baby?” He tries to nod, and he must succeed somewhat, because Dean sighs, stroking his cheek lightly. “Good. You’re safe, okay? I’m right here. No one is going to hurt you.” Unable to respond, Cas whimpers and grabs onto him tightly, feeling the anxious pounding of Dean’s heart through his chest. Dean shushes him softly, holding him close as he trembles. “I’ve got you. It’s okay. Just take it easy. I’m not letting anything happen to you.” Surrounded by Dean’s scent, the knot in Cas’ chest loosens, and he manages to wrestle his breathing back under his control, though he can’t seem to stop the little tremors that run through him. Dean runs a hand through his hair gently, humming softly in an attempt to soothe him and waiting patiently until Cas sniffs and looks up. “You alright?” he murmurs, gently pushing his hair back.
I have to laugh at that image in my head. “Well he didn’t react nearly as badly as I was expecting, so I guess they’re working.” He nods, pleased that I’ve noticed. Sam comes in, still in pajamas and rubbing the sleep from his eyes. “Morning,” I greet him.
“I know,” Dean answers. “Go slow.” He sets Cas down on the toilet, and the other man looks up at him, flushing with embarrassment. He smiles, leaning in to kiss his forehead softly. “I’ll go wait for you in the playroom,” he says. “Meet me there when you’re ready, okay?”
Dean smiled a little. “Yeah. No, I mean…I’d love to.” He hesitated. “Cas, if…before you decide you want me to stay, I…I have something I need to tell you. You…might not want me here after.”
“No need for that, kiddo.” I frown, noticing the little slashes in his cheek, and instinct takes over. “Cas, can we take him to the bunker for a bit and clean him up? It might help with the overwhelming thing.”
When it’s been nearly twenty minutes he starts to get worried, and decides to make his way upstairs to check on him. Dean swipes his key card, opening the door to find a surprisingly empty room. He frowns, calling out for Cas, checking the bathroom and peeking in the closet before a small whimper catches his attention. He creeps slowly around the bed to find Cas on the floor, curled up where the bed meets the nightstand. He’s shaking all over, gasping for breath with wet tracks down his face. “Cas!” Dean reaches out for him, but he flinches away from his hand, whimpering again. He pulls back, frowning. “Cas, can you hear me?” He doesn’t answer, just curls up tighter and sobs, and something in Dean’s chest tightens as he looks around for anything that might help. He spots Cas’ phone on the table and grab for it, searching through the contacts quickly. “Alright baby, hang in there. I’m gonna get you some help, okay?”
He felt Cas take a shuddery breath, fingers twisting into his flannel shirt as he clung onto the human tightly. “D-Dean...?”
I roll my eyes, patting Cas on the back as he coughs up the rest of what he inhaled. “Hey Dean?” Sam says quietly. “Can I talk to you for a minute?” I nod, leaving Cas to argue with Gabriel. “You asked him to marry you?” he asks in disbelief once we’re far enough away.
For some reason, Dean’s easy acceptance of what he’d done helps the shame disappear, and he nods. “You…really thought so?” Cas whispers.
After a minute they both sank down to the bed, still breathing hard, bodies loose and sated as Dean sprawled over Cas’ chest, listening to the thud of the heart under his cheek. He basked in the glow for what felt like a long time, cataloging the differences between now and what he’d remembered. The biggest difference was that Cas was still here under him, eyes closed, looking for all the world like he’d be content to lay here forever. He’d made no attempt to push Dean off, and instead seemed to be holding him close, one hand carding through his hair as the other traced nonsensical, swirling patterns over his back, an excuse to keep touching him. He hadn’t even bothered to pull out after he’d finished, and, if Dean’s hazy memory served, may have even pressed in deeper, as if he’d wanted to stay as close as he could for as long as possible. Dean found himself enjoying that thought, and the sensation of Cas’ cock slowly softening inside him was strangely satisfying. He felt blindly for the teeth marks on his shoulder, pressing down lightly, the dull pain telling him they would bruise and leave a mark, another thought he enjoyed. He pressed on the spot a little harder, remembering how Cas had claimed him in the last frenzied second before orgasm, and his spent cock twitched where it was trapped between them, making a valiant effort to express its approval. It hadn’t been the first time someone had claimed him that way. But it was the first time he’d actually wanted to be claimed; the first time that anyone claimed him as more than a hole to fuck or a toy to use. Cas was claiming all of him, and the knowledge that it was Dean who’d turned sweet, gentle, mild-mannered Cas into a dirty-talking and possessive version was equal parts funny and sexy. He laughed, softly at first, then gradually louder, and felt Cas’ chest rumble as he chuckled. “What’s so funny?”
Dean laughs softly, starting to massage the muscles of Cas’ neck. “Don’t worry; I intend to.” He works all the way down his body, smiling at the soft, pleased noises escaping the man under him. By the time he’s done, Cas is a half-asleep pile of jelly under his palms. “How’s that feel?” he asks softly.
I sigh, gently lifting his chin. “I’m not mad at you,” I assure him. “You were scared, and trying to protect yourself. You’re still learning, Dean, I would never be mad at you for that. Plus, you’re not used to having someone to turn to when it comes to your father. This is all new. The question now is what do you want to do about him?”
He considered the unconscious angel on the bed for a long moment before nodding. “Okay. It’s worth a shot, at least. Thanks. And sorry for bailing on you guys, I just...I needed some time to process, you know?”
I shower and dry off quickly, a little apprehensive about what he’s doing. When I go downstairs he’s sitting on a bench in the playroom waiting for me. Before I can say anything he motions me over, holding up a plate of food. I sit down cautiously, watching him as I start to eat. After a few minutes he chuckles. “You look nervous.”
Gabriel looks down sheepishly. “Sorry I tried to attack you, Dean. Thank you for helping my brother.”
Dean nodded, coming to a stop in front of him. “I’m sure. I need to show you the truth. Please.”
Cas didn’t look angry, at least, but he did look confused. “You...had to?” he repeated slowly. “The Empty could have killed you...that was such a stupid idea, to try to rescue me. Why would you do that?”
, he wrote, hoping Cas wasn’t angry about his reaction.

“How long did you spend teasing yourself, Dean?” I murmur, sliding just close enough for him to feel the heat of my body.
(See the end of the chapter for
I shake my head, swallowing hard, and I feel him smile against my skin, sucking lightly at my Adam’s apple. “Cas,” I manage, “You don’t have to…”
Cas smiles, nodding. “I know. That’s alright. You’re trying. That’s what matters. Can you tell me what you see?”
“I love you too. You sure you’re okay?”
“Are you going to take it with me?” Cas asks before he can stop himself.
“Is that…something you want to do?” I ask cautiously.
I laugh as they fold back obediently. “Look, you’re already getting the hang of it.”
GREETINGS, FRIENDS! I have not forsaken you. Sorry for the unintentional hiatus, life has been kicking my ass the last few months. But It's the holiday season and I'm back! This is more of a middle chapter before some big things start happening in the next few, so enjoy!
Dean felt himself flush, glad that Benny was too preoccupied with his exam to notice. “That’s what Cas said. I don’t know why.”
“It means you need to stop hating yourself!” he snarls back.
“That’s what you are, huh?”
After a long moment he nods a little. “Y-Yeah,” he whispers back. “I think so.”
He shrugs, his wing curling around him again. “I’ve always told you how powerful the human soul can be. When I pulled you from hell, you were scared and in pain and desperate. Those are powerful emotions. So when I grabbed you, and you realized that I was trying to rescue you, you grabbed onto me for dear life. That kind of pure emotion left an impression on me, both literally and figuratively speaking. And when you touched my wing before, it was like my Grace was reaching out for you. Like it remembered what we went through together, and now that it’s damaged, it…wanted to connect with you again.” He ducks his head. “Just an idea, really. I can’t say for sure. But it wasn’t…unpleasant at all.”
“I panicked for a minute there,” Dean admits. “But Cas calmed me down. I think I’m okay, actually. How about you?”
“Okay, okay, I won’t,” he murmurs, adopting that same soothing tone that I both enjoy and hate. “Just relax and stay still for a moment. I’m not going anywhere.” The idea of this is slightly comforting, and I try to take his advice. After a moment, the pain fades to a dull roar. “Cas?” he says cautiously. “Can you tell me what happened?”
“Yes,” he admits, “But Dean, you aren’t attracted to men.”
Cas nods. “Well, you’ve done an excellent job of caring for him your whole lives. But sometimes we can’t fix everything alone. That doesn’t mean you’re a bad big brother.”
“Not much point,” he answers teasingly. “You’ll only need another one later. We’re conserving water.”
“So…It’s not just for my sake?”
Cas knew he shouldn’t open the door, that seeing Dean’s face, watching the words come out of his mouth as he told the angel he hated him would shatter him beyond repair. He should refuse, or leave, or really anything besides comply with Dean’s request.
“So…you’re happy to spend forever coddling me, and, like, making me take baths and whatever?” he asks in disbelief
Sam sighs, nodding. “I know you would, Gabe. It’s okay. At least you’re here now.”
At the sink a small movement catches his eye, and he panics before he even recognizes the man in front of him, who grins. “Hello darling. Fancy meeting you here.”
I'M SO SORRY. This took forever, writer's block and life suck balls. But I hope you enjoy this one!
Cas glances at me, perplexed, and I shrug. “So…you’re not angry?” he asks.
I sigh, stroking his hair lightly. “I’ve promised you that we would not be mated until you were ready to be. My control is always somewhat fragile when I participate, and I was worried my instincts would get the better of me. I did not want to break that promise.”
"Dean," he starts again, "Thank you so much. I love you."
“I know, I know,” he chuckles. “You’re just a hopeless romantic, aren’t you?”
“I don’t know,” he pants softly. “I was just thinking about my family and everything, and how good you were for taking care of me, and I just needed you right then. I wasn’t sure if you’d be okay with…you know…”
Despite himself, Dean laughed softly. “Yeah, I always kinda thought so.” He sighed, pressing closer, too worn out to stop himself. The sharp pain in his chest and head were soothed by the solid warmth of Cas’ hold and the steady heartbeat he could feel under his cheek, and soon he found himself relaxing into the other man’s chest. Part of him was still frightened, worried that the closeness was unwanted now that Cas knew the truth, but then Cas smoothed a gentle hand down his spine, seeming to understand his need for reassurance, and that part fell silent.
In the morning, Dean wakes up to find Cas sprawled across his chest, pressed as close as possible. He chuckles, running his fingers lightly along his spine as he stirs. Cas purrs softly, blinking up at him. “Morning sweetheart,” Dean murmurs. He grins, leaning closer to kiss him softly. “I take it that means you’re feeling okay?”
Sam nods, going back to stabilizing the bones. Cas whimpers with each small shift, and his grip on me becomes almost painful. “Hurry up,” I mutter to Sam.
Cas smiles, snuggling into him further. “I love you too. Thank you for this.”
“Exactly,” he sighs. “That’s the problem with measuring yourself by the opinions of others. In Dean’s eyes, he was never good enough to please dad, and that’s sort of translated to being not good enough in general. And when he starts to remember those feelings he feels vulnerable, and he pushes people away so that he won’t get hurt again.”
Dean makes a thoughtful sound. “So whoever our witch is, they’re probably working in the school,” he muses.
“Chest,” I mumble.
Dean nods, squeezing Cas’ hand lightly. “Thank you. I’d like to see him, when we can.”
He shushes me, one of the hands wrapped around me shifting to comb through my hair. “I’m going to help you figure that out,” he assures me. “I just need you to focus on my voice. Trust me, Dean. I’m here.”
“You don’t have to justify it to me,” Cas smiled. “It’s okay to choose a different path.”
“Thank you, Gabriel. I’m going to put him to bed. I’m sure he’ll appreciate that.” He nods, and I carry Dean down the hall, carefully setting him down in bed and sitting beside him. He’s out cold for several hours before starting to stir, groaning softly. “Dean?” I ask cautiously.
“I’m fine,” Dean says. “I don’t know why you’d care, but I’m fine.”
I watch him curiously as he reaches for a bottle of lube beside the bed, spreading a little between his thumbs and forefingers. “Don’t you think you need a little more than that?”
Hello everyone! We're back again with a new chapter. Enjoy!
“How did you take advantage of it?” I ask quietly.
“Okay,” Cas answered calmly. “Why is that?”
Dean makes a sad noise, holding him closer. “That’s awful.”
I nod thoughtfully, glancing at the door. “I was under the impression that Dean and your father were rather close. Was that not true?”
A sliver of panic leaks into his voice. “I can’t. He’s afraid, he doesn’t want to go, and I can’t force him. Someone did this to him, and I couldn’t stop it, and I don’t know…Please, Benny. I need your help. I can’t do this by myself.”
“I’d have to agree,” I chuckle, starting to set the table. I can feel John watching us, but he seems more confused than angry, which I’m taking as a good sign. “Anyway, we’ve been a team for a long time, and back when I had my powers I always tried to look out for Sam and Dean.”
“Why do you think you feel like that?” Dean asks.
We pass through the living room on the way, and I can feel Sam’s eyes on me and Cas’ curiosity, but neither of them say anything. Dad gasps softly as we enter the library. “Wow...this is...”
He laughs, smiling fondly at Gabriel, asleep in his chair. “Yeah, I’ve noticed. Thanks, Cas.” He sighs, picking up another book. “Come on, let’s figure this out.”
“What did?” I ask curiously.
A laugh bubbles up out of him. “It’s about damn time!”
“Hm?”
“Yes Sir,” I murmur, forcing myself to relax. “I’m fine.”
“Okay. Everywhere? Like, absolutely everywhere? Like, if someone wants to lick your ass, you’d be okay with that?”
He shrugs, looking away. “I’ve…done things, Cas. There’s a reason I ended up in hell. If those are my soul, they wouldn’t look like that.”
“This is your home, Dean, and your family,” I remind him gently. “What you say goes. You’re not a child anymore, and he doesn’t get to control you just because he’s your father. I don’t know how or why he’s back, but that doesn’t mean you owe him anything. If you don’t want him staying here you’d be perfectly justified in telling him to leave, especially considering what he’s put you through in the past. But I want you to think about what you want, not him, or Sam, or me, or what you think you should do.”
When Dean woke in the morning, Cas was curled up beside him, sleeping soundly, and for a moment Dean panicked that it wasn’t real; that if he shifted the wrong way he might shatter the illusion. He was just working up the courage to move when Cas stirred, his nose wrinkling (adorably, Dean thought) before his eyes opened. He smiled softly when he caught sight of the hunter. “Good morning, Dean.”
Gabriel makes a thoughtful sound. “I still can’t believe it.”
Cas nods, kissing the back of my neck. “What if you did know what you were doing?” he asks. “Would that make you less nervous?”
I nod, slowly opening my eyes and turning to see his concerned expression. “Y-Yeah, I think so. I’m so…”
The protectiveness in the words sends an odd warmth through my chest. “It wasn’t their fault, Dean. You know how humans can get when things happen that they don’t understand. Angels aren’t all that different in that respect. It happened again when they went black, but then I knew better.”
She takes them to a smaller room where Gabriel is pacing, and the panicked expression on his face seems to alarm even Dean. He moves quickly when he sees them, grabbing onto Cas tightly. “Did they say anything?”
Cas raises an eyebrow at him. “Performer?”
“Please…” Dean rasps, sighing when Cas slides his pants down to pool around his ankles.
“It’s nothing, Dean,” he says softly.
“What on earth are you talking about?” I ask, puzzled at his sudden anxiousness. “The mate thing?”
I take a couple of deep breaths to calm the fire running through my veins while he inspects me, desperate to see what he might do. He makes soft, thoughtful noises as he moves, occasionally reaching out to tail his fingers over my skin. He crosses back in front of me, smirking as he glances down at the little bead of precum forming. It takes every ounce of self-control I have to stay still while he gathers the drop on his finger and sticks it in his mouth, making a thoughtful sound.
He shakes his head. “None at all. It’s refreshing. Did Dean ever come home?”
It was that question that made the angel drag his gaze up from the floor. “I...I’m not sure I understand...”
“You just…know,” he says. I look at him doubtfully, and he sighs. “Alright, if you don’t know you can ask me, okay? But I really think you’re making this harder on yourself than it has to be.”
“Okay then…I’ll be in the kitchen.” I turn towards the door, trying to figure out why something feels wrong here.
Claire brightens, hugging him tightly. “Thank you, Daddy! I love you so much.”
The hands that landed on his shoulders were smaller than he expected, and Rowena folded elegantly to the floor to his left, Eileen on his right. The witch waved her hands over Cas’ unconscious form. “He seems alright to me,” she assessed. “I’m guessing he just needs a little time to reorganize himself.”
“That doesn’t usually happen,” Dean frowns. “Is something wrong?”
I help him up, walking him down the hall. He starts going into his room, but I hold onto his arm. “Cas? This way.”
Cas scowled, fixing him with a glare. “I’m aware that you find me truly disgusting, Dean. There’s no need to discuss it any further. I’ll still be available to use my powers when you need them, and in the interim, you can drop the charade of finding my presence at all enjoyable.”
He makes a sound of approval, snuggling close. “Good story,” he murmurs.
I consider it. “As far as I’m aware.”
A brief smile lights up Dean’s face, and he’s rewarded with a lightly swipe of fingers against the back of his neck. He hears the clink of the fork on the plate before there’s a forkful of food in front of him. He regards it carefully, unsure of what to do until Dean’s gruff command of “Open.” Though initially mortified at being fed, the shame starts to fade when Cas realizes he likes it, and he willingly takes the food that’s put in front of him. After dinner Dean picks up a small bowl of fruit, spearing a grape with his fork and offering it silently to Cas, who takes it happily. Then the fork disappears, and a chunk of pineapple is in front of him, except it’s suspended between Dean’s fingers. Cas gasps softly, feeling his already half-hard cock waking up at the idea. Dean doesn’t mention it, just rests the edge of the fruit against Cas’ bottom lip and waits for him to accept it. Closing his eyes, he leans forward, taking the fruit into his mouth along with Dean’s fingers, which he suckles lightly, the pineapple mixing with the taste of him, salty and warm and very pleasant. He can’t help the soft, low moan that escapes him. Dean makes a small, surprised sound, and Cas tenses, wondering if he’s done something wrong, but the gentle stroke through his hair and Dean’s soft chuckle settle his nerves. “God Cas, you’re perfect,” he murmurs. Cas blushes under the praise, letting his cheek rest against Dean’s knee and his eyes close, obediently accepting whatever is offered to him and being sure to thoroughly clean Dean’s fingers after each piece.
Sam sighs. “I mean, she’s not exactly killing anyone…I want her dead too, but we can’t exactly take them with us, and we can’t leave them unattended. Let’s figure out how to fix them, and then we’ll come back and deal with the witch.” I nod, carrying Dean out to the car. He brightens at the sight of it, patting the hood softly before I climb in with him. Sam buckles Gabriel in beside us, who whines and pokes at the belt. “Shit,” Sam murmurs, “We need to go shopping. We need, like…car seats, and clothes and whatever.”
There’s an odd silence that creeps throughout the garage, only Dean’s wrench cranking making any noise.
“But hey, get this. I think I found another case. This one’s outside of Dallas, multiple farmers waking up to their animal’s dead and...”
Cas nodded knowing that-that made sense for him.
“He’s scared…”
“Jack you’re scaring the hell outta me...”
“So you failed your first big test, it’s okay. That’s part of the whole schooling experience and you’ve never really had any of that. So chalk it up as an L and learn what you did wrong then move on.”
Jack shrugs, “Guess so. Kinda feel like this is a trap though, it was easy to find.”
“You’re just now noticing that?” Gabriel stood, and with a wave of his hand, he was clad in jeans, the now-dry sweat shorts folded neatly in his hand. “As much as I like wearing your clothes, wet isn’t my favorite texture. And Sam, I really am sorry about not saying something after the first time. I was…kind of embarrassed, and I didn’t think about how you’d feel about it.”
“I need your spoken consent, Dean. Explicit consent. Not an ‘I guess,’” Cas said, using finger quotes, one of his fingers still wet.
“Yeah. Doing. They’re still in him. Get moving. The sooner we can get him someplace stable, the sooner we can get them out of him.” Gabe crouched down and managed to scoop Cas up, black wings dragging on the ground.
More muffled noises, then another voice Dean recognized. “Hello?”
“I guess.”
“What do you mean?”
Dean sighed. This was it. “She wanted to stay. Help Bobby.”
“No wing flaps,” Dean argued. “Believe me, my ears are attuned to that sound.”
to ‘that Christmas movie.’ It’s so much more.”
Cas is a post-rules version of himself. He's become comfortable with choice and free will, and is maybe a little anti-rules. Dean is still in the “this is the way it’s done” (as canon Dean used to be with hunting), but starts to see the gray—not everything is black and white. He's also just starting to realize he’s in what we in the biz call publishing hell: no autonomy, no creative control, and you do what your publisher wants or else.
“When you choose freely, when you
“It seemed like a good plan.”
Dean raised his eyebrows at Sam, whose expression said
Castiel wasn’t sure where the words came from, or even who said them, but he felt something shift in the energy around them.
“See, I think my grace is about all I’m good for.” Gabriel looked away. “I’ve got nothing to offer in your fight in the apocalypse world except maybe as a distraction, buy you some time. That’d be a suicide mission for me. Without my grace, or without it at full power, I’m nobody, guys.”
Sam thought he knew what Cas was up to. Ever the strategist, Cas was moving to a point that would place Rowena in the center of a triangle. If she kept her attention on him, she left her rear unguarded. It also took her attention away from Dean.
“How…” Sam started to say. “How do we…heal those? Can you heal with the implant?”
“I want that ass in pristine condition when you get here,” Dean said, adding a bit of a growl to his voice. As he’d hoped, Cas laughed, and the sound was like the best music.
“I think what Dean’s trying to say,” Sam broke in, “is that because you’re not Jewish, you don’t have to follow the Jewish holidays.”
Immediately, Cas was between them, blade raised. “That’s not possible,” he growled. “And you will leave Dean alone.”
“I’m not finished. I didn’t think I mattered. For a long time. I didn’t think…” Cas paused, let out a long breath. “Well, it doesn’t matter what I thought. It was wrong. I made mistakes but they’re not
“I’m sorry, Dean. Sam never got the chance to marry Jess before she was killed. They never had children.”
“I don’t know, Dean. A demon, perhaps? Shape-shifter?”
He held his hands in front of him, palms out and fingers splayed but relaxed. “May I?” he asked, glancing at Cas’ face and then at the soft-looking covert feathers.
“Thank you for trusting me,” Sam said. “Can you show me where the activity is happening?”
“Pain in the ass?”
have noticed it. That it molded itself to your new reality, allowed you to feel more, experience more,
After packing the wounds with sterile gauze and then wrapping them as tightly as he dared with ace bandages woven through the flight feathers, Dean took a deep breath and tried to release some of the tension in his body. He even thought about shaking his hands out the way Cas had shown him, but he wanted to wait until Cas actually woke up before he considered relaxing.
“Nothing of importance. Please drive the routes to the Capitol Mall a couple more times. I’m working out some ideas.”
Borrowing Dean’s own hunter training, Castiel eased into the lie. “We at social services know that you’re doing an impressive job taking care of your brother. However, our supervisor requires statistics, and wants us to keep track of the ages of our best minor caregivers. So I just need your current age and I’ll be on my way.”
“So you studied that?” Sam asked. “Mussar?”
for an international flight?”
“Which blade, Dean?”
Dean sat back down and quickly wrote a note above his signature, then handed the book back with a grin. He watched Carmen regroup with some friends and gesture excitedly back toward him. Feeling far more confident, he returned to the line of people waiting for him to sign their books, which was now much longer than Cas’ had been.
“Yeah.” Sam chuckled. “I’m starting to get that.” He let out a long breath. “Well, maybe once Dean and Cas have dealt with their crap, we can talk about next steps with the ACAA.”
There was no sense of time as Cas worked the muscles and tissue, and Dean was only half-aware when Cas’ thumbs pressed slightly into his crack, pulling the cheeks apart tenderly and massaging around his hole. The feeling was rhythmic and smooth, and despite the sense that Cas was scrutinizing his most private area, he was able to stay relaxed. He felt Cas’ fingers, then, as they rubbed over his hole, pressing but not breaching. It had never occurred to him before that an asshole could be massaged, but it was in fact a muscle.
“Nice, easy breath in through your nose,” Sam said in a soft voice. “Let it all out through your mouth.” He waited patiently for Castiel to follow the instructions, then asked, “What did you notice?”
Breathing heavily, Cas started moving, whimpering with each thrust. “Dean, you feel… I never knew… It’s so good.”
Sam shrugged. “I just…I don’t want you to go.”
At his silent question, all the doors save one faded into translucency. The one that didn’t grew larger and closer, the door opening wider as it seemed to approach him. He entered, curious, unafraid. Energy swirled around and near him, formless but intentional. With the intention came words.
to the guy, since he was still just off enough that he didn’t come across as human… No. Dean refused to think about the consequences.
“He said he wasn’t ready to talk about it.”
“All right,” Dean said, “where are we gonna set up this trap?”
Dean reached under his waistband, consequences be damned, and was panting just from the anticipation of jerking off to Cas’ moans next to him, when the moans turned to anguish.
“You tried before, right? How is this time going to be different?”
“I’ll look them over, Dean. I can give you my legal advice and then my brotherly advice, but you know they might not advise the same course of action. You’re in a cutthroat business that likes to chew up authors and spit them out when they stop earning enough money.”
Dean was more familiar with the authors who were published by the larger New York publishers, especially PRHB, who published his Beast Hunters series. But even he had heard of CJ Novak, who somehow managed to make trending lists on social media whenever a new book came out. CJ rarely did appearances, though, and there were never any author photos available. In fact, Dean had been certain CJ was a woman.
The guy was in the same clothes, staring into his cup of coffee like it held the secrets of the universe. Which, you know, maybe it did. Coffee was magical in the morning. He looked up as they approached and seemed not at all surprised to see them there. Medium brown hair. Gray eyes. “Gentlemen,” he greeted in a baritone voice. “Would you care to join me for some biscuits?”
“I’ll get both,” Sam said as he jumped up from the table. “And plates. You guys can…do your thing.”
“You find something?” Dean asked.
“Your wings?”
Castiel sighed.
Sam thought in response.
“In Hebrew, it’s Kaftziel. His name has to do with speed, moving quickly from one space-time to another. In Latin, it’s Cassiel.”
“What are you gonna do then, Cas? If Heaven dies, do you keep being an angel? And if you become human again, what happens when you die?”
Working carefully, Sam cleaned the abraded wounds, a little impressed that Gabriel didn’t even wince. Which meant that his wings must hurt a whole lot more. He covered the abrasions with a liberal amount of triple-antibiotic cream, then wrapped them in sterile gauze, finishing them off with a bit of surgical tape.
“Because it’s not about the effort. It’s about the intention. Be your best. Do your best. Offer your best. And know that your best is different than mine.”
Cas tilted his head slightly and seemed to gaze, unfocused, across the room. “It does make sense.”
“I understand,” Castiel said, figuring this Dean must see Sam in the room the same way they wouldn’t see the photos in the stairway or the other rooms in the hall. “No one has come here to talk with you?”
The checkpoint at the Iowa-Minnesota state line just outside the barely-there town of Bigelow was little more than a small-town cop accompanied by another one of those strangely-uniformed demons, and Dean gave himself a silent pat on the back for sticking to back roads. The cop only asked for ID this time, not requiring Cas to exit the car or be subjected to any more pain or humiliation.
He broke open the capsule under Dean’s nose and tried not to inhale the noxious smell.
“Wait.” Dean snapped his fingers. “My door has a lock.” He stood quickly, went to his nightstand, and pulled out a skeleton key from the drawer. “All the doors in the bunker have these old mortise locks,” he explained, going to the door, slipping the key in, and wiggling it until it turned with a
“So now it’s my turn, huh? Gotta put myself back together?”
“It is. You visiting? Tourist?”
“No.” Gabe shook his head.
“Go, go, go!” Dean shouted, pushing Sam, then Cas through the rift. He grabbed his mother’s hand, but she pulled back.
Cas drew back and Dean felt a cool breeze across his skin, his body wanting to reach out for Cas but pinned to the tree trunk. “Are you inviting me in?”
“What made you want to be an author?” Cas asked as they strolled along the wide sidewalk dotted with trees and outdoor seating from another restaurant. A breeze had picked up as the sun set and they stopped by the hotel long enough for Cas to grab his coat—an ugly,
“More than once,” Dean admitted. “Tried everything in the book, and a few I made up on my own. Hell is preferable to this.” He gestured carelessly around the room and let his hand fall to the floor. “I’m not worth saving, man. You see that now, don’t you?”
“Or right,” Lover Dean said.
a couple of cuts!” Barb insisted, using what Sam had to assume was her mom voice.
Dean laughed. “He’s three. I don’t think he’s supposed to have common sense yet.”
thought came with guilt. Sam and Dean needed him to find and stop Jack. And given Dean’s earlier outbursts, he might be the only thing preventing Dean from killing Jack. He continued along the heavily forested path, thinking about Jack. Jack, who’d killed a pet snake out of misguided compassion, who’d clearly tortured Nick before killing him, who’d killed Mary, who may not have a soul anymore. Jack, who was possibly the most powerful being in the universe right now, could conceivably wipe out the planet with less effort than it would have taken the alternate-world Michael, and yet Castiel still thought there was hope for him.
do? I’m a hunter; you’re a warrior. We kill things. And if we’re really, really lucky, maybe we save a few lives.”
She swiped it, printed a receipt, and gave him a key. “You’re in room nine, down at the end. It’s quieter down there.” Handing back his card, she smiled. “You have a nice stay, Mr. Gibbons.”
“If you know a car’s torque, RPM, and five-thousand, two hundred and fifty-two, you can figure out the horsepower. And if you know the horsepower and RPM, you can figure out the torque.”
Making himself visible only to the boy, he fell into step beside him. “Fear not,” he began, as the boy startled upon seeing him. “I am an angel of the Lord. I have an important message for you.”
He nods slowly. “But…what if I don’t go to heaven? I mean, I’ve done things, and the last time…”
“Uh…yeah. Sure thing,” I assure him, though I’m not entirely sure of what I’m agreeing to. “We can get you cleaned up after dinner if you want.”
Dean yelps as my fingers find his prostate, rubbing over it hard. “Yes, yes, fuck
Cas chuckled, wrapping an arm around him. “The first of many. Can I try?” Dean nodded, ignoring the twinge of nervousness in his stomach as Cas moved closer, and forgetting it completely when Cas kissed him. “How’s that?” he asked.
I nod, shifting to kiss him softly. “It did. Thanks. It’s a good story.”
A sigh of relief escapes Dean, and he nods. “Thank you so much. The door is open. I’ll see you soon.”
“Did you know there’s multiple ways to orgasm?” he says conversationally. Cas whimpers, shaking his head as his hips rock back of their own accord. “Not everyone can do it,” he continues. “But you just did. And since there’s no refractory time this way, theoretically, I can make you do that as many times as you want to. What do you think?” Cas doesn’t answer, his eyes rolling back as he shudders through a second orgasm, bewildered at how the slow, gentle motions could start such a fire in him and eagerly pushing back for more. Dean chuckles, happily obliging. “Good, isn’t it?” he murmurs. “I’ll keep going as long as you want. You just tell me when you’re ready to stop, and once you’re coherent again I’ll explain.”
He thinks about it, then nods. “Okay. Let’s get this over with then.”
It’s the pain that has him ripping the shower curtain to the side, and Dean nearly flinched at the motion, and at the storm still brewing in the angel’s expression. “Worried about me. Right.” Dean took a deep breath before trying to respond, but his current state of undress made the human flush and look away quickly, in what Cas could only assume was revulsion. The shame burned through him, hot and sticky, and on its heels was the anger. A bitter laugh escaped the angel, and he shook his head, heading for the door. “Excuse me. I’m sure you’d rather not speak to me without a few more layers between us.” In truth, he’d like to put on every item of clothing he could find, or maybe bury himself under a pile of blankets, where Dean could never look at him like that again, where he could figure out how to squeeze all these emotions back inside their cage where they belonged.
He nods. “I know.” I watch him for another minute before sighing and sitting down beside him. He looks over, surprised. “What are you doing?”
I nod, standing to grab towels from under the sink. “Well, I’m glad you came. Now, how do you want to…” I turn back to find him standing there, stark naked. “Um…nevermind.”
I shake my head. “Don’t have to move…just need to feel you… please.”
He shrugs, and I watch as he curiously pulls back the waist of Gabriel’s pants a little. “Count your blessings, Cas. At least they’re old enough to be mostly potty trained.”
There’s silence on the other end for a moment. “Well shit,” Charlie murmured finally. “I was kinda hoping we were wrong about that one. Actually, I...may have found something too. I was looking through the missing persons reports, and I started noticing a pattern. Every now and then it seems like the number of cases that go unsolved goes way up, and during those times there’s a lot more boys and young men going missing. Most of them are between 15 and 25. It looks like the rise happens for a couple of weeks, and then the numbers go back down for a while. So far I haven’t found anything linking the unfound victims, and it doesn’t seem like anyone else has noticed the pattern yet.”
