They had had plenty of experiences since then, and this one, in John’s bedroom as the Mario Kart theme tune played in the background, was as brilliant as ever. Sherlock had been tossing him off for about ten minutes and John had been so close to coming that he had had to literally scream at Sherlock to stop. It wasn’t just the actual feel of Sherlock’s hand walking him off, though Sherlock was incredible at that; it was the sight of Sherlock’s hand wrapped around his dick, only the head poking out, violinist fingers wrapped securely around him.
Sherlock paused and looked at John for a long moment, seemingly deliberating something. ‘I can…I can tell your life story.’ Sherlock whispered.
Sherlock picked up his youngest son and twirled him around, laughing as the toddler shouted in excitement, his black curls flying everywhere. Sherlock put him down and made a funny face at him; Jacob clapped his hands together, his eyes shining. Out of all Sherlock’s children, Jacob was the only one with Violet’s eyes.
John lays a comforting hand on his daughter’s arm, but Nathaniel has already stepped forward, clutching his gift in his hands. ‘Good morning, Daddy,’ he says formally. ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever come to see you and it’s very exciting. My name’s Nathaniel, and I’m your son, but you probably knew that because Papa says you loved me lots even though I wasn't born yet. Everyone says we’re very alike, so you must have been very cool.’ Despite himself John snorts, and Nathaniel looks up in disgust. ‘Please, Papa, don’t.’ He turns back to the grave and whispers, ‘he’s impossible. I bet if you weren't dead me and you would’ve made his life horrible, right?’ He pauses and John’s stomach twists because as grown-up as Nathaniel pretends he is, he still believes that his Daddy might answer him.
‘You’re everything to me, John, and I’m doing this for you, you must understand that. You can’t die, you’re far too good, valuable, kind, courageous.’
‘But-but-that’s absurd!’ John shook his head, sure Greg had misheard. ‘She was killed, Greg. We all learn about it at school. She was at Dreydon palace, in the West country. Sherlock and Mycroft were both in the palace, god knows where, and a man snuck in and shot her and then himself. Charles Magnusson, remember? They found his body in her room.’
John had seen it before, of course; he had to walk past it to get to Molly’s house. He had even stood in the courtyard, with Sherlock just a few metres away on the balcony. But it still struck him every time as the biggest, most ornate palace he had ever seen in his entire life.
He could tell Sherlock was trying not to smile, but as usual it didn’t work: the smile broke onto his face, lighting it up, and John started painting the rainbow. ‘I didn’t consent!’ His boyfriend whined, and John touched the tip of the paintbrush to his nose. ‘Don’t whine. You were always going to let me.’
He’s not speaking to Sherlock anymore, he’s speaking to Sherlock’s left, and Sherlock’s anger is dying. He
Obviously no one had expected them to get accepted into the trial so quickly, or for their surrogate to fall pregnant so effectively, but on Mycroft’s twenty-fourth birthday their twin boys, Christopher Zachary and Ezra Sherlock Lestrade-Holmes had been born, Christopher with light brown hair and big blue/green eyes and Ezra with a mop of black curls and dark eyes, just like Lestrade’s.
There were jokes from Mike and some of the younger teens, pretending to be surprised, but John hadn't cared. From the moment he had stepped on the resort that July, him and Sherlock had been inevitable. Hell, from the moment John had stepped on the resort that July six years ago, when he was only twelve years old, him and Sherlock had been inevitable.
The image of Sherlock’s smiling face appeared in front of John’s eyes. John quickly wiped it from his memory; he couldn’t think of Sherlock.
Because it was so late, there was no time to explore the resort and they went straight to bed. John was told he could share his mother’s bed but Harry instantly shot that down (
‘John, my brother.’ Harry looked around the room: the conversations had restarted, and John felt slightly less uncomfortable. ‘I’m fourteen, he’s twelve.’
‘A letter came, Lord Sherlock,’ Colin replies. ‘Delivered by a man of…a man of your situation.’ He pauses. ‘He had a look of madness, if I can say, my Lord.’
‘No.’ He answered bitterly. ‘No, my father doesn’t know. You saw what he did down there. He’d be repulsed. He wouldn’t allow it; he’d force me to marry some noble woman, and possibly disown me. I can’t be who I am, John, because of my father, and I really can’t handle anymore homophobia. I understand that you find it uncomfortable. I understand that you don’t like gay people. I just don’t- I can’t handle anymore shit about my sexuality, especially not from you.’ He was trembling by the time he was finished because he couldn't have John not accepting who he was, he really and truly could not, and please God let John not be homophobic because if Sherlock had to choose between John Watson and himself-
‘My,’ Lestrade had said quietly from behind him, jogging Ezra gently on his hip, ‘what exactly do you think they’re going to be doing during the ten minute drive to Sherwood?’
‘Don’t!’ Mycroft almost shouted, standing up. His ridiculously expensive chair flew backwards, whacking into the equally as expensive cabinet, and an even pricier vase fell off, crashing onto the floor in a million expensive pieces. Mycroft sighed and settled himself firmly in his seat. ‘Now look what you’ve done, brother mine. That was a gift from the emperor of Bhutan when Princess Madeline was born.’
happened with Sherlock before. Before it could get too bad, however, Sherlock looked back up and said, facing the lake so John still couldn't see his eyes, ‘Will you miss me?’
Sherlock hadn't felt this nervous about a decision for years, if ever. He’d been planning it for so long that he hadn't really noticed that he was running out of time until James had turned to him in Chemistry and said, ‘so what did you decide?’
Sherlock smiled back and shook Henry’s hand firmly; the soldier seemed delighted. ‘No offence, Prince-‘
‘Hmm.’ John mumbled. He didn’t want to say he agreed, just in case Harry decided to tell their mother. ‘Sometimes. Some of them.’
It was a ten minute walk to Bart’s, the café he had planned to meet Mike at. He hadn’t seen much of his friend outside school over the past few months; Mike had landed one of the highly valued jobs as a guard at the palace, and his schedule was insane. Despite living just twenty minute walk from Buckingham palace, John had never seen any of the main royals; they kept themselves locked up, hardly daring to leave the safety of their palace in case-
Smith eventually excused himself, rubbing his eyes before standing up straight, arms held stiffly at his side. Even in grief, he was a soldier, and he even saluted before he walked out into the cold of the Desert night, facing a life without the man he loved, and John had never pitied someone as he pitied Smith in that moment.
John didn’t say anything as Sherlock smiled at his grandmother before making an excuse to leave and then made his way to the stairs, simply following him slowly. As Sherlock navigated the hallways he attempted to talk to the older boy, but John just answered with a single word or ignored him altogether. Sherlock had no idea what was wrong with him: did he think
John smiled, that little side-smile that made Sherlock want to laugh and cry, all at the same time. ‘I know. God, Sherlock, I know, I know,
John had seemed surprised when he had seen him topless, though Sherlock didn’t know why; there was a reason his shirts were so tight, after all. He was muscular but lean, so he still seemed thin, but to Sherlock, at least, it was clear he was not just skin and bone.
Sherlock’s oar cut silently into the water, propelling them forwards, as John splashed and swore and tried to stay balanced in the back. ‘
He had been so consumed with guilt and rage that he hadn’t even noticed that the door had been opened.
Everyone knew how Mycroft and Violet cared for each other. He was wearing this black suit, his hair was combed and he just stood there, crying quietly, as everyone sobbed around him.’
‘The first was my oldest friend.’ Sherlock said. ‘You may have seen him; I was outside with him just now.’
Molly Hooper wrenched Irene Adler’s arm, pulled her until they were facing each other, and kissed her.
‘I didn’t turn you over,’ Sherlock said seriously. ‘You at least owe me that. You seem vaguely intriguing.’
especially because Irene Adler was apparently three months younger than him and had caused almost as much scandal in her part of Britain as Sherlock had in the whole Kingdom.
‘I didn’t mean too!’ Sherlock yelled. ‘I was in love-’ realising what he was saying, he shut up, but it was too late.
None of them knew who John’s boyfriend was, of course. It was still a secret, a very well kept secret, and John had been told before he'd left that he couldn't tell anyone. Sherlock’s family and staff knew, John’s family knew, but the news that the newly crowned King had a boyfriend had not been revealed to the public. Surprisingly, it had been Sherlock who had made this decision; his new advisor, a good looking blond named Sebastian Moran, had said that it would be perfectly ok if Sherlock wanted to come out. John couldn’t pretend he wasn’t a little hurt; he had hoped that with Sherlock as King they wouldn’t have to hide their love anymore, but if Sherlock believed it was necessary…
The building was small, with only one room, and John couldn't help but wonder at the number of teenagers crammed into it. There were ten older teenagers aged between about 16-18 in one corner, another group of about fifteen in the 13-15 age range in another and over twenty in the last half of the room. The children in this half were John’s age or a year younger and were crowded around a tall boy about John’s age with a shock of dark, curly hair and really
‘You’ve allowed yourself to feel sentiment, though.’ Mycroft said, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. ‘For John Hamish Watson. In fact, you’ve allowed it more than once. Didn't you feel it for-‘
’s, and it was just the three of them in the room, fathers and son, until Ella reappeared quietly in the doorway. ‘Here she is, boys.’
After all their issues with Jim Moriarty, Sherlock had been all for exiling Irene, but surprisingly John had asked for her to stay on. She had become Sherlock’s advisor just before Christopher was born and had served him well since then; the kids loved her, John and her seemed to actually like each other and even Mycroft seemed to have got past his dislike for her.
‘Why do you have a picture of you and the King?’ Becca asked. John felt a stab of horror and then a sort of relief; it had been her who took the picture, at least he knew that now. ‘Can we talk about this later? I have a life to save.’
John was confused; the King couldn’t be dead, he was fine, he’d been on the balcony two days before they got the letter. He wasn’t too old, he was healthy, how was he dead?
Lestrade hesitated then turned back to Sherlock. ‘Fair enough. Sher, maybe you should just let My take you.’
Two years is a long time for two teenagers. Sherlock had kissed other people, of course he had, but it mostly felt like practice, practice for this, the real thing, with John, John
‘People,’ John continued, and his gaze had moved away from Sherlock so he was addressing the door frame and Sherlock realised with a jolt that John couldn't even look at him, that was how much he’d fucked up.
The idea that this girl’s boyfriend could walk in at any second and catch them combined with the indescribable feeling that came from having your cock sucked blows John’s mind. It’s the biggest thrill of his life and he
‘Friends,’ John nodded, even though that wasn't the word he would use to describe Sherlock. ‘Course. Friends.’
‘Floor 4, room 2.’ John nodded, grabbed his daughter’s hand and followed Sherlock to the elevator, which was now open and containing a very excited thirty-nine year old detective.
There was a wooshing sound in Sherlock’s ears, a ringing in the background, and he felt suddenly and strangely sick. He was stumbling to his feet and looking at Irene (was that even her real name? Was anything she had told him true?) and he knew he had to get as far away as possible.
He waited for John to say something but the older man stayed silent, and Sherlock realised he’d fallen asleep, head on Sherlock’s pillow, arms loose around his head.
He let Sherlock lead him to who he really was, and he let himself be brave not just to himself but to everyone else as well.
John shifted so he was almost on Sherlock’s lap, grinding down against him with tiny strokes that made Sherlock gasp and moan and writhe in the chair, hands clenched against John’s waist as the older man panted above him, and deep in the back of his mind Sherlock registered that John had clearly done this before because the movements were precise and painful and so,
Sherlock turned back to his friend, frowning. ‘I’m pretty sure you’re not allowed to say that, John. Isn't it a bit babyish and, ah,
‘And your father doesn’t know?’ John asked. It wasn’t really a question, more of a statement, but Sherlock answered anyway, finally finding his voice, although why he was so nervous he wasn't sure, what was wrong with him?
As Sherlock trailed after her into the kitchen he debated prying; he even opened his mouth to say something, but before he could a tiny voice in the back of his mind whispered she doesn't want to talk about it. Be decent and silent.
A ginger boy who looked about eighteen uncurled himself from a huge armchair and tutted. ‘Ne soyez pas impoli , Sherlock , le garçon est clairement d' une intelligence supérieure à la moyenne. Regardez sa coupe de cheveux!’ The ginger boy then smiled at Harry and whispered in an incredibly upper-class English accent, surprising John, ‘Sorry about him. He likes to show off.’
Sherlock raised his head and looked at John, standing with his daughter in his arms, and saw the life that he had always longed for in his grasp for the first time. He saw his life with John, his life with Rosie, the life that he was going to have,
John walked slowly, robotically towards Sherlock. He stopped in front of him and said, in a flat, monotonous voice, ‘if you loved me, Sherlock, you wouldn’t have slept with someone else. If you loved me, you’d have remembered me when you were fucking,’ John spat the word, ‘the person who killed over seven hundred-‘
'You've been spending far too much time with Mycroft,' Sherlock remarked. 'I don't know if I like that. John, should we exile him?'
Mycroft’s expression softened slightly and he shrugged. ‘I've said time and time again that I have your best interests at heart, brother mine.’
John frowned, staring at the wall. He had assumed that Sherlock had started blocking people out after the nanny; she was the one who convinced him he was cursed, and once he thought he was cursed he would have actively tried to disassociate himself from people.
Sherlock nodded, as if his point had been proven. ‘We’ve hung out a lot. We hold hands a lot.’ He blushed. ‘We kiss quite a lot. We do…other things.’
Irene was on the other side of the club, chatting up an attractive redhead who was covered with tattoos, so Sherlock sauntered into the middle and started to dance, lost in the writhing bodies. His body was taking him where it wanted to go: he closed his eyes and assumed they would all avoid him, let him do as he wished-
‘You should have done.’ Christopher sighed, collapsing back into his chair. ‘If you had done, you wouldn’t have had to have this conversation eleven years later.’
‘No,’ Sherlock pondered, ‘but I’m sure MI5 can make you, ahem, disappear.’ He was half joking, but as always he felt a pang of fear as he wondered if A) his father had the power to have someone taken and murdered and B) if he actually would reinforce that, if he found out about Sherlock’s, ahem, fascination with John Watson.
Sherlock raises his eyebrows. ‘Sounds like my brother. Was it my brother?’ Then, a pause. ‘Do you know my brother? How long have you been here?’
Moriarty was next to him, one hand on his back, the other clutching a handgun. ‘Don’t worry, Sherlock.’ He crooned. ‘Falling’s just like flying, except with a more permanent destination-‘
He’ll spend the day with Sherlock, fuck him at a crime scene, and then go home, bathe his daughter and have sex with Mary. He knows he’s lucky, just as he knows that his luck will run out, but that doesn't matter to him because at the moment everything is perfectly balanced, and John will enjoy that.
Only Mycroft remained poker-faced, looking at Sherlock and telling him it was alright, with his eyes. Sherlock smiled tightly at him and looked away, because it wasn't alright. It would never be alright, but Sherlock had to accept that, because he had no other option and never fucking would.
Sherlock nodded and padded softly towards the door, slipping past it without bringing attention to himself. He had never been through the door before; he didn’t usually go into the kitchens so he had had no reason too. It was a narrow hall that ended in a staircase; Sherlock shrugged and began to climb.
John tried to ignore the flicker in his chest and looked at the cake. Ordinarily he would tell Sherlock to fuck off, but the other boy seemed…well. Intriguing.
Mycroft pursed his lips and crossed his arms. ‘Right.’ He looked apologetically at his brother, who pouted and flopped back in his chair. ‘I’m not going.’
‘Thank you, brother mine.’ Mycroft whispered. ‘I disengaged the cameras in your sitting room for you.’
John’s smile widened. ‘You seemed smaller.’ His fingers reached up to Sherlock’s tie, settling on the knot at his throat. ‘And I meant what I said.’ He yanked the tie, pulling Sherlock down with it, and kissed him once, gently, on the lips as he whipped it off. ‘You look better without a tie.’
His mother laughed and pecks him on the top of his curly head. Sherlock noticed a faint yellow scrape down the side of her face, and smiled through his tears when he deduced that his father must have been scratched by Billy, their cat, again. ‘They don’t mean to, baby. And I’m sure you’ll do just the same.’
‘Well,’ Sherlock replied as he untied the end kayak, ‘You won’t get into trouble, because you’re leaving tomorrow, and nobody will punish me except my Mum. I’m not worried about her.’ Sherlock’s mother, despite being a massively successful mathematician with several published books in the field and the head of a huge chain of resorts all up the French coast was a real softie who clearly adored her children and husband. John had met her several times both last year and this year, and she had made him feel nothing but welcome.
‘She’ll betray you, Sherlock, just like the others did.’ Mycroft said quietly. ‘Please, just send her back to wherever she came from.’
Mike laughed out loud, and several of the people around them looked at him in confusion. ‘Trust you to say it as it is, mate. You, though…you look good.’
Sherlock didn’t look at him, instead saying, ‘do you remember what I said when Morag told me I had to choose between you and my throne?’
‘Hi, love,’ he starts quietly. ‘It’s been a while. I know I should come more often but…it seems right, coming on the anniversary, and every other time I try and step in here I just feel like it isn't the right thing to be doing.’ He pauses and looks at his children: Nathaniel is trying to tie the scarf around his sister’s neck. He smiles, and turns back to the grave, kneeling down in front of it, right on the grave in which Sherlock will lie forever. ‘Nathaniel has grown so much. He looks more like you every day, and he’s even begun deducing. I think it was Mycroft that taught him that- I told you your brother adored you, didn't I? Lizzie’s met someone, I think. She’s always on the phone, or texting, and she seems happier than she’s been in a long time. Do you remember when she brought that Philip boy home? You were so funny.’ He remembers the incident as clearly as if it had happened yesterday (
Sherlock had smirked at his brother over his gold-rimmed tea cup and sipped elegantly, little finger sticking out as he had been taught. ‘Jealous, Mycroft?’
He asks Sherlock to be his best man. Sherlock’s face closes, and John has to shut his eyes as the rush builds inside him, threatening to burst out. He listens to Sherlock’s speech at the wedding and, for the first time, regrets trying to break him, because it’s so obvious that Sherlock has no idea what John is doing that John actually feels pity. For all his brains, Sherlock Holmes can be incredibly stupid, and John feels guilty. Thankfully this only lasts a few minutes, because as Mary’s father makes the speech Sherlock slips his hand into John’s and John knows that he’s doing the right thing.
‘Just freaking ask him,’ Irene sighed, swinging her legs off his desk. ‘Now, are you going to sleep with me or not?’
Sherlock was standing, stock still, staring out of the window. ‘I’ve forgotten to do something, John.’
He called Lestrade, the young sergeant in the police who acted as his contact, and sulkily told him not to get another consultant before hanging up. He wasn’t in the mood for small talk.
‘Are you fucking?’ Smith had asked, wonder clear on his features. ‘Jesus, Johnny! You’re going to be Queen!’ A real smile broke out on his face, briefly, before he looked shocked and a tear leaked out of his left eye. 'How can I be smiling, Johnny?' He whispered. 'How can I be smiling while he's dead? I loved him, John. God, I'm going to hell, but I
) who Sherlock had never seen before looked slightly taken aback. Sherlock smiled at her politely and took Mycroft's arm, turning him away from the crowds, and hissing, 'she’s my friend.’ He regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth because it was stupid and immature and Sherlock sounded like a whining baby, but Mycroft wasn’t smiling as Sherlock had thought he would; instead, he looked sad.
John hadn’t been to many of those parties before. Sure, he was a sociable boy: sure, he was popular, but parties weren’t generally
‘Still, Sherlock.’ Lestrade bent down next to him and looked at the body, frowning slightly as he took it in. ‘That was…not good.’
John pulled down his hood and looked around: there was no one in sight, save for a small woman wearing headphones by the bookshelves and an old man reading and sipping a cup of steaming coffee. John looked at the man, and then at the empty counter: was he
Irene shrugged. ‘Why not? She’s sixteen now and, as far as I know, single. Sherlock thinks she’s curious as well, so I’m basically halfway there. The poor thing is a bit dull, though, and Janine feels slighted because I don't want to fuck her this year.’ Irene sighed loudly, lifting the hand that wasn't holding John’s towards the sky. ‘Not to quote Sherlock, but
‘I wouldn’t let King William fuck me.’ Harry said, shaking her head. ‘No idea where he’s been, do I? He’s got, like, ten children, I bet. There are all these rumours about these random illegitimates scattered all over the country, aged from about forty to eighteen.’
‘You lie,’ Sherlock scoffed. ‘John will easily be able to read these. I’ll give them to him at school tomorrow-‘
say anything to that: instead, he settled down again, pulling Sherlock closer to him, shutting his brain off and just feeling
‘Sherlock, please.’ Sherlock repeated. ‘I’m in your home, Mrs Watson, and anyway, I’m no better than you just because I happened to be born in a palace.’
‘What is it?’ Sherlock wondered. John couldn’t believe that this man, standing calmly in hospital scrubs, his child’s arrival in the very near future, was the same man who’d freaked out when he’d gotten a text saying they should come to the hospital. ‘Sherlock-‘
He shook his head and shouted, ‘may I present….’ he paused for effect; Mycroft muttered, ‘dear god,’ behind him. Sherlock turned, winked, and yelled, ‘may I present Prince Edward Mycroft and Sir Gregory Thomas Lestrade!’ He had given Lestrade a knighthood at Mycroft’s assistance, though Lestrade had blushed and insisted he didn’t want one. Stupid Mycroft. It didn’t make sense that Lestrade would be knighted; he hadn’t done anything.
John had tried to explain to him that Mycroft was just worried about his little brother (Sherlock had snorted and shaken his head disbelievingly because despite his incredibly high IQ he was blind to most emotion) and that at least they weren’t doing something a lot worse, because, to be fair, they really could have been.
‘It’s not my fault I don’t have a vagina.’ Sherlock whined, mostly joking. Irene rolled her eyes and went back to typing on her laptop. ‘It’s not my fault I don’t have a penis,’ she shot back.
‘Thanks for the mental image,’ Sherlock spat, ‘but you and Lestrade had been engaged in a relationship for almost a year. John and I have never kissed, we are not in a relationship, this is probably classed as our first date. Also, I’m
This is a lie. Sherlock has so much: his work, his brother, his experiments. Sometimes it feels like it’s
The boy on the floor raised his head in interest. ‘You never bring in new people,’ he mused. This boy had lighter brown hair, with green eyes, and was wearing a tie, a pair of very tight blue shorts and a tank top. ‘What’s so special about this John, hey?’
Jim continued, ignoring John’s shock. ‘The second reason was because I leaked a series of opinions the King and the other royal family had towards certain
‘I’m not explaining myself clearly enough.’ John stamped his foot, his eyes finally resting on Sherlock. ‘Sherlock. I like you.’
‘His priority,’ she finished. ‘You’re jealous. I don't know why, though, because every time I see you together Sherlock’s attention is 100% on you.’
Mike, who’d only arrived two days previously but was staying on with Sherlock for an extra two weeks smiled and patted him on the shoulder. ‘Au revoir, Jean. I hope to be seeing you next year?’
John turned on his heel, stomped to the shelf, and sat on his haunches to inspect the third shelf. ‘Fucking twatty little arrogant
‘You’re sitting straight and tense, although you’re around someone you know and there a relatively few people around you. You’re used to having to react quickly and to behave impeccably, even in environments where you should consider yourself safe, such as school or at home. Abusive father. You’ve had to move away at the beginning of your last year of secondary school which is odd itself- clearly something large happened and your mother decided to take you away for a fresh start. If she was hiding from your father she would have moved further away, I can tell you’re from London because of your accent, so he must be in prison and your mother believes you will still be safe in London. You’re holding your left shoulder as if it hurts and I can see the outline of a bandage and I deducted that you play rugby from your muscular build, particularly big shoulders, and calloused hands; the balls are often rough and scratchy. The way you hold yourself also suggests cadets and you’re wearing dog tags- I’m assuming they belonged to an Uncle considering your relationship with your father. You want to join the army in his memory, or maybe to make him proud if he’s still alive. I deducted you did PE from your build and also from the army dream. You mentioned you wanted to be a doctor to Mike about twenty minutes ago; you must be doing biology and, considering your physical background, chemistry is more likely than physics. You also have the words paper 2: WWI on the back of your hand; history. Your phone has an engraving on it,’ Sherlock pointed at the phone, which was loose in John’s hand, ‘which reads Sorry, Johnny- Harry x. He calls you Johnny, a nickname; a family member. The phone is a newer model, though it’s been used, which indicates it came from someone only a few years older than you at most; a brother. Now, why would he be sorry? He didn't move away with you. Why didn't he move away with you? He ran away. Why did he run away? Alcohol.’
was gay, smiling at a girl none of them had ever seen before, a girl who was undeniably incredibly attractive, a girl who
‘I feel like that isn’t a negative for you, John Watson,’ Sherlock replied. ‘I have your number. Don't ask how.'
John needed Sherlock like he needed oxygen. He had been in love with him for over a year and a half; they had been best friends before that. When John tried to imagine a future without Sherlock…he couldn’t see anything.
That was idiotic, though. There was no way that John Watson would ever like an arrogant, fucked-up freak like him. It was amazing that he had wanted to be friends with Sherlock; lovers was impossible. No one liked Sherlock; no one would ever like Sherlock, of that he was sure. No one wanted Sherlock; no one would ever want Sherlock. Why would John be an exception to that rule?
They picked up John’s friends on the way, John briefly explaining that he had made friends with the hot boy at the drinks table and he was taking them somewhere, even as Mary scowled and Sarah rolled her eyes and Molly stared with adoration at Sherlock’s back. They weaved through the crowd, John trying
‘Good,’ Sherlock mumbled against John’s lips, ignoring Mycroft’s exclamation of disgust. ‘Don’t be too long, Doctor Watson.’
‘Nothing, sir.’ Isaac Whitney said. Isaac was the youngest there, a boy of barely seventeen; he was baby-faced and had seemed like a pussy, but John knew he was one of the bravest soldiers in the squadron.
‘I have a solution!’ Sherlock cried. He grabbed the paper, seized the pencil and wrote down his brilliant brainwave.
‘Keep your voice low.’ The other voice murmured. John bit his lip and glared into the darkness. ‘What the fuck are you doing here? Where are we?’
‘Sher, you ok?’ John said from behind him, sounding worried. Sherlock jolted and turned around. ‘Yes,’ he answered quickly. ‘Why wouldn’t I be?’
He sat in there, by himself, trying very hard to delete the one memory he knew he never could, trying not to remember the feel of her cold, dead hands, trying not to remember the scathing look Morag had given him, trying hard not to remember the feeling that it was all his fault.
And then, Smith said, a helicopter had appeared. The soldiers had all been staring at it, wondering what it was (no new troops were due until the end of August) and even Sholto had been looking confused as it landed.
more interesting than England. The books are better, the coffee is superb and the language…’ Sherlock kissed his fingers. ‘The language is
When Sherlock had finished, John was quiet for a long time as so, so much of Sherlock finally made sense to him. Finally, he said, ‘that’s why you won’t let people near you. That’s why you insult people all the time. That’s why you have to be the cleverest. That’s why…everything.’
‘You don’t know them.’ Mycroft said, still looking out of the window. ‘They’re here quite frequently, though. They’re a detective at Scotland Yard; only twenty-five years old, but already detective-inspector. They were here on the day Father found out about John and you.’ Sherlock shuddered at these words: that day had probably been one of the worst in his entire life. He had called his father’s bluff, hoping against all hopes that he would choose his son over his homophobic ideals, but there had been a moment when he had been sure that his father was going to throw him from the castle.
Sherlock grunted. ‘It just proves my sentiment theory.’ He almost heard his boyfriend rolling his eyes, but John didn’t say anything, simply moving closer to Sherlock and putting his head on his shoulder. Sherlock smiled to himself, silently thanking Jack; this was the feeling of home.
James was pushing him backwards, pushing him down on the bed, straddling him and Sherlock knew exactly what they were going to do and said with his last shred of decency said, ‘John-‘ but James just shook his head and whispered, ‘he’s gone, Sherlock. Probably screwing one of his friends. Probably been cheating on you all along, hasn’t he, gorgeous?’
Lestrade sighed. ‘We can’t get out of it?’ Sherlock shook his head gleefully. ‘No. This is punishment for not naming the little hellraiser after me.’
‘No, John. It’s not your fault.’ Sherlock turned over so he and John were facing, faces inches apart. ‘You didn’t sign up for this. God knows why you stay with me.’
They hadn’t known their father; they hadn’t known their siblings. They weren’t upset, because they hadn’t been allowed to possibly ever meet the man who had fathered them, and this made John strangely angry because no child should be banned from knowing his father.
thing, Lestrade. Not John’s. James supplied me with a similar idea concerning body parts but we determined that it was probably a little risqué for him.’
‘Don’t mention it,’ John said awkwardly, and Siger left his side to go and sit by his wife, taking her hand and stroking it softly. John fiddled with his hands awkwardly, unsure of what to do or say, when a low, posh voice said in his ear, ‘Why, John Watson. You are quite grown up.’
at John. John doesn't know why, because he has done nothing special: if anything, John should be apologising for allowing his father to die. He had a part in preventing Nathaniel from having the best upbringing possible, from knowing his father, who John knows would have adored Nathaniel. Instead, Nathaniel was stuck with John, a man with sub-par intelligence who couldn't bring his son in the way that he should have been.
John raised an eyebrow. ‘I didn’t take you for someone who liked philosophy,’ he said, struggling to keep a straight face. ‘Aren’t you all into, um, the government?’
century was a lot more complex. Suddenly everything had risk: suddenly, I had two people to care for. It was extremely hard keeping Felix out of the army in 1914 and 1939: everyone seemed to think the
Plus he had a weakness for danger and the thought of getting into trouble, of proving that he wasn’t just a golden boy with no personality, was strangely thrilling. Especially if the people he got into trouble with were the royal family.
Sherlock winced and opened his eyes. ‘I didn't think anyone would find out, Irene. We decided not to tell anyone.’
‘It was a Friday,’ he whispered. ‘We made a cake in the morning, a chocolate cake, and then we went down to the lake and ate honey sandwiches. I was wearing my bee shirt and my blue shorts, with these blue shoes Mummy bought me. Mycroft helped us make the cake and then he cleaned me up; I splashed water at him, and he laughed at me. He was about to go to boarding school and I was upset, I thought I was going to miss him. My mother told us to go and play together, and we played pirates, but Mycroft wanted to write some notes on some experiment, so I was by myself. I thought- I thought I’d go and see mummy.’
Sherlock’s mind was malfunctioning. His hands were out to the sides, legs far apart, eyes wide open and cheeks flushed as he tried to make sense of the situation. ‘John-‘ he gasped, as John continued to nip at his bottom lip, ‘I don’t- you- you’re getting
‘Oh, shut up,’ John breathed, and he pulled Sherlock back towards him, crushing their lips together, because
, saying it was ‘unnecessarily colloquial, Jawn,’ and Roise had started picking it up too, in the way she picked up so many of his bad habits. ‘I will be.’
‘Go out Archie’s window,’ Victor suggested. ‘That overlooks the grounds. You can get out of the gate.’
Sherlock laughed, choking slightly on tears he hadn’t realised were there, and whispered, ‘I think so.'
John hovered anxiously between Lila and the window. ‘Sherlock, I really think you should come over here-‘
‘You don’t know the people down there,’ Sherlock said quietly, leaning forward. ‘She,’ he pointed at Molly Hooper on table 4, ‘Suffers from crippling anxiety: being in a room full of people like this takes more effort than you could possibly imagine. He,’ he pointed at Victor Trevor on table 7, ‘Nearly died when he was a child, and as a result cannot bear to be near or in a large expanse of water or an enclosed space.’ His gaze drifted to the top table. ‘The groom’s two daughters, Rosie and Becky, are constantly told by their mother that their father is a degenerate: the other groom’s parents lost their daughter when she was young, and nearly lost their second son a decade later. Even that groom,’ he pointed at Mycroft, ‘Would and has done anything he could to protect his younger brother, despite the anger and thanklessness he receives in return.’ He paused, and looked at Hamish, angrier than he’d been in a very (
And they’re kissing again, although it feels different, now, because John is putting something into the kiss that wasn’t there before. It’s the thought that maybe, just maybe, their paths are crossing
Sherlock didn’t realise he had been stripped naked until he felt James pinch his nipples. He keened, kissing James wantonly as he grinded upwards, his cock firm and upright and leaking pre-come all over his stomach. James was still fully-clothed, smiling at Sherlock with a delight the younger boy had never seen before and why was he doing this he hated this boy this boy had hurt his country and his family and Jesus, Sherlock, why can’t you just say-
Sherlock stared at his husband, completely overwhelmed. Part of him was angry that John would think that way about himself, part of him was worried about why John would say this, part of him was in disbelief over how John had described him, but absolutely every atom in him was screaming about how much he loved John in that moment. More than during that first dance, more than at their wedding, more than at the birth of their twin daughters, more than at the birth of their miracle baby boy.
‘Why would you ask my opinion if I was just going to say no?’ He asked, frowning. ‘That’s illogical, John.’
‘That’s what it is, isn’t it?’ Hamish said, examining his fingernails. ‘Or, technically, inducing, though the former term is much more common.’
'Barracks dismissed,' Sholto barked, and John jolted back to reality as he and the others trooped back into their bunk. Becca headed for her bunk at the back, glaring at John as she went, but John ignored her and headed straight for his bunk, kicking off his shoes. He wasn’t meant to remove his footwear, but he knew that Sholto wouldn’t get pissed at him. Sholto loved him.
Sherlock let go of James and pulled away, taking a step towards John. As he moved forwards he felt something drip out of him and close his eyes.
John smirked and put his arms around Sherlock’s neck. ‘Try it, and see where it gets you,’ he whispered, and Sherlock leaned forwards-
Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘It seems my newly married older brother needs me.’ He crossed quickly to the door, poked his head out and shouted, ‘I’M HERE!’
‘Someone’s been reading their Grimms Fairy tales again.’ Mycroft said, tutting. ‘You’re sixteen, Sherlock, not six.’
And he watches his son talking excitedly, hand absentmindedly around the person’s he loves, and his heart aches because this, his son in a relationship, is something else that Sherlock has missed. It doesn't matter if he can imagine him here because he isn’t, really, and John wishes with all his heart that he could be here with him.
Time slowed. He could hear gunshots, he could see Isaac, he could smell gunpowder. Someone was screaming; he was told later it was him.
John had always imagined the three Prince’s sitting in tidy, bland rooms, staring at walls, with no decorations and normal, tasteful décor. This was the opposite; Sherlock’s rooms were untidy, the wallpaper was horrendous, and it was homely and comfortable.
John almost heard her rolling her eyes. ‘It’s a lot easier than you would imagine. Morag got in here, so did Jim. Piece of cake. When I lived here with Sherlock, I did repeatedly tell him that security was a fucking joke-'
Building snowmen, summer fairs, making cakes, tenpin bowling, tennis lessons, star-gazing, movie marathons ran through his head. Mycroft, he and his mother making Christmas decorations; singing happy birthday to his mother; his mother running her fingers through his thick, curly hair and singing-
He’s gotten so good at hiding his feelings, because that’s what love is: wanting the other person to be happy, even if it’s not with you. And even if he didn’t love John more than he loved himself and his brother and rainy days and everything else that made life worth living, he would still go to his grave insisting that
‘We agreed this after you returned from Afghanistan, John.’ Mycroft said, trying to avoid eye contact with Sherlock’s partner, who had been in a foul mood for the best part of a year. Sherlock winced when Mycroft mentioned Afghanistan; those twenty-four hours, between finding out John had been shot and then flying to Afghanistan to find him almost dead, had been the worst of his life. Mycroft kept telling him he was extremely lucky none of the soldiers told; Sherlock told him to piss off. John had been dying, Sherlock had to be there.
Sherlock shot a rare smile at his brother as he pulled away. ‘Not your fault, My. It’s an unavoidable part of life, isn’t it?’
) was behind Morag, mouthing something that Sherlock couldn’t understand because Morag was smiling evilly in front of her and it was giving Sherlock the shivers. ‘Off you go, Sherlock. Don’t keep your…lad waiting.’
« I am very sorry, Doctor, but I am waited somewhere else. It was nice to meet you, have a very nice day. »
« I am seeing someone, Miss Mary Morstan, and I think she’s the one, so I wanted to introduce her to your brother... »
“Him” being the one and only Consulting Detective, who currently was clumsily attempting to cram his first pipe of the morning. Sherlock Holmes will forever stay in the collective memory as the greatest mind of his time (maybe of all times, but his ego doesn’t need to be stroked), as a true hero, restless but full of grace and hiding a golden heart behind a facade of snark. But not before his first pipe and cup of coffee, not if the world is not imminently ending. Watson just had the False Good Idea™ to buy a Valentine’s gift for Sherlock Holmes, and, of course, he was intending to be anxious about it. It truly was a chance Holmes was still dead to the world at this very moment, otherwise he would immediately have understood what his lover had in mind and probably tried to stop him. Maybe a first little miracle, which can’t be proved and which I will always deny performing. And, even if I did, Watson was still far, far from out of the wood.
Maybe it was the heat from the fire, the brandy, the exhaustion, all of the above that made Watson’s inside melt. Or maybe it was the sweet, loving gaze Holmes was giving him. He was too tired and far, far too comfy to think about an answer right now.
As expected, I am not very fond of Christmas. I have purposes more important to attend and do not wish to partake in the socialities such a celebration necessarily entails. But, as no one is perfect, the elder Holmes does have his sins, the biggest one being my curiosity; hence, when I had received an invitation to spend Christmas with my brother and his best friend, my curiosity had been titillated enough to accept. And if I had known, I would have declined because, dear me, I had never felt more awkward than now, playing poker while sipping a glass of brandy, sitting between Sherlock and John. And, as Stanley will attest, I am not easily abashed.
? It was too much for the poor, emotionally wrecked Doctor. With the last force he had spared from not hiding his distress, he asked: “Why did you get me something, then, if it’s a celebration you don’t care for?”. Holmes had never ceased to smile since he had started to talk, an amused smile which turned to tender. “I don’t need a pre-defined day to show you my love, John. I don’t need a special occasion to please you. I didn’t even wait for us to be a couple. If I know your favorite compositors are on the program, I take you to the opera. If I see you had a rough week, I took you to your favorite restaurants. If I see you need comfort, I play the violin for you. If I see you’re bored, I ask you to read for me or tell you about my adventures before you enter my life. I try to let you know how much you’re brilliant, how important, how indispensable you are to me on every minute of every day. I know I’m not very good at it, I’m doing my best and I will find ways to improve myself until what I’m saying to you seems the simplest truth and not send you into heart attack. Do you need me to lay you on the floor? I would suggest some brandy, but it’s only eight thirty in the morning, so… Do you-”. Watson didn’t need any brandy and wasn’t against the idea to be laid on the floor as long as Sherlock was near enough for him to kiss the living breath out of him. Holmes was right, it truly was a shame to be out of bed at this hour on such a day.
At first, he hadn’t felt the change in the atmosphere, it had only been when he had felt too warm to still wear his waistcoat that he noticed the door of his bedroom was open, probably to allow the warmth of the purring fire which had been lighted in the common room to reach and chase the chilly air of his room. Feeling a little comfier, Watson returned to his work with a sight… How much would he prefer to spend the night wallowed in his armchair, all warm and fuzzy in front of the fireplace…
« Exactly. Now, please, help me, I can’t find my trousers and brother Mycroft is either dead of mortification or of laughing behind the door! »
“Good morning, Mr. Fell. I am… Well. I’m searching for… something.” Mr. Fell’s smile turned a little embarrassed, but he went ahead nonetheless, “And I would be happy to help you to find it, but I’m afraid I will need more clues.”. But the problem was still the same: Watson has none. Then, as he was quickly evaluating his surroundings to find at least the tail of an idea, the Doctor’s gaze caught on the racks just next to the librarian counter. They were full of music scores. It seemed like such a logic, bright idea; for the second time in less than ten minutes, Watson asked himself how the Hell he hadn’t thought about it earlier. “I’m searching for sheet music.”, Mr. Fell immediately rounded his counter and drew up to the racks; “Aah, now we’re talking, Doctor. What kind of?”. Ah. The radiant smile which had illuminated Watson’s face an instant prior faded instantly. To begin with, music scores tended to be expensive and even if the good Doctor had stopped gambling altogether (or almost. It didn’t count when Holmes was with him, there was no danger since the Detective kept an eye on him and on his fellow gamblers as well as on Watson’s wallet; did it? And his checkbook was still locked in Holmes’ desk drawer, anyway), he wasn’t rich; far from it. Then, he couldn’t tell to Mr. Fell he intended to gift what he was searching for to Sherlock Holmes as a Valentine’s present. Watson was almost sure the librarian wouldn’t be appalled by this revelation; he strongly suspected Mr. Fell to be no stranger to the notion of loving another man. Watson couldn’t say anything anyway, not without speaking about it with Holmes in the first place. To his great amazement, faced with a long, awkward silence, Mr. Fell’s smile turn from beaming to gentle. “I’ve got exactly what you need, Doctor Watson.”
Crowley had despised 14th century. For several reasons. First of all: it had been impossible for him to get his hand on the Angel for quite a long time. Their encounter under Arthur’s reign hadn’t been so much friendly, and Crowley had hardly seen Aziraphale since. In all honesty, the Demon thought the Angel probably was at Philip the Bold’s court; but he wasn’t sure. Anyway, he couldn’t find a good excuse to go there himself. Usual Angels and Demons had both loved the Middle Ages; the first because everything was about God, and pleasing God, and fearing God and, when Crowley said I had f*cked up good monkeys by giving them anxiety, he was only halfway true, it seemed they also were fanatics and hypocritical. That’s why Demons also loved this era, tempting humans to do horrible things in my name was utterly useless, they already did it themselves very well. So, yeah, Crowley had claimed he had instigated the first Crusade and whispered to Edward II of England: “Hey! You could be king of France if you wanted to, you know?”. It was enough and even maybe a bit too much; after all, he didn’t want Aziraphale to believe he was… Well, a Demon. Usual Angels and Demons had loved the Middle Ages, Crowley had hated them. Aziraphale had really loved Arthur’s ideas, Gregorian chants and the cultural aspects of the court of Burgundy and disapproved almost everything else. Since the Demon couldn’t find a way to join Burgundy without sowing - or pretend to sow - misery behind him, he had had an idea for Aziraphale to come to him. It was a very good idea, I have to say, but not enough for degenerate monkey not to screw up.
Watson was soaked. As a Londoner, he was very well used to rainy days and never forgot to carry his umbrella away. Well, almost never, he had forgotten it this morning; maybe because he was dead on his feet. Every fall, it was always the same, people didn’t cover themselves enough, they caught a cold, didn’t heal this cold and then came to the good Doctor Watson in various states of pneumonia, fly and other sympathetic things like these. Watson was born to be a doctor, a healer, he had been made to take care of the others, he loved to take care of the others, really. But, sometimes, just sometimes, he would wish his patients would listen to his advises and don’t become stupidly ill. After having looked at running noses and inflamed throats all day, after having prescribed a lot of rest, some tea with honey and warm clothes all the bloody week, the good Doctor Watson had just enough. All he wanted now was a good brandy in front of the fireplace and some quiet. All he wanted, for once, was to be taken care of.
4. Thomas Midgley Jr. discovered the freon, a gas used in the fridge to replace the previous gas which was mortally dangerous. But the freon is a grennhouse gas...
« Oh, hum, sure. He... He talked about my walking stick, which is also a steel blade - it was a reward for partaking and coming back alive from the Afghan war - hum, it’s... It’s a great reward, so we were very few to get it, and he... He said I was as rare and lethal as the blade but... As elegant as the walking stick? »
, right?”, “Indeed. I know you didn’t enjoy it as much as you should have because the play was in French, here is the English edition Mr. Fell miraculously found for me.”. To be honest, even if he had experienced some difficulties to understand everything, John had
I would like to say the good Doctor really thought what was bothering him did not deserve to be talked about, but he was simply dying to complain about it to someone, really. He was just too scared to be judged and maybe roasted, perhaps worse.
The other man turned slowly around before kneeling an instant to put the glass on the table between their seats.
Holmes let out a little chuckle, a lopsided smile tugging at the corner of his lips; “My dear Watson, don’t you know better? I did forget we already were February 14th, but do you really think I would pass an opportunity to spoil you?”, he then proceeded to get a little, non-descriptive package out of the locked drawer of his desk.
A few minutes later, he heard splashing noises coming from the bathroom. Not paying attention to them, thinking Holmes had (finally) decide to take a bath, Watson didn’t lift his head from his papers. It wasn’t that the fact of the Detective deciding to take a bath without a whole session of arguing and bargaining wasn’t surprising, quite the opposite, the Doctor was simply beginning to feel too comfortable to have the strength to leave his chair. He knew that, if he left his work now, he wouldn’t be able to go back to it. He was too tired and too snug at the same time. He was still absentmindedly writing down his prescriptions to the apothecary while trying to decide if he should head to the bathroom and ask to Holmes what had gotten into him or not – and drinking his tea – when he heard him calling from him from the doorframe of his room.
3. Albert Einstein and Enrico Firmi both worked on the nuclear fission, which will lead to the nuclear bomb.
A couple of hours after that, Watson probably fell asleep on his armchair. Almost unconscious, he let Holmes leading him to his room and felt a little, light kiss being pressed on his forehead. All these little gestures made him felt… Love.
John Watson AND Sherlock Holmes! Ladies and Gentlemen, Crowley, the first FanBoy ever. And there was also a note, written in Aziraphale’s curly handwriting, the message was very simple, but everyone knows the best present often are the simplest ones: “Happy Valentine’s day, my dear.”
Crowley never made a secret about it: he had hated the 14th century. Why? Well, nobody knows exactly, he had always been quite evasive on the question. Only God - and Crowley, of course - know the truth; I will tell you about it. So let’s get back a long, long time ago; during the 3rd century.
If he had been in a better mood, Watson would have been very pleased to find Holmes quietly reading in his armchair when he entered their common room this evening. No experiment, no drug, no explosion, God! Gladstone wasn’t even in danger of death! But the only thing he was able to see was the enormous amount of work which he still needed to take care of. Watson was definitely in a fool mood, no need to be Sherlock Holmes to deduce it, especially when the Doctor only answer a vague “Urmf” to the Detective’s greetings before heading gloomily to his room.
It is so painfully obvious that it is not deducing but just listening. It was a passionate love confession poorly concealed with a half-hearted comment about gambling. And the sweet, adorable fool I had in front of me did not understand anything about it and was just so confused and ready to break my little brother’s heart.
« I am deeply sorry to disturb you, Mr. Holmes, sir, but - as you wanted me to - I am here to report a strange exchange between Mr. Holmes - your brother, sir - and Doctor Watson. »
That was cruel, I admit. I could see the conflict on the Doctor’s face. But a true friend does not tell what ones wants to hear, he says what is essential to tell. Well, Watson must know the answer, deep inside.
If only it was this simple… With a lot of patients came a lot of paperwork, there were files to be completed, notes to be written to the apothecary, not to mention the preparation of his tomorrow morning round and the notes of the two last cases with Holmes which were waiting to be properly narrated on his desk… No, no rest was planned for Doctor Watson, not until the early hours of the morning. And he was soaked, which didn’t lift his mood.
6. Cyrano de Bergerac is a French theatre play written by Edmond Rostand, played for the first time on Decembre 28th 1897. This is the most beautiful story I ever read. Here is a
Watson was agape. Sherlock Holmes had run him a bath. After having make him a cup of tea. That was even more incredible than Sherlock Holmes willingly washing up! There must be a problem somewhere…
“I beg your pardon, but I’m not usually the one who loses the rent but the one who pays it with his earnings. And I didn’t break anything; maybe my back while searching for this damned soap which had slipped under the bathtub.”
Sometimes, one feels like the idea one has the other day may not be the greatest - as one first thought - but the worst, or close to it. It happens to the best; Albert Einstein, Enrico Firmi [3], Thomas Midgley Jr.[4], Shakespeare[5]… It is exactly what happened to John Watson on Valentine’s day morning, but nothing as significant as his peers, don’t worry. The good Doctor would soon wholeheartedly laugh about it all; he was, however, more tempted to faint than to express joy when he sat at the breakfast table. Everything was… Normal. Mrs. Hudson had brought toasts, eggs, bacon, jam and coffee; the newspapers were waiting to be read on the pedestal table, Holmes was cramming his pipe with tobacco. Nothing was amiss, and Watson couldn’t believe he had, even for one second, thought buying a Valentine’s gift for Holmes would be a good idea. Of course, he wouldn’t be into something so mundane. They had known each other for years, now, one would have thought Watson knew better, but no. What could he do? Act like nothing was afoot and keep his present for another occasion? No way, as soon as the Detective would have drunk his cup of coffee and drawn on his pipe a few times, Watson would be found out. Giving his gift as he had planned, then. Holmes would love it, that was for sure, but how would he react before unwrapping it? Would he just tease Watson? Tell him how irremediably romantic he was? Or would he be offended, annoyed with Watson for distracting him from important matters? He wouldn’t have any present for the Doctor, anyway; Sherlock Holmes was definitely not the kind of man who would care for Valentine’s day. Oh, Watson didn’t care one bit about the lack of present, but he would have loved the intention, would have known Holmes had gone out of his way to find something for him, thought about something which might please him and bought it just for the sake of putting a smile on his lover face. Watson knew Holmes didn’t care, and it hurt. The only option left to avoid more mental suffering was for the Doctor to jump through the window next to his seat, but it seemed a bit too much to end up face first on the sidewalk just to avoid confrontation with the love of his life. What else, then?
I am not supposed to have a favourite historical period, it wouldn’t be fair. And if I had one, it wouldn’t be Antiquity. I dislike all the eras equally, just as Aziraphale loves them. However, even the Angel of the Eastern Gate found things he didn’t like over all these years: illiteracy, of course, rudeness, fast-food - no, that’s not surprising, I know - and the plane; My, Aziraphale would never climb in a plane, not for anything in the world, nor in Eden! Flying? Without his wings? In a pressurized tin can with a bunch of anxious humans? Thanks, but no, thanks! Oh, it would have been possible to make the Angel board in an airplane, he would willingly do it if, in exchange, he could be sure there would be no more pain, injustice, inequity. He would even smile to the flight attendant. But Aziraphale knew very well his humble principality in a plane wouldn’t achieve any of this, the device would only be sure not to crash (and it would be great already, but this is not the question). A long time before the Angel had had to formulate an inner judgment about flying tin can, he had had to face human’s cruelty. Planes weren’t that bad, at last.
I never really told you why Crowley hated the 14th century, did I? Well, he’s the one who had invented Valentine’s day, the best excuse he could ever find to tell Aziraphale how much he loved him, without telling him altogether. It wasn’t supposed to be the celebration of lovers, but the celebration of love. All kinds of love. Secret partnership between Heaven and Hell to ensure the worlds was still turning as it was supposed to could be encompassed in the definition, right? No, I know, it was a poor excuse, but Crowley was full of good intentions. He couldn’t have known humans would turn his celebration in a commercial one, distressing men, disappointing women and excluding bachelors. He had even received a medal from Hell, for all the misery he had brought. What a shame… He had napped for the rest of the century, hoping to get up a little less angry.
I had to find a solution to avoid the tragedy of two pining men being separated by their own foolishness ; for their own good and my sanity. The idea comes to me rather simply, with the mail, when I was wondering what gift I could make to Doctor Watson if I took on their invitation for Christmas. And this is how I found myself, as I said, awkwardly playing cards with my brother and his best friend on Christmas day, ardently wishing I had been able to mind my own business or, even better, never heard about anything at all! But here I was and, when Watson got up to serve us another brandy, I took the opportunity to ask if we shall exchange our Christmas gifts. They both agreed, to my great relief.
; he couldn’t wait to read the text in his mother tongue and was sure “love” would soon become an euphemism to express his feelings toward the play, just as it was for his feelings toward Sherlock. The Detective didn’t need a special occasion to please him, indeed, but he had deduced the Doctor would want to celebrate Valentine’s day, went out of his way to indulge him and found the perfect present. A present concerning a theatre play they attended more than a year ago, but Holmes had remembered how much John had loved it. He had
Back in bed, Watson decided he was more curious about Holmes’ reaction to his gift than anything else and told him to open the present. The Detective did so and discovered, eyes wide, a book of music scores. “John! It must have cost far too much! Tell me you didn’t sell your watch or something to buy it, please!”, “Absolutely not, it wasn’t expensive, actually, Mr. Fell told me nobody wanted of these music sheets because of the anonymous ones. And he also offered me a price reduction if I agreed to sign his copy of “The Hound of the Baskervilles”; he’s a big fan of yours, did you know? And he likes my writings very much,
Sherlock quickly gathered the remnants of his wits: « Yes... Certainly, thank... Thank you for coming and for... Everything? »
At this point, Watson was simply feeling than the damnest fool on this planet and didn’t have the strength to pretend otherwise.
“Yes, tea leaves and boiling water. However, it would have been an empty cup. And some honey. I know you like honey.”
« ... And I have to say - it would not be honest otherwise - Holmes started by, well, by analysing me. »
Ah. That was already more like the Holmes Watson knew. The idea of a hot bath was very tempting, really, as much as the idea of coming back to his work after was insufferable.
A package wrapped in tartan wrapping paper can only be from Aziraphale, Crowley would have spared himself a few swears if he had checked the packet more closely before thinking about a joker. Why the Angel had dropped it off under his porch and not simply gave him, Crowley didn’t know. It was a book. Not so surprising from Aziraphale, but he knew the Demon didn’t read, why would he give him a book? Well, that’s not true, Crowley wants people to believe he doesn’t read; he’s already a poor excuse for a Demon, if people knew he likes - just as Aziraphale - to read in front of the fireplace with a quilt on his legs, he might as well jump straight in a bath of Holy Water, it would be less inglorious. The title says “The Hound of the Baskervilles”, at least that’s something the Demon likes. Crowley is a Very Big Fan of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, he even had thought about coming up with multiple robberies for the Detective to chase him and, therefore, for him to be part of the adventure, but he had managed to refrain himself. For now. Opening the book, Crowley couldn’t believe his eyes. The volume was
“Well, I mean generally, but yes, I suppose, specifically… when you tell me...” His voice trailed off as he took a deep breath, still looking anywhere but at John.
“Fuck,” John mutters, staring down at the sight in his lap. Sherlock holds himself there for two seconds, maybe three, before quickly lifting off. He’s sputtering, drooling, his eyes watering, messy, gorgeous, and he takes a deep breath and does it again.
She lets him back into the flat. It’s not empty, not by any means; the furniture and functional items are still there, but things are missing, the things that establish Sherlock’s presence to a degree of certainty. John stands in the middle of the sitting room and looks around, and Mrs. Hudson looks at him.
“It was one part water, and one part water.” John says this like it makes complete sense, and Sherlock nods like it does as well. John refills the glass and hands it back. “Slower this time, please.”
Sherlock groans and shifts in a manner which makes John chuckle. “I haven’t started the timer yet, so you might want to stop urging me in that direction.” He continues mouthing at Sherlock’s abdomen, letting his tongue drag damp circles over his hipbone. Finally, he runs his hands up over long thighs, back and forth, then reaches to tap the start button.
“An experiment.” Sherlock seems momentarily surprised at the fact that he’s pronounced this correctly. “An experiment,” he says again, quietly but proudly, looking around the kitchen for kudos from anyone else he may find there.
Watching John recover from his admittedly wretched trick, Sherlock’s mouth drifts into a self-satisfied smirk. Then, slowly, deliberately, maintaining eye contact as long as he is able, Sherlock rotates over until he’s on all fours. He arches his back, sinks to his elbows, and peers around at John again, his mouth still curved into a challenge, his eyes alight with anticipation.
As Sherlock continues to breathe into his arm, his eyes shut tight, Irene returns the flogger to the table and picks up what looks to John to be a smaller, cordless version of a vibrating massager. She pushes it against a nipple, then switches it on.
He tries to remember if he had ever done that before, actually rung the bell, and he’s almost certain he hasn’t.
John sits back. “Get yourself off now. Push your pants down just enough for me to see you. And you don’t get to take your time. Make it quick.”
“Now. You understand that it’s entirely up to you to tell me that I need to stop.” As he talks, John pours lube onto his hand and works one finger, then two, into Sherlock. “I can do this all night. You, however, can’t. You cannot come, so you need to tell me when you’ve had enough. The word ‘stop’ will be fine. Do you understand?”
“You need to try harder. One more thing to help you focus, I think.” She moves to the wheel and raises the ceiling just another inch. He looks up at the lengthening of his arms, though they are still only on the cusp of being strained in any real way, then settles his gaze to the floor.
Irene stand back and looks at him. Naked, hard, blindfolded, hearing muted, mouth gagged, arms strained, balance precarious.
“Yes. I’m knitting a jumper for you, for Christmas.” John sets down his calamitous-looking phalanx of needles and reaches for a larger, neatly folded pile of fabric, the same blue, the same cables. He shakes it open and it’s the front and back of a sweater, with a V in the neck on one side, and loose ends around the holes where sleeves will eventually go.
“Yes, it is.” Sherlock’s fingers form silent notes across the strings of the instrument, his head leaning back in the chair, his eyes on the ceiling.
He sees a shadow cross Sherlock’s face, and a wave of regret passes through him. He nods toward their room. “Down here, I mean. Together.” They’ll hash it out in words tomorrow, they both know they can’t skip that part anymore, but it’s been a long night, and it’s enough that they’ve found their way back to this moment already. For now, it’s more than enough.
The heat is immediately stifling, and John tries to figure out whether a sweltering twenty-minute walk back to Baker Street would be better or worse than an even-more-sweltering ten-minute ride on the tube. He opts to walk after deciding to stop at Tesco’s on the way for whatever cold lunch options he can find. As he’s waiting in the queue, he notices one last bag of ice in the cooler and grabs it.
Sherlock turns his palms up and raises his hands in a gesture of mock surrender. “Just try drawing the bow across some strings. We’ll see what happens.”
“I’m getting a bit uncomfortable in my jeans. Do you know why?” he whispers in a low, even voice. Sherlock whines and inclines his head toward John’s mouth, but John grabs his hair and holds his head straight and still. Sherlock inhales sharply as his neck muscles tighten.
John’s eyes go a bit wet, and he laughs at himself. “I was just about to say ‘I never want to hurt you,’ but then realized how ridiculous that sounds. But it is true, somehow?” He smiles sheepishly. “I never want to hurt you, Sherlock, not ever. And I know I’m not making sense, but do you know what I mean?”
“Fuck, I’m close, Sherlock, I’m so close. I’m going to spill all over you. God, just listen to what seeing you like this makes me do. What I sound like when I can’t control myself any longer.”
And then she starts to giggle. And then properly laugh. And it’s possible she sounds like she’s murdering an owl, which makes John start to giggle, and then properly laugh, and Sherlock stares at them in determined annoyance except eventually his eyes crinkle and soon all three of them are doubled over, getting short of breath and wiping at their eyes, and as soon as it dies down for a second and they are close to some semblance of control, one or two or all look up at the flat and lose their minds all over again.
Turns out Sherlock is quite handy with a drill, although he grumbles about bullets being a more efficient method of putting holes in the wall.
“Oh, my God. Sherlock. Love. Look at me.” He waited until Sherlock finally turned back toward him, and then John held his gaze, for one moment, then another, then another. Sherlock’s eyes watered again and when he tried to turn his head, John’s hand traced his body up to his jaw, and brought him back.
Sherlock smiles back at her as he enters. John casts his eyes around the room, trying to take it all in without looking like that’s what he’s doing.
John opens his eyes to find Sherlock pulled up, looking at the phone, his brows knotted with instant curiosity.
He hears what sounds like Sherlock trying to drink whatever water has melted off the ice in his glass. A moment later, he sucks in a breath through his teeth at the feel of ice pressed into his wrist. He exhales and settles into the sensation as Sherlock drifts it up his arm.
“Really hard, actually. It’s one of the most difficult orchestral instruments to learn how to play properly.”
Sherlock lowers his head into the crook of John’s neck and shoulder and slams his hips home three more times until finally, finally, he lets go.
But some days he gets more than his fair share of hypochondriacs and people who practice no self-care and people who have looked up their problem on the internet and argue with his diagnosis and an image of Sherlock (facedown on the floor wrists and ankles cuffed together) floats behind his eyes and he can almost feel the dopamine ricochet through his brain.
“I don’t, actually.” But then Daniel digs into the front pocket of his jeans, and reaches his hand behind his back.
“Sherlock,” John says, his voice quiet, reassuring. “Tell me what you want. Nothing’s off the table, you know that. I’ll ask questions if I need to.”
“Now then,” Irene says, turning her attention to the figure kneeling still and silent by the door. “Sherlock Holmes. It’s been a while since you’ve been to see me. Should we review the rules?” She walks over to stand in front of him.
“That’s it, love, that was a minute, we’re all done. Try not to move.” John holds as still as he can, not wanting to so much as breathe, lest one more fraction of sensory input push Sherlock over the edge.
Upstairs, John stripped to his pants and climbed properly into the bed, then clicked open the SMS function on his phone and texted Molly.
mind. He kept that desire as his focus, his singular purpose. He kept moving, ignoring his own need just until he felt Sherlock’s muscles lock and watched his head snap back and heard a shuddered groan and felt the warm slickness between their bodies and yes, yes,
John slides from the bed and meets Sherlock at the door, holding the sweater body up against Sherlock’s chest. “I know you don’t usually wear knits, but I thought you might like it, just around the house, when it gets cold…”
“Okay,” John says. He feels trepidation, certainly, but it’s overshadowed by his genuine curiosity and desire to understand what all this means to Sherlock. Because as much as he can’t bear the idea of Sherlock in distress, he also can’t deny him a single thing.
John laves at Sherlock’s cock as Sherlock catches his breath, but in short order he goes back to work on John with renewed intensity. John is close, so close, and all he has to do is look down and see his cock disappearing into Sherlock’s long, pale, obscenely gorgeous throat, and he cries out, and comes, feeling Sherlock swallow him down, like he had done just seconds before.
John repositions the violin under his chin, adjusts his grip on the bow, arranges the fingertips of his left hand over the strings, and plays the first three notes of Brahms’ Lullaby.
Yes, John is the dom in this room, but neither of them are under any illusions that Sherlock isn’t the center of attention. Everything John does he does
John regards him, and chuckles. “Right. Terrible liar.” He holds Sherlock’s wrists with one hand and reaches over to pull a velcro cuff from between the mattress and the headboard. There are four of them, attached to each leg of the bed. The placement of the cuffs is part of Sherlock’s job before they start.
He takes a step forward and slowly, almost haltingly, brings his hand to the center of Sherlock’s chest, right where he placed it before. He feels a heartbeat through fabric and skin and sternum, and closes his eyes.
Their kisses are now all tongues and heat and sheer need, as palpable now as it was the first time they ever did this. John moves down to suck at Sherlock’s neck as he ghosts his fingertips down along Sherlock’s straining ribcage, and laughs when he feels a groan vibrate right where his mouth is pressed. He sits up and shifts back to draw his hands down over Sherlock’s thighs, catching the waistband of his pants and pyjama bottoms, pulling them down as Sherlock brings his knees up one a time to help shuck them off.
Bits and pieces of the previous evening began to poke through the black fog still surrounding John’s short-term memory. A frustrating day at the clinic, an invite for pints from Jeff and Lenore, and some other people, and then there were mixed drinks, some of them blue. And then there were shot glasses, and then someone lived next door? And there were possibly more shots? His memory trailed off as his stomach lurched.
John instinctively forms his lips into a kiss, then lifts his own hand to Sherlock’s neck and pulls him tighter into it. He kisses him once, then a second time, holding it there as long as he needs to, tasting the salty skin, smoothing the wild curls at the back of Sherlock’s head. He squeezes his own eyes shut against a rush of emotion he’s not feeling particularly equipped to deal with just at the moment.
“Outside,” he whispers, and stalks past him. He shoves his way through the crowd and out the front door. He moves around the side of the building to the alley and stops,  pulling the chilled air into his lungs and pushing it out again through his teeth, thinking how he did the same thing in the same alley two weeks ago and asked for this very thing.
Inside is a fairly nondescript black leather ID wallet. But the instructions included with it tells him that there is an app he can download which will sound an alarm if the wallet is ever more than five meters out of the range of his phone.
“Fine, this one then,” John interrupts, handing Sherlock a small box with a keyhole in the front of it. “And what the hell needs to be
“Um, okay, sure,” he stammers, glancing down at Sherlock, who is sitting back on his heels with his arms at his sides, his head bowed. Aside from some deep, even breathing, the only movement he’s making is with his hands, making fists and shaking them out in turn.
“I did, but my supervisor came in yesterday and said they had found someone else who wanted the overtime, and then he handed me your envelope.”
“A capital idea!” Sherlock shouts. He downs the water and stands up and immediately sits back down again, his arm stretching back along the table, his head lowering alongside it. “I might… just… sleep here, I think.”
It probably doesn’t register the first time because there are so many firsts happening these days, there’s no reason John should recognize it for what it is.
He keeps his eyes closed as he turns in place, a hundred and eighty degrees, and the sensation moves around his body, from the back of his neck to the center of his chest.
John waits, his eyes still tightly closed, a moment, then another, and then gasps involuntarily as he feels Sherlock’s flat tongue lick a long, slow stripe up the underside of his erection.
“Then your imagination is failing you,” Sherlock chides. His body shifts down the bed as he draws the ice lower along John’s torso, to his hip, and the sensitive line above his thigh, still following it with his tongue, and then John’s imagination catches up in a dawn of realization as Sherlock settles on his side. He props his head on his hand and looks back up the bed at John as he cheekily sucks the rest of the ice cube until it disappears.
“I’d give up every single thing on that list for you,” he says, knowing in his heart it is the absolute truth. “All of them. Without question or hesitation.”
He is struck by how this very conversation reflects the course of their entire unexpected relationship, nothing but diagonals and curves and forks and doglegs and doubling back. He’s proud of the way they’ve learned to negotiate their peculiar and complicated path, each now always in care of the other.
Sherlock shakes his head slightly. “Not yet. It’s a little busy up here tonight.” He puts a palm to his forehead, then slides his hand back through his own hair and lifts his head to look at John. “I can play you back to sleep, though? That one lullaby that always works?”
Sherlock lets that hang in the air for a moment. “So I left. For good, I thought, but it seems I couldn’t… stay away. I just couldn’t. I’m sorry.”
John knows he means it, and his heart wells a little bit, and maybe his eyes, too. It took them so fucking long to reach this point, the point where they could say out loud that the other’s happiness was more important than their own, and that’s why they were finally here.
Sherlock’s breath catches in his throat on every inhale, and he whines loudly throughout every exhale.
John lets Sherlock struggle for a few more moments, and sighs. “Jesus, Sherlock, you’re a terrible liar.”
John drifts awake when he feels Sherlock stretch and then heave himself slowly off the bed. Late afternoon sun is casting into the room through the curtains, the air still heavy and oppressive. He listens to Sherlock shuffle into the loo, has no choice but to listen to him use it, then listens to him move down the hall into the kitchen.
John leans back to reach behind him toward the cupboard, where he is just able to tease at the corner of a blanket with two fingers until it drops from its shelf. He throws one end as best he can over Sherlock’s long legs, then smooths it up over his shoulder. He returns his hand to Sherlock’s head, combing through his hair, stroking down over his back, then up again, over and over.
“You’re welcome,” Irene replies, holding his gaze. She lifts her hand up to cup his cheek, just briefly, before moving past him, unlocking the door, and making a quiet exit.
“Yes, please,” Sherlock replies. “A rugburned back at my age is just ridiculous.” He winces as he sits up, casting a terribly fake glance of annoyance at John’s giggle as they use the floor and the furniture and each other to finally pull themselves to their feet.
With a sigh and an eyeroll, but keeping his gaze on the ceiling, Sherlock lifted the book and held it out to John.
The pale skin of Sherlock’s chest and abdomen is splotched with a heated pink, evidence of their earlier activity.
“But no, you had to go and act up, and now I have to do this myself. And you can’t even see it. How full and hard I am, how I’m starting to leak…”
He hasn’t been staying awake every night since, waiting for him. Of course not. He just happens to be awake this night, at 11:41pm, when John’s key opens the front door.
Suddenly, the urge to relent overwhelms John in such a rush he almost feels his chest sink under its weight. Everything that’s happened tonight up until this moment, the fight, the anger, the storming off to his old bedroom, the dominating role he’s been indulging since he came downstairs, it all rushes down and out of him, into the floor, forgotten in an instant.
He’s not sure he’s ever seen anything hotter than the line of saliva that hangs from Sherlock’s mouth when he pulls off to cough and catch his breath.
John’s eyes narrowed as he studied Sherlock’s face. “You mean, when I tell you how fucking gorgeous you are?”
Sherlock has at least figured out that whatever is happening with all the needles means that John can keep knitting the tube around and around, instead of back and forth. The needle in his left hand is suddenly free, and John pops it in his mouth for a second as he lines up the stitches on the next needle over, then takes the empty needle in his right hand and starts again.
Sherlock has to work at keeping his eyes open and his breathing even. When John finally breaks their stare and closes his mouth around the shaft once again, Sherlock’s head tips back momentarily and he swallows the moan threatening to escape from his throat.
“For our parents,” Sherlock said, the disgust in his voice not able to entirely disguise a note of affection. “After a while it just became a thing. Every year we find a Santa, get the photo framed, put it under the tree on Christmas morning. My mother brings them all out and scatters them around the house every December.”
But John only allows Sherlock a couple of pulls before he puts an end to it with a brusque “That’s enough” as he steps clear of Sherlock’s mouth.
John continues, low and close. “I’m going to suck you off for one solid minute. And I want you to picture me jerking myself off at the same time, because that’s what I’ll be doing.” He bites at Sherlock’s earlobe, just hard enough to sting. “But you remember your rules, right? Don’t you dare come. And don’t think about something else, or I’ll know. You have to think about me, naked and kneeling in front of you, my mouth on your cock, my hand on mine.” Sherlock issues a moan of pure need, and nods in shaky agreement.
When John straightens up again, Sherlock runs his hands slowly up John’s bare thighs and leans forward to bury his nose in the cloth alongside John’s erection. He takes a long, slow inhale, until John suddenly grips the hair at the back of his head and pulls it away. Sherlock gasps, and John’s voice is an angry, tight whisper in Sherlock’s ear.
John lets him catch his breath for just a second before hitting the button again. He turns it off quite quickly, then waits a beat, turns it on for another two full seconds, then off. He waits six seconds, turns it on for three, turns it off. He continues in an irregular rhythm, watching Sherlock twist his head back and forth, then lift it up off the pillow, then back down. He’s jerking his ankles and wrists away from each other but the restraints hold tight, causing his knees to splay out as his body struggles to find some way to absorb the stimulation.
Downstairs, he pushes open the door to 221C, turns back to slide the lock home, and walks a short hallway to what used to be an ordinary living room, but is now their own version of Room 3 in a row house in Maida Vale. There is a smaller version of the cage, with an adjustable ceiling. There is an armoire, fully stocked with implements of all shapes and sizes. There's a bench, and a sofa on the wall opposite the cage.
“I haven’t finished,” John continues. “I’m going to have a wank, right at the end of your bed, and you’re going to watch me, but you have to watch my face, and only my face.” John smiles when Sherlock’s expression turns frustrated again.
Despite hugging the bag of ice on the rest of his walk home, he is dripping with sweat by the time he reaches the flat, and he can feel the temperature rise with each slow step up to the sitting room. John stashes the ice in the freezer, appreciating the air that hits him when he opens the door, then deposits containers of pasta salad and fruit in the fridge. A glance at the table tells him Sherlock has at least been up this morning, but he hasn’t seen or heard him since he walked in.
John straightens back up, and his pace gets more frenetic and uneven. He grips Sherlock’s hip with one hand while the other threads up the back of Sherlock’s neck, closes tightly around unruly curls, and yanks his head up. With his throat extended, Sherlock can’t hide the grunted exhales matching John’s thrusts, and the raw, shameless sounds send John careening mindlessly over the edge.
When the elevator opens, he walks sixteen steps to his front door, during which he slides his hand into his pocket and finds his front door key by practiced feel so when he extracts his hand, the key is settled between thumb and forefinger. He slides it into the lock, turning it smoothly and pushing the door open. His left hand drops his umbrella into the stand just inside the door as his right pulls the key from the lock and closes the door behind him. He turns to drop his keys into the ancient ceramic bowl on the credenza as he punches in the code to disable the alarm on the keypad above it, then turns and walks eleven steps to the the antique bar cart in his foyer.
John’s voice is low and barely audible. “Why did you let me…” He stops and takes one deep, even breath. “Why. Why did you let me
“Very good,” Irene says, after she’s circled him a few more minutes. She moves back to the bench and lays down the crop, then pulls on a pair of black latex gloves. She reaches over to one of the bottles by the sink and pumps what John decides must be lube into one palm. On her way back to Sherlock, she casually picks up an item from the bench, hooking it around a finger by its ring handle.
? Have you been at your herbal soothers again?” Sherlock shrugs out of his coat and turns in place, unable to find a single available surface on which to deposit it.
So Sherlock moves his hands to John’s waist and pulls down as he thrusts up his hips, grinding their erections together.
Irene turns to him. “To him? You are.” She stands up and looks back to Sherlock. “John. Would you like to bring him out of it?”
Sherlock falls back to his heels. After a few moments, he lets his hands drift to John’s abdomen, his fingers curling over the waistband of his pyjama bottoms and pants. John helps him out, lifting his hips off the chair, and Sherlock slides the clothing off his body.
He did know that whatever was about to happen to him, he would deserve every minute of, and he vowed to stand there and take it until there was nothing left to take.
Sherlock, his eyes locked on John’s, pushes his tongue out of his mouth and lets it hang there for a second before moving it back to the head of John’s cock.
John scrubbed a hand over his face as the knot in his already sickened stomach grew tighter. “My phone…” he mumbled. “Why didn’t he just track…”
Sherlock groans as he tries to lower his arms. “Easy,” John says quietly. “Keep them up there a minute.” He turns him around and rubs the circulation back into his left bicep and tricep, then works the top of his shoulder and the muscles under his shoulder blade. He slowly lowers the arm, pausing for a moment when he hears Sherlock suck in a breath through his teeth, then continues, settling it at his side.
“Push up off your knees for a second,” he says quietly, and as Sherlock lifts up, he slides a small cushioned mat in place underneath. “Okay, back down.” When Sherlock is steady again, John slides his hands down one arm to encircle his wrist. “Let me have this,” he says, and Sherlock shifts his weight to the other side. John brings his wrist back to the grid and cuffs it, the restraint holding his arm back and away from his body at a carefully predetermined angle, designed to cause stress, but not pain. John does the same to the other arm as Sherlock breathes hotly through his teeth, rolling his shoulders, adjusting his hips, futilely trying to find a comfortable position.
She smiles kindly. “There’s no trick to this part. Wait for him to come down a little more. You’ll know when he’s ready.”
That’s not why. That can’t be why. Knowing John is out there, asleep, is not why he is in here, not asleep.
When he’s finished, John sets the saucer back on the tray and rubs his hands over his eyes again. “Do you mind if I stay? Just… another couple of hours.”
John lets his hips drop to Sherlock’s body and slides down until he can feel the pressure he knew he’d find. “See? I can already tell how hard you are. Your protests are for shit. This is exactly what you want.”
John counts fourteen Santa Clauses on various surfaces before he can’t remember if he counted the Elvis one already and gives up. There are seven stockings hung over the fireplace, six snow globes on the mantel (two of them are rotating), and a family of five stuffed polar bears under the table, either standing guard over or preparing to eat the Three Wise Men.
“It’s okay,” John says truthfully. “I never mind listening to you play. That one was a bit sad, yeah?”
No, it’s not the request that has John bothered. It’s the way it’s being requested. Sherlock isn’t ordinarily hesitant to ask for anything.
She alternates between running it along his cock and leaving it vibrating at the base, back and forth, over and over. Occasionally she'll switch it off, let him just get his bearings, then switch it back on and start again.
Sherlock’s stubborn facade dissolves, his eyes widen. His mouth moves for a second before he forms the whispered words: “I can’t.”
John gives in to laughter as he steps into the bathroom and peels his sticky clothes from his body. He turns the water on to a temperature just barely above full-blast cold, and steps into the shower.
“And…” Sherlock knits his brows together. “Don't let me…” He fidgets, breathes, closes his eyes. “Not tonight.”
A 1970’s-era Santa Claus was smiling back at him from under the cellophane. On his lap was a screaming bald baby wearing a snapsuit with elves on it and booties, one red, one green. Standing not too close to Santa, arms at his sides and a murderous look in his eye, is a six-year-old reddish-blonde boy in a green-and-white-striped knitted sweater vest with a red button band and gold buttons.
“Sherlock? Is that you?” John thinks he’s speaking at a normal volume, but his voice is only a whisper. “Sherlock?” he tries again, but it’s still a whisper, and the notes are starting to sound strange now, and there’s a staircase in front of him that wasn’t there a second ago, and somewhere in the back of his head he begins to realize he’s dreaming.
(John used to hate The Face, before, but now he loves it. Sometimes he lies about not understanding something just to get Sherlock to make The Face. He is only sort of doing it this time. He knows he is babbling. He is really jittery.)
“Of course. But your room is still… I mean, the bed’s still there. You don’t want to sleep upstairs?”
Sherlock stares up at him, instinctively hunching over the instrument. “Have you ever played the violin before?”
John takes a deep breath. “Well, I can, at first, if you’d prefer, but the idea was… no, not upstairs. Eventually.”
“Muuum…” Ollie rolls his eyes, embarrassed but secretly touched by his mother’s affection. He squeezes her back, then kisses the top of her head. “It must have been a Christmas gift from my supervisor, though I never would have figured him to be that sentimental. Now, have you got anything in? I’m starving!”
John’s anger is palpable but quiet, evident in the slow, even cadence of his response. “No, you won’t. Go back downstairs and go to bed. I will see you in the morning.”
Irene slowly brings the wand up toward Sherlock’s collarbone. When it is about half an inch from his skin, there’s a crackling noise as the wand sparks bright purple.
Sherlock rolls his eyes closed. “Okay, just relax. Move it around under your chin until it feels right.”
Sherlock settles against John’s chest, in the same position as before. They breathe together in silence for a few minutes, and John wonders if Sherlock has slipped into sleep until he hears his muffled voice.
“Well, okay,” Daniel says in a low voice when they finally separate. “John. Um... you know, upstairs… we can…”
So he’s trying to leave the flat at 5:15am and of course it’s raining and as he moves into the living room to grab his laptop from the desk he’s calculating how long it will take him to get a cab and he stops because there’s John again, on the couch, asleep, in very nearly the exact same position.
John is staring at her, stuck on the fact that she just calmly invited him to have a wank in front of her if he needed one, until he realizes he’s supposed to say something. “No,” he tries once, then clears his throat when he hears his voice didn’t work. “I’ll just…” and sits back down awkwardly, then closes his eyes for one deep breath, listening to the sound of Irene’s heels as she crosses the room.
. He dries off and wraps the towel around his waist, then peeks in the bedroom. Sherlock hasn’t moved a muscle and appears to be sleeping, so John pads to the kitchen and digs into the pasta salad, eating half the container while standing irresponsibly in front of the open fridge.
As John catches his breath, he draws one finger along Sherlock’s strained erection, spreading the fluid along its surface. Sherlock’s muscles have gone almost completely still, save for the rise and fall of his chest, each breath faster than the one before.
John maintains his tight grip on Sherlock’s hair as he groans into his ear. His need swallows him and he dissolves.  “God, fuck, yes yes
“God, Sherlock,” and John can’t resist the urge to thrust into him, biting back the apology that almost escapes when Sherlock gags on him.
“I don’t want a lot of fuss,” he says quietly. “Expressions of gratitude…” He waves his hand dismissively.
John stops the vibrator instantly and, as quickly as he can, slides the toy free of Sherlock’s body. Sherlock’s arms are ramrod straight at his sides, his knees pressed together tightly. He grimaces, gasping loudly through his teeth, and tries to come down.
He takes Sherlock into his mouth, gently at first, then increasing the pressure, feeling him harden again against his tongue. He is wary of going either too fast or too slow; they are done with games for tonight, done with domination and punishment, done with denying and delaying. He doesn’t want to draw it out; it doesn’t need to be mind-blowing, not now, not this time. He wants only to make Sherlock feel
“Thank you,” Sherlock says, and John can hear that he means it, but his face is still passive, exhausted, inscrutable. John gently hovers over him, leaning in for a tentative, languid kiss, which Sherlock accepts without hesitation.
“Dammit,” John sighed. His shoulders slumped toward the ground, and he turned and trudged upstairs without another word.
He blinks and scrubs a hand through his hair to dissipate the last fuzzy sensations of the dream. Sherlock is, in fact, playing the violin in the sitting room, but he’s using his practice mute, a metal device that fits over the bridge and dampens the volume. He always uses it when he plays in the middle of the night, like he is now.
John reaches for his mobile and taps open the timer. “Yes, you can. I know you can. Just one minute. You can yell anything you want the whole time, beg me, curse me, but I won’t stop unless you say ‘yellow’. If you do, I’ll pull off immediately, but I’m also hitting pause on this.” He shows Sherlock the single minute on the timer. “You can take just the time you need to collect yourself, no more, and we’re going to finish sixty seconds before the lights can go on.”
The girl taps at an iPad mounted on a stand to her left. She looks at the screen and waits, then returns her gaze to her phone when the iPad provides whatever information she was waiting for. “Okay. You can go on down.”
“Sorry, love,” John breathes, and Sherlock’s hand covers John’s, squeezing a reassurance as he resumes his rhythm.
Irene lets him rebalance, then returns the wand to its target, holding it close enough to spark again. Sherlock shudders, groaning slightly on every exhale, but he’s expecting it now, and doesn’t try to move away.
of John’s patience, of quiet nights and occasional pints and working cases and doing the shopping, and making sure everything he ever did said I’m here, I’m right here beside you and I’m never leaving again, knowing that trying to reassure him with mere words would never get it done.
When Sherlock returns to the open waistband, biting as deep into the fabric as he can, and begins to try tugging it down, John realizes that they’d be here all night if he actually made Sherlock do this. Instead, he gently pushes Sherlock’s head back for a moment, and shoves the denim down to just above his knees.
“John...” Sherlock starts to push up again, but John threads a hand into his hair and keeps him pressed to his chest.
He moves to the control panel for the grid and lowers the back wall forward to a very precise angle out from the floor. As always, while John prepares, Sherlock never moves, never looks up, never acknowledges in any way that anything is happening around him.
“Sher… Sherlock.” It comes out a whisper, and John clears his throat to find his voice. “Sherlock, love, it’s okay, you can stop. You’re… I think you’re overstimulated.” John slides off the chair, falling quietly to his knees, and reaches for Sherlock’s wrist again. He gently stops its motion, pulling it off his cock, which bobs obscenely back up toward his stomach, still rock hard and strained.
, I just didn’t… remember, I suppose, so I got up to have a drink.” Sherlock lifts his head from the wall and looks at John through wide eyes. “I think,” he whispers loudly, “I might have had more than one.” He gives a serious nod.
“Look at him, John, and tell me there can’t be beauty in suffering. He’s gorgeous right now, and you know it.”
John moves to thread his fingers through the hair at the back of Sherlock’s head, letting him know he’s awake. Sherlock starts moving over John with purpose, pulling a nipple into his mouth, grazing it with his teeth, and finally biting down on it, eliciting a muffled groan that John suspects was the intent.
“Yeah, I think you might have done,” John says, urging him on into the bedroom. He tries to keep Sherlock standing steadily while pulling back the covers, then lets him sit down on the edge of the bed.
But the kiss is hard and messy and nothing is being erased. He can't find Sherlock; all he can taste is the bitter tang of his own adrenaline. He pushes in, and pulls back, and pushes in again, over and over until his jaw starts to hurt. For Sherlock’s part, he meets every one of John’s demands, but makes none of his own. He doesn’t try to push away from the wall, and his arms stay at his sides.
So he climbed the stairs with his absurdly large paper bag containing five boxes of portents of nothing less than weekly doom.
John removes the dildo and its vibrating bullet from the drawer beside the bed. The toy itself is blue silicone in a vague hook shape, with one end that vibrates against the prostate while the other end rests against the perineum. The small but powerful vibrator mechanism slips into a sleeve along the shaft, and John can turn it on and off by pressing a button at the outer end.
Whatever the reason, he is not asleep for a long time, and he is not asleep when daylight breaks and he is not asleep when he hears John get up from the couch and make his way through the kitchen and down the hall and Sherlock stops breathing when John is outside his door.
“On your knees,” John says casually as he pushes the door closed behind him. This was always how it began. A simple directive, a starting point, to help Sherlock’s mind settle into John’s commands.
John laughs kindly, thinking of how rarely he’s ever able to render Sherlock speechless. “The extra shifts I’ve been taking at work? Some of them were lessons.” He suddenly feels almost shy with embarrassment. “I was going to surprise you on Christmas morning, wrap up my crap music store student violin and let you open it. I’ve been learning ‘We Wish You A Merry Christmas,’ too.” He laughs again when he sees Sherlock’s expression hasn’t changed. “Honestly, I never know what to get you, so…”
The second time was two days later, a bit more in the heat of the moment. And it wasn’t that John didn’t notice it. He just thought it was something else.
Not as startling a part of this display as it otherwise might be on its own is the three-foot-wide gold plastic menorah sitting on the center of their desk with what is clearly a Christmas tree skirt wrapped around its base.
Then she grabs the cord connecting the nipple clamps and in one swift, powerful motion, yanks them off.
“Nope, not suspicious at all,” John said, picking his newspaper back up and shaking it open. “Look, just let me know if we’re going to be on the news later, okay? I have a Christmas tree jumper I’ll need to put on.”
Sherlock raises his head at the contact and takes a deep breath around the ball gag, leaning forward as much as he can. John feels like Sherlock is trying to sink into his hand, a physical sigh of relief, and has to blink away tears at the honesty of the reaction.
Sherlock bounded up the stairs a few hours later, then stopped in the doorway, almost offended. “There’s no tea? I’m starving.”
John keeps his grip on Sherlock’s hair as he suddenly stands up, and before Sherlock has time to catch his breath from the devastating kiss, John slides his cock fully into Sherlock’s open mouth.
“What kind of experiment?” John says, adopting the same tone of voice he just used for the last four hours with the drunk students, one of exaggerated genuine interest. Trying to have the most ridiculous conversation possible is the most fun you can have as a completely sober person talking to a completely drunk person. He digs in the drawer for their own bottle of paracetamol, because apparently he has one more dose to dole out, then finds a clean glass in the cupboard and holds it under the tap.
John pulls off of Sherlock and leans back, catching his breath. Sherlock moans at the loss of contact, his erection jutting forward, slick and glistening in the low light.
“Oh, fuck you,” John mutters, finally closing his eyes and giving over to the sensation. His head falls back when he feels Sherlock’s fist wrap around him once more, working in tandem with this mouth, and John is no longer interested in delaying. He starts thrusting his hips in rhythm with Sherlock’s pulls, and grips the sides of the chair with all his might.
Sherlock reaches his hands out and feels his way up, resting them at John’s hips. He shuffles forward a bit on his knees and presses his mouth to John’s belly, lowering it by feel to the button of his jeans. He sets his teeth on the corner of fabric above the button and pulls up and back, trying to stretch the buttonhole wide enough. It takes several tries, but when the button finally pops free, he shuffles closer again, angling his head to find the zipper pull, which he lowers over the course of several sharp, awkward jerks.
He gives Sherlock a moment to get used to it before sliding the vibrator into the sleeve. He pushes the button to turn it on and almost immediately turns it back off, but not before Sherlock’s hips lift off the bed, as much as they can, in response.
John shifted up to his knees, then took Lestrade’s hand and lurched to his feet, slightly embarrassed at how much of the heavy lifting Lestrade had to do to get him there. When he raised his head, his vision swam for a second, until something in the distance, in the hallway behind Lestrade, began to come into focus. The back of a coat, a dark head of hair, moving away from where he was standing. Or swaying, more accurately.
“No, love, it wasn’t me,” she said, puzzling for a moment, but then giving in to the urge to snake her arms around her only child’s middle one more time, and pressing her cheek to his chest. “There must be a Secret Santa out there who knew how much I was missing you lately.”
After a while she just leaves the vibrator in place just above his erection and moves it with him as he bucks into it, relentless, for ten, twenty, thirty seconds. His grunts become desperate whines, and his breaths are shorter and shorter as he tries to keep fighting.
Irene turns the dial back down and returns the wand to his stomach, letting it pass slowly back and forth, creeping lower over his hip and upper thigh. Sherlock holds his breath as she trails it down between his legs, then wails as she drifts it up over his balls and down the length of his cock, which continues to thicken.
Sherlock stops in front of John. “That is also a good idea.” He leans down to steal one more kiss, during which John feels Sherlock tuck something into the front pocket of his jeans.
John,” actually runs into him, but John barely notices as Sherlock stumbles around him and is similarly shocked into silence.
It is always the first thing John says upon entering 221C. He says it now, before he has even pushed the door all the way open.
John laughs. “Not all of them, no. Some of them. The one I wore that Christmas, before…” He trails off. “But this is the first one I’ve made since I moved back in. Or it will be, if you will ever leave me to finish it in peace.”
He holds his left hand against Sherlock’s heaving sternum, and with his right, releases Sherlock’s wrist from the buckle. He cradles it lightly, checking for injury, any unintentional twist or sprain.
There’s a blindfold. There are also wireless headphones covering Sherlock’s ears, through which he is receiving a constant low blur of white noise. A six-inch-long metal bar is set across his mouth like a bit,  the leather strap secured behind his head.
The quick, purposeful motion brings Sherlock back to his elbows and John looks up. His eyes are shooting daggers, and he adjusts his pace from too fast to achingly, maddeningly slow. He doesn’t break eye contact as he pulls off and makes one long, wet,
“How about we keep you closest to the toilet tonight,” John says, lifting Sherlock’s legs at the ankles and tucking them in carefully. He pulls the covers up around his shoulders, and strokes his head one more time.
“Yeah. Puberty is such bullshit. I lost the cute towhead, and the growth spurt was apocryphal.” John laughed at himself, but Sherlock just kept staring at the photo, at John’s smiling, goofy, innocently wide-open twelve-year-old face.
Sometimes he tries to piece it back together from his ghosting short-term memory, just to amuse himself. He’s still chuckling at “elbow prosthesis” as Sherlock jabbers on behind him when he hits the landing and starts to head into the flat, except he stops dead in the doorway.
Sherlock stared at John, who stared back, then opened his hands in a palms-up, it’s-your-choice gesture.
While Sherlock rings the bell and looks up at a camera in the corner of the portico, John glances back at the street. He knows it is impossible that anyone blithely walking would know why they are there, but still not totally certain that they don’t.
“Of course not,” Mycroft said, lowering his chin and ducking in through the door to the kitchen, his back to John as he headed down the hallway.
And Sherlock punches the pillow because the not sleeping and the not breathing are definitely things that require more data, and he’s not sure it’s data he wants to collect.
She drifts the vibrator up from his nipple along his collarbone and the arm stretching up from his shoulder, then guides it back down and around his ribcage to his back. John assumes she is running it down his spine, from the way Sherlock extends his chest and belly forward, and then he can hear it vibrating against the glass butt plug before Sherlock moans loud and long, ending with a shudder.
He leaned up and sealed his promise with a gentle, questioning kiss, and almost went lightheaded at the forgiveness he finally felt there. Desire stirred in his gut, and after a long moment, he breathed a few words into Sherlock’s mouth.
Sherlock sits back and lowers his head a moment, a small indication of contrition before he tries again. Maintaining his balance blindfolded and without his hands is difficult, and it takes a moment before he shuffles his way to the right position. Using his nose to open the gap in John’s boxers, he reaches in with his lips and tongue and makes several fruitless attempts to somehow hook John’s cock and pull it out. When that doesn’t work, he finds his way to the lower half of the opening and bites down on one side the fabric there, pulling it around John’s erection until he feels it finally bob free. He follows its hard length with his cheek until he reaches the head, which he surrounds with his mouth and a groan of satisfaction, sucking down to the base and back out again.
He goes to 221B and sits in his chair until the sun comes up, then crawls onto Sherlock’s bed and sleeps until nightfall.
“Where are we?” John finally asked, his voice still dry and cracking. He was curled on his side in the backseat of Lestrade’s car, his arms wrapped around his middle, his eyes squeezed shut against the bright and evil sunlight that seemed to be pouring in from every direction.
And instantly Sherlock froze and fisted the sheets and came back to himself, the look of ecstasy replaced with an almost indistinguishable look of distress. But John saw it for what it was, and slowed his movement, then stopped altogether and pulled himself up.
So as soon as he sees the silk leave Sherlock’s hand, John steps back, withdrawing from Sherlock’s mouth, and drops to his knees. He brings one hand gently but firmly alongside Sherlock’s head and focuses on keeping his voice low and calm.
They have conversations about using 221C as punishment, when, say, Sherlock behaves particularly poorly at a crime scene, but it doesn’t feel quite right to either of them. This isn’t about working through Sherlock’s stroppy moods. If it
But Sherlock is already naked and kneeling in the center of the caged area, sitting back on his heels, hands in his lap. His head is bowed, his eyes are closed, his breathing is so slow and steady that it is almost silent.
“I don’t know what you think you’re playing at, but it’s useless,” John says calmly as Sherlock continues to struggle. Then his voice deepens, and he leans up into Sherlock’s ear. “I always get what I want, do you understand? Always. And the more you fight, the worse it will get for you.”
like…” - Sherlock regards the table, thinks with his face, and then spreads his hands triumphantly - “I’ve opened a bar in our kitchen.”
John’s head spun for a second. He had no idea how many partners Sherlock had had before - he supposed they’d talk about it one day, when they had moved through this first phase of having sex almost every minute they were awake - but it seemed impossible that not one of them had praised him. Unless they had, and then never tried again. Sherlock’s discomfort was not false modesty, it was clearly genuine anguish, and John could see how it might put off a casual lover, and he found himself getting angry at everyone Sherlock had ever met who made him feel less than what he was.
Frankly, John doesn’t like it either, but it’s not the queasy discomfort he felt when he was lashing at Sherlock’s skin with a weapon. This was basically punishment by withholding a reward, and that, he could deal with.
“Do you…” The stranger smiles, exhales, tries again. “Sorry, do you want to dance?” He angles his body back toward the dance floor.
“No.” It’s a whisper. John has enabled the confession, and they’re still here, still entwined, still breathing, each of them vulnerable, but trying desperately to navigate this moment with honesty.
He hears rather than sees Sherlock enter. He hears the removal of his coat and scarf, the careful hanging of them on the coat rack, the short walk to the desk, the retrieval of the laptop, the settling calmly onto the sofa.
John allows himself a glance at Sherlock’s body, and sees with satisfaction that Sherlock’s cock is thick and hard, straight up against his own stomach.
Sherlock hooks his thumbs inside his pyjamas and hitches them down over his erection to the middle of his thighs. He smears John’s saliva over the shaft of his cock, then slides the flat of his palm over the head, adding the pre-ejaculate to the crude lubrication, and starts to slide his fist up and down, slowly at first, then building speed to a steady rhythm. His eyes fall closed.
“You’re not,” John said, still smoothing his hand in circles over Sherlock’s midsection. “Talk to me.”
Minutes pass, and John doesn’t move. He waits for Sherlock’s breathing to return to normal, watches carefully as his erection fades and the rest of his body relaxes along with it. When he sees Sherlock make a couple of small involuntary jerks, a reaction to the chill he must be feeling as the sweat evaporates from his body, John releases each cuff, massaging Sherlock’s long limbs as he goes, warming the skin and restoring circulation. He gently bends each leg at the knee, then settles it on the mattress at a relaxed angle, and does the same for his arms, laying them carefully at his sides. Sherlock still hasn’t moved of his own accord.
Of course, dear brother Sherlock does not know or does not care that Liège - a Belgian province - is the second industrialization centre in the world and that the English Government needs to have an accord with Belgium if our nation wants to stay the leader; why would I have other things to do than playing nanny to Sherly and baby Watson, I ask you?! But as PC Clark is a good constable and an even better man, as he certainly was sure he would help his two friends by coming and recounting their possible problems to their Mother Hen - in other words I - I put my pen down and encouraged him to talk.
“I still don’t know what you get me for Valentine’s day.”, that made the Detective laugh, not the quiet chuckle he would display in society, a true barking laugh coming from the heart, a noise Watson suspected to be the only one to ever hear, love and trust distilled in one sound. “If you think I’m going to leave this bed anytime soon, my man, I’m sorry to tell you, but you’re wrong.”; stepping over his lover, the Doctor retrieved Holmes’ dressing gown, grumbling “So much for spoiling be…” and went to fetch both his and the Detective’s presents, laughing softly to Sherlock’s quip: “I’m deeply sorry, my dear, but seeing you wearing
Christmas is supposed to be a merry celebration, everything is about love, about family, about traditions. Therefore, it may be a little awkward when three gentlemen as John Watson, Sherlock and myself spend it together. And it is downright rude to speak about what something is « supposed » to be, nothing is as it is supposed to be with the siblings Holmes, thank you very much.
Not fifteen minutes later, he almost jumped out of his chair when he felt someone suddenly leaning on him.
.”. They were, indeed, anonymous music sheets scattered between Bach, Tchaikovsky, Mozart and Rossini’s; with titles as mysterious as “Eden and Hell”, “The Demon’s Gift” and “ineffable”. “I thought you wouldn’t care about them, it really seemed like the perfect gift and I knew you would be angry if I chose something too expensive.”, “You’re absolutely right, my good man, I don’t need you to empty your wallet for me, but these unknown pieces look very interesting; I think I will try “The Demon’s Gift” as soon as leaving this bed will seem acceptable… Your turn, now.”
Lightly flushed from these thoughts and the heat of the water, Watson let himself be wrapped in the towel before putting his dressing gown on and being led to the common room. There, he found a chair, back to the fireplace, on which a blanket was keeping warm for him and a glass of brandy waiting on the table next to his armchair. In a matter of seconds, he was luxuriating in warmth, cosiness and happiness. Holmes was lightly babbling about an article he had read earlier that day and Watson though he was the nearest he could from Heaven. When the Detective took a pause in his rambling to serve a second drink to his friend, Watson finally said:
Even after years of cohabitation, even after dozens of cases solved side by side, John Watson still was astonished by Holmes’ powers of deduction. He never grew tired of it, and knew he never would.
explain the birds and the bees to John Watson. I did my share of good deeds by asking for his confession and listening to it. Enough!
John really didn’t mind to be laid on the floor, but a bed was definitely a better place; he wasn’t getting any younger and his old war wounds weren’t as open-minded as he himself was. Count on Sherlock to be aware about it all and take the right decisions. But even sprawled out in bed, blissful and sated, John Watson still was a very curious man; and, contrary to the proverb, it was an essential quality when working with one Sherlock Holmes.
So, Doctor John Watson, known by his acquaintances to be a good man, amenable, sympathetic, loyal - especially to my brother - had decided to laugh - rather cruelly - at his best friend’s, brother-in-arms’ depends. Not even laughing at his depends, stabbing him in his pride. Why? Why would a man to be married throw a tantrum - there is no better word for this kind of behaviour - because his best friend is (supposedly) in love? How the assumed feelings Watson thinks Sherlock has for Adler could be a bother? First things first, Sherlock is not in love with Miss Adler, and if Watson had not been so oblivious, he would know that, but he does not. There are only two options: either Watson wants to be the only one of the two to find love, get married, have a family; but it is very unlikely given the man is utterly unable to be this egoistical or ill-minded, either... Either he is jealous, not because he wants to be the only one to be happy, not jealous of Sherlock, but of Adler. He wants to be the one Sherlock is experiencing feelings for. He cannot stand the love he so desperately wants to be given to anyone else, especially not to a woman like Irene Adler, someone he is certain would break his dear Holmes’ heart without batting an eyelash. If the problem had only been that he thought the woman unworthy of Sherlock’s love, he would not have been this vociferous. And, if Watson is so sure his love is unrequited, why wouldn’t he marry Miss Morstan and try his second chance? My God...
His voice was gentle and, when Watson managed the strength to open an eye, he saw Holmes was holding a fluffy towel and that he didn’t seem to want to leave. Watson knew he should ask the Detective to leave the room while he exited the tub, or at least feel a little uneasy to be this exposed before his friend, but he wasn’t. He was far too used to live in close proximity with the other man, to the little touches on the knee or the shoulder, to be groped to be put out of danger and to grape the Detective in return for the same purpose, to the little whispers, to the knowing smiles, to the… Stop. Not the right place nor the right moment.
“You seem a little confounded, my dear man, let me explain my train of thoughts. You probably noticed Valentine’s day was coming only a few days ago, when the advertisements became impossible to pass by in the newspapers and thought finding a present to give me during this celebration reserved for the lovers would be a bright idea. You’re a tasteful man - if I may say - so I’m quite sure you didn’t simply buy flowers or chocolates - they would have been welcome, by the way, you may think I’m a difficult lover to please, but everything coming from you would be cherished - anyway, I know you found what you were searching for on Wednesday.”, Watson was thankful, as he was so very often, for his excellent memory and knew he would have to dissect this statement over and over again before beginning to understand its ins and outs, for now, he simply was trying to not look too much like a fish out of water, but was doing a rather poor job. “Did you think I wouldn’t notice your excitement and deduced where it went from? You were positively glowing, John. Then you forced yourself to not think about it less I would point something out and deduced what you were up to. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to spoil your little surprise. Oh, don’t look so astounded, John! You might like to make your readers believe I’m some kind of machine, cold and heartless, but you know there is very little I wouldn’t willingly do for you! Where was I, now? Ah, yes, upon taking your breakfast this morning - and even if you know that I need some time to emerge out of Morpheus’ embrace - as well as yours, I really can’t fathom why you got up as your usual time this morning, my dear… Breakfast at eight O’clock, at the table, on Valentine’s day? I was hoping we would share another feast than Mrs. Hudson’s cooking, but whatever, lunch would suit me equally well. So, you saw me still half asleep and suddenly thought Valentine’s day may not be my cup of tea, after all.”
« Well sir, I had come to Baker Street to tell Mr. Holmes about Blackwood’s resurrection - I’m sure you know everything about it, Mr. Holmes, sir, and therefore I won’t recall the whole sordid story to you - so, I was in the stairs when I heard Doctor Watson voice - and he had a strange tone, sir, all bitter and... And I may say ‘arrogant’ - nothing like the Doctor Watson we know, I am sure you would have agreed with me, sir, if you had heard him. So, I carefully listen to what Doctor Watson is saying - while trying my best to be silent, as Mr. Holmes surely would have heard me in the stairs or recognize my pace if I had not been this careful, and then I would not have been able to listen to what was happening. Anyway, I heard Doctor Watson talking to Mr. Holmes about a woman...
After this tediously long stage-setting, I could not stop myself from interrupting the policeman: there was no need for me to hear all his story if he were to inform me Watson and my brother had had an argument because the former wanted to get married. I knew and, as unfortunate as it may seem, my Belgian Prime Minister would still need to be first taken care of. But Mrs. Watson-to-be was not the problematic lady here.
« Yes, sir. So, Mr. Holmes did not answer - or if he did, I did not hear him, and I was listening very carefully so it’s really unlikely - and then Doctor Watson attacked again; he asked her if Mr. Holmes loved this person because she had humiliated him twice. »
Words were John Watson’s field of expertise; he was a writer, after all. But there was only one word he could find to describe what he was truly feeling for Holmes, a word which means “too great or extreme to be expressed or described in words”: ineffable. A fervent kiss would be a good beginning to convey the feeling without words.
Compared to Sherlock Holmes, everyone seems to be stupid; owning an IQ somewhere between the footballer and the chimpanzee, Watson was used to that feeling (even if Holmes always did his best to subtly praise his Doctor; never tell Holmes his Watson in a dumbass if you don’t want it to be your last words), however, he had never been as lost as now.
I really had had the intention to send a letter to my little brother, asking him for an appointment, but, unlike Sherlock whose name is known by all of London, if not Great Britain, I had very soon learnt that anonymity is the real key to freedom, power and success, which I rightly can tell as the embodiment of the Government. But, as the embodiment of the Government, even as free, powerful and successful as I am, I have a lot of duties and responsibilities, and some of them simply can’t be put aside, even for rescuing my little brother from his own obliviousness. However, I can very well turn everyone I need into a mole for my account, and that is how I found myself, interrupted in the middle of writing a letter to the Belgian Prime Minister by PC Clark.
Aziraphale had barely had time to take his overcoat off that somebody was entering his library. “Mr. Fell, Sir?”. A telegraph boy. “That would be me, what can I do for you?”. The lad smiled to the Angel, “Telegram for you, Sir.”; the note said, “Diner at Simpsons’[7]?”. Aziraphale’s couldn’t have been more happy. “Will there be an answer, Sir?”, “Yes, just a minute. Oh, I went to the bakery just this morning, how would you like a brioche while I’m writing the answer?”
“Shush! I saw your prescriptions earlier, nobody will die from a cold and you already reviewed the poor ones who have the flu. You will plan your round tomorrow morning in front of a pile of toast, some jam and a steaming cup of tea. Come on, now.”
« Well, my friends, I think you have a lot to tell each other and I have other matters to attend, so if you would excuse me? »
« And then - if I may ask you to wait a second, sir, I took some notes to be sure I didn’t forget anything, here it is - he asked about what the lady needed, he said ‘an alibi? A windscreen? A human canoe? Does she intend to use you to navigate on the Thames?’. It was so brutal, sir, so uncharacteristic from the good Doctor Watson, I thought you would want to know that. Mr. Holmes can be somewhat... rude? sometimes, but he surely did not deserve it. Not if he’s trying to help a woman who’s dear to his heart. »
Watson was soaked, but not because the icy rain of November was rolling down his neck. The Doctor was so astounded, he wouldn’t be able to explain how he ended in the tub for dear life, but here he was, almost asleep in a tub full of warm water and lavender bath salts; the one he used when his leg were threatening to cramp. Holmes had even thought about it… His eyes closed, Watson let out a sight of contentment, delighting in how dizzy he felt. He would have really fall asleep in the water if Holmes hadn’t put the role of Mother Hen on tonight.
A little less than two months ago, John Watson and Sherlock Holmes had confessed their feelings to each other, with Mycroft Holmes’ providential help [2] (if Aziraphale were anything else than love, hope and good intentions, he would have been jealous of this accomplishment, but Aziraphale is an Angel and, therefore, can’t be jealous, isn’t it? At least, that’s what he’s trying to convince himself of). And February just had begun. Why is it important? Two reasons: first of all, the second month of the year is often the colder of all, as if the Winter had lazily done his job during December and January and then, seeing March was coming, decided to give everything he had before being replaced by “I’m-Almost-Everyone’s-Favorite-Season” Spring; the nasty show-off… To cut a long story short: when confronted to truly freezing temperatures, murderers, kidnappers, thieves and even dealers tended to stay home, as comfy and warm as possible. They were deceitful, not crazy, thank you very much; therefore, February had always been a month including less cases than the others (with August, the same thinking applies, only in the very opposite direction). No case = nothing special to focus on. Add to that a blooming, passionate relationship in its early stage, when one would do anything to please one’s partner, and you have the perfect combination of facts to obtain a False Good Idea (tm). It is exactly what happened to Doctor Watson when, on Sunday February 7th, while reading the newspapers during his breakfast, he stumbled upon several advertisements concerning Valentine’s day.
1. A sanctoral is a book listing the liturgical days devoted to the celebration of the saints on dates fixed in the calendar.
“Watson, don’t make me come and get you. You’re reversing the roles, dear, I’m the one who must be compelled into the bathtub! Stop acting out of character, the water is cooling down.”
Watson wasn’t offended by Holmes’ words, he was right. The Detective might be a lunatic, Watson wasn’t a saint either. But, still, this display of kindness was doubtful.
My brother. In love with a lady. If I had not be sure I could trust Stanley with my life, I would have been certain I have been drugged and, therefore, was hallucinating.
Back during Antiquity - and a lovely evening at the baths - the Angel had talked to him about a Valentine guy who had fought war by love or something equally sappy. The thing was Crowley remembered very well how much Aziraphale had loved this man (an excellent reason for the Demon to despise him, already; but what wouldn’t he do for his Angel, I ask you?) and how hard he had hoped for the fellow to be canonised. After a quick check in a sanctoral [1] to be sure Aziraphale’s wish had been granted (Crowley would have made it happen, otherwise), the Demon got to work. Saint John has his fires, Saint Patrick his carousals and Saint James his shells; Saint Valentine would get something as well.
