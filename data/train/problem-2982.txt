“Thanks for understanding, Dean.” Sam replied, his voice a bit nervous. “I didn’t want to upset you.”
“Oh, really? I’ve wanted to visit Kansas. My aunt lives there, but she always visits us instead of us visiting her.”
There will probably be a long wait between this chapter and chapter 9, so please forgive me in advance
Cas heaved the five bags he was carrying and began to speedwalk towards the Impala. Dean dug the keys out of his pocket and unlocked the car, holding the door open for Cas. Cas ducked his head and began stuffing his bags into the car.
“Main rule of a party, Dean,” Charlie chastised, “Always be fashionably late. That's how you get people talking!”
Dean nodded and took a butterfinger from the bag, unwrapping the candy bar. As he bit into it, Charlie began typing eagerly on her phone, a smile on her face.
By lunch time, Dean was quite ready to eat and quite done with school for the day. His classes had all been quite long and he didn’t really have the motivation to do much that day.
“Oh- oh, yeah, sorry.” Sam replied, dragging himself out of his trance. He quickly realized how weird he must’ve looked- staring absentmindedly at a blank piece of notebook paper, dragging his pencil along lazily with no real direction or goal- and snapped his notebook closed, almost without thinking.
Dean's second class started at 1 and ended at 2:30, so he got off in time for his shift at McDonalds, which started at 3. He had to deal with a few rude customers, including a middle aged man who demanded to get a refund on his burger and a woman who had a mind blowingly difficult order, and wouldn't accept anything less than perfection.
Dean shrugged. “I figured I should pay attention, at least. I may not be super into finding them, but I guess I don’t want to be completely deaf to it either.”
"Whatcha making there?" Cas questioned, sticking his head out of the bathroom at the aroma of food cooking.
Sam was surprised when the clock hit 2:30 am and he had still managed to avoid getting drunk or getting puked on.
It was 11 am by the time any of the hungover Novak siblings woke up- and Balthazar was surprisingly the first to wake up. He was followed about twenty minutes later by a very sluggish and slightly irritable Cas, who was clutching his head and groaning from his hangover.
“I won't be able to buy much, but sure.” Dean murmured, making no effort to move off of the couch. Cas exhaled a little and held out his hand, and after a few blank seconds, Dean took it. Cas pulled Dean up and Dean stumbled for a brief second before standing steady.
“You didn't. I wasn't really asleep.” Cas replied, stretching a little. “But I am going to go to sleep, so goodnight.”
“Can't you two ever fucking knock?!?” Lucifer cried after getting startled from the suddenness of the door opening. He sighed and hung his head forward for a second. “I have a
“Keep an eye out for my soulmate for me!” Gabriel called, before driving back home. Cas gave a wave in reply before shuffling his backpack higher onto his back.
She smiled politely and tilted her head, letting her hair fall onto her shoulder. “It is. Crowley, dear, come inside.”
And thus, he was going all around the house, making sure everyone would be ready tomorrow. Thankfully, for the Novak’s sanity, there weren't many decorations to put up, given that the party was a simple “start of school” type party rather than having a concrete theme, like Halloween or New Years. Lucifer still found ways to drive them all crazy, though.
“What’s all this yelling?” Came a voice, and Balth, Cas and Anna turned their heads to see Gabriel coming down the stairs, yawning and rubbing his eyes.
“I still don't understand why you couldn’t come in with us.” Balthazar complained, setting two bags down in the backseat.
So far Dean had spent a little over $200, and most of it had been food; Cas usually bought food for the two of them, so Dean didn't have to pay for himself much.
As soon as the song started, Dean dug the keys into the ignition and rolled the car out of the driveway, before heading off towards the school. He and Sam had a small conversation during the ride- mainly just about small little things, like movies and pop culture. The ride didn’t seem to last long enough.
Gabriel just shrugged his shoulders and then crouched down, holding his arms out as Lucifer’s pitbull ran towards him and began licking Gabriel’s face.
“I think you mean gay to the point.” Charlie replied, pulling out a pin. She handed the pin to Dean, which had the rainbow flag with an equal sign on it. “Take it. I want you to have it. And if you struggle with your sexuality, tell me. I beat myself up over it for months when I was younger. I don’t want you going through that.”
“True that.” Came a voice suddenly, and Sam turned to see the dark haired girl that Jess often stuck with. As he locked eyes with her, something registered in her dark eyes, and she raised her brows. “Oh, you’re Sam, right? The name’s Ruby.”
Dean ordered a regular hamburger and a soda, and his food was out within minutes. He sat by a window, glancing out at the people walking past. Adults, children, a few teenagers with dyed hair; Dean saw a whole array of people pass by. Dean was taking in the time to look at the little details of the people that walked past, as he had never gotten that chance.
"It's nice to meet you too." Dean spoke, as she ran a hand through her hair. Anna gave him a sweet smile before turning to Cas.
The two of them continued talking for a bit, and soon got back into the Impala, and Dean drove to pick Charlie up. He became a slight bit anxious when he remembered that Charlie had never met Cas. Dean hoped she wouldn’t go overboard.
“Currently at eighty songs and approximately five hours.” Michael replied, showing the playlist off to Lucifer, who hummed approvingly.
Sam’s next class was Law Studies, and the teacher, a really tall man with dark hair and a british accent, stood in front of the class and announced the assigned seats.
“Uh, well, I know you said your roommate invited both of us to that party, but I got an invite from my friend to go trick or treating with him, and I-”
The playlist was finished early thanks to Michael, Samandriel, Gabriel and Castiel’s diligence (though Gabriel did admittedly goof off quite a bit) and contained one hundred and twenty songs- plenty enough for Lucifer, thank goodness- and would last the entire party and then some. All the snacks were out and ready, all the decorations in place and everyone ready to face the mob of people that were surely on their way.
“Looks like the trickster’s at it again.” She remarked as they saw a kid who had been doused in glitter. Sam turned his head.
“I’m Garth!” Said the second boy, standing up to hug Sam and Dean. They both attempted to protest, but got trapped anyways.
“Ms. Rankin’s class is in the 300 hall.” Explained the office lady. “And the math classes are all upstairs, furthest hall.”
“That’s a good idea.” Anna laughed, before finally bursting into laughter alongside most of the others. Even Crowley had started laughing, mainly because he loved whenever someone threw something at Lucifer. (He and Lucifer didn’t get along)
Dean picked up a leather jacket, another jacket and a shirt, and a pair of jeans. As he did so, Cas took a small step back, leaning against the wall.
“What got you in such a generous mood today?” Balthazar questioned, raising a brow skeptically. He glanced at Gabriel as they all got out of the car.
Once all the bags were safely tucked in the car, Dean began to drive. By then, the streets were a bit more empty, and the drive back to the dorms was peaceful.
I'm so sorry for such a long wait! I've been struggling with writers block, and I've also been trying to juggle writing around four-five stories at once (cuz I'm an idiot) but I'll hopefully get the next chapter out on time. I'm having a bit more ease writing chapter 7 though so it should be out on time.
Once the move-out was official, Dean took all of his things and placed them in the Impala, before he turned the key into the ignition and began to drive towards Bobby’s. He was to move into the college tomorrow, so he’d figure he’d spend the rest of the day planning what to bring and how to decorate his dorm room, and what to expect from a roommate.
Balthazar scanned an eye over his own schedule. “Spanish 2 is first for me. Ha! I got Mr. Harrison!”
“How immature, Luci.” Gabriel remarked, rolling his eyes. “Why’re you being so quiet up here anyways? We thought you’d be blasting rock music again.”
"That's nice, it's good you two get along." Benny commented, turning his head to face left. "My class is right here, so I'll see you at lunch, brother."
Dean glanced up at Bobby with an inch of nervousness. “I, uh, met my soulmate last night. While I was blackout drunk. And now I can see colors, but I don’t even remember meeting them.”
“Mornin’ Bobby.” Dean replied with a nod, taking his plate as he sat down. That was when Arizona emerged, wagging her tail happily. She was followed by Sam cooing at her, laughing as he ran his fingers through her fur. Dean couldn’t help but smile at the sight.
There were a few groans from some kids, but Sam just smiled as Charlie tapped both his and Dean’s shoulders.
"Yeah, I am. Charlie mentioned that you're in Mechanical Engineering. I would've gone with cars, but planes and flying fascinate me more than cars." Dorothy remarked, twirling a strand of her hair around her finger. She glanced at Benny, who was munching on a slab of steak. "What's your major?"
"Mm. You single?" She remarked, and before Dean could respond, she shook her hand. "I'm just kidding. It's nice to meet you."
While Cas changed, Dean changed into clothes from his drawer, then took the time to run his hands through his hair and fix it up a little. Cas emerged from the bathroom less than a minute later, dressed in his usual trench coat, suit, dress shirt and black pants. Dean gasped in awe a little, then turned his face to hide from Cas's sight.
"I'll introduce you to my friends, then. That way, you can have other people besides your brother to talk to." Cas spoke, unlocking his phone.
Sure enough, when both boys eventually returned, Becky’s screams could be heard all the way upstairs. The other kids just laughed or shook their heads, quietly thinking “that's what you get” before ultimately bursting into laughter.
The boy was just barely shorter than Dean, with dark, almost black hair and enchantingly beautiful blue eyes. His face was clean and pretty, and his hair was ruffled and unkempt.
By the time the clock struck 3, Dean was completely wasted and surprisingly still standing. And by some miraculous string of luck, he was right by Kevin at the time, who was very eager to leave.
“It's fine, we’ll be alright unpacking with you in here.” The boy remarked, shaking his hand. “I just have a few boxes.”
The paint was quick to dry, so they only had to wait maybe six minutes to do the next layer. As Sam painted the sunset with ease, Dean glanced at his painting in awe.
“Well, we’ll find your soulmate, Cas.” Anna murmured. “And I don’t judge you. We’ve all done stupid shit while drunk. At least you’re not as bad as Luci.”
Once Dean finished eating, he headed back to his dorm. His roommate was actually there, talking on the phone with someone.
The three of them all happened to have lunch after art class, but Charlie took a different route than the two brothers, so they didn’t realize it at first. By the time they got to the cafeteria, it was halfway full, with kids pouring in. Sam immediately pointed out a table near the entrance, an empty table, so he and Dean quickly took it and sat down. They both unpacked the lunches Bobby had fixed for them- spaghetti in a thermos, some yogurt and a brownie- and dug in.
"Oh, did I fall asleep on the couch?" Cas groaned, yawning as he woke up. "I'm sorry, I apologize for that."
The house also happened to be in a relatively large neighborhood, meaning both boys would have the opportunity of many potential new friends- and a park, which they had seen when they were driving to the house. Granted, the park was small and only had a few trees and a playground, but they were excited all the same.
By the time Dean was done eating, his phone lit up and started buzzing with a call, so Dean excused himself and held the phone up to his ear.
Not long after Charlie sat down, the professor stood up and started the daily lecture. Dean put his chin in his hand and twirled his pen around in his hand. Charlie began to doodle swirls on her paper with a red fine tip pen, a small smile on her face. Dean was happy to see her smile. It had been a few days.
Dean spluttered, caught off guard by the sudden and all-too surprising question. He was about to answer when Anna gave him a knowing look, and he sighed, defeated.
"We just started dating two days ago." Dorothy remarked, smiling. "I just transferred here two weeks ago. I don't really know anybody, so Charlie took me in."
Dean walked into the bathroom and turned on the water, and walked out to his bed to get some clothes. As he did, he saw Cas begin to stir, but Dean got into the shower before he could see Cas fully wake up.
“Come in.” He called, running a hand through his hair. The door swung open to reveal, to no surprise, Sam. He stood there, wide-eyed, a smile on his face. “Now why are you so happy, Sammy? It’s a monday.”
“Well I am,” Jo interrupted, craning her head over the seat, “Please tell me you have Imagine Dragons in your playlist.”
That was the moment that Bobby chose to walk out of the kitchen, rubbing his hands with a towel. “What’s this I hear about a soulmate, Dean?”
Dean immediately began to regret his life decisions when he woke up yet again to a blaring alarm at 7 in the morning. His first class was at 8:30 that morning, and he wished he could've just set his alarm for 8 rather than 7. Then again, Dean wasn't the quickest in the morning. He'd take a shower, change, and get breakfast, and that all took an hour to do. He'd then give himself half an hour to wake up and walk to his class, which was half a mile away from the dorm.
“It’s nice to meet you Lucifer.” Dean spoke, and glanced at the man at Lucifer’s side. He was a bit shorter than both Lucifer and Dean, with dark hair and a face similar to John Winchester’s face. It made Dean shiver a bit. He hadn’t seen his father in months, but he could still remember his dad’s face clear as day.
The main office was fairly easy to find, and the halls weren't too crowded, with only a few college kids finding their dorms. Dean walked into the main office and walked to a woman sitting at a computer.
“Now, there’s one rule y’all should know about being in my car.” Dean announced, clicking away at his phone as he chose a playlist. “Sammy knows this well. Driver picks the music-“
With that, the five of them walked outside to the Impala, which they had all agreed to take to the party. (“I’d take my mom’s car,” Charlie had offered, “But she’d kill me if I did.”)
When Cas finished with his shower, Dean informed him that they’d be picking up Dean’s friend Charlie instead of Dean’s brother, to which Cas replied “Okay, that’s fine” and continued getting ready. Dean then took to scrolling through apps on his phone, trying to find something to do.
“It’s only been one day, Gabe. You’ll find them.” Samandriel remarked softly, pulling out his phone.
As he walked back into the dorm, he momentarily wondered where Cas was, before remembering the text he had received from Cas just an hour earlier. For some strange reason, Dean actually missed Cas. Dean assumed it was because Cas was his friend, but since he had never had a proper friend before, he couldn't be sure.
So back when I was originally writing this chapter, I didn't mean to make Dean fall this quickly, it just kinda happened. But this fic is a slow burn romance for a reason, and you'll see why.
Dean and Sam have a rough start to their days. Sam accidentally lets slip his ability to see colors, and Dean runs into Cas at the library.
“I’ll make this easy on you, Dean.” She remarked, pulling out her phone, “I won’t tell anyone what we’re doing, nor will I say anything to anyone unless you give me your permission. I don’t want you to be too uncomfortable.”
“Alright. I’ll see Cas in 6th lunch. And you two,” Gabriel turned to face Samandriel and Balthazar, “I’ll meet you two back at my car after school. Alright, let's have a halfway decent first day.”
Dean nearly burst into tears hearing that. After years of abuse from his dad, and years of going hungry, he had gotten used to the ache he felt whenever he didn't eat; he had gotten used to the feeling that no adult would care for him. Instead, determined to not cry, Dean bit his lip and nodded. “Thank you Bobby.” He whispered, his voice shaky. Bobby shook his head and placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder.
The three of them reached Charlie’s house rather quick, as she lived a mere six minutes away from them. Charlie lived in a rather pretty, quaint little house- it was a single story house in a roundabout, with a pretty driveway and flowers alongside the walkway- ones Bobby guessed were some type of rose. A dark-colored sedan sat in the driveway, one they guessed belonged to her parents.
Cas soon snapped out of his trance, and instead turned to face Dean. “I’m guessing you’ve never been to a Menchies before.”
“Come on Dean, it’s time to go.” Kevin grumbled, grabbing Dean’s arm. Dean initially protested, but went willingly after Kevin promised him lots of food at home.
“If you're also in this room, then yes.” The boy replied, his voice slightly deeper than what Dean was expecting. A boy suddenly walked in behind the dark haired boy.
Dean heaved his bag over his shoulder, and opened the door. He turned, glanced briefly at Sam’s room, then locked the front door behind him.
Jack nodded in understanding, so Cas grabbed some clothes from his closet for himself and left his door open just a crack.
One annoying thing that Cas had grown to deal with was the noise level that always accompanied Lucifer’s big parties. That, and crowds of drunk people and the ever-present pressure to get drunk and let loose.
“Alright, well, I’m up.” Gabriel groaned, rubbing his face into his pillow. He then shifted onto his side as Balthazar and Claire finally left his room.
“Better than I was expecting.” Dean murmured, munching on his donut. He moved a little more towards the box, letting his eyes scan over the selection of donuts. “I’m dying, of course, but my professors aren't giving nearly as much review as I was expecting.”
"Sweet! I love burgers." Dean remarked, sitting down at the table. Cas placed a glass of water down next to Dean before he sat down in his own seat. Dean took a large bite out of his burger, and continued to munch hungrily. Cas, however, ate slowly, taking time to sneak in small conversation with Dean.
a lil bit of a shorter chapter but it's not meant to have much happen. anyways, surprise! i know last time it took me two months to update, so have a lil gift! i don't know when the next chapter will be up, but i'm hoping by the end of the year. regardless, enjoy!
She let out a small squeal before calming down. “So, freakishly tall guy with brown hair. That’s definitely a start. Cas, what about you? Do you remember anything?”
It was not even half an hour after Dean left when Cas heard the familiar roar of his brother’s van become louder outside his dorm room. Cas smiled and grabbed his trench coat, tugging it on before he ran outside to greet his brother.
He had, in addition, donned a plaid jacket and a regular black shirt, and a pair of his favorite jeans. They were very worn and ripped with plenty of holes, but they were comfortable, so Dean loved them just the same.
“Alright, well, we have to go together, since today's both of our birthdays, so I’ll wait outside.” Balthazar remarked, holding the door open as Claire and Hannah walked out. Once they both left, Balthazar walked out into the hall and closed the door behind him.
“Bye, Dean.” Cas said with a wave, standing up to give Dean a proper goodbye. Dean waved in return before walking out and closing the door. Gabriel waited for a moment, observing Cas’s behavior as Cas continued to wave a little even after the door was closed.
The door swung open before Dean even reached it, and Charlie stood there, a smile on her face, her arms out. “Dean! Sam! I’m glad you could come over!” Her smile spread as she turned her head and waved her arms to someone inside. “Mom, they're here!” She turned back. “A few of my friends are here already. I assume your dad will wanna meet my mom.”
“You really didn't need to pay for it.” Dean spoke as they walked out of the store. “I could've covered it.”
When he reached his geometry class, it was mostly empty, given how early he was. The teacher, a somewhat tall man with dark hair, placed a calculator at Sam’s desk, before placing a calculator at every other desk in the room.
“You two sure know how to decorate.” Dean remarked as he walked into the dorm room. Cas turned around, briefly startled by Dean’s sudden reappearance.
"Hey Dean!" She waved her hand, and when Dean sat down, she turned to quickly face the girl sitting next to her.
“I know you’re probably a couple million years old by now and that your own age doesn’t really matter to you, but we figured you were owed a celebration.” Dean explained awkwardly as Cas drank everything in. He stared up at the freckled man, his own deep blue eyes locking with the vibrant green of Dean’s.
Cas soon found himself down in the basement, where there was a second array of snacks and a horror movie playing on the TV. There was a group of kids dancing drunkenly to the song that was playing on the first floor, including a tall boy with light hair and an attractive face. As Cas approached the group, the boy handed him a red cup and laughed drunkenly.
"Oh, did my alarm wake you?" Cas questioned, looking over at Dean, who was shuffling around under his covers.
Jo nodded as Sam pulled off the grass and rolled the Impala down the street. As he got going, he didn’t even glance back at the house where his soulmate stayed. He’d think about it more in the morning. For now, he just wanted to get home and sleep.
It quickly made sense to them why there were so many cars- the house was full of people, all talking and laughing and dancing at a volume level that surely would call for a noise complaint in an instant. It was a surprise the police hadn’t been called yet.
"My brothers have too much energy. I always get tired after visiting them, because they wind me up so much." Cas explained, leaning his head back.
Dean shook his head, his attention still primarily focused on the fish. "I've never been to one. Never had enough time as a kid."
They quickly reached the aquarium, and Dean pulled into a decent parking spot. The two walked to the front of the building, where a young woman with red hair stood waiting.
The class went by rather quickly. The professor had dived right into the hard stuff, which Dean hadn't been expecting. Then again, this was college. It was bound to be different from middle and high school.
Dean was in front of the tank in an instant. The tank was full of some saltwater fish, nothing too intriguing, but Dean seemed enamored enough by it. Cas smiled; Dean seemed so awestruck and amazed by something so simple as a saltwater fishtank. It was.... almost amusing.
As he descended the stairs, he got a view of the downstairs area. Arizona was napping lazily on the floor by the stairs, but jumped up when she heard footsteps and yelped at Sam. Sam’s eyes widened and he laughed as his feet made contact with the floor. He then ran up to Arizona and ran his fingers through her fur as she yelped happily and nipped at his fingers playfully.
Dean got back to the dorms at 5 that afternoon, and the dorm was empty. He set his bag down on the floor, then walked to the bathroom and turned on the water of the shower. Dean then undressed and stepped into the warm water, sighing as it hit his back. He had always loved a warm shower. He stood in the shower for a solid five minutes, doing nothing but enjoying the warm water against his skin. After five minutes, he began washing his hair and body.
Sure enough, the boy managed to help Dean. Chemistry might not have been one of Dean’s worst subjects, but Cas seemed to know way more than Dean could have ever dreamed. By the time Dean had completed his worksheet, the boy was already helping him with another paper, explaining things to Dean that he had never understood before. Dean was blown away by the boy’s knowledge;
“There's a kid here named Lucifer?” Sam asked incredulously, his eyes tinted with what seemed to be shock.
Gradually, Cas introduced each of his siblings and his siblings friends to Dean. By the time Dean got all of their names, a knock came at the door and Gabriel walked in.
Balthazar just shrugged, taking another box of Chips Ahoy. His eyes glanced over a few other boxes before he snuck a box of Pocky off the shelf.
The two brothers finished off a total of six plates of waffles each (Dean taking four and Sam taking two) before it was finally time for them to head out. They both grabbed their backpacks, bid farewell to Bobby, walked out the door and hopped into the Impala.
“I agree with Sam. He’s better at art in general than I am.” Dean supplied, shrugging. “And I think the midday sun should be easiest. Best to give it to me, the least artistically talented one of us three.” Charlie glanced at Dean as well, but she just shrugged and nodded.
By 7:50, all the siblings were finally dressed, fed and ready to go. Gabriel ushered Cas, Balthazar and Samandriel into his car, and they all piled their stuff in before climbing into their respective seats- Cas took shotgun while Balthazar and Samandriel sat in the back. Once the doors were closed, he turned on his playlist and drove the three of them to school, dropping them off.
"Oh. I can understand that, I have a younger brother as well. Not Gabriel, Gabriel's my older brother. I do have a younger brother who is in high school, though. Just started this year, same as your brother." Cas spoke. "His name's
Realizing he didn't know what section was what, Dean turned his head and walked to the nearest employee. “Excuse me, where's the law section?”
A few minutes passed before the four of them finally got suspicious and/or impatient. “Okay, what’s taking Charlie so long?” Jo huffed, glancing at the line. She saw Charlie, but not in the line- she was talking to some girl right outside of the lunch line, a tray of food in her hand.
“Think so.” Sam replied, taking the plate in his hands. Plate in hand, he walked to the dining area, which was on the other side of the foyer. He placed his plate down in the middle of the table and then made his way back to the kitchen to grab some silverware, Arizona following him all the way. Bobby was still there, fiddling with the pancake maker. Sam grabbed some silverware from the drawers and glanced at Bobby. “I went in his room to try and wake him up a few minutes ago. I think he got up to get dressed by the time I walked out.”
"Ah well, no more moving around for you two." Bobby remarked. "Now you got a new, permanent school."
Sam turned and saw Jess, the girl who had very kindly helped him with his homework a week prior. She gave a smile and tucked a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear.
“What did his soulmate look like again?” Samandriel inquired, a confused expression on his face as he glanced at his brothers.
He walked with Dean and Charlie to lunch from their shared art class. As soon as they did reach the cafeteria, however, Charlie ran off to the lunch line, leaving the brothers to sit at their table alone.
Sam’s eyes flitted back to Dean before he shook his head with a small laugh. “Dean, I’ve been telling you that you need to get a calendar. It’s friday.” Sam walked over and tapped on his phone, showing Dean the date- Friday, the 15th.
Dean nodded and waved goodbye to Benny, who walked off in the direction of his classes. Dean pulled out his phone, checking to make sure he wasn't late, then ran to his class. He got there just minutes shy of the class starting, and scrambled to find a good seat.
“Good, good.” Chuck then turned to face Amara’s wife, who stood politely behind Amara. When Chuck held his hand out, she took it graciously.
The girl gave a small skeptical glance, but didn’t question him. Instead, she simply nodded in understanding before returning to her work.
Sam laughed and ran towards the front door, Dean close in tow. Sam, of course, reached the front door first, and with the key Bobby had given him earlier, he quickly unlocked the front door and ran inside.
“I already told you: I drive you two here, you two shop. That was the deal.” Gabriel shot back, turning his eyes back to his phone. He was scrolling through his twitter absentmindedly, not paying much attention to the twins as they loaded the bags into the back seat. As soon as all the bags were loaded and the cart put back, Gabriel put his phone down and turned the car on. He clicked the screen of his phone for a few seconds, turning his music playlist on, and smiled when the first song to play was High by Sir Sly. He sang along as he pulled out of the walmart parking lot and began to drive, and even Balthazar nodded his head along to the song.
Dean sought for a plaid shirt in JC Penny’s, taking to the men's section. Sam loved red, so Dean grabbed a red and black plaid shirt and took it to the cash register. The woman working there lifted her head and almost immediately smiled, as though it was rehearsed. She held her hand out and took the plaid shirt, placing it onto the table. She scanned it and lifted her head up once more.
“Alright. You ready for your first day of high school?” Questioned Dean, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel. Sam nodded eagerly, sitting up a little straighter as he stared at the house through the windshield.
The full party was mainly taking place in the dining room, pool deck, basement and attic, so there was little reason for anyone to be in the foyer- except for the boy that had let them in, who seemed oddly entertained despite doing nothing but standing and waiting for more people to arrive.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Said the boy with a thick Louisiana accent. He held out his hand and Dean graciously took it. “You two new? I don't think I’ve seen you two ‘round here.”
“Luci’s just being really loud.” Jack confessed, walking into Cas’s room. Cas pushed the door closed behind Jack. “And I feel sick. And my head hurts.”
By the time his shift ended at 9, Dean was just about fed up with people. He turned the keys into the ignition, revved up his car and drove back to his dorm. Cas was there, and true to his promise, had dinner ready by the time Dean walked in the door. He had prepared two hamburgers, which was one of the few things Cas even knew how to make.
The door was almost instantly swung open by a tall, lanky boy with light hair and a v-neck shirt. “Ah! More guests! Welcome, welcome,” The boy cried joyously in a british accent, “Enjoy the party! And watch the punch, it’s already been spiked.”
About five minutes before the bell rang, a girl with light-colored hair approached Sam. When he glanced up to look at her, she smiled pleasantly and held out her hand.
To Cas’s surprise, it was already 11 am by the time he had been dragged downstairs. So, while the cake and cards were for later, Becky did have a birthday breakfast and Cas and Balthazar’s favorites- delicious buttermilk waffles and maple syrup with cinnamon rolls for Cas, and lemon scones with a small bit of strawberry shortcake on the side for Balthazar. All the dishes had been expertly made by Becky, who was actually a pretty good cook and always made birthday breakfast meals everytime there was a birthday.
Once lunch was over, Sam was grateful that he only had two classes left in the day. He was oddly tired today, but he shrugged it off as being just not getting enough sleep.
“I’m very particular.” Cas explained, looking at one of the posters. “Everything has to be just so. That's why my stuff is always neat.”
Charlie seemed to notice the expression on Dean’s face, and she tilted her head, a confused expression of her own crossing her face. “Dean? Are you okay?”
Within minutes, Gabriel was awake and dressed. He put on the one shirt he always wore on his birthday- a light blue graphic tee of a llama wearing a party hat with the words ‘Happy Birthday’ in black lettering. After patting his hair down he headed downstairs, where sure enough, Becky had made his favorite breakfast for him. As soon as he stepped foot in the dining area, Becky whirled around and smiled at him.
Dean pursed his lips and fiddled with his phone, searching for a song to play on the ride to school. “They always seem to last longer than I want them to, though.” His fingers finally landed on a tasteful song- Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin- and he placed his phone in the cup holder as the music began to play.
Cas set his bag down on the table and sat on the couch next to Dean, yawning as Dean used the remote to flip through the channels.
The teacher handed each of them a 8.5 by 11 inch canvas, and each student quickly put it on their easels. Charlie was the first of the three of them to paint, as she dipped her brush into the green and began painting the landscape. Sam dipped his brush into the green as well and started painting a landscape, while Dean just dipped his into the yellow and started to paint a sun.
“A tall guy with brown hair.” Cas replied, checking the time on his phone. “I’m gonna head to my first period.”
Lucifer’s party happens. Dean meets Cas, and Sam meets Gabriel. And of course, sparks and colors fly.
Cas shrugged his shoulders, picking up his bag before turning to face Dean. "Well, everyone in my family was surprised when he became a business major."
Balthazar groaned but heaved Cas, who was passed out on the couch, and carried him to his room. Hannah, meanwhile, took care of Anna and Anael, while Michael took care of Lucifer and Samandriel carried Gabriel. As soon as the drunks were all put to bed, Michael sighed and turned to the other 3, who were all standing next to the railing of the stairs.
Cas nodded, and a faint smile curved onto his lips at the immediate acceptance and lack of judgement.
Perhaps he shouldn’t have allowed his first kiss to be when he was very drunk and definitely wouldn’t remember it, but he had long thrown rational thought out of the window, and so he moved his lips in sync with the boy and closed his eyes.
“Three, but all of them have been seeing colors for at least two weeks.” She tilted her head, narrowing her eyes at Dean. “Are you actually interested?”
The day passed pleasantly. After cake, Cas had opened an orchestra of cards, most with simple messages written in them. Dean had then insisted on putting on a movie, proclaiming they could ignore the world for a day to celebrate Castiel.
"Uh, sure. I'm always in the mood for free food." Dean replied with a shrug, making his way to the bathroom to change. Cas stepped out of the way to let Dean past, and nodded in response.
Dean woke up at 4 that afternoon, his dorm room still empty. His phone had died and his music had ceased, so he plugged his phone in to charge, and then pulled his homework out. His homework took him an entire hour to do, during which not even a knock came on the door of the dorm. Dean finished his homework at a quarter past five, when his phone began to rang. He checked his phone, smiled when he saw his brother's name as the caller ID, and picked up.
After driving around for a good fifteen minutes, Bobby eventually settled on taking both boys to get some lunch at a local Applebee's, a restaurant both Sam and Dean had always wanted to go to but had never gotten the chance- until now. And as soon as Bobby parked the car, both boys tore open the car doors and ran off towards the restaurant.
“Oh I don’t. I just listen to nightcore every now and then, and you can find a lot of her songs nightcored. They're all pretty good dance-y songs.”
When Dean finally parked the car, they were stopped outside a large mall. Charlie raised her eyebrow in curiosity, but Dean grabbed her by the hand and dragged her into the mall. The first stop was a salon, where he took Charlie and told her she could get her hair cut however she wanted it. Her hair had grown a bit, so she opted for a shorter style. Dean also paid for her to get a full mani-pedi (albeit she did opt out of getting her nails actually painted and chose to just get them cleaned up) and he sat and waited for Charlie to be done.
Gabriel was the next person downstairs. His hair was a mess and his eyes were tired, and on his face rested an irritated expression, clearly from Lucifer banging his fists against Gabriel’s door. Apparently Gabriel had gotten up after Lucifer threatened to replace all his candy with fruit.
Dean finished his poptart and hastily grabbed his bag, swung it over his shoulder, grabbed his water bottle and walked out of the dorm room and to his first class. His classes ended at 4 that day, and once they were over, he got a bite to eat at the local IHop. He once again wolfed his food down in record time, and gulped his drink down. His phone buzzed as he finished his food, and he glanced at it to see a text from Cas.
Dean groaned, grabbing the bag of school supplies he had prepared. "Yeah, that's the shitty thing." Dean sighed, and suddenly turned to face Cas. "What's your brother Gabriel majoring in?"
Cas nodded and put his phone down, flopping down onto his bed. "It's already eight o'clock." He remarked, glancing at the clock on the bed stand. "Have you had dinner?" When Dean nodded, Cas sighed and laid his head back. "I'll order pizza for myself, then."
Cas tilted his head. "My brother? He's majoring in business. He wants to own a candy shop someday." Cas glanced in the direction his brother had taken off in, and smiled. "My entire family thought he was crazy to pursue business. They said he should go for drama, or something like that. No one expected him to do so well as a business major, you see. But he's proving our family wrong. He loves it, though. He rubs it in everyone's faces at holidays, like 'look at me, I'm gonna graduate with a business degree'. It annoys most of our family."
Rowena’s son grumbled slightly but followed her inside, signaling for his son to follow him, and Chuck closed the door behind them.
Cas sighed softly. “Well if you're sick, I’d rather you not get germs all over my room, okay? Maybe another time.”
The clock soon struck 7:40 and so chaos descended on those who were not yet fully ready to go to school. Gabriel stood by the door, a smug grin on his face as he gleefully watched the chaos unfold.
Dean blushed and mumbled "thank you" before he finished his own omelette, placing his plate in the sink.
Sure enough, Bobby had made the boys waffles, a surprisingly large mound of waffles that Dean wasn’t sure he could even finish. Then again, ever since they had come into Bobby’s care, they had never ended a single day without a full and happy belly.
“Hey, Cas. Didn't mean to wake you.” Dean murmured, shuffling through the bag of stuff he had gotten from Hot Topic.
"Mhm." She murmured, brushing a bit of her hair off her shoulder. "Well, my brother is a bit too oblivious with feelings, so good luck. But if you hurt him, I'll end you."
“One party down.” Michael sighed as soon as the final person left the house, closing the door behind them. “Only three more to go. Yippee.” He turned to face the house, which was positively trashed. So far, the only siblings that were actually sober and/or still standing were Samandriel, Balthazar and Hannah.
Cas woke to the smell of delicious food. When he rose out of bed, Dean cocked his head and smiled. “I was wondering when you’d wake back up.” Dean murmured, standing next to the oven. Cas smiled as well, a sort of adoration filling his eyes as he stared at Dean. He even felt his heart flutter as Dean gave him a smile. Cas didn't know why, but as Dean called him over to eat, Cas shrugged it off.
The sudden ringing of the alarm clock was a harsh break to the comforting silence of the early morning- and to Dean’s dream, which was actually a good one for once, rather than a nightmare. He groaned and rubbed his eyes, doing a small double-take at the exploding colors in his sight before remembering the prior two days.
“So, spot anyone who looks like they could be my soulmate?” Gabriel questioned as Cas, Balthazar and Samandriel loaded into his car.
“Alright! Let them have cake!” Dean cried, taking the knife to slice through the cake. He handed a generous slice to Cas, who took it without question, not even considering his lack of ability to taste anything. Cas took a fork and brought it to his mouth, taking slices of the cake without thought.
Charlie just nodded her head, seemingly unfazed. “Yep. He’s the oldest of the Novak siblings. Rumor is he got held back, but of course that's a confirmed rumor since he’s still here. He should have graduated in May.” She tossed a french fry into her mouth before continuing. “He’s the older brother of The Trickster, Gabriel Novak.”
Cas set his own fork down for a brief moment. “I’ll go with Gabriel as well. He has Imagine Dragons in his playlist.”
Sam took a brief moment to ponder the question, sincerely considering his options. Eventually, against his better judgement, he found himself nodding.
Bobby grabbed Dean’s empty glass of water as soon as he was done with it, but not before he turned to Dean. “Hey, Dean, don't forget that you have a therapy appointment after school.”
Dean chuckled. "Well your brothers sound fun." Dean turned his focus back to the TV, trying to find a channel to watch.
Cas tossed a bottle of water to Dean, and Dean caught it. "Take that, and drink it. You need to drink something other than soda."
“Yeah. She keeps sending me memes of cats.” Charlie tilted her head, letting some of her hair fall onto her shoulder before she glanced at Dean’s face. “You’ve been smiling at your own phone a lot, ya know. Are you perhaps dating someone and decided to not tell me?” When Dean shook his head, her eyes narrowed. “Well, you must be in love then. Who is it?”
“Yes, I suppose you could, but I’ve seen that look before. That’s love, bitch. Now who is it?” Dean sighed, and Charlie grabbed his hand. “Look, I’d say I won’t pressure you to tell me but unfortunately I’d probably be lying. I can say, though, that I won’t joke around about it nor will I constantly bring it up if you don’t want me to.” Charlie pulled her shoulder up and laid her head on it. “Alright?”
“Gabriel just texted me.” Someone said from across the room. “He said he’ll be here in five minutes.”
Kevin had gone back to his house after the party, and Meg had left just shortly after Charlie had woken up. Benny, meanwhile, ended up just going back to his house, and Jo had to leave shortly after Charlie woke up. And so, the only one left was Charlie, sitting in the living room, happily talking to Sam. Once the sound of Dean’s footsteps were heard, the two of them looked up, followed by Sam immediately lifting himself off his seat.
“I don’t really remember anything about the guy,” Balthazar started, wrapping his arms tighter around his brother, “Other than his hair looked to be a medium-ish color, and he was tall.”
When Cas walked in, the attention of one of the people inside was caught, and they yelled Cas’s name. That caught the attention of everyone else in the house (which came to a grand total of seven people) and soon Cas was surrounded by people who were hugging him.
“Happy birthday Cas!” Cried the cascade of voices, and it took a few moments before Cas recognized the voices to be belonging to all those who had taken residence in the bunker. There stood Dean, Sam, Eileen and Jack, all smiling as they stood in a kitchen that Cas suddenly realized was decorated.
Lunch didn’t seem to arrive soon enough. By the time it did arrive, Sam was grateful to finally have a break from the onslaught of school work. His Geometry teacher had sprung a test on them, his law studies and french teacher had both given them projects, and he had spent his culinary class making sure that Gabriel wasn’t there.
“I’m glad you like it.” Cas remarked, glancing at Dean. “My mom used to take my siblings and I here every other Sunday after we moved here.” His eyes glanced off in the distance, far past Dean, and Dean saw a fond glow in Cas’s beautiful blue eyes. His eyes were a unique blue, quite similar to the typical gray-blue color and yet a bit unique. Perhaps it was just because Dean paid so much attention to Cas’s eyes. He didn’t particularly care which.
Cas woke up the morning of the first day of school to a face full of fur. Spluttering, he almost immediately sat up, scaring his cat right off of his chest and sending her bounding across the room.
After finally finding a place to park, Dean and Cas made their way to the mall entrance. They had parked near the JC Penny’s, per Cas’s request. Cas had said that JC Penny was the first stop on his list. When they walked into the store, however, Cas paused and stopped Dean.
“Is the yelling upsetting you?” Cas asked, kneeling down to face Jack. Jack lowered his eyes and nodded, placing his kitten Marble on the floor. Marble gave a soft meow and walked right up to Nox and rubbed her body against her, as Nox ruffled her fur and laid down. Gemini gave an indignant meow from her spot on the top of the cat tower.
“Good morning boy. You going off to your dorm to move in?” Bobby asked. Dean nodded, and Bobby smiled. “Alright. Take your car, drive careful. Text me when you’re done so I know everything’s good.”
Dean was silent for a moment, before he nodded. Charlie pulled out her phone, and as Dean rolled the car down the street, Charlie began typing away.
“Sam, it’s Saturday.” Dean whined angrily, digging his face into his pillow. Sam tapped on the wall next to Dean’s door, taking a moment to admire Dean’s small assortment of posters. As he did so, Dean tugged his blanket back over himself and glanced at Sam. “Why are you waking me up so early on a Saturday?”
Dean almost instantly sprung up at the sound of french toast and pizza, causing Sam to whip his hand over his mouth to stop himself from laughing. Dean caught the small burst of contained laughter and fixed himself, hiding his excitement before yawning and patting his hair down.
The two boys then took to walking around the house, exploring the three bedrooms, three bathrooms, kitchen, two living rooms, the backyard, pool, and many other areas. The house wasn't particularly large, but it was a relatively new, modern house- having been built in 1986- and it was larger than their old house, so both brothers were perfectly happy with it. Plus, the backyard was actually pretty large, with a wrap-around fence and an open grassy area that led out to a very pretty lake.
Dean shook his head, setting a plate down on the table. "I was lucky just go get a costume. My family, we didn't celebrate Halloween much. We'd go trick or treating every couple of years, which I always enjoyed."
“Nah, just a lazy morning. Most of them got hungover last night, and they’re all still sleeping.” She turned on the basement light and shook her head. “Lazy fucks.” She then stood and pointed to a phone laying on the couch, black case and a surprisingly uncracked screen. Dean walked over and turned it on, but shook his head.
Just then, footsteps were heard, and the two turned to see Dean walk off the stairs and towards the kitchen. As soon as he stepped off the stairs, Arizona yelped and ran over to Dean, who gave a small smile and ran a hand through her fur.
The second boy was shorter, with golden hair and eyes, and a cheery smile on his face. “I’m just here to help this guy move in.” The second boy explained, still smiling.
Dean and Charlie followed Cas and Becky into the large house, where they were immediately met with a wave of Halloween decorations and music. Bats, ghosts and spiders littered the walls, stair banisters and counters. There was a pumpkin on every counter, and a few lights were strung up.
“Yeah, yeah, I know. It’d be nice if we didn’t have to get all this shit every year, though. I always wonder how Lucifer pays for it.”
Cas tilted his head. "Well, you'll love this aquarium. I've been there, it's actually quite intriguing." Cas seemed to pause, and added an afterthought. "And my sister's nice. You'll like her, I'm sure."
Before either of them anticipated, Dean was pulling into the student parking lot. As he stuffed his phone back into his pocket, he turned the car off and followed Sam towards the school.
I realized as I was uploading this that they were supposed to pick Charlie up at a McDonalds and not her dorm, so oops
“Alright, good morning everyone. I’m Ms. Rankin, and I’ll be teaching you World History Honors. Since today is the first day, I’ll just read the class rules and hand out a get-to-know-me sheet.”
There were a few people still standing around Cas, but one of the people in the house, a timid-looking boy around Sam’s age walked over to Dean and said hello, introducing himself as Samandriel.
Dean groaned as he stretched, the relief of stretching his muscles rushing through him. He sighed and then yawned, before turning to face his closet full of clothes.
Dean chuckled softly at the sight before turning his attention back to the table of snacks. There was chips and dips, cookies, a half empty plate of pigs in a blanket, an almost entirely ignored bowl of fruit, bowls of trail mix, a plate full of pretzels and an almost empty plate of pizza rolls- a pretty impressive display, if Dean said so himself. Then again, he rarely ever attended high school parties, so perhaps it wasn’t all that impressive.
Sam sighed as he and Jo pushed drunk Dean and Charlie into the back seats. “Of course they got drunk.”
Jo shook her head and took a bite of her lunch. Benny took a glance as well, but he didn’t recognize the girl either.
“Big bro’s orders.” Balthazar sighed, grabbing a box of Chips Ahoy. “You know how batshit he gets over this party.”
The first sound that broke the silence of Saturday morning was groaning. Loud groaning. But with two horribly hungover people in the house, the sound wasn’t a surprise to any of those who were awake.
Claire was still sitting at the table, though now joined by Anna, Hannah and Hael, all of whom were engaged in conversation as they ate their waffles. Claire gave a high five to Cas when he walked past her, smiling brightly. Lucifer, meanwhile, was finishing up a worksheet at the table, one that he had forgotten to do and that had apparently been due on Friday. Raphael sat next to him, drinking from a mug and already completely ready for the day. He sat with a bored expression, using his free hand to scroll through his phone.
The girl smiled, waving her hand. “It’s fine. I know how guys can be with their food.” She let out a small laugh, tilting her head as her dark eyes studied Dean’s face. “Are you new? I don’t think I’ve seen you before.”
“You two must be Sam and Dean! The name’s Meg, it’s a pleasure.” She stepped forward and hugged both boys, pulling back with a smile on her face. “Charlie’s said quite a bit about you.”
“By a few, he means ten.” The second boy laughed. “My name’s Gabriel. Your new grumpy roommate is my little brother, Castiel.”
Dean nodded, and Bobby closed the door behind him, leaving Dean to get ready for the day, which he did. Dean pulled on the plaid shirt and put a jacket on over it- his hand-me-down leather jacket, in fact, which was one of the only positive memories he had of his father.
For Cas, he got a new computer and camera, some books and clothes, painting supplies and some new notebooks. Balthazar, meanwhile, got some new clothes, a camera, a cookbook, a DVD of songs by The Classic Crime, a Slytherin banner and a ‘my heart will go on’ DVD that he promptly chucked at Lucifer’s head.
When the alarm on his phone went off, it tore Dean out of his tender dream and into the harsh reality of morning. He fumbled for his phone, muttering to himself as his fingers finally clasped onto the small device and he frantically turned the wailing alarm off. With a huff, he rolled onto his back, stared at his ceiling and sighed.
And for some strange reason, that small little remark made Castiel smile. And it was that moment that Cas realized, he was falling in love.
“So, what class do you have first?” Inquired Dean, as the lady in the office handed both brothers their schedules.
One day, as Dean stepped out of the shower, he took the time to glance at the scars on his body. Most were barely visible, such as the tiny scratches left from broken beer bottles. There were a few light scars on his left wrist, easily covered by even the lightest makeup. Dean would never admit to using makeup, but he'd rather use makeup than explain any of his scars. He wasn't all that fond of reliving the pain of his youth.
By time that Cas descended the stairs, the yelling had stopped. When he got to the kitchen, he saw Gabriel sitting at the kitchen bar, a scowl on his face as he drank a mug of water and toyed with a fork. Lucifer stood a few feet away from him, arms crossed as he watched Gabriel accusingly. Apparently, Gabriel had been refusing to wake up and get ready, so Lucifer had apparently dragged Gabriel out of bed and was forcing him to have breakfast- an odd sight, but yet again, nothing Cas hadn't seen before. Lucifer dragging Gabriel downstairs to breakfast was, oddly, an all-too-common sight in the Novak household.
"I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Charlie." Dean mused, holding out his hand to shake Dorothy's. Dorothy smiled and shook his hand, her brown hair bouncing slightly.
And he wasn’t, for some unknown reason. Whatever it was, Sam was grateful that he didn’t have to worry about hiding his new found vision for colors.
"I have food." Cas murmured, holding up a bag of fast food. "I got you some breakfast from a restaurant on my way back home."
Dean and Charlie watched Sam paint for a few moments, entranced. Then, a light lit up in Charlie’s eyes, and she stared at Sam in shock.
“Gemini!” He cried out, eyes landing on the black and white ragamuffin cat that was now sitting next to his door, pawing at it helplessly. “How many times have I told you to not wake me up like that?”
“I’m not sure. I know there's at least eight, but I heard a ninth sibling started this year. I don’t pay a ton of attention to them.” She cocked her head again, her eyes glancing around the cafeteria. “I should pay more attention, though. They're an interesting family from what I’ve heard.”
Dean almost immediately regretted texting that to Charlie, but he figured she could help him figure out what to say and do there.
Sam sat silent, munching away at his food. He agreed with Dean, Charlie’s eyes were very pretty, but he stayed silent as he didn't yet want them to know that he could see colors. He had seen Charlie in action, and he wasn’t sure he could hide the identity of his soulmate for long- especially since he hadn’t been drunk and therefore had no excuse.
“My name’s Charlie, this is Sam and Dean.” Charlie replied. “We’re looking for Dean’s phone. He lost it last night.”
"Well, Bobby said your classes start at 8:30, and mine do too, so I woke up early so I could call you." Sam replied.
“So that's the guy you're in love with, hm?” Gabriel remarked before Cas could say anything. Cas whirled around in surprise and spluttered. “Hm. I don't think he deserves someone as great as you, but he's your crush.”
People slowly started trickling out of the building, as Kevin dragged Dean outside. Sam was already by the Impala, preoccupied with whatever was on his phone. Meg was also there, chatting happily with Benny. Meanwhile Jo was trying to get Charlie up, as Charlie laid on the ground, babbling and giggling drunkenly. As Kevin dragged Dean across the street, Sam lifted his head and smiled.
"A water." Cas droned, closing the door of the bathroom. Dean nodded and poured a glass of water, stuck three ice cubes in it and set it on the table, then went back to fixing his omelette. By the time he was done, Cas was out of the shower and dressed in his usual outfit. He took the glass of water and drank half of it, then began eating his omelette as soon as Dean placed it on the table in front of Cas. "Mm, this is delicious." Cas commented, shoving a forkful of the omelette into his mouth.
Sam managed to wake up early yet again. Or at least early compared to Dean’s standards, as Dean often told him whenever Sam went to wake him up- which by now, seemed to practically be Sam’s job. It was odd, Sam sometimes thought, for him, the younger brother, to be waking his older brother up every morning instead of the other way around. But when had their lives been anything but unorthodox?
By the time I upload this it'll be May 3rd but Happy Birthday to Sam Winchester! Have a new chapter in celebration!
When Dean got back to his room, Dean’s roommate, Castiel, and his brother Gabriel had completely transformed Castiel’s side of the room. Posters covered the wall, blankets and pillows were arranged on the bed just so, and a few items, keepsakes and photographs, littered the one shelf on Cas’s side of the room.
Dean was the last of the two that woke up- Charlie waking up about a half hour before him. Dean made his way downstairs into the kitchen, ignoring Arizona who was playfully barking at his side. Turns out he was the last person to even wake up,seeing as everyone else was already downstairs.
Dean continued eating, and he finished off his first donut with ease. Once done, he grabbed his backpack and heaved it onto his back. “I got an 8 am class, so I gotta run.”
“Not really. Well, I want to meet them on my own, not by tracking them down. I hate the idea of being controlled by my fate. If I find them, I want it to be on my own time, of my own will.”
His fourth period was Chemistry, which wasn’t all that entertaining. The teacher, Ms. MacLeod, spent the entire class talking about what they would do in Chemistry. Dean also happened to spot a kid in the back of the class who was wearing a trenchcoat, which he thought was an odd choice of clothing, but nothing else really happened. It was his fifth period that became entertaining- when he saw both his brother and Charlie in the class. Sam was sitting at a table towards the back, and Charlie was sitting at a different table- but she soon moved tables when she spotted Dean in the room.
When Michael returned with the list, Charlie thanked him and she walked with Sam and Dean to the kitchen. Inside the kitchen sat a small boy with light brown locks, next to a chattering girl with long red hair. As Charlie approached the two, the girl stopped and faced them.
As soon as Cas finished off his own plate of waffles, he discarded it in the sink, gave a pat to Hershey and went to put Gemini and Nox up. It was a bit of a struggle to get Gemini up, but Nox came willingly and perched herself on the top of the cat tower as Cas closed the door.
Dean stepped into the shower, sighing as the hot water poured onto his body. He loved the feel of a hot shower. He ran his hands through his hair, lathering it with soap and letting the water rinse it from his hair. After he washed his body and the soap was rinsed from his body, he stepped out into the cool, crisp air. It nipped at his skin, and he quickly wrapped himself in a towel to try and warm himself, protect his skin from the cold air.
“Dorothy?” Dean questioned, seeing the smile on Charlie’s face. Charlie laughed and tucked her phone away.
Cas waved goodbye and took off to his first class of the day, and Dean walked off to his first class of the day, Calculus. Not too long after he sat down, a redhead girl appeared next to him.
"My father wasn't big on breakfast either." Dean remarked, shuffling through a cabinet to find a breakfast item. He soon settled on a poptart, just like Cas, and wolfed it down.
Bobby paused for a moment in thought. “Well, I hope you find them boy. I know you aren’t a fan of the whole soulmate thing, but it is a truly wonderful thing to have one. Don’t waste it.”
Cas held back a small chuckle at that statement, choosing to finally stand up. “I’ll be downstairs in a minute.”
Cas shook his head. “I know that feeling.” Cas shifted a bit, then stood up and grabbed his phone. “The party starts at 8pm. When do you want to pick your brother up?”
Dean then made his way to the cash register, where an employee stood. They grabbed the book and scanned it diligently, not even looking up as they did so. When the scanner beeped, they looked up at the total, and then held out their hand. “21.30”
Unfortunately for them, the Novak family loved birthdays, and liked to make a big deal out of birthdays. And so, the Novaks gathered around and sang loudly as Cas and Balthazar stood very awkwardly, silently begging to be anywhere else. Lucifer and Gabriel especially got a kick out of it, being dramatic as all hell and ending the song with dramatic solos. Balthazar and Cas couldn't wait to repay the favor at Gabriel’s birthday party.
“I don’t see why we have to be twenty five minutes late.” Dean grumbled as he pulled at a stubborn strand of hair. “Why can't we just head over now?”
Cas shook his head as a small smile crept onto his lips. "Alright. I'll be back in half an hour." Dean smiled and nodded, and Cas stepped out the door.
Cas tilted his head a bit in confusion, but stopped when Charlie leapt forward and hugged him. Her short red hair (she had got it cut the weekend prior) bounced as she pulled back, a radiant smile on her face.
"Our older brother's boyfriend." Anna explained. "He had the same major as me, so I'll meet up with him occasionally and he'll help me with some of my assignments."
Dean stifled a laugh, quickly covering his mouth with his open hand. Cas just sighed in mild exasperation.
Once all his classes were finished, he collapsed in his dorm room. His roommate was not back yet, so Dean hooked his headphones into his phone, blasted his music through the headphones and danced for a bit, before he ultimately fell asleep, music still playing, but much softer.
Not one to be deterred, however, Sam held put his hand. Andy seemed a bit perplexed, but he took it nevertheless.
Bobby shook his hand. “Ah, don't thank me boy. Put that on and get ready so you aren't late for your first day. You still gotta get your schedule, don't forget.”
The calculators ended up being just so that the teacher could explain how they were used and what for.
Charlie was waiting for the both of them, sitting outside at a small table, tapping away at her phone. When she saw them, she stood and waved, a smile on her face. As soon as they got closer, though, she glanced at Dean and laughed.
“That’s good. I’m hoping to get him next year.” She tilted her head down and glanced at her worksheet, before her eyes fell onto Sam’s. “You finished yours?”
Dean handed them a twenty and two singles, to which the employee handed Dean a few coins of change. The employee dutifully wrapped the book in a bag, and handed it to Dean. When Dean began to walk away, the employee waved him off. Dean waved a little back as he made his way to the next store.
Sure enough, just as Balthazar had promised, there was indeed cookie cake on the kitchen island- it had a decoration of a bunch of balloons with some words that Cas couldn't yet fully discern written in icing.
Even so, there was much Cas didn’t understand, and much that still piqued his curiosity. It came to a head that morning, when he walked into the kitchen to an array of shouts and cheers.
Dean nodded and took the bag with his purchase in it, and he clutched the bag in his hand. He then made his way to the next stop, which was Books a Million. Dean figured he’d find a law book there. Where better to find a book than a bookstore, right?
A confused expression dawned on Sam’s face, so Jess tapped his shoulder and cupped her hand to his ear. “Sorry about that, Ruby’s just not very open to new people.” Jess whispered with an apologetic smile. Sam nodded in understanding, as Jess gave him another smile. She was an oddly cheerful person, but Sam didn’t mind.
“Amara, it's good to see you!” Chuck exclaimed, holding his arms out. Amara tilted her head and held her arms out as well, pulling her baby brother into her arms.
Dean's second class of the day was chemistry, and after that was lunch. Dean sat at a lone table during lunch, in the ginormous campus cafeteria. Many people sat outside, chattering amongst themselves. Dean saw no reason to go outside and sit in the hot sun, so he stayed inside in the air conditioning. Lunch lasted for an hour, and Dean finished his food rather quickly, so he just looked on his phone for most of the time.
Dean nodded, and went to the bathroom to take a shower. When he was done, he got dressed while Cas took a shower. By the time he finished getting dressed, his phone buzzed with a text from Charlie.
Dean laughed. “Well, you’re gonna have a hella hard time with me as a roommate. I can't clean or keep my stuff neat for shit.”
“I know a great frozen yogurt place near here, you wanna check it out?” Cas asked, and Dean’s head immediately jerked up. He nodded excitedly, and Cas smiled. “Alright.”
Cas soon found his mom, Becky, brushing her hair in the cabana bathroom next to her bedroom, so Cas knocked on the open door to signal his presence. When she turned her head and her eyes met his, he spoke. “Hey mom, Jack’s not feeling well, says he has a fever and his head hurts. He wants to stay home today.”
Of course, his luck streak couldn’t last, as he discovered when a very drunk boy with light colored hair bumped into him. The short boy looked up at Sam, and a drunken grin spread across his face.
so, in case y'all didn't know, i've hit a roadblock writing this story. idk when the next chapter will be out, but hopefully in the next seven weeks. i'll see y'all soon. thanks for being patient
"Alright. Bye bye Sammy, you have a good rest of your day now." Dean replied. Sam bid Dean goodbye and hung up, and Dean couldn't help but smile at the happiness he had heard in his brother's voice during the entire call. He had never heard his brother so happy.
“When have you ever said no to food?” Charlie spoke with a grin. Dean smiled and huffed a little, before he sat down in the Impala and stuck the keys into the ignition. He drove to the very same Five Guys he and Cas had visited just an hour prior, where Charlie got herself a burger and so did Dean. The three of them sat at a window table, talking and laughing. The next two hours passed by quickly.
Whenever they had asked him why he cooked so much, he’d smile and just say that it was something to remember his wife by.
Dean stood up suddenly, and began sifting through the small amount of clothes he had. "My brothers name is Sam."
“Are you gonna be okay?” Dean asked, tilting his head. Charlie barely lifted her head, before she tilted her head low and to the side and shrugged her shoulders. Dean placed a hand on her cheek and wiped some of her tears, then clasped both hands on the steering wheel. “C’mon. I got the perfect place to cheer you up.”
They thankfully weren’t alone for long, as Benny and Jo soon sat down at the table, both right before the bell rang. They both noticed Charlie’s absence from the table almost immediately.
The first thing he heard after opening his door was the sound of Lucifer yelling at Gabriel to get up. Given how common the sound was, Cas just shrugged it off and went downstairs, Nox and Gemini following closely behind. That was until two of the other cats of the house, Quinn and Coffee, came walking out towards Nox and Gemini, and the two cats paused to meow at them.
The party lasted a total of four hours, and ended at midnight. Dean had to practically drag Charlie to the car, as she was that tired. Cas managed to get into the car just fine, but he fell asleep during the car ride. After Dean dropped Charlie back off at her dorm, he drove back to his own dorms. He had to wake Cas up, but Cas fell asleep again almost as soon as his head hit his pillows. Dean snuggled up under his own blankets, and though he didn’t fall asleep instantly, it didn’t take him long to fall asleep.
“Rock haters.” Muttered Anael, poking Balthazar’s arm. He swatted at her hand and she laughed, pulling her hand away.
Dean shook his hand a bit tersely. This guy wasn’t Dean’s dad, but he sure looked similar to him, and that put Dean on edge. The man, however, thankfully didn’t seem to notice Dean’s tenseness. “It’s nice to meet you too, Michael.” Dean finally spoke, and Michael nodded.
Lucifer was leaning against his van, which was an extremely light shade of pink with random red paint splatters here and there. His boyfriend, Michael, stood next to the doors of the van, cocking his head as he saw Cas walk towards them.
And with that, Sam walked off to his first class, Dean close in tow. The two brothers split when Sam had to go upstairs, so Dean continued going forward until he reached the 300 hall.
This chapter is a bit shorter than I'd like, but it's midnight and I figured why not upload it today? Anyways, enjoy!
“Well, as long as you don’t play some heavy metal music I’m good.” Charlie said, shrugging. “I’m not too picky when it comes to music.”
It was tiny with bad plumbing and the constant smell of cats, but Dean managed to live there just fine. Any place with his brother but without his father was an amazing place indeed.
Gabriel lifted his head. “Your hair’s black. And your eyes are…” Gabriel suddenly swore to himself. “Shit! I can see colors too!”
As soon as they sat back in the Impala, however, Dean turned and looked at Charlie. “Now what are you going to do with the list, now that you have it?”
When Cas and Gabriel had returned, they set the bags of food down, left them to Balthazar, and took off to glance at the playlist so far and see if there was anything they could edit, add and/or remove.
"I'm majoring in Mechanical Engineering. My first class is Calculus, unfortunately." Dean replied. "I hate math, I suck at it."
Messy dark, almost solid black hair and eyes bluer than anything he’d ever seen. A tanned, slightly chiseled face with a serious expression resting on it, which rather than looking unattractive, made the guy even hotter. Dean didn’t even realize he was staring until the boy locked eyes with him.
Sam’s fourth and biggest class was Culinary, led by a teacher named Ms. Ramsumair. She explained that the first thing they were going to make was a simple one: pancakes. Sam got paired up with some kid that sat next to him, and the two worked tirelessly until their pancakes were finished. Right as they finished them, the bell rang, and everyone took off to their fifth period.
Jess then tilted her head again, glancing at Sam’s binder and then at him. “Oh, what’s your next class?”
Once the song finished, Cas and Balthazar blew out their respective candles, to a loud applause. Once the applause ended, Becky cut a large slice for both boys and handed them their plates first. Jack and Gavin got theirs second, mainly since Gavin was yet to fully grasp that when it wasn't his birthday, he didn't get cake first and wasn't being celebrated.
Their new town was Sioux Falls, South Dakota- the place Bobby had once lived years prior, before moving to another state after the death of his wife. Bobby had decided to move both boys to his hometown, far away from their old hometown of Lawrence, Kansas. Neither of the boys had ever been to Sioux Falls, so neither of them knew much about it, other than what Bobby had told them- and they were excited to live there.
“Bro I am not letting you hook up with someone before I do.” Cas barely had time to glance at the boy before he was hurriedly dragged upstairs by Balthazar.
“Mr. Lester? Lucky, he's one of the nicest teachers. I got stuck with the mean English teacher my first year.” Gabriel remarked. “What lunch periods do you all have?”
It wasn't until he finally got up and out of bed that he spotted the dozens of presents stacked neatly under the tree- surely the work of Cas, given how neat the presents looked- and realized that
By the time he got back, Cas had already returned from his family’s house, and was laying half-asleep on his bed. When Dean set his stuff down, the noise caused Cas to stir.
Cas shook his head, a small smile curving onto his mouth. "Your food isn't going anywhere. It's not going to disappear if you don't eat it within two minutes."
Cas picked Jack up and sat him on his bed. “Here. I’ll put a movie on and then I’ll go tell Mom that you're sick, okay?”
“I was born here, and I’ve never moved. I’ve just been living here all my life.” She tilted her head. “Where are you from? I’m guessing you’re new.”
Charlie shrugged. “Still, his aunt being the principal sounds better.” She then grabbed a french fry and shoved it into Jo’s face. Jo took the french fry and threw it back at Charlie, who ducked and threw a fry back at Jo.
“Nothing you can’t handle, hm?” She remarked with a laugh. Her attention then turned to Dean and Charlie, who waved. “These are the friends you brought with you?” When Cas nodded, the woman smiled and shook Dean and Charlie’s hands. “The name’s Becky Novak. I’m Castiel’s mother.”
Cas reached a hand out and grabbed a french crueler, biting into it joyfully. Dean, however, took a double chocolate donut with chocolate frosting while Gabriel grabbed a simple chocolate frosted with rainbow sprinkles. Gabriel, with his donut in hand, laid onto the couch, sitting with his legs spread out.
“How were your first five classes?” Dean inquired, taking out a plastic spoon to eat his spaghetti with.
Chuck yelled a simple “Okay!” in reply, so Becky turned and sent Cas back to his room, asking him to put Jack to bed.
Dean sighed, murmuring softly against Cas’s head. “You’re safe now, mkay?” Dean murmured, and Cas nodded, digging his head into Dean’s shoulder.
Dean grabbed the bag he had bought to carry his school stuff in, and piled his textbooks and pencils into it. He checked the clock, seven am.
“I’m going with Gabriel.” Said Balthazar, setting down his fork onto an empty plate. “I don't really wanna go with either of them, but Gabriel has better taste in music. All Lucifer listens to is hard rock.”
Dean heard footsteps walk away from the door, indicating Cas had walked off. Dean pulled his jacket on and opened the door, only to see a half awake Cas sitting on the side of his bed, pulling his shirt off to begin changing. Cas glanced over at Dean, and they barely locked eyes before Dean shifted his eyes away.
“I know you said no money, but please take this.” Cas handed Dean five twenties. “Buy something for your brother.”
The two made their way to the dorm's parking lot, which was full of cars. They made their way to Dean's car, and Dean climbed into the driver's seat and Cas into the passenger's seat.
Dean probably shouldn’t have ditched Sam so early into the party, but Dean needed food, and it’d probably be hard for the two of them to stick together the entire time, given how huge they both were. At least, that’s what Dean told himself as he walked to the dining room, where a table full of snacks laid.
“Yeah, but I don’t remember anything else.” Dean remarked, glancing at his brother. “Just the color blue. I can’t even remember
Sam shook his head, still a little wobbly and caught off guard. “No, no. I just… I don’t know. Guess I’m just a little off today.”
Christmas happens. Dean and Cas open presents, Gabriel brings food, Sam meets Cas and Bobby talks to Dean about love
Charlie clicked her tongue and let her eyes dart across Sam’s face. “That’s a shame. You mind if I help you find them?”
Jess gave a nod and then took out her phone- the teacher had already said that phones were allowed, only if you finished all your work. Seemingly sensing that Sam was slightly off, she pulled up her instagram and flipped to her saved videos. “Here, since we’re both done with our worksheets, I wanna show you something.” As Sam (and Andy) glanced at her phone, Jess proceeded to play a few videos of some cute and clumsy dogs, all while Sam began to smile even more. He ended up leaving his second period in a much better mood than when he had arrived.
He began unpacking his things, putting the blankets Bobby had bought him on his bed. At 10 that morning, not too long after Dean was fully unpacked, a knock came at the door. Expecting his roommate, he opened the door to see a boy standing there.
“Of course boy, and you don't need to thank me. That's what I’m here for, right? Now you go home and buy you and your brother some food.”
“Probably looking for my soulmate.” Dean whispered under his breath. Unfortunately for him, Benny heard that he said something.
When Cas glanced at him and raised an eyebrow, Balthazar just hushed him and put it in the cart. “He won’t notice.”
"Pancakes, whenever my mom would fix them." Cas explained. "Occasionally waffles or cereal. My family wasn't big on breakfast when I was growing up."
Gabriel certainly wasn’t expecting to be woken up on Monday morning to a pillow thrown at his face, but that’s exactly what he got. After he spluttered awake, he lifted his eyes to see a laughing Balthazar and a grinning Claire.
"Who are you talking to?" Dean asked as he walked into the room. Cas glanced at him, held a finger up, then hung up the phone a minute later.
"Winchester. Like the Winchester Mystery House? That place is amazing. I went there when I was 15, it's wicked." Charlie babbled, her eyes lighting up.
Lucifer finally came downstairs just moments after Anael ran upstairs, and he was followed by Hannah and Anna, both of whom were dressed and ready to go. As the three descended the stairs, Hannah grabbed Coffee, who was sitting on the fourth stair, and took her back to her room to put her up. Anna grabbed her own cat, Quinn, and put her up as well.
She pursed her lips momentarily, her dark eyes glancing across his face as if to scan him. Sam didn’t really understand why, but her eyes ran all over his face for a little while. However, it didn’t last more then a few seconds, as she quickly unpursed her lips and closed them flatly. “Nice to meet you too.” And without another word, she turned and went back to her worksheet.
Cas was about to shake his head out of the boy’s grasp, but then he caught it- a flash of green. His eyes landed on the boy’s face, only to see a bright kaleidoscope of color- including a set of brilliant green eyes.
“Yeah, just…” Dean’s voice trailed off, his eyes instead glancing around the room, taking in all the colors.
“She’s in the lunch line.” Dean replied, nodding his head towards the lunch line. Jo turned her head and pursed her lips.
Anna nearly fell over. “Are you fucking kidding me?? Michael! Michael you’ll never believe it!” She suddenly ran towards the stairs, waving her arms up. “Michael! Michael!”
“He pranks mostly his siblings or people he doesn’t like. Though, he does target random people every once in a while. Last year he went after a group of three freshmen. He hid in the bathrooms and threw toilet rolls that looked like poop at them.”
Dean nodded, his lips moving briefly. He paused, and suddenly, the slightest hint of fear glimmered behind his eyes. Dean’s eyes flickered and he bit his lip, almost as if he were trying to stop himself from saying something. He then quickly turned and headed to the dining room, plate in hand. Bobby immediately noticed and some unidentifiable look formed in his eyes, but he shook his head and just turned to fix himself some breakfast. Sam, however, glanced solemnly at Dean, who walked quickly and silently to the dining room. The memories of their biological father filled his mind, of the moments when John would give out an order or any sort of command, and how Dean would immediately stiffen and reply with a “yes sir.” How robotic he’d become. How robotic and soldier-like he’d been trained to be.
Dean climbed into Bobby’s car and the two of them took off to the nearby grocery store. When they walked inside, Bobby insisted Dean get anything and everything he’d need for college life for the next month. Dean gathered a bunch of snacks, such as cookies and chips. He also got lots of hamburger meat, ramen and pasta fixings, and lots and lots of bacon. He then got some salad fixings for Sam, and proclaimed he was done. Bobby insisted on paying for it all, all $250 of it.
Dean fell onto his bed and stretched, spreading his limbs out as he sighed in content. He couldn't remember a happier time.
“Don't worry about paying.” Cas took out his wallet and peered briefly into it. “I can cover you if you need anything extra.”
going to give it to Balthazar, but he’s currently throwing a DVD at Lucifer’s head. Just don’t give it to Balthazar unless he stops throwing DVDs at Lucifer.”
Dean nodded, stretching and sighing as relaxation flooded over his body. “Yeah. Just, my classes were really long today and the professors don’t know how to give us a break.”
“Some guy was making out with you, Cassie?” Gabriel asked. His voice was surprisingly not teasing in any way, but rather protective- if someone had laid a hand on Gabriel’s lil bro, that person would have a hell of a problem rain down onto them. The sudden fire in Anna’s eyes seemed to indicate that she’d be just as eager to protect Cas.
“American Horror Story for me,” Dean held up his paper so that Charlie could clearly see it, “But I’ve been meaning to watch Sherlock. I just got Netflix, so I should be able to watch it on there.”
Dean walked out of the dorm and headed to his classes, meeting up with his friend Benny on the way, who he had met while getting lunch in his second week of college.
In the end, it was 19-18, Charlie just barely stealing the win. She laughed and clapped her hands in response, while Dean just groaned.
Cas’s door was thrown wide open by Hannah, who stood confidently in the doorway with a card in hand. Behind her stood Balthazar and Claire, smiles on their faces.
As he slowly finished off his cake, the others began regaling stories and laughing. Even Dean did something absolutely unprecedented- he leaned against Cas as he ate. Cas only glanced at the man beside him, something bubbling and festering behind his eyes. The taller man leaned against him with an evident fondness, uncaring to the looks of the others as they talked.
Samandriel once again typed away at the computer, picked a video that Cas pointed to, and put it in the playlist.
His eyes began to scour the crowds, spotting families with young children and couples holding hands. It suddenly made Dean very grateful he had Cas next to him, though a bit resentful that he couldn't hold hands with Cas like he wanted. As Cas pointed out a few of the otters, Dean laughed, and Anna watched with a sort of curiosity from where she was.
“You must be Dean!” Cried a voice, and Dean turned to face a tall, blonde man with a grin on his face. “I’m Lucifer.”
It was 7:30 am, way too early for Dean to function, when he was shaken awake by a very eager Cas. There was a glow in his eyes- excitement, perhaps, or just pure, unadulterated joy.
The car ride once again wasn’t that long, and they arrived rather quickly at the house, which was much prettier in the daytime. Not to mention Dean and Sam could now see colors. The house, as they had suspected, was a creamish color, with black trim and shutters, and a beautiful cherry oak door.
“What luck!” The boy exclaimed slurredly, tilting his head. “I was hoping to find a hot person here.”
Michael lifted his head and turned to stare at Cas and Gabriel. A bit skeptical, he walked over to the two of them. “Okay then, Cas what’s my eye color?”
Dean climbed into his car, and after placing his school bag on the ground, began the twenty minute drive to the college he was to attend.
“Charlie,” Sam began, as she turned her head, “I’m all for helping Dean find his soulmate, but at least a quarter of the school was there. I don’t think they were keeping track of who was there.”
He didn’t know exactly why he was so worried and caught up about his soulmate’s identity, given that he had been so adamant to find them. But something about his soulmate being an infamous trickster just deterred him. He wasn’t a fan of the attention that he knew would follow that revelation.
The teacher talked for a surprisingly long time, but he finished around ten minutes before the class ended, so he left everyone to their own devices as he went to his desk. Sam and Andy struck up a conversation, talking endlessly about being the new kids in town and what they thought of the city so far.  Andy didn't really seem to care for it, saying that he moved around so much that he never got attached to one place. Sam, however, loved the city, and went on and on about what he loved about it and how excited he was to be there.
Dean hung up on Bobby, then started his car. He started to drive home, listening to rock music on the entire drive home.
By one am, however, he had been dragged back inside by a very drunk Lucifer, who slurred about how Cas needed to “enjoy himself” before handing him a cup of beer and slapping him on the back. Irritated but knowing Lucifer would just hunt him down later (Lucifer was surprisingly determined when drunk), Cas gulped down the drink, ignoring the horribly bitter taste. When he finished it off, Lucifer laughed, patted him on the back and ran off to some other part of the house, probably to force another one of their siblings to drink.
As Dean did so, Cas slowly drifted off to sleep, and soon, Dean found Cas's head resting on his shoulder. Dean would've moved him, but Cas looked rather peaceful sleeping, and something in Dean told him to not disturb Cas. So, he didn't. Instead, he took one of his two jackets off and laid it over Cas like a blanket. And not even an hour later, Dean had fallen asleep with his own head leaning against Cas.
Sam then walked out of the front door and walked hurriedly to the Impala, ignoring the boy’s drunken cries. Once he reached the Impala, he simply sat down on the grass and watched YouTube videos, trying avidly to pass the time and drown out any thoughts of Gabe or the color gold.
“This early, Cas?” Balthazar gave him a glance, his gray blue eyes locking with Cas’s. “Class doesn’t start for twenty five more minutes.”
The girl, who Dean supposed was the ‘Ms. Bradbury’ the teacher had mentioned, had long, somewhat dark colored hair and was wearing a Star Wars shirt. It didn't take her long to notice Dean sitting next to her, and she immediately stuck her hand out.
“At the party.” Sam murmured, shyness evident in his tone. “It’s just.. I don’t know, I guess since you also found yours there, I felt it’d be awkward to say I also found mine. And I just wasn’t thinking. Shock, I guess.”
“Yeah, wh-“ Sam suddenly stopped himself, though thankfully not suspiciously. He quickly regretted his slip of the tongue, however, when he saw how Charlie’s face lit up.
I'll try to write a bit of Charlie and Dorothy moments in this fic but I can't guarantee anything. Also, Dean can cook because why not
I managed to whip this up over two days so it's probably poor quality so forgive me! I'm in Japan at the moment and my brain is fried, so I do apologize if this chapter is bad. Anyways, please enjoy! Sorry for the wait!
Gabriel was the first to take a glance at the playlist, his eyes scrolling over the numerous songs in the playlist. “Make sure you add ‘Living Dead Girl’. Lucifer goes nuts over that song. And I wouldn’t put Devil Devil in, it's a pretty quiet song for the most part. Not good for a big party.”
The month of November soared by particularly quickly that year. Dean had become consumed with his schoolwork and visiting his younger brother that he barely had time to spend a full day with Cas. Of course, now that it was the week of Thanksgiving break, Dean had been doing nothing
“Oh, Kevin, you’re here.” Sam exclaimed joyously, before glancing briefly at Dean, who was very obviously drunk. “I’m going to drive the Impala home with Dean, Jo and Charlie. You, Benny and Meg will take Meg’s car back to my house. Just have Benny follow me, okay?”
“Bro, I have a soulmate. I’m gonna be in a good mood for a while.” Gabriel held the door open for the three of them, and they all walked into the Five Guys. “Now, order up!”
