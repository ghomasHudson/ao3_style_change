‘’Not a wise idea to sneak up on a witcher, boy.’’ Dean growled at the lad, hoping to scare him off.
Cas didn’t say anything else for a moment, just tilted his head in that way which suggested he could read Dean’s mind, before asking Dean about what he was doing in town. Dean told him about the kikimora hunt; he told Cas the best bits of the lore and how he was planning on dealing with it. They sat in comfortable conversation, Dean merely telling Cas about different hunts and monsters, Castiel asking relevant questions and nodding along with him. They spent the best part of a couple of hours conferring along with one anothers’ anecdotes and theories, eventually being interrupted by a barmaid on mission to retrieve Dean’s half eaten bowl of soup. When she asked if there was anything else she could get them, Castiel politely declined, placing a couple of coins onto the tabletop, seemingly having decided that the evening had come to a natural end.
Castiel did not snort at him, instead his lips pressed together in a tight line, his head nodding. They finished their drinks in silence, allowing another round to pass. Drinking together in a comfortable silence. Castiel pulled out his coin purse, pressing the coins into the wood. As the barkeep wandered back over, Castiel stood, pulling his cloak further across his shoulders.
‘’Our gardens are vast- I cannot see what exists outside of them that we cannot precure for you. Hmm?’’
He manged to kick the man in the hip, but with too little force to cause more than a startled grunt. The man held his hands up, backing away from the hunched witcher. He looked at Dean’s clenched fists and lowered stance with bemused interest. He stayed still for a second, straightening out his doublet, brushing the dust caused by Dean’s boot on his hip.  Dean didn't like this, he didn’t like this at all. His eyes darted to Impala; knowing escape was his best bet right now. She was saddled and ready, he just needed a good, quick movement.
‘’Easy? The guy has been asking me to join your cause for weeks.’’ Dean felt heat in his stomach as he tried to defend the other man, not sure why his brain though it necessary to do so.
It was happening; he realized too late that his legs were giving out and fell unceremoniously to his knees. Dean couldn’t do this, couldn’t face this, couldn’t live without his angel.
“Hold up now, you are both getting way far ahead of me here. We don’t even know if Cas and I are Soul bound. It could just be, and probably is, a bunch of crap from Rowena.” Dean was looking up, a little defensively.
There was a long pause when no one spoke, then clearly, with more strength than he had had in days, "He told me he loved me."
"We will get him back, Dean" Sam's voice was strong and reassuring. "We will figure this out, even if we have to rip through worlds to do it."
“Yeah, Sammy, I’ll be right there,” Dean called, wrapping his towel around his waist. He was suddenly reminded of when Cas was first human. He had been so perplexed at the experience of and need for showering. Cas had talked for hours about the process, asking questions about how to select shampoos and soaps. In the end, Dean was glad he had chosen the sandalwood shampoo. It suited him.
Dean can taste the tang of blood and tears in his mouth and opens his eyes. Sam is lifting him to his feet, supporting him. Dean's whole body is lead, and tension and pain. Somehow he finds himself in his room, but it feels cold and foreign. He doesn't know how long he just lay there, but eventually, he drifts into a fit-full sleep.
Sam frowned. “One problem, though, Jack. The whole problem is that Cas is stuck in the empty, and we can’t get to him. How are we supposed to get his blood when he isn’t here?”
Dean smiled slightly. “You always were the smart one, Sammy.” He sighed, grabbing the top book and looking at the cover. “Well, these books won’t read themselves” Dean looked up, cleared his throat, sat at the table and began to read. Sam and Jack followed suit.
He was back before the woman, lounging on her throne of darkness, relishing every moment of pain and confusion Cas experienced. She looked down at him from her throne, laughing. “Oh, Clarence, did you think your lover was truely there?”. Tears fill Castiel’s eyes as she grips the air again, and he feels his bones breaking. How much more of this could he take? Strangely he could still hear Zeppelin playing faintly in the background, and with a small tug beneath his rib cage, he wondered if Dean could hear it too.
“What if it is Love dean? The Love. What if you and Cas, if you have always been meant for one another if your love is more than a normal love? What if this is the Love, the soul bond gifted to the world by Freyja.” Sam was looking more and more convinced.
Dean was sitting on his bed, his head hurt and he was exhausted. Being cured of one’s demon state is no joke. He rubbed his left forearm, frowning slightly, the mark of Cain was still there in scarred raised flesh. Silently, he looked through a set of photos of him and Sam together. The memories of what his demon-self had done washed over him and he wanted to focus on the memories that really mattered. Dean paused on a photo of Cas, eyes alight with a bright smile.
“Well, we may have an option or two.” She paused and looked at Sam and Dean. “Now, I don’t want you boys getting your hopes up, this is a long shot, a very long shot, but I suppose you don’t have any other options do you.” She paused, looking for confirmation before she continued. “One of the benefits of being Queen of Hell is that it actually has an excellent library. Not that the daemons do much reading. I doubt very much if Fergus ever read these books”. She paused again, this time clearly for dramatic effect, “come, let Auntie Rowena read you an ancient storey.”
“How” Dean's voice rasped as he dropped his hand and placed the tie back into his pocket. How do I get him back, how can I save him, see him?” He was distraught but kept staring at the ground in front of him. “Even if Freyja is the original being Love, and even if I have a soul bond with Cas, that doesn’t help anything. Freyja has clearly left earth a long time ago, she is probably in Valhalla, and I am not.”
“Well it’s worth a try now isn’t it Samuel!” She didn’t try hiding the slight edge to her voice. “It’s not like we can leave your brother in a heap of his own feelings now, can we? Chuck isn’t gone Samuel, and with no souls to come to hell, let’s just say my Demons are feeling a bit restless. It’s no good for anybody leaving our one shot at saving the world in a puddle on my hall floor.” She was standing very straight but looked kindly towards Dean.
The hall was wide and large, and there were Daemons on all sides. Sam and Dean were standing together, angle blades at their sides just in case. Rowena may be their friend, but that didn’t mean her Deamon’s wouldn’t have a little fun before handing them over.
"There is no one left on earth," jack emphasized the last word. "If the Empty is still full, perhaps Hell is too. We could ask Rowena".
Dean was looking at the floor again. He wasn’t sure how long he could keep from falling apart. There was nothing they could do anyway; all he would hear is that it can’t be done, and he would fall apart right here in Hell. Fitting, really, considering Hell was where he had first bet Cas. At least he supposed that was when they met, he doesn’t remember Cas dragging him up from Hell, but Cas has described it to him enough times it feels like he does.
And Dean's world was shifting, what had he meant? Did Cas not know how much Dean loved him? He didn't have time to ask, though. Cas's hand came to rest on his shoulder, the shoulder where he first touched Dean all those years ago. Then the world was spinning, and he was hitting the floor, and a hole ripped in the wall. The empty was taking Cas. Dean's heart was being ripped out of his chest; the world shifted and fell into silence.
“Well, you, on the other hand, you, you’re looking good” Dean was speaking just clear enough for Sam and Jack to make out.
Soon the universe became filled with soles, and Freyja created Valhalla, a place to honour those soles who died to protect what Freyja held most dear, that which they truly loved. Freyja collected these warriors from battlefields, but the universe soon had too many soles for her to collect herself. Thus she birthed the Valkyrie. The Valkyrie were as strong as angles and also cunning reapers. They went into the world and gathered the soles of those worthy of an eternity in Valhalla. Chuck created Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory and asked Death to move the human soles from earth to their eternal home when they died. Desiring to maintain balance, Death agreed and created the Reapers to ensure no sole became lost.
"Cas' moment of true happiness was with Dean?" Confusing sparked on Sam's face, then realization followed by deep concern. "Oh Gods," he breathed, "Dean will never get over this."
A tear escaped his eyes, but he just nodded. Rowena started pacing. “How much do you love him, Dean?” Her face was intent with concentration.
“Come on Dean, we're about to find out, aren’t we? If the spell works, Freyja will come and we will know you are Soul bound to Cas. If it doesn’t work we can storm back into Rowena’s throne room in Hell and demand some answers.” Sam practically rolled his eyes at Dean.
“I calmed him. He was having a panic attack and wouldn’t have calmed down otherwise, so I calmed him myself. He will wake up in a minute or so.”
Suddenly the room blurred and receded until Dean was standing in complete and utter darkness. He turned around, trying to get his bearings. What in the hell happened? Where am I? A scream echoed in the distance. The sound was unmistakable and sent a knife through Dean’s chest. Cas. He ran. He ran as fast as he could towards the sound of agony. He ran and kept running, but couldn’t get any closer. Another voice, a female one, was smirking and taunting. “No-one is coming to save you, Clarence,” the female drawled. “He never loved you; why would he bother? All you ever did was leave him. Look again at your happy memory and know that it was all a lie”.
Jack rushed in, bringing the napkin and placing it in the bowl. Sam came shortly after panting slightly. “We had some old Jewels in the archive. I grabbed a few pieces of gold and a pair of amber earrings. Hopefully, it’s enough.” Sam dropped them unceremoniously into the bowl.
“But, Dean and Cas are so perfect together, how could anyone have a problem with that?” Jack seemed utterly perplexed.
“I’ll make some fresh coffee, and then we need to sort out a solution to these nightmares. He can’t continue like this.” Sam left Dean with Jack in the library and stalked out of the room.
Castiel was sitting in a blank void, angel blade in hand. Dean approached him, and Naomi barked the order to kill him. He didn’t want to. He tried to fight it, but his limbs were moving of their own accord as he plunged the angel blade through Dean’s heart. Castiel stared into Dean’s green eyes, watching the shock and hurt there as he died. Castiel held dean’s body close to him and wept while Naomi…. No... Meg… laughed. Dean’s body vanished, replaced by darkness. “That was fun, wasn’t it, Clarence.” Meg, the empty, drawled. “That’s right, not the first time you Killed old lover boy, was it? How many more ways can you do it, Clarence?” The woman disappeared, and Castiel was transported to another blank void. Heaven, he realized. Dean entered through a door on the other side of the room.
“Those in my coven who used to worship the goddess Freyja used to say that to summon her from Valhalla one needed a token of a love truly bonded, the tears of one who has lost, the tears of love over land and water, and the blood of one a Valkyrie would keep” Rowena paused as if remembering some fond memory of years passed.
As Sam approached Dean’s room, he could see the light on in Cas,’ and someone was speaking. Dean was praying, praying to Cas. Sam’s heart broke for Dean. When Sam was sure Dean was finished, he knocked gently on the door. “Hey Dean…How are you doing?”
Jack dropped the napkin into a Ziplock baggie with a smug smile on his face. He looked sidelong as Sam responded “I’ve been thinking about the spell too. Don’t look so surprised Dean, Sam told me everything last night.” Jack held up the baggie with some pride. “I just got us the first ingredient.”
I have another chapter ready. It's starting to take shape now. Thank you for reading, and as always, I appreciate any comments or constructive criticism you have.
“Well yeah, Dean” Sam was confused by Dean’s evident delight. “We don’t have any of Cas’s blood, and we can’t get to him. That’s kind of the whole problem.”
Cas was leaving; he was going to leave Dean again. Why? "Don't do this, Cas." Dean pleaded, knowing he couldn't change it. He didn't want Cass to leave, but nothing could have prepared him for what he heard next.
Dean looked up, the knowledge dawning on him as a smile grew on his face. “You mean…” Dean put his hand on Sam’s shoulder while he looked at him. “You mean that the last thing we need to complete the spell is a bit of Cas’ blood? And you think that means we can’t do the spell?”
Sam laughed and smiled at Dean, still sitting perplexed, gripping his coffee with both hands. “the tears of one who has lost. Dean, Jack is right, you lost Cas and were crying about it, so … one ingredient down. Now, that leaves A token of a love truly bonded, the tears of love over land and water, and the blood of one a Valkyrie would keep.”
"He is gone," whispered, his body shaking. "He is gone, and I can't…I can't…" Dean was sniffling into a firm hug from Sam.
“Somehow, I think you know the answer to that one” Castiel looked at the women lounging on her throne, surrounded by nothingness. “You don’t seem to be sleeping well”
“Cas has been human, he can love, he can bleed, he has a soul. I think he is one a Valkyrie would keep.”
“Don’t mention it” Sam smiled, settling himself on a near-by chair and drinking his coffee. “Jack is the one you should be thanking, though,” he added, nodding at Jack. Sitting in a chair examining Dean closely, Jack said matter of factly, “you had a panic attack, so I calmed you down.”
Dean just shook his head, eyes beginning to water. The pain of it was rising in his throat again. He lost Cas, and may never see him again. He let Cas think Dean didn’t love him back. He knew in his heart there was nothing more true than what he felt for Cas, but there was also the shame that came with it. Dean shook his head again and a tear fell from his eye. “I’m sorry”
“Hey, handsome!” Dean called over, green eyes sparkling with mischief. “I was looking for you, thought you might like to take Baby for a spin. Sam is out clearing up a simple salt and burn, so…we have a few days to ourselves.” Dean winked at Cas.
“Dean, foods ready. You almost done in there?” The heavy wooden door muffled sam’s voice, but Dean heard well enough. Dean turned off the water and reached for his towel.
“Probably Cas. It always seems to be Cas these days, though more often than not, it’s a nightmare”. As if on cue, Dean started screaming for Cas, violently twitching as if trying to run in his sleep.
It seemed to work somewhat because Dean just let out a huff and turned to leave, grabbing the bottle of whiskey and ruffling Jack's hair as he passed. “You’re a good kid Jack, I’ll tell you all about it in the morning ok? Right now I need to drink until my brain stops processing how much I miss your dad ok?” With that Dean left taking another swig as he went.
“Well, when the love of your life just up and dies, then you get a vote. But right now Sammy, I can’t feel what I’m feeling, so I’m getting a damn drink” He knew he shouldn’t be yelling at Sam. He just couldn’t help it. Too many feelings and so much confusion bubbled up inside him he felt like he would explode. Maybe there was a vampire nest somewhere. He downed one large gulp from the Whiskey bottle and poured himself a glass. The burn in his stomach starting to ease his senses a bit.
"I know Dean; I know" Sam's voice was pained but reassuring. "Let's get you some coffee," he turned to Jack, who was standing awkwardly at the door, a pained expression on his face. "Jack, get us some coffee, please."
"I didn't know he loved me; how could he love me? I'm a complete mess. Though apparently, he thinks….thought… that I'm the most loving and caring human on the planet" Dean didn't look up.
This was no different. He was sitting in the Impala's passenger seat, Dean in the driver’s seat, and Led Zeppelin coming through the stereo.
“This book appears to be an anthology of sorts, a collection of legends about goddesses of love and fertility. The inscription says the Men of Letters think all the goddesses listed may have actually been the same. Still, their history was recorded differently in different regions and at different times. There seem to be several accounts over time, witchcraft inspired by love, and stories of the goddesses’ grief. There is one story about Freyja, describing how in a time when her husband was absent, she searched the earth weeping, and as her tears hit the land, they turned to gold, and as her tears hit the water, they turned to amber.” Jack looked ecstatic and pointed to the book. It illustrated a woman with long hair and a raven feathered cloak crying, and she walked.
Jack swore, shaking his head. “You’re right, I could try to open a rift to the empty long enough to get some blood, but we don’t know if he would bleed there, or if we could safely open the rift without angering the empty and attracting Chuck’s attention.”
“What’s the matter?” Rowena asked, surprised. The daemons around her began snickering at the broken man on the floor of Hell’s throne room. “Silence!” Rowena shrieked in a voice that set the daemons cowering away.
“I’m coming for you….It wasn’t a lie….I love you” Dean’s screams broke into incoherent pleas for Cas. Sam was already across the room, gripping Dean by the shoulders and shaking him.
Hours in, Dean still hadn’t found anything useful. He was beginning to drift in and out of consciousness as he read, his mind wandering to thoughts of Cas. Cas covered in Honey, Cas in Purgatory, Cas holding him tightly as the mark of Cain took hold, Cas human and working at the Gas n’ Sip….Cas…..
Dean seemed to steel himself slightly “I’ve been thinking about the spell to summon Freyja….What the…..” Dean startled as a cotton napkin rubbed against his eye from behind. Jack had wiped something from his face.
“I know how Dean feels about my Dad; heck, I’ve known for some time now that he thinks of himself as my Dad too. Dean won’t admit it, but it’s true.” Jack looked at Sam before they fell into a comfortable silence. They had to keep trying. And they would.
About an hour, and one sandalwood shower later, Dean was sitting at the kitchen table, a fresh cup of coffee warming his hands. He wasn’t sure how long he was sitting there, in the uncomfortable company of his own thoughts. How could he have said that to Sam? Of course, Sam has lost people too, they all had. Would Sam forgive him? How would they get Eileen back? Could they get Eileen back? One thing at a time, once they have Cas back he can help them defeat Chuck and set the world right again. One thing at a time…
Dean had been pacing in the bunker’s war room for at least an hour, unable to think straight or sit still. He needed to do something. He couldn’t leave Cas alone with the empty. He needed to get out, to be somewhere else. He went to his room, changed into a fresh set of clothes, grabbed Baby’s keys and went out. Driving Baby felt better. The rumble of her engine was soothing as he pulled onto the streets of Lebanon. Dean drove for a while in silence before pulling into the Gas n’ Sip. He filled Baby’s tank and thought with a pang about the time Cas lived there as a human. Feeling a little better, Dean popped the mixtape he made Cas into Baby’s stereo and turned up the volume. Led Zeppelin was blasting in his ears as he pulled out of the Gas n’ Sip parking lot and onto the empty streets again.
Dean lay silently in his bed, head upon his pillow, curled in the nothingness that was his life. How could he have been so stupid? Could have saved him? Why would Cas think no he had made Cas thank that Dean word never love him back. There was a knocking at the door.
"It feels different this time. I know I brought Cass back from the empty once, but I don't think that will work again," Jack says pensively. It's late, and they are both exhausted. "Do you think Cas used his deal with the Empty to save dean?"
“Samuel” Rowena was looking at him sternly. “Stop analyzing your brother's grief...” she paused, her red hair curling around her face and red lips pursed in a haughty, friendly way only Rowena could manage. “His sentimentality may prove useful yet.”
Jack looked thoughtful for a moment. “I have been thinking about that. Based on what Rowena said, the Valkyrie collect the souls of those who die protecting what they truly love, right?”
Dean felt the hardwood of the chair under his body and blinked his eyes open. The ornate brass spell bowl was still smoking in a faintly purple hue atop the wooden table in front of him. It took his eyes a moment to adjust to the extra light as he blinked them open. Was hell always so dark? Jack was sitting in front of him, his t-shirt rumpled and face set in relief and concentration.
Sam just stared at Dean. Dean, the tough big brother, the monster fighter, the brother who listened to Led Zeplin and constantly condemned any so-called “chick flick moments”. His big brother was hunched and small, lost and desperate, holding on to the only piece of Cas he could. Does Dean not realize that he holds more of Cas in his heart, mind and soul than any tie ever could? Then again Dean has always been insufferably emotionally constipated. Maybe Dean needs something physical to ground him.
Distraught in her grief, Freyja carried her Love to Valhalla, where he stays to this day. And thus, Freyja created the first sole bond. The most powerful magic in the universe draws on the power of a true love's soul bond. Soles cannot be bonded through ceremony or ritual, nor by the existence of a romantic feeling or relationship. Rather, a soul bond comes into being automatically, and only for the truest and deepest of loves is it present. When one loves the other wholly, unconditionally, and irreversibly, one's soul becomes bonded to the other. The sole bond will strengthen over time and can exist without the conscious knowledge of those bound. These bonds are so rare it may be eons between the loves that are sole bound. This bond was Freyja's gift to the world, a gift to honour her husband, and a gift so strong no force of the universe could break it. A gift to protect love for eternity.
Cas was writhing in pain. How much more could he take? Castiel thought of Dean, spending thirty years in Hell being tortured before succumbing and torturing others. He never blamed Dean for what happened in Hell. When Cas had first arrived in Hell, Dean was covered in blood, carving up some fresh soul with Alistair. He had never told Dean that he had watched him torture in Hell before grabbing him and raising him from perdition. That whole time Cas could only think how beautiful his soul was beneath all the pain and suffering that lead to him torturing and tormenting others for a decade in Hell. Now, being tortured, Cas was impressed Dean had lasted thirty years at all. He wasn’t sure he would have the strength, and now, facing eternity here with the empty, Cas felt hopeless.
“Ok, so how are we supposed to collect the tears of some cosmic goddess or whatever, when she is in another world? And how are we supposed to find the blood of one a Valkyrie would keep?” Sam looked between Rowena and Dean, looking confused in the way he did when he was thinking of a complete issue.
Dean awoke screaming again, disoriented and terrified. Had that been his Cas the Empty was torturing? It couldn’t be, Dean was just dreaming. In his heart, he knew it wasn’t true. They needed to get Cas back, and fast before that Cosmic Bitch hurt Cas more.
“Summon her?” Sam looked shocked, “You think we could summon Freyja and have her help us retrieve Cas from the empty?”
"Dean," Sam was there, panting as if he had run, concern written across his face. "Dean, it's ok, it was just a dream." Except it wasn't, not really. No amount of time in Hell could have prepared him for this. His new, entirely personal, living Hell.
The warm smell of coffee filled the room as Sam returned. Jack had moved Dean from the table to a sofa and was wrapping him in a warm blanket. Dean looked stunned but more relaxed. “I’m keeping him calm with my grace,” Jack said proudly. “I didn’t think we should risk him grabbing the whiskey.”
Jack looked up and shook his head. “Some interesting things on how to invoke a celestial bond, not that we need that, some other stuff on the properties of celestial bonds, and soul-bonding rituals, but nothing that would help us with the spell.” Jack shrugged. “I know it wasn’t one of the books we picked out originally, but I saw it there and thought it couldn’t hurt to know more about what this…true love soul bond might entail.”
They entered the throne room where Rowena was sitting, poised, waiting for them. Her red hair curled about her face, which was set into a stern yet alluring smirk. She turned to them, bright red dress hugging her curves and flowing out at the bottom. She always was elegant.
In time Freyja met a handsome human warrior. He was kind, caring, and she loved him truly. Believing such love was impossible, Chuck sought to prove this and transformed Freyja's Love into a hideous water dragon. After many days of searching, she became distraught and sat by the water for a rest. The monster approached her; it's hideous teeth, mangled face and scales emerging from the water. Freyja recognized him immediately and leapt into the water to greet him. Their love transcended all else, unconditional in its truest sense. After many happy years living together by the water, a worrier mistook the monster for a threat and slew him. Chucks revenge for having been unable to control and end her love of him.
“You have to understand that, as well-intentioned, as our father was growing up, he was far from perfect. One night, he might have been 16, dad caught him and another boy in an intimate position behind the motel we were staying in. Dad was furious and called him all sorts of things no one should ever hear. You see, not everyone believes two men should be allowed to love each other. It is ridiculous that it is even an issue, but that one experience has left Dean with an internalized homophobia.” Sam looked sad at the memory.
Rowena did seem to understand, and her face turned pensive. She turned and moved toward Dean, kneeling before him. She reached out a hand to lift his chin and looked into his eyes. They had gone flat, no spark left in them. Keeping his face steady in her hand, she watched closely as she asked, “Do you love him too?”
“Tears of Love over land and water….gold and amber. Jack, I think you got it.” Sam began to smile but paused. “That still leaves us with the blood of one a Valkyrie would keep. Everyone else on earth is gone.”
“Well, your time is up now boys chat again soon!” She smirked sadly at them both. The world bent and twisted around them until they were both sitting at the table they had just left.
“Yeah, I hope so. I’m worried about Dean. I mean, even if we manage to summon Freyja and, even if the Soul Bond is what’s connecting Dean to Cas right now, we're still no closer to understanding how to rescue Cas. I don’t think Dean can survive losing him again, and this hope has Dean in a dangerous position.” Sam looked worried.
“No, Forget it..” getting up slowly from the bed and taking a few steps towards the Angel. “Well, you, on the other hand, you, you’re looking good.” Dean's eyes rove over Castile once more, and he swallows as a familiar and terrifying feeling washes over him. “So… uh…are you back?” Hope-filled dean, and a fear that Cas would leave him again.
"Not on Earth, Dean…" Sam's voice was full of concern, "But Jack thinks there are souls still elsewhere." Sam paused, unsure how much he should assume, how much Dean could handle. "We will get them back, Dean… All of them." With that, Sam turned and walked back to the kitchen.
Dean froze; suddenly, he didn’t feel like talking. Couldn’t talk was more like it. He reached into his pocket and held Cas’ tie. “And where is your Angel?” She added, looking around. “Did you fix it as I told you too?”
Thanks for reading my second chapter! I hope you liked it. As always comments and feedback are appreciated.
It was late, the remnants of supper laid out on the library table. A small fire in the hearth kept the room warm and comfortable. Sam set his book down beside him, rubbing both hands through his hair in frustration. “I don’t know, Jack, is this even possible?” Sam shook his head in disbelief.
Silence-The roaring in Dean's head is deafening and nothing; he can't think, he can't hear. Cas is gone. Dean is sitting on the cold concrete floor; the world has fallen out beneath him. Cas is gone. Somewhere, in a distant place in-side him, he knows he is sobbing, but nothing matters. His back is leaning against something, it must be the wall, but he feels dizzy, disoriented; this can't be happening. His mouth has gone dry, and he can taste bile as a thousand tiny knives stab his throat from the inside. At least, that is how it feels. He can't breathe; his whole body hurts. He can feel words chocking up into his throat, but they won't come out. I love you. It won't help to speak them now. He is gone. Vaguely, Dean is aware of someone calling for him; maybe it's Sam, he doesn't care. Nothing matters. He hasn't moved since it happened. Cas told him he loved him, that he was the most caring person in the world, and died. His true happiness had been to tell Dean the truth. Dean's stomach hurts from sobbing; it feels tight and painful and exhausted. It feels like eons ago, or was it seconds, that the empty had taken him. Robbed him from this world, and a piece of Dean went with him. "Dean…Dean.." someone is shaking him, but he doesn't respond. He can't. He sits there with his head in his hands, shaking.
"The Empty agreed to let me go in exchange for Cas. They said they would come for Cas when he experienced a moment of true happiness". Jack looked at Sam and could see the thoughts starting to form in his head.
Dean was sitting on his bed, his head hurt, and he was exhausted. Being cured of one’s demon state is no joke. He rubbed his left forearm, frowning slightly; Cain's mark was still there in scarred raised flesh. Silently, he looked through a set of photos of him and Sam together. The memories of what his demon-self had done washed over him, and he wanted to focus on the memories that mattered. Dean paused on a photo of Cas, eyes alight with a bright smile. Just then, there was a knock at the door, and Dean stashed the pictures under a book on his bedside table. “yeah,” he calls, clearing his throat.
Dean’s mind began to wander as he drank his coffee in the silent kitchen. Could he really have a soul bond with Cas? How could they find the ingredients for the summoning spell? The spell ingredients kept circulating in his head. A token of a love truly bonded, the tears of one who has lost, the tears of love over land and water, and the blood of one a Valkyrie would keep.
"How? Chuck is still out there, and there are no people left on earth to help us" Sam looked like he would be sick.
Dean was screaming, screaming as loud as he could for Cas, telling him we were coming, that it wasn’t all a lie. His throat hurt, but Cas couldn’t hear him, couldn’t see him. Suddenly he was aware of strong hands on his shoulders, shaking him and pulling him back to reality.
“It’s been a long day Jack” Sam explained looking over again. “Let’s grab some food and I’ll explain. It’s worse than we thought, but we may have a shot at getting Cas back”
Sam pulled up a chair next to the bed and sat across from Dean. “Well… Jack and I figured out what the spell ingredients are… but…We are pretty sure one of them will be impossible to obtain.” Dean put his head in his hands as Sam continued. “The tears are gold and amber, so that is easy… but the blood of one a Valkyrie would keep… Dean, there is no one left on earth, and Jack is pretty sure that of all of us, the only one who satisfies all the requirements is Cas.” Sam let that hang in the air between them before continuing. “Jack can try to get into the empty long enough to get a bit of blood from Cas, but there is no guarantee it would work, and in any event, it would use too much power. Chuck would notice…I’m sorry, Dean.”
"The one thing I want…that I truly want…I know I can't have" Cas was looking at him with those precious blue eyes, tears of joy and relief and sorrow in them. What was happening? Why was he saying this?
“Peachy” Dean groaned slightly as he sat up and got out of his chair. One never quite got used to moving between realms like that. Everything is heavier in Hell like gravity is stronger. Getting to hell was fine, but returning always felt too light, too bright. “I need a drink” he waved towards Sam and Jack in question.
“We can figure this out,” Jack said, setting down his book and looking over at Sam. “I know that this is all too hard for Dean to process, but I want my dad back too. I will keep reading all night if I have to.” Jack looked determined. Jack rose to fetch the last book from the table and read out the title “legends of love, this may help.”
Jack looked at Sam carefully and then nodded. “That doesn’t mean it hurts you any less having lost Eileen.” Jack's face was serious as he looked at his uncle, leaving the statement to hang between them for a moment.
Dean met Sam and Jack in the kitchen, where they ate quickly and discussed their plan to visit Rowena. Jack would stay behind to make sure the spell held. It made sense. If Chuck showed up, they would need someone strong like jack to make sure Dean and Sam got back safe. Dean was dressed in his usual flannel shirt and Jeans but had tucked Cas’ tie into his pocket. He found himself rubbing it gently between his fingers, grounding him. How long would it be until he could use that tie too… No, he couldn’t go there yet. He had to get Cas back first, and then he could fantasize about pulling him into a deep kiss and holding him steady by the tie…
Jack was back in no time with three warm mugs of coffee. Sam didn't care for coffee much, preferring tea usually, but Dean needed coffee. Dean sat in silence for a long time; the warm liquid was grounding him, and the caffeine clearing his head. Slowly, he calmed until he was able to speak and form words. No one rushed him. Sam and jack just sat with him, waiting.
“What happened, Dean?” Jack looked with concern at Dean’s eyes. “You were dreaming, and then you were in a nightmare; that much was obvious, but what were you dreaming about?”
Dean lit his lighter and was about to ignite the spell when he hesitated. “What if it doesn’t work?”
Sam set a stack of books down on the library table. They landed on its polished wood surface with a hollow thud. “This is everything I could find about love, love magic, and gods/goddesses of love. Hopefully, there is something in here that is useful.”
Dean looked at the floor and then told them everything he could remember. The memory that was like a dream, the empty, her torturing Cas, him running to reach Cas but unable to reach him. After he was finished, they all sat in silence for a moment, contemplating the situation. After a moment, Jack started flipping through the book on celestial bonds, making small contemplative sounds as he read. “Hmm yes…” Jack mumbled at last. “It says here that when two souls are bound, the bond acts as a sort of subconscious thread connecting the two people. People who are bound can sense the other’s emotions and may experience a phantom of their experience” Jack paused for a moment, looking up from the book.
Sam cleared his throat and then spoke. “Dean and Cas were fighting Billy. They had injured her, but she had them cornered and was going to kill them both. Castiel had made a deal with the Empty that, in exchange for releasing Jack, she would claim Cas in a moment of true happiness. As Billy was attacking, Cas told Dean that he loved him, the Empty came and took both Cas and Billy. I found dean shaking and sobbing on the floor, and he didn’t speak for days. This is pretty much what it’s been like ever since. He is completely heartbroken.” Sam looked at Rowena, willing her to understand. So he didn’t have to say it outright.
“So what, I’m on some kind of cosmic benzos now? My head feels like crap.” Dean made to get up but couldn’t, so he sat back down and sipped on his coffee.
The brunet daemon rolled her eyes dramatically, “I know, all the people on earth disappeared, so when the Winchesters come, bring them straight to me” she mocked Rowena’s straight posture and elegant voice.
“Dean, Dean, Dean!... Wake up! It’s just a dream. Wake up; it’s ok” Sam held Dean steady, bracing for the swings he expected when Dean finally awoke. Dean startled and looked around frantically as if unsure where he was.
"We need to take Dean with us. I don't think he should be left alone right now" Sam stood up from the table. "I'll go check on him."
Sam set the coffee down on the side table and handed Dean a cup. Dean took the coffee blankly, staring straight ahead as if in shock. After a moment, Dean’s features relaxed slightly, and his eyes met Sam’s. “Thanks, Sammy” Dean managed to rasp out the words.
“Summon her?” Sam looked shocked, “You think we could summon Freyja and have her help us retrieve Cas from the empty?”
Signing, Dean went to the wardrobe. It still smelled like Cas in there. On the suits and ties. Dean took one of the ties and healed it up. The image of Cas being enveloped by the empty flashed back into his mind, and his knuckles went white. He would get Cas back, and when he did, he would never let him go.
Sam smiled “Well then, two down, two to go. Let’s hit the lore and see where we might find some tears of love over land and water, whatever that means.”
Dean reached behind him and picked up his jacket, holding it up for Sam to see. “His blood is here, Sam.” Dean was on his feet in moments, rushing to the War room where the spell bowl lay. “Jack!” Dean called as he ran. “Get ready to meet a new celestial baddie. We’re summoning Freyja. Now!” The hope and anxiety radiated from Dean’s voice as he tipped the spell bowl and wiped it out. Pulling the knife from his pocket, Dean held the handprint over the bowl and began scraping flecks of the dried blood into the bowl. Once there was a small pile in the bottom, Dean seemed satisfied and placed Cas’ tie in the bowl. “Sam, Jack!”.
“Not to interrupt your little squabble here, but we don’t have time for this” Dean’s temper was starting to rise. He wasn’t sure how long he could keep up his swagger when he felt none of what he was projecting. “Where’s Rowena?” The air was sticky, hot, and smelled of char and ash.
“I’m sorry,” Rowena said softly. “I wish I could get your Angel out of there, but I can't. There are very few magics strong enough to rip a soul out of the empty without consequence, and those require ingredients that haven’t existed for millennia, I’m afraid”.
“Then we will find another way, Dean. We always do.” Sam placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder as the lighter fell into the bowl. They all waited with bated breath. Nothing seemed to be happening. Then the bowl started to produce white smoke, which started snaking and curling around the room. It was shining slightly and smelled of sandalwood and honey. Dean looked over at Sam and Jack, each equally perplexed. The smoke formed a sigil in the air, composed of two perpendicular lines crossing in the center, a circle in the center, and semicircular arcs at the end of each of the four lines. It looked like a small circle with four forks sticking out. The sigil began to glow, brighter and brighter until there was a crack, and a sheet of white light came blasting out of a tear in the world. All three men had to shield their eyes and look away, and when they looked back, there she was. Dean was staring at Love herself, the goddess Freyja, and his only hope of reuniting with Cas.
“Well, we know that Cas is in love with Dean and died to protect him, right? He died, protecting what he loved.”
“It means that when two people are bound, they can sense the other's experiences. Like a tug of a thread under their ribcage pulling them to the other, or like, feeling their pain if they are hurt, or joy if they’re happy. It’s like their subconscious minds are connected.” Jack was smiling confidently at Dean as he tapped the book lightly with his index finger. “It says here that in some cases, bound souls can share dreams.”
Sam leaned forward slightly. “So kind of like the dream walkers, who could see into other worlds through their bond with the dream walker in the other world?”
Dean looked around frantically; then it dawned on him as he stared into those blue eyes again. "Why does this feel like a goodbye?"
"Cas made a deal with the empty" Deans voice was soft. Jack shifted slightly. "It's ok; I know he made you promise not to tell me. He knew how pissed I'd be if I knew. "
Rowena looked at him carefully before replying. “Well, I might have known a few witches while I was alive that used to commune with Freyja. None were ever able to summon her though, the ingredients for the spell were too rare”.
“Dean! I can’t stop it, Dean, run.” Cas was pleading; he couldn’t kill Dean again; it was breaking his heart. But Dean didn’t run, didn’t fight back, he just looked confused and hurt as the blade pierced his heart. Castiel wept and wept until Dean’s body vanished, and it all happened again. And again. And again.
Light flashed in her eyes, wicked and cold as she raised a hand and grasped at the space in front of her. Castiel fell to the ground screaming and writhing in pain. “You and your friends made it loud” She closed her hand again prompting fresh shrieks of agony from Castiel. His body contorting at the women’s will.
"Dean, can I come in?" Sam rested his arm against the doorframe of Dean's closed door. "Dean, you haven't eaten all day, come, let's get some food."
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” a daemon asked, her voice drawling with mirth.  She quirked the head of her meat suit to one side, brunet hair set in short spikes.
Dean cleared his throat, pushing his jacket behind him. “Yeah, Sam. I’m just peachy” He shifted slightly, trying to hide his tears. “How is the research going?”
It was Cas, the same Cas as always looking at him from the doorway. “You look terrible,” Cas says, sighing as he enters, looking Dean up and down. Dean was lounging on his bed, hoping he didn’t look as awful as he felt. “You know, it wouldn’t kill you to lie now and again,” Dean responds, avoiding eye contact with his Angel. With his demon-self gone, all his feelings of love and self-loathing were returning. He wasn’t sure when he started loving his Angel like this, but one thing was certain. Cas couldn’t possibly feel the same way, so no-one could know.
Dean just blinked up at Rowena when she finished. “What the hell does that even mean? That there is some cosmic baddie more powerful than chuck, and it just happens that her powers are based on love? How the hell does that help us?”
“Damn it” Dean stood up too quickly, losing his balance and stumbling over the whiskey bottle now lying empty on the floor. The blood rushed from his head, bringing with it the memory of yelling at Sam, and… Dean was going to be sick. He stumbled into the bathroom and held himself over the throne as he emptied the contents of his stomach.
It was Sam that spoke. “That’s why we’re here, Rowena. Cas’ he….The empty took him, and we want to get him back”.
"I want," He let out a shuddering breath as Cas ran a hand through his hair. "I want to suck you off."
His hand met a bottle tucked underneath his spare clothes. He returned to Castiel triumphantly, tossing the bottle beside the fallen angel, who was still laying there in his boxers, patiently waiting despite clearly being as hard as Dean felt.
"Thanks, man, I appreciate it. I'm gonna go grab some grub, probably just pick up a pizza and some beers or something." Sam held his hand out for the impala keys. Dean tossed them to him with half a mind.
"Cas, fuck- c'mere, please. I need a second." Dean wheezed, clambering up onto his elbows, looking down to meet a burning blue gaze accompanied by plush pink lips wrapped around his cock that pinned him in place and stole the air from his lungs. Suddenly, Dean wasn't so sure he truly
"Of course I do, You made an excellent distraction." Cas smiled and while Dean was sure it was a genuine statement, definitely felt the hit to his pride. Maybe he was just getting too old for this shit. Sam snorted at something and walked out. Dean didn't know what, but he didn't want to hit him any less for it.
Cas held the back of Dean's neck steady, tracing the fingers of his right hand down Dean's temple and across his lips. This time, Dean didn't have any reservations about darting his tongue out to meet them. Cas inhaled deeply through his nose and pushed his index and middle fingers into Dean's mouth.
"I'll go get ready," Cas replied in earnest, rising from his seat and chugging the rest of his coffee.
"Nope, no, I'm okay, just a few scrapes. Can't have you wasting your mojo on that... I was just wondering why you didn't, uh, y'know," He tapped two fingers to his forehead and Cas's eyes turned up in a half-smile.
Castiel picked intently through every shirt that would potentially fit, masculine or feminine. Dean's eyes nearly fell out of his head when he saw Cas considering a sheer mesh shirt and he mumbled some excuse about cassettes before wandering off to the tech area.
... It's just, well, you have nice hands, and you kinda marked me... with your very large hand." Dean still wanted to disappear, but Cas didn't seem too bothered.
"I liked the mix you made, do you have any more?" He rummages through the box of tapes, frowning at the album covers and lack of homemade tapes. Dean pulled out his second tape from his jacket's inner pocket and turned it over in his hands.
"Oh... okay." He'd already asked a weird question, probably best not to pry into why Cas always touched him to heal.  He tipped back the rest of his beer and fumbled around for an excuse of some sort to break the silence, but Cas stood first.
.Dean didn't know where this streak of confidence was coming from, and he certainly wasn't complaining. Castiel hadn't had this strong an effect on him since he trapped Dean against the counter in Bobby's kitchen, commanding his respect and threatening to throw him back in the pit with a growl lower than the Impala's engine.
A spark of compulsory defiance lit in the base of Dean's skull and he flipped them so he could sit astride Castiel's lap. 'Control', as it were, was futile as his head spun from Cas's handiwork. Cas's hands slid up the back of Dean's thighs and kneaded gently at his ass.
." Dean managed to get his knees under himself and Cas slicked himself up, working the head of his cock into Dean's fluttering hole. He clutched at Dean's hips and slowly rocked himself in deeper.
"Yep, Absolutely, I'll just... be, uh, out... there." He stammered, jerking a thumb behind him before popping the door and escaping into the chilly night air. He took a minute to lean against Baby's door and dragged his hands down his face, willing down his erection and watching clouds of breath escape his kiss swollen lips in puffs. He opened the trunk to grab the spare tire and the emergency jack before getting to work.
"I'm sorry Dean, Sam hasn't done the laundry yet but these were hanging up. I'll return them tomorrow." He threw his empty backpack into the trunk to be filled later.
The former angel swirled his tongue around the head, licking up a dribble of precum before bobbing his head rhythmically, slowly but surely driving Dean up the wall with a steady hand working over the rest. Dean was ramping up
Dean's face burned. He didn't think he was being obvious about it or anything. Cas was observant, though.
I'm gonna come. Are you almost there?" Dean gasped and reached up to pull Cas down for a vehement kiss when he grunted his confirmation. Dean felt the heat of his release coil deep in his gut and rocked up into Cas with a fervor, moaning heavily into Cas's mouth with each collision of their hips.
"You can move your hands now." Cas hummed and leaned his head back. Dean practically sprung forward, ignoring the ache in his calves as he latched his mouth onto one of the angel's nipples. His hands made quick work of Cas's belt and fly, tugging firmly at his pockets to get them off. When Cas's flushed erection came free, Dean leaned forward to mouth at the head and cup his balls.
Cas sucked in a sharp breath and dropped his forehead to Dean's shoulder, thrusting steadily into his hand before plunging a second finger in. A third followed and Dean was practically fucking himself onto Cas's nimble fingers.
"I think you know that's not true." Castiel hummed, placing the fresh joint between his lips, bringing the flame of his zippo to the end, and inhaling deeply.
That turned out to be a bad idea, as many of Dean's ideas do. Cas was sat in a lawn chair with the tunnel doors cracked, rolling a joint. Dean had pointedly ignored him, turning to rinse the car until Cas spoke up.
"I am not a musician, nor a Rastafarian, Dean. Claire simply pointed out that I think too much, and that cannabis is known to help." He drew in a deep hit and outstretched his arm to Dean, the cigarette balanced between two fingers. Smoke twirled lazily into the air around him.
Dean was dreaming, he had to be. Was this the Angel of the Lord that sat terrified in front of him in a brothel four years ago?
Dean's not a creep. He's not, he swears. It's just that he's... noticing things now that he's not on high alert for monsters anymore.
Thunder rumbled ahead as the two men jogged to the car with the bags from their second trip to the superstore to get more essentials to Cas's daily life. They tossed them in the trunk with the rest and clamored into the front seat as the rain began to fall.
Dean took a guiding step, leading Castiel towards the bed. Castiel cupped the back of his neck and turned them around before shoving Dean down onto the bed with a bounce, the manhandling causing Dean to lick his lips and let out a delirious giggle.
Cas nodded and rinsed off under the water flow. Dean stepped out and grabbed two towels to dry them with.
"I want to fuck you." Cas gasped, leaning into Dean's mouth. Dean nodded and climbed to his feet to get the lube from his nightstand. Cas sat up and wrenched Dean's towel away. His eyes roved Dean's body appreciatively before pulling him down on the bed. "Lie down on your front, please." He purred, and Dean was on his elbows in an instant, handing back the lubrication.
"So, um, I made you this, it's uh, all my favorite Zeppelin songs, y'know, to start you off small. Put it in the tape deck if you want, or there's more in the glovebox if you want to look through them." He glanced away from the road to scan Cas's face. Castiel gave a small smile and fed the tape to the deck in the dashboard. The acoustic guitar accompanied by the soft drumming of
Then the tension in Dean's core snapped, and he was coming without so much as a moment's attention to his dick, clinging to Cas's shoulders with a fucked out whine. Cas kept going and Dean's synapses felt like they were being deep-fried as Castiel's stuttering hips drove him in deeply one, two then a final time as he emptied himself into Dean with a low groan. He then pulled out slowly and rolled off a now depleted Dean to spoon him.
..." Dean begged, rolling his hips into Cas and fitting their cocks together to get a hand around them.
Dean practically fell out of the car and ran to the reception as Cas grabbed their bags. He almost asked for two queens out of habit, but his dick was very helpful in reminding him to get one king. He jogged back out to the car with the key in hand and gave Cas a giddy smile, pointing at their door.
"Y'know Cas, just because Jimbo woke up and put on a trench that morning doesn't mean you have to buy another one." Dean chuckled. Cas considered them for a moment longer before placing one down and putting the other in their cart.
"Well, it wouldn't be the midwest if every decent store wasn't 3 hours away. Closest one's in Lincoln." Sam replied flipping the screen to show the maps page presenting 3 different routes.
Dean pulled it out and held it out to Castiel who placed it in the breast pocket of the borrowed flannel underneath his cardigan. Castiel checked his phone for the weather.
"Sit still, Dean. Let me take care of you." He growled, mouthing kisses from the base of Dean's spine to the cleft of his ass again. He laved his tongue in tantalizing circles, fucking it in and out nimbly and drawing a chorus of breathy sounds from the hunter.
"Let me hear you, Cas," he whispered before kissing him deeply, wrapping his legs around Castiel's waist to encourage him. "Come on, Angel, I wanna feel it tomorrow...
"I want you to put your hands on my knees, and you can't move them unless I say so, is that alright?" Castiel spoke when they parted.
"Of course Dean, you know I always enjoy our time together," Cas replied genuinely. Sam cocked an eyebrow and Dean suddenly found himself very interested in picking at the label of his beer. "I think I'd like to sleep now, I'll see you in the morning." He said before downing the last of his beer and heading off down the stairs to what was currently the guest room.
Dean moved a hand to cover his eyes from the rain, staring down the dark into unbelievably blue eyes. Great. He had been hoping one of the farm boys had come to find him, maybe a passing well-sighted merchant. Now was not the time to be facing a sorcerer who wanted to take him into the north.
Castiel removed his hand, wiping the sweat from Sam’s brow onto his trousers. Pulling his eyes away from the taller man to meet the hunched form of an exhausted Dean. Dean was leaning against the door frame; his armour had been hastily pulled off and sat in a heap by the other bed. Sam’s blood had stained his undershirt red, his hands were no better, the skin itched from the blood between his fingers. Dean knew he had spooked more than just the landlord with his appearance.
‘’Sam is okay. Rest now, we will speak soon.’’ Dean missed the soft feel of the hand on his shoulder as it pulled away, but he did not watch as Castiel left, merely heard the door close behind him. He did as he was told nonetheless, and closed his eyes, letting sleep take him.
Pissed at the infinity of his capture, and bored of the hot sun beating down, Dean headed back toward the cool confines of his room. Maybe he could make a bludgeoning tool out of a bedpost. As he rounded the final corner to his room, quicklight footsteps came up beside him. Dean turned to look at Castiel.
‘’Dean, tell no-one of this.’’ His voice was softer, quiet against the back of Sam’s deep breathing. His eyes bored in Dean’s with an intensity at made Dean hold his breath.
‘'Can’t you just –poof- it  away?’’ Dean flexed his fingers outwards in illustration, finally swallowing the chunk of bread.
Something is his tone or on his face must have conveyed something, as Castiel ran a clean hand through his mused hair fluffing it into worse tufts. He came over to the bed, raking his eyes over the witcher assessing something that Dean couldn’t fathom. He untensed around the soft hand on his shoulder, on the exact spot it had been weeks ago when Cas had saved him from that damn cliff, and felt it push him. He went with the gentle pressure, allowing Castiel to lay him back on the bed. Cas' thumb stroked his shoulder for a slow minute, staring sadly at Dean.
Dean looked at the man, seeing more of what he had seen on their past interactions in him in one sentence, than he had seen in the shell yesterday. The witcher let out a comfortable breath.  He realised after a moment, that he was feeling relief.
‘’And if I want to walk past the gardens?’’ Dean moved his head to the side to keep the king’s gaze, watching a cruel smirk twitch at the corner of his mouth.
Dean and Castiel knew there was another question in there. Witchers did not have family, not of blood, not usually. Many people had taken to demanding to know how and why one family would put two children through the trials. Many more had made their own assumptions. It is why they rarely brought it up to lay folk, it was none of their business. But Castiel did not pry, and Dean sensed that there was no curiosity behind the statement, he wasn’t asking for an explanation, just an acknowledgment to Dean that he knew.
But Dean also knew he didn’t want to think about trying to explain those first few years of his life, how happy he remembered being as if it were yesterday. He didn’t want to think about his mother, or his father, or baby Sammy. He didn’t want to think about a world before monsters. He didn’t want to think about the world after monsters either. He didn’t want to try and explain to a sorcerer of all people how they said witchers didn’t have full feelings, and Dean was sure that was the only reason his feelings hadn’t physically snapped him in half years ago.
Fuck, watching Impala run off had lost him a second of concentration. Enough time for the other man to pull something from his pocket into his hand. What looked like sand spilt through the gaps in the mans clenched fingers. As he chanted, Dean felt his throat close an invisible hand pressed against his throat, holding him still. The pressure increased, and he felt his eyes watering, his body shaking as it tried to fight back. The pain lasted too long, is lungs burning at the loss of air, but finally sweet black dots started forming against his vision. He stared at the other man’s eyes, magic coiled in them, harsh and unforgiving. This was why he hated sorcerers. How had he let himself forget?
Dean contemplated the ridiculousness that humans bring about for a moment before huffing to himself, winding himself further into the gardens.
‘’I understand, I shall leave you be.’’ Castiel stood himself up, wiping his muddied hands on his clothes. He seemed to think for a moment, head tilting to the left, before offering an outstretched hand towards Dean.
‘’I am truly sorry, Dean. Zachariah thought my efforts were unsatisfactory, he thought it best-’’ His voice was even, but the timber was flat and rehearsed. And Dean didn’t care to hear for it.
‘’No offence Cas, I think your boss is right. You did a shit job recruiting me.  I’m not here because of you.’’ Dean wasn’t sure why he was reassuring the an, he told himself it was because the nervousness of Cas was rubbing off on him.
Coming back to the present, he watched Sam’s face some more, waiting for the last of the fear and worry to leave him. When he looked up Castiel had tidied the area; moved the mess of the herbs and placed their armour and bags in a neater pile. He was using a bucket of water to scrub his hands and arms free from blood, soap clenched in his fists. Dean looked between Castiel and Sam, noticing that his brother smelt of chamomile and lavender, the healing paste thickly coating his skin. More evidence that Cas had truly healed his brother.
‘’It’s not a bad idea. I'll ask Sam about it.’’ Dean tried not to feel proud of the soft smile he pulled from Cas.
Dean hated the spear of curiosity that rose within him; a well-to-do boy alone with a Witcher on a dirt path, the village was barely a mile in front.  He looked down the road into the wilderness from whence he had just come, wondering from where the boy had come. Idly, he wondered if he had been waiting for Dean to come back from his hunt. Dean cursed himself for his lack of concentration; a wound in his thigh was still stitching itself together the head of a griffin in the pack on his shoulder. He just wanted to collect his money, drink some ale and go to sleep. It had been a had contract, three days of pulling his body through caves and nests trying to hunt down the beast that had eaten almost four whole unsuspecting victims. Dean had found the bits it hadn’t eaten.
Suddenly, Dean felt a jolt to his stomach like he been punched by a bear, caught off guard he doubled over, lungs expanding to try and pull in air. A second jolt hit his shoulder, pushing him stumbling backward, but Dean had anticipated it enough to brace his body against the force. He growled low in his throat. The man came closer, managing to catch one of his wrists in a glowing manacle with a swift, practiced manoeuvre. Dean jerked his arm away pulling the other manacle hanging with it. He bared his teeth at the man, before lunging forward.
‘’I am not so easy as Castiel.’’ The man smiled as if he knew something Dean didn’t, Dean felt the unease crawl down his spine at the mention of Cas.
Sam groaned in pain underneath the hands, screaming as Dean heard bones snap back together. Sam’s eyes were screwed shut, the noises inhumane. He looked away, waiting for the screams to stop, and when they did he heard Cas pull is brother onto his side, and then the sound of Sam retching. Cas said something or another about venom, asking Dean to help him get Sam onto the horse. They heaved Sam’s limp body over Impala. Dean setting up behind him, attempting to hold his brother steady, Castiel taking Sam’s horse.
Before finally stalking off toward the tree line, Castiel turned, lips pursed.  ‘’I am sorry, for what it’s worth.’’
‘’So you’re the sonofabitch that’s been following my brother.’’ The insult flung out of his mouth as if it were one word, a well-worn phrase. Sam grimaced, head leaning back into the pillow behind him.  the words were slurred and uneven, said through clenched teeth with protective force. ‘’Didn’t you ever learn ‘no’ means ‘no’?’’
He felt the buzz of magic, aware of the portal behind him, but he made no immediate move toward it. Fighting with his body to trust Castiel, he didn’t turn around until he had finished his job of buckling Impala’s saddle bags. Smile already fighting to reach his face he turned.
‘’Take them, you might get a chance to test my theory yet. Just add a bit of water and it should be potent enough.’’
Uriel’s hands were cold as they brushed his, hastily undoing the shackles. Dean pulled his hands in front of him, circling his wrists uncomfortably.
It wasn’t the first time Dean had noticed the tight shoulders, the hunched exhaustion of the man. Now Castiel was closer could smell chamomile and lavender, layered over the spicy crackle of chaos, Dean stopped himself leaning into the scent.
‘’What was it like?’’ The man’s voice was earnest, soft enough that Dean didn’t feel it as a threat.
As if sensing his unease, Castiel made a swift exit, merely giving a quiet, ‘’goodbye, Dean’, before he stepped through, the portal crackling behind him.
The wound up the steep staircase, the afternoon sun beating through long windows, making the temperature spike as they walked through the beams and drop suddenly as they left them. The landing was carpeted with plush rugs, muffling the sound of their shoes, as was the winding hallway Castiel directed him through.
Castiel did not say anything, merely pulling up Sam’s undershirt and carefully smearing white paste over the purpling skin where black veins stretched from his wound. He was rewarded with a guttural grunt, Sam’s shoulders pulling away from the bed as he braced himself. Castiel wiped his hands on an old rag, turning to route around Dean’s bags, scrutinising the glass bottles with squinted eyes.
‘’I thought I had more time, I thought maybe I could warn you, help you block the tracking-tell you and Sam to get as far away-’’ Castiel was talking with his hands, walking the same five paces back and forth in front of his desk, pausing only when Dean interrupted him.
‘’You know what? I don’t care. No.’' Dean cut him off with a short finality, face impassive and shoulders pulled back. He enjoyed the twitch of annoyance on the man’s face, enjoying that his insolence had met its mark.
‘’I usually ask a man to buy me dinner first.’’ Dean’s voice was tight, but he hoped to alleviate some of the tightness in his chest with his usual humour.
‘’You’re right of course,’’ Cas’ voice was soft, reassuring. Dean felt embarrassed about the treatment, before telling himself that he could be a bastard if he wanted to be. The only issue was he didn’t want to be a bastard. Castiel hummed in humour, ‘’Inn keeps might not take kindly to drying out dung in your room.’’
He walked the herb gardens and flower beds in long winding circles, naming the leaves he knew and picking out the location of useful herbs for future security.  He marked the ones that could make effective poison if he came desperate enough to defend himself. He had asked the guards for a sword, even a wooden one so that he could keep his training, they didn’t have the balls to answer him. Dean took their frantic scurrying away as a ‘no’.
‘’Why me?’’ Dean looked into the flickering flames, prodding the lit logs with a twig, eying the flares of red embers it caused. He knew he didn’t need to embellish his question. Castiel made a thoughtful noise in the back of his throat, pulling his legs closer to his chest, fingers laced under his thighs.
‘’Dean, do you mind if I call you Dean?’’ Michael plucked a pastry from the stack, biting into it. ‘’You have a talent, a certain-’’ he paused licking jam and flakes of pastry of his smirk, before continuing, ‘’-a certain skill set is not easy to come by.’’
‘’Yeah? Well neither are you.’’ Dean looked back into the fire, hoping the light would hide the faint blush crawling up his neck.
‘’And who are you?’’ Dean levelled him with a look of resolute fury, making a mental note when the man did less than flinch.
‘’I wondered if you had considered using dry ingredients for the traps, that was you would be less reliant on finding a herbalist mid-hunt. You would just need a bit of water and a way to grind up what you need.’’, he continued, Dean could feel the man’s eyes on him, but he was getting used to the heavy weight of Castiel’s stares and it didn’t bother him so much anymore.
Dean appreciated the attempt at levity, huffing in agreement. Deciding that he must be tired, that he was being ridiculous, Dean stood up and rummaged in his pack. He returned with two pieces of thick salted jerky, passing one to Cas as a soft apology. Castiel thanked him, pulling into the meat with his teeth.
‘’I could ‘poof it away’’ Cas squinted at Dean, taking his usual moment to think through his choice of words, ‘’but, sometimes- I like to remember what it is to be human. There is no better
Dean considered him, and nodded gravely. Words caught in his throat; he didn’t know how to say thank you for this. Castiel swallowed, the sombre expression falling to something more akin to exhaustion.
Damn it, the boy was following him, stupid heeled shoes clicking as he skipped after Dean. His hands were talking with him.
‘’We need to talk’’ His voice was gruff and low as always. Castiel moved over to the corner of the room where a circle table and two armchairs sat. He bundled up the scrolled papers off of one chair and indicated Dean to take a seat.
It was barely even four days later when the next man came. Dean saw him coming this time, a lone figure in finery, walking through the forest toward him. Once again, Dean felt no presence of anyone but this one man; no soldiers eager and waiting in the trees to ambush, no forces to, well, force him.
Stopping himself from a usual sarcastic remark, Dean merely nodded stiffly. When he turned around Castiel was gone.
It wasn’t even a week later that the shadow of Castiel broke free of the trees, the man walking across the clearing toward Dean. The witcher was aware of him, the tension in his shoulders making it obvious who it was, if Dean hadn’t already known. He momentarily put down the pack he was carrying and stopped walking so that the other man might catch up easier.
The sun was high in the afternoon sky, sun beating down, bathing the paving stones in bright white light. The lazy hum of insects filled the air, interrupted only by the occasional chirping song of the birds. Dean had spent most of the morning outside, at the far end of the grounds away from the castle. He still felt like a caged bird, but it was infinitely better than the cold stone confines of his chambers.
A figure emerged from where Castiel had just disappeared in the wood. Dean knew it was Sam, not from the long gangly limbs, but from the sudden quiet in his chest.
He removed the sword from his throat, sensing no threat from the man. Sensing no one but the two of them on the lonely road. His eyes darted quickly down the road, but they merely confirmed his assumptions.
He followed down a twist of hallways and stairs, making a metal note of the journey. They descended into what must have been the antechamber to a great hall, large double doors standing at the south of the room. He could hear music and chatter through the wood, which became ever louder as the guardsmen on either side of him stopped.
He paused long enough to sip his drink, seemingly forming his words carefully, lips twitching minutely as he swallowed.
‘’People are dying, battles are being lost. You have a chance to help, I won’t deny you that it won't be easy, but it would be the lesser evil. It’d be a chance to fight the greater evil-’’
‘’Dean.’’ The tone was a warm warning, but the seriousness did not meet the man’s eyes. And so, Dean merely rolled his eyes at him. He resumed his walk, settling for a friendlier pace, and was not disappointed to find Castiel slotting in perfect synchronicity of his steps. He wondered if Cas had any idea where they were headed, if he had any business of his own in the area, or if he was merely here for his boss’ benefit. Dean supposed that with the ability to magic oneself from place to place, didn’t really matter if you knew where you were or not.
‘’Thanks I guess, but the answer is still ‘no’.’’ Dean’s voice came out hoarse and rough. He wasn’t even sure that Castiel could hear him over the sound of the drumming rain. He grunted as he shifted himself up, rolling onto his knees to get up. It took more energy than he wanted to admit to himself.
Just as he asked the question the door swung open; a new man entered the room. Castiel fought to avoid Dean’s gaze, seemingly pleading with the floor to fall out from underneath him. It only served to make the fire build, he pushed himself up off the mattress, trying to pretend the world didn’t lurch violently as he did so. Dean pushed his feet to the floor, hoping to feel less ambushed.
‘’I would like nothing more than to stay here with you. But I do not want to risk being missed. Sleep well, Dean.’’ There was the usual casual honesty in his voice, igniting a fraction of heat in Dean’s chest. Castiel gave him a small, sad smile, nothing like the ones he had shared earlier.
He was staring hard at Sam, frowning at the too big body on the bed. His stupidly long hair looking too dark against the paleness of his face. He flinched as he felt a soft hand on his arm, his head snapping to the side to meet the earnest blue gaze.
‘’It’s my fault you are here. I am truly sorry, Dean.’’ said Castiel. His eyes were locked onto Dean’s, making him uncomfortable under their weight as he always was. The man was bleeding sincerity, or he was the best actor Dean had come across in a long time. Dean took a moment to listen to the beat of his heart, the strength of his gaze but found no physiological signs of deceit.
He looked almost the same as the last time he had seen him; except this time his clothes were clean and well pressed, his face showed signs of tiredness but his hair wasn’t tufted in uncontrollable strands. Dean could only guess the expression as one of anxiety, and he felt the flare of anger in his gut.
Dean hesitated a moment before using the hand to heave himself standing. The man’s hands were no longer unnaturally hot, the wind and rain having cooled them. But they were soft despite the strength which he had used to haul Dean to his feet. Something in the back of his mind told him to keep holding the man’s hand like a child might hold his mothers, pushing the ridiculous thought away as quickly as it had come, Dean swallowed.  He let go of Castiel, pressing his hand into his side, feeling the warmth of his blood.
‘’I remember.’’ It was a solid statement, the voice he usually used to end a conversation. Castiel hadn’t seemed to pick up on the tone.
Dean knew the rumour mill well enough, having been around for long enough to pick up idle gossip between one tavern and the next.
Silence stretched between the two men. Dean watched Castiel’s fingers fidget with the lip of the box, his nails running in the groove and lifting it momentarily, only to drop it gently a moment later. The sorcerer’s eyebrows were furrowed, but he made no move to speak. After an uncomfortable couple of moments, Dean spoke.
Consciousness felt like swimming through treacle. His sense of space twisted in his stomach, so Dean locked the nausea swelling in his throat with harsh gulps. The smell of lavender and chamomile floated through to his brain, and before he could feel repulsed, he felt safe.
Dean snapped his eyes to the man who had entered. He was tall, dark-skinned and dressed immaculately. The Witcher could hear him clicking his tongue in humoured approval at Castiel’s answers. He sneered at the man before turning his piercing gaze back to Castiel, hoping he could feel the weight of his anger as acutely as he did.
‘’I didn’t want any part of this war either.’’ His voice was soft and rough, his eyes pulling back to the fire as Dean scoffed.
Dean was happy that they managed to fall back into easy conversation, mostly about horses and a little more about different monsters. Castiel, as it seemed, had been reading up on some bits of lore, asking Dean about some of the things he had read. Dean was happy to answer, and surprised to find a few things he hadn’t known, he took a moment to comit them to the back of his head to test out on his next few hunts.
His horse, Impala, was tethered to a branch nearby. The fire was already going, hares cooking over it their sweet aroma accomanying the gentle noises of cracking and popping. Dean was sat sharpening his swords, armour newly cleaned was placed out in the late afternoon sun. And Dean could feel the disruption on the new figure in the air, the hairs on his arm standing up. He took a gamble that the figure was the man that he thought it would be.
‘’Your Grace-’’ He did his best to incline his head politely, and bite back the attitude in his voice.
‘’You can tell them to stick it where the sun don’t shine.’’ He grunted at the man, unsheathing his silver sword and running toward the location of the noise. As expected, the man did not follow.
‘’Don’t be alarmed, these are just to give us some privacy.’’ Castiel’s voice was soft, and before Dean could ask what he was mean to not be alarmed about, the room glowed unearthly blue. Dean felt his breath catch, the spike of adrenaline, as the source of the light dimmed back to invisibility.
"Cas, I-" Dean stuttered, dropping his bottle in the footwell as Cas practically crawled into his lap. Dean almost passed out when Castiel's fingertips brushed along his cheek, causing warmth to flutter underneath his skin.
By early evening it was overcast in Lincoln, the impala pulled into a plaza containing both a thrift store and a superstore, so they entered the thrift store in search of clothes and whatever other gems they may find.
"Oh, it-it's, fine, it looks good-or at least it fits better than Sammy's getup. At least we're the same size..." Dean waved a hand in the air dismissively. There's that weird feeling in his stomach again, except this time it
"We're about an hour out," Dean said, glancing at the route laid out on his phone with a smirk. "I'm sure we'll make better time." He floored the pedal on the bland stretch of highway between them and their destination.
Cas wove a hand into Dean's hair and pulled. Dean moaned around the cock in his mouth, drawing a deep groan from Cas in response. Dean drank in the sound and relaxed his jaw to swallow him down further, bobbing his head rapidly.
He tugged on Castiel's bottom lip with his teeth and reveled in the noise it pulled from his throat. Dean took advantage of the opening to run his tongue along the roof of Cas's mouth, pressing his hips down in sync with the motion. Castiel pushed a hand up the back of Dean's shirt, gripping his shoulderblade as he pistoned his hips back up against Dean's with a surprised gasp.
He remembers the first evidence of Castiel he'd ever seen, an angry burn scar of a handprint. He thought it was a demon's for christ's sake. He hadn't paid mind at the time to the fact that it took up his entire deltoid.
drifted through the stereo speakers and the tape deck popped, Dean eyed the remaining fresh tape and got a spark of inspiration to make another.
"Yeah, sure, I feel like I've been hit by a train, but I gotta admit, it was hot as hell." Dean chuckled, a little manic. He rolled to accept Cas's outstretched hand and stood, shakily. Castiel went to their bags for something to sleep in, and Dean started the shower. He stepped under the hot spray and sighed, reaching for the soap as two arms wrapped around his midsection.
Naturally, he'd joked it off and found his way out of the conversation, acting like it wasn't a bruise to his ego. He had thiusand-yard stared his way through a shower, and now, here he was.
"We've been listening to my mix for hours, Dean. I don't mind. Driver picks the music, and all." Castiel placed the tape in the stereo and well, now it's a moot argument, he guesses. 'I'm sorry Baby, indeed' His outstretched hand clenched back up and landed on the steering wheel. The guitar riff to
Dean clutched at Cas's biceps, only hyperventilating until Castiel bottomed out and bit back another sound. Dean pulled him close enough to share breath when Cas set a moderate rhythm.
Dean hit the wall hard, his breath punched out of him with a grunt. He scrambled to his knees and whipped his head around to see Sam in a similar position nearby. Cas was still standing though now surrounded by three, very pissed-off demons, one of which had Dean's angel blade. Dean attempted to gather himself and help out, but his vision went sideways and he steadied himself against a table, opting to call out the angel's name, stupidly.
Dean yanked the white cotton down his thighs, gawking at the sight he was met with. Castiel's long, thick cock caused his mouth to water and his breath to hitch nervously.
"When was the last time we cleaned our firearms?" Cas asked, swirling his finger through the toppings of his breakfast before popping it in his mouth. Dean set his mug down, a little too hard. Cas gave him a look.
"Do you have an issue with sharing this tape with me, Dean?" He murmured into the gap between them. Dean's breath caught in his throat.
And then Dean was gone with him, arching up off the bed to knot his fingers in Cas's hair and lave his tongue into his mouth as his dick shot spurts of cum all over his stomach and chest. Dean watched as Castiel's hips slowed to a stop and he pulled out gingerly, returning to Dean after licking up the mess on Dean's skin as if it were something he was just inquisitive about. Dean felt his jaw drop open.
Dean fumbled around for the camp lantern tucked under the seat and made for the door, cheeks burning and trying to ignore the frustrating tightness in his jeans. Castiel caught him by the sleeve, causing Dean to meet his intense blue gaze before surging forward to give him a slow parting kiss.
"Yes, Cas." He breathed, and Cas grinned and shrugged off his shirt, tossing it into Dean's desk chair.
He didn't hide his wandering gaze, admiring Castiel's lean muscular physique as he advanced on Dean again. Cas dropped to his knees at the end of the bed, and Dean knew he was fucked.
"What did you mean by personal items, Sam?" Cas asked before gingerly sipping at the foam that had accrued at the top of his bottle. Not that Dean was looking, or anything.
Castiel removed his hand from Dean's drooling dick and trailed his fingertips up the hunter's left arm hesitantly. Dean watched as his hand slotted over the fading handprint on his shoulder with what felt like an electric shock.
"Do you want to stay like this?" Castiel asked, breathless from the hot slide between Dean's grip. Dean shook his head and wobbled his way up to lay back on the pillows, letting his legs fall open, and casting Cas a lecherous gaze. Castiel turned and grabbed Dean by the thighs, yanking him from his half reclined position into a less dignified horizontal one before angling them up and scooting forward to press his straining cock into Dean's hole, sinking into his tight, wet heat.
"Last week you said Vinyl was superior. What is it with you and music forms that take up as much space as possible?" He deadpanned, narrowing his eyes in that younger sibling way that says he's trying to pick Dean's brain apart from afar.
"I don't know what you're talking about." Was his response, innocent and hid behind a sip of coffee. Dean pursed his lips.
"Good. Get comfortable." Dean sat back on his heels and placed his hands on top of Cas's thighs. Cas placed both of his hands on Dean's shoulders, rubbing small circles in the muscle before he slid them upwards to massage the back of Dean's neck. When Dean was staring up at him with hooded eyes and humming his appreciation, Castiel's patience grew thin.
"No! I mean- yeah sure I guess for the variety, but c'mon Sammy, we gotta teach him music the way we learned it! Cassette is superior, everyone knows."
"N-No, Cas I think we're good, knock yourself out..." he rasped as Castiel tightened his grip on the demon's throat, and light burned out from under its skin. Sam and Dean had picked themselves up off the floor by now and made their way to the middle of the room.
Dean made a show of rolling his eyes before coming over to pluck the smoke from Cas's possession. Cas watched him appraisingly as he took a drag, then another, and Dean almost choked when Cas's lips parted for the stream of smoke to travel neatly into his nostrils.
Dean explained the premise and storied behind the songs as they played, and Castiel nodded intently along, asking questions occasionally. Dean pulls into a rest stop to get them snacks while Cas ran inside claiming the need to 'urinate'. Dean tossed the stuff in the front seat and topped off the gas tank.
"Well-No, not exactly it's just that, this tape's made for that purpose, maybe not necessarily sex but fooling around, y'know, like kissing, or a little heavy petting. Typically I'd only share it with someone, uh, special."
In the beginning, there were three truths; nothingness, Death and Love. Each truth was eternal and embodied by a cosmic entity. Nothingness became known as the Shadow or the Empty and was a vast being that was the eternal home where all fallen cosmic beings slept for eternity. Death was the end promised to all that was created and was tasked to collect the cosmic beings and deliver them to the empty. All that is must end, eventually. Love was the essence of life itself, a powerful force that provided purpose to all things. There is no true life without Love. Over the millennia, Love became known by many names, but Freyja was her favourite. Love and Death wished to create balance in the universe, and together they created light and dark creation and destruction. These became known as god and the darkness, and as Chuck and Amara.
‘’Ok, Cas’’ Dean picked his pack back up, settling it comfortably on his shoulder. Castiel watched his expression, a youthful smirk, one usually reserved for Bobby or Sam.
He pulled his eyes away from the man, finally checking his own body. He was clothed, unarmoured in bed, his limbs seemed heavy and unresponsive. He recalled the brown powder, how it had pulled him under darkness. Chaos used against him, a flash of betrayal going through his chest.
Dean nodded, it wasn’t a terrible idea exactly. Yet the non-existent criticism still prodded tenderly at his ego, and that old voice in the back thought it was no surprise that a sorcerer with absolutely no training would be a better witcher than he was.
Dean’s hand had finally found his throat, the fingers rubbing the abused skin. And his reply was more of an incomprehensible grunt than actual words.
‘’Unless you are here to buy me dinner- fuck off, I’m not interested.’’ Dean tried his best to give an arrogant smirk toward the man, pushing the coil of discomfort down. Magic, he hated magic. Too unpredictable, and Dean liked predictable.
Like a spell had been broken, Cas’s footsteps slowed, he looked toward the village and then at Dean. With a small smile, he moved is hand, pulling chaos around. The portal appeared and Dean realised it was the first magic he had seen Castiel perform. His body responded without him, making small steps further away, his fists clenching.
Dean made his teeth clench, swearing through his lips, as the world seemed to close around him. He started to resume his walk; the sun too oppressive, the ground too solid under his feet, his chest too tight.
-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-
‘’No, not nobody.’’ He threw more sticks into the fire, hands looking to snap and fling the wood. ‘’What about your king, the one who tells his men to kill children in their beds? What about all the rulers: wanting more land, more money, more whores? Always wanting more than they deserve? Do they not choose, do they not choose to say they don’t have enough?’’
But there was something he could do that made time pass quickly and in a very pleasant way. Think of Castiel. The Alpha angel.
Holy shit, Castiel! She bellowed, a mixture of admiration and disbelief on her face. "Tell me everything" she almost screamed.
"It’s a meeting where they explain to us how to be better Omegas" Héctor added, seeming very satisfied.
Would they also be saving an Omega from their Alpha? Castiel knew that most of the people who were in place were Alphas, he felt it in their scents and could see it in their attitudes. There were some Betas, but they were more discreet.
It was a lot of information, the story was way different than it had actually  been, and Dean wished he had a notebook to write down what he should and shouldn’t say. But he knew it was impossible.
The first thing was to wait for him on his knees when he came back home. Dean knew that pose very well, it was one of Alastair's favorites. Dean was always waiting for him kneeling on the floor, looking at his hands, near the front door. When Alastair entered he would pick him up by the collar and indicate what he wanted him to do first. Serve dinner, present, or some other activity.
Dean pressed himself closer, he didn't want to show him but he was an Alpha and the alphas rule and the omegas obey. That’s just how it is.
The alpha stopped when he saw that he was not getting a reaction from the Omega. Castiel was anxious to help him but he had no idea how to do it. He didn't know how to break the thread that the Omega had created around him.
"Sorry, please, don't hurt me ..." he begged, but even he could hear how pathetic and weak his own voice sounded.
"Hey Castiel!" she greeted with an animated tone of voice, as was usual for her, but Castiel did not take the trouble to listen to her or to answer her.
He could have talked to Charlie about it, his friend and co-worker, but he knew she would go crazy when he told her that he had rescued an Omega from the street, and in two minutes he would have her in his living room trying to ask Dean questions, something that would not help the situation at all.
The Alpha began to unfasten the belt of his pants, but before he managed it, another man came into the room. Dean heard the door open, but was unsure if the Alpha by his side had stopped. He glanced up to see that the one who had just entered was an Omega, too. He wore a necklace, and a uniform. He seemed to work at the service station.
The entrance hall was not at all warm. On the contrary, somehow the walls seemed to suppress painful memories. Probably from Omegas who were crying for their destinies. Omegas sold, and Omegas who returned to Alphas who did not want, or who suffered at the hands of those who considered them inferior.
Castiel walked away to give him space, but while he was entertaining himself doing other tasks he was aware that the Omega did not sleep at any time. He just followed him with him eyes, without uttering a word.
He spoke monotonously, like he was tired of repeating the same speech over and over, but anyone would have noticed the tint of satisfaction to his voice when he said that the Omega would now be marked, and that he would return to his Alpha, which, clearly, was nothing any escaped Omega wanted.
"Lo calenté de nuevo. ¿Crees que si te acompaño podemos comer juntos?" Preguntó, pero no era una pregunta porque vertió el sabroso líquido en los platos y dejó la olla vacía a un lado, sobre la cama. Luego le sonrió a Dean, como si fuera un niño en su cumpleaños, y comenzó a comer la sopa.
The following days were relatively calm. More of the same. The same Section with the blond-haired and strangely neat and perfect woman, who Dean discovered was called Lady Toni Bevell, a System social worker who took care of the Omegas.
Without much difficulty, since the omega had returned to his unconscious state, he sat him on the toilet and moved to turn on the tap so that the bathtub was filling with water, checking the temperature until he was sure it was correct. Then he approached the omega and removed the blanket with great care not to hurt him. When he tried to take off his shirt, the Omega opened his eyes suddenly and resisted, it was nothing abrupt or forceful, he barely had the strength to remain seated, but even so Castiel stopped, not wanting to scare him more than he already had.
"Charlie, rescue an Omega who ran away from his Alpha and put him in my house in the last three days" he spat suddenly, hard and raw.
"I can ..." He looked up excitedly, but that emotion dissipated immediately, understanding what that meant.
He dropped the shirt down and turned to open the door. Outside the Alpha was waiting for him, leaning against the bathroom wall, and he smiled when Dean appeared.
He didn't realize he was crying until he touched the wet sheet. He wiped away his tears, he was not going to give up. He could still run away, the door was only a few steps away. Maybe he could open it, the key was in the lock, he would just turn it and run away, and maybe the Alpha wouldn't reach him ... but he was still weak, he felt tired and sore. His ribs ached when he took a deep breath and his eye was still swollen.
The two got back in the van and drove away along the dirt road, leaving a cloud of dust. Dean stayed still, unable to believe his luck. Not only had he been spared the call to the System, butthe beta had left him food and water. He quickly unwrapped the sandwich and ate it so fast that he almost couldn’t tell what it was. Chicken, maybe? He knew he shouldn't eat a stranger’s food, it was a risk; but he was so hungry that if he didn’t do something, he would pass out in that place, and that was a worse risk.
"The feet" Dean revealed almost inaudibly, but the Alpha heard him because he was attentive to all his movements and expressions. "They hurt."
It was an Omega with red hair, and very white skin, almost as if he had not seen the sunlight in a long time.
Dean started by tasting the juice. With small sips, he did not want to overdo it. But the truth was that he was afraid of what the Alpha would want in exchange for all that.
Remember that I am not fluent in English, so I beg you to forgive my mistakes and understand if you see many of these, I use the google translator and we all know that it is not very good :/ Any comments, suggestions, wishes, what you want to do, do it! I love it, comments are love <3
He immediately felt Gordon's responding blows as he tried to defend himself. First on the ribs, then on the chin. But Dean was not discouraged, he kept hitting, now anywhere he could.
Hello! I know we are not going through good times now, as a society and as parts of the world that is in serious and delicate problems, but I really hope that from wherever you are reading to me, this chapter will bring you a little distraction and entertainment. It's short, I know, but I'm working on more and I can assure you that things are going to get intense around here. But I am a little scattered to write, there are many things happening. But we will overcome it. Reading and writing are a fundamental part, which always help us.
They were silently uncomfortable for what seemed like an eternity. Dean was waiting for the Alpha to do something, try to grab it, and forcefully claim it until he submitted it ... they were all ugly thoughts that were making Dean feel very bad.
Dean nodded, and after a few more seconds of hesitation he threw back  the covers and sat on the bed.
Castiel stopped, rooted to the spot. He stared at the Omega with his head bowed and his back bent. He was in a posture of obedience.
Dean continued to look around, lost in his thoughts, trying to understand why this alpha treated him so well, in an almost unreal way. He hardly knew him, he didn't know if he was a good Omega, if he deserved to be treated so well. Certainly not, he had fled, the fleeing omegas deserved nothing. He knew that was his destiny if they found him.
"No" he retorted with a sad look. "A friend of my Alpha tried to grab me and I defended myself. I pushed him away, but he said that I had provoked him. My Alpha believed him, and that's why he brought me here. But tomorrow he will come for me," Héctor concluded with some emotion and hope in his voice.
But it didn't seem to be the same way with this alpha. He knew that things were always different with every alpha.
"We can do something with that" Castiel stood up, smiling, suddenly relieved that the Omega had finally communicated with him.
He lowered the intensity of the light so that it was no more than dim, enough to see where he was going, but not to bother him as he slept. After making sure that everything was fine with the Omega, he went to the garage and retrieved his suitcase from the car; he’d left it when he came upstairs with Dean.
Dean nodded, looking up at the Alpha. He had already looked him in the eye today more times than he had looked at Alastair in the twelve years he had lived with him. He knew he was breaking the rules, but they would punish him anyway.
"Maybe for the wrong reasons. Because they are infatuated with an Omega, or because they want to have several Omegas, or to make them work, but they do it." Castiel defended his point.
But he made sure to bring pillows and more blankets, and left them nearby, assuring Dean that he should use them, and this time it didn't matter that it sounded like an order. He wouldn't allow Dean to get cold.
"You had better let go," he said, firmly, his voice rough. Dean had no doubt that the blood in his body stopped circulating at the sound.
He still remembered the man's factions, his features, the lines on his face. How he looked at him with those intense blue eyes. Everything in Castiel seemed to be intense, not just his gaze.
I could still see Dean there, I could still feel his scent and his fear. His eyes appeared every minute, scared, a deep green that left him breathless.
Castiel continued to spread gel over the bruised ribs and he covered some of the other wounds with white cream so that they would heal better. When he finished he helped the omega dress in his clothes, a pair of boxers he didn't wear much, cotton pants and a blue short sleeved shirt.
The manager looked at him for a few seconds, then chose to leave the bottle on the floor, near the Omega.
"Take him home and take care of him. He had a fever, he had some wounds from the other jerk Alpha who hit him ... but also old scars, from his current Alpha. That hits him, hurts him ... and I can't leave him with that man. No may l."
No tenía respuestas, pero tenía miedo, y sabía que si no obedecía, podría ser peor. Entonces, usando toda su fuerza, movió su cuerpo y extendió un brazo hasta que sostuvo la cuchara nuevamente y comenzó a comer la sopa nuevamente.
‘’Fine, I will join your fucking war.’’ The words hurt to grind out. He watched Castiel whip his head up at Dean, dropping the soap into the bucket. His expression moved from shocked to outraged.
Wise to his threat, the boy remained where he was stood. Dean walked away, disappearing over the rise of the hills, as Samandriel’s arms wound round his waist trying to hold himself together.
The hall was large and for lack of a better term guilded. Rich cream and yellow material bunched over long glass windows, rows of wooden tables stretched each side of the room, covered in elaborate stacks of flaky pastries, roasted meats, exotic fruits and carafes of burgundy wine. At the top of the room, two large backed chairs sat against the golden lion banner, lounged a dark-haired man. The man laughed loudly, turning his head to look at Dean with the charm of a predator. His lips were stained wine red. A roaring fireplace and dozens of candelabras flickered golden light across the darkened space, casting dark shadows of snickering nobles.
Uriel, thankfully, paid no mind to the grumble, turning on his heel. His eyes met those of Castiel, who was stood with an arm caught undecided between reaching out and sitting against his chest. The blue eyes blinked and lowered, the outstretched arm going back to his side.
‘’I will leave you be, I see I am not welcome here.’’ He was up, putting the soft leather gloves back on, pulling his cloak around his hunched shoulders. There was no urgency to the movement, just a quiet lethargy. It made Dean almost want to apologise, but he cursed himself for the stupidity of the thought. This man was a threat. He had to remember that this man was a threat.
‘’Dean. How are you?’’ Castiel’s low voice was gruff from the sharp incline up the hill, and Dean wondered idly he hadn’t just portalled himself closer.
‘’Cas!’’ Dean stood up in greeting, he had seen the man approaching for a few minutes, smirking at his attempt to place his soft leathered boots on the steep face of the incline, clutching nearby branches with desperate fingers, to reach Dean’s temporary camp. He was dressed in deep blue cloth, golden suns embroidered on the thick fabric, a smear of dirt across one cheek.
The boy was young, blonde hair piled delicately on his head, his fine clothes shining against the grey dirt on which he lay. The boy gulped, Adam's apple almost catching the steel at his throat.
Dean’s back felt too light without his swords on his back, his fingers itched to pull a non-existent dagger out of his boot and slice the men’s throats. He considered the repercussions of using no weapons to snap one of the guard’s necks as his hands were shackled loosely together behind his back.
The tight coil of fear returned. He was supposed to look after his brother. It was the first thing engrained into him, the only thing that came above his training and all his witcher instincts.
Dean couldn’t say he was surprised at the king’s request. He was surprised the king thought a witcher would be a better assassin than one of his own men, but apparently more willing men had tried, and failed at this particular endeavour.
Lucifer and Michael.  All but brothers in their lineage. The branches of the ancestral tree twisting this way and back between the members of its inclusive royal fruit.  Brought up together, educated together, everything together as was the way of young princes. Not a week would pass between one’s accomplishments, that the other had not mastered it also; hunting, writing, shooting riding. And the competition only continued to grow as they did. The rivalry fuelled by attention and favour. The cousins parted ways as their schooling ended, each with fists clenched and a promise to destroy one another.
‘’Mm, he’s the brains of the family’’ Dean smiled, finally looking back at Cas, sucking in his breath at the blue eyes.
‘’Tell him ‘no’.’' Dean knew his insolence would get him killed eventually, but he could deny the boy, wait it out until the armies came to get him.
Castiel moved through the crowd with ease, his fine blue clothes were reason enough for the paltry locals to unconsciously shift out the way. He arrived at the bar, sitting next to Dean easily.
‘’So aside from an apology’’ Dean let his voice trail off, watching Castiel pull a thick book off the shelf and putting it on the desk. He patted the cover and turned back to Dean.
‘’Dean, will you be alright?’’ Castiel’s head tilted even further to the side, as if he was trying to workout a complex puzzle. Dean knew he wasn’t talking about the hole in his side, the one that was already healing. He felt small for a moment, unsure how to respond to the genuine concern in the other man’s voice.
Dean span around, sword unsheathed in a moment, pressing against the throat of his opponent.  He had been aware of the growing proximity of the man for the past quarter of a mile. He had hoped that the presence would remain further back as they headed toward the small village. He heard the undignified squeak as the man fell in surprise, and it was Dean’s first clue that this man was probably not going to be his demise.
The hunt hadn’t gone quite as he had expected, he had made a fool’s error of assuming farmers had counted the correct number of arachas in their fields. And when the rain came across unexpectedly, he should have called it for the day, waited until the following morn before finishing the job. But coin was low and Dean hadn’t wanted to waste time on arachas of all things. He was cursing himself now, the arachas were dead but it had gotten a bit dicier than he would have personally preferred. The slash the last one left on his side seemed to hum in agreement.
Dean contemplated the man; his shoulders pulled back, his clothes were clean but well worn, his dark hair messed up as if fingers had tousled through it. He didn’t seem like a threat, he looked like a good punch would knock him down for six, but Dean wasn’t going to test that theory on a magic user. No, he was going to get away. Back to humans who hate him and monsters who would hate him if they had the capacity for it. Back to concrete beings that aren’t going to use chaos to twist his will. Back to Sam.
Dean huffed in his effort, considering for a moment just letting go and hoping he survived enough until morning, when the storm would end and he could drag his sorry ass back to the tavern. His fingers twitched around the weeded grass, slowly pulling clumps from the ground.
‘’My job is to kill monsters and get coin, I care not about your glory.’’ Dean cut him off with a sharp bite, beginning to walk away from the boy, heading down the road.
Dean sighed putting the bait down against the tree, rubbing a gloved hand across his face. He wondered if killing the man would send a decent message, but before his thoughts could move to more graphic ideas the stranger was stood before him. Breath caught in his throat, not from the dark hair and tired expression of the man, but at the oceanic eyes boring into him. Magic swirled behind the blue, glowing in quiet intensity, it took a moment for Dean to pull his eyes away.
‘’I’m sorry, Cas. See you around.’’ Castiel did not ask him what he was sorry for and wasn’t sure he knew exactly. It was more a blanket apology. Sorry for asking him to stay. Sorry for making the man‘s life difficult. Sorry for not being able to say ‘yes’. Sorry that he had acted a volatile child all day. Sorry that Castiel had to leave.
Dean nodded, holding the vials in one hand, his fingers curling across the glass noting how it was no longer cold in his grip. Something about the gesture, let his stomach unfurl. He had evidenced their conversations were not entirely baseless. He let out a deep breath, studying Cas, who was still shuffling through the number of tomes on his bookshelf.
Dean blinked his eyes open, the light stabbing into the back of his skull. Dean felt the weight of the mattress shift, then the room became darker, until it was bearable to open his eyes fully. He saw Castiel return to his side, but he did not sit on the bed again. Standing, instead, where Dean could see him.
‘’You are our most esteemed guest here, not a prisoner.’’ Michael continued his slow circling, talking to the room as much as he was to Dean. He used his arms to talk, moving gracefully, but his eyes remained solid and fixed on the Witcher.  ‘’Please, feel free to walk to gardens, ask the servants to bring you any wine or food you would like-anything you might want. Merely ask, and it is yours.’’
Dean nodded his head, pulling his fingers across his stubbled jaw. Tiredness set into him. Finally managing to pull his gaze to the fire softened features of his companion.
‘’What use is one man against an army, Cas?’’ Dean shook his head, and Castiel tilted his head at the sound of the nickname.
He left before Dean could respond. Dean wasn’t even sure he would have responded given the chance. A small part of his brain nagged at him about something, but he was too out of focus to understand the voice’s meaning. Instead he stood, looking at the log where Castiel had been sat, shoulders lowering. The remnants of his outburst ebbing out his stomach.
X-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x
Dean was unable to say when he had fallen to the floor, his mind only able to focus on the inviting blue of the cloudless sky. He didn’t even feel the second manacle being clicked in place.
‘’Is that it?’’ Dean waited a moment, wondering if it was the warmth of the sun or the freedom of the road that made him feel calmer today. The voice in the back of his head telling him he should be reacting to a threat, but the warmth of chamomile and lavender stamped out any real inclinations to act on it.
‘’What the fuck is this, you son of a bitch?’’ He levelled his best glare toward Castiel, trying not to let his bodies sluggish refusal to move bother him. Castiel for what it was worth had the decency to hide his eyes, looking down to the rooms cobbled floor, shoulders pulled into his lithe frame.
King Michael had a stronghold in the North, for many years the Northern Realms held dominion over the land, which was fine by Dean, as long as there were monsters to hunt it didn’t matter whose subjects they ate. As long as they could pay. But Dean wasn’t immune to the rumours, the rumours of cruelty and greed. Yes, he had heard too much of the northern kingdoms to want to be recruited. He learnt many years ago, nothing worthwhile ever came from a King asking for you by name. It wasn’t a trap he was falling into again.
He didn’t have time to wonder if Sam had seen Castiel, before Sam was speaking, jerking his head over his shoulder.
Upon Uriel’s return, Dean heard the vast number of armoured men long before he was advised it was in his best interest to follow politely and of his own volition. Uriel did not appreciate the sneer he got in return.
Uriel’s bark seemed to unstuck any hesitation in the other sorcerer, ho startled, bowing his head before briskly walking away. Dean didn’t have time to listen for receding footsteps, blood still rushing around his ears. His anger was still a hot pit, but his self-preservation had finally kicked in to hold himself back.
‘’Then we are on the same page.’’ Dean did not appreciate the one lost chuckle Michael allowed himself, nor the glint of emotion in the king’s eyes. His voice held strong and uncompromising as steel as he spoke.
An invisible hand wove around Dean’s throat, he felt the familiar sensation of pressure, the uncomfortable ingrained panic flare from the base of his spine. He grunted trying his best to move unresponsive limbs toward his throat as if he could throw off the incorporeal attacker. Dean schooled his breath to try no sputter or choke, wanting to give Uriel no such satisfaction, but harsh gasping breaths still rang out against the stone walls. Uriel watched him suffer for a full two minutes, Dean counting the seconds in his mind. Then a moment later, the pressure was gone.
The man’s voice was rough, like he had spent the last week drinking to himself, his accent reminiscent of the northern dialect.
‘’I am terribly sorry. I-I did not mean to startle you. My name is Samandriel Alfred van Shacken.’’ He paused to bow flamboyantly, nervous smile on his lips. Dean bristled under the formality, no good ever came from a man showing human respect to a witcher.
‘’Walls have ears, Dean.’’ Castiel’s voice was less than a whisper, merely words on breath. He looked sideways to see if Dean’s witcher hearing had caught it.
‘’Everything else, obviously.’' He gave Cas his signature wink, causing Cas to beam a full toothed smile at him.
Hastily the boy pushed himself onto his feet, brushing dust off of his breeches. He plucked his hat off the ground, a stupid feathered thing, and perched it on his head.
He was so close to having failed. So close to losing his brother, if Castiel hadn’t shown up when he had –
He had placed the silver sword to the side, standing up abruptly. His thick boots kicking the earth as he walked away. Castiel did not respond, and Dean felt the words leave his lips to fill the emptiness between them.
careful, Dean.’’ Castiel said, his fingers curling around the door handle. ‘’Michael is not asking what you might think. Keep your wits about you. Now, I will walk you back to your chambers. That dust you inhaled was no half-measure I made it myself for subduing lesser vampires, you should rest.’’
Dean stared at the bottles, looking at the looped writing of the labels. He had made out ‘griffin’, his hand pulling out to hold the vial despite himself. He looked at it. Then picked up the other, ‘basilisk’ it read. Castiel tilted his head at Dean’s curiosity, seemingly unperturbed by his organised mess ebbing played with.
‘’You will bathe and change. You are our guest, witcher, you will do as told.’’ Uriel’s voice held no flexibility, it was hard and rigid.
‘’There is....you must understand, they do not want you knowing this. There is a prophecy-’’ his voice was even, considering.
He stared at Castiel this time; golden green meeting blue. His fingers still worked breaking the last twig into splinters.
‘’You are a small part of it, yes.’' Castiel’s words were careful, in a way that unnerved him, nothing that couldn’t be outright was good news. But Castiel continuing with a soft sigh: ‘’I am told that we need you to win this war once and for all.’'
They settled on the ground, Dean passed Castiel his waterskin, the man took it and drunk gratefully. Despite the cool breeze and overcast weather, Castiel tilted is head to the sky. Dean couldn’t help but think about how feline the gesture was, no matter where they were Castiel seemed to gravitate towards the warm. To distract himself, Dean took a sip of the water too.
The man before him was portly.  He had grey thinning hair, and the usual air of arrogance carried by sorcerers. he was dressed in a similar style to Castiel, but the colours were a dark silver, shimmering in the sun. He had a twisted smile on his lips.
Rain was jolting down toward the earth, unforgivingly bouncing back off the earth into Dean’s face as he grappled with the incline. His biceps burned with the effort of hauling himself up toward the flatter earth. His feet scrambling in the wet soil, purchase points crumbling underneath him. Blood sluggishly pumped from the gash on his side.
‘’For his tab and mine,’’ Castiel nodded at the bar keep, but once the man had left to his other patrons, Castiel turned addressing him sagely. ‘’Take care of yourself, Dean.’’
‘’Ca-Where’s Castiel?’’ Dean’s voice went from light to harsh in a beat, his brows furrowing in threat.
His face was impassive, but he kept walking as Dean slowed, jerking his head to continue walking past the door of his chambers. Dean followed him quietly past the first corner and the next, as they reached the foot of a winding staircase, Dean finally coughed out a querying:
‘’I’m sorry, it isn’t a good enough reason to endanger you, I know. I just, I couldn’t stand the idea of thinking I betrayed you-‘’
He felt the hand before he saw its owner. A searing heat against the ice of the skin on his shoulder. A hand that gripped his shoulder pulling Dean toward him, toward safety, and then a second hand hauling under his other armpit gaining purchase to pull him up. He heard the grunting and the dull thud of the man setting down behind him, breathing slightly laboured. Dean remained where he was enjoying the release of his muscles, giving himself a moment to relish their freedom. Once his  moment was over, it took everything in him to roll onto his back, turning his head to look at his unexpected saviour.
‘’Alright. ‘’ Dean sat, leaning back against the comfortable fabric, eyes trained warily at the door in habit. Castiel placed the scrolls on the desk, before moving back to pick a box off of the other chair, placing it on his lap as he sat.
‘’When would I find time to dry out a whole fucking store cupboard?’’ His voice came out cold, despite knowing he was taking the suggestion too personally.
‘’Lesser, greater, middling, it’s all the same. I can’t say I have only done good in my life, but if I am asked to choose between evils, I prefer not to choose at all.’’ Deans tone had lowered into that octave again, the one that sounds like a bitter warning.
‘’I know where you’re from, and the answer is ‘no’.’' Dean moved away from the man, heading back into the thicket of the trees, lest the Basilisk come for the bait. Castiel, tilted his head at Dean, holding it a moment after his back was turned before following him into the trees.
‘’No, I will not join your war. Now fuck off.’’ Dean made no attempt to move, staring the man down, keeping his eyes locked and cold.
‘’That’s the issue with war isn’t it?’’ Dean felt his shoulders tighten more than he felt the sudden anger flare in his gut, as if his body was responding to an emotion he could barely acknowledge. He found his voice low and bitter despite this. ‘’Nobody gets to choose to be a part.’’
The air stood still, the guards in the hallway stopped breathing, their armoured chests no longer tinkling quietly at the movement. Castiel, now behind Uriel, looked up to assess the men. His fingers twitched at his side, blue eyes darting assessing.
Dean was pulling Sam’s body toward Impala, teeth clenched sputtering comforting nonsense through them at Sam anyway. Even for a witcher, Sam was a lot of dead weight to drag, his moaning was getting quieter and quieter as Dean pulled them through the grass. He heard Cas before he saw him, heard the thundering push of his boots on the ground as he ran. Without asking, Castiel pulled Sam’s other arm around his shoulder helping hoist the limp form. Dean could feel the burning heat of his touch as their arms met across Sam’s back. With the weight shared they made for a faster pace.
‘’I should get back to court. Thank you, Dean.’' Though his still sucked in his breath as he stood, Dean was glad to see that the other man seemed more stable on his feet than when he had arrived.
If he noticed Dean being tense, he didn’t mention it. Choosing instead to turn the spit on which the hares were still cooking. Taking out his own swords and beginning to work them. Dean watched his brother, enjoying the calmness which came with watching him safe.
