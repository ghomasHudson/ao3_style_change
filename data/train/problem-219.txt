“Look…” he began slowly, hoping silently to himself that he’d make sense as he spoke. “We know how he is. He’s a drama queen, he likes to drag things out and make us run around in circles. But you’re SMART, Sherlock. You can figure out what’s he’s going to do, you’ve done it before. He’s not difficult, he’s just arrogant.” Sherlock kept quiet, his expression strangely vacant but John could tell he was still listening nevertheless.
John stared blankly at him, his mind nothing but white noise. He could vaguely feel his heart pounding in his chest, blood rushing through his ears as Sherlock stared back at him, wide eyed and anxious, his chest rising and falling heavily as more tears continued to fall.
He knew what it was like to wake up from a nightmare like that; his your entire body on edge with nerves and his your senses almost heightened, and his your bones ache and there’s a permanent chill to his your body, like you’re never going to stop shaking again. Anything he said to Sherlock would be lost in all of that.
“This is not your fault.” Sherlock huffed again at that, but remained silent nevertheless. John narrowed his eyes slightly before continuing.
He knows that there are certain things he’ll never be able to look at again, certain things that will set off triggers like landmines in his brain and dreams that send him into fits of panic in the middle of the night, gasping for air as if he’s just run a mile nonstop.
“I can’t stand thinking that he might’ve been in that diner, watching us eat, watching us talk and watching…” He let out a shaky breath, his shoulders slumping downward in what seemed like defeat. “Watching Rosie…”
“You mean, like…” He cleared his throat again, blinking. “Like...visit their graves?” Sherlock looked at him almost stupidly, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world, which...yeah, he guesses it was.
John made his way down the hallway, rubbing his eyes tiredly and trying to figure out where he’d left Rosie’s baby monitor.
“Enough of this, I’m ready for someone to die,” he mused in a bored tone, and Sherlock’s stomach churned horribly. “The rules are simple; I’ve got 6 bottles here, 5 of them are poison, one is not. Sherlock…” He held his hand up with the gun, pointing lazily towards him. “...has 60 seconds to pick the one that is good. However, every 10 seconds that goes by without him choosing…” He swung his arm around and pointed it at John’s face. “...I pull the trigger. There’s 1 bullet in this round of 6; let’s hope Johnny boy doesn’t find out which one it is, mmm?”
“Okay, Daddy…” She yawned softly, her eyes fluttering shut almost immediately. She rested her small arms on either side of her head, her face falling to rest on its side. John backed up slowly, careful not to make any noise before tiptoeing from the room, shutting the door behind him.
Sherlock hummed loudly in response, John feeling the mattress move beneath him as he turned off the lights and laid back down.
John found them wandering around Trafalgar Square a couple hours later, a bit bored after finding absolutely nothing helpful. There was too many people around for John to keep up with, but Sherlock had no problem watching them all. When John observed yet another dismayed look on his boyfriend’s face he finally decided to lead them towards a bench on the outskirts of the area, sitting down with a loud sigh.
“Ah, I’ve missed this. I’m sure you have too, Sherlock. Life must be terribly boring without me.” Sherlock’s mind felt like it was overloading; his thick accent was audible in his ears, his breath hot against his face. Nothing about this was fake; he wasn’t dreaming anymore.
“Oh Sherlock, really?” He reached over quickly, slipping his hand into his jacket pocket and quickly removing his gun, quicker than Sherlock could even react. He sighed dramatically, twirling it in his hand while keeping his own aimed at the detective’s forehead. “Predictable. You’re just as ordinary and boring as you were all those years ago on the rooftop.”
John took a deep breath, grimacing at the whiteness of his friend’s knuckles as they refused to let go of their grip on the bedding before opening his mouth.
“Interesting choice...not that I remember which one is which,” he remarked slowly, reaching out and taking it from his hand. John let out another sigh, leaning forward and slumping over the table slightly. Sherlock swallowed thickly, clenching and unclenching his hands at his sides to try and get them to stop shaking, watching as Moriarty held the bottle up to his eyes, looking at it rather uninterestedly before holding it out to John.
The rain kept steadily pouring, still maintaining its loud roaring noise against the concrete, but despite it all Sherlock heard the unmistakable sound of clapping. He lifted his head immediately, blinking through his tears to see Moriarty standing a few feet away, a smug smile on his face as he slow clapped lazily, still holding his gun in one hand.
“Sherlock, you know we haven’t gotten drunk in awhile…” he called out towards the kitchen, where he heard him scoff loudly and turn off the water, walking back towards the living room.
“Hi, Mycroft…” He squinted a bit, watching as he came inside and shut the door behind him. Mycroft twirled his walking stick around in his hand a bit as he surveyed the place, taking in all of the new renovations. John walked over slowly, folding his arms across his chest as he did. “What brings you here so early in the morning?” Mycroft rolled his eyes at John’s slight edge of sarcasm, meeting his gaze.
“Yes well, the last time we did I ended up puking all over the floor of a client’s flat and Lestrade had to bail us out of jail,” he retorted sourly, and John grinned at him, shrugging a bit.
John looked up slowly, blinking a bit as he watched his boyfriend lift their daughter into his lap, bouncing her on his knee as he looked up and met his eyes. “John?” He raised an eyebrow, watching him carefully. “Well? What do you think?”
All Greg could muster up was a sad look on his face, watching quietly as John hailed down a cab. With one arm still wrapped around Rosie, John opened the door to get inside before turning to face him once more.
“He appreciates it deep down.” Sherlock made a face at him as Lestrade smirked, turning towards him. “What are you doing for Christmas? Going to your parent’s again?”
“Babies love everyone,” he retorted, leaning back against the headboard once more as he extended his legs flat against the comforter. John rolled his eyes.
John rolled his eyes and walked over, grabbing a folded towel that was sitting on the edge of their couch as he did. “You know you’re still soaking wet.” He threw the towel towards the detective, fighting back a giggle as it hit him in the face and made him jump.
“As you can imagine, time is of the essence. I’ve given you all of the information I have.” John hummed in response, fidgeting with his pen in his hand as Sherlock nodded once, stroking Rosie’s hair with his hand absentmindedly.
“All of our sugar bowls have eyeballs in them at the moment.” Rosie was holding a large metal spoon in her hands, gazing at herself in the reflection in slight confusion as Sherlock sat down in his chair, reaching his hand out.
“Look, I can send people out right now. It’s not a problem.” Greg seemed much more awake now, his own worry beginning to creep into his voice. John swallowed thickly, his stomach churning at the sheer thought of a police team having to go out and find his boyfriend.
It was weird, seeing Sherlock like this. John listened silently as Sherlock continued sniffling into the fabric of his shirt, any space between the two of them gone in the other’s embrace. He was clinging to John as if he were a lifesaver, seconds away from drowning and John wasn’t sure how to deal with it.
“John…” Sherlock’s voice is soft, almost inaudible, but that could be due to John’s heart still pounding in his ears. It’s like he’s not reacting to how John slapped his hand out of the way at all, and he feels his throat start to constrict at that.
John bit on his bottom lip gently, letting his thoughts trail off. He tilted his head towards the sky, squinting his eyes at the cloud above when he suddenly heard Sherlock’s voice, soft and faint but still audible. John blinked, going still for a moment before taking a slight step back towards him, his speaking coming within complete earshot now.
John looked up suddenly, frowning at the sudden shift of his voice. It was close to cracking, had gone up to a weird octave and sounded dangerously close to crying.
The rest of the night was a blur; tangled sheets and more kisses, bruises on necks and thighs and scratches on shoulder blades and backs. He can still feel Sherlock’s soft curls in between his fingers, can see his eyelids flutter shut and eyelashes cast shadows along his pale face in the moonlight. John recalls the way his chest rose up and down as he inhaled sharp and shaky breaths, his lips pink and shiny and slightly swollen as he opened his mouth to moan, to whimper, to whisper.
John shrugged a bit, watching their silhouettes against the light in the kitchen as Sherlock rummaged around in a cabinet, feeling strangely warm inside. “I know we just got things back to normal again, but he’s loved that little girl since the day she was born and she obviously loves him back too.” He grinned to himself as Molly smiled a bit, shrugging.
John leaned back against his chair, untucking his legs beneath him before tapping his chin, squinting his eyes slightly at Sherlock. He had the opportunity to ask him anything in the entire world, the power to force the truth out of the man who never said a word about his personal life, his past, anything about himself. This was his chance.
“Good,” Moriarty crooned, keeping the gun pressed to his head before tilting his head up, calling out loudly. “Lights!”
Relief washed over him a couple minutes later as the detective’s head came to rest on top of his own, feeling a squeeze back against his hand. John smiled despite everything when he felt Sherlock’s lips press against his temple, his breath warm against his face.
“Sherlock?” He knelt down beside him, watching as he covered his mouth with both of his hands, still coughing loudly. “Hey, just breathe…” He reached out tentatively to touch his arm, jumping back slightly as Sherlock slid off of the chair and onto the hardwood floor, his knees falling heavily against it.
Moriarty turned his head slightly and spit out a mouthful of blood, reaching up to wipe at his face. His nose was freely bleeding, his lip busted open and a nice bruise forming around his left eye. His eyes flickered back to Sherlock’s face, and a small, sinister smile spread across his mouth.
“Whatever you say, John. Now listen, I’m going to go in there and talk to him for a couple minutes, and you’ll stay back here and call me in. Then I’ll ask him to hold Rosie and pass her over and he’ll have no choice but to take her while I run back here. Then we can watch him suffer from the safety of the hallway.”
“Money’s on the shelf above the fireplace,” John called out lazily before shutting the door, smiling to himself when he heard the front door close and Sherlock’s heavy footsteps take off down the stairs.
An hour and a half later found them both on a train en route to Brighton, where his parents had resided and been buried at several years ago. Sherlock had returned from the shop with actual groceries and nothing else, which John found strange but remained quiet about nonetheless. The ride itself was only an hour, and although John was used to Sherlock’s usual silence it still struck him as unnerving that he did nothing but stare out the window the entire time. John leaned glumly against his seat, watching the rolling hills around them eventually even out and lead to the flat lands of the beach.
Sherlock closed his eyes pitifully, tears sliding and dripping their way off of his nose and cheeks as he tilted his head down, breaking eye contact.
John shrugged slightly, shifting on his feet. “You don’t panic when you’re with her. She helps calm you down.” Sherlock blinked, nodding slowly before looking down at the still sleeping infant, pushing a lock of her hair out of her face. John could tell his panic was subsiding away; his motions were more soft and gentle, his breathing had slowed down some. He simply watched them for a minute, crossing his arms over his chest in some sort of attempt to hide his nervousness.
“I know what I saw on that rooftop, and it was inexplicably M-...” He frowned a bit, swallowing thickly before refraining from using his name. “...inexplicably his suicide. But things can be faked...we know this.” He scanned John’s face incredulously for a moment before looking back up at nothing, sighing shakily. “John...I can’t stand this.”
“Ah, I’m sorry bug...celebration dinner will have to be postponed again…” Rosie was unaffected by his words, instead reaching out and pressing her hands against the cool glass in order to see better. Sherlock tilted his body awkwardly to somewhat face John as he walked into the room, shutting the door. “Why doesn’t London want us going out?”
“You are going to sleep this off, and we will discuss this in the morning,” he remarked bluntly, his voice far too calm to show how angry he actually was. Sherlock Holmes was an absolute dick for doing this to him, for going out and breaking his streak of being sober and then coming to him and crying and it just...it wasn’t fair, and John knew this. He did.
It was a normal week; well, as normal as it could be in the lives of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
“Sherlock Holmes, I swear to God…” John immediately pushed himself up to sit on his knees, reaching up and yanking his arms from his head quickly. “Shut up, okay? Just shut up for a minute.”
“Stop talking,” was all he managed out, and he found himself pushing himself up to stand off the floor, one arm already hooking its way around the detective’s waist. “Let’s get you to bed…”
“Yes, I’m doing better.” John smiled a bit before he heard the all-too familiar noise of Rosie crying from her room upstairs.
The warm London air hit him like a train as soon as he stepped out of the doors, humid and muggy from the rain that had just passed. He looked around wildly, trying to spot his boyfriend’s mop of dark curls as Rosie clung onto his shirt with her hand, silent.
Sherlock came back quickly and shut the door behind him, making a beeline for his chair. Rosie was still a bit sleepy looking, her eyes half-lidded as he set her down beside him in his chair. She leaned against the back of the it, waiting as Sherlock pulled out her pacifier from his pocket, popping it in her mouth before turning towards the client.
“It’s just water!” he huffed loudly, grabbing it nevertheless and wiping his face off with one hand, handing John his phone with the other. John smiled fondly, taking it and falling to sit in his seat, glancing over at Rosie before back to Sherlock, admiring the way he dried himself off like a child. He shook his hair out a bit before running the blue towel over it, wiping it across his neck chest. He dropped the towel in his lap and shrugged off his jacket, his dark purple button up sticking to his skin like paint. John was pretty sure he would’ve sat there admiring him forever had he not been interrupted by Sherlock’s loud, slightly agitated voice.
Sherlock swallowed thickly, staring fixedly at a spot on one of the arena walls opposite him. Moriarty’s gaze seemed to be boring holes into the side of his skull because, yes, of course he’d figured it out.
Lestrade eyed him carefully for a moment, looking more weary than anything, as he expected nothing less from him, before he turned to John. “Well, what about your parents? I’m sure they’d love to meet his incredibly kind guy you’re dating.” John grinned, nodding in agreement.
“Greg...have you heard from Sherlock?” He tried desperately to keep the hysteria from his voice but apparently it came through anyway, as he heard Greg stir on the other line, his voice suddenly becoming very much awake.
“Okay Daddy!” As soon as her feet touched the pavement she was running off, already giggling excitedly at the prospect of playing with other kids.
“Molly, stay for a bit? I made tea, and I’m pretty sure it’s awful, but you can pretend to like it for a bit, hm?” Molly grinned at that, scrunching her nose up a bit fondly as she turned to face him.
“Oh yes, and it’s so tragic and heartbreaking and the audience cries because it’s just not fair!” He suddenly turned and zoned in on Sherlock, locking eyes with him. “Life isn’t fair though, is it Sherlock?” He smirked, seeming to enjoy the way Sherlock stared uneasily back at him. Moriarty waved his gun around absentmindedly in his direction, turning and walking back towards the table. “Come here. Now.”
Sherlock felt his hackles rise at the sound of his older brother’s smug voice, biting his tongue for the sake of the toddler in his lap.
“What? What is it?” He stood up straight, shooting him a concerned look and stepping forward as John merely shook his head slowly, placing his hands back in his pockets.
He grinned, listening as Sherlock called back. “Be right there, John!” He heard a slight exchange of words before Sherlock’s heavy footsteps came down the hall, rushing into the room before he started laughing.
“Dragging Rosie into this is just him trying to set you off. You and I both know that she’s never out of our sights, there’s no way he can get to her. I’m sure your brother will bump up the security around here for us if you just ask.” Sherlock hummed at that, tilting his head down to look at their hands before replying.
Rachel tapped her pen delicately against the paper, staying quiet for a moment before speaking again.
It took him awhile to fall back asleep. He hadn’t been able to remember much of the dream at all, save for one thing that kept bouncing around his mind as he watched his boyfriend snore, running his fingertips along the top of his pale arm.
He kissed with a certain sense of uncertainty, yet at the same time John could swear he’d been doing this for years. It was deep, just like he was, full of pushed down feeling and emotions and it felt like a tsunami hitting at him all at once. He barely recognized his own hands moving upward to grab ahold of his waist, the thin fabric of his shirt rustling against his fingertips as he gripped onto it. Sherlock merely hummed in response, tilting John downward ever so slightly to deepen the kiss.
John pursed his lips slightly, staring him down for a moment before nodding once. “How dramatic of him,” he replied smoothly.
“You’re sure?” Of course he was fucking sure, Sherlock thought bitterly. There wasn’t any mistaking Jim Moriarty’s presence on a camera, especially not on Mycroft’s part. Sherlock found himself standing up quickly, listening as Mycroft sighed on the other end of the line.
“You will never go back there, I swear to God, Sherlock…” He rubbed his back probably a bit too harshly, but he was on edge again. He wanted to reassure his best friend that he would never have to relive that nightmare, never have to step foot on that hellhole island again.
“April 23rd…” He furrowed his eyebrows, looking up towards the now soaked man that was seething in front of him. “What’s important about April 23rd?”
John narrowed his eyes a bit, Sherlock’s face remaining nonchalant until he started moving, smiling happily as he listened. “Thank you.”
“John! Did I give you and Sherlock your scarves?!” she exclaimed loudly, and John grinned despite her having asked the same question just a few minutes earlier.
“John, Sherlock! Get a picture with Rosie!” Her high chair was sitting in front of the fireplace in full view for everyone, and John smiled and nodded, going to her left side. Sherlock followed suit and went to her right, where Rosie began impatiently reaching up for him.
“That may be so, but I think it’s just because she loves you.” Sherlock’s face turned a darker shade of pink and John was smirking now, balancing Rosie on his hip as he watched his boyfriend fidget with the spoon and empty jar in his hands.
“Can I see him?” he asked calmly, watching Moriarty shake out his umbrella before pulling it back in. It wasn’t the wisest thing to ask; really, he’d be better off keeping his mouth shut altogether, but Sherlock could feel the panic beginning to settle in his stomach, his hands shaking slightly in their pockets. Moriarty looked up towards him, meeting his eyes with a slight smile, setting his umbrella down in a chair beside his leg.
“Sherlock’s not haunted, no.” It was his turn to fidget now, messing with a loose string on his pants.
“How much do you love me?” John nearly cut him off and Sherlock released a breathy sigh, closing his eyes momentarily.
“I’ve been working on breaking the habit. My apologies, John.” Amazing. John hadn’t even realized he’d glanced down at the pen when she clicked it. He fell silent, watching quietly as Rachel set her journal down, closing it carefully before crossing her legs, the fabric of her baby blue skirt pulling tightly across her thighs as she sat up. Her nails were perfectly manicured, although her ruffled floral shirt seemed a bit too big for her small frame. She’d been tugging on it all afternoon, the sleeves always wanting to fall off her shoulders, but she had suddenly gained an air of seriousness. Her hands rested delicately against her thighs, and John caught glimpse of a wedding band on her finger.
Since then, John had been able to get away with kisses here or there, never in public but that was okay. However, Sherlock had never been one to start them. It was a sort of silent agreement between them; John ran the show in their relationship, and Sherlock took care of everything else. It had been...well, it was fine. Not great, but fine. He loved him enough to move on.
“Please don’t name it something completely stupid like ‘The Candy Cane Killer’,” he mused, and John smiled, meeting his eyes.
He could see Sherlock’s back facing him, rummaging around for something before standing up suddenly, holding a particular grey scarf in his hands, humming happily before tying it around his neck, already fully dressed and in his coat as he turned towards the bed, blinking in surprise at John.
“Poison,” he responded coolly, his face unreadable until his eyes fell back to the table, a slow look of realization dawning upon his face. Sherlock blinked rapidly, trying to keep his heartrate down as Moriarty smiled in response, turning the gun away to face Sherlock once more.
Now John sat at his chair, staring blankly at his laptop screen on his thighs, his head resting on his palm as he kept glancing up at Sherlock across from him, his long legs pulled up on the couch, his body wrapped in his dark blue robe. He was staring down at the cup of tea in his hands that Mrs. Hudson had brought them both earlier, running his fingertip along the edge of the handle.
Sherlock merely shrugged a bit, finishing with his scarf and dropping his hands. “I’ve got to run to the shop and pick up a few things beforehand. You know...since it’ll be closed tomorrow and we don’t want to be stuck without...things.”
“Poison!” he repeated gleefully, taking a step forward. “Such a boring way to die, boring way to kill yourself.” He tilted his head to the side, pouting his mouth slightly. “You would know, wouldn’t you, Sherlock?”
“It’s so simple, mmm? Not everything has to be so clever, you know.” He dropped his hands suddenly, taking a step forward and getting directly into his face again. “You’re not as clever as you think,” he murmured darkly, dropping his smile for a moment before inhaling sharply and bringing it back, humming loudly.
“I know you didn’t, but...you have that look on your face. The one that means you don’t believe it.” John tried his best to ignore the way his chest suddenly ached, taking in his boyfriend’s slouched profile and somber tone.
It wasn’t like they didn’t see each other a lot; Sherlock adored her and helped out as much as Molly did, probably even more. He sat her down gently on his hip and Rosie grinned happily up at him, playing with one of his shirt buttons contentedly as he looked sheepishly up at John, making eye contact.
“Still...out. I’m sure you saw what happened, all over the news.” Mrs. Hudson merely hummed in response, her frown seeming to deepen slightly. John crossed the room, fidgeting with the bottom of his shirt before taking a seat on the couch, leaning back against the pillows. For a moment, a tense sort of silence filled the room. John could feel the landlady’s eyes resting upon him, as if urging him to elaborate on the subject, but he kept his mouth shut. He stared absentmindedly at a spot on the floor, scuff marks from shoes covering the wood, and tried to get Sherlock’s voice to stop bouncing around in his head. It had started to rain outside because, of course, why wouldn’t it? He lifted his head up and met Mrs. Hudson’s eyes, giving her what he hoped was a reassuring smile.
She pursed her lips slightly and set her pen down on the table in front of them; John felt his face flush in embarrassment and she cracked a grin, shaking her head.
Sherlock sniffled again, his eyes still fogged over as he lifted his head and blinked at his partner in response, looking dazed but nonetheless following suit. He stumbled and nearly fell on his way up, had he not grabbed onto John’s waist to save himself. The trip down the hall to the bedroom seemed agonizingly slow, with Sherlock seeming to barely remember how to walk, but soon enough John was depositing him in bed.
“God, yes John! Every morning I wake up and I look over at you and I wonder, how is it that I came across this man who somehow, in some bewildering and unfathomable way, decided to be my friend and then wanted to date me? How is it that John Hamish Watson, the most kind and caring man I’ve ever known, decided it was me he wanted to spend his days and nights with, me who he wanted to walk around holding hands with in public?” His words were falling out with the speed of a river about to flood over, tumbling over his lips in a frenzy and John was frozen in place.
John could feel Sherlock stiffen up nervously behind him as they stood on the sidewalk, and John immediately grabbed for his hand, squeezing it tightly before leading them through the crowd and to the front door. He quickly unlocked and pushed it open, the sound of the cameras going off speeding up rapidly and the shouting getting louder.
John gently slid his hand from Sherlock’s dark curls and down his neck, beginning to rub up and down his back gently. His stomach lurched as his fingertips made contact with his bony spine, not wanting to think about how much weight he’d lost in the last week alone. He swallowed thickly, taking a deep breath before turning his head slightly, mumbling into Sherlock’s hair.
Moriarty made a loud gagging noise then, Sherlock falling silent as he felt John tense up in his arms, listening to loud footsteps begin to approach him from behind.
“I didn’t know I was required to wear clothes in my own flat, brother!” John groaned at their bickering, but Rosie found it quite funny, giggling to herself as they got back downstairs. Mycroft was standing by the window and typing something on his phone, not paying any attention as they walked in. John peered into the hallway and saw Sherlock’s white sheet disappear into their bedroom before walking down and into the room.
Sherlock trailed slowly behind him, his heavy footsteps and the occasional rustle of cellophane the only thing John heard on the way over. There was no one else here, really it was a morbid place for someone to be on Christmas Eve, but he figured more would be here tomorrow.
“Mmm…” John watched him yawn, giving him a sheepish smile as he slowly blinked open his blue eyes, lifting his head back up.
He blanched for a moment, his entire body stiffening up. Rachel merely watched him, still fidgeting with her pen in her hands. John flickered his eyes back up to meet hers again quickly, before giving a slow shake of his head.
“I still need to tell her goodnight.” He sounded almost insulted, as if it were appalling to think that he could actually go without giving his daughter a kiss goodnight. John laughed softly, reaching over and sliding a wet hand around his boyfriend’s neck and pulled him close, pressing a gentle kiss to his lips before pulling away slightly.
“I haven’t thought what through?” he asked loudly, over the rustling of plastic. John blinked in slight annoyance at the ceiling for a moment, before walking over and taking the bag from him, tying it shut.
John had never particularly enjoyed going to therapy. It wasn’t a fun thing; he’d always looked at it as a sort of scarlet letter, another attempt to fix his mess of a psyche that never ended up going as planned. But he’d been seeing Rachel for nearly a year now and after the first month he’d found himself somewhat looking forward to his Tuesday afternoon sessions.
The simple things he did were now fascinating to John; the way he put his coat on, and the way he scrolled through his phone with his index finger instead of this thumb sometimes. John was also embarrassed at the way his mind wandered now; Sherlock had an uncanny habit of spreading his legs when he sat in his chair at times and of course, had no idea he even did it. John had to turn away on many occasions while they were working on the flat, praying to God that Mrs. Hudson just would leave them be for a little bit.
“They kill themselves,” he replied simply, getting another loud cackle on Moriarty’s part, and Sherlock watched as he opened the bag, dumping out its contents onto the table.
John blinked a bit stupidly at him, shifting around in his chair as he brought his hands back up into his lap. He kept his mouth shut, letting Sherlock’s blue eyes pierce into his for a few moments more, before he cleared his throat and dropped his hands from his mouth.
Another high pitched note, and Sherlock’s frown deepened as he tilted his head down, his foot brushing up against Rosie’s baby monitor.
Mrs. Hudson immediately gasped, crossing over from her spot in the hallway where she’d been cleaning. “John Watson, what did I say about keeping an umbrella in the car?!” John shook his hair out and gave her a sheepish smile, Rosie quickly imitating her dad and shaking her head around randomly.
“I’m assuming things are going well at home?” Rachel’s voice somehow managed to cut through the sheer chaos of the office John was in. His arm quickly caught Rosie as she attempted to free fall from his lap and she let out a shrill giggle in return, blinking up at her father with large brown eyes.
“Meet me th-” He stopped short, mouth slightly agape at the now empty space in front of him. He scanned the crowds of people in front of him for Sherlock’s dark curls but couldn’t find him at all; it was like he’d disappeared into thin air.
It wasn’t something you casually brought up; hey, by the way, I attempted suicide many times growing up and even after I grew up. He’d tried everything in the book at least once, including varying amounts of poison. It never worked; Mycroft always got him to the ER to get his stomach pumped in time.
Sherlock refrained from looking in John’s direction at all; he didn’t want to see his face. He kept his mouth shut, jaw still clenched tightly as he wiped any and all emotion from his face, refusing to let him see what was going on inside his head. Moriarty rolled his eyes in response, turning back to his table.
“You raised such a wonderful son. I don’t know how he came into my life or why he ever decided to stay with me, but I just wanted to thank you for him. He’s the best person I’ve ever met, and...well, he makes me proud to be Sherlock Holmes. I’d never felt that before I met him.”
Sherlock released a heavy breath then, his body still remaining tense and rigid. He nodded once, staring intently into John’s eyes. His eyes were red rimmed and his cheeks shiny with tear stains, scanning his face carefully and slowly.
He was right, of course. It was the worst feeling in the world; thinking your loved ones weren’t safe. He opened and closed his mouth once, letting out a soft sigh before gently lifting Rosie off of his hip, holding her out towards his boyfriend.
“I don’t know, asshole! Figure it out yourself!” Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly, watching as the man lifted up his wrist to look at his watch, sighing loudly. “For God’s sake, I’m late to the Shakespeare festival…” Sherlock immediately froze up, watching the man turn and begin to stride away before his senses caught back up with him and he ran ahead to catch up.
“John?” His voice was groggy and full of sleep and suddenly John’s stomach plummeted somewhere towards the bottom of his shoes. He wasn’t at the scene any more.
“Only you, John Watson…” he mused quietly, sliding his thumb lazily across his knuckles for a moment before yawning. “No offense, but if you’re little episode is over I’d like to go back to bed.”
It was a lot for John to process, at least emotionally. He thought about where he’d been a year ago, who he’d been with and the memory of Mary was still fresh enough to hurt him. He saw more of her in Rosie every single day, and he vaguely wondered what they would be doing to celebrate if she was still alive today.
Moriarty reached down with one hand, pulling out his phone and swiping his thumb across it lazily, pulling up a timer. He set it down on the top of the wooden table, already set for 60 seconds and grinned childishly up at Sherlock. “Ready to show us how clever you really are?” he asked innocently, raising his gun once more and pressing it to rest against John’s temple.
“Well, yes, some people might remember you in that way.” He pulled his hand back into his lap, staring fixedly at nothing in particular. “I, for one, will remember you as the man who single handedly changed my life for the better.”
“...I hope that was okay,” he finally managed out, and John swore he was floating at this point, his heart ready to burst from his ribcage at any moment.
There was an odd bit of silence for a moment, all of them seeming to realize that the last time they’d been sat like this had been when Eurus’ bomb had shown up. Mycroft cleared his throat and broke the uneasiness after a moment, going straight into conversation.
“There you two are! I thought you’d gone out of town for Christmas without telling me!” John smiled as Sherlock hung his coat, still dripping a bit from the rain before turning to face her.
The quote...it had been Shakespeare. From a well known play too, not one of his Henry’s or something looked over. Romeo and Juliet.
He was out of bed in a split second; he ran towards his door and had his hand on the knob before a horrible, guttural scream echoed amongst the house, shaking him to the very core and sending goosebumps throughout his entire body.
“Cameras!” Of course; Mycroft had access to all of the cameras in the city, especially the ones surrounding his little brother’s flat. Whipping around, Sherlock tilted his head up to look at the camera he knew was there and faltered immediately.
The day after Rosie turned 11 months old, Mycroft showed up to Baker Street that morning. He hadn’t bothered to call in advance, as far as John knew, and was knocking loudly on their door around 8 am. John groaned and shoved a foot into Sherlock’s side to get him up but he merely grunted in response, wrapping himself tighter in the sheets.
“Are you going out to find him, Sherlock?!” Sherlock let out an audible groan, reluctantly stopping in his tracks. He turned towards the landlady, scanning her worried face for a moment.
He made his way back upstairs to their flat and walked in, Sherlock already setting their wine glasses in the sink, looking a bit disdained.
Sherlock’s mouth seemed to be made for his; it molded against John’s perfectly as his hands immediately grabbed onto his waist, pulling him effortlessly into his lap. John followed his lead quickly, his legs sliding their way to either side of Sherlock’s hips and wrapping themselves around his lower back. He deepened the kiss even further, his arms snaking their way around his neck so that Sherlock was arching over him, clutching his side and back.
Rachel chewed on her lip carefully for a moment, as if taking the time to choose her words before she spoke again.
“John…” There was a faint rustling on the other end of the line, as if he were sitting up in bed and John felt bile begin to build up in his throat. He squeezed his eyes shut, inhaling a deep breath before clearing his throat slightly.
The door swung open heavily, colliding with the wall behind it and Sherlock was greeted with Rosie’s distraught looking face, her cheeks shiny with tears and her little hands gripping the edges of her crib. She let out another cry when the door opened, bouncing rapidly on her legs.
There was a sudden, blood curdling scream directly behind their bench, and they whipped their heads around instantly, as did majority of the people there. John craned his neck, peering over the tops of heads to see as they both stood up. He saw a sudden lurch in the crowd, all of them gravitating towards a large building on the left. Sherlock stepped forward immediately, already weaving himself in between people before calling back behind him.
“I’m sure they would. But they can’t, they died a few years ago.” An odd sort of silence filled the space then, Lestrade looking at him in horror and Sherlock seeming to look up momentarily from his phone before looking back down.
His mind wandered off and he didn’t realise Sherlock had reentered the room a few minutes later until his voice broke the silence.
They had seen a lot of shit together, most of it pretty fucking bad. He figured that, at least at some point, Sherlock had to have suffered some sort of breakdown. The entire world seemed like it was set out to get him, sometimes.
John shook his head quickly, immediately reaching over and sliding his fingers in between his. “Sherlock, stop. I’ve told you this before, you don’t need to apolog-”
“Sorry…” he managed out, and Sherlock snorted into his scarf before turning to face them, trying his best to look stoic but chewing on his lip nevertheless.
“Of course, Mycroft. I’m not a monster; I have a heart.” John eyed the two of them for a moment, watching Mycroft’s expression go from surprise to a weary smile.
“Drink this, it’ll start flushing the drugs out of your system…” John’s stomach churned at the way his boyfriend’s hands shook as Sherlock reached out and took it, slowly pulling it back to rest in his lap. John sucked in a deep breath, finally making eye contact with him again. “Please, Sherlock.”
An hour later found himself lying in his large king sized bed, staring blankly at the ceiling above him. He still hadn’t quite gotten used to sleeping alone; it was weird sleeping in the middle of the mattress. Every time he tried, he found himself scooting to the left of the bed once more.
When his breathing evened out, John immediately closed his eyes and rested his cheek on top of his hair, and sleep took him instantly.
Sherlock sighed in response, the noise getting lost in the blankets but John could feel his back rise and fall as he breathed. “I can’t help it,” he said shortly, bringing his hands up to his face to rub his eyes tiredly. “I can’t help any of this, that’s the problem.”
“Join me? I know it must be annoying, being all wet like that.” He winked playfully at him, and Sherlock really felt sick now. He saw the guard shift a bit in his spot, moving slightly so that Sherlock had full access to walk towards Moriarty. For a moment, the two men simply stared at one another, their eyes daring to speak what their mouths wouldn’t.
“I didn’t know they were that close?” She sounded more amazed than anything, and she had a right to be. It was a strange sight, seeing Sherlock Holmes toting a baby around on his hip in 221B like it was the most normal thing in the world.
“Mark your calendars. I knew something before Sherlock Holmes did.” Relief washed over him as Sherlock cracked a small grin, dimples forming in his cheeks as he tilted his head down, looking at their hands.
Sherlock clenched his teeth together, feeling like he’d just been punched in the stomach. He squeezed his eyes shut, forcing himself to steady his breathing as Moriarty’s voice echoed out amongst the arena theatre once more.
The noise got louder, suddenly taking on a higher pitch. His head pounding, Sherlock swung his legs off the side of the bed, fighting back the urge to vomit as he swayed involuntarily, his socked feet slipping slightly on the wooden floor.
“Shakespeare Festival, Southwark.” The cabbie merely gave him a strange look before nodding and taking off. Sherlock pulled out his phone with fumbling fingers; he blamed it on how wet his hands were, but in reality it was from the slight shaking that had begun to take over. He typed out a quick message to his brother, swallowing thickly before setting his phone down in his lap, gazing out the window.
“I know that was hard for you to say,” he started, and Sherlock let out a shaky breath, closing his eyes and nodding quickly.
“How many times have I convinced you to take a case that turned out to be amazing?” Sherlock stared pointedly at the sky in a childish sort of way, refusing to meet his eyes.
“Will you stop saying that?! For God’s sake, Sherlock, WHY doesn’t it concern me?!” Sherlock seemed startled at his sudden change in tone; he winced slightly, meeting John’s gaze once more with a furrowed brow as John barrelled on.
“Thank you, John…” he murmured softly, and for once his voice sounded genuine. John was very thankful.
He crossed his arms over his chest, staring ahead blankly at the rows of houses in front of him. Sherlock Holmes was talking to his dead parents, the same Sherlock Holmes who had an aneurysm every time a client came and spoke about ghosts and spirits talking to them and kicked them out of their flat. How was it that he was comfortable having a conversation with...well, with dead people? With cold, marble gravestones?
“It’s not the yelling part. It’s the way he yelled at me. I’ve never seen him like that before.” And it was true. When Sherlock yelled (which was pretty often), it was due to frustration or annoyance, not so much anger. When he and John argued, it was always over something pretty meaningless, something that didn’t matter a few hours later. He’d never taken his fits seriously; Sherlock was a child sometimes. But John still feel the slightly shaky feeling in his limbs, could still feel the way Sherlock’s voice reverberated around in his head, like aftershocks of an earthquake. This wasn’t...normal. It wasn’t him.
“Performance? What perfomance?” Sherlock tried his best to sound nonchalant, acting like he hadn’t nearly just run this man over to get inside but his heart was pounding rapidly against his ribcage. The sheer idea that John was inside there, right now, with Moriarty-
John simply stared at him in response, watching the detective’s chest rise and fall rapidly after his finished speech. He clenched his jaw again, scanning his face carefully as he struggled to process his reasoning.
John watched as Sherlock’s eyes flew open suddenly, as if just realizing he was awake. Sherlock blinked slowly, his light blue eyes flickering across the room and taking it in like it was the first time he’d seen it. Sherlock’s hands slowly loosened their death grips on the blankets, his rigid body loosening as his shoulders slumped down suddenly.
“You’re absolutely right, love.” Sherlock grinned and closed the gap in between them once more, his eyes fluttering shut as his mouth met John’s.
Lestrade made his way over a few minutes later and John was still doubled over against one of the police cars, laughing into the metal and Sherlock was trying to stifle his laughter with his scarf, the two of them refusing to look at each other at all in fear of losing it all over again. John could see Lestrade awkwardly pass a glance between the two of them briefly, before clearing his throat. John managed to push himself up, blinking rapidly with a dumb grin still on his lips, meeting his eyes.
He had murmured it to John a couple hours later, after they were breathless and sweaty and tired, wrapped in each other’s grips like tangled blankets, eager to keep their hands on each other.
Rosie watched nonchalantly as John leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek, squeezing one of her toys loudly. Sherlock turned his head last minute and meet John’s lips, the two of their faces flushing bright red like teenagers. She threw her toy down immediately, squealing for both of their attention as they pulled away with soft smiles upon their lips.
“That too.” He turned his head to face Sherlock once more, his frown deepening. He still hadn’t said a single word and it was getting to be very concerning. John watched as he swayed slightly on his spot on the sidewalk, still gazing up at the building with a strange sort of frown on his face. After a moment, he turned slowly on his heel and walked up to John and Greg, finally meeting their eyes for the first time. John was startled at how lost they looked, blinking rapidly as Sherlock opened and closed his mouth once, as if deciding on whether to speak at all before words began to fall out.
Sherlock seemed to be debating something internally in his mind, pursing his lips together tightly as he refused to break eye contact, and John saw his Adam’s apple move slightly as he swallowed. He suddenly felt like he couldn’t breathe.
John swallowed thickly, blinking a couple times and he glanced down at Sherlock’s hands on the table, his knuckles white as they gripped the edge of it. He tilted his head back up before pushing his palms against the carpet, scooting himself over and around the table to Sherlock’s side.
Sherlock was silent, his head now tilted further downward as he stared straight down into his lap. All John could see were his dark curls, still damp with rain water clinging to them, a bit shiny in the lamplights surrounding them. John watched his back rise and fall as he took a shaky breath, lifting his head up and finally looking back at him with tear filled eyes.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and grabbed the bag from him, crossing to the window and pushing it open, glancing below briefly before tossing it out. John winced as he heard it land on the concrete below, amongst the other piles of trash, and heard Mrs. Hudson shriek downstairs from the noise.
The sudden thunderstorm that had overtaken London when John stepped out a few minutes later was one that chilled the air and shook the windows of his car with thunder. He quickly buckled Rosie into her seat as the rain poured down all around them. He managed to get into the driver’s seat decently soaked, but not completely, and listened in fond silence on the ride home as Rosie talked animatedly to herself, looking out the window at the various cars and bright flashes of lightning that lit up the town every so often. John took his time on the slick roads and they got back home a little after 6:30. Rosie giggled loudly as John tried his best to shield her face from the pouring rain, running up to the front door and pushing it open, leaping inside.
“Thank you,” he replied sweetly, before swinging his foot forward swiftly and kicking the door shut once more, turning back around to face the couple, a different sort of look in his eyes. “I’ve got everything I need to ruin your lives, right here in this bag.” He shook it gently, and Sherlock could hear noise like glasses clinking together come from it faintly.
“We didn’t say anything about the letter because...well, we didn’t want to burden. If he’s really back, all he’s after is us. And it’s been a good three months since we got it…” Greg scoffed, shaking his head in response.
“His wife obviously left him. He sits at home all day and complains over the Internet about how the world is falling apart because people of the same sex hold hands in public. I knew it from the start; I just wanted to see what he’d do when I brought Rosie in.” John scoffed, shaking his head as Rosie reached out for him, taking her from Sherlock gently.
“I can do that,” he replied simply, and there was a rustling on the other end of the line as he began to move. Rosie had finished sniffling and was now gazing up at Sherlock quietly, thumb still in her mouth to make up for her lack of her pacifier. Mrs. Hudson walked inside and gently scooped the toddler up, flashing Sherlock a concerned look.
“I’m sure, Sherlock. John tried to fight it at first, but then he seemed to tell him something and...he stopped. Just gave in, followed him out the front door.” Sherlock stiffened at that, his heart clenching uncomfortably. It made him sick to think about what Moriarty might’ve said to him, made him sick to think that he was just upstairs, passed out from all of the drugs in his system and could’ve saved him. It made him sick that Rosie had been asleep, unguarded in her bedroom while this entire thing happened.
“Thank you, at least from me.” He shot Sherlock a look and he merely stared blankly at him in response as Lestrade shrugged.
“I have some business I want my brother to look into. He’s been ignoring my calls and texts, unsurprisingly, so I had no choice but to come down here myself.” John fought back a smirk, instead nodding in agreement. He heard his bedroom door open down the hallway and looked over, seeing Sherlock pop his head out.
He nodded once, not even sure if Sherlock saw it before clearing his throat, walking around the kitchen island.
When he looked up, he was looking into the face of the still slightly concerned security guard, who eyed Sherlock up and down for a moment.
“No…” Sherlock felt his stomach plummet sickeningly, immediately turning around and gazing at the room. It seemed normal enough; nothing was out of place, no windows were open, Rosie’s things were left as he remembered them, at least from the morning before. Keeping one beneath her and one hand rubbing her back, he slowly circled around the entire room before stopping in front of the clock, tensing up.
Sherlock eyed him nervously, watching him closely but remaining rigid nevertheless, and John leaned forward, reaching out with both hands to slowly loosen and release his grip, clutching his hands tightly within his before meeting his eyes.
“The quote is from Romeo and Juliet. Act 4, scene 5.” There was a strange sort of pause then, the words seeming to hang thick and heavy in the air for a moment, Sherlock’s eyes flickered up to meet John’s, his Adam’s apple bobbing slightly as he swallowed. “The scene where Juliet is found dead in her bedroom.”
And really, he shouldn’t have been surprised that Jim Moriarty knew about his past suicide attempts. He knew everything about him, down to the very last detail but there was something different about having it aired out for everyone to see. This was a jab at him, a jab at something personal and difficult and...and John didn’t know about any of it.
Rosie’s eyes were still sleepy as she rolled around in her crib, kicking her legs around once she saw her father come in. She gave him a big smile when John picked her up, blinking her large brown eyes at him as she held onto the front of his pajama shirt.
Sherlock’s eyes were closed before he even finished speaking, looking possibly even paler than he did before. “John…” His voice was soft but rough sounding; he cleared his throat and his eyes flew open suddenly, meeting John’s eyes with such ferocity that it made him shiver slightly.
A few minutes later John was on the floor of the bathroom, sitting next to the tub while Rosie sat in her plastic chair, splashing around in the water and bubbles happily and completely ignoring her dad, as usual. John smiled and rested his chin on the porcelain edging, watching her contentedly for a few minutes before he heard the door open behind him.
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock…” he murmured into his neck, his voice muffled. He heard Sherlock hum happily in return, the noise vibrating his throat slightly.
But, nothing ever went the way he planned. In one way or another, he always managed to fuck it up. He wasn’t cut out for the “normal life”, never had been. Nothing about him was normal, and the one person in this world that had brought him a sense of normalcy was now lying dead on the ground a few feet away.
“Yeah, pretty much,” he replied shortly, looking absentmindedly at a painting on the wall directly behind her, wondering idly how much time was left in their session.
He broke out of his reverie as Sherlock’s sudden loud, coughing fit began, and John was almost ashamed at how quickly he rushed to his side.
“Rosie and I moving in. It’s a lot different with a baby, she demolishes everything in her path, demands attention constantly, takes over anything and everything she wants…” His voice trailed off and he blinked slowly for a moment, meeting Sherlock’s slightly confused gaze. “Oh my God, she’s a mini you.”
“Oh, John. Don’t get sappy on me, I have no time for it,” He sounded genuinely cross and it made John laugh, sitting up on the floor before turning to him.
John feels his head bob up and down slightly, though he’s not fully aware he’s even doing it. He hears an audible sigh from beside him, and then the movement of the bed beneath him as Sherlock goes to move off.
“That’s right…” He watched Sherlock’s eyes shut again, his head hanging down almost limply in between their chests, and for a moment he was silent. For a split second John wasn’t sure if he was even breathing; he seemed to become almost motionless. John gently began moving his hands from his neck, debating on whether to speak when a sudden loud, choking sob escaped the detective’s lips and made John nearly jump out of his skin.
Within the month, Baker Street was completely renovated. The things that had survived the explosion were still there when they returned, and John felt hopeful for the first time in a long time. As the days passed things were finally starting to feel okay again, like the pieces were falling back into place and now every time he saw Sherlock, it was like the first time all over again.
Sherlock remained silent, his hands shoved into his coat pockets as he simply stared up at the wall, scanning it with his light colored eyes. John sighed, shoulders slumping slightly as he took a step back, listening to the faint wailing of police sirens in the distance. He could hear the murmurings of people calling the incident a terrorist attack behind him, but he knew as soon as Lestrade took one look at it, he’d know exactly who it was.
“Now, we’re going to play a little game.” Sherlock looked up quickly as a loud, creaking noise began to echo among the arena, the floor of the stage catching his attention. He watched silently as a trapdoor opened directly down center, a few feet in front of John. A group of hands immediately pushed up a small wooden table, sliding it onto the floor above them. Moriarty watched with a pleased look in his eye, leaning down slightly as a hand reached upward, holding out a small, purple velvet bag.
“Sherlock, please,” he begged in a hushed tone, still rubbing Rosie’s back as if that would help anything. “Say something.”
“Not right now, Sherlock. I can’t do that.” He sucked in another breath, ignoring the way his boyfriend’s eyes had begun to water once more. “I’ll see you in the morning.”
John blinked, watching as Lestrade began to stutter out apologies. “Oh God...I didn’t…” He cleared his throat awkwardly, avoiding his eyes. “I had no idea…” John shook his head quickly, laughing a bit.
“I’m quite fine like this, thank you. Are we going to see the Queen again?” John let out a loud cackle, earning a sour look from Mycroft as Sherlock winked at him from behind his brother, flopping down in his chair.
John closed the fridge slowly, his hand trailing on the handle for a few seconds before he turned to face Sherlock, giving him a moment to unscrew the cap and take a sip.
Sherlock furrowed his brow in confusion but nevertheless scrambled to grab her, pulling her close to his chest. She sighed in sleepy contentment, immediately resting her head against his shoulder as he slid one arm beneath her for support, the other on her back.
It was almost a slap in the face to think that Sherlock didn’t remember it, but John could see the gears of his mind working slowly, a soft look of realization dawning across his face.
Sherlock kept his eyes shut for a moment because, yes, he was a child. John watched his rapid breathing slow back down for a few moments before he finally opened his eyes, staring back at him with a void look of guilt. John kept a grip on his hands, and this time Sherlock didn’t try and fight it.
“Sentiment is getting the best of you, brother,” he drawled sarcastically, reaching down for his coat off the chair.
“They died on the same day?” he asked almost uncertainly, as if he were afraid to, and John nodded in response.
And, really, he thinks that’s the first time he thought of the three of them them as an actual family.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I told you to pretend. I forgot the sugar anyway, hang on…” He turned around swiftly, placing a large hand behind Rosie’s back before walking back into the kitchen. Once he disappeared through the doorway, Molly set her cup down immediately and turned to John, her eyebrows raised.
And really, this wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair that he was saying all of this. He had gone off and shot himself up with heroin and done cocaine and them come home in this blind stupor just to tell John he didn’t care if he died soon. It was fucked up and somehow...it still made sense. Sherlock had never thought highly of himself, and he never would. He just wasn’t like that, and John didn’t understand how he hadn’t made this realization earlier.
Sherlock dared to peek at John while his back was turn, the couple exchanging blank, almost empty looks, simply at a loss for what to do. Sherlock followed his directions after a moment, stepping forward and making his way to the table. He stood in front of it, his hands shoved into each of his coat pockets, his hair still dripping slightly from the rainwater in it.
“I know, John. God, I know…” He didn’t deserve any of this man’s love. He didn’t deserve John at all. John’s face went back into his neck, and Sherlock could feel hot tears begin to spill onto his already feverish skin.
“I think you’re right…” John shifted his empty plate towards the side, finishing off his drink as Sherlock began to wipe Rosie’s face off with a napkin, looking up as their waitress walked back over to check on them, a bubbly girl of about 17 with blonde curls falling down her shoulders and bright blue eyes.
‘No, you’re fine…” He looked over at the alarm clock on the bedside table, raising an eyebrow. “It’s only 8 am. Why the rush to leave?”
“I suppose it’s comforting to know I will be remembered as that rude asshole of a detective after I die,” he mused, breaking eye contact and glancing over to check on Rosie. John studied his profile for a moment, taking in his set jaw and slight frown upon his lips. He turned to face the splash pad once more, watching Rosie dart around in her bright yellow shirt.
John sighed, shifting Rosie on his hip as he watched the detective begin picking up random shirts off the floor, throwing them over his shoulder as John sat on the bed.
“...I’ve never spoken at a grave before, and it’s really a bit unnerving, I don’t like it.” John bit back a grin, listening to Sherlock’s slightly whiny voice before he cleared his throat.
John was confused for a moment. “People” was a vague term. The people on the streets? The people that he spoke to? The people he worked with at the clinic? The people he lived w-
“Yeah, I did. Big old celebration thing, at the Globe Theatre in Southwark. It’s Shakespeare’s birthday, or something.” Sherlock immediately stopped, not giving notice to the man who kept walking a few yards, finally noticing he’d stopped following him and turning to frown at him.
Sherlock groaned a bit at the impact, stumbling back slightly but John merely squeezed him tighter, sighing into his coat.
“Are you okay?” Sherlock’s breathing had finally evened out and he’d stopped sniffling. John moved reluctantly as he began to untangle himself from John’s grip, letting go of his waist and sitting up slowly, swaying slightly.
John finally cleared his throat, leaning forward in his seat and resting his elbows on his knees, clasping his hands together for no good reason besides the fact that he was still trying to comprehend what he said.
“I saw you, too. Constantly.” Sherlock turned his head to look at him directly, his lips turned down into a slight frown.
“Doesn’t matter. This one still sucks. That woman’s probably on drugs.” John smiled a bit, shaking his head in disagreement.
“Waste of time, John,” he replied, waving his hand absentmindedly as he hoisted himself up to sit on the counter beside the stove, his long legs dangling above the floor, the toes of his shoes scuffing the tile floor. “Will you put on some tea? Rosie and Molly will be here soon.”
Shakespeare festival...public crowds...easy to get around...perfect place for something big. Something fatal. The perfect scene for Moriarty to place himself in.
“This story will make for one hell of a blog post,” he commented, and John managed to compose himself and nod in response, straightening up and crossing his arms.
“Greg...he hasn’t replied to me all day. I know how he gets, I figured he was just being his usual moody self, but now it’s late and if you haven’t heard from him…” His voice faltered off, his mind racing through all of the potential places in London he might be in.
“Mhmmm…” He sat up slowly, reaching up and wrestling the first couple of buttons from his shirt free before leaning dramatically back against his chair, bubbling his lips for a few seconds.
“I’m not going to just sit here and wait for him to be returned on my doorstep,” he snapped, probably a bit too harshly but the old woman merely sighed at him.
“Yeah, I know that,” he replied bitterly, tilting his head to the side slightly. “Although you’ve got a really funny way of showing it.” Sherlock merely blinked at him in response, his arm still hanging limply off the side of the bed where John had shoved it.
With each passing hour, John could feel the worry build up more and more within his chest. Rosie entertained herself with her toys, then began eyeing the kitchen and John realized it was past dinnertime. It felt weird, not having Sherlock feeding her in her high chair, not having his constant chatter and laughter as Rosie made a mess. John found himself glancing towards the living room more and more often, anticipating the sound of the door opening though it never did.
“Fine,” he replied simply, still staring him down. “But if you need any help-” John jumped slightly at Sherlock’s sudden loud groaning noise, raising his eyebrows as Sherlock shook his head quickly, his curls bobbing in the air.
“Can I have that? We need it for tea.” She stared at him blankly for a moment, then suddenly jerked it away as he tried to grab it from her, Molly giggling loudly.
John scanned his face carefully, stepping forward. “Yes, of course…” he replied, reaching forward and touching one of the tulips delicately with his fingertip before glancing up at him, meeting his eyes. “Tulips were my mum’s favorite.”
John peered around the corner, watching Sherlock walk over to his brother once more. Mycroft eyed Rosie warily, still a bit unused to seeing his ex-junkie of a brother with a baby on his hip, but they began to talk nevertheless. John was stifling giggles as Sherlock played up his maternal role dramatically; he kept bouncing Rosie on his hip and swayed her back and forth, still nodding along intently with whatever Mycroft was saying.
“It’s like I’m still in the prison cell rooms, like I’m back in the well and there’s no light, and I can’t see…” His voice faltered, and he dropped his hand from his eyes, staring pointedly at the dark wooden floor beneath his feet.
John walked over quietly, wrapping the blanket around the worn out and weary looking detective’s shoulders and back. Sherlock remained motionless, as still as a statue as John carefully tucked the blanket into his lap, covering up his legs and feet. He sighed softly, scanning his expressionless face for a moment.
By the time 9 o’clock rolled around, John was a nervous wreck. He’d sent 12 text messages, called him at least 10 times, and STILL no reply. Rosie’s eyes were heavy with sleep as John got her dressed for bed, already planning on calling Lestrade.
“I want Papa…” John’s heart clenched painfully at his daughter’s sleepy words, glancing down at her relaxed frame amongst her pillows and blankets.
“It’s...almost noon?” Rosie was awake by 8 or 9 every single morning, without fail, and John had never forgotten to or ignored getting her.
“Have you heard from or seen John at all this morning?” The sudden look of confusion that overtook her face was answer enough; Sherlock felt his own face blank out as she blinked at him in response.
“Thank you, Sherlock…” he murmured, and yeah, maybe it took a few seconds and maybe the hug was awkward, but he still returned it, his chin resting briefly on the top of John’s head before he mumbled a faint “you’re welcome” back.
Sherlock snorted, crossing his arms in an attempt to look annoyed but he looked like a confused toddler instead. “What grade are we in, John?”
“He had the right idea,” he said monotonously, and John couldn’t help the laugh that escaped his lips, covering his mouth with his hand as Sherlock smirked at him, running his fingers through his hair.
He heard Moriarty’s feet against the ground as he stood back up, the gun wavering slightly against it’s spot on his temple as he moved. Sherlock inhaled another breath, still shaking slightly and tried to picture John’s face one more time. His smiling, charming, beautiful face.
He heard Moriarty’s footsteps slowly walk towards him, sounding hollow and loud. Sherlock’s chest rose and fell slowly, still struggling to draw in shaky breaths.
“Good God, you two are absolutely repulsive. They weren’t kidding when they said you two were exclusive now.” Sherlock really didn’t want to know who “they” were, and merely continued to keep his grip on John as Moriarty began to circle the couple, rubbing his hands together. “Now, before I start vomiting, let’s get this show started, shall we?” Sherlock turned his head just in time to see Moriarty pull a gun from his jacket pocket, cocking it with one swift motion of his thumb before pushing it directly onto Sherlock’s temple, smiling softly. “Time’s up.”
There was an odd silence then, one John was sure he’d never experienced before. They stared each other down as if in the middle of a vicious showdown, Sherlock’s eyes brimming with tears and John’s blank in return. He scanned his face carefully, trying to convince himself it was probably the liquor talking but he’d never seen Sherlock look so serious in his entire life.
“Oh yes, this is him. Don’t mind his appearance; he had a rough night last night.” Sherlock grit his teeth, staring forward pointedly at the guard as he continued to gaze uninterestedly at him. “But he didn’t come here for me, even though I wanted him to.” His voice had taken on a sudden whiny tone. “Went through all this trouble for you to get to notice me and in the end all you want is JOHN WATSON.” He drawled out his name slowly, like a child, and Sherlock immediately turned his head, stomping up the rest of the steps and sliding around the guard until he came face to face with the man who was supposed to be dead.
“Say you love me back.” John’s mind seemed to blank out for what seemed like the tenth time that day, his mind struggling to comprehend his words. What kind of a demand was that? Sherlock was staring at him with his hazy eyes and pale demeanor, his body drowning in drugs and all he could say was that?
John looked up immediately, his frown deepening as he sat up slowly. “I never said that,” he replied slowly, watching as the detective crossed the room to sit on his other side, his feet dragging slightly against the wood floor.
Sherlock was running down the stairs before he knew it, Rosie clinging onto his neck tightly as she bounced in his arms. He kept his grip on her and immediately reached down for the baby monitor, furrowing his brow as he examined it.
“‘S okay, we’re pruning up anyway. Should probably get out.” John watched him quietly, Sherlock sitting up a bit, the bubbles in the water nearly all gone now.
What did that have to do with anything? He could’ve picked anything, any quote in the world and yet he specifically chose that line, that play, that playwright. Sherlock turned his head slightly, glancing at someone running past him, shielding their head from the pouring rain.
In the moments that followed, Sherlock briefly thought about his time being tortured in Serbia. He thought about the way his body felt after his suicide attempts and drug binges, thought about the various times he’d been injured on a case. He imagined every possible thing in his life that had hurt him leading up to this moment, emotionally or physically or mentally, and decided that none of it compared to this.
John slowly lifted his arms up from their resting spots on either side of his legs, placing one on the side of his neck and one on his face, He could feel Sherlock’s pulse, sickeningly quick against his skin and tried his best to ignore it, swallowing thickly.
“I love you too much to put you through this again,” he whispered softly, his voice cracking pitifully. John’s chest ached painfully at his words, staring idly at the face of his very high, very sick boyfriend. He knew he should be upset, and he was; Sherlock had promised him after the Sherrinford incident that he’d steer clear of the drugs, and he had kept his promise for over a year now. For him to just throw it all away like this...well, it said something.
“Don’t change the subject. Come on, this is exactly what you need, a nice big case...we haven’t had one in months.” And it was true; the last big action they’d seen was the Culverton case, and of course the mess at Sherrinford that occurred after. It was a big step, in John’s opinion, but Sherlock seemed ready enough. He was tired of the excessive experiments in the kitchen, anyway.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes a bit, although he looked the farthest from cross he could be before he gave a heavy sigh of defeat, his head falling back on the chair.
“Do you love me?” The words tumbled out of his mouth before he could stop them, and he was already kicking himself internally before he finished. Of course Sherlock loved him; well, he had to in some way at least, if they were dating. Sherlock hadn’t ever looked John straight in the eye and told him that before, which would be unnerving to most but to John it was okay. That was Sherlock, that was who we was and how he acted. He didn’t need to be told he was loved daily.
He knew he shouldn’t have done it but he turned his head anyway, meeting the consulting detective’s eyes once more. He looked a bit defeated, his shoulders sagging slightly as he sat amongst the fluffy comforter and pillows, looking very much like a child in that moment. He gave a small nod, blinking slowly.
It happened rather fast; one moment he was fine, his breathing finally steady, and the next Sherlock was crying.
Slowly, Sherlock pushed his legs back down so they were flat against the mattress once more, still refusing to look up. He sniffled a bit, staring fixedly at their hands resting in his lap. John bit his bottom lip harshly, not really knowing what to say.
“It’s hot,” he mused, setting his bottle back on the table as John smiled, following suit and sliding back over to his own chair, leaning against it as well.
Sherlock’s eyes scanned his face for a brief second before he looked down at the bedspread beneath them, suddenly looking very exhausted. John blinked, clearing his throat quickly before pushing himself off of the bed, his feet hitting the cold hardwood floor gently.
“We just click. She likes listening to me play violin.” John snorted, shaking his head before he scooped Rosie up in his arms, sliding out of bed.
“Where is he.” Moriarty’s smile hadn’t changed a bit. He tilted his head to the side, scanning his face with those slightly dim, large eyes of his. He was dressed in a grey suit, not much different from the one he’d been wearing at the top of St. Bart’s, his arms crossed behind his back. He looked very much alive...and that’s what terrified Sherlock the most.
Sherlock pouted slightly, a stray curl falling into his eye as John smirked. “He really needs your help, if he came all the way over here to personally ask…” Sherlock merely hummed absentmindedly in response, looking down on the floor and gasping in happy surprise as he picked up his dark blue robe.
Mrs. Hudson finally let him be, and John found himself dozing off in his chair. When he woke up to the sound of Rosie’s whining over the baby monitor, the sun was nearly done setting outside. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he trudged upstairs and scooped her out of bed, taking her back down.
“I didn’t know you two were this close,” he stated a few moments later, Sherlock squinting a bit as he scraped the last of the food from the jar.
Sherlock merely blinked at her for a moment, watching as she immediately reached her arms out to him, wiggling her feet happily and smiling.
Sherlock blinked at him again, his eyes still foggy before he took a step forward, nearly stumbling and falling. He reached out and grabbed instinctively onto John’s shoulder for support, furrowing his brow slightly. It took all John had in him not to smack his hand away, merely clenching his teeth together as he watched the detective push himself back up to stand, absentmindedly brushing off his wrinkled coat, as if that would change the way he looked.
He dropped his grip almost reluctantly, feeling his boyfriend’s blatant fear rolling off of him like waves from a hurricane. For a moment he kept his mouth shut, not quite sure what to say.
“Sherlock…” His voice faltered out. Sherlock clenched his jaw, gritting his teeth before he responded.
“It was lovely; can we have the check, please?” Rosie climbed up against John’s chest, resting her head against his neck sleepily as their waitress smiled.
John watched him silently as he messed with the gun, tapping his index finger against the side of his thigh rapidly. He had a point. 221B had been his first home here in London.
“I never wanted Rosie involved with any of this. I thought we were DONE after Sherrinford, after Eurus and after...him.” He shook his head slowly, swallowing a bit. “We were just supposed to solve cases, John. Solve cases and come home every night to your daughter and repeat.”
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson, and we absolutely love them, thank you for making them…” She waved her hand around wildly, trying to act modest but coming across as a bit crazy, laughing loudly to herself.
“No! Please, I don’t...there’s no one else to help!” Sherlock rolled his eyes, shifting Rosie slightly.
Sherlock found himself frozen to his spot, setting his jaw and staring at the concrete ground beneath him. The footsteps got louder, and his stomach churned miserably.
“Love you, Sherlock,” he murmured, pressing a kiss on top of his curls before turning around and walking to his bedroom, closing the door and curling up in bed for the night.
For a moment, John thought he was finally calming down; his breathing steadied and evened out after a few minutes, and his hands had now fallen from John’s arms to rest on either side of his thighs on the hardwood floor below. He stared vacantly at the ground, and John was gathering up the courage to reach out and touch him when Sherlock’s deep, croaky voice echoed out amongst the flat once more.
“Don’t do it for me, Sherlock.” Sherlock paused at that, standing back up and blinking a bit. Another beat, then Mycroft’s voice once more.
“...milk, for one,” he began, and John nearly snorted but managed to keep his lips pressed together. “And...bread.” He blinked again, looking a bit lost as if he were actually thinking of things they needed. John couldn’t remember the last time he’d gone shopping.
“This is serious business, Sherlock.” Sherlock dropped his sheet even lower, his entire chest now exposed in London’s bright morning light streaming from their windows.
“50!” His reverie was suddenly interrupted by Moriarty’s loud voice, and Sherlock looked up just in time to see his finger pull the trigger.
There had to be a clue, or a hint, or some sort of break to tell Sherlock where Moriarty had taken John. It wasn’t going to be any fun for Moriarty if the man he was torturing had no idea where to find him.
He buried his face into his neck, inhaling deeply and relaxing as Sherlock returned the hug, his long arms wrapped around him just as tightly.
“Papa’s busy, I’m sure he’s sorry he wasn’t here to tuck you in…” John murmured in response, fixing part of her shirt gently. Rosie merely blinked up at him, rolling her legs around slightly.
Sherlock had no problem balancing his job and the baby, and John was so very thankful his daughter was calm and collected most of the time. She was so curious, always wanting to know what was going on and Sherlock didn’t mind at all. He’d come home from work on multiple occasions to find the two of them doing experiments in the kitchen, Rosie hanging off of Sherlock’s hip from a safe distance as she watched him work with huge eyes.
Rachel smiled softly at him, giving her pen yet another click as she scribbled something down on the journal sitting on her lap. She was dressed in a mint green pantsuit today; John made a mental note to tell Sherlock about it. He’d taken some sort of interest into the particularly wild outfits his boyfriend’s therapist wore.
“No, stop.” John’s voice is loud and abrupt and really, he didn’t mean for it to come out that way but Sherlock freezes anyway, a strange silence filling the room.
“Alright, what did I do? Did I say something? Do something? You’re obviously pissed at me.” John grit his teeth as Sherlock ignored him yet again, still staring at his tea in his bony hands. He tapped his fingers agitatedly against the coffee table, staring Sherlock down and trying with all his might to bore holes straight through his skull.
John barely has time to think about him tonight, for this nightmare wasn’t about his time in the war like usual.
John closed the door quietly behind him, Sherlock still oblivious and pulling his phone from his pocket, checking the time.
“She doesn’t have to tell us anything, Sherlock. Besides, all we’re doing today is walking around London. Greg gave you a profile, right?” Sherlock nodded, still looking displeased as John finished dressing Rosie. She immediately pushed herself towards Sherlock, crawling across the counter with loud giggles and he finally cracked a grin, setting her bowl down and lifting her up with one arm.
“It’s just probably something you should let your clients know beforehand.” John was seething now, setting his notebook and pen down on the coffee table and sitting up straight, opening his mouth before he was interrupted.
Another gunshot. Sherlock swung his head around the opposite way, towards the noise, just in time to see a gun slide across the stage floor. He followed it with his eyes briefly before looking back, his eyes widening in shock to see John standing a few feet in front of him, pointing a gun down towards Moriarty’s body writhing on the ground in front of him.
It was real crying too; the kind that took over your entire body like some sort of monster. It wracked your bones and struggled to come up your throat and out of your mouth, dying to be seen and heard. John was taken aback as he watched the consulting detective seem to collapse into himself, pulling his knees up and burying his face into his hands, struggling to breathe.
It took it’s toll on Sherlock after a few weeks; John found him curled up in their bed earlier and earlier each night, turning down more and more cases as the sheer exhaustion from all his worrying took over him like a disease. One night John retreated into their bedroom to find him curled up on his side in the middle of the mattress, struggling to keep his eyes open after putting Rosie down to sleep around 8. He climbed into the bed carefully, trying not to move it too much before snaking his arms around his boyfriend’s waist from behind, resting his forehead against his back.
Sherlock gritted his teeth, resisting the urge to snap at him as Moriarty suddenly took a step back, clucking his tongue disappointedly.
“It’s raining,” he stated stoically, and Mrs. Hudson let out another anguished sort of gasp as John smirked at him, raising an eyebrow.
John realized later on that he should’ve known that night that things were going to end soon. They couldn’t keep this up forever; there were too many demons after them, too many skeletons in too many closets and it was all just a matter of time.
“You know there’s a lot of things I had my doubts about before, and they ended up being true,” he replied, turning his body slightly to face him head on. “But, Sherlock...I do believe you. I don’t know why and I don’t know how this happened, but...I promise I believe you. You’re not crazy.” He set the crumpled receipt down on the coffee table, reaching out to grab ahold of his hand. “Whatever this means, whatever chain of events this is going to set off...it’ll be okay. We can handle it, we always do.”
“Yes…” He looked down at the baby in his lap for a moment, looking disconcerted. Mycroft gave him an odd look, leaning forward a bit.
“It’s alright, bug...don’t cry…” Sherlock could barely focus on the way Rosie buried her face into his neck and hugged him back, his mind trying its best to catch up on everything that had happened.
“I...I have a house, though…” he replied rather stupidly and Sherlock shrugged, not even paying attention to him but rather to his gun, loading individual bullets into it.
“Sherlock, w-” He stopped short, taking in the way his boyfriend’s face had lost all trace of color. He stared stoically at the wall in front of him, his hands hanging limply from his sides. Rosie began tugging rapidly onto John’s sleeve, pointing towards the bottom of the building.
His blue eyes were full of tears threatening to spill over onto his white cheeks, and John felt his chest ache once more. He’d seen Sherlock upset a handful of times, but never this extreme. Everything about him seemed to be in pain; his were lips pressed together tightly, the dark circles beneath his eyes giving him a horrible gaunt look.
They heard a gentle knock on their door just then, and John had the sudden urge to strangle the consulting detective’s neck.
He heard John exhale loudly, refusing to meet his eyes as he glanced down at the bottles, slowly pulling his hands from his pockets. He listened to the steady shower of rain still falling from the sky above them for a moment before nodding once, swallowing thickly.
Thankfully, the kids were fine physically, just shaken up and scared. John kept them close until the police arrived, reassuring them that everything was fine now and that their parents were on their way to get them.
“I bet she’d hate Mycroft.” Sherlock cracked a grin at that, looking up at him and meeting John’s eyes.
This was who needed to help him raise his daughter, this was who he needed to live with. Sherlock had taken on his parenting role automatically, had devoted his entire life to Rosie without blinking an eye. He never complained, he never refused to help even though John half expected it at times with his childish attitude. No, Sherlock was everything he’d ever wanted in a partner; and somehow, he’d seemed to know this since they first met all those years ago.
However...normalcy was craved. It was sought after, it was wished for and desperately needed. To be normal meant to be okay. It meant that the nightmares had stopped, that the PTSD from seeing flashing lights and loud noises didn’t keep them awake at night.
John doesn’t even notice the lights come on; his eyes are probably squeezed shut too tightly. His blood is pumping loudly in his ears, and he’s suddenly aware of his mouth, clenched shut as if it were stitched that way, his teeth grinding heavily against one another.
“I don’t understand. She sits in her chair and laughs in my face when I try to feed her.” Sherlock smirked, wiping up some of the food off her chin with the spoon before turning his head.
Before he knew it, Sherlock had torn apart the closet in search of his handgun and thrown his coat on, rushing his way downstairs in order to leave as quickly as he could. He couldn’t sit there and waste anymore time sulking away in Baker Street.
“Isn’t that a normal thing? Babies are much more prone to develop relationships at a young age because they don’t think about it, they just...do.” Rosie blinked up at the two of them with big brown eyes, licking her lips messily. John smiled, turning his head to face Sherlock.
It was nearly 5 in the evening when they got back to London, the temperature having risen a bit but it was still raining, cold and wet and heavy all over the city. They took a cab from the station back home, shaking out their coats in the doorway as Mrs. Hudson came scurrying around a corner.
Sherlock huffed haughtily, yanking his hand from John and turning his head away towards the wall like a child. He always did that, always deflected John’s words and stubbornly cut him off.
“Have you never seen an infant before in your entire life?” he asked sarcastically, and John stifled a laugh, disguising it as a cough as Robert turned to face him now, looking a bit uneasy.
“God, you’re so boring sometimes!” he whined loudly and Sherlock merely shrugged in response, his head falling to the side to rest on his own shoulder as he watched him.
Sherlock remained expressionless as Lestrade quickly grabbed ahold of Moriarty’s arm, a team of four more men restraining him from all sides. “Shut up, mate. You’ll not be seeing these men ever again, understood?” He didn’t wait for a response, instead looking up to meet Sherlock’s eyes. “You’re okay?”
“Last minute call out for a case we’ve been working on, he wasn’t particularly happy about leaving her behind. But our little bug turned 18 months old yesterday so we’re going out to celebrate tonight when he gets home, isn’t that right?” Rosie ignored him, too busy examining the lush blue carpeting she’d just noticed was beneath them and Rachel laughed softly.
“Please…” He began to gently pry away his tear soaked fingers from his face, carefully pulling them off before slipping his palms against his, running his fingertips softly against the skin of his wrist.
Another pen click. John tried his best not to flinch, swallowing down a sigh before he sat back straight and looked up, Rachel writing something else in her notebook. John waited patiently, watching as she looked back up, her dark brown eyes meeting his.
Sherlock made a sort of strangled sobbing noise that seemed to come from deep within his throat and it startled John, sitting up a bit before Sherlock’s tears finally began to fall.
Sentiment was a chemical defect found on the losing side, and for the first time, Sherlock felt like they were losing already.
John closed his eyes, breathing in slowly as he listened to Sherlock take the wrap off of the flowers finally, and when he opened them and turned back around he saw him standing back up, the flowers neatly placed in the middle of the two stones.
He took a sharp turn at one of the street corners and nearly collided with the detective’s chest, gasping as he stopped himself in time. “Sherlock!”
“It’s just another bill to pay. Besides, Baker Street is better, and you know it.” To be honest, John was a bit offended that Sherlock seemed to think he had no emotional attachment to the house he and Mary had bought together. It was where Rosie had grown up thus far, after all. Then again...Sherlock had very few emotional attachments to anything.
“John, that sounds like a biography for the entirety of America in 2016.” And really, John hadn’t heard anything that funny in months.
“Mrs. Hudson really should tell us when she’s leaving.” John rolled his eyes, sliding a shirt over Rosie’s head as she reached impatiently towards the bowl, grabbing a strawberry and shoving it happily into her mouth.
“I took him away, and now I’ve won. I beat you.” Sherlock was shaking now, his fingernails scraping across the stage as Moriarty smirked up at him.
John turned on his side after bringing his heart rate back down, facing him and watching him sleepily. He reached out, gently pushing a curl from out of his eye, smiling faintly when he could feel it was still damp from the rain.
And yeah, he deserved that. He knew he did. It was frustrating how dependent he had suddenly found himself on words. All words were were noises made in different dialects from someone’s mouth and suddenly they had Sherlock crying himself into a drug induced stupor? It just didn’t make sense; he’d never fathomed he’d ever find himself getting emotional over a fucking sentence. He had no heart, no emotion, no feelings; that’s how he’d grown up. That’s how he got by. There wasn’t time for...love.
For a moment, the two of them just stared at each other, although John felt that Sherlock wasn’t really looking at him at all. His coat was hanging off his shoulders, his dark button up shirt wrinkled and halfway tucked into his pants. His large hands were placed on either side of the doorway to steady himself, as his tall frame was swaying slightly in front of him. He blinked slowly down at John, frowning slightly and looking confused, as if wondering how he had gotten there in the first place.
“Well, find it again! I will not have you giving my sweet little goddaughter a cold!” She reached out and cupped Rosie’s cheeks, pressing a kiss to her head and Rosie giggled in return, clapping her hands happily. John smiled and nodded.
“Papa!” She sniffled again, reaching her arms out needily towards him, another stray tear falling down her face. Sherlock immediately crossed the room and scooped her up, ignoring the way his arms ached before pulling her close to his chest.
Rosie was enjoying all of her attention later on that afternoon, happily smashing her little hands into her cake and giggling loudly as Molly and Mrs. Hudson took pictures. Greg was there as well, and somehow Sherlock had gotten Mycroft to show up, although he didn’t seem too pleased about it.
John sighed loudly, shutting his laptop rather forcefully before setting it down and sitting up in his chair, Sherlock failing to react at all.
For a moment, John swore time stood still. It was stuck like that; him and Sherlock simply staring at each other from across the room. John opened and closed his mouth a few times, pursing his lips as he tried to think of something to say. Sherlock looked bored; his face was nothing more than that of a stoic mannequin, waiting for his response.
“Is our time nearly up? My daughter, I need to get her…” Rachel clicked her pen once more, sighing softly before she glanced down at her watch.
“She sees you every day…” Sherlock stayed bent over for a moment more before sitting up slowly, rolling his shoulders and neck around slowly before meeting his eyes and shrugging.
“The back’s busted out, scratches on the side...looks like Daddy might’ve dropped it, mmm bug?” Rosie sniffled, having resorted to popping her thumb in her mouth to relax. It was safe to say she had no idea what was happening; after all, she was a toddler, but it helped immensely to think out loud. She was a good listener; good like her father.
“I’m so sorry, John…” John swore he felt his heart crack in two, probably audible within the tense silence that accumulated between them.
“She likes you better today.” Sherlock stuck his tongue out at him and Rosie took his opportunity to reach up and grab his mouth, smothering it in thick vanilla frosting. John burst into laughter, covering his mouth and watching with wide eyes as she giggled loudly, rubbing her hands all over his face and Molly quickly snapped a picture.
“It’s snowing outside,” he replied, pointing aimlessly at what he hoped was the window before dropping his hand limply back into his lap. Sherlock hummed in response, the two of them locking eyes for a few moments. A calm silence filled the room, and then was broken with John’s sudden excited exclamation. “Let’s play Truth or Dare!”
In the weeks that followed, nothing else involving Moriarty happened. John had expected it; he had drug out his past schemes for months on end before, this wasn’t going to be any different. Personally, John found himself wondering if the note had really been a fake after all, but the way Sherlock constantly carried himself now always brought him back to his senses. He had a new sort of air to him, one of constant alertness as if ready to attack at any moment and frankly, it exhausted John just to watch. Sherlock had been reluctant on going out in public with Rosie as much as they had before, but John argued that retreating further and further into Baker Street would just raise suspicions and attract more attention. So now, every time they went out John felt like he was walking with a bodyguard.
“I don’t know. I never wanted it in the first place.” John rolled his eyes, glancing back at Rosie before responding.
“No,” he replied, his voice sounding rather hoarse and he cleared his throat. “No, he’s…” He sighed a bit shakily, closing his eyes and suddenly feeling very tired.
It was oddly fascinating, watching Sherlock interact with his daughter. He was so gentle with her, his large hands and bony fingers taking the time to pull her headband off her head without yanking her hair, and smoothing it back down once he finished
“Sherlock, please, just calm down, breathe for me…” He could feel how shaky Sherlock’s hands were on his arms, despite the fact that he was trying to cling onto them as tightly as possible. His breathing had sped up dramatically, his back rising and falling with his head still arched downward. John swallowed thickly, knowing damn well that Sherlock more than likely wasn’t listening to him, what with the haze his mind was probably in. Instead, John just sat perfectly still, letting things play out on their own instead of trying to fix it himself.
With every step he took, Sherlock felt the weight of the impending situation fall onto his chest like lead. He had no idea what was going on inside, what he had done to John...the sheer thought made him nauseous. Moriarty eagerly held the umbrella beneath his head, taking a step forward so that they were right on top of each other, noses nearly touching.
“He is...he’s amazing.” Sherlock took a pause after this, and John could hear him fidget with the flowers once more. “He’s the first person I’ve ever met that doesn’t make me feel...well, weird and left out, even though I am usually. If you met me, you’d get it.” He gave a heavy sigh, pausing again before clearing his throat.
The next day was the 23rd, the day before Christmas Eve. For the past week, Sherlock and John had been tracking down a particularly strange guy who’d been brutally injuring and even killing one person with candy canes, “a true Christmas hero” as Sherlock had called him, much to Lestrade’s dismay and John’s stifled laughter. The case really shouldn’t have taken Sherlock so long to figure out, because the culprit wasn’t the brightest and had left sticky, peppermint fingerprints at majority of the crime scenes. In all honestly, John figured Sherlock was secretly enjoying the way this was starting to ruin the Christmas time vibes that overtook London during this time of the year, but quickly caught him after the last victim died. Sherlock and Mycroft didn’t have that much in common, but their hatred for the holiday season was something they’d always agree on.
“Oh, so this constitutes “not that much” now?” he hissed loudly, gesturing to the various fresh needle marks littering his inner arm. Sherlock shot him a nasty look at that, pulling his arm away quickly.
“Why is it that you two can’t go 10 minutes without arguing?” He shut the door as Sherlock huffed indignantly, throwing his sheet off his body like a child.
He yanked the door open with his trembling hand and nearly leapt across the hallway to Sherlock’s door, pushing it open and stumbling inside.
“I love your reasoning there,” he remarked, his grin widening as Sherlock crossed the room, shifting Rosie to his hip before leaning down to press a kiss to his lips.
“I remember…” John watched as one of Sherlock’s hands was lifted from his waist, coming to rest against the top of John’s chest, furrowing his brow slightly as if his mind were working overtime. “That was the night you said you loved me…” he breathed softly, and John stiffened up a bit. He nodded slowly, ashamed at how happy he was that Sherlock still remembered that even within his drug induced mind.
So all he could do was run his thumbs along the skin of his wrist, hoping his attempt at being soothing was helpful. They sat in silence for a couple moments, and then suddenly Sherlock tilted his head back up to face him.
“What did I say earlier, little one?” John grinned and took the bag from her, setting it in his own chair as Sherlock came out of the kitchen, somehow balancing the tray of cups in one hand and holding the kettle in the other before setting it down on the coffee table.
“Not exactly…” He stood in the doorway quietly, watching his boyfriend (it still felt odd to think), settle himself on the bed. He sat with his back directly against the headboard before pulling his long legs up and bending them at the knees. He set the food down on his pillow and moved Rosie to sit in his lap, right up against his thighs. She seemed to do this often, because she settled down against him perfectly, watching eagerly as Sherlock twisted the lid off.
John didn’t dare break their gaze until Sherlock was a mere inches away from his face. For a brief second, his blue eyes flickered down to his lips and John barely had time to realize what was going to happen before it did.
“Look at all the clouds this morning, love…” Rosie chewed loudly on her hand, looking out the window happily as John swayed her back and forth, listening to the two brothers talk downstairs.
“Maybe she’s lying,” John remarked out loud, looking around the square once more. Rosie had been attached to Sherlock’s hip all day and was now struggling to break free from his grasp, eyeing a group of toddlers parading around in a splash pad at a park a few feet away. Sherlock looked a bit conflicted at first, keeping her firmly on his lap but his features softened slightly as John reached over and pulled off her sandals, smiling at her.
“Erm...yeah, we are, but I don’t know what that has to do with anything…” Robert’s face had taken on a sort of nasty look, as if he were suddenly disgusted with the room, looking around it and then down at Rosie.
It was as if Sherlock hadn’t even been listening to him, he just spoke over John’s agitated words like it was nothing, cutting him off with his quiet voice. John opened his eyes then, immediately turning his head to meet his gaze. Sherlock’s eyes seemed more focused than before, his face halfway smushed against the side of his pillow as he stared back at him, his hand still tightly gripped around John’s wrist.
Mycroft’s helicopter had disappeared from overhead now, leaving the swarm of police to start scoping out the rest of the building in peace. Sherlock glanced around quickly, watching officers pulling random people out of the wings and hidden spots in the audience, confiscating guns and yanking them towards the exit. He even witnessed people emerging from the stage trapdoor a few feet away, completely subdued in shiny silver handcuffs. He was so caught up in the scene playing out before him that he didn’t hear John walking towards him, jumping in fear when his hand made contact with his arm.
“Alright, truth or dare?” Sherlock sighed again, slamming his fists on the ground once like a child before blowing a stray curl out of his face.
At first he thought he was imagining it. It sounded as if someone was struggling against something; frantic, panicked noises and gasps. It was very dim, and John found himself sitting up slowly, frowning. If he was hearing things while he was awake now, he was gonna need much more than therapy.
“Everything last night, I swear to you...it’s not going to happen again.” John smiled faintly at him, leaning his cheek against one of his hands as Sherlock ran his thumb along the side of his face.
John opened and closed his mouth a couple of times, pressing his lips together before blinking,inhaling a sharp breath. “You...you mean that?”
“Come on, love…” He elbowed his way through the rest of the parents gathering their children up, muttering rushed apologies as he struggled to find his boyfriend once more. Rosie kept a cold, wet grip around his neck, her hair dripping slightly onto John’s shirt.
John was suddenly aware of how tightly he was clenching his phone. It was obvious what he had gone out and done; the way he kept wrinkling and sniffing his nose told him enough. John sucked in a deep breath, setting his jaw rigidly.
“Two households, both alike in dignity,forbidden love, blah blah blah…” Sherlock flinched slightly as Moriarty twirled the gun lazily, his finger dangerously close to the trigger. “It’s one of Shakespeare’s tragedies, no?” John jumped violently in his spot as Moriarty suddenly slammed his hand on the table in front of him, leaning forward in the same moment. “What happens at the end of the play, John?”
John kept a close eye on him, though. Every few seconds he was turning his head to gaze at his boyfriend without even realising it, and Sherlock made no comments. He simply kept one arm wrapped around Rosie’s small body, keeping her asleep against his chest while his other hand absentmindedly stroked her blonde curls, his gaze fixated on the passing buildings outside.
“I don’t want it to be hard, I don’t!” His voice cracked slightly and John’s chest ached, tightening his grip on his hands as Sherlock spoke. “It’s just...I’ve never felt like this, and I don’t deal with things like other people do, and it’s all so new and I don’t know what to say because I’ve never been a nice person but I want to be that for you…” John shook his head quickly, releasing his hands before reaching up and wiping his cheeks with his thumbs, keeping a gentle grip on his face.
Molly was standing there, looking a bit worn out as she always did but wearing a soft smile, Rosie sitting on her left hip with her pink diaper bag slung over her shoulder.
“Sherlock, please…” His voice was wavering, and Sherlock winced at his facial expression, eyes squeezed shut and his mouth pressed into a tight line. Moriarty merely hummed, pressing his gun deeper into the skin of his temple, staring Sherlock down with his hazy blue eyes.
“Oh, it’s been paid for already.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow as John sat up a bit, looking slightly shocked.
“We all know the story of Romeo and Juliet, RIGHT?” he repeated, and Sherlock dared to glance briefly at John, who had gone particularly pale in the face, staring at the table in front of him as if trying to piece things together.
“He’s...he’s dead. That note…” He shook his head slowly, swallowing thickly before continuing. “It has to be a fake. It’s...it’s gotta be something to scare us. Throw us off, or something.”
“He used to have the time as a kid. He probably blames it on me now, but if I remember correctly it was our darling sister who was always provoking them,” Mycroft had mused, and John hadn’t been surprised. If he had suppressed all of the things that Eurus had done to him as a kid, why wouldn’t he forget about the panic attacks too? John remembered asking Mycroft when the last time he’d had one was, and the look of pain that crossed his face, too slow even for John to miss, was something he still remembers to this day.
His arms were around Sherlock’s neck in an instant, colliding into him with such force that he nearly fell back, although it was probably from all of the alcohol still swimming in their systems.
“Why did you stop?” he barked, and Robert flinched a bit, tearing his gaze away from Rosie, who was staring absentmindedly at the ceiling, once more.
“I think Rosie has enjoyed this meal the most out of any of us,” Sherlock declared, looking down at the infant in his lap, her lips coated with bright red ketchup as she opened her mouth and threw her head back, demanding another chip from her father. John smirked, watching amusedly as Sherlock picked up another piece from his plate and fed it to her, grinning as she leaned against his chest in pure bliss, chewing in silence.
John pulled his arm away, probably a little too quickly but he couldn’t care less at this point. He crossed his arms over his chest, pursing his lips agitatedly as he squinted slightly at his boyfriend.
“Sherlock!” he slurred, immediately throwing himself down on his knees and crawling around as Sherlock rolled onto his back, groaning a bit. “Are you okay?”
A few hours later, he was stirred from his sleep as he felt Sherlock climb into bed beside him, smiling sleepily to himself as his long arms wrapped their way around John’s waist, his face going to rest in the nape of his neck before falling back asleep once more.
The rain showed no intention of stopping anytime soon, still falling rapidly onto the front section of seating and edge of the stage. Sherlock watched Moriarty’s feet as they began to loop back around him once more, inching towards John once more.
One of the British Parliament members had gotten himself involved in a scandal; he didn’t go into much detail but from his tone it had been pretty bad. It had been kept a secret in order to give him and his family time to flee before being released to the press (a perk of working for the government, he supposed), but last night his three kids had been kidnapped; a 12 year old son and two daughters, 8 and 4. Sherlock was visibly distressed as his brother spoke, holding a bit tighter onto Rosie as his brother explained the details and John stayed mute.
“You need to sleep, Sherlock...that case took a lot out of you…” Sherlock hummed in response, bringing his knees up slightly before leaning over and resting his forehead against them, closing his eyes. John reached over and gently ran his fingers through his hair, fingernails scratching his scalp gently and he heard Sherlock sigh in content, his arched back rising and falling slowly.
“John…” His breathing was still shallow, his voice thick and scratchy from coughing. John merely stared at him with wide eyes, silent as Sherlock’s large hands found their way to either side of John’s waist. He lifted his head up slowly, his hazy eyes meeting John’s clear ones, and John was startled to see tears in them.
“By whom?” He shifted Rosie to his other arm, blinking as the girl looked around the crowded restaurant, frowning a bit.
“Of course it’s a normal thing, it just…” He shrugged a bit. “Usually happens to parents. But she’s taken a liking to you way faster than she ever did for me.”
In an instant, John was suddenly illuminated in a harsh, bright spotlight, coming from the opposing side of the theatre, near the top of the building. Sherlock squinted, watching John jump in surprise as Moriarty laughed softly, turning to glance at Sherlock. “Your boyfriend has quite the stage presence.”
London was awake and bustling outside; the dim lighting Sherlock had mistaken for morning light was simply due to the overcast sky. He peered out the window briefly, watching people and cars mill about aimlessly two stories down.
John knew better than to disturb him, and when he put Rosie down and got ready for bed that night a few hours later, Sherlock was still in the same spot. He tugged a large blanket from their closet into the room, glancing around sadly at all of the pictures and papers and maps littering their floor and tacked up on the walls, his heart aching for the poor kids. He knew Sherlock felt the same way; he’d taken on this panicked sense of urgency with the case, getting more frustrated than usual when their clues left them a dead end.
“No, dear...I thought he was up here, with the two of you…” The nauseous feeling came back, only this time it was only partially due to the drugs in his system. Sherlock aimlessly began to walk back down the hallway, his heart pounding loudly in his ears as he pushed open his bedroom door, making a beeline for his coat that he knew was still draped across the chair. He grabbed ahold of his phone, glancing hopelessly for a call or text from John but to no avail.
“This is absolutely disgusting; peas and apples? It looks like vomit.” Rosie swayed slightly, obviously very excited to eat and Sherlock grinned at her, taking the spoon from her little hand and scooping some of the mush up, bringing it to her mouth.
“20!” Sherlock immediately reached forward, grabbing the bottle farthest from him before holding it out quickly.
“So it seems.” He scratched at his chin a bit awkwardly for a moment, his expression softening slightly. “Are you...feeling better, Sherlock?”
“You remind me of him, the boy…” He turned, watching Sherlock follow him over, his curls hitting the top of the yellow tape briefly before he stood up straight, staring John down.
Sherlock’s usually light grey and cerulean eyes weren’t twinkling as they usually did. It was as if someone had snuffed them out like old candles, and all that was left was the smoky aftermath. His fair complexion had turned a sickly pale color, his cheeks absent of the usual warm, pink blush. His face seemed sunken in, his high cheekbones sharp and white against the dark lighting in the hallway behind him.
“Yeah, things are good. Really good.” John tightened his grip as his daughter let out another squeal and wriggled her way against his thighs in some sort of attempt to get down, still giggling loudly.
Sherlock hadn’t gone back to work yet, but John didn’t mind. He had the clinic to busy him for the time being, and Sherlock was still recovering. He liked spending his days with Rosie when it was his turn to babysit (as far as John was aware), and besides that he’d just been reading and playing the violin.
“No idea. But it can wait. I have a better and far more entertaining idea in mind.” John raised an eyebrow, looking confused as Sherlock turned his head down towards Rosie. “Want to meet my stupid brother?” John huffed at him, Sherlock smiling brightly as he turned towards the door.
But this time, it’s different. His stomach fills with dread because he knows who’s on his other side, who’s reaching out to touch him, and it’s the same person he just lost in a dream.
“Yes, of course.” He blinked suddenly, looking slightly concerned. “Isn’t that what people do? Didn’t you bring flowers to my grave when I w-” He stopped short, catching sight of John’s dark look and pursed his lips slightly. “Sorry.”
“Oh please, do shut up. You’re testing my patience and I really don’t feel like breaking your nose today.” He turned and eyed John for a moment, glancing at the children briefly before turning back to face him. “Although if any of those kids are hurt, I will be sure to break an arm or two as well.”
Mrs. Hudson was enjoying the wine John and Sherlock had gotten her for Christmas a bit too much, and John quite literally had to walk her downstairs to her room as she hiccuped the entire way there.
“They’re in here somewhere. Honestly, why don’t you just put the clothes in the hamper?” Sherlock made a distressed sort of noise, ignoring him and Rosie giggled, squirming around in her father’s lap.
John wrinkled his nose at him, leaning forward and clasping his hands together, his elbows resting on the table. “Please, Sherlock! I just wanna play one round!”
Basically, it was an acceptance that his life was no longer just his own, and his house wasn’t either. Everything that belonged to him, belonged to Rosie.
“Hi John, sorry I’m a little early, I’ve got a long day tomorrow at work…” Rosie had ahold of Molly’s cream colored scarf, stuffing it in her mouth to chew on absentmindedly as John shook his head quickly, letting her in and shutting the door.
When the door shut, he let out a long breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding in. He felt the tension he’d been trying to fight out suddenly come rushing back in, along with panic and fear and worry. He squeezed his eyes shut, lifting his free hand to rub violently at his face, as if that would help his mind think straight. Sherlock hung his head and sighed yet again, rolling his shoulders slightly until he heard Mycroft cough on the other end of the line.
John sat himself back up carefully, his arms snaking their way around Sherlock’s neck once more before he rested his cheek on the side of his face, his lips ghosting over the detective’s ear.
Lestrade thanked them over and over again for the hard work, something he hadn’t done as often beforehand. “It’s been awhile, and I just...I’m glad to have you two back.” John grinned and Sherlock gave a tired looking smile, nodding once.
John heard this same speech almost daily; he knew no matter what he said or did, Sherlock was always going to blame himself for this. John remained silent in response, just feeling Sherlock’s back rise and fall rhythmically.
“Right…” He glanced over at John and shrugged a bit, leaning back against his seat in the booth. John scanned his face carefully, then looked up as their waitress suddenly reached into her apron pocket, pulling out a piece of paper.
He turned around quickly and launched himself at the man now in front of him, dragging him to the ground in one swift move. He heard his head make contact with the hardwood, reveling in the noise it made before he sat up on his knees once more, balling his hands into tight fists and beginning to pummel at his face.
“Of course. Has Sherlock gotten back yet?” He jumped suddenly as the door burst open once more, turning around to find a soaking wet Sherlock Holmes standing in the doorway, looking displeased. His dark curls were stuck to his alabaster colored face, his coat dripping heavily onto the tile floor as he grimaced, shutting the door rather loudly behind him.
Sherlock’s large hands gripped the sides of his face as he leaned into the kiss, pulling him to sit up taller and meet his height. John was stunned, because why wouldn’t he be? He nearly froze up like a mannequin until Sherlock began to move his lips, and then it was all over from there.
There was another tense moment of silence between them, like a staring contest neither of them wanted to lose. John let out a soft sigh after Sherlock broke, tilting his head down to glance at his water before taking his other unsteady hand and attempting to unscrew the cap off. John kept his mouth shut, resisting the urge to yank it from his hands and open it himself.
They’d stayed in Brighton for almost 2 years, when he was 11 or 12. He remembered bits and pieces; swimming in the summer, driving up to London with his sister and mother during the winter, nothing too special. He figures he’d subconsciously wiped all his good memories from this place away in his mind; after all, it was the place he’d had to bury both of his parents at.
“JOHN?!” Everything came rushing back to him in an instant, hitting him like a battering ram. Time caught back up, and Sherlock found himself shoving Moriarty’s gun out of his way, running over and falling to his knees beside him. “John, no...God, please wake up…” His hands immediately flew to his shoulders, hoisting his limp body up off the stage to pull him into his lap.
“Has Daddy been here this morning?” He felt Rosie sniffle against his shirt, his neck growing damp from her crying.
The clapping had stopped. For a moment, Sherlock merely sat there on his knees, staring at nothing in particular while the tears kept flowing. The parts of him that had felt numb moments ago now seemed to be on fire, bright red and hot and dangerous.
“Are you okay?” His voice was drowned out by yet another loud crack of thunder, and Sherlock swore he felt it resonate in his chest.
He hadn’t cried this hard in...years. Maybe even ever. He couldn’t remember a time where he struggled to breathe in between each sob, where he began to feel lightheaded and had to hold himself up with his palms to the ground in order to stop from collapsing.
“I’m sure you know the story of Romeo and Juliet; by the way, did you like my clever little line I used on the wall?” He aimed the question at no one in particular, and Sherlock kept his mouth shut, tilting his head downward slightly to stare at the ground.
John’s face was hovering over his now, one hand on the carpet and the other still around his bottle as Sherlock grinned toothily up at him, nodding quickly.
The voice that had been haunting his nightmares for months on end, the voice that never seemed to leave his subconscious no matter how hard he tried to drown it out.
“Stay right there bug, okay? Make sure you can always see me and Papa.” Rosie nodded eagerly, already wriggling her way out of Sherlock’s grasp.
Rosie was silent on the other end of the monitor; she’d been sleeping soundly through the night but had also begun teething, and the pain woke her up sometimes. As much as he hated himself for it, John found himself wishing she’d cry just so he’d have a reason to get up and not sleep.
About three weeks into the renovation, John was repainting the yellow smiley face on the living room wall when Sherlock nonchalantly brought it up.
Sherlock wouldn’t be pulling out of the kiss, staring at him with shiny blue eyes and a look of uneasiness and pain on his face.
John had never really considered himself a lightweight, but when he was with Sherlock it took no time at all for him to get wasted. An hour later he found himself on the floor of the apartment, his legs propped up against the top of the coffee table in between them as he nursed a bottle of whiskey, breaking out into giggles every time he caught his boyfriend’s eye. Sherlock was lying across the top of the table, his long body too long as his legs hung off the sides and his head lolled off of the opposite end, his curls nearly touching the floor as he stared at the fireplace behind him, swinging his vodka bottle around in his hand.
“Come on love, let’s get something to eat…” Rosie whimpered slightly at leaving him, but nonetheless clung to Mrs. Hudson’s neck, Sherlock watching the two of them walk out quietly.
Sherlock had remained silent throughout John’s little speech, not even reacting when his hand was grabbed onto. He lifted his head up after John had finished, squinting his blue eyes slightly at him.
“Doesn’t matter. This is my fault and-” He stopped short. He vaguely wondered if Mycroft knew about anything that had happened last night. It was safe to assume that he did, but...he didn’t want him to, necessarily. He cleared his throat again, thankful that Mycroft had decided to keep his mouth shut before speaking again. “I just need to find him.”
“Do we have chimney sweeps anymore? Like, is that an actual job?” He took another swig from his bottle, his head still upside down as John hiccuped loudly, throwing his hands up as he shrugged.
Life wasn’t fair, and he absolutely did not plan on staying around any longer to experience this cycle again.
John glanced around quickly at the crowd for a moment, taking in their hushed whispers and stunned silence before he took another step towards his partner.
Sherlock shifted Rosie once more to sit on his hip, her head immediately going to rest on his shoulder, watching the stranger in front of her boredly, still sucking on her pacifier. He looked up again, raising an eyebrow.
“Needy, needy! She’s not taking after me in that aspect.” Sherlock sighed dramatically once more as John quickly rinsed the soap from her hair before pulling her out and wrapping her in a towel.
“And how is Sherlock doing? I saw him in the papers a couple days ago, he got some sort of award?” John snorted, getting another burst of laughter out of Rosie before he nodded quickly.
Sherlock’s cheeks flushed a light pink color for the second time that day and John’s heart fluttered, fighting back a grin as Sherlock pursed his lips slightly, reaching out and wiping Rosie’s face with the bottom of her now disastrous looking shirt.
That afternoon, John couldn’t keep the silent cab ride back to Baker Street from his mind. Sherlock had looked out the window the entire time, but it didn’t seem to be on purpose. Rather, John thought he looked very deep in thought, his brows scrunched together slightly as London whizzed past them outside.
John turned his head back towards the doorway, staring across the hall at his opened bedroom door, back to his empty, unmade bed. This wasn’t right; nothing was right. Something had to change.
“Okay…” he replied slowly, looking a bit conflicted. “I haven’t...haven’t been sleeping well, so…” He shrugged a bit, messing with his bottle in his large hands. “I might just try and sleep tomorrow…”
John smiled into his boyfriend’s shirt as he felt Sherlock’s lips press a gentle kiss onto his knuckles, feeling him sigh softly.
Sherlock pursed his lips slightly, looking a bit conflicted for a moment before shrugging his shoulders, a look of agreement on his face.
