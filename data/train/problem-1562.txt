The next morning John was awoken by a delighted squeal of Sherlock, who was kneeling on the floor before the tree examining a test tube set that was left sitting out for him.
Don't do anything stupid John! I am coming for you!
“And you don’t know anything about him either! He knew you were hurting him by keeping us apart!”
"NO JOHN!" Lestrade screamed out in panic as John's body hit the water and went under. Three shots rang out and the preps fell to the ground, darts in their necks, unconscious.
"Beat it a while back."
"You're thinking too hard."
John laughed pressing his lips to Sherlock’s forehead, "That's just a nice way of saying broken."
“I must tell you that I am not pleased with this John.”
The room went silent, tension in the air.
"Absolutely. He kept me alive."
"No." Sherlock replied in a small voice, worry clear in his tone.
Sherlock and Lestrade have a chat.
Sherlock’s breathing hitched, he knew what was coming.
"It's an off chance but it is a chance. In the mean time we will be looking at other leads but for now it seems that he has managed to go to ground. And to keep you from going bored in your flat and keep you from attempting to escape I’m going to allow you access to the CCTV network to keep watch Sherlock. I want you to watch out for anything that you deem suspicious."
Hello everyone, first off let me say thank you for reading so far. Unfortunately I have decided to abandon this fiction. It's not going where I want it to at the moment. I may pick it up again in the future but right now I will not be finishing it.
Sherlock just reclined further into Johns arm, suddenly feeling exhausted.
"What is it?"
"Thank you John. I'm sorry we didn’t tell you sooner, but Sherlock was in enough danger at the time. We needed you to keep believing that he was dead. You don't owe me a thing."
"I may or may not have forgotten to take them for the last few months."
Mycroft started to shake the moment that his brother was gone, “You’re going to be the death of the both of you my dear brother.”
Sherlock smiled at the confession, "John, I love you."
John gave the security guard a look of recognition, “Hello Emerson! How have you been?”
He couldn’t stand to be in the med bay anymore, and since his lovers had went off to check on Uhura he saw no qualms about escaping. He knew that hiding on the observation deck would be easy for them to find him, but still he just needed a few minutes to collect himself. This was not the first time that he had lost crew. In fact they were the numbers 67-72.
By the time he stepped out of the cab onto the pavement outside the chic eatery on Kensington Church Street, he was feeling positive and happy. He gripped his anniversary gift for Sherlock tightly in one hand and pulled the restaurant door wide with the other.
“Oh, that won’t work in here,” Mary said cheerfully, setting a steaming bowl of cock-a-leekie soup in front of John. “I didn’t want any interruptions for our first night together, so I bought one of those…what do you call them?”
“Oh, jesus. I don’t...I don’t think I can last,” John panted, he frotted desperately against Sherlock. “You feel so fucking good. Waited so long.”
“But this is what interests Sherlock, my dear,” William insisted. “Crime and bodies and the like.”
“And a little patience,” Sherlock agreed. “And courage. Courage, my love.”
The high-pitched whine Sherlock emitted stoked the fire in John’s belly. He looked up briefly to see that his lover’s eyes had closed and lips parted.
“I’m not a spy,” Sherlock admonished, dipping his chin. “Consulting Detective. And yes, it is standard equipment. Unfortunately my old friends—” he waved a hand in the direction of the platform “—destroyed mine when they caught up with me earlier.”
“As a television personality. That’s all.”
“I know you know this,” he replied evenly. “Most people wait because of the odds of something happening during the first trimester. I’m sure we’ve talked about it. I suppose you deleted it. Or you were filtering.” John brushed his lips over Sherlock’s shoulder as he passed him on the way to their bed.
John was breathing hard, though he now realized it was from more than just the excitement of the altercation. “Sh-sher-lock. Oh, god!” He doubled over, clutching his belly. “Oh, god, no. Not now. Please not now. Not like this. Not again!”
“Victor,” John said. “You were telling me about Victor.”
Sherlock dipped his head, brushing his mouth gently over John’s. John let his eyes drift closed. It was everything he’d imagined it would be and more.
“How can anyone be this…noble?”
“Sorry?”
“No, no. It’s fine. I mean, I know all about you. Not from the thing you gave me—I know that was blank. No, Mycroft and Sherlock have seen your whole file now. The one Magnussen memorized. Your old CIA friend got hungry again. This time he went to Mycroft’s people.”
“That’s all right,” Sherlock replied pleasantly, tightening his grip on John’s hand.
John rolled his eyes, stretching forward to drag his naked alpha back into their bed. “Of course not. Silly man.”
“Shut up,” Sherlock sniffed. “Isn’t every day a man gets engaged.”
“Come in—oh, John!” Sherlock jumped up from his desk. “I thought we’d agreed not to see each other until after tomorrow.”
Sherlock had stopped listening. His alpha biology was fully engaged now, and he was consumed with getting at his mate’s naked flesh. He pressed his fingertips into John’s bared biceps as he bent his head to return the kiss. It was noisy, with lots of tongue—it made his body sing.
“Absolutely,” John said firmly, addressing Mary. “Though we’re adding surrogates as we find them. We’d rather have the right people than take anyone just to say we have x number of surrogates of each gender.”
John stomped up the stairs at 221B, Sherlock on his heels.
“Yes, John?”
“And at my neck,” Sherlock insisted. “You’re staring at it right now.”
“Aren’t you…shouldn’t you be…upset?”
be uncomfortable?” Sherlock asked, trying not to sound offended.
“Da-da-da-da!” Drew chanted, reaching up for his father.
Sherlock could feel sleep approaching, and he knew that neither of them were exactly comfortable (or wouldn’t be for long), but he was far too content to care.
“How is he tonight?” the Canadian nurse asked, her voice hushed.
“OW!” Sherlock yelped.
Jeanette’s second husband, Max, was another story. John listened with interest as she shared Max’s story—surviving war in Bosnia, eventually making his way to Britain and training to be a doctor. It all sounded horribly familiar, particularly when Jeanette admitted that she’d known when they met that Max’s relatively placid demeanor hid a tortured soul, but that she had thought she would be able to help.
“How?”
An hour later, seated in the most beautiful restaurant he’d ever been in (overlooking the river) and stuffed with some of the best naan he’d ever tasted, John stood and pressed a kiss to his mate’s cheek.
Sherlock frowned; John hadn’t even mentioned he was still worried about that.
They stared at one another once more. John clenched his fists to keep hands that ached to touch from pulling Sherlock into a much-less-than-friendly hug. Sherlock removed his glove and offered his hand.
“Do you want him to be part of the baby’s life?”
John and Molly exchanged a look.
“It…I…just forget…”
Sherlock paused at the top of the stairs and looked at John, smirking.
“No.”
Kit, still looking a bit worried from John’s outburst, followed at a distance. He waited until John was settled, Drew on his lap, before getting too close.
“Ah,” Sherlock said, looking a tad sheepish. “Well, that’s not terribly scientific.”
John sniffed a little and shook his head again. He lifted his eyes back to the man on the bed. “You are going to tell me why you did it. I want to hear the words.”
John let Sherlock’s prick slip from his mouth with a satisfied smack. “Shh.” He soothed, rubbing over Sherlock’s thigh. “It’s fine. You were gorgeous.”
“’Kay,” John muttered.
“Yes, girlfriend. He’d had several before we became lovers.”
“And I know how to do stuff.” John was nibbling now—feathery, butterfly brushes of lips and tongue along the length of Sherlock’s slender neck.
“Is it because he’s also pregnant?”
“Why is there so much standing around?” Sherlock hissed between his teeth.
”Do you mind my asking,” John started cautiously. “How did it happen? Your heat, and…everything.”
The man looked…angry? No, concerned. He was worried about something, John thought.
“Sussex is growing on me.”
“Oh,” Angie’s brow creased with concern. “Oh, course you do. Well, it’s all right. I’ll just swap the names in the system now I know.”
The tension in John’s face eased instantly. “Yeah. ‘Course. Here…” He reached down and unceremoniously wiggled out of his snug red y-fronts. “There we are. Better?”
Mycroft looked horrified. “My, god, I would never—he’s my nephew!”
Which he was.
Sherlock settled and wiggled a little closer to John’s body. John seemed to approve; his left arm appeared from beneath the covers and he reached out to draw Sherlock into his side.
“What’s that, love?”
Sherlock beamed at him as he threw the door wide. “We’ll meet at seven. The address is 221B Baker Street.”
John couldn’t help but smile, even as he continued grinding his needy body into his alpha. “Fill me. I need it.”
John nodded. Sherlock stood beside the exam table and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. John let his head fall onto his mate’s shoulder.
“Down, Da?” Emmeline asked, looking up at Mycroft with those big brown eyes.
“What’s going on? What have you done?” John was sounding a little anxious now.
“Means exactly what you think,” Sherlock said through gritted teeth.
“I need to see you come, my love. I need it so badly,” John urged huskily. “Push the sheet away and let me watch your pretty cock. Please?”
“Yes, Kit?” Sherlock replied, glancing up once to check on Drew’s stability.
“Perhaps,” Sherlock sighed. He peeked at John out of the corner of his eye. “For now, I feel like supper. You?”
John understood, of course. He knew perfectly well that Sherlock was not a sociopath—he simply lacked (or had grown used to ignoring) social filters. In the time they had been living and working together, it had become clear that Sherlock was interested in learning some of these skills from John—he trusted John to do this for him. And John, even so early in their relationship, could deny him nothing.
“Thing is, I was worried that you wouldn’t want a relationship. I didn’t think you felt things that way.”
The boy looked back at Sherlock who—John now noted—looked utterly dumfounded and was staring at the young man in front of him as though he’d just arrived from Mars. He was apparently going to be useless in this particular situation. Of course he was. He’d never courted. He’d never challenged a rival, nor really seen John do it. He’d never had any interest in anyone but John. Certainly he’d have no idea how to deal with it.
“All right,” John chuckled. “You win.”
“Yes, I…sorry. A bit new for me, is all.”
"Well, he’s pretty important, I suppose.”
Kissing, John decided, was the best thing that had ever been invented. He’d always enjoyed it, but with Sherlock it was a revelation. They sucked and teased, nipping playfully and then thrusting with all the intention of acts yet to come.
“No, you’re all right,” John said, trying to keep the temper out of his voice. “What do you need?”
“This...this isn’t real, is it?” Sherlock whispered.
John glanced back at Sherlock.
The intercom crackled and John winced at the reference to his booked time off. As of this last Friday night, Dr. Mike Stamford would be covering his practice for nine days. Mike was a good friend from medical school and an excellent doctor. He taught Gender Medicine at Bart’s these days, but was happy to provide relief for John’s patients while John was away.
John chuckled again. “Yeah, we are.”
“Please,” the man drawled impatiently. “Can we dispense with the usual inanities?”
There was no denying it: something was terribly wrong.
“And I’m not the one who went on a suicide mission to Budapest.”
way,” John growled, leaning in to place an open-mouthed kiss on the little mole beside Sherlock’s Adam’s apple. He flicked at the sensitive skin with his tongue before mouthing up to nuzzle under Sherlock’s jaw.
Sherlock let his gaze follow the breadth of John's shoulders. Not excessively broad, but reflecting the years of physical training he had endured. Hard.
“Sorry?”
John stirred as Sherlock got near. “Hey,” he said, trying to sound as though he hadn’t spent most of the night babysitting Sherlock on Mycroft’s orders. “You all right?”
Sherlock turned to look into John’s face. “Mary is happy for you to help raise the child. She doesn’t know you know about David. And he doesn’t appear to be around.”
“There. Good?”
But he did.
“Piss off.”
“The Christmas party. Having our friends ‘round. I was a little surprised when you said yes.”
“Have you called the ambulance?”
“You know you don’t have to,” Jeanette said, grinning slyly. “It’s not like you owe me a debt or something. I’m long since over what went on with us.”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
"Yes, thank you." Sherlock took the leather-bound folder and began to scan it.
“I liked it. Not really our taste, as I said, but it was really well done. Don’t you think Sherlock?”
“I think he’s going to do it,” John said.
“So you did,” Sherlock agreed matter-of-factly. He smoothed his hand over John’s belly.
“Well, as it’s us it’s hardly likely to be uneventful,” Sherlock scoffed. “I’m sure Lestrade will call. Or who knows, we may get lucky and someone will be poisoned right here!”
“No?”
“I would love to,” John breathed.
John pulled back and cupped one of Sherlock’s cheeks in his palm. “It is difficult. I don’t think I can live without you, but that comes with some bloody awful choices.”
John?
“M’kay,” Sherlock agreed. “Love you
“Come and see,” Emily giggled, sliding from his embrace and heading straight back up the stairs.
John could only answer in grunts. He rubbed fretfully at his aching cock, but Sherlock stilled his fingers.
“Well, no.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and ran his fingertips back up over the definition of his abdominal muscles. They were lean and firm and surprisingly pleasant to the touch. He felt a bit weak-kneed as he wondered what John’s chest would feel like.
“I didn’t,” Sherlock admitted with a smirk. “Not definitively. Not until today. But I’ve had my suspicions about the two of them for some time.”
“Do you mind?” Sherlock dipped one hand into the bath and traced over the faint remnants of John’s existing stretchmarks.
“Don’t care. Just had coffee.” Sherlock proved his point by claiming John’s lips.
He didn’t realize he was sobbing until he felt John smoothing gentle hands up and over his back.
“Oh, right. Well, that’s nice.”
“You’ve been masturbating. In the shower. Why?”
"John!"
Unfortunately, as so often happened, there was a variable he had not accounted for.
“For god’s sake!” John snapped at his alpha, taking the washable (thankfully) felt-tip pen from Kit’s hand. “Come on, sweet boy. Let’s get you washed up.” He lifted the toddler into his arms and turned back to point at his mate. “You!”
“I beg your pardon?”
“Ye — ” John’s voice cracked. “Yes. Yeah. I’m here.” He slid forward again as the dark head turned toward him. “Sherlock.”
“The idea of you and me. Us. Men…I’m not—it’s not the first time.”
Sherlock turned, brows furrowed. “I’m not, but would you rather I left? I don’t mean to impose…”
“Do you need more?”
John took Sherlock’s hand and followed him back through the house to the steps. Sherlock led him up the narrow staircase and down the corridor to what had been his childhood bedroom. The grey and red decorated room had been upgraded with a toddler bed and a collection of some of Kit’s favourite toys.
“What exactly does your brother do?” John interrupted, suddenly very suspicious.
“We never actually had the prototype. And you were just the bait?”
Sherlock stumbled a little. “My bed?”
“Yes.”
John swallowed, his mouth suddenly bone dry. He’d never had the courage to embrace this side of his fantasy life before; now it was being handed to him on a silver platter. “Sherlock, christ…”
“Thank you…John. It’s such a great thing you’re doing,” Mary offered. “I’ve been working as a surrogate for more than ten years, and I can’t tell you how many stories I’ve heard about omegas who were too frightened or self-conscious to go to one of the clinics. Now that the NHS has approved a private, in-home option, I think we’ll see a sharp decline in the number of heat trauma cases in A & E.”
“Sorry.”
“Watson…”

“The game is never over, John,” Sherlock said, projecting for the cheap seats. Clearly he’d remembered the next bit. “But there may be some new players now. That’s okay. The East Wind takes us all in the end.”
Sherlock finally lifted his head. “You have to be.”
“We make decisions together.”
He strolled toward the waiting car, ignoring his phone’s text notices. He refused to read his brother’s prompts to “hurry up.”
“What is?”
“Yes. Fuck, yes.”
He was no saint, and didn’t expect to be married to one, but he knew he would never truly be able to trust her again. He knew, too, that Sherlock (for all his many faults) would die for him. He knew that Sherlock would stand by and watch him marry someone else if he thought it was what John wanted. There was a strange security in that kind of devotion—John shared it wholeheartedly. He wasn’t at all sure Mary understood what love really meant.
That there is never a card attached nor any reason given for the presents is irrelevant. The sender is well aware that while Mike Stamford may be many things, simple is not one of them. The genial doctor, for his part, knows full well who is behind his expensive packages. He understands the sentiment behind them; words are unnecessary.
Sherlock’s cheeks took on a little more colour as he finished with the buttons and tugged the shirt from his waistband. He dragged it slowly over his shoulders and let it fall. John licked his lips as the pale flesh was revealed.
John cleared his throat. “Do you always go commando or did you forget to do the washing?”
“What was the purpose of your trip?” he asked casually, laying aside the stacks of impossibly neat underpants and socks.
“Most likely, yes,” Sherlock confirmed. “But you’re here,” he said softly, taking John’s hand in both of his own. “I…”
“I knew it,” John breathed.
“N-no. I just…” John flushed. “It’s not that. It’s…how did you…pass?”
“Fine,” he replied.
Sherlock howled as John slammed into him twice more and roared his completion, Sherlock only seconds later.
“Ah, well then, that’s the reason,” Sherlock nodded and turned his gaze out the taxi window. He gave a half-hearted wave to Mrs. Hudson, still standing on the pavement outside the register office with Lestrade, Molly, John’s receptionist, Lucy, and John’s old friend Dr. Stamford. “You should wave goodbye to our friends, John. They came all this way just to sit through what turned out to be a very tedious bonding ceremony.”
“Mycroft’s surveillance of the flat. They picked you up, leaving in a hurry, and Mycroft thought it was a bit odd. He was concerned Sherlock might be hurt or in danger, so he tracked you. When your signal went dark, he pitched everything into high gear. As it happened, Sherlock had just called me looking for you. You weren’t at home and your phone wasn’t ringing through. I got him—”
The door opened slowly and Sherlock appeared. “I wanted to say…”
“Yes?” John prompted.
“I’ve spoken with my brother,” Sherlock began. “I know you had mentioned to Grant—”
The tears that been threatening were now very close to spilling over John’s cheeks. He set his brandy on the table beside his chair and clenched his fist.
He glanced up, but Sherlock had not moved beyond clenching his fists into the duvet. The dark head was thrown back, eyes closed.
Sherlock hesitated. “Would you—?”
Mycroft’s cheeks coloured and he shrugged, reaching into the car seat to adjust the baby’s blanket. “I just wanted—”
He turned to face the door, forcing a smile as it opened and Paige ushered in his next patient. His own problems would simply have to wait.
Sherlock instantly identified her three—no—four-year relationship with her girlfriend (and three cats), passion for photography and classical music, and volunteer work with an HIV/AIDS support charity (that was a cheat, really, as the badge was still pinned to her jacket) and decided she was probably harmless.
Sherlock's eyes snapped to John's face. His guilty expression melted immediately when he saw John's sleepy amusement. He should feel sheepish, he knew but...
As had Sherlock.
John trailed kisses over Sherlock’s jaw, finally arriving at his lips. He nibbled daintily at Sherlock’s still somewhat puzzled pout, gently running his tongue over the seam.
“Yes. Yes, I would.”
“Ready?”
“Say it,” John prompted, rubbing pre-come over Sherlock’s mouth and chin.
“Not your fault. Just a crazy pheromone misfire.”
“Hello, poppet!” he kissed her cheek enthusiastically. “How are you? Just up from your nap?”
He was still shaking as he secured the belt. He pulled his shirt off and pressed it against the wound—just as John had taught him.
“I’ve heard it should be ready before the end of the year,” Dr. Awiti said cheerfully. “I know that doesn’t help you.”
Greg flushed. “We, uh, we haven’t discussed much about that,” he started shakily. “We’re just trying to focus on the baby right now.”
Mycroft checks in and John learns even more about where things stand with Mary and Magnussen.
“You’d be surprised,” John drawled. “And you did attempt to carry your kit through. Did it not occur to you that there would be enough traces on the box and on your case—and probably your gloves—to attract the dogs?”
“I suppose it is,” John replied jauntily. “Though it looks like we’re early to the party.”
Sherlock had never
Sherlock mewled as John teased at his nipple with teeth and tongue, and then shifted to begin all over on the other side.
“I was…” John bit his lip. “I was looking forward to seeing you again. Not necessarily as my patient.”
“The truth is…I fell in love with you,” John blurted. He sucked air into his lungs and carried on. “I know it was a matter of days, and you were my patient, but I have never felt like this before. Not for anyone.”
Sherlock froze where he was, unbalanced on his knees.
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply. He
John shook his head.
"Oh?"
John settled himself and tucked his gift under the table out of sight. He still wanted it to be a surprise. Moments later, a waiter arrived and he ordered a drink. He was just about to order another when Sherlock finally swept in.
John met his eyes with a smile. “You’re always welcome, whenever you would like. You know I don’t ever want you to feel uncomfortable, though. That’s why I’ve been coming in here.”
John softened instantly. He was utterly unable to resist Sherlock when he was being sweet, which didn’t always look the way other people thought it should. Sherlock’s affection was often expressed in ways only John (and now Kit) could understand.
“Oh, come on,” John chided, following his mother-in-law into the house. “She’s his first. Probably his only. Of course he’d want to do everything up.”
John mouthed over Sherlock’s shoulder blade, grinding into the side of Sherlock’s upper thigh as he continued fondling Sherlock’s bum. “Don’t think for one minute that this lets you off the hook,” he rasped.
Sherlock groaned.
Sherlock let his eyes flutter closed, and his hands settled on his omega’s hips. John was already half undressed—shirt, socks and shoes discarded in a pile on the floor. He rubbed his body against Sherlock’s and it felt divine.
"Yes," John answered candidly. "Have you?"
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck. “I didn’t mean it. It’s just that I’m starting to feel a bit…rotund. But that’s how I feel, not how I think you see me. I’m sorry.”
Sherlock’s expression was a high-speed shuffle from confusion to annoyance to desperation as the tall woman approached his bed. John had to look away. He could feel Sherlock’s eyes on him, then, as the doctor joined them. Sherlock had heard him. He must have.
“Is this about Cambridge again?” Sherlock’s voice took on a sharp edge.
“Twenty-one.”
“And single.”
As he approached, one of Mycroft’s people emerged from the front of the car and moved to open the rear door for him. Sherlock nodded at the man and stepped into the welcome warmth of the car’s roomy back seat.
“Which is only 98% effective—less than that if the alpha was in rut as well.”
“I’d make it good.”
Sherlock turned back, watching John over his shoulder.
Greg and Molly had arrived at the landing and Emily immediately launched herself at them.
Sherlock snorted. “You’re not old.”
am I finding out that you have parents?”
John accepted the serving with a broad smile. “My favourite. It smells fantastic.”
“I was beginning to wonder, because my god, he smelled like chocolate and the first drag of a cigarette and dark roast coffee and fresh cut flowers all in one. I was so wet that I had to dig my fingers into the duvet to keep from crawling across the bed to get him.”
Sherlock took his time on the stairs. His joy at learning that they were both healthy was now somewhat subdued. Clearly John still wasn’t happy. He just had to figure out why, and while he was exceptionally gifted at deduction, parsing human emotion still very often eluded him. He pushed the half-open door out of his way and stepped into the sitting room.
“You know what I mean,” John sighed. “Why didn’t you say?”
“John?”
“Yes.” John tried to suppress a shiver at the sound of his name on Sherlock’s tongue. God, what was wrong with him?
Sherlock moaned. “
John nodded his agreement, propping the pillow up beneath his head. Sherlock shimmied up beside him until his own straining erection was near John’s eye level. He lifted up to rest with one knee on the bed beside John’s shoulder. The other he carefully lifted over John’s body to plant on the mattress on the other side of him. He held on to the headboard as he lowered himself to John’s waiting mouth.
“Yes,” Mycroft answered, standing to join him in the centre of the room. “Before he comes in, I wanted to take a moment to… prepare you.”
“I’m…sorry.”
There was a pause (which John chose to interpret as irritation). Finally Harry sighed.
Emily beamed at him. “I want to bring Mr. Turtle and my dolls and how do we tell Father Christmas? Is this home now?”
“Can’t they do this without you?” Sherlock pressed on, settling a hand on John’s hip.
He turned on his heel and marched back to the door. He threw it wide, allowing it to bounce off the wall, and stomped out of the room.
“Not even a little bit.” John smirked. “You’re difficult and dangerous. Apparently so am I. It’s just fortunate that makes us perfect for one another.”
“Just doing my duty.”
"Yes?"
“We are, yes,” Sherlock confirmed, his chin rising defiantly. “John and I are together.”
John released the button on the intercom and straightened the piles on his desk. Most of it was correspondence — which he hated dealing with — but there were some unfinished notes from his last patient. He tucked them into a drawer to be handed over for the transcriptionist at the end of the day.
It was three a.m. John couldn’t remember the last time he’d had a decent night’s sleep, or a day free from worry. It was a nightmare. He loved his little boy so very much, but being a parent was every bit as much of a disaster as he’d feared it would be.
“Despatched?”
“Because of all your hair?” John teased.
“Even…this?”
“Hmm? Oh, yes. Radio operator told me it went through fine. I assume it will make sense to whoever is receiving it.”
John nodded, passing the two men making his son giggle. “You three behave,” he admonished playfully.
“What’s not whose sort of thing?” Mrs. Hudson asked. She was making her way back into the room with the second batch of snacks. She passed the tray under Sherlock’s nose. “Come on now, Sherlock. Why not just have a little taste?”
Molly laid a hand over her still-flat tummy. “Evidently.”
He had thought about it. More than once. Usually following one of the nightmares that left him sweaty and shaken.
“John! Oh, so good. You feel so good.”
“Inconvenient.”
“Mmmmm, no,” John mumbled. His hand tightened around Sherlock’s forearm where it rested against his chest. “Feel so good here.”
“I know,” Sherlock said softly. He was ensconced on the sofa, laptop in place. “I just don’t see how moping will help with any of it.”
John smirked, taking a cleansing breath before he ventured too near the smell of death. “It is indeed. Wish me luck.”
Kit reappeared, bag in hand. “Ready!”
John started to shudder as his first orgasm approached. He clutched at Sherlock’s hand on his omega cock and held it over the crown, pulsing gently as he crested the first wave.
“Oh,” Sherlock breathed.
“Unca Greg!!” Kit immediately slid to the floor from John’s arms and ran to his uncles. Greg caught him up and gave him a noisy kiss before turning him so Mycroft could peck the boy on the cheek.
He drove directly to the trust’s main supply centre, next to the hospital. He worried a little about the patients he’d left behind, but Mycroft had assured Sherlock that the man they left in his place would be an excellent physical match
“JOHN!”
“I do,” Sherlock agreed, entering the bedroom with Drew at his side. The 18-month-old was clutching at Sherlock’s hand and still wiping the sleep from his eyes with the other.
“Is it enough?”
John groaned. “We shouldn’t. Not here.”
“Insist?”
“Yes.” Sherlock gasped as probing fingers slipped between his arse cheeks. John explored, teasing over but not quite touching Sherlock’s entrance.
Sherlock blinked at him for a moment. “I tried to bite you.”
Sherlock struggled to suppress his gag reflex as John reached his throat. He sucked air in through his nose again and tried to relax. He swallowed reflexively, which earned a moan from the man above him.
“I don’t tolerate you, you areshole!” John shouted. “I LOVE YOU!”
The midwife reappeared then, having dealt with the afterbirth. “Hello, everyone,” he said pleasantly. “Is it all right if I finish the clean-up now?”
John ground his teeth and started at the rough edges of the stone floor beneath his feet. “I wasn’t offended.”
John froze. There was no sound left in the room but for laboured breathing for several long moments.
“So a four year old?”
“Until this is all over, yeah.”
“Yes, yes, YES! Oh, Sherlock!”
John nearly wilted in relief. That was Greg. Greg’s voice. His lovely ex-copper brother-in-law was outside the door.
“Oh, there you are!” Janine laughed, setting her teacup down. “I knew my Sherl would get to it eventually. Surprised it took you so long, to be honest.” She glanced at Mary. “I dropped hints all the time.”
There was a long pause and Sherlock took a deep breath. “Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.”
“Anyway, it won’t interfere with sperm production,” John continued. “There won’t be any significant side effects, save for a moderation of your rut symptoms, a masking of your own scent and a reduction in your own susceptibility to potential mates.”
Sherlock slid out of the back seat, with John right behind him.
“Easy, now.” John dragged himself up and over Sherlock until they were nose to nose. His own aching cock needed some attention and he suspected Sherlock wouldn’t last much longer. “I need to fuck you. Can you take me?”
“John!”
need.
“A baby.”
Sherlock was casually flipping pages in an out-of-date National Geographic beside him. “Condoms—like many forms of birth control—have a limited effectiveness. They were the best option under the circumstances, but you know the numbers better than anyone.” He set the magazine on his lap, fussing with the corner of one page. “I’m…sorry. If I had noticed sooner, perhaps…” He hesitated, looking at John out of the corner of his eye. “We don’t have to do this.”
He tore his eyes from his subject (and the current means of his addled reasoning) and sighed with disappointment. Clearly he’d missed something. Or chosen the wrong combination of drugs. Or underestimated the amount of testosterone in the cocktail — that would account for John’s ability to restrain himself. He’d assumed the suspect’s previous drug use would have impacted the drug’s effects, but he had thought…well, it made no difference now.
Sherlock watched as John checked it over, looking for damage. He couldn’t help the smile that crept across his face.
John started as the pen dropped from his nerveless fingers. He knew his mouth was hanging open.
“John,” Sherlock breathed.
“Oh. OH. Oh, I see,” John started. “Right. Okay. And your brother’s name?”
________________________________
John grunted and tripped, falling sideways into the wall with a thud. Sherlock slammed into him, pushing the breath from his body. John wrapped one arm around Sherlock’s lean frame and held on, trying to regain his own balance and keep Sherlock upright.
His throat was raw and his body ached. His face was crusted and itchy. His clothing smelled of commercial cleaners from the carpet.
Sherlock dragged his tongue up and over John’s hip, nipped over the surface of his belly, and stopped briefly to suckle at his nipples before finally covering John’s mouth with his own.
“What experiments?”
John scrabbled at Sherlock’s scarf and dragged it away from the lovely pale skin of Sherlock’s neck. He fastened his mouth over the tender flesh.
“Look, love, I’m not going to pretend that I’m looking forward to childbirth or that I like the housekeeping or changing nappies. Yeah, it feels like that old-fashioned ‘omega’s work’ sometimes. But the thing is, physically I’m the one who has to have the babies. If I’d never bonded or had the boys, I would be so very, very lonely.”
“John, Sherlock, it’s so good to see you!”
“Brilliant. So strong.
As they had deliberately gone through his heat without protection, he’d felt it wise to start taking the supplements beforehand, though they had only just had their first visit with the midwife.
John wrapped both legs around his alpha’s body, kissing back like a thirsty man offered water.
Sherlock’s smile was not nearly so cocky now. His eyes were wide as he said, “Home. You called 221B
“Oh, look what I’ve done!” Jeanette reached into her pocket and produced a tissue.
But this was so very, very wrong. And it made him so, so hot.
John let that settle, turning to watch their kids playing happily together on the floor. Em and Drew had developed such a strong bond that they usually only fought when they were overtired. Em was almost always the leader. She would hand Drew toys and point to where she wanted them. She would pat him gently and he would say something to her in their shared language. It was sweet, and getting to watch his little one this way always made John feel a bit misty.
John allowed himself to be settled onto the mattress. Sherlock held his hand and helped ease him back against the pillows. He rolled onto his side and shifted back against the wall to make space for his mate. He rubbed gently over the mound of his belly as he watched Sherlock quickly strip.
“How so?”
,” Sherlock snapped. “I. Hate. It.”
Oh, god. What in the world could he possibly tell Rosie?
Sherlock shrugged with a cheeky quirk of his lovely mouth.
John to trust you with his…anything else? I mean actually used your words and told him what it is you would like?”
a drink, they
“Ah, well,” Sherlock began, clearing his throat. “I thought—it was meant to be a surprise, you see. That’s why I was out all day. Mycroft helped—”
“I refuse.”
Still swimming in a wash of pheromones, John offered no resistance as he was lifted from the floor and swung up into Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock did not stumble with the additional weight; adrenaline had given him strength beyond the capacity of his slender frame. John clung to him and murmured praise of his own.
As compensation for the services provided by John Watson under this Contract, Sherlock Holmes will pay John Watson £10 each time he provides his services.
‘’Sherlock, I was half asleep when we came back!’'
''On the contrary, I think you made too good of an impression.''
''Oi that's mine!'' I bellowed, lunging at him.
‘’Plus you said you’d agree to help me and you signed that contract.’’
‘’So how long is this experiment meant to last then?’’ I ask.
‘’That sounds like a personal problem. Keep it in your pants while I’m around or I’ll take my laptop away.’’
Oh how very unpredictable John was turning out to be!
Or at least there would be no need for embarrassment if I hadn't just pulled my pants down in front of Sherlock and his mother, who was standing with her mouth wide open, staring at my cock.
Sherlock got off the sofa and nodded his head, ''Good. Thank you, John.'' He rushed off to his bedroom, shutting the door without much care.
''You saw that then?''
Mrs. Holmes laughed and went out the door, turning back to whisper something to Sherlock. I leaned in trying to hear what she was saying but all I could make out was 'large' 'very nice' 'thrilled for you' 'use protection'.
Sherlock extends his hand and we shake. ‘’Deal.’’
‘’No.’’
Prick.
‘’No more nakedness or no more laptop.’’
''Thank you.''
Now I can't explain to you why I did what I did next. If this diary leeks out I'm sure I will have lots of questions from the lads at rugby as well as Scotland Yard and undoubtedly from Mrs Hudson, but I went to Sherlock's bedroom, opened the door, pulled my trousers and pants down and revealed my manhood (I wasn't hard but I'm easily a healthy 6 inches when flaccid, not too wide and I have more pubic hair than Sherlock and no complaints from partners thus far!)
‘’You wanted an examination and I have work soon so get on the sofa.’’ I looked at him, ‘’unless you don’t want to do this anymore.’’
I took my hands away from him, moving back. ''It's fine, Sherlock, it happens a lot actually. You're just reacting to stimulation. It's normal.'' It was normal. Although I said all that at an alarming pace.
Sherlock glanced at the drawing, ‘’Yes. Accurate no?’’
Signed.....
''I hope I haven't interrupted anything?''
I'm officially off the deep end.
I sighed. ‘’Get on the sofa and pull your pants down then.’’
‘’Sherlock, please I really feel uncomfortable with you doing this in front of me.’’
I managed to make my way downstairs to a thankfully fully clothed Sherlock sat at his desk typing away at my laptop (at this point shall I just call it ours?)
‘’Sherlock! This is the last straw, you need to stop putting body parts in the fridge.’’ I slammed the milk onto the counter top and stared at him. ‘’In fact stop bringing body parts home full stop.’’
''Right.'' Sherlock pulled his boxers off slowly, dropping them to the floor, revelling his member. Right.
[5 minutes later]
There are are many ways in which Sherlock is a shit flatmate, namely because:
I'm going to put this down to either boredom or another one of his weird experiments, either way I'd rather not have him use my laptop for this. He must have known I would see this, so what's he up to?
Is this how it’s going to be now? I set a boundary and he waves money at me and suddenly it’s OK?
''John, I don't believe you've met my mother have you?''
I rolled my eyes, the Holmes boys do have a flair for the dramatic.
''Oh right.'' He hastily took his trousers off but was a bit more reluctant with his boxers. ''Listen, John, I don't want you to judge me on my current size as-''
''Nothing!'' Sherlock and I said in unison.
After many apologies from myself and lots of sideways smirking glances from Mrs. Holmes, she left, giving Sherlock a kiss on the cheek, ''Thank you for the invite. I'll find a nice painting to put on your wall.'' She turned to me, ''John, so lovely to uhm...meet you. Hopefully see you again at some point?''
I think I need a lie down after that.
‘’Thanks. Yes I was having a lovely dream till you disturbed me.’’
''Not likely, dear brother!'' Sherlock said in a sarcastic sing song voice as he slammed the door shut. He turned round looking at me, and I clutched you close to my chest, not prepared for another fight.
I was woken up today by Sherlock banging on my door, shouting ‘’Sex experiment, sex experiment, sex experiment!’’ I think someone is too eager for me to join.
I went and knocked on Sherlock’s door but no answer. I’ll try again later.
Anyway, cut to me going into Sherlock’s hospital room and sitting on the side of the bed.
‘’What contract?’’
‘’Afraid not.’’
‘’Sherlock for fucks sake it’s seven o’clock!’’ I shielded my eyes as I walked into the kitchen, grabbing a mug out of the cupboard. ‘’Do you have no shame?’’
‘’Focus on one experiment at a time and find somewhere else to put them,’’ I pointed at the eyes and the fingers that were strewn around the kitchen. ‘’It’s getting ridiculous. I’d rather find you naked in the living room than decomposing fingers and eyes lying around everywhere.’’
This was a shit idea. What grown man writes a diary for God's sake! Ella suggested it might help now that we're stopping therapy- ''It might help you continue opening up''- I told her I don't want to open up- I'll stay very much down, thank you. She even gave me a replica of a diary she had long ago- ''I had a similar diary when I was younger, the store owner told me it was magic!'' She passed it over, giving me a wink. Magic my arse.
Sherlock shook my hand and smiled, ''Pleasure doing business with you, John.''
Well diary what an eventful few days it's been! You know how I said it was quiet? Well a half hour later I came back from the shops to find Sherlock, stark bollock naked in front of the mirror dangling his little sherlcock about!
''How about if I pay you? Five pounds every use.''
‘’Most people notice change within three to six months but I’ve extended it to a year.’’
''What?'' Sherlock looked at me all innocent.
'Please.'' He reached out and took my hand and I couldn't let him down. Let it be known that John Hamish Watson doesn't leave a mate in distress. Even one that was naked from the waist down.
‘’Oh it is but I thought it might help to analyse other people. Their likes, preferences, girth etc."
I walked into the kitchen, finding it spotless. All the dirty plates had been cleaned and put away, the counter tops and the table had been cleared and a note on the fridge read:
[That evening]
I picked up the bottle of pills ‘Xylazine’ ‘’Sherlock, these are for horses! How many did you take?’’
''Erm, Sherlock, mate, your pants?''
''No deal.''
''But you do most of your masturbating on the weekends!''
When she had left I turned to Sherlock, ''I don't think I made a good impression there.''
‘’How about you help me?’’
I raised an eyebrow, ‘’Sherlock, you know most of those pills are bullshit right? No reputable medical organisation or doctor recommends them.’’
I thought I’d seen something! I hope he didn’t see me flexing with Lightning and Thunder, the names of my (slowly diminishing) biceps saying '’Looks like there’s a storm coming in.’’
''Spread your legs a little.'' I knelt down slightly. ''Are you sure it's Ok to...touch you?''
4) He drags me around to cases (which isn’t the problem as y’know me and danger) but often times there’s no stopping for hours and I’m nearly 40! A man needs a cup of tea and a nap now and again.
“Oi, freak,” she said. “Don’t touch anything while I’m gone.”
“Oh.”
The Eighth British army, which included the 1
John stiffened, waiting now for the moment that had prompted his visit. Kit dropped his head to his grandmother’s shoulder and turned his face toward her neck. John’s breath caught as he heard his son snuffling for his alpha grandmother’s scent…
Sherlock sighed and let his head loll to one side. “John,” Sherlock moaned. “Sir…”
John chuckled. He shifted in closer to Sherlock once more, not at all surprised when his alpha caught his hips and dragged them close. He hissed as Sherlock greedily buried his face in John’s groin and pulled John’s cock between his lips. “Gently, love. Be careful—
"God, yes."
Mycroft entered the sitting room, two of his larger dark-suited “assistants” following in his wake. He began his perusal of the room with a disdainful sniff.
Sherlock turned in John’s arms and cupped John’s face between his long-fingered hands. He regarded John carefully, as John did him. They searched each other’s features for the certainty they both felt.
John whined a bit at the stretch as the last few inches slid home.
Puzzled, Greg was about to remark that John was remarkably dry (including his hair) for someone who’d just been in the shower when a rumpled mass of white appeared in the kitchen.
_________________
John gave him a look that expressed his dismay at this suggestion. Sherlock sighed.
“Of course,” Sherlock said, ducking his head. “Tea?”
John sighed, straightening and rubbing at the small of his back. “I don’t know—can you transform a six-foot wanker of a detective into a responsible grown up?”
“Of course it does!” Sherlock blurted.
Perspiration-slicked skin pressed and slid. Fingers teased and dug in. Lips gently nipped and tasted. Sherlock slithered over John’s body, mouthing his way over his omega, muttering his praise for his potential mate into John’s flesh.
“I thought maybe we could take a mini-break somewhere? I know they’ve closed travel to Spain again, but France is nice this time of year. Or we could just do a little hotel up in the Lake Distri—”
“When it became clear that wasn’t the case, I started doing some research into broken bond babies. That’s when I learned it was possible. There have been only five documented cases, but it is possible,” John said. “Pregnant omegas whose alphas were missing and presumed dead—injured badly enough or dead just long enough to cause a broken bond—but whose unborn babies somehow, miraculously, bypassed the process. All five were born within weeks of the broken bond instinctively knowing that something was missing. They KNEW their alpha parents were alive.”
John cleared his throat. “So, uhm, when do we get started with everything?”
“Oh, she loves us. Desperately. And she wants us to be proud of her. But she has no interest in the strange sort of life that we lead. She likes going to parties and spending time with friends. She wants to be an artist.”
“Guess I have a bit of a weakness for watching you strip.”
“Oh, fine.” Sherlock sighed. “And don’t think because Daddy and Papa are hugging that we’re not fully aware of those tomato bits going on the floor, young man.”
“Why did you tell me this?”
John continued to hold Sherlock’s hand, clasping it to his chest with both of his own. They both turned to stare up at the ceiling as they rested side by side in companionable silence.
“John,” Sherlock began tentatively, interrupting John’s reverie.
“And he is a very bright, very intuitive little boy.”
Sherlock wet his lips with the tip of his tongue. Even thinking about them made his mouth water. It was strange to think that in the few short months they had been engaged in a sexual relationship, he had become so enamoured of this one particular feature. Fondness, he called it. Preference.
“With me. I’ll stay with you for an additional 24 hours, to allow some more time for the swelling to go down. Major Hastings will send the ambulance back then and — well, we’ll just have to see how we get on.”
“And some French.”
John noted vaguely that the room had been ransacked during Sherlock’s pre-rut. It was clear he’d been scenting the space and preparing a nest: the bed had been reimagined, completely swaddled in lengths of fabric and Sherlock’s own clothing. Equally clear was that Sherlock hadn’t taken kindly to being kept from his chosen omega. Books had been thrown everywhere, furniture upended.
He’d been bothering John about it since they returned home from picking Kit up at the crèche.
“Sherlock, what did you do?” The doctor stepped cautiously into the room, turning and staring. He made a complete rotation, taking in the new décor. “It’s Beatrix Potter. Emily loves Beatrix Potter.”
“I missed you,” John continued softly, brushing the backs of his knuckles over Sherlock's now-bare chest.
Sherlock’s eyes glazed over as his body pitched into bliss, his omega’s words triggering some kind of alpha response that brought on a hard, almost painful orgasm. Sherlock shouted John’s name, burying himself to the hilt.
Somehow, John had expected more than a little to-do when they finally arrived at Mycroft and Greg’s new townhouse. He was not disappointed.
“At last,” John breathed into Sherlock's ear along with the song.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied. “Yes, I think we are.”
“Christ, you’re tight. Easy. Nice and slow. That’s it. Can you feel me filling you up?” John continued the comforting patter as he began to rock back and forth where he was.
“Oh, and about the hands-on experience?” John began. “Don’t worry about it. I think you’re going to be brilliant.”
Sherlock sighed. “I’m fine, thank you, doctor.” He extended his hand, uncurling fine-boned, long fingers. “Your phone?”
“Pop! Pop! Pop!” Drew cried.
And so they had. With all the ups and downs of Sherlock’s “death” and return, they had muddled through and figured things out as they went.
The girl looked Greg up and down. “Ooo, yes. That might be nice.”
“So what drew you to Sussex?” Francine asked.
“Not bloody likely,” John chuckled. “Can you imagine me in a frilly frock, trying new recipes and recovering the sofa cushions?”
“Dates. Oh, god. I didn’t think. Oh, shit.”
“Ditto,” John grinned.
John nodded his acknowledgment with a tight smile.
Sherlock shook his head.
“I love you, Sherlock,” John breathed. “So much. I w-want this forever. Say you’ll marry me. Please.”
“Guess I did. Not that I want to have to go around shooting serial killers on a regular basis, but it seems to me you might need saving from time to time.”
“But he flirted with you!”
John grinned at him. “Have you ever thought…I mean what you can do—have you ever considered doing something else with your talents?”
John was his. He may not deserve him, but he had him. He would not allow them to tarnish that.
John typed up the referral and hit print. "Is there anything you need in the meantime? We could discuss an anti-depressant."
John pulled back, quickly noting the colour in Sherlock’s cheeks.
“I’ve been asked to tell you that it was a misunderstanding and to insist that you accompany me to the Holmes residence.”
The skull. Vessel for the human brain. A protective shell for that which Sherlock deemed most valuable. And yet, skulls were an important reminder of the transience of human life. Everyone dies. Everyone is reduced to a skeleton and—eventually—to dust.
The tall man swallowed, his chin setting at a stubborn and—John thought—somewhat petulant angle. He shook his head.
“OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD!” He clung to the bed, desperate now to avoid blowing his load before John had given him leave. He pushed his throbbing prick into the bed hard, holding there in frustrated desire as John plundered his crack.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed. He clasped at the hand that had slipped beneath his lapel to settle over his pectoral muscle. He bit his lip as John began to massage gently. The fabric of his dress shirt brushed rhythmically over his nipple and a thousand tiny sparks travelled the length of his torso to his penis. He swallowed a gasp and leaned into the touch.
"I called a few days ago. About the antique mother of pearl magnifying glass?"
“I said STOP IT!!” John shouted.
Sherlock ground his huge, hot cock into John’s bum. John moaned and began to slide his hands down, down…
“You can speak with DI Lestrade if you’re that worried. My brother has probably already sent the number over with my other details.”
“Yes? What is it?” John panted, still holding Sherlock’s face with both hands to keep it near his own. He never wanted to be done kissing the man beside him.
“South,” Mycroft interjected. “Sussex, perhaps.”
They moved together, bodies—and souls, perhaps, if one believed in such things—as one. It was, Sherlock supposed, the way it was always meant to be. Sherlock and John. Holmes and Watson. Inseparable.
“Listen,” he started, his voice soft and a bit rough. “We can’t do this here. Do you understand? We need to get somewhere private, yeah?”
Sherlock leapt from the bed and reached back for John. “Come on. You've got to clean up your mess.”
“Were you able to send my message?”
“But how do I punish you, hmm?” John waited until Sherlock had stopped immediately in front of him, right beside the bed. He let the end of the belt drag on the floor beside him. “I don’t think very much frightens you, does it?”
It came about on a perfectly ordinary Tuesday, following a case involving the theft of some rare manuscripts from a private collection. He'd attended the crime scene alone, as sometimes happened when John had locum work. The case hadn't been terribly trying, and so—with only a few quick texts to John—he found himself at New Scotland Yard.
“Oh, god!” John withdrew and thrust in once more; Sherlock relished the slick, juicy noise created by the movement. John quickly eased himself into an easy rhythm, both of them enjoying the languid pace and moist friction.
“Sherlock,” John breathed. “Oh, god, yes. Use your teeth…FUCK!”
He hadn’t called for air support this time.
He stood as the door opened for a tall, distinguished gentleman in a conservative three-piece suit. The man walked toward John, an umbrella hooked over one arm.
Sherlock choked on the last word and sputtered a little, and then began to cough. The spasm continued for several minutes. John waited and at last lifted Sherlock’s head to offer him a sip of water. Sherlock received it gratefully, eyeing John over the tin cup.
Footsteps approached rapidly from behind and suddenly Sherlock found himself being crowded face first into the wall.
"Anthea go flirt with Molly. Or don't. I don't care just go away. And let my brother know that I am going to murder him when he gets here for lying to me."
I’m closer and closer to getting that new laptop each day!
His eyes went wide and his cheeks flushed pink.
‘'I'd rather you didn't. Also, I don’t know why you’re doing this experiment, y’know. I assume this other one is yours? Judging by the size I’d say you’re average.’’
Feeling bad I decided to make him a cup of tea and pick up a takeaway for dinner(not that he will eat all of it). I walked back into the living room to grab my shoes and found the berk lying on the sofa, naked once again with my laptop.
‘’Why not? You’re a doctor.’’
‘’Whatever helps you sleep at night, John.’’
''Fine, no diary and I get to use the laptop through the week and you have the weekends.''
Before leaving, Ella wished me luck and told me to ''trust the magic, John, it will do good things for you!''
and will terminate on the
‘’Oh John, please don’t be humble I’ve seen you naked.’’
Sherlock rolled his eyes, ‘’I get bored of doing it in my bedroom. This keeps it interesting.’’
''You tell me, Sherlcock.''
Sherlock looked up at me, giving me a wink, ‘’Certainly was an eyeful.’’
Well at least if this carries on I can buy a new laptop.
‘’Ouch you berk!’’
''Mhm i-it's fine,'' Sherlock answered, adjusting himself.
''Now you're the one who is embarrassed.''
‘’Yes you did after we came back from the hospital I asked you to read it and sign it.’’
He turned bright red. ‘’I don’t mean that! I just mean you help me research pills, forms of exercise and other things that may prove or not prove you can grow your...penis.’’
Signed......
Sherlock Holmes (''Party 1'') shall 'employ' John Watson (''Party 2'') on a full time basis (taking into consideration Party 2's part time job). In this capacity, John Watson shall have the following duties and undertake the following responsibilities:
''And a little boy you shall be no more.'' I got daggers for saying that and he huffed off to his room. At least I know what he's doing now, albeit it's very strange.
My index finger lightly brushed over the head of his cock and Sherlock let out a small moan. I froze. He froze. We both froze with my hand still wrapped around him and I noticed it had started to get erect.
‘’I don’t want to be average, John.’’
‘’Well can we work it into the deal because I’d rather not see you spread out to the world this early in the morning.’’
''I don't care about the laptop!''- I do!- ''I mean my diary, give it back!''
''Although hopefully not quite as much as you saw today," Sherlock said, smirking and I shot him a look.
''Yeah backfired didn't it?''
‘’N-n-no I want to.’’ Sherlock jumped from his chair, and moved to the sofa, lying down. ''I'm ready.''
‘’I thought we agreed you could do this sex experiment if you did it in your bedroom and I didn’t have to see anything.’’
John Watsons's employment under this Contract shall begin on the

''Fine I won't touch your diary if I can use your laptop.''
''I've not tried anything yet, first I'm doing performance based experiments as I am now and then see if it changes at the end.''
''I know but-''
''Does this have anything to do with the website you were looking at the other day.''
‘’I’ll give you another ten pounds,’’ He wafted the money at me and me being of high morales and much dignity didn’t take the money. Until a minute later.
Diary I think I have entered into a deal with the Devil. I gave up trying to get my laptop back so I went out for a walk, hoping when I came back that he had finished manhandling himself, which he had. However, in one hand he was balancing my laptop and in the other, YOU!
5) He leaves his experiments everywhere! Eyeballs and toenails in cups of tea, fingers in the freezer and the unfortunate time I brought a date home and they found half a brain in the bathroom sink.
***********
Dear Diary,
Deal with the Devil indeed.
Sherlock groggily smiled at me as I helped him sit up. ‘’Those pills, I think you were right.’’
, unless otherwise stated.
I thought about it for a while (ten seconds) and extended my hand out. ''Deal.''
I chose to ignore that as I carried on making the tea, pulling out another mug for Sherlock. ‘’So how is the experiment going?’’
''Jo-John I-''
I rolled my eyes. ‘’I’ll take the compliment. But I thought this experiment was about you not me?"
I smiled, shaking my head. ‘’OK fine, carry on but don’t say I didn’t warn you.’’
''SHERLOCK GIVE ME BACK MY LAPTOP!'' I banged on his door but he just increased the volume. Nothing is sacred in this flat anymore.
This Sex Experiment Contract (the ''Contract'') is made of this day on the
Sherlock frowned, his mouth turning into a pout. ‘’No need to be uptight about it.’’
He smiled as I sat down next to him. ‘’Hello, John. Or should I say my knight in shining armour?’’
I moved his foreskin back, running my fingers along the length and squeezing slightly to check for any tender areas. ''How does this feel?'' I asked.
I stared him, ‘’Sherlock, I don’t want to have sex with you.’’
''Oh I intend to,'' Sherlock said, grabbing the laptop and skipping off to his bedroom.
Bugger. So far I’ve only got £30 from Sherlock. I’m either going to have to ask for a raise at work or get more money from Sherlock.
I stared him, giving him a small smile and watched as he walked to his bedroom.
‘’Sherlock is that meant to be my cock?!’’
He glared at me, ''Don't call it a willy that's for little boys.''
He slapped me on the arm and quite hard too.
Sherlock lied on his bed, head hitting the pillow and stared up at the ceiling. He couldn't believe that John had just gotten naked in front of him (and his mother but he'd already blocked her out from the mental picture he was gathering). His drawing had been accurate, although it was interesting to see it in greater detail this time around.
(See the end of the chapter for
After this mornings events I went back to my bedroom for a bit and sat on my bed. I thought I had better start getting ready for work soon but I couldn't seem to get my mind off what happened. I understood why Sherlock got all weird about growing hard but plenty of patients had done it, it's just one of those things. I don't know why but I couldn't shake the feeling that he's not as active as he claimed to be. I don't know, it's just weird that I may be one in a handful (ha ha) who has touched him like that. I hope he isn't too embarrassed, his penis looked fine (from a medical view of course).
A moment of silence passed while Mycroft let it sink in.
I walked out the door and went to the nearest ally to cut across several streets to loose Mycroft. Three blocks over I turned to another ally and dug in my pockets for the pills, knowing it wouldn't be long before Mycroft was hunting me.
“Please, Sherlock. Just no.”
"It's okay—"
“More of
He had not yet put on his suit jacket for the day, but he was otherwise dressed for the visit he had intended to pay to the Yard. Of course, that was before John had turned up, looking very fetching in jeans and the shirt with the blue check that had always reminded Sherlock of his eyes. John was free from the surgery (and from relationship/wedding…things) for the day and looking to be helpful.
“You know you can always stay for tea, if you like.” Greg checked his watch. “My is due home any minute. He’s going to work at home for a bit and then he’s mine for the rest of the day.”
“And what is that supposed to mean?”
John stopped then and moved in. He wrapped one arm around Sherlock’s waist and flattened the other palm over his chest. Their bodies nestled together; John laid his cheek into the space between Sherlock’s shoulders.
“Please listen to me, Sherlock,” John started, his voice husky. He reached across and placed a hand on Sherlock’s knee. “I would happily do whatever you asked of me if it meant I could be near you. But seeing you again — I don’t think you understand what it means to me.”
John cocked his head as he regarded Sherlock’s expression—which Sherlock knew was probably very revealing.
John stared at the food in front of him as Mary sat in the chair across the table.
“Yes?” Sherlock prompted again.
“Peter Rabbit?” Greg repeated, mirroring her enthusiasm. “Well, that sounds splendid.”
“Oh, do you three know each other?” Michael enquired.
Sherlock nodded solemnly, thinking that John really must get out of the habit of thanking him in doorways when
Sherlock smiled weakly before glancing down to the spot where John had clasped their hands together. “Part time is better than no time at all—if you think Mary should retain custody. If you want to raise the baby, I’ll…help. I’ll be rubbish at it, but I can learn. I want to help you be a father, if that’s what you want.”
“I know,” Mycroft agreed. “I’ve checked the paediatrician’s records as well. Kit’s doctor is concerned about his upset—the interrupted sleep patterns and decreased appetite—and his height and weight. She’s been vaguely referencing ‘failure to thrive,’ and there are some unpleasant suspicions about John’s abilities as a parent. I fear that if we cannot help John with Kit’s health we may be facing a much more serious situation.”
“Okay.”
Sherlock watched him cross the room through heavy-lidded eyes. “What are you doing?”
John nodded and smiled. His gaze shifted from Sherlock’s eyes to his mouth. Sherlock’s lips parted unwittingly, tongue peeking out to dampen them.
“Sir?” Sherlock tried.
By the time they reached 221, John was hard and desperate. They hurried inside and kissed as they shed clothes up the stairs and down the hall to their room.
“Uh, well, he was. I…wasn’t. So much.”
“Most importantly—and this cannot be overstated—a tiny human being will be relying on the two of us for their very life! They will continue to need us for about
Mycroft blinked at him, clearly at a loss for words. Far too rare, in Sherlock’s opinion.
John turned then and walked back to the sofa. “Shall we?”
“Louise—come on in,” he said eagerly. “Everything all right?”
Sherlock sighed. "But I don't want it to happen. I don't like feeling like this, but…”
“A man’s body beneath your hands; fewer curves and more angles.”
“I know that, but…well, she’s such a tender-hearted creature. She is—thank god—nothing like her mother. I think she’s got the best bits of you and I. But she wants so badly to make us happy that I worry she’ll chose a life she doesn’t really want.”
John looked down into the face of a boy, about 10 years old. He was sitting next to an older woman in a kerchief (his grandmother?) who was holding his hand very tightly. “Yes?”
“You smell like heat,” Sherlock said softly.
“He’s brilliant, isn’t he?”
Sherlock hummed his delight into John’s sensitive teat, dropping his hand to wrap around John’s cock.
“Why must we go through this every time someone gets older?”
“Please don’t concern yourself. It’s just the dust in this old pile.”
“I never guess,” Sherlock argued, trying hard to sound offended.
John stood right in front of his mate, his temper simmering. “One: Your brother is clearly having a crisis and you let our son use him as a sketch pad.”
He was just about to remove his trousers and pants when he heard footsteps coming up the stairs. His heart leapt in his chest.
Sherlock stopped dead and turned to watch his pregnant mate struggling to keep up. He flushed with embarrassment. “Sorry! I’m sorry, John. I didn’t mean to—are you all right?”
“Mmmmmmy John.”
“What did you really think of the first place, John?” Michael asked sociably, keeping pace with John while Sherlock fell in behind them.
Holmes blinked at him. “Do you think so?”
“She’s always been happy,” Sherlock replied thoughtfully. He was ignoring John’s hand slipping between the strands of his salt-and-pepper hair. It was still curly, though considerably less fussy than it used to be. Less product, too, which John enjoyed.
“I blame
John sipped his tea and then took another bite of his sandwich. He sighed, soaking in the sunshine as they sat in the window of the old pub.
John face softened and he leaned in for a kiss—just a brief, chaste pressing of lips. “It certainly is.”
“You should keep watching, brother dear,” Sherlock taunted gently, never taking his eyes from John. “You just might learn something.”
“Shhh!” Sherlock grasped John’s hand to keep him from surging forward to help. “Let him go. He’s had lots of practice.”
He followed Sherlock down the steps, and then waited while Sherlock held the front door for him.
“No.” John shook his head and crossed his arms over his chest, a sinking feeling pulling at his guts. A madman, then.
John chuckled and petted his hair. “Sleepy?”
“Wait,” he said softly. “Slowly.”
to try some?”
“You know,” John began, “I have a good friend in the asthma and allergy clinic at Royal Brompton. They’re running new trials for kids and teens with asthma.”
“No. Don’t!”
“Sherlock, I like you.” John tugged at Sherlock’s suit jacket until Sherlock shrugged out of it, and then set to work on the buttons of his shirt. “I know that seems strange, given how we met and how recently. It’s strange to me, too. I don’t usually…that is…I don’t take to people easily. Never have. But you are different. I can’t explain to you how I know, but I just do.”
“Dunno. When you saw the place was listed and cooked up this scheme, I did make sure to include specific details in our programme application that would ensure we’d get his place on our list. Unfortunately, the producers haven’t said anything about the sellers of the places we’re to look at.”
“Come take my picture!” she called.
“What is the point of this one?” Greg asked, puzzled.
“NO! Please no!”
“What, the painting?”
Sherlock gazed at his friend, his John, for the first time allowing his deep and abiding affection and desire for the man to be reflected in his expression without restraint. It was probable John wouldn’t remember all (or, hopefully, any) of it. In all likelihood, John would return to Mary, blissfully unaware that Sherlock had been harbouring inappropriate fantasies about him since the day they met. Not remembering a moment of this day to be troubled by his infidelity, or his departure from the strictly heterosexual.
“I will be fine. I am a big boy Mycroft. And having Sherlock with me will help.”
John leaned up and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s, a soft gentle kiss. After a moment Sherlock deepened the kiss, licking against Johns bottom lip. He sighed a contented sigh and let Sherlock in twining his tongue with that of his detective before allowing Sherlock complete control. When they came up for air John looked to Sherlock’s kiss swollen lips and debauched hair and started to laugh.
Piss off Mycroft, or I will call Mummy, and remember that she still doesn't know that I am alive. Do you really want to deal with that? -SH
We rode the five floors down in silence after I put in a code on the panel on the wall, every once in a while with a muffled sniffle from Mrs. Hudson.
Love John
Dear Sherlock,
Sherlock knew he had less than two minutes to break in before Mycrofts people would be there to remove him, if even that much time. He moved swiftly to the back door, trying the handle to find it locked.
John projected soothing emotions forcing his scent to switch to protector rather than enraged, to calm down his stressed omega.
His last words are chocked off with a spattering of blood from his mouth.
"I'm so sorry Sherlock, if I hadn't listened to Donovan and Anderson."
"Yes Mr. Holmes I know you know all this but forgive me the formalities must be addressed." Abigail said. "Doctor Watson, I'm sorry but you have quit your job at the surgery for the moment. Your resignation was accepted with heavy heart and you are more than welcome to come back once you are ready. We also provided a qualified replacement for you."
“You poor man.”
"Oh Sherlock, we will be together again soon. Wait for me."
He was late in getting home which went totally against his schedule. Lestrad didn't have a case for him and he should have arrived thirty minutes ago, even if he had walked. My nerves were ever unsettled, so I started the hunt, looking everywhere that he may have gone. All his usual hunting grounds were bare of any trace of him.
"Beautiful." John ran his hands over the newly exposed flesh, creamy white and smooth. Sherlock let out a deep moan when John pressed down on his left nipple, bringing it to a stiff peak. He leaned down and licked just the tip, Sherlock bucked against John, moaning louder.
It was supposed to just be an ordinary case, just like any other, but of course there is no normal case with Sherlock Holmes. The brilliant detective kept everyone on their toes, and made all of us forget that the was an omega. Headstrong, feisty, stubborn, he acted more like an Alpha.
“Sherlock’s room is right across the hall and John will be in the hospital area three doors down on your left for the time being.”
“Yes please.”
“So that is how you kept track of him?”
John lunged at Anderson grasping his upper arms, his teeth bared menacingly as he slammed Anderson into the wall relishing the way his head smacked hard. Anderson growled at John, kicking him in the leg, trying to bring him down. John absorbed the blow, enraged he punched Anderson hard in the face, smiling at the sound of his nose breaking.
Molly sat there contemplating everything, contemplating what Sherlock had indeed done. It was like watching the fierce kitten realize that she wasn’t going to get her fight.
"Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson, we need to speak with you about your security."
“Of course. He was also placed on top watch security per your request.”
"It was our, your brother and my opinion that you would be reckless if you knew. We kept an eye on him."
“Very well Molly, my name is Anthea. We are currently in the underground bunker. Five floors down and with all the top notch defenses available. This is the only way in or out. Down this hall you will find various offices, and rooms. All doors are locked with the exception of the common area, kitchen and hospital.”
“It’s over. Put your hands up, this doesn’t have to.” Sherlock’s sentence was cut off short as Anderson crashed into Sherlock, knocking the gun under him as he was dragged to the ground by the feral alpha. The gun pressed hard into Sherlock’s rib cage, leaving bruises in its wake.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What about Mrs. Hudson?”
I would have to find a place outside of the flat to take them as well. I knew that Mycroft had the place bugged. So the park or a back alleyway, maybe even by the Thames. I pulled on my jacket and grabbed my wallet and keys and strode out of the flat. The air was dark and the promise of rain hung in the air.
"Gents were here." The cabbie spoke up from the front.
“Please keep track of this key card as you’ll need it to get in and out of your room just tap the card to the scanner.”
“That is most definitely for the best.” I could tell that she was silently fuming, the tension getting higher and higher.
"Your skin is like ice Gregory and you are shivering uncontrollably. You are going to be checked out or I will make you."
Sherlock’s voice broke the heavy silence. Anthea gently placed her hand on Mrs. Hudson's shoulder and led her and Molly out of the room. No doubt she would tell them. The doctor finished dressing Sherlock’s wound and excused himself from the room.
Mycroft just glared at Sherlock.
“Nothing that you don’t already know about. The woman has been following John around, she’s smart and quick, and it appears that we have a leak on my side of the fence. Every time we move to take her down she slips off at the last second. “
Both men looked at him in utter disbelief but they both knew that no matter what they said Mycroft wouldn't bend a quick glance at one another and both came to the agreement that it was the best they were going to get in their situation.
We sat together in silence while we waited, her eyes never left her phone. It's amazing she hadn't developed carpal tunnel. I took out my phone checking through emails for something to do.
“I know, but we need to get you home.”
I always thought he was fascinating, the man that lead the First Order. To have such power and responsibility was quite fascinating. After all that's what you told yourself when you squealed with joy at being assigned to protect the leader.
She paused in her typing, and looked at me. A trace of fear in her eyes.
"You are too good for my brother."
"My god you are lovely like that, open and wet just for me. Mine."
Sherlock goes to the one person who could tell him what he needed to hear.
"He owed me a favor. He just kept paying Mrs. Hudson and she never questioned it."
Sherlock let out a laugh of his own, "And I slept with 'not gay' John Watson."
"Well now that that's out of the way, Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson, you are not allowed to leave without one or both of us. If you do leave we will be forced to tranquilize you. Don’t even consider going out of any windows as we have them all under surveillance. Moran has been spotted in the area; he managed to get away from us. We’re not sure how but were working on all of the leads that we have."
Sherlock stood and started to pace, "Honestly brother, you think Moran will be stupid enough to comment?"
"No."
“About three times a week.”
“Oh Sherlock. I miss you more than you know.”
I jumped up from the desk and ran out to the car waiting for me. My driver got me to the hospital in record time. As soon as I arrived I was taken to the ICU where both Sherlock and Lestrade were being held. A doctor came right up to me and led me over to Sherlock’s bedside.
Out of my coat pocket I pull the pistol I took from him after my first death. Place the chamber to my temple and pull the trigger.
I nodded my head in ascent, "Please save him."
The leader pulled a gun out of his jacket faster than I could turn and run, the shot rang through the air as the bullet ripped into my stomach. I hit the ground hard, my head cracking on the pavement, the world blacked out before me for a moment.
"I'm so sorry John."
I lunged at the worm the moment he let off the shot, no one harmed my John. No one! Taylor's eyes flared wide, as I lunged at him.
It's time for you to come out little brother. -MH
Of course. No wonder Mycroft was so upset. "I'm guessing that they have backup people incase this lot failed."
"Taylor, drop your gun and you won’t get hurt."
"So close."
John agreed, pulling Sherlock's coat and suit jacket off, Sherlock shivered at the freeing feeling as John started to work on the buttons of his shirt.
"Lestrade I swear to God if you don't tell me what the fuck is going on I will murder you myself."
"It's alright! I forgive you as long as you promise to never leave me again."
"Then you better be ready to explain that to him. He's going to be in here in less than two minutes to pry me away from you. He thinks that I’m a hazard to your health. I suppose that I am but all the same I can't stand to be away from you either."
"Yes. Undoubtly you already know what I want to say, but I need to say it. Mycroft, I am sorry that I attacked you, when I was not doing well. I want to thank you though for protecting me from myself. I owe you a debt."
"Well then let’s humor him."
Sherlock reads Johns letters and learns how did his damage goes.
The two men came round my head and picked me up under each armpit while their boss grabbed my legs. The movement causing me to scream out in pain.
I promise this will be the last angsty fic for a while. (Most likely) Love you all! Star Trek Alternate Original Series (Kirk/Spock/Bones)
“Hey sunshine, what are you doing up here?”
“Were you followed?”
"You're real. You're really real." John mumbled against Sherlocks hand.
My gun would have been the optimal idea, quick, painless, little chance of failure. Moriarty proved that. Mycroft told me that he killed himself before you killed yourself. So what on earth could have made you jump?
"God you look a mess."
Sherlock looked between us, agreeing with my statement.
“Exactly Mycroft and you don’t want to argue with my doctor, now do you?”
John looked Sherlock up and down, ignoring the gathering scent in the air, formulating his words as he took Sherlock’s hand in his running his fingers up and down the palm leaving fire in his wake.
"I never meant to hurt him this bad."
“Ms. Hooper, Mrs. Hudson please follow me and I'll show you to your rooms. I apologize that they aren’t above ground but we need to be taking extra precautions right now.”
John pulled Sherlock tighter to his chest, noticing for the first time how much skinner he had gotten, pushing him back he really looked into his face, noticing the shadows under his eyes, the sharper cheekbones.
"Ugh, I should have killed him. Attacking you like that and letting that man get away. At least Lestrade and I got the other guy. And hopefully Lestrade will kick his arse."
"Yes John, all yours, only yours."
"Temporarily, one good run and you were as good as new." Sherlock replied nestling into John's neck, drinking in the protective scent of his Alpha. John reached around and pulled Sherlock closer, nestling his omega closer, covering him in his protective scent.
“We are going to your flat but you will not be allowed in until the sweep is confirmed clean.”
“Yes. It’s all good. Lets go home.”
I could feel his glare through his helmet.
“Sit down Sherlock and I will answer your questions.”
John shot a look of panic at Sherlock questioning if he should argue, but Sherlock just turned to face his brother. “Don’t worry John I will be right there.”
"And apparently your pain medication is taking effect."
He emptied the box and relocked it, depositing it back on the ground and pocketing the letters before striding out of the cemetery himself and going home to read his letters from John.
"Wonderful, yes just like that." John moaned from above his hands finding Sherlock’s head, twining with the hair there, gently guiding him. Sherlock kept up an even pace twirling his tongue around the engorged head, licking at the slit as his hands moved up and down twisting gently on every other thrust.
"Who cares let’s get this over with before anyone shows up. Doctor, nothing personal but were getting paid way too much to fuck this up."
Mycroft looked at his brother with sad eyes. Pity rang strong in his gaze.
So now that the pills and my gun were out. There was always heights, drowning, plenty of cars, and of course violent muggers. How many crime scenes had he been to with Sherlock that proved that it wouldn't be an impossibility.
It didn't take more than fifteen minutes before Sherlock’s doctor was standing next to me again.
“I apologize sir, I just want to make sure that you are safe.”
Dear Sherlock,
Sherlock went back to gently placing kisses along the scar, turning John around so that he could kiss the exit wound.
"Do you ever play Candy Crush on that thing?"
I slammed the kid hard into the wall, and launched punches at his midriff. I wasn't focused on the gun still in his hand. The first shot missed me; the second shot hit me right in the stomach doubling me over. The Third shot caught me in the hip. I could now understand what John went through, the pain, the shock. My body was shutting down, my mind folding under the strain. My last thoughts were centered on John though. Please God let him live.
Sherlock and John dodged a few more bullets before the leader got truly pissed and came to a full stop and took proper aim. Sherlock noticed immediately and  went to push his John out of the way. John however was quicker and immediately knew what Sherlock was about to do. John was able to shove Sherlock to the ground taking the bullet to his chest that had been at the perfect height to pierce Sherlock's heart, instead taking the bullet into his own lungs. The pain blinded John and made him black out as he hit the ground. Sherlock rolled as soon as he hit the ground and immediately sees John on the ground wheezing attempting to drag in breaths.
They were interrupted by a knocking at the flats door.
The first few months he wouldn't eat, wouldn't sleep, wouldn't do anything but breathe. I could see and feel his pain. I owe a great debt to Lestrade for keeping him from dying on me, for keeping him going when I couldn't.
Sherlock threw Lestrade an icy glare. “Piss off Lestrade.”
"Not at all."
“I’m not going anywhere John. You’re stuck with me now.”
“What is it Mycroft?”
"Well you could try."
The leader’s proclamation made me smile through the bone deep pain in my stomach. Blood poured out of the wound, staining the pavement more than Sherlock did.
"John."
John slowly pulled back just keeping the head in his mouth, licking at the underside of his penis, teasing the glans there. Sherlock’s hand found the back of John's head pushing him back down.
“It’s alright Mycroft. I may hate you at times but I trust that you will keep us safe.”
Sherlock smirked, “Of course there’s a leak on your side. I have three people who it might be but so far I have no solid evidence on which it is.”
John and Sherlock smiled as they kissed under the mistletoe. Mrs. Hudson couldn't have looked happier if she tried.
“Don’t suppose you called Lestrade did you?” John spit out as he caught up with Sherlock still chasing after the murderers.
I couldn't help but notice the black car that started to tail me two blocks ago. Mycroft naturally or at the very least one of his minions. I honestly didn't want to deal with them right now, and I knew he wouldn't want to cause a scene in public, so I ducked into the nearest cafe.
"I knew it was you the moment I shot the cabbie. I was just worried that you would never want me. A used up broken army doctor."
"Too many clothes."
"I will do my best sir." The doctor turned and a team of nurses came over to remove Sherlock.
"I love you too Sherlock." John replied as he twined his fingers with Sherlock’s, squeezing with love. Sherlock laid his head down on John's shoulder. "I knew it was going to be you from the first moment we met in Bart’s. There has never been anyone else more appealing to me."
Sherlock smiled as he leaned forward and pressed a kiss to John’s forehead as he pulled off John’s jumper and undershirt revealing his still toned chest, and the bullet scar that brought them together. It was shaped like a large starburst with a small dip in the center. He leaned down and kissed the center as his fingers traced down towards John's trousers, flicking the button open and drawing the zip down releasing some of the strain on Johns cock precum soaking his pants.
White hot fury sang through my veins. I crumpled to paper and threw it at the wall.
"John!" Lestrade let out the cry as he ran straight to where John went over and jumped in.
John stood up and walked with Emerson to the door but refused to go inside. Sherlock closed the car door, and turned to his brother.
“Ok go ahead and let it out before you explode.”
"No, once you start to go all the pain fades. You just feel warm and relaxed." John's voice was soft and sincere.
"I have to agree; when you two are together it's enough to make us want to puke." Anthea shot from the doorway.
John pulled the taller man to his chest, squeezing hard. "You are to never do that to me again."
"Pleasure to see you too Lestrade."
I nodded and we lulled into a deep silence while we finished our tea.
“I’m fine. The other one got away. Fucking Anderson. Good job by the way. Too bad you left him breathing.”
Silence while both brother contemplated all that it implied.
Pills would be my next step, Mrs. Hudson had all of my pills in her flat and delivered the daily amount herself and ensured that I would take them, so if I wanted to go that route I would need to go out and purchase some of my own.
"God Sherlock, if you keep that up I won’t last long."
"Mine, mine, mine." Muttered John as he kissed his way up Sherlock’s back finding his neck and the scent gland that was emitting the most amazing scent of Omega in coitus. John licked the skin around it biting down and nibbling the flesh in his teeth leaving a trail of bruises around Sherlock’s neck. Marking him as his and only his. Sherlock moaned at the massive cock buried in his arse, rubbing against his prostate on every thrust.
It was a quick five minute walk to the nearest Tesco; I grabbed a bottle of sleeping pills, and some anti-nausea pills. The cashier was friendly, and wished me a good day. Yes sweetie it was going to be a good day, because today was my last day.
Mycroft,
"Why do you want to bond with me?"
"I waited for you. I almost died for you."
"That's good my dear; I'm so happy for you both." She whispered as Sherlock just smiled at Mrs. Hudson knowing she was excited for them.
"And it will never happen."
"You're welcome Sherlock." John pulled Sherlock’s face towards him, placing gentle kisses on his lips.
Found a lead, going after the bastards. Send backup. - JW
"Small black coffee to go please."
"I want to see all of the surveillance." Sherlock spoke up.
"He's going to be brought to the estate as soon as he's able to be moved. We have more than enough resources there to take proper care of him."
Lestrades jaw dropped again. Surly Sherlock knew, didn't he? He turned to look at Anthea for conformation of his suspicion. She discreetly looked away, uncomfortable. Well fuck he had to know, who better to deliver bad news than a cop.
One of their new security officers opened the back door for them, “Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, welcome home. The place is clean.”
Also did I mention that the 365 days will not be everyday, life gets in the way.
"I love you." Sherlock said against John's lips.
They were escorted in by Emerson and a female partner. “We’ll be in 221A if you need anything sir’s. two more agents will be posted in 221C tomorrow morning when Mycroft selects them.”
"What the bloody hell Mycroft! You were supposed to be watching him today!"
Mycroft the package is arriving. They were followed. Get here soon. -A
"Sherlock, how much pain meds are you on?"
Sherlock stormed out of the building, went straight to Johns apartment and watched him through the window. It looked like he was writing another letter. He looked sad. Sherlock’s pocket buzzed a new text message.
John rolled over, burying his face in the covers. “Make it yourself.”
Mycroft and John exchanged looks, and both hurried after him.
“Unlucky for me,” John repeated flatly. “Unlucky for me that you shot me in the head for doing my
Sherlock rolled his eyes, more out of habit and an unfamiliar anxiety than actual frustration. “Your life is still yours. It is not someone else’s. It does not belong to them. If it came with a deed of ownership, it would still bear your name.”
John held his hands in the air defensively. “I’m just the formerly dead guy who sits here and makes tea. I know that just because I
“Fine, fine,” said John. “I was just wondering how it is you’re so good at breaking and entering.”
“You had better not be expecting a hug,” said Sherlock after a moment.
For which he would probably need another cup of tea.
He paused, looking up in surprise.
. Something big,” said Sherlock, not sure how to explain. Moriarty was on another level compared to most of the other criminals Sherlock had encountered. Was it wrong to want to know more, to want to learn how Moriarty had gotten away with his wrongdoings for so long? What was it that made him different? Sherlock had confronted criminals who were intelligent before, or ruthless, or established, or rich, or well-connected, or feared. But Moriarty was all of those things in some new, personalized, revolutionized form. He took risks only a madman would take, in schemes only a genius would think of, and got away with it.
John cleared his throat, and finally nodded, curtly.
i can't
“Don’t start that again,” said Sherlock.
John blinked, processing this rather businesslike proposal with a nod, and then a few more. “Uh, yeah. Yeah, actually, that would be good. Thanks.”
Sherlock grit his teeth. “So this is a threat.”
“About dying?” said Sherlock.
“I’ll be in touch,” said Sherlock once more, guiding her in the direction of Lestrade and ushering them both to the door. “Don’t worry.”
“I stitched it up.” John straightened, fixing his shirt and jacket. “I didn’t really like having a hole in my shoulder.”
“True.”
“When,” Mycroft managed after another long moment.
Sherlock frowned, and finally freed himself from Lestrade—“Sherlock!” protested John—to step into the main room, looking around.
John looked the woman up and down, frowning slightly. He looked questioningly at Sherlock.
“Then tell me.” Sherlock leaned forward. “Everything. Please.”
“Well,” Sherlock amended, looking even more cross, “he did
John snorted. “All right, now you’re just making fun of me.”
“Has it been long since your last doughnut, Lestrade? You sound tetchy,” drawled Sherlock, ever sympathetic, as he reached the DI.
“No idea,” said Sherlock, lifting one of the shoes to eye level and examining it. “But I’m going to find out.”
“Still, you got lucky,” said John, securing the bandage with a clip, before starting on the other ankle. “And I’m glad. I’d be happy to have nothing to do if it was because you weren’t a complete mess. But at least you’re okay. You may have had us worried. I was worried.”
Sherlock gave a laugh and opened the fridge to put things away.
Working as fast as I can to write in spite of juggling many projects at work, so stay tuned for the next update in a couple weeks. I promise to be true to my word and have regular updates for the rest of the summer!
The sniper might be their best lead. If they could find him, they could find Moriarty. As complicated as Moriarty’s web was, however interlocked the individual threads, it only took following one critical string to reach the center.
“You’re lucky you have me to help you get justice for your murder, or you’d never get anywhere,” said Sherlock.
“Sherlock,
“Shame. It’s the most interesting part,” replied Sherlock, which earned a bemused look from John.
But Young Sherlock could not risk the dangers that emotional attachments posed. He could not be tied to anyone. Even one person brought with them great risk. No, the only logical way to proceed was to sever ties with everything and everyone, starting at that young age and continuing on, for the rest of his life.
“Are you okay?” John asked.
Mycroft scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Come on, Sherlock,” he snapped impatiently.
“Wake up,” said Sherlock flatly. “Lestrade called with news.”
“Is he ever not working?” said their landlady knowingly, stepping over the threshold carrying a tray laden with things for tea for John and Sherlock.
When Sherlock returned to the Intelligence Service building, making his way to a courtyard along one side, he found that it and the surrounding area had become swarmed by all manner of emergency response vehicles and personnel in the intervening minutes. A small crowd of people were clustered near parked ambulances, and Sherlock made a beeline for them, ducking under police tape lining the perimeter. Smoke was still curling into the air from the back of the building, but an atmosphere of businesslike calm had settled over the assembled people.
Sherlock paused, frowning, looking at the ruined building. “Well,” he said finally, “if the point was to kill me, it wasn’t very effective. If the point was to get my attention…”
Sherlock could not believe it.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “By which you mean I was nearly your next victim?”
Because there had been something unbearably lonely, but also unbelievably comforting, in the knowledge that he was the only exception to the universe’s rules about the permanence of death.
Sherlock smirked. “Probably. I still admire him for it, though.”
“No,” said Mycroft, with a refusal in his voice that didn’t quite reach his eyes.
Well, it couldn't be
Sherlock ignored him and scanned the message.
Sherlock grabbed John’s notebook and pen off the coffee table—eliciting an annoyed “Hey!” from John—and flipped to a blank page, where he started writing down names.
Both Mycroft and Sherlock looked at him abruptly, and it was almost comical how much they looked alike when they were both wearing matching scowls.
John smiled thinly, and when Mycroft fell silent, John turned his back on him, and slipped out into the hall.
Mycroft looked between them with some uncertainty, and then he closed the door and held up the file folder he had brought with him. “I have some information about Moran. As much as his name and origin can give us, at least. For the most part, it simply confirms what we already knew or guessed. After Moran died in Afghanistan, his body was flown back to London, and then on to be officially buried—where he vanished from the funeral parlor, it seems. His death was in the papers, though the coverage wasn’t especially in-depth or widespread. And his name was known in military circles for breaking a few records for long-range sniping in the field. If Moriarty was
John Watson, at age thirty-five years, twenty-one days, seventeen hours, and four minutes, had been stationed on active service in Afghanistan for five weeks and two days when the call went over the radio.
There was a loud
Sherlock rolled out of bed, tugging on his robe. He made his way into the living room, glancing around for John, and when he didn’t find him, he picked up a pillow off one of the chairs and made his way up the stairs towards the second bedroom.
Sherlock hurried back, facing John, looking from his face to the semtex on his chest to his face again. He set John’s gun down on the ground between them. “Are you all right?”
Sherlock had internalized this ideal so deeply that nothing had shifted his resolve in all the time since. His mind became a mighty palace, full of rooms and libraries and halls bursting with knowledge. Nothing had ever jeopardized the impenetrable walls he built to make sure the world stayed distinctly out, where it belonged, available for his dissection and study and nothing else. He'd become the Detective. Cold, cool, and calculating.
John stayed still in front of him, obviously wary of making any movements while there were sniper lights trained on his chest. But he was all attention as well, his eyes fixed on nothing while he was listening instead.
Thank you all so much for reading - and thank you especially for your comments! :D <3
When they pulled up in front of 221B (Sherlock running one tire over the curb in his haste to park), Sherlock leapt out of the car and peered hopefully towards the front door. There was a part of him—an illogical and melodramatic part, perhaps, but a significant one nonetheless—that had been praying he would see distinctive yellow spray paint on the door. But it was spotless. The disappointment was enough to bring him to a halt on the sidewalk.
"God, Lestrade, not every investigation is as easy as a sixty second conversation."
Watson, Doctor Watson, Captain Watson, Mr. Watson, but
Sherlock burst out laughing.
"Well… okay," said Molly, and she held the door open for them.
John took a breath. “… Yeah.”
Watson frowned a little, though a smile pulled at the corner of his lips. "You," he said, clearly thrown off by Sherlock's lack of comprehension. "What you just said. Jesus, that was brilliant, I have no idea how you got that kind of information out of a few words from me. How did you do that?"
More apologies in end notes. For now --
Cabinet opening. Hollow thud suggesting the cabinet under the sink. Rummaging in a box. The sound of the faucet, and then the tear of paper towels. John’s footsteps around the kitchen then moved upstairs at a brisk walk, ascending, and then becoming quiet thumps as John dug around. Bathroom, then bedroom, Sherlock thought. His head hurt too much for this, but he couldn’t help himself. It was less effort to deduce than ask.
Sherlock’s face was doggedly stern, but he thought he might burst at the seams from holding back a laugh. “Can you
John put an arm under one of Sherlock’s and carefully raised him to off the floor, ignoring Sherlock’s protests and taking great care to keep the exposed skin of his own neck away from Sherlock’s hands.
After a while, he heard the distant opening and closing of the front door below, and Mrs. Hudson’s cheery voice from the sidewalk. She’d be gone all afternoon, most likely, visiting the flirtatious (and/or adulterous) Chatterjee next door at Speedy’s.
Sherlock’s heart beat faster.
That is, until the Detective.
John jerked his head back in a sharp snapping motion, and the back of his skull met with something solid. The grip around his neck immediately lessened, and John seized the opportunity to throw his elbow back, hard, into his attacker’s diaphragm. There was a grunt of pain, before their grip fell away entirely. John pulled free and half-rose in a crouch, spinning about.

“I had hoped Mr. Holmes would be able to find something of interest here. I know I’m just another case of the runaway wife, Doctor, but… God damn it!” Amberley suddenly growled. “When did I ever stop her from doing whatever she wanted? You’d be hard-pressed to find a man who treated his wife better, sir! And Ernest, he… he was practically my son… And here’s my thanks! She slinks off with my dearest friend, with all of my money. She took my account information, my cards, my cash… Everything. I just…” And here Amberley paused to look out the window as well, staring out towards the doghouses in the ramshackle backyard.
I might not be able to update Monday as planned, so here's an early update. I hope it's a good one!
“It’s not,” said Sherlock again. “It was my choice. My secret to tell. And it means a lot to me that you hadn’t told him when I arrived. I’m sure he threatened you.”
“They were placed at the site where Shan was killed,” said Sherlock. “That alone means something. They were strategically placed. Meant to get my attention.”
you to get me out of trouble.”
He touched Yao’s face again.
“And you are?” said Mycroft, standing a little straighter so he could look down his nose at John.
The Detective agreed.
Thanks! Cheers,
A sarcastic reply was halfway formulated in Sherlock’s mind when all activity ground to a halt, and started in reverse.
Sherlock looked at John as if he’d grown another head.
Sherlock barely had time to twist in order to get to his feet before a fist solidly connected with his face.
“You wanted me to follow,” said Sherlock. “So I can’t imagine why you’re complaining.”
Sherlock gave John a dry look, but he could feel the knot in his chest loosening, like the great Amazonian serpent curled around his ribcage had found these few trusting sentences satisfying, and was letting him go.
“Spit it out,” Sherlock snapped. “I know you have ideas. Concerns. Spit it out.”
“Not as good as yours, I think,” said Sherlock, turning on the charm, but something in Gruner’s face made him send the summons to Lestrade.
And John couldn’t shake that it was his fault that Mycroft had found out like this in the first place. He didn’t know what he could have done, or what he could have said, to spare Sherlock this kind of heartbreak. But surely he could have done something. He had to do
To her credit, the woman didn’t visibly look annoyed, but Sherlock could hear it in her voice. “It does not matter. I doubt cleverness is going to help you much here.”
Thanks so much for reading! Your kudos, bookmarks, subs, and comments -- as always -- mean a lot to me! I love writing this, and I'm glad so many people seem to be enjoying it too, and I hope it continues to entertain. <3
"O-okay."
“I like keeping an eye on my boys,” she said with a wide smile at the pair of them. “You’re practically family. Family that pays for the privilege, but family nonetheless.”
Sherlock, naturally, picked up on this right away. He scowled, leaning forward to pick up his cup of tea, and folded his long legs under himself as he settled back in his chair once more. “Stop looking at me like that.”
are two very different things. Sherlock is used to going solo, and getting himself out of difficult spots, but there are times when you just really, really need some good backup. A lesson Sherlock really ought to learn, y'know?
Sherlock ignored the thanks. “We can reopen the discussion tomorrow. For tonight, will the sofa suffice?”
my brother.” She tucked a wayward strand of hair behind her ear, and continued, “You may remember me, Mr. Holmes, though we have not met in person until now. My name is Soo Lin Yao.”
John pursed his lips, looking at Sherlock for a moment. “We’ll have to be ready, then.”
“Can I bring you anything?” said Mrs. Hudson worriedly, watching him ascend the stairs. “I’m not your housekeeper, but…”
For a second, he thought his foot might have just fallen through the floor, because suddenly he was pitching forward. The sight of John instinctively moving forward to catch him was the only impetus capable of making him catch his footing, and he half-fell back away from John and snapped, “Stop, you can’t touch me, you idiot!”
“He force-fed them pills?” said John, with a hint of skepticism.
!” insisted Moriarty, his tone equal parts exasperated and abruptly, dangerously angry. “You can’t lie to me. Stop pretending to be boring.”
the safest way forward.”
Eight minutes, fifty-seven seconds.
"NO, no, don't tell me," snapped Lestrade, hands over his ears for emphasis. "I don't need my mind infested with your voice as the voice of doubt."
“Hm?” hummed Sherlock, with a skeptical expression.
Sherlock was twenty feet behind John, after a block and a half of running, before John spoke.
Sherlock steadied himself. Something about looking at this particular body was triggering physical reactions he had not had to dead things in over two decades. Namely a gag reflex. He did not bother to think on this. He had more important things to think about. Like what to
John shuddered almost in spite of himself.
Sherlock whipped around.
Sherlock sat bolt upright and lurched to a dead stop as his wrists, handcuffed behind his back, slammed into the wooden beam they were chained around.
Mycroft looked at him coldly. “That,” he said, “is entirely dependent on you.”
Lestrade stared.
“No shit. But still.”
oh my god Sherlock
John and Mrs. Hudson were seated in the living room, with the television playing some daytime drivel quietly in the corner. Empty mugs of tea and plates were on the coffee table in a small patch of table that had been cleared of Sherlock’s papers scattered hither and yon around the room.
Soo Lin nodded quickly, and Sherlock stood. He led the way down the hall to his bedroom, John at his heels, and they stopped just inside the door. Sherlock closed the door halfway, just enough to keep an eye on Soo Lin.
“Sherlock, he’s
No, John needed to stay here.
John seemed to mull this over for a long moment. At last, he nodded. “When do I talk to him?”
When John awoke the next morning, he found the flat empty. He looked for Sherlock, even daring to open the door to Sherlock’s bedroom by a hair’s width in the hopes of finding him, but before long it became clear that he was alone once more.
Lestrade rubbed his eyes. “Okay,” he said. “Okay, so we just need to try to figure out some way to get an ID on the vehicle, since it didn’t have any plates, and we’re going to…” He stopped dead mid-sentence. “Cabbie.”
?”), Sherlock caught John’s faraway expression and frowned. “What are you thinking about over there?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sherlock opened the cab door. “Taking a cab.”
“Namely, how did you do it?” asked Moriarty.
Moriarty looked somewhat incredulous. “Why wouldn’t I? Everything I’ve done since you stole John from me was to bring us together. Everything since then has been to get us here. To get us to this moment. It’s all been for you.”
~o~O~o~
“I’m going to be honest,” said John, looking at the trainers with a great deal more skepticism than Sherlock, “this wasn’t what I was expecting Moriarty’s message to be.”
“You can be a real git when you want to be,” said Sherlock finally.
Sherlock took a few steps back, but he didn’t go far, and it was only after a couple minutes—when it was clear that Sherlock wasn’t going anywhere—that Mycroft came forward to stand next to him. Sherlock’s gaze flickered in Mycroft’s direction briefly.
Sherlock snorted. “As if you could.”
“Oh? What do you suggest we do?” asked Sherlock, equal parts condescending and genuinely curious.
The policeman rolled his eyes. “Right, like I’m going to believe that,” he snapped.
Sherlock reread this a few times to make sure he was not mistaken, ignoring the grammatical errors in lieu of the contents.
“So we’ll know soon enough, once the bomb squad’s finished up,” said Lestrade. “Then we can fix up your place and put together a proper plan of action.”
“An army doctor.”
“No problem.”
“No,” Amberley agreed bitterly. “She and Ray played me for a fool. All that time…”
I mean, we all knew Mycroft isn't the type to go unprepared for an interrogation.
Moran pretended to look uncertain. “No, I don’t know that I do.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “All right, all right, I get it.”
“Under a good dusting of broken glass.”
Since it's been a thousand years since my last update: we left off with Moran making a somewhat explosive escape, and leaving Sherlock with an ominous promise that things were about to draw to a close...
It had simply gotten up and flown away.
This was new, distinctly painful, and a very close call. Had there been skin contact, Watson would be dead and Sherlock would be out one potentially interesting case.
Good for him. Sherlock felt exactly the opposite.
Moriarty made a noise like a buzzer. “Not buying it. Try again!”
Sherlock paced.
“Technically,” said Sherlock, raising an eyebrow, both at John’s argument and the fact that they could have this conversation here of all places, “you died. So.”
(go read her fics, they're awesome)
His phone buzzed.
His phone buzzed.
John glanced out the window. He could see smoke billowing up past the broken windows, the acrid smell combined with the still-settling dust making it hard to focus on much of anything besides the challenge of breathing. But they needed to move—that much was obvious.
“I think that’s frequently the case these days. You’ve gotten rather sentimental in recent weeks.”
Sherlock shifted. “Though I think it’s more than that. For you. In your mind. You often exhibit a great sense of perspective, John, but this seems to have gotten very personal very fast.”
“To put in the code.”
Ultimately, what's important here is Sherlock, and I hope the focus is properly on him and how much it sucks to try to open up to someone and have it blow up in your face
Mycroft rolled his eyes. “As usual, Sherlock, you deny there being a problem, and I have to get you out of trouble when you’re in over your head, which you
“Heroic.”
Of course, time was also of the essence.
Sherlock glanced at him. “You’re not dead. Not anymore.”
John pursed his lips and tried again. It didn’t take a genius to pick up on Sherlock’s attitude. “Just trying to get an idea of where to start.”
things to find their way out. Sentimental things that might endanger those who got too close to him. And it seemed pointless, besides, to permit someone else to befriend him when all it was going to get them was a bloody nose and a surplus of conversation they’d never be able to understand.
She gestured at the empty seat next to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
There was a pause, and then something much harder and more angular than a pillow collided with the back of his head.
“Boring.”
Sherlock blinked, apparently coming out of his reverie, and said, “Hm? Why do you ask?”
But Sherlock plowed on. “This morning I went to the Haymarket Theatre that John was kind enough to tell me Amberley had attended the other night, but while the play did happen at the time he told us and he did purchase two tickets for it, the box office clerk was kind enough to show me the reservations and Mr. Amberley never actually showed up to the theatre, so where was he actually? Home, of course, murdering his wife and neighbor, because he believed that the two of them were having an affair. His wife claiming illness two nights ago was the last straw. He cracked, decided he had to kill them, that night, though he’d obviously been thinking about it some time before. So he lured them into the strongroom and shut the door on them—the door can’t be opened from the inside, as I have demonstrated for you a moment ago—so all Josiah had to do was turn on the gas and wait for his wife and her lover to suffocate inside. You’ll notice at the base of the door the words “We we” have been scratched into the wood varnish with a fingernail; presumably the start of the sentence “We were murdered” done by one Mrs. Amberley in the seconds before she died. God knows
“I’m good,” she said. “Just setting up. Did you need something, or…?”
“We can work up to it,” replied John. He settled back in his chair. He looked much less worried now, Sherlock noted with a kind of relieved satisfaction, but not entirely at-ease.
Zhi Zhu Yao was dead.
Sherlock hummed an affirmative.
"Oh. Oh, hi, Sherlock, hi," said a cute, blonde woman in a lab coat, who promptly turned very pink at the sight of Sherlock. "I didn't realize you were coming in. I—"
“This was taken two days before our informant was killed,” said Mycroft, and then he amended, with a gesture to John, “Two days before you were killed. They were flying out with a number of other soldiers.”
“Why not? It’s so you. You make everyone around you feel inadequate and then you swoop in and solve everything like the god of deductions. No one can compete with the godly Sherlock Holmes! I am a mere mortal in the presence of the sainted Sherlock Holmes!”
A huge thank you to my beta, RoseAngel!
“I don’t think you’re a freak,” said John. He didn’t know what else to say.
“Rude.”
Sorry for the small delay in updating, everyone - it's been a busy start to the semester, and I've discovered that "final semester" as an undergrad in no way denotes "easy semester"...
“Bravery and stupidity are approximate equals.”
“You don’t understand,” said Sherlock, half to himself and half to John.
He pulled on his coat. “I’ll be back in a bit,” he said, shutting the door as he went. He descended the stairs and walked out onto the street. Within a minute, he made it to the end of the street—which he knew was out of sight of the flat—and looked around before flagging a cab. As soon as one stopped, he climbed in.
John’s tone conveyed several messages at once. In the absence of light and in the presence of danger, deduction depended on other senses. Sherlock cast his mind out for information—and an odd observation stood out.
dickhead,” said John, and if his relief at the sight of Sherlock, bloody and bruised as he was, hadn’t been so overwhelming, he might have laughed.
Soo Lin beamed at him. Even with an IV in her arm, wearing a worn and faded hospital gown, the trials of the last several days only just starting to lift from her shoulders, she really did look as if she had shed years’ worth of sorrow since the last time he’d seen her. It was foolish to think that Moriarty was not a threat without Moran at his disposal—and Sherlock was sure Soo Lin knew that just as well as he did—but it was clear that even this brief time living outside the reach of that particular shadow of death meant more to her than almost anything else.
John heard Moriarty make a little gleeful gasp in his ear. “Have you been trying to tell him?” said Moriarty, sounding delighted rather than angry. “Have you? Nicely done, Johnny-boy. You’re not as dumb as you look.”
Sherlock pulled his hand back and stared intently at the building ahead of them. His heart was suddenly hammering in his chest. “Something’s wrong.”
Seized by inspiration, John grabbed his laptop and flipped it open. He typed in Sherlock’s website address and found a new blog post, entitled, “My Fantastic Idiotic Brilliant Ignorant Flatmate.” It took a significant amount of effort not to swear aloud.
Five minutes, forty-one seconds, and counting.
Mycroft was the first one through the door. “Sherlock?!”
Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks. “
It was a dismissal, and John knew it.
Sherlock rolled onto his back with a grimace, fixing John with a wary glare. “This is all superficial and will heal with time. I may not be medically trained, but I am confident that much is true. I’m not stupid.”
John straightened at Moriarty’s words, taking his hand away from the wall, shifting to square his shoulders.
“What does Mycroft think?” asked the policeman.
“So, again… we have nothing to go on.” John stood, and closed up his boxes of takeaway. Sherlock slid what was left of his takeaway across the table towards John, and John dug around in one of the kitchen drawers for cling film.
Hesitantly, Sherlock said, “To my knowledge.”
“I think Mrs. Hudson’s the least of my worries right now,” said Sherlock tersely.
“Are those…?” said Lestrade uncertainly.
“Ah, yes!” said John loudly. Was this the landlady or something? He could swear Sherlock had mentioned something to that effect last night or this morning… He grabbed his shirt off the doorknob and clumsily tugged it on with one hand as he shouted, “So sorry, give me just a minute, I’ll be down!”
, John,
John smiled. “Actually, I don’t think me going to the morgue is a good idea anyway. You and Greg nearly had a fit when I made us go to see the cabbie.”
A month ago, it had been an open wound; now, it looked just like a scar should. To anyone else, it wouldn’t mean anything. But John knew Mycroft would understand the implications.
John sat back, resentment bubbling in the pit of his stomach in spite of his efforts to keep calm. “I’ve got to admit, I’m not sure I buy that you’re entitled to know all of my business just because Sherlock doesn’t feel like sharing. You don’t know anything about me, as far as I’m concerned, and I barely know you past your name—which, I’ll add, I learned from Sherlock, and not you. Frankly, I don’t see why you and I have any reason to interact. You have no right to badger me like this.”
John please stop being so sad
“So he tested MI5 just to see if you lot were worth threatening at all,” said Sherlock. “
. There’s a difference between a little kid being murdered and a thirty-six-year-old soldier dying in active service. There’s a
"It's annoying."
“Yes, well…” Mycroft shrugged, giving John an appraising look that John actively avoided returning. “I won’t pretend I understand it, but I would be stupid to ignore it, and I would be lying if I said I didn’t think it was fascinating.”
The skull simply sat there.
