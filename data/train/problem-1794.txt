And there it was. The casual indifference Sherlock had towards him now, pushing John away in every instance. John’s hand twitched and he suddenly didn’t know what to do with them, rest them by his side? Play with his fingers? John looked down and nodded. “Yeah. Of course,” he said. Victor Trevor. Of course him. Of course Sherlock would choose him over John.
“No,” John said, “that was not my fault. You stopped coming back to the dorms, you started hanging out with Victor all the time,” John pointed an accusatory finger, “and left me. “
, John thought. He swung his arm back and the sound of his fist connecting with the bastard’s nose was the most satisfying thing he’d heard all day.
1. Ted Bundy was an American serial killer who was convicted on the basis of which type of forensic evidence?
When John looked at Sherlock with a smile on his face, Sherlock’s eyes were wide and he looked at John and then back to the door. “You,” he breathed.
John was in the garden, crouched by a statue. Ironically, one of cupid and his stupid bow and arrow. He was frustrated and sad and…
He had a vast array of medical knowledge, all gained from reading the hundreds medical books sitting on their shelves. John could only hope that he’d be able to demonstrate that during the interview.
If it weren’t for Sherlock Holmes, John would’ve said that his first year at Newberry Academy was rather uneventful.
John’s breathing stopped for a second, and then forced himself to continue as if nothing was wrong. “Because you’re my friend.”
It was during one of their dates actually. He’d taken her to the cinema, and they were at a small café right after the movie. She’d taken his hand during the movie, and John’s stomach turned at how much he remembered the way Sherlock’s fingertips felt beneath his. She was colder on their walk to the café, and John knew that she knew.
He's not on the sofa in the green parlour anymore, but one of the French doors is propped open, and Tristram can smell cigarette smoke.
Because it was all right, wasn't it? It wasn't 'you utter freak'. It wasn't 'get the fuck out of my life'. It was just like before: they'd say good night, go to their own homes for a few hours, and then they'd see each other again tomorrow. Monday at the latest. John would be in a better mood after some food and a rest, and by then Sherlock would have come up with a perfectly reasonable explanation for having directed his browser to John's account login page. Everything was going to be absolutely, perfectly fine. It had to be.
Holmes took each item of clothing as I divested myself and laid them over the back of the chair with the bowl and rope. He then picked up the chestnuts and approached me.
Tristram will read it on his own, anyway. He's curious now. But he needn't mention that. He doesn't realise that he's sided with Doctor Watson against his own father until after the words are out. He didn't mean to do that. He was just trying to fix the unhappiness he saw in Doctor Watson's face. He glances apprehensively at Father, but he seems to have tuned them out again.
Greg looked slightly relieved, “that’s fine, I’m not exactly dying to spend time with that psychopath.”
Mary nodded, moving closer to John. “I haven’t seen you in so long, and we’re alone. For once.” She reached for his hand and held it, leaning in for a kiss. John acquiesced. They kissed for a bit, but before she could reach to tug off his shirt, John pushed her back gently.
John hesitated, it would seem so pathetic to tell him the whole truth, how scared he was. “Because..” John said, running his hand through his hair, trying to find a way to say it, “Because it wouldn’t work.”
John nodded, continuing, “It’s a huge collection of criminal memorabilia from the most famous cases. The problem is that it’s in New Scotland Yard and not open to visitors. There’s are police officers assigned there. I’m not even sure how many exhibits there are, but from what I read there’d more than enough to fascinate Sherlock.”
“In the beginning, when we first talked about your future, you said that you wanted to become a doctor and go to Cambridge? You had so much potential. The professor who interviewed you said that you seemed to be one of the most brilliant students she’s ever talked with.”
It was larger than John has expected, thought he didn’t quite know what to expect. He sort of just imagined a storage room with old guns and skulls. Instead, it was an actual museum. Dimly lit and oddly tasteful in its simple décor. The exhibits were in glass cases on wooden stands and plaques with its background history.
“Oh god, they gave us our old dorm number,” John laughed, “what even is this?” Sherlock grinned in response and took one of the keys to open the door, and the light flickered on.
It was comical, really, the way Greg and Molly’s face fell at the same time and a look of pity and concern overcame their features. John sighed. He had told them what happened with Sherlock after them prying for weeks about why Sherlock was never with John anymore.
“He’s just irritating,” John said, trying to compose himself and not say anything stupid. This was not the time.
John glanced at the coroner’s report again. “Since the cause of death was immediately ruled as asphyxiation, there was no autopsy of the body. Only a preliminary drugs test was run on the body. I’d say that some sort of poison was injected into the bloodstream, I can’t list them all on the top of my head, but there are several that would be virtually undetectable unless specifically tested for.”
Mr. Brooke folded his hands and focused the full intensity of his stare at John. “This is the best boarding school in Britain, Mr. Watson. We have high standards here, and while I cannot legally punish you for your performance this year, I am warning you that if this continues to happen, your future at Newberry will be very bleak.”
“Ever the doctor John. Don’t worry, I won’t go all fainting flower on you. I know what my limits are. Besides, now I’ve got you as my roommate to watch out for me.”
John stared. “Excuse me? What about you?,” his voice was rising, “I’m not the one who abandoned you Sherlock, you were the one who stopped talking to me.”
“Yes. I’ve always been fascinated by the human anatomy. My father was a doctor, and so was my grandfather.”
When John walked up to Sherlock, he turned around and looked at John excitedly. “This is the actual letter,” Sherlock pointed to the faded, scrawled writing. The letter that Jack the Ripper allegedly wrote.”
John nodded. In the few short hours since he met Mike, he’s told him about Melinda, his girlfriend and how they were fighting.
“Oh are you jealous John?” Sherlock said, with a sarcastic twist of his lips that made John so frustrated.
Before John could orgasm, Sherlock removed his hand and kissed John gently on his eyelids before muttering sweet nothings in his ear. Pleasure, pain and lust was all John knew. Sherlock was so good at keeping him close to the edge and John lost all coherent thought.
Greg appeared at his side, handcuffing the free hand before taking the other one from John. Once he was handcuffed, John jumped off and went to Sherlock.
“Well that’s a tenner I ain’t getting back.” Greg leaned back on the booth, interlacing his fingers over his stomach. “You’re jealous!” John could feel the smirk directed at him.
Sherlock’s lips and tongue were everywhere and John felt he was being worshipped. John closed his eyes and let himself go, allowing himself to just enjoy the heat building. Sherlock’s mouth was on his nipple, teasing it between his teeth. John moaned at the sensation running through him. His breathing was faster and the ropes around him created a sweet burn against his skin. John knew he was going to have rope burns after this session and the thought thrilled him. He was going to wear them with pride, the physical proof on his skin that Sherlock loved him, and that he loved Sherlock and trusted him enough to let him take control. Of course he had trusted Sherlock almost the second he met him.
“I know.” Sherlock was on the move, heading towards the gents and Alec was staring after him like he was something delicious to eat; which of course Sherlock was, but not for Alec to taste. Once Sherlock disappeared from sight, Alec chucked a shot down and went in after Sherlock.
“John, let me show you how much I love you.” Sherlock was looking down at him with such awe, devotion and love that it took John’s breath away. John usually loved being dominating in bed because he loved the rush he got from that and the way Sherlock responded to him. But at times he needed control taken away and this was one of those times. He had expanded a lot of adrenaline during the fight and he couldn’t muster the energy to be domineering again, he wanted to succumb. He wanted to just feel and he wanted Sherlock to get him out of his head for a while.
Sherlock was at times an arse, an utter cock, and this was one of those times. Sherlock knew what he wanted, and he was going to make John say it. Just to stall and gather his nerve, John started to undress Sherlock, removing one item at a time and avoiding eye contact. John kneeled down to remove Sherlock’s shoes and socks and got distracted by the tent in his trousers. John leaned in, nuzzling the hardness between Sherlock’s legs.
He’d just seen his last patient and he still had to write up the reports before he could go home to Sherlock. John pulled out his phone and tapped it absentmindedly to his jaw, trying to think of the best wording for his final text of the evening.
an hour before John was to come home. And thoroughly he’d meant Sherlock was to use the douche and clean himself internally (even though Sherlock was brilliant, sometimes he was lazy and overlooked certain things and John as a physician knew the dangers of gay sex even though they were monogamous and tested clean). Just for fun he’d described in a lengthy text how, where and what product he was to use in his washing, imagining the faint flush on Sherlock’s cheeks and chest at the words shining on the screen of his phone.
“I’m not going to last long,” John breathed out to Sherlock’s ear before leaning back and lifting Sherlock’s legs over his shoulder’s , “if you haven’t orgasmed by that time I’m going to finish you off with my fingers, using my sperm as lube and I’m going to keep massaging your prostate mercilessly until you come.” John pounded as hard as he could, hitting Sherlock’s prostate with each thrust.
“Lift your hips, love.” Sherlock pulled the rest of his clothes off. Sherlock tied a knot around his left ankle and started twisting the rope around John’s thigh, forcing his legs to stay bent. If it were any other time and without the ropes, John would feel too exposed to simply enjoy the moment.
“John.” Sherlock breathed out and John finally got his wits about him and started pulling Sherlock’s shirt off him. He needed skin on skin contact. Sherlock’s skin was light and smooth and warm under his palms. John tugged the sparce hairs on Sherlock’s chest, eliciting a sharp inhale and a moan from him.
After the douching instructions he sent another text an hour later (he did have patients after all and he’d already received nasty looks from the receptionist when he waited more than normally before taking another patient in) telling Sherlock was to get the following things ready for him before he got home: lube, the stolen handcuffs (Lestrade’s, of course) and the riding crop.
The taxi took them home and John could feel the adrenaline releasing its hold on him and making him shiver. Sherlock was holding his hand and rubbing the back of his hand in slow circles.
“Sorry.” John was nearly knocked down with the door opening. The bloke was looking pleased and rubbing his lips absentmindedly on his way out. It took way too long for John to realize it was Alec Forsythe leaving the loo.
Once John had the mirror positioned to the perfect position, he started undressing. He took his time folding the clothes while Sherlock watched and waited.
John could feel the headache coming in with each passing second they were in the club, the thud of the bass wasn’t helping the matter at all. The suspect, Alec Forsythe, was suspected of beating four guys into coma. The latest crime was fortunately interrupted and the victim had only few scrapes and bruises and retrograde amnesia. The last thing Colin remembered was talking with the guy Sherlock was talking to at this bar.
“God, I love you so much it’s ridiculous.” John breathed out, stepping closer to the seated man in front of him. “You mean the world to me, Sherlock.” John tilted Sherlock’s face towards him, kissing him gently. “We need you, Rosie and I. But mostly me, Rosie’s a strong girl.” Sherlock pulled John to his lap, deepening the kiss.
Finally John couldn’t stand still any longer. As much as he wanted to prolong this, the feeling of wholeness and intimacy and trust, he was only a man. He tried to keep the steady pace but the need was building up. He leaned in towards Sherlock, locking their gaze. “I want you to come like this, Sherlock. Untouched.” Sherlock let out a whimper. John knew he wasn’t going to last long and Sherlock looked like he was on the brink of orgasm as well.
“Keep telling yourself that mate.” Greg chuckled to himself before turning back to see the scene unfolding. He was treating it like it was some kind of a spectacle. All he needed was popcorn and a soda and he was set.
“Okay?” Even though he basically ordered Sherlock to do what he wanted, he needed to know he was up for it.
He collapsed over Sherlock, spent and satiated. Sherlock was breathing hard under him and John was finding it difficult to breathe.
The stairs leading outside were long, longer than John remembered. John tried not to let his brain jump to worst case scenarios as he climbed the stairs. Never in his life had he felt such a worry as he did when it came to Sherlock in danger.
John couldn’t think straight; all his senses were filled with Sherlock. His breathing was fast, as was Sherlock’s. His heart was hammering in his ears and his dick was throbbing with need. As if Sherlock had once again read his mind, his trousers were opened and his dick was pulled free. Sherlock teased him with not enough pressure and John whined needily. Sherlock’s tongue sneaked its way inside John’s, licking and touching every inch of his mouth.
”Look at him go! I never figured Sherlock to be such an utter flirt.” The unce unce unce of the music was making John’s head pound.
“Yes.” The word sounded almost like a groan. There was no eye roll at the end of that word or even the silent
Rationally he knew he had nothing to worry about but he couldn’t help the monster within rearing up its’ ugly green head and thrashing inside his guts at the way Sherlock was talking and acting towards someone else.
He crawled on the bed, positioning himself behind Sherlock. He massaged Sherlock’s arse with both hands, loving the feeling of them under his palms. He gave each cheek a couple of swift slaps and Sherlock moaned loudly. The skin turned to a lovely pink shade and John leaned in, kissing and licking the irritated skin.
John could feel the fight leaving him and he nearly wobbled on his feet. The fear he had felt when Sherlock had jumped off Bart hospital was back when he’d seen Sherlock on the ground bleeding. He remembered the feeling of not having Sherlock in his life and the feeling nearly crippled him.
“I was scared, so scared. The last time I was that scared was when you fell.” John draws in a shaky breath before pushing his nose between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, holding his breath until he saw stars. “I can’t live without you, Sherlock. It would kill me.” He released his tight grip on Sherlock, allowing him to turn around.
John let Sherlock lead him to their bed, he could already feel the calmness spreading through him. He watched as Sherlock went to the dresser and pulled out a hemp rope. John moaned and his hand flew straight to his dick at the sight, rubbing it through his trousers.
and because he was afraid to cause such pain for him. It was different when he used his hand. With the crop it came too close to the things Sherlock had had to endure during his time dismantling Moriarty’s network. After many lengthy conversations John started to give in; if it was something Sherlock wanted then who he was to deny him.
“I want you to watch” John told as he went to move the mirror from the corner and positioned it so Sherlock could see them on the bed. When John had seen the huge mirror the first time he’d told Sherlock he simply had to have it. Sherlock had been a pain in the ass about it but when John explained he wanted to buy the mirror so he could watch himself fucking Sherlock, blushingly Sherlock had changed his mind and bought it. They had used it only a couple of times because Sherlock wasn’t wholly comfortable with looking at himself while they were intimate. John was going to show Sherlock how beautiful he was when they were making love and that there was nothing embarrassing about looking at himself while in the throes of passion.
Sherlock didn’t say it but sometimes he struggled with what their life was like now. They couldn’t take as many cases as they used to take and the ones they did weren’t as dangerous as before. They had a child to grow and a family to protect. It wasn’t as if Sherlock somehow regretted the choices they made in the past or that he didn’t love the life they had now but he was an adrenaline junkie, as was John. It only meant that they had to invent new ways to keep their blood pumping and keep the excitement in their life. Luckily they had also managed to pull their heads out of their arses and admitted that there was more to their friendship. Sherlock had discovered that sex, while it was messy and sometimes weird, could be extremely rejuvenating.
John’s eyes saw red and he focused solely on the man hitting Sherlock as he charged at him, hitting the man with his whole body, sending them both to the ground. John started hitting him to the body, managing to hit him to the kidney on the left side but forgot to shield his face. The strike on the side of his face made his ear pop.
“Happy anniversary, Sherlock.” Sherlock pushed John to his back and splayed himself all over him, holding John as tightly as he could. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, kissing the top of his head.
“Thank you John.” Sherlock’s voice was hoarse as he turned to face John. Sherlock looked more relaxed than he had done in days.
John dropped the crop to the floor and dropped to his knees behind Sherlock, kissing the reddened skin tenderly. “You did well. You are so good to me Sherlock, so beautiful, so perfect.” Sherlock was nearly hyperventilating from the pain and pleasure and compliments.
John got up from the bed, his muscles stiff and went to get the riding crop. Once Sherlock saw the crop he whimpered and bit his lip. His back dipped as Sherlock pushed his backside higher up in the air. Sherlock had a thing about riding crops. At first John had been reluctant to use them in their bedroom activities because of
Inside Sherlock was rearranging his curls in front of the mirror. John strode across the room, crowding in his space. “He kissed you.”
Sherlock’s long fingers worked deftly on him, tying John’s right leg in the same position before lifting both legs over his stomach and tying them in that position.
John could read the doubt and uncertainty in Sherlock’s eyes. He looked so sure there was no way he could orgasm without some stimulation on his prick. “You can do it, love.” The heat was coiling in John’s abdomen.
John moved to the end of the bed, trailing his hand behind him. It was impossible for him to stop touching Sherlock. He wasn’t even sure how he managed to get so lucky as to have Sherlock like this. He hadn’t even dared to hope for this. Not after everything that had happened to them. Not because it was Sherlock and Sherlock didn’t have relationships, and not because John wasn’t gay.
“Christ, you’re beautiful like this.” Sherlock closed his eyes for a second on hearing the praise, as if taking time to plant the compliment firmly in his mind palace. Sherlock loved it when John complimented him and he had decided a long time ago to compliment him whenever he got the chance.
When John had opened Sherlock up enough he slid his fingers out and slicked his penis with more lube. He slid in with minimal resistance and Sherlock groaned under him. The tightness was overwhelming and he was sure he wouldn’t last long. John leaned in, kissing Sherlock before pulling out and thrusting back in with force. He shifted his position, searching for the angle so his penis would massage against Sherlock’s prostate with each thrust of his hips. Still, after all these years, John found it hard to believe he could have this, to have Sherlock in his life. All those years ago he had decided he would take whatever Sherlock wanted to give. He was utterly grateful and surprised Sherlock had wanted to share the Baker Street flat with him.
“Mmmm, perfect.” John couldn’t move but it was alright. He trusted Sherlock to make him feel good and take care of him. Sherlock ran his fingers over the ropes and knots, making sure they were placed perfectly. His hands were everywhere. John’s cock was starting to fill up again from the attention Sherlock was giving him.
Sherlock opened the door, leading John in and ushering him up the stairs. “Tea?” He asked over his shoulder while heading to the kitchen.
“John!” Sherlock breathed out at the contact and John was momentarily distracted by seeking out Sherlock with his eyes and the way Sherlock’s face was bloodied. The man managed to buck John off because of the distraction. And then he saw black. No, he didn’t black out, he felt fury and he gave in to the monster thirsting for blood. This man had made his Sherlock bleed, had hurt him. John squared his shoulders and jumped up. The man was trying to escape, even with Greg’s gun on him, and John wasn’t going to let that happen. He raced after the man, grabbing his shoulders while dropping to his back and pushing with his legs, making the man fly over his head back towards Greg. The man looked surprised to be thrown back but jumped back up fast. His stance told John he was trained in fighting and John couldn’t help but to grin; the monster would get its’ blood after all.
Once John got the right angle he kept his thrusts hard. Pushing in fast and pulling out gently. It was torture; sweet torture to hold himself from ploughing Sherlock but taking his time with him. Sherlock’s breathing was shallow and he was moaning and pleading him to move faster. John stopped moving all together. “Sherlock,” John growled the name out and Sherlock opened the eyes he’d closed, “were my instructions unclear?” Sherlock was shaking his head with desperation even before John managed to finish his question.
John’s head went blank as Sherlock started weaving the rope around him, the pressure was making him lightheaded in the most perfect way. Sherlock looked so serene as he concentrated on keeping the rope tight to restraint but not too tight to cut circulation. “I love you so much.” John breathed out. Sherlock kissed him gently before continuing with the rope. The harness around his torso felt amazing, he could feel the restraint with each breath. Sherlock was so gentle with him, moving his body the way he wanted to, and John let him. He trusted Sherlock with his life. His arms were tied together, the rope going around and around his arms, keeping them firmly in place. Sherlock connected his hands on the harness rope around his torso.
Sherlock’s hands held on to John by his hips as John turned Sherlock’s head to the side, kissing his way to his ear before giving it a bite. “Mine.” He honest to God growled to Sherlock’s ear.
John got back on the bed again, pushed a spare pillow under Sherlock’s hips and coated his fingers with lube. Sherlock was watching him and John stared back as he pushed the first finger in. Sherlock was biting his lower lip, pupils dilated and his penis red and leaking between his legs. If he had to take a picture of the most beautiful thing in the world, this would be it surely. John couldn’t think anything more beautiful than this (of course his daughter was competing for that prize as well but there was no way he was choosing out of those two options).
John stared at the text for five minutes before deciding it was as good as it would get and pressed send. The one worded reply came a minute later and John couldn’t help but to grin to himself before dwelling in to the utterly boring part of his profession. One would think that being an active blogger and a physician would mean that he was a fast typist, but no. He couldn’t get his finger to work fast and he was still struggling with using more than two of his ten fingers.
Thank you to my brilliant beta readers, ruth0007 and dioscureantwins, who gave me the confidence to post this and made it even better.
move back in, it's just temporary), ostensibly to keep an eye on him, make sure he takes his meds and doesn't overexert himself.
Father lowers his phone and turns to Tristram. "At the flat," he clarifies. "You saw something that made you move away from the wall."
"You're damn right I would have said no! You can't just- Sherlock, Jesus Christ." John scrubbed his hands through his hair and paced the room. Gladstone perked his ears up and watched him curiously from where he lay on the floor. Finally, John stopped, placed his hands on his hips, and laughed. It wasn't a happy sound. "You know, I thought I was the one who was getting in too deep too fast, but you-"
"Sherlock," Doctor Watson calls into the living room, "what are you doing letting them eat this? You knew I was going out to get food."
"Let that be my concern. First things first." He grasped her calves and tugged her closer, so that she had to bend her knees up. Then he crouched down, used his thumbs to hold her open, and buried his tongue in her.
The hall was completely silent. John swallowed uncomfortably, but he didn't look away. Even in his discomfiture, even as he began to realise his mistake, he was trying to be there for Sherlock, to encourage him and give him moral support.
As soon as the door swings shut behind her, Father whips the lid off with a flourish, as if he were revealing a masterpiece of craftsmanship. Maybe, to him, it is. Tristram can't see the contents of the plate from where he's sitting, but he can see his father's face. His eyes glitter with possibilities.
This is set in the first half of chapter 18 and is based on a prompt by all-round wonderful person, mildredandbobbin, who wanted to see John's POV after they got fired.
Sherlock sits down on the chair in the corner of the room and takes off his shoes. "Tristram's mother is here," he says without looking at John.
Doctor Watson pulls back to look at Father. "You can't know that!" he says incredulously. "I don't care how brilliant you are, you cannot have known what they would have done."
"Then come." I laid my hand over his and felt his beloved flesh, the firm and steady fingers, the heat coursing through them. "Let us go and visit the bees."
Tristram remains silent. He hears her shoes clicking further into the room. The light shifts as she comes closer. Tristram tries to pull himself even further into the closet.
"No, really. It is. I know you're not that enthusiastic about it, but I think it's going to be really good."
hand gives him an unpleasant tingly feeling in his stomach. Can they fix that? What if part of his hand got shot right off and he can't use it anymore?
"You asked me something the other night, about John," Father says into the wind. His eyes are narrowed, perhaps against the sunlight reflecting off all the whiteness around them. It's so bright that Tristram's eyes are watering at the corners. Many of the other people on the terrace are wearing sunglasses. Tristram didn't think to pack any. He never would have figured he'd need sunglasses in winter.
Tristram looks up at his father, too, genuinely wondering what his answer will be. If they were here alone, just he and his father and Grandmother, Father would certainly say it was a stupid idea, and that if Tristram needed fresh air, he could go out into the garden. But Father's reactions have broken his usual patterns several times now where Doctor Watson and Emily are concerned.
Somewhere overlaying the all-consuming heat and urgency, the wonder and gladness, a thought fluttered its wings, begging attention: this was going too fast. Sherlock was-- He hadn't showered, they had no supplies. He actually needed to empty his bladder rather desperately. More importantly, he hadn't had time to properly process it all, and neither had John. It felt as if they were on a train barrelling toward the station with no time to admire the view. It wasn't that he felt they should take things slow, exactly. But neither of them had slept well, John was hungover and not at his peak in terms of performance. That wasn't something that necessarily bothered Sherlock, but he felt certain John would want to make a -- to put it crassly -- good impression for the first time they shared this together. And it did look very much as if the station they were headed towards involved at least one of them blowing their whistle in the next few minutes.
"I'm at Victoria right now, getting into a cab," Father tells him. "I'll be there in fifteen minutes. Stay where you are."
"I understand this is something you'd best do alone," John says, "but I'll be honest: I don't like it. What if someone goes after her at the hospital to finish the job, and you just happen to be there?"
Doctor Watson looks pleased and sends Emily off to get dressed again in warm layers. Father says they won't be leaving until later, so Tristram sits on the pull-out bed and watches Emily run back and forth. Tristram wonders if the woman from breakfast has something to do with a case. She must do. If she really was an old friend of Father's, that friendship no longer seems to be extant. At least, Father certainly didn't seem very enthusiastic about meeting with her, based on the brief snippets of the conversation he and Doctor Watson had before they sent Emily and Tristram to the bedroom. On the other hand, if she's a witness - or even a suspect - in a case, Father would be a lot more eager to meet with her. So Tristram is kind of stumped.
"They were with us the entire time!" Sherlock cried in exasperation. Honestly, you'd think Lestrade would give him that much credit. He'd made sure that neither Liam nor Saffron had anything else on that afternoon; he'd had them back by supper time; and of course he hadn't let them out of his sight once. Not that the two children of the American ambassador had suffered any lasting injury from their brief excursion that one time, either. A bit of stomach-ache from overindulding on sweets was all, but Sherlock had nothing to do with that. He couldn't understand why everyone kept bringing it up.
"Not far off," Doctor Watson mutters. He sighs and rubs his hands on the thighs of his jeans. "How you doing, Tris?" he asks.
Emily's already asleep. They didn't read together tonight. Tristram would have liked to, but Doctor Watson said it was too late when they got back from the restaurant, and Emily didn't protest. Reading together is really Doctor Watson and Emily's thing anyway, so Tristram didn't say anything either. Even though it would have been nice to have Doctor Watson sit with them a little while. And Father too, off to the side but paying more attention than it seems like. Maybe tomorrow.
Lestrade made that gormless open-mouthed face again. "The one where you talk to all the parents about the play and the filming and answer their questions," he said carefully.
"Okay. L-" John starts to say something but ends up clearing his throat instead. "Later then. Tomorrow. See you tomorrow." He squeezes Sherlock's arm and pushes himself to his feet. "Good night," he whispers.
"The hospital was horrid," Sherlock insisted darkly. "And I never want to be in the same room with an infant again."
John appears unimpressed. "Would you? Or just what you think I need to hear?" He catches and holds Sherlock's gaze.
Sherlock scowled in annoyance, both at society at large for coming up with stupid rules, and at himself for feeling any sort of inclination to comply. He felt like having a glass of wine with his dumplings, no sex afterwards, and that was that. He took a bottle out of the cupboard and popped it into the freezer, being careful not to disturb the ice tray with the cow eyeballs. By the time the order arrived, the rosé would be at the right temperature.
"You're right," she preened, before turning her attention to Sherlock and John. "Never mind that now. How are you boys?"
"Yes," Father repeats. It doesn't sound like he's trying to convince Doctor Watson of anything; more like he's assuring him.
Doctor Watson glances out the window. "It's not that bad. I think it's even letting up. And we don't need to go in the water. I'd quite like to see the sea, anyway, as long as we're here. Sherlock?" He looks across the table for support.
Such was my condition, then, when Colonel Damery requested an audience that Thursday afternoon. The interview was intriguing but in the end did not seem the sort of thing that would attract Holmes' attention. In the first place, our visitor refused to name the benefactor who had sent him on his errand, and it is Holmes' sworn policy only to work for clients who divulge their full history to him. (I know now that he had deduced the identity of the bashful client by the end of Colonel Damery's first visit, although he did not reveal it to me. Consequentially, he never actually disregarded his credo.)
When they stopped kissing and their faces were a shaving-cream mess, John smiled brightly. Brighter than he usually did.
He grabbed firmly Sherlock’s neck and pulled him lower. He kissed him very gently, but his kiss was filled with so much love, that it felt different. This wasn’t a “I love you” kiss, it was the confirmation that from now on, they would never depart each other’s side. It transcended all physical implications; this was the kiss that sealed them as what they were. Soulmates.
With the knife still in his hand, he sat down in his chair. Sherlock wasn’t facing him but he was sitting in his chair too, he knew John had the pink apron he had gifted to him last Valentine’s… That sort of distracted him.
Sherlock remained quiet. His chin was covered in cream and John was standing, fidgeting with the razor as he always did with everything he had in hand when he was getting too scared but wasn’t willing to share that fact. Sherlock picked up the little things John did as if it was his first time seeing them but he understood everything.
John returned to the kitchen in silence. Not a word said to Sherlock. Surprisingly, Sherlock came out their bed room with his curls sleeked and carefully groomed. His body was covered with an earth-tones cloth wrapping him like a big shall or some similar accessory.
“No! Of course not! You are just taking a case where we might DIE, no big deal right?!” sarcastically shouted John who was still in the kitchen cutting vegetables. “There really is no other option?”
He helped him through the stairs although Sherlock had tired to refuse his help and it himself. He almost fell and John had to keep in a “told you so”. They got to their bedroom, where Sherlock noticed John hadn’t been sleeping there and-to top all of his injuries- he felt concerned about John’s sleeping whereabouts. It couldn’t possibly be cheating. No way.
John was looking for his medical kit, the one he kept prepared for all types of injuries ever since he got back from the war. It was a habit that didn’t wear off.  Sherlock was looking for more clues in there and saw that his boyfriend had been through his closet, various times. This was a relief because it meant he was too busy thinking of him to have cheated.
John was curled like a little ball into Sherlock’s sofa chair. Hoping that was going to make him feel less… lost... Less alone. All for that little comment… How stupid he felt. He shouldn’t have let that affect him.  He could’ve seen a way to accompany him. He felt the warm tears rolling through his face, tracing his eyebags which where there mostly because of the emptiness he started feeling when Sherlock showed no signs of returning, or even being alive.
Lestrade called a few times to assure him Sherlock would return in one piece. He just had to remember his last funeral… Sherlock even came back from the dead he had said. Lestrade would never know how much worse John felt after those calls. Spending sometimes hours in his office, playing over and over images of Sherlock dying, of another funeral. Tormenting his soul every passing day.
“Long story” replied Sherlock for he did not find pleasure in talking to John about what he had lived out there. It had been a long time since a case of that magnitude. He looked at John who had stopped moving and was looking directly into Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock could feel John’s curiosity. They were both blushing, it was a long time since they held eye contact for so long. Besides, the atmosphere was tensed they still had things to talk about. Although Sherlock couldn’t resist the urge to kiss John. He leaned in, although his body ached, and softly touched his lips with his own. John gave in and get for a full kiss. The kiss was short but it mended a bit of what was wrong.
"When I was first in the army," Doctor Watson begins, and Tristram's interest is immediately, helplessly piqued, because he knows that Doctor Watson used to be in the army, but he's never said a word about it. It's true they played army games yesterday, but Tristram realises only now that those scenarios were probably based on real ones Doctor Watson experienced. He wonders, with a somewhat guilty thrill, whether Doctor Watson has ever killed anyone.
"Please, John." Sherlock turned his head to rub his face against his shoulder. "I can't. I need it!" This time there was a hint of desperation and anger. Good. That was what needed to come out.
John leaned back against the table next to him and crossed his arms. "It's all cleared with Greg and the hospital. We're taking the bus and going to visit the maternity unit."
His father has always liked talking about his cases. Half the time when he's working through something at the flat, he talks to himself under his breath. Occasionally - more so as Tristram has grown older - he will share some points of his investigations with Tristram, explaining how he came to his conclusions. Tristram has always assumed that these were lessons. But watching his father come to life now, enjoyment and enthusiasm written large across his features, Tristram begins to form another hypothesis: his father talks about his cases the same way that Tristram and Emily talk about potions or building a time machine. Only his father has never had an Emily on the other end. And that brings Tristram to an uncomfortable thought: has his father been lonely? Tristram wouldn't ever have said he was lonely before Emily became his friend, but now, if he considers going back to how things were three months ago, he has to admit that he was. Maybe Father has been too.
"No, quite all right," Sherlock said, ducking his head to hide his smile at John's eagerness. "It's yours anyway."
"I intend to be a part of my son's life from now on, and you're involved with his father, whom he lives with. I rather think that does make it my business," she says archly.
He was almost looking forward to the visit by the time the bell rang at the end of the school day. It had been a long time since he'd last locked wits with his brother, much less in front of an audience he wanted to impress.
Tristram didn't realise that Emily came to school by Tube, but now that he thinks about it, it makes sense. Since she and her father always arrive on foot, he knows they don't come by car. She lives twenty minutes away from his house by taxi, and it's a twenty-minute walk from Tristram's house to the school (only five minutes by car, as he knows from those rare occasions when Uncle Mycroft's assistant has picked him up and dropped him at home), so even though their school is between their houses, she'd have to walk - he quickly does the sum - she'd have to walk for over an hour to get to the school from her house. That seems excessive to do twice every day, especially as Doctor Watson needed a cane to get around until Friday Afternoon. (Tristram hasn't thought about it much, but now he wonders how exactly his leg got fixed. He has the impression that his father had something to do with it.)
Tristram's pictures come out while the voice is telling Father to insert his coins. Doctor Watson hands him the strip of four pictures.
"Tris..." It's another voice. Gentler, softer. Then it gets sharp as it says, "Sherlock, let go of him, Jesus, that's not helping." The grip on his shoulders disappears. Tristram feels unmoored.
"Diovan and something for my bladder, I can never remember the name. Uro something." He moved compliantly with John, feeling heavier than his thin frame might indicate.
Tristram isn't either. This is sounding worse and worse. Does Father blame Doctor Watson that Tristram was hurt? But that wasn't his fault! And he helped Tristram afterwards, even came to the hospital with him. Did much more than Father, to be honest. Maybe that is the source of their disagreement this time?
When it's over, Sherlock is panting and his head is throbbing, every pounding of his heart amplified in his swollen nose. His mouth is full of the tang of metal. It feels like every ounce of energy has been leeched out of him and is now congealing somewhere on the green hexagonal tiles at his feet.
Because the only other option is for it all to be John's fault. Everything. From Sherlock being shot to the child about to be born into the care of a—
"Sherlock..." John gave him a warning look and tilted his head toward the table. "The three wise men."
Sherlock stopped off at the teachers' lounge to check his inbox. The room was filled with the murmur of voices as the other teachers finished preparing for their classes or gossiped in the last few minutes before the warning bell rang to signal the start of classes. This was the worst part of the day. He could deal with the children, barely - none of them expected him to be nice or polite or, dullest of all, sociable. Not that any of the adults at the school did either by now, but the accusation was still there, the finger-pointing, both overt and subtle, at his failure to conform to some random set of useless rules he'd never agreed to in the first place.
“John, I won’t allow you in this one. Besides, I don’t really need your help in it… You’ve got your work too. I’m going to DIE soon if I don’t do something exciting”, explained Sherlock.
“Hideous? I thought I never looked bad and would always be the handsomest man you’d ever seen” teased Sherlock, referencing to one of their first cheesy conversations of when they first started dating.
Sherlock never talked about his feelings like that. He opened up in a way he had never done. At least not that directly. Each word hit like a wave in John’s chest. The storm had ended. Not a single doubt was left inside his brain. Sherlock was, after all, the only man he would ever love. His one, his only. The moon and the stars, he completed him. Everything was good now.
Sherlock was quietly aware of John slipping in and out during the morning lesson, always taking two of the children with him. So he was carrying on with those ridiculous auditions for Joseph and Mary. Sherlock was well shot of the whole thing. He'd only started it because Lestrade had forced him to. They didn't actually need Sherlock at this point.
"Oh, portents and shofarim are beyond year threes, but they have no problem with religious metaphor."
John pulled his leg out from underneath and dropped it on top of Sherlock's, drawing it closer. Unambiguous. Reckless. "All right, your turn," he said. Sherlock's move.
Father's done quite a lot of things, come to think of it, that aren't exactly typical for him, since he and John have become boyfriends. The whole boyfriends thing itself is the hugest one, of course, but there are a lot more. Not that any of the new things are bad - some of them are quite good, in Tristram's opinion - but he can't help thinking that Father's always relieved when he can take off the reflective vest or vicar's collar or uniform and wash the dirt or dye or styling gel out of his hair.
Sherlock cursed to himself when he realised he was doing exactly what Moriarty had accused him of the day before. He was running away - quite literally - from … from what? This wasn't like the Royal College. There, he'd failed the exams and Mycroft had forced him into rehab. There had been no question of him returning. But he hadn't set out to fail there... had he?
Doctor Watson stands up too. "What might have been there, hm?" he says to Father. It sounds like a challenge. His mouth is set in a thin line. "No one followed us here. Right? No one even knows we're here, other than Mycroft. He didn't-" His eyes get wide. "Oh no, he did not send some other team after us."
Tristram is jolted into full wakefulness. In his entire conscious memory, they have never had guests for a meal at their flat, other than Mrs Hudson. She's not a guest, though; she lives there. Not even Uncle Mycroft has ever been invited to eat with them. Tristram is a bit unsettled by the idea of having other people in the space which is usually reserved only for him and Father. At the same time, he finds he wants to share it with Emily. And Doctor Watson and Father seem to be getting on famously now. Surely it will be fine.
"Your papa is the short one," the luggage man is saying to Emily, "and your papa," he says to Tristram, "is the tall one? I see it." He nods contentedly, looking over at Father and Doctor Watson.
The air was suddenly pierced by a sharp, shrill whistle coming from someone behind them. At the same time, a lusty shout of, "Yeeeaaah! Get it, son!" That was Greg.
Tristram smiles in relief and sits back. He likes it at Grandmother's. They usually only go once a year, in the summer, when the sea is not absolutely freezing and there are wild strawberries all over.
"Can you start at chapter three? Tris actually started reading it to me yesterday," Emily confides in a guilty whisper.
It wasn't as if John were going to remember it. Sherlock had got the formula right. Of course he had. He noted, in passing, that it was a full moon.
"Then we're coming to get him now," John declares. "He's already been so traumatised, I can only imagine-"
"That's great. I need you to tell me anywhere it hurts, other than your back." Doctor Watson is kneeling beside him. Tristram hears clothes rustling. He turns his head and chances opening his eyes. Doctor Watson is taking off his jacket, followed by the jumper underneath it. There is blood all over. All over Tristram. Dripping down his arm. There isn't any blood on Doctor Watson that Tristram can see, so it must be Tristram's blood. It seems a waste. Father could do so many nice experiments with it.
Tristram is so startled by that statement that he turns to look at Doctor Watson. Not only is this a twist he didn't see coming, he is deeply disquieted by the suggestion - through the parallel he's drawn in his own mind - that Father might also try to kill himself. Why would he do that? It doesn't make any sense.
Father dumps everything back into the envelope. "Thank you," he says curtly and brushes past Uncle Mycroft to the door, which he holds pointedly open. "We'll be sure to send a postcard."
Tristram knows that's a promise. Just like he promised he'd track down the man who shot him, and he did. Mister Tonga's in jail now and won't ever be coming after them again. Tristram knows Father will protect him, just like he did at the airport. He made himself a target instead of Doctor Watson, Tristram, and Emily. Tristram has understood that now. Somehow, Father knew that Mister Tonga wouldn't shoot him. It's not clear how he knew that, but he did, and he was right. He'll be right this time too. He won't let the woman with the wild eyes and the words that mean more - or perhaps less - than she says, hurt him.
Father stops in the middle of the room. "You can't think I'm going to leave you here. There's no reason for you to stay any longer, anyway. You can continue healing at home as well as here, and there's no sense you expiring of boredom in the meantime."
Without responding, Sherlock pushed his way back out through the children who were now crowding up to the windows to get a better look.
Tristram lets his eyes wander over the other travellers. In addition to those standing in line for rail tickets, there are people meandering between the shops, some laden with two or three purses or backpacks slung across their bodies. Others are walking briskly, like they know where they're going, carrying briefcases or pulling tidy little suitcases on wheels. He doesn't see any security guards. There are also no windows down on this level.
"For Christ's sake," Lestrade said, throwing his hands up in disgust. "You'd think you'd be a little less blasé about this kind of thing after what happened with the Bruhl twins."
"I don't believe that for one second." The immediacy of John's answer struck a chord in Sherlock, almost making him doubt himself. Because John was clearly talking about Sherlock, not Mycroft. He was wrong, though: Sherlock couldn't have a heart, he couldn't let himself be drawn in, to care about someone else, to count on someone else.
Did John want to discuss it now? Was that an opening? He'd taken his hands out of his pockets, flexing his hands. Working himself up to something. Sherlock got the queerest feeling in his stomach, and all of a sudden he was both desperate to hear what John had to say, and panicked at the thought of it.
"Nothing I can say will prepare you, Watson," Holmes explained once we had gained his rooms. He went straightaway to a cabinet and pulled out a box where he kept various accessories and embellishments for his disguises. "I will warn you only that it is a peculiar place, where ladies and gentlemen, alphas and omegas, gather to indulge in an exclusive form of entertainment. It will probably be most helpful if you think of it as a kind of clinic where its members may receive treatments they cannot find anywhere else. Oh, and put this on me, if you please."
"Your dad isn't even here yet," he says, breathless from running, as he looks around. All he can see is blue uniforms as the other children stream past them.
Tristram's surprised too. Father is never to be interrupted when he's on a case. Least of all for something like to check when he's coming back. He'll be back whenever he's done, and he can't know when he's done until he is. But Irene wouldn't know that. Tristram's not about to point it out to her, either. He's getting a bit anxious himself, even if it hasn't even been an hour.
"I know that one!" Emily exclaims, pointing at one of the pictures. "That's Little Red Riding Hood." They turn a few more pages. "And that one's Hansel and Gretel."
Sherlock studies John's face carefully, just a bit too long, before saying lightly, "Just that we'll have to get back to the pursuit of the people behind Tonga and Moran." He smiles and scoots himself closer so his chest is resting against John's leg. His hand disappears somewhere under the covers. "Let's enjoy the rest of our week. One week, and then we can get back to the business of tracking down that little gang."
Their eyes met, both of them stock-still. Sherlock's arse was throbbing, every heartbeat echoed and amplified.
"Too right it won't. You- the pair of you-" Lestrade waggled a finger back and forth between them. "You've dragged this school and your own arses through the mire. If it wasn't for this whole movie business, you'd be off these premises immediately without a job, and without a reference. And you are
Moriarty giggles. "He did, didn't he? Oh, Sherlock," he says, his face falling comically at Sherlock's suddenly thunderous expression. "Admit it. You were a rather negligent parent."
Tristram doesn't remember any more specific ingredients, and neither does Emily, but they say there's dragon blood (green mouthwash) and stewed newt's eyes (pink shampoo) and half a dozen other things, which they mix together in the toothbrush cup. They stir it with a comb, because Tristram draws the line at using his toothbrush, even the back end of it, which was Emily's first suggestion.
"Hah!" John exclaimed, looking up at the lit-up marquee as they crossed over. "That brings back memories."
Lestrade looked unhappy at being singled out, but as the applause from the parents and other spectators swelled, he saw he didn't have any choice, and made his way up onto the stage with an attempt at good grace. When he reached the microphone, the mayor shook his hand, expertly turning the two of them to pose for the camera that subsequently flashed: Moran, Sherlock saw.
It turns out the three numbered keys are quick-call buttons for three phone numbers. Tristram's phone has his father's, Uncle Mycroft's, and Doctor Watson's numbers programmed in. Emily's has her father's and those of her two aunts.
Irene gives him a sidelong glance and withdraws her hand. "Well," she says, noticeably more subdued, "I'll consider you one, and I hope you'll consider me one as well." She drinks the last bit of her espresso. Her lipstick leaves a red mark on the rim of the white porcelain cup. Tristram wonders whether he should try to take the cup with him. If Irene's part of a case, it might be helpful to have a sample of her DNA. But then he remembers that Irene kissed Father on the cheek that morning, so if he needed a DNA sample he could have taken it then.
John hates himself a little that he is torn over whether to do so, although it's not clear which urge is more repugnant at the moment: to trot after Sherlock like some lap dog or to abandon him to a possibly dangerous situation when he is still clearly unwell.
It took John a few seconds to catch up. "Oh, you mean..." Baby pictures. Not embarrassing to Sherlock, but to... "Oh. No, it's okay. I wouldn't have made the connection, I don't think. Course, now I have." John tried for a chuckle in an attempt to keep things lighthearted. Didn't quite succeed.
"You never watched Batman, did you," John said with a mixture of amusement and resignation. "Oh come on," he added at the look on Sherlock's face, "tell me you've at least heard of Batman?"
"But what's she going to do to make it stop?" Tristram wants to know. That's all he really cares about. If he knows what it is that she does, he can do it now and won't have to go to any appointment at all.
Doctor Watson looks down at her and explains patiently, "I'll be right downstairs, and you'll see me in twenty minutes when you come down for lunch." He smiles, although Tristram can tell it's strained. "Maybe you and Tris can play a game or look at a book until then."
"Because it's not safe," she says. Just like that, frank and without preamble; Tristram's a bit shocked. He thought the whole point of coming here to Switzerland was because it was safe, because no one knew where they were. Although Irene found them - Tristram's had his doubts for a while now as to whether it could truly have been a coincidence that she's here too - and the man that Father's meeting with found them as well. Unless Father found him? Either way, people know they're here. Maybe they should have stuck with being the Rathbones and the Browns after all.
Tristram, at her desk, looks at her blankly. He's been making a list of the things they'll need to run a proper experiment, starting with a lab book. He knows they can't really build a time machine. If it were possible, adults would have already done it, and they'd have seen time travelers visiting from the future. But it's still interesting to think about, and actually planning and building a model of what they imagine a time machine would look like - and especially doing it with a friend - is more than sufficient to maintain his enthusiasm.
"Sebastian Moran," a voice announced beside him. Sherlock turned toward it. A man with a buzz cut and piercing, pale eyes was holding out his hand (smoker, heavy drinker but not an alcoholic, has a child but doesn't live with the mother).
When Doctor Watson and Emily arrive, they greet Tristram with big smiles. "Did you come on your own this morning?" Doctor Watson asks. It's a friendly enough question, but there's a slight crease in his forehead.
"Here we are," the man said, cheerful, brisk, the voice of someone used to getting things done. Sherlock's entire body prickled at the sound. It couldn't be. Quick, purposeful steps on the ancient stone floor. But of course it was. The universe was just that cruel. "So, so good of you to come all the way out from the city." Same broad smile, newly receding hairline, a good two stone heavier although half of it was muscle, reaching out to shake the hand of the closest visitor (Molly), scanning the group, pleasant, bland. Stuttering, doing a double take and freezing as recognition settled in. Sherlock had gone through precisely the same process mere seconds earlier as the voice had triggered a cascade of drawers flying open in his mind palace, haphazardly tossing out sounds, smells, words, touches. Things he'd locked up years ago.
Tristram's heart sinks a little. That sounds like it's probably going to happen again. But he wants to make it go away entirely, the way the pain in John's leg did.
Sherlock withdrew, grumbling loudly but inwardly chomping at the bit to find out just what the story was with this John Watson.
John went out to the playground with the class for break time, while Sherlock went back to set up the classroom for the next lesson. On the way, he ran into Mrs Hudson in the hall.
That's good. Father will fix whatever is hurting his back. In fact, just then he hears voices and footsteps downstairs. He makes the effort to open his eyes again, but it's not his father's familiar figure coming up the stairs. Instead, it's a man and a woman wearing big yellow coats with reflective strips over their dark green uniforms. They are carrying a big long board between them, and it develops that they want to put Tristram onto that board and take him away.
Then before Sherlock was fully aware what was happening, John was prodding at his shoulders and chest to get him to lift up, and propping up the pillow and re-positioning himself against it.
This will get pretty explicit following the section break. If you'd rather not have a play-by-play of two grown men going at it, you can skip to chapter 23 at that point without losing (much of) the plot.
"Naturally, although it may be too late by then. Gruner is the type who would push for an elopement if he senses the hounds of the opposition nipping at his heels. But if you will trust me just a little longer, Watson, I believe we can wrap up this end of the investigation quite neatly tonight."
"I didn't specifically, but I did have to mention the fact that your son was shot to the dispatcher. Also, a gun goes off, there's a high probability one of the neighbours will call the police. God, are you even listening to yourself? Tristram was hit by a bullet and could have-" Doctor Watson breaks off and glances inside the ambulance, where Nisha has attached a metal clip to Tristram's finger and pulled back the blankets enough to get a blood pressure cuff around his uninjured arm.
, I thought you had. I can't read your mind, although it probably wouldn't have been much better if I had," he said with a wry, regretful twist to his mouth.
"Wait," John said. "What if..." He shook a finger, as if the answer were hovering in the air in front of him and he was trying to pinpoint its location. "You could call your brother." John raised his eyebrows at Sherlock in question. "Mycroft. He is your brother, right?"
John turns his head to put his lips against Sherlock's neck, up into the soft flesh hidden under the corner of his jaw, where his life pulses hot and thick and fast. He makes a muffled sound, and Sherlock answers with a low rumble in his throat.
But Lestrade wasn't done yet. "And why didn't you fucking answer your phone, either of you?" He pointed back and forth between Sherlock and John.
Of course Sherlock didn't have any of the music with him. It was all back at his house. It seemed a waste of time to go there first, then to the school. There was no reason they couldn't look over the music at his house together. He could sit at the desk, and John could sit on the couch-- No, they both had to be able to see the score. John could sit at the desk, and Sherlock could stand behind him. Or they could both sit on the couch--
"Moments of insanity, anyway," John muttered, turning back to the sink. He set the water on the floor and crouched down to coax Gladstone over. The dog didn't need to be asked twice. He didn't even check with Sherlock, just went straight to the bowl and started happily lapping at it.
She fought the instinct to bring her arms up to cover herself. She'd never enjoyed being the object of Sherlock's scrutiny. It wasn't that she was particularly self-conscious or lacking in confidence, but he had a way of making absolutely everything come up lacking. She didn't want to care what he thought of her. John liked her - quite a lot, in fact - and that's what was important. But maybe part of the reason she was here tonight was that she wanted to prove to Sherlock that she was worthy of John, just as much as he was. That she was brave and steadfast, clever and strong, and that she was just as willing to put her hand in the fire for him.
"Kids are all set. Molly's going to bring the costumes tomorrow for a fitting. It means we'll have less actual rehearsal time, but maybe we could split them into two groups and run through the star song and the chorus for Gabriel's song with one half while the other half's with Molly."
The surgeon who had attended him in the immediate aftermath of the assault prescribed that he remain confined to his rooms for the duration of his convalescence, or until he was fit to resume his usual activities, and I concurred. As this coincided nicely with Holmes' scheme to lull Gruner into a false sense of security by misleading him into the belief that Holmes lay at death's door, we received no complaint.
Sherlock walks over and stops next to John, raising one arm to lean against the door. "I'm not upset. I- This entire situation is new to me. You, and..." He lets his gaze roam over John's face, the folds at the corners of his eyes, the furrows in his forehead, the soft outline of his mouth. "I've tried so hard to keep my work and Tristram separate, for exactly this reason. I knew, someday, someone would find out about him, and use him to get to me. I wasn't prepared for it to be so soon."
"No," his father confirms. He looks again at Tristram's plate with one eyebrow cocked, seeming to notice for the first time the partially eaten piece of pie there. "Did you eat this?"
"Got it." Sherlock gave him a small smile. They'd been walking on eggshells around each other since the ... Sherlock didn't want to call it an argument. Nor even a disagreement. More like a flaying open of all the unacknowledged fears and desires that had been lurking between them. Still unacknowledged. Still unaddressed. And Sherlock still didn't know how to answer John's question. Didn't know if he dared, not even to himself.
This would be the perfect time to let Emily in on the secret he's been carrying around about their fathers, but on the other hand, what she's saying makes sense, too. More sense than all that getting married nonsense Tristram somehow concocted. But it would mean that whatever was going on Thursday night, whatever made his father feel threatened enough to flee to the countryside with bodyguards, wasn't past. On the other hand, they're back here now, so whatever danger there was - or is - can't be all that acute.
"Maybe. But mostly, I think they're trying to keep us safe." He looks down into his milk. Saying it out loud makes it more real. He doesn't want to scare either of them, but all the facts at his disposal point toward that conclusion.
Sherlock moves his leg closer, insinuating it between John's. John draws in a sharp breath, and pushes back, takes a step away, and Sherlock drops his hands.
Sarah put her hands on his buttocks and added what little strength she had left in her arms to his thrusts.
When they get to the first igloo with the check-in desk, they find that the restaurant is actually a series of igloos connected by tunnels through the snow, each one serving as a kind of dining room with three or four tables. There are also separate igloos that can be rented overnight, to sleep in, but they're not going to do that.
"In one of the windows," Tristram says. He's not sure anymore it was such a good idea to say anything.
Father sneaks a sideways glance at Tristram, although most of his attention is still on the plate in his hand. "Are you all right carrying that?" Father asks.
He clicked his tongue in annoyance. "Clearly not. I was squirting the blood at the wall to test the drip patterns."
Finally, John makes Tristram and Emily get under the covers and turns off the light. Rather than retreating to the bedroom, though, he settles himself in the same chair Father sat in the previous night.
John paused, holding the cover up. "There wasn't anything in the water. Other than your usual heavy metals and other unsavouries." He dropped the cover down over both of them. "Do I want to know what you put in my water?"
Mrs Hudson looked up at him from her desk, her face falling. "Oh dear. Didn't anyone tell you?" She stood up (hip still giving her trouble) and came around the desk to stand in front of him, laying a hand on his arm. Sherlock froze as his mind raced ahead: John had had an accident; he was in hospital; he was in a coma; he was dead. Mrs Hudson's next words didn't mitigate the feeling by much: "He called this morning and said he wouldn't be coming in any more," she said, squeezing Sherlock's arm gently.
Sherlock went straight into room 221B and stood with his back to the door and his hands braced on his desk until he heard the door close quietly behind him.
Tristram considers this and comes to the only conclusion he can see. "So... do I have to get a boyfriend?" He starts thinking of all the boys he knows, but he can't imagine wanting to kiss any of them. He can imagine even less any of them wanting to kiss him.
"I shot a man to save your life! That had nothing to do with any plans any more. That wasn't about a preemptive strike, or revenge for Mary. It was to protect you, nothing else."
Or has something to do with a case. Maybe even the bogeyman. That would explain why Doctor Watson got angry and took her away from Emily and Tristram. But it wouldn't explain why he's letting the woman walk away now and coming back alone.
"Doubtful, but I see that I have no choice," Sherlock muttered. Not if he wanted to keep this job, and he did, at least until he figured out something else to do. There was a time when he would have vacated his desk without a second thought, but Lestrade was unfortunately correct in one thing: Sherlock had changed over the past several years. He didn't like to think he was more responsible, necessarily - that would mean he did things because other people expected him to - but he was more aware of consequences, and losing his only source of income from one day to the next with no replacement in sight for the forseeable future would bring all sorts of very nasty consequences with it, things he would really rather not have to deal with like banks and creditors and the unemployment office, along with the even worse prospect of 'I-told-you-sos' and 'oh-Sherlock-you-didn'ts'.
"He was hardly going to harm the raison d'etre of the entire scheme." The 'obviously' remains unspoken but understood.
"Of course," she agrees. "Tristram, Emily, why don't you come inside with me." She reaches out and puts a hand on Emily's shoulder. "We can go right on through to the back-"
John tilts his head over so that his eye is lined up with the end of Sherlock's finger. All of a sudden, he can feel Sherlock's breath on his ear. "The one-" John clears his throat. "The one with the three white lights along the top?"
Tristram isn't sure how he's supposed to answer. He has the impression that his father thinks it's a stupid idea, but Tristram would like it if he could get rid of all these bad feelings. He shrugs. If Father thinks it's a stupid idea, it probably is.
But staying at their house overnight would mean that either they would have to explain that no, he and Sherlock didn't actually share a bed, or else following the path of least resistance and sharing the bed anyway. Either route would involve discussing things with Sherlock beforehand. Which was not an option. The only reason they'd managed to hold their friendship together through all that had happened was because they didn't talk about it.
"She was a holy terror," Doctor Watson announces, mostly to Father, who's leaning in the doorway to the bedroom with his arms crossed. He's been in there doing... something - Tristram's not sure what - since they got back about an hour ago.
The bell rang for the start of classes. Sherlock became aware of the frozen tableau of teachers paused in their morning preparations around them. John was standing there with the corners of his mouth turned down, but it was more hurt than disapproval. It was only now that Sherlock really looked at him: used a new razor that morning, same shirt and jacket he wore to Angelo's (freshly laundered), detoured to the bathroom to comb his hair before coming into the break room. Sherlock took a step back, nearly stumbling against a chair, and had to catch at the back of it to maintain his balance.
"You don't know me, John. Don't pretend you do just because we've had a cosy family dinner and I'm letting you help me with this."
He intended a real trek, then, not just a polite stroll through the Regent's Park around the corner. The paths would still be muddy from the rain; I would have to dress accordingly.
"I would love to know how you ended up as a primary school teacher," John said, with some degree of wonder.
"I don't mind. You know better than most how good I am at waiting for something unlikely, Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock bristles at her lack of trust in John. Although she's perfectly right and, as noted, John is a terrible liar. It would have come out eventually. It's interesting she wasn't able to divine the true source of John's contribution to their daughter's name, however. Mycroft must have wiped the records quite thoroughly.
Father's attention is immediately focused on Tristram. "What is it? What have you seen?" This is one of those times Tristram wishes his father could really see into his head.
Gladstone was at his side as soon as Sherlock's feet hit the floor, and went with him downstairs. Sherlock fished the box of condoms and the little tube of lubricant he'd bought at the shop out of his coat, then went into the downstairs toilet to wash his hands thoroughly and clean himself as well as he could with a wet flannel.
"My invitation, silly. I showed you mine, now you show me yours. I know you're doing the Nativity again this year. Or are you worried you're heading for another minus two-star review?" Moriarty made puppy-dog eyes at Sherlock.
Tristram stays at Uncle Mycroft's often enough that he has his own drawer in the guest bedroom with a set of pajamas, a couple of changes of clothes and toothbrush. Emily's going to sleep in the guest room, too, so there's already a fold-out bed set up crosswise at the foot of the main bed. Tristram says he'll take the fold-out bed, since Emily's the guest.
John opened his mouth. That clearly concerned him. A lot. Despite being hurt by him, he was not sure he wanted Sherlock to go. The case was in an African country, it had to do with a pen drive filled with mafia secrets. John skimmed through the case when Sherlock passed him the petition he had received, he hadn’t thought about Sherlock taking it, reason why he payed little attention to detail.
He couldn’t get up to eat. He started losing his appetite since the three days mark. Now he couldn’t even cook lunch. Going to work was just an excuse to escape what was left of Sherlock in his apartment. Being there reminded him that if he just INSISTED in going, they could’ve been together now.
“Wait ‘til I finish.” Shushed John and continued; “I wasn’t… I am not sure if you are happy in this relationship but what angered me is that you said I wasn’t useful for you.”
“At least you got the cast,” replied John, coming back to that normal tone and comfortable atmosphere, “let’s finish getting rid of that hideous beard.”
“My dear John, I never said we were doing this one together”, said Sherlock aware of what reaction he might receive from his boyfriend. His one and only partner.
“It’s not your fault, and by that I don’t mean that I’m not happy, I am just not used to being so cared for. I have never had someone waiting for me at home or someone that saw every single part of me. I am a troubled person John. I felt off, like I didn’t deserve this and I ran. I ran because I felt the need to do something that reminded me I’m good as I am and that I can be the man you deserve. I… Feel you shouldn’t settle for me. I have all these traumas and the fact that you are constantly questioning how I feel and our relationship… You felt awful here alone while I was trying to prove a stupid point to myself…”
John’s pale face and white ears were painted a shade of red that had never crossed his face before. Every good feeling, every good sensation he felt at some point in his life, none of those could compare to what he has feeling in that exact moment. He was left speechless. John could only do one thing with all he was feeling, so he hugged Sherlock so hard the other had to say that it hurt. To which John repeatedly replied with “I’m sorry”.
“You are the only man I need, the only man I want and I will forever be by your side. Issues or no issues, you won’t be able to get rid of me… Next time let’s talk. I never want to feel what I did when you were gone again. More importantly, you can retake dangerous cases, NOT like this one, but yes dangerous ones.” Said John and as Sherlock raised his eyebrow inquiring what he meant, he continued, “but only if you take me. If it starts to feel too home-y, too “soft”-“
The crying ceased. Right on time because the doorbell rang. John was confused, he wasn’t expecting anyone. And most certainly he wasn’t accepting any cases. He had written in his blog that they were taking a break, he still wrote
“I assume you’ll be going now then” said John in a cold manner when Sherlock was trying to get close to him.
Sherlock quickly stole a peck from John while he was sitting back down. John would never be sure of how he managed to be so fast and have such sharp reflexes even in that state. However, he enjoyed it.
He was already carefully pulling Sherlock inside. Many things crossed his mind, but before all, he had to nurse Sherlock back into some sort of living human being. He was sure the cast, the shirt and new pants, also the somewhat better-looking injuries were Mycroft’s doing. Despite all that, John was not happy with how Sherlock had come back.
It was Sherlock. A wave of relief filled John’s body. However, his eyes made it difficult for him to be completely relieved. Sherlock had a broken arm, hence the cast, the messiest shirt he had ever seen him wear (definitely not his), apart from a black eye. Not to mention he had dried blood over his face and hands. Sherlock looked awful. He was half smiling and it was mostly due to his injuries and the bruises in his face, but also because he didn’t know what to say to John.
“Lord, John… Is that what you think? Is that what you honestly think?” He got up and gently put his hand on John’s shoulder. “No, no, it’s nothing like that you have to believe me.”
Sherlock felt John’s cold hand brush against his skin. His touch made him flinch, not the alcohol as John had thought.
He leaned in to shave carefully and as soft as the razor could go. Suddenly, he stopped as soon as the razor touched Sherlock’s skin. And he leaned back. He was standing close.
With a sigh, he knew he had to talk with Sherlock about how he had felt and try to convince him to talk about his true feelings in their relationship, not to forget he had to get him to tell what happened during this case.
“This won’t hurt so stay still” said John while sitting beside him at the edge of the king-sized bed, cotton soaked in alcohol in hand and ready to disinfect the wound on his head.
He decided it was for the best if he went ahead with his case. As he went down the stairs, John sighed and with his chest feeling tight and bad images invading his brain he whispered:
“Sherlock… I’m sorry for being so cold when you left, I mean I could’ve convinced you to let me go with you… But I didn’t and now you’re, well, a mess. I’m being honest and if I don’t speak out this, I’ll probably explode soon.” Anticipated John.
“No” said Sherlock, cutting John off, “We’ll take the interesting cases but not because I feel too pressured by the warm environment. We’ll take them because I want to share every fun moment with you. I want you to… help me. Help me get more used to a warm, very domestic environment. Because that is what I want to have with you. I want a home with you, a proper home.”
He was in the bathroom, nervous, looking for the shaving cream and the razor. It was right in front of him so Sherlock had to point it out. Letting out a small laugh he grabbed them. Spreading the cream over Sherlock’s face, he furrowed his eyebrows as a form to gather strength. He might not hear what he wishes. Not even the kiss was proof enough that Sherlock wasn’t holding himself back or sacrificing too much while being with John.
John was getting paranoid. Every news regarding Africa and deaths made him feel a tiny heart attack. He was so tense and worried, but most of all he was regretting letting his emotions gain control of how he acted. If Sherlock didn’t come back… If Sherlock didn’t…
“But how can I believe that when you do shit like this?” asked John with a broken voice from holding back tears. He turned to face Sherlock.
Two weeks had passed. John looked dead. He was home from the hospital and as he let down his bag he checked to see if Mycroft had replied to him. Truth be told as soon as Sherlock shut the front door he had texted Mycroft to be sure Sherlock wasn’t getting into anything too dangerous. Then he texted Mycroft again when five days had passed asking if he had any information regarding Sherlock. Anything would have been fine. All he got was a “I’ll look into it” and then nothing. Yesterday had completed the two weeks and John once again texted Mycroft. He tried calling but he never picked up the call.
