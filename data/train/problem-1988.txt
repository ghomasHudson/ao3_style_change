"Fine! You know what? Do as you like! Good luck with that!". John didn't look at her and opened Sherlock's door loudly.
"John phoned me last night, he told me about the message" Sherlock looked at him with a sarcastic expression: "Really? You don't say!"
And then again, Irene had a point. Why was she so right in everything today? What if people realized he had fallen for someone? What if they realized that
"Don't", was all John replied, looking away and opening the door. He looked at Sherlock once again, the mask firm in place now. "Don't", he repeated, and then he walked away.
Sherlock felt his eyes drifting closed by the intensity of all of it. He gasped. "John...", he rumbled.
He stood up in a rush, not caring if he woke John up, and rushed to the living room, looking for the phone that was still on the pocket of his jacket, the jacket he had carelessly thrown to the ground when John had divested him of it. He picked up the phone with trembling hands and dialled the only number he could think of at the moment.
John frowned, trying to remember why he had been angry with Sherlock. Lots of things had happened in the last twenty four hours. Then he remembered.
“No, you didn’t. You’ve been staring at me with wide eyes and haven’t said a word! Should I assume there’s something you don’t want to say?”, John said, the anger clearly coming back to him.
"You've made the consequences quite clear, brother dear", Sherlock said with a fake smile. He turned to look at the violin that was in his armchair. He would like to play but the inspiration wasn’t there anymore, the inspiration had been replaced by a shallow void that Sherlock didn’t know how to fill anymore. There was nothing left.
It was the way he drew, if definitely was. The way his hand would move on his own, fast and slow, the way his fingers smudged the paper and mixed the black with the white, it was the way a curl managed to find a way to his forehead and stand over his eyebrow, giving him an air of geniality, it was the way his eyebrows drew themselves together, expressing his deep concentration, it was the way those eyes reflected the light, it was the-
Melissa leaned a bit closer towards him and said angrily: "How could've you done that to him? How couldn't you tell him you were alive? I didn't want to believe what the news were saying because I thought you would never leave without letting Dr. Watson know where you were heading. You are an idiot!"
him, but this Sherlock didn’t look like that other Sherlock at all. This one looked broken, all of his defenses down, all the facades gone, and this was what was left.
An accident had occurred nearby the hospital. Lots of injured people were being brought. John was incredibly busy but he loved it. As a hospital gurney was carried inside, John's phone started ringing. He took it out from his gown and looked at it quickly. It was from Greg.
Since Sherlock saw John walking in, he forgot about the pain and focused on analysing him, on thinking about what he could tell him, of how to reassure him, of how to make things better. But now that there was no chance to see him again, to talk to him and to explain, Sherlock's determination was replaced by a pointing, stabbing pain taking control all over his body.
Sherlock understood why John had been so dazzled the time he had visited his house: this one was very small and humble, but it was a very pretty house.
"So, track marks", John said glancing down at the arm that had rushed to touch him just a second ago, as if he could see through the shirt's fabric, and Sherlock felt very uncomfortable, he cleared his throat and looked away.
He didn't understand what was wrong, he had done worse, much worse before. This was a somewhat safe dosage. Well, considering how much he used to take before, this wasn't that bad. His body had grown used to morphine, he wasn't supposed to collapse, lest of all, to end up in a hospital.
It had been true to his style, with that mix of surrealism and abstractionism mixed with post-impressionism, and it had carried the signature that made it unarguably
John listened to the sound of it and he was immediately brought back to that moment, years ago, when a bullet had graced him on the shoulder. He was used to that sound, but that one shot sounded completely different, perhaps because he had never been so close to an actual shot.
He had to find a way to protect John without John finding out he was being protected, lest of all without John knowing why he was being protected.
John was embarrassed, it was embarrassing, admitting that he was only human, with his flaws and his weaknesses. It was horrible. He never talked about it, why would he?
"Sleep in here. You need some sleep." John's voice sounded rough and he was still half-slept. Yes, certainly almost unconscious, Sherlock thought.
He picked up his books, didn't look at Irene and turned his back to lose himself in the hall. Sherlock stood looking at him as he left.
John couldn't help but think about the night he left Irene and Sherlock alone at the flat. Why did he do that?
"I needed to thank you, for everything. For saving my life. Thank you, Mr. Holmes, I would be buried right now if it wasn't for you".
Hikes turned to look at John and smiled. "Oh, hello, Mr. Watson. Very punctual. Good. Where is Holmes?"
Sherlock turned his back, and there he was, staring at the window, again, refusing to show any hint of vulnerability. "You are my best friend. You know that, don't you?... And I hated not being able to tell you the truth. Because you, John, of all people, are the person I trust in the most, and I've known it since the very beginning. I knew I could trust you and yet I've been a terrible friend, if I can call myself that."
"Well, I'm the one who decides that and I won't check on you until the morning so let's get you to your room and get some sleep."
"Moran knows and he'll tell Moriarty and the whole school will know. It doesn't make sense. A greaser never helps a...", he hesitated.
which probably defined the other extreme in which he spent half of the time: questioning about their new relationship (relationship?)
He had messed it all up. All of it. He had fucked it. He had ruined everything him and John had slowly built.
he could comprehend the complexity and the imperfection of the human body. Or of John’s body. He didn’t know, he couldn’t tell the difference.
“Hmm, we’ll see about that”, John said flirtingly as he stood up and wrapped his arms at Sherlock’s neck before kissing him deeply and thoroughly. Sherlock
He sighed as he took his backpack and left the classroom, he waved goodbye to Molly and left the room. He wanted to get home as soon as possible, it had been a very long day.
I'd like to believe I saved him. And if I haven't, I'd like to believe that I will save him someday, from others, from me or from himself, I just hope I can do for him what he's done for me. He deserves so much, certainly much more than coming back to find that the one person you truly cared about knows nothing about you and what you were anymore. I want to return the favour. I want to be the person he deserves.
John stormed into his room and shut the door making a very loud noise. He was so angry, he fought with Sherlock all the time but this was different. How dared he say he wasn't his friend? After all they had been through? He had definitely crossed the line.
He looked around, to see if he could find something, anything that belonged to John, his stethoscope perhaps? a few drops on the table next to the glass of water placed on it that might indicate his tremor was back?
Tuesday passed by. Thursday passed by. John didn’t go. He was embarrassed. He didn’t want to face Sherlock again. He knew it was all his fault for acting that way, the damage was already done, and it was fine. It was okay, it’d be.
He had rehearsed it, over and over, what he would say, but he felt a sudden impulse to say so many things at the same time,
Sherlock laughed immediately. It was illogical impossible improbable. John hadn’t left. John was still at Baker Street. John had had sex with him, had slept with him, had kissed him goodnight and had
And there it was, the torso they had drawn on their very first class together, turned into an artwork. Not a masterpiece, no. An artwork.
"Tell me what happened with John Watson! I'm aware he entered here and apparently you know him and me quite well, so tell me what did you do to him?"
In the afternoon, Greg arrived to the apartment. John had been very attentive in case Sherlock would get any new message from Irene. Nothing, it was like he didn't care at all. Was he even going to attend to the date?
Every nightmare was different: the first time Sherlock said it on the car, just as it had really been. The second time, John was crashing him while carrying his books and finding the greaser looking at him with a frown and saying the words with the exact same coldness he had heard them. The third time they were sitting on the bench while Sherlock read a book, and he just...said it. Just like that.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at his brother, clearly trying to deduce something from him, but Mycroft knew better than that so the detective found nothing. "Oh," he said while the initial shock passed. He straightened his back. "So?"
Lestrade remained calm as he replied, "the first time you brought him along on a case, Jennifer Wilson, remember? It had been just a day since you met, and he knew you better than I did after five years. So yes, he does know you, Sherlock. He only forgot he did, but as soon as you met again, all it took was just one day."
"How long had we known each other for, before you-", he couldn't say it, he looked down and grabbed the back of the chair he had kicked, as if it was his only source of balance, the only thing keeping him from falling.
Sherlock sighed at the mention of John's name while he felt his heart breaking inside a little. But he remained stoic and barely rolled his eyes. "No." He said sharply, walking past her, towards the stairs.
Sherlock didn't want to answer, but he felt bad for the girl, he knew it was taking her a lot of effort to pull through the conversation. He kept expressionless. "Sherlock Holmes." He muttered.
Mr Watson kept his eyes fixed on the greaser. Sherlock felt utterly awkward and said with a polite smile. "No, Mrs Watson, I was about to leave..."
John raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything else. He was starting to get to know Sherlock and he recognized a lost cause when he saw one. If Sherlock didn’t want him to see the paintings, he wouldn’t see the paintings, simple as that.
He heard the rustle of things being moved in the bathroom and sighed in relief. He hadn’t. He hadn’t.
Sherlock smiled, just a tiny smile. “Good. So, take the charcoal and make good use of it. Your drawing sucked because you used a cheap, low-quality, school
Sherlock looked at it, walked towards it, examined it closely, then took three steps back and examined it from there, then he turned his head to the side and examined it again. Finally, he turned to look at John, who looked nervous but rushing with adrenaline.
Sherlock smiled and leaned to turn the radio on, and suddenly it became harder for John to keep his eyes fixed on the road. The greaser was making the mimic of playing the guitar to the rhythm of the song, and John couldn't help but laugh.
And in any other moment, in any other place, in any other situation, the Greaser would have replied something different, but in that instant, as some greasers passed by and looked at John frowning, Sherlock just managed to say: "Whatever. Believe what you like."
He closed the door behind him and leaned against it, wondering what was wrong with him. Why couldn’t he stop thinking about Sherlock?
"Wh... What are you doing here?". He looked puzzled, he tried to deduce what could possibly be a reason for her visit but nothing... He looked at her again. Nothing.
John tried to sound as calmed and absolutely-not-at-all jealous as possible. "Could you please explain me what just happened?"
As soon as she said the name John screamed in pain. The sound was muffled by the cloth that was wrapped over his mouth, but it was loud enough to make everything inside of Sherlock crumble and break. “STOP IT NOW!”, he yelled, unable to stop himself.
person would want to date him?" She pointed at the bedroom, and John paced hurriedly towards it, just to make sure Sherlock was still sleeping. Yes, he was in a deep deep sleep, god, he looked fantastic. John went back to the living room and looked at Harry with a frown. "I want to."
"I... God, it just dawned on me: we're close to graduation, and I still have no idea of what I'm going to do with my life. I'm going nowhere, I don't even think my parents will afford it, I doubt it. I'll have to work. Perhaps I should join the army."
It had been exactly eight days since the crime at the house next door happened, and John wasn't really used to seeing these policemen and investigators all the time. Sherlock wasn't there, apparently. John couldn't come too close to the house, so it was hard to guess. He took a deep breath and entered his house. Actually, rock n' roll had been a good therapy. Somehow, he felt much better now.
While Sherlock stared at the mess and the ruins of the power station, he realized his left hand was shaking. Honestly, all of his body was shaking.
He went out of the store feeling angry. Really angry. Sherlock Holmes was an idiot, one moment he was the most incredible person in the world and the next he looked at John as if he were some kind of freaky stalker.
Sherlock smelled Victor’s hair and oh god he had missed that smell so much. He closed his eyes, clenched his fists and told himself he was here for the fucking
John blinked and went back to Doctor mode. "There's your killer. She kidnapped me, tortured me and shot him. I'll testify if necessary but BRING A BLOODY AMBULANCE RIGHT NOW!", he screamed the end of the sentence.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, trying (and failing) to sound calmed when he really was dying of worry, going through a thousand scenarios in his mind. "What did he say?"
John rolled his eyes, he definitely knew what was going on with this Clara girl, but he never dared to mention the subject to his sister, because he knew it was a... Delicate topic. As soon as he fixed his eyes on the building, he felt a pinch of excitement, his
sound like a real warning. And he wondered why? What could she possibly mean with that? It was better not asking, right? He shook away the thoughts and gave her a smile of assurance. "Don't worry Harry, I don't have any plans on being friends with that people."
John wondered what he saw as he looked at his body. He wondered if Sherlock could see a musical composition as scarred and marred and broken as his own body. He wondered if Sherlock could find perfection somewhere along that place.
And then he was gone, and John thought that was probably the most confusing moment ever. Sherlock in fact turned out to be somehow different. And he smiled. At least he didn't get a punch in the face, so their meeting did go well after all. And they had a topic. And he liked Chemistry, well he was definitely not the typical greaser. And the boy had smiled, a genuine, 100% smile. And John smiled wider.
"Cheers." Greg said as he received it. He took a sip and placed it on the coffee table in front of him.
She looked at him and turned a little serious. "It's not about the place, John, honestly I couldn't care less about it, it's just that... I've missed this, all of this, walking by your side, making jokes, and being myself, I'm never afraid of being the annoying Harry I've always been when I'm with you. I know our relationship hasn't always been the best, but things have changed,
He looked at Sherlock, “What do you know about it?”, he said loudly, “you didn’t live it, you weren’t there! You didn’t see! You didn’t lose!”
His mind had provided him the best encourage. It had just given him the perfect reason, the little push he needed. Victor's voice didn't even hold that bitter tone it had when they discussed it, it sounded provocative, inviting, relaxed. Focused.
John looked up and met Sherlock's eyes. "No it isn't. You didn't deserve any of that, Sherlock. Regardless of what you think or what you say, you've saved my life so many times and in so many ways and-" he choked, "God, I almost couldn't save you, you were dying and I couldn't, I couldn't."
He turned to find John with his head against the wall, as he tried to recover his breath. A rush of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin hit him once again. He smiled.
I'm SO sorry for taking so long to update this little one! Last month has been a bit crazy since I was on my semester finals and had literally zero (0) time to do anything that wasn't university-related, and sadly that included writing. I promise next chapter will be up soon! (definitely sooner than this one).
During the whole class, Sherlock spent the time looking at John's neck, at his hair, at his back, wondering what the hell was wrong. John didn't participate during the lesson, which reaffirmed his point! John
On the inside, it felt as if the John Watson who he used to be was a completely different person from who he was now. It felt as if the John Watson who had had the world at his feet and a painting in the Tate Modern had been nothing but a character from a book, an extract of his imagination.
He dreamed of a couple of arms picking him up, dragging him through the carpet and whispering in his ear, telling him to wake up, then caressing his brow with the softest of touches, then the sound of a phone and an ambulance.
He looked at himself in the mirror. War had left scars in every single sense, but as he stared at himself, with his suit and his hair tossed to the side, it seemed as if he had never changed, as if he had never left.
“A melody”, he said, turning to look at John, who was enticed staring at Sherlock’s hand as it moved the charcoal over the paper, “is the succession of pitches. It’s the highs and the lows combined. It’s the union of the light and the darkness, of brightness and shadow. See how it’s taking shape, right here?”, he said as he slowly dragged his fingertip over one of the traces he’d made to highlight the muscles in the abdomen, “I merely did a trace, but it’s the fading, when it fades, you’re not showing, you’re suggesting, and that’s when the human body takes shape.”
He allowed himself to be pulled towards John’s chest and cried against it, regretting all he had thought before. John was all he needed. If someone could heal him, that was John. And he would like to believe that if someone could heal John, that would be him. He had done it before, when he cured his psychosomatic limp. It seemed like it had been ages ago.
"So which clues have you found?" He asked as they passed by the photographers and the detectives, who didn't ask Sherlock nor him why he was there, which John found very surprising.
Just when John thought the greaser would enter the car, he sat on the hood and told John to sit there with him. John shook his head.
"You asked me to stay here tonight, it's cold outside and I want to stay here tonight." -John sounded drunk, but determined, he didn't hesitate to answer.
"Sherlock? Sherlock? Are you okay?". John was starting to get worried, Sherlock was standing in front of the body, he hadn't reacted, he was unable to say a word. He was in shock.
The flames in the ancient fireplace that fronted the foot of the bed cast faint shadows on the rest of the furniture. Mycroft couldn’t stop watching them: they had an entirely aesthetic purpose, the room was too big for them to affect its temperature.
I stopped, breathing heavily. Molly Hooper was standing right next to a retractable table. She forced a smile for me and took several steps back.
‘Just once, can you two behave like grown-ups?’ Mycroft’s ice tone hit me in the ear through the headset.
He started to go missing for days. His bedroom door was always shut. I had to start working at the hospital again so I wouldn’t lose my mind in the infinite silence of our flat.
‘You tell me. You stormed out like you don’t know me. Is it because you missed an important detail and I proved rather useful, forgetting to admire your unique mind?’ I could feel the anger growing inside of me, but Sherlock remained as cold as a stone.
My breath grew short and I hastened to look away. Sherlock Holmes is jealous. Or maybe he’s just a very good actor. In both cases, I felt extremely uncomfortable. That is why I was happy to hear Greg’s voice in my ear.
They say humans can get used to anything. Maybe it doesn’t work for me. Or maybe it just doesn’t work for people who are madly in love.
Suddenly Sherlock bent over and pressed his lips firmly to mine. My head started spinning a little as I felt the metallic taste on my lips and tongue. I closed my eyes and kissed him as hard as I could, drowning my fingers in his hair.
‘Nice,’ I said, expressively pulling the door open a bit more, ‘Well, I better be off. You know he hates to wait,’
He relapsed into silence again and only the wood crackled in the fire breaking it. I bit my cheek, trying to stop myself from saying something stupid again.
Moran slowly moved towards one of the sides of the roof and casually looked down as if he forgot about us for a moment. His movements were sharp, but completely silent: typical walk of a military man. You didn’t have to be good at deductions to see that his whole face was covered in scars of different depth and size. Also, his leg must have suffered a serious injury in some sort of battle and hadn’t completely healed, making him walk with a slight limp. But he still looked like he could kill anyone without even blinking.
The splendid crystal chandelier hung motionless over our heads, gleaming brightly in the light of the candles. Two wide marble staircases led up to a gallery, from which several dozen of figures watched everything that’s going on bellow. Along the walls stood tables with refreshments, lonely guests wandering around them.
‘Not yet,’ Sherlock looked up, his gaze circling around the second-floor balcony. I followed the direction of his glance. I had this strange feeling that I’ve already seen all of these people somewhere, but couldn’t remember where, ‘He will have to come down at some point. It’s his party, after all,’
I moved back, my eyes meeting with his. I pressed my lips together, trying to hold back laughter, touched. He looked like a confused teenager, who let his guard down for the first time. He was one after all.
‘I have no choice,’ I replied and I could see it in his eyes that he knew it too. I pressed my lips together, frowning, ‘I can’t lose you again,’
But before I could open my mouth, Sherlock just walked out to the kitchen and a moment later I heard the door of his bedroom shutting.
I came to the house of the victim, questioned his wife, who seemed quite relieved with her husband’s disappearing, looked around his office in the house they’d been ranting, but couldn’t find anything to help the case. Greg never asked me this kind of favour again and we ended up just occasionally meeting for a beer.
‘How do I know it’s not another lie?’ I whispered. Sherlock’s mouth opened slightly as if he wanted to do or say something.
That Sherlock guy really got into boss’ head. Sebastian couldn’t understand what was so special about him: pain in ass junkie, whose pressure point was his little soldier gofer. Clear as day. Yet he couldn’t stop talking about him and it was driving Moran crazy sometimes.
I turned around to see Sherlock, his eyebrows and corners of his lips slightly raised. He reached his hand out and I took it, holding my breath. I feel like it became my initial reaction to any interaction with him.
I barely opened my eyes, shutting them back at once. The sunlight had already brightened the whole room and I desperately tried to hide my face from it in the pillow. When my attempts fully failed, I forced myself to sit up in the bed, rubbing my eyes.
‘No, but he doesn’t talk to me…’ I felt Mrs Hudson’s hand squeezing my shoulder and I looked up to see her smiling sympathetically.
I spent two years sleepless, spending every night just thinking of what would I tell Sherlock if he was alive. How I would confess to him about everything I understood when he was gone.
Sebastian was quickly moving down the narrow corridor and passing countless metal doors on the sides. Near each one of them were standing guards like pieces of furniture, as useful, as impersonal and as silent.
It was enough to just hold his hand, his fingers twitching around mine, listening to him raving and calling my name so tenderly as he’d never do sanely.
‘I…I…’ I had a sudden chocking feeling, eyes slowly filling with tears and I could barely see anything before me now. Everything started fading to black.
I swore under my breath, stroking his back. When he finished, I helped him to lie back and a moment later he blacked out.
‘Good evening, gentlemen,’ the butler gave me a cool glance, chill emanating from his hazel eyes, and then looked up at Sherlock, ‘Your names please?’
‘Getting into the character,’ Sherlock replied, shrugging his shoulders, ‘And stopping you from revealing your identity, Mrs Holmes,’
The Barth’s looked exactly as I remembered. Some of its narrow tall windows glowed in straight rows, lightening up the dark street. My eyes involuntarily went up to the edge of the roof and everything went cold inside of me. Memories like flashes played back in my brain and I closed my eyes to get rid of the image that I could still see too vividly.
‘Oh yes! Of course…’ the man looked down, his lips pressed together, uncomfortable. He turned away to push the doors open and then a rehearsed smile irradiated his face again, ‘Enjoy your evening, Mr Holmes,’
It was almost morning when I was able to fully relax. I brought a kitchen chair and sat right next to the bed to react quickly if needed.
‘I know, I know,’ she put her hands up, ‘It’s none of my business. I am just worried about him. He doesn’t look very good, does he?’
‘John! Get ready. I’ll call a cab,’ we heard his muffled voice from the bedroom, ‘We need to find you something decent to wear,’
I put an ear to the door, waiting for any other sign of somebody’s presence. It’s been several seconds of silence when I heard the bed creaking as someone landed on it with another moan.
A light nod and the orchestra played again. Rhythmic melody gradually made everyone pair up and glide over the parquet floor. We had to step back to the wall not to get knocked down by an extremely encouraged couple.
I never felt this way before. Like all of my fantasies came to life, but I never thought it would happen this way.
‘One more miracle for me, Sherlock,’ I took a sharp breath, ‘Come back to me. That is all I’m asking for and all that I need,’
Sherlock stared at me for a moment with an unreadable expression. His hand was still holding mine and I could feel his fingers tightening around my palm. I couldn’t understand what he was thinking about, but his eyes were filled with a strange inexpressible sadness like he knew something, but couldn’t say it out loud.
At first, I tried to talk to him, like the old days. But he kept dodging, and in the end, all my attempts failed. But I knew something was wrong. Something about him changed and sometimes his silence was driving me crazy even more than any of his irrelevant deductions would in the past.
Maybe I should just stay in the dark and enjoy what we have. Pretend that I didn’t see him dissolving arms of the main suspect in a murder in aggressive acids in our kitchen right after the breakfast. Keep ignoring Lestrade’s calls. I have nothing to tell him anyway, I don’t know anything.
‘So you think I am not the same?’ Sherlock looked at me as his slanting eyebrows rushed down together in a frown. “Damn it. It is the first time he’s talking to you, John Watson, and you ruin it right away.”
A girl with a tray came out of nowhere and offered us the drinks with such a sweet smile that I couldn’t resist smiling back and taking one of the glasses. She was about to say something, but then glanced at Sherlock and changed her mind. A second later she was gone.
‘Good morning, Lestrade,’ Sherlock interrupted, getting up and looking at him unconstrainedly, ‘Fancy a coffee?’
I was kissing him hard, but at the same time softly as if I tried to show him what storm of emotions was born inside of me every time he was around. Every time he looked at me. Every time he called my name.
So I hope you'll enjoy it! Comment your thoughts, tell me what you think and feel free to contact me on ig to propose your ideas :)
‘It was you, wasn’t it?’ I swallowed, making myself continue, ‘The body in the abandoned house. Was it your doing?’
I can’t tell for how much time we stood like that. I breathed in the scent of his skin. It was a mixture of his own and a coconut shower gel. This bastard used mine again. I chuckled, wrapping my arms around his shoulders. Sherlock responded with a light stroking down my back.
I want to dedicate this chapter to an amazing girl Zara, who hypes me up like crazyyy and is always so happy to see me posting (love you girl)
‘Of course you do,’ my voice trembled slightly at the beginning, but I did my best to make it sound natural, ‘You just need some time to get used to it. No one can stay the same after going through such stuff,’
The car’s wheels silently glided on damp asphalt carrying us further and further away from the London full of evening bustle. Streetlights and passing cars grew fewer. The narrow gloomy suburb street seamlessly turned into a deserted highway.
I clenched my teeth, watching him and slowly pulling out the gun. Suddenly he looked at me and tilted his head. Something about his gaze turned my heart cold in terror. I was very familiar with that crazy look.
“Damn it,” It must be Sherlock. But what if it’s not? What if it’s some kind of a crazy criminal, who is obsessed with killing both of us? Then my little butter knife won’t be much of a help."
I know it’s not easy to move on from my own experience, but seeing her constantly trying to flirt with him even if he didn’t respond was the last thing I wanted to see.
‘It’s okay,’ the corners of his lips twitched up, his hand stroke my cheek, reassuring, ‘You know I’m extremely enduring,’
‘And you did,’ he replied sharply. I could see that he was getting annoyed. He always did when we were fighting. Like I was boring him with my stupid social standards of friendship, ‘What is the problem then?’
I sighed and laid my hand on his arm. Sherlock looked up at me and for a moment we just kept still, both thinking about something.
He was so close now that his hands, holding me tight, were the only thing that kept me from falling. I couldn’t remember what were we even doing this for. All that mattered was his other hand on my waist slowly pulling me closer to him. It was a sort of tremor, a boiling of the blood, against which no effort of the will availed anything.
‘Hm... That’s great, thanks,’ I gave her a light smile, pointing at the pile of papers before me, ‘I still have some work to do, so I think I’ll stay for a bit,’
I almost had a heart attack when he appeared in the kitchen not wearing anything, but undies and a wide-open robe. I swallowed hard as I tried not to trace the tiny water drops going down his torso and looked down at my royal breakfast. I was sure that I wouldn’t take even a bite now.
I even felt a tiny bit jealous: just a minute ago his voice was just as trembling cause of me. And now he was running around the bedroom as excited as a child in the Christmas morning.
‘We already are, Sarah,’ her face lightened with the most genuine smile and I couldn’t not respond to her with the same, ‘I’d love to meet for a coffee sometime. With pleasure,’
‘Indeed he did, Sergeant Donovan,’ I turned to her, making myself sound as coldblooded as I could. I had a lot of experience after all. So many years by Sherlock’s side weren’t an entirely wasted time, ‘Now you can finally try your luck and leave me alone,’
‘You don’t understand,’ he said, taking a step back and pointing at the building across the street, ‘Right here was sitting an assassin who would’ve killed you without even blinking if I did anything out of plan! I had no time for talking!’
Mycroft gave him a mock sigh, poorly concealing the smile, and pressed himself to Greg’s back, covering both of them with a silk sheet. His nose touched the warm skin and he unwittingly breathed in the dizzying scent. His own kind of drug.
My gaze involuntarily fell on Sherlock’s lips. They were slightly opened and he was so close I could swear that if I moved three inches closer… Maybe it was just the stupid adrenaline rushing through my blood or the fact that he just “rescued” me on in front of the whole police station, but just for a second, I felt like he also thought about it and even got a little closer.
‘Oh piss off, would you?’ I grimaced, pushing him in the shoulder with mine, and walked out of the room while he followed, suppressing a laugh.
It was about nine in the evening. I sat in my chair and kept staring at the fire in the fireplace in front of me. My eyes were slowly closing and from time to time I could find myself being almost half asleep. Sherlock was standing near the window. I couldn’t see his face, but I could almost feel his tension.
Somewhere deep down inside I still couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe that he was… He was gone.
Mycroft didn’t reply anything, but his eyes flashed with poorly hidden irritation. Greg cleared his throat in a pathetic attempt to defuse the situation. But it didn’t work. An awkward silence fell for a solid minute, during which Holmes brothers were having a silent battle of their boundless egos.
Sherlock seemed to be sleeping peacefully for several hours now. I touched his forehead to check the temperature once again and took a look under the sheet to see if the bandage was clean.
The quiet gentle voice didn’t suit Jim at all. But it always helped him to fool the ones, who needed to be fooled.
I slowly moved through the kitchen, grabbing blind a knife from the table. It was so dark I could barely distinguish the white door before me. I stopped when I reached it and looked down at my weapon. The light from the window lit up the knife, the end of which was covered in butter. I swore to myself silently. Years of army service and that’s my first choice?
‘A plan, huh?’ I stepped closer, looking right into his eyes and fighting the urge to punch him right in the face, ‘You had the time to come up with a perfect plan to fool everyone and pretend you were dead with your psychopathic friend, but no time to tell me?!’
‘I do,’ I opened my mouth and froze for a moment, not willing to sound stupid, but then continued, ‘But can you please not stand so close to…’
For a second I thought I broke him like a Waldo, but then he turned off the stove and fully turned to me, grabbing both of my hands in his. I stood there, frozen, while Sherlock bent to leave a light kiss on them and looked up at me. My eyebrows went up in surprise and all I could think of is how not to black out right here and right now.
Not waiting for the answer, its owner sat up and put his head on Mycroft’s shoulder. Surprised by himself, Mycroft wrapped his arm around his shoulders, pulling him closer. Only his proximity was pleasant for him for some reason.
‘T-That was my first kiss,’ Sherlock mumbled when we let go, our foreheads resting on each other. I couldn’t help, but smile to myself, ‘My first real one,’
I pressed my lips together, my whole body shaking in response to his words. It wasn’t true. Or was it? The thoughts in my head were rushing from side to side and I couldn’t concentrate on anything, but his eyes.
I looked up to see if anyone was watching: Molly and Greg were quietly talking beside the opposite wall while Mycroft was looking at them with much curiosity, but was probably too proud to join them.
‘I am never leaving you again,’ his lips touched my ear. A strange feeling of warmth went all through my body and I hated myself for it. I heard him chuckle, ‘I’d be lost without my blogger,’
I was walking down the corridor lightened up by the long flickering lights, looking around and feeling like some kind of a thief. The Barth’s was officially closed for visitors now and actually, I had no rights to be in here, just like Sherlock, even though it never really bothered any of us. But after his “death” I felt like there was no point to come here. Not like I wanted to.
‘Ghm,’ I cleared my throat, wrapping the coat around myself better, but noticed the red stitches around the buttonhole. I frowned, puzzled, ‘Sherlock, that’s not my coat,’
‘Yes! Sherlock asked me to, actually,’ her face brightened up with a quite proud smile and I felt slight irritation, ‘He said he’d be needing the rooftop for something and I stayed to be the one, who locks it up today,’
‘I should’ve stayed with you even though you acted like a total jerk,’ I said, my body starting to shake.
John pretended to be affronted for a moment, “you’ve only seen one of my paintings!”, he said with a smile and a frown.
Mycroft cleared his throat and sat up straight. He looked down and stared at his umbrella for a long moment before finally replying, "I am afraid I wasn't the one who brought you here, Sherlock."
John moved out for a moment and coughed. Sherlock threw an arm over his face, filled with embarrassment. "Sorry, sorry", he said.
He opened his eyes and the pain got even worse. It took all of his will to stand up and get himself ready, his head was pounding harder and harder.
John put his hand in his pocket and felt the paper Molly gave him earlier, and even though he didn't want to give it to him, he realized this was the only excuse he could find to actually talk to him.
"Fine." She said without believing one of the words her brother just said. "Just be careful, alright? I told you, those greasers are not that nice."
A huge painting was staring at him, almost two meters tall. Sherlock looked at it, unable to understand why he felt so drawn to it. There was nothing in the painting. Well, not nothing, there was an awkward landscape in tones of red and orange, not quite yellow, and black circles scattered all around it, as if they were shadows mingling with the landscape. The mixture of colors was somehow unsettling, simple yet complex, and Sherlock quirked an eyebrow at it, not quite understanding it, but understanding it all the same.
Sherlock looked up and then closed his eyes. She sat down next to him. "I really admire your work. Doctor Watson's blog is just incredible."
“-You and me, living together, how was it? Was it good? Did I drive you crazy? Was it too difficult?”
When he finally opened his eyes, he stood up and looked determined. "I want to have the same procedure."
“Yeah, I’d be surprised if you did, he’s a bit of a traditionalist, moves in different circles. Focuses only on human bodies. His paintings are famous amongst London’s elite, but not among us, to be honest.”
He kept drawing, feeling more focused than he had in a very, very long time. His hand wasn’t trembling at all, it all simply worked. Sherlock had moved apart from him but just slightly, now he was simply staring out the window, not pressuring John, nor criticizing him, simply waiting patiently.
The greaser walked in few minutes later and John just stared into the notebook as if the world’s fate depended on it. He could tell from the corner of his eye by the way Sherlock walked, he was even more exhausted than John.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I have no intention of keep talking to you." He turned to look at John again who didn't look back at him. "I'll see you tomorrow, John." And he walked away.
He didn’t say anything, he simply took John’s chin and lifted his head. He heard John’s intake of breath.
He grabbed some pills and swallowed them without eating anything else. He felt his brain might explode if he did anything to force it, and that included eating.
John was startled for a moment, then looked right next to Molly and realized: Molly's friends were sitting with them too, so now there were five boys on the table, and four girls. Well, that was a first for Mike's friends and himself. "Hi Molly, how are you? Um- I'm sorry. I had been- busy." He looked instinctively to the door.
“There”, he dragged a deep breath, “something went wrong. Very, very wrong. I had it all planned, I had worked it all out, it had to work… but then it didn’t”, he felt a surge of rage taking over himself. He sighed, “And they caught me.”
And he definitely didn't want to. He didn't just allow everyone into his house. It seemed like some kind of private space where he could be himself and he felt really vulnerable when he opened the doors of his house to someone else. Well, not that he had the experience, the only one had been John, and it didn't finish well in the end. He tried to think of polite ways of saying no.
He stood silent for a moment, knowing that blaming Sherlock for everything wasn't going to help him and pretending to hate him wasn't going to make him actually
He leaned back and stared at it. He smiled softly at the color of the skin, it really reminded him of John, and although the shape was a bit flattering, it was as if John’s essence had somehow spread all over the painting. It brought a kind of magic and a kind of life Sherlock hadn’t seen before in his own works.
Sherlock, without saying another word, opened the door wider. John entered, taking a bit of time to climb up the stairs as he was holding his cane, and in the meanwhile, the detective could realize John's left hand was clenching and unclenching into fists. He grimaced. That was not good. Not good at all.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, the function. You paint abstract things and surrealistic things and mix colors everywhere but surely you must have done at least one or two drawings in charcoal. Now tell me, what is it for?”
John closed his eyes, annoyed by Sherlock. He knew Sherlock was right, but he was trying his best, the problem was-
"Yes. Of course", John looked as if he wanted to say something else, but he kept quiet for a second, simply staring at Sherlock. Then he dragged a deep breath and carried on, "look, ever since the first moment I stepped on that flat, well the first moment I remember, it felt more like home than the dull flat I'd lived in. The skull, the eyes in the fridge, the mess, the dust...it was all oddly familiar. I simply can't explain, it's as if my brain had forgotten it all, but my body hadn't, and I felt drawn to it. Since the very beginning. Drawn to you."
It was Thursday morning and Sherlock was already wanting to quit school completely, but he forced himself not to, he had caused his parents enough problems, so he decided he was going to end this year. After all, it was the last one, and then he would be free. But his determination seemed to fade away when his clock sounded loudly at 7 and Mrs Hudson arrived to wake him up.
"It's not so obvious to me."-John said, his tone turned into an awkward kind of voice. He was uncomfortable. He knew it was a bad idea bringing her to the house, but she had insisted so much on it, she was lonely, things with Clara were really, really bad and she looked so unhappy, he wanted to help her, she was desperate to meet this Sherlock guy John had been writing so much about in his blog, well of course she had seen him before, she read the newspapers and watched the news, but she wanted to meet him. He looked at Sherlock, who was so focused in his new book that didn't even realize about all the things Harry just said. Greg, on the other hand did. He just looked at them, speechless.
It was Wednesday, he had up until Saturday to make his mind about it. He sighed and closed his eyes, and suddenly his mind was filled with old memories of a certain greaser and that lovely smile, and his eyes, and...
He blinked. “Yes”, he said after John drew a particularly good eyelash. “That’s the perfect shape. Keep it.”
Sherlock's work had shown him a lot of things. Too many things. He'd seen it all. He really, really had. He couldn't expect anything to take him by surprise.
He focused instead on the myriad of possibilities ahead of him: he had been able to paint again. He had had an idea and he had put it in the canvas. And it had
John turned to look at him with a raised eyebrow. "Are you okay?", he asked half-jokingly, half-worriedly.
He was stepping over blood. He could see it clearly now. The problem was not that, for God's sake, he was a doctor, he had seen far too much blood in his life. The problem was where the path of blood was leading up to.
, with the seductive, passionate, endless possibility of more, he wanted nothing but time to pass by
“Took you long enough, Sherlock. I waited and waited. So many clues I thought I was being far too obvious”, she shrugged, “I guess that’s just what love does to you.”
John laughed. It was a humourless, rage-filled laugh. Sherlock felt his fists clenching, he had never feared John Watson as much as he feared him in this moment. "To erase Sherlock Holmes."
John stared at him for a moment, completely silent, his mouth slightly open, looking adorable and soft and perfectly kissable. "Alright."
Sherlock always did that, didn’t he? He tried looking for perfection because he thought it would heal him, it would make him reach his own, yet he was…he was only
Then he looked away because that was what John Watson did and Sherlock stared at him speechless because it felt like he was talking to John Watson, the John Watson he'd left before it all went to hell, before he burned the last scope of light that they'd had.
"I'm sorry", it was all Sherlock could say, and he wished that word meant more, that that word would convey all of what Sherlock was feeling at the moment. "I'm sorry", he repeated once again, feeling his voice choking into the tangle of emotions that were locked in his throat, desperately looking for a way out. "-I never thought..."
Sherlock took a look at some of the cases, murders, missing people... the usual. He kept his eyes fixed on the folder, silently. Greg took this as a way of implying his presence was no longer needed.
Sherlock went on detective mode, it was the only way it would ever work out with Victor, the only way to put his feelings (except he didn’t definitely didn’t have any). “I’m doing an investigation-”
It happened like that. Just that simple. Sherlock already knew that he loved John, that much was obvious, but that he was
Sherlock hummed and moved two of his fingers to wave her goodbye, she giggled and left. He looked at her again as if she had lost her mind. Probably she had.
Sherlock flinched, but loosened the hold of the jacket's collar, setting Sebastian free. As soon as he did, Jim turned to look at Sherlock, with an expression between marveled and surprised. Then, with a smile, he nodded at the boy. "Go ahead Holmes. You can talk to Johnny boy. Just be careful of not breaking his glasses."
John looked at him and smiled back, then his attention turned back to the picture he had been staring. “It’s wonderful. All of it. Excellent work you did, Mike.”
"I was taking your pulse", John whispered. "I couldn't find it. People were crowding you, pushing me away, and I felt nothing, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't."
John bit his lips. He looked down to see Sherlock’s fingers as they hovered in the air, uncertain what to do. His long, thin fingers. God, those fingers.
He tried to calm himself down, he closed his eyes. He opened them again, the grass wasn't greener, the grass was grayer, everything  was grayer, everything was turning colorless.
He shook the thought away and stood up, still holding John's hand, holding it tightly. They walked towards the bedroom and as soon as the door closed, John put his arms around Sherlock's neck and kissed him.
Which was confirmed as soon as he saw the happy couple walking hand by hand and smiling. They got into Irene's car (Irene was driving) and they looked so genuinely happy, which made John feel genuinely heartbroken. Though he didn't know how that feeling was. He felt...hollow. Yes, probably a heart break. Or maybe just a heart attack.
He dragged a deep breath and slowly caressed John's back, until he held him by an embrace, a soft reassurance that he would be
"I don't believe you." Jim said shaking his head. "You know what I think? I think you're desperate for attention, for being
Thank you so much for your comments! They did work and although I had an incredibly busy week here I am giving you the next chapter! :3 Hope you like it! :D
They were received by the detective inspector, who looked at John suspiciously. "Hang on. Who is this guy?"
“-Plus, you did a great job tonight. You deserve some spare time”, Sherlock said quietly, in that deep, soothing, profound and complex voice of his.
John thought to himself. As soon as he climbed upstairs towards his bedroom, the excitement he had felt earlier that day turned into sudden panic: What if he didn't know how to behave in a party? What if he drank too much? What if there were too many people and he would just be rejected?
“You don’t have such a good imagination, you couldn’t have possibly come out with all of that”, he said with a laugh.
John felt himself blush and grabbed his coat, clearing his throat. “I- I’ll see you on Thursday, then.”
"This-" he said moving his hands through the air as they left the car. "-is the place where I buy everything.
The police seemed lost, they were taking way too much time to solve the case. Was Sherlock getting slow? John thought maybe he should go and see if he was alright, if he needed anything, but then he thought it through and convinced himself it was the worst idea ever. And it was.
John was sitting against the door, with his knees pressed against his chest, his hands covering his face, as he desperately tried to bring air back to his lungs because
Had they just been friends? Really? When Sherlock could do nothing but hold onto his memory of John to keep himself sane while he was being tortured in Serbia? When that memory was the constant reminder that he still had something to fight for,
Sherlock stood there, thinking, had John experienced panic attacks? Before the fall, Sherlock had seen John struggling with nightmares and flashbacks produced by PTSD, but not a panic attack on itself. Had John experience any after the fall? Had those been the ones that drove him to the edge? The ones that forced him to choose it was better not remembering Sherlock at all than having Sherlock’s memories haunting him? He closed his eyes with a sigh. It would never stop hurting, he would never stop regretting leaving John alone.
I'm VERY sorry for not updating lately, I had been very busy but I'm back and I promise Chapter 4 will be up soon, enjoy! :3
Sherlock started walking faster, he felt exhausted, completely exhausted, but the adrenaline was stronger and it was what was motivating him to keep going. Well, that and the idea that he could save John Watson.
John closed his eyes and laid his head on Sherlock's chest while he mumbled something the greaser couldn't quite hear. Then John started talking a bit louder. "...it was you!"
"Oh no, no, no, you're not going there, that's a huge mistake, do you hear me? A huge one!". He was already walking to Sherlock's room. She grabbed him by the arms, but she couldn't move him. She finally gave up trying.
Well, John had been awake for a long time. He always got up early on the first day of school, probably it was anxiety. Holidays seemed longer than usual and he missed his classes, now it was last year and he was going to make good use of it. There was so much to learn this year, and then university. He had no idea what to do yet, he had a whole year to find it out.
He wondered for a second why he hadn't done this before. He had gone through this for... seven? was it seven? days, when he had the solution 8,5 seconds away.
Sherlock couldn't help but laugh. "I grant you that much", he said, throwing the pillow back to John.
‘I already have one,’ he gave me a barely noticeable smirk and leaned back to the body. I shook my head when Greg laughed shortly.
‘Mycroft Holmes,’ he said, raising his chin in the coldest manner possible. For a moment, I could see the resemblance, but it was gone at once.
Only one person in the world can make that sound. I turned my head to the right as I felt a warm small hand on my shoulder and smiled.
Everything went spinning before my eyes and I tried to attack back, but was rewarded by several more punches in the chest and ribs. I groaned in acute pain, not able to strike back: it was so dark I could barely see the silhouette of the attacker.
I had to take several breaths before I could let out even a word. I felt like something was clenching my chest. Mycroft frowned a little in disapproval. It’s not like I expected him to understand.
‘It’s insignificant, Gregory,’ we heard some fuss, in the result of which Mycroft took over the mic, ‘Do you see Magnussen?’
‘Jane Underwood. Thirty-eight years old, married, two kids,’ Greg said in an almost casual tone as Sherlock and I followed him up the stairs.
The blood in my ears kept pumping as I stood up and rushed up the stairs to my bedroom. I shut the door behind myself, pressing my back to it. I closed my eyes.
‘I will do it,’ Sherlock turned around at me with a look like I was insane. Well, even if I was, he was the one to blame for that, ‘Whatever it is, I will do it,’
‘What the…’ I looked up, meeting with his blurry gaze. I was angry, but not even at him. I was angry at myself. He needed me and I wasn’t there. And now he might…
‘Morning…’ I mumbled, hiding my face in a coffee cup. He pressed his shoulder against the fridge, folding his arms on the chest.
‘It’s not like I was against it,’ I sighed, looking around the room. I turned back to Sherlock, whose chest was heaving from uneven breathing, ‘Do you have any aid kit here? Mine is upstairs,’
He reached the big blurred glass door and reached out to knock, but stopped. There was no need. The only reaction possible if now was the bad mood time was something heavy to be thrown at you once you enter. You could only hope it’s not the bad mood time.
‘Don’t worry, sergeant,’ Sherlock sat up to give her an indulgent look, ‘Your people have already done it for me. The integrity of the crime scene can’t be any more damaged,’
‘Several weeks before I got a message from Moriarty,’ my muscles tightened. Only the mention of this name made me fill in with rage every time. It meant there was nothing good to expect, ‘He said that he planned something massive towards the whole England and not even Mycroft would be able to stop him. And he needed my help…’
‘I will tear this dirty suit off you the second we get home, understood?’ Sherlock whispered. His pupils dilated, driving all the blue from his eyes. I bit my lower lip and looked up, acting like I was in deep thinking about his proposal. He growled quietly, leaving another quick kiss on my lips and biting them in passing.
‘For God’s sake, Sherlock…’ I sighed while continuing to hypnotize my breakfast victim sandwich. I would never expect myself to get so excited and happy about somebody’s beheaded body, ‘A person was murdered,’
‘Sherlock,’ I swallowed, interrupting. Sherlock frowned, cut short in the middle of a word. I couldn’t look away from a familiar face in the crowd. The man grinned the fierce grin and it gave me the creeps. Just like the last time.
‘Everything is fairly obvious, Lestrade. I have no idea why would you ask us for help,’ Sherlock said bored, ‘Even you could’ve come to a decent conclusion,’
‘Oh yeah, right,’ I moved my eyebrows up and down, glancing at the door and thinking through the ways to escape this awkward talk, ‘Hm, so you are working late today?’
I was about to turn around the corner of our house when I felt a sudden strong push on my back causing me to fall face forward. And before I could get up and understand what happened, someone grabbed me by the arm and turned me on my back, planting a brutal shot to the face.
At that moment I thought I made it up. But looking back now I understand that it was the moment I should’ve got it.
Before I could see the source of the sound Sherlock frowned and pushed me back with one arm, standing before me like a shield.
I pressed my lips together, holding back a burst of laughter, while Sherlock’s pale cheeks flushed barely noticeable.
I stayed beside his bed the whole night. The wound was serious, but thanks god no vital organs were affected. Once I handled the bleeding, I could finally calm down.
‘Go to sleep, Gregory,’ he said, looking down at silver-haired head shining under the moonlight, ‘You’ll be babysitting my brother again tomorrow,’
‘That’s exactly what I’ve been doing for several months now,’ Mycroft smirked, getting a light punch in his shoulder. He brushed his hand through Greg’s hair, ‘It’s really late,’
‘We are absolutely not,’ I said, bringing up a storm of emotions on Sherlock’s face, but continued, ‘Why does he need us there though?’
John took a step back, trying to increase the distance between them, trying to get as far as possible, Sherlock stopped looking at John and looked down. "I'm sorry, did I scare you?"
And none of those compounds were the ones causing the current pain that was spreading throughout his body.
"Fuck you, Sebastian", was all Sherlock replied, but before he could finish the sentence, Moran was going to his house running and yelling "JIM! YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS!!!!"
He had expected to see John soon, after all he had been the one to check on the vital signs, which meant that he had been the one keeping an eye on him.
"Good evening to you too, Sherlock." John recognized the voice immediately and widened his eyes. "I see you brought your little...
“Do you seriously think I only kill for the sake of it? Please Sherlock, I enjoy playing with their brains, with the memories they tried so hard to forget, I enjoy seeing their eyes, them begging me to stop the pain. It’s more interesting. Funny, isn’t it? The way love hurts and harms.”
John groaned. Sherlock remained still and silent. He felt all his strength falling  apart, leaving only weakness and a kind of pain he could only relate with a deep empathy with John.
Reluctantly, he stood up, feeling a sharp ache on his lower back, but he ignored it. He went to fetch the sandwich and found a note attached to it.
Whenever Sherlock felt trapped, when he was chained, or in pain, like in Serbia, he retreated to his mind palace to find John there.
He tossed the money hurriedly at the cabbie before walking (running) out. As soon as he entered to Scotland Yard, he found Donovan standing in front of him, her arms crossed. "Freak, your husband's looking for you."
John started the car and turned to look at Mycroft, who merely nodded, smiled mischievously and said: "Good night, John."
The rest of the group turned sometimes to look at the couple sitting and absorbed in conversation and would raise their eyebrows, surprised. John didn't notice them.
“Some are at the forefront, some at the back. Make the ones in the forefront darker”, Sherlock said excitedly.
John stared at Sherlock’s back with a frown, “o-kay”. He had been planning on taking the tube because honestly he didn’t have too much money and he couldn’t afford spending it on cab rides. But he could make an exception. For Sherlock.
John reached a hand and touched the soft, precise brushstrokes that blended with the canvas. He smiled wider and turned to look at Sherlock. “They’re beautiful. But you know that already.”
"Then tell...Sherlock to stop interrupting us and that if he is so bored he can join." She said looking at the greaser who was no longer looking at John, but at the floor, tapping his feet to the ground.
That was all Sherlock heard. He felt the blood that had gone cold now rushing to his head, a thousand scenarios going in his mind.
"We'll see about that." She said smiling and walking away, she passed over the table and took two other cups of beer and opened the backyard door handing one of them to Jim as she smiled.
As soon as they were out of sight, Sherlock walked into Lestrade’s office, where he found Melissa looking at the patient’s records, she had already placed Isabella’s apart, and Sherlock took a look at it.
"He deleted his blog." Sherlock said suddenly. The day after he had seen John again for the very first time, he stood up in a rush and opened his laptop, holding a strong desire to read what John used to write and remind himself of how things used to be. As soon as he typed the URL, he stood frozen in shock, reading over and over again the same announcement, as if he couldn't believe his eyes:
He stared at the pictures again. Forceful stab, but they were different from the ones that had been provided to Alice, according to the autopsy. The angles were different, meaning that whoever killed all those people held the knife in a different way than Michael Jones.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. He didn't feel like talking, he actually never did, but Sebastian and Greg were also looking at him expectantly and as he exhaled the smoke, he started talking.
? He certainly had never made this question, he usually trusted in his instincts and that was all, but this was different, this wasn't something he usually did. Why was he doing this? Nothing.
Sherlock took John's erasers and smiled, then he pulled them away and returned his hands to hold John's and suddenly he forgot how to breathe, but for a completely different reason. "No, no John. You need to open the windows before, or you will get us both asphyxiated!" He said smiling widely.
For the rest of the way they didn't talk at all. And Buddy Holly played louder than ever. And John decided he didn't like him at all.
John stopped moving his hands and stood silent, looking at the greaser, and he looked so honest, so real. But no. He ignored what he just heard and told himself that
John took out his pad and started writing on it, so he wouldn't forget anything. He wrote the teacher's name and the general rules of the class, just in case. About ten minutes later, there was a knock on the already closed door. The teacher, who stopped talking and frowned, went to open it. "Sorry sir, I got lost."
John was afraid this might be the end of whatever this was. Sherlock still was silent. The longest he'd been with John without actually talking.
He wondered for a moment how it could have been possible that 120 seconds had passed since he woke up without him realising that he had been hospitalised in John's ER.
It had been a stupid response. He really shouldn’t have reacted in that way, but honestly, was there other way he could have reacted rather than disappointed? He couldn’t come up with any other outcome, he truly was disappointed.
Melissa bit her lip, there wasn't much to do. Yet there was still another card on the table. "You know, Mr. Holmes? When Dr. Watson came in here, asking for our assistance, he didn't do it out of caprice, he hadn't slept in days, he was lonely and suffering nightmares and constantly seeing you dead in them. The only reason why he took that decision was because he was certain you had died, and the only relief he could find was that this procedure was permanent. He'd never see you again because you were dead, and he didn't have to think about you again because you were gone from his memory. It seemed to him like the only possible solution.
"Sugar?" The woman behind the counter asked and John turned back, changing his frown for that silly little smile.
He threw the brush that he was still holding in his hand and walked away, closing the door behind him.
Sherlock cleared his throat and broke the heavy silence that was threatening to crush them both with its weight. "John", he said.
"Nothing to talk about, Holmes." John said, looking down to avoid Sherlock's gaze. Then he turned to pick up two erasers and started hitting them together, and he started coughing like crazy.
Sherlock couldn't come up with an excuse. He was a good liar, but he didn't know what to say, he couldn't say the truth, that he had been trying to break down Moriarty's net, he didn't trust her enough to tell her, and he knew if he opened his mouth he would end up revealing everything,
John produced a glass of water out of somewhere and gave it to Sherlock, he took it all in one gulp.
"Alright, I'll leave you up to it. I'll be coming regularly to check on you two. If you need anything, I'll be sitting at the teacher's lounge, checking the project proposals." He said as he stood up and left.
John was on top of him, his breathing ragged, as he simply stared at Sherlock. At that moment Sherlock felt the pain in his jaw and his lip, where John's fist had hit. "How. Could. You. Do. that?", he said, between pants.
Sherlock looked at him, surprised by the sudden exhibition of emotion, and smiled back. "You'll drive."
"Something tells me John hasn't left yet." She said with a wink and taking Sherlock by his hand and leading him towards the parking lot.
. But he is Sherlock Holmes. He fears nothing. What could be so terrible? He stopped a cab and returned to 221B Baker Street.
"Sure, see you then." Mike said, turning towards the group of friends which was waiting for him outside. John nodded as some kind of greeting towards them, and they smiled at him. Perhaps he wasn't that much of a burden for them, perhaps they enjoyed his company. Well, hopefully.
The class passed by and John, as had been usual lately, ignored Sherlock completely. But that was going to change. The greaser was certain of that. He was about to become the single most important person in John's life. Because he was starting to realize John was in his.
"I need to talk to one of your workers", Lestrade said, passing the folder to Melissa and opening it in front of her, "Alice Pollock. Working place: Lacuna Inc."
He had dressed differently. For once he put the sweaters aside and decided to go for a wool vest with a white shirt underneath, which made him look rather different. He had combed his hair towards one side, which looked better on him and he was wearing a pair of Oxford shoes he found buried in his closet, a present for his 15th birthday by one of his aunts. When he looked at himself in the mirror he realized he looked rather posh, but it looked kind of good. It reminded him of these stylish boys who called themselves Mods.
“This is getting boring, you know?”, John said as Sherlock looked through the window. He had just finished a drawing -a surprisingly good drawing- of a right leg, but it really was getting boring.
‘Understood,’ I replied, trying to gently wipe off the blood smeared all over his lips with my thumb. It was hopeless.
Caught in the thick of the crowd now, Sherlock put his hand up and I tightened mine over his. That was the first and last thing I knew about dancing waltz. I felt like everyone was staring at us now and my slowness certainly wasn’t helping.
‘I am not sure if we can trust him, boss,’ Moran frowned, folding his arms on his chest, ‘If he’s lying even to the closest person he has, how can we be sure he’s not lying to us?’
‘Well, you are. It’s our prime minister,’ I shook my head, sighing. Sherlock arched his eyebrows, ‘You said he looks like the orange American guy and turned off the TV, remember?’
‘I am so sorry…’ I took a deep breath, moving away tangled curls from his forehead. I tried to ignore enormous wound underneath them; even though it was washed, it still gave me chills when I looked at it, ‘I should’ve… I should’ve stayed with you,’
‘Don’t,’ I muttered through clenched teeth and put a finger on the trigger. God, I felt this bolt of electricity coursed through me when he slowly smiled. It was that kind of smile you give to a silly child who is acting out when he is told to go to bed.
All I knew is that I wanted to trust Sherlock again. Fully, without hesitation. And to do so I need to know what was the reason for him to evolve from a high-functioning sociopath to a high-functioning serial killer.
Sherlock grinned knowingly, reaching out his hand, and pulled me closer, grabbing by the waist. He cupped my face in his hands and ran his fingers over my cheeks. I could feel the sticky fluid moving on my skin.
I couldn’t finish. Sherlock leaned closer, covering my hand with his and looking straight into my eyes, making me hold my breath unconsciously.
He looked exactly like he used to, he was even giving me the same slightly haughty glance. The only sign of the change were small scars on his cheekbones and forehead that hadn’t healed just yet.
Hey everyone! Okay, that was very fast :D This chapter isn't that long, but I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
‘Do you always have to talk like you are quoting the Britannica?’ Sherlock sniffed venomously and sat back on the sit, narrowing his eyes, ‘Your megalomania is escalating,’
The fire reminded him of people’s feelings – unpredictable, chaotic and dangerous. It is the greatest weapon human beings ever created. Not even an atomic bomb can give that much damage to one’s life as an irregular heartbeat when he’s looking at somebody he cares about.
I felt like I was about to fall. The only thing that was still holding me up was Sherlock’s hand squeezing my arm. His uneven breath on my lips and his eyes piercing made me forget about everything. Everything he had done. At that exact moment, I was ready to turn blind eye to it and be with him whatever it took.
Greg smiled slightly, putting his hand on my shoulder. I couldn’t even look at him. I didn’t want to see his eyes filled with unfailing condolence. I hated this. Everybody was giving me that look, but I never knew what they expected me to act to it like.
‘I’m glad he’s back on track if you know what I mean…’ Greg whispered to me conspiratorially. I kept looking at Sherlock’s smooth movements. He was picking up one or other piece of the clothes or body part like he was playing some sort of terrifying instrument. I doubted if he ever felt as comfortable with any alive human beings as he did with dead bodies.
Sound of someone’s footsteps interrupted my deliberations. One by one all of the heads looked up at the balcony. The people, who stood there before, parted hastily before the tall man, whose dead eyes looked at the sluggish with reproof.
Now when almost all of the people were engaged in circling around, Magnussen made his way down the stairs and began the conversation with an old gentleman, who stood nearby. Even so, his examining gaze kept scanning those present.
And now Mycroft found himself succumbed to the primal temptations too and became a victim of his own decisions. And there was no one to blame for it. Unless…
Moran knew no names and there was no point in learning them: every two-three weeks they died getting their work done or were killed for not doing it. Simple, but effective motivation.
‘I really am,’ he chuckled, looking down at our intertwined fingers, ‘I wasn’t sure if you had changed your mind or…’
‘John, dear, that’s not what I meant when I said to disarm him,’ he smiled in an ingratiating way, taking several steps closer. His eyes went back to the body, but the expression on his face didn’t change even a bit, and then back to me, ‘You don't think that's overdoing it a little?’
“Want to see some more?” a voice said in my head. I bit my lip, trying to pull myself together. I took a step closer, my hand reaching forward. I could feel Molly staring at my trembling fingers.
It was colder than I had expected and suddenly I realized that my coat was still inside. I folded my arms, trying to ignore my teeth chattering. Freezing to death seemed more appealing than explaining my behaviour to Sherlock’s older brother.
‘Let’s get going before my brother’s annoying boyfriend shows up,’ Sherlock giggled and I pushed him in the shoulders slightly in ostentatious disapproval. He smirked and pulled out another gun from underneath his shirt, ‘Better use something faster than this,’
‘Oh really? Don’t you tell me you did it only cause you cared for me,’ I clenched my fists, almost spitting the words at him, ‘You wanted it. You were bored and ran off with someone, who would fulfil your desires. Someone who would entertain you the way you like,’
‘Holmes,’ Sherlock rattled off. The butler opened his mouth to ask something, but Sherlock got ahead: his hand slid down my waist and pressed me to his thigh. My eyes widened, but I managed to put myself together before the butler looked up again, ‘John Holmes. But I’d appreciate it if this remained between us…’
‘Sh-show me!’ I tried to pull myself together, but seeing Sherlock staggering and almost blackening out wasn’t helping. I touched his hand and it relaxed at once, letting me move it away. I blinked several times to make myself concentrate on what I was looking at, ‘What happened?’
He passed me and Lestrade, whose facial expression was a strange mix of disgust and pity, came right to the line, where the pretty fresh bloodstains started and said without even the slightest tremor in his voice:
I was angry at myself for leaving. Angry at him for pissing me off. Angry at Moriarty for coming back when I was about to…
Sometimes I felt like I didn’t know Sherlock at all. Like he just let me get to know some tiny part of his character so I would piss off. And now when I finally had the chance to find out more, I was terrified. What if I find something, deep down in his soul, which will change everything? And seems like the psychopathic killer part isn’t the worst that can happen for me…
Sherlock smirked at “investigation” and I am sure it took Donovan all of her strength not to snap at him. She marched out of the room, almost pushing me and Greg apart to make her way to the door.
All of a sudden I was out of breath and I prayed he wouldn’t notice. But it’s Sherlock. Of course, he did. But if so, he decided not to show it. His eyes went back to the fire and I looked down, trying to calm myself down. Why was my heart beating so fast?
For the first time in forever, I felt calm and happy. Sherlock was here. Yes, he was badly injured. Yes, he looked tired and broken. But he was here. He was here next to me and it was enough.
I woke up in the middle of the night. I turned my head to see him sleeping peacefully. He looked so innocent. I couldn’t believe that it was this man who almost made me scream on top of my lungs begging for more several hours ago. His face looked almost angelic underneath the light of the moon coming through the window across the room.
‘Starting to,’ he replied and I gave him a look of no amusement. Sherlock looked into my eyes, reaching out and grabbing my hand, ‘Give them hell,’
‘It’s going to be fine, dear. Give him some time. We both know there is no one in this world Sherlock trusts as he trusts you,’
The door flew open and we entered a spacious ballroom. Women in elegant dresses, one more pretentious than other, were chattering with their companions, while servants were offering endless glasses of champagne. Small orchestra in the corner of the room was playing some unobtrusive classical music. It was mad, it was like in a film or on the telly and I was seriously fighting the urge to ask Sherlock to pinch me.
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, but from the expression on his face, I knew he would say something scathing and get us both killed in no time. I squeezed his hand to stop him and swallowed, already regretting about what I was about to say.
I almost jumped back with my hand pressed over my mouth. A wave of complete horror and disgust covered me, my eyes glared at the freaking human hand peeking out of the whole. My hands were shaking and I barely managed to close the bag and kick it back with my feet, pushing it away to the wall.
‘Sherl...’ I couldn’t finish the sentence. My legs went weak and he barely managed to catch me before I hit the floor.
‘It’s too quiet. Even the crime page is almost fully empty,’ I pointed at the small box in the corner, ‘The only distress that happened is a missing dog,’
‘Do you ever just…’ Sherlock cleared his throat and slightly turned his head in my direction so that I could see the corner of his eye, ‘Do you ever feel like nothing is the same anymore?’
I sent everything to hell and grabbed his face with my hands, pulling him as close as possible. Sherlock let out a little amazed moan and I swear to God his knees buckled a little when I used my tongue. Even though he would never admit it.
‘No, that's not it…’ I was getting in a muddle and I knew that it was about to get worse and worse, ‘The last time I danced was my homecoming. And it certainly wasn’t waltzing…’
The silence at once became intolerably oppressive. My eyes went to the massive frames of guards, who appeared in the doorway. I could feel the outline of the gun pressed to my back under the jacket. If a brawl starts, there’s a chance I manage to take it out and...
‘Sherlock, please… I am begging you,’ my own voice sounded alien to me, ‘Stop this. Stop this now because I’m…’ I pressed my lips together, shaking my head, ‘I can’t do this. I just can’t,’
Where it all started. It was going to end. And all I could do was hoping that I wouldn’t lose Sherlock again. This time irreversibly.
Look who's back again :) It's been... three months? I must confess, I didn't feel like writing for a long time, but several days ago I just opened this fic and read it from the start again. And fortunately or unfortunately (decide for yourself hehe)  I decided to continue. So here is a pretty big chapter, which I really enjoyed writing so I hope you'll like it too.
I tried imagining just the two of us having a date. We would go to one of the countless tiny restaurants, the owners of which owed Sherlock after some shady cases, or get order-in. I’d make him watch the whole Harry Potter series or CSI just to watch him criticizing every single bit of it. Then we’d probably end up laying on the couch and debating about something till we fall asleep. And in the morning, we would wake up with terrible neck pain, Sherlock would drone about it the whole day long and several days later ask me if I was free that evening again.
Sally snorted with laughter and folded her arms on the chest, looking questioningly at Greg, who sighed wearily like a single father of two always fighting kids.
I pressed my lips together, pulling myself together. I looked up at the ancient arch absorbing the night sky above me while pushing the door open and going in.
‘You are welcome to do so. Your main goal is to find any proof that his unplanned vacation to England is connected with the recent activity of our well-known fellow or his people,’
‘Believe me, John… You are going to regret it very soon,’ Sherlock said so seriously that I pressed my lips together, getting how stupid it must have sounded for him.
I opened the door violently, ready to punch whoever was there in the windpipe with the knife. I was ready for a junkie, a serial killer, literally anyone. But not that.
‘I think that soon you’ll have to go around with a lifeguard for your own safety, Sherlock,’ Greg said, smiling at me, pleased with himself. Sherlock shrugged his shoulders.
‘I don’t know you anymore,’ every word pierced into my heart. I was looking in these eyes, the colour of which was like the colour of the sea before the storm. So dark the pupils were not even visible. And for the first time in my life, I felt the same horror others usually feel when facing them.
I sighed happily and giving way to a spontaneous impulse, leaned down, leaving a light kiss on Sherlock’s wet forehead.
I hated the fact that Sally freaking Donovan was right. She was right all along. And I was just a fool, who was too blinded by his own loneliness and the promise of a thrilling adventure.
I took the final step and pushed the dark metal door open. The wind immediately hit me in the face and I hurried to close the door behind me.
I looked at the knife that was still standing, blade stuck in the forehead of the guard. I squatted down and pulled it out with force, putting it under my belt. I stood up and took the gun from Sherlock’s hand. He lifted one of his eyebrows.
Oddly enough, just the name of this guy made Sherlock freeze. He stared at Greg for several seconds, not even blinking, and then all of the sudden stormed out of the room.
Greg nodded and Sherlock quickly went out of the room. I froze, truly bewildered. My eyes fixed on the woman’s body. Seems like both of us were left speechless.
I could barely breathe. My hand touched his stone-cold cheek and I smiled ruefully: my body still quivered to his every touch. And I refused to believe it was the last time.
I dropped the knife and fell down on my knees, my face against his waist. My hands were shaking as I touched his hand that was covering the wound.
I shook my head, walking further. Finally, I reached the doors that led to the roof stairs. I grabbed the doorknob and pulled it to myself, when I heard the voice behind my back.
Since it's so complex it took me quite a long time to finish it, I'm sorry for the waiting (shorter than waiting for another season of Sherlock tho lmao).
I sat up in my chair, blinking several times to wake myself up. I looked at him and he immediately looked away in the window again.
‘Predictable,’ he said, reaching out for the folder with one hand, while the other slipped to the top drawer and took out another photo. Jim put it together with the first one and stared at them for a moment, not blinking. He looked up at Sebastian and slowly smiled, ‘Sherlock said it would work,’
‘John,’ Sherlock said and I stopped, gazing back with my best pleading eyes. His hand got closer, ‘Just follow my lead,’
‘Because I’ve seen his eyes,’ Jim replied, turning to the window in his chair, and it took Sebastian all of his self-control not to roll his eyes, ‘He’s just like us,’
The music stopped abruptly and I felt my heart go right through my feet. A whisper has flied through the hall and the guests started exchanging quite suspicious looks.
‘If I told you, you would try to stop me,’ Sherlock said sullenly, he glared, ‘I could not let you get into this,’
I opened my eyes. I didn’t even notice that I fell asleep. My eyes darted to Sherlock, but he was still asleep, his breathing slowed down to normal.
Suddenly, I felt cold fingers touching my palm and then clasped it, lightly squeezing. I closed my eyes, feeling a strange mix of relief and tension at the same time.
I smiled fondly, shaking my head. Sherlock sighed, taking his seat beside me and taking a bite of his toast.
Maybe if I told him what I felt, we wouldn’t end up here. In complete anarchy, the cause of which was him.
The dark-wooden table was fully covered by numerous opened folders. Most of them contained photos and all information about a significant person or organization. It’s funny how just one thin folder could destroy a life, if it got to wrong hands.
I turned my head to look at Greg, who was now fixing the wiretap on the inner side of Sherlock’s jacket. Its owner, by the way, was as taciturn and focused as always. His eyes were closed, but eyeballs rapidly moved under the eyelids which likely indicated that he was calculating all possible outcomes of tonight. How thoughtful of him.
My hand was shaking. And even though I added my second hand and held the gun with both of them, the gun barrel was still irregularly moving from his chest to his neck. His eyes looked stone-cold as his gaze was slowly hypnotizing me.
‘If I were you, I wouldn’t do that,’ I froze, breathing heavily. Moran’s face broke into a disturbing smile, ‘You are not the only one with unpredictable reflexes here, Dr Watson,’
Sherlock stared at him in disbelief. Then he looked at them silently, John could see his face was filling with anger, that was not something good. "LET ME GO!"
When John and Sherlock realized, it was already 4:00 p.m, which meant Mr Hikes wouldn't take long to come and release them from detention. Not that they were bored, actually, John thought he couldn't call a time when he had that much fun as that moment. They were shaking the erasers, but they stopped frequently to throw them to the other one and clean themselves as they laughed, they also got to talk a lot, and John forgot completely of how mad he had been with Sherlock few hours ago.
John looked at the phone lying in the table right next to the plate of half-eaten breakfast. He stood silent. Sherlock was saying something about the client, and he didn't seem to notice about the message, he didn't want John to know wether he cared about her texting or not.
John didn’t say. Instead all he said was “goodbye” and he closed the door behind him before hearing Sherlock’s reply.
John shrugged, he was looking at Greg seriously, putting his defenses up, trying to prepare himself for any attack by the greasers. "Why would I know?" He asked curiously.
“I think we both know the answer to that, Dr. Watson. I told you since the moment we met. This is definite. If you’re having any doubts about it then I suggest you to…”
John decided it was best not to reply to that. Instead he chose to ask him about the other thing. "...and he mentioned Irene."
"Two things: one, stop looking so freaking miserable. Two, I'll take you home." She said with a small smile.
John smiled, but suddenly he widened his eyes and looked at Sherlock with a frown, as if he had just realized of something. "Wait. Sherlock, when did you say it happened?"
The greaser sighed. Greg was going to keep insisting anyway, so he might as well just say it. “I think we both know that was never going to work.”
What the hell was she doing there? How did she dare? He was surprised, angry and thoughtful. She stood on the door, she was alone, probably a car waiting for her outside. She was in a black dress, with the red lipstick and the characterization of the dominatrix. Yes, she was coming for Sherlock. Hair perfectly and carefully done. Checking her phone, she barely looked at John.
When their laughter died off, Sherlock realized that John hadn’t let go of his hand, they were softly touching. Just the gentlest of touch.
John stared at the drawing in amusement. The torso was finished, and it was fantastic. Sherlock had done it in less than ten minutes and yet the accuracy of it was absolutely remarkable. Sherlock knew exactly which were the right traces, knew where to place the shadows, which places to keep bright and which to keep dark. It was as if Sherlock had memorized every single inch of the body, and as if he had carefully studied it and analyzed it in his own mind.
Sherlock frowned and turned to look at Mycroft, who was smirking. "Congratulations, Sherlock. You found a
Sherlock stormed into his room and shut the door, he definitely needed some time alone to think. How couldn't have he noticed the fact that her phone was no longer in his room? Had he really forgotten about her? Just like that? Well, that message proved that he still felt something towards her, he didn't know whether it was pain, or anger, or... Of course not, not that.
He looked at himself in the mirror, his curls were a mess, and he tried as best as he could to look slightly better, and since when did he care about those things? He frowned at himself, what was wrong with him? He told himself it obviously was because of the many cameras that would be there, because the case had certainly attracted the press. Of course, that was the reason. What else could it be?
But he didn't want to fight with him. He didn't want to be mad at him. He just wanted to be with him. He enjoyed every single moment he spent by his side. Well, most of them. So as soon as he left the store he stood in the sidewalk, took a deep breath, calmed himself and entered to the car, waiting for Sherlock to get out, because he had the hope the greaser realized it was pointless arguing and go and apologize to John. He certainly wasn't going to, because he had all the right to complain. Didn't he?
"For God's sake Sherlock! I warned you, I told you to lose contact with her, hasn't it ever occurred to you that it was for your own sake?"
Lestrade sighed. "Fine. I'll give you the details later. You should get some rest, you don't look well."
Sherlock could feel him, behind each caress, behind each touch, behind each smile, behind each battered grimace, behind the carefully constructed masks, John was always there, living within the John he'd come back to.
“How long have you painted for?”, John asked Sherlock when the silence became too much of a weight between them.
"-Mcleish", Lestrade thought about how to bring up the subject without mentioning the serial murders, "...a few enquiries have been directed at Lacuna, not only this clinic is functioning under the law, but it seems like some of the client's privacy has been compromised."
Since their fight, Sherlock had told himself that eventually he would go back to normality, overcome his phase of stupidity and forget John completely, but it was quite the contrary: he was regretting more and more everyday the damn choices he had made, every time he saw John he felt the need to hug him, to hold his hand, to kiss him and make things better, but he couldn't and he wouldn't. He knew he maybe had overreacted that day, and John was right, it had been a stupid argument, it was stupid leaving things just like that. He wanted to do things right, but he had no idea how.
During the whole dinner, Mr Watson kept flicking his eyes between Harry and Sherlock and looking seriously at them. Sherlock assumed he was thinking Harry was flirting with him! Which was actually a good thing, because that way he wouldn't suspect at all about John. If he found out... Things would definitely go to hell.
John was seeing colors in front of him. Was hearing them. Was almost able to touch them. They were soft and vibrant and they were so present and they were
Wrong about the facts and wrong about the murderer and wrong about himself and wrong about John. Wrong wrong wrong.
It had been one month and John and him had just come back from their first case together since Lacuna. It really wasn't more than a five, six at most, but Sherlock was aching for it. He needed the rush of adrenaline running through his body and he needed John next to him. In the end they had ended up chasing a couple of burglars through streets and alleys, ducked the shot of a bullet and came back home safe and sound.
Mycroft stood up with a sigh and walked towards the morphine drip. "I opposed to it, considering your history, but apparently there's no other option."
He shook his head. "No. I... All of Sherlock's stuff are in the old flat and I can't stand to go in there right now. Too many memories."
He didn't see Sherlock die, John did. And Greg knew the sequels the detective's (fake) suicide had caused on the doctor.
He tapped the door on apartment 21. There was silence on the other end. Sherlock felt his heart in his throat. What if John was gone for good? He'd spent those two days thinking about what he'd say to John once they met again, he didn't stop for a moment to consider if John would be there to talk to him ever again.
And in that moment John realized how much this had changed with the greaser, two weeks ago, he would have never dared to say something like this, but now, somehow, he
Just one would cause the desired effect. Of course it would.The night of the party he was too drunk and that fogged his brain enough, but aside from that, he hadn't taken them in a long time, so whichever resistance his body had developed towards them was no longer there. Absolutely logical assumption.
“The lines are wrong! The traces, the shadows, the proportions! It’s not okay! Look at your own arm, John, look at it, and tell me how it resembles
John seemed at a loss of what to say, he did look like he had absolutely no idea who was standing in front of him, but how? how was that even possible? He forced himself to stay calm, sighed, closed his eyes and said once again, seeming to gain his composure. "John... It's me. Sherlock. I'm alive. I know it must be surprising to you, but I'm not dead and I'm here once again." He thought it was utterly stupid having to explain himself but if it helped John to stop being such an idiot he was going to do it.
Sherlock opened his eyes. He didn’t know at which point they had drawn closed, and his breathing was ragged, and he felt decidedly uncomfortable.
"Smoking in school. What a transgression Holmes, what a transgression." He said shaking his head disappointed.
Sherlock woke up when he heard his phone beeping. He rummaged in his trousers, trying to get the phone out as fast as he could.
"Mom, will you let me explain or not? Third of all, I wasn't doing anything bad, don't worry." Well, that wasn't technically a lie. He just escaped with a guy and then argued with him and was never talking to him ever again. The thought of it scared John even more.
Sherlock shook his head, making sure that John could feel the movement of his jaw on top of his head. "It wasn't your fault, John. I'd never blame you for this, ever."
After talking for a long time, Sherlock stood up and smiled towards John's mom. "I'm having a wonderful time, but we have a murder to solve, Mrs. Watson!"
John looked at him and leaned his head against the couch, “and that was it? I went to look for a flat with you and we moved in together? Just like that?”
Sherlock let it all out until he felt empty, devoid of pain. Well, that was a lie, but there was a slight relief in his heart, in his mind, in his soul.
At some point, he had covered his ears with his hands. John’s hands moved from Sherlock’s hair to grab at his fingers, slowly, slowly.
I’m better than all of these”, he said with disdain, as if it was an offense in itself to be place in the same category with these artists.
No. This would do him no good. He should focus instead on painting and on finishing that goddamned palm of the hand he had started four days ago and to which he couldn’t still find the correct shape, nor the correct position of the shadow.
John's logical side within his brain told him that it was an obvious outcome: there was blood loss and the shock was giving way to pain a pain so deep that in Sherlock's case it could only shut itself off in order to prevent it, but his irrational side was screaming at him.
Surprisingly enough, the encounter went...well. After a cup of coffee and a long time of talk, John's mother seemed to have changed completely her opinion about the greaser and seemed to accept him as a friend of his son. Sherlock was so... charming, and John thought he would be an excellent actor. The greaser talked about his life, about his parents, even about his brother! And John ended up thinking that now his mom knew Sherlock better than he knew Sherlock. Which made him a little jealous. Which was stupid and he shook the thought away.
"Alright, we have lots of things to learn today." Sherlock said nonchalantly, as John sat right next to him. Mr Hikes was sitting on the desk and didn't seem to be bothered by the noise, which allowed John and Sherlock to talk as much as they wanted to, which was great.
The last time he had cried had been just before he jumped, listening to John's voice, saying goodbye.
Sherlock leaned closer. "Well, my answer will have to be why do you think so little of yourself, John?" John didn't say a word.
“As observant as always”, Sherlock said mockingly. “Now, if you excuse me I’ll go back to my drawing.”
He couldn’t define it, couldn’t find a way to explain it. He simply felt his hand itching to grab a hold of the charcoal, he missed the smell of the oil paintings, he looked at the white paper in front of him and he felt the need to fill it with life, to turn the empty canvas into a masterpiece.
"Of course! I don't want those idiots-" she said pointing towards the greaser's table. "-to ruin our night!"
"They are good! I swear!" He said grabbing a chair and sitting in a table close to the little stage on the end of the store.
His lower lip trembled when he started, “Be-before you erased me from your memory I had been gone for a year and a half.”
the one who had killed all those people, but if they didn’t have the knife they didn’t have any real proof against him, except for the fact he had access to the patient’s records, but that was hardly incriminating.
An ordinary person would have heard what Sherlock had said the night before and would have walked away. An ordinary person would have called him a ‘freak’, would have looked at him with disdain, would have laughed at his outburst of sentiment. An ordinary person would have left thirteen hours ago and would have walked out of Sherlock’s life forever.
