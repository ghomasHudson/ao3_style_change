“What about, uh, people with Alzheimer’s? You think they got it worse?”
Billie rolls her eyes. She ignores Lucifer as she crosses the room and holds the orb out to Dean, and before he can consent to whatever she’s about to do, she shoves the orb directly into his chest and he screams.
Dean grins and looks at the computer screen and back to the doctor. “As long as you promise to bring that lab coat.”
“One, twenty-four, seventy-nine.”
Jerome had barely had anything to drink, so he drove them to Dean’s house.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean says back, less loudly so as not to wake the baby. “Powerful as God, and he’s here talking to our fucking plants.”
“We talk to Cas first,” Dean asserts. “At least give him the option to expel Lucifer.”
“You broke your foot, so excuse me for being concerned and wanting to check on you.” Crowley held up a reusable grocery bag. “I cooked for you, but fuck you. You can’t have it.”
Clint grabs her hand and kisses her fingers. He then turns toward Dean and Cas and says, “What about y’all? How long you been together?”
He actually loved it. It was perfect. He said, “I look like a fucking straight guy.”
Dean mixes the not-orzo salad and lets the silence sit between them for a second.
“Hey, Mom,” he whispers, since Cas is still asleep next to him.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’ waist and pulled him close so he could kiss him properly. “I’ll wake you up next time.”
He clicks to another screen. “Are you still a light tobacco smoker?”
“For starters, he told me everything I wanted to hear.”
“No offense, Sammy, but I don’t accept fashion advice from heterosexuals.”
“We’ll worry about getting Cas’ body back once we’ve solved the Amara problem,” Dean says. Then he looks around at each person individually: Sam, Cas, Charlie, Eileen, Crowley, Jesse, Cesar, Clint, Ida May. Crowley didn’t say where Rowena is, and Dean doesn’t care enough to ask. Instead, he gives the briefest explanation he can manage of everything that’s happened since the Mark of Cain was burned off his arm. He finishes by saying, “If we don’t kill Amara, she’s going to destroy the world. And we can’t just send anybody in to get the job done. It has to be me.”
“What? Why didn’t I know that?” Dean asked, offended.
“I can’t believe you guys raised the antichrist and didn’t call me,” Claire says as she looks down at her phone and twirls a strand of hair around her finger. “Or at least Jody. Jody would’ve been all over that.”
During a lull in the conversation, Mary says, “It’s going to take me a long time to adjust.”
“No, I’m sorry,” she mumbles. “You guys were gone so long, and I—well, the guest room is kind of wrecked.”
“Dean,” Cas’ new voice says from the other side of the room. “Was that—is Chuck—he’s God?”
“Let’s end this,” Lucifer says.
“OK, sweet little abomination, we’re just gonna wait ‘til you’re grown up before we decide what to do, hm?” Dean says in a soothing voice. He leaves the onesie unbuttoned at the bottom and puts a pair of pants on her, then he reflexively kisses her forehead as he picks her up.
“Oh. Well, thanks.”
Dean only manages to shout his name twice before a Black woman suddenly appears in the room, arms crossed over her chest and seemingly unaffected by the shaking earth.
He doesn’t care until he feels something other than himself, something that is a part of him, and it’s being subsumed into the earth, too, but it’s wrong. It’s wrong, and he has to stop it. He can feel it like a limb being cut off from his body. He comes back to himself and crawls his way out of the earth, and as soon as he can feel air on his skin, Cas’ hand reaches down and pulls him up to his feet.
“Yeah,” Donna agreed, her teeth gritted as she held the patient’s hips while they stood between the parallel bars. “Way I see it, you’re torturing yourself for no reason.”
“Hey, wait!” Tell him. Tell him.
“How ‘bout we go out tonight? Somewhere nice. And I’ll fake propose so we can get a free dessert.”
“I know, Mom. You take all the time you need, we’ll be here.” Dean is glad he’s driving. It’s easier to have this conversation while looking ahead at the road.
The shapeshifter was first. Then the slew of ghosts, a couple of demons, what turned out to be a friendly witch, pack of werewolves. Eventually, it just became commonplace that Dean and Cas share a room.
He remembered that he was recording and got back into character, closing his eyes and pushing against his hand. It had only been a few minutes, but he was already close to coming.
“Three beers a night average.”
“Yeah, you’ve been tailing me for a reason, and it ain’t because you like me,” Dean replies. “So, what is it? How do we stop her?”
“That’s good, though, right? Still excited?”
After an awkward moment of silence, Rowena leads them around the back of the house where Crowley is leaning against a shed smoking a cigarette.
“I’m not burning the world.” She moves her hands up, then flattens them down like she’s pushing something.
Dean:
“Alright. Uh, let’s go figure out what we can learn about those deaths,” Dean replies.
Startled by the voice, Dean quickly jumped away from Cas and turned to see Cassie standing just a few feet away with an empty basket on her arm.
Inside, Eileen asked Castiel a slew of questions about himself and he did his best to maintain eye contact with her despite the fact that she was moving around the kitchen as she cooked. When Sam and Dean talked to her, they used sign language so casually and effortlessly, and it made Castiel feel warm inside to watch Dean use another language. He made a mental note to ask him later if he could speak any others.
He yells her name again, but she doesn’t come back.
Dean nudged him. “C’mon, Cas, I’ve been awake almost two hours. Hang out with me.”
Of course, he couldn’t get hard again right away, so he went to YouTube to find amateur solo porn to see how other people did it.
Other Dean dropped into a chair at the kitchen table. “Ah, fuck. How’d we end up crippled?”
in the life, because that would just be impossible to maintain. But being with someone
“What?”
It was around 11 p.m., and they were snuggled up together in bed, Dean lying on his back and Cassie tucked into his side with a hand resting on his pec, when Dean had the ridiculous thought that if he wasn’t spending the night then maybe he could hang out with Castiel.
Winchester Weld – in store? We mostly do auto repairs, especially on city buses. For home repairs, we do just about anything if it’s steel. You sure? OK, yes, ma’am. Have a nice day.
“Dean? You OK?” Sam asks.
Billie shrugs. “I didn’t have a lot going on. What’s up, Dean?”
“Yeah, tell me something I don’t know, Sam,” Dean responds, annoyed. He leans back against the counter, crossing his legs as he drinks his coffee.
“Well, sweetheart, what do you—”
He unplugs the headphones; music flows out of his shitty phone speaker. Charlie taps her fingers against his side.
"Uh, yeah."
It’s still early in the morning though, and Amara tends to wake later as she gets older. Charlie joins Sam, Clint and Ida May out in the kitchen while Dean insists that he needs to shower and shave. When he walks into the communal bathroom, however, he finds Cas standing at the sink with only a towel wrapped around his waist and a straight razor in his hand.
Cas turned toward Dean and frowned. “Dean, that’s too much cleaning.”
Dean rolled his eyes. This was going a lot easier than he had ever imagined. “How long have you been waiting for this?”
Dean lifts his eyes shyly. Cas is studying him.
Sam responds with a mix of shock and horror, but he tries not to let it show as Amara runs up to him for a hug.
Dean purposely suggested a boring movie, hoping they would get tired of it and have sex instead, but what actually happened was that they fell asleep on the couch together.
“Cas? You OK?”
The day after Charlie moves out of the bunker, Dean texts Mildred.
She smiles brightly, revealing dimples in her cheeks and perfectly straight teeth. “I’m Button.”
Cas takes a step toward Dean and maintains eye contact. “I was in heaven. I was working with the angels.”
She blinks twice. “Dean really has only known you in a male vessel? Not like this?”
Sam walks away, muttering, “Yeah, it never is,” over his shoulder.
“Uh, it was Crowley. Did he—well, he’s gone now.” Dean stops himself from saying what he knows, which is that Crowley landed himself inside the room only to talk to Dean, and had the door locked and the room soundproof for privacy. Sam would get all kinds of ideas from that information, so Dean keeps it to himself.
“On fire?” Dean asks calmly.
When Cas starts hunting with Sam and Dean, he realizes that he’s never actually paid attention to
“So? You can get another job, you can’t get another me.”
Dean stalks up to him—her?—and gets in her personal space, glaring down at her. “How the hell did you end up in there, Cas?”
“Why do you do that?” Cas asks without preamble.
Max smiles and winks at him.
Second, the reason why he didn’t have sex with anybody ever is because he felt guilty about it.
Dean harrumphed, unsure about Cas’ judgment but unwilling to fight him about it. So he said, “Alright, so what are
“Do you remember teaching me how to read?”
“Oh, what, you’re at my beck and call now? Seriously?” Dean asks childishly.
“About six hours.”
Nobody in their right mind would lie to their brother about some special farmer’s market two hours away just so they can sneak away and meet some shady guy with a mohawk on the side of I-40 who just happens to be selling miniature Yorkshire terrier puppies out of a fucking minivan.
“We’re doing Bobby’s birthday party today at lunch,” Charlie said. “We’re gonna surprise him in the dining hall, he’s gonna hate it.”
Sam looks at Cas, and there’s pity etched into his features under the dim outdoor light of the motel. “Yeah. Like a guardian angel.”
Dean kissed him. “No reason. So, uh, pancakes?”
Alicia smacks him. Dean, wide-eyed, looks at Sam, who is laughing his ass off.
Dean smiles, his eyes still closed. “I like that.”
“Is it Cassie? Your Friday?” She flipped through one of the books. “No, she wouldn’t be giving you books. Why would anyone be giving you books? You’re too pretty to read.”
“Sam.” Dean looks at his brother, clenches his jaw. “This isn’t up for debate.”
Crowley comes crashing through the kitchen, forcing Dean and Cas to stand up from the table to get out of his way.
Then he tells her about Lisa, about the guilt that he carries for what he did to her, and when he drops his head into his hand and starts to cry he expects Charlie’s small arms to encompass him and make everything better.
“Look, Dean, I’m not gonna pretend to understand you and Cas’ relationship, other than to say I know it’s, uh, difficult sometimes, but I just don’t get it when you can be so good, good enough to raise a
His eyes flicker up in response, surprised that someone else is in his safe little domain. It’s the shape of his own vessel looking back at him, the expression on his own face alerting him that it’s Lucifer talking to him.
“That’s impossible,” Crowley says. He then steps into the void himself and disappears.
has to say. You listen to people and take time to really understand them, even though you’re impatient as hell. You don’t let me bullshit you, and you make me want to be more like myself, and I don’t even know what that means. You’re weird and kind, and you make me feel safe.”
“Tuesday visited me at work and let me know you’d be breaking up with me this evening, so. Break up with me.”
Dean looks over his shoulder, making sure Sam’s not anywhere nearby as he types out a response.
Hollow. That was how Dean felt. He had to fix it, to fill himself up.
“We don’t have to include Crowley in anything.”
“Telenovelas,” Dean says with a sigh.
“Then I’ll buy you three minutes.”
“Why are you smiling?” Amara asks him, clearly frustrated.
After a couple hours, Cas excused himself to go to the bathroom and Dean checked his phone. He had a text from Pati.
It’s quiet in Amara’s room, so Dean knocks lightly and waits until she tells him he can come in. He opens the door tentatively, taking in the sight of all of her things strewn about the room—evidence of her quick development in the mixture of baby toys, clothes and chapter books. Amara is perched on her bed, legs crossed, her body shaking a little bit as she wrings out the last of her tears. She looks up at Dean hopelessly.
Crowley tries to interject, but Cas cuts him off with, “Can you join us here? I know it’s a long drive, but—”
She finally looks at him. Her face relaxes into a smile. “It’s OK. Let it take us. It might feel good.”
Cas’ gentle laugh filled the cab, warming Dean’s heart. “Who are you trying to impress, Dean? I’m listening to Chance the Rapper. You have nothing to worry about here.”
“No! I just...sometimes I want something different…”
Dean snaps out of it. “Yeah, you said that.”
Billie makes an impressed face and then puts her hand on Cas’ shoulder and mumbles, “He actually said it. I must be special,” before she and Cas disappear.
“Hm. I might,” Jody considers. “Alex is really attached to her though. I am, too, but. I don’t know. It’s different for me.”
“Thank you, Sam.” Cas’ demeanor changes before he says, “I have to go. I have a lot to plan.”
“Alright, dude, but you’re paying for this shirt if my tits leak through it.”
Sam clears his throat from the doorway. “Hey, Cas. Hey, Claire,” he says. “Mom, this is Claire. Claire, Mary Winchester. And, uh, that’s Cas’ real body.”
“Um. Yeah.” Dean feels heat rise to his cheeks, shame taking over his entire body. “Sorry, buddy, I can’t really, uh, talk right now. I’ll call you later, alright?”
“Yeah, I guess. Like I said, it was nice.” He almost brings up what he overheard earlier, and maybe a better version of him would be fine teasing Charlie for talking to Cas about how mean he can be, but he’s not a better version of himself, he doesn't really know how to talk about his relationship with Cas, and so he doesn’t say anything else.
Clint and Ida May both laugh. “No,” Ida May says. “I married a fool when I was 20, had my daughter, got divorced and didn’t find Clint again until he had found himself. I almost didn’t recognize him when I saw him, I was just so focused on how cute he was.”
Castiel:
Cas didn’t answer right away as he was too busy laying kisses to Dean’s warm skin. Eventually, he said, “I wanted to make love to you before Sam comes to get us up.”
“He told me about them. He asked me to help him the same way I was trying to help you, by looking inside his mind through touch.”
until Dean can’t feel his fingers or toes anymore, and then they kiss some more.
And so Sam (homophobically, in Dean’s opinion) started calling Dean “whore” instead of “jerk.”
Cas tilts his head to the side, furrows his brow. “What do you mean?”
Sam called with updates, asked Dean how he was doing, said he would be home in a few days and that Eileen said hi.
Dean takes a step forward, too, and bears down on Crowley. “Watch it. You know all it would take is me telling just one demon exactly what happened between us when I was—”
About five minutes out, the road is suddenly clogged with cars driving in the opposite direction as Dean. There are police cruisers and ambulances speeding by, but it’s hard to see what’s going on through the mist. When Dean pulls up to the nursing home, he can see fog billowing out of open windows as if the place is on fire, but there’s no fire. The black fog looks stark against the white mist, both indicative of impending doom.
the fucking house, Sam, so I don’t exactly want to burn it to the—”
“Did you say ‘he’?”
“No, it’s, uh,”
Nearly an hour passes before Amara says, “Stop here.”
Castiel scoffed. “Four.”
“Did you just call me ‘kid’? I’m 35.”
It all happens so fast. First Cas, then Mom, Charlie. Clint and Ida May will be out in the next month. Sam hasn’t said when Eileen might be back.
“I’m Jerome,” he said.
Later, snuggled up in bed, Dean asked Cas what he had been talking to Jesse and Cesar about during dinner.
Dean huffs a laugh. “It’s just a friend.”
Luckily Sam came in a second later and confirmed that they were locked in, and that he had put several people inside a salt ring in the kitchen.
“You eavesdropped?”
Dean smiles at him. “Good.”
She rolled her eyes and moved to undo the ties. “Goddamn, you’re boring these days. You’re acting like the married men I fuck. Did you get a wife recently?”
Castiel shut the door behind them, making Crowley stand outside on the front porch to avoid waking Dean up. “I’m taking care of Dean. What are you doing here?” he asked in a monotone.
“What? What do you think he’s up to?”
Dean:
to run?”
“No, nothing,” Dean replies. “Look, I’m still pretty beat from, uh.” Dean pats the inside of his right forearm. “I’m sorry we’re just kind of stuck here, but we can’t exactly go anywhere with a baby in the backseat, and we need to be here whenever Cas shows up anyway. So I’m gonna get some shut-eye. Wake me up if the kid needs anything.”
Sam turns and smiles goofily at Dean. “I didn’t hear Cas come in last night.”
It was true that Cas struggled on camera, because the only way he knew how to fuck Dean was with love infused into every touch and every thrust, and neither of them wanted to share that with a few thousand people.
“You’re grounded,” Dean says. “You’re not allowed to come out of this room until you’re ready to apologize.”
“What?” Dean asks.
Dean and Eileen walked to a sandwich shop in the same shopping center as the nail salon and chatted about her classes and the papers she was working on while Dean obsessively checked his phone between bites of the two paninis, soup and chips he’d ordered.
a teenager.”
“Dean, you do realize–”
And Dean was jealous. He held tension so fearfully that he woke each morning with pain in his clenched jaw. Don’t look at Cas, don’t be alone with Cas, don’t get too close to Cas, don’t talk to Cas, Cas, Cas.
Ida May starts, “Well, we ain’t really hunters, first of all. Both of us grew up in a rural town in South Carolina, and, uh, we was about 15 when it happened. You know, some parts of the South, Jim Crow never really left, so we either learned to cope or we went North. My family had an old farm, so we couldn’t leave it even if we wanted to. Clint here worked for my parents—after school, he’d come get our goat milk or chicken eggs and sell ‘em for us.” Ida May looks at Clint. He takes over the story.
Three days pass.
Dean took a bite of food and waited.
Castiel brands angel-warding sigils on Dean and Sam’s ribs. He starts using a cellphone to find them.
“I don’t think this is—”
After wrapping Castiel’s legs, Dean takes two steps up toward his head and brushes his thumb across his cheek. Sam should leave, he knows he should, but everything feels like it’s happening in fast forward and he can’t move.
“You’ve drastically changed your diet.”
He remembered this time to text his Sunday, telling them that he might be later than usual. They texted back right away, assuring him that he could show up at their house whenever he pleased.
Sam couldn’t take it anymore and blurted out, “OK, seriously,
Cas looks at Dean’s swollen face with such a sadness in his eyes that Dean has to look away from him.
“Alright, Amara, quit messing around,” Dean says.
When she meets Charlie, they sit at the kitchen table and talk with some stilted ASL on Charlie’s end, both of them laughing as Eileen tries to teach her some things. It’s too normal, too quaint, for Dean to deal with, so he goes to the library and stands next to Cas at the bookshelf and asks him how research is going.
Cas scratches the back of his neck as he stares down at the table. “I was ashamed.”
“It would be weird,” Dean admits. “When I think about her, I still see a 3-year-old.”
Cas doesn’t say anything else, and Dean is glad for that, too. He wasn’t afraid of Cas—even when he was hitting him so hard he couldn’t see—because he’s just not capable of being afraid of Cas. It didn’t even cross his mind that Cas could’ve killed him.
“Sweetheart, you don’t have a goddamn clue what I want.”
“Dean,” Cas says seriously, looking up as soon as Dean enters the room. “I was going to tell you—I think I found a lead.”
They both needed sleep, but it seemed ridiculous to nap in separate beds in the same room in broad daylight. Dean had never shared his bed with a man just for the hell of it, just to sleep, but it was something he desperately wanted from Cas. Something he could never have.
The more he looked at himself on screen, the more he noticed his flaws and wanted to do something about them. It had been so long since he had hungered for anything, since he cared about himself in any visceral way. He started eating more: high-calorie, high-protein foods to get his weight up fast. He was hungry, starving, in a way he hadn’t felt in years. He stopped drinking and switched to water, guzzling it nonstop all day to make his skin look healthier.
Cas huffed a laugh and placed both shirts in their cart. “You can’t wear flannel in the summer, Dean.”
“Hey,” Sam says.
“What do you need an apple pie for?” Claire asked as they got started in Castiel’s kitchen.
Crowley meets them immediately, acting cold toward them both as he leads them through empty and unreasonably narrow passageways, purposely keeping them from seeing anyone or anything going on in hell. Sam explains the situation to him as they walk, with Crowley barely acknowledging that he’s listening until they reach a room that seems like the cold entrance to a prison, and he stops and turns toward them. He avoids looking at Dean.
“Are you offering us tea in our own house?” Dean asks.
Sam’s eyes flutter closed, then his head drops forward as his neck relaxes.
He smiled and swiped the pad of his thumb across Dean’s cheek. “You’ve changed me, Dean. I love you.”
Lucifer tells them that he doesn’t care what happens and only wants to cause chaos in his Father’s world. He gets away, leaving Vince Vincente’s dead body behind.
“Hey! That’s not true! We were
Renee gasped and laughed like a kid with a crush. She was one of his
“Mm, that’s better.” Dean snuggles down and bends his arm up to feel Cas’ bicep.
Something snaps in Dean. Memories flood back to him, memories he keeps deep in the recesses of his brain in hopes of never having them surface. The way Amara’s face distorts in his visions is the way he used to torture souls in hell. She is the face of every victim he had on the rack.
Dean cleans Amara’s face and picks her up; she eagerly wraps her little arms around his neck and buries her face against his collarbone. He squeezes her and rubs the side of his face against her head.
a big deal, that whatever is happening to his body is definitely a big deal, but he’s going to control what he can control. He reasons that if he doesn’t drink, he doesn’t have splitting-headache visions of Amara. If he doesn’t eat much, he doesn’t puke. Simple.
“I know that.”
“Oh fuck, I was wrong,” Dean says with a small laugh. “There’s no cassette player in here. C’mon.” He doesn’t wait before getting right back out and heading over to where the Impala is parked on the other end of the garage.
Jesse opened the door to let Dean in and stopped short for a second as he surveyed him.
“Surprise, I’m God,” Chuck says with a shrug.
“Mm?” Dean turns, eyebrows raised like he’s been caught. “What?”
“Ordering dinner.” Mary looks up from the takeout menu with bright eyes. “You can do that over the phone, can’t you?”
“I, um. Didn’t know you’d all be here,” Cas said. “I only brought enough food for Dean.”
Cas turned to his back and dropped his head against the outside of Dean’s arm. “What do you want to do today?”
Dean smirks at him and squeezes his shoulder. “That’s when you started sleeping in my bed, too. I think I went above and beyond as a host.”
Cas gently shook him awake in the dark and whispered for him to go to bed, and Dean listened. He sleepily pointed Cas to the guest room as they walked down the hall together, then he went straight to his own bed.
“Hm. Well, I’m paying attention now. Very close attention.” He surreptitiously licks his lips.
No, he still had not figured out why the idea of having sex with another human being caused him guilt, but he was glad this did not.
Toddler Amara wiggles out of his arms and wobbles off into the emptiness.
The food was of course fancy and delicious, and Dean tried to get Crowley to eat it on the couch in front of the TV to avoid feeling like they were on a date, but Crowley insisted they sit at the elaborate dining room table. Despite Dean repeatedly telling Crowley he didn’t feel the same way, Crowley persistently tried to win him over.
Eileen appears around the corner, her hand soaked in blood. She goes immediately to Sam.
They hug for too long. Dean can feel Cas dig his fingers into the back of his jacket and press his face to his chest. Dean rests his chin on top of Cas’ head, something he could never do before. After a second, Dean realizes what he’s doing and abruptly breaks away from Cas, clearing his throat.
While they reorganized her kitchen and simulated cooking tasks, Mildred asked, “So, Dean. Who’s the oldest person you’ve ever hooked up with?”
her, Cas! You and me.” Dean squeezes his hand into a fist, tries to stay calm.
“Cas and I are together.”
But Dean still grumbles to himself on his way out of Sam’s room.
“Oh. Of course, Dean.” Cas tosses a wrapper aside and puts his arms around Dean’s torso, squeezing him firmly back against him.
“Oh, surely you knew Sam made a deal with me to kill my son if I removed the Mark of Cain from your arm. Well, is the Mark gone? Yes. Is Crowley dead? No.” She pauses and makes eye contact with Dean through the rearview mirror. “Oh! He didn’t know! He didn’t know.”
“So, are you, like, dating him?”
He stood from the couch and passed by Cas on his way out of the room, and when his hand accidentally brushed against Cas’ leg, he didn’t stop himself from reaching for him and hauling him up from the couch, leading him down the hall by the hand.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Dean practically shouted, raising up on his elbows because he didn’t yet have the strength for anything else. “Where the fuck do you think you’re going?”
He’s never kissed Cas. He’s wanted to, sure, but he’s never actually done it. So he kisses him slowly, gently, works his mouth against those dry lips and pulls him in closer by the waist.
Dean cupped Cas’ face and rubbed the pad of his thumb gently across his cheek as he looked at him. “Babe. Get a fucking grip.”
“Go, Dean,” Cas said sternly.
Dean blinks back into the conversation all of a sudden. “And what about before that?”
“No. I’m not doing that,” Dean says with conviction. “I’ll get some shackles, put some Enochian crap on there to hold you in case you go rabid. But you haven’t attacked me yet, so that’s a good sign, right?”
“What...what do you have to figure out, Dean?”
He frowns at her. “What do you mean?”
of this! Why won’t you let me do what I want?! Why won’t you let me—” She cuts herself off with another horrifying scream, coupled with the bunker shaking and flickering so hard that they could be entombed at any moment.
“Hey, you alright?” he whispers.
Dean plated his own food: yogurt and granola with fresh fruit cut into it, an omelet with cheese and spinach, a cup of black coffee.
Dean sets his mug down. “Right. Let’s do it.”
“Yeah, you think?”
“I think it’s good that he has someone. There’s a happiness to him I’ve never seen in him before.”
“Wow, that looks way better than before,” Eileen said in awe.
Cas dramatically set his book down in his lap and turned a bitchy face at Dean. “The house is immaculate. I’m not indulging this behavior from you.”
“I don’t think you’ll be able to exercise like you’re used to, not anytime soon at least. You’ll have to take it slow for a while.”
“Uh.” Dean closed his eyes, tried to focus. “The roses around the lion face are for my mom. The forest and, uh, the lion are just, uh—they just look cool, I guess.”
“You’re gonna get too attached,” Sam chastises.
The fake badge Dean gave him. His tie. His name tag at the Gas-n-Sip. His angel blade. He cherishes them all as if they are precious.
“Well, he’s the first actual boyfriend you’ve ever had,” Sam said. “And you’ve only been dating, what, three months?”
“Hmm?”
Dean thinks she’s going to ascend the stairs and walk out with Chuck, but both of them blip out of existence in the blink of an eye.
“Dean, please. Not in public.”
“I can tell you’re the same,” Sam said.
It becomes quickly apparent that the people who died did so violently, and randomly, and most likely by Amara’s hand. Their deaths don’t fit the mold for any other monster, and there’s nobody at the nursing home that could have feasibly killed three people in such a short amount of time. The problem is they can’t figure out why she would have done it, since it directly contradicts everything else she’s doing.
“Dean.”
“Amara,” Dean says, drawing her gaze toward him. “Please. Whatever you’re doing, please just slow it down at least. Please don’t hurt anybody else.”
Dean’s instinct was to argue, to reassure him that everything was fine, but that would be a lie and Dean found it hard to lie to Benny. Instead, he said, “I’m sorry. Last week, I was, uh, unfair to you. I’m just going through some stuff, and I...I don’t know if I can keep living how I’ve been living.”
“Yeah,” Sam says solemnly. “We know it’ll be OK, we’re just...I don’t know, I’m just not naturally maternal like you, Dean.”
Dean moves the hamper to his other hip as they climb the stairs, Dean in front. “You forget I hunted with Dad for four years without you. You’d find stupid stuff to do to avoid spending time with Dad, too.”
“Because he was looking for Lucifer, too.”
Dean’s phone rings.
“Yeah, that’s the fucking
Dean sighs and rolls his eyes. “Do whatever it is you’re gonna do, because you obviously knew we would say no.”
Sam huffs a laugh and grabs an apple from the fridge. “It’s weird, right? I mean, wasn’t the world ending yesterday? Weren’t you about to die?”
“Finished it today,” Dean said shyly as he stepped past Castiel into the apartment. “The last one was the worst, but overall very fucking good.”
Almost as soon as Sam heads back out, the vast silence falls over the bunker once again. Dean plays with Amara on the floor of the library, pretending to eat the fake food that she fake makes for him, while Cas sits at the table with a stack of books. Eventually, Cas speaks.
been years.” He kissed the top of Cas’ head. “I was pent up and horny and frustrated, and I needed something. I couldn’t get laid, because it made me feel too guilty. So I did this instead.”
Dean nearly falls to the ground as he stumbles backward, but Sam gets a fistful of his clothes and yanks him forward and away from the crowd of people.
They could have called Cas, but it wasn’t a big deal, and he was busy helping Jack navigate the world.
“Good lord, I see why he’s given up everything for you,” Jody said. “I mean, like, in a normal way. You’re very cute.”
“I don’t know. One minute I was dead, and the next minute I was alive. Something brought me here, that’s all I know. Why, are you hunting something?” He points around the room. “And what’s up with this place? Do you and Sammy live here?”
“Oh, perfect,” she said quietly as she came into the room.
A Thursday
“Sure. Of course.” Crowley lights up another cigarette. “So when I told you that I could get another room, and you refused, that was just an innocent little courtesy? Not a chance to sleep next to your almost-lover?”
“Dean, what—”
Dean:
“C’mere.” Dean pulls him into a hug, wrapping his arms around his back and holding him tight, nuzzling his face in his neck while Cas fists his hands in the back of Dean’s t-shirt. “Loved you for so long. Should’ve told you sooner.”
Sam laughs humorlessly. "No. Do whatever you want."
psychic now?”
Cas sighed dramatically and turned his head to the side. “I’m not very good at sex.”
Bela insisted on having her own key. She let herself in and said, “Are you ready for me, darling?” while Dean was still face down, ass up on his bed.
Dean’s confidence falters. “I, uh, don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“That’s funny, that’s the opposite of me and my husband. Monogamy first, then realized we hated it.”
Cas squints harder and leans forward so they’re only inches apart. “You knew I was in love with you?”
“Oh hell,” Bobby said loudly, looking at Dean through the mirror. “I wanted one of the pretty ones, not your candy ass.”
Then the cuddling started. Dean woke up one morning with an arm wrapped around his middle, and he pulled on it to make Cas come closer, and they each took a deep breath and melted into each other. They both pretended to be asleep for an hour that morning just so they could keep touching.
She greeted Dean with a hug and a pat to his belly, then she gestured for Cas to give her a hug, too.
“I’ll call you if I need some. In the meantime, I think you’re needed here.” Cas stands and discreetly gestures his head toward Mary.
Dean hummed. “Yeah, my situation’s different.”
“Yeah, well.” Sam shrugs. “Listen to it, at least.”
Dean pouts at him, offended. “I touch you and stare at you constantly every day, of course I fucking notice. You’re big, Cas. And you take good care of yourself. Sam can mind his own fucking business.”
“You know what I mean. Like, do you think about the rest of your life?”
“We got nothing from the demon tablet, and, uh, Cas has been through pretty much every single book we have here, but there are some weird local news stories, and so I looked up some keywords with names of cities in the direction that the sound was heading, and it seems like Amara’s just, like, doing stuff.”
Cas looked down at Dean’s mouth then back up to his eyes. “And an extra toothbrush.”
Cas was his friend. The best friend he had ever had. Dean had always tried his best not to think of Cas like that, because it wasn’t fair to him. They were brothers-in-arms, and Dean was lying here using Cas as fantasy. If he knew, surely he would be horrified.
“No, but it’s only a matter of time, isn't it? What about the angel, is he any better?”
As Cas hands the baby over, he says, “Yes, because your bony body is so much better.”
“Dean.”
Cas laughed lightly and pulled Dean impossibly closer, hugging him and forcing Dean to bury his face in his neck.
Three, he can think of some way of getting Cas back. Trap Lucifer. Ring of holy fire. Appeal to Cas’...heart.
Dean reluctantly lets go of his nipple and straightens up. “Does a bear shit in the woods?”
Crowley looked back and forth between Dean and Castiel, fuming. “You’re going to regret this, Dean. You’ll be crawling back to me in just a few—Castiel is nothing, no—”
“Yeah, his name is Cas,” Dean admitted, spelling out Cas’ name with his right hand. “Eileen, would it be weird if I had a boyfriend?”
Castiel’s heart raced. “I don’t want to do that. I haven’t properly thought about having sex with him, so it would be unenjoyable for us both if I—”
Dean sighs. “I don’t think she’s real. I think I’m just losing my mind, need to get out of here and kill—do something.”
Dean knocked the four into a corner pocket as Benny wrapped his arms around him from behind and nuzzled his beard against his neck. “You know you can be yourself around me, Dean. No bullshit.”
if you would fucking
“Just borrow my scrubs,” Cas muttered, still not opening his eyes or moving. “I’m sure they’ll fit you just fine.”
Dean blinks. “Oh, no, I was just. Sizing y’all up.” He laughs. “It’s nice to meet you.”
Dean blushes and shoves more food in his mouth, avoiding eye contact.
“Maybe at first. Your sons and I have been through much together. It would be difficult for me to leave them at this point.”
“We can’t have a dog in the bunker, Sammy! I don’t want a dog.”
“You pulled him out of hell?” she asks in the kitchen, while he’s looking up news stories on his phone and she’s making coffee.
Cassie was one of his oldest hookups; she had been his Friday for nearly two years. He had read one of her articles online, stalked her on Instagram, realized that she lived near him and immediately sent her a DM. The day they met in person, a Friday, they clicked right away through the shared trait of being very good at having sex with each other.
“No, no, I’m just.” He sighed. “I’m waiting for a text.”
“Hm. You lied. You aren’t ready,” Bela said.
Dean took a deep breath. “C’mere, Cas.”
Feeling brave, Dean went live to test out one of the dildos. After a few strokes to his cock, he poured lube over his hand and opened himself up slowly, moving his hips forward and holding his cock with his left hand then pushing his butt back to take the fingers of his right.
“How do you know she’s a she?”
“Castiel, show yourself!” Dean tries again, desperate. “Expel him! You’ve got to kick Lucifer out! Do you hear me?”
Cas grunted in response.
Crowley copied Dean’s movement, holding their friend close. “This is Lexi. Lexi, this is Dean and Castiel.”
“You just couldn’t for me.”
Cas turned with a surprised look on his face, like he forgot Dean was sitting on the other side of the couch.
Hey, Dean. I hear you’re coming over tonight. Yeah, whatever, asshole. Uh, let me see. Yeah, you’re going to Mr. Patel’s next. Yep. Later.
So when Cas removes his fingers and Dean opens his eyes and finds Cas smiling down at him, something still feels wrong but Dean leans into him anyway as Cas grazes his palm across his cheek.
Really?”
Crowley wasn’t exactly Dean’s type, one reason being that he and Bela shared that unfortunate accent, but he was rich and offered Dean very expensive whiskey and was hung like a goddamn horse.
On the drive home, Dean thought he would feel miserable. Instead, he felt free.
“Yeah.”
He knocks again.
Cas still sat in the back whenever he rode with Sam and Dean, on the passenger side so Dean could rest his right arm across the bench and enjoy the way Cas would surreptitiously rub his skin or lace their fingers together. The cheesy lengths Dean would go to feel Cas’ hands were truly limitless.
By Sunday afternoon, Dean had read four of the books Cas had given him. He hadn’t really moved from his couch since getting home from the doctor on Friday night.
“I don’t need sleep, but I do enjoy it sometimes,” Cas answers. “I’m going to shower now. Which, I suppose, is another task I don’t need to do but like to do anyway...to conserve cosmic energy. Excuse me.”
“What?” Cas asked sweetly.
“I—I got here late,” Cas said, his eyes sliding between Dean and Venus. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you had company. I was just...I was just seeing if you were up.”
So Dean showed up at Cas’ apartment with his arms full of Dunkin’ and when Cas buzzed him in, he said, “Here, hand me a package and I’ll pretend to be Ben Affleck."
“Hmm,” Charlie hums. “So, moving out proves I’m real too, then. Double proof.” She stands and grabs her laptop off the table. “One week ‘til move-in. You guys are helping me.”
“What? How? You left at, like, 3 yesterday. Oh, no. You picked up a guy at the gym. Dean, you said you wouldn’t pick anybody up at the—”
Dean thinks if he doesn’t get to kill something soon then he’s going to drive his car into a ditch. He needs to yell, scream, tear his hair out, punch a wall, break some shit until the images of him and Cas in bed together fade from his memory.
“Hey, Winchester,” she replied, dropping her duffel bag by the sideboard and going immediately to the fridge. “I already ate dinner, but I’m fucking starving.”
Clint and Ida May come down the stairs a minute after Sam, both of them looking a bit hesitant until Dean waves them in and loudly announces that he’s Dean. The couple looks to be in their 50s, both Black with dark skin, Ida May small and wiry with a bun of graying dreadlocks, and Clint short and stout with glasses and corkscrew curls cropped close to his scalp. Dean looks at them critically for exactly three seconds before Clint points at himself with a gap-toothed grin and says, “I’m transgender, in case that’s what you’re trying to figure out.”
So he waits until Sam is paying attention, and then he leans over and sloppily kisses Cas’ temple.
“Yeah, never been better.” She smiled. “Not to kiss and tell, but Ryan and I have a lot of threesomes now.”
“The shower pressure is as good as I remember it,” Cas states. He takes a seat across from Sam, moving slower than usual but clearly trying not to make a big deal out of it.
“Reefer.”
“I mean, you know Cas better than anyone,” Sam says casually. “If you think something’s up with him, something’s probably up with him.”
“Like I said, not easy,” Billie repeats.
An hour passes, and still Cas doesn’t show up at Dean’s door.
Dean raises his voice again. “Crowley, I swear to god, if you find her and don’t tell me—”
Dean wishes he had something to smoke, something to occupy his hands. “I didn’t like you being in Paula’s body either, in case you didn’t notice.”
Cas looked at him.
“Hey, wait, before we do that—” Dean fisted his hand in the front of Cas’ shirt and yanked him down for a kiss.
Dean didn’t say anything for several long seconds. His ears stuck out too far and his neck looked longer, his forehead bigger.
Sam shrugs. “I don’t know, it’s just easier. Paula’s a woman, and Cas is genderless, I’m pretty sure. What was it you used to call the angels? Junkless?”
“What’d you do to Cas?”
Sam laughed and looked at Dean like he had grown a second head. “What, did you miss me?”
Dean whipped out his phone and texted Billie.
“I can take a look at it if you’d like.”
“It’s a ghost, Cas, we can kill it with one hand tied behind our backs,” Dean replied, lips at Cas’ neck, hands on his hips.
“I’m sorry,” Cas said solemnly.
Sam takes off at a sprint again, Dean close at his heels yelling, “What did you hear! Get the fuck back here, Sammy! We were just having phone sex,
It was Crowley. Their mouth dropped open and his face drained of color when he saw Castiel.
He squints at her as he buttons his shirt. “You’re, uh, bisexual? Bi?”
expecting the night to end with a hot guy’s hands on his bare ass.
After she leaves, Dean putters around in his room for a bit deciding whether he should wake Cas up. Ten impatient minutes later, he shakes his shoulder and loudly says, “Hey.”
Things seem unreasonably calm when they get back to the bunker. It's still a wreck, with chunks of concrete and fallen furniture scattered around, but it's livable.
It hits Dean all at once.
It’s an impossible task to help everyone, but he tries. He tries and he tries. The fog never touches him, but he doesn’t worry about it anyway. If it really is from Amara, he doesn’t think it would affect him the way it affects others. Whatever she might say, he knows the truth. She still loves him.
Dean followed Sam into the spare bedroom, where Eileen was ratcheting together two pieces of a bed frame. She waved at Dean and kept working.
Dean was definitely up for it.
“Yeah, it’s OK. The special effects only kind of hold up.”
“No, I don’t drink. But I can get you a glass if you’d like.”
On their way out, Dean saw Eileen signing to Sam that it was ridiculous that Cas could move in so easily while Sam still dragged his feet about her.
“Hey, that’s not—OK, maybe, yeah, sure.” Sam looks at the baby then back at the door then back at the baby. “So, what should I do? Should I get the formula?”
bad at sex?”
“Something you should know about my brother is that he, like, probably has OCD,” Sam said apropos of nothing. “Or, like, whatever it is that makes a person have to keep everything in their life perfectly organized or else he feels out of control.”
“Oh. Yeah, OK.” Dean tried to sit up but only made it to his elbow. His eyes were half-closed. “Hey, wait. This was fun, right?”
Dean pulled him down to his bed anyway. “Well, just lay next to me, would you?” He curled onto his side, away from Cas, and fell asleep.
Their shower is just big enough for both of them, but it’s too difficult to do much more than wash each other’s bodies. They talk loudly to each other over the spray, which is why neither of them hear the front door open and Sam and Eileen announce their arrival.
It worries Dean, but then they get back to the bunker and he sees Cas’ car and another unfamiliar car out front and he forgets everything else.
“Oh, buddy,” Pati responded with a patronizing pat to his sternum. “Anyway, do you think we have time for you to eat me out before that pizza’s done?”
“I’m not discussing that with you, Claire.”
Exactly four seconds pass before Dean forces his eyes wide open and pulls his phone out again. He tries to call Sam, no answer. He calls Charlie, and she answers on the third ring.
“This is all I wanna do every day for the rest of our lives.”
“Both,” Dean said.
Sam hates when Cas is gone, not only because he’s his best friend and he misses him, but because of the damn phone calls.
“Whatever, I’m going to find Mom.” Dean stomps off, equal parts embarrassed and glad that things are back to normal enough for Sam to tease him.
“Well, you could try talking to him. Tell him you want him to come back home.”
Castiel’s memory clicked into place. “Dean. He’s a CNA—no, a therapist. At that SNF I do PRN for every once in a blue moon.”
Another step. Dean could mention that he had a duffel bag in his car that was meant for Cassie’s house, but he didn’t feel like walking all the way back downstairs. He put his hands on Cas’ hips. “Let’s go to bed.”
Dean nods and leaves, his brain a jumble of thoughts as he tries to parse out what the fuck he’s supposed to do. He passes Charlie in the hall, and she points toward the library without saying anything.
A beat passes. Then Sam says, “Apologize to Cas when we get home.”
“Your body’s in homeostasis,” Cas says. “But you could be readjusting, since it’s been so long since you were just...you. Did your habits change when you had the Mark?”
“What?”
“Reckless,” Cas chastised as he dragged Dean back toward the crowd.
Dean stared at him. They were minor injuries, but they hurt like hell, and Dean couldn’t really afford more ugly scars in his videos. He gave Cas a nod.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, Amara, slow down,” Dean says, going to her and reaching for her shoulders to get her to stop.
Dean tightens his grip on his fork and looks back down at his food. “Would you please pass the salt,
Dean then heads over to the coffee maker – or, rather, he
Clint, Ida May, Charlie and Eileen are all sitting at the war room table. Eileen has a small gray cat in her lap. Ida May says, “Oh honey, are you allergic to cats? You should’ve told us, we could’ve—”
“Oh. Um.”
Jesse and Cesar both laugh. Cesar says, “What do you mean ‘get the cops out of here’? Like they’d listen to us.”
Cas was smiling shyly when Dean returned to him. Dean gestured that it was time to go, then he set some bills on the counter and waved at Pamela.
Cas closed the book he had been reading. “Of course.”
“Yeah, actually. But I’m not a little kid anymore, so I don’t have a clue how to talk to her.” He doesn’t add that he thinks their mom feels the same.
She wore tight-fitting workout clothes and had a yoga mat rolled up under one arm. “You look fat,” she said.
“Anyway, get your laundry done,” Sam says. “I’m leaving with Eileen soon, gonna make sure she gets home safe.”
Cas keeps staring at his book. “Yeah.”
When she’s almost out of the room, he calls after her and reminds her that she hasn’t placed the order yet. She laughs and hits her forehead. He shows her how to use an iPhone. She calls it ridiculous and asks why they even say it’s a phone when in reality its other uses far outweigh its ability to make calls. He blinks at her.
“Hm. Sounds suspicious, but alright.”
“Morning, Cas!” Dean interrupts as he places a kiss on Cas’ head, too.
“Thank you, Dean.” He’s still looking at his book.
tell him, all the stuff he didn’t keep secret. Instead he says, “It didn’t seem like a big deal. Although now I’m wondering if it’s some kind of ghost sickness.”
“Get the fuck out of here,” Dean seethed, barely above a whisper, as he moved forward on his crutches and bore down on Crowley.
Dean sends a text to Cas.
Cas squints his eyes and hums. “Hm. Maybe.” He points to the journal on Dean’s desk. “Is it helping? To keep track of time?”
It happens a dozen times in a week before Sam has had enough and decides to bring it up at breakfast.
Lexi said, “So, should we get a table for four?”
Sam takes in a shaky breath. “Uh, well, we can try to do something about it. We can—we can—we—”
The last thing he reaches for is a note hanging up in his locker that had been hiding behind work schedules and procedures.
They all hang out outside until Raven wakes up and cries for food, so Dean takes her inside and paces around the kitchen while he gives her a bottle. Cas walks through on his way to the bathroom, and Dean stops him with a, “Hey. C’mere.”
They spend the rest of the day not talking about it. Dean takes Amara outside again; he doesn’t push Cas to join them. They watch TV in Cas’ room in the afternoon, with Amara claiming that she’s too “grown-up” for
Cas furrowed his brow. “At the store, I assume.”
A Saturday
He never asked what Sam and Cas did with the bodies after he murdered the Stynes. He never asked how much grace Cas burned through to heal himself after Dean beat him to a pulp.
“I’ll be OK.” He picks up his beer and turns it in his hand, looking at it curiously. “I may need some rest.”
“Gay?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Breaking through the mist comes Amara, still a teenager but a little bit older, a little bit taller. She’s wearing jeans and combat boots, a black t-shirt and an open burgundy button-down over it. Her hair is pulled into a bun, no makeup on her face. She crosses her arms over her chest as she looks at Sam and Dean.
They stayed about an hour, with Dean and Mildred doing most of the talking while Cas just quietly drank the tea Mildred offered him.
“Just not here,” Sam continues. “Look, we could use your help. If you’re planning on following us around, you might as well—”
The tension eases out of Dean’s body through a breathless laugh. “Yeah, well, maybe one day you’ll get the chance. You gonna try to eat, or no?”
Dean yells, begs Lucifer not to touch it, but then his hand is covering it and nothing happens. He looks at Dean with fury in his eyes.
Cas cuts Dean’s argument off with a kiss. It’s just a tentative press of lips, but Dean still lets out a needy, embarrassing whimper as it happens. When Cas pulls away, Dean mumbles, “Nuh-uh,” and grabs him by the cheek to pull him back in. His hip is digging into the edge of the table, but he doesn’t care. He doesn’t care.
Figuring that drinking would give him a viable excuse to sleep over, Dean accepted a glass. They sat together in Cas’ kitchen and talked about movies until Dean felt tipsy from the wine and excused himself to go to the bathroom. When he came back, Cas was eating ice cream straight out of a half gallon and asked Dean if he wanted his own.
“Unless you want to help us on this case, not really, no. Did Sam pray you here or something?”
“Whose side are you on, Cas?” He pushes himself back from the table and tucks Penelope under his arm, his mug of coffee in his other hand. “And now look. This animal needs to go out, and I have to take her.”
He’s telling the truth, but it’s still difficult when he gets in bed. He feels pumped full of adrenaline from Charlie being alive, but they didn’t even tell her about Amara, and it’s probably going to make for an awkward morning. He shifts and turns under the covers for several long minutes until two familiar fingers gently press his forehead to make him stop.
Mary opens the door and smiles at both of them. “You missed the end of the movie.” She leans against the wall. “I know we’re on backup duty for Cas, but how would you boys feel about going on a hunt?”
The movie kind of sucked, so they moved to a corner in the back row and whispered through the entire thing. They shared a large popcorn, and Dean drank his weight in Coke slush.
-references rule. Uh, let’s see. We were in a Tiffany Jackson novel, huh, how ‘bout that?”
During mile number two, Dean fell and broke his foot.
“God, don’t tell me you guys are having a kid, too,” Dean teased.
They wait in the lobby of a Los Angeles hotel for nearly 30 minutes before Cas and Crowley show up. It’s one of the fanciest hotels Dean’s ever stepped foot in, and somehow Crowley is the only one who doesn’t look out of place. Dean makes a comment to Cas about how stiff he looks in his usual trench coat, and Cas retorts that he looks like a lumberjack.
“Yeah, sure, but you wouldn’t indulge like that on your own.”
“No, no,” Sam interrupts. “Dean is
Claire says, “It’s, like, the UK chapter I guess? They’re trying to recruit American hunters for...I don’t know, something. Jody didn’t want to meet with them, so I’m going instead just to see what it’s about.”
Dean clicked out of his text messages and pulled up a search bar, typing in “how to get a paternity test.”
Dean looked over at Benny and waited for him to continue.
“Why would it be the wrong decision to tell Dean? He’s obsessed with you,” Charlie said like it was nothing.
“OK, the hallucination is once again a nightmare,” Sam says seriously. He closes his laptop and heads toward the kitchen.
Cas frowned at him. “No, you’re definitely one of those giant stuffed animals I won at an amusement park.”
“Yeah but it does other stuff. You just switch the nozzle and take some fluxed rod and it heats it up and melts it into that nice gol– seriously, do you want to just come insi–”
Cas clears his throat.
“I didn’t take Amara, she came with me,” Rowena says dismissively. “And time isn’t linear, dear boy. Do you even know what the date is?”
“It’s 2022.”
“Of course. Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Yeah. Yeah, it does.”
“Give me a call sometime, Castiel,” Dean said seriously. “And by ‘sometime’ I mean ideally in the next 20 minutes.” He winked again and walked away.
“Coming right up, sunshine,” Dean replied with a kiss to his forehead.
“You look good, Cas,” he says softly. “Like Lucifer didn’t use you up too much.”
Charlie smiles knowingly at him and gestures her head toward the hall as she says, “Get out of here.”
“What the hell’s a djinn?”
Dean cracked it the smallest amount, his body still tangled with Cas. “We’re a little busy here, Sammy.”
“And my appetite apparently,” Dean adds as he stands. “Don’t worry, Mom, we have steaks in the freezer. I got it.”
“All right, T-Rex, no barking when we get inside, OK? We have to stay quiet so my scary big brother doesn’t make me take you back.” As if T-Rex was actually capable of barking. Sam imagines she probably has more of a small yelp for a voice. In any case, she’s still sound asleep.
Days turned into weeks, and things began to feel normal. As Dean relaxed into his friendship with Cas, he realized what a relief it was to know the certainty of their relationship’s strength. He never doubted himself anymore, never worried that he might push Cas away or hurt him, because Cas’ love was so solid and sure, ever-present and easy. Sometimes, he looked at Cas and the thought would cross his mind,
“Um,” Cas continues. “Claire is here, too. She’s actually the one who found the lead.”
Sam wishes for the sweet embrace of death the first time he walks past the bunker’s bathroom and hears Cas’ voice
Dean can feel his mom still looking into the room, but he ignores her as he makes his bed.
“It’s been fine.” She looks away from him. “I, um. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. We’ll talk later when we’re not, you know…” She gestures vaguely.
Suddenly, the woman was shouting loud enough for everyone on the hall to hear. “Well, he’s going to dump you next, you ugly wanker! Excuse me for trying to give you a courtesy call.”
Cas takes a step toward Dean and puts his small hand on his shoulder. “Get some rest, Dean.”
Dean relaxed in his chair and put his arm over the back of Charlie’s. “I’m fine, guys. Really.”
There is no touch in hell.
“Well, yes, if other people view him as a woman and it doesn’t bother him and he doesn’t correct them, then sure,” Clint says with a shrug. “But again, I’m not an expert on this. I’d rather die than paint my nails.”
After a minute or so, Dean says, “Uh, when you’re up for it, do you think you could help Cas?”
“I don’t know. I don’t like the yelling, though. It upsets me, and confuses me.” She looks away, clearly lost in thought. “I want things to be simple, but they aren’t simple, are they? I thought things were as simple as you love Castiel, and Castiel loves you, and you both have taken care of me for the majority of my life and taught me how to love. But things aren’t that simple.”
Cas had a concerned look on his face, and a big stack of books under his arm. “Um. I’m sorry.” His eyes flickered down to Dean’s bare torso, then farther down to Dean’s crotch, then back up to his face. “I was waiting for you to respond, but I was driving by here on my way home from work—I have to work late this week—so I figured I would just stop by. I brought books.”
“Yeah, Dean, what the hell. You look great.”
She turns and looks up at him with empty eyes. Completely white eyes, like Pamela’s fake ones after Cas burned hers out. Or like Lilith's.
“We think it’s Lucifer,” Cas continues.
Dean shook his head. “Not really.”
Cas shuffles around in his arms and kisses him languidly. Even though they’ve been together for months and have shared at least a thousand kisses, a thrilling warmth washes over Dean’s body every time Cas initiates.
That gets a smile and a small laugh out of Cas. He leaves the bathroom still wearing just a towel. Dean doesn’t watch him go, but he waits until he hears the door close before he turns the shower on.
“Hm,” Castiel grunted.
“Yeah, sorry, uh. Venus, this is Cas. Cas, Venus.”
“I...I don’t know.”
He doesn’t know whether he’s talking to Amara or to God, but he figures it doesn’t much matter. Neither of them are going to respond anyway.
They’re walking into a gas station, and Dean reaches his hand back for Cas to take. Cas hooks his index finger around Dean’s pinky, and a woman walking out of the store smiles down at their hands as she holds the door open for them.
The vase is fine.
Dean turns to raise an eyebrow at her. “Are you making fun of me?”
“Ida May? Are they octogenarian southerners?”
“Hey,” Dean responds.
“Yes. Let’s go.”
“No, I’m not—I don’t think it’s her. But maybe. I don’t know.” Dean’s regretting the call.
that?” Dean asks Sam after Cas leaves. He showed up before they even woke up this morning.
“Do I call you ‘him’ or ‘her,’ Cas?” Dean asks derisively, looking in the rearview mirror so he can make eye contact with Cas’ new big blue eyes.
“How long have you two been going out?” Dean asked.
“You’re up early,” Dean mumbled softly.
Cassie looked between both of them. “Jerome? Who the hell is Jerome?”
“I think I’m seeing a ghost.”
While he’s brushing his teeth at the sink in his room, Sam knocks on his door and, as usual, comes in without waiting for a response.
“Dude,
They all begin talking over each other in robotic voices.
Cas doesn’t say anything for a few seconds. There’s still the sounds of a fight happening in the library, but they both continue to ignore it.
Sam says, “Um, OK,” at the same time that Dean says, “No.”
“What?” Cas asks gently when they break apart.
“Oh. Lisa.”
“Queen,” Dean lied. “And I like Lizzo, Janelle Monae, and any new pop music, really.”
“Dean, please tell me you didn’t drink everything but this,” Sam says, annoyed.
Dean knows, the next day, that Cas notices that the alcohol’s gone. He doesn’t say anything about it.
Cas looks at him. Dean wants desperately to reach out, to touch him.
Dean props himself up on his elbows so he can look over his shoulder and see Dr. Novak grinning like a fucking
Dean pulls into a shopping center and parks far away from any other cars, then he opens local news on his phone and immediately finds multiple accounts of the infection, with descriptions of people going rabid and killing one another. It seems to be happening within a 10-mile radius of the bunker.
“Yeah, uh.” Dean cleared his throat. “Someone else left a hickey on me, so he had to correct that.”
“Everyone dies at some point, Amara,” Sam says. “We—people—can’t stay on earth forever. It’s sad for the people left behind on earth, because we no longer get to see that person anymore, but it’s a part of life that we have to accept.”
Dean:
Cas looks down and palms at the dark red stain on his shirt. “Yes. I healed myself, but you were right. I’m going to have a scar there.”
And Dean would love to just get up and go to his room and pass out, but Charlie claims that she’s pretty tired, too, and would like to know where she’ll be sleeping.
“OK.”
Sam looks off in the distance again. “We do suddenly have a lot of LGBT friends. Oh, god. Do we have to include Crowley in that, too?”
On their way home, Dean had one hand on the steering wheel and the other entwined with Cas’. He rocked their hands together back and forth against Cas’ thigh.
Sam looked around, coughing. “We split up. I thought he’d be…”
Later, Dean goes on a supply run and picks up dinner for everybody. He stops by the liquor store, too.
“Hey, look at me,” Dean says, imbuing his voice with confidence. “I’m right here. You need anything, you call. You come right back here if you feel like you need to, OK?”
“Why aren’t you telling me the whole truth?” Tears welled up in Cas’ eyes. “When were you gonna tell me that I’m just a day of the week to you?”
Dean huffs a laugh. “It never even registered to me that you usually do that.” He runs his fingers along the small, even scar on Cas’ abdomen. “Wow, this looks good. The guy who stitched you up must’ve known what he was doing.”
He texted Charlie and asked if she wanted to meet him at a gay bar.
Cassie:
Dean ignores her and whispers to Cas, “I don’t give a shit about you stuffing your face, babe, I just wish your hands were more Dean-focused.”
Cas scoffs from the master bath. “You just want to hold a newborn.”
So when it did happen in the human year of 2013, he could feel immediately that his grace was gone and that the body he inhabited was the whole of who he was. He had headaches most of the time, and he figured it was due to the human brain not being able to process the thousands of years of information Castiel knew. His body ached and itched and jerked of its own accord, and he could no longer stand in one spot unmoving for hours not just because his body wouldn’t physically let him but because he would get antsy and bored after just a few minutes.
“Hm. Maybe they really are working their shit out.”
“Yeah, a tiny bit. It doesn’t look like you could cook an egg on your abs anymore.”
“I’ll, um,” Cas starts. “I’ll try my best.”
“Hey, Cas.”
“I, um. I love you, too, Cas,” Dean said, choking a little bit as he hugged Cas against his chest. “God, I love you.” He was shaking, his breathing ragged, probably due to his body releasing a decade’s worth of tension with one simple phrase.
“No, I definitely think you’ve lost weight,” Jody continues.
“Except you kind of seem like you are, hon,” Mildred said sweetly.
Castiel grimaced. “I’m trying. I think I’m afraid of what he might say to me.”
“What if it’s Amara?”
Charlie sniffles.
“Of course, Dean.”
He made it all the way to what used to be the front door of the house before a hand grabbed his shoulder from behind and forcefully yanked him back.
“Would you like some tea?” Castiel asked, opening a cabinet to get mugs.
Raven fusses and nuzzles against Cas’ shoulder, so Dean reaches his arms out for her and says, “Too much muscle in your shoulder, she can’t get comfy.”
“He has a new boyfriend and he’s meeting his family tonight,” Hannah replied from the couch, where they were scrolling through their phone and pointedly not helping with the pie.
going to talk about it, and he’s just going to have to keep living in hell.
On Monday, Dean desperately wanted to tell Charlie everything that had happened to him over the weekend, but they didn’t have time between patients to really get into it.
“What?” Charlie and Cas asked simultaneously.
“Yeah, I’m sure.” Cas let go of his ass, giving it one final pat before going back into his room to change.
Part 2
Dean slung his arm around Cas’ shoulders and pressed a sloppy kiss to his temple. Lips against his face, he mumbled, “But at some point you’ll let me do some kinky shit, right?”
The kettle whistled, so Castiel kissed the top of Dean’s head and let him go.
When Cas asks, “How did you two get into hunting?” a kind of quiet falls over the room, like they’re sitting around a campfire in anticipation of a ghost story.
“I think it’s a good idea for me and Dean to go,” Cas says once the situation is explained to him. He turns toward Dean. “When Amara wakes up, we are the last people she will want to see. Besides, Sam and Charlie will be less susceptible to…”
He moved his t-shirt the slightest bit, revealing the tip of his dick out of the top of his too-tight jean shorts.
Later that night as Dean and Cas curl up in bed together, Dean says, “I was wondering why it was so easy to sneak around lately.”
“I count down the days each week until I get to see you again. I give you your space, I don’t bother you with texts or calls, I let you decide on the schedule—so how much longer? When do I get more of you?”
A knock on the door broke Castiel out of his reverie. Dean stirred and mumbled something incoherent in his sleep, so Castiel got up to answer it.
Charlie, but she was, uh, manifested by Amara, so she’ll be fine. They can’t really hurt her.”
Dean finishes in his head. “It’s a supernatural being that’s, um, trying to make the world better.”
Jesse and Cesar made it just in time for dinner. Everybody helped move the kitchen table around so they could add a leaf to it and put more chairs around it. Cas and Dean didn’t sit next to each other, and Dean watched warily as Cas had a quiet conversation with Jesse and Cesar all through the meal.
“She works on the weekends at a nonprofit. Would you like coffee?”
“You got a place to stay up here?”
For the rest of the day, Dean felt warm and loved. His coworkers teased him about how lovesick he looked with Cas so nearby, but he didn’t care.
Dean tapped his fingers impatiently against his steering wheel as he drove, not even in time with the music. Billie texted him back, telling him not to worry about it and to feel better soon. Of course she believed him, because he almost never called out. He certainly never called out for one of his hookups.
“Yeah. Sorry.” Dean fidgeted in his chair. “I’m glad you’re here, Cas.”
Dean scrubs a hand down his face. “Yeah. Sounds about right. Now can we never talk about this again? Please?”
bad. How the hell do you live like that?”
“Charlie, Cas is not—”
A few awkward seconds pass before Cas answers. “I suppose I should be flattered, but.” He shrugs and looks down at his food. “I would kill Crowley for a lot less.”
“Ah, so now that you’ve finally slowed down and stopped being so hard on yourself, you realize what you want in life?”
Dean smiled and nodded reassuringly. “That’s OK, Cas. We can just sleep.”
“No.”
The people were mostly OK, some minor injuries, many of them traumatized. They all stood on the road together tending to one another until the fire department arrived.
Eileen bursts out laughing.
“It was
“No, no, you’re fine,” Sam placates with a smile. “You don’t have to tell us your every move.”
“Dean, every man here either wants to be you or fuck you. I’m going to lose clients if you do nerd shit.”
“Alright, you have to leave,” Dean said calmly. “You’re gonna get the fucking cops called on me. Or worse, the HOA.”
Boring.
“Well, let’s hope so.” Dean nods at him. “It’s nice, at least, not feeling like we’re all gonna die at any moment.”
Dean was in a panic.
“Yeah, that's 'cause I'm fat. Would you still fuck me?” He winked at her.
“Dean? Are you OK?” Cas asks as he helps him up to a sitting position. Billie stands a few feet behind him.
Dean swallows. “Cas and I are not—we’re just friends. He’s my best friend.”
It was difficult. At first, he thought Dean would know. He thought Dean would be able to feel it, with it being so close, just right there inside his rib cage, but Dean acted the same as always. Even when Dean understood that Cas gave up an entire army for him, Cas could tell that Dean didn’t understand
Dean is contemplating the decisions he made to save a town on Halloween, Cas shows up to talk him through it.
“That’s not because – look, I’m doing my best, alright?”
marathon?
Dean starts, “Did you get the house thing figure—”
Once they were a couple hundred feet away, Dean scanned the area for signs of Sam and Cas. Just as he was about to panic, Sam ran out of the wreckage, t-shirt wrapped around the lower half of his face.
He imagined strong hands gripping his waist, digging fingers into his newly plump skin, a soft but sure touch. He could hear Cas’ voice tenderly asking if he was ready before pushing his cock in.
I'm planning to post on Sundays! Hopefully it will be weekly, but I'll try to give updates in chapter notes in case I have to slow down at some point. I'm also trying to be disciplined with chapter length, so expect all chapters to be between 4-6k words.
It’s not like he hasn’t had this conversation a thousand times before. It shouldn’t be any different this time around.
“Yeah, definitely. I just assumed y’all had a fight about something.”
“Dean,” a voice says behind him, and he doesn’t recognize it until he turns and sees Cas. “It’s her.”
Dean looks back and forth between the two of them with a confused expression. “You two sleeping together behind my back or something?”
“Whoa, whoa, she told you that?” Sam asks. “You said you watched some TV with her, maybe she learned it from that?”
“Oh, fuck off,” Crowley interrupts. He walks away from Dean and over to the bed. “I might be able to help your angel if you let me take him to hell.”
Sam clears his throat; Crowley says an annoyed, “Oh bloody hell.”
“Wow, look at you. Hardly recognized you with that hair,” Lee replied, looking Dean up and down. “You doing alright for yourself?”
“You’re roasting the vegetables?”
“Damn it, Sammy, you could’ve fucking told me. What if you had—you could’ve died.”
“And how exactly did you help him with that?”
“Dean,” Sam interrupts. “We got Cas back, that’s what matters. Stop worrying so much about a vessel, OK?”
Dean stays by his car for a few more minutes and replays all the conversations he’s had today in his head. He feels like he keeps saying the wrong thing, and everyone else has been saying the wrong thing back to him. He wishes he was home.
Pati:
“Don’t you fucking talk to me like that. You know not to talk to me like that, boy.”
“C’mon, let’s go back inside. See if we can find anything on Lucifer,” Dean says.
“Oh, hey, Dean,” Sam says. “This is Max and Alicia Banes. They’re hunters-slash-witches.”
“Oh yeah, wonder where I learned that word from, huh?”
“What? No. Sorry, what’d you ask?”
“Relax,” Dean said as he went to the door.
“Sam, you haven’t even given me enough information for me to ask Dean what you’re talking about, so you’re going to have to tell me,” Castiel said forcefully. “And I’m already thinking the worst, so the sooner you can explain yourself the better.”
Dean buys enough stuff to fill the trunk and the whole of the backseat. While loading the car, he feels someone approaching him from behind and immediately puts his hand on the gun in his waistband and turns toward them. He hopes he doesn’t need more than the gun, because every other weapon is buried under a pile of things for Amara.
He passes by Cas in the hallway, Cas’ hair wet from the shower, pajama pants slung low on his hips. Dean’s eyes flicker down to Cas’ bare torso for half a second before he looks at his face.
“Did you not know, Amara?” Sam asks.
“It is?” Sam asks.
“Nothing, man. I just—you left the bunker so suddenly the other day, and, I don’t know.” He closes his eyes again. “We’re OK, right?”
“If he wants you to call him in 20 minutes, that probably means he doesn’t have plans with someone else. He also only got one drink. You don’t want to spend time with a man who’s going to eat two burritos in the next 20 minutes,” Hannah reasoned.
Pati smiled at him then got up from the couch, kissing him on the lips before taking the empty pizza pan back to the kitchen. Dean looked around for his phone but didn’t see it anywhere near him.
Sam and Eileen walk up to Dean then, breaking him out of whatever trance Billie had him under. He didn’t even notice the two of them come out of the nursing home.
“I don’t know. You know, I went through the usual routine, suggesting a movie or whatever, sitting close, clearly not intending to actually watch a movie, you know the drill.” He nervously took the headband off his wrist and pushed it up into his hair, getting the shaggiest part of it out of his face. “And then we, uh, watched a fucking movie. I fell asleep.”
“Well, I’m learning all kinds of new things today,” Dean says, pinching his eyebrows together as he glares at Cas. “I’m glad Paula’s having a good time, but we have to get you back.”
“Charlie and the Lerners are back, they brought groceries and they’re making dinner now.” She frowns at him. “Honey, I don’t mean to pry, but I’m still kind of confused about you and Cas. You’re sure you aren’t...Um, after everything you and Sam explained to me, you know it would be OK with me if you and Cas were…”
Dean balks at that. “What? Really?”
“Oh?”
“Darling, who’s Cas?” Bela asked from the living room as Dean poured wine in the kitchen.
It was only as he was drifting off to sleep that he thought to check his videos. He had a handful of subscribers on OnlyFans already, and some people had left him tips. It wasn’t any significant amount of money he had made so far, but it was more than nothing.
on his way in the door, calling to Gordon as he passed the front desk, “Is this an acceptable book for the other guys to maintain their fantasies of me?”
Cas laughs and then starts to cough.
“Yeah, what is it?”
“Where’s Sam?” Dean asks. He sits on the edge of the bed, near Cas’ knees.
“Check the news,” Cas says, his voice tinny on speaker. “Crowley should be sending you a link now.”
Castiel hardly knew Charlie, but Charlie knew parts of him better than anyone.
“I’m sorry, Dean, I don’t know—I don’t know why I’m—why I can’t—”
“Yeah, OK, I’ll see you later, Cas.”
“Now, I don’t know. I don’t feel sorry for him. What he did was shitty.” Dean shrugs. “But I don’t hate him, either. He actually did apologize once. When I was human again, he apologized.”
“Let me fix it at least,” Cas says as he reaches his hand across the table, two fingers stretched toward Dean’s forehead.
“Oh! I gotta ask you. Um. That meatloaf you used to make when I was a kid. You still know the recipe?”
She gives him an amused look as she asks, “Did you just eeny, meeny, miny, moe to decide who to hit on?”
It’s not like Sam
“Uh, yeah?”
“Everybody
Just as Dean was hoisting his left leg onto his bed, one of the phones rang in the library. He sighed and moved his leg rest back into place, then wheeled out to the hallway, hoping he could get to the phone in time. Sam was on a hunt with Eileen out in Iowa, and Jody and Claire were taking out some werewolves up in Nowhere, Michigan, but other than that, nobody else should be calling.
Granted, it was better than the sterility of before. But still, Dean obsessively cleaned.
Dean passes Sam in the hallway and tells him to stay with Cas while he gets the restraints.
The ground shakes beneath their feet so intensely that people in the restaurant scream and fall. The lights flicker and go out. The floor splinters and cracks as if it’s about to open into a chasm.
“Dean,” Benny said, right in his face.
Amara gets to Dean first. She is, as usual, impossibly bigger. Dean hands her a bag of new clothes when he sees her in the hallway, and she presses her hand to his arm and gestures for him to follow her into her room.
Dean climbs up the hill above the bunker’s entrance and aims his spray paint at a wall. “Did he not make you feel uncomfortable at all? Like, did he touch you or anything?”
When Dean finishes cleaning the kitchen, he heads to the living room where they’ve set up a workspace to help hunters out. Sure, it would be easier to do the job from the bunker, but Dean and Cas wanted their own space, a homier environment for hunters to stop by and rest. They have a room for Jack, a room for Claire and Kaia, and two extra bedrooms for anybody else who shows up—although, one of the rooms is half-full of Cas’ exercise equipment.
Cas smiles at her. “It’s alright, Mary. I’m still me.”
He panicked as he opened YouTube, as if he just realized what he had done and how reckless it was. What was he thinking, making amateur porn on a whim just because his dick is big? He was losing it.
Third, he felt guilty because of Cas.
“How’d you do it?”
Amara drops her arms and deflates a little. “You don’t make this easy.”
“Sorry, everybody!” Dean shouted at the neighbors. “Get back to your regularly scheduled jerk-off sessions!”
[side-eye emoji]
“I don’t know. I mean, uh–”
Sam spits coke and starts to choke and has to excuse himself. Cas says something, but Dean talks over him.
“Do you, uh, want to meet her, or...?”
friendly to him.
Dean walks over to Cas and puts his arm across his middle, presses his cheek firmly against the side of Cas’ chubby face and looks at Jody as he says, “No.”
“No, I haven’t. It’s on my list though.”
“Yeah, well. Still.”
“Hey, could you check out my foot?” he asked, very casual.
“I…no, I haven’t.”
“At least tell me if I’m in a dream, please. Can you at least do that for me? I know you—you cared about me, you said you loved me, and now I don’t even know if you knew what that meant, but I just—can you help me out here? Can you help me understand?”
Weirdly, the first thing Dean felt was disappointment. He quickly texted her back.
In the winter, Sam has to buy tiny sweaters for her, which becomes a problem when Dean does the laundry and shows up in the kitchen holding one of them.
“Oh my god, guys, Dean went to the ER with burns and cuts on his ass because he fell into a broken bowl of hot oatmeal, and Cas hit on him right there in the doctor’s office because he has a thing for dirty, chubby blue collar workers,” Charlie blurts out.
Three hours later, Cas, Sam and T-Rex are at the local animal shelter picking up their new medium-sized mutt named Penelope. She’s got floppy ears and a long snout and she licks way too much. Sam was worried T-Rex would be scared of the much larger dog, but on the contrary she’s jumping and pawing at Penelope like they’re best friends already.
Dean squirmed and batted at the hands around his stomach. “C’mon, man, just let me—”
“Good, I think. Not sure yet.”
“Yes?”
Ignoring him, Crowley said, “Well, he looks different now, darling.”
He is home when he is touched, and he may not know a whole lot about love but he knows
Sam whispered something indecipherable to Cas while Dean said, “I don’t make any money at
he made this tape, who he had in mind when he made this tape, who this was really meant for, but the words get stuck in his throat.
“You don’t have to talk about it, but, like, it
“You are, though, right? In love with him?” she pressed.
“No, no, I’m not going anywhere with you until I get some—”
He pulled the creamer out of the fridge and dumped a generous portion into his coffee. “I can’t afford the calories, dude. C’mon.”
Dean storms out of the room. Charlie tries to follow him, but he shouts over his shoulder for her to stay with Cas, and she doesn’t argue.
“I’m happy for you, Dean.”
Dean says, “Do you think that would be good for you? Would it help with, uh, adjusting?”
Cas looks at him with a sad expression. “We always knew what she was. I tried to keep my distance, but I did—I did feel as if I was caring for her like my own. Like she was ours.” He shakes his head. “But things change, Dean.”
Cesar brought the tamales out, and they ate them in the dim light of the porch, Jesse and Dean on the couch and Cesar in an armchair facing them. Cesar insisted on offering Dean more food every time he cleaned his plate, and he was powerless to say no. Wearing Cas’ loose joggers, he didn’t worry so much about his stomach bloating and getting uncomfortable. He rested a hand on it and ate to his heart’s content.
“I trust him to make the right decisions.”
“Yeah, well, I like your clothes, so these are mine now. Sorry.”
“Some of them,” Cas said. “It’s difficult for me to, um, perform.”
Dean sits up and frowns at him. “Forget something?”
“I’m fine,” he lied.
“C’mon, buddy. Bed,” Dean whispered, helping Cas up off the couch.
Winchester Welding – oh, hey, Mr. Novak. What? Did Ash not show up? He did. Is something wrong then? What was that? Just – it wasn’t satisfactory? Did he do anyth– you don’t like his mullet? Your complaint is that you don’t like his mullet. No, no, I understand, sir. Yes, sir. I’m sorry, Mr. Novak. I will be sure to send someone else in the future.
“So that’s how we learned ghosts is real. And, man, did we help some ghosts,” Clint says with a smile at Ida May.
Dean huffs a laugh and keeps eating.
Sam sighs loudly. “Yeah, we have to go to hell. I have to go to the Cage. You wanna call Crowley, see if he can open a door for us somewhere in Oklahoma?”
His mom waves him off. “Oh, Dean, you need to get some sleep. Sam told me everything you’ve been—well, I know you’ve been through a lot. Get some rest, and then we can go.”
“He’s not in the Cage. It’s empty.”
As soon as Charlie’s face breaks into a smile, Dean opens the door wide and pulls her into his arms and holds her so tight that she tells him she can’t breathe. He loosens up just the tiniest bit and presses his lips to the top of her head and keeps them there for several seconds while he cries.
“Do you feel that, Dean?”
“Dean?”
Sam says, “You know, we could ask Chuck. He probably has a firm grasp on reality and could help us out with it.”
“You haven’t listened to it yet?”
“It’s OK, I’m just—” She huffs a sad laugh. “I’m not used to you acting like that. And I guess maybe I’m a little bit fragile after, you know, dying.”
Castiel allowed the first 10 minutes of the film to pass in silence before he asked a plot-related question. Dean answered not just the basic question but included behind-the-scenes trivia and background information about the actors.
Dean huffed a laugh and looked back down at the picture. “Yeah. We fought all the time. You know, we were just too similar. My dad, I mean, I fought with him, too, but that’s because he…”
Dean couldn’t help it; he hugged himself. “Borrowed ‘em from a friend. I kinda like them.”
He manages a weak, “Cas. Get Cas. Please.”
“Sam! Sammy!” Dean shakes him, but Sam doesn’t wake up. Dean desperately looks around the room, searching for anything that will help them or explain what the fuck is going on, but all he finds is gravel and concrete falling from the ceiling. “Charlie!” he yells at the top of his lungs.
Cas moved a hand down the front of Dean’s sweats and teased at his cock.
The white mist grows thicker, but Dean keeps driving. After a few minutes, he feels lightheaded and a little dizzy. On impulse, he shouts, “Amara! Wherever you are, get your ass down here!”
Dean rolls his eyes. “You’re fishing for a compliment.”
Dean nods. “Yeah, I think Mom may have been using Cas as a confidant. Hm. I feel like that’s gonna be weird when Cas comes back as Cas and not, you know, as a tiny lady.”
Dean opened his mouth to say “sure,” but both Crowley and Cas said no at the speed of light. Lexi just laughed as Crowley led her away from them.
Sam occasionally
Eileen came in and offered suggestions, but ultimately Dean ended up with a haircut that could’ve made him the seventh friend on
Someone screams from down in the armory.
Dean waits.
Dean automatically grabs a piece of gauze and soaks up the blood. “Here, I didn’t finish that earlier,” he mutters. He dabs some ointment on Cas’ lip and then fixes a butterfly bandage over it. “There. Good as new.”
“Uh, Cas?” Dean reached up and put his hand on Cas’ wrist. “The hell are you doing?”
If only Castiel knew sign language.
“Why the hell would Cas do this?” Dean asks, distracted.
He’s curious about what’s on it, because he’s sure he made it in his 20s to woo some weekend girl, but he has no memory of this one specifically.
Dean tried to be sneakier after that, doing more videos in the car or in locked storage closets in the bunker, or waiting until everyone had gone to sleep. He had even filmed a video in the goddamn dungeon.
“Amara, what I have with Cas isn’t broken.” He squeezes her again and then pushes her back up so he can look at her. “What did you see in those woods?”
“Got a new Thursday,” Dean replied, typing. “He’s kind of weird.”
Dean just stares at him, open-mouthed, dog still in hand.
“And you’ll promise not to wash the soot off before I come over.”
“He invited me in, Dean. I’m not going anywhere.”
Cas laughs gently on the other end. “I’ll be in touch, Dean. How are things going with your mother?”
“Jesus, how much are we gonna milk her for just so she can hang out with me? Can’t we just tell her to put me in her will?”
to him. She slides her leftovers to him when his plate is empty, and he winks at her in thanks. His appetite back, he feels like he’s catching up on a year or two’s worth of food.
“Wait, the dog sleeps in you guys’ bed?” Sam asks.
As he’s checking the entrance and finding nothing unusual, another, quieter thump sounds from aboveground. He heads outside and scopes out the area, but there’s nothing. It’s raining again.
“It’s nothing, Sam. I’m probably just—getting old.” He gathers Sam’s clothes up in his arms. “Don’t be weird to Cas, OK? He’s still recovering, and he’s probably gonna wake up worried because he fell asleep while trying to, uh, help me. So just don’t be weird about it.”
Of course, he never had to. Dean found him instead.
“Why are we up so early?” Cas asked after taking a drink.
Dean painstakingly takes a knife to the warding. When he comes back down the hill, Cas stops him with a small hand to his shoulder. Dean looks down at him and hates how far his eyes have to travel before they meet Cas’.
Charlie replies, “Has it made him softer around the edges? A little nicer to you?”
So he sat on the couch and threw a blanket over his legs and read a book. The birds were singing outside.
“Sure.”
“No.” He pouted. “Only Tuesday, but it makes the sex really good. And Wednesday kind of hates me but that’s only because they’re in love with me and really mad about it. Aaron just thought I was insane. He only ever wanted to smoke weed and play video games.”
“What? Oh.” Dean self-consciously rubbed his shoulder. “No, uh, kinda sick of being bruised all the time.”
“Come over? Right now? Yes. Please.”
“Yeah. Turns out Amara’s been fucking with me since she was a baby, so joke’s on me I guess.”
“Crowley, I’ve told you…”
“How old? How many?” Dean asks quickly.
Dean nearly dropped his toothbrush in his rush over to the door. “Cas, hey,” he said. “I didn’t know you were here.”
“Is this what you wanted? Is this what you wanted, Dean?” she shouts, her rage filling the empty space of the dungeon.
It’s Amara, barely a year and a half old, unsteadily walking on her chubby legs toward Dean, her arms outstretched and a toothy smile on her face.
“Dean Winchester doesn’t know,” Castiel says simply. “You don’t have to give him any kind of special treatment to convince him that you’re me. In fact, giving him special treatment will make him suspicious.”
“I know. I know it has,” Dean replies. “Every day felt the same, and I just. I don’t know. I couldn’t keep track.”
Charlie says, “You could’ve at least—”
Cas gets too close in Dean’s personal space, hugs him twice in one day, pats his face, even grazes a hand across Dean’s hip when they pass each other in the kitchen. Dean tries his best to ignore it.
Charlie hops up and rummages through Dean’s nightstand. “Where’s your moisturizer? I need some.”
to have this conversation, but their lives are too messed up for him to be surprised.
So he walks purposely to the kitchen and grabs the two six-packs out of the fridge and dumps each bottle into the sink. He then goes to the liquor cabinet in the library and dumps each of those bottles down the drain—until he gets to the last one. He tells himself Sam might want a drink when he gets home, and that’s his excuse for why he puts the last full bottle of Jack back into the cabinet.
The morning meeting at work lasted about 30 minutes, then Castiel stayed behind for his one-on-one with the DON, walking into their office and closing the door behind him, ready to get it over with.
“Jesus, Dean.” Sam frowns at him, and Dean can tell, somehow, that he’s made his brother feel sorry for
“Christ,” Dean said on an exhale. “I thought you couldn’t—that you didn’t feel the same way about me.”
“I got a couple of rooms in the Bellaqua,” Crowley announces as they all gather around the Impala to lick their wounds. “Spend the night, boys.”
She opens her mouth to answer, but she’s interrupted by Sam popping up out of the white emptiness and sprinting by with his gun drawn and blood pouring down the side of his face. He doesn’t seem to notice either of them as he disappears back into the white.
Outside, Cas pushed Dean up against the side of the Impala and slotted a knee between his thighs as he kissed him. Dean slouched back against the car, forcing Cas to hold his weight.
Sam looked toward the kitchen then gestured for Castiel to follow him out the back door. There was another small porch out back, just a slab of concrete and a storage space that jutted out between the houses as a partition between porches.
Dean rolls his eyes and moves his hands to the bottom of the steering wheel. “I’m not having this conversation with you.”
“Right.” Dean uncrosses his arms and leans his hands back against the top of the washer. “He thought I wouldn’t—he thought I wouldn’t fucking notice when he showed up at the bar in a woman’s body. I mean, we were both demons, I could see his, you know, demon self, but he was just so damn stupid. He thought I’d fall for a busty blonde and accidentally sleep with him.”
When he realizes the call is ending, Sam panics and tries to decide which way to go and ends up dancing back and forth in front of Dean’s door before sprinting toward the kitchen.
Cas shakes his head and pushes food around on his plate. “No, but Crowley will come better prepared next time.”
He switched over to text Charlie.
“Simple doesn’t mean easy,” she says. “I can get you the souls. You’ll need the witch to make a bomb.”
They cleared out the rest of the vampires by afternoon of the next day.
“She said she needed time to herself at the bunker, but Charlie and Clint and Ida May were there, too. She just wanted time away from
His dad would hustle pool and bring Dean along with him to the bar, but sometimes John would have too much to drink and gamble too hard and lose all their money.
The delivery was a difficult one, and she wasn’t exactly lucid enough to hold Dean before they took him away. When she woke up, John was sitting in a chair across the room rocking their newborn son in his arms and staring down at him with tears in his eyes. He told her she had been out for six hours.
Jody and Donna excused themselves after a few more minutes, claiming that they had to go to the bar for “ladies’ night.”
“What the hell are you doing to him?” Dean asks, bristling.
Dean:
“Nuh-uh,” Dean said, using the reacher to snatch the bag out of Cas’ hand.
Pati:
Dean is selfish, he knows that, but he supposes he miscalculated this time. If he wanted to have a fucking conversation with Cas, maybe he shouldn’t have stormed off and expected Cas to follow him.
Dean frowned at her. Another rule was that he always used condoms no matter what, so Pati was dreaming if she thought otherwise.
“Dean. There aren’t words,” Cas says when Dean sits across from him at the war room table.
“Mm. It’s weird that I’m older than her.” She bumps her shoulder against Dean’s side. “You don’t see me as a mom figure, do you?”
Mildred faints.
“I’m actually chatting right now with a witch who knows some spells that might help keep Amara chill,” Charlie interrupts. “Don’t worry, it’s an old friend. I trust her.”
“Yes, actually, thank you for asking.” Crowley sighs. “Castiel, I’m so sorry you had to stay in here with your boyfriend. Shall we get back on the road?”
“Night, little baby Dean.”
Dean wants to say thanks, but he’s afraid if he says anything at all then Cas will stop. So he lies there, motionless, as Cas’ grace pours out through his hand and into Dean’s old muscles, until they both fall asleep.
“And Dean was telling me that’s not even your body?”
“Do you remember seeing Billie?” Dean asks.
Well. At least Sam is patient.
Weeks turned into months, and Dean settled in. He sat across from Cas in the kitchen each morning, mostly in silence. He sat across from him in the library, researching cases, mostly in silence. He went on supply runs, Cas in the passenger seat, listening to music. Dean’s affection poured easily from him, in hugs and caresses and gentle words. Cas accepted all with ease.
Dean kept flipping through the pictures as he said, “They got divorced when I was in high school—when my mom found out how my dad was treating me, she kicked him out. I hadn’t seen my dad in almost a year when he...Well, he died in a car accident.” He shook his head. “Fucking drunk.”
When Dean wakes up, something weird is happening.
“Don’t, like, three of your days hate you?”
“Hmm?” Dean whips his head toward her. “Yeah, sorry.”
Dean narrows his eyes at him and raises his gun once again. “Who are you?”
Dean gets to his feet, impulsively stepping toward Chuck and bearing down on him, tears drying on his face. “You’re here because of Amara, right? Surely you have some kind of control over time. Why the hell couldn’t you have gotten here when she was a baby? Before I—before we spent all this time raising her literally as our own! Where were you!”
Hannah showed up next and spent several minutes looking at all the pictures around the house, adjusting every frame on every shelf and occasionally asking who someone was. Then they turned their attention to the books, all of which had the spines facing out now.
Sam replies.
Dean relaxes into the touch, but Cas pulls his hand away too quickly, and Dean has to stop himself from chasing it.
[peach emoji, hammer emoji]
But not doing so turns out to be worth it.
She nods mischievously.
He took him apart gently, using towels and a generous amount of lube—making sure to ask Dean which bottle to use from the nightstand, which nobody ever took the time to ask despite the fact that there were four different types of lube in there—and propping him up with pillows, repeatedly asking him if he was comfortable, then he put a condom on and made love to Dean slowly and carefully, kissing him and touching him and making sure Dean came first.
“Um,” Dean says.
“Go ahead, say it,” Dean grumbled.
“Dean, I think Sam might have a point–”
“OK, first of all,” Charlie started. “I still don’t believe that you
Hannah sat on the couch with her knees up to her chest, eyes glued to the TV. They were thin and pale with big blue eyes and a closely cropped haircut similar in color and style to Castiel’s.
“I want him dead!” Crowley shouts in the background.
“Cas,” Dean mutters into the crook of his arm. “What’re you doing?”
John would also ditch Dean some nights, leaving the bar with a woman on his arm and not a backward glance at Dean. Dean could handle it—he was an adult, after all—but he wished his father had been a more reliable business partner.
“Why? I can’t fuck you every day, Dean.”
“Since I got infected, I’ve been, um, praying. And then I started having visions.”
Cassie:
so I would understand
“What?” Dean yelled as a pot flew at his head, which he easily knocked to the floor.
“For what?”
It took Dean an hour to come, tears in his eyes, and he barely had time to relax before Bela sat on his face.
The woman looks at him, a bored expression in her big blue eyes. “I am,” she says, her voice deeper than expected. “I’m here to help.”
Once he gets a grip, he remembers to grab Cas’ dirty clothes. What he’s not expecting is for Cas to be in the room when he walks in.
After breakfast, they brainstormed what to do with the rest of their day while Dean did the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, and Cas went to the bookshelf and snooped.
“Good,” Dean replies, his head falling back against the seat once more. “I could sit here all day.”
A woman at the pump next to Dean stares at him. He ignores her and gets back in the car. So what if he talks to invisible reapers in public, who cares.
“Hmm.” Cas kept up his ministrations.
“It’s really good.” He flipped over to his stomach and went into a plank, putting the book on the floor in front of him.
“Don’t worry about me, you just—”
Before they had sex, though, Jesse and Cesar sat up on the bed with Dean between them and announced that they had to talk to him about something.
Dean winked at her and nodded.
“What’s the plan, Dean?” Cas shouts.
Dean’s eyes slip shut. He leans into Cas’ touch. “Didn’t want Amara. Wanted you.”
Her eyebrows pinch together. “After everything I’ve done, that’s how you feel? Really, Dean?”
Cas said, “It’s not your fault, Dean.”
“—It closes you off completely to actually developing feelings for anyone.”
“I, uh. Sorry,” Dean stammers. He awkwardly presses his hands to the outside of Cas’ arms. “You’re in this tiny woman’s body. It’s just weird.”
“Why couldn’t it have been me?” Crowley raised his voice. “I deserve to be loved.”
“How are you feeling?”
Dean doesn’t respond, and five seconds later he sees movement in the shadows. He tries not to panic as he wades in his harness, focusing on the
After several long seconds, she pulled away and put a hand to his chest. “I’m sorry, I should’ve told you. You can’t spend the night. My husband’s getting home a day early, and you know how he is.”
“You never seem fully comfortable in them.”
“Dean, I do think I’m going to shower,” he announces, removing his shirt entirely. “I’m going to borrow some clothes from your room.”
There was a familiar knock on the door, so Dean went to go get it. Cas had a scowl on his face and a mug of coffee in one hand. He was wearing one of Dean’s old oversized t-shirts, “IDGAF” in big rainbow type across the chest.
“And…you probably need someone…to…have…what’s the phrase…‘thank God you’re alive’ sex?”
“By this time last night, the baby had woken up crying three times,” he says, leaning against the door jamb and just watching Dean brush his teeth. “She might even sleep through the night. At some point we have to, um, deal with how quickly she’s, you know, aging.”
Dean looks at him with one hand still on his arm and the other on his waist. Cas begins to move back, away from the embrace, but Dean wraps a hand around the back of his neck and pulls him in for a kiss.
“Thanks.” He smiled and put a hand to his belly, resting it on the pocket of the Stanford hoodie. “I’m getting kinda chubby, but Cas likes me cozy, so it’s OK. You look good, too."
Another beat. “Why didn’t you call for Amara? She would’ve been, uh, able to do more.”
Dean looks over at her and waits until she makes eye contact with him. “I’m sorry,” he says. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”
“I don’t know, Sam," he snaps. "I don’t fucking know.”
“Oh. I see.”
Cas angles himself toward Dean and laces their fingers together. They look at each other for a long time. Dean eventually puts a hand to Cas’ cheek and pulls him forward, then he presses a gentle kiss to his forehead. When he’s done, he rests his forehead against Cas’, rubs his thumb across the stubble by his ear, and breathes him in. Cas’ own breath hitches.
“Dean,” Cas says from the kitchen’s threshold.
Dean winks at her. “Thanks, Billie.” He turns to Crowley. “Can you get your mom, please?”
“I’m Dean.”
Castiel sighed and took his empty bowl to the sink.
“Mm. Yeah, I get that,” Dean says. He looks over at Cas, who looks back at him and tilts his new head to the side, furrows his new eyebrows. Dean looks away.
It’s early. The house is dimly lit and quiet, and Dean takes his time changing and feeding Raven. When she’s done with her bottle, he puts her on his hip and carries her out to the back porch to listen to the birds. His phone rings.
The holy oil is in the trunk. Dean has to kill three people before he manages to get to it. As far as he knows, it doesn’t work on people who have gone rabid anyway, so it’s not like he could have saved them even if he had had the time.
That’s his “quit being a dense idiot, Dean” voice.
“Yes, and I am afraid I will never get to–”
Winches– Mr. Novak, Charlie is already on her way. Yes. No. Mr. Nov–please–would–
They stare at each other across the empty space of the kitchen. Dean is leaned back against the counter, his hands white-knuckling it.
Sam follows them through the bunker, and asks over Amara’s screams, “Dean, what the hell is going on?”
Dean thinks he won’t be able to fall asleep with Cas right there, but exhaustion overtakes him and he succumbs to it.
His mind drifted. He thought about Cas, then he thought about Angela. He thought about his siren, about the blonde bartenders, and he felt his body tense with pent up energy.
“She’s my roommate, so yes, I just took her home before coming over here,” Castiel replied. He stayed in the living room and continued carefully tipping books, finding mostly sci-fi and fantasy.
A Wednesday
Dean sighs and sits down on the edge of her bed, then he takes her hand and pulls her over until she sits next to him. He angles toward her and says, “Sweetheart, you’ve been alive less than a month. We have no idea why you’re growing so fast, and we don’t know what you’re capable of doing. I’m sorry we’ve kept you here while you’re growing, but you know you’re, uh, different, right?”
“What?”
“It’s gone, Cas.”
There are more trees, taller grass, bursts of flowers all around them, on the sides of the road and in the median, growing, growing. Sam gives Dean a look like he wants to ask him what that was about, but he knows Dean well enough to keep his mouth shut.
Dean smiled and looked at Cas then back to Mildred. "You decide to ask me that now, right here in front of my handsome boyfriend?"
Cas looked at him with his head slightly tilted, brow furrowed. “You…want me to stay?”
The demons make a fuss but disappear without a fight.
