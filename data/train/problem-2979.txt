Cas stared at Charlie, confused. Had he heard her correctly? Had she said “date?” Had she implied that Dean had referred to him as “the cute guy from the CLCP?” He titled his head, trying to understand what was going on.
However, since he had met Dean, he had started questioning his sexuality again. He was, indubitably, attracted to Dean. But what kind of attraction was it? He wanted to spend time with Dean, to watch movies with him, to go on walks with him, hold his hand, look at the stars at night… He wanted a romantic relationship with him. However, it appeared that Dean was more interested in sex than romance. He made a lot of references to sex, made sex jokes, was always flirting with everyone, was always with a new girl – which meant that he wasn’t looking for anything long-term. Cas hadn’t lied to Meg: as much as he wanted to be with Dean romantically, if the only thing Dean had to offer him was sex… he wouldn’t take it. If they were involved in a real romantic relationship, and if Dean needed sex in such a relationship, then Cas wouldn’t be against it, because he was a little curious about sex (was it really such a big deal?), and he would trust his romantic partner to help him experiment with it. He could also understand that, even though sex wasn’t important for him, it was essential for other people. He wouldn’t deprive his future partner of sex: he was pretty indifferent to it, so from time to time, he guessed it could be a fun activity.
“Though your hair doesn’t look as messy as the first time we met,” Dean smiled, slowly raising a hand again. He stopped himself only centimeters away from Cas’ forehead, silently asking him permission to keep going with his eyes. Cas nodded once, very lightly, not able to look away from Dean’s eyes, which were definitely very close. Five minutes ago, he had thought he could never look at Dean again, and here he was, hypnotized by him. He almost caught his breath, wondering what Dean would do.
Cas didn’t answer. He didn’t know what to say, anyway. Instead, he savored the feeling. He was very touched that Dean would choose to give up his poker night, and the possibility of humiliating his rival in his own home, to spend the evening with him. Well, not exactly, Cas corrected himself. Not to spend the evening with him, but to spend the evening
Cas was already there, scrolling on his phone, wearing a blue dress shirt and jeans. He seemed so human in this outfit and in this position. Cas rarely wore dress shirts when he was hanging out in the bunker, did he dress up especially for Dean? Dean couldn’t help but smile at that thought.
“Very tiring, I’m glad I’m finally home and that I’ll be able to relax this evening. But what are you doing? I thought it was my week to clean?”
The TA gave them back their last assignment. Cas was always anxious before discovering his grades. For this exercise, he knew he had probably done well, but he wasn’t sure of a few answers, and he hadn’t spent too much time on it. He had done it the week before his first meeting for the volunteering program, and he had been anxious about it, not focusing too much on his academic works.
“I had the 8 to 10-year old group, and it was really great. They're at an interesting age, not too young so not too whiny, but not too old so not too annoying – really, two years ago I had the pre-teen group and it was a nightmare!”
Cas’ heartbeat accelerated and he focused on not blushing. Jack looked at him curiously, and Cas shook his head to refocus on his task. It wasn’t the moment to act like a 12-year-old having his first crush on the popular boy at school.
“Okay, hello everyone! My name’s Dean, and here is my partner, Cas. We will be in charge of this group for the entire school year. You can drop off your children by 1:45 pm, but we will only start the activities at 2, until 4. Cas and I would like to offer a little snack at the end of each session; we’ll be getting in touch with the CLCP organization to implement that. Basically, every week we’ll help the children with their homework for about one hour, and then we’ll offer them some activities: sports, creative workshops, board games… We’ll change activities every week so that every kid can do something they enjoy! Of course, we’ll adapt according to the childrens’ preferences. Does anyone have any questions?”
Cas stopped for a second. He had probably never spoken that much in front of an audience before. But who knew, maybe it could help someone else? He wished someone told him all of this when he had started questioning his sexual orientation a few years ago.
And indeed, Dean got caught up in it, enthusiastically commenting on the habits and rituals of the animals described in the first episode. Cas watched his reactions fondly; he had already seen the documentary, anyway. And he was tired. So tired. And watching documentaries always relaxed him, and Dean was also making him relaxed, and he fell asleep without even noticing it.
Dean made three steps in his direction, looking at the cooking book Cas was reading, now half covered in dough.
“What were you doing with Dean Winchester?” Balthazar exclaimed, as he got up on the couch, his interest piqued. “You know him?”
Ultimately, Dean ended up joining him in eating the cookies, and it was great. Cas commented according to his preferences, and Dean explained the differences between each recipe.
It was nice to see he could count on his friend. However, after everything, he just wanted to be alone. He had a lot to process.
She shrugged. “Yeah, but I don’t know. We went out for drinks twice, and I went to watch his game Saturday, and… I guess he’s not too boring?” She seemed visibly uncomfortable.
“Until now, I was the cool adult, and you were the too-serious one… Now that you’ve entered the competition to be the funnier one, I’m afraid you’re gonna be their favorite!”
But as the days went by, he began to set his mind on not going. It seemed to be more trouble to him than anything: it was a new situation where he had to be social with strangers and talk about unknown feelings that didn’t exactly make him comfortable in the first place. The benefit of maybe meeting other ace people didn't seem worth it. Especially when only 1% of the population was asexual, according to Cas' research. He didn't know how many students were members of that society, but statistically, the odds of seeing other aces seemed pretty low.
“Sounds date enough for me,” Balthazar shrugged. “I’m not a big fan of sports, but I can definitely give you some advice. Do you mind if we move to your room so I can take a look at your wardrobe?”
After grabbing his plate - a pasta salad, which he judged he could eat without reheating it - he awkwardly sat down on the table facing Cas, who was still silently scrutinizing him. After two bites, Dean finally put his fork down.
“I don’t need him to “take care” of me!” Cas exclaimed. “I already told you, I’m not interested in sex. And you said yourself that Dean was not the kind of guy to date the same person more than three times. We’re not looking for the same thing!”
He reached out to put the scarf around Cas' neck. He held both sides of the scarf in his hands for a few moments, encircling Cas, standing just inches away from him, in a gesture that Cas perceived as extremely intimate. It was as if time had stopped, and the two of them settled into a comfortable silence, smiling softly in the dark, paying no attention to the commotion outside the car as the students rushed into the arena.
“Okay. And he… He often goes back with girls, after parties like that?” Cas asked in a strangled voice. He didn’t even realize he was on the verge of tears; he didn’t even know why. He shouldn’t be that affected by the idea of Dean sleeping with another girl. But it was probably the addition of several factors: the newness of the situation – going to a bar for the first time! – the fact that he, an introvert, had to socialize for two hours, the tiredness he had accumulated over the week, and of course, Dean.
“Let me recap: you find Dean handsome. Yet, if tonight he knocks at your door and offers you to spend the night with him, you say no?”
Dean came back with a chocolate cookie - Cas' favorite, Dean had remembered! - still warm. He froze for a moment when he saw Cas' choice, before bursting into laughter.
Dean followed all of Sam’s instructions. He drank some water and slept a few hours in his car to sober up. Then, when he woke up around 5, feeling better, he looked at the list of stores opened 24 hours a day, opened on Christmas in the area. By chance, there was one on his way between the bar and the bunker, 40 minutes away from where he was. Of course, the convenience store he found didn’t have all the things he wanted, but it was still better than nothing. Seeing the ugly Christmas sweater the cashier was wearing, Dean got a pinch in his heart. He remembered how Cas had looked at the sweaters at Walmart, and regretted not buying him one. It was too late, now. He actually couldn’t find any gifts in the small shop. And he really needed to wrap something. He texted Sam at 6. His brother just woke up.
“It’s fine, I didn’t expect to fall asleep. I guess I just had a very exhausting week! I would have had to wake up to eat at some point anyway.”
Cas followed him silently, looking all around him. The paint on the walls was peeling, but many children’s drawings were hung up and gave a cheerful touch to the building. They reached the kitchen and Dean switched on the light, before putting the pies in the fridge.
“A-? And I only got a C+? But we compared our homework before handing them in!” Meg protested, grabbing Cas’ assignment before he could even take a look at it.
Dean noticed his phone screen had turned to black; it had gone into power-saving mode because he hadn’t touched the screen for a few minutes. Dean sighed loudly. He needed a beer. Or two. He let his phone fall from his hand to the bed and left his room. He could deal with this later. Or just...never open his phone again. That was a good option, too.
Cas suddenly felt someone grip his shoulder. He almost jumped and quickly turned his head in the direction of the person who was touching him.
Dean looked at him, a little bit confused by the change in Cas’ behaviour. “Uh, yeah, of course… I’ll pick you up at 1, like usual.”
“Really? Well, today’s your lucky day. If you want, I can teach you. You know, to make up for potentially causing you a head injury!”
“I only behave this way because that’s how people expect me to behave. I thought everyone was pretending, too? And that all the sex jokes weren’t serious? I heard the end of Stevie’s presentation about… asexuality today, and… I’ve never heard about that before. About the difference between romantic attraction and sexual attraction, I didn’t even know sexual attraction was really a thing? I’m not saying that I’m… like you, I never thought about it…. And clearly, I’m pretty curious about sex, and I definitely want to try at some point, because everyone seems to think that it’s great… And if I had to choose someone to try it with, it would be you, Cas… I hope this doesn’t freak you out, but you’re actually the first person I’ve actually thought about having sex with… I’ve never felt this way before, and…”
“That’s the only thing Raphael deserves,” Dean replied. “I’m actually glad I’m able to tell you a few things about him,” he said, more seriously.
“Or I don’t have to learn how to bake, of course! You could use our kitchen and I’ll go elsewhere! The living-room! My room! I won’t bother you! I could…”
Cas was abruptly brought back to reality, and his heart tightened. He tried not to look too disappointed. The barista was very beautiful, and she and Dean seemed to get along well. They were probably dating, or would be soon, given how flirty they were. Cas shouldn’t be that disappointed. He barely knew Dean, after all, and it was not as if he would have had any chance with him anyway. Dean probably wasn’t even gay, and he seemed to be so confident, he probably had a lot of experience in relationships. Cas was shy, socially awkward, and he had never had a boyfriend before. Besides, flirty guys like Dean were usually guys who liked to have one-night stands, or even to have sex at all. Cas was not like that. Sure, he would like to have a boyfriend, a cute and nice boy who he could talk to and do romantic things with, like stargazing, going for walks, holding hands, drinking tea, and having cozy dates. He was craving romantic interactions like that, but it obviously wasn't the kind of thing he could expect from Dean. Especially with that sentence about Cas being able to be ruffled
“Balt, I swear I’m perfectly happy with how my life is right now. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I still have some readings to do for Wednesday.”
“8 to 10-year olds seem good to me," he agreed. “And for the time…Not too early on Saturday morning, I assume?”
“No, really, I don’t think you can imagine the extent to which I’m anxious. It’s really something that impacts my life… a lot. It makes everyday life so much harder, because I constantly worry about everything. In a very unhealthy way. Even when I know I shouldn’t be worrying, that I have no rational reason to be afraid, I just… can’t control my mind, or my thoughts.”
“No, I did it on my own. When I was working at the Gas-n-Sip, one of my coworkers gave me the name of the app. She said it could help me to…”
After a quick trip to his room to grab some clean clothes, he headed to the bathroom, feeling lighter now that he had decided to do something about the situation. The bunker was quiet, Sam and Cas were often in the library this time of day (well, when Cas wasn't with Dean).
He slept until late the next day, and honestly, he needed it. He was not ready to face Dean, but he had no choice. He needed to be professional, for the children at least, who had nothing to do with that situation.
The next day, Cas’ alarm woke him up. He would have woken up before it was time for him to leave for the meeting, anyway, but he didn’t want to risk it. He had set the alarm for pretty late, 11 am, so that he wouldn’t have to spend the morning worrying. He had had insomnia throughout the week and had fallen asleep pretty late last night, the image of Dean’s eyes ingrained in his mind, keeping him awake for hours.
“I had to pick up some parts for the Impala. Old stuff that you can't find just anywhere, I had to drive six hours to get them in a garage I found on the internet,” Dean lied.
“Sorry Ben, all good things must come to an end! But we'll see you next week, so don't forget to bring your school stuff and homework! Otherwise, Cas won’t be happy!” He winked, giving Cas a sidelong glance.
“Oh, a grammar exercise? Well, maybe you should ask Cas for that, I’m more of a scientific person, Jack,” Dean said, after leaning over the little boy’s notebook to check what he had to do.
“Perfect. I wrote that down. Same place as last year, Dean, I’ll trust you to show Castiel where the building is?”
“I don’t know, but like… The way you are with the children. You’re so caring, looking after them, being patient, thoughtful, kind… And even in general, I don’t know you that well yet, but… You always want to do things the best that you can, and make things right… I can totally picture you as a doctor, helping people. Children, maybe? Did you already think about a medical specialty?”
Dean was tired of thinking. The guy seemed friendly. He was here with two girls and a man who were looking at him, expectantly.
Flashbacks of his meeting with Dean suddenly filled his mind and he closed his eyes for a few moments, reliving the scenes from the day before. He smiled, content. He felt good today. He was in a good mood, fully rested, ready to face the day. He got up and went to the kitchen, deciding to get some breakfast before anxiety could overtake him and prevent him from eating.
“Well, you’re obviously way more sophisticated than him. I’m sure you deserve better friends than Dean Winchester,” he said with disdain.
Cas was ready for it. He had never had a boyfriend, never kissed anyone, never even held hands with someone else. And he wouldn’t initiate anything himself, of course. But if Dean tried to make a move… Cas wouldn’t reject him (well, depending on what kind of move, of course). Cas actually expected something to happen. Because he couldn’t have imagined the romantic attraction he felt between them, could he? Something was there, he was almost sure of that. And he would soon have the confirmation since Dean had just rung the doorbell.
“Dean, Dean… It’s even better! It’s perfect! It’s better than any Christmas movie, because it is real”.
“Um, not really. He was going with his friends first, but invited me to join them because we’re organizing a basketball game with the kids we’re tutoring next Saturday. So yeah, it is more an out-of-convenience offer…”
Cas decided that copying Jody’s slides down in his notebook was the best way to stay focused on what she was saying, and that carefully looking at the board would prevent him from sneaking glances at Dean. He couldn’t believe this was happening. That the gorgeous boy that almost
Cas liked overthinking and overanalyzing past and future situations, and their afternoon gave him plenty to consider. Dean had kept acting flirty with him, but maybe it had been too much. Like, he wasn’t subtle enough to be serious. It only confirmed what Cas already thought – and, to be honest, feared – Dean hadn't really been flirting with him. He had been only joking around, because he was a very social person who liked to tease others. Cas had seen him interact with that girl, Lisa, at the poker night; he had even thought she was Dean’s girlfriend back then. He had also seen him flirting with Jo, the barista, planning a date with her at his place. Two conclusions could be drawn: Dean was obviously straight, and he liked flirting. Well… was he only straight? Maybe he was bi? Cas hadn’t seen him flirting with any other guys, but he hadn’t really seen him in situations where he could have been. He considered asking Balthazar about it, but then his roommate would definitely know that he had a crush on Dean, which wasn’t something advisable. If he told Balthazar he was serious and didn’t want him to tell Dean, he was almost sure his friend would respect his choice, but Balthazar knew Dean, and perhaps unintentionally the information might slip, because of alcohol for example. Telling Balthazar was way too risky. Besides… The likelihood that Dean could be interested in Cas in return was so low that it was ridiculous to even think it would be possible. Balthazar would laugh at him, or worse, pity him. He could definitely not tell him.
He didn’t know. He had no idea. He didn’t want to think! Though the choice wasn’t so crucial, so he heard himself answering “hot chocolate.”
Still, he wasn’t against the idea of having sex someday; he also found boys good-looking. And he wanted to be in a relationship. And in a relationship, at some point partners usually made love. So one day, he would be in a relationship, and he would probably have sex with his partner, because, that’s what he was supposed to do. Not now, but in the future. And sometimes, he even masturbated, which was a very sex-related thing to do. So he definitely couldn’t be asexual, right?
Cas squinted, and Dean gave him a questioning look. Cas just smiled, and Dean smiled back, and they stayed like that, settling into a comfortable silence, for a while. Until Cas’ stomach started gurgling, breaking the moment.
“Anyway, it was nice meeting you guys, but we have class in 15 minutes, we should probably get going.”
Dean shrugged. “I just like seeing you so invested in the show. You’re not even pointing out  every medical inconsistency anymore, who would have guessed that?”
“And I can’t wait to teach you how to bake,” Dean winked. And that wink almost finished Cas. He was feeling overwhelmed, and his heart was beating fast, but overall he was feeling so good, so great, better than ever. Dean looked adorable; Cas could already picture the two of them in his kitchen, and suddenly he wished it was already Friday. Dean was so soft, so kind, so caring. And suddenly, the fact that he liked partying, and having one-night stands, and everything else, everything that was holding Cas back until that moment, didn’t seem to matter anymore.
It was a very simple scene, and yet Cas felt privileged to have been able to witness it. Dean's life seemed so easy, so joyful, he seemed to enjoy it so much... It was a thousand miles away from his own life. His own life was complicated because he made it complicated; because he was introverted, anxious, afraid of everything, and withdrawn. He would be lucky if Dean would agree to even be his friend. And that would be enough for him. He would take whatever Dean could give him - and his friendship would be a lot. Obviously, nothing would ever happen between him and Dean. It was ridiculous for him to even imagine for one second that Dean could be interested in him in a romantic way. They were incompatible, radically different. And Cas shouldn't expect anything; otherwise, he would inevitably be disappointed, and that wouldn't be good for either him or Dean.
“Stop that, now, Meg!” Cas told her, starting to get anxious that Dean would hear them. The coffee shop wasn’t that big, and there weren’t a lot of customers, and Meg was talking loudly… However, she kept going, provocatively wiggling her eyebrows.
In situations like this, he liked talking to himself out loud. It helped him to process his thoughts and break the heavy silence.
Cas’ smile didn’t leave his lips for the rest of the evening. He might look a little bit silly, but he didn’t mind. He was happy.
“Dean. I know that humans have sex. Want to have sex, like to have sex. You keep talking about it, yourself. And apparently, it seems that my vessel is broken or something. Maybe something happened when Metatron took my grace. Maybe graceless angels can’t experience sexual attraction, I don’t know, but I know it’s not normal, and that it’s something very important to humans. And now, I’m not an angel anymore, but I don’t feel like a real human, either.”
Cas shook his head. No, no, he couldn't start thinking like that, it was dangerous. He was already completely falling for Dean, he didn't need to start imagining things, and having hopes that would inevitably disappoint him in the long run.
"Oh, you mean Castiel? Yes, of course, do you know him? I mean, there aren't many of us around, so I guess we've all run across the same profiles, so it's not too surprising. He's hot, isn't he? A little weird, though. The way he talks... Anyway, we had a very interesting conversation. The guy is pretty…straightforward about certain topics, yet he doesn’t seem to have much experience? Which is strange, I have to say. With such a dreamy look on his face, to be so inexperienced with sex at 45? I’m sure the guy could get whoever he wants!”
The hunter didn’t answer and just started the car. The drive back home was completely silent, Cas taking a few looks at Dean, trying to figure out what he’d done wrong.
Cas turned away to face Dean, but looked down immediately when he crossed his gaze, blushing a little, embarrassed.
“The fact that you were at a party yesterday is definitely not a good excuse,” said Jody jokingly before Dean could say anything.
Dean shook his head and smiled. "Poker nights happen every month. Evenings with you are a lot rarer, though. So when you suggested it, I couldn’t let the opportunity slip by!"
him? At least, it was a possibility. A new hopeful sensation started to slowly grow into Dean’s chest.
Dean put a reassuring hand on his shoulder and Cas’ heart skipped a beat. "Hey, it's okay, Cas, calm down. I was just kidding! But I'll take your word for it, and if next time we end up having a full meal instead of coffees…well, too bad for you!”
“And you should definitely take advantage of that to show who you are! Don’t wear something that you think people want you to wear, but something you like to wear.”
“So we have the peanut butter ones, the almond ones, and, your favorite, the chocolate ones, right?” Dean summed up, once they had tasted all the cookies.
He met Cas’ distraught gaze, and was torn between the need to go and comfort him and the intense feeling of shame and guilt that overwhelmed him. Sam threw him an irritated look, and Dean decided to retreat. The damage was done,  and Cas was not alone. Sam seemed to be in control of the situation, anyway.
Cas looked around, uncomfortable. Most of the children had stopped pretending to do their homework and were looking at them with curiosity.
“Not yet, at least. Dean’s not the kind of guy who sticks with the same girl for more than three dates, anyway. And Cassie is new. Last week, he was still hanging out with Lisa a lot…”
DEAN: “I am still out, but I’m on my way back to the bunker. I’ll meet you in the Dean Cave in 15 minutes”
Cas rolled his eyes, but laughed anyway. The good old Dean he knew was back. He never stayed emotional for too long – but Cas appreciated the fact he had told him he noticed his change. He realized it too, but it was always nice to hear it from someone else. Once the dishes were done and the room was cleaned, they gathered their belongings and got into Dean's car to drive back to campus.
For asexuality, it was different. He didn’t know any other asexuals in real life. And it seemed way more complicated than being gay. He knew for a fact that he preferred boys to girls, he never had any doubt about that. But was he experiencing sexual attraction? How could he know that? If he never experienced it, how could he know if he didn’t? Sure, sometimes he felt horny and masturbated. It was actually great stress and anxiety relief, and it felt good. But he couldn’t identify what made him “horny”. He never felt the urge to masturbate in reaction to seeing a “hot” guy, even half-naked in a movie. He never really watched porn; he didn’t see the appeal of it. And even with the guys he had crushes on, he never pictured himself having sex with them, never wanted to.
Dean waved at him, and Cas watched his car disappear around the corner before going inside his house. He was feeling better than ever. He couldn’t even panic about the “friendly-date” that was coming – for now, he was just happy thinking about it. Of course, he needed to remember that it was definitely not a romantic date, that Dean wasn’t interested in him like that, and that even if he was, he would probably only want sex – something that Cas couldn’t give to him, not if they weren’t in a real romantic relationship, at least.
He was surprised he dared to ask the question. A few weeks ago, he would just have been shy and would have waited quietly, hoping that Charlie forgot about it. And now here he was, initiating a conversation!
Raphael was a political science student and Cas was actually having a very interesting conversation with him, when someone tapped on his shoulder. It could only be one person.
By five, he was back at home and was pacing in the corridor, thinking about the “non-date.” If Dean was interested in him, maybe he would make a move that night? The setting would be intimate: the kitchen wasn’t really big, and they might
Dean was still laughing, and hadn't realized that Cas was lost in his thoughts, so Cas decided to pull himself together, to not give Dean the opportunity to see him being pensive.
He was glad to go to the next meeting of the LGBT+ society, the next day. These days, he was questioning himself more and more about his sexuality. He was realizing, even though he wasn’t really surprised, that falling in love with Dean hadn’t changed the kind of attraction he was experiencing, which meant that apparently he wasn’t demisexual. That being said, he wasn’t in a real relationship with Dean. They were close emotionally, but not physically. But of course, they would never be more than that, so Cas would never find out how his attraction would change in the context of a relationship. Not with Dean, at least. Which was fine. He knew it from the beginning. And they were definitely not going on a date next Friday. Of course not.
“We’ll take my car! I rarely get a chance to use her since I live on campus, so I’m happy to be able to take a ride with her. I’m sure you’re gonna like her."
The next week seemed very long, but short at the same time. Cas was very excited for the not-a-date basketball game with Dean (and his friends! Because it was not a date, but only a friendly activity with friends!), but the closer the day came, the more anxious he got about it. He tried to calm down by thinking that he had nothing to worry about, since it was not a date. But even as a purely friendly activity, it was still very out of his comfort zone. A few months ago, he would have been tempted to just cancel. However, over the past few weeks, he had tried to go out of his comfort zone, and it had actually worked. He had never regretted it (except maybe that evening at the bar, where Dean had been so weird and so horny – but it had also led him to decide to join the LGBT+ society, which had been a good thing, so, in the end, maybe that party hadn’t been that bad, after all). Besides, the excitement overrode the apprehension he was feeling, which was also a new feeling.
Of course. Dean wasn’t here to see him, but Balthazar. Why would have he come, otherwise? If he needed to say something to Cas about the program, he would have texted him, not driven to his place. Cas tried to not be disappointed. He had hoped for a few seconds, when he opened the door and saw Dean, that maybe he had come to see him, to talk to him, spend time with him, or even – let him dream a little bit! – ask him on a date. What a ridiculous idea! Why would he do such a thing?
Dean dragged them to Café-in, one of the coffee shops on the campus. They said nothing while they were in line. Cas tried to calm down by pretending to read the menu – even though this was one of his favorite coffee shops and he already knew what he was going to order. He couldn’t believe what was happening. He was going to have coffee with Dean. It was the closest thing to a date he had ever had. And it was with this gorgeous guy. Maybe the other customers would even think that they were having a date. Wow!
“Good,” Cas said. He went to the doorway, staying there watching Dean run to his car, open the door, and lean in to retrieve the case. Cas had a perfect view of the guy’s butt, and he couldn’t help but think about what Meg had said a few days before: “
He winked again, and clearly, Cas had never met anyone who winked that much before. He ignored Dean’s comment, not knowing what to answer.
With a nonchalant step, Dean moved to the fridge, opening it and scanning it for his plate under Cas' piercing gaze. Was the former angel planning to stand there and watch him eat his entire meal?
Cas chuckled, while applying the band-aid on Jack’s knee. “Okay Jack, it’s all clear! You can roll your pant leg back down.”
“Um, he’s uh… He’s not in a relationship, no. I didn’t even know he was in the dating game before yesterday,” he heard himself answering.
Time flew by very quickly. Each time a batch was baking, Dean would prepare the dough for the next batch, being unexpectedly organized about the process – he was probably used to it. After putting the third – and final – batch in the oven, Dean turned to Cas.
Cas shook her hand. “Castiel Novak. I’m a third-year biology student, it’s my first time volunteering."
He went to his room, where he had put the eight bottles he had bought – orange juice, apple juice, lemonade, and soda – and took a picture that he joined to the message. He smiled, feeling that this answer was appropriate, and pressed “send".
They didn’t talk much during the ride. Dean had put some rock music on, and he was beating out the rhythm of the song with his fingers on the wheel. He looked happy, and Cas was happy to see him that way. Soon, Dean parked the car.
As soon as Baby was parked in the garage, he rushed out of the car to practically run to the Dean Cave.
Dean was really great with children. He was nice and caring with everyone, but with children, those qualities were even more obvious. He always took time to answer the kids, even when he was busy with something else, in a very patient way. Cas always felt warm and filled with tenderness when he watched him interact with the children.
Everything was great, really. Cas was feeling really comfortable and he was having a good time. They were talking, mainly about the cookies, but also sharing some stories with each other. It was fun. It was nice. However, it was just… friendly. And nothing more. No flirting AT ALL. Not even a wink.
Cas glanced down at his outfit. There was nothing out of the ordinary about it. He wondered if Dean was teasing, but he looked pretty serious – as much as Dean could be serious. As if he was really complimenting him. Cas looked up, uncertain.
A warm hand rested gently on his shoulder, and Cas jumped, raising his head abruptly, banging it violently against the door.
"You're not?" Cas asked, astonished. He had expected Dean to try to meet his friends from the poker circle later in the evening, to at least play a game or two with them.
It turned out that the first “Doctor Sexy binge-watching night” was the first of many. Cas didn’t expect to like the show; in the beginning, he agreed because it allowed him to spend more time with Dean, and because Dean was so excited about it, and Cas loved seeing him like that, enthusiastic and happy. However, he quickly got caught up in the show, and even though he still pointed out every medical error – which made Dean roll his eyes “that’s not the main point of the show Cas!” – he had to admit that it was pretty addictive, and soon he looked forward to those watch nights not only for Dean, but also to discover what would happen to the characters.
Cas nodded and opened the door, delighted with the change of subject. Dean followed him into the living room.
There was something about him, about the way he had looked at him, deeply, as if he was trying to read through him to understand the things Cas wasn’t saying. The way he had seemed to be genuinely worried that he had caused Cas to hit his head. The way he had spontaneously reached out to Cas, as if he cared about him and his well-being, even though he didn’t know him. The way he had offered to go and grab him some pizza from the living room. There was something really soft about him. But, on the other hand, he also looked like a confident guy, in control of the situation – or trying to be in the control of the situation anyway – joking with Balthazar, and even flirting with him?
And Dean wasn’t answering. Of course he wasn’t. He was probably too busy laughing at that text, or worse, analyzing it to understand why Cas wrote that. He was probably trying to find a way to say politely that Cas wasn’t his mother and should mind his own business. Cas was mortified. He would be so embarrassed the next day, there’s no way he would be able to look at Dean after sending that text! He switched off the TV, not in the mood to watch it anymore. He was going to go to bed and to hide himself under his pillow until the next day, hoping Dean would forget his text in the meantime, and…
They entered the building. Dean slowed down, but was still holding Cas’ hand. He scanned the room, looking for his friends, before suddenly striding again, dragging Cas behind him. He climbed some stairs, before stopping. A big guy stood up and waved at them.
Dean shrugged. “Nothing. You’re just… Not like usual, today. It’s nice to see you so passionate about it. You seem more relaxed, less worried. Which is good, of course!”
It was also Dean who had been helping Cas to shave, two times a week. Cas was uncomfortable whenever a sharp object was near his throat, the flashback of Metatron taking away his grace haunting him, but for some reason, he trusted Dean enough to let him do it. He had tried it himself once, a few days after becoming human, but he was clumsy, not yet mastering his hands well, and he had cut himself under the chin. Blood had beaded and rolled down his throat, and Cas had let out a little cry, letting the razor slip. Dean, who was busy running a machine in the laundry room right next to the bathroom, had rushed over. Seeing Cas so vulnerable, so lost, had come as a shock to him, and he had decided that from now on, he would help Cas for as long as necessary. As he was taking care of Cas’ cut, murmuring soothing words to calm him down, he had promised him he would stay with him and help him to learn how to shave from now on, so that Cas wouldn’t be in a similar situation again. Except that now, the very idea of standing so close to Cas seemed impossible.
“That’s so Dean of you, Dean. By the time you get your diploma, half of the university will have visited your dorm!” she joked.
Focusing on the cards and their meanings and memorizing all the combinations wasn’t easy when Dean was so close to him.
What was he going to wear? He usually wore shirts, but nice shirts, and maybe he would appear snobby if he came wearing an expensive shirt, and people would hate him…This was a volunteer program to help poor families. He shouldn't look too rich, otherwise people would wonder what he was doing there…Poor people hated rich people like his family, and maybe they would think he was there to brag, to show how rich he was and how much better than them he was…And that was it, he was sure that everybody would hate him. Why had he signed up for this program in the first place? It was definitely a stupid idea. The stupidest idea he had ever had, probably. Why did he decide to inflict that on himself when no one had forced him? However, today wasn’t a proper volunteer session with children; it was only a meeting, so was it more formal? No one would come to a formal meeting underdressed. He would look as if he was being disrespectful or didn’t care about the program if he wore clothes that were too casual. In general, it was better to be overdressed than underdressed, wasn’t it? People didn’t know him; it was his first and only chance to make a good impression. The way he would be dressed today would probably determine what the other volunteers would think about him and how his volunteer experience would go for the entire year. The stakes were high. And he only had one hour to decide before he had to leave. What should he do?
A little more hesitantly than he had for the two previous items, he took out another blue and red scarf. Cas' heart melted - and so did his brain. In the darkness, Dean, a little shy, looked adorable. Absolutely adorable. And he had thought about him. He had thought about him! He was so caring and so nice, and so… So Dean!
Dean had done a great job at reassuring him last week, but now that it was getting closer, Cas was starting to worry again. What if he couldn’t handle the kids? What if they didn’t like him? His negative thoughts started to accumulate, and soon he wasn’t paying attention to the bees on the screen anymore. So many things could go wrong! What if one of the kids got injured? What if two of the kids fought with each other? How would he react? What was he supposed to do? Why didn’t Jody and Donna provide a complete training to all the volunteers? What if…
“Okay, Benny texted me, my friends are already here, and they saved seats for us. That’s good, because I think we're gonna be right on time,” he said, looking at his watch.
“Yes, I am. But don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll find plenty of other ladies to keep you company, I won’t be missed!”
He hated it when he got like that. The day had started fine, why did he have to ruin it like that? He was mad at himself.
Cas already read that list, while researching the society before coming to the meeting, but he didn’t mention it and simply nodded.
“And you liked other people’s profiles, and talked to strangers?” Dean continued, in a more confident, almost accusatory tone.
Cas almost blurted “Why?" but instead, he looked away. Dean always looked at him right in the eyes, with his deep green, intense gaze, and it made him very weak.
He managed to focus enough on his classes and various assignments to forget about Dean until Friday. On Wednesday, he met Meg in class, but she didn’t tell him anything about her date. Cas preferred to not ask. He was curious, because he had never seen her act like that before, but he didn’t want to be too intrusive. It was already a big step that Meg had mentioned that soccer player on Monday. She would tell him more about it when she was ready.
Preparing for the “non-date” was fun. More fun than Cas expected. He would have thought he’d be paralyzed with anxiety, but the anticipation and the excitement supplanted the worries. He was still worrying and overanalyzing, of course. But it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. Besides, he trusted Dean and he knew things couldn’t completely go wrong. Even if he didn’t know Dean’s friends. If they didn’t like him, well… it was their loss. And if he didn’t like them… at least he would be with Dean. He was going to be with Dean – and to learn basketball rules, he tried to remind himself – not to make new friends, after all. Plus, they would all be watching the game. He wouldn’t have to struggle to make conversation with strangers. He could just say something about the game. He was a little more afraid about the dining part before the game, but the group would probably all talk together and maybe not even notice him.
Apparently, Cas had sex with this reaper, April. Did he like it? Was that why he used this dating app to find another partner? Did he not like it? Was it why he was looking for a man, and not a woman? And before he was human? Dean had tried to encourage him to flirt with girls, offered to be his wingman on many occasions. If Cas was gay, maybe that was why he never answered enthusiastically to Dean’s suggestions? Eventually, Dean had given up, and he had stopped trying to set Cas up with girls. He had thought that, probably, Cas was just above this, above human, physical, carnal, prosaic relationships, and that it was why there was no way that Cas and him… could be together. Not like Dean intended, of course. That was why Dean never listened to himself all those times he thought that Cas was adorable, brave, kind, and hot. He was out of reach because he was an angel and he probably couldn’t feel the way humans feel, couldn’t love the way humans love…
This was nice of him. Even drunk, with a girl clinging to him, Dean found a way to think about him. However, Cas was too disappointed and even angry to be pleased about it.
A flash of panic passed through Castiel's eyes, very briefly, but Charlie probably saw it, because she quickly added: "But of course you don't have to. No pressure. You can just keep listening. But just know that if you want to express yourself... Here is a safe place to do it. No one is going to judge you. We've all been there, we all know it's not easy to start opening up when you're new. But you'll see, the hardest thing is to begin, and once you've talked once, it'll be easier the next time. And I'm sure you'll soon find out that you can trust us here. We are all in the same boat, and we are here to help each other.”
He closed the door and dropped onto the bed. Wow. That had been really awkward. Even Cas, who wasn’t the best at picking up on social cues, probably realized something was up. It was Dean’s fault, after all: he shouldn’t have risked leaving his room if he wasn’t able to look him in the eyes. The guy was living there, after all. And Dean would undoubtedly walk in on him again, sooner or later. It’s not as if he could permanently avoid him. Dean shifted on the bed and winced when his back hit something. He patted the mattress underneath him to find the object that had hurt him: his phone. Obviously. How could he have forgotten it? He unlocked it mechanically to discover Cas' photo and profile on the still-open application. His piercing blue eyes seemed to be looking directly at him - which, in fact, was the case, since Dean had taken the photo. Sighing, Dean pressed the button to turn off the screen. Suddenly very tired, he decided that he could deal with all this later.
Cas still felt a little perplexed. Of course, Raphael didn’t seem like an angel; he definitely had sounded snobbish. Yet, Cas didn’t have the impression that he was as bad as Dean was depicting him to be.
Cas’ eyes widened as Dean talked. It meant that he wasn’t angry or disappointed. He still cared about Cas. He was still worried about him. Maybe he hadn't ruined everything in the end?
Dean grabbed the remote to pause the episode, stirred and glanced at Cas, who was still curled against him – somehow their proximity hadn’t shocked Balthazar when he had arrived, probably because he was used to seeing them together now.
It was Dean who, every night, would make a point of preparing Cas a different dish to find out what flavors he liked and then suggest a movie to help him perfect his knowledge of pop culture.
The cold of the outside stroke him. But it was actually feeling kind of good. He breathed, feeling miserable. And he perfectly knew he was the only one responsible for that. He finally walked to Baby, put some music on and closed his eyes. He didn’t even notice he was silently crying.
“It is not easy to describe. But I was…very confused and disoriented. All those new sensations…it was overwhelming.”
Which was true, and there was no point in Dean denying it, so he preferred to remain silent. This lack of response surprised Cas, and the two men stared at each other for a long time, before Cas finally started again.
“Yeah, but I’ve never been able to prepare one entirely on my own, though. I’m too muddled for that, I get too enthusiastic and lose track too quickly. You, on the other hand, have this very rational and logical spirit.”
Lucy, 25, 5 km away. Cute, but too young. Swipe left. Will, 41, 45 km away. Handsome, but too far away. Swipe left. Tom, 39, 10 km away? Why not, swipe right. Lisa, 35, 15 km away. Pretty, but another Lisa? Swipe left. Castiel, 45, less than 1 km away. Swipe... Wait. Castiel. 45. Less than 1 km away?
“Dean, that’s not about you! It’s about Cas! The most important is that he’s happy! And if you can be happy at the same time, it’s even better! You need to talk to him, Dean, the two of you are just miserable separately when you could be so happy together!”
Dean frowned. Too bothered by the fact he was seeing Cas just after finding his profile on a dating app, he didn’t even question the fact that his now human friend was awake at 3 am. If Cas was waking up in the middle of the night, as he just told Dean, it probably meant he was having nightmares. Dean wasn’t surprised about it, but of course he would have preferred for Cas to not have to experience that. Getting used to a "classic" human life was probably enough of a challenge for the ex-angel, he should not have to deal with the more negative aspects of being human in addition to it.
“Oh yes, Cas, I really like picking you up…” Dean said suggestively, without even trying to be subtle.
Cas instantly switched back to “professional mode”, a little bit embarrassed to have been caught joking with Dean by a parent.
Cas nodded, still very dazed. He didn’t want to think. If Dean was here, taking care of him… Did it mean that he was okay with what Cas had said? Or that he hadn’t heard him? Maybe he didn’t understand that Cas had meant him? He shut down his thoughts, focusing on the hot water that was running on his shoulders. Once he was done, he put on comfy clothes and breathed, trying to prepare himself to face Dean.
“I don't know, why not? I never tried attending that kind of gathering. Can't say I don't like it if I never tried! I'll probably decide not to go, though,” Cas shrugged.
“So, I see that I only need to introduce you to Garth, who is over there,” Dean started. “Since apparently, you already know Charlie…”
“Well, it seems like you really needed those,” said a man behind his back. Dean almost jumped. How cliché was this? Was he really going to talk about his feelings with a random stranger at a bar? He shrugged.
As if it wouldn’t be okay for Cas to arrive early! “Perfect. Thanks again for the information, for the ride, and for the tea.”
Nevertheless, when he noticed that Cas had frozen and was looking serious, Dean’s smile faded away. “Oh, there’s really something stressing you out? You wanna talk about it?”
Dean referred to his car as “her”, and not “it”, which deeply amused Cas. “So you can give me a ride?” he asked for confirmation.
“It’s fine, ma’am. You don’t have to justify yourself. We are delighted to have Jack with us! Maybe you could check the paperwork with my partner, Cas, over here while I show Jack around?”
He stood up, leaving the plate – still half full – in the kitchen. He would deal with it later. Or Balthazar would. His roommate would guess what had happened. It wasn’t the first time. And now that he had a plan, Cas was afraid that diverting from it, even for two minutes to throw the uneaten food away, would trigger a new crisis. He showered quickly, repeating the plan in his head. He pictured the polo shirt he would wear, thought about the kind of cereal bar he would take with him, went through the streets he would have to take to get to the meeting building.
“Okay, so I guess now it’s my turn to talk?” Dean smiled. “Well, since I met you in this kitchen, and then saw you at the first CLCP meeting… I was instantly interested in you, because you’re so different from all the other people I know, and… And I’ve been very frustrated because, as you said, I’m usually good at flirting, but with you, it just didn’t seem to work… You didn’t seem interested at all, and I didn’t understand why, or what I was doing wrong… Every time I tried to flirt with you, you just didn’t answer back, so I just thought you weren’t interested… But the more time I spent with you, the more I liked you, and… I know you’re rather introverted, and shy, and I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable, and so after our date at the basketball game…”
"Tada! Victory cookies!" He handed Cas the box. “I made several flavors, so you can be the official tester to decide which ones I’ll make for Saturday!”
Cas looked around. Ten students were looking at him expectantly. He liked them, and he knew this was a safe place, and he actually would have liked to talk about how he was feeling, how conflicted he was between his romantic attraction and his lack of sexual attraction, and about how frustrating it was to know that the only way to be with the boy he liked would be to have sex with him – the only thing he didn’t want to do. So far, no one had mentioned asexuality yet, and Cas was wondering if there were other asexuals among the members of the society.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I know you don’t want to celebrate Christmas, but… I thought that you’d stay in your room and that you wouldn’t see me…”.
Cas barely knew him, so if from the start he embraced the idea that they would never be more than friends, then a friendship would be possible. Locking away the possibility of a romantic relationship from the beginning would save him from having to suffer later, once he would have become attached to Dean and would have had higher hopes. The fall would be painful. But he was going to stop himself. Dean seemed to be the kind of person that was easy to love - and Cas could completely imagine falling in love with him quickly, especially if they spent at least two hours together every week.
“Well, there are a lot of different kinds of animal documentaries. And nowadays, they are probably way better than the ones from your childhood. Technology’s improved. The quality of the pictures is amazing! And I don’t find it boring, but fascinating, and relaxing. And there are a lot of fun facts to learn!”
“Don’t apologize. I liked it. Besides…you still have your hair disheveled, which keeps you from looking too uptight – which, believe me, is a compliment, especially coming from me. By the way, how's your head?” he asked, gesturing at his own head.
Cas had already been thinking about his asexuality a lot for a few days when he first saw the poster. It was pinned in the corridor on the second floor of the science building, and it stood out amongst the other association posters because of its bright colors. The poster was black, but a big rainbow flag was printed in the middle of it, with the name of the organization written above it: “KANSAS UNIVERSITY LGBT+ SOCIETY.” Above the rainbow and the title, a lot of key words were spread throughout the second half of the poster in a multicolored font: “Gay,” “Lesbian,” “Trans,” “Bisexual,” “Queer,” “Pansexual,” “Aromantic,” “Non-binary,” “Questioning,” “Agender”… And one that especially caught Cas’ attention: “Asexual.” It was the first time he’d seen the term displayed in a public space like that. As if it was really something that existed, as if it was something that mattered, something that he wasn’t the only one to experience.
It was really interesting, listening to the other students. No one had the same backstory: they all had different experiences, different personalities… But in the end, an overall feeling of acceptance permeated Cas. Even though no student mentioned being asexual, the way one of the girls described being aromantic was, overall, quite similar to how Cas was feeling. He had never had a problem with his homosexuality, always had accepted it as a fact, a part of who he was, and therefore never felt the need to talk about it. However, Cas enjoyed hearing about other gay students’ experiences, about coming out stories, about having their first homosexual relationship, more than he thought he would. Beyond the specific topic of asexuality, this was a safe space to talk in general.
“It’s not much, because it was too late, but…. I guess it’s better than nothing? I’m sorry, it doesn’t look like what you saw on those Christmas movies you were watching…”
However, that was not the point. If he ever decided to have sex, it would be in the context of a long-term relationship. And he wasn’t in such a relationship with Dean – he was far from it, in fact. And Dean’s entire behavior screamed that he wasn’t looking for one.
And, despite all odds, Cas found it bothered him a little that their watching sessions kept being strictly platonic. Strictly friendly. He didn’t want to have sex with Dean, but he was craving some romantic interaction with him – he wanted to lean his head on his shoulder, curl up sharing a blanket with him, hold his hand, hug him, see him every day… What what they had, no matter how great and amazing it was, soon became not enough. However, it was very clear to Cas that if Dean, the flirtiest guy on the campus, hadn’t made a move yet, it meant he was not interested in him that way. Cas was perfectly aware of it, and he had known it from the beginning, but it still hurt him to experience it and to think about it. Maybe he could have some casual sex with him, if he asked him, given what Dean told him at the party at the bar a few weeks earlier. Dean had told him he was hot. However, casual sex wasn’t what Cas was looking for. He wanted more, so much more! He didn’t want to just have sex with Dean, he wanted it to have meaning. For both of them.
Cas tried to hide his disappointment. “Oh, okay. Sure. You know, last time, it wasn’t… It didn’t bother me. That you hosted the game night. So if your friends want to play here again, next time… That’s fine with me.”
“Because I don’t see the point! It’s great that you find it helpful, I’m happy for you and your friends, but that’s not the kind of society for someone like me!”
He knew that asexuality was a real thing. When he had researched it a few months before, he had gone through a lot of accounts from other people who felt the same way he did. But those people were all anonymous strangers on the Internet. He couldn’t see them in real life, he couldn’t be sure they really existed. On the Internet, it was easy to lie. Maybe he was just inventing it. Here, the word was physically written, printed in purple on this black poster. Asexual. It was written. It was a thing.
Cas leaned into the counter by the sink, closing his eyes. His heart was beating fast. His face felt very hot. He grabbed his cheeks with his hands: they were warm, and he was sure they were still red. He turned to open the tap and ran some cold water through his hands, before wetting his face, his cheeks, his closed eyes, his temples.
“That’s because I realized that I don’t need sex in my life to be happy. Sure, I wouldn’t say no to it, if I had the opportunity, but really, I don’t even care that much about it. I’m satisfied with my life. I haven’t had sex in a few years.. I can assure you, I don’t need sex to live. What I have is enough for me”.
“Yes, I remember! I had no idea he was volunteering there, too. I’m not surprised, though. Dean’s such a nice guy, it fits his character!”
Dean winced, thinking about Tom. Tom didn’t seem to be a bad guy, but Dean was almost sure he would have found the words to convince Cas to sleep with him, even though it hadn’t been Cas' intentions. Good thing Dean talked to Cas before Tom had the time to plan a date.
Three dates with the same guy? That definitely didn't sound like Meg. Cas smiled, amused. He hesitated to tease her a little about it – she herself had teased him enough over two years of friendship to deserve a little payback! - but she seemed quite serious and insecure, which was in stark contrast to her usual behaviour, and he was touched that she had told him about it. If she had, it was because it was important to her, and she trusted him enough to bring it up. He didn't want to rush her. Maybe she was just testing the waters because she didn't know if she could open up about it with him.
Cas’ heart missed a beat as he wondered how to interpret that sentence – and how to interpret the entire night. Had it been a date? Dean’s friends had behaved as if it was one. Dean’s own behavior had been quite ambiguous. But Cas had never been on a date before, so he couldn’t compare to anything he had already experienced. Maybe he was entirely misreading the situation. It wouldn’t be surprising, and it wouldn’t be the first time it had happened. Date or no date, he had spent an amazing night with Dean – he was, in fact, always having great times with him – and that was what mattered. He didn’t want to waste the relationship they had by making it awkward if, for Dean, it was clearly platonic. What they had was already wonderful. More than what Cas could have dreamt of. Wanting more, expecting more, was not reasonable and would only lead to him being disappointed.
Aaron smiled shyly, looking at the floor. Somehow, Cas could see himself in him. Not in every aspect, but he definitely felt as if he could relate to him. He hadn’t known what to expect before coming, but given the eccentricity of Charlie, and all the clichés, he kind of thought most of the students would be very stereotypical gays and lesbians, boys that were as eccentric as Charlie, wearing colorful clothes and maybe make-up – he had nothing against those boys, of course, but as someone who always tried to stay discreet, to perfectly blend into society, he couldn’t really relate to them. Aaron, on the other hand, seemed really ordinary; he was wearing regular jeans, and a sweatshirt in a neutral tone with a black coat. He seemed to be an introvert, like Cas. He wondered what his story was, but of course, didn’t ask. He would probably progressively learn more about everyone’s stories as the meeting went, he thought.
They drove in silence, Cas not daring asking Dean where they were going. The hunter finally parked at a Walmart.
“No, but we're all going to a party at a bar together tonight, though. With all the folks from the poker circle, like Dean, and everyone. As always, feel free to join us!”
He had chosen the color of the polo shirt he would wear while he was in the shower to prevent him from going through a new existential crisis. A light blue one that would match with his dark blue jacket and his dark jeans. He checked the time. 1:15. He only needed fifteen minutes to walk to the campus and reach the building where the meeting was taking place, but he didn’t want to risk being late. He drank a glass of water and put his small notebook, a pen, some tissues, the cereal bar, and his wallet in his jacket pocket. He tried to think about what he might have forgotten, but couldn’t think of anything.
“Oh yes, of course, Cas! You're a little bit early, but come in, I was just preparing tea for the meeting!”
Cas frowned, confused. He didn’t know what to answer: should he ask for more information? Maybe Dean didn’t want to talk about it, if he wasn’t elaborating. What could he say, now?
Unluckily, when he turned off the shower after rinsing, he heard that someone else was in the bathroom. He had a 50/50 chance. It was either Sam or Cas. After waiting a few seconds to see if the person would leave, he resigned himself to open the door... Only to find Cas' piercing blue eyes - the same ones in the app photo - looking back at him through the bathroom mirror.
Once he was in his room, Cas took off his shoes, put on some comfortable clothes, and laid down on his bed. He closed his eyes and let his thoughts drift. Without realizing it, he fell asleep.
“Wait, Dean, I’m going outside. If you’re talking, I can’t hear you,” Cas said as he opened the door.
Dean caught a glimpse of hope in Cas’s eye. He still had his hand in his. So he held his gaze and whispered very softly :
Balthazar cursed and another player clapped. It seemed to be a good move, and even without knowing the game, Cas understood Dean just won. The guy next to Dean put a hand on his shoulder to congratulate him.
Meg followed his gaze and whistled. “Well, it seems that Dean Winchester already got a new girl? That guy is a real womanizer. He, for sure, doesn’t have the same problem that you, he gets laid often enough!” she giggled.
He stayed in the coffee shop until it closed, three hours later. Dean didn’t come, not even to pick up Jo at the end of her shift. Cas didn’t know whether he should be disappointed by the fact he didn’t see him, or relieved about the fact that he didn’t come to see Jo – which didn’t mean they wouldn’t meet later, at one of their places.
The problem was that “later” came too quickly. The next morning, when Dean woke up, he wondered for a minute whether he had dreamt last night’s events or not. He glanced at his phone, hesitating for a few seconds before unlocking it. The dating app was still open, and Cas still stared at him through the picture of his profile. Dean put the phone back on his bedside table before rubbing his face with both hands. All right, then. He was going to need coffee to face the day.
“So, yes, that’s all I wanted to say, basically. I am very anxious, and I hesitated a lot before agreeing to share my experience today, but I’m glad I did,” Cas smiled. “Even if I got a little bit carried away… I didn’t plan to mention that guy I’m in love with for example, but… I think I heard that we are in a safe place, and that nothing that is being said here will leave this room, so…”
During the entire afternoon, Dean was in a great mood, full of energy, acting lightheartedly with both the children and Cas. As if he hadn’t told Cas that he looked hot before leaving with another girl fifteen hours earlier.
Cas was so sure that Dean would come up with an excuse to leave, that he stood gaping, speechless for a few seconds.
The woman looked at him and smiled. “I prepared some slides to present the program, but it seems that I can’t connect the computer to the projector. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong!”
Cas nodded, slightly disappointed – even though he had no right to be disappointed: he should have asked him quicker – “Yes, thank you again! We…”, he stopped, hesitant. “We should do that again sometime. I enjoy spending time with you.”
“Tea isn’t boring. There are a lot of varieties, a lot of recipes, you have to be careful when brewing it so that it’s not too strong and that the taste is perfect, you can add milk, mix flavors…”
It was clear: Dean didn’t want to talk more about his own feelings. Cas could understand that. They weren’t close, they only met one week ago. Yet, he had just had a heart-to-heart conversation with him, trusting him with his struggles, admitting that he was weak. Usually, it was really hard for him to open up to others. Dean really had magical powers. Not only could he appease him and calm him down, but it was also ridiculously easy to talk to Dean. He listened carefully, and Cas didn’t feel judged or anything. He could just be himself and didn’t feel as if he had to hide his weaknesses to protect himself.
? No, they would have seen it. Since Cas had become human, he was living permanently at the bunker. He could drive, but was very rarely out. It was impossible he could have gone on a date without Dean or Sam noticing it. How did Cas even get the idea of the dating app? And how did he learn how to use the app? He could barely use his phone! And when did he create his profile? Was he using the app a lot? Dean thought about it for a minute, but he couldn’t remember Cas being on his phone more than two minutes. At least, not when he was with Sam and him. Maybe it was Sam’s idea? Maybe Sam taught him how to use the app?
“No offense, Charlie, but I’m fine, I’m confident enough in my bisexuality, thanks. I don’t need to talk about it to know that I both like hot girls, and hot guys. I don’t have any problem with it.”
It was good for him to get his mind off things. After two games and a few more beers, he was feeling better. The group of friends who had asked him to join them made no comments and asked no questions, which Dean appreciated. He showed them his best pool moves. He was interrupted a few hours later by his phone ringing. It was a message from Sam, asking if everything was okay. He hurried to answer, their dispute the day before still fresh in his mind. While he was answering, the man who had offered to play tapped him on the shoulder to let him know that their group was leaving, they had a bit of a drive home. Dean nodded, answering he would be home soon himself. After he sent his message to Sam, his eyes were drawn to a notification on his phone from the previous morning: "It's a match! Tom sent you a message on 'Date me'". A wave of curiosity swept over him as he stared at the notification. He wanted to see what Tom's profile looked like, and why Cas had swiped right. But he was struck again by Cas' profile picture as soon as he clicked on the app to open it, since he still hadn't swiped left or right.
“Same time. Have a good week, Cas, and feel free to text me anytime if you have any questions or feel anxious about the program… Or anything else actually!”
And then, he remembered that an hour before, Dean had called him “buddy.” Cas almost sighed, confused. He was getting mixed signals here!
He’d known for a while that he was attracted to men, but he had always buried it, ignored it, mainly because he was afraid. Afraid of what others would think, afraid of trying and liking it, afraid of being ridiculous by flirting with a guy that, in fact, was straight. The relative anonymity and distance induced by the virtuality of the dating app felt reassuring. He could explore this attraction he was feeling, chat with some guys, and see how it would feel without involving himself too much or worrying what others would think. No one he knew would know he was on this app, let alone that he was looking for both women and men. Or, at least, that was what he had thought.
“Come on, Clarence, don’t be blind! He said you were beautiful, winked at you, and told you he couldn’t wait to see you on Saturday… What more do you need, a proposal? And for your information, Cassie’s not his girlfriend.”
This time, it was Cas' turn to almost choke on his drink. Dean was doing what, now? Asking about him? But why?
Dean stopped laughing immediately, but he still looked happy. “No, no, Cas, that’s not… I’m just so, so, so relieved!”
Dean knew he was wrong, and that he was just showing bad faith. It wasn't Sam's fault that he was freaking out because he had been stupid enough to sign up for a dating app and put in his profile that he was interested in men and came across Cas' profile. His defense mechanism was aggressiveness, it always had been. But there was no point in antagonizing Sam. So, admitting defeat, he lowered his head:
And thank you to A., who made me discovering Supernatural, helped me figuring out I was ace when I was questioning, and listened to me talking about "More than one ace to play" even though they don't like fanfiction.
“Do you want me to grab some pizza for you? I think there are some slices left. Might be a little cold by now, though,” Dean offered.
He quickly read through the comments from the TA. There weren’t many of them. He only made two little mistakes, but nothing too serious. Satisfied, he gave it back to his friend who decided to spend the entire hour comparing their works instead of listening to the teaching assistant explain how to solve practice questions that could be on the midterm.
“Thanks, Cas. It means a lot. And…I am completely okay to never have sex again if I can keep being with you”.
Cas finished eating breakfast silently. For a Monday morning, he wasn’t feeling too anxious. The week was starting in a good way.
“The problem isn’t that you weren’t interested in her, it’s that she basically forced you, which is absolutely not okay. And frankly, this advice your coworkers gave you? They are the worst!”
At the end of the class, he quickly glanced at the poster in the corridor, but didn’t linger there, since he was with Meg.
Sure, going to pre-med and then to med school wouldn’t be easy; the selection process would be harsh, and he would have to work a lot. It would be a very stressful time. But on the other hand, it felt grounding and comforting, to have a plan. He was even more worried about his future, his adult life, than about his exams, so knowing that he knew what he wanted to do felt good. Besides, he was lucky enough to have wealthy parents who could afford to pay his tuition fees; he didn’t need to worry about a student loan or part-time job, and could dedicate himself entirely to his studies. He could buy all the study materials he could possibly need: thousands of dollars of expensive textbooks, the best computer, everything that could help him achieve his goal. And at least his parents were supportive of this project, which was also a relief, given how strict and demanding they could be.
He waved at Donna, who was still busy with the last unpaired students, and then turned to Cas. “Okay, we have to get organized to prepare for next week. We’re out of this meeting earlier than expected, so I assume that you’re still free?”
“I’ll see Dean next week, by the way, we have a poker night,” Balthazar said when he heard Cas coming in the kitchen the next day.
"It's okay, what matters is that everything is fine. You know, Cas was disappointed you weren't here for dinner. I think he likes your burgers better than my cucumber salad..."
“Well sorry about that, man. I don’t know why I told you all that, out of the blue like I did. Talking about my feelings isn’t something I usually do,” he laughed to hide his embarrassment. “Hell, I have a reputation to uphold!”
“Really? Yeah, that’s surprising, because I would definitely have remembered if I had already seen you before!”
Cas froze, almost panicking, not knowing how to react. What was happening? Dean stayed close to him for a few moments, and Cas could smell the alcohol on him. He sighed. That’s what was happening: Dean was drunk. He had no idea what to do.
Dean's phone broke the moment as it began to ring. Dean let go of the parts of the scarf he was still holding and stepped back a little to pick up the phone.
“Plus the two of us. So I’d say, if you could make one of each flavor for everyone, it might be great… But maybe that’s too much?”
Cas kept talking, but Dean’s brain had frozen after the “because it was mainly about you” part and the implications behind it. So, in the end, perhaps Cas didn’t just like Dean’s profile because he didn’t know how the app worked, or just to be polite, or out of surprise, or because he knew Dean… But because he really
He reached out to shake Cas’ hand. His hand was warm and firm, while Cas’ was almost shaking, without him even knowing why.
"Uh... Well, well, well,” he began, hesitantly, testing the waters. “There is something... But I'm not sure if we have enough time to do it in 20 minutes..."
Dean blinked. The situation was weird, but he was making it even weirder. It was quite clear that Cas had no idea that Dean had just come across his profile. However, if Dean didn’t stop acting so awkwardly, Cas would know something was wrong, get suspicious, and he would probably end up thinking about the app. Especially if he already saw Dean’s profile – but maybe he hadn’t? Otherwise, he would have acted strange, like Dean was acting right now. He couldn’t have seen Dean’s profile and kept acting as usual. Dean definitely couldn’t.
He was interrupted by a ringtone. It took it a moment to realize it was his phone. Who could be calling him at 11 pm on a Friday night? The only people who usually called him was his father, who was probably sleeping, and Balthazar, who wasn’t far from him and wasn’t on his phone. He grabbed his phone to check the ID of the caller. He held back a little exclamation from the surprise.
Cas tilted his head, studying Dean’s backside. He didn’t see what was special about it. Did Meg find it attractive? Why? What was beautiful about Dean was his face, not his butt! He would prefer looking at his face than at his rear!
Cas finally found enough willpower to unlock himself from Dean’s gaze to actually get out of the car, and he quickly closed the door to not be tempted to stare at Dean longer. Dean started the car, and Cas waved at him, even though Dean couldn’t see him in the dark.
Cas nodded. “I’m ready to go when you want! I was actually thinking about looking for you to ask you the same thing.”
"No, no, it's just that Balt told me about the poker game tonight, and I thought you might want to get there as soon as possible, once the cookie "obligation" was over..."
They wanted two different things, and Cas was very frustrated about it, because he was also sure that there was something between them. They enjoyed themselves so much, they had such a good connection! He sometimes wished he could just be like everyone else and be happy with the idea of a friend-with-benefits situation, which would satisfy both of them.
Cas stared at him, a little bit suspicious. “Really? You are not saying this to be polite and to make me happy?”
“But you and I both know that you can also be more ruffled in other circumstances, especially at night," he whispered.
Dean wasn’t that convinced. He really wanted to give something special to Cas and was afraid that the angel would be disappointed if the hunter prepared a nice Christmas package only to give him something’s lame. He finally found something’s quite adequate and smiled. 6:30. He had to hurry.
“That’s why you were surprised to see him on the app! Do you know if he’s dating anyone right now? I offered to meet up someday and he had been acting coldly ever since.”
“Hey, it’s okay. There’s nothing wrong with it. Nothing to be ashamed of. That’s why we organize our events, so that students like you know that they are not alone. I’m sure attending one of the meetings would help you. You don’t even have to talk. You can just come and listen. See if it helps you, if you like it. Even if it’s only one time, and then you never come again. Just give it a try.” She smiled at him cheerfully.
“Actually,” he added, more self-assured than a few minutes before, “I’d suggest wearing another color, for next time.”
Even though Cas wasn't looking at Dean, staring fixedly at the menu boards behind the counter, he could feel Dean's eyes on him, which was enough to make him slightly blush. He couldn’t help but take a glance at Dean. The young man had his arms folded and was staring at him, a smile on the corner of his lips as if he was only waiting for the moment when Cas was going to catch him looking and meet his eyes. Cas gave him a questioning look.
It is only when he reached the door of his house that he realized he had left without his coat. And that his keys were in his coat. It was a Sunday afternoon. Would Balthazar be home? What did he have planned that day? Cas had been so focused on the fact that he was going to speak at the meeting that he hadn’t paid attention to what his roommate had told him the day before. He banged at the door, desperately calling Balthazar’s name – even though he didn’t need his friend, but more the access to his room, so he could throw himself on his bed and hide under his pillow.
They didn’t mention the party or Dean’s comment about Cas “being hot,” and Cas thought it was for the best. The whole afternoon, he had felt very comfortable around Dean; no need to bring up a vexing question.
“No that’s fine, you warned me, I should have paid more attention. Besides, my meeting tomorrow is only at 2, so I should be fine. What time are your friends coming for?”
“Hey Cas, how are you doing?” Dean beamed at him, looking cool, casual, confident, handsome, nice. Looking like
Did Cas only swipe right on his profile because he knew Dean and thought it was a funny coincidence, or did he not know how the app worked and the implications behind his gesture, or was he really interested in Dean? Should Dean answer on the app? He decided to go home and confront him about it directly, since now he couldn’t ignore the situation anymore, now that they both knew that they were both on the app (and that they were both aware of it).
Oh. Cas had completely forgotten because he had been busy thinking about his volunteer program, but Balthazar had warned him two weeks ago that he would be hosting the next evening for his poker club. Back then, Cas hadn’t realized that it was the day before his first volunteer meeting, and he had agreed. Balthazar didn’t ask him if he could have friends over often, and it was a Friday evening, so there were no classes the next day.
He winked, and once again, Cas realized how close to him Dean was. What was happening? Was he flirting with him? Flustered, he pointed at the bread.
“What about some cleaning first, and then we can finish the pie while you tell me what you thought about your first day before I drive you back to your place?”
“Usually, Dean is more polite than that. I don’t know what  happened to him tonight. Perhaps it’s the alcohol.”
When Dean judged that he had waited long enough and that Sam - and more importantly, Cas - had probably finished their meals, he decided to leave his garage-refuge, heading for the kitchen.
They formed two teams of children – Dean’s and Cas’, but of course, they didn’t help the kids since they knew the answers – and they both teased each other about whose team would win. As always, spending time with Dean was nice, and easy, and Cas was feeling good. He was there, supervising the kids, having responsibility, but he was fine. He knew that if he had a problem, he could count on Dean. But he didn’t even need Dean. He could take care of the children by himself now. It was impressive to see how much self-confidence he had gained in just a few months.
“But when I talked about it with my coworkers, there are…things that didn’t exactly match with their definitions of what love is.”
Cas smiled at the thought of Dean struggling with the 11 to 13-year olds, trying to not lose his temper.
Cas was so confused that he was actually happy that Dean was taking the lead. He didn’t want to think about anything, so he let himself be guided by Dean.
Dean raised an eyebrow – clearly, he hadn’t been expecting that. “You’re full of surprises… And that’s why I love you,” he said, leaning in to kiss him.
“So, can I buy another one, or shall we get something lighter for a start? A beer maybe? That would probably keep the conversation going longer... Unless I have to catch up with you first?"
Dean looked up and met his gaze. If his face didn't show his concern - he probably didn't want to worry the other kids - Cas could clearly read the fear in his eyes.
“Nah, that’s not a big problem, it’s just that, you’ll learn soon enough that when working with kids, you tend to avoid wearing white. White gets dirty easily, especially when doing activities with children.”
Cas mentally chastised himself. Saying that to Dean, who made a string of dirty jokes last week, wasn't necessarily the best thing to do. The wording of his sentence was confusing, and Dean probably wouldn't pass up the opportunity to pick up on the innuendo. And to suggest his own idea for a twenty-minute activity - which would probably be quite different from the one Cas had in mind!
Jody rolled her eyes and Cas was surprised enough to make an amused little sound. Usually, he was quite oblivious to that kind of humor.
Lisa rolled her eyes. “Not what you should have taken away from my proposition, Dean. So what do you think? You want me to come back to your place with you? I could take care of you…”
“You don’t understand, Sam. I broke him. I broke Cas. He got scared of me when I caught him cooking earlier! How the hell did we get here? How did I screw up so badly? What is wrong with me?”
Cas never really showed any interest in dating, even when Dean tried to encourage him – giving him advice, offering to go out with him to bars, even starting a conversation with a cute girl to introduce Cas to her. Well, at least, he used to encourage him. That was when Dean himself used to go out, to flirt and hook up a lot. Though, when he thought about it, he had to admit he hadn’t done that for a few months. Not since they found the bunker, actually. Now, Dean had a place to go home even when he was going out, and it was not as if he could bring anyone back to the bunker. Before, after a hunt, Dean liked to stay one or two days and nights in the town he worked in, just to relax a little, get drunk, and maybe, if he was lucky and in the mood for it, find a sexy girl to spend the night with. Now, when he was done with a hunt, he liked to hurry up to go back to the bunker, to get back to his kitchen, his room, his bed.
Cas simply grinned, but it was a special grin. A particularly sincere and wide grin. Dean grinned back, his eyes sparkling, and resumed forming dough balls again, which he then placed on a baking sheet.
“Oh, there you are! We were looking for you,” Balthazar said. “I was thinking that maybe we could go home soon, Cas? For a first time at the bar, a couple of hours may be enough!”
Dean, who had been playing with his spoon, raised his head, looking at him, smiling shyly, a shade of relief painted on his face.
He was grumpy for the rest of the weekend. Apparently, for him it had been a big deal – Dean telling him he found him hot! – but for Dean, it was nothing out of the ordinary. Dean was probably too used to flirting with everyone. Cas hadn’t seemed receptive, so he had found someone else. He didn’t really care about Cas, and if he had been interested, it was only for sex. Balthazar had definitely been right when he had told him “
“Come on Cas, of course it’s on me, I’m the one who invited you after all! Besides, I get a discount since I know Ellen.”
However, while the idea had seemed very good when he had thought of it, now that it was the time to say it out loud in front of Dean, he was much less sure of himself.
“I like that idea,” Cas agreed. “I’m actually pretty anxious, and I'd feel better knowing I won’t be completely alone with the children for the first week."
Cas sounded and looked really sad. Dean wanted to do something, to say something, but he couldn’t and just sighed when he heard the door closing. He just screwed things up, one more time.
Dean raised his hands as a sign of appeasement. "Okay, okay, I was kidding. I'm really glad I get to watch it. "Our Planet" has been on my list for several weeks! You recommended it, by the way, I think!"
Cas tried not to smile too widely. Maybe he would see Dean there. He had said he was a regular, but Cas hadn’t noticed him there before. He had never paid attention, though. As they entered the coffee shop, he scanned the room. It was pretty empty at this time of day, and of course, no Dean. A wave of disappointment – of irrational disappointment – swept over him. Meg probably noticed it, because she gave him a strange look.
Dean finally stood back up, holding the case. Surprised, Cas didn’t have time to look away. Dean spotted him looking and smirked.
“No, thanks, I’m currently talking to Raphael,” Cas answered, maybe a little bit colder than he had planned.
“Well, you never really showed any interest in romance or sex before, when you were an angel, so I wondered if you could be aromantic and asexual.”
Cas wondered where Dean was going with that because it was now obvious that he had something in mind. The boy moved a little closer to him, lowering his voice.
Of course, it wasn’t enough to make up for it, but Cas didn’t know what else to say. He was afraid he would make things worse and the situation even weirder.
He paused, again. He had already said a lot, more than what he had initially planned, but once he had started, he had realized that it felt so good to finally have the space and the opportunity to talk about it, to describe what he felt, and what his thoughts were about it, that he couldn’t stop himself from talking. He had shared some very personal thoughts, things he had never told anyone else – but talking about how sometimes he masturbated was definitely crossing the line. He shook his head. Maybe his audience understood him even if he didn’t say it explicitly. He crossed Charlie’s gaze, who was staring at him, before focusing on the LGBT flag that hung next to the board.
“But I don’t understand: you admitted you were attracted to him! So why don’t you want to take what he has to offer, even if it’s just for one night or two? Still better than nothing. You could have some fun, sexy times with him and then forget about him if you want! No pressure, no strings attached, no feelings. That’s perfect!”
“I’m not laughing at you, Cas,” Dean said, more seriously. “Really, I’m not. It’s just that… It’s ridiculous. Sex isn’t what make us humans! There are a lot of humans who never have sex, or who don’t like it, or don’t want it. I assure you that you’re not alone. There is nothing wrong with you, Cas. I’m not gonna lie to you, hooking up is fun, but believe me, it’s not the only thing in the world. There are things that matter more. And the older I get, the more I understand that. When’s the last time you saw me hook up with some random chick in a bar?”
, and he'd been through enough changes lately. He still needed some markers, signs that, even though he'd lost his powers, he hadn't completely changed.
On the ride back to campus, they talked about the next activities they would propose to the children, and Cas didn’t get to bring back the “is being a doctor my true vocation” topic. Maybe it was for the best. He was already falling hard for Dean, and he didn’t necessarily need another moment of intense connection between the two of them to fuel his unrequited crush.
Dean smiled. “First, tea can be cool. I like this black one, by the way, and I will definitely be asking you for more recommendations."
“Yes, he can be a little over-dramatic sometimes, you know how kids are… Thanks for taking care of him!”
The angel jumped, surprised, spilling a bowl full of dough in the process. Crossing Dean's gaze and lowering his eyes immediately, he even looked a little scared, as if he has been caught doing something wrong.
The feeling of well-being helped him to begin his week on the right foot. He felt better about himself, and he was the first to be surprised about it; he never truly believed in the “magical virtues” of “talking” (or, in his case, listening). It was way too cliché for him. But having a crush on the popular handsome guy who was his complete opposite was already very cliché.
Of course, after leaving Charlie, when he thought about it, he began to second-guess it. What was he thinking? He had never even talked about his asexuality with Balthazar, his closest friend, and he was about to do it in front of people he hadn’t even known two months before? In front of Charlie, one of Dean’s closest friends? What if she told Dean, and Dean decided to stop spending time with him, considering he wasn’t worth it since he wasn’t interested in sex? What would he even say?
“That’s fine. And anyway, you found out the answers, so you deserve the reward!” Dean announced cheerfully, clapping his hands and leaning down to grab his backpack.
It was Dean’s turn to blush, and he nervously ran a hand through his hair. Cas was surprised to see that it had been so easy to unsettle this apparently overconfident guy.
This time, the living room door was ajar. He pushed it a little, just so that he could see better without having to go into the room. This time, there were six players around the table, all of them so focused on the game that they wouldn't have noticed him anyway. Balthazar had his back turned to him and was looking at the other players with interest, trying to read their faces. Next to him, the girl who had been sitting next to Dean earlier was sorting her cards. And, directly in front of him, Dean was rolling a chip through his fingers, seemingly thinking intensely. He took a look at his cards and frowned a little.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas answered, surprised to see him there. He waited for Dean to explain why he had come, but the guy just kept staring at him. After a moment, Cas cleared his throat and decided to ask him.
“Actually…Not today. Today I feel like trying new things, meeting new people, making a fresh start…”
Oh no. This was so embarrassing. Cas felt himself turning crimson. What would Dean think about him now? The worst part was that he wasn’t even checking him out, he was… researching, and trying to understand why people would check him out. Now Dean probably thought he was a pervert. Or maybe not, because he was probably used to people staring at him. But he would think that Cas was interested in him – which was true – in a sexual way – which wasn’t true.
"Well," he resumed, trying to appear confident and relaxed (the opposite of his current state of mind and of his personality in general). "About that... I had thought that maybe you could combine the two... Can you come with me into the living room?"
Everybody in the room was looking at them and Cas looked at his feet, ill-at-ease. And to think that he had hoped not to stand out too much during the first meeting! Dean sat down, still looking at Cas.
“So, I guess we’re just not compatible. We want different things in a relationship. We can’t be together. But he’s so great, and I feel so good when we’re together, as if all my worries were gone, as if I was invincible, I have more confidence in myself and it just feels good to spend time with him… That hurts even more, to know we’ll never be able to be together. I often wish I wasn’t like this. Asexual, I mean. But the truth is that even if I was allosexual – you know, allosexuals are people who aren’t ace – I would still want a romantic relationship. So I can’t blame the situation on my asexuality. It’s just not fair. However, I realize now that burying my asexuality, trying to ignore it, to not think about it, to not talk about it, wasn’t the right thing to do, because it didn’t make it go away. My attraction – or my lack of attraction – didn’t change. There was no point in ignoring it.”
Dean talked about the program and his experience with it a lot. For over an hour. He was also a third year student in mechanical engineering, and he had been a volunteer in the program since his first year. He was from Lawrence so he knew the city pretty well, and he had always wanted to help others. He'd known Jody and Donna since he was in high school, which was why he was so familiar with them. He talked a lot about children he had tutored in previous years with fondness. He seemed to genuinely care about them, even the most annoying ones. He preferred organizing the fun activities rather than supervising homework, but he wasn’t against the school tutoring.
Was socializing this easy? Cas had feared unknown social situations for years, and now he could just attend some random meeting with strangers without freaking out, even be able to make small talk with them?
Cas could still see Dean, leaving the kitchen the night they met, being all flirty andover-confident, presumptuously offering:
“Yeah, precisely. He wouldn’t have missed the opportunity to beat him in his own place usually. He must really care about these children… or about you.”
Cas couldn’t believe what he was hearing. It just seemed so… unexpected, and too good to be true… But suddenly, hearing Dean listing all the activities they could do as a couple, a real
It began to rain. How cliché! However, Cas didn’t even care. He was past the anger, past the sadness, now he was just tired. Emotionally and physically drained. He sat leaning against the door, cowering over himself, his head buried in his lap, silently crying dry tears. The rain was falling all over him, but he didn’t even feel it, too numb for that. He lost all notion of time. Balthazar would end up coming back home eventually, wouldn’t he?
“So those were the basics about asexuality, but I believe that someone here can add to what I said by sharing his personal experience?”
“So, we were here to talk about the volunteering program…” Cas suddenly started, in a neutral tone. He felt that he needed to regain some control over the situation. Talking about a neutral topic, something that he could focus on, would help him to pull himself together.
was he supposed to answer? It would be more polite to answer. He had to. But if he answered too quickly, Dean would think he had nothing else to do on a Friday evening and that his life was boring. On the other hand, Dean probably already knew that he wasn’t doing anything special. And he didn’t know Dean enough to text him too late on a Friday night, so he shouldn’t wait too long. He began to think about his answer, before realizing that he shouldn’t care that much. Dean was only a friend, and what he thought about Cas didn’t matter. Cas wasn’t trying to seduce him or anything. He should act with him the same way he acted with his other friends. Except that he didn’t really have many friends… Anyway, he shouldn’t overthink this. He grabbed his phone.
Hesitantly, Cas raised his gaze to look at Dean; as always, he was immediately struck with the greenness and depth of Dean’s eyes. He looked comforting. Dean smiled, and Cas shyly imitated him.
Cas didn’t know what to answer. He could feel that his cheeks were red – was it because of Dean’s proximity, because of how aware he was of Dean’s warm hands on his shoulders? Was it because of the compliment? – and his head was spinning a little. So he didn’t answer, and kept staring at Dean instead. For both of them, it was enough. After a while, Dean finally let go and took a step away.
Cas had been smiling, half-joking with his last sentence, however, as he crossed Charlie’s gaze, instead of reading in her eyes the confirmation that his secret was safe, he saw her eyes widen and her expression freeze. Cas immediately understood that something was wrong. He felt the first signs of a wave of panic starting to rise.
He didn’t add anything else for the moment, clearly not wanting to rush Cas. On one hand, Cas was grateful for that, but on the other hand, he knew that it couldn’t last. At some point, what happened needed to be addressed. Ignoring the problem wouldn’t make it disappear, and he knew the more he waited, the more anxious he would get about it.
However, it was not a date, it was just a casual meeting between two volunteers. It was almost a professional situation. He had to be careful to keep that in mind.
A comfortable silence settled in, during which the two boys continued to stare at each other. Cas realized that when his eyes met Dean’s, his thoughts suddenly stopped racing, which didn't happen often. He felt calm, and it felt nice. When he was talking with Dean, it was different, because he had to think about what to answer, and he was afraid of saying something stupid, and felt as if nothing he could say could be as good as what Dean was saying anyway. Dean was so in control, and Cas was struggling to not disappoint him. For some reason, probably because he was just a very kind guy, Dean was taking time to talk with Cas, to say nice things to him, tease him a little. He would end up noticing that Cas wasn’t as witty as him, that he wasn’t as good at repartee as him. And he would get bored. But Cas liked talking to Dean, and he didn’t want him to think he was boring. He wanted Dean to keep talking to him.
Cas didn’t understand what was so funny about the situation, but Dean was glowing. Happiness looked good on him, and Cas felt a hint of tenderness, along with the determination to try and make Dean laugh as much as he could, even if he didn’t know how. Apparently, just being himself seemed to be enough to entertain Dean. Cas wasn’t going to complain about that. It felt good to be able to just be himself, and he was starting to realize that Dean was one of these rare people with whom he wasn’t afraid to act natural. With Dean, he didn’t have to play a role.
Mostly, they watched at Cas’ place because he had a big TV in his living-room, but Dean invited him over to watch at his dorm a few times when Benny was at Meg’s place. At first Cas had been a little anxious about it – being alone with Dean in his bedroom, on his bed… But Dean was so at-ease, making him comfortable, that Cas quickly relaxed. Sure, they were closer, sitting on Dean’s bed, watching on the small computer screen, their shoulders touching… But nothing more happened.
Luckily, his week was quite busy, with a lot of assignments due, which allowed him to focus on something else, even though he found it especially hard to not think about this “date.” Dean texted him on Thursday to confirm the time, and somehow, even though it wasn’t rational because Cas knew he hadn’t dreamt the invitation, he felt reassured to have written “proof” that this was real. He was really supposed to meet Dean for the basketball game.
By the end of the day, hungry, he decided to go cook something in the kitchen. The room was a complete mess; there was flour everywhere, a smell of burning, eggs shells on the counter, and, in the middle of everything, Castiel, only wearing his shirt, his trench coat – covered with flour – on a chair, with his suit jacket. He was standing with his back to Dean, and seemed deeply focused on a book on the table in front of him, a whisk in his right hand.
Cas hadn’t planned to ask him that. It was one of his deepest worries, one that he didn’t share easily, but he had been so mesmerized by Dean’s speech, and talking to him felt so easy, that it just slipped out of his mouth. He had said that while staring at his eyes intensely, and his voice sounded almost broken. He felt vulnerable, and he knew that Dean could sense his distress, the hours he spent wondering whether that path was the right one for him, the hours he spent making up thousands of scenarios in his mind of what he could do instead if he decided to drop the program – even though deep down he knew he was too rational to suddenly just stop it. However, for some reason, he didn’t feel ashamed of appearing so weak in front of Dean; he even felt relieved to let it out. He felt safe with Dean, as if he could tell him anything, trust him with his deepest worries. Even though he didn’t really know him yet.
“And I’m going with a few friends, so, maybe you could… Maybe you could join us? If you have nothing else to do, of course. And if you want to. Maybe you don’t. But I could explain the rules to you, and it could be fun, and… Well, it’s your choice. But you can say no. Of course you can, I’d completely understand. Anyway… It’s up to you…”
Dean knitted his brows, but followed him. "Combine the two? What do you mean? Please, tell me Raphael's not waiting behind the living room door?"
“I can’t believe it, man! What are the odds?” he whispered, sounding thrilled. “Seriously, what are you doing here?”
Cas tilted his head. “If you’re tired, maybe you shouldn’t drink a beer. A glass of hot milk or some herbal tea would help you to fall asleep more easily, I think.”
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to push him, I was running, and I couldn't stop," Ben, one of the children, intervened in a very small voice that didn't sound like him at all.
“Here you go,” Dean said, handing him a cup. “I would have liked to make some hot comfort food, but I didn’t know whether I’d have time and didn’t want to intrude, so I just made you a peanut butter sandwich.”
“I love Jo so much,” Dean kept talking, and Cas’ face darkened. “She’s my oldest friend. We grew up together. She’s like the sister I never had – well, as I told you, I have a little brother, Sammy, but yeah. Jo’s like my sister.”
Dean was looking at him very intensely, as if he was trying to convince Cas with his eyes. He seemed to truly believe what he was saying. Cas lowered his eyes, unable to hold Dean’s gaze any longer, smiling a little sadly.
The day Sam left, Dean didn’t even see Cas. He stayed in his room, only getting out twice to grab something to it back in his room. He even wondered if that was how the full week was going to go. However, on the second day, Cas knocked at his door in the morning. Dean sighed.
Cas wiped his eyes with an angry gesture; he hadn't really cried, but tears had formed at the corners of his eyes. Why did he want to cry? Why did he feel so sad? He wanted to be angry, not sad!
“Yeah, we’re glad you joined us,” a guy – that hadn’t been at the poker night at Balthazar and Cas’ place – said cheerfully. “I’m Garth, nice to meet you.”
“Yeah, that’s the surprise! No, seriously, I thought about it yesterday while preparing my clues. In every good scavenger hunt, there has to be a purpose. The kids will look for the pirate’s treasure chest, and they’ll be disappointed if they find the box empty!”
She was still regularly looking at the person behind Cas; but Cas didn’t want to turn around and have the confirmation that
Cas was stunned by Dean’s ability to speak so freely to this entire group of parents. He was very charismatic because everyone was carefully listening to him – so it wasn’t just Cas who found him amazing: objectively other people seemed to like him, too.
Despite his gloomy thoughts, he found the will to smile. That was exactly what he needed. “You are not alone.” He hoped it was true, that he would find other students like him, and that he wouldn’t be disappointed once again. He wasn’t sure he could take another disappointment right now.
Cas winced. Of course. Not everyone was lucky to have wealthy parents like him. Dean would probably think he was just a daddy’s boy who didn’t have any sense of reality, to assume that everyone could afford a beautiful private fully equipped kitchen like the one he was sharing with Balthazar.
Dean grinned. "Oh, you have no idea! I love watching movies, it's one of my passions, that's why I'm letting you choose. I couldn’t choose myself right now, there are so many options and so many genres that I like… I'm sure I'll enjoy whatever you pick! Besides, we started the evening with baking, which was my activity. Now it's your turn to choose something you like! Surprise me!"
“Okay then I’ll pick you up at 6:30, if that’s okay for you?” Dean said, interrupting Cas’ thoughts.
“Guess it was time for a change,” Cas shrugged. “To experience new things. Go out of my comfort zone.”
Usually, Cas would have laughed at the situation. A party, in a bar, only with people he didn't know? Balthazar himself knew that Cas would never come. However, for the first time, he didn't deny the proposition immediately.
He turned off the tap and stayed like that, leaning over the sink, for a few minutes before he was ready to finally straighten up and move. He shook his head in disbelief and grabbed the peanut butter out of the cupboard and the jelly from the fridge. He found a knife, sat down at the table, and started to conscientiously spread the peanut butter on the bread. He tried to focus on the preparation of the sandwich, but his mind was racing.
Dean stood up, took his jacket and started to leave. Before opening the door and walking out of the coffee shop, he turned to Cas one last time and waved at him. That made Cas feel very soft, and made him slump down on his chair with his eyes closed and a satisfied smile on his lips, happy and relaxed. Thanks to Dean.
“Dean,” Cas sighed. “You heard me, earlier, didn’t you? The… The speech I gave… It wasn’t to declare my undying love for you, not initially, at least… It was to share my experience about… It hurts me to say it, it hurts me even more knowing that you like me back, but… I don’t think we want the same things in a relationship… I’m not against having… Having sex, but… I don’t picture it, right now. If I had to have sex, it would be with you, but, it’s not something I feel ready to do now… I don’t feel the need to. And… You’re beautiful, really, I could stay here and stare at you for hours and hours, but… There’s nothing… There’s nothing sexual in how I feel about you. And I know sex is very important for you, and it would be very selfish of me to keep you from having sex again, since it’s clearly something you enjoy and…”
“Oh, I’m not worried. But here’s a little piece of advice: maybe try to sleep more. You look terrible!”
Cas looked at his feet, embarrassed. Dean probably thought he was weird and antisocial. The opposite of Dean, who was literally the definition of cool.
“He said that he could teach me, and that I was ‘hot’, but really, I didn’t feel like it.“ Cas stopped for a moment, wondering. ‘I thought that maybe seeing him in real life would make me feel new things, but… No. Tom was nice, though, but…”
Cas rolled his eyes. As Dean ordered some pie to be delivered, Cas grabbed a blanket and joined Dean on the couch, throwing the blanket over them. Dean stretched out his arm to allow Cas to snuggle against him and Cas thought he could purr from happiness.
To be honest, he was a little bit irritated by Dean’s behavior tonight. It wasn’t what he had expected when deciding to come to the party – but maybe it was his fault, after all. He had done what he had promised himself he wouldn’t do when he first met Dean: he got his hopes too high. He thought Dean would be surprised, but glad to see him here, and that they could spend some time together in a new setting – a setting that Dean liked and was comfortable in. But instead, Dean had barely acknowledged him, preferring to be the center of attention, making coarse jokes to make everyone laugh. Cas was not used to seeing him like that, and he was disappointed. Was that really who Dean was? He still had the same self-confidence, except that it wasn’t reassuring like usual; no, this time it was irritating, because Dean appeared as someone too smug.
“It’s normal that I help you out with that," Dean shrugged. “Here, take my phone number. If you have any questions, or worries during the week, feel free to text me. Don’t make yourself sick with fears that I can maybe clear away for you with some basic information about the program.”
Cas, who was correcting his math exercise, froze and put his pen down. “What do you mean, Jack? Dean and I weren’t mad at each other!”
“We have many things to try together,” Cas agreed. “But enough new experiences for today,” he said as he stood up, grabbing Dean’s hand – because now, he could just hold Dean’s hand like that, for no reason! – and dragged him to the living-room. “Let’s have your dream night tonight, now that I know it doesn’t involve any nudity… Let’s order some pie and begin season 12 of Doctor Sexy!”
“Dude, what the hell did you do today? Where were you?” Sam asked, furiously, as soon as he heard his brother was home.
When the parents left, Cas let Dean lead the ice breaker games he had prepared, observing the children, trying to memorize their names. Dean regularly looked at him, to see how he was doing, and every time their eyes met, Dean grinned at him, which was making Cas feel more confident in his ability to interact with the kids.
“I heard Benny isn’t there tonight? Maybe I can come home with you?” she said, suggestively. “Wouldn’t it be a good idea, baby?”
Their presentation was pretty good, Cas supposed, as he was trying really hard to stay focused on the slide show instead of thinking about the moment where he would have to talk. It was nothing, he forced himself to keep in mind, the other students do it all the time. Besides, he knew them and trusted them; there were only 11 students present that day, himself included. It wasn’t as if he had to perform a speech in front of hundreds of strangers. He could do it. He had planned it, he knew what he would say. Everything would be fine. He had already accomplished so much over the last few months, learning to open himself up despite his anxiety. It was nothing more than an extra step. A very small extra step. He had already done the hardest part by joining the society, by getting to know the other students over the weeks as he attended the weekly meetings.
“I guess so… I have no experience in the “long-term relationship” area, so I don’t know what to expect… But Benny’s not like the other guys. It’s different with him, I’ve never felt this way before, so… I’ll see how things go,” she admitted, obviously uncomfortable – she didn’t like taking her mask off and being honest about her feelings.
It was a little windy outside, and since Dean and Cas weren’t moving, Cas got a little cold. The trench coat he was wearing wasn’t very warm, so he quickly excused himself for one minute to get the scarf he had in his bag that he hadn’t given back to Dean yet. Dean's eyes widened as he saw Cas exit the building wearing the scarf, but he quickly regained his composure.
“It’ll come with time,” a guy assured. “Remember when you first came to one of our meetings a few months ago, you didn’t even know you were gay, you were just questioning… And look at you now, being out and proud, coming out to your best friends! You’ve come a long way!”
He hadn’t been hurt at all by what his friend had said. He knew he was weird. He just wasn’t sure how high his level of weirdness was.
Cas agreed, trying to not feel disappointed. He would see Dean during the entire afternoon at the CLCP anyway. Still, the more he saw Dean, the more time he wanted to spend with him.
Dean seemed to remember he didn’t come alone. “Oh yes, right, this is Cassie. Cassie, meet Meg, and Cas… Apparently, the name “Cas” is an indicator of beauty,” he joked, winking.
Oh. Dean let his hand, which was still resting on his knife in his pocket, slide down his body. If he hadn't been sitting down, he would surely have become dizzy. He had expected anything but this. Now he did remember swiping right on the profile of a certain Tom, who was only about ten kilometers away from him. But seriously, what was the probability that, a) Tom had also liked his profile, b) that they were in the same bar, at the same time, two days later, and c) that Tom recognized him immediately?
Sam and Eileen had left the bunker for a week. Eileen’s parents were dead, but she still had an aunt and some cousins in Detroit, who invited her for Christmas. A little bit anxious at the idea of seeing them again on her own after her “death”, she asked Sam if he wanted to come with her. The hunter hesitated a little: he wanted to go with Eileen, but at the same time, he didn’t want to let his brother alone for Christmas. But Cas was with him in the bunker, and even though Dean and him had some arguments lately, they seemed to be better these days. At least, they were talking to each other. Plus, maybe, it would be the occasion for the two of them to finally have a good talk, to finally say all the things they needed to, but never said before. Actually, maybe leaving them alone for a week at Christmas wouldn’t be a bad idea. Moreover, Dean never celebrated Christmas a lot, it wasn’t as if they had big family traditions for the holidays… Therefore, he told Eileen he would come with her, and they left the bunker on the 23rd of December, planning to stop for the night on their way.
He would like to talk about it with Dean again, at some point. But how could he broach the topic? And wouldn’t it be too boring for Dean? Once again, the guy wasn’t his therapist. He probably had other problems – and probably more important problems than Cas!
The Kansas Jayhawks ended up winning the game. Charlie and Dean didn’t bring up the topic of the LGBT+ society again, and joked as if nothing had happened – so the argument probably wasn’t serious. And Dean was adorable for the rest of the game, telling Cas fun facts about the players or previous games, enthusiastically cheering the university team, playfully joking with his friends.
Balthazar had been quite calm that week. He didn’t mention Dean again, but why would he have? It probably meant, Cas thought, that Dean didn’t tell Balthazar that he was Cas’ partner for the volunteering program. Which meant that Cas wasn’t important to Dean. Which meant that Dean shouldn’t be that important to Cas. In a way, maybe it was for the best. At least Cas knew where he stood. He was now convinced he shouldn’t expect anything from Dean. And that strengthened him in his resolutions. Dean would only be an acquaintance, perhaps a friend, but nothing more.
Cas rolled his eyes and scanned the group. Everyone seemed very interested in the conversation. Only Raphael was acting more distant, obviously annoyed. Cas discreetly decided to join him, not wanting to hear more about Dean’s sexual history, which only reminded him how he could never be with Dean – considering that sex wasn’t what he was looking for in a relationship and it was obvious that it was something that Dean enjoyed.
“You’re thinking too much, Cas,” he spoke to himself, shaking his head to make his thoughts go away, and focused on his readings.
“Hi everyone, as Charlie said, I prepared a slide show about sexual orientations. You are my test audience, but ultimately, the goal is to use it to educate all students, not only the members of our society who are already pretty familiar with the different sexual identities, but also the other regular students, who don’t know much about the LGBT+ community. And for next week, I am preparing the same kind of presentation, but about gender identity. So, let’s start…”
“Oh no, I was just looking, I’m not really interested, the poster just…. Caught my attention… That’s all,” he answered quickly.
They didn’t stop on their way to pick up Dean’s other friends, so Cas thought they would meet them at the restaurant. However, once they arrived at the Roadhouse, Dean didn’t even look for them in the restaurant, choosing a table with only two seats.
“Of course,” Dean said. “It was nice seeing you today! I’ll say “hi” to Benny from you, if you want, Meg!”
She wasn’t wrong. Cas was weird. And he felt as if he didn’t have the right to complain, because no one would understand him. The guy he had a crush on had said he was hot, and yet Cas found a way to not be happy with that? As Meg said, most of the students on campus would have liked to have been in his situation.
Dean still got out of the car to open the trunk. Cas carefully put his bag inside, and Dean closed the trunk.
“I’m sorry for the gifts, I couldn’t find anything better at the convenience store I stopped… We’ll just say that next year, they’ll be better!”
“Come on, Cas, I don’t forbid you to bake ! I’m just … surprised that you wanna do something Christmas related. You know, after Chuck’s big reveal, and everything…”
Dean led them to the main activities room, where he had put a folder on one of the tables when they had first visited the room. He sat down.
“You know that with the life we’re living, we can’t afford to just leave like that without any explanation. I thought you got yourself into some trouble.”
“Did you need to talk to him? Otherwise you can just give me his case, and I’ll put it in his room.”
“Um… I’m meeting Dean to watch the varsity basketball game tomorrow evening. Do you know what kind of clothes I should wear?”
The latter just smiled. Then, Dean took a few steps backs, still looking at Cas. The angel tilted his head.
The earth didn’t stop turning, Cas didn’t feel a big internal change, and when Dean leaned back, he was still him, and Dean was still Dean, but somehow something had changed between them anyway.
“See? It’s already over,” Cas said, removing the gauze. He looked at the wound – now that it was clean, he could see it was really superficial. There was still a little bit of blood, so he decided to put on a band-aid.
He had attached a picture that took Cas’ breath away. It was a selfie. Cas couldn’t really see the background, but he guessed that Dean was in a kitchen. He was holding the phone in one hand and a rolling pin on the other. He was wearing an apron – Cas never would have thought Dean was the kind of guy who wore an apron when he was cooking! – and he had flour on his face and in his hair. And above all, he was beaming. He looked gorgeous, and adorable. Cas stared at the picture for several minutes, unable to look away. He didn’t even know what to answer. He didn’t have the words. But Dean had asked him a question, and was probably expecting an answer.
“Hey, Dean,” Cas smiled back. Dean was so close he could feel his breath on his face. His heart was beating fast, very fast. It was going to happen. Dean was going to…
“Absolutely, I’ll pick you up at your place around one. The ride only takes less than twenty minutes, but that way I’ll have time to show you around and we will be able to prepare the ice breaker games, if that’s okay with you.”
A group of children had circled one of the kids who was lying down on the floor, crying loudly. Cas turned to ask Dean what had happened, but Dean was already kneeling next to the child.
“Well, not much, mostly asking if you're good, and whether I believed that you might come someday to one of our meetings. But, Cas, tell me... Is there something between you?”
Once Dean and Cassie were gone, and Cas and Meg were out of Café-in, Meg came to her senses, regaining her self-confidence and her teasing tone.
Cas had not expected that. He was stunned for a few moments, before regaining his composure. “If you like black plain coffee, I guess that you’re not a fan of sweet flavors, so I guess a black tea would be fine for you. I usually drink it with milk and sugar, but you can drink it without that if you prefer.”
Cas ignored him while going back to his room, holding his glass of orange juice. These kinds of conversations between Balthazar and him were a regular thing, and he knew his friend was only joking, and that he was respecting his life choices, even if he decided to live differently. Still, this time, it left Cas thoughtful. He had told Balthazar that he was perfectly happy with his life. Was he, though? Sure, he was doing fine, doing what he was expected to do by the teachers, by his parents, going to class, writing essays, doing readings… But was he really happy?
Later that week, he noticed the same poster in different places around the university. He already knew there was a LGBT+ society at the university. They usually communicated a lot about the various events they organized during the year, but he had never felt the need to reach out to them before. He had no problem with his homosexuality, and he’d already met a few other gay students, whether in high school or in university, who he could talk to a little about it. Balthazar himself was bisexual, therefore being gay never felt like a burden he had to carry alone, without the possibility to open up to anyone. Besides, he was comfortable enough with that fact; he knew it was just a part of how he was, one of the things that defined him, and that he couldn’t change it anyway. So he didn’t really need to talk about it.
“It’s okay, we can walk. If we’re too cold, I have some ideas on how we can warm up once we’re at your place…” Lisa assured.
The child smiled and ran to his mother. While she was helping him put on his coat, Dean, who hadn’t stopped laughing, suddenly put a hand on Cas’ shoulder.
The mother nodded, apparently relieved; Cas waved at her, and went through the emergency information he needed from her. He was feeling good: dealing with the parents and the paperwork, looking serious and professional, that he could do. And meanwhile, Dean seemed to be doing great with the shy Jack. Soon, other children joined them, Dean welcoming them and sending the parents to Cas. Once all ten kids were there, Dean clapped his hands to get everyone’s attention.
Or maybe not. Because talking to Cas about his description let Cas know that Dean saw his profile, and therefore was using the app, and was attracted to men…
“So, about next week… “, Dean resumed, once he started the car. “Since the weather is still warm, we could do something outside, like a basketball game or something. We can do more art projects inside later in the winter,” he suggested.
Cas’ eyes widened. Did he hear what he thought he’d heard? Was Dean still joking? Dean took one more step, and now they were really close to each other, and Cas scanned Dean's face, trying to find a sign that he was joking.
Cas let his phone lock itself, scanning at the black screen for a few minutes, before gradually letting it rest on his thigh, eyes half-closed, a blissful smile on his lips. He still couldn’t believe what had happened. He had texted Dean for two hours – and Dean had started it! He had joked with him, but also learnt more about Dean, who seemed to be much more than what Cas had initially thought he was. Dean was surprising. Dean liked cooking. Dean was caring – he had helped Cas, so much! Cas had been on the verge of having an anxiety attack when he got Dean’s text. And talking with Dean had calmed him down instantly. He was now feeling more relaxed than ever, and that was a very new sensation for him. Did Dean have some kind of magical powers or something?
Looking at the mirror in the bathroom, Cas was pretty happy with how he looked. He usually didn’t really find himself “good-looking,” but he had to say, he was feeling good, and confident. He liked wearing the white shirt, and he had been waiting for an occasion to wear that blue tie for a few months. He ruffled his hair a little, because Dean already told him he looked good like that.
“Why did you come? What are you doing here? What were you doing back there? When did you… What did you hear? Did you…”
Cas nodded. He actually knew a lot about not wanting to disappoint one’s father… He had had the same struggles. Still had them. Dean kept going, and Cas never imagined that he would be the kind of guy to open up so easily, especially about personal things like this.
“Yeah, I’d like that,” Cas answered, confirming the fact that, yes, he was really Dean’s boyfriend. “After all, it seems that maybe there will be more than one ace to play…”
Dean beamed at her. “Hey, Jo! I’m doing great, even better now that I’m talking to you," he winked, and Cas looked away, annoyed. So Dean was really flirty with everyone. He wasn’t special, after all. That’s what he was thinking, anyway, but it still hurt to realize it. Deep down, he was still hoping that maybe Dean wasn’t the womanizer he expected him to be after seeing his behavior at the party and the meeting.
“Anyway, when I first heard about asexuality, I had prejudices about it, and immediately thought “no that’s not me, how could it be me?” But the more I read about it, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it answered a lot of my questions. It was the explanation for why I wasn’t as interested in sex as my friends. But I already have a lot of issues to deal with – I’m shy, and very very anxious, and I’m gay, and it’s already a lot to manage, and I didn’t want to add something more, and back then, it didn’t seem very relevant, as I was still single anyway, and I wasn’t interested in anyone, and therefore, I didn’t feel the need to think about it. I preferred burying it, pretending I had never heard about it, as if ignoring it could make it less real. And I almost succeeded! Until… Until…”
“Perfect, then I’ll say goodbye to my friends, and we can leave! You can wait for me here, if you want!”
“I guess that now you won’t want to be my friend anymore. Maybe we can reach out to Jody Mills from the CLCP to ask if we can maybe be paired with other volunteers, so you don’t have to interact with me anymore?”
Dean startled a little and ran a hand through his hair. “Oh yeah, right, sorry, I… I was just… uh…” He shook his head and resumed, more confidently this time. “Is Balthazar here? I kept his poker case in my car, last time, and I told him that I would drop it off at his – well, at your – place.”
Dean’s eyes widened. He had definitely not been expecting that – but wasn’t complaining. Quickly, he got caught up in the game, and sat down on the couch, pulling the case to him, opening it gently and taking out one deck of cards.
“Oh, I’ve seen him at parties before. And we have a common friend,” she answered evasively. “But I don’t know him personally. Why, are you interested?” she smirked.
“It might sting a little, but I'm sure a big boy like you won't feel a thing!" Cas said while pressing the gauze on the wound.
“Here, Dean, there’s a seat in the second row," Donna said, pointing to the chair next to Cas. “Just next to—"
He tried to not think as he ran to his house. On his way, he almost got hit by a car, almost fell twice, his vision being blurred. He couldn’t process what had just happened. Had Dean really heard him basically confessing his love for him AND his asexuality? That was the worst scenario ever. What had he been doing there anyway? He always said to Charlie that he didn’t want to come to her society’s meetings, gently making fun of her for it! How could he have been there?
However, he read about the concept, and quickly discovered his definition of asexuality was wrong. He learned about the difference between romantic and sexual attraction, and from what he read, it was clear that he never felt that “sexual attraction”. That was how he realized that, after all, people were not exaggerating when talking about sex. He began to rethink almost all of the conversations he had ever had with friends about sex. So all these times, they hadn’t been joking? He had really misread and misunderstood so many conversations? The idea had felt overwhelming, in the beginning, and he had tried to forget about it. He was already “different” enough, no need to add something else on top of everything.
That was true; Cas had tried many new things the last few months, and every time he had been scared. It always turned out fine, but it was always terrifying because he couldn’t plan how new experiences would go, and whether it would be a good or a bad choice… And with Dean, everything was new, but he wasn’t scared. For the first time, he even felt a very new feeling – a form of self-confidence – as he leaned in and kissed Dean’s cheek first, and then his lips.
“It feels really good. As if I had something off my chest. I felt as if I had been lying to them for years… I feel more valid now, too. Saying it out loud to my closest friends, and not to strangers on the Internet or members of this society here is very different. The next step will be to tell my family, I guess, or at least my parents and my sister, but… I don’t think I’m ready yet.”
All of this had progressively led Dean to stop flirting in bars, or at least not as much or as seriously as before, and had convinced him to download a dating app. Just to try when he had some time at the bunker. He hadn’t met anyone he talked to in real life yet, but he’d had some interesting conversations. Moreover, using this dating app had allowed him to explore new possibilities, consider options he wouldn’t have dared to in real life. Like writing on his profile that he was looking for both women and men.
“I’m sure he’ll be an amazing doctor,” Jack’s mother answered. “He’s really caring and soft with children! Anyway, we have to go, now, Jack has an appointment for a haircut in 15 minutes… See you next week!”
At 10, he finally decided to wake up again and get ready. He switched on the light, and noticed that Dean had left a piece of paper on the coffee table, and a plate with a few cookies. Dean had left a note for him. The idea made him smile, as he pictured Dean quietly searching for a pen, and writing it, probably thinking about Cas waking up. Dean was so caring.
Cas had come a long way since then. With Dean, but also in general. He had learned how to manage unplanned and emergency situations with the children at the CLCP. He had learned to manage his thoughts – up to a point. He had learned to talk to Dean without being intimidated by him – and now, he was the one getting Dean flustered! It was funny to see how the tables turned! Since then, he also dared to go to a party in a bar, to a LGBT+ society – on his own! Well, of course, he was still him, and still had his flaws, his first nature and instincts were to be anxious and afraid of everything, but lately, he had tried to go out of his comfort zone, and so far, he was pretty happy with the results. That was a good life lesson.
“Okay, I think we’re gonna start. Hello everybody! For those who don’t know me, I’m Jody Mills, from the sheriff’s office, and this is my partner, Donna Hanscum. We created the CLCP…”
“I see your teacher skills every week during tutoring, but I thought it was time to check them out for myself. You know, just to assess your pedagogy and your efficacy to determine whether I can leave the education of those poor children at the CLCP in your hands!” he said, pointing at the poker case. He hesitated for half a second, and then made his mind. Feeling bold, he looked at Dean, and punctuated his little speech with a wink.
It was still weird to hear Dean talk about Charlie: Cas knew they were friends, and Dean mentioned her regularly, but for him, they were from two different “universes” of his life. Dean mentioning her was like a crossover of two of his favorite shows.
It turned out that, while Cas wasn’t necessarily interested in having sex, he was actually very interested in cuddling. Not that Dean was complaining about it, of course. He was more than happy to finally be able to do something to help Cas deal with his nightmares and finally getting a night of peaceful sleep.
He was awakened by noises outside his room. He opened his eyes, blinked, and sat up looking around, trying to get back in touch with reality. He had fallen asleep without closing the curtains, but it was dark. He looked at his phone: it was 8, which meant Baltazar’s friends were already there. His roommate had sent him a text thirty minutes before: “pizzas are coming in 15, if you’re interested!” and then, twenty minutes later “pizzas are here!”. Cas grimaced slightly; he had planned to prepare some dinner around 6, before Baltazar’s friends arrived, and to eat in his room without having to small talk with the guests. He was tired and stressed for the next day and didn’t feel very social that evening. Unfortunately, he realized he was hungry, and would need to leave his room to reach the kitchen to prepare a sandwich or something. He grunted at the idea and grabbed his phone to scroll social media instead.
“Listen to me, you’re the most amazing guy I’ve ever met. I think you’re adorable, always trying to do your best, looking out for others. You’re brave, fighting against your fears, going out of your comfort zone, trying new things, even if it’s not easy for you. And most of all, you’re different from the others, and I’ve never felt this good with anyone else. You know, I’ve never really been in love before, and being with you, I feel like everything I thought I knew… isn’t right anymore. You make me question things, go out of my comfort zone, too, make my life way more interesting… And better. Cas, my life is so much better with you in it! I want to keep having movie nights with you, I wanna teach you how to cook, how to play poker, I wanna hear you talking about those documentaries you like, I wanna see you explaining English literature to the children, I wanna take you on dates, on real dates, this time, with both of us being aware of it, I wanna…”
“I spent the entire evening reminding myself that no, it wasn’t a date, and that I shouldn’t have any expectations or any hopes about it and…”
Cas tried to clean up, putting away the other games they had played during the afternoon, while taking regular glances at Dean, who was joyfully joking with the children. He was really adorable. Finally, Claire, the last child, left and Dean stood up.
“My supporter’s pack,” Dean grinned, proudly holding a bag. He took out a blue KU cap that he put on his head, and then a scarf he carelessly wrapped around his neck.
Friday evening finally arrived, and Cas was watching a documentary about space in the living room when the doorbell rang. He wasn’t expecting anyone, and Balthazar wasn’t home yet. Maybe his roommate had forgotten his keys? He frowned and stood up to open the door.
Dean was just so kind. Cas’ heart was melting. Even though he should have been the sad one, he was still thinking about Cas, trying to make him feel better, even though the whole situation has been triggered by Cas’ stupid question in the first place.
, he remembered why a relationship between both of them couldn’t have been possible in the first place. Dean probably read on his face that something was wrong, because he stopped talking.
fully himself. Everything was just happening so fast and he felt as if he wasn’t in control of anything. Probably because he wasn’t. Dean was the one controlling the situation. He was the one who knew the process. Cas didn’t really know what to think about it, but in a way, it was reassuring, knowing that he wouldn’t be alone in this new and unknown situation.
Cas quickly looked around, trying to keep calm and to analyze the situation. All the other children were really noisy, commenting on the situation, some of them starting to seriously worry, feeling that something was wrong. Jack was crying, still holding his knee, but if he just had fallen on the ground, the chances that he had only slightly scratched his skin were high.
“Perfect. I’ll see you next Friday, then? The game is at 8, but maybe we can grab something to eat before?”
Cas noticed Dean's change in tone and attitude, and although it was what he had originally wanted, he was almost disappointed. Even though they embarrassed him, and even though he didn't know how to react and respond to them, he liked Dean's flirty little lines. It was fun, and it was exhilarating in a way. No one had ever acted like that with him before, and he couldn't believe that this could happen to him, that someone would be interested enough, pay enough attention to him, to take the time to tease him and to flirt with him a little bit. Even though that was Dean's natural attitude and he acted that way with everyone, and even though, to Dean, Cas wasn't special, Cas felt special when Dean winked at him. Even though it was his thirtieth wink of the day, all the others addressed to different people, for Cas, it was the first.
Cas stared at the contents of his wardrobe, uncertain. What should he wear? Definitely not a formal shirt – he was going to meet the children in his group, not attend a seminar! But he would also probably see the parents, and he needed to look like he was serious and could be trusted with their kids. Once again, he knew it wasn’t such a big decision. Yet, he couldn’t decide.
“The water is still warm. Would you like me to get you a cup of tea, too? It's chamomile”, Cas offered.
He jumped and turned around quickly, feeling himself blushing, as if he had been caught doing something wrong. A thin girl with long red hair was looking at him in a very kind way.
Something else about Dean was bothering Cas: not only was Dean completely different from him, confident, social, easy-going, flirty, but he also seemed to like making sexual innuendos. Which was very very far from Cas. Even if Dean could be interested in him, he would probably expect a sexual relationship with him; that’s what guys like Dean were interested in, after all. Popular college boys who liked partying, flirting, and finding easy one-night-stands, to “have fun.” That wasn’t what Cas was looking for. At all. Sure, he wanted a boyfriend, he wanted a romantic relationship. But, unlike most of the other university students, he was not interested in any kind of sexual relationship. Therefore, he and Dean were clearly not compatible, since Dean seemed to like joking about sex – and probably not only joking.
“I always have felt some… fondness towards you, Dean,” Cas smiled. “A different kind of connection than the one I had with Sam, for example. But I always thought it was because of me rescuing you in hell, that it was linked to some angelic bond that I’d have with you. However, even as a human, how I feel about you is different than with other people. And much, much stronger than when I was an angel. And believe me, Dean, it was - and it still is - very confusing”.
Seeing Dean like that, losing his composure, stammering quite incoherently, trying to sound casual when his babbling was betraying his embarrassment, was surprising. It was exactly how Cas usually behaved himself! It was so far from how Dean usually behaved. Suggesting a simple friendly activity shouldn't have embarrassed Dean so much. It was the kind of thing he did all the time... Unless it wasn't a simple friendly activity?
“That’s fine, kiddo, your team was winning anyway!” said Dean, joining them after the last parents left.
“You stayed so calm, I was impressed! You know, you told me one day that you weren’t sure that you were really made to be a doctor, that you weren’t sure whether it was your choice or what you thought you had to do to make your father happy… But really, after having seen you with Jack, this afternoon… I have to say, Mrs. Kline was right, you’ll be an amazing doctor!”
Cas couldn’t help but smile. What great timing! He had been on the verge of having an anxiety attack, and Dean’s texts had arrived just in time. Was he supposed to answer? What was he supposed to answer? And
