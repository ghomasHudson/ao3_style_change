Sherlock and Rosie came into view in the front yard and John knew they could look in and see him through the now curtainless window.
He walked glumly back inside but was greeted by James, cleary in high spirits after his wife's visit. John had thought after Sherlock's departure that he'd want to be alone but as it turns out he was glad to see his friend.
"Bloody hell!" Sherlock swore and I put my hand to his mouth to silence him. It wasn't as though I wasn't thinking quite uncharitable thoughts myself. But we didn't want her to hear.
His boyfriend took the bottle of lube and squirted more than was necessary into his hand before wrapping that hand around his penis. Sherlock began a gentle stroke, up and down and John watched as his cock grew slicker and shinier from the lube. Sherlock seemed to know what he was doing, mimicking how he handled himself; a corkscrew grip, up and down, thumb occasionally swiping across the tip. Though he didn't so much as twitch, John did find that it was indeed highly erotic.
Believe it or not, and I hope you do, your admonishment that you wouldn't speak to me ever again if I didn't tend to Sherlock meant something. Because, you see I couldn't imagine a life without you.
busy." Harry grinned. "I hope you two realize what you've signed up for. You just promised her a call. Every night while you're away. She heard that and she's like a little elephant, unlikely to forget."
Which each "deeper" Sherlock was timing the movements of his fingers, thrusting forward and then making sure to graze John's prostate as he retreated only to do it over again.
"No thank you, I think I'll sleep a bit longer. I'll thank you not to let me adopt this lazy habit when we return home." He stopped perhaps hearing what he had said. "When I return-" Realizing that didn't make things much better Sherlock shut his mouth entirely.
Married life isn't so different from single life. We wake, go to work, we share lunch, we go back to work, we come home.
"I'm sure you'll endeavor to do your best." His boyfriend spoke trying to sound casual and failing. "Unless you don't want to?"
"You scared me. You shut me out like you always do and always did" She paused before adding. "Like I always did to you."
He just wanted intimacy, like Reggie had been talking about in group. All the things that happen around sex that people ignore or skip or forget about. All the things that bring people closer together in ways that really matter.
But he felt healthy and strong mentally and physically. And he wasn't afraid of Sherlock and he wasn't scared of something new. In fact, every part of him every single inch but the inches in question reacted with a hunger toward the detective. He'd wondered if maybe his last remaining scraps of what he'd thought was heterosexuality might put up a fight. But Sherlock's hands on his body, lips on his neck, groin pressed firmly up against him felt nothing but right. So if he wanted him, if they wanted each other, and if he was healthy, what the hell was the problem?
In a moment he was above me and while I had opted to wear pants to bed he had gone with nothing at all. His hunger for me was thrilling. It didn't take long to realize that Sherlock was what I liked to call passionately remote. There were things he didn't feel worth his time or consideration. But those that did fall under that category as worthy, he pursued them with a vigor that would have exhausted me.
"Yeah, yeah I do. Just be honest. Drop any bullshit you've got scripted and be honest. That's what matters to her."
"Are you back living with him? I imagine it must be difficult, the idea of staying in the house you bought with Mary."
They spent the next two hours touring some of the loveliest land he'd ever seen. Rocky, dirt trails, lush grasses, an old and silent forest that opened into a meadow until finally they arrived at a lake, placid, chilly and still. Throughout most of the trip John had been pointing out various sights enthusiastically and Sherlock, obliging to a fault had looked and nodded and agreed and pointed out areas of interest of his own. He'd even chattered on about a few experiments he'd done on soil erosion for a case a few years back. It wasn't quite as dull as pages and pages of studies on different types of ash but it was up there. Or at least, it would have been had he not been so please just to listen to Sherlock's voice. However, here at the water that all stopped, all the noise and prattling from either of them died down and they stood silently, staring and drinking it in.
John couldn't disagree. He was right. That was an apt description of them both and he felt a pang of guilt for the things he was still holding back from Sherlock.
I appreciate Hanah's help. She's near the top of a very long list of people I need to apologize to. The more I think about it the longer the list grows.
"You're navel gazing. You're focused completely on yourself. Your concerns, your upset, your misery. Now, I know you're not following the steps all that closely. More of the spirit than the letter, am I right?"
"Mmm, thank you, sweetheart. Now let me give you a proper goodbye." He slipped his free arm around Sherlock's waist pulling him in for a kiss. Sherlock placed his hand on his cheek as their lips connected, the fingers splayed in a gesture John had come to adore and what's more, count on.
John tried to collect his bearings and failed delightfully. Sherlock could tell he’d never experienced this before and felt a surge of pride. His gasps were louder, his moans longer and he just knew his cock was getting harder again as he tongued him. He changed focus for a minute giving a few passing swipes to his perineum his tongue flat and wet, his movements rhythmic. This went on for a few wonderful minutes that. he imagined, for both of them seemed like an eternity.Finally he noticed the quavering of John’s legs, the broken cries and torrent of swears interspersed with some of the loveliest pleas Sherlock had ever heard.
All was fine as Harry kissed her goodbye, gave a few more instructions and then kissed her again. It was about this time that John felt the little girl tense in his arms as she got wise.
"You're an arse." John said good-naturedly as he opened the fridge and peered in again. Somewhere behind his partner's experiments, there had to be some food.
"It's not a question most civilians would think about. But a wound to the shoulder is not something that would normally result in a medical discharge. What else happened?"
John entered the pub...the first pub he'd been inside in ages and scanned the room for his mate. He was exactly where he expected him to be; at a small table, in a corner, half in the dark. With a wide smile that he truly meant he hurried over and sat down.
“Well...for the longest time my best friend was a bloke named Duck. That was his nickname, that was what we called him. I didn’t find out why until later.” He closed his eyes for a moment. “I assume you’ve seen my CV?”
"Is it? Nocturnal penile tumescence feels different than an erection caused by arousal. Does it feel like morning wood?"
"In the event of what? A backlash? Oh, God, you don't mean a backlash at all." Suddenly it all became clear just what he was getting at. Deducing wasn't always all that fun. "You mean of me leaving you."
"You've grown a full beard and cut your hair." He said with undisguised disapproval or was it...distress? Or both?
"John," He said quietly approaching him, covering the distance John hadn't even been aware he'd been keeping him at. "My John." he said. That was all. Just "My John." And the damned tears started to flow. The sofa was behind him and he sat down with a thud, slumping back as it took his weight. Sherlock sat next to him and pulling him into his arms and then his partner, his lover, his love was holding his weight and not the couch. Sherlock lay back, length wise, on the sofa and John went with him, his head against his chest, Sherlock's hand in his hair. He fell asleep to the beat of his heart.
"Concerned. Thin." Sherlock said but only after making a soft little "Uhh" noise following the nip. He was only speaking in one-word sentences which John considered a triumph.
He was right of course, a fact he accepted much easier now than he might have months ago. Even detachment in the name of prolonging Sherlock's pleasure was still detachment. He nodded, kissed him again and decided to let his hips do what they wanted and left his mind out of the equation.
"You wanted me to grieve you as a liar and I hated you for that. I hated you for trying to take away someone that I loved
But now...now it was dark. Dark brown perhaps darker than that, edging toward black. His father had had dark hair, nearly black as well. And he was never sure what color Mary's hair really was. She'd liked blonde so much and he liked the look of it on her so she'd kept it. She looked like Mary, he could see her features written all over that tiny face.
“Yes and no. I stayed there for a long while but I was antsy and so was Duck. We both wound up getting jobs at a pub as security slash bouncers. Throwing out drunks, subduing people until the cops arrived. Using a bit of force when necessary.”
Thank you for absolutely everything, Molly. I can't say it enough and I doubt it will ever be enough.
"You're talking like you have options." She scoffed. "There's clean and there's not clean. That's it. John, call Hanah. Or better yet, go back to treatment."
"I'm rather delighted I don't bore you. There was a time you stalked about Baker Street with a harpoon whinging and shouting about not having a case. I don't think kissing would have stemmed the tide." John teased.
His knees on the bed on either side of Sherlock he decided to make the most of this angle and began again at the back of his neck. It wasn't anywhere near where his mate had said he was hurting and John could feel him starting to protest. And then he let warm, gentle fingers creep up just above that hairline and Sherlock went silent. Apparently, for now, he found it too nice to argue.
"What do you mean?" He asked standing very straight and very still by the sink. God, but he was a terrible liar sometimes. There were instances like these where John wondered how he had ever believed him.
"I told you, not a word!" John roared. "Now, I have been stifled in this long enough, by you and by Mary, not anymore. I have been told that my feelings on this don't matter. Well right now, today, for once, they do. For once, finally, I will have this out with you.
He reddened slightly. For some reason, it was a little easier to talk about the sex he'd already had as opposed to the sex he planned to have.
For a minute he just sat there even as the applause started. 30 days. Had it been 30 days? How had he lost track? How was he not keeping track? Was that a bad thing?
"Bloody hell..." I moaned in his ear. I was only barely coming down when he whispered with soft desperation.
He removed a small velvet box from where he'd kept it caged in his hand and opened it, delicately for John to see.
"Oh...well, you need help? I can make myself available, take her a bit here and there. You should have said something sooner, John."
"Ok, well, good because I'm not going to change. And because once you get out there the real work begins. This was just the warm up. Not long from now you're going to start the main event."
That was basically that. I spoke to the EMT's when they arrived, I spoke to the police and maybe two weeks later someone else was living in what used to be Nick's flat with brand new hinges on their door. But I kept thinking about Nick and seeing his face. The longer I thought about it the more I
been able to muddle through without you, you know." He said knitting his brows. "Somehow, poor idiot that I am, I've managed."
"Now, what we're going to do is change positions, ok? This was a bit ambitious on our parts anyway. We're going to go a bit more traditional. So, off you pop." He said giving his arse a light smack. "On your back for me."
"No, because he's Sherlock. Because from our talks I'm 100% certain that a romantic relationship is completely new to him. He doesn't know what to expect. I'm assuming it might, at times, be sensory overload for him. I'm trying to prepare for that."
"Still," She continued. "We did our best. And it all officially started after the IQ tests. We had a good idea what we were dealing with early on, especially with Mycroft. We knew he was bright before he spoke his first words. The data that we got then was invaluable."
"I think in AA our reach should exceed our grasp. This isn't to say we should be trying for the impossible or that we should ignore the daily steps and successes. But I'm a believer that this shouldn't simply be about rebuilding our lives. Sobriety should be about finding new purpose and new meaning in addition to the old. Alcoholism and addiction barrelled through and we allowed and helped it to ravage our lives. If our lives were, metaphorically, a self-contained little house, then this was a storm that blew through and leveled it to the ground. So, what do we do? We start to rebuild. And that's good. That's a big, hard job and it is to be admired and applauded, but, this is also a time to consider, do we want something more? Because if there is one benefit, one dark joy to be found in destruction it is that we can set out sights on constructing something new. So, do you have a new purpose? A new meaning? Is there something you'd like to try, something you'd like to do or learn or see? I don't want you to think in terms of big or small. And I don't want you to think in terms of something necessarily material. Now, I'm not saying a trip around the world wouldn't do everyone some good but I live in the real world, right here on this planet where we all have money problems and families issues and obligations. So, let's not focus on things like that. Let's focus on internal things, day to day things. Things that help to lift our spirit. Things that drive out the darkness. What's your new purpose? What's your new meaning?"
"Look, it doesn't give me any pleasure to say it. And when he shoots me down it makes me feel even worse."
"Sherlock, I've got some questions." I said against his lips. "Your answers will help me make some adjustments."
"I said, meet me for lunch. In a proper restaurant as opposed to some abandoned underground car park. Speedy's? Angelo's?"
The sat down on the stairs to the entry way, lights shining behind them but not nearly enough to battle against the night sky above. And what a sky it was, more rich and full than he had seen since he'd left Afghanistan. London had too much light pollution, you could stare upwards until the end of time and never catch so much as a twinkle. But here, everything was bright and glimmering with splotches of color he imagined were nebulae, a dotting of planets and a dome of stars.
"Nearest Tesco, please." He requested and was quickly taken to a location so close he could have walked. He exited the vehicle and entered the unfamiliar yet due to its predictable layout completely familiar store. Ticking off the ingredients from the recipe permanently fixed in his mind from many a childhood breakfasts with his sister he went from aisle to aisle grabbing the items for pancakes. 45 minutes later he was back in their flat and surprised at the level of relief he felt.
It had taken a bit of practice to get used to palming a cock that wasn't his own, but John had managed famously. Pulling Sherlock on top of him after he'd yanked them both down to the bed he unfastened his belt and trousers and slid his hand inside.
John thought of it as an even kiss. By that, he meant that no one especially initiated it or rather that they both did. Both their heads inclined to one another, both of their lips touched with the same tempered, nervous enthusiasm. Both of them wanted this at the same time.
"He'd never had a problem with alcohol before, to the best of my knowledge. I thought if he wanted or needed to indulge he was entitled. I believed it would pass. I didn't think life would be fine but I did believe it was a phase of sorts."
John was both overwhelmed by the prospect and in total agreement. It is your job to keep the passion and fire and spark in Sherlock's life. You are responsible for his happiness, his joy, you are his reason. On one hand, if he were to see all that written on paper he wouldn't just be horrified he'd be scared witless. Who would willingly sign up for that burden?
"Well, I'd rather we not just go hunting down some random woman and invite her in if it's all the same to you."
By March it was an ingrained habit and it even seemed to be taking some of the invisible pressure off his relationship with Sherlock. They could talk about anything and everything. But he never wanted to go back to burdening him the way he had done before. It wasn't right or fair.
"Of course I forgive you." He said after a silence that stretched far too long in John's mind but was likely only 10 seconds at the most.
I felt only shame after I hit you, hurt you the way I did. It didn't make me feel better. It didn't resolve anything. I'm sorry.
He had been wrong, as it turned out, with regard to the DT's. The cramps, headaches, nausea and vomiting he suffered after just a half hour in the back of the limo made him think he had been coasting on adrenaline. More than once he'd had to request that they pull over to a rest stop or worse just on the roadside so he could do an undignified evacuation from one end or the other. Just another layer to the disaster that had become his life. The remaining Jack Daniels helped a bit and though he sipped at it clandestinely he knew A) the driver was aware and B) didn't seem to care.
Sherlock saw the stubborn set of John’s jaw and the way the muscles in his neck flexed. It seemed clear he had enjoyed it. What he was unsure of was why he didn’t want to admit it.
His friend looked at him uncomprehendingly appearing both confused and exhausted by the question. In the end, he just ignored it.
He kept his voice low and even and heavy with all the genuine threat and danger he was feeling. At that moment, he meant it. In that moment, if provoked, if the needle moved just a bit more, he would make good on everything he'd just said. "To quote a movie you're likely too young to know or remember; I'll make you famous."
When you clutter my private messages and inbox with inane babble you prevent those who need help from getting through.
There was so much to do. Far more than they could ever tackle in one day. Eventually, they settled on Wotton Trail, a 5KM walk that took them through some of the most picturesque areas John had ever seen. They traveled along wooded paths, over small arcing bridges that covered brooks and ponds, through bright, natural gardens and in the shadows of dark, arching forest. There was no tour guide and no pace they needed to set. They took their time, stopping when they wanted. Sometimes talking, sometimes not, holding hands, snapping photos and just appreciating everything around them and each other.
Without another word, Sherlock grabbed a second jar of the Gallberry which John knew was for his brother.
"Not to mention I could have lost you. You're not a Neanderthal, I didn't think you'd be offended or angry but...discomfort can act as an unseen wedge, it can lead to erosion. One moment you and I might be standing side by side and the next separated by a great chasm. I could not and would not risk losing you."
The bills gripped in his hand had grown soft with sweat and he was crumpling them over and over again in his palm.
Sherlock's breath had caught in his throat audibly and John figured he was on the right track. In for a penny in for a pound he'd given the tip of Sherlock's cock a swipe with his tongue, tasting the saltiness of the precum there. It was different but not in the least unpleasant and in fact, it spurred him on. He'd placed his lips delicately around the head and bobbed slightly. A moment or two later, invigorated and highly turned on he'd let his mouth fully descend on his member taking more and more of him.
fault. Sherlock, truly upper class, truly a posh boy, somehow managing to apologize even when he had been done the wrong. So very, very mannerly in the face of John inexplicably yanking him in for a-
After they separated, after a bit of cleaning, a change of bedding and a quick snog-shower they were back under the blankets. Sherlock running his fingers through John's damp hair. It was relaxing and kept him just on that dreamy edge of sleep and awake. A tightrope walk of happy.
"Mrs. Hudson, I'm feeling really ropey. I think I'm just going to crawl back in bed if it's all the same to you." He said rising on unsteady legs to his feet.
It was now a ghost town, the houses having fallen into disrepair, the gardens overgrown, the Ferris wheel having never turned.
"I think that's what I want. You are a relentless, tenacious hard-arse and I like it...even when I don't."
"Of course you're tired. You never sleep, you never eat, you never rest. You spend your days downing those pills, working at the office and then running about with me. You're exhausted."
"And the penny drops." Sherlock said and it wasn't until later that John recalled the breathless quality of his voice.
John frowned. Even in his groggy state, he realized he had never heard Sherlock take such a conciliatory tone with his brother.
"Before we end for today, how do you feel about Family Weekend? People should start arriving tomorrow around mid-morning."
Sherlock nodded and didn't seem to need to be convinced of that fact which left John singularly relieved.
John was in no hurry to hang up but as the sunlight slowly infiltrated Sherlock's bedroom and as his mates blinks became slower and eyelids heavier he knew it was time for rest.
Sherlock's let out a soft little "Hmm" noise and then a warm sigh. He was more than half asleep by then and John took the moment to just stare at the face he'd missed so much. He was the same. Still the same. Always the same. And that was a relief when everything around John was in ruins.
I let myself zone out in the kitchen for a bit, thinking about everything and nothing and vaguely recall hearing the shower turn off. The faucet turned on and I assumed he was brushing his teeth. The door opened and I heard his footsteps come into the living room and then head toward the kitchen where I was.
He was rifling through the pocket of the jacket he'd worn last night. Having retrieved what he needed he headed to the loo beckoning me.
"You're right, John it is an all encompassing word and within that word is room for a lot of variations. People who are suffering from depression can manifest it in multiple forms, listlessness, irritation, violence, making sudden rash decisions. For instance, when did you choose to go to medical school?"
"Unattached like me." John said echoing a fond memory, an old conversation, a meeting that would change the trajectory of his life. "Have you ever been in love?"
A Saturday. He remembered a Saturday in fact where Sherlock said he had some business to take care of, business that didn't involve John or a case. John didn't push him on it and Sherlock seemed relieved. He honestly hadn't given it very much thought. No thought at all.
Sherlock watched as the doctor stalked out of the room before suddenly stopping and turning on his heel. With just as much purpose as he exited, he reentered, this time pointing a finger.
John was back in the forest, searing red hot but for once he felt he had a purpose. Instead of wandering aimlessly he was looking for something, for someone. It had to be Sherlock. He shouted out his name. It echoed all around him, bouncing off the thick dead trees which were thicker than normal. Not just their trunks but their numbers as well. There were so many he could barely move. But he tried and he kept trying and he kept calling out his name over and over and over again but he never got a reply.
"That would have been brilliant." He said before dragging his tongue along Sherlock's earlobe. "But don't stop touching yourself. Then what?"
Traditional. Upright. Polished black granite. Simple. Just your name. It took 90 days. That's standard. 90 days. 97 days since you died.
"I'll walk. I feel like walking." He grabbed his bag and shoved his laptop in it before downing his beer and heading for the door. "Leaving now, you can commence talking about me in whispered tones once you hear the door shut."
"Well go on then, she's calling for you. Didn't know why you were standing in the back like a stranger." Harry encouraged.
He started with a simple "Hi, Sherlock." But immediately erased it. It was well known to him that Sherlock ignored and deleted any messages that began with "Hi".
He and Sherlock took the bags and stroller from Harry and Sarah and carried them downstair. After hailing a cab and getting Rosie situated in a car seat both men kissed her goodbye. Sherlock pre-paid the driver and they went back upstairs.
"I was terrified of the Gooseberry Wife. I was actually mad for gooseberries as a boy and Mycroft told me that if I ate too many the Gooseberry Wife would come after me. I think he just wanted them for himself."
"No, not finally. I wasn't impatient. This isn't a relief. I'm just happy. For you, for me, for us. Just happy, with no other cumbersome weighted to the word."
He was looking at him now, straight on. Though John wanted nothing more than to look away from his piercing gaze he owed him this moment. This was the least of what he owed him.
"Do you want them there? Sherlock, all I want is for you to be happy. If having them there would settle your soul in a way then they should be there. My main concern is that they don't hurt you anymore. And I promise you, if I have anything to say about it, and I do, they won't. So, I mean this, in all sincerity, if you want your mum and dad there, invite them. There will be no scowls or evil eyes or even cold shoulders from me. I will be on my absolute best behavior."
I could have left. Any day, any hour, any moment. I will admit to you as I did to her one night, there was a part of me, an ugly, slithering part that wanted to torture her. To leave her guessing and gasping on tenterhooks like a fish on a line. I wanted it to hurt. I wanted her to feel unsteady, unsafe. It felt good to hurt just like when I was doing awful work with Duck. Just like when I hit Sherlock again and again and again. Just like when I pistol whipped a suspect. It felt good to dole out my judgment. The executioner doesn't wear a hood to hide his face, he wears it to hide his smile.
I am so drunk right now. Happy drunk, not sad drunk. Engaged drunk. Forgive and forget drunk. Peaceful drunk. It's good and nice.
With each relaxing inhale and exhale the tension left his body until finally Sherlock was fully inside him.
He was remarkably clear-headed for a reason he couldn't understand but he wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
When Sherlock had come home from Paris they seemed to forget about the sensate things. Once that horrible detox sickness was gone, hungry and lonely and missing each other they'd jumped into bed. But it had gone badly, as it tended to in those days and they'd wound up on either side of the bed, a cavernous divide between them.
With that, he stood up and left the house locking the door behind him and headed home to Baker Street and warmth and light.
Finally, we come to what shames me the most. I want to say, without reservation, that I would never frighten a woman, threaten a woman or put her in an ugly, dangerous position. The John Watson I was, a long time ago wouldn't. The John Watson I want to be wouldn't. But the John Watson I was then
But as so often happened with their plans there was an interruption. It began with reports of a jumper on Tower Bridge of which John's cabbie informed him of it as they sat in traffic on his way back to Baker Street that evening. Every car was moving along at a crawl and John reluctantly took his phone out to text Sherlock that he was going to be late. He immediately got a text in reply.
This is what I needed. I needed that pressure of him above me. Then we were kissing again, deeply passionately, only coming up for air when it was necessary.
They hadn't had sex yet. They hadn't really snogged properly yet. That heavy breathing, opened mouth, lips smashed against lips, hands grasping at everything, belts being hastily unfastened, grinding, grinding, grinding sort of snogging. The kind that ended with coming in your trousers because you didn't have time to pull them off.
"I want you to tell me how you feel when I put forward the idea that your sexuality isn't as clear-cut as you've imagined. How does the term bisexual sit with you?"
Momentarily frustrated by this lack of respect for his rules, Sherlock, Impulsively, gave John a harsh smack on the arse. The latter jumped in surprise and quickly turned his head to catch Sherlock in a narrow-eyed gaze that dared him to do it again.
"It's not exactly right, is it? Me sitting here complaining about a girlfriend who left me to a man who lost his wife." Duck said before clearing his throat. "I was a terrible mate to you, John. I didn't call. I didn't write. I have no idea how you coped in that year without her. I don't know how you're coping now. I think I thought...I don't know what I thought. Probably something similar to what was going through my mind when I scarpered the first time."
"You'll have to tell me if I'm doing this alright. First time and all with only movies for reference." He said before resuming his activity.
"When we first knew one another my father was. Now, I've inherited it and wound up needing it in a way I never imagined. It keeps me safe now, secure. I am grateful for the thing I tried to dodge for years. The only reason I'm in London is to tend to some business that cannot be conducted over the phone. But, back to the matter at hand. All those years ago you and I accidentally ran afoul of some very dangerous people. After they knocked you out with the butt of that gun I kicked you as hard as I could to get you to roll over. You were face down in a puddle and you would have drowned. They asked me why I did that. I explained and they said it didn't matter because they were going to kill us both anyway. I told them I had money. I told them I could get them whatever they wanted if they just let us go. Once I'd convinced them I wasn't lying we struck a deal. I told them I needed two weeks. Just two weeks to secure the cash. They agreed and they said if it took one day over a fortnight they'd take you and send pieces of you back to me bit by bit in the post."
"I'm sorry, are we arguing? I was done. Plus, I assumed you'd have to be running off for Mummy to tuck you in."
"Addiction at its heart is betrayal; betrayal of self and betrayal of loved ones. It may be difficult for them to trust you again. You should be prepared for that. You should be prepared for flare up's, angry conversations that may seem to materialize out of nowhere. But they're not out of nowhere, are they? You know that. We all know that.
Mary was nothing but sympathetic but he'd still been embarrassed. He used to be awakened by memories of the war, shots fired, shouting, running, chaos, injury. He'd shoot up in bed, heart racing both panicked and from and desperate to return to the action.
to have a large hand, larger than his own touching his face, cupping the back of his head, roaming his body, the answer was a resounding no. There were a thousand little things like that, the differences between the masculine and feminine. The lack of a difference between the need and want and arousal he felt for Sherlock and the women he'd been with. But none was more shocking than the fact that he could, in fact, enjoy himself without an erection. As much as he wished it to be otherwise he was as flaccid as ever. But he was still having a good time. Every touch and kiss and caress mattered, it registered, he felt something. Just not all that he wanted to feel but maybe it would do for now.
"Three Continents and Multiple Pairings Watson." He said with a raise of his brows. "Your nickname should be updated."
"Emasculated? Don't do that. Don't psychoanalyze me. Not everything is that fucking deep, Sherlock."
"He was short tempered, he was always angry, prickly, solitary except at the pub. And this is all, of course, besides the alcoholism and the violence. Even sober, stone cold sober there was just something about him that people didn't like. He rubbed them up the wrong way."
He sensed a change in the mood of the room when after a moment she glanced toward the closed bathroom door and suddenly went quiet.
"He was acting...badly. Putting on a show. He admitted that. And even if he had been telling what he thought to be the truth he was wrong. I decide what you mean to me, your value to me. Your priceless value."
The detective closed his eyes, the sound of the door rattled the frame and him as well. John’s anger was unexpected. He attempted to regain focus and go back to what he'd been doing. He had things to accomplish, things far more important things than soothing the fractured ego of...
Pulling away before either was satisfied John sank to his knees. He opened Sherlock's legs wider and without preamble took him in his mouth.
More silence, but definitely of the contemplative kind. Eventually he began to speak, that smooth voice emerging from the darkness.
"I thought it was shit. I was fine. The bullet went right through. But they said it wasn't just the injury, it was other things. I wasn't sleeping, I was volunteering for extra shifts at the hospital, extra patrols. I thought I was doing everything a good soldier would do and
"Fuck The Location. Are you so posh now? Some regular facility isn't good enough for His Nibs? Check yourself into a residential place and get your shit sorted."
"That's essentially what I figured. With Duck, I believe it was different. The trauma was concurrent with the relative stability. But in most other cases you pursue destructive behavior following a loss or sudden change, you drink or become highly promiscuous or both, indulgence leads to guilt, depression, a static period and a leveling out until the next time there's an external trigger. Does this sound familiar?"
The fantasy skipped ahead; Sherlock on his stomach, John sliding into him from behind. Tight, so bloody tight, thrusting, tugging gently on that thick curly head of hair. Watching his cock disappear between his tight cheeks, hearing them both moan softly, finally laying atop him, pressing his full body weight on his, kissing his neck, his shoulders, his ear, calling his name. "Sherlock, oh, God, Sherlock, I have wanted this for so, so long. Close, so close..."
In the end, the physical stuff wasn't what brought him down. He'd detoxed before at this point, more than once and it had a stomach-churning familiarity to it but a familiarity just the same.
Their first fully public kiss was initiated by Sherlock. In the back of a cab he pressed his face close and his lips closer. They were headed...actually John couldn't recall now where they were headed. He only remembered the kiss itself, and how it warmed him on that chilly night. He also remembered the cabbie's eyes widening as he glanced at them through the rear-view mirror. He remembered feeling slightly exposed.
"I am the manager sir," The young man said clearly gaining confidence as he spoke. "And what's more, I'm afraid I'm going to have to report this."
"And how is your daughter? How is Rosie?" She asked as she scratched off an item on the paper in her hand.
It was at that point that John had been forced to again retrieve the handkerchief and paw at his eyes, a movement that became quite frequent during Sherlock's vows.
He gave in. He retrieved the pills from their hiding place and declared the break both over and a failure. He downed four, dry and climbed into bed pulling the blanket over his head.
With Mary, well, to people on the outside he hadn't known her that long. They wished him congratulations but there was always a hesitancy in their eyes, something just on the tip of their tongues.
John swore softly, more than likely at the use of the word Captain in this situation and it thrilled Sherlock to no end.
"Elated." He said and felt his cheeks burn with the admission especially when Sherlock glanced at him. "Nervous, hesitant but more than anything just elated that he'd come."
Sherlock washed his hands silently before coming into the living room to sit in his chair. John took his seat opposite him.
Sherlock was a tall man, long-limbed but everyone looked small and pale in a hospital bed. And he was no different.
His boyfriend had them packed and on the road with impressive efficiency. He'd rented a car for the weekend and seemed pleased to drive, even opting for the slightly longer more scenic route. He was chatty at first and John was happy to engage in conversation, occasionally turning up the radio to sing along. But as they drew closer John noticed a change. As mile after mile racked up on the odometer Sherlock grew quiet, just skirting sullen.
John hurried down the nearest aisle and chose the shortest line he could, winding up behind an elderly woman who did a double take when she saw the commotion he brought with him.
"John." Sherlock said and there was a warning in it so subtle he was sure Lestrade hadn't noticed as he spoke at the same time.
For the first time, publically, I began a sentence with; "My boyfriend". I've done it with people who knew Sherlock and I obviously did it in the LGBTQ group and I've done it with medical professionals but never just...people.
He needed a distraction because everything around him was trying to pull his mind back toward the dark thoughts and the dark ideas of what might be crumbling around him. Everything wanted to pull him back kicking and screaming to that massive prison of weeds and bark.
He hadn't heard Sherlock approaching him but he had felt that tingling sensation rising on his skin.
She handed him the paper with her few items written upon it, patted his cheek and not long after he was on his way. Her needs were simple enough and he knew the layout of the store well enough so he figured this could just be a quick trip, in and out. Hanah had encouraged him to do this more than a few days ago and he'd meant to, he truly had. But when the moment came he typically arrived at some excuse or Mrs. Hudson was going out anyway and he could give her cash for a few things. Or, he'd mostly been making use of the delightful home grocery delivery service. Order online, flat delivery fee and they trekked up the flight of stairs and brought whatever they needed to the door. It was perfect. Maybe a bit on the expensive side but absolutely worth it. If Sherlock minded or had an opinion on it at all he hadn't said and that suited John down to his shoes. But now was the time to actually do this the old fashioned way, the way he'd been avoiding. But it would be fine. It would all be fine. He'd get his feet wet back in the real world, satisfy Hanah's requirement and knock out their shopping needs all in one fell swoop.
"Long time wife and now widow of one of Britains most notorious and prosperous drug dealers, Frank "The Shank" Hudson. She owns two luxury automobiles-"
"That's because I fear you are spinning out of control. I had foolishly believed that given time you might stop on your own. I let my esteem and affection for you cloud the fact that you too are an addict. And while alcohol was never a problem for you before an addict is always in pursuit of a new way to get high."
His boyfriend went back to kissing his legs and thighs and it did feel good. Everywhere Sherlock touched him always felt good. Damned if the bite hadn't rooted him more firmly in the moment.
There it was. The first of many questions John anticipated but still had no idea how to answer without cracking open a can of worms.
John leaned in and kissed him. It was rather quick as he wasn't certain Sherlock could handle much more. The kiss was returned in kind and then his partner simply embraced him. He felt his body shudder for a moment and again wanted to press on and figure out just what had frightened him so badly. Why had he changed his mind? But he imagined all would be revealed in its own time. Or at least he hoped.
"No, I mean, always as in always. For as far back as I can remember. My favorite nights are nights when I don't dream." He frowned a bit as he realized how that must sound but Hanah didn't recoil so he tried to put it behind him.
Let's not play at this. You know, just as well as I do, we have apparently been entangled romantically for years.
The paths were clearly marked by yellow signposts and knowing this wasn't exactly either of their forte's he chose the easiest road.
He suspected that Sherlock felt freer saying it to a drunk man who wouldn't remember hearing it the next morning. And John supposed he felt safe saying it for the same reason.
Fifteen minutes later Sherlock was flat on the bed, John between his legs with as much of his cock in his mouth as he could fit.
When John had first told him that Mrs. Hudson could hear them and hear them very well he'd blanched. It had taken quite a lot of coaxing and soothing, gentle teasing to get the normal colour to come back to his face.
"She absolutely adores him." Clara said coming over to them. John leaned in and gave her a hug and kiss on the cheek but his eyes remained on Sherlock who was now sitting cross-legged on the ground with Rosie on his lap.
"You look a little tired, John. And that's just what I can see through the camera. Are you eating properly?"
"Please, just let me finish. Once she saw she wouldn't be moved. They were much more raw then, practically brand new. She told me to stay right where I was and not to move. I was in so much pain I didn't have the energy to argue. She left and came back with salve and antiseptic and bandages. She cleaned me up and covered my wounds and...But that's not the point. Or rather it is the point but not the only one. When Mycroft came to get me out of Serbia, when we were back on safe soil he suggested I come back here, home, to our parent's house just for a day or so. He'd provide me with all the papers and equipment and surveillance footage I might need to keep an eye on the terror group. Everything to get me up to speed. He thought a mother's touch might be just the thing after what I'd been through. It's always easier for us to agree on who and what she is when we're not within close proximity. I was going to go. I got into a car to go, I was on my way but the closer we got the worse I started to feel. The more convinced I became that she would only exacerbate the situation. In the end, I had the driver turn around and take me back. I went directly to Mycroft's office, got a shave, a new suit, my marching orders and the address of where you'd be dining that evening and that was that. He didn't even question why I'd come back. He knew. Alright. You can ask me now."
"I'll help you make adjustments, John." he said and I felt his fingers brush against my cock through my pants.
This time when he spotted James he did join him briefly. He smiled and met his wife, shook his hand, talked him up a bit and then hurried back to Sherlock.
"I know you don't believe me. But you will." He said with that Sherlock confidence. "Now, finish your fantasy."
Of course, Mycroft knew. John was aware he'd been tailing him this whole time, he remembered the fight he'd overheard between the brothers. He had been expecting, waiting for this moment. Witing for John's inevitable collapse because that was what people did. They folded like a house of cards and no one knew that better than Mycroft.
He was tired and wounded and hurt. He'd just had the best nights sleep since 2014 and it happened to be in the arms of a man. And he didn't intend on wasting one more breath shooting down rumors about whether or not he and his best mate were sleeping together.
While this was true he did need to reach out to Mike. He hoped perhaps he had a job he could apply for or that at the very least he could put out some feelers. Things were getting a little
When they ended John exhaled a shuddering breath and Sherlock did much the same. They'd had their share of high emotional moments over the past few years, this felt like a peak and a good one.
Kneeling down he took his wedding picture out of his pocket and called her over. She'd gotten distracted by a ladybug on the windowsill in what used to be their old bedroom but she hurried to his side.
She smiled and immediately joined him and the dream was real enough that he felt her weight in his arms and the warmth of her skin.
"I guess I slip into them naturally. You don't have to force anything though. I've always like how you say John."
I saw him jump to his feet quickly but I didn't see the swift movement that followed. In fact, it took me a moment to realize what had happened and this was even after I heard the mug shatter against the wall and crash to the floor.
Clearing his throat, he began."When I saw you last, before the rooftop of Bart's we were in the lab and I got the message that Mrs. Hudson had been shot. Now, clearly, in hindsight, this didn't make any sense, this was all orchestrated by you to get me out of the way." He jutted a finger at Sherlock surprised at how things anger rose so easily to the surface, surprised and a little frightened.
Christ, but he hoped soon the day was coming when he'd get to ride him in this chair, just like this. Bouncing on that hard cock of his until-
happy. Absolutely surprised and shocked but happy. I know it was the same for Mary too. We went on our honeymoon and were like We're actually going to do this, aren't we? Just dive right in. I'm totally not ready but yeah, let's!
Pressing in a bit farther and curling his finger upwards he found it. As a doctor, he'd located his fair share of prostates for exams but this was certainly the first time in this particular situation. The reaction wasn't exactly immediate but he watched that cessation of breath again. This time Sherlock hadn't stopped breathing because of pain, quite the opposite. John watched as the tension left his face then his body as a whole, his legs fell a bit more loosely open and with each rub and press with the pad of his finger started to moan softly. Precum pooled on the tip of his cock before drizzling down the shaft making the movements of Sherlock's hand that much slicker.
"Ok, I won't worry about it now." Glancing at the time on his mobile he saw it was nearing 5pm. "I guess we should be getting back. It's nearly time."
"I wouldn't see an issue with that. The kissing, I mean, not the shoving your tongue down...well, you know what I mean. My point is, I'm not as prudish as you imagine me to be, John."
Luckily, the script was a quick fill and he was back in the car, then back in Baker Street and finally back in bed as fast as he'd hoped. He didn't even remember falling asleep but the next thing he knew Sherlock was kissing the back of his neck as he settled into bed behind him.
"I have a bag packed and a car ready to drive us there waiting just past the gate. It's all arranged."
But he was also jealous of it and sometimes that security read as smugness and it made every bit of him clench up in anger.
John raised his gaze from the laptop which he had only been staring at blindly and glowered at his partner. Sherlock for a moment seemed taken aback by the anger he saw on his partners face but recovered soon enough.
"I won't be a part of this." "Mary" said and stood petulantly outside the pharmacy refusing to go in. He left her there, stepped inside and navigated his way to the counter. He hadn't been in this particular store before but it was a chain and they were all built the same. Same lighting, same products, same uniforms, same people. There was no one in front of him, no queue at all, so he stepped right up and passed the slip of paper he'd hastily scribbled minutes before across to the waiting man.
"Everything. Everything you want to say. Everything you wanted to text him and ask him. If he's a reasonable man who cares or cared as deeply for you as I can see you do for him then he'll respond. He wanted you here and convinced his brother to make it happen. That speaks to me of a man who will answer what you ask and, if your relationship is over, be willing to give you closure so you can move on."
"Hey, you know I can drive. I'm not sure how much of the trip is left but I'm more than happy to split the time."
Something about that voice made him cock his head and look at them more pointedly. Or at least he tried to look through the wet sheets of snow.
The room was silent for a solid 30 seconds. John didn't want to meet either of their eyes. Those feelings weren't as distant as he might have thought. He recalled holding the pen and he recalled the shaky hand he used to write those letters. he called the despair and the depression and the sickness and the craving and the numbness and the brokenness that he felt in those moments. he recalled being swamped by it, carried away, soaking, struggling, sinking in it. He recalled this part of him that somewhere was still there, negative and raw and howling to be soothed. The second go at rehab had helped and so did Hanah and meetings and Eric, and writing and Sherlock. They all helped but it never really went fully away. That's why he was recovering. That's why he would always be recovering.
The feeling of anger from earlier started to return. Anger at having his space threatened, his privacy, his dignity. Anger at having people so bloody invested in what was now his public life. Anger at how he brought so much of this on himself. Anger at-
He held it together until the service ended. Then he stood at her casket and place his hand on the smooth wood of the lid. She was there. Inside. Sealed off from him forever. He burst into tears for a moment but no one rushed to his side. If Sherlock had been there...
"Want some breakfast?" John asked slipping both his hands in the morning mess that was Sherlock's hair. He let his nails graze his scalp, rubbing, massaging and sometimes tugging his curls gently. The response was immediate. Sherlock's blinks became slower and John was sure he was nearly on the verge of purring with contentment.
The conversation stopped. They were approaching the checkout lane and things had to slide back into reality.
When Sherlock hit his prostate John moaned loud enough that in retrospect he worried Mrs. Hudson had heard. But in the moment he didn't care. He shot his hand backwards, grabbing hold of his lover's arse just to hold him there, still him, to preserve that feeling because good God nothing had ever felt that good.
The more he touched and held and tasted Sherlock the more memories of buried fantasies came back to him. He never would have acknowledged it at the time. Not ever. But his mind always moved faster than he could censor it. He was always racing to catch up and bury that imagery back in his subconscious. But every now and then over their years together it had leaked out. Usually before bed or in some half remembered dream, but sometimes during a case, during dinner, watching Sherlock's little frown of concentration as he worked. And John's brain would hit the ground running. Yes, he had thought more than once about sucking his cock. Lips and tongue to hard, hot flesh. It was always brief, just a flash, barely a whole image before he made it stop, but it was there.
It wasn't going to last long and it didn't. He came first, his body going stiff beneath me only starting to relax as I came against him with a long groan.
"Speaking of, I understand what Hanah said, that I'm not to be your sobriety minder but I had a spare moment and gathered together a list of local AA meetings. I've listed them in terms of near to far but also made accompanying lists ranking religious affinity, volume, men to women ratio, convenient times, days of the week, open and closed meetings, LGBTQ acceptance, and freshness of coffee. I've emailed it to you and also printed it out."
You had all these pillows lining the wall at the bottom of the stairs and the laundry basket at the top. It's funny how neither of us thought this was a bad idea at the time! We both piled in and you sent it careening down the stairs and we crashed into the pillows laughing and then we reset the soft barrier so we could do it again. I lost track of how many times that happened but by the end of it all after we'd cleaned up and you helped me wash the flour off my face I knew that what we'd had was better than any carnival on earth. If I didn't tell you so then I'm telling you now.
Of course, they invited her to the wedding, appropriate or not. And appropriate or not, she accepted.
“Oh don’t be daft, John. There’s no such thing as ghosts. She’s waving at you.” She replied but there was something mischievous in “Mary’s” gaze that gave him pause. Still, he waved at Rosie who grinned and raised both hands in his direction. Had she
John laughed and turned his head to kiss him properly before saying. "I'm going to take her to the loo and get her cleaned up."
John left his friend where he lay on the bed and went into the bathroom. He changed quickly, barely sparing a passing glance to the face that grinned back at him in the mirror. He came out and closed the door softly behind him. Sherlock had neatly placed the food on John's bedside table. He'd eaten a little and that was honestly more than John had expected. But then again his friend seemed both tired and spent and that historically meant pliable.
deal. None of it negative, all glowing in fact. All about how she could tell, even though things had been strained and stressed what a lovely and amazing marriage they'd had.
I stood and immediately headed towards the window, opening it as wide as it would go. The room smelled of sex, a bit stale, but honestly I wasn't complaining. I looked back at the bed, smiled at the beautiful mess we'd made and started to tug the sheets and covers off. I carried them to washer, threw them in, added the soap and turned it to hot without actually turning it on. I didn't want to take away his water pressure. By the time I'd emptied the trash, grabbed us a few bottles of water and retrieved new bed linen from the cupboard he was done.
He entered him slowly, enjoying John already pleading for more. Once he was fully sheathed inside him he’d wanted to take a moment, catch his breath and steady himself but the doctor had other ideas. He started to grind back against him, working himself on Sherlock’s cock demanding the detective spring to action. With no other option Sherlock put his hands on the doctor’s hips, guiding his moments, doling out the pleasure as he saw fit. To his surprise, yet again, John seemed willing to submit, and when he was committed to the rhythm established Sherlock removed one of his hands and placed it in John’s hair.
"No, not nonsense. For the time being I live here. That means I know better. I'm really not hungry but you're right...I have been thinking about something for a good chunk of the day." He inhaled deeply before continuing. "What if we told each other the truth, you and I? Once and for all?"
"Alright, let me phrase it a different way. A way that you're not going to like. Why do you feel responsible for taking care of Sherlock Holmes?"
No matter the nightmare, though, no matter the scenario; it's never him. It's only the people he loves the most who suffer, who are punished. He always lives. Always. They die and he is left alone, mourning and frightened out of his wits.
"Yeah, you did. I can tell. Look, it's not that I doubt that you couldn't do exactly what you just said. It's that I know you won't. It would have been much more efficient to kill me in the hospital, or kill me in the months that lead up to my...breakdown. I'm sure you could have pulled a few strings to make my section permanent. Involuntary commitment. But you didn't. You had chance after chance and you didn't. I won't pretend that it's out of some deep admiration for me. It's because you love your brother and you can't bear to hurt him anymore than you already have. And on top of that you can't bear to lose him which you would."
He glanced down at his body, wanting to see from this angle Sherlock's arm and where it disappeared between his thighs, wanting to see the twitch of muscles as they worked. He was instead, however, absolutely shocked to see that his cock was flushed, half hard and leaking like a sieve onto his abdomen.
He'd glanced his prostate just right, just so spot on and Sherlock was beginning to come undone. Another thrust at the same angle, the same tightness, the same clenching, the same slick heat and John too started to unravel. He thrust a bit harder, upping his rhythm pulling his lips away from Sherlock's neck to share a kiss.
He woke up in the middle of the night, spooning Sherlock and hard as a bloody rock. And not the type of hard that showed any possibility of dissipating any time soon. But persistent demanding hard that was only going to go away with a cold shower and a firm hand. As far as he knew his mate was asleep and he'd like to keep it that way.
There was no hiding now as Sherlock's room actually got a decent amount of sunlight. John wanted to take advantage of the view but also didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable.
As expected it was 90% cases with a good dose of snark when he felt his patience was being tested or his time wasted. There was the random proclamation of "Bored!". But every now and then there was a picture of a flower or a bumble bee or just some random prettiness he had come across during his day. Those he hashtagged #CaptureTheLovliness. Of all the things John imagined would or could stick, that wouldn't have been it. Which was likely why it made him incredibly happy.
Rosie had her head facing him, her cheek on the mattress. With a little hand, she reached out and touched his cheek. The gesture was enough left him practically undone and he pressed his lips together to gather some pretend composure.
He was cut off suddenly as Sherlock positioned himself in front of him, raised his chin and kissed him.
He felt safe admitting it to himself now in a way that he hadn't before. He was excited. Not to see Sherlock's parent's, not exactly. But...he was excited to be
It had been two weeks and they hadn't mentioned it. Hadn't acknowledged that it had even happened. Life had continue on in self-imposed blissful ignorance.
"Morose, depressed, unfocused, unreachable...untethered. His thinking became scattered, careless. He didn't want to admit it, of course, but I knew he noticed when he casually began mentioning his cases to me."
“John, I...please...-” He said tugging at his arse again, fingers digging pleasantly into John's flesh.
He'd spoken to doctors and psychiatrists and had test upon test both psychological and physical. Eventually, the straps had come off and again he'd presented himself as a normal, semi-functioning man. Or at least he'd tried. He admitted to severe depression. He admitted that he was passively suicidal but that it wasn't serious stressing he hadn't actually taken the pills. Though, that argument was lessened by the note he'd left on the door. He claimed this was a wake-up call and he intended to seek out treatment and he was grateful to still be here. Of course it was a lie but in the end, they couldn't keep him. He was no longer a danger to himself. He was sober-ish. He was free to go. He was alive.
Harry purposefully kept her focus on the top of Rosie's head as she whispered soothing nonsense to her.
Thinking back on it now as he sat in the infirmary with a blood pressure cuff seeming to slowly squeeze the life from his arm, John burst into exhausted tears.
John wondered if his partner would be able to say all this with the bedroom lights on. He'd noticed Sherlock was freer more unguarded when he felt protected by the darkness. That was alright with John for now at least.
"And I'll thank you not to blame me for your pathological feelings of inadequacy." Was all his boyfriend said in reply before engrossing himself in the contents of his laptop.
"It was my pleasure, truly it was." She replied before turning to John. "John? And believe me, though I appreciate Sherlock's praise, that's not what I'm asking for. How are you feeling?"
He took a deep breath. “There were parts of this book that made a lot of sense whether I wanted it to or not. And I really didn’t want it to.”
"You would be very special indeed if all your inner conflict was resolved so quickly," Hanah said with a smile. "It's a process, John, like any other. It's going to take a lot of time and you'll find that there are points where it intersects with your addiction and points where it veers off in the other direction. That is fortunately or sometimes, unfortunately, the nature of being human. Everything is entwined with everything else. But if this is who you are and who you want to be then you're on the path to embracing it and that's not a bad thing."
depressed. I stopped working at the pub after awhile, it just didn't seem right after Duck left. I kept up at the newspaper because I could do that in my sleep. He left me enough money to keep the rent up for a while but I hated staying there without him. It was too quiet, too lonely. I just spent my nights in our...
Sherlock's fingers were flexing, alternating between grabbing handfuls of the pillows and splaying widely.
"I don't know if I'm qualified to judge. In hindsight, it doesn't seem like too much. I was 19 and I'd just been dumped by my best friend."
I told you I was so alone before we met. So alone and so unhappy and you showed me things...a life I didn't know was possible. I can't repay what I owe you. I can't repay what you gave me.
"You can't just do that!" he shouted and now I wasn't the only one fuming. He tried to push past me but I slammed him against the side of the car.
I awakened first, a few hours later. He was still at my side, and though he was spooning me I assumed he was dead asleep face no doubt serene and smushed into a pillow. We'd made a warm little enclave of our own under the blankets but between the wet spots, dry spots, sweat spots and lube spots, we needed to get up, at least for a bit.
This he could do and in fact he wanted John to be the object of desire. It would be an interesting test of his limits to see how far he could go, how long he could last before jealousy got the better of him.
"I'm not sure, I just...lose it.. Then it becomes more..." He gasped softly. "More about getting it over with."
All that aside, the meeting went much like any other. That was, after all the point of AA; uniformity. A meeting here should be the same as a meeting in the States or a meeting on the moon. That was the comfort and predictability of it all.
"Yeah, in fact I want you to find a case now. I want to be out on the streets with you doing something tomorrow. Maybe even as early as today."
"But I did. I thought perhaps my chaos was not beneficial to your recovery. I can't promise it will stay this way, in this state of immaculate disuse. I'll still need to conduct my experiments but we no longer need to live in squalor."
"Well, I'm sorry if my fashion sense and grooming skills aren't up to par for you." He said rising to his feet. He was trying to keep his anger in check. Heading to the fridge he opened it and leaned in. "Want something to drink?"
The hour went by quickly and John was actually a little disappointed when it ended. This had been exactly what he needed on a topic so relevant it stung.
"Of course." She took Rosie easily and when the little girl began to whine for her coloring book he passed it over as well.
"That's right a year of celibacy while you get yourself sorted out. This is a little flexible and largely depends on how your relationship with your addiction and sex has intertwined. For those of you currently involved, well, it's just going to take time. Vexing, yes but also perhaps the best thing for the two of you. You'll have to work up to it, with dating, conversation, gestures, touch, attention. It can be as simple as a good night kiss, a stroke of a cheek, a head on a shoulder. Remember the simple things, remember every time you hold a hand, embrace, feel a heartbeat you're rebuilding your life together. That's worth the effort and it's worth the wait.
He reached for Sherlock's hand with one of his own and with the other he opened his phone and rang for an ambulance.
The Weald was an old forest, ancient according to what he was reading on his phone. Prehistoric hunter-gatherer had used it for farming, clearing the wooded land, but by Roman times it had been regrown only to be slowly encroached upon again as the forest was decimated for shipbuilding and forest glass. This was it seemed its tale, its cycle.
"But oh, when he came back from seeing you he started playing his violin again and taking cases and I even caught him singing once or twice."
"It is a very lovely. It'll fit in nicely with the cocks you have displayed on the sill." His father insisted.
"I had a seizure." John snapped his fingers near his head for emphasis. "Light's out. Didn't get a chance. Woke up in the hospital and was
Despite being fired he and the clinic had parted on relatively good terms. He didn't expect they'd rehire him but he'd likely still be able to manage a halfway decent recommendation. If that was what he wanted. Was it?
"Of course, I love him. But John has a tendency to not want to address problems until they have grown so exponentially large they cannot be ignored."
"Oh, yes." he said before brutally fluffing a pillow. "The books I read specified that someone returning from rehab should be greeted with a warm, clean and uncluttered environment"
"I just noticed you've been getting up every now and then during the night. I don't mean to be some sort of bladder watcher, I mean you can use the loo as often as you like but if you were like sneaking away to get a break from me. If I snore or elbow you in your sleep or kick like a racehorse or something please tell me. Mary always said I was as still as a corpse when I slept...unless I was having a nightmare. But, you know, things change."
It was a cowardly, small, shitty thing to do and he felt nauseous as he pressed 'Send'. But he did it anyway.
In an effort to test what it would feel like I did a test clench around him and he moaned immediately in response. He shifted inside of me, hitting my prostate in just the perfect way and I moaned myself.
"Oh yes." John said before propping up and reclaiming the jar of honey. He unscrewed the top and dipped a finger inside.
"I think we were going to get better at that, as time went on. I've been reading a bit, you know. We weren't
"No! You wait a minute. Now I agreed to this because you agreed to take it seriously. To put as much effort into it on the outside as you did on the inside at The Location. But you haven't done that. You haven't even remotely held up your end of the bargain. You have lied to me and the people around you and yourself. You're clearly abusing a substance perhaps substances. You've stopped going to meetings. You haven't sought out a therapist, you haven't delved into the reading material. You haven't been doing the work. You're not moving forward and you haven't even been trying. I have been doing this as a favor to you. And perhaps because I let personal feelings cloud professional judgment. I like you, John. I think you have the potential to be a very good man. But I'm ending this session now because I want you to think about what you want and need from this, from me, from yourself. You need to be honest with yourself, you need to admit that you need help, again. You need to admit that you are in the 50% - 90% of people who relapse. You need to enter a program, preferably residential, you need intensive therapy, you need to be open to medication and you need to deal with every unanswered issue that populates that Red Forest."
The groans coming from his lover's mouth were loud and deliciously sinful. But how could he not be sinful with that resonant voice, those beautiful lips, that pale, gorgeous body, that slim frame, those articulated fingers working with an even grace John had thought was reserved only for his violin.
"One of the conditions of him placing you in here was that I sever our contact. A stipulation he seems under the impression I agreed to and I assure you I did not."
There was no one to call. Or rather no one he dared call. He wanted to phone or text Sherlock but had no idea what his friend...ex-friend would say. Rather, he had an idea what he’d say and the last thing he wanted to do was hear it.
"Probably because I tried to kill myself a few days before winding up here." John said and for the first time in a while, he laughed at the absurdity of it all.
He was speaking a mile a minute, his brain working almost a bit too fast for his mouth. As for me, I was out of words and instead I slammed my fist against the wall by his head as a warning. A warning for what I didn't know yet.
"Yes, you know, tiny little colorful boxes that are too small for anything useful except even smaller items that are made specifically to fill little useless boxes. Oh and roosters. She loves little wooden roosters. Basically, anything you might find in TK Maxx; some strange ceramic pineapple or a hand painting of a cockatoo would be sure to make her squeal with delight."
He needed to sit and think. He needed to shake off the weight and the anguish that had settled over him at the idea of breaking Sherlock's heart one last time. He needed to forget the look on his face as he poured out his disenchanted heart. He needed to let that go to do this right.
"Yeah, I can't exactly afford The Location on my own, can I? And I think the Mycroft Scholarship fund has dried up."
I'll stand there before friends and family and Mary and God and you... and I'll tell the truth. I won't be lying. I do love her.
"I know they're not." He said simply. His voice was low and weary. He leaned his head back against the trunk of the tree and closed his eyes.
"Just...let me think about what I want to do, alright?" John asked before adding hastily. "This isn't me going back on moving to Baker Street. Odd as it sounds, they're unrelated."
"Not for a moment." Reaching a hand back he placed it in Sherlock's hair urging him closer. "Please don't stop."
Not too much tonight after yesterday's rather large chapter. Just a snack of sorts to tide you over, but still, something that I believe moves the story along. I'm hoping to get more done over the weekend but those are famous last words aren't they?
"Of course we can." He said peering out and motioning for John to come along. "Just give me a few days to up my intake of fruit. I'll need to pry some mangos from Mrs. Hudson."
"Why else would you have a bottle of lube that was a fourth empty, Sherlock, if you didn't have a toy. You're not the only one who can make a deduction."
Someone in the room was panting and whining and it took John a few moments to realize it was him. Using his imagination he pulled back from the experience briefly to picture how they looked on the bed. Sherlock flushed to the tips of his ears, whispering soft, lovely, filthy things in John's ear. His long arm strecthed between quivering, sweaty thighs. His finger vanishing again and again inside John's tight hole. John's hand first in Sherlock's hair, as always tuging on those curls, then quickly switching to holding and stroking his forearm, raising his hips up towards it, hanging on for leverage and dear life. He would have envied the pair he envisioned on the bed if he wasn't one of them. The brief fantasy had allowed him some distance from the feelings building in his body but once he returned they were nearly off the chart.
He had been speaking non-stop. Or at least it felt non-stop. It was as though once he started he couldn't end it. Something was snowballing and his sleep-starved mine had set it in motion. This didn't feel good. It didn't feel good at all.
But grace, it seemed, was in short supply, because now he was the poor stupid fool and it was all his own fault. He was humiliated but the last thing he wanted to do was just hang around outside the building of his former employer looking confused, angry and just a little weepy. He hailed a taxi, got in and asked him to take him to the nearest Nando's.
“No, no go on inside. It's madness out here. I’ll be there in a second. Go inside." He said waving him away.
John had pulled himself together and then he, David; the bloke Mary's used to date, Major Sholto, Mike Stamford, Greg and Janine wrapped their palms around the brass handles of the casket and lifted it up, carrying it at waist level. A female pallbearer was odd, but not unheard of. If things had been as they should have been Sherlock would have been the sixth. If things had been as they should have been Mary wouldn't have died.
