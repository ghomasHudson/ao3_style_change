“Hey“, Cas says and pushes himself up so he can sit comfortably.
They've been living in this apartment for seven months now and settled into a comfortable routine with each other. Dean is out and about more than Castiel who prefers to work at home in silence when he doesn't have class.
Dean smiles at him and Cas' chest tightens. He blushes and leans forward to hide his face in the crook of Dean's neck.
He opens the windows, changes his sheets, dusts off his desk.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
He stops talking when he realizes Cas is staring at thim.
Cas is afraid to open his eyes, to shatter that fragile moment between them. He feels Dean gently stroking his cheek and after a second he meets his gaze.
When he takes a break to make himself another pot of coffee, he suddenly feels dizzy and has to hold onto the kitchen counter to not fall over.
“Very funny. But I'm fine, thank you for asking.“
“I don't know, she's under a lot of pressure I think. You know, with all the responsibility...“
“Woah, what's happening?“, Dean asks.
Cas stops breathing. Dean's body is warm against his and Cas can only sit there, his mind completely empty.
“I'm sorry, I think I already said enough. Just … talk to him, okay? Like, really talk to him.“ She sounds like she's smiling.
He clicks on it and deflates slightly when it's only a confirmation that his paper arrived and is being graded now. Cas hates the nervous waiting every time.
The room is spinning, but this time in a good way. Dean's mouth is so soft and Cas never wants this moment to end.
They eat in silence for a moment before Dean says: “Maybe you should rest for at least one more day, you know, to fully recover.“
“Okay, I've known Dean for quite some time. And I know he has a problem with talking about his feelings and whatever. But you know that he is very caring and loving. But he can also be insecure about it.“
He sighs and gives in – the smell of the food is irresistible.
'Dean smells nice', his brain helpfully offers and Cas groans and covers his face with his hands.
He tries to think about something else, but Dean is the one thing that comes back to his mind again and again.
Cas rubs a hand over his face. “Uhm, okay? I mean, I was really sick, so...“
Cas needs a moment to realize that Dean has just asked him a question. “Uh, yes. Sure.“
“Sorry, I probably shouldn't have, I just thought-“
Dean turns on the TV and the next hour Cas is working while his background noise is people talking, fighting, music playing and occasionally Dean laughing.
“Why are you telling me this?“, Cas asks quietly. His mind is racing and he feels their conversation steering onto something real and frightening.
Cas shakes his head and sighs contentedly.
“I'm going to bed“, he announces and tosses his beer bottle into the trash.
“Bobby let me have a day off. He said I had earned it.“
Cas nods. He knows Jo, Dean's childhood friend, a blonde and fierce woman who can even drink Cas under the table. Cas likes her.
Cas stares at him for a second, then nodds. “Uh, sure.“
There are a million thoughts in his head but one question is the loudest, the most important and the one Castiel is most afraid to know the answer to:
“Okay“, Cas says. “Thank you, Dean.“
“And you know Dean, he is like a mother duck with his baby ducklings. I think if Jo and me had't talked him out of it he would have slept in your room to keep an eye on you. He didn't even go to work on Saturday although there was an emergency in the workshop. He said to Bobby that he couldn't leave in case there was an emergency with you.“
Cas' eyes fall on his laptop, books and notes that are still on the dining table. They're in neat piles so apparently Dean had cleared them up while Cas was asleep.
There is a glass of water next to his bed which he drinks in one go.
Cas feels like an idiot and tries to distract himself from his own thoughts by actually cleaning up his room.
He opens his mouth and can taste Dean's tongue on his lips. A groan escapes him and he settles his hand on Dean's hips, trying to get him even closer.
Dean gets up and looks down at him, his expression so fond that something in Cas' chest twists.
He waves goodbye and closes the door behind him. Cas falls back onto his bed and stares at the ceiling.
He gives him a quick wave and disappears into his bedroom. Cas watches the closed door for a moment, then sighs and goes back to work.
Of course his plan was to continue working after Dean went to bed, but Cas can't focus now for the life of him.
“Uh-uh. No.“ Dean snatches the bag away from him and Castiel looks up with a frown.
“Dude, you're burning up“, Dean mumbles. He sounds so worried that Cas opens his eyes again. Dean's face is so close that he can count his freckles.
“How are you feeling? Did nurse Dean treat you well?“
“What?“
He brews the coffee and goes back to work.
While Dean is at work, Cas tries to focus on his paper again and curses his brain for every unvoluntary thought about Dean that crosses his mind.
He puts the last pancake onto the plate and turns off the oven.
Dean looks extremely pleased with himself and Cas has to smile. Dean's cooking is good, so he has every right to be proud.
Cas lets out a breath. “Yeah, I know.“ He remembers their talk about that topic very clearly.
Just as he manages to finally grasp the concept of what he is looking at, the door of his flat opens and Dean comes in, carrying two paper bags and grinning from ear to ear.
Dean peeks his head into his room and smiles at him. Castiel's stomach drops and he feels like he's on a rollercoaster.
Cas mind is racing now. Does Dean want him to follow him? When he said 'Let's go to bed', did he mean together? Did he notice how Cas reacted to him being so close? Does he think -
“But it's better now?“, Cas asks carefully. He knows how important Dean's brother is to him.
Dean mumbles a gruff “Sure, no problem“ under his breath and starts cooking.
“I feel like that's my problem. I worry too much. About everything. And everyone. And I often wanna … save people, I guess. Or at least help them. But I realized that sometimes it's not my place to do something, you know? Sometimes people just have to make their own decisions.“
“You know Jo?“, Cas asks, confused what this has to do with him.
He gets the strange feeling that Dean is keeping him company to keep an eye on him. After their talk yesterday he can't help but wonder if this is about Dean worrying about Cas.
He wants this all the time, forever: This intimacy, this vulnerability, this honesty. He wants
“Yes, he already told me before that your life-work-balance was kinda unhealthy. No offense.“
Cas reluctantly tears his eyes away from the stove and is greeted with Dean looking at him with raised eyebrows and a stunned expression.
Cas feels the air leaving his body like a deflating balloon. He goes to his room and flops down onto his mattress.
“You can finish it later.“
Sure, he knows why
“Are you okay?“, he asks and Dean looks at him, surprised.
“That's good“, Dean says and claps him lightly on the back.
“Cas. Come on“, he insists and offers him his hand.
He gets up on wobbly legs and leaves his room, somehow disorentied in his own flat. The light shining through the windows is beginning to fade again, so it must be the late afternoon.
Dean smiles sadly. “Yeah. It is. But I was scared I ruined our relationship because I was so controlling.“
He gets up and puts on a new shirt and sweatpants. When he makes his way into the living room he sees Dean cleaning the kitchen.
Dean looks at him from the side and scratches his neck. “Sorry, I didn't want to overshare or anything.“
Very carefully, he lets his hands wander and slowly pushes them under Dean's shirt. He hears Dean's breath hitch as he plants a soft kiss under the lobe of his ear.
“Can I check?“
His laugh, his hands, his giddy excitement about nerd stuff, the way he hums when he cooks, how he always asks Cas how his day was, his bowlegs, the way he licks his lips when he concentrates on something ...
They sit down on the sofa and Cas expects Dean to turn on the TV but instead they start eating in silence.
Cas wants to say something, but Charlie is already talking again.
Dean chuckles, then takes his head into his hands and kisses him again.
They forget about the pancakes and about everything else. It's just the two of them, without a care in the world.
“I think I'm just gonna go to the library to return my books“, he says and gets up, when his world is suddenly shifted sideways.
He waits for Dean to say something but he just stares at him. The tension between them fills the air and makes it hard for Castiel to think.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
“Cas, I don't think you should -“ He stops mid-sentence and rubs his face again.
Cas just waves his hand, already focusing on his notes in front of him. “It's fine, don't worry.“
Cas gives him a weak smile. “Good. I'm gonna finish it today.“
“I'm just making pancakes“, Cas answers.
Sometimes he feels gentle touches on his face and hears a low voice and he tries to answer and to talk but his brain is somehow not connected to his mouth anymore.
Dean is holding his face, their chests are pressed together and Cas' mind is silent for the first time in a long time.
“What do you mean?“
He tries to sort his thoughts.
“Can I watch TV or would that bother you?“, he asks.
He clears his throat and walks towards his room. Right in front of his door, he stops and looks at Castiel who is still rooted next to the sofa.
Cas doesn't even notices when Dean comes home and jumps when he's suddenly standing next to him.
The deadline is so close. But he thinks he can make it. He worked so hard, he just has to finish.
So while he's carefully reading a recipe and weighing he exact amount of flour and sugar and milk he needs, he doesn't think about Dean maybe liking him. He also doesn't think about the possibility of him just being very friendly and caring and Charlie misunderstanding everything. And he definitely doesn't think about the fact that he should probably confront all of this to find out.
They later clean up the living room a bit and Dean settles on the couch with a beer, while Cas returns to his work.
Cas gives him a smile, this time an honest one.
He was sure Dean wasn't interested in him anyway.
Cas squints at him. “I used a recipe“, he says.
Cas' mind doesn't stop and he falls into an uneasy sleep thinking about Dean's smell, so close to him.
“Sure“, Cas says with a smile although they both know he won't take up the offer.
“Are you feeling better?“, he asks and Cas nods, biting into his toast.
He looks down at his plate and takes a breath. Cas waits for him to continue. He has the feeling that Dean wants to say something important, the way his shoulders are tense and his brows are furrowed.
“Night.“
Cas can't help but smile. “Dean, you can go. I'm fine, I promise.“
“Okay. Then … see you soon! Bye!“ She hangs up and Cas stares at his phone in his hands.
“Hey Dean“, Cas says.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Are you going to bed, too? It's late.“
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
“Hey. We need some groceries so I wanted to ask if it's okay if I head out to the store quickly.“
“I'm just asking because I didn't hear from him for a few hours and I was afraid you died or something.“
“What about me?“
“I'm fine. I just need to rest.“
Dean sighs but doesn't say anything.
“Without burning the kitchen down?“
“No eating while working. C'mon, take a break.“
Cas looks at the clock and then at the paper he is currently working on.
Everything is spinning and Cas feels like he might throw up. He is still clutching Dean's arm.
Cas furros his brows. “What do you mean?“
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
Dean huffs. “I'm fine.“
Cas takes a bite of his food in lieu of an answer.
He notices that they're sitting closer together than usual, probably because they're both tired.
The next hours or days or weeks are in a blurr. Cas doesn't know when he's asleep or when he's awake.
“Sorry, Cas. It's probably not funny, you were really sick. I just think...“ Her tone suddenly shifts and her next words are sincere and almost urging.
When Dean gets up later, he holds his hand out to take Castiel's plate. Their fingers brush for a moment and Cas feels his heart beating in his chest.
Still, he takes another step and now he is so close that he can see the shadow of Dean's eyelashes on his cheeks.
They make it to Cas' room and while Cas mumbles under his breath that he can walk alone and doesn't need help, Dean still doesn't leave his side.
“Morning, sunshine!“, Dean says and hides his awkwardness with his most charming smile.
“Yeah, just … stressed.“
“What are you doing up?“
Thankfully, his phone rings in this exact moment. He picks it up and is greeted with Charlie's cheery voice.
He was funny and considerate and they just got along well right from the beginning.
Dean rolls his eyes. “I got something for you too, idiot. I know how you always forget to eat.“
Dean comes closer and helps him so Cas can sits up. He puts a glass of water and a pill in his hand and says “Take this.“
Cas tries not to be startled by the way Dean looks at him. His eyes are so green and he always gives him his full attention which Castiel finds quite unnerving. He is still not used to be listened to with that kind of intensity.
Cas is making pancakes. Again, it was something to do to keep himself busy because his thoughts threatened to drive him insane.
“How's the paper going?“, he asks.
Cas wants to say more, wants to make sure that Dean knows that he's not controlling or pushy or too considerate but his voice is stuck in his throat.
And he knows that Dean likes him too, as a friend, as a rommate. He knows that Dean cares so much for the people that are important to him – and knowing he is one of them truly makes his heart flutter.
He fully realizes that Dean stayed home and took care of him, that he brougt him soup and took his temperature and returned his books and was just there for him. He doesn't know what to do with that information because is that a thing that friends do for each other?
“That would be wonderful. Thank you, Dean.“
Dean sighs. “She is. But she's also ... I don't know, I've know her for so long, for me she's still just a kid. And … I know she's a grown up, but I worry about her.“
“That deadline still kicking your butt?“ Dean frowns.
As he takes a moment to look up from his screen he notices Dean watching him. Dean quickly averts his eyes but Cas can't help but notice him blushing slightly.
He can't believe it. He is stressed enough already, he doesn't want to also have to deal with the fact that he's in lo-
Cas hums and continues reading his notes. Dean clears his throat and Cas looks up, confused.
Cas closes his eyes. He already feels the sleep coming, his anxiety finally fading because he actually finished his paper on time.
“Hey Cas“, Dean says and Cas feels his cheeks getting hot. Dammit.
Cas is suddenly hit with a wave of affection that almost aches in his chest. He tries to keep his cool but it's suddenly all to much.
Dean is stirring in his sleep, his hand resting on his thigh clenching and unclenching. The urge to take his hand comes to suddenly and is so strong that Cas has to ball his own hands into fists.
He knows that Dean sees it. He knows that he disapproves in the way he shakes his head when Cas knocks over yet another cup of coffee and has to clean it up.
He doesn't even know what time it is. A quick look at the watch tells him it's almost 3 am. Cas gets up and makes himself another cup of coffee.
He takes a shower and feels miles better afterwards. His body is still weak though, and even drying his hair with a towel is an exhausting task.
He turns around to face Dean.
He doesn't understand how it happened but he is suddenly in Dean's arms. Not in a romantic way, but clumsily holding on for dear life.
“Yes?“, he says although he certainly doesn't want to be confronted with the person behind that door.
He will deal with his feelings for Dean – after the deadline.
Dean ruffles through his hair which sends a shiver down Castiel's spine.
“Hey Cas! You're back from the dead!“
And so it doesn't really matter, does it?
“Cas ... I don't want to meddle with Dean's love life or anything but I know how he can be. So I thought I'll try and give it a push in the right direction.“
“Yes, I know. I know every detail actually. No offense, but I think he was a bit exaggerating with his worry. Don't tell him, but me and Jo already made some memes. I can send them to you if you want.“
No, he's just making pancakes.
The exhaustion is still sitting in his bones, gnawing at his skin. His hair is sticky and gross and he just wants to take a shower. His back hurts. He's hungry and thirsty.
Dean's face is puzzled for a second before he catches up again.
Cas does and sinks back into his bed. The last thing he thinks about before he drifts off to sleep again is Dean's eyes, green like clover.
“Yeah, I don't know. When me and Sam were younger, I wanted him to have a great future. A good life. And I might have pushed him too hard, thinking I knew what was best for him. But I didn't even ask what he wanted. So he was kinda mad at me for a while.“
He is almost done. He can feel the exhaustion in his bones, his eyes are hurting, his hands are trembling, but he is almost done.
“I'm great. Really.“
“You okay?“, Dean asks.
Cas is busy with keeping his breath steady and not daydreaming about Dean while he's sitting right next to him.
“I know. Still. Just talking to you helps.“
Cas can't help but smile and a warm, fuzzy feeling blooms in his chest.
He hears the front door and the sound of Dean's boots approaching. Cas focuses on the pan and doesn't look up when Dean enters the room.
First, Cas thinks it's just him, but he soon realizes that they're both dancing around each other. There's a nervous tension in the air and Cas is not sure why.
They share a look and Dean nods at Cas encouragingly.
“Yes. You.“
Dean is the one who speaks first.
They finish they food in silence while Dean occasionally laughs at a funny scene in the movie.
He shakes his head. Maybe that's just wishful thinking. Also, there is nothing to worry about.
Dean takes a big bite out of his burger and then looks at Cas.
There is something lurking in the back of his mind, waiting to jump out at him, but he is still so tired. So pushes everything back, just thinks about Dean's hand on his skin and closes his eyes.
Charlie sighs. She's silent for a moment, obviously considering something.
is nervous.
“I brought food“, Dean says, still smiling. Cas looks into the paper bags and his stomach reminds him how hungry he actually is when he sees burgers and fries in there, the wonderful smell of the fast food filling his nose.
He doesn't know if he can survive like this. Living with Dean was nice until this point, but now he feels like he's touching live wire all the time and his sleep-deprived state doesn't help.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
The deadline is always looming in front of him. He has to make it until Friday. He can't fail.
“You sure? You look tired.“
Cas was the one who was looking for a new roommate and Dean was by far the best choice. His brother Sam knew Cas from college and told Dean about the free room. Cas was happy to help because he liked Sam but he would have chosen Dean over everyone else anyway.
Cas finds it highly amusing and he is watching Dean more than the actual movie.
Dean's ears turn red at that remark and he just clears his throat and scratches his neck.
“You're wearing too many clothes“, he mumbles into Dean's skin, his brain foggy.
“Nevermind. D'you wanna watch some TV? I can't sleep either.“
“Better. I think the fever is gone.“
“So, did you really get sick because you worked too much and refused to sleep?“, Charlie asks.
The thermometer beeps and Dean takes it out of Cas' mouth. He looks at it and this time his smile is genuine.
Cas swallows and shakes his head. “I mean, I don't have an answer or a solution or anything, so...“
Then he closes the gap between them and kisses Dean.
Cas just stares at him. Dean huffs a laugh.
“What would I do without you“, Cas says or thinks. He doesn't even know anymore. He finally falls asleep.
“Well, I'm glad you're better, man. I was really worried.“
“What about you?“
Cas glares at Dean for a moment but his roommate just smiles and shakes the bag in his hand.
Cas takes a deep breath and sends the email. He stares at his screen. He can't believe he's actually done it.
His phone buzzes but he ignores it. He pinches the bridge of his nose and tries to concentrate again. Breathe in, breathe out. And continue.
“You fell asleep“, Cas says, as if that weren't obvious.
He thinks for a bit while Dean stares into space, not looking at him.
He comes back to reality and realizes Dean has fallen asleep, his head resting on Cas' shoulder.
Dean huffs. “You think?“
Cas can't help but smile back at him. He's just always happy to see Dean.
“How are you feeling?“, Dean asks.
“No, it's fine“, Cas hurries to say. “That's … very nice of you. Thanks.“
“I probably went a bit overboard with the paper“, he says. “I should have slept more.“
“Hey Cas“, Dean says, putting the bags on the table and on top of Cas' paperwork, which he hurriedly shoves to the side.
Dean takes the thermometer from the nightstand and holds it in front of Castiel's face. Cas doesn't even think about it, he just opens his mouth and Dean gently puts the tip of the thermometer under his tongue.
Dean's laughter fills the air and Cas can't help but smile too. He flips one pancake onto a plate and pours new batter into the pan.
He doesn't know what he would do without Dean.
His tiredness is becoming a part of him. A part of his daily life.
Cas gives him a sour look. “I can't. I still have to finish this.“
“Yeah, I have to finish this paper until next Friday and ... it's a lot. But I'll manage.“ Cas gives Dean a half smile but he doesn't seem convinced.
The next time Castiel wakes up, he feels almost normal. And awake. He forgot how that felt.
Dean opens his mouth as if he wants to say something, but then closes it again and shrugs.
He sees weird shapes and people he doesn't know in his room and then suddenly he's not even in his room anymore.
Dean blushes and quickly looks to the ground. Cas watches him, trying to decipher his body language.
“Jo is smart. And stubborn. I think she will manage“, Cas says to reassure him. The last time he saw Jo, she beat Dean in an armwrestling match so it's hard to imagine her getting defeated by anything.
He can feel his heart beating faster and sits down on his bed.
Cas knows Dean too well by know. He almost sees the cogs in his mind spinning.
Castiel blinks. He doesn't know what time it is. He doesn't care.
“No, it's fine, don't worry!“, Cas says a bit too quickly. He gives Dean a smile and he looks relieved.
“I'm just saying, he told me that he saw you working so hard and he was worried but he didn't want to tell you anything because he was afraid to cross some lines. I think he's not sure if he's in a position to say something about it, you know?“
It's short and sweet and as wonderful as he has dreamed of but Dean isn't moving and suddenly Cas is afraid he got it all wrong.
Cas grabs his laptop and opens it. He logs in, checks his emails and his heart beats a bit faster when he there is already an email from his professor in his inbox.
But Cas has to finish this work and Dean lets him.
He moves away from Dean and clears his throat. Dean wakes up and looks around, disorentied.
Scenes blend into each other like he's rapidly changing TV channels: a bird brawling outside of his window and startling him; Cas going to the bathroom and taking a piss – he later doesn't remember how he got out of bed or back into his room; Dean sitting next to him and feeding him soup; Cas kicking his blanket off because it's too hot, too confining, too heavy; later feeling the blanket getting draped over him again; Dean talking to someone on the phone in the living room; Cas tossing and turning and falling asleep again.
Silence fills the air. Cas feels his heart beating in his chest. He's so nervous that his hands are trembling. He knows he needs to say something, but he doesn't even know where to start.
“Come on, let's go to bed“, Dean says and gets up.
“Oh! Yeah, sure. Jo. Yeah.“
Dean hums a melody while he's putting the plates in the dishwasher and Cas tries to calm himself down. He gets up and his eyes fall on his laptop and notes on the table.
It's Friday. Finally. Cas feels relieved and at the same time anxiety and stress is burning in his gut and his throat feels so tight that he think he might choke. He still feels dizzy.
So he had surpressed every inappropriate thought since then and apparently he did it so well that he hadn't even realized his crush had already developed into something more.
He turns back to his laptop and reads through his paper to distract him from his thoughts. But his brain betrays him: Cas feels himself looking up from time to time, watching Dean still sitting there. And he imagines what it would be like if he could just go up and take Dean's face into his hands and kiss him …
His throat feels dry and he coughs. One moment later, Dean is in his room, looking concerned.
“Me?“
And yes, of course he thought Dean was hot. But he didn't want to be that asshole that ruined a perfectly fine, platonic roommate relationship just because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.
When Cas hears the door opening he quickly collects himself and pretends he is completely immersed in his paper. He hopes his face looks normal and concentrated and not like he just had a daydream about Dean pinning him against a wall, kissing him deeply, slowly pushing a hand into his pants....
Dean rubs a hand over his face.
He even helps him under the covers and sits on the side of his bed for a moment.
Dean starts talking about his day, how he met Charlie after work and that she and Ash were planning to hack some top secret servers of some law firm. Cas finds himself relaxing and listening carefully.
Soft noises are coming from the living room and when he peaks his head around the corner he sees Dean on the couch, fallen asleep in front of the TV with the remote in his hand.
Cas is surprised how well he can work during this. He always thought he needed absolute silence, but Dean's audible presence is calming him down and is making it easier to not overthink what he is working on.
Dean usually comes back in the late afternoon and they often watch a movie together or just talk about their day. It's nice and Castiel enjoys their shared life.
Dean playfully bites Cas' lower lip and Cas feels his blood boiling under his skin.
“Well done, buddy! Now what? Party?“, he asks with a grin, well aware that partying is the last thing Cas wants to do now.
“It's my way of saying thank you. For being here while I was sick“, he says while watching the stove.
The warmth from Dean's hand on his face makes him feel safe.
“Yes, I feel fine.“ He chews for a moment, then adds: “I think I'm gonna head out and return my books. Maybe get new ones for my next paper.“
Cas has to pull himself together to not drop his plate. He gives Dean a quick smile and hopes his face isn't red.
A blush creeps up Cas' neck and he mumbles a thank you.
Cas is stunned by this speech and something in his mind clicks into place. A puzzle piece that makes the image he has of Dean more complete.
“Why aren't you at work?“, Cas asks and Dean shrugs.
“Yeah. I'm done.“
He learns forward, he feels Dean's breath on his lips, he thinks for a second 'This is the last chance to stop. There is no coming back from this.'
Sure, he still doesn't know how to deal with the fact that he has a crush on his roommate. But he will deal with this later. After the deadline, when he's not a sleep-deprived zombie anymore.
Cas gathers all of his courage and takes a step towards Dean. He keeps his hands to his side but takes another step.
He meets his eyes and yes, there it is: Dean gets even more flustered, looking from his eyes to his lips. Cas' heart begins to stutter and the feeling of hope he felt in his stomach since the phone call with Charlie grows.
“So if you want to tell me in the future when you think I'm not looking after myself, you can.“
He slowly opens his eyes and Cas only manages to hoarsely say “Dean“ before he gets pulled back in. Dean is gripping the front of his shirt and is kissing him again and Cas is afraid his knees might give way.
He  manages to get a big chunk of work done and is pleased with himself.
and he wants to share his life with him.
He understands why Dean is worried: Jo is still young and owning a business is nothing that comes easy or without putting a lot of work into it.
“Well, goodnight then“, he says with one last look at Castiel before he closes his bedroom door behind him.
“Couldn't sleep“, he lies.
And he needs the space for his work – as an architecture major he needs to be able to draw on paper as well as working on his computer.
Castiel sighs and rubs a hand over his face. “I can't, Dean. I need to finish this -“
Cas gets out of the bathroom, takes on last look at Dean, still snoring quietly on the sofa. He looks so young in his sleep and Cas has to fight the urge to walk over to him. He doesn't want to wake him up.
But he doesn't say anything, so Cas continues.
Cas is still confused but he doesn't say anything. He knows how much Dean loves his job and he would think that even if Bobby told Dean to stay at home he would still go to the workshop just to be there.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
He hears Charlie sigh on the other side of the line. “He was texting me and Jo a LOT the last few days.“
Cas resumes typing on his laptop, trying to bundle his last energy to wrap up this goddamn paper. The end is in sight and he feels like he is dragging himself to the finishline.
learned from Sam, and then he mumbles something Dean hears but doesn’t really believe. “What?”
Kids deserve to be listened to, in Dean’s opinion.
, in the hard set of his jaw now as he waits for Dean’s response.
“Shut the fuck up, Sam.”
Sam cracks a smile. “That was the politest, ‘mind your own fucking business’ I’ve ever heard.”
“I’m French Canadian,” Balthazar says scathingly, like that’s something he should be bragging about out loud at Wrigley Field.
Cas’ brows furrow and he gives Dean a look. “I do not celebrate American Thanksgiving.”
Dean loves waking up his teammates and telling them they have the equivalent of work on a Saturday. Really, it’s his favorite thing to do. The amount of swears flung at him over the phone make it that much better.
“Roadtrips,” Dean says without thinking, and it suddenly hits him how badly he wants to be out on the highway, just him, Cas and his Baby.
Castiel frowns. “It’s only ten.”
“Bite me.”
“You guys know Cas Krushnic?”
So great. Dean’s become so mopey and teenage girl-like that even fucking Benny has noticed. He wonders if in all these gossips sessions the team has figured out what’s wrong with him, because he sure as fuck hasn’t.
Dean’s never hated anybody more than he hates Gordon right now, and he knows he’s gonna punch him, would have knocked him on his ass and kicked his face in if Cas hadn’t appeared right that moment and said, “ready to go?”
“Hmm,” Cas hums and then hangs up, because Dean still hasn’t made him understand that he likes hearing a goodbye once in a while. Whatever. Not like he has a complex or anything.
By the time the rest of the team tramps in, chatting loudly and yelling about the win, Dean and Cas are at separate ends of the locker room, Dean already changed into his sweats.
Krushnic glances at Dean’s hands, wrapped around his mug, and says, “Ah,” like he’s just understood something. Dean has no idea what that can be. He sips at his coffee self-consciously. “What is this show?” Krushnic asks.
“Sure, dark hair,” Dean gives him a sarcastic smile. “Dark eyes, flexible. You want some more descriptive words?”
Dean laughs. “It was that easy?”
“Not now, Sam.”
“How the fuck could you hear all that?” Dean shakes his head as they step onto the elevator. “Never mind. Forgot you weren’t human. So what if I did?”
Their kisses taste like bourbon the rest of the night.
“Krissy…”
“From what I’ve seen the past few months, it ain’t too far from the truth. You’re traveling a dark road, Winchester.”
Of course the next few times he sees Cas are practice and games, and it’s not like he can proposition the guy right there in the locker room. He has no indication Cas wants to be propositioned, in the first place, and second of all, the team would explode if they knew what Dean wanted. Gordon alone would make enough money leaking that story to the press to retire.
“Dude,” he says, chuckling a little, “I’m not tying up your skates.”
Dean turns to look at Cas accusingly, but Cas was as usual, totally oblivious, his brow furrowed as he stared down at the baseball field. “You inviting people on our date, Cas?” he asks, only half joking.
Cas shrugs. “I didn’t want her here. She won’t find it. I asked for chocolate sausage.”
“You are so good, Dean,” Cas whispers quietly. He’s staring straight at him, hand still held to his cheek, and Dean stares back, too captivated to look away. Cas’ words are making him uncomfortable, the weight of them sinking into his bones. He knows they’re not true. “You’re a good man, Dean Winchester.”
“Sounds like my teammate.”
Sometimes being on a hockey team is like being surrounded by a bunch of high school girls.
Dean feels like the hardest punch he’s ever received in his life has been landed to his gut, the air rushing out of him in a thankfully silent gasp. “Why the hell not?” he demands, because anger is the only thing that’s going to save him here.
“Man, you ain’t seen nothing yet,” he grins, unraveling the new strand of lights and handing the end to Castiel. “See that plug right there? Pop it in.”
“So?” Dean raises an eyebrow. “C’mon, be a pal, Cas. Don’t leave me down there all alone to eat like some loser.”
Cas didn’t say much, but every time Dean worked up the nerve to look at him, he could just tell. He was enjoying the hell out of himself. Dean’s be willing to bet he was the most thankful one here.
Whatever. Cas’ll leave if he wants to.
“With my big dick,” Gabriel supplies helpfully, but he’s rightfully ignored.
“Oh,” other than the slight eyebrow raise, Sam doesn’t react. “Of course, Cas. You coming shopping with us too?”
“We’re done,” he tells it firmly, awkwardly rolling off the bed in an attempt to keep the mess as contained as possible. He hobbles to the bathroom and wipes himself down with a wet washcloth, pulling off his shirt. He’s too lazy to get into PJs now, and the alcohol is wearing off just enough that he’s beginning to hurt, physically and mentally.
“How can I not, with you scurrying around trees and your moose brother?” Crowley smirks. “Turns out you can be useful to me – there’s a bloody tree upstairs that’s on the fritz, one of those mechanical contraptions you swore would be worth it when I let you build the damn thing in the first place.”
he’s being a good captain today, motivating and leading by example and all, so he cuts in, “look Sam, hockey makes ya mad. It’s a contact sport. Once we score it’ll settle down.”
“Sometimes,” Sam plows ahead, ignoring him, “You get really, really close with people. Like Benny.”
Dean’s glad Kate appears again (seriously, she has the best timing in the world) with the burgers, because it means he doesn’t have to acknowledge what Cas said at all. Not that it isn’t nice of Cas to try to make him feel better about his mom, but he doesn’t need it. She died a long time ago. He’s over it.
Except he and Cas always have had a closer relationship than Cas and Sam, so if Cas is suddenly calling Sam over him, it must be because of something Dean did.
“CASSIE!”
“You hawkey players?” The driver’s got the thickest Chicago accent Dean has ever heard.
Sam narrows his eyes at him. “Well, what are you going to do?”
He’d finally gotten a hold of Victor about half way through the month, and even he’s not sure if he was just relieved to finally hear from his friend or relieved because finally someone was going to be on his fucking side.
“I don’t,” is Castiel’s amazing comeback, but Dean still smiles at him.
“It’s already on my hand,” he frowns, petulant. “And we’ve learned from experience that I need to use my hand first Dean, because otherwise penetration is—”
Dean’s voice, strangely, sounds slightly breathless. “Is that something you’d want to—“
“Your brother’s got a few screws loose in his noggin’.”
“It’s fine,” Dean says. “Cas wanted you here, so.”
“No,” he says simply, holding open the door to the staff room and following Charlie inside. He carefully does up the buttons of his coat, going through the same tiresome routine of bundling up that he goes through every day. The cold makes him so exhausted. He could move south to escape it, but he can’t imagine leaving Chicago.
Dean looks out at them all, and can’t shake the guilty feeling that washes over him. This is his family. All this crap he and Cas are accumulating, it’s gonna spill over onto them too. And they don’t even know about it. It’s a goddamned shitty thing to do. So he swallows his pride and closes his eyes and says, “Cas and I are seeing one another.”
He goes for hard and pressing, biting at Cas’ lips, but Cas’ other hand comes up so that his face is being cupped, and Cas slows it, gentles it before pulling back and smiling a little. “I no longer think hospitals are so bad.”
And he fucking smirks.
“Bobby!”
. He just figured if the guy was living with him, and they enjoyed sucking one another off, they might as well sleep in the same bed.
wanted to have sex with him.
“He was from the Scorpions?” Krushnic asks. Dean resists the urge to snap at him, because he’s still so angry it would be biting to the point of possibly damaging how they played the game tomorrow. He’s not sure how much of that conversation Krushnic understood, or if he’d realized what Zachariah had implied about him – he’d never stood up, or gotten angry in any way that Dean can see.
“Dean,” he breathes as he moves closer to the bench, bending to examine a reindeer head that could be real if not for the smooth, metallic glint to its fur. “You made all of this?”
“Read in the car,” Dean had told him, and at Sam’s response had yelled “Uncalled for!” at his retreating back.
When Jack goes off with Lucifer, Dean knows Cas will do anything to get him back. He’s seen firsthand what Castiel does for the people he loves, what he thinks his own life is worth in comparison.
Hell yeah he does. More claim than Gordon. But he’ll be fucked if a quote like that ends up in some paper. “Are you even going to the bar?”
They walk over to the Water Tower, and as usual split up as soon as they’re inside the mall. Dean doesn’t get how people Christmas shop together. If you like them enough to endure this kind of hell with them, chances are they’re getting a present from you and can’t be around anyway, right?
“Gotta respect her feelings there, bud,” Dean says with a slight smile.
Dean continues to sit there in stunned silence. He has no response, because this is all too ridiculous to respond to. Han Solo is a badass, plain and simple. If he didn’t talk about him every chance he got something would be wrong with him. And maybe Aaron was hitting on him and he hadn’t noticed, but nothing happened, right? He wouldn’t have done anything.
Somehow, just kissing was fucking worse. Way worse.
Castiel glances back in the direction of the toy department. He has been gone for longer than he’d expected to be. “Yes.”
“You can’t compare Vic and Cas,” Dean says immediately. “I mean they’re a whole…different thing. But hell have Cas and I clicked. You saw the game tonight, right? I’ve never seen anybody get to the center of the ice undefended as many times as he can. And that goal! Hell, that must’ve been the hardest slap shot you ever took, right buddy?” he glances at Cas, who looks like he’s having a hard time focusing. He’s got this weird half smile on his face, different then the quirk of the lips Dean usually sees, different from the full out grin he’d seen earlier. It’s kinda…Cas is kinda beaming, and for some reason Dean can’t stop staring, and he can’t swallow around the lump in his throat.
“Okay. I’ll, uh, keep it warm for you,” Sam says, and shooting Dean a dirty look as he continues to make small noises of adoration, he hurries away.
There are so many questions there Dean doesn’t even know where to begin. Doesn’t know where, and can’t. Because he wouldn’t tell Cas about dad, and now he expects the guy to play Doctor Phil with him? Dean may be an ass sometimes, but he tries not to be a hypocrite.
“It’s a type of candy, not really sausage,” Cas smiles slightly and twists the cap of his Sharpie, waiting patiently for Dean to pass on the next person in line.
Okay that’s enough from Sam and his weird fucking theories. Dean turns around abruptly and moves back in line behind the couple separating them, throwing his arm around Sam’s shoulder. “Man, you gushing about me, Sammy?” he grins lazily at Krushnic. “He’ll do that in his sleep, too.”
Dean stares at him. He guesses maybe he’s always kind of known this, somewhere in the back of his head. That no guy gives up the things that Cas has without loving them deeply. But he’d always had the thought that maybe Cas was confused, or wasn’t able to handle love in the same way humans can. There were certainly times when he didn’t act like Dean thought someone in love should – there was a reason he was terrified the angel would leave and never return.
“Good riddance,” Dean mutters.
The ref just shrugs. “Looked like boarding to me.”
Cas doesn’t act any differently. Dean watches carefully, waits for some kind of sign that something has changed, that their dicks touched and Cas had his mouth on him and that Dean is still not gay but he might be gay for Cas, a little, and he means that in a totally sexual way without any feelings attached.
“That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. Cas and I aren’t friends. I see him at practice, why the hell would I miss him?” He says it too fast, his voice just a little too high-pitched, and Dean curses himself for making his words sound so blatantly false, because they
“So just calling to chat, huh?” Dean teases. “Saw we were in the playoffs and figure you could get tickets? You might be in luck, kid, I never had anyone to hand out tickets to before.”
Cas studies him for a brief moment. “I used to be in love with you,” he says quietly. “But then I realized undeserving you are. So yes, I’m sure.” Dean barely has time to register, his mind racing to process Cas’ words as heart beats furiously against what feels like his constricting ribcage. Cas takes a step forward and smiles slightly.
Bobby has noticed, as he spends more and more time working on Dean, Krushnic and Benny’s line. The team notices, grows quiet when Dean and Krushnic have to be anywhere near each other, like whatever is affecting them is contagious, and if they’re not careful they’ll catch it too, and nobody will be able to play with anyone else. The media has noticed, the analysts, and instead of getting excited over Dean and Krushnic’s supposed chemistry, they’re calling for Bobby to change the line up instead. Dean doesn’t know why he doesn’t. Stubbornness, he guesses, a trait he also carries around and has probably been inherited from Bobby, or his father, or both.
Gordon’s face screws up in disgust and he takes a step back, shaking his head. “I thought better of you, Winchester. I figured sending those idiots after you in New York would have been enough.”
“Can Anna come?” Cas asks.
Anna’s brown eyes lock with his for a moment. “Treat him well. He doesn’t like hospitals.”
Bobby scowls at him, the look growing deeper when he notices his defaced mask. “You’re paying for that, Gabriel,” he growls. “And you can expect extra conditioning this week too. Just because you’re an idiot doesn’t mean you can act like one.”
“Well if you’re on da Chicawgo team, ya deserve it,” he nods sagely. “I hear you kids are good this year.”
“Where are we going?” he asks.
“No?” he says, so thrown off it sounds like his firm answer is uncertain. Apparently Cas thinks so too, because his eyes narrow and his mouth opens in accusation. “No,” Dean repeats, steadier this time. “We’re actually not even supposed to be fraternizing with the ice girls, or whatever the hell the NHL handbook says.”
Gabriel blinks at him and murmurs, “Interesting.”
on his laptop in the War Room.
Shut up, Sam.
Dean thinks the hell with it and takes a swing, hoping to force Krushnic to retaliate, but he ducks smoothly out of the way, radiating calm, and that’s when Dean really and truly loses it. Yelling out in frustration, he shoves at Krushnic’s shoulder, shouting angrily, “What, you some kind of fuckin’ fairy?”
Despite the game being well into the sixth inning, the concourse surrounding the field is still crowded with fans in white and blue grabbing beers and overpriced keychains. The concession stand at the foot of the stairs has multiple lines about ten people deep, and Dean has to ignore niceties and push through the crowd to situate himself and Cas where he thinks the end of one of the lines is.
“Dunno why you were always bitching. Captaining a hockey team is the easiest job I’ve ever had in my life,” Victor jokes, following him inside. “So where were you, anyway? Roadhouse crew hadn’t seen you in a while.”
“Yeah, I mean – yeah.”
Krushnic follows this whole process with his eyes, then looks down at his own plate. “I don’t like tomatoes,” he says quietly.
“It’s cool you haven’t said anything,” Claire says bluntly. “You just are. That’s cool. That’s me and Kaia. We just are. Y’know?”
Dean can still feel the heat of Cas’ hand pressed into his shoulder and thrumming through his body.
Dean takes a large gulp of caffeine with his eyes closed, savoring the small jolt of recognition his body feels. “Why the hell are you up before me?” he asks, keeping his eyes closed. “The world ending or something’?”
“Hey, fancy seeing you here.”
“Sammy,” Dean says loudly. “Got anything you wanna add to the conversation?”
“That’s because they’re nerds.”
Christmas’ were spent going to mass, full of family members that refused to answer his questions about why some families had trees in their living rooms, or why Aaron Bass had eight days of Christmas instead of just one.
This prompts a round of catcalls and more insults, which Dean ignores. “You’re all missing the fucking point,” he snaps. “Victor, one of the best guys on the team, a guy that’s been here almost longer than anyone, is gonna get replaced by some naïve kid whose gonna need
They’re at the mall in New York, Cas leaning over the toddler in Dean’s lap with a concentrated look on his face as he signs the puck, tongue sticking out slightly between his teeth. And Dean staring over the top of the toddler’s head at Cas like…
Aw, Fuck it.
“Not Nancy,” he shakes his head. “It was Edlund.”
“You believe the solution is to trade me,” Cas says quietly.
“Take one, Cas, before I’m forced to call mommy dearest and tell her you’re getting all twiggy-looking.”
Victor, who looked like he’d been dozing off, snaps to attention, eyes landing on Dean. Dean can’t help giving him a huge grin, not holding back on the happy because fuck it, and receives a punch in the arm as a response. “Ow!”
“Can’t ya read, idgit? Sign says I’m on a break.”
He can’t seem to work up the energy to get back on the couch, and neither can Cas, who's taken it upon himself to collapse half on and half off of Dean’s chest. They’re sticky and disgusting, only half naked. Dean can feel the headache he’d forgotten slowly returning, knows his back will kill him in the morning for this. He can’t seem to care.
It shouldn’t be this hard. They were just them, together. It was all this extra bullshit weighing Dean down, dragging him through old familiar shame and the new guilt that whatever Cas was going through, that was his fault too, and he wasn’t even brave enough to ask about it.
Two hours and half a bottle of bourbon later, the damn article still isn’t making sense to Dean.He doesn’t get it, even as much as he squints at it as he takes another large gulp of bourbon.
The Ma’lak box is a fuck up. It just pisses Jack off, loses Dean the element of surprise. He broke the kid’s trust, but he can’t let himself be upset about that, be distracted from what needs to be done. Chuck, the dramatic asshole, shows up at the final hour strumming his dumbass guitar, and Dean takes pleasure in smashing it to the floor, even if Chuck’s reaction is the first time he’s ever been scared by the neurotic little guy.
Cas hesitates, and Dean can actually see the stubbornness slipping away. “If I come with, we will have a conversation?”
Selfish, is what it is. Cas healed that handprint expecting to never see Dean again. He was just going to die without even saying goodbye. But Dean went and ruined it like always.
“Hell yeah it is,” Dean answers, voice as serious as he can force it to be. He can’t look at Krushnic’s face. If he does, he’ll lose it. “You don’t like pirates, Cas?”
“Especially televised interviews,” Dean growls. “Don’t want the media catching sight of your hickies, do ya?” Which is the logical thing to think, except some primal part of Dean’s brain unlocked by his good friend alcohol is screaming that that’s exactly what it wants, Cas all marked up with Dean’s bite marks on national TV, practically stamped all over with the word ‘taken’.
Carver and Edlund glance at one another. “We’ve never had an openly homosexual player in the NHL before, much less two,” Edlund says. “If you weren’t dating one another, we could have handled it easily. As it is, there are certain…complications.”
“Little bro!” Castiel hears Gabriel call, and he’s barely able to rip his gaze away from the Christmas tree made up completely of green Frango mint boxes in time to see Gabriel lunge at him for a hug. “I thought you’d forgotten all about the little people.”
“Yeah man, I’m doing great,” Victor answered when Dean asked. “Guys here are nice, the coach isn’t too much of a hard ass…besides the accents and the poutine, it’s almost like America here. ‘Cept man do these folks love their hockey.”
So Krushnic on one side, Gordon for some fucking reason on the other, and anyone else Dean would actually want to talk to too far away for him to actually hold a conversation with. Great.
“Yeah,” Dean laughs and stops abruptly when Cas’ hand starts rubbing over his ankle. He’s pretty sure it’s not a conscious act. Clearing his throat, he adds, “You, uh, you didn’t know that?”
Dean climbs into the driver’s seat and starts the car up, almost immediately noticing Castiel’s stiffness. Without a word he places a hand on Castiel’s knee and just rests it there, a steady warm presence that has Castiel relaxing back into the seat before he realizes it.
Scratch that, Dean scowls as he watches Garth bend over and whisper something to Kevin right in front of him. They’re worse than high school girls.
Dean punches his shoulder and Cas looks down in surprise at where he’d touched him. “You asshole. You fucking knew Batman wasn’t part bat.”
Sam’s silent for a moment. “So like, a metaphorical, sexual closet or an actual –,”
“Means you’re stinkin’ stadiums to high heaven, and I don’t need that happening on our own turf,” Bobby growls. Clearly Bobby is as unwilling to take shit early in the morning as he is at reasonable hours. “Call the team. I want you all in the parking lot of Crowley’s in four hours, or you knuckleheads won’t be seeing another day off until Christmas.” On that note, he hangs up. Charming.
Dean doesn’t answer with words, and Castiel realizes how out of his depth he is the second Dean’s lips are on his, wasting no time in coaxing his mouth open with the press of his lips and the gentle prodding of his tongue, persistent until Castiel gives in. “Dean,” he mumbles, barely managing to pull away, but Dean shushes him with a hand up his side, tucking into his waistband and managing to dislodge his button up in order to press warm, large and reassuring against his bare skin.
Santa peels off his white beard, only to reveal a shorter, gray one underneath. He pulls off his hat to reveal thinning brown hair, also beginning to turn gray. “I sweat more n’a priest in a whorehouse in this get up,” Santa grumbles. “You work here, huh? Bobby Singer.”
Dean catches a glimpse of Maxine Cooper draped seductively over Ralph Meeker’s side while he looks on dispassionately and swears, stomping past Sam and back to his room.
The bathroom is fairly silent again, so maybe it’s safe to leave. It’ll be a fucking miracle if they manage to make it out of here without anyone noticing, but Dean feels like he deserves some miracles. He’s about to reluctantly pull his face away from the warmth of Cas’ skin when his ears perk up, and he manages to catch what the intercom is piping in from the ballfield.
“What can I say, Mounties are tough, scary guys,” Gabriel smirks. “Lemme guess, Thing One and Thing Two buried themselves in women and books respectively over the summer while they waited for hockey season to start again. You two are predictable as hell.”
Dean stuffs the photo inside his jacket and stands up quickly. “You’re fine,” he tells Cas. “I was being an asshole.”
“So you do actually exist outside of the store,” he replies.
Sam and Chuck stay closer to the center in order to protect the now empty net but close enough so that they can be a part of the play. Balthazar takes his place in front of the net to screen the goalie from seeing anything, and Dean takes up his spot on the right side of the ice, Krushnic on the left.
P.P.S (Rachel here, just edited. Don't fire me please I have a family)
Bobby snorts loudly, and Sam shoots him a glare. “Don’t be a hypocrite, Bobby.”
“That’s fucking bullshit!” Gabriel snaps.
“What?” Dean asks, because usually Cas can’t get enough of the tables turning, of Dean finally allowing himself to be the needy mess he otherwise keeps tightly in check.
“Remembering?”
“Hey,” the guy slurs next to him, and Dean peers over his outstretched arm at him. “Dean Winchester?”
“Krushnic?” Dean says, and the guy turns to look at him with cool blue – wow, really fucking blue – eyes.
“Hey guy, we’re here!”
“What’s wrong with your birthday?” Charlie asks, then immediately seems to drop this question in favor of, “hey, where’s Cas?”
Even though it sucks, the memory makes it possible for him to turn over on his back again.
“I’m hanging up now.”
“I wanted to go on a date,” Cas says stubbornly.
Cas (not any different from the one you know, his traitor brain whispers) chuckles, god damn fucking chuckles, and Dean cannot believe that his fucking dick twitches again.
Cas finally comes to get him around midnight, and Dean is so mentally exhausted and fed up with everything that he doesn’t even want to pretend to see this whole separation with Cas thing through. Cas can leave when he’s dragged from Dean’s cold, dead hands.
“You’re not even gonna defend it, are you?” Gordon smirks. “You’re disgusted by it too.”
It misses completely. Cas turns to glare at Dean and he hands over another softball with a barely concealed grin on his face.
Ah. A groupie. Maybe he was going to have a good night after all. “S’right,” he smirks slowly. “You’ve got a bit of an unfair advantage there, Red.”
“And in NHL news, the Chicago Cavalry have procured KHL player Castiel Krushnic, likely to fill the void created by left winger Victor Henrickson, who was traded to Winnipeg early last summer. For more on that, we go to ESPN correspondent Luke Wallace. Luke?”
The angel’s throat is around his neck so fast it takes the other two leviathan walking with them a few seconds to notice, precious seconds longer to rip him away. “Don’t make me smite you,” the angel growls roughly.
“This makes you happy,” Cas observes as he sits down.
Krushnic pumps his fist at the crowd and before Dean realizes it he’s in his face, grinning widely and cupping the back of Krushnic’s helmet in his glove to hold it against his own. “Krushnic you beautiful bastard!” he yells over the noise of the crowd, and Krushnic can only grin before Sam comes flying over to them from the other side of the ice and wraps them both in a hug.
“I just took a shower,” Cas says, like that’s an answer. “And this is my bed. I chose it earlier.”
“Where is Dean?” Castiel asks, cutting off their argument.
Dean ignores the joke. “This building’s a damn box full of interesting people and magic,” he informs him. “You won’t find anywhere in the world like Macy’s on State Street.”
“Saw you kissing in the car one night,” Bobby grunts begrudgingly. “Hear you two are practically moved in together.”
“I dabble.”
“We live in a fucked up world, Chief,” Benny says sympathetically, flicking through the channels on the TV.
“My advice?”
Dean’s been lucky enough to have belonged to the Chicago Cavalry since he was drafted eight years ago, same team as his younger brother, Sam. He doesn’t have to worry about contract negotiations until next season, and even then it’s not much to worry about.
“Yeah. So. You going to tell me what’s going on?”
“Only with the pretty girls,” Dean retorts. “What the hell are you doing, telling Cas he can room with me?”
“What a fucking insult,” Gabriel says, sounding insulted. “I’d make it to the socks, at least.”
Dean raises an eyebrow. “Seriouly? You think he’s gonna leak that?”
Gabriel bursts into loud peals of laughter, clapping Cas on the back. “Sure thing, Casablanca,” he smirks, winking. “And next time you two decide to trade handjobs in a Starbucks, try to be louder for the people in the back.” He salutes them with his lollipop before ambling off towards the door.
“Sure,” Sam mutters.
Aaron stares at him a second longer. “I have one of those high craftsmanship replicas,” he says finally. “You wanna come back to my place and check it out? It’ll be almost as good.”
“Maybe,” Krushnic shrugs, handing his pool cue to Dean. “Or perhaps I am just better than you.” With that he offers Sam a weird quirk of his lips Dean thinks is supposed to be a smile (why the FUCK is he smiling at Sam?) and heads back to the bar where Bobby is chatting with Ellen.
There’s a pause, slight hesitation, and then Cas says, “Come with you where?”
“Well uh,” Dean shifts awkwardly and sighs. “Why the fuck not?”
Krushnic frowns and takes a minute step back. Dean stares at him, waiting for him to move more, but he just returns his stare steadily. Weird. Dean suddenly feels like he’s not in charge of this conversation anymore, and he doesn’t like it.
“Well yeah, not like, you specifically,” Jo’s eyeing the area with the pool tables, where Dean saw Ellen hanging around when he walked in. She picks up a dishcloth and starts rubbing at the spotless wood of the bar in front of her. “But some of the other guys won’t stop bitching about how you won’t stop bitching, and Jesus, there’s only so much I can handle. I swear, male hockey teams have the worst simultaneous periods ever.”
Krushnic is crouched in front of the entertainment center, eyes riveted to the TV screen right in front of him. He recognizes the figure on screen immediately as Dr. Sexy, straight down to the signature cowboy boots. “Uh, hey. Krushnic?”
“Why didn’t he run faster?” Cas asks mildly, totally unsympathetic to Dean’s pain and the game’s score of two to one. The Cubs are not winning.
Cas continues to polish helmets and doesn’t look at Dean, so after a while he manages to haul himself up and begins moving the uniforms and socks to the dryer.
“Anyone else notice how Gordon’s not here?” Benny demands, slamming his giant coffee cup down on the table. Dean considers kissing him.
“No,” Cas agrees, turning to look at him. “But it is still foreign to me.” He leans closer, lowering his voice, “and I would like to please you.”
“That was almost touching,” Sam smirks at him and digs into the grocery bag for the beer. “Is this mood what made you go skipping through a field to pick daisies for Cas?”
Gabriel says a swear word Castiel has never actually heard said before.
“The paper is very interested that you were there.”
He’s also able to forget about what Benny said, at least for a little while. Their next big road trip is out east, through New York and up to Boston, and for some reason PR has decided to schedule an autograph session while they’re in New York City. Something about cultivating their rapidly growing east coast fan base.
“Don’t be polite unless you know what it means.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says, sounding slightly sheepish. “So, funny story, got in my car to come pick you up and realized I don’t actually know where you live.”
For some reason, Sam and Cas aren’t thrilled with the idea of him locking himself in a box with Michael and throwing himself into the ocean for all eternity. He gets the thing built but they convince him to at least wait just a little bit longer, to see if there’s another way.
“It’s fixed,” Cas speaks up firmly. Dean raises an eyebrow at him, but he’s already opening the door to climb back into the taxi.
“I realize that, which is why I’ll listen to Crowley’s advice for now. I want to be useful to you and Sam.”
“Sorry for calling you up during the conference finals,” Trenton sounds kind of sheepish. “I got your number from Henriksen, up in Winnipeg. Just thought…I wanted to thank you.”
Cas purses his lips. “I don’t want you to.”
Winnipeg is in the same league as the Cavs, and only a few points behind them. They’re at the time of the year when every team is fighting for a spot up top, where every little game matters, and the tension is evident in the set of Rufus’ shoulders and the way Bobby drags Cas into the locker room like he just caught him keying his car.
Dean has no idea what to get for Cas, or even if he should get anything for Cas. Probably, since he’s coming over now. What the hell are you supposed to get your best friend turned unwanted sex fantasy for Christmas?
“About a week, ma’am.”
They leave the first period still up by one due to Dean’s stupidly lucky goal, and when Bobby praises him for it in the locker room Dean is careful to look like he actually meant to shoot the damn puck and not like he was skating around aimlessly wondering if Cas was mad at him.
“No, I suppose we don’t,” Anna agrees. She passes him another plate and dips her hand into the soapy water. “I sense that he cares very deeply for you.”
“Hey Cas,” he says, making his way over to the hospital bed. Cas would look completely normal, if not for the hospital gown slipping way too low and the white cast wrapped around his left wrist. Otherwise he looks fine, blue eyes alert as they follow Dean. “So. What’s the word?”
Dean goes through most of February not questioning things. He doesn’t question Cas’ toothbrush in his toothbrush holder, or the guest room slowly filling with things. He doesn’t question that every other day of the week, Chekov’s not whining at his bed to go for a run because Cas is taking care of it. He doesn’t question when he wakes up on those days and there’s hot coffee waiting for him.
Krushnic says something in Russian that sounds pretty fucking cool. “What was that?”
Dean swears and slaps his palm flat against the hood of the car as Cas works his way down Dean’s length and then back up, varying pressure as he goes. He’s not very experienced, not like Dean expected him to be (and Dean’s not even sure how he would have felt if Cas were used to sucking cock) but he’s definitely into it, and Dean can feel pressure building low in his stomach when Cas comes back up a second time and starts circling the head of Dean’s penis with his tongue. He’s tempted to come like this, all over Cas’ fucking suit, but he wants more, and there’s no way he’s not getting Cas out of those clothes, so with some effort he gets ahold of the hair at the back of Cas’ head and tugs.
At least this burger is damn good, maybe the best he’s had. It’s so big he’s got to hold onto it with both hands, and he enjoys it quietly for a few minutes, struggling to keep the onions and tomatoes from dripping out the bottom before he glances at Cas.
Cas, who’d stiffened (he’s never been good at hugs, Dean doesn’t mind) slowly relaxes in his arms. “Perhaps I was, initially,” he admits. “I think both of our egos were rather bruised that neither of us wanted to be kissing one another. Alcohol was not kind to us.”
Dean rounds on him and points the spatula in his direction. “Stop letting Sam teach you English,” he says. “It’s gonna ruin you.”
“Doesn’t have to make sense,” Dean says, losing the grin. “All you need to know is that he was usually drunk off his ass. Next question.”
Ed rolls his eyes. “I don’t care that he has a girlfriend, I care that he likes her more than me. I’ve been here longer!”
Eventually he gets bored and, seeing that a row of Barbies is looking sparse, decides to start refilling the shelves again. He’s barely made a dent in the whole process when he sees a woman moving determinedly towards him from the corner of his eye.
“Here,” Dean says, stepping over Chuck’s feet and handing Cas his glass. “What were we drinkin’ for?”
“Glad you’re on the same page as us,” Carver says. “We don’t want this getting out during the playoffs, not at all.”
Dean’s a little worried Gabriel is going to lead them into some back room and is relieved to realize that he’s only heading towards one of the booths off to the side of the bar. As they draw closer he can see that Balthazar, Benny, Kevin, Sam and Jess are already there, and he relaxes even more.
There’s a pile of dirty trench coat slumped against a tree just beside the jagged glowing rip in the world, and Dean nearly stumbles in his haste to reach it.
“Dean,” Benny says lowly, skating around behind him, “Focus, brother.”
“Hey bud,” he smiles, and the kid shoots his toothy grin back. “So you’re Patrick, huh? You like hockey?”
Christkindlmarket isn’t actually too far from the store, and even in typical Chicago traffic Dean is able to make it there relatively quickly, parking the Impala in a nearby parking garage before heading out onto the streets with Cas by his side. He’s never actually been to the market before, for obvious reasons, and he’s surprised to see that it is actually market, in a very European sense. He knows from passing by it in the summer that the area they’re in is usually quite big and open, but today it’s crammed with rows and rows of tiny little wooden huts, and what seems like thousands upon thousands of people.
“I don’t discuss ‘em, just read ‘em,” Dean shrugs, feeling the familiar indulgent smile slip onto his face. “It’s cool dude, you don’t have to pretend I’m smart. My dad used to joke my smarts got slammed into the boards of the Lawrence Ice Rink when I was eight.”
Ten minutes later his ire is all but forgotten as he does a lap around the ice, the familiar weight of his pads over his shoulders and his stick in his hand. They’re doing shooting drills, the whole team moving in tandem to keep a steady stream of pucks trained on Gabriel. Every shot Balthazar takes is aimed at Gabriel’s dick, but at least he’s working on his precision. Dean taps the ice and gets a quick feed from Sam, slapping the puck to the top corner of the net and yelling in triumph as it sails past Gabriel’s glove. “Slow!” he crows.
“Can I help you, Red?”
Dean turns his attention back to the guy he’s wrestled off Cas. “Fuck off,” he snarls, pushing him away and punching for good measure. The guy falls, but he catches Dean as he does, and Dean crashes to the ice once again.
“What?” he snaps back to attention and scoffs. “No way. You’re a guest.”
But how could they, when his delicious grief filled the air? When he seemed hellbent on being attacked, his hoarse voice screaming out, “Cas? CAAAAAS,” into the still Purgatory air?
Dean’s best friend the waiter is back with their salads, and Dean waits until he finishes serving them out before wordlessly passing his plate over to Gordon. He knows without watching it that it makes its way around the table to Sam.
Dean’s not so sure, but it’s not like he has a chance to ask Cas again.
“Oh ha ha ha,” Dean says sarcastically. Patrick makes a loud squeal and Cas raises an eyebrow as if to say, see? Then the camera flash goes off. “Shit. Hannah, we weren’t ready.”
“’Course,” Dean says stiffly. “I’ll get right on that.”
The bar is getting too loud for him, so he spins his stool, and when the room stops spinning too he focuses on the pool table closest to him. Buncha college kids that walked into the first place that looked like it had alcohol and darts, probably. Not a fucking problem among them.
“Very much.”
Cas snorts. “It is the first thing I learned.”
Is he doing this? Is he about to finger a chick in front of Krushnic?
Cas killing her sends him right back into that state of anxiety.
“Dean’s mad at Cas?” Kevin says from beside them.
“I’m glad you have your priorities straight.”
“That doesn’t mean your loss should be belittled, or ignored.”
it here, if you get my drift,” Victor laughed. “It’s the sport, you get what I’m saying?”
Cas keeps saying stuff like that, out of nowhere, like Dean’s used to hearing this kind of shit all the time. It’s hard for him to comprehend that someone like Cas, someone who owes him nothing, can care about him as much as he seems to.
Chekov barks at him and he snaps out of it. Tossing the phone on the bed, he finishes getting dressed. Five cups of coffee and two bowls of cereal later, he feels almost awake, but it’ll have to do, since if he sticks around any longer, he’s not gonna make it in time. He’s not really too eager to test Bobby right now.
“You two hear about what Ash learned?” Benny asked, throwing himself into the bar stool on the other side of Dean. “About Krushnic, I mean.”
Fuck.
“Shut the fuck up, Sam,” Dean says, burger in hand as he gestures at him. “Asking a man if he wants to eat is not mother henning. It’s a question of sanity.”
“I do not know anybody here,” Krushnic says finally. “I don’t care if you like me, but if you would allow me to talk to you occasionally in order to practice my English, I would be grateful.”
“Yeah,” Gabriel nods solemnly. “Dean,” he says gravely, clearing his throat importantly. “Do you promise to make Castiel the happiest man alive by fucking him within an inch of his uptight ass’s life?”
“Anna is much smarter than me,” he agrees. “She speaks English very well.”
“Cas, buddy,” Dean cracks a grin. “Don’t tell me angels glitter.”
“That is quality airplane reading material, Samster.”
He’s pulling as hard as he can, and he can feel his eyes watering
Carver’s got a newspaper held aloft when they enter the room, and Dean doesn’t have to read it to guess what it says. He’s sick of the damn media, sick of this mess and of Gordon holding shit over their heads. He almost wishes he would just release the fucking pictures already.
Dean whips around to look. Sure enough, Cas somehow managed to find the jersey he’d bought on a whim a couple of weeks ago and had stuffed in a drawer and forgotten about. It’s the same jersey Cas wears practically every single say, but somehow just knowing it’s his name and number on the back is making it hard for Dean to look away from him.
that folds into itself.
But Sam speaks up first, because Sam is the real adult here, the responsible one at twenty-three, and Dean isn’t fooling anybody. “So, what happened last night?”
“M’right here,” Dean says, squeezing his hips. “M’looking for someone to kiss.”
Gabriel seems to think differently. “Cassie hates it.”
He said it exactly like that, too. “Are you unhappy with our current situation, Dean?” All squinty eyed and slightly downturned mouth, like there was actually a fucking chance Dean’s answer was gonna be anywhere near the realm of “yes.”
Gabriel’s doing what he’s been doing all season, blocking so many shots the Scorpions don’t seem to care about the fact that he’s the goalie and start coming for him, and then Bobby basically sticks Sam out on the ice and tells him to stay, and Sam becomes kind of a Gabe body guard. Dean would laugh at how hilarious it was if he wasn’t so tense.
“Sorry?” he says, still paused. This could go either way. Cas could want to talk more openly, something Dean doesn’t think he can do, or he’s going to acknowledge that he didn’t miss what Dean had been saying, that he';s gotten a glimpse of what kind of man dad was and what kind of man he could have been, the one Dean wanted him to be. Dean’s shoulders are tensed, ready for all possible outcomes.
Krushnic tilts his head. “What am I getting in return? So I am also able to ‘suppress the urge to kill you’.” He actually makes air quotes around his words, and Dean is so baffled by where this has gone – and by the fact that a move like that made by anybody else would be lame but for some reason he can’t get his brain to apply that word to it – that he can’t think of anything to say for several moments.
“Why does being the catcher matter?” Cas grumbles. “Gabriel is only the goaltender, and he could have run faster than that in all his gear.”
“Jesus, we doing that again?” Benny drops into the chair next to Dean as Sam appears at the same time and pulls out the one across from him, carefully maneuvering around all the bags in his hands. “With how much ya talk about your dick, Gabriel, you’re startin’ to make me wonder if you even have one.”
already all over Cas’ hand, and he seemed into it, and…geez, if Dean was being totally honest with himself (which he can be, here in his own brain, fuck off preconceived notions of gender), the glitter did make a really nice contrast, sparkling gently on Cas’ broad, tanned fingers. No doubt it would look even better slicked over his dick. And rimming Dean’s asshole.
Dean turns his head to look at Cas, who’s glancing down at him in concern.
“Disillusionment wi – don’t you start some free will and how it relates to masculinity and late-in-life evolving sexuality crap, we’re at fucking ball game!”
“You seemed not as happy as usual today,” Castiel shrugs.
“You wanna say that to my face, Winchester?”
“Hello Dean,” Cas replies, not looking up from his crazy remote clicking shit. “Sometimes we do. Other times we talk about the books we are reading, or the current state of political affairs.”
He hasn’t cleared the pipes in a long time, a combination of unusual disinterest and a little fear over where his thoughts might lead him, but now…fuck it. And fuck it again. It needs to happen.
“Thank you,” Cas says solemnly, like it’s actually the Stanley Cup that has just been handed to him.
Sam furrows his brow. “So, what’s the deal with you two?” he repeats.
“I missed you,” Cas shrugs and says it with the same tone of voice he might use to say, ‘I like scoring.’ Matter of fact and to the point and
“Fine,” Castiel replies. He doesn’t think she cares all that much.
‘Course that’s when Sam has to appear, making an indignant self-righteous face. “Do you guys talk about anything but sex?”
The game’s at six again, because it’s eight in Chicago and money matters when it comes to TV broadcasts. They’ve got one more game here in LA before heading home to Chicago.
“If you say so,” Sam says grumpily, striding ahead of him. Dean can’t find it in himself to be worried over whatever Sam has decided to worry about, not when Sam’s stride looks more like a waddle due to him having to walk on his skates.
Krushnic, unsurprisingly, was the star of the show, charming everybody with his accent and what one reporter called, “his refreshingly deadpan humor.” After the reading the article, Dean had joked that that was just the effect of the stick shoved all the way up his ass. Sam wasn’t amused.
Indeed, Dean is making himself look like a complete fool, jumping around on the floor in order to hit the right notes in ‘Frosty the Snowman’. That is, he should look like a fool. Somehow, with the wide grin on his face, and the excitement of the little girl, he looks anything but.
Dean’s stomach drops. “What pictures?”
“Do you need anything?“, Dean asks quietly, his hand pushing Cas' hair out of his eyes.
“So I just wanted to make sure that you knew how much he cares about you.“
It's dark in the room now, but Dean looks hurt for a second before he collects himself.
“Are you okay?“, his roommate asks and Cas clears his throat, avoiding his eyes.
“Thank you, Cas“, Dean says and his voice is genuine. “For the advice.“
“I'm gonna make a casserole for dinner. You want some?“, Dean finally asks.
Dean hums and stretches a bit. Cas forbids his eyes to wander where Dean's shirt is rising up and shows his soft belly.
They sit in silence while they wait for the result and Cas thinks this maybe should be awkward, but all his mind can focus on is how close Dean's hand lays next to his on the blanket.
Castiel laughs weakly. “I didn't do anything. You took care of me.“
Cas nods and checks one last time if his paper is ready to be sent off. While he types a short email for this professor and attaches his paper as a pdf, Dean gets up and joins him at the dinner table.
Cas looks over his shoulder and sees Dean leaning at the dining table. He gives him a dirty look. “I'm just saying, you had every right to be worried. I'm not very good with selfcare.“
“Do you need anything?“
“Just glad you're here“, he says and smiles. He feels himself drifting into sleep and almost wants to cry because he is so relieved.
“Cas?“
Charlie laughs but stops quickly when Cas doesn't join her.
And then there's Dean, right next to his bed as if he just came down from heaven. Dean looks at him and Cas tries to smile and say hello but he can only get out a pathetic croak.
Cas almost drops his spatula but recovers quickly. He puts another pancake onto the plate.
Dean reaches out to him and lays a hand on Cas' forehead. Then he suddenly looks like he got caught doing something forbidden and quickly pulls his hand back.
The last days were such a blur that he didn't have to think about it but now that he is fully awake again he can't deny the truth anymore: He is in love with Dean. Probably has been for a long time.
Cas chuckles. “I guess I am.“
Dean takes a sip from his coffee. “I, uhm. I actually returned your books already. I didn't know when they were due, so I thought...“
Cas started working in the living room at the dining table a while ago because his room is as small as a shoebox and the light in it is terrible.
He still has so much work to do. He can't just stop now. He doesn't have time.
“It really means a lot to me that you care.“
“Charlie, what are you trying to say here?“
Castiel was never good in realizing when other people had romantic feelings for him so now he's scared to misinterpret anything and mistake his wishful thinking for actual proof.
Dean shrugs. “No problem.“
Cas can't help but smile. He turns around to look at Dean who is standing next to the kitchen sink, his hands fiddling with the label of a beer bottle.
They settle down on the sofa and Cas turns on the TV. There is a cowboy movie playing that Dean knows (of course) and he is mumbling the lines along with the actors on the screen.
It wasn't his intention but by the end of the week it has become a habit that he works through the nights. Well, not entirely: He stays up until 5am until he's so tired he can't even keep his eyes open anymore. He then goes to bed, sleeps until 8am and gets up again.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
Dean doesn't seem convinced.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
“I'm fine“, Cas says and shrugs.
This realization makes his head spin and he fears he might say something impulsive, so he quickly stuffs his mouth with food again.
Okay, maybe he already knew he had a bit of a crush on Dean. I mean, how could he not?
Cas raises his eyebrows.
“Okay. Goodnight.“
Then one moment he is suddenly awake and his head feels a bit clearer than before. He rolls around and blinks into the brightness of his room.
Dean sits down across from him and fails to hide his smile in his mug.
Cas needs a moment to take that in. Of course he knew Dean is a caring person. The way he talks about his friends, the fact that he's always happy to help other people when they need him. And also by living with Dean he sees all the little things that show his attentiveness: how he always makes sure that there is enough honey in the house because he knows Cas likes it. How he always asks Cas what movie he wants to watch although Cas knows how picky Dean can be when it comes to cinema. How he always cooks for Cas …
Dean ducks his head, embarassed. “Okay, okay. I'll be back in a few.“
The silence hangs between them for a moment. Cas doesn't have anything to say. His head feels like it's filled with cement. He is so tired that everything feels like it's in slowmotion.
He picks at his food again and rolls his eyes slightly when he notices that Cas is still looking at him.
Cas also knows about the Roadhouse and how Jo took on the ownership of the bar after Ellen broke her hip and couldn't work anymore, at least not fulltime.
His tone is casual but they way he holds his head and the fact that he doesn't directly look at Dean indicates that he's carefully selecting his words.
Cas feels his skin practically vibrating and nothing matters expect Dean kissing him, Dean being so close, finally.
