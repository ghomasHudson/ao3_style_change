“I told her that nothing was the matter,” Steve mumbled.
[Do you honestly think that? –Stark.]
he thought to himself. He forced himself to walk through the crowd, nodding to people as he passed. He probably should talk to some of them, but he had to check to make sure the ballroom was prepared for the event. He turned the corner, going down the hallway that led to the Grand Ballroom. Thankfully, it was much less crowded than the lobby. Steve exhaled softly and slipped into the room, shutting the doors behind him. The function technically didn’t start for another five minutes, so the room was empty. He glanced around the room; his lips parted. It looked stunning.
“Did you like it?”
Shaking his head, he got up and moved to the couch, sketchbook in hand. Maybe changing location would help. He turned on some music and settled into a corner of the couch, his knees drawn close to his chest, his sketchbook resting on his thighs. He made a small line with his pencil, but stopped. No, he wasn’t going to draw the bowl. His assignment would be late, but he wasn’t going to force himself to draw something that just made him want to punch something. To scream. He was going to draw what he wanted.
“Sorry,” Steve mumbled.
“What, someone who has been in the ice, too?”
“Tony,” Steve warned.
Steve’s eyebrows knitted together. “What do you mean?”
“I know that I messed up, Tony. I realize that I hurt you. But…I don’t want to mess up again. I lost you for seven years...I don’t want to lose you for more.” Tears threatened to spill over his cheeks again. He swore under his breath. Who knew that talking about this stuff would make him so damn emotional?
, he thought to himself. He lowered the microphone and took a small step closer to the podium.
“I was hoping that you would call me.”
Thanks for your continued support!
“Well, you’re not watching them tonight.”
Bucky, of course, could sense his nervousness throughout the week, occasionally asking him what he was so ‘bent out of shape’ for. Steve hadn’t told Bucky why he was so nervous, but he figured that Bucky had a pretty good idea as to why he was acting the way he was. Steve only acted this frazzled when it had something to do with Tony.
He glanced away from the room, down the hallway. His cheeks burned.
Steve also made sure to keep busy. He went to the gym, art class, and the construction site. When he visited the site, he made sure that he was there on days Tony wouldn’t be. He was afraid that if he saw him, all of this would be for nothing. That he'd see Tony and want to talk to him, be with him. During one of his visits to the site, Happy informed him that the new facility was almost ready. He said that the outside was complete and soon they would be working on finishing the interiors of the buildings. Apparently the interiors would still take a few months to finish, but at least the new buildings were actually up. On the weekends, Steve tried to do things with Natasha or Bucky if they weren’t busy with something else. Other times he would hang out with Sam when he was in the area. When all of them were busy, he would hang out with friends that he had met at art school. He actually started to have somewhat of a social life.
“I’m not looking at you,” Steve mumbled.
Steve let out an exasperated sigh. “Nat knows too?”
“Is this okay?” Tony asked, pointing to the recliner.
“Why didn’t you tell me? Either of you?”
“When I got back to Earth, it was easier to distract myself from the thoughts. You know, since there were more things to do here. Pepper helped, too. When I’d get too quiet, she’d talk to me or we’d go for a walk.” Tony shrugged. “I know it wasn’t much, but it helped. It didn’t make the thoughts go away completely, though. I still deal with it.”
“So, how’s the art piece coming along?” Tony asked after a few minutes had passed. Steve glanced at him.
A familiar building came into view as they followed the curve of the driveway. Steve looked up at it, still unable to believe that the building before him was actually real. The car pulled up behind a crowd of people that had gathered in front of the building. On the sides of the crowd, news crews had set up cameras on tripods. In the front of the crowd, Steve could barely make out a small metal stage that had been built for the event. He licked his lips and turned to Tony.
“Well. Pepper and I are co-leading the business and Morgan’s going to be starting kindergarten in a few months.”
Steve chuckled. “Glad that you managed to get out of that, then. How has everything been going?”
“Sure, four works.”
Steve glanced at the time. 6:45. He bit his lip. According to his GPS, he should leave now if he wanted to get to the study group on time. But something was holding him back. What if the other night had been a fluke? What if Tony liked him then, but not tonight? He could go there tonight and try to talk to Tony more and then he could decide that he didn’t like him. He’d cast him aside, act like they had never been potential friends. That wouldn’t surprise him, actually. Over the years, Steve was used to people finding him interesting at first (he wasn’t sure why they found him interesting at all, really) and then would not find him interesting later on. And for whatever reason, he didn’t want Tony to find him boring. If he didn’t go, maybe that would interest Tony more.
“Just in case you need it,” Steve said.
Tony grinned. “Oh, I know that, darling. But thank you.”
Steve glanced up at Bucky before glancing back at his book. “I’m not having this conversation, Buck.”
Well, yeah, he did. That’s why he had said that nothing was the matter. But it seemed like that statement wasn’t going to cut it. He exhaled softly and leaned against the counter behind him, arms crossed.
Sending that message should’ve made Steve feel better, but it didn’t. Now he just felt like more of a fool. He should’ve just waited until his other drawing was done and sent that. But…he couldn’t change it now. Sighing, he stood up from the couch and went into his bedroom. He quickly changed into shorts and a t-shirt. Grabbing his keys, he left his apartment, leaving his phone in the living room.
“No need to thank me. It was Tony who organized it. I’m just here to supervise everyone.”
The waitress nodded and walked away.
It took a bit for them to figure out how to announce that they were together, but when they got a phone call asking them attend a certain event, they knew that would be the event where they broke the news.
Steve’s cheeks warmed.
“Sorry,” Steve mumbled. “You don’t have to talk about it.” He knew that work wasn’t his favorite topic, but he figured that since he had been in a meeting practically all day, he wouldn’t mind talking about how it went.
Steve got out of the car and buttoned his suit jacket. He nodded to the doorman who opened the door for him. The lobby was already crowded with guests in black-and-white attire. Steve scanned the room, looking for anyone he would know. Unfortunately, none of the Avengers had arrived yet. Of course they hadn’t.
Steve knew that he would regret sending Tony one of his drawings, but it was nice to see someone so interested in him. Not Captain America, but
“Complementary colors?”
“Good evening,” Steve began, “My name is Steve Rogers; some of you may know me as Captain America.” A few people in the crowd laughed. “Over the last few months, I have been trying to get back into art. The Avengers were on a hiatus, so I thought it would the perfect time to try it again. Before I was Captain America, I used art as an escape from my daily life. It was a haven of sorts. At one point I even thought about going to art school. Obviously… that didn’t happen, but I can’t say that I can complain – I’ve worked with some of the greatest heroes Earth has ever seen.” Steve’s gaze found Tony; he smiled softly at him. “However, like I said, we’ve been on a bit of a break. That gave me time to start on some art projects and take an art class. A bit ago, the owner of this art gallery asked me if I was interested in sharing some of my art. At the time, I said no; I was nervous about allowing others to see my art..to see a part of my heart.” He cleared his throat; he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “But then, I realized that art deserves to be shared. To be seen by others. So, tonight I would like to reveal my collection: The Heroes of the Avengers.”
“Hey, you,” a voice said. Steve blinked and tried to focus on the voice. “Are you just going to lurk there or?”
He raced out of the room and retrieved the frame from his bedroom, where he had placed it earlier today because he wasn’t sure if Tony would want it. The frame was a light tan, which would help people’s eyes be drawn to the portrait. Steve returned with the frame and set it down on the table. He glanced at Tony, who was still standing in front of the picture.
“Anything else?” Steve asked, his voice wavering a bit. He looked away from Tony, unable to hold his gaze. His mouth ran dry; his heart beat loudly in his ears.
“Give me your phone.” Tony held out his hand expectantly.
There were murmurs among the crowd; some people applauded. Steve exhaled softly, glad that no one was throwing tomatoes or other fruits at him. He only needed to see one reaction though, so he glanced at Tony. The brunette still stood in front of the crowd; his hand covered his mouth. His eyes were wide. Steve rushed over to him.
He set up an easel in the living room once the room was clean. Clean wasn’t even an accurate description of how clean the room was; the room was immaculate. The pillows on the couch were perfectly arranged, one resting in front of each couch cushion. The television didn’t have any dust on it and the screen had been wiped clean. The hardwood floors gleamed under the bright lights. The normally covered with textbooks coffee table was clear, save for a series of pencils that Steve needed to do his sketching of Tony. And, near the coffee table, there was a chair that Steve had brought in from the kitchen so he could sit there while he drew Tony. He stood near the door of the family room, looking at the state of the room. Yes, this should be good enough. If Tony had a problem with it…well, he didn’t know what else he could clean.
Tony glanced up at the ceiling. “It is.” He closed the distance between them so he was standing only a few inches away from Steve. “Have you been sitting here the whole time?”
When he had texted Tony about it, he thought that Tony would tell him that he would stop by to at least oversee some of the work, but Tony had just told him to keep him updated. Steve thought that he had been kidding when he first saw the text. It wasn’t like Tony to just not help out, to let others do the work. He supposed that maybe he still needed some rest, though. Tony said that he’d send more people to help though, which he supposed was better than nothing.
Steve got out of the shower and wrapped a towel around his waist. He padded into his bedroom and glanced at his closet; he bit his lip, unsure of what to wear. His work jeans - they were jeans he liked to wear when he was at the construction site - were an option, but he really didn’t want to wear those since they were faded and there was a tear at the knee where he had fallen during a fight a couple of years back. He could wear his tight dark wash jeans, but he didn't think those would be good for tonight. So, he decided upon dark wash jeans and a white t-shirt. Simple, yet nice. At least, he thought it was. After he got dressed he walked to the bathroom to finish styling his hair and getting ready.
“You could say that.”
“So, what kind of art do you like to do?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sure, if you want,” Steve said after a couple of moments. He sat down on the couch, next to his laptop.
“Sure.” Unless it goes terribly wrong, then he wouldn't tell them.
“Thanks.”
“I me-”
“I was worried that you weren’t going to like me.”
“How do you know that? Sometimes people marry the wrong person.”
The second piece was of the Avengers facility before it got destroyed by Thanos.
Tony looked at him with those warm chocolate eyes; his mouth was turned downwards. Steve bit his lip - this was clearly important to him.
Steve smiled at him, but the smile didn’t quite have the warmth that it usually did. The joke was a perfectly fine joke to make, but it hit a little close to home for him. He had been having a difficult time coloring in the drawing because it reminded him of that night, how close he was to doing something stupid. Something that Tony probably would not have forgiven. Maybe he was overreacting to that whole event, but that’s what he thought about every time he looked at the drawing.
“It wasn’t our place,” Bucky said, shrugging. “And Nat figured that you would figure it out eventually once you stopped dating.”
Steve exhaled; he took a step closer to him. “Really?”
Steve glanced at his feet for a moment before looking back at Tony.
Steve excused himself from the table before saying bye to Tony and Pepper, but they didn't hear him. They were having a hushed, but tense conversation. He didn't quite know what it was about. Sighing, he made his way out the room. He had just made it to the lobby when he heard steps behind him; he turned around and raised his eyebrows upon seeing Tony.
“I…well, I wanted to talk to you.”
The smiley face surprised Steve. Using emojis – that’s what he thought they were called, at least – wasn’t something that Tony usually used. At least, not when he texted Steve. He read the message again and looked at the emoji. A smile spread across his lips; perhaps things were changing for the better after all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve watched him for a few moments, his gaze roaming over his face. For some reason, his reaction bothered him. Steve hadn’t seen Tony not get attention very often, but he had seen it enough to know that this was not a typical reaction. Usually he would tilt his head to the side and ask them if they really didn’t know who he was and most of the time, they’d say no. Then they’d ask him for a picture with him.
Steve stared at Tony’s back; his cheeks grew warm. Why did he have to say
Steve continued on his run, focusing on how his shoes echoed off of the cement. He ran around his neighborhood until his head felt clearer. When his thoughts didn’t seem so loud, he made his way back to his apartment. He climbed the stairs and unlocked the door. Stepping in, he tossed his keys onto the table and padded into his bedroom. His phone laid on his end table, screen black. Biting his lip, Steve turned the screen on. He blinked when he saw that there was a message on the screen.
“Really?”
“Then what kind of promise would you like?”
He stared at the ceiling as his thoughts circled back to his encounter with Tony. Well. At least Tony looked okay, all things considered. At least he was alive. That thought helped Steve drift back off to sleep.
“To make me feel better?”
Time seemed to pause for just a moment as Steve took in what he just said. Tony had his own function, but he didn't go to that one so he could be at this one instead. Tony, after months of not really talking to Steve, had decided to come
“No, I do. That sounds good. When would you like to get coffee?”
“Crying won’t help your cause, Rogers."
“It was interesting.”
“Thanks.”
“You know what I mean.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve was about to say something else, but Pepper and Morgan walked in. Pepper’s eyebrows rose when she saw Steve. Steve shifted in his chair. Right. Of course they’d want to visit Tony- they were his family.
[No…suppose I don’t. –Steve]
“No, you’re not. You need to rest.” He placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, Tony will still be here when you wake.”
“Really?”
“Tony, you didn’t have to do that,” Steve whispered.
“So I brought a bunch of different dishes – I wasn’t sure what you liked. But I got fried rice, lo mein, egg rolls, and sweet and sour chicken.”
“I’m sure she was.”
“Are you sure?”
Tony waved his hand. “Nothing to apologize for, Steve. Do you want me to get the coffee?”
Tony shook his head. “I appreciate it, but I’m good. So, how does this work?”
Ten minutes later and Steve still didn’t know what to say. It seemed so silly to get so riled up about this, but sharing his art…he wasn't sure if he wanted to do that.  Tony probably wouldn’t be too hard on him about it, but he wasn’t sure. He closed the door behind him and walked into his bedroom, sliding his bag off of his shoulder so it landed on a chair. Biting his lip, he sat down on his bed. He stared at the screen of his phone for a few moments, trying to decide how to reply. Finally, he typed out a message.
“It’s fine. Work was boring. The board kept telling me that I was wrong about my calculations for a new project we have coming up - we’re investing in solar technology for buildings – but when they finally allowed me to do the calculations in front of them, they agreed with me.”
This is another flashback.
“I’ve worried,” Steve whispered. His voice refused to get any louder.
“You know that’s not true.”
“Why don’t you tell her who you are then?” Steve offered.
Which is how Steve Rogers ended up heading to the Avengers gala by himself. The gala was a celebration of the Avengers’ accomplishments and was about raising money for charity and the facility. He didn’t really want to go to it alone, but he had gone to plenty of functions by himself before. Going to this one alone wouldn’t be any different than going to those. Luckily though, Bucky, Natasha, and Sam were going to the function, so at last he would have people to talk to. He had hoped to be able to talk to Tony, too, but Happy had told him that Tony wasn’t going because he had another function to go to. Apparently after saving the universe, Tony had gone back to helping Pepper run Stark Industries.
Steve hadn’t been surprised that Tony hadn’t wanted to call him, though. He hadn’t expected him to when he had given him that phone; he had just hoped that he would eventually use it.
Steve jolted up; his ribs screamed in pain, but he didn’t care.
Steve and Tony went their separate ways - what will happen now?
“Then why say it?” Tony asked.
The car stopped in front of a tall building made out of red bricks.
“Yes.”
“What are you waiting for?”
you’ve a fine set of lungs but you’re still singing over your brothers so let’s try something new...”
“My friend didn’t think that was a good idea, given that the last time I agreed to ship something for you I had the police crawling all over my ship. Something’s not adding up.”
It had been two days, but Steve could not shake the unease that gripped him, nor the feeling that they were playing with fire. Military operations took a great deal of time to organize and the strike wasn’t planned until early summer. A week more would hardly make much difference; but a week might as well be a year in war time. Anything could happen within seven days to drastically change their lives.
As if he'd ever stopped her before. He nodded automatically and she continued.
It was a wonder mother had been able to accomplish so much with young children to look after. Natacha didn’t doubt that others had looked down on her for the work that had so often taken her away from a woman's place in the home - but Natacha had never felt she lacked for love or maternal influence. It helped perhaps, that Baka had lived with them and could mind them for a few hours each day. Other women weren’t so lucky to have that sort of help.
“Not at all. Kinks and interests here vary as much as I would imagine they do in your world. If a Dom is with a sub who needs or desires heavy pain play or orgasm denial then providing that is just as comforting to their instincts as praise or body worship—with some exceptions, of course. Everyone has their own limits, and if something is too far outside of a Dom’s personal interests then they mostly aren’t going to be fulfilled by providing it. But dominin
“That’s not really necessary,” Rhodes smiled, lifting their submissive’s head and slowly slid away, allowing Bucky to seamlessly replace him. “Tony’s like a kid sometimes; he’s curious as hell, and he absolutely hates feeling like he’s missing out on something. If you keep things too quiet around him when you’re trying to get him to sleep he’ll usually keep himself awake out of sheer stubbornness. Best bet if he starts to stir is to just start blabbing. Soon as he feels like he’s still in the middle of the action he’ll drift right off back to sleep.”
“Come with me, then. I don’t need Rescue if I have Iron Man, and from the sounds of it our little ruse implying we’re not as close didn’t really work anyway.” Steve’s gut dropped, but before he could even process his own panic, he grew aware of the sudden quiet in the room. Tony had been silent for several beats too long, and appeared intensely interested in an unremarkable spot on the kitchen floor. Steve went from attempting to at least pretend he was watching television and not listening to their conversation to practically staring a whole through the other man. (Since when had Tony ever been reluctant to get in the armour, especially to protect the people he loved?)
, a category-9 Dominant, handed the reigns of SHIELD over to Captain Rogers in the wake of project insight. His current whereabouts are unknown to most.
The version of Tony Stark we see in this narrative never resumed a romantic relationship with Pepper Potts following their break-up after the events leading to the creation of Ultron. As such, Morgan Stark was never born.
“Yeah, we’ve talked about your reactions to pain too. Natasha said you seemed to enjoy it, but also feel kind of conflicted about your response.” As he spoke, Steve traced little patterns across Tony’s chest with the crop—at least, Tony was pretty sure the thing was called a crop. “The thing to realize is that while it can be used for punishment, it doesn’t have to be. Pain is also just another kind of sensation. In this case, one that might be just distracting enough to help make it easier for you to do what I’ve asked you to do.”
Otherwise, nothing else I can think of. As always, feel free to let me know if you have questions or concerns about tagging or warnings.
“I think your decision to attempt to build a foundation of friendship with Mr. Stark, regardless of whether or not anything else evolves from there, was a wise one. But we still need to ensure that you’re focusing on valuing yourself and your life beyond that particular dynamic. Were you able to complete the brainstorming exercise I suggested?” Steve’s heart sank. He’d completely forgotten about his ‘homework,’ too focused on the other and more immediate demands on his time and energy over the last several days. “That’s fine. We’ll just try to think this through aloud then. When do you feel best outside of your romantic and sexual relationships? What takes a particular day from just bearable to something better than that?”
The portal itself was soundless; the almighty crash was the result of what followed, which was a body tumbling out of said portal and almost directly into Phil’s lap.
Even with an ally on Steve’s side, trying to get Tony on his own over the course of the next several days proved nearly impossible. If he wasn’t with members of the team who would be decidedly unsympathetic to Steve’s plans, then Tony was with Pepper, planning all the finer details of the upcoming press conference and the celebration on the anniversary of the other Tony’s death. Any spare time after that was devoted to Rhodes, whose visit to the Tower would conclude immediately following the press conference. At first Steve wasn’t entirely certain the avoidance was purposeful, but when his fourth invitation for Tony to join him on his floor for a meal, or even just to sleep, was turned down, he was pretty positive.
“No way, uh-uh, I know that look.”
“Oh please. They’re damn lucky we’re here to help ‘em clean up their mess. Not like they did the same when it was us.” Then, guilted by the memory of a clearly heartbroken Steve Rogers demanding that Tony be selfish, even if it meant Steve and the others lost him for a second time, Rhodey added, “That might have come out a little more bitter than I intended.” Pepper grinned and raised her beer in a lazy salute.
Content Note: In this chapter, Steve's pilot program faces resistance from advocates calling themselves the 'Coalition for Natural Orientational Wellness.' The group is particularly against the potential for using Wakandan cross-training practices, arguing that people should only be encouraged to accept and live within their classified orientation. This rhetoric obviously has a lot of overlap with certain anti-trans positions. These are not arguments I nor any of the protagonists of this story endorse, but they may still be triggering. This sub-plot will be a recurring element of the story, so avoiding it entirely might be difficult, but if you want to skip the more direct representations of CNOW (heh) and their arguments in this chapter, jump past the email Steve reads (beginning 'Director Rogers.')
a girl, Péter thought privately. He’d never be stupid enough to say so to her out loud, but regardless of the tools at his disposal, it was a dangerous journey he wasn’t at all sure would go smoothly. He was thankful when he’d never thought he’d be that he had the pistol Bucky had given him and that his father had taught him to shoot it. He liked it better that she’d be here where it was safe. No matter how tough he knew she was.
Bruce finished, leaving Tony reeling as silence descended. It shook him to his core, hearing how close the man beside him had come once to taking his own life. But in a way, Tony understood. He was no stranger to guilt. No stranger to the feeling that it wasn’t right to live when others had died. Better people, innocent people. Yinsen. His
Tony didn’t understand it. Rogers was not the ogre Tony had once thought him. He was far from unfeeling. He’d given every indication of wanting to be a good father and domesticity looked far too good on him to fool anyone (least of all a genius) into think that family life didn’t make the man happy.
Her dark hair was done up in a stylish bob and her dress had so many sparkles on it, it was almost enough to make a man see spots. But Tony had to be the only one not looking at and gossiping about the surprise addition of a celebrity vocalist, because one of the five men who followed her in carrying heavy instrument cases was none other than Bucky – looking handsome in a slightly too big waist coat.
“Ona!”
Still, Péter had held mixed feelings about joining the other boys in the program. Harry talked it up, but then again Harry was excited about training for the army.
A stab of frustration went through him and he struggled not to outwardly snarl as the children slowly tumbled out of the car to sleepily greet their uncle and take their coats off at the door. Bucky took a moment for each one, and to greet Charlotte but it wasn’t long before he turned to Steve and said the dreaded words.
“Captain Rogers?” That was
The shout rang out through the hallway and Péter blanched, heart dropping into his stomach. Behind them he could hear his siblings stir, the breath they sucked in, the cry of one of the little girls before she was hushed by a low murmur from Natacha. Then everything went still.
(Tony, stop crossing his name out! He’s doing us a favour here.)
A couple of pretty big content notes here: Bruce asks Tony some questions in this chapter about what's going on with food. He is not shaming Tony, nor does he try to force him to eat or do anything that could make the problems worse, but it's not an easy conversation for either of them. If you need to skip that bit, stop reading at "Question for a question, Tony?" and pick up again after the section break. There are also spoilers for the Endgame trailer in that section as well, so if you're avoiding those, I'd also suggest giving it a miss.
Breakfast was horrible. Not the food, this version of Rhodey was a way better cook than his counterpart in Tony’s own universe, but the last thing Tony really wanted was to chance eating. Rhodey ignored each and every protest, laying the table with a protein and fat-heavy meal; he did, at least, pair it with a green smoothie, which Tony seized first with a grudging kind of gratitude.
“How about instead you just tell me what you’re doing here?” Steve rubbed his neck, then gestured to his shield, which sat in a shadowed patch of the hallway outside. (
Peter very nearly groaned aloud when he realized that it wasn’t even the Avengers on the screen now. He supposed it wasn’t all that surprising that Tony’s running SHIELD would eventually mean his obsessive attention to detail would trickle over into that arena as well. Peter also had zero desire to witness it brought to bear on random agents.
For the span of several breaths, the yearning on Kamala’s face was as bare and easy to read as if he’d known the kid her entire life. Tony wondered if the constant challenge that was Peter Parker across two universes was really making him better at this whole kid thing, or if this particular one was just more transparent than others.
“I do. I have seen much of death and its companions in my time, and its spectre never grows easier to encounter.” Thor sounded old, then, so much closer to his actual age than he usually did that Tony looked up at him with a start. Thor’s answering gaze was steady and unshrinking, so unlike the shifting eyes and awkward avoidance Tony had been getting from the others. He let himself drink that in for just a few seconds longer than was probably polite.
? Department heads? I’m pretty sure Jasmine is still out on vacation, and—”
Even as he fought the very real temptation to hide from Coulson (who would be so disappointed if he knew what darkness his childhood hero carried inside him), some part of Steve was relieved by the presence of his handler rather than his submissive. Steve would never have left Coulson in need if he’d been down already, but the thought of having a submissive’s needs and desires in Steve’s control held, for once, very little appeal. How could Steve trust himself to care for and guide someone else when he was so utterly lost?
Content Notes: This is the big one, team! This chapter is almost 10,000 words, and a huge portion of that is sex. But it is, as someone once described most of my smut, sex-with-feels, and in this case pretty important feels that are directly tied to the major plotty developments at the end. Because of that it'll be nearly impossible to skip around the sex, but if you want to try, skip to the very last section break and start reading from there.
It was a close match, made even more entertaining by the trash-talk the girls were throwing at one another. Peter was eager to see how it would end up.
“You said something about cake?”
“Tony.” Pepper’s tone had taken on the patient, slow cadence she only used when she felt his requests were migrating from the realm of the ridiculous to the truly absurd. Hearing it just made him smile more widely.
Clint didn’t give any indication he’d even heard Tony’s outburst, not until a hand closed around Tony’s cock. Not squeezing, not moving enough to provide him with any real friction. Just holding it. His hips hitched, and instantly the warm grip was gone. Tony whined—fucking whined, like some desperate, over-eager teenager—and Clint was leaning over him.
Dummy was holding it by simple ribbon (probably there just because the box itself was too large for the bot to be able to grasp.) Tony took it, glancing around at the room’s very anxious-looking inhabitants. It was hand carved, he could tell that almost immediately; factory production left a different kind of trace on material, made it smooth and sanitized. This was still meticulously made, a dark stained wood with beautiful brass hardware, but it was also full of the kinds of small imperfections that could only be the result of being worked on by a single set of hands.
“Well, I mean you are the guy that the other Cap once told me he would want to take over for him if anything ever happened, so I suppose that makes you either incredibly dorky or pretty okay. Probably both, really.”
“I know it’s pretty selfish, alright? And if there’s big, end of the world kind of stuff then of course I’d help out. And there’s still the Legion, and Ultron, and designing the team’s tech, there’s lots of ways I would still be around and making myself useful. I wouldn’t be your—your kept man or something. Look, can you just, move, or blink, or just say outright that you hate me or something?” Steve snorted.
Hmm. Now, it is true to some extent that I cannot risk the future I have seen by sharing too many details. But it does seem innocuous enough to share, say, some relevant headlines from major news outlets around this date 5 years in the future.
“Different context. I can hardly be a fan of anyone within the walls of SHIELD. Now let’s move on, shall we?”
is in my chambers—”
“I should explain,” Thor boomed cheerfully, correctly reading the look of complete bewilderment that Tony wasn’t even bothering to hide. “While I cannot myself summon rain, it often naturally follows after I call for the thunder, as do high winds whose direction I can control. So I am, on occasion, called out to assist when forest fires threaten to become out of control.”
Given that he’d had no idea that top-drop was even a thing that could happen until his Dominant was in the midst of it right in front of him, Tony thought he’d done fairly well. Of course, Bruce had been the one to actually do the majority of the work, but Tony had at least had the presence of mind to realize that Steve would probably find it reassuring to see Tony checked over by an actual doctor.
It was almost frightening, the speed with which the steady beeping of the heart monitor had become a constant presence wherever Tony happened to be (which was almost always curled up on the bed in the aftercare portion of the playroom.) It was weirdly similar, in a way, to the white noise machine that sat, still pristine and unused, at the end of that same small bed; Steve vaguely remembered that some of the machines they had looked at (which had been aimed mostly at young children and age players) had had setting that were supposed to mimic a heartbeat. But now, instead of white noise serving as a soothing backdrop to a post-scene comedown, the low, mechanical beeping coming from the room’s speaker system served as the only evidence Tony allowed himself to have that his…well, a version of his child was alive and recovering.
“I mean, you’re not wrong,” Tony conceded, spinning in place to give Steve an exaggerated waggle of his eyebrows. “But as I am currently forbidden from wearing the good captain out that particular fashion, I’m forced to get creative.”
, even when he’d put every bit of his goddamn genius intellect into it, Tony had failed more often than he hadn’t. So he’d chalked it up to another consequence of his forced lack of orientational socialization (thanks, Howard!) and accepted that even when forced to cede to his body’s ridiculous requirements, his role as a submissive wouldn’t be any less of an act than his decades-long impersonation of a Switch had been. But right now—now it was like someone had handed him a detailed, well-written and extremely thorough guidebook, and then illuminated the path ahead of him for good measure. For once, Tony knew exactly what to do next.
Steve wanted, frankly, to tell Tony to fetch his own damn snacks and blankets and whatever other comforts he required. Even without being oriented, how could the man have so little awareness as to fail to recognize that Steve was in distress here? But he gritted his teeth and, after a moment of consideration, dug Tony’s—

“I’m sorry I’m late. I changed seven times, and then I realized I hadn’t showered after my work out, and—anyway. I’m sorry. Hi, Tony; hi, James.” Tony nodded, too overwhelmed with relief, still, to speak.
They stepped through the doors, and a woman dressed in a confusing mix of American and Wakandan apparel—skinny jeans and a t-shirt reading ‘Liberté Egalité Beyoncé’ paired with what looked like a vibranium-enforced vest and collar—hurried over.
“Can the two of you write superhero fan fiction when you’re not actively training please?”
“Right. Do you want to…hang out or something? I want to enjoy my newfound freedom a little but I don’t really know where to go especially with all the press and everything, and I thought with all your explorations lately, you might have some ideas.”
“Neither do I. But as I explained on the phone and as I know you confirmed with him yourself, Steve is aware of all the things that matter. He knows who I am, where I come from, and he knew that I was strongly considering getting the bloodwork done before Stark Industries makes the request official. I just…look, I don’t know how superheroes are in your neck of the woods, but they’re a bunch of nosy gossips here. If they knew I was doing this they’d be breathing down both of our necks, and I’d have no space to process whatever the results are on my own.”
“Yessir.”
“The Infinity Stones?” Thor stood up straight, expression more grave than Steve had seen it in recent memory. “How did the
“What, do I have something on my face?”
Steve rolled over then, and Tony had only seconds to mourn the loss of contact before the other man had bracketed Tony’s head with his hands and was bending down to kiss him.
“Where’s your favourite place you’ve ever travelled to?” Tony nearly applauded himself. It was such a
sleep.”
“Why though? I mean I know you’re Mr. Morality, but it’s not like I’m skimming answers off some guy sitting next to me in a test, Rhodey. He was me.”
“I appreciate it, Agent. But I’m sure J can—”
going notice that you still haven’t submitted paperwork from that mess in Pakistan, Clint.” Clint groaned and then made a show of turning his hearing aids down and shouting,

“Did good. Tony perfect as is.”
Dummy completed another lap of the penthouse, ending up at the elevator doors with a truly pathetic little whirring noise. From the couch, Barnes made an answering sound that sounded as if the air had been punched from his gut. This was the final straw.
I think that's it? As always, though, feel free to let me know if you have questions or concerns, or want to see additional tags added to the list.
Thank you so much, as always, for your kudos, questions, and comments. You helped me build and fall in love with this verse, and I love sharing it with you!
“Pretty sure I’m in charge of determining what I need, Sugar Cookie, not you. Besides, I’m saving it for later.” Before Tony could even ask about that little tidbit (saving it for what, some kind of unprecedented sex shortage?) a crisp knock preceded Thor and Phil’s entrance into the room. Phil was dressed down in those jeans that drove Tony crazy, and both he and Thor were wearing shirts in shades of green. The latter beamed and waved jauntily as they stepped inside. Thor couldn’t have presented more of a contrast to Clint if he’d tried, and yet judging from Clint’s complete lack of surprise at their presence, their clothing wasn’t the only thing about this entire encounter that had been coordinated in advance.
“Wait, JARVIS was a person?” It wasn’t the most important question to ask, but maybe that’s exactly why Steve felt able to ask it. The other topics on his mind were too big. By comparison, this was something solid. Easy to take in.
Clint arrived in the penthouse two minutes early the next day, clad in a pair of dark washed blue jeans and a plain grey t-shirt that lovingly hugged chest and abdominal muscles that Tony hadn’t known existed and which he was now apparently doomed to be fixated on forever. He greeted Drama, their robot llama, with all his usual enthusiasm, bending down to pat at the top of her head and throwing a quarter down on the floor for her to collect. (The bot had proved to be a complete klepto, always rooting around in and under furniture for shiny things to steal, a tendency that Clint was way too indulgent of in Tony’s experienced bot-parent opinion.) Then he waited, just as he had the evening prior, for Tony to meet his gaze. It took him close to a minute to manage it this time, he kept wanting to fidget or fixate on something else simply from nerves, but Clint’s patience was a force all its own.
The colour that had drained from Bruce’s face at the mention of Extremis was still gone, but his hands were as steady as ever as he opened a screen on the holotable and started typing a rapid-fire series of notes and questions that Steve could only half-read. Bucky, however, had more immediate concerns. He pointed to the kitchen and directed a menacing glare at all of them in turn.
[Kneeling pillow, extra large, colour: teal]
Steve knew the words were a mistake even as he said them. He had just barely gotten the kid to begin trusting him. Putting Peter on some kind of exhibition for Bucky and Sam, both of whom he barely knew, would undoubtedly have blown up in all of their faces. Even worse, though, is what happens: FRIDAY pauses for so long that Steve begins to wonder who exactly he’s supposed to call if the AI built by a dead man is on the fritz.
“It’s…well, honestly it’s a bit unsettling. You know, of course, that the world is going to go on without you. And I have nothing but praise for how you all have bravely borne a world devoid of me—except the sports teams, someone told me I should yell at all the sports teams.” He paused for the obligatory laugh, then added, “I’m still adjusting and catching up. It’s a process.”
trying,” he insisted. “I mean, not at first because I was pissed and Natasha hadn’t given me any warning and—anyway. I wasn’t trying before but I have been for the past coupla times. I do want to try to get better, to make it so that I can least be around…him. I just don’t think I can.” Steve could count the number of times he had willingly given up on something on one hand, so the admission cost him. He really didn’t want to fail at this. He definitely didn’t want to have to go back down to the team and tell them, what, that they’re going to have to figure out some kind of time share where the new Tony gets the team part of the time and Steve gets them the rest? As if they’ve been through some kind horribly messy divorce and can no longer stand to be in the same room as one another?
Reality crept back in slowly. Steve spent most of the next couple of days at work. Tony had intended to do the same, and he did manage to get the odd thing done here and there. He added a few things to the newest model of the quinjet, spent some time familiarizing himself with the intricacies of Clint’s hearing aids, and even ended up chatting with a rehabilitation centre about sharing the code for the holographic volleyball system. (It turned out there was a lot of potential for contact-less sports, which made sense given the old Tony’s notes about designing several of the little games in the house system to help Barnes with his new arm.) The nearer his meeting with Dr. Chimva grew, the more desperate Tony felt to cling to the team before it all changed.
Realizing there was one face he hadn’t seen as he’d stumbled in, Steve peered around the room until his eyes fell upon Tony, who lay half asleep on the other couch, his head pillowed against Bucky’s chest. Bucky, in turn, lay sprawled out with his head in Phil’s lap, not an ounce of the forced submission he’d so often fallen into before the trip about him as Phil idly traced patterns on his back. Clint followed Steve’s gaze and grinned.
“I don’t, Steve, really. But I’m not on full vacation like the rest of you, and since we don’t know when or if I should be pleasant for scenes like this, might as well get that stuff done.”
“Why what?”
Naturally, it couldn’t last. People began to trickle in, slowly at first and then in greater numbers as word apparently got out that Captain America was tearing apart the gym. Pictures and video were, thankfully, forbidden in most areas of SHIELD HQ, a rule everyone had quickly learned to respect when Natasha and Clint had started hunting violators from the vents, stealing their phones and downloading images of their most vicious ops as warnings. So it was mostly a lot of staring and whispering at first. Then Alex, a 32 year old Dominance-oriented switch with documented ego problems and a hint of a death wish had challenged Steve to a match in the full-sized wrestling ring that dominated the centre of the room.
“If we’re going to be friends I need all the intel first. What exactly did you order?”
“Language.” The warning had fallen from Tony’s mouth before he'd even realized he was going to speak at all, and he groaned, putting his face in his hands. If Rhodey ever found out he was never going to live this first meeting down.
By now, Tony was well used to waking with at least one body pressed up against his own. It was the kind of thing that still felt slightly unbelievable in its banality; even a couple of months ago, the thought of being accustomed enough to the constant presence and touch of others that he wouldn’t feel startled by it all over again in the morning felt unachievable. But now even the less familiar press of Bucky’s metal arm against his stomach made Tony feel more at home in his own skin. He wondered privately if a collar might make him feel this way all the time, a constant physical reminder of how much Tony had keeping him here.
“I wasn’t sure whether you knew that you had an arachnid twin out there and were trying to protect her, or if you really had no idea. Judging from the bug-eyed thing you have going on right now—heh, bug-eyed, get it?—I’m going with option b.”
“Like…well, Rhodey said that making mistakes wasn’t safe for me before, and part of that was never feeling like I was done paying. I liked that when it was over it was just—over. He didn’t still seem mad, or disappointed or anything. And it didn’t feel like he was just storing it away to use during a later fight or something.”
I would need something with at least the strength of Asgardian mead to be willing to discuss Wade Wilson. However, personal questions in general are perfectly fine; I can hardly blame you for finding me compelling. In this universe I was initially classified as a category 8 dominant. After becoming sorcerer supreme, however, my classification shifted slightly  (a rare but not unheard of response to sustained interactions with magic in various forms.) I am now a category 6 switch.
Everyone in the room winced as one. Everyone but Tony, who met Bucky’s fury and his shame and his self-hatred without so much as blinking.
Nearly all of them were like that. Steve could have stared a bingo card of the major themes that came up in each and every message: the workplace is for work, cross-training is evil, you’re a True, don’t you know? The boldest of them even brought up Tony directly, ‘reminding’ Steve that his own submissive hadn’t always embraced his orientation, but he’d been so happy once he did! Did Steve really want to deny that kind of healing journey to others?
“So you crashed the fighter jet, not because there was any imminent harm to public safety, but because, and I’m quoting here, ‘the would-be pilot was a twatwaffle.’” Leaning against the wall with her back pressed against the door, Talia’s only reply was a smirk at hearing Maria utter the word ‘twatwaffle.’ Undoubtedly that had been her entire aim in placing such a ridiculous turn of phrase in her statement to begin with. “This would be the part where you elaborate, where you try to convince Director Rogers, Agent Coulson and myself that there’s some crucial information missing from the report, that you didn’t just willfully destroy the property of the American military because some jacked-up private with an attitude pissed you off.”
“Oh god. Bruce, no, no, you have to—Bruce, I’m gonna piss myself, I’m gonna, please—”
He lasted only another twenty minutes before he requested directions to the training level. If he’d expected something like the shared gym the Avengers had had in both the Tower and the compound, stepping out of the elevator pretty much instantly put that theory to rest. There were no weight machines or treadmills or heavy bags in sight; the space (which he suspected from the barely visible ceiling started on this floor but extended several levels beyond it) was wide open, save for a complex array of digital and physical obstacles the team appeared to be locked in battle against.
Justin Leiber, “Can Animals and Machines Be Persons?”
Pepper Potts is a category 3 submissive, though this ranking is somewhat debatable. Her family insisted she be classified according to the older models (those which considered only biochemical factors and ignored social indicators.) It is possible with those factors considered she might have have been classified as a category 4 or 5 switch.
“Is it from uncle Bucky? James asked, the other six lighting up at the mention of their favorite and only uncle.
Steve was a still as marble taking in the words. Bucky watched him take in a small breath before he replied.
“I think I know a way to throw them off our scent.”
No more hurtful words and no more pointless arguments.
“She’d sing to us too.” James murmured and Tony nodded, looking down at Artur.
Péter peddled to a stop feet away. From over the small distance Steve could see his breath rising and falling as if he'd raced all the way home from town. He knew the moment Péter caught sight of him. Péter's shoulders stiffened and his movements become stiff as he went about putting his bicycle away. Steve took a seat on the step and watched him, his stomach churning in knots.
What if he’d been more injured than Steve thought and why hadn’t he checked? What if more men had come to demand Jews come out? What if he’d decided to go back to the abbey anyway, despite all their warnings? Where was he?! Steve needed to know and he didn’t know! They needed to all be together, but they weren’t, and Tony was…Tony was
Apparently one never knew when they’d have to set up a tent.
Bucky snapped his mouth closed and graced him with a blank look. The corner of his lip twitching in what Steve was sure wanted to be a snarl and irritation settled in Steve's stomach. He was not an invalid who needed to be led to water. If he damn well wanted to swim he’d swim and not a moment before!
Slowly Stefen stepped closer and kneeled down in front of the pair, so that he was no longer towering above them and Tony watched as he spoke quietly to them in what Tony was only sure wasn’t polish. Personally he doubted it was Ukrainian either, if only because being heir to a ship building empire meant that he’d been schooled so that he could converse with most of the major powers in Europe.
“Not with you blowing your smoke all over the place,” he replied softly. The Romany sounded stiff in his ears but it came easier and easier to his tongue with every word spoken, like ice melting in his mouth.
Maria opened her mouth to protest but was distracted by a sudden shriek from Artur. Tony looked over that way, just to be sure no one was drowning, to find Artur gesturing wildly with excitement. Péter could be heard telling him to hold whatever it was he had gripped in his hands still.
Cameron’s haunted eyes, which had been staring sightlessly at his hands a moment before swiveled to meet Péter’s. They were filled with tears.
. Steve leaned down, inhaling shakily, and began to check the wound beneath the crusted bandage on Tony’s forehead. The cut wound all the way up into his hairline, though you could hardly see it now through the bruising that surrounded the area. It was thankfully not a very deep gash and not in need of stitches.  The bruising on Tony’s face made it look worse than it was. He was so purple and blue, as if someone had taken offense to his face and tried to rip it off. Steve’s gut clenched tightly.
Decided, Tony did what he’d been avoiding all week and made his way to the captain’s office.
But he was a danger to himself and to them.
"Shh. Lower your voice." Natacha snapped at him, glancing at Daniel and the other children sat across from them. The older boy was staring at them curiously but he didn't say a word. Maria reached across Artur’s lap and patted James thigh. “Don’t worry,” she said. “Tony will find us.”
They shared a certain familiarity, what with Charlotte’s grandmother being a Von Trap. She’d maid a fantastic marriage into a noble family (rich in title but hurting in purse) and even though the title was obsolete now, Charlotte had never been allowed to forget that she was related to emperors and princes (however distantly) though she didn’t care so much about that.
Tony’s grip softened on his arm, his other hand coming to rest on Steve’s shoulder and rubbing gently. Steve’s breath was loud in the minimal space between them, ragged in his ears.
She'd danced too, mostly strong arming Péter into what might be called a waltz by forest gnomes. When the boys had come along they'd become her dance partners.
~*~*~*~
"Yes." Tony said as if it were only a fact and not an utter betrayal of Steve's trust. The simple admission sliced through him like a knife to his side. He wasn’t entirely convinced he wouldn’t look down and find blood on his uniform.
“He ate under the clouds more than he did the dining room ceiling but he lost interest in it when Margrit died.”
“The children have not been well Stark. I don’t like them to exhaust themselves.”
The thought when it came was nowhere close to charitable.
“Except for the part where it involves children. I know nothing about them.”
The cafe crowd was mostly made up of artists, musicians, free thinkers. Most of them young people, university students who didn't know any better or care if they were seen in the leopoldstadt district, crowded as it was with Jews. The owners weren’t Jewish or gypsy to Steve's knowledge but it didn't really matter when the Reich was cracking down on places like this. Where passion and free thoughts were free to flow rebellion often sprung.
The motion of Steve’s head slowed down, his mouth dragging down Tony’s shaft with an uncoordinated scrape of teeth that drove a hiss of pain from Tony even as something electric danced down his spine. He’d never felt this way before, never wanted to take something so badly and come down another’s throat like a perfect heathen, and he’d slept with seasoned professionals. There was no artifice to the way that Stefen sucked him. No skill, too much teeth, and his strength was flagging by the second, but Steve was looking up at him between sweat soaked bangs with hazy eyes that begged him to take the reins, to take them both where they needed to be and Tony couldn’t have turned away for all the angels in the heavens.
The door closed behind the busboy and Tony heard the lock slide with a click that rang in his ears with finality. He stood frozen, staring blankly at the lavish sitting room without really seeing it as the sound of footsteps retreated outside the door.
“Having just come from Italy, perhaps you can explain it then, how it is that so many other great civilizations have thrived, often times over taking our own. Rome and her Italic allies for example.”
Tony meets the children (and several little friends) and Steve might have bit off far more than he can chew.
“Yes.”
Rome wasn’t built in a day.
“The Carboni’s are Jews. Old family. They owned the port before Austria took Pola.” Kirk dropped. “But it’s a common enough name in those parts. The Starks got married in the church far as I know, and for that you got to be catholic. And you sure as hell don’t meet many Jewish monks.”
He turned his head, desperately seeking the captain’s mouth and buried the groan he couldn’t hold back against his lips. Tony kissed him with everything he had, his chest raw, the breath they shared between them too sweet and too little after so long feeling like he was slowly suffocating. They kissed, and they kissed, hungry and deep, until Stefen pulled away to catch his breath, chest pushing against Tony’s with every exhale. Tony let his trembling hands travel over Stefen’s back while he struggled to collect himself.
“You must hear this a lot, but you remind me of Captain Adventure.” Bethany’s cheeks pinked with slight embarrassment as Tony inclined his head curiously. “My father is a subscriber. Are you familiar with the magazine?”
In the quieter moments, between when the effects of the drugs had waned and the next round of experiments began, familiar calloused fingers would grip Steve’s jaw, everything else but that touch melting into oblivion.
Ian nodded and shuffled closer.
“Jacob Yinsen,” Nik finished and Tony could feel himself pale.
He found Bucky and Natacha in the captain’s room asleep on the chase lounge. They’d pulled it up closer to the bed and had fallen asleep, Natacha’s head resting against Bakhuizen’s chest, and her small frame looking doll like tucked under his arm.
Bucky banged something loudly in the bathroom and Steve grinned as his friend’s voice floated through the thin walls.
“Report?” he asked, as if the three of them weren’t whispering in the dark with only the occasional flash of lightning to illuminate them, and he weren’t clutching to Tony’s sleeve like a lifeline. If Bucky thought anything about that was strange he didn’t say so, though he stared long and hard at Stefen in a silent battle of wills, communicating in that wordless language all their own that two people built over a lifetime together.
“On the contrary Herr Stark, I find myself constantly curious as to what goes on in your mind.” When Tony narrowed his eyes at him Stefen’s mouth spread into the kind of expression someone kinder would have called innocent. It put Tony in mind of little James so fortunately he knew better.
Even if it was only their names signed on coded letters to their favorite gardener. There may come a time when their names would be all they had left.
“Good. Who does the washing?” Tony interjected, having neither the time or the patience to discuss anything that wasn’t Stefen’s immediate care.
Sometimes Steve couldn’t tell whether he was the last rational man left in the entire household, or if he had slipped off some edge and lost his mind altogether. The worst part was he didn’t really care. It didn’t matter in the end if he was sane or not. The danger was all the same.
“I see.” Tony acknowledged. “Do you think she’d be less scared if you went with her?”
So you see, he was deep in thought when Natacha suddenly appeared at his elbow and hummed deeply in disapproval.
Rain was a miserable business that Tony was going to do away with someday. Someday, when he was not running like a beaten dog with its tail tucked between its legs. Someday soon. Today it rained.  The sky had been dark and gray for two days straight, the rain coming down in steady torrents that showed no sign of letting up.
Tony smiled and settled deeper into his seat, determined to enjoy every last beautiful drop.
“No it isn’t!” James immediately snapped and Artur stuck his tongue out at him.
“Her voice is a true testament to the strength of her German blood. Tomorrow all of the young men in this room will be breaking down the door of my office crying, Frau Ursala, Frau Ursala, I must have the song bird, but is she suitable?” The woman, Ursala, cackled brightly with amusement.
"Frauline Werner is not just here to question whether you are fit to become a group leader in the BDM, she is here to question the loyalty of this house and everyone in it. And where they find fault they will act." He asked slowly, "Do you understand?”
Steve watched him cross the room to the bar and pour himself a drink. He’d drank quite a bit during dinner and it showed in his loose posture.
“Mountain troopers huh?” Bucky grunted later as the car took them back toward the hotel. There was a wealth of meaning behind the sound and when their eyes met Steve could see his own ghosts staring back at him. “Any of the old team crazy enough to come back for seconds besides you?”
Despite his loose-limbed posture Steve wasn’t fool enough to think Tony was in any way relaxed. A bottle of Genever (most likely pinched from Bucky’s room) rested open on the table, no glass in sight. Steve approached Tony carefully, eyeing the nearly empty bottle. For once he actually hoped that Bucky’s efforts had gone into draining the bottle as much as Tony’s.
Sara had what looked like half her meal on her face for no apparent reason other than she was enjoying making Tony work for each bite that made it to her mouth.
“I came to see if maybe you had learned anything from washing up blood and sick all day,” Nik answered him with a droll expression. Tony could tell he thought it was doubtful, and never let it be said that Tony didn’t live up to people’s low expectations.
“General, it's a waste of science to-”
First was Péter, the oldest judging by height: a tall skinny brunette wearing spectacles. Then came Natacha: too pretty for her own good, too old in her eyes. Ian: stiff spine, serious mouth, eerily reminiscent of his father despite the lack of obvious resemblance. James: clearly trouble. Artur: could have been his father’s twin aged down, but fidgety and desperately curious about the stranger in their midst. Maria: sweet, shy, a dark haired beauty, too reminiscent of home.
Charlotte’s aunt and uncle had retired to the swiss house permanently after Peggy’s death, but aunt Sophie was always hungry for news of how Charlotte was getting on, even if she was strongly against her relationship with Stefen. Charlotte tried not to begrudge the woman her frosty attitude toward Stefen and the children. It was a terrible thing to bury a child at any age, and Margrit had left the world far sooner than she might have, had she never crossed paths with Stefen. Charlotte had always viewed their union with such romance. Oh, to love someone so strongly, that she’d risk it all for them. Oh, to be loved by someone who would give up their life for her.
“You think that I’m the smartest one here?” Tony asked, eyebrow raised.
Steve nodded. “I’m glad you do.”
“It’s not that.”
“You could’ve fooled me,” Bucky said, glancing at him. He walked over to the cutting board that was on the kitchen island. “Sorry for interrupting you.” He gestured to the slices of tomato and lettuce. “Looks like it was going to be an exciting dinner.”
“You assholes turn your eyes.” Bucky snapped at the gawking men that had drawn closer. They quickly averted their eyes and Jann huffed a small laugh, which turned into a gasp and a wince as Bucky began unwrapping her makeshift bandages.
Peter kept walking and pushed his hood up a little more.
Peter sighed in relief as the AI he programmed, without his father's knowledge, did as he asked.
“He already ate breakfast so he’s probably down in his lab or the garage,” Steve responded.
Please leave a comment telling me what you think!!
“My boyfriend,” he replied.
Wade sighed and rested his chin on Peter’s head, “I’m not going to sleep with you in hopes that it will make you feel better, and I really don’t want to explain to your dads that it wasn’t statutory rape.”
His dad just shrugged, “take one of mine.”
“Scared of what?” His pops asked.
One he was on his back Peter stood over him and punched him repeatedly till he was satisfied. Osborn was bleeding profusely and Peter slowly stood up from where he was leaning over him and yelled “You ruined my life!”
His suit was torn and he could very clearly see the burnt and bleeding skin.
“Imma kill a man,” Tony said as he got up and marched out of the room.
His dad might kill him.
Then the goblin threw a punch and they started physically fighting. Peter would throw punches and kicks landing most of them, and sadly so did Osborn. Peter was getting pretty beat up.
Peter let out a sigh and turned to the rest of his room. It was about the size of a small apartment. It had his bed, which literally hovered off the ground, some couches, multiple tv’s, a mini kitchen with a fridge and a microwave, some holotables, a bunch of shelves with books and Avengers equipment, and of course his own bathroom.
“Yes dad, and you don’t need to tell me, Jarvis and my alarm clock tell me every day.”
Peter went for nonchalance and leaned on the wall as he called out, “Quite a tantrum your having huh.”
“Yeah and you’re 17, not 18,” Wade responded.
If only he knew how wrong he was.
His dad laughed and Peter tried to hide his smile and got up to go to his closet. His closet was huge, about the size of a master bedroom, and it hid a huge secret. Peter rearranged his closet a while ago under the disguise of trying to stop buying a lot of clothes. What he really did was make it about 90% smaller. Instead of being the size of a master bedroom it was just a wall with hangers and shelves. His parents were supportive, but little do they know that behind the wall he put in there is a miniature lab full of his Spider-Man equipment.
If only his dad knew how ironic that was.
“Okay as I was saying to calculate moles you…” Peter spaced again.
Wade looked at his brown locks with a frown and kissed his head.
Peter groaned once again.
“Yeah,” Peter said with the briefest hints of a smile.
“I prefer the sun, don’t you?” Peter asked as he dodged yet another pumpkin bomb.
“Pancakes, waffles, eggs, sausage, croissants, bacon, and toast,” he replied.
“Ahhh, just the bug I was looking for,” Norman Osborn said with a sneer.
“What’s it made out of?” Steve asked.
“You heard me, I don’t like seeing my son injured and what makes you think you can save the world?” Tony snapped back.
Peter laughed lightly and pulled out of the hug. That’s when Steve noticed the destroyed suit and blood stains on Peter.
He has multiple suits, web fluid, diagrams, and scanners that alert him as to when there’s crime in the city. Peter’s quite proud of it, even though it’s nothing compared to his own downstairs. Of course he has his own lab, but he can’t hide his spidey work from his parents down there, in his closet he can.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter just nodded.
Then Peter haphazardly threw on his mask and swung to his boyfriends apartment.
“Peter Parker!”
“No shit Jarvis,” he replied.
Tony wrapped his arms around Peter and gave him a squeeze.
“The lion of Austria.” Vonkov filled in eagerly, his beady eyes traveling up and down Steve’s body as if he wanted to strip him and go over every last inch of him with a magnifying glass.
“An old friend of your Da, who you don’t talk about unless it’s to share some memory that makes me wish I knew how to beat the dead,’” Stefen returned with a pointed drawl and Tony was torn between scowling at his ill-timed perceptiveness or licking his lips because his gypsy was showing.
Péter swallowed back the sting of guilt her words left behind them. He knew how important appearances were to the Nazis.
Rogers, who had been chatting quietly with Herr Hogan about the condition of the roads after the rain, turned once the last bag had been secured and the trunk of the vehicle closed with a smart thud and regarded his children.
“If we can get a letter out, we can establish a line of communication between ourselves and the Austrian resistance effort.”
