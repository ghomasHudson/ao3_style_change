“I trained for years, John, years to perfect my hearing, all my senses and my knowledge of every route in London. I only started working with Lestrade two years ago. It's not always easy, because they're all a bunch of idiots. My blindness means that I miss a lot of important details, and when no one is willing to help me, then of course they never catch their killer . Bunch of morons the lot of them. Thank god you were there tonight, or I never would have realized that the killer had taken her suitcase. Has he replied yet?”
Sherlock reaches out for John, who grasps his hand and pulls him close. The younger man buries his face in his partner's neck to muffle his deep laughter. Just the sound of those vocal cords makes John weak at the knees. He strokes Sherlock's neck to help calm him and bites his own lip to contain his mirth.
Jack hugs his Pa tighter. Sherlock looks at his brother for guidance, but Mycroft appears just as confused as he is. John steps forward. “Come on, Jack, why don’t we go for a walk? There must be something you’d like to see.”
As I walk into the living room and I find uncle Mycroft sat in Pa’s chair. He has his ‘laptop’ on his knees and he is frowning his War Face at the screen.
She smiles and hugs me tight. “He has to be the one to decide that dear. But in my eyes, he is very special to me.”
"He was born about a year after they took me. I told you they removed my chains after three months... That's because..." he stops, recalling her joy and his horror at the situation. "I kept telling myself it was all a lie, that it wasn't mine, but she wasn't lying. I delivered him. I didn't want to, but they made me read books and on the day Old Magnussen brought a knife in and said he'd think of something creative if I didn't cooperate. I was seventeen and I was scared so I did what I'd read in the books. I just held him and when she asked if it was a girl, she was relieved when I said no. Overjoyed even."
His body starts to shake uncontrollably and he looks up at Strip Light. It flickers once. Warm tracks make their way down his face and it takes him a moment to realise he’s crying. A high pitched keen escapes his throat and he clamps his hand over his mouth to keep quiet. He must not despair in front of Jack. No matter what, Jack must be able to depend on him. It’s his own fault, he shouldn’t have shouted. His body wracks with sobs he can’t let out. Why can’t Jack see? He mustn’t blame him. Jack is only five and isn’t prepared to have his whole world ripped apart by the person he trusts. He’ll have to try another approach.
Sherlock cocks his head. “The thought of the boy usually aggravates you. We don’t want to involve him in our… business.” He’s ignored.
“It’s John Watson. I’m calling about your boyfriend. Get over here now before he starts a nuclear war.”
I’m really hungry now, so I kick my legs to make him move the laptop and let me go. I run to the kitchen and get a bowl, my cereals, milk and spoon. I use Mrs. Hudson’s stool to climb onto my chair with the pillow to help me see the table. It’s only when I finish that I realise Uncle Mycroft didn’t say anything about my suggestions. I’m not surprised though. I don’t really understand his job. Pa says he just presses buttons and drinks tea. But I think it’s a bit harder than that.
deduce Them correctly. His asking for a present for Jack reignited an interest in Them. He feels sick. This is all his fault. All he can do is divert Their attention. He’s not a religious man, but he’s close to praying at this point.
“No, Jack, for real, in a real house with a garden and I went to a real school with real people. The people on TV are real, Jack, they’re being filmed, that’s why we can see them, that’s why everyone can see them.”
The door is opened and John hears DI Lestrade's voice float up the stairs. He's friendly enough and Sherlock has classified him as a Not Idiot, along with Mike Stamford and his brother. John has yet to know if he's in any particular category.
Sherlock runs and falls, his legs giving out, his injuries demanding care and attention, but all he can see is Jack, Jack’s alive,
Eight months after the birth, Sherlock is cleaning the floor. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the child crawling across the floor, heading for the bed. He ignores it and continues his chores until he hears the baby make happy sounds, a noise Sherlock isn’t used to hearing from this child. He spins around.
Sherlock's face is covered in blood and there are bruises forming on his forehead, cheekbones and throat. John cries and gathers the unconcious form into his arms. He struggles to find a pulse.
Mycroft's eyes open and he finally spots the two men standing opposite him him in the doorway. He somehow manages to plaster a smug look on his face in spite of his current position.
All eyes turn to the younger Holmes. "Jack defeated the giants... A part of me hoped he would defeat the Monsters too." Sherlock smiles at his son proudly. "My little hero."
“Do you know what we’re going to do today?” asks Sherlock, watching Jack with anticipation. The small boy shakes his head. “We are going to bake a birthday cake.”
“No!” He runs after me. “Get back here. This is beyond you or John. There is no need to get him involved.”
“It’s against the law. If the police knew we were here, they would rescue us. Your uncle Mycroft would rescue us. I’ve tried to escape numerous times, but there are two of Them and Old Magnussen, he’s very careful and incredibly intelligent. That’s how he was able to trick me in the first place.”
"John, I know this is all very confusing for you, but I need you to check Sherlock's vitals." The world trembles. John doesn't flinch.
"If he refuses, we simply have to make out in front of him, until he gives us the documents. We'll try to avoid shagging on his desk though, we don't want to have to exile ourselves to Siberia."
“Please, you have to take him to a hospital. I can’t do anything for him here, I’m not a doctor. It could be serious, I-“
John’s throat tightens. Damn Sherlock’s parents. “She’s loved you from the moment she heard about you. Mycroft, have you seen Jack? Mycroft! Look at your nephew.”
“Doctor Watson, I have no intention of endangering my nephew. If you do not cause me bodily harm, I have no doubt Sherlock will. I’m simply considering the surprise element of Jack’s theory. Besides, using Jack to speak for me would only make me look like a fool.”
Sherlock pinches the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. “This is real. Please let me finish. It’s important,” he grits out impatiently. “I thought I was being followed. But it wasn’t my brother. It was Old Magnussen and the Witch. The Witch… wanted a ‘friend’ and she chose me. I looked physically appealing to Her and They were both interested in my intellect, so They contacted me. Sent me a letter telling me They wanted my help solving a case the police hadn’t been able to handle, a violent murder. And I was so desperate to show off, to prove how clever I am that I rushed off to meet Them without thinking. I told my mother I was going to London to meet some clients. It wasn’t far from where we lived. When I got there, They were waiting for me,” he shakes his head, recalling his own stupidity. “He reached out to shake my hand, saying stuff about how They were my biggest fans. Then he stuck a needle in my arm and she shoved a bag over my head,” he pauses, sadness etched across his face like paint, “and then I was here. Taken away from my life and my future to be locked in a vault against my will. So young and stupid. I never wanted to be here, Jack.”
The door opens and John straightens. He's a bit gutted when Prince Charles steps out. Not the best diplomacy the Queen could send, but it would do. The Prince straigntens, eyeing John carefully. "Doctor Watson, do you know where you are?"
She shakes her head. "I can't prove sexual assault before death, but yes, this does seem likely. I'm so sorry."
Suddenly aware that his leg is shouting abuse at him, he stumbles abruptly and the person behind collides with him. He watches in mild fascination as the world spins and he wonders if he can keep that bee buzzing along over there…
John pulls him against his chest and rubs his back. “I can hear Jack calling us. Let's go back and be with him and we'll discuss this with Mycroft later. Okay?”
“No thinking about my brother when I’m about to perform a fellatio on you, thank you very much.” Says Sherlock, reading his mind as is standard with him. “It just puts us both off.”
Smirking again and ignoring Sherlock's bemused face, they left the flat together. Sherlock needed him, and vice versa. He would start his blog tomorrow.
Sherlock glances at John. "At lunch. John made sandwiches and I ate everything, drank my tea and he watched me take them. I didn't feel so bad about eating today."
John pets his hair. "It's okay, once Greg is over the high of his testosterone, I'm sure he'll be really embarrassed about the whole thing and this incident will never be mentioned again. But now you'll never to break into your brother's home or office again, I suppose, hey?
The next day They come in. When she’s finished with him, she puts her clothes back on and stops outside the wardrobe. Sherlock watches.
Sherlock looks down at Jack, who nods and seemingly regains his confidence. “Okay, I would like to thank him properly.”
Please be warned, there is a non graphic NON-CON scene at the end of this chapter, but it is there. This will be the last one in this story.
“No! Please don’t hang up. Please. I just… I need to hear your voice. I need to know you’re okay. After what happened… I haven’t slept, and I know all of this is my fault, and I know you hate me, but please don’t hang up,
Breathing gradually becomes easier. John's hand strokes his hair and something wet drips onto his forehead. John. John is crying.
Afterwards, Sherlock hugs Jack and Mycroft tells him to move on. Sherlock wants to tell him to fuck himself. Instead, he tells him he can make his own decisions. But then his brother insists. “I know you can’t make your own decisions. If you could, you never would have been kidnapped and two children never would have died
face, enjoying the confused look in her eyes. "You killed my niece and nephew. Suffocation, I hear. As much as I want to kill you with my bare hands like you did Charlotte, I have decided that there are far more creative ways. I was going to stand here and ask you why you were going to plead Not Guilty, why you were going to blame Sherlock and more importantly, how you were planning on getting away with it, but I know that the more you talk, the better it is for you. So I'm not going to ask. I just wanted to get a good look at you whilst I said goodbye." A pause. “Lestrade.”
He rips Jack out of the man’s arms and holds him close. There’s nothing except them. He stumbles and sinks to his knees, his face pressed against Jack’s hair. Lights flash around them. People try to get closer. An orange blanket is wrapped around his shoulders. He opens his mouth and takes a huge, stuttering breath. They’ve done it.
“Body is three feet in front of you,” he says, “Feet at nine o’clock, body twisted so that head is at two o’clock. Here,” he runs his fingers across Sherlock’s palm, “is the victim, knife about a foot away, here at eleven o’clock. Serrated blade, black handle, plastic, something you’d find in a hardware store.” He pauses to glance over at the police car. “Two witnesses, can’t see much from here. Where do you want to start?”
Isn't aware of the pain spreading from his ankle and travelling up his leg. If he doesn't stop running then he won't be able to save them from the Monsters, but they're getting further away,
Sherlock gasps and John is worried he will try to fight him off like he did with all the doctors and nurses. But his lover smiles bright.
John huffs out a laugh. He’s going to take Sherlock back to Baker street, drag him up the seventeen steps, haul him into his bed and have his way with him, scary dreams be damned. Sherlock wouldn’t lose any of his other senses, although if he could make him speechless, that would be a major…
“But if he’s a bad guy, he might know how good guys think, and that’s how he always escapes. Maybe you need to try something different. If he’s expecting you and what you always do, then he’ll know how to ignore you.”
Sherlock hiccups quietly. All colour drains out of Mycroft’s face. “If I hadn’t been captured, they would have lived…”
Sherlock stares lovingly at his son, before shoveling more food into his mouth. They finish their meal in silence.
Back at the flat, he heads straight to the bathroom. John calls out to him, probably to talk about that disastrous attempt at a kiss. He ignores him.
A hand grabs a fistful of his hair and pulls his head back. She spits in his ear. “By the time I’m done with you, you’ll-“
“I said get out of my flat. Or I’ll throw you out so hard even your precious government won’t be able to fix the damage.” He glares until Mycroft breaks eye contact.
John holds up his hand, cutting him off. He leans towards Sherlock, studying his face. The man’s eyes are twitching, and John suddenly notices a few beads of sweat. He’s breathing far too fast. He’s starting to lose it.
She’s shocked by my question but answers honestly, as I predicted. “Well, if I were to meet you for the first time, I would think you are a girl. Why do you ask?”
Sherlock. Somehow the name suited him completely. Complimented him. His face had strange angles, which made him all the more appealing to look at, John thought. Darl curls and skinny frame; he was obviously someone who had girls throwing themselves at him from left and right.
He pauses, the idea of a bit of pain and excitement thrilling him. Just to remind him he's alive. But alive hurts, it hurts so much, and his head swivels until he's staring at the bath.
Mycroft nods. “Yes. I lashed out. My emotions got the better of me. I blamed myself for you being here, I missed Gregory terribly, I didn’t know how to talk to Jack and I ended up hunting down a petty criminal and riddling him with so many bullets I’m sure they had to use tweezers to put him in the body bag. My emotions got the better of me, and I hurt one of my nephew’s favourite people. I have failed the few people I can truly consider to be family.”
"We're fine, Mrs. Hudson." John eyes her weapon of choice wearily. "I was playing with Jack and I injured myself. It's not a problem. But thank you for, uh, rescuing us."
The idea hits him in the face, almost shattering his ego and making him blush at his own stupidity. He should have seen it coming, because he’d been observing Sherlock all morning.
"I woke to William crying. They'd come in whilst I was asleep and they had him lying on the table and they were trying to..." Sherlock chokes vomit threatening to come up his throat. "They were, ah, trying to do..., b-b-bad things, so I leapt up and I tried to fight them off. I was furious... it'd never occured to me that she would do that to him..."
Squawking from Mycroft interrupts them. It's obvious who's losing. "Do we have to? Things are getting better."
John doesn't think. He grabs the rock at his side and hurls it at his opponents face.As it hits, John leaps forward and slams his palms on either side of his face and cuts off the other man's cries with a sharp punch to the throat. Silent, his enemy crumples and John whips out his gun, aiming it at the next closest man, freezing him in his tracks.
John stops his tea making to consider the question. The prolonged silence makes Sherlock twitchier. “I think,” he says eventually, “I think that the world has changed a lot in thirteen years. There’s a lot you need to catch up on. A lot you must learn. But I see how you remember things so quickly and in so much detail. I don’t doubt you’ll navigate fine given some time. I think that in a couple of months, the media and the public will calm down and move on to some other dramatic story and people won’t even recognise you. You’re going to be fine, Sherlock.”
“Please take him away. I can’t bear it, just take him and bury him somewhere safe, please,” he sobs in despair. He cries, his limbs wrapped around the small form. Then gently this time, the Witch drags him away, while Old Magnussen picks up the rolled up Rug. He grunts as he lifts it.
“That’s good, that’s very good. Don’t worry, they’re gone, you’re safe now. Just take deep breaths.” A hand runs through his hair. “You’re alright, I’ve got you. Thank God, we’ve finally found you, after all this time.”
“But I want a present. I’ve never had a present before, only the ones you make me. I want a dog, like Redbeard.”
“I know you did not look at the document, sir. You did not open it before your brother, nor did you ask the lawyer what he requested to be written on your nephew's certificate.”
The ensuing silence lasted for a moment before Sherlock suddenly requested Mike's phone. When the latter denied having it on him, John hurried to offer his own. He had a burning desire to reach this amazing man's expectations. As he tugged it out of his jacket pocket, Sherlock walked over to him. Reaching out rather hesitantly, he placed his hand on John's shoulder, right above the bullet wound and squeezed. John couldn't help hissing at the nip of pain that ran down his left arm.
“Of course not. I wouldn’t do it otherwise. I’ll start by cutting your ponytail off, and then I’ll trim up the rest to make it look neat. Not too short, perhaps a little longer than what your Pa has now. Ready?”
Mycroft’s hands pause in pulling the sheet over him. “And you won’t. But you should know that if you ever change your mind, they’ll be there for you and in spite of their many flaws, they do love you.”
He’s never cried so hard in his life. He breathes heavily into his hand, far too fast, the agony too strong for him to contain. He doesn’t know how long it lasts, but he suddenly feels as though he’s being watched. Hastily wiping his face on his T-shirt, he glances over his shoulder at Wardrobe. Jack wears an uncertain expression and he can’t look his Pa in the eye. He shuffles around Table and rests his head on Sherlock’s knee. The man’s breathing is still stuttering and he struggles to get it under control. He tangles his fingers in Jack’s hair and almost misses his son’s whispered words.
"Anderson only found the camera in the vault... the room today, but Sherlock said the boy was taken away, so all I can tell you is that he also died from suffocation."
While Sherlock knows that his son’s attention span is impressive for his age, he also knows that he can’t push his luck too far. After two hours of simple equations, learning to spell letters and reading, Sherlock calls it a day. They put everything away in the box and push it under Bed, mindful not to squash Eggsnake. Then an idea crosses Sherlock’s mind and he pulls the box back out and scribbles ‘Jack’s school box’ on the side. Jack stares at the way his name is spelt and files it away in his Mind Palace. He takes a piece of paper out and puts it in Wardrobe for later.
Sherlock wants to scream at him, but there’s no sound. He chokes on his pillow and pants for breath. His eyes water and he bites his tongue in desperation to keep quiet. “For Jack,” he tells himself. “JackJackJackJackJackJackJack…” Sherlock tries not to analyse anything and keeps still. He doesn’t react when his arms and neck are released. He closes his eyes and ignores the tears that drip into his pillow. He can hear Him putting his clothes back on, but he doesn’t move. He doesn’t want to attract their attention.
Sherlock opens his mouth to speak, but stops to glance down at Jack who is hiding behind his legs. Glancing at his parents, he immediately notices a change in their behavior. His mother’s face is rigid and she stares at Jack with a certain intensity that frightens him. Sherlock smiles uncertainly and gestures the benches. “Could we sit down? My leg is rather sore,” he whispers.
“Never mind. Tell the police about Room, okay? And Chain, you must mention Chain and Old Magnussen. But the most important thing is Appledore, do you understand? Because the police can’t find me unless you tell them where to find Room. So you must tell them that Room is in Appledore. It’s absolutely imperative, Jack.”
Anyway, thank you all (if there are Indeed any of you left), for your patience and understanding (if you have any left) because so many of you told me to put the story on hold so I embraced me schoolwork, wrote 50 pages about innovations in British Libraries and whether or not they would work in France, got a 16/20, am now nominated for an award for best thésis. And then I fell into a coma consisting of ice-cream and johnlock fanfics, drooling at my screen.
“Truck. Wriggle out. Jump. Deduce. Somebody. You need to remember those five things, Jack. They will help you escape. The Witch mentioned the other night that Their gardener was leaving his pick-up here and They have the keys. They won’t bury you on the Appledore grounds, because Their gardener will be suspicious. They can’t put you in the back of Their car, because again, suspicions. So that leaves the pick-up which They will use to drive somewhere far away enough to avoid curious people. We’re on the outskirts of London, which means They will pass housing estates and neighbours. So once you’re in the truck, you will do the second thing: Wriggle out of Rug. Then you will jump when the truck slows down and get away quickly. As you go, you’re going to have to deduce the people you see make sure they are clever and safe enough to save you. You’ve had a lot of practice with the people on TV so don’t you worry. And that’s when you do the final thing: Somebody. Pick a real person and stay with them. Tell them you need the police. You have to tell them everything, okay?
“Yes it is, Jack, I promise you, everything is real. Where do you think Old Magnussen and the Witch go when They leave Room? They go back into their house. Room is a part of Their house, it’s a part of Appledore.”
John peers around the wall to look at uncle Mycroft. He’s not very good at spying. He creeps back over to the sink and pours himself a glass of water. “What did you say to him?”
Mycroft takes a deep breath, clearly trying to win some inner battle. “We are Holmes’. But to use that as an excuse to hurt ourselves and others, because our parents clearly failed at parenting, is not the way to go forward.”
Said child is small enough to stand at full height under the table and is now on tiptoe trying to peek over the top of it. John smiles. "Hello there! I found a yummy breakfast to eat! Would you like to share it with me?"
The man turns alarmed. "Lower your weapons! Doctor Watson is having a flashback, kindly do not make this situation worse!"
A grey haired man is on his stomach, head bent forward and grunting as Mycroft pounds into him him mindlessly from behind.
For half an hour, Sherlock doesn’t move. The reality of his situation doesn’t set in until he hears Jack stir in Wardrobe. Panic grips him and he stumbles over to Bath, only too aware of the pain flaring up his backside. It takes colossal effort, but he eventually sinks into the tub, wincing as the hot water burns his injuries. He scrubs himself clean vigorously. He doesn’t cry. Jack will know if he’s cried. Once he’s rid the air of the foul smell and rearranged Bed, he picks up Jack and tucks him in without waking him. He lays there for hours, staring up at the Strip Light they can never switch off.
"I'll... I'll see you soon... Stamford will take care of you. Stay for me, Sherlock. Sherlock? I love you. I should have said it before... Sherlock? I love you."
“Phew! That boy on the skateboard was fast. Have to watch out for them. And now we’re in school. Ready to learn?”
They rip the cello tape off and pull apart the paper. Jack forgets about hiding and peers inside. He holds up a round fluffy toy.
"A boy." Lestrade nods encouragingly and John holds him tighter. "I called him William; that's my first name. It seemed fitting. When he was born, I had to help deliver the baby. She wouldn't go to hospital for fear of suspicion. She blamed them for the death of her first child, but I think her daughter was stillborn."
I’ve never cut my hair. Because it was perfect for Room. I didn’t know I could cut it. Only TV people had short hair. But now TV people are real and I’m not in Room anymore. Room and World are two different places. Even though I miss Room and Rug and Wardrobe, I’m in the World now. I would like to go back, but Pa needs me here. Pa has always been okay if I’m okay. Maybe his sickness is staying for a long time because he is worried about me and can’t see me, just like I am scared for him.
Mike ignores Sherlock’s tone. “You will be, Jack, you will be.” He stands up. “Your parents are here, Mr. Holmes, but they want to talk to me before they see you. Perhaps you would like to see them outside, or would you rather be in here?”
His eyes land on the photo in Lestrade's outstretched hand. A small patch of grass with flowers on top.
Had he been standing, Sherlock would have landed in a heap on the floor. Gripping the armrests, he turns to check on Jack, the only real thing in this world. His boy is asleep, smiling. He stares, hoping that Lestrade and his questions will disappear. He can't talk about it.
Hearing it makes it seem less real. “Are you sure? You… you’re certain? They… they weren’t ever going to just vanish… you can’t be sure…”
"He had a lot like that... Wore them to prove that he was smarter than me because he could force me to wear nothing, so he was better than me." He bites his lip. "Please don't be mad."
Something goes SMASH! in the kitchen. I jump right off the ground and hug uncle Mycroft’s leg. John yells three words which make uncle Mycroft hiss and shout “there’s a child here!”
Running his hands down Sherlock’s neck, then his chest, enjoying the silken texture of Sherlock’s favourite purple shirt. Leaning in and smelling his cucumber shampoo, ash, sweat and something so uniquely Sherlock that he’s addicted instantly. He swipes out his tongue and licks a path along Sherlock’s neck before sucking on his Adam’s apple. Sherlock’s breath is hot on his forehead and John loves that he can so easily pull apart the smartest man in London. That he’s the only one who can do this. Sherlock grasps his elbows to steady himself.
Mike rode out as soon as dinner was cleared up, promising to return by dusk. Sherlock had insisted that Mike take a piece of gold to Molly and Greg as payment for the clothes. John went outside to see him off. When Mike had gone, John came back inside, barred the door, and sat at the table next to Sherlock. He took Sherlock's hand and said, "Don't worry about Mike. He's tougher than he looks, and he won't give anything away."
John sighed. "Fine. I have to be careful because I could lose my job, okay? And because my family would disown me." John broke eye contact, staring into a crate. "I've said it. Are you happy?"
Sherlock looked at John. He knew John could see the concern in his eyes. "I've known Molly and Gregory my whole life, Sherlock. We can trust them." John nodded encouragingly.
Sherlock studied him for another long moment before schooling his features and reaching for John’s underpants. He expertly tore one side open at the hip, eliciting a shocked cry from John. He paused again, seeming to savour John’s reaction. A faint smile played at the corners of his decadent mouth. He then tore the other side and threw the underpants somewhere behind him.
The bathroom door was opening slowly. Cold fear clutched at John's chest. A tall, pale, dark-haired figure walked in silently.
John pulled back just enough to swallow around him. When Sherlock went limp, his hands sliding out of John's hair, John released him and crawled forward. Sherlock wound his arms around him and pulled him close as he tried to catch his breath. "Oh,
Brush creek overflowed its banks quickly and viciously. People all over the Plaza were caught in it. Cars were swept up. Windows were shattered under the weight of the water. Basements and underground parking garages filled rapidly. Shops, restaurants, and homes were inundated.
Sherlock attacked John's shirt buttons, pulling the shirt out of John's trousers to get it completely open. "Oh..." he breathed as he revealed John's upper body. He put his elegant hands on John's chest, stroking over every inch of the bare skin he'd uncovered. "Oh, John, you are even more lovely than I'd imagined." He grasped John's dog tags delicately, lifting them off his chest.
John tamped his anger down and put a big goofy grin on. "You really think he came this way? That would make quite a story to tell next time I visit the village!"
"Stay under the warm water for a minute; it'll help your muscles loosen up. I'll be right back," he said.
It was midday when John and Mike returned from exercising and caring for the horses. Sherlock propped himself up on Mike's bed.
John smiled. He slid under the coverlet and cloak and laid against Sherlock's right side, draping his arm over Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock sat up, letting John's dog tags drop back against his chest. "That people will know what, John? That I had sex?"
After locking the apartment door behind them, Sherlock grabbed John's arm and pulled him into his bedroom. John staggered to a halt. Sherlock's bedroom had floor-to-ceiling windows identical to the ones in his living room and a massive king size bed. Sherlock tugged on John's arm again until they were next to the bed. John grinned when he spotted a framed scientific diagram of a bee on the wall.
“We are only seen if we wish to be,” Sherlock said. He leaned closer to Greg. “I know you’re stuck on the Downing case. Tell me, does the brother have a green ladder?”
Sherlock continued his washing. He stripped off his underclothes and finished up. He opened his pack and dressed in clean underclothes and his nightshirt. He laid back into bed. He looked at John and grinned. "Your turn."
“I have some mild ability in healing.” He reached toward John’s shoulder. “I can’t repair the bullet wound,” he hastened to add when he saw John’s eyes widen, “And this won’t change that rather fascinating scar.”
John sat up a little so he could see Sherlock's face. Sherlock's eyes were closed. He looked like he was in pain. John put his hand to Sherlock's cheek. "Sherlock?"
Before Sherlock could respond, he was out the door. When he came back in he was holding something under his arm. Sherlock realized with a sudden shock that that John had made crutches for him. They looked simple, but strong. John had clearly spent a significant amount of time rounding and smoothing out the underarm supports to make them more comfortable. Sherlock was overwhelmed.
John grinned back. He walked toward the main entrance of Sherlock's building with him. Sherlock stopped and turned to face John. He put his shopping bag down on the sidewalk. The large fountain in front of the building kept them out of view of the cars passing by.
The surge of patients had begun to abate. John was finishing his notes on Mrs. Henderson's chart when he heard it.
Sherlock's hands moved to John's lower back. He clutched at John, pulling him down tightly against himself. He started pulling John's shirt up, sliding his hands beneath it. John moaned at the feel of Sherlock's hands on his bare skin.
Sherlock haltingly began to tell John about his life before they met. He told John about raising and training Apollo and about learning to play his vielle. John was captivated. His heart ached with love for the incredible, beautiful young man lying in front of him.
The man crouched down and looked into John's eyes. John just looked back for a moment, trying to decide what color the man's eyes were. They seemed to be green, blue, and gray all at the same time.
"Ha!" Holmes cried triumphantly, yanking a single sheet of paper out of the stack and holding it up. He disappeared into his and Watson's office, silk robe trailing behind him.
When Sherlock relaxed, John sat up and fumbled at his own breeches, his neglected cock aching with need. He freed it, grasping it and moaning quietly in relief. He tipped his head back and closed his eyes. After just a moment, John realized that Sherlock was pulling at his arm and saying, "John, John, let me."
Sherlock came back to that single note a final time, and the rest of the orchestra began to play again. All of the violinists were playing with Sherlock now, and the cellists were playing something that reminded John of a ship on the ocean.
After kissing Sherlock's mouth thoroughly, John dipped down to Sherlock's neck, nuzzling into it. He kissed and licked at it. Sherlock gasped out, "John!" and pulled him closer. John moved his hands into Sherlock's hair and reclaimed his mouth.
John cleaned up in the bathroom and went back to Sherlock with a washcloth. "Scoot over," he said as he moved Sherlock to a cleaner part of the bed and handed him the washcloth. When Sherlock was done, John took the cloth back to the bathroom and returned to bed.
John was determined not to make this too easy for the incubus. “Pleasure I’ve never known, hmm? Might be a problem. I’m a bit of a screamer, you see. The neighbors will think you’re murdering me and we’ll wind up having the police break down the door just when it’s getting good.”
John was grateful for the support. His knees hadn't forgiven him for kneeling on the sidewalk, and he wasn't quite steady enough to be confident walking alone yet. Sherlock led John to the passenger side of his black-cherry red Challenger and opened the door for him.
John squeezed both of his arms between their bodies and pulled clumsily at Sherlock's shirt buttons. He dragged his mouth back down Sherlock's neck and onto his chest, licking at the pale skin he was revealing as he worked Sherlock's shirt open.
John grinned at him. "Something quite extraordinary happened, actually. I wish you'd been there to see it."
There's finally a pause and Lestrade takes a moment to compose himself. Sherlock glances at John for help, but he looks just as lost as hed does. "What can you tell me about the pregnancy?
As They carry Jack away, the Soft Ball rolls out and hits the floor, disappearing under the bed. Sherlock remembers how the ball changed his relationship with his son. How William’s memory became special. Now the very ball he’d tried to confiscate had saved his son’s life.
Sherlock smiles patiently. “Yes, but my name is Sherlock, just like your name is Jack. That’s what my parents named me when I was born. My parents are your grandparents.”
“Jack’s unwell. He’s been sick three times and I don’t know what to do,” he replies, with genuine fear in his voice.
Sherlock turns to stare at him. His brother is sat on his bed, hunched over and looking as though he were trying to bear the weight of the world on his shoulders. In many ways he was. But in all his life, Mycroft had never shown himself, his feelings,
Ten minutes later the hole is filled. Mycroft feels frustration. He wishes he'd put a camera down there just so he could see the looks on their very dead faces. Would it be very wrong of him to dig them up, just so he could beat up the corpses with a whip?
Jack runs across the room and throws himself onto John, covering him with his smaller body. “NO! Please! PLEASE DON’T HURT HIM! PLEASE! HE’S THE SOMEBODY, HE’S SPECIAL, I WON’T LET YOU! I WON’T!”
The first thing he is aware of is the cold. His teeth chatter and all he wants to do is crawl into a hole and die. Peeling open his eyelids, he glances once around Room and notices a blurry shape sat on one of the chairs. He squints and groans, his body shaking in an attempt to fight off the pain. He curls in on himself, grits his teeth and tries not to think about why he’s naked. They’d been violent before, but this time They’d taken it to new extremes. He reaches out slowly, aware of how every movement makes sparks of pain shoot up his arm and he pulls his T-shirt towards himself. Biting his tongue to hold back a scream, he sits up in one brief, jerky spasm and breathes heavily through his nose as he pulls his T-shirt over his head. Keeping his jaw locked, he tugs his underwear up the length of Chain and struggles to get them up over his hips. Once he’s caught his breath he turns back to the figure sat in the chair with their back to him. She’s alone. Sherlock gathers a length of Chain in his hands and tries to slide off Bed as quietly as he can, but can’t hold back the sharp intake of breath as more of his injuries reveal themselves. She cocks her head to one side and doesn’t face him as She speaks.
“Jack! Wow, you look so different!” John picks up the small boy and hugs him tight. “Oh you look amazing! I’m so proud! Did Mrs. Hudson cut it for you?”
John's face softens. John's face is the softest, kindest thing he has seen in years. He can't stop watching in case he misses something.
A warm Not Their hand touches his face. He's starting to allow John to touch him. Mycroft has kept his distance and Sherlock is relieved. His older brother's soft tone, easily sharpened by anger reminds him too strongly of Old Magnussen. The three piece suits aren't the greatest of reminders either. Luckily Mycroft isn't around too much and when he is... well, they never hugged much as kids anyway.
Entering the flat, John makes a show of closing the door and pretends to not unsubltly look around for a small five year old. Hopefully the mention of something special to eat will stop him from hiding for too long.
Mycroft opens his mouth, but his mother cuts him off. "I'm a good cook. I'm an excellent mathematician. But I am a terrible mother. When you called to tell me Sherlock had been found, I thought everything could go back to normal. But when you said there was a child... and signs of sexual abuse, I panicked. I should have been there to hold my child when he cried and welcome my grandson, but instead, your father and I convinced ourselves that Sherlock would be the same; the same arrogant teenager, always doing his own thing. When he was missing we never imagined a scenario like this, so we kept up the pretence. We thought he'd never want to keep a child, because
Clara twitched. Her eyes darted to John for a split second before she resumed staring at Harry. "Hmm?"
John slammed his car door and headed toward his building. He stopped short as his left foot sank into the saturated ground. "Damn it!" John pulled his foot out of the muddy hole he'd created. "Oh, that's just
Sherlock bent forward and licked a broad stripe up John's cock, base to tip. John gasped, clutching at the wall again. With no hesitation, Sherlock took the head of John's cock into his mouth, stroking it with his tongue. John cried out before he could stop himself. He clapped a hand over his mouth as Sherlock began moving up and down steadily, still working John with his tongue. John was sobbing with pleasure, his hand still clamped tightly over his mouth.
"You're a cruel man, John Watson." Sherlock was glaring at him now, but he hadn't let go of the balusters.
John couldn't breathe. He struggled to pull his wallet out of his pocket with shaking hands and threw some cash onto the table for the drinks they'd ordered.
John set the plates of food and cups of tea on the dresser and crawled onto the bed, nudging Sherlock. Sherlock groaned deeply, but didn't open his eyes. John nudged him again. "Sherlock." Another nudge. "Wake up, gorgeous. I made breakfast."
John grinned back and started pulling his shoes and socks off. Sherlock did the same. They giggled quietly together as they grabbed each other for balance. John unbuttoned his shirt cuffs. Sherlock followed John's lead again, unbuttoning his own. He took his watch off and put it on John's nightstand. John put his watch and his dog tags next to Sherlock's watch. He quickly shrugged his suit jacket and shirt off his shoulders and threw them aside. He grabbed the back of Sherlock's neck and pulled him down into a kiss.
John divided the rest of the rye loaf, putting half on a plate on the small table next to the bed. He brought Sherlock a mug of ale as well. He drank down his own ale and ate his bread quickly. Sherlock watched him silently.
John stroked him once. Sherlock thrashed against him and cried out wordlessly. John stroked him again. Sherlock cried out again. He let go of John's hair and grabbed at his arm. "John! John, wait!" he said against John's shoulder.
"Some of those thirty-eight years were... well, they were unimaginable. I wouldn't have survived them without your constant strength and love."
Sherlock glared at him before continuing. "I outran him. And I outran his men. I circled back while they were searching the woods so I could retrieve my vielle and my pack. I may have 'liberated' some of the Lord's gold while I was at it."
When John was sure Sherlock was relaxed, he rolled him onto his back and crawled over him. Sherlock looked up at him with heat and adoration in his eyes. His hands had fallen back onto the pillow on either side of his head.
. Sherlock had scratches all over his body, but John was relieved to see no significant injuries other than the cut on his temple. He dressed Sherlock in both gowns, putting the second one on back-to-front. He then settled him on the bed and tucked the blanket around him. He rubbed at Sherlock's arms and legs to help him warm up. Blood was still trickling from Sherlock's temple. "Don't move, okay? I'll be right back." Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock growled again and grabbed the balusters roughly. John swung his leg over to straddle Sherlock's upper thighs. He put his right hand on the mattress next to Sherlock's ribs and leaned forward. He raised his left hand to his mouth and licked at it.
John walked down the hill silently, his bow ready but lowered. He approached the hollow where the stranger was hidden from behind its sheltering tree. He readied himself to circle around and get a look at the intruder.
John's hands tightened on Sherlock's knees. Then John pushed his hands up Sherlock's thighs. He put one hand over Sherlock's.
Sherlock had apparently found what he was looking for. He dropped the box, scattering John’s sex toys across the floor. John meant to complain, but when Sherlock turned back toward John with coils of rope in his hands and a predatory look in his eyes, John’s ability to speak abandoned him.
"No!" Sherlock interrupted. "No, don't go back. Of course you didn't know; I never told you what Apollo looks like." Sherlock stepped forward. John moved out of the way so Sherlock could approach Beau.
John continued kissing Sherlock's stomach. As he moved lower, Sherlock's body tensed in anticipation. Sherlock moaned desperately. "John,
John moaned against Sherlock's neck. "Oh, my darling." Sherlock pulled John tightly against him. John overbalanced, sliding off his chair and stumbling onto his feet. Sherlock took advantage. He pushed his chair back from the table with his good leg and dragged John directly in front of him. Then he pulled him down into a scorching kiss.
"I wish that were true. But, John, I tried to tell you yesterday. I'm... not nice. I'm rude, condescending, arrogant, dismissive. People don't like me. You deserve better. You deserve someone like you. And you deserve to know the truth about me before you leave your home."
Sherlock's eyes widened in shocked pleasure when he heard the endearment. John stood up and kissed Sherlock again, brushing his hair back gently. "I want you to keep resting. I need to check on some other patients."
He lay still for several minutes before propping himself up on his elbow and looking at his left leg. He needed to take his boot off to gauge the severity of the damage. Sherlock pushed himself up to a sitting position. The pain surged with his movements and he cursed into his hand again for several minutes. He was going to need both hands for this. He took one of his thick leather gloves off and put it between his teeth.
John sighed. "I would love to, Sherlock, I really would. I wanted you there with me today. So badly. But you know I can't tell her about... this. Us. You have to understand."
Holmes was born in southeast England. He studied composition and violin performance in London at the prestigious Royal Academy of Music, and relocated to Kansas City in 1972 when he was offered the concertmaster position with the Kansas City Philharmonic. He has been a prominent presence in Kansas City's classical music community for over forty years.
The bartender, the other waitress, several patrons, and Sherlock were standing in front of the bar, watching. John approached the bartender and waitress. "She's going to be fine," he told them. "A couple of stitches and she'll be good as new." The ambulance drove away.
Sherlock began to respond. He put one hand on the back of John's head, stroking his fingers through John's hair. His other hand fell lightly against John's waist. He deepened the kiss, opening his mouth to allow John's tongue in. He tasted like scotch and heat and

,” he said, “That during this conversation, your gaze has found my mouth approximately every four seconds before you divert it back to my eyes.” He favoured John with a crooked smile.
Sherlock reached behind himself and undid a button at the back of his trousers. John thought dimly that it must allow for his tail. At any rate, Sherlock was able to push his trousers down his hips, exposing his bollocks as well. He wrapped his hand around his cock and stroked it a few times, sighing in pleasure. John moaned desperately, his own neglected cock throbbing.
"Sherlock, it has been my great privilege to spend nearly thirty-eight years by your side. You have made me happier than I ever thought I could be. Every good thing in my life was better because I could share it with you. And every loss I experienced was more bearable because I was able to lean on you."
John nuzzled into Sherlock's neck, sighing as Sherlock tipped his head to the side to expose more of his pale skin to John's attention. Sherlock tugged at John's grip on his wrists, testing the strength of the hold without attempting to break it.
John's right arm slid around Sherlock's waist and pinned him tightly to John's right side. John felt solid and warm. Strong. Sherlock felt a surge of heat rush through his body. "Put your arm around my shoulders." Sherlock did, his hand landing on John's left shoulder. He leaned on John. John winced and inhaled sharply. Sherlock yanked his arm back quickly. He stared at John with wide eyes.
"You know, I didn't think it would," Watson said when asked if it felt different being married after decades of partnership. “But I was wrong. Being able to tell the world in such a simple yet profound way that I belong to him and he belongs to me has meant more to me than I can possibly express."
Sherlock gripped John's forearms as John managed, with some difficulty, to get back onto his feet. Sherlock stood, still holding on to John. He locked their arms together and bent to retrieve his notebook and John's cane.
John knew Sherlock could feel the tension in his body as he tried to control the rage coursing through him.
"The men around me managed it. They got married while they were in school. Before they shipped out. Hell, some of them got married while they were on leave. If I'd really wanted a wife, I'd have one. But somehow I never found the right person." He squeezed Sherlock's hand and looked into his eyes. "Now I know why."
Sherlock wrapped a rope around John’s other wrist. “I should think it’s fairly obvious. These are your own ropes, after all.”
"It's all right." John reluctantly pulled out of the hug and wiped the tears off his face. "Let's find a spot to wait for morning."
"And then it took some time to get my head together after... everything that happened with my family."
He brought his hands to Sherlock's waist, sliding them inside Sherlock's open shirt and around to his lower back. He held Sherlock close as they kissed. At length, John broke away from Sherlock's mouth to lavish attention on his neck again. He spoke against Sherlock's neck without thinking, the words flowing unbidden from his mouth. "Sherlock. Love you. So much. God, I love you. So beautiful. Gorgeous. Brilliant. Amazing. How can I be so lucky? How? I must be dreaming. Oh, God, I love you. You remarkable, incredible man!
He peered into the hollow. The dim light shone on the blade of a hunting knife. John was expecting the knife, but his breath caught as he was transfixed by the most startlingly beautiful pair of eyes he had ever seen, blazing from beneath the hood of the stranger's cloak.
As they sat on one of the hills, John stroked his hand through Sherlock's hair. "I'm so sorry you have to do this. I know a place where we can stop. There's a hidden glen a little over halfway to Mike's farm. We'll be safe there until tomorrow night."
Sherlock's eyes fluttered closed. He shook his head and reopened them. "I want to touch you first. Could I touch you, John?"
John spoke quietly. "I've never met anyone as fascinating as you are, Sherlock. You're brilliant, funny, kind, and absolutely gorgeous. I think about you constantly."
His heart jumped into his throat. The Philharmonic was on the stage. John stumbled into a seat in the back row. The orchestra wasn't playing at the moment. The conductor was giving instructions to some of the players. John's eyes searched through the violinists.
Sherlock ducked his head. "It's all right, John. I... I don't mind." He finally looked into John's eyes again. His cheeks had gone fully pink. "I
As John led Sherlock slowly to the back of the house, he worried a little about how his home must look to a prince's eyes. He had worked hard on his home and would have been proud to show it to almost anyone, but he thought it must look primitive to someone used to a castle.
." John wrapped his arms around him. "Don't get trapped in some preconceived notion about what I want or expect from you. All I want is you."
"Some photos. Some things I had from my time in the army. My old uniform." John was going numb. "Everything's in my footlocker. I left it in the entryway."
John put the heels of his hands over his eyes. After a few moments, he forced himself to get up so he could get into bed properly. He put on an old t-shirt and turned out the light.
Sherlock wobbled a bit. "I intend to." He smiled sheepishly. "Thank you, Mike. I'll always remember your kindness and generosity."
Soon Sherlock's whole body was tensing up as he neared his peak. John focused on his breathing as his own arousal threatened to overtake him before he could complete his plan. When John felt Sherlock get harder against his tongue, he pulled off.
The heat was oppressive. John could feel sweat trickling down his back and catching in the waistband of his fatigues. He was there to deliver a message to Sholto, but he'd be damned if he could remember what it was when Sholto's eyes burned into his.
I can’t believe I actually have to say this, but I swear by all that is holy (or unholy as the case may be) that this work was absolutely NOT inspired by any current news events. I have been working on it for many months, and the original publication date of the first two chapters predates any bizarre stories currently circulating. Thank you! ❤️
Sherlock stroked John's hair. After a few more minutes, John sat up. Sherlock wiped his hand off and they both put their clothes right. Dusk was approaching, and the air grew cooler.
. He smiled to himself, remembering how they wound up there. He walked over and stopped short. Sherlock's watch was still next to his.
He shrugged, his wings flexing. “I’m not so very different from you, but,” he said, watching his fingers toy idly with the sheet, “I feed off human energy.”
John was shuddering with anticipation and desire. At long last, Sherlock plunged one hand into his trousers. He moaned extravagantly, tipping his head black to expose his delicate throat. He then lowered his head and looked deeply into John’s eyes before dropping his gaze to his own groin, prompting John to also look where Sherlock’s hand disappeared into his trousers.
John reached out and picked up Sherlock's watch. It was heavy. The leather band was soft and thick. If felt expensive. John looked at it for a moment. He turned it over. There was engraving on the back. "WSSH."
"Thank you." John walked toward her. "You must be Mrs. Hudson. I'm John Watson. It's nice to meet you." He held out his hand.
John didn't break eye contact. He lifted his trembling hand to his own mouth. He licked it and reached down blindly for Sherlock's cock. As he wrapped his hand around it, Sherlock cried out. "John!
, I need to know you’re okay… I had… I had to resta- I had to restart… restart your heart. I had to perform CPR and you were
Three heads whip around to face the source of this question. Wardrobe’s door is open and Jack is standing outside, facing the three of them. He rubs the sleep out of his eyes and stares at the three adults curiously, uncomprehendingly. “Pa?”
For five days after the interview, Mycroft takes more hours off work and watches his brother like a hawk. He doesn't like what he sees.
“Why am I finding it so difficult to say no to you?” Genuine confusion clouded his lovely green eyes. He gave a little shake of his head as if to clear it. “Fine. It’s Sherlock. Are you happy now?”
Sherlock opened his eyes. They widened as John reached into his jacket pocket. John pulled out a small gray box and opened it to reveal a heavy platinum wedding band.
Sherlock leaned across the table. "If this is a woman who would disown her only son, why do you care so much?"
Sherlock moaned around John, causing John to cry out and tighten his hand in Sherlock's hair. Sherlock moaned again when John started guiding his head up and down. He let John control his movements, giving himself over. He slid one hand around to grip John's arse.
"Which one is it?" Sherlock asked. When John finished describing his building, Sherlock turned toward him. "Liar."
Sherlock looked down at his notebook, fidgeting with it for a moment. "Well, there's a colony here." He pointed up into the trellis.
John stroked Sherlock and leaned forward to speak quietly against Sherlock's neck. "That's it, Sherlock. Come on!"
A predatory smile spread across the demon’s sharp-featured face. “They won’t. No sound will escape this room while I occupy it.”
John didn't respond. He took advantage of having his right arm free, lifting it and putting it behind him into Sherlock's hair. He wove his fingers into it and twisted a little, and was rewarded with a gasp from Sherlock.
John shook his head, but Sherlock pulled harder and John let him pull his hand down. "N-neighbors," John said brokenly. "Could hear."
The bartender thanked John and shook his hand. He told him that his and Sherlock's drinks were on the house tonight and went back inside with the waitress. The other patrons followed, and soon John and Sherlock were alone on the sidewalk.
When John had finished eating and washing up, he grinned at Sherlock. "I've got something for you outside. I'll just go get it."
John stopped on their way out of the barn to pick up a bucket full of milk. "Told Mike I'd milk the cow since I was coming out. After we eat I'll help him with the horses."
He slipped out of bed, lit the candle, and retrieved their food supply and their water. He sat down on the edge of the bed and stroked Sherlock's forehead, smoothing his hair back. Sherlock opened his eyes. John stroked his hair again. "Good morning, dear heart."
Sherlock watched John stoke the fire and prepare a rye loaf. John put the loaf by the fire to bake. He began preparing flat bread as well. Sherlock's eyelids grew heavy. He soon dropped off to sleep.
You were supposed to keep your head down and avoid anyone noticing you! Your little tantrum could have cost us
John spoke tentatively. "It will be dark soon, Sweetheart. Do you want to walk the rest of the way tonight, or do you want to rest here another day?"
“Yes, I have a tail,” the incubus said, rolling his eyes again. “We did already establish that I’m a demon.” He whipped it forward for a moment. It was long, black, and pointed.
He stomped back into his apartment and called Sarah to tell her it would take him longer to arrive now that he had to walk. He hung up and stared at the phone for a moment. He picked it back up and dialed Sherlock's number. Busy signal. John slammed the receiver onto the hook and walked out.
Sherlock went to his knees in front of him and pushed John's legs apart. He pulled John forward until his hips were at the edge of the couch, quickly yanked his jeans open, and swallowed him down.
And just as John feared he would lose consciousness from overarousal, Sherlock snapped upright, completely composed.
Sherlock was in agony. He watched John walking away at a brisk pace, knowing he had no hope of catching up to him on crutches.
Sherlock smirked. "You could say that. I'll admit that I am tired. But don't let me keep you from your work."
John yanked against the ropes as another wash of primordial fear rushed through him and pulsed into his cock. He couldn’t move his legs.
John paused when he caught sight of him. Sherlock was sitting on his usual bench, facing away from John, scribbling in his notebook. He was wearing his peacock green shirt, which was John's favorite because of the way it played up Sherlock's lovely eyes.
"One of the other doctors caught me daydreaming about you this afternoon. She said I looked like I was in love."
Sherlock removed the smile from his face as he turned around. John's face was stern. Sherlock suppressed another grin and moved backward to lean against the closest of the pillars holding the storage shelves up.
"I thought I'd lost you!" Sherlock's voice was choked. "The last time I'd seen you I'd slammed a door at you. The last thing I'd said to you was, 'Go away!'"
He kissed Sherlock for several minutes, until they were both breathless. John pulled back, putting one hand up to Sherlock's face and stroking his thumb across Sherlock's cheek. They looked into each other's eyes. John reclaimed Sherlock's mouth and pressed his chest against Sherlock's. He could
John pushed himself up carefully and stood. He hiked his breeches back up, but left them untied. Sherlock was mildly concerned. "Where are you going, John?"
Sherlock pulled back and sat up on his heels between John’s legs, knees spread. John lurched forward against his restraints in an instinctive attempt to follow. The loss of contact was unbearable.
John took a moment to look at Sherlock, trembling beneath him in the firelight. "So beautiful," he whispered. He put his hands on Sherlock's waist. He dragged his left hand down the hollow of Sherlock's hip and grasped his erection. Sherlock cried out, arching his back. John stroked him once, pushing his thumb across the head. Sherlock shuddered and cried out again. "J-John!"
John didn't tease. He dropped his head and took Sherlock into his mouth right away. Sherlock choked back a cry, shuddering hard. John pushed his right hand past Sherlock's hip and grabbed his arse. He took Sherlock in as far as he could, stroking the underside of his cock with his tongue. Sherlock leaned back onto his right hand, his left hand stroking through John's hair.
John made a choked-off cry and shuddered. Sherlock pressed John's hips securely against the table to keep him steady. He pulled John's breeches down just far enough. He pulled John's shirt up out of the way and put his hand down the front of John's underclothes and around his cock.
Every time John closed his eyes, he saw Sherlock. He saw him sitting in the cafe across from John with his eyes bright. He saw him laughing. He saw him crouched in front of John on the sidewalk. And he saw Sherlock's face when John pulled away from him. He saw the pain in Sherlock's eyes. The confusion.
John wondered at how Sherlock could possibly find fault with Tanisha's playing. It had sounded flawless to him. She was easily John's favorite among the few students Sherlock had deemed worthy of his time and instruction, with sparkling deep brown eyes and a throaty, infectious laugh.
“No, but I am saving that for tomorrow. I gave him suggestions on how to stop a really bad guy he’s trying to catch, but I’m not sure he likes what I said.”
I wake up from my sleep and push my hair away from my face. I’m in John’s bed. I remember I came to find him in the night because I was lonely and scared. I’m not used to sleeping all by myself. John said I must learn, but I’m scared. I’m not used to the dark. Dark means Monsters are punishing us. Uncle Mycroft had bought me a night light, but I’m not used to being alone either. John is sleeping on the floor. He says he mustn’t share a bed with me because he’s not my Pa. He says he could get into trouble. But I just want cuddles. And more than anything, I want Pa. Pa was always there in Room.
He looks at no one as they’re bundled into the car. The soldier gets in with them. Without a word, he puts Sherlock’s foot on his lap and the paramedics pass him some bandages and then they’re gone. Sherlock is vaguely aware that he may be going into shock.
“He’s alive! Mr. Holmes, can you hear me? My name is Detective Lestrade, everything’s going to be okay.”
John, still stuck to the fridge he’d backed up against and remembering Mycroft’s threats, looks dismayed. “I’m your friend, Sherlock. This is not how friends thank each other. This is a bit not good.”
“I'm here.” Sherlock turns and buries his face in John's neck, catching a masculine scent that doesn't belong to the man who kept him prisoner. John has taken care of both him and Jack, has expressed kindness the way They would sometimes when She was pregnant and after that would come sex, sweeter and gentler and he would almost be tricked into wanting it… isn't that what people did when they lived together? His parents had sex, he'd had sex with the Monsters… but if it was consensual like most adults living together, then wasn't sex part of the deal? Maybe he should…
John recalls standing behind a hospital bed, watching a small boy sleep and Sherlock sat in front of a mirror with his back to him. His full nudity revealed horrific injuries and abuse and John had wanted him to know he's not alone. "Would you like to see?"
Uncle Mycroft stares down at me even harder. I know he’s in his Mind Palace. He doesn’t disagree with my idea. John knows this too, without even seeing him. “I CAN HEAR YOU THINKING MYCROFT HOLMES! DON’T YOU DARE!”
He's a terrible actor, but Jack is five and probably won't mind. "I know! I saw something yummy in the kitchen! I hope I get there before somebody else eats it!" Gluing his gaze to his feet, he heads back up the steps.
“That would not work. I have tried to contact him, but I cannot get through to him. I know how to talk to bad people like him, and trust me, telling him off will not work.”
"Do you know," says John, and he can feel the tears escape again, "do you know what it's like to wake up everynight with the knowledge you've screamed yourself hoarse in your sleep and that no one truly gives a crap beacause no one understands well enough to care. To be scared of war but you go into it everyday because if you walk away you may aswell eat a bullet." He cocks his gun and points it at his temple.
He almost misses the six beeps and then the door opens. They stop in Their tracks as They take in the scene in front of Them.
Jack pulls on his ponytail. “But we’re supposed to be in Room because Room is real. You’re not making sense, Pa.”
He holds out his hand, before curling it into a fist and leaving his pinky out. John doesn't give him time to feel stupid and locks his own pinky around Sherlock's. They look at each other and start giggling, breaking the weighted tension that had settled.
Anthea walks in and hands over the next days workload. Mycroft rolls his shoulders carefully and immediately concentrates on his duties.
Sherlock shakes his right arm loose and succeeds in elbowing her in the stomach. “Jack!” he screams, “Monsters! MONSTERS!”
“It’s all your fault,” mutters Sherlock, raising his red rimmed eyes. “IT’S ALL YOUR FAULT!” he screams. “You wouldn’t take him to a hospital and now he’s dead!”
His breathing slows and he bravely attempts to face reality by opening his eyes. John's face smiles back.
