“It’s bloody cold,” John complains. The concrete wall of the pipe feels like ice; he wishes he’d thought to take off his scarf and put it under his head.
This is not the kind of thing they do.  John isn’t gay, and Sherlock is… who knows.  Asexual would have been John’s best guess.  Might have to reevaluate that.  Later.
They’re both still while Sherlock no doubt follows John’s thought process down to the second.
Dammit, he’s doing it on purpose.  "Stop it.  Sherlock!”
A door clanks somewhere on the factory floor below. “They’re here. Text Lestrade,” Sherlock whispers, and shimmies past John out of the pipe.
John hits his mental pause button — not enough blood flow to his brain right now, anyway — and gives himself over to his senses:  the tantalizing friction against his cock, the smell of the body above him — citrus shampoo, coffee and wool, and the sound of Sherlock’s breathing, now unmistakably aroused.  And — god— arousing.  Sherlock doesn’t do this, he doesn’t give himself over to this kind of pleasure, and John can only marvel at the unexpectedness of what they're doing.
But now they’re back in the same place, in the same position.
I’m tired,” Sherlock whispers.  John giggles; he can’t help it.  Sherlock giggles too, his nose in John’s hair, his body now heavy and relaxed against John’s.
John wonders what Sherlock is thinking as he fucks John’s mouth with his fingers. Whatever it is, it’s not long before he whimpers and goes limp against John.
"Is this okay?" he whispers. Sherlock nods.
Sherlock smells the same.
Is this what it’s like at those posh public schools Sherlock went to?  Rites of passage, male bonding rituals?
Christ, it’s embarrassing. But then again, it’s only physics, isn’t it?  Just a biological response to friction applied in the right place.  Sherlock would be reacting the same way, if only he had a normal —
But somehow it just feels lightheartedly clandestine and really, really good.  Agile fingers snake past the waistband of his pants; Sherlock’s hand is warm and calloused and without thinking John is thrusting gently into Sherlock’s strokes.  Sherlock Holmes is giving him a hand job.  He’s going to come in Sherlock’s hand,
“Christ, Sherlock.  Hold still.”  John tries to angle his hips so the contact isn’t quite so … pelvic, but Sherlock has him pinned, and John’s squirming is only making it worse.
John doesn’t answer.  He backs Sherlock up until he's sitting on the table, and then he unzips Sherlock's trousers.
Sherlock swears again and pulses in his hand, and John doesn't take his eyes off him until Sherlock turns his head.
John gets a serviette and wipes his hand while Sherlock watches. He unlocks the door just before Dimmock knocks.
“It’s your fault we didn’t get them a month ago when it was warmer,” Sherlock whispers beside him.
“Okay, I’m in, but I don’t even know what food it is.”  He made a grab for Sherlock phone, who merely held it in the air, out of reach from the shorter man.
“Merry Christmas,” John slurs, drunk on cheap wine and tips his wine glass toward the other one sitting on the table.  Next to the skull.  Sherlock had never given the thing a name, said it was so stupidly oversentimental he couldn’t believe the idea had even crossed John’s mind.  John wondered what he thought of naming cats, or if calling the creature by its animal name was enough for the genius.  Well, the dead genius.  In absence of the lanky detective, John had taken to calling the skull “Sherlock,” even going so far as pretend the bone was that of Sherlock’s, though he knew it was impossible.
“No, but-“ he watched as Sherlock’s arm faltered, an unreadable motion flashing through the man’s eyes.  He let out a little sigh instead of the rest of his sentence and reached forward, grabbed Sherlock’s wrist with his clean hand and brought the food forward.  He never took his eyes off Sherlock’s as he took the food into his mouth.  He swore he saw a slight blush heat up the detective’s usual pale cheeks as his lips brushed against Sherlock’s long fingers.
“Because I wanted to see if you would surprise me.”
Sherlock scooted to the far side, placing the desserts on the seat between them, “Yes, I quite enjoyed it.  I wouldn’t mind returning to this place someday for lunch or another dinner.  Maybe when we’re in the neighborhood again?”
“Should we just go for the cheapest one or-“ John started to ask.
It was their first case together after Sherlock’s return and it had gone perfectly.  If you looked past the cuts and bruises they both sported, and instead to the laughs and smiled the shared with each other as they walked from the circus of police cars.  They were making off into the night like criminals themselves, Lestrade yelling after them that he would need a statement someday, at least.  That someday would be next week, by Sherlock’s calculations, when John was off work and finally dragged Sherlock down to the Yard.
“Good riddance,” came the smooth reply and John lost himself in a fit of giggles.  He worked his numb fingers at the edge of his shirt, trying to pull off this offending material, too, but found he was once again helpless and had to wait while Sherlock pulled it off for him.  His jeans got thrown to the corner of the room rather forcefully when he found he could at least get those off.  He slipped under the covers  – Sherlock’s covers, he had to keep reminding himself of that – and nestled up against the pillow.  Sherlock was still there when he opened his eyes and looked up, though his coat had been removed sometime during the past few minutes.  Now that he could just look at him, he noticed his hair was shorter, too.
So he stayed to himself.  He liked to think he was content that way, cut off from the rest of society, safe in his own little world.  Unfortunately, that world happened to contain Sherlock.  When he thought too much about the man, he had to move around, had to focus his mind on other things.  Of course, he didn’t much more to focus his mind on, his life had become so focused on the man that now that he was out of the picture, his world was all out of sync.  He dreamed either of the fall or the war, constantly plagued with nightmares worse than those which had followed him back from the war.  He would often wake with Sherlock’s name being ripped from his throat.  If it ever disturbed Mrs. Hudson during the night, she never mentioned it.
“Well that’s just great for you, Bachelor Watson.”
“Is it considered rude if I do?”
The graveyard.  Sherlock almost kicked himself for not thinking of it earlier.  But the hunched figure in front of the tombstone – his tombstone – was unmistakable.  He approached slowly from behind, but John already knew he was there, just didn’t move to acknowledge him.  There was a flower in front of his body and Sherlock, still maintaining his distance, had to crane his neck to see what it was.  What he hadn’t been expecting was a red rose.  His brain shuddered to a stop before it got itself back together and turned, melding all the facts together.  Red.  Red rose.  Red roses were usually reserved for- He shuffled closer, glad when John didn’t move, but he still hadn’t done anything to accept him there.
“Fine.”
It was uncertain who moved first, but they found each other in the middle, lips meeting in a chaste kiss.  They moved away, both equally shocked until John’s lips curved up in to his familiar smirk and he moved forward again, bringing his hands off of Sherlock’s to curve one around the back of Sherlock’s neck, while the other lay flat against his chest.  He pulled Sherlock down for another kiss, this one longer than the first, with John’s tongue flicking out to lightly trace over Sherlock’s lips.  He pulled away from the kiss shivering, his hands clenched into fists in front of him, not sure what to do with them.  John brought the fists up to kiss them, his lips leaving his hands feeling as though they were on fire, which quickly built up and flared through his entire body.  Sherlock was certain he was blushing like the virgin he was, if John’s smirk was anything to go by.
“I was thinking we could get one of these,” John looked up as Sherlock took his menu and opened it to the page he was referring to, showing the group choices, “They’re for two.”  He offered as way of explanation.
John wasn’t far in front of Lestrade with accepting Sherlock back business.  There were days where he saw the man out of the corner of his eye and nearly broke his neck trying to look over fast enough.  He had broken two cup already in shock, standing tired in the kitchen, waiting for the water to boil when Sherlock would come in, stretching and yawning.  During those times he often forgot to make two cups instead of just one.  He had remembered a few times after he had sat down with his own cup to take a sip before almost spitting the liquid out in realization and running back to pour another tea to set out in front of Sherlock.  Often it sat there all day, growing cold, and sometimes John would stare at it when Sherlock was out of the room, wondering if he was mad or if Sherlock was just being himself and not drinking or eating for days.  Maybe he was just setting out another cup for no one.
Then he feels the first prickling of his orgasm and rides it, stops wondering. Sherlock's mouth is hot and fast and willing, and it's the best blow job John's had in years. When Lipton walks out of the exit, John is seconds away, and when he gasps, “There he is,” he’s almost finished spurting in Sherlock’s mouth.
Sherlock’s hand has left the console and is reaching for John’s lap. He leans across the car and looks at John’s crotch with obvious intent.
He wonders if Sherlock is getting off on this. He wonders what would happen if he ran his fingers through the dark curls on his lap. He wonders how they got here and where they’re going.
And there’s that feeling again. They’re panting like they’ve just chased down a suspect, but this is more intimate. They’ve done this together, for each other.
They’re ridiculously close, wedged against each other.  The 10-foot section of concrete pipe is a perfect hiding place, overlooking the floor of the abandoned warehouse where Sherlock is certain a small-arms deal will happen tonight. They can’t quite see below unless one of them sticks his head out, but they’ll be able to hear if anyone gets close.
“May I?” he asks, and this is when John should say no, he’s not gay, they’re on a public street, they —
Sherlock’s breathing is unsteady and he’s hard against John’s hip, and John would reciprocate, but there’s no way he can rotate his shoulder enough to put his arm down; the space is far too tight.  “Touch yourself,” John whispers, astonished at his own audacity.  John hears Sherlock’s zip, feels Sherlock take himself in hand.  Sherlock’s fingers must be slippery with John’s come, he realizes, and it’s ridiculous what a turn-on that is.
It’s… nice.
Their breathing slows and the silence stretches out. It’s not uncomfortable.
They wait in a windowless conference room. Sherlock is jittery with fatigue and maybe something else. John looks at him and remembers Sherlock's head in his lap.
By the time John’s got his breath back, they’re halfway there.
“My fault?
Sherlock parts his lips almost reverently, exploring John’s cock with a mix of sumptuousness and precision that is so uniquely him that John's smiling over gritted teeth.
“Fuck,” Sherlock moans.  “Oh, fuck.”  John has never heard that word from those posh lips and it’s so damn hot. He wants to lean closer and kiss that pale neck, mark it —
Sherlock sits up, wipes his lips and turns the ignition.
“There’s a chance he doesn’t. And a chance he’ll lead us somewhere helpful. There are other threads we need to tie up.”
It’s kind of nice, thinks John, that he and Sherlock know exactly how the other is feeling right now, that boneless post-orgasmic lassitude that never seems to creep over women in quite the same way.  He so rarely knows what’s going on inside Sherlock’s head, never quite feels like they’re functioning on the same plane.  It’s … nice, this.
“Not tired.”
“Meanwhile our entire evening is tied up with this bloody stakeout which is likely pointless,” John grumbles. “I’m starving.”
“No,” Mycroft grinned, a slow upturning of lips like the smile of a shark. “I think you will work just fine.”
Dartmoor is beautiful in a bleak sort of way. John watches the landscape go by from the window of the jeep Sherlock rented, which is nothing more than a dressed up version of an up-armored humvee. The scenery is picturesque, rolling hills and far off mountains, with the occasional grazing sheep or cow. It is sunnier than London, less dreary, and John hates it with a ferocity that surprises him.
Sherlock grinned at him.
Mycroft steepled his hands beneath his chin and pondered.
“Bit not good, don’t you think?” John asks. His words had seemed rather harsh for a brother he claims to care for.
John glares at her, but eventually yields, gingerly removing his makeshift sling.
Christ, they’ve both just come in their pants.  In a concrete pipe somewhere in Southampton.
“Yes?”
“Shut up.”
“And what, pray tell, are you yelling about today?”  John sighed, folding the newspaper up and placing it on his knee.  His cup of tea was almost finished and he reached out to sip at it some more.  Sherlock’s, on the other hand, was barely touched and lukewarm now.
Everything seemed to run together after that, both he and Sherlock moving forward to cut the umbilical cord then watching the washing, the weighing.   And then John seemed to merely blink and they were sitting in another room, holding their son.  Their son.  John gently held the sleeping baby in his hands as though he was scared he would break him.  They were alone, Olivia left in her room to sleep and relax and John knew that they would lose contact with her, that she would be consumed by London once more, but he would respect that.  Gently, he ran a finger over the baby’s cheek, watching him twitch at the touch.  Next to him, Sherlock shifted, trying to get a better look at their son.  The baby opened up its eyes, staring up at the sleepy before yawning, little limbs trembling.
John just smirked as Sherlock huffed with indignation.
“’A sign of affection.’  Sherlock-“ John stopped and let out a sigh, “Is there something that you need to talk to me about?”
“John.”
“I don’t have a girlfriend, so I hardly see how that’s good for me.  I haven’t had a girlfriend for more than a few weeks since you… you know.”
The week went by faster than John expected and the next thing he knew, it was the day before New Year’s Eve.  He had wondered whether he should try to throw a party the next day or drag Sherlock off to someone else’s.  In the end, he decided neither would be the best.  Lestrade was still getting over the fact that Sherlock was alive, Molly was avoiding the both of them after admitting she knew the truth, Mrs. Hudson watched Sherlock as though he were a ghost, and Mycroft was being, well, himself.  John didn’t mind and he knew that Sherlock would be overjoyed.  He may have liked to show off around others, but he also loved the simplicity of being without them.
It was days before John woke up in the hospital and Sherlock had spent almost every minute of that time pacing in the room until Mycroft had made him sit down and rest, limbs tossed out over the uncomfortable chairs set up next to the wall.  That was how John first saw him, eyes slowly opening back up to look at the world, too bright to open his eyes at first, the room all white, until his gaze flickered over to the black blob in his peripheral vision.  And then he stared, not sure if what he was an illusion or truly there.  It wasn’t until he tried out his voice, sandy and cracked from no use and lack of water, to say the man’s name that he roused the sleeping form.
His therapist was stupid, hopeless.  Sherlock had been right about that.  He went to two appointments and then never returned.  Her messages he deleted from his cell phone, never even listening to the words she left him.  He knew they would be unintelligent.  Finally, she stopped trying to contact him.  She couldn’t help him, no one could.  He shut off the rest of the world, Mrs. Hudson the only one to see him somewhat regularly now, and that was when he decided to roll out of bed.  Greg and Mycroft he ignored.  He blamed them, in part, for Sherlock’s undoing.
Sherlock stood up harshly, his chair clattering as he stalked away, “And this is precisely why I didn’t want to tell you.  Since the feeling is not mutual, you will just ridicule me for having these feelings in the first place.  I do not appreciate-“
“He looks like you,” John murmured, “Has your eyes and hair.”
Sherlock glared at John.  He knew how much Sherlock hated to repeat himself.  John help up his hands in defense and cleared his throat.
He dropped the bottle as though it had burnt him and slammed back up against the wall as the bottle shattered against the ground, trying to back away from the shards of glass that sprayed out from the impact.  There was a small pool of wine on the ground, too, and he briefly wondered if the red alcohol would stain the floor.  A white wine would have probably been a better one to drop if he had really needed to do such a thing.  It wasn’t like he was going out driving after this.  He wasn’t anything like his sister.  It was just Christmas.  And being alone.
It had taken them almost ten years to reach this moment.  Ten years that included faked deaths, confused emotions, and one drunk night in bed to get them here.  And John wasn’t going to have any more of Sherlock’s whining.  He had already heard enough of it throughout their lifetime, but over the past two year, it had seemed to increase tenfold.  “No, we can’t be having her be the surrogate.  She’ll give the child her habits, I know it.”  “Oh, but we shouldn’t buy that brand.  It isn’t as good as this one.”  “Don’t be so daft, John, obviously the cot has to be put here.”  “Why don’t you ever like what I buy?  It’s just a pirate hat, he’ll grow into it.”  And now, as John stood there, one hand in Sherlock’s, his other being squeezed to death by the woman, Olivia, currently giving birth to their child, he was about ready to punch Sherlock if he asked how much longer it would take before the baby was born.  It was as if he was some child on a road trip asking if they were there yet every five minutes.
John snorted, following after.
Mycroft huffs, hiding a laugh. “Yes, most don’t realize. Their minds just marvel at the beauty and slip right over the oddity. This is the current shrine of Tianlong.”
“He went to Afghanistan in search of information. I had him under the protection of powerful mages, but I should have known that would not be enough.”
He cleaned his jacket and gloves of blood, careful to remove all traces. Cleaning away the murder was surprisingly easy. The men from the illegal club were hardly likely to speak out, even if they did remember that Moran had followed him out. He had made sure to avoid CCTV and the hunting knife he had used was a common model, easily bought in any sporting store.
“But Sir, we don’t get inspected here Sir, it just doesn’t happen,” the Corporal stammers.
“I might not,” John whispered, pressing his hand against Helios’s flank.
Four days later, Sherlock can’t decide if he likes Greg, or wants to poison his coffee.
John considers it the height of restraint that he does not smack his head against his palm. “Sherlock!” he groans.
At the back of the group, perched on a short ledge, is the largest pigeon Mycroft has ever seen. He seems to be holding court for a group of pigeons, that stare up at him with awe as he gestures his wings wildly. He is wearing a tiny crown on his head.
“You know who/what it is?”
A Link, one of the many terms for the people that help lead angels to their One, Lestrade supposes it is apt. “Yes.”
“No the rails are warded, but the Khatib station was attacked last week. No one was injured, but they had to replace the train,” Navamas says, flicking her fingers until a green glow-globe appears in her palm. “Check the rear of the train, I’ll take the front. Be careful,” she orders before heading up the car.
The shield cracks, dispelling in a shimmer of blue light. Lestrade rushes forward, if Sherlock moves then he’ll have to restart the spell. He dodges under an arm, close enough to shift his hair. The stab is low in what would be the gut, the athame only going in halfway, the clay making up the creature is stronger than he expected.
“I can break it,” Sherlock argues.
There is warmth in his chest, comfort. A sense of security. He’s safe, but no, the feathers twist, curling inwards. Gold turns to rust, white bleeds black. The brilliant wings burst in unholy light, feathers exploding in all directions.
“Yeah,” John grits out, “yeah.” He grabs up his pint and downs what is left in one great swallow before slamming the glass down. “I have to go,” he says standing.
The locking of eyes is essential for the connection of every bond, it’s something Sherlock learned in Primary school, which makes the time it takes him to catch on rather embarrassing. His back already hurts from his disarrayed primaries, so when sharp pain shoots down his shoulder blades, he thinks he may have broken one of the sensitive feathers.
I love outsider POV and have always wanted to write one, so this my attempt. It was also a good practice with writing dialog, I skill I'm horrible at. Either way, hope you enjoyed it.
“Oh no, I ensured it. She offered me a special rate on the flat in return.”
Lestrade looked like he wanted to argue, but his eyes shifted over to Mycroft for a moment before he shrugged.
It was a smooth lift, he never would have noticed if he didn’t always pay more attention on this side of town. The kid is a surprise. He’s probably close to twelve, but barely looks ten. He’s skinny and his clothes could use a good washing, but he looks surprisingly healthy for a street kid. His eyes are fiercely intelligent, some blend of bluish-green he can’t name, and his hair is a riot of dark curls that could desperately use a cut and cleaning.
“Oh,” Sherlock clapped,” that is perfect,” he ran his fingers along Hyperion’s back. The scales were smooth and warm; he didn’t feel very much like a reptile at all. “Can you hold it?”
Mycroft blinks, surprised. The date had escaped him, with the mess in New York and the time change, he hadn’t noticed. Distantly, he thinks about calling his brother, but he sets his focus on John. “Compared to New York, Hong Kong certainly lacks the holiday spirit.”
John crumbles the letter. It goes up in a puff of smoke, golden fire licking over his fingers. He feels bad the moment it’s gone, but his anger doesn’t lesson. He has every intention of visiting the same fate on the box, but his curiosity gets the better of him.
John flashes in and out of consciousness, but he can tell something is holding him under. There is the whoosh whoosh of a helicopter, a sound of safety he would recognize anywhere. He can hear Harry yelling for him. But mostly there is darkness and pain.
The lobby is just as awe inspiring and decorated for the occasion. A large Christmas tree greets them in the entrance, covered in faerie lights and glass ornaments in all shapes and sizes. John laughs and points out actual fairies that dart about the branches, their gossamer wings reflecting the lights in multi-coloured displays.
“What?” Lestrade startles, shooting him a look. “I...well I have no idea honestly. I sort of assumed he was one of those people that just didn’t have one.”
“Yes, I do,” Sherlock tugs his necklace out from his shirt, revealing a set of soul rings.
Mycroft notes that none of that statement is actually listed as a request. Still, this has been what he was waiting for, even if he would have prefered MI5’s domestic security instead of MI6’s more international habits. “Then I can only hope that I exceed your expectations, Agent.”
“I said if,” Sherlock sniffs, offended.
In his first study of the bonds, Sherlock thought the idea of having one perfect person for him in the world was a grand thing, but further study showed cases like his Mummy, who suffered from a weak bond.
“I can tell you I will enjoy beating him to a pulp,” Moran growls.
Chapter Seven
“Christ!” Lestrade shouts, following after, “Be careful!”
“Am I late?” John asks, looking at the beer.
“Of course, Professor! That explains the novels in her purse!” Sherlock exclaimed. “I need to go back to the crime scene,” he spun on a dime, his coat flapping dramatically, but he only made it a few yards before having to stop. “Hyperion,” He called, voice strained.
He has to heave himself into a sitting position, his muscles are weak and wobbly with disuse. He rubs the crust of sleep from his eyes, taking in the obnoxious beeping of the surrounding machines and the harsh scent of antiseptic.
Ten minutes later, he is standing outside the caution tape waiting for the man. Normally, he would let Sally or one of the constables let him in, but he’s not in the mood for the hostility.
John can’t help but laugh, “Actually getting some sleep tonight, or chasing clues all over London with the world’s only consulting detective? Hardly a choice at all.”
’ vision. He has to approach this carefully.
The door opens before he can knock. “Finally!” Sherlock shouts, pulling Lestrade into the house and slamming the door behind him. “We’ve been waiting ages.”
Greg gives a hurry up motion with his hands.
“Sherlock, he is a terror, but he is mine,” Mycroft says, some of the stiffness leaving his face. He takes a breath and pulls the phone to him.
Sherlock had never seen someone more beautiful in his life.
“Looking for what? Not money,” John furrows his brow in confusion.
Lestrade’s never heard a bigger load of bollocks in his life, but instead of calling him out on it, he offers his arm with a grin. “I’d love a coffee.”
“I apparently should,” the man replied. He stalked forward and leaned in front of the small pile of golden dust that had once been the dead man’s daemon.
“I’m heading back to the Yard, I need to see if I can track down those two idiots.” Lestrade decides to walk back, its not far and he doesn’t feel right taking one of the police cars for just himself. He’s barely gone a few yards when the phone box in front of him starts ringing. He ignores it, but by the third ringing phone, he gives in and answers. “Hello?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Her strange aura makes sense now. The earthy gold that shows a bonded angel. A happily bonded, powerful archangel to be exact. “I…” John starts, stopping when he can’t think of anything to say. He’s never met an ascended angel, not even a seraph. Face to face with an archangel is a bit like looking directly into the sun.
“You know, you could be anywhere from 17 to 30, its very distracting,” Irene commented, though she looked pleased at the challenge.
“Barely, we must have run for miles,” John sighs pulling off the cloth around his mouth.
John thinks as they leave Angelo’s.
Bethesda comes to life with screech of metal. “Oh,” she exclaims, and glides down to them. “I haven’t seen one of you in a long time.” She reaches out and touches John cheek, but he can’t quite hide his flinch.
“London is my city, I prefer to keep her clean,” Moriarty’s gave a dangerous smirk.
Mycroft cannot see the eye, the power it produces shrouds it in fiery light. The shield shudders, rolling wildly in the heat. He concentrates his power on slowing the molecules, a process that keeps the shield just cool enough not to boil them alive. “Now John!”
Sherlock sighs, “The case, Lestrade. Have you had any updates?”
“Aren’t there hospitals a little closer?” Greg asks, because he’s almost positive they already passed one.
“I’ll be there soon, Sherlock, just hold on.” John whispered, taking aim.
“You do know how to use these, right?”
The next day they take Murray away for a few hours and when he comes back, he’s a bruised mess and his breathing sounds even worse.
“Do you know where he went?” Mycroft asks.
Tianlong turns the full force of her gaze on him. “We all felt the loss of Boston ring through the void, and others have started to weaken, but I have seen no sign of the culprit. Though my dear brothers Hong have disappeared since the last moon cycle. They have never left their post and yet now the gates stand unguarded. I fear the worst. Seek Temasek in Singapore, he is well connected and will know why Java has gone quiet.”
Mycroft is inclined to agree. The bog smells like rot and death, and the feel of the blight-magic against his senses is enough to bring up bile.
Sherlock can’t quite hide the hurt that crosses his face, but he exchanges it quickly for a scowl. “Then don’t think, clearly it isn’t doing you any favours. I told you, it is winter holidays and I.”
Gabriel huffs, but takes a seat without comment.
Lestrade gives one, long, slow blink. “What?”
The courtyard is empty, but for two black stallions. They stand under an apple tree beside the east wall, heads pressed together like gossipy old women. Their coats are a fathomless black, like the night sky given form, and their eyes are molten gold.
“Sherlock,” John calls, running forward, slipping his gun away as he moves. “Hey,” he says softly, kneeling before him so he can cradle his head in his hands. The head wound is bleeding badly, as they always do.
“Trespasser,” hijra hisses, leaning through the dust. Their human half is split right down the middle, purple on one side and blue on the other. A purple hand reaches out, golden bangles clattering together.
“John, you have moved into my mind, I hardly think moving into my flat will be a problem. There is a room upstairs. You can meet the landlady, Mrs. Hudson tomorrow. Now, I can tell you are exhausted, we will sort everything else out tomorrow.” Sherlock would have made an interesting officer; he certainly had the commanding voice down.
Carson shook in his restraints. “What will you take this time?”
In college, more and more went in search of their bonds. Marks soon appeared on more wrists than not.
“Hmm, I’ve been accused of such before, but usually a riding crop is involved,” Irene said, clearly trying to hide how pleased she was. Even in her career, she had a weakness for compliments. She took a bite of her tortellini and then blinked in surprise. “Oh, this is good!”
Sherlock scowls, “Its more unique than John.”
“It is fine, you know, the dreams,” Sherlock says, stepping up beside him.
“A Wu,” Sherlock spins to face him. “A Wu is the name for Chinese Magi, they are Shaman that use a mixture of elemental and enchanting magicks. This sort of mark work would be a specialty of theirs, and Soo Lin mentioned a Necromancer, of course. They control their foot soldiers through the mark, a mix of threat and control to get them to do what they want.”
It takes hours to get off the train, even with Agent Navamas guarding them from official questioning. It takes coordination to get everyone off the train and to walk along the track to the Marina Bay station.
The line beeps, Mycroft having hung up on his end. “Shite,” Sherlock growls, slamming the phone down. He stomps up to his room on principle, and lets his door slam when he realizes Mycroft managed to evade the question. Who is John?
Of course, Mycroft’s vision had shown the guardian at night so they have a few hours yet. They check into their hotel, a looming skyscraper with amazing views of the city, but John’s wings droop as he looks out at the city.
“What?” Bill asked, confused.
“Come on, I don’t know if that will stop it if it’s mad enough,” John says, grabbing Sherlock’s wrist, ignoring the skull clenched in his fingers, and tugs him back to the main path.
“Don’t be stupid, never leave a fallen comrade, ain’t that right, Sarge?” Z snarls.
“What do you think I was doing in the lab? Mrs. Hudson let me look at some of her husband’s old shoes. I analyzed the soil samples I scraped off the bottom and found this location.” Sherlock preens.
Bonus Image:
“I am,” Mrs. Hudson says without hesitation.
The techs go to the bodies in a flurry of activity, taking pictures and cataloging evidence. “I’ll take it from here Sergeant,” DI Gregson announces, breezing into the scene.
There is magic in the wood, as there is in all Stradivarius instruments, and it reaches out to him now in response, a haunting tone all of it’s own. He runs his fingers over the smooth wood, leaving impressions of his own magic behind. It is a soothing ritual.
When John finally entered the shower, he was disgusted to watch the water run black as he washed his own hair and beard. He had never let himself get this bad, not even in Afghanistan. He used a razor to shave off his rather patchy beard, but they had to go to a barbers to deal with his hair.
Sherlock swiftly got to his feet before the students could say anything. “If you want to know who it is, just wait in the hallway near the classroom to see if any students go back in. If you really observe, which I doubt you have the capability of doing, you may notice bird food or even white feathers on their uniform.”
“Yes,” Sherlock replied shortly, his expression blank but his eyes softer than usual. As the train came racing into the station, John turned and began walking towards it.
“Oh!” They kept walking in silence until a thought came to John. “Wait…did you just play matchmaker between those two?” he smirked.
“I’m actually interested in joining. I’ve just come by to check it out.”
The president continued to glare challengingly at Sherlock. “That’s none of your business, freak.”
This was no different from every other day so far in John Watson’s mundane high school life.
Before she had a chance to open her mouth again and drive John further up the wall, Sherlock stepped back. “It’s easy really,” he began in a clipped tone. “Judging by the pristine state of your clothes and appearance of having done no labor at all—lack of sweat, hair intact, the like—despite the cleaning supplies and the clean room, someone else did the work for you. You want to know who it is, or rather why they did it, hence my presence. Well, the person responsible did not expect anyone to go looking for them, let alone catch them, as they were doing a favor to the students on duty. Obviously cleaned beforehand in order to prevent those students from cleaning too thoroughly and finding something, a hidden object. If you examine the room, you can ascertain what that object is.”
Sherlock didn’t return his gaze, rather averting his eyes to the cracked pavement beneath their feet, his smile fading. He seemed to think a while. “I…cannot,” he slowly replied.
“The more you know, right?” John laughed sheepishly, pushing down the twinge at hearing the word
Sherlock motioned to the packaging of a few chemicals, which had evidently been opened, the contents smaller in quantity than the other substances.
Sherlock’s deduction skills had never been directed at John before. Before he could reply, Sherlock turned back around and kept walking. “More importantly, we must take a short trip to the student council room.” John felt a pang of disappointment at being brushed off as he watched Sherlock grow smaller, telling himself that he already knew he wasn’t a very noticeable person to Sherlock to begin with.
The sunset had painted the streets in warm colors of orange and peach as they walked, and leaves skittering across the air signaled a fast-approaching autumn. As they strolled in comfortable silence, John glanced sidelong at Sherlock every so often to find the warm breeze gently ruffling his dark curls and his icy eyes seemingly glowing in the light.
“Eh? How do you know?” John gaped.
Suddenly, a strangled noise came out of him that vaguely resembled a laugh. “Just kidding,” he said in a shrill voice.
“Just wanted to say hi…and I was wondering if you had any new cases,” John said hesitantly.
The next day, John showed up at the clubroom only to be stopped halfway through the doorway by Sherlock. “We have another client,” he said urgently. He slid past John into the hallway, and just as John moved aside for Lestrade to get past as well, Sherlock looked back.
John cleared his throat a few times in the long stretch of silence. “Do you think…” he began carefully, “…you’d consider my friendship offer?”
When the doors opened to the station near his school, John walked off and fell into step with the other uniform-clad students towards the school’s entrance. Soon he felt a playful slap on his back and an arm slung around his shoulders.
“Thank you again,” he heard Sherlock shout from behind him. He swiveled around to see Sherlock a distance away, his face flushed ever so slightly. He eventually met John’s gaze, and a warm smile broke out across his face.
Classes flew by, and instead of leaving school when they finished, John found himself facing the door to the clubroom of the Mystery-Solving Club, taking a few moments to bring himself to turn the doorknob. He opened the door and hesitantly peered inside.
Sherlock got closer to the president’s face, peering at him down his nose. “No interest in chemistry, then, seeing as you hand off presidential responsibility to an equally busy club member. You wouldn’t be the president of that club, or the vice president for that matter, if it weren’t for your strict parents’ insistence to excel at everything.” Sherlock sneered. “You don’t care about any of this, do you?”
Sherlock cast a vaguely disapproving glance in the general direction of her skirt before meeting her gaze apathetically. “The pleasure is all yours. I presume you called me here because after-school duties have been repeatedly finished beforehand by an unknown student.”
“No, we’ve never used those during club hours.” Iki frowned.
“Okay…” he said finally. “So, what’s the real reason?”
Sherlock made no move even as Kyouya Hinakawa walked right up to the men and began conversing with them. John didn’t dare even breathe as he carefully observed Sherlock’s calculating gaze, waiting for some sort of signal. Hinakawa pulled out his schoolbag and began prying it open—
Sherlock wasted no time in hounding the guy. “I have been informed that you are in charge of the keys to the clubroom. Why, then, have you not made an active effort in finding the culprit if you are the most likely member to be blamed by teachers for missing equipment?”
“We also have another member missing, Kyouya Hinakawa,” Iki added. John recognized the name of the idolized basketball player, charming and popular with guys and girls alike.
When they arrived, the meeting had already been dismissed as students had begun to leave the room. Sherlock waltzed in while Lestrade looked around apologetically. Sherlock strode right up to one of the students near the front of the room who was organizing some files.
“Oh, you Cupid, you!” John laughed.
John frowned at the lack of honorific, but then again, it was so Sherlock. He shrugged and chuckled, “Why not?”
“What matters is I solved the case. Their compatibility was just a coincidence,” he huffed, though his voice had a playful undertone.
an annoyance to Sherlock? As per usual, John could decipher none of Sherlock’s intentions or real feelings towards him. Perhaps that mystery kept him coming back despite Sherlock’s standoffish nature.
He’d been too far away to notice the unshed tears and the brokenness of Sherlock’s smile.
“What a crude way of phrasing it.” Sherlock wrinkled his nose in distaste.
If he had told any of his classmates, they would have said "You obviously haven't met him" and "You don't know what you're getting into."
Lestrade paled a bit. “You don’t mean…”
John, who stood dazed at the entrance of the clubroom, shook himself a bit. “Oh, right.” And so, he was whisked away yet again on a dubious undertaking with Sherlock Holmes.
“You felt that across town?”
Lestrade shakes his head, “That isn’t a good idea, he’s in maximum security lock-up, and you know he’ll just screw with your head.”
Sherlock tried to memorize everything he could about both of their dirt covered faces. He knew he now owed Murray for the life of his mate.
“No,” John shook his head. “It’s not time.”
John stood there. He was in a horrible black jumper and cargo pants. He had an illegal rifle slung over his shoulder and his hair was more grey than blonde.
Sherlock scoffed, “Such a romantic notion.” But he looked pleased, his inner thoughts practically purring at having a higher bond then his brother.
Everything goes dark, and he is grateful for it.
Sherlock sighs, but opens up his door wider. “Come on then.” John follows Sherlock into the room, the door slamming shut behind them.
Lestrade took the needle and placed it in the evidence bag Donovan handed him. Then he held out his hand, “Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade and this is Riddell, now why don’t you tell me a bit more about this obvious murder.”
There is a long table set on the right of the room, in front of a series of drying shelves. There is an older gentleman putting the finishing touches on a large vase covered in dancing girls, and a person of indeterminate gender putting together a set of chubby clay birds that seem to be trying to tweet, but aren’t making any noise. No one so much as spares them a glance.
“Yes, yes, I’ll take it from here,” Gregson dismisses them with a wave of his hand.
Sherlock and John had tracked the killer down to a Tesco-express, of all places, and because Sherlock has all the subtlety of a nuclear bomb, the man did not react well.
“Golems are only as strong as their construct, they can be destroyed with an enchanted weapon,” Lestrade says shifting the grip on his blade.
Hudson River gives a throaty growl like the backfiring of a car. He’s laughing. “A Guardian can be killed, but not by mortal hands.” He hisses, forked tongue flicking out, “Demons are clawing their way out of the pits, ancient Darklings that have not seen mortal lands since the first dawn. A war is brewing.”
John fought to be better than his broken family. In secondary school he earned top grades and attended every class, even when his mother’s drinking habits left him with little supervision.
“Sherlock! Sherlock!” someone is calling him from across the room, but not touching him. Thankfully not touching him, his skin feels scraped raw, it is a sensory overload.
“I took the train, it’s fine.”
Lestrade sighs. He doesn’t have time for this. The MET has been swamped with cases all month; rogue demon summonings, fae coming out of the woodwork, and bizarre runes being spray painted all over town. He’s never been so busy, but Sherlock needs his help. He actually asked for it. Lestrade feels a sharp pain beneath his breastbone, an insistent tugging. “Alright,” he mutters, “I’ll be there by tonight.”
“He’s telling the truth, dull,” Sherlock sighs, leaning back.
“Was the other a decoy?” Mycroft asked, surprised.
“A room please, for two,” John says sidling up to the register.
“You won’t, have much paperwork that is, it’s being taken care of.”
“I think it’s a bit more than rubbish.” Going on a hunch, because she is clearly lying, he pulls up his sleeve to reveal the small black lines working their way through his mark. They had only been a few centimeters long the night before, but not the marks have worked their way into the first ring of symbols, black marks digging their way into the signs for soldier and danger.
“Sorry mate, you may be blonde, but you’re about a foot too short.” Bill dodged an elbow to his side.
The shot must hit true, because the heat disperses. Balor roars, cursing them in demonic as the light tears him apart from the inside out. A white glow starts in his third eye, working outward in fine cracks along his body. He claws at his head, scoring great gouges as he tried to claw the holy magic out of him.
Lestrade rushes his two men, leading with a powerful shield spell to separate them from Sherlock’s choice. The man with the spear lunges, scraping off the shield. Lestrade draws his athame, spinning it in his hand to block the sword coming at his side.
Mycroft rather agrees with him. He’d certainly never met the Cat Queen or Rat King of London. He tries looking on the astral plane and a spark of power in the back of the group draws his attention. He wades carefully through the birds, they barely shift out of his way, cooing angrily at him for interrupting their meal.
John looks in the bag, but in the shadows it just looks like something in gravy all mushed together, it doesn’t really smell like anything. He takes a bite and its half hot half cold and he thinks it might be a pasta of some sort. The others are diving into their food, scarfing it down in huge gulps. John follows their example, if he eats fast enough he doesn’t have to taste it.
John huffs, “Miracle that, considering all the trouble you’ve gotten up too since we met.”
Hamish was left standing in the hall, shaking.
Sherlock is perched on his chair, fingers pressed to his lips in his standard thinking pose. He has his legs up in the chair, sitting cross legged in the furniture in a posture more reminiscent of a toddler than a grown man. Bluebell is sprawled in his lap, unmoving but for the twitching of her nose.
Henry leads, his breathing is rapid and uneven. “T..th..this w..way,” he is shaking, but he moves through the forest sure of his destination.
“Sherlock what are we looking for, exactly?” John asks.
“Woah, woah, hey,” Lestrade fusses, “Lay back down, christ.”
The estate is quite the distance from the station, but even the thought of getting into a cab grates, so he walks. By the time he walks through the front gates, the sun is setting and his legs ache.
Mycroft only moves enough to roll his eyes. “Honestly, brother,” he sighs.
Carson flinched, his eyes were still covered and the jab must have been a shock.
Smith casts a vicious claymore spell that severs the mannequin from it’s post. “No,” He says flatly, hands still forming runes.
Also, because I never described it very well, the chapter intro pic is the symbol of the Summoner's College.
Hamish stares at him, wide-eyed and dumb, his brain wasn’t firing correctly, he was short-circuiting.
John leans against the jeep’s passenger door, still feeling wrung out. He hasn’t felt this weak since he got shot, but he is enjoying watching Sherlock do all the work loading the boot.
“I didn’t open it,” the man runs his hand through his already messy black hair. He’s pale enough to be practically translucent his veins running like blue marks beneath his skin.
Lestrade rolls his eyes. “Sure,” he drawls, sceptical.
Gabriel flexs, shoulders bunching, and her wings explode into view. There are three sets! Three sets of glorious white-gold wings.
Bauza is chained up next to him, but is still unconscious. The man has been shot in the upper arm and someone bothered to wrap a filthy cloth around the wound, but blood is still seeping sluggishly down his arm. It drips to the dirt in a steady plop, and John must still be drugged, because he spends minutes watching the hypnotic fall.
This chapter sort of got away from me, it did not go in the direction I was aiming at all.
The scale is more delicate. He pulls it down from the shelf with care, before picking up his set of calibrated weights. They gleam in their padded box, each steel cylinder etched with their weight along the top edge.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I’m not an idiot, besides, I saw all I needed coming through the flat. Eddie Van Coon was left handed.”
Before he can make it through the main door of the temple, however, he is stopped by security staff. “Sir, you can view the main temple from the platform,” the man informs him in accented english, pointing at a laneway to the right of the entrance.
“This is HQ?” John asks, staring up at the parapets in awe as they drive into the courtyard.
John can’t keep a straight face, his wings shiver. They both burst into laughter.
“Obviously,” Sherlock snaps. Idiot man, as if Sherlock would ask to use a lab without knowing how to use the equipment. It is a slow and tedious process, so Sherlock turns to Lestrade to entertain himself. “Sergeant Donovan is a Class 8 Enchanter.”
There was only a bed, made up in floral sheets that had to belong to the landlady, and a small side table with lamp.
John stops, turning his attention to Mycroft. He sounds off, his usual teaching tone falling flat. Of course that is hardly a surprise. They had both been struck by the warning in Hong Kong. Neither of them had wanted to leave, but Smith had insisted they follow Tianlong’s advice.
There is a long pause, and Mycroft watches the three dots dance at the bottom of the screen. He can practically hear Sherlock’s frustration.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft hisses.
“Yes, I ahh…” John clenches his free hand, displaying the bond mark, “I got shot.”
Sherlock had met Lestrade six months ago when he had helped him solve a case on his university campus. Solving the case had been exhilarating, and Sherlock had finally decided what he wanted to do. He was going to be a consulting detective, the only one in the world, but first he had to complete this mandatory Vision record.
Mycroft looks unconvinced, but Sherlock shoots forward with a manic grin. “Why didn’t you start there? What kind of case? Nothing dull I hope.”
Mycroft moves his hands in a complicated gesture and with a soft ‘pop’ a book appears in the air. It looks old, leather bound and pages yellowed. It also appears quite heavy as it falls to the bed with a solid thud.
Uriel is on another perch, below and to the right of him. She’s sprawled out on her belly, wings hanging dramatically.
As the fabric unwinds the air grows hot, it becomes a physical thing, clinging to them as the temperature rises. Mycroft risks a backwards look at Balor. He can still see the powerful light hiding behind the cloth. It reeks of destructive energies. Looking at him now though, Mycroft gets a flash of possibility.
He approaches slowly, watching the care in which she handles the set. She has small, delicate hands, but Sherlock can see the strength in them in the way she moves. “A strange place to work for a sculptor,” Sherlock comments, stepping up to the display.
“Please don’t tell me we have to do another summoning?”
Lestrade had looked surprised, he certainly expected the bond to take or he would not have suggested it.
“Ahh,” John hums, understanding, “lets get them back then.”
Mycroft raised his hand for silence. “The cuff I was given is a top secret device belonging to the British government. It was known to have the ability to travel across time zones, but as far as I am aware the code to activate it was lost.”
Sherlock holds his glass up in a mock toast, “You keep my life interesting.”
They all strain anxiously against their binds. Even Don is awake, looking down the hall as best he can.
“Please keep your guard up, I think things are going to get very dangerous soon,” Hamish pleaded, hoping she could read his sincerity.
The beast lifts up causing the chairs to creek. It looms over the flames, massive chest dipping into the blaze. Sparks dart away from it, the inferno hitting a wall and flickering off. It grins, “I am protected.”
Art by Kricket
“Just all the guns and uniforms really, I think they mostly just do research.” John is looking around more this time, noting the different buildings and possible exit points. Despite his still persistent headache, he doesn’t want to be caught unawares. He can’t explain it, but something about the base sets his teeth on edge.
“She’s just sick,” the man snarls. He steps up to Helios and grabs her by the scruff. She snarls viciously beneath the muzzle, but can barely move.
John can’t say the words, but his mind echoes across the bond,
“You’re having trouble with Guardians, who tend to be much more helpful to Seers and even more so to angels.” Mycroft states, his gaze is fierce, almost threatening as he pulls from a vision. “While I have no objection to beginning training immediately, I will require a chance to call my brother. If I do not give him some information he will assume something nefarious has occurred and I assure you he will find you.”
“I highly doubt it, I’m class 12.”
They both offer another bow, grateful for the information no matter how disappointing. “Thank you,” John says again, flicking his wings so they disappear.
Lestrade narrows his eyes. “Where are you from?”
It had been two weeks since the visit to the flat in southern London. The body had been cleaned away, but the table and floor had been coated with blood, blackened with age and crackling like bad paint.
Lestrade knew a runner when he saw one. He stepped in closer, close enough to tackle. “We need to ask you some questions Mr…”
“Are you alright? I should look at that,” John gestures to the rip in Sherlock’s coat.
(See the end of the chapter for
Three shots from the soldiers behind the wall brought the sixth man down, but not before the other bullet had burned its way through the Captain’s shoulder.
The entire contents of the bowl are mixed before being placed in a 500ml graduated cylinder. The paste comes exactly to the 100 ml mark, perfect. He measures out 400 ml of 0.9% saline solution and adds it to the paste. With a glass stirring rod, he stirs the solution 15 times before setting the timer for 1 hour.
Mycroft doesn’t have much energy left, but he uses what he has to draw the water of the lake to him. Water shields hardly take any energy, even less if he doesn’t have to summon the water out of the air. The lake curls around them, a dome of grey liquid. He puts all he has into the shield, strengthening it until the water glows violet with runes.
His heavy boot sends Sherlock flying. He lands hard on the ground, his heart pounding and chest burning, he may have bruised his ribs. Its too late now, and Sherlock refuses to watch his mummy’s gift get smashed to pieces. He turns his head away, squeezing his eyes closed and ignoring the burning behind his lids, but the sound of smashing wood doesn’t come. Instead, there is the dull thud of flesh hitting flesh.
Sherlock snarls, fingers clenching over the grip of the gun. “I will shoot you.” He clicks the safety off with a flick of his thumb before pulling back on the hammer. The click of the round sliding into place seems deafening in the room.
“Well observed John, now hush,” Sherlock gestured towards the recorder. It hissed with static before Mycroft’s smug voice came over it.
Sherlock nods, only half listening, his attention is on Soo Lin.
“Try to stay outta trouble, yeah,” Greg calls to him as he takes his place on the sofa beside Mycroft.
John could feel Sherlock’s nervousness, he was proud of his job as consulting detective, but he was not unaware of the animosity most felt towards him. John gave his hand a quick squeeze before letting go. The brief contact brought a flair of warmth along the connection.
John watches wide-eyed for just a moment. He has to trust Smith knows what he is doing. With a shaky breath, he shoots down the final corridor.
“You hunt death as a cub chases its tail, with no thought of what to do if you catch it.” Placing a paw on either side of the train seats, the creature heaves itself up, claws scraping.
“Huh,” Lestrade mutters, wiping the tears from his eyes. He’s never seen himself in a trance, obviously, but he isn’t surprised. With as much power as he is channeling, it makes sense that it would come out through the source of the focus.
Sand clogs his nose and mouth, drowning him. He hacks trying to draw more air than dust into his lungs.
Lestrade chuckles at that, his wings shifting with mirth, “Yeah I can see your point, just try and leave the lab be for a bit, eh? I thought that entomologist was going to punch you in the face, and that old man is one of the most laid back Full-Birds I’ve ever met.”
The pain disperses so suddenly it is it’s own sort of agony. “Wha?” he gasps, finally opening his eyes. Agent Smith is hovering over him, James not far behind, wings spread in concern.
“Oh,” Murray mumbles, clutching at his own metal. “Afghanistan?”
“I don’t know, those boys seemed rather frightened of you,” John remarked, looking decidedly not frightened.
Thinking of Anne and baby, John waves him off. “No, I’ll be good, see you. And congrats again.”
“Sorry, I didn’t know he was yours,” Bruiser wheezes, his voice gurgly from the blood pouring down his face. He hands over the instrument carefully. It will take a bit to retune it, but it looks undamaged.
“Sherlock are you ever going to tell me where we are going?” Greg asked, jogging to keep up.
“Careful,” Smith says, looking down to where his shadow has split again, blank eyes squinting up at him. “That wasn’t all of them.”
Mycroft shrugs, gaze still fixed out into the dark. “Yes, popcorn. Salt and sugar all tied with steel like a cage. I should have brought the brolly,” he murmurs, clenching his fingers. They had sent their luggage ahead to the hotel. John touches his pocket, feeling the shape of the healing stones he is now very grateful to be carrying.
“Er…” John pauses, trying to decipher Sherlock’s words, “Yeah, we did bomb disposal between missions.” He steps next to Sherlock to get a better look at the map. A few of the victim pictures have daemon profiles attached, but not Carol’s. “Poor Sage, I always thought the worst thing about Afghanistan was seeing the daemons disappear, nothing but a memory.”
John rolls his eyes at the lecture, but gives Mycroft his full attention.
Henry, surprisingly, doesn’t hesitate. He gives a firm nod, “O...Okay.”
“Did it work?” It takes Sherlock a moment to place the voice as Lestrade’s.
Sherlock sat back in the chair, watching the slide of the needle into his arm. The antivenom is cold in his overheated blood stream. “Thank you, Dr. Stapleton,” he says, pulling his sleeve down and waving off her offer of gauze.
There is a new bond in his familia center. It should have been impossible to invoke a name bond without his permission, but Mycroft knows better than to think impossible where his brother is concerned.
“Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it,” Bill shouldered the rifle. “I’ve got a case for it.”
For Whom the Bell Tolls
“Mycroft,” Lestrade grins, standing up and pressing a kiss to his husband’s lips. “How’d it go?”
They have to abandon the cougar at the start of a cave system, around 50 kilometers from the initial ambush.
When Sherlock comes back into his mind, his back and chest aches with the sudden change. He knows that his secondary lungs have now filled, that his ribs have widened to accommodate larger, deeper breaths. He knows his heart has enlarged relative to his new wings, he can feel the organ pumping wildly in his chest, sending blood into the new growth.
It was broad daylight, making a place for the poisoning harder to find, but judging by the cab’s turns, they were heading for the warehouse district.
Sherlock sent his thoughts along the link, not willing to say the words out loud.
“WHAT!?” John shrieked, and his voice tilted embarrassingly high for a moment.
“I’m sorry,” Mycroft repeats, and he sounds sincere. “I got caught up in...work,” his speech is stilted. Sherlock knows that Mycroft wasn’t offered a position in transportation, that had just been smoke screen for whatever agency was listening on the other end, either MI5 or MI6. Considering his brother’s sudden leave of the country, he is rather certain Mycroft’s new employers are MI6.
She shoots him a grin, “Variant of the concussive spell. Shields that strong are hard to crack but easy to push.” As she speaks, her hands are rapidly forming the spell again.
Unfortunately, the young man in the grey suit does feel the removal of his wallet from his back pocket as Sherlock slips by in the crowd. The man spins and grabs his arm, the grip is tight, but not bruising.
“Why don’t you come home with us, John? Sherlock is right about the guest room and I can hardly let you wander off into the streets, dear,” Mummy offers, her voice soft and soothing like speaking to a feral animal.
John summons Witness and forces Mycroft to take it. The mage gives him a bewildered look. “It will fire for you,” he says, though he doesn’t know how many shots the gun can actually manage without John funneling his magic directly into it. There is no time for hesitation, however. The sniper, John had thought gone, has only moved and is now aiming for Gabriel. Only Ruiz’s quick magic has kept the shots from hitting their target.
Lestrade claps John on the shoulder, grip firm and reassuring. “Alright, just don’t do anything stupid, okay?”
He doesn’t learn the boy’s name that time either, but he does learn that he is even more extraordinarily intelligent than he first thought. The boy reads out his whole life story with a glance that leaves John feeling stripped. He wished he had more time to talk, but he couldn’t miss his next fight.
Sherlock moves between the maze of stones to two graves a little off from the rest. The tombstones are a high-sheen black like onyx, protected under the shadow of a great oak. There is a large crow sitting on the left grave. It glares at Sherlock, eyes gleaming. “Shoo,” Sherlock snarls, flicking out a stinging rune. It misses. The crow flies off with a screech like laughter.
Gregson pointed at the far wall.
“I’m happy for you, you know. Even if he is the Freak’s brother.” Sally bumped his shoulder and handed him a coffee, still steaming.
“I’m not a recalcitrant child,” Sherlock snarls, ignoring Lestrade’s snort of amusement. “I found our sculptor.”
The taunting grin on Moriarty’s face falls away. He snarls, rage blooming over his features. “Learning new tricks Johnny boy? Did Sherlock give you that one?”
The words were like an adrenaline shot to John’s heart. He clicked the gun from safe to semi.
As he was pulled on the helicopter, he could have sworn he saw a man in the distance, a civilian with black hair and a long coat. “Sherlock,” he muttered, not sure where the name came from.
“Right,” Lestrade says, and with nothing else to do, follows the directions. The building has that stuffy government feel, but there is no sign that indicates where, exactly, he is. The first office on the right, however, does hold one Mycroft Holmes. Lestrade only met him briefly, but he looks exactly the same - three-piece suit and all.
The King tucks the slipping crown back up. “Ya, ya, but aye require tribute.”
Sherlock cuts him off. “Tomorrow, you are having coffee with me. Downstairs there is a local cafe, their tea is horrendous but they make a passable coffee.”
Sherlock makes a curious noise and kneels down to look, his fingers a hair’s breath from touching. “Car accident, IED,” he mutters.
He goes straight to Mycroft’s house, not bothering to call ahead. This isn’t a conversation to have over the phone. The cabbie speeds the whole way there, clearly driven by what John can only imagine is a murderous look on his face. John has worked himself into such a mood, that he might have actually kicked Mycroft’s door in if it hadn’t opened just as he reached it.
“Ugg, I hate the floaters,” Lestrade grimaces.
Sherlock is fuming. He can feel the rage shaking his frame and clogging his throat. “I thought you were dead!” he snarls. Because he had, he thought John had either died in Afghanistan or had been captured, anything to explain why he had never returned to London, and here he finds him in America of all places, working on a medical degree.
Lestrade laughs and gives his coat a pointed look, “I doubt you’re
Angelo brings their dinners over with his usual boisterous way. The food is fantastic as always. They eat in companionable silence for a time, a near miracle considering the table contains two Holmeses. The food is filling and they all wind up with takeaway boxes, but agree to dessert as well because even Sherlock can’t turn down Angelo’s Tiramisu.
“It will have to be,” Sherlock murmurs, rubbing at his marks, which has started to give off heat like a sunburn.
Sherlock was just starring at him, eyes huge and mouth parted. He looked like someone had just bashed him in the head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I managed to convince the manager that one of his employees was stealing from the till every night. Once the man was confronted he quickly confessed. These were a gesture of gratitude,” Mycroft answers, offering up a fork.
Sherlock, who is still wearing the same pajamas from this morning, scoffs. “You didn’t solve the case.”
John’s attention is turned to Mycroft, which is why he doesn’t immediately recognize the danger. There is something in the air, a stillness that makes him look up. A hundred yards away is a man, but something about him isn’t right, something in his stance or in his aura. John has an instant to note the gun in his hands before he is shoving Mycroft away.
Don is not taken. He has spent the time trailing in and out of consciousness and makes little sense when he can speak. John is getting more worried about him.
“Enough,” Gabriel shouts, when the mass of beasts has finally lessoned. They only ooze along the edges of the cave now, sluggish, but still screeching. She leaps into the fray, wings and blades spinning in a deadly dance.
Hamish spent the first hour of his time off, going back to sleep. He was exhausted, and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. He must have been very tired, because he didn’t wake up when Jim left for the day.
John walks up to him with a slow sort of trudge.
“You shouldn’t be here,” Lestrade says flatly.
“I can’t believe that worked,” John gasps staring at the space Balor had been. The demon is gone, only the dead grass shows that he had ever been there.
Spreading from the scratch are lines of black.
“Right, yes,” Stapleton pulls her gaze away. “Animals don’t have soul bonds, obviously, but this poision works on a neurological level, so they can still be used to produce an antidote in the same way we synthesize snake and spider antivenom.” She gathers up the sample she took from the hound, a transfer pipet, and a small syringe.
“Bill,” John called, trying to reach out, but his shoulders were stiff.
Sherlock scowls, “Zhi Zu will be with the General, you’ll need back up.”
He comes back to himself when Lestrade wakes up. The man does not do mornings. He comes awake in a grumble, slapping at his alarm clock as if it has offended him. He does not step out of bed, so much as roll off the side. It is rather humorous to watch actually.
“Because I have something you want,” Irene purred, eyes alight with the thrill of baiting the Holmes brothers. “Jimmy-boy is not done with you yet, I imagine you will appreciate a leg up on the consulting criminal that would threaten your Dear John.”
“Well then,” the other man offers a wry grin to Mycroft and Greg as he steps into the room, “this should be interesting.”
“I still don’t get why he showed up at the house. It seemed like he used his own form of deduction. Was he just gathering information?” John looked intently at the image of Sebastian.
“Ah good watta seal down by tha riva’ll do. Make ‘im mad as hell, tho.” The King flutters down, gripping the loaf in his claws. He flies off without so much as a wave.
I'm sorry this took so long, school started up again. I know some people are going to be made about this ending, but you have to remember that this is a oneshot, and for once I wanted an ending that left them with promise but not a guaranteed happy ever after.
John glances over at Mycroft in his bespoke dress clothes, his severe posture. He looks unaffected by it all, by the attention, even the heat. John relaxes by increments, letting his shoulders fall back, his wings loosening until they rest in a graceful arch. He looks out to the bay, to the sparkling waters and the stunning architecture, and shuts out everything else.
“I really wouldn’t. Moriarty I presume.”
“You should have told me,” John says, startling Sherlock as he appears at his side.
“Good job,” Lestrade wheezes. He takes a couple of centering breaths before cleaning his blade on his already ruined trousers.
Irene smirked, stepping back and sinking into the plush chair behind her. “Well, let’s just say I specialize in knowing what people like.” She placed a finger to her lips, revealing the level four bond on her arm. The color was a soft peach, barely visible.
Chapter Nine: A Fan
His wings flinch. “Hey,” he says, turning to face Mycroft.
The drive to Cornwall is a long one, made even longer when he gets stuck in the endless London traffic. Finally, after sun has long set, he pulls down Sherlock’s street, following his GPS. He’s led to a traditional Cornwall home; old, two-story brick with ivy climbing up the sides. There is a beautiful sun room at the front of the house, large glass windows revealing the rows of plants along the sills. It’s hard to believe that such a normal, if posh, building could be where Sherlock calls home.
The man doesn’t notice him, until John has his arm around his throat and is pulling him away from Helios.
Sherlock jerks at the shout, finger pulling away from the trigger. “Lestrade,” he growls, turning to find the police officer standing in the doorway, looking wide-eyed and frazzled.
Sherlock can’t spot John’s soul metal, but the boy is probably smart enough to keep it safely tucked away.
“He’s not,” John growls, teeth gritted.
They gave him a pension, a dank bedsit, and a haughty therapist. John lasted two months before he moved to the streets.
“Did you now? I don’t suppose you’re any good with a gun?”
“You must be John,” Lestrade grins, beyond pleased to see the man he has never met.
Sherlock points down one of the tunnels, it looks like any of the others; dark, smelly, and dripping with questionable fluids. “I paid off a few homeless. The Golem isn’t staying with it’s master and something that large isn’t going to be wandering out in the open or you would have heard about it. One of the people I questioned said they saw the Golem down here a few hours ago. I found prints in the mud down that tunnel that confirms her story. It hasn’t gotten far.”
“What do you mean about that?’ John asked. Moran seemed to be playing them all.
Sherlock stands nervously to the side, hands shoved in his pockets to keep himself from fidgeting. The arm that is revealed when they strip off John’s shirt probably looks worse than it actually is. Dried blood covers his skin, flecks fluttering to the ground when Stapleton starts looking at the gash.
“Which means lots of enemies, and lots of motive,” Lestrade sighs. He walks over to the window looking out at the pen and shuts the blinds.
“The man on the intercom mentioned poison and our bond. What exactly are we dealing with?” John barks.
“Let me buy you a cuppa,” Greg blurts before his brain and mouth can have a good talk about impulses.
“Mine was,” Lestrade paused, glancing at his bond mate, “ Mine was nothing like that. I caught a scent of tea and tobacco, then a flash of the sign in front of the Diogenes club, and then a single glance of Mycroft’s face. That was it, mere seconds.”
“No!” Sherlock practically shouts, and then softer, “no.”
The intercom buzzes, the Captain telling them they are about to land. Not long after, the plane comes to a stuttering halt. Mycroft is grateful they get off first, his legs are stiff and he has zero interest in fighting in the usual mad dash to get off the plane.
He expects to find Henry and Sherlock downstairs, but instead of Henry, Sherlock is sitting with Detective Lestrade.   “Detective,” John greets, surprised.
On a side note, has anyone watched the movie Young Sherlock Holmes. Its old and kinda derby, but it has Sherlock and John meeting in school, having a case, and suggests that they meet again as adults. Its kinda cute, because its Sherlock that makes John braver. There are some other things that are odd, but I like the idea of them meeting as kids and then meeting again as adults.
“The MET are the biggest idiots, the lot of them.” Sherlock tells them about the cases, the sewers, the golem, and discovering that he he had been staying with an angel. By the time he is done, he’s thirsty, his face has gone numb, and his legs have fallen asleep.
Sherlock pauses, giving the man an incredulous look. He hadn’t even noticed he was gone? He doesn’t know why he is surprised. Mr. Hawthorne’s concerns have only ever been for the estate and that Sherlock was still breathing. Sherlock shakes his head, “I’ll take dinner in my room.”
“Don’t,” Sherlock mutters, holding his hand over the watch.
The estate was a sniper’s dream. It sat in a picturesque valley, surrounded by old trees. Hamish settled behind a boulder and bush, covered with a mix of camo blanket and leaves. He was 800 yards from his target, but had easy view of the patio in his scope. The systematic searching of the guards made avoiding them easy.
“Not too bad,” Bill shakes his head, “Maybe twice a week, she’s mostly just nauseous and suddenly has an intense hatred for curry, which I really hope goes away soon.”
“Quaint,” he comments, stepping from the jeep and looking over the Inn. It’s a small building done in  brick and stone with a pub on the ground floor. It looks like something from the telly.
Sherlock and Lestrade on the case.
“Yes,” Mycroft answers, pride sneaking into his tone as he hands his book over. The seal has the same triangle base as the Nile Seal, but the water runes have been altered to better suit the environment of the Hudson River. The small rune work that sets the base of the spell has been altered as well. The Nile Seal used the Egyptian style of the time. Mycroft replaced it with latin.
Sherlock gives Mrs. Hudson a long look, before nodding. “Alright,” he turns to Lestrade, “do it.”
John barely glances at it as he shrugs into his coat, the familiar weight in the pocket comforting. He does a double-take when one of the words scrolling past catches his attention. “Bollocks.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock asks and John feels a brush of heat against his mind that feels a lot like arousal.
The next day, he cannot bear a single moment longer inside the compound. John steps from the room that has become his cell, and seeks out Agent Smith.
“Don’t worry, I’m an excellent doctor,” Hamish patted his shoulder. To be safe, he prepped a bag of whole blood and injected a stronger local.
“I have a case!” Sherlock shouts, kicking the hotel door open with a bang.
Sherlock doesn’t deign that with an answer. He pulls the mark to him, twisting it into a less dangerous shape. It burns into his palm, the skin blistering as it sinks into place. Sherlock winces, fingers spasming.
“No,” Sherlock says before taking a large bite of his custard. “We have very different ideas of interesting,” Sherlock stabs his fork at Mycroft, a bit of Tiramisu still clinging to the end.
“Be ready, it won’t hold long,” Mycroft’s arms are shaking from the strain. “Don’t miss.”
“I’m not needed?” John asks.
Greg had immediately invited them to stay at his flat, an offer Sherlock suspects Mycroft never would have taken if he didn’t have his little brother to think of. As it was, they wound up going to Greg’s flat. Its practically a shoebox, but it has a comfy couch, running water, and a roof that doesn’t leak.
James tucks his body, spinning around the ring and landing with a flare of his wings. The showoff. “John isn’t hearing his bell Uriel, he just has a head cold.”
“Dr. Frankland,” Corporal Lyons greets, “this is Mr. Holmes and Captain Watson.”
Lestrade and Sherlock catch a new case and not everything is how it seems.
John had darted quickly behind a pillar when he heard the exclamation. Even older and much deeper, he would recognize Sherlock’s voice. He must be eighteen now, it’s so strange to see the skinny youth from before has now turned into a lanky teen.
A Devas is what I figured would be the Hindu equivalent of an angel, they are similar to demigods as far as I understood.
“You might be right,” Lestrade hums, taking a closer look at the knife and gun.
“Sally!” he greets with a broad smile, holding out the other cup like a shield. He can always judge her mood by the tightness of her bun, this is a defcon 2.
The man sniffles, tears and snot running down his face. “He’ll kill her. He’ll kill her for good.”
Energy Perception: 96%
The Guardian lowers it’s head, close enough they can smell the stench of rotting fish and seaweed from his open mouth. His warm breath wafts over them and John struggles not to lose his nonexistent breakfast.
“I do, I do my dear, but do you think he will talk?”
When it was all over, the strange connection that seemed to have held Sherlock in stasis released. It was like coming up for air after drowning. He gasped to life, struggling to his feet as he shook the tension from his limbs.
“Oh no, are you alright dear?” Mrs. Hudson worries, he can feel her at his side, still attuned to her unique aura. There is still that air of familiar comfort about her. He takes a deep breath before opening his eyes again.
Lestrade steps closer to get a better look. The ticket is a stub for the National Antiquities Museum. The other objects are a teacup, the crack on the side most likely from when Lestrade stabbed it, and a lucky cat. He stares at the white cat statue - paw still rocking - he’s seen tons of them in Chinatown.  “You’re right,” he hums, “these are unusual.”
“This is…” Mycroft placed the band down and ran his hand through his hair, looking as close to ruffled as John has seen him. “This is highly irregular. The man now known as Sebastian is not one of the very few people allowed access to this technology.”
“He certainly took cheating too seriously,” he drawled.
“What happened? What was that?” Sherlock growls. He has his hands over his heart, clenching at the material of his shirt.
“Yeah,” Lestrade nods, “they would have noted it when he was processed. Let me make a call.” He makes a series of calls as they make their way back to Mycroft’s house, sounding more and more frustrated as he slogs through the bureaucratic nightmare. He is parking the car when he finally pulls his phone away. He sits in silence, staring blankly at the dark screen.
He returns to his bed, even more frustrated. He needs answers and second hand research isn’t an option. That leaves personal experience. He needs to see his aura.
They are interrupted by a security officer bursting into the office. “I’m sorry to burst in, sir, but there’s been an incident with your brother.”
“Mycroft!” John shoots, kneeling at his side. “What did they do to you?” he breathes, hesitant to touch. His face is bruised and swollen, black curse lines slithering beneath the surface.
(See the end of the chapter for
Lestrade gulped. Kid’s daemons could do amazing things; sometimes they changed into something that could protect their charge. He knew that children that suffered trauma usually had daemon’s that settled early. But John was so young, could hardly be four or five and his daemon had more then changed to protect him. She had shifted into a giant beast and had burned the threat to cinders. Helios looked about 2 meters long and a meter and a half high. Her wings stretched even longer, held high around her charge like a shield.
(See the end of the chapter for
No, The Woman was in his bed.
In the end, it was the sixth man that got them. Pulling up late behind his comrades, a sixth man rose over the hill as the Captain was distracted pulling the wounded into a fireman’s carry.  He aimed his AK-47 and shot.
The next day, Bauza pulls him aside, the man is huge, a mass of muscles and scars. He barely ever speaks and he honestly petrifies John, but he has surprisingly gentle eyes. “Here,” he says handing over a M9 handgun.
“What…” John gulps, throat complaining, “What happened?”
“She’s a good girl, strong,” Bauza comments.
Jim jerks back, completely forgetting his gun as he stumbles away. His gaze on the fallen form of his mate is wide and uncomprehending. He looks like a lost child, he turns to John. “You…” He gasps.
Irene looked skeptical about the whole thing.
John blinked at the words, confused as the darkness shifted into Vision.
“Hey, how’s the case going?” Lestrade asks, waving them over.
While some of the patch designs I listed are made up, the unit patch with the arching cat, actually exists. It has belonged to the 81st infantry division since WWI, though currently belongs to a reserve unit. My unit patch was actually the sword and shield I gave to Ruiz. The shear variety of patches has always been interesting to me.
“It means, the game is on.”
“Yes, well.”
“Oh,” Sherlock peered at his brother, sly. “Then getting rid of him should be a service to the crown. You always say I should be more civil minded.”
Flustered, Hamish stands and started pacing along the far wall, suddenly looking very much like Sherlock. “I am, sort of. John was my biological parent anyways, I barely remember him. I was raised by Sherlock.”
Sherlock may not have his brother’s gift for energy perception, but he can shift his gaze easily enough. Soo Lin has an aura of rolling greens and browns, a natural earth sorcerer, but there is a smudge of black near her feet. “No, I rather think you are being blackmailed.”
John tried to rein in his thoughts, but judging by the sharp anger coming from Sherlock’s end, he didn’t do a very good job of it.  John offered a wry grin in apology, he couldn’t help it; he wasn’t 3-Continents Watson for nothing.
Sherlock’s stomach is full and he is mostly warm, so he drops easily into to sleep, but his dreams are restless, filled with gunshots and desert heat.
John picked up on the movement, and guessed that’s what he and Sherlock looked like when they ‘talked’.
He has to shove his shoulder into the door to force it open. The wood is heavy, taking all his strength to move. The room is pitch black, the darkness like its own entity. John casts a light spell, casting the cavern in a golden glow.
Lestrade hides a laugh behind a cough.
He looks down, startled. The chain must have come loose in the fight, now his ring sits in the middle of his chest, looking small and harmless despite it’s importance. “Thanks,” he murmurs, and tucks it back in his shirt. “You should go, the police will be here soon.”
James shakes his head, and John feels feathers run along his arm, though James doesn’t fully manifest. “You always were a terrible liar.”
Sherlock dodges around a three foot span of macaw wings and then a 6 foot set of peregrine falcon wings trailing a ruffled sergeant. At the end of the hallway he dips into the lab. Sgt. Hunt is behind the computer, he looks busy, but really he’s playing Candy Crush on Facebook.
While Mycroft is focused on the arms, their tail lashes out, curling around his legs and dragging him to the ground. His head slams into the stone, sending spots across his vision.
Hong Kong glows with ancient magicks and Mycroft finds himself squinting, despite the smog laying heavy over the city. He has to force his senses back, pushing them into a cramped corner of his mind until he is all but blind to the spectral planes.
“I was told you have a patient ready for this, what did you expect me do, eat it?”
Her lips twitch, “He also happens to be with your...Holmes.”
It is oddly beautiful, his aura. Sherlock is not sure what he expected, but it was not this display of blue flame. There is a spark of something where the flames are the thickest, right in front of his heart. He narrows his eyes, bringing a sharp pain, which he ignores. The shadowed area, a deep-dark blue like the night sky, seems to thicken under his gaze, but gives way after some prodding.
It was Anthea that finally brought the information.
Sherlock looks up to see Bruiser right in front of him. Bruiser is just shy of seventeen, and his recent puberty has left him with powerful muscles made lean and dangerous living on the streets. The boy had warned him off of the park after realizing how much money Sherlock could collect, even though the idiot couldn’t play an instrument if his life depended on it.
In the following hours, Mycroft loses himself in study. He flips back and forth through the book and fills page after page of another book with his notes. Finally, he sits back with a sigh.
The source of the clapping comes from behind them. Agent Smith is leaning against a tree at the edge of the woodline. “I give you boys points for style, no one has ever tried something so idiotic before.”
“I did not lie. Caring is not an advantage, but Gregory is… Avoiding the bond after the Vision was not possible,” Mycroft attempted to look contrite, but Sherlock could see the ease of the lines around his face, he was happy.
He resisted the urge to curse; of course he shouldn’t have known her name or profession. Irene Adler was hardly the sort of woman a poor Army Doctor would run across. “I’ve heard whispers, it wasn’t a difficult leap,” he said, trying on the arrogant scoff his father was fond of.
Lestrade sends, not taking his eyes from the news,
Hudson River hums, a sound like a fog horn. “I suppose I won’t eat you, or your brave little fledgling.” His eyes narrow to slits. “I will listen for further news, the whole of the world visits my shores. If I hear of who threatens the balance I will send the Pigeon King or one of his kin.”
“I thought… I was certain they were going to kill us, or sell us. The Irish man asked the blond what he wanted to do with us. I thought he was going to… I thought he was going to hurt us too, but the blond made him promise to send us home. I didn’t believe it until the bodyguards dropped us off at the police station. Just like that, they didn’t even touch us.”
, where Sherlock is.
“We’ll have to vacate for a few hours. Mycroft’s men will be dealing with the clean up. Perhaps a wipe down for you, John,” Sherlock said, indicating the arterial splatter John had attained across his chest and face. “We shall continue the search at St. Bart’s they have an acceptable computer lab.”
Pete pours him a pint without needing to ask, handing over the large glass filled with dark lager. “Howya been mate, haven’t seen you in ages?”
Like his own information, John and Murray disappeared from the hospital, but attached was Murray's Leave Request Form for 30 days to aid in a shared Vision search.
He tries to call out to him, but his voice only comes out as a wheeze.
The sound of his fist connecting with the alarm clock is immensely satisfying. He goes back to sleep.
Sherlock doesn’t even glance at her, his gaze fixed on the boy.
“See, you’ll both be fine! Can we finally stop harrowing off into trouble without backup?” Lestrade snarks from his place on the far side of the room.
“I haven’t the faintest, but it must be important if Moran thinks it will secure Mycroft’s assistance,” Sherlock answered, still fiddling with the strap.
John spreads his wings, throwing himself into the air. It’s the worst pain he’s ever felt, even worse than being on fire a moment ago. His left shoulder is screaming and his left wing won’t bend properly. There is muscle and bone damage, magic structural damage, and a good chunk of feathers missing. He ignores it all.
John is slammed into the ground, wings pinned for the second time, claws prick at the sensitive undersides and he thinks that Mycroft went through all that trouble just for John to die anyways. The thought makes him angry, furious! He hasn’t even found his One yet.
“We both no that’s not true, don’t we. Its just not here, yet.”
The army had went in and saved the kids, all of them getting quickly adopted, the public moved by their story. Sherlock had known a few were in London, but he hadn’t expected to ever meet one. No wonder Bruiser had been terrified.
“Might be,” Sherlock bristles.
“Come on,” John nudges him with his elbow.
“Alright,” Lestrade glares, “let me try that again. Where is your house?”
“Well you’re not one to let your injuries rest when they should. Don’t think I don’t remember how you were after getting shot,” Murray gripes, waggling his finger at John like one would a child.
Lestrade and Sally stand unobtrusively at the back of the small room, but Sherlock can feel their gazes on his back. Mycroft, his usual nosy self, stands at his side with a small notebook and pen. As if he didn’t have eidetic memory.
“That is everything for now, all the other essentials; tickets, mission, and funds will come from Agent Smith or Agent Moneypenny,” Q says, ineffectively pulling the mess of papers on his desk into a pile.
Sally glares. “I imagine that the tea is just bad inventory, but it was on my list.”
Gary grins swats his mate’s arm playfully, “Well then.” The two turn identical looks on Lestrade.
“How did you?” John blinks. He stands back up, his own wings held in challenge.
“Got anything?” Lestrade asked, pulling out his notepad in preparation.
He flares his wings out, making his slight form look much larger. “You’re not mine,” he states clearly, “But I think I’ll keep you.” John turns to Agent Smith, curling one of his wings around the man. “He isn’t my One, but someday he’ll lead me to them. I will become his guardian until that day.”
Mycroft stumbles back, he looks over at John and they share a horrified look. This was a terrible plan.
Every morning he woke to the near constant London drizzle and felt his leg and shoulder ache. He allowed himself ten minutes of indulging in the pain before he ventured out for food.
“That’s amazing,” John grins, whole face lighting up with amazement.
“Not quite, “ John says, but doesn’t clarify. “Hey I saw some signs while we were driving up, skull and crossbones?”
“Water demons, “ Mycroft coughs, his hands are shaking and he feels jittery all over. The spell had been more draining than he expected, he feels tired and wrung-out. “A powerful lightning spell will bounce  from demon to demon when they swarm like that.”
“Yes, Sir,” She nods and holds up the tray for Sherlock, “Please drink the entire vial in one go. Wait five minutes and then enter the Visionary.”
Henry jolts, curling his arms around his chest like he expects to be hit. “M..M..Mr. H..H..Holmes,” he greets, shoulders shaking.
“It would be for Queen and Country,” Mycroft adds, giving the fork a disdainful look.
It was then, that Sherlock decided he had no wish to have his ‘Vision’ or find his soul mate.
“I don’t appreciate young-blood idiots at my table, certainly not cheaters,” Moran was on him, not an ounce of military quickness lost since his discharge. He slammed Hamish into the wall, holding him with his forearm and banishing the knife with the other.
“I’ll have all the proof Mrs. Hudson needs if I can just find…” Sherlock murmurs, dashing off the trail and into the swampland.
There was an echo on the tile as Moriarty fled.
“Of course I did!” Sherlock snaps, pulling the cord over his head. “Perhaps it is time you keep it,” he tosses the whole thing at John.
With his wing separating the bulk of the fiery aura, he can get to the center of Sherlock’s bonds. His center is weirdly shadowed, part of it hidden in darkness. He wants to poke at it, but he senses no malevolence and there is no time. He is surprised to only find two bonds in the familia circle, Sherlock’s blue bonded with an crystalline violet that Lestrade immediately knows belongs to Mycroft.
John knows how important Sherlock is to Mycroft, knows that if the mage were to rank everything in his life by importance, that his little brother would sit at the very top. It is an honor and in many ways an apology. Instead of answering outright, John offers him a tired grin, “You owe me a new jumper.”
Six months later...
“He’s here,” Mycroft announces. He stops at John’s right side, setting the brolly in front of him.
“What’s wrong?” Mycroft asks and there is honest concern there.
She gave a coy wink, “My guard is always up, don’t fret, Love.”
Lestrade nods, “I am, but I can’t let my anger rule how I approach this. It won’t help her and it won’t help solve this case.”
John can see Mycroft stiffen, tension straining across his shoulders. He leans forward, turning that attention to him and trying to ease it. “Brother?”
He came back to the helicopter screaming. “Sherlock!”
Sherlock grits his teeth, “For now. Though the mixture and the circle were the components of a class 10 summoning, possibly higher.”
Lestrade looked up, startled. There was a man a few feet in front of him, Christ, he hadn’t heard a sound. The man was tall, dressed to the nines in a sharp coat and suit, and looked like he had stepped out of a magazine. “Sir, you shouldn’t be back here,” Lestrade scowled.
He pushed Moran away, the ex-sniper falling like a sack.
Research showed that 98% of the population had a soul mate, even if 10% died before ever meeting them. To find their given soul mate, a person must first have their ‘Vision’. The ‘Vision’ aids in finding the person and once first touch is established, the soul mark forms.
John, on the other hand, was devastated to learn that angels experience puberty in a manner quite similar to humans, and has been avoiding speaking until his own voice stops cracking at inopportune times. It doesn’t help that he also lives with James, who came out the other end of puberty with a voice like cool steel. Still, he gives a little cough and says, “It’s nothing, just ringing in my ears.” His voice comes out relatively normal, it is the words that make him wince.
Sherlock steps back, knocking into the door frame in his rush.
Mycroft follows in his own bow, balancing over the point of his brolly. The ash wood of the handle hums in his palm, soaking up the excess energy from the Guardian’s glow. “Tianlong, you honour us with your presence.”
Lestrade huffs, tossing a pillow at his head. “Go to sleep, we have an early morning of crime solving ahead of us.”
The boy’s brow scrunches in confusion, “Kandahar, how did you…?”
It is only in the interrogation room that the man admits to killing his sister’s mate, an abusive asshole apparently. Unfortunately, the bond was still strong enough to result in the death of his sister. The brother had not known about her death and ended up in tears, poor sod. When Lestrade wrote up the case he recommended leniency from the judge.
The drive is jolting and painful, even more so with his wings crammed behind him and bent out of shape. The adrenaline of the change drops as dramatically as it had come. He feels drained, head drooping even as the car rattles his bones.
Hijra is this story is being used as a pronoun if that confused you. It is an Indian term for the third gender.
“I can hear you,” Sherlock whispers in his ear.
The chain continues to Murray who tries to leap out of the way. Bauza, quick despite his size, bodily lifts John and tosses him out of harm’s way. Unfortunately, the chain is more than just an explosive charge, the air thickens with gas, clogging their lungs and forcing sedatives through their bloodstream.
Hamish watched her slip into her dress; she was as difficult to read as he remembered. “I’ve been beaten often enough, I have no urge to have it done recreationally.” He knew he was giving too much away, Irene did not need to know these things, and he still wasn’t certain why Jim sent her.
“First office on the right,” the woman says, never looking up from her phone.
They were led to a flat in a rough part of town, though the flat itself was probably one of the best looking buildings in the area. Various clues showed the Libyans had moved in quickly, evicting the last gang and moving in with force. There was a spatter of gunshot by the front door that must have been a result of the eviction.
