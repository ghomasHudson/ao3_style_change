As soon as the two men were out of sight Steve opened his book and quickly became engrossed, barely noticing the mess hall emptying around him until one of the members of the cleanup crew tapped him on the shoulder.
"Shh, my love," Steve whispered as his lips closed over Tony's, the pleasure that had been lapping at him like the warm waves of the Mediterranean suddenly spiking as their tongues met and danced together, condensing into a tight ball deep inside his gut when Tony nipped at his bottom lip. Tony's free hand dropped from Steve's back to try and sneak between their bodies but Steve pushed it away, wrapping his own fingers around Tony's erection and stroking him in time with his thrusts.
"Mmm," Tony groaned as tears welled in his exhausted brown eyes. "But he's still out?"
Peter gave a somber nod as he gave Steve one final squeeze before crawling into his bed, burrowing down into his fluffy blankets. "I just couldn't sleep until I knew what was going on."
And then, the pure joy on Peter’s face as he proceeded to introduce his father to Steve, like he had been actually looking forward to it.
Steve smiled at Tony's forethought as he opened the drawer, finding the small bottle Tony had stashed there. For as how often as they were intimate, Steve was still hesitant sometimes to—as Tony liked to put it—fuck him, nervous that he would somehow hurt him, and thankfully Tony didn't push him to do so more often than he felt comfortable.
As is Tony.  Like, almost embarrassingly so.
"Hey, Stevie!" Bucky called from across the room, sitting across from Sam and waving like a dummy. "'Bout time you showed up!"
"You first," Steve stated as he snaked one hand between them to curl around Tony's cock, trapped between their bellies. Tony's back arched up as Steve stroked him just the way he knew Tony liked, the pleasure coiling in his gut so suddenly and so intensely that his climax hit him almost out of nowhere. He cried out as the heat consumed his body, his fingernails digging into Steve's shoulders as Steve sped up his thrusts, chasing his own release.
“I know you love me, Papa.  You tell me and show me every single day,” Peter said again.  “And I love you too, which is why I want you to be free of this!  Uncle Sam’s always saying that if you can take the obstacles sitting in the way of your recovery away, that you should do it, and this is the biggest one!  And I know you can do it, Papa, I know you can!”
"And since you guys had to ask, I have no idea how it worked," Quill went on. "All I know is that after I was born, Ego made my mom sick until she died. So I killed him."
And yet, ever since Steve saw Bucky standing there on that bridge in D.C. and realised that he was the elusive Winter Soldier they'd been searching for, Tony has stood by Steve’s side, promising to give him whatever help he needed to find him.  Tony was there when the helicarriers came rising out from beneath the Potomac River and began their ascent.  He was there, duking it out with the HYDRA agents as they fought to replace the carrier control chips so millions of innocent people didn’t lose their lives.
“So… do you think this time will work out okay for you guys?” he finally asks.  “I know Peter mentioned something about it maybe being a bit tight, so—”
"Colonel? Do you know the kid I'm talking about?" he asked.
His good mood completely gone, Tony dropped down into his car and slammed the door, revving the engine just a bit too much as he peeled out of the garage and onto the street.  His “talk” with Obie had cost him almost ten minutes, meaning that the possibility of finding Peter with bites taken out of his own arms had just increased exponentially.  The kid had been so hungry lately it was like watching a human tornado every time they sat down to eat, which could only mean that another growth spurt was brewing.
Peter watched as Dad's jaw twitched, his fists clenching and unclenching as he tried to hold onto his temper.
"I know, Peter. I really like you too."
"Hey, what was that?" asked Peter. "Are you okay?"
"It doesn't," Tony said quickly. "But in some of the uber-rich circles people still tend to look down on it, and would be… less than enthusiastic about voting for a presidential candidate with an openly gay son. And this dude's wife likes to rub elbows in those circles, and they tend to donate pretty generously to campaign funds, so…"
"Mitchell here."
"The whole team would decide," Peter said. "My papa is the Captain, but something like that they would all decide on together, as a team. That's how they work."
"Good," said Steve. "Now, as soon as JARVIS has completed your travel arrangements, you can be on your way."
"Mmm," said Peter. "You know, it's okay to be sad about your husband, but why didn't you ever tell Papa any of this? Don't you think he'd wanna know?"
As long as he could believe that Tony and Peter were okay, Steve knew he could handle anything that HYDRA wanted to throw at him.
"I'm sure he thinks that you did, mo grá," Steve said. "And I'm just glad I was there to witness it."
They were quiet until Peter saw Papa's truck pulling into the parking lot, followed directly by Ned's mother.
Steve will have to remember to ask Ma if she recorded the race so he can hear the commentary for himself.
"And would it?" asked Steve. "Make him valuable?"
Watching Peter step through a magical portal from another planet, along with all of the others who had been snapped with him, just like it had never even happened.
"All right, sweetheart," said Steve. "I love you."
“Are you kidding me?”  Tony took Steve’s face into his hands, pressing a hard kiss to his lips.  “Honey, of course it’s okay!  You know I’m not gonna push you, but—”
Tony settled into the driver's seat, starting the car as Happy climbed into the lead car with Clint, Natasha, and Rhodey, with Sam chauffeuring Bucky, Bruce, and Thor in the middle of their caravan.
“Yeah, and Steve’s right,” answers Peter.  “‘Cause I’m already
His cheeks flaming, Peter rested his chin on his tall stack of books for the rest of the fifteen-minute homeroom period, subtly watching the clock so he could brace himself for the shrill ring of the bell. He was out of his seat as soon as it rang, practically sprinting down the hallway towards his physics class with Ned right on his heels, trying to keep up.
"How's Тони doing?" asked Bucky as they stepped into the guests' dining hall, which was set up like a huge buffet. Steve's mouth was watering before he even picked up a plate, the sights and smells of the spiced meats, sweet pastries, and colourful fruits causing his stomach to go into overdrive.
Tony tipped his forehead onto Steve's chest, moaning softly when Steve's palms glided up his back. "Hell no, we're not. The absolute last thing we need is for Senator Davis to start poking that pointy nose of his where it don't belong again, and that's exactly what would happen if Spider-Man suddenly reappeared after vanishing for months."
"In the morning, gotta put in some mingling time first," said Rhodey, jerking his head towards the gaggle of military officials conglomerating over in one of the corners. "I'll let you know if I pick up any gossip."
"What—?"
Tears welled in Tony's eyes, trailing down his cheeks before he could stop them. "This is mostly due to him, Colonel. He's the one who developed the UI, and designed a lot of the hardware, and—"
"Mmm, that's true. He is pretty stubborn."
"You know what, J, nevermind," Tony quickly added. "Just tell me how much longer Steve's gonna be."
Steve thought as he came to an abrupt stop a second or so later, sucking in a deep breath as he took in the scene in front of him.
Tony groaned, rubbing at the sharp crick in his neck from trying to sleep while sitting up. He'd kicked Steve out of the penthouse about an hour ago to go work out with Sam and Clint after he had another one of his bad anxiety attacks, but while he knew it was good for Steve to get out, it meant that Tony was left completely alone with his thoughts, which were not very good company at the moment.
"Sir, I am afraid this data is being protected by several layers of high-level encryption that have yet to be identified."
"No, no, nothing new," Peter said quickly.
“Yeah, till he sent me off to boarding school halfway across the world,” Tony snapped.  “I’ll see ya tomorrow, Obie.”
unbelievable?"
"Yeah, yeah, Sam, sorry," Steve said dismissively, ignoring Sam's skeptical raised eyebrow. "Just… seems like the days are just kinda flying by lately. I mean, I could've sworn it was just a few months ago that Peter was teaching me how to use a credit card, and now all of a sudden I'm teaching him how to drive on the weekends."
“Yes,” he wheezes.  “He’s single.”
Tony leaned back in his chair, a sickenly wide grin spreading across his lips.  He would never admit it out loud, but he absolutely loved that Steve could somehow sense his mood even over the phone.
"Dad's right, little guy," Papa said in his Captain's voice. "The Avengers are a team, which means—"
"Just… patience, I think," Tony murmured. "Which I know isn't your strongest suit, but… I'm thinking you're gonna need quite a bit of it, and enough for the both of us while you're at it. This might take awhile, honey. As much as I'd like to, I can't cut any corners here."
Green circles appeared on the hologram, encompassing most of the New York and Maryland coastlines.
"Hey," Steve asked as they stepped into their gorgeous lofted bedroom, with the floor-to-ceiling windows offering a perfect view of the moonlight shining through the nearby trees. "Are you okay?"
A huge thank-you to all of my awesome friends on the IronDad and SpiderSon Fic Recs Discord server for their help with this chapter!  💖 You guys are wonderful!!
"All right," he said, clearing his throat. "But do we know where this guy is right now? 'Cause Peter is out there at the movies with only Bucky and a few guards as backup, so—"
"Oh, yeah," Peter said as he gulped down the rest of his Dr Pepper. "My Uncle James and I play it together whenever he's in town."
Tomorrow they would try and save the world, so now all Steve wanted was to savour the moment. Savour his gorgeous husband lying naked in his arms as the sweat cooled on their bodies and their heart rates ticked back to normal.
“Better?” Steve murmurs as his arm comes to rest on Tony’s waist.  He should’ve known that they would fit so perfectly together.  Like two lost pieces of the same puzzle.
He only hoped that this time it would survive the journey.
"I can't wait," he murmured.
Tony scoffed, scowling as he remembered the look of pure horror on Obie's face during that fateful press conference when he announced that he was shutting down his weapons manufacturing, and the contrasting look of awe and pride in Peter's innocent brown eyes.
"Copy that! And here goes nothing!" Tony muttered, squeezing his eyes closed as he circled back around and slammed into the ceiling, sending broken shards of concrete and shingles flying as he broke through, followed shortly by three of the Hammer suits.
"Pete, just stop right there, okay? Just… give me a second." Tony sucked in a deep breath, uncurling his fingers from his arm as he tried to figure out how he was supposed to react. Peter had deliberately gone behind he and Steve's backs and messed around with stuff that he had no business messing with, but at the same time he had uncovered some pretty important information about what HYDRA had been trying to accomplish, so while Tony knew that he should punish him, he was honestly so fried at the moment that he could barely think.
He was interrupted from his musings when he was sharply shooked.
“ I want to go over a few things with you. Some, if not all, will be useful as you live here.”
“ They are both being assholes as usual.” Tony snapped. He was irritated at Clint. It was just the situation and to be frank he was over it.
“ No. he just brought me here today.”
“ Sure.”
“ Good idea. I will just wear what’s left of the suit to fly over the border. The trees are heavy enough here so we won’t be easily detected.”
“ Shut Up Sam.” Tony snapped. “ I’m glad you are all enjoying this. Now get me out of here!”
Steve lowered himself and crawled up to Tony until he was curled up behind him. He placed a kissed on his shirt covered shoulder.
Beck raised a perfect eyebrow, “ What? Foil your plans?”
Natasha ignored them both, “ What happened to Bucky?”
They all shook their heads.
“Well what did he say?”
“ I have no panties,” Peter loudly whispered, a mischievous glint in his eyes.
Before Tony could yell at them to stop a thunderous roar erupted in the room along with a bright light. Tony shielded his eyes as he was thrown back into his backside from the force.
“Pepper!” Tony Cried our. He and Natasha quickly grabbed her and rushed out of the area.
“ You have one arm. How are you going to drive?”
That sounded like.... “Barnes?” Tony asked as he turned around.
“ Tony I didn’t  mean any of it. Please let me explain.”
“ Wow, I’m hot!” Tony said as he saw the picture of himself shirtless. It was very detailed.
Peter groaned and threw his head back and Quentin sighed.
Good mood.”
“ Very well, sir.”
Nat rubbed the bridge of her nose with two fingers. “ So much for you being homophobic.”
“ Hey Steve, is you buddy around?”
Peter smiled. “ I’m fine and you?”
It turns out this Tony hadn’t created nanotechnology yet. But that was understandable he wasn’t as awesome as him.
“ He was fine. I had his back.”
“ Where did they go?”
“ Yes, your majesty. I also wanted to see if he was acceptable last night. I can always take him back and give you a full refund.”
Steve began to cut Tony’s waffles for him. He didn’t comment on the fact he was an adult. “ Because you gained 10 pounds and are struggling to keep up with the workout regimen.”
Bucky just huff.
Tony smiled down at the baby. “ We can’t have that now can we? Handsome man such as yourself needs a name.”
“ I’ll happily follow by example, if you lead in that one Stark.”
Most of his brothers were there too. Morgan was 16 and was a spitting image of Tony both personality wise and physically. He was one of the reasons his parents waited so long to have kids. The other reason was not at the table yet. His parents never stated those two were the reason why they waited to have more kids, but it was pretty obvious with the amount of trivial those two caused. The youngest member of the family was Jamie who His had had given birth to just last year. Steve had him in his arms as he started to eat his own food.
Rogers. Ok so he was still pissed. It’s not like Steve should have been surprised. He did break the man’s wrist.
“ Sam is a very capable individual with a unique skill set that is valuable to our team.” Howard huffed as he pulled out his wallet.
Steve smiled. “ Great, it’s still warm so it’s best to eat it now. You can eat it on my floor so you won’t have to worry about cleaning.”
Steve took a step forward, “ Oh shit,” he said before he tumbled forward.
Wade: so what do you want?
“ Tony I’m giving you to the Count of three.”
“ I can come up with some things. I just need some time.”
“ they had to get the inspiration from somewhere.”
Tony glared at him. “ I don’t bitch. These are justifiable complaints. The man in overly controlling. I’m surprise he lets me take a shit without supervision.”
Tony groaned. This was going to be a nightmare.
Bucky strolled in, “ We going out for drinks already?”
Yep. This universe was definitely weird.
“ It’s unnecessary.” Steve snapped.
Where the hell was he?
He probably should have told them that, but he enjoyed the attention they gave him. It was nice. Maybe he could enjoy this for a little while longer.
He threaded his fingers through the blonde locks and forced his head forward and kissed him. He attacked his mouth and used his other hand to brace himself on his shoulders. He licked his bottom lip, earning a surprised gasp and thrusted his tongue inside. He mapped out the inside and encouraged Steves own velvety appendage to play. He grabbed Steve’s hands that he saw failing in his periphery, as if he was unsure what to do with them, on his ass and encouraged him to squeeze it.
“Thanks Karen. Now where were we?”
Steve continued on with his list of updates and began the presentation with Schmidt about global updates and possible leads for current cases. It reminded him a bout of home and that in his own universe, his teammates were probably doing to same thing. Before the meeting ended he excused himself to go to his room. Steve offered to walk him there but he declined. No matter what universe, he was pretty sure where his room would be.
Peter started to laugh. “ Are you really trying to talk dirty?”
The Comm in his ear went off and Natasha broke through the sound waves, “ Clint and I are in position, the doors are being opened now.”
Steve felt his face heat up. This was so embarrassing.
Steve nodded. “ Yeah. Pietro is fast and Wanda does this magic thing.” Steve said as he made some motion with his hands as if he were conjuring a spell.
“ It wasn’t a lifetime movie.”
“ You know why I can’t.”
The minute he walked through the elevator doors of the Tower, Maria had slapped him on the back of the head and dragged him to the couch by his ear.
“ This has got to stop. I don’t care if it makes you sad if I leave, I will pick my friends over you. They are important to me.”
“ Steve it’s alright. You can leave,” Tony said calmly. Steve looked at him in surprise and saw the look on his face. He nodded in understanding, getting the subtle signal. Tony will meet him later in his room. Steve nodded and backed up slowly, reaching the door and backing up and out, closing it slowly.
Tony just watched the interactions between everyone. He needed to observe them, take in their weaknesses and their dynamics.
“ Peter, I really like you and I know this sounds cheesy, but I’ve felt this way about anyone. Please tell me what it is. I swear I’ll change.” Harry pleaded.
“ But this is like team bonding!” Clint whined. Tony noticed he was carrying a leather messenger bag.
Tony wanted to scream. He had been trying to subtly teach Steve to have better sex, but it had been entirely fruitless.  He knew the man was a horny, he was fucking humping a pillow the other night and calling his freaking name. He even continued when he saw Tony awake, he just told him to go back to sleep and continued as if it were no problem at all! How the hell was he supposed to sleep when he basically had someone moaning in his ear? And to make things worse, the man was gaining endurance! Why the hell did he have to gain endurance now that he wasn’t fucking him?! It was a travesty!
Tony smiled at him and nodded.
Peter said bye to Ned as he went to his Chemistry class. It was  one of his many AP classes that he had decided to take this year.. His dad was so excited when he he had told him. Peter smiled at The memory of his dad calling Rhodey and Pepper and the Avengers to tell them what Peter had done. They all smiled and laughed at his father’s exuberance.
“ Stevie was devastated. And ever since then he hasn’t been the same.” Bucky said.
“ See, even the god agrees. And the only reason Banner is agreeing with Nat is because he doesn’t want to sleep on the couch tonight.”
Tony smiled.
Hi everyone! Thanks for your support so far. I am thankful to everyone who has read my stories. I hope to read your comments and please support my other works:)! Also, please leave behind a kudos.
Tony noticed the Brunette was missing an arm. He was definitely  the winter soldier. The man was know today have a indestructible metal arm. How he didn’t see it before was beyond him.
“Tony I will drag you out.”
Tony scoffed.
Steve crawled on top of him and began to pepper his neck with kisses. Bucky made a cooing noise and nuzzled Tony’s cheek.
Tony sighed. “ I’m sorry Pep. I just don’t want him to get too worried. You know how he can get.”
“ If i knew your beautiful face could’ve  shut him up I would have brought him sooner,” Clint quipped.
Peter didn’t mind. He just wanted to
“ Whatcha looking at?”
Yeah, Tony won’t be doing that.
“ So, you’re finally acknowledging  me today?”
“ What the hell?”
Steve shrugged. “ You can interpret it anyway you want.”
Grant obliged and thrusted roughly I to him. Steve covered Tony’s mouth with his own muffling his moans.
“ I didn’t want to be on the team in the first place. You had an ex-Russian spy stalk me until I said yes.”
Tony sighed.
“ Do we all have to be here? I don’t want my son’s wedding night to be a public spectacle.”
They had dropped Bucky and Sam off at some corporate office looking building before driving back home. Tony followed Steve up to the pent house and sat down on the couch were Steve directed him to. He looked warily at the man as he moved around the living room, cleaning. He left for a bit and came back with a laundry basket and began to fold clothes. Steve grabbed the remote and turned it on. Tony began to watch the baking show that was on, trying to distract himself.
“Hey Pep. WHAT?!”
“ Turn the game on, I don’t want to miss kick off,” Clint said as he flopped onto the couch.
Grant held up his hands in a placating fashion. “Sorry, sorry. I have been researching
Rhodey rolled his eyes. “ I told you before, we are-“
“ Yeah, they tried a guy like two weeks later and it was reported the he wasn’t sure what to do.”
Tony made a face. “ Yeah didn’t need to know that.”
Tony looked up to see Sam coming over to the couch to deposit himself on rather ungracefully.
“ Where are we?”
Tony dropped the fish. “ You don’t want the fish? Ok. That’s fine. But I can help you get that thing off your tail. Will you let me.”
“ Mind your language. Didn’t you ever learn not to speak to officers like that?” Steve growled.
They all looked down, seemingly ashamed.
Rhodey cleared his throat. “ I think you better get going Commander. I’ll entertain Tony in the mean time.”
Tony lightly squeezed his crotch earning a sharp gasp.
“ Would you like to repeat that?” Tony said in a soft, but deadly voice.
“ No more than you. At least he graduated from Harvard.” The Red Skull retorted.
“ I’m not into foursome either.”
Great. This is just great.
“ I just... you know... got busy,” Steve said softly.
Sam tracks Steve with her eyes before and he must have apparently been out of earshot when Sam began talking again.
“ Let me go you prick!” Tony growled.
“ That’s what I thought. Now come along. Get dress so we can feed you.”
Steve looked down and shuffled on his feet.
“  I dare you. Return me and you will more than likely go back to celibacy. Kinda sad a king has to pay to get laid.” Tony seethed.
“ That’s what I thought,” Maria said.
“ Steve?”
Steve smiled.
Steve rolled his eyes, “ Well we just need to check...”
The brunette yelped as  the blonde grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and dragged him to what Tony assumed was the kitchen.
Tony sighed at his husbands mini panic attack.
“ No way in hell.”
“ Well Sam really likes that place and I didn’t want to take her anywhere else but that fancy Italian restaurant and besides I knew you were probably cooking.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony smirked down on him. “ Good catch.” He Gave him a small kiss before pulling back.
Peter did truly  love Wade, but why was this so hard?
Hi, short chapter this week as I’ve been busy with work. I will try and make a longer chapter soon.
Winghead continued to ignore him.
“ Manhattan Prep.”
“ Yeah fucking right.”
“ Tony, he needs you. Look at him. He is depressed. You could be what we need to make sure that this guy is fine. “
Steve smiled and stood up and walked toward where the bathtub should be. How he knew it was there Tony had no idea. He could have the ability to smell water for all he knew.
Tony felt his hands travel to his mid back and give it the same treatment.
“ Does it matter?”
Still no response.
“ Tony,” It was Nat. Thank god. She was the brains and brawn of the two, “ I’m going to distract him and draw him away and I want you to run over to barrier and jump it. “
“ It’s not going down.” Steve whined.
“Shit.”
“ Maybe you’re doing it wrong because there is no way that can be Tony.” Clint argued.
“ I’m doing this because I want to now come on.” He licked the cloth and nuzzled it lovingly. He undid the button and-
“ Not a word unless you plan to whisper.”
Steve laughed again. “ You do know you are older then me though right?”
Peter sighed and let his hands lay limp beside his head when Harry began to kiss the sharp edges of his hips.
Tony grimaced. “ Can we just get the clothes first?” He didn’t not want to go shopping with Steve with any of those bastards around. They would be relentless once they saw how Steve cooed and babied him. It was embarrassing really. He treated him like a life size Ken doll when they went out to get clothes or he was making him try new clothes. God that man was an embarrassment to be around.
“ It would be funny though if you got your lard ass stuck up there.”
Strange rolled his eyes.
Tony almost spit of the water he was drinking as he spluttered.
“ Winghead is that you?!”
“ You prepared yourself already?” Steve asked.
“ I can make it feel good. I swear. I read about it.”
“ Since last year,” Wanda said softly.
Tiny glared at her. Ok so the lighting here wasn’t the best. It didn’t mean he had white hair.
“ You’re an incentive. You are here to give that jack ass upstairs a reason to actual do some work. “ Bucky said as he continued to read the file in front of him.
“ I think it’s just a werewolf thing. You acted like that too in the beginnings you were always jealous when Tony was going to visit Rhodey.”
“ My friends and I are going to go get some coffee later today after school at this nice cafe down the street, want to come?”
Apparently none of them had ever imagined him to be a father, but they seemed proud at how good he was at parenting.
Tony felt himself bob on Steve’s dick as Steve began push up and into him fast and hard. Tony whined as he grabbed on to Steve’s chest to prevent himself from following forward.
Three minutes later Wanda game back more appropriately dressed. Steve nodded in approval.
“ Why didn’t you tell us? Why didn’t you tell me?” She cried.
“ Keep going,” Tony Cried when he get Grant stopped. He must have heard him because he then continued to slow enter Tony.
He turned around to began Grants turn. “ Ok. Now open you legs just like that.”
Peter did his best glare.
“ So I’m going to pull out my trusty tool kit. Don’t be so huffy. See it’s nothing bad. Just a little toolkit. See it’s shiny? Want one? You can have the Phillips head. You’re not supposed to chew on it, but I guess that’s fine as well. Woah you have sharp teeth! You just bit that in half.” Tony kept narrating as he worked on the strap. It wasn’t really hard, Fury could have had one if the SHIELD scientist do it, but Fury rather lose him than a SHIELD employee.
“ God damn it Rhodey! It’s not a psychotic break. And before you say anything else, I’m not on drugs. I swear to you there are two of them! Just get your ass over here and help me figure this thing out.”
Tony pouted. “ But think of all the benefits!”
3 minutes later
“ That’s cool.”
Clint just shrugged.
Bruce shook his head. “ I’m afraid he is real. I contacted Reed and just some of the data he had and I was able to Run some additional scans and it seems as if he must be from an Alternate universe. “
Loki rolled his eyes.
“ Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t exactly see a line waiting outside your room every night.”
“ When is it?” Steve asked.
Steve groaned and threw his head back. “ I don’t even want to think about that. As many times as I get called for the twins, I’m surprised I don’t already have a designated area for parking.”
Hi, thanks for all the lovely comments and I hope to continue hearing from you all.
“ You are very stiff. Is this your first massage?  Just tell me if an when you become uncomfortable and I’ll just touch your in a different area.” Sam told Grant. Tony saw him gulp and nod his head and Sam began to work on his shoulders. Steve wasn’t daring any better. The two wimps. It was a massage not a killer robot or Loki.
Tony found Steve in his room, sketch pad and pencil in hand. He didn’t even look up when he walked in. He was sitting on his bed with his knees drawn up, acting as a table. His back was leaning against his headboards
Steve’s laugh tinkled through the room. “ You came here last night after working down in the lab.”
“ Don’t wanna.”
“ So any way,I was wondering if maybe you would like to come,” Harry looked at him hopefully.
Steve gulped as he felt the blood in his body run southward.
“ I’m glad you’re here you know. I thought I’ll never get the chance to be with you. But here you are. I am so very thankful and blessed that you are in my life.”
“ Jesus Christ... lets not repeat any time soon. Preferably never. And I’m pretty sure mom will not appreciate you calling her a bitch.” He panted. War Machine flicked the brunettes nose causing him to wince.
“We kind’ve been together  since I was 14 and he means the world to me. I love him. He is the sweetest guy I have ever met and even though we had our rough patches, we still love each other. I like you, but only as a friend. He is like my Knight and shining armor and I can’t imagine being with anyone else, but him. I’m sorry Harry.”
Winghead puffed out his cheeks and pouted.
Peter: Still hurts though.
Tony sighed as Steve began to lap at it hungrily and suck.
Tiny rolled his eyes. “ You stick you dick in me.”
“ Howard!” Maria chastised. “ Not at the dinner table.”
“ I’m hoping it’ll be nice. The party i mean. The mansion is like super nice. It’s been in my family for generations.”
Just saw Endgame, but dont  worry no spoilers here
“ Jesus Christ I am out for five minutes and you two are playing hide the cannoli? You can use a bedroom you know. And why the fuck do you have to use butter for that?” Clint groaned as he rubbed his head.
Tony used his legs to grip Steve’s waist as he brought up his arms to wrap them around steve, pulling him in close. Steve grunted and clawed are the bedding like some wild animal. Tony knee steve had to be getting close as he got more feral as his organism neared.
“ someone put salt in his Starbucks or moved his stapler. I don’t know. Who the fuck knows at this point. The important thing is that he is pissed off and i don’t want to deal with him today.”
“ No!” He whined and pulled his foot back.
Steve smirked. “ Maybe there’s a way you can change that.” Steve kissed Iron Man again.
Bruce face lit up when he saw Sam. “ Now he is a licensed therapist. “
It was a long week. He had a lot of shit to do. He needed to
Steve smiled and shook his head.
Sam nodded. “ Ok so I understand that Grants and Steve’s behavior is upsetting you. They have been fighting a lot and you feel like it’s getting out of control.”
Peter shook his head and smiled. “ You are going to get in trouble again.”
Rhodey looked alarmed. “ What did that idiot do now?”
Back.
“ Right,  so I’m just going to use the bathroom real quick.”
Tony scrunched his forehead and was about to question her when she placed a hand over his mouth.
“ Oh hush my bambino you are such a mess,” Maria chastised.
“ Maria, dear, this is Peggy. I told you about her before. She’s  a brilliant woman. And Peg this is my wife Maria. Don’t look so shocked. Of course I got married! Maria is the love of my life and I am including my car collection you sea witch! How could you write that? Of course I love her. Makes the best lasagna...”
Steve chuckled, “Come on, let’s go to the bedroom. I don’t want anyone walking in one us.” Tony smiled and raced toward his room.
“ Steve, come on. Do you even want me?”
Morgan was constantly dreaming and thinking of this man. He noticed how he would stare at him like is dad did to his poppa.
Steve hummed as he continued to stir the Mac and cheese, the glare not affecting him one bit. He was finally glad he had him, his one and only true love.
“ Tony,” Steve said sternly, “ It’s not good to kill.”
Tony didn’t comment.
“ I didn’t forget you,” Tony said and grabbed him by his hair, pulling him in for a sloppy kiss.
“ Fine, I’ll do it,” He groaned.
Peter looked at Harry.
“ And I made the barbecued pulled pork, coleslaw, carrot soufflé and I have an apple pie in the oven.” Steve said.
“ Yes. Coulson even tried playing some of the games you play with Winghead but he prefers you instead. He got out again today and went to the kitchen to try and steal that chocolate cake you like.”
Tony chuckled. “ Does that line ever work?”
Beck sighed. “ Pete...babe... come on we really don’t have to do that.”
“ You know what... I think I have something to do. Yep that’s it. So... bye.” With that Sam sprinted out of the room.
Bruce brought up a hologram of the pen. The creature was currently singing a melancholic melody. “ We just found him beached with that Hydra equipment on him. We have established a few things though. His-“
Everyone in the room stared at Tony and gave him a deadpanned look.
“ They promised to save Bucky. I noticed in this universe he fell off a train. I know this because I have researched everyone of you throughly. Even you. Please tell me, do you rather me  call you Natalie or Natasha?”
“ See Stevie?”
Peter turned to see Bucky next to him.
“ Ma’m she should be here soon.” Jarvis said calmly.
Steve groaned loudly as his hips drilled and he came into Tony. His cock swelled and plugged itself comfortably into Tony’s  hole. He rolled over and pulled Tony with him. He nuzzled into Tony neck and inhaled loudly before he began to snore. It was so quick in session that Tony wasn’t sure when the inhaling stopped and the snoring began.
“ I can help.” Tony said as he dropped to his knees. Maybe he can get some answers out of Steve this way.
Steve pulled back the curtains to reveal the empty room.
“ Fine whatever. Just fuck me.”
“Ta-da!” Peter squealed in delight as he Landry perfectly on his feet.
Tony was at the side of the enclosure when Winghead emerged, hauling his torso over the railing. He gave a small whine and looked pleadingly at Tony.
Tony just wanted to have sex.
Tony nodded, his eyes addled with lust.
“ That doesn’t make it a lifetime movie.”
“ Jesus Christ Stevie if that asshole has done anything to ya...” Bucky started.
“ Shut Up omega,” He seethed.
Tony ended having to replace his reactor. It was damaged from the hit Steve had placed on it, the fucker.  He had sent him into fucking cardiac arrest. Then he had to have freaking stitches in his leg which still hurt like a bitch despite the meds. Then there were the antibiotics because they had no clue what bacteria was brewing in that things mouth.
“ So he wants me as his side bitch.” He Interrupted.
Tony sighed and motioned it be let down.
“ What are you-“
It took about five more balls and a few remarks later for Tony to actually hit the ball.
Tony huffed. He was not flabby and nothing on him jiggled. The prick.
Tony groaned. He really didn’t want to spend anytime with this prick.
Steve sighed as he went up to the cage. He knew if he dragged Tony out there would be hell to pay.
“ What is this?” Tony asked as he held up the red baby doll.
“ Oh... so that’s how that works.”
“ Oh, fuck you Strange. He went after Nat and attacked Pepper. Whatever I did to piss him off was well deserved.”
“ I’m finished. You can look at it now.”
“ Oh my god! Is it a dick pic? I really want to see now! How big is he?”
Yeah, Tony took back everything he said about these people being his dream parents. That was a not too much. He could live parentless and be completely happy. Who needs two nosey geriatrics trying to set him up with his best friend.
Winghead was back in his bed by 10:30.
“ When did you start becoming chummy with Stark?” Clint asked him at breakfast one day.
Hi, thanks for all the lovely comments and I hope to continue hearing from you all.
Tony nodded and whined. He felt Bucky’s fingers enter him, stretching him wider. Bucky lulled his leg outward to stretch him wider. Tony didn’t know how long it was but he eventually felt the blunt tip of Bucky’s penis nudge his entrance. Tony lowered his hands below and tried to stretch himself further to encourage Bucky to move in faster. Steve and Bucky made sounds of disapproval and removed tony’s  hands. They said something about not wanting to rush by Tony didn’t car he wanted them in him now. Bucky slowly slid in home with a huff. Steve moves first and Bucky followed. They began to make turns and started to quicken their pace. Tony clawed at both of them. Trying to gain purchase purchase somewhere. With a loud howl Tony came and Bucky and Steve followed after a few more thrusts.
The elevators opened again and the resident superheroes walked in.
Winghead paled and look as if he saw a ghost. He let out a squeal before quickly clamoring off Tony and rushing back into the water.
“ Tony didn’t gain 10 pounds. And he is a guest. Now eat you salad before I take away your breakfast.”
Coulson just gave home one fo his friendly smiles. “ I was just leading Miss Potts to you because she told me you have some paperwork to sign.”
“ No,” Steve squeaked.
Steve shook his head.
“ Peter, it’s a big thing and shouldn’t be taken lightly. It’s fine. We can try again some other time. We just got to excited and things moved a bit too fast. It’s fine.”
She gave him a dismissive wave, “ As you wish, but please leave some for Tony. He needs to eat.”
Tony until he got cardiac clearance, he meant it.
Steve glared at him. “ I wasn’t ogling.”
“ Yeah you do. That’s why you almost killed-“
“ Honey, we won’t be hard on him.”
Steve grumbled unintelligible.
“ Steady now Mr. Stark, you’re interrogation has only just begun.”
“ Let’s how he doesn’t find out. Your dad can go crazy at times.”
He smiled at Tony as he shoved another piece of pie into his mouth. He merman features were gone  and were replaced by more human features.
“ I do believe that is my name young sir.” The butler smiled in response.
“ So we are having fish?”
“ It’s just a joke Steve. We all know that you are the real pet and this human has you by the balls.”
He then turned to Tony and kneeled down next to him.
Peter smiles at the affection.
“ Well he shouldn’t dress like that then.”
Steve gave him a disbelieving look and sighed. “ Tony I love you but we are not getting a divorce and we are definitely not getting a llama.”
“ Tony be Nice.” Pepper lightly chastised as she pulled out a folder form her bag and handed it to him with a pen to sign.
“ Let me go you bastard. I can’t believe I thought about trusting a manipulative fucking piece of shot like you!” Tony seethed.
“ And I don’t fit them.” Tony snapped. He didn’t even bother asking it as a question.
Stephan smiled, “ I missed you too. I’m sorry Christine had to cancel our little get together but the hospital called her in last minute. I’m here because apparently SHIELD has acquired a few more sirens.”
“ Get back here you bastard!” Howard yelled into the open water.
“  Deary,  where is Ultron? Does he not want to see his nana?” Maria asked.
They were alone in the common room watching movies. The rest of the Avengers were absent from the tower, leaving the two alone.
“ Man you need to loosen up a bit. I bit when you go a few rounds with this guy you’ll be a little nicer.” Sam quipped.
“ Shit. We were hoping that they would never find them. I’m sorry Buck.” Howard leaned forward to scratch under Bucky’s Chin. He went limp under the touch and purred loudly.
Peter sighed and put his head in his hands. What the fuck had that been about?
“ I’m not that kind of doctor.”
Peter turned and expected to see Ned. Instead he saw Harry jogging toward him, a big smile on his face.
Tony quickly shook his head, not wanting to upset him.
The confused Avengers all turned to them.
“ You morons. And you are supposed to be protectors of Earth. He manipulated you. The song was cursed. He wanted you to bring Tony back to him. Turn those speakers off now.”
Steve really didn’t care one way or another. He absolutely did not. There were fairies back when he was just a shrimp. What he couldn’t stand was how open they were. Why did they need to make it everyone’s business? After living in the future for a couple years he could not understand that. What makes it even more aggravating was one of these fairies lived in the same Tower as him.
Harry turned and walked away.
Bucky just waved his hand. “ you don’t have to be formal with me doll. Now tell us what you want.”
“ You said that last time and that’s how we ended up with Jamie.”
“ No, we wanted to keep them on just in case he is in distress.”
“ Tony!” He heard Cap Yell over the Comms.
“ Last night was good.”
“ I’m fine Buck. I’m letting off some steam. I’ll be home soon.” Steve saw Iron Man look at him and if he could make facial expressions he was pretty sure he would see a disappointed face.
He began to climb the steps, careful not to step in the weakened areas he recalled from the last time he visited. It probably would have been safer the scale the wall, but he didn’t want to risk running into any civilians without the mask. He hoped Wade was there and he just forgot to call. He missed him so much. He wouldn’t get mad if he stopped by right? He was just worried like any normal boyfriend would be.
“ Let me go. I’m going to kick his ass back to the fucking universe he came from.” Steve growled.
“ That feels good doesn’t it?”
Tony smiled. Maybe he will be able to have his bed back.
“ This was the only way they agreed to let him go,” Clint chuckled.
“ Yep.”
Steve sighed and dragged a hand down his face. He was not in the mood for this. “ Ok, fine. Take your time,” he grumbled.
Peter sighed and shrugged. “ I guess he’s a little hot.”
Steve jumped up. “ Are you okay? We have a medical floor...”
“ Mrs. Stark,” Clint whined.
“ Tony! You’re going to hurt yourself.”
“ Are you shitting me? He can literally make a portal and go anywhere. What the hell?”
Peter gave an exasperated sigh. “ My family. They thought you were raping me?”
“ I don’t feel comfortable doing this.” Steve mumbled.
“ I’m still seeing Wade, he’s my boyfriend.”
Howard sighed. “ Too bad. He would have been a good choice.”
“ Hardly, you are surrounded by an entourage of people who spout continuously about how great and powerful you are in their unrelenting  efforts to please you.”
Wade: I no. I keep telling you to try the chimichangas.
“ Guilty as charged.”
After about what seemed like thirty minutes. Tony pressed the housing unit of the nanites and felt it engulf his body. There were pieces missing in the armor but it should be steady enough to fly.
“ They put a tracking device in my phone. And they tracked me to your apartment and dad was spying at me through the phone because he freaking hacked it. The freaking bastard.”
“  What Idiots,” Wanda sighed.
“ Because of Tony. He is older than the others. It’s probably hard on his hips.”
He inserted another finger, scissoring the opening. From there it doesn’t take that long to enter a third finger. He then quickly enters a fourth and a fifth. Tony hissed at the burn of the stretch. He didn’t know how much time he had but he needed to quickly stretch himself wide. He knew werewolves were in a larger side but he didn’t know how big Steve was.
“ What would happen if I don’t want to recommend you? That I want you for myself?”
“ Doll want me in there as well?”
“ If you two don’t want to do it, it’s fine. But I am doing it.” Tony turned heel and began to walk away with two disgruntled super soldiers following him.
“Yes,” Peter pouted as he threw himself at his boyfriend who caught him.
“ Well he wasn’t lying when he said he was a good lay. Jealous?” Clint joked.
“ You’ll never get away with this!”
After spending a good hour holding a rifle on the ground.
“ Well I can always reward you two for your heroic behaviors.”
He said he didn’t get to thank me personally the day before and had wanted to take me to dinner but I had taken off.  I told him that I was needed here and didn’t want to leave them a man down too long.
“ T-there’s no party,” Steve stammers our.
“ What are you drawing anyway?”
Hi everyone this is the first part of this story. I also have another story currently in the works.
He had not seen them in two years when all this shit started.
What surprised Tony the most was Steve in general.
Steve rolled his eye. “ It’s not like that babe.”
“ Man what is that delicious smell?” Sam said as he walked in.  He stopped shower when he saw Maria and Howard.
Tony looked up at Steve.
Also I am looking for a Peter x Tony fanfic. Tony starts talking dirty to him in bed and insults him. It Hurts Peters feelings but he doesn’t say anything as he doesn’t want to upset tony. Please let me know if you know the name:)
Tony noticed a woman walk up next to Bucky.
“ Both of you enough!” Sam snapped. “ To be honest I’m surprised that Tony is willing to put up with your bullshit. Bruce explained to me that you almost hurt Tony this morning. And Grant I have already asked Loki his opinion. And yes I know it’s Loki, but the man can be very honest when Thor promises to take him shopping. I stress that you be very transparent with your potential partner. Do you want to tell Tony or should I? Because you need to stop antagonizing Steve. You have messed up in the past and are no better then Steve. “
“ Tony was in trouble! He could have died”
“ Don’t know what are you thinking.” Tony said in response.
“ Cornell.”
Peter squirmed nervously.
“Well he was bound to get crazy after being idolized for all those years,” Bucky said.
“ Get dress and Report immediately to the gym now.” He snapped in what sounded much like Steve’s ‘I’m-Captain-America, Don’t- you-dare- disobey” voice.
“ Are you deaf? I said hands up?” Tony stared in shock at the man dressed up in his Full Winter Solider regala plus the bad eyeshadow job with a AK-47 pointed at him.
“ And I beg to differ.”
‘ Smart.’ Tony thought. It seemed Steve wanted to get him around others so that way he wouldn’t feel uncomfortable with just him.
“ Well now you can brag to all of your friends that you bagged a young one and went at it all night.”
“ So...”
Tony sighed. “ Well some things are the same and others are different. I mean I recognized all of you, but you all are slightly different.” He didn’t want to be too specific who knew what the information could do against him.
“ You’re not mad at me are you?”
“ But-“ Tony started. He was a grown ass adult. He did not get punished.
“ Here to see my nephew, who I think is single. I don’t see a wedding ring.”
“ Come on. Faster. I know that super serum in good for something.”
Tony felt another weight on the other side of him.
Maybe he could get used to these people.
“ Yeah you and I both know that is not going to happens with him in the picture.”
“ Hey there, handsome. I got out early today. Did you behave today?” Tony walked up to the tank as the creature, Winghead ( yes, he named him that. I mean his ears look exactly like wings) happily swam up to the edge, pulling his torso into the edge. It had taken two days to complete this tank, replicating a oceanic environment with fish and a beach like area formed that sharply dropped of to the water below. It was thought that it was a better design as Winghead  wouldn’t have to drag his body out on sand before being able to swim away.Tony remembered how he was on that concrete pen and even though the creature wasn’t exactly complaining this had to be more comfortable.
Tony sighed. This was going to be a long day.
Harry smiled and they continued on their way. Peter thought he saw some of the omegas and betas glare at them.
With his thighs. He felt Steve worked at him furiously and felt as if Steve was going to suck his brain from his dick.
“ You know it’s not you fault right? Bucky even said so. I even proved it mathematically to you before. I can again if you want me to. It just happened. It was an accident.”
He held still one he bottomed out and wanted for Tony to give him the signal.
I was given an overview. It seemed straightforward enough. The only thing odd was that I was told that under no circumstances was I to remove my suit. And even under my suit I had to wear this light colored make up. I thought it was weird but I didn’t care.
Tony snorted. “ Of course you are medically insane too.”
“ I’m sorry mama. I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
“Tony!”
“ Yeah,” Tony asked as he looked over at his father. “ and what’s my type.”
Steve looked at him sheepishly, “ I forgot.”
“ Shit. That’s...” Rhodey just shook his head and didn’t comment.
“ I’m not really the party type, Harry. Besides
“ Well who you the fuck are you then?” Bucky asked.
Grant suddenly leaned forward and bit Tony’s shoulder roughly as he released into the condom. Grant tried to reach around to bring Tony to completion but he slapped his hand. “ I’m too sore right now to come. It would probably hurt.”
Bruce looked up from his book and raised his eye brow.
Tony looked at them both, “ Now don’t get jealous ok? Both of you will have your time with me. How’s your guys experience?”
“ In a sense, yes.”
Steve smiled at him and nuzzled Tony’s cheek.
He heard some noises and quickly ran where Tony has disappeared. He ran over, preparing to...
Tony jumped. He never heard Bruce curse before and just let himself get angry with that. He accidentally bumped into Bucky, who stumbled a bit in surprise.
Pepper cane walking over to him. How can this woman find him no matter where he goes. As Pepper approached him she held out a stack full of papers.
Steve smiled back. “ How do you like it here? I know you haven’t even been here for a day, but I would like to hear your opinion.”
“ James be respectful! I didn’t raise you that way,” Bucky admonished.
“ No, No, No! Absolutely not! How the hell did you find my bathroom?. You are going to use the guest bathroom. “
“ Hey hey Vixens is a respectable establishment and he only just watched- ow, dad.”
“ Ok?” Steve said as he scrunched up his eye brows.
“ Fine.”
“Sure. I think I feel like pizza.”
Howard turned and glared.
Tony tilted his upward, waiting expectantly for a kiss. Steve smiled and leaned forward to press a kiss onto his lips. Tony sighed into and allowed his tongue to slip past his own lips to lick at Steve’s. Steve groaned and allowed Tony to enter his mouth. He felt Tony’s appendage explote his mouth, coaxing his own tongue to play with his.
“ Yeah. Why the fuck am I being given a salad.”
Tony groaned as he felt a think finger slide into him. “ Of course I do you menace.” Tony opened his legs a little wider so that he can give Steve better access. To y felt a second sneak in. Tony moaned whe the fingers scissored open.
Bruce sighed at rubbed his forehead. “ It doesn’t work like that. Tell me would you sleep with Wanda?”
Tony smiled up at him and nodded as he sat next to the open seat next to Howard.
“ Would you like some spaghetti dear,” Maria asked, already putting a generous helping on a plate.
Harry chuckled as he lowers his head and placed a kiss on the shaft of his penis. Peter would have jumped off the bed if Harry’s hands weren’t there. Harry chuckled again. “ Gotta stay put love.”
Rhodey paused in his rant to give Tony two spoonfuls of the Ben and Jerry’s ice cream that was named after him. He had thought he wasn’t supposed to have dairy but Tony had insisted on it anyway.
“ No you dork. I meant a different way.”
“ I can still recite periodic table.”
“ And how do you know this?”
“ Thor, how are his vitals,” Tony asked
“ What did you do to piss him off?” Natasha asked Clint.
“ Talk dirty to me babe. Want to hear your mouth.” Steve said as he mouth his neck.
“ “Well, Ms. Potts Stark was the only one capable of handling that device and he did very well and he survived. So I don’t see what the issue here is.”
“ What the hell?!”
“ Yeah not really,” a cocky voice said behind him. Peter gave a groan of frustration as he turned and took of his mask. He glared at the man who was smirking at him.
“ - crap. I feel like I’m being smothered and that Steve and Grant don’t trust me to take care of myself. Also, the fighting. They are always fighting. It always “ Tony I’m better” and jabs and insults. And I’m just getting tired of it.”
“ Clint stop being annoying,” Nat said as she sat down next to him.
“ Well I don’t know about you but I need some tea. Want some?”
Tony giggled before diving back down and kissing him. “ Are you going to take me to bed, Soldier?”
He offered clams
“ What the hell is their problem. What the fuck did you do to them Stark?” Clint snapped. His foul mood wasn’t unjustified. He was black and blue and was sore as hell. The Commander has sparred with him and didn’t hold back his punches and when Clint decided to get testy, he got literally beaten into submission. So yeah, he was allowed to be a little ticked off.
Tony just nodded. He looked around curiously. There were a lot of books about microbiology and celular regeneration and the such. “I never  had any interest in such things,” Tony thought, “i like my robots. They are what are comfortable to me. I don’t like living things. Too much drama with living things.”
“ Yeah... that. They knew each other since Tony graduate college and they had some intimate experiences together. Steve has hated Strange since that. He was jealous. But that was also when he found out he had a chance with him. A year later, Tony was killed in the accident.”
“ Like a dog?”
“ And to what pleasure do I owe your visit in the middle
Pietro glared at him, “ Big talk for someone who just flunked their chem test.”
“ The phase that’s the biggest pain in ass to me.”  Schmidt muttered.
Tony just sighed as he turned and opened the door. Hopefully he was going to have some sort of distraction in this place.
“ Tony, are you sure you want to get into a relationship with the two of them? I mean look what Steve did to you.” Pepper asked.
Bucky threw a breadstick at his head.
“ Rhodey, I’m telling you I have not been drinking!” Tony snapped, he was exasperated that his bull headed friend wasn’t getting the message. He had been talking on the phone with him for the past fifteen minutes and this conversation wasn’t really going anywhere.
“ St-“
Winghead rushed out of the water and swiped at Pepper, leaving a set of claw marks on her arm.
“ You will break his heart.”
Tony just sulked as Clint snickered in the background.
Wade: you’re lucky like like you ;)
“ Then that means you are still free. And so is my handsome genuine of a nephew.”
“ Well based on how relax he looked today, it must be going pretty damn well. I’ve never seen him smile like that and act so relax.” Scott added.
“ Can we stop watching this? If you guys wanted to see a sex tape I’m pretty sure I can find one with me in it on the Internet.”
Maria gave a sigh and looked over at the begging archer.
Tony raised his hand. This was nuts. Grant sighed. “ Yes, Tony?”
“ Come on, I know it’s a hot piece of ass but he doesn’t like you. The man sent an RPG at us last week.”
“ Who knows. Come sit down and have some popcorn.”
Peter looked up and so Harry walking toward them, scowling.
Steve quickly turned around to see Clint standing there with a box of Chex mix and a smirk on his face. “ Sorry man couldn’t help myself. You are pretty hung over Stark aren’t ya?”
“ I thought it was fine.” He mumbled.
“ Shhhhh.... not so loud, they’ll hear. I’m just here to help.”
Winghead gives an affronted look.
“ No matter what universe he is from he shall always be my son and I shall love him as such,” he snarled.
Clint chuckled. “ Black Widow 1, Winter Soldier 0. Don’t worry Buck, I’ll reset the scoreboard at midnight tonight.”
Tony chuckled. “ Just kidding. How are you two? Not planning world domination yet are we?”
Steve walked back to the elevator. He looked back sadly one last time at Tony before leaving.
Tony snarled, baring his Fangs. “ I said fucking spank me.”
Tony grabbed onto his hair as Steve began to bite and suck on his neck.
Steve gave him a soft smile and kissed him. He pulled back and had his hands on his hips, “Tony, thank you. It means the world to me that you brought Bucky back, but... I need you right now. I didn’t like seeing him with you... that close to you... touching you.” Steve gave a possessive growl before burying his face into his neck. Tony felt canines graze his neck as a tongue flickered out.
“ Portia? As in Portia Russo? Tony she’s just a baby!” Maria cried out, scandalized.
Tony smirked. “ Well you are going to have to put some work in there buddy.”
Steve shakes him gently but his eyes were dim and the arc reactor was a faint glow.  “ No...no...no” Steve whimpered. He felt Bucky put a hand on his shoulder, saying something that sounded much like an apology.
“ It’s defiantly doable. We just have to take it slow.” Tony continued to plead.
Pete groaned, “ But dad. It’s so embarrassing .”
“ That was awesome,” Steve panted out.
Tony nodded. He hadn’t had any alcohol in two years, but he wasn’t going to say no to a good bottle of scotch. He sat next to him and dropped two glasses on the coffee table in front of them before pouring  some of the liquid in the glasses. He put down the bottle and offered Tony a glass before taking his own and throwing it back in one go. Tony held the glass in his hands nervously.
“ Relax baby I’ll be fine.”
Tony straddled Steve and began to kiss him sensually.
There was a loud hiss and a lot of splashing.
After he had folded the last article of clothing he went over to Tony and placed a hand on his back to encourage him to stand. He lead him to the bedroom. Tony tried to stay calm as he swallowed the saliva that gathered in his throat and tried to calm his racing heart.
“ You heard me.”
Winghead nodded. He then gripped Tony’s ass with one of his claws.
“ Thank you Natasha.”
“ I already told you no.”
“ Well you know I’m with Nat...” Bucky trailed off as he looked at a nonchalant Natasha lounging on a near by chair.
Steve reaches over and grabbed it and tossed it on the bed. Steve balances himself over Tony and began to kiss him. Tony only kissed back as he knew it will keep him in a good mood. Last time he refused to kiss him and bit him, the Steve clone pouted and had turned Bucky into a punching bag. So, hence the kissing.
Tony’s eyes widened. “ My, my Commander. I’m surprised that you are so forward. I thought such thoughts were forbidden in your generation.”
Tony placed his hands on his torso, trying to push him back. “ Ok, settle down. You made your point. Bruce back up a bit.”
“ I just wanted to drop this off for you. I can’t stay long.”
Steve looked at him in awe with starry eyes. Tony smiled and got up to kiss Steve’s cheek.
“ If you mean behave, did he break into R&D again, then no. “
“ Please don’t...” He said softly.
It wasn’t long until Tony felt a large finger tracing his hole.
“ What’s with The attitude? Come on you need to go home. You can’t stay here-“
Steve rolled his eyes.
“ They are not a pack, they are a pod.”
Bruce nodded slowly. ” So what can I help you with?”
Tony looked over and saw Steve standing there calmly as if nothing had happened.
Clint gave a low whistle. “ Here’s some advice Steve. I’ve been married a long time, this is the part where you grovel on your knees and beg for forgiveness.”
Tony pulled back. “ I’m almost there babe. I’m going to come.”
“ I thought you look familiar. You do look a lot like Captain America now that I really take a good look at you.” Sam said.
“ But he’s not so bad. He’s pretty nice and he cares for me. We weren’t even physical. He didn’t want to start a relationship until I turned 18.”
Suddenly steve s fingers were ripped out of him and Tony winced from the rough exit but that was forgotten when he heard the menacing growl and the sound of someone going through a wall. He sat up and saw Bucky’s white wolf form in front from Steve Sable colored form. They were both almost as large as a horse, and Tony was able to visualize  the large sinewy muscles flexing under their skin. Tony noticed Bucky’s front metal leg whirling and saw sharp metal claws extract. Steve growled and flashed his teeth. Tony noticed that his shoulder was bleeding from a deep claw shaped gashes.
Peter groaned, “ How many times I have to tell you? I wasn’t raped. We were role playing. We are in a relationship.”
Tony smiled as he slung the bag over his shoulder and began walking again. There was no point in standing still. He needed to keep moving.
“ What is wrong with how I dress?” Wanda seethed at Steve, completely ignoring Tony. It’s not like he minded. Nope he didn’t mind it at all.
He felt a tug at his neck as his collar was lightly tugged from the leash attached to it. He looked and saw that the group he was with was moving.
“ I want you to stay the hell away from that boy Peter!” He growled the moment they stepped onto his floor.

Clint just chuckled.
“ You were in pain yesterday. You couldn’t even hold a damn plate. Earlier this week your hand spasmed around your girlfriends neck when you were kissing her. Next time I may not be there to help.”
“ Almost did. But fortunately for me I’m like a cockroach: I’m impossible to kill.”
“ I’m thirty seven thank you very much,”  Tony snapped.
Steve smiled and playfully splashed water back.
“ More... please.... more...” he begged.
“ Oh god, did you think it was because we would stop you? Do you really think that poorly of us? Of me? I just want you happy Bambino. Even if that means giving you up.”
Steve nodded and dismissed him.  Steve opened the door and walked through the door. Tony was on the bed, naked, his ankle changed to the wall.
Peter grumbled,” Am not.”
At that moment the wall to their right was crashed open as three familiar figures made their way through. “ Party’s over guys.”
“ Learned it from you babe.”
Steve relented and rolled his hips softly.
It really didn’t take long to install and aquarium in the penthouse. It was a basic aquarium with some oceanic vegetation and some fish. Tony waved at him through the class as he watched Winghead swim by.
“ Because you two think that I’m going to break if you two try to spar with me. Bucky on the other hand will give me a challenge.”
“ Fury this is Nat. We have a problem.”
Tony sighed. Looks like he was going to have to do all the work as always. “ I’m fuck-“
“ Fine.”
The phone dinged again with a new text.
“ Fucking arm seized up again. I need to take it off. It’s hurting like a bitch.”
“ Jarvis,” Tony said in disbelief.
“ Yes sir he is. Would you like access?”
“ I can work on your suit. Or you shield. Whatever you prefer. They can both be updated.”
“Tony, you have a meeting back at the tower in 45 minutes, would you like to leave now?” Pepper asked.
“ Come on is it really that bad?”
Tony nipped at his lips and moaned as he opened his mouth and battled his tongue with his own. Tony pushed him back softly when he realized something.
“ But I wanted to do it! I love you. I wanted-“
“ Hey, what’s going on?” He asked.
“ how about we just focus on you now? Huh? And wreak that little right asshole if yours?” Bucky said in a husky voice as a finger traced the puckered hole. Tony squealed and cuddles back into Steve who had now wrapped hisEld around Tony.
Winghead happily chirped as he  dove into the water.
Sam chuckled. “ you dressed as a pool boy? I’ll pay to see that.”
“ I’m sorry I have to leave, but I was wondering if you and I can have a late dinner together. I didn’t like how we left hinge last night and I wanted to apologize for my behavior and making you feel Uncomfortable. That was not my intention. I would like to talk things out...and you know...” he was flushing at this point and seemed kind of nervous. He looked at Tony with such sad puppy eyes that Tiny felt that he would be the biggest dick in the world if he were to say no. Why couldn’t he be more of an ass like people accuse him of?
“Food, right?”
penthouse when he wanted Tony. Tony had explained it as something to do with the memory of Howard killing Stane’s boner. Either way, Steve was grateful. He didn’t have to worry about growling throughout his entire visit from Stane’s lingering scent.
“Whatever you decide,” Steve whispered. Tony was so close to him, he could feel the shared warmth their bodies created, he took a deep breath, letting their mixed scents calm him. “I don’t think he’ll let you go easily.”
His smile was wide and satisfied; there was also a distinct tent in his pants. “Locked the door behind me.” Steve shrugged.
“Pants first,” Tony said, and they made their way slowly out into the hallway. Tony pointed to a room across the hall and they stumbled their way over. There was a fingerprint lock on the door, but Tony pressed his thumb to it. The doors slid open and the thick, alpha scent flew out. It was enough to make Tony whine and fall to his side, landing against the doorframe which he began to slide down. “I don’t know if I can--” he broke off, taking a shaky breath through his mouth.
Steve knew this about Tony. “Get it all the way hard for me.”
who Tony was. “Can you help us out in the alley?” Steve muttered quickly then moved Tony out the door, the pale-faced man following.
A plan formed. Steve walked into the alley, pulling out his phone and keeping his focus on the screen as he approached the wait staff. He stopped near them, eyes on the phone, pressing buttons and sighing loudly.
Anticipation curled, bumping the thrumming up a notch. “Yes…Why?”
“Tony, how are--?” Every word died in his throat. Tony was obviously not okay, and it was obviously Stane who was the cause. “When?” Steve managed through gritted teeth.
Tony shook his head, holding out a hand. “He’ll be fine, if my hypothesis is correct--”
Tony blindly reached for it on the bed, eyes never leaving Steve as he leaned against their bedroom wall, arms crossing over his chest and pulling the threadbared shirt over his biceps. Fuck, if his husband wasn’t beautiful. And also a fucking tease.
“Can’t we just tell them not to make eye contact with anyone but each other?” Tony asked Steve as he looked over the group, Jimin and Jungkook were already looking into each other’s eyes. “Looks like those two are ahead of the game.”
“And none of it will help get you in the air.” It was a rough change of subject, but Tony let it slide.
Steve gestured to the chair next to him.“Sit.”
“Okay, Tony.” He leaned back on the bench, alone now, mind diving into all the things Tony might have planned. Kissing, touching, wherever and whenever. He wanted everything, everything Tony wanted.
“Tony, I’m almost certain that the most emblematic Canadian animal is a moose.” Steve sighed, again, even as Tony waved a ferret in his face.
The words soured the room, the bitter bite twisting through the citrusy scent that doused the air.
A name cut through his usual tuning-out.

The door swung shut and locked with a squelching noise.
Namjoon nodded again, this time looking a bit more at ease, maybe even relieved. “I’ve always wanted to meet you. We all have. We just…”
When Steve’s hand released his cock, the need was still there deep inside his groin, but it was easy to ignore, when Steve asked him to.
Steve shook his head before replying, as if he had to physically remove the thoughts Tony had placed there. Tony smirked and made a crude gesture with his hand wrapped around the broomstick until Steve cracked a smile. “Just as inappropriate, too,” Steve noted.
Mission accomplished.
Steve wanted him here, at his desk and at his mercy. Teasing Tony all day, it was easy to recall the pleasure darkening Steve’s blue eyes, how fierce he looked when he ordered Tony around. His cock twitched in the ring, and he purposely shifted his weight so the plug would move inside him. He could get off like this, if he really tried hard enough, focusing on Steve’s order, his control over him, how his lovebites were so familiar after nearly a decade together that he could feel the ghost of Steve’s lips running down his neck. But it was all a tease. Steve loved to build him up. Loved to leave him hanging, too.
Steve's scowl deepened. He reached out and rapped a knuckle on the clear bulb of Tony's helmet. Tony looked down for a moment, hands opening and closing, and then the glass slid back, revealing Tony's face. Steve felt a little of the tension slip out of his shoulders. "You looked like you were in a fish bowl."
Tony parted for him, tongue coming out to swipe at Steve’s lips before he could even get his bearings around the taste of Tony. It didn’t take long before Steve wanted more than what the over-the-shoulder kissing was allowing him to have. He growled in frustration then rolled in their confined capsule, until he was on his back and able to pull Tony on top of him.
Above him, Tony went wild, hands scrabbling for purchase against the door and, when he couldn't find any, twisting into Steve’s hair. Steve was unrelenting; he needed to touch Tony. He wanted to take the man apart and build him up again, just like Tony had with his armor. He wanted to swallow him down then dress him up in his own come. His tongue twisted against the head of Tony’s cock, and Steve knew he wouldn’t last long.
“So when you say flying broomsticks….”
Steve’s lips brushed across Tony’s hair, another bolt making him gasp against the dark strands. “We should go inside soon,” Steve whispered between breaking waves.
Later that night Bucky sat in the corner of the compound’s living space, book in hand and watched Tony walk in, face fixed on his phone. That was until something caught his eye.
Tony tilted his head, bearing his neck to Steve, beautiful in his submission.
Steve didn’t say anything, kept grinning like a loon at Anthony, and Tony really should be going soon but he really had zero intention or interest in breaking those two apart right now.
The elevator doors opened, and Steve hated the sour scent that assaulted his nose, spiked with fear and soiled humanity, but it proved that Tony was still in fact alive.
Steve groaned, because what Tony decided was a fun joke, was really the team and Steve himself trying to be considerate.
Tony shrugged, just as surprised. “A fanchant perhaps?”
“He’s not slowing--” Thor started to say, but then a cut lashed across Steve’s back and Steve screamed, pain wrenching through his body. A flash of gold surrounded them, a burst of energy knocking Thor off his feet.
“Good.” Tony leaned back on the bench, breaking the tension between them with a sudden snap as he brushed a hand over Steve’s hair, rubbing it like you would a child, or a pet. Then he pulled his phone out of his jeans and tossed Steve a distracted smile. “I gotta go.” Tony took him in and softened at what must be his very flustered demeanor. “I’ll see you at home, come to the penthouse around seven.”
“What do you mean?” Steve pressed.
“I’m sorry, did you hit your head?”
Steve growled, and Tony mewled, skittering across the room. Steve clamped down on his throat, trying to control his natural response to Tony’s words. “No.”
Stane’s spat at Steve. “So you’re the man--the alpha--that thought he could take what’s mine right out from under me.” Shifting his weight, Stane crossed his arms over his chest. “Well let me tell you, kid, you messed with the wrong--”
“If it means you’re going outside, then yes.”
“Stay,” Tony said, pulling the blanket around himself as he nodded towards the space next to him that he’d been laying on. “Sit. I can’t do much today, but Obie’s gone and it’d be nice to have some company.”
Steve pressed the reactor back into its casing with a satisfying
Steve remained silent until he realized Tony was waiting for him to reply. “I do,” he admitted, face burning even though no one around them could overhear.
Clint tried to bolt out from under James, but his thighs tightened and held Clint in place. Determined fingers dug in at the exact right places and a bubble formed in his chest, building as he twisted into the sensitive skin until he could barely manage between laughs: “Don’t you dare!”
Steve swallowed and looked away, knowing his face was beet red. Tony chuckled and walked over to a nearby deck chair where a plush white robe awaited him. Only when he wrapped it around his bare shoulders and tied it closed with a knot at his hip, did Steve take in a deep breath.
“I have an idea.”
Tony felt the thrill of satisfaction run through him. “So you
The thought seemed so ludicrous now, with Tony gripping tight into his hair and rolling his hips against Steve’s. Tony wanted him, it was clear as day in his scent, his rocking hips, his needy kisses. Steve broke away with a harsh breath when he felt the first hint of Tony’s hard cock against his thigh. “Tony,” he whispered between heaving breaths.
Tony closed his eyes and shook his head. Steve’s gaze fixed on the bits of moisture that wet the corners of his eyes, but by the time his eyelashes fluttered open again the tears were gone and the bright eyes he’d come to know were as dead as the ones he’d first seen on the sidewalk weeks ago. “It’s nothing. It’s normal. A medical exam, nothing really, routine.”
Steve followed up several floors, until he got to one he hadn’t been to before. It looked more like the hallway of a hotel than an office building. The scent of Tony was almost as strong as when he was right in front of him.
“What do I want?”
“Nevermind.” He nodded towards Steve. “He’s got enough stubborn in him to take on two of us, anyway.”
“When have you ever listened to straws when it yielded an outcome you didn’t like?” Tony asked, landing next to the pilot chair and lowering his visor, he lifted his eyebrow at Steve.
Tony pulled back, stepping away, expression shuttering and closing down in front of Steve. “You shouldn’t.”
“You’re a menace,” Steve mumbled as Tony slid onto the bench next to him, accompanying his teasing with an elbow to the ribs. Steve was unable to hold back a smile even as he covered the nymph with his arm. It looked too much like Tony. But the way the man’s eyes flickered to the page made him wonder if Tony had seen anyway.
“Anthony!” Steve shouted as the hum morphed into a gust of wind, whipping the papers off Steve’s desk and rattling the broomsticks off the wall. The beam hit the other side of the hut, and Tony remembered how it felt slamming into his chest. There was a bang, but instead of blowing the hut in half, magic or expert craftsmanship held it in place. The beam left the blue stone entirely, forming a large circle that stood on its own at the far end of the hut.
“Will you let me help you Tony? When you confront him. Please
Steve’s fingers didn’t even falter when he noticed Tony, he just moved over on the bench to give Tony room to slide down next to him. He played the final notes of the song, letting his finger linger on the last one, as he turned to give Tony a small smile. “My mother taught me that song.”
“Yeah.”
Tony waved him off. “I am not. For one thing in my universe I can only fly with an armored suit.”
Tony nodded. Once inside, the doors slid closed behind him, and Steve unclenched his teeth against a loud roar of anger. He didn’t even try to tamp it down; Tony was waiting outside and Tony wouldn’t see or smell the anger he soaked into Stane’s space.
Steve tried to shake the focus while also continuing the conversation. “A man like Stane, seems like he would have a lot of enemies of his own.”
Steve remained silent until he realized Tony was waiting for him to reply. “I do,” he admitted, face burning even though no one around them could overhear.
Tony barked out a laugh while Anthony turned beet red.
They had both removed their helmets, shoulders brushing as they walked back down the hall to relieve the K-pop stars from their hideout. Tony tried to think of some flirtation or smooth comment, but for the first time in a long while, his mind came up blank. Instead he knocked his hip into Steve’s and smiled back when Steve grinned at him. They kept their eyes locked for a moment longer than Tony normally would, wanting to see if Steve would pull away...or lean in closer, link their arms together or maybe even kiss him, right here in the middle of the hallway.
Tony’s hand began moving without a second thought, his hand hardwired to listen to Steve’s voice when he dropped it rough and deep.
“Well--” the man straightened, taking a step closer, eyes fixed to Tony’s hand “--there is magic, it exists....” he whispered the words like they were an afterthought, hand reaching out for the ring. “Where did you…?”
Steve’s hands flew to his fly, scrambling to get the zipper down, but when Tony tried to help, Steve pushed his hands away. He abandoned the fly half-way down to reach under his shirt and pull out his dog tags. He unhooked them from his neck and handed them to Tony, who wrapped the chain around his fingers and held them tight. Steve finally got his pants undone and pushed them down, rushed, wild.
It was like everyone in the stadium hushed to a quiet, his angelic voice ricocheting off the empty seats. Tony felt more than saw Steve slide up next to him as the rest of the members chimed in and the song continued. “They sure sound beautiful.”
“I’ve been watching you,” Tony added.
. This incredible man that had stopped an invasion with a suit of his own creation and unparalleled genius alone belonged to Steve, and the truth of that was enough to catch his breath. There was blood on Tony’s armor but none of it was his own, Steve had made sure of that. Because as much as Tony could face down an army, Steve would shield him from the brunt of its force. Steve could protect him.
“I know, Steve,” Chef Ana finally broke in, bringing a hand up to rub his shoulder. “I’ll make sure he knows.”
“Why are you on the floor?”
Rhodey had the fleeting worry that if this went south--he hadn’t seen Tony look this happy in a long while--but he tried to push his worries away. Tony would do what Tony wanted to do, and obsessing over what might happen would be a waste of time. Besides, Rogers was a good man, and Rhodey was pretty sure he could trust him. He was happy for his friend, because he hadn’t seen him look that content in a long time…if ever.
Bright, vibrant red shot across his sniper’s scope like a star hurtling through the sky, the only color in the night. The Soldier pulled his sniper away from the mission. He followed the red in his scope, watched, as it paused in the air, facing the Soldier. He couldn’t look away.
“Just this last bit and you’ll be ready.” A pause and shuffle then a lube covered plug teased at his rim. “Spread wider,” he ordered, voice low and determined. “Still loose from last night. Good for you, considering…” The tip pressed inside without much more warning.
He heard more than saw Tony’s pout. “Guess he’s choosing paperwork over us.”
Steve chuckled, dark and twisted with the thought of how he never knew of half the things his body would or could do since the serum. He shook his head. “Guess all that pleading and wishing and begging that went on inside my head caused something to change inside of me, something that allowed me to shoot up into the sky and save you.”
“This was even better than it sounded,” James said between sips, as they walked around the port side.
Steve stepped forward, blocking the rest of the world so all Tony could see was
“Think he’s learned his lesson, yet?” Tony asked, biting a line of kisses down Bucky’s throat as he kept his gaze seared on Steve. Steve’s body inflamed, breaking out into goosebumps.
Steve snorted. “I think that depends entirely on whether you kick in your sleep.” This whole scenario devolved into surreal because it seemed like he was actually about to sleep with Tony.
“There’s a reason the shapeshifters targeted them,” Steve reminded. “Their influence is supposed to be unmatched.”
Steve wanted to protest on his behalf, started to, because Steve had seen it all--the alpha stopping them to take his call, the omega waiting patiently by the window--their tardiness hadn’t been his fault, and even if it had.... But the look in Tony’s expression made it seem like he was used to being pinned with the blame, and with it-- By the sight of the bruises on his skin, Steve didn’t want to know what would happen next.
He desperately wanted Tony to know him as Steve. He told himself that was why he pushed it to the side, failed to think about what it meant, but here he was a “Hero” and he was failing the one man he...cared for.
“He’s from a different universe!” Anthony shouted and the rest of the room went quiet. “God you’re infuriating, how we ever managed to get together in
Tony sucked in a quick breath. “I saw you watching me all day.” He dove in and kissed Steve again, making it so that he didn’t have to reply, but his words still shook Steve. Part of him wanted to pull away and duck his head in Tony’s neck but instead he parted his lips and let Tony deepen their kiss.
Tony swallowed. “Thank you?”
Steve was writing a reply asking Tony how he was today, when a series of messages came in back to back.
Their heaving breaths echoed in the sleep capsule, and Steve kept his hand around them long after they’d stopped coming. It was Tony who moved first, some talented stretching and foot grabbing to bring his pajama pants up to their hands without hitting his head or moving much at all. Then Tony rolled onto his side as much as he could with Steve flat on his back and handed it to Steve after wiping himself with it first. When Steve finished, Tony cuddled back up to his side and Steve wrapped his arm around him and pulled him close. Pressed together like this, there was plenty of room in the sleep capsule. More than comfortable, Steve fell asleep easily.
pilot chair, scooting past Tony who balked at being nudged. It was months that they were going to be in space together. He ran down the long belly of the ship and hoped what he suspected was wrong, but as he turned to the one cabin he knew it was true.
“And here I thought you were just upset this latest mission came delivered on old-fashioned paper instead of email.”
He was perfunctory about it, not building to anything, just putting the plug in its place like Tony had his Windsor knot, his Adam's apple hitting it as he swallowed. One more push and it was inside, stretching him, the layer of lube Steve had applied doing little to ease the burn. Tony loved that burn, loved how even with his face pressed into the mattress and his hands spreading his ass apart, all he could focus on was the burn.
He rolled the metal sphere Tony had given him around in his palm. His hot skin had warmed it to body temperature. It was all he could think about, despite the press of the party around him, the music, the laughter.
The screens lit up with Steve's face, eyes narrowed and mouth partly open, caught mid-sentence. He could see the amusement in his eyes, warring with exasperation. Was this how Tony saw him?
Steve was on his feet and running across the street within seconds. Gravel skidded under his boots as Tony retracted his gauntlets, eyes bright and pupils wide. Steve pulled off his cowl, and it was like Tony couldn’t contain his surge of adrenaline, moving forward with his hands on Steve’s hips. If a camera were to capture them now, it’d be an image to inspire generations. All Steve wanted was to close the space between them with a kiss, wrap a hand into Tony’s hair and make it deep and filthy.
Steve shifted from foot to foot, knew his face resembled a deer caught by surprise. “I’m looking for, um, something to help an omega. My, um, omega. We want to, uh, not have to worry, right now at least, um...”
That made Coulson’s lips press into a thin line, accompanying his narrowed eyes. “Some very
In two more steps, Tony was out of the pool and on his phone. The water didn’t seem to bother him, he just let it rundown his body and puddle at his feet. When Steve realized he was staring at the curve of Tony’s legs, he snapped his gaze back up to the man’s face and saw that he'd been caught.
Blood pooled under Stane’s head, neither of them moved.
Then it was back to business.
Steve had assured him, but what if Tony didn’t want to disrupt the balance that had formed? What if Tony had been worried asking would change things between them? Steve knew how fast he went down, saw the haze in eyes and the slack in his smile. The warmth he radiated that burned the cold out of Steve’s deepest corners. Tony was bright and bold and breathtaking. Tony was his.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think I saw some mistletoe back in that green room closet.”
“Only a few elevators go down to this floor.” Were the first words Tony spoke to him.
For hundredthousands
“Tony…” Steve broke off as he pushed in the kitchen doors. The mask was firmly on Tony’s face now and this new kitchen staff didn’t recognize Steve either, so they all turned to look suspiciously at them. That was until a man in the back by the sink took a big inhale and shot his eyes towards masked Tony, face pale like he
Tony dropped the ring like it was on fire. The humming he’d felt earlier still echoing through his palm. “We found it during a mission in New York. It was just a few days ago, at least in my neck of the multiverse. Almost smacked me in the back of the helmet, if Steve hadn’t caught it first. It was going fast, just like everything else that was shooting out of that portal.”
“Sounds like I’ve seen rather more of him than you.”
“I’m so sorry.”
Steve reached out, a gentle finger against Tony’s chin. “But you’re not, though. Even when it would be so understandable if you were. It was inhumane how he treated you. But here you are, strong and whole.”
In their silence, the hum of the toys carried through the auditorium. Steve dropped his hands to his bulge, adjusting. Steve caught him watching and didn’t let his gaze go. “I hear sometimes these shows have an encore.”
“Did we just unlock some sort of chant?” Steve asked.
then why else are you so uncomfortable sharing a bed with…” he trailed off, walking down a logical path that could only lead to one place, given how Steve was acting all day, and Steve fell right over the edge of realization with him, breath catching and mind reeling. The conclusion Tony had come to was one Steve had only learned himself over the last twenty-four hours. His face flamed red and he wished more than anything that their heads weren’t sharing a pillow so that he could bury his into its suffocating softness.
All morning, an idea had been forming, one Steve had hoped to execute with the help of the storage closet in SHIELD medical but now Steve had to change gears. He didn’t particularly like theft or subterfuge, but he was going to have to do at least one to successfully help Tony, and helping Tony seemed to be his top, and only, priority these days.
One thing people always forgot was that Steve Rogers lied to get in the military; he lied to get out of trouble; he lied to find sustenance for first his mother and best friend, and then for his men on the battlefield. Now, Steve smiled easily and shook his head.
“I’m fine, really,” Tony whispered but he didn’t move away, instead Steve could’ve sworn he shuffled closer.
"- was complete luck!" Clint called out.
The low hum deep inside him had ceased entirely over the last hour, but Tony wasn’t fooled. He knew it was only a matter of time before Steve decided to play with Tony. And he would know that just the thought of it would do what it was doing now, with Tony on edge from anticipation, his skin flushing and blood rushing to his cock, without Steve having to press a single button at all. He had Tony wrapped around his finger, consumed only by thoughts of Steve, without having to do a thing.
He was beautiful and serious and commanding and Steve’s stomach swooped as the rest of the world fell away to leave only Tony in sharp focus. The tension returned, tenfold, all wound through Steve’s nerves until it pulled him taut.
“So.” Tony clapped his hands together. “I guess the first thing I do is mount it--” he wiggled his eyebrows together “--isn’t that right?”
“Go eat,” Steve said because he knew the look of a leader who wasn’t going to relax until he knew his men were safe, and right now they were as safe as they could be. “We’re making sure no one comes in unless they’ve passed security screening, and you guys have a show to put on later. A show I’m sure you need energy for.”
“Why are you drawing that nymph with clothes on?” Steve stilled his pencil, breath catching Tony’s scent as it invaded the air between them. “Fewer blush inducing parts?”
Stony + travel, Canada, animal for @hundredthousands
“I’ll take you to my apartment--”
He heard Tony smile. There was another rustle and Tony bent over him, their chests nearly touching, then the barest brush of Tony's lips against his. Tony spoke so quietly a non-superhero wouldn’t have heard a word.
"You would say that."
Steve left the pharmacy fifteen minutes later with a bag of suppressants and a countdown until the next time he’d see Tony.
Anthony snorted. “He’s as polite as you.”
“Good job, Steve,” Tony whispered, his smile playing at the edges between pleased, proud and
Steve startled when Tony’s arm slipped around his waist. The easy affection was new and he tried not to focus on how much he enjoyed it, unsure if he was reading too much into the casual gesture.
His counterpart’s question cut out as Professor Rogers stepped forward. “Oh, why don’t we try--” He flicked his wand and sent the stone fumbling onto his bedroom carpet; their connection blinked out of space and time.
“But you didn’t.” The words didn’t carry an accusatory tone but they still hit him square in the heart, sucked out his breath.
There was a briefcase Tony held sometimes. He used it when they assembled, or when he had a particularly precarious board meeting to attend. It contained the suit, iron man red, sleek as much as sturdy.
Tony tried to focus on the mission at hand and not on Steve.
“I need your mouth,” Steve hissed out, one elbow braced against the wall, head down. Tony tipped his chin up and met Steve’s fiery gaze. “Drop the tags if you need me to stop. I'll hear it.”
Steve did. His breath caught in his throat until he felt Tony pull back his waistband. With his face pressed into the rug, he felt Tony’s hand brush against his bare ass. “So, very pretty. I want to paint this ass red one day. Would you like that?”
Tony barked out a laugh. “No you don’t, but you can keep trying.”
Tony’s head fell onto Steve’s shoulder as the ensemble sang on the stage below. “Yes, Steve. Please.”
“If you’d let me speak!” Tony shouted, knowing it’d be a challenge to out-stubborn himself, instead he appealed to Steve. “He isn’t entirely incorrect. I honestly didn’t think about it until we were flying back over the forest. Jeez, give a guy some credit.” He glared at his counterpart. “I’m not in the business of ripping happy couples apart--” When neither of them blushed at his comment, both just continuing to glare at him, Tony noted that all it took was the light threat of accidental universe hopping for them to get over their bashful stage. “My plan is to move the stone’s beam, or portal, or whatever, away from Steve before it hits him in the gut. That should open the connection but create, well, a doorway, versus a one way hit to the chest to beam me up Scottie back to my Earth.”
Out of nowhere, Tony groaned and Steve felt his pulse ramp up, already in tune with Tony’s frustrations and desires.
The alpha had a firm hold on his arm, though and by the time Steve thought of something to say, something involving the authorities and omegas' rights, the alpha was dragging the younger man down the street and out of sight.
Tony laughed as he stood, walking over to the edge to peer over. “Don’t worry the stingrays are friendly!” he informed, before jumping into the water.
“Of course,” Steve replied, trying and failing to keep the hitch out of his voice.
For as long as Tony could remember, one thing remained the same: Tony Stark pushed buttons. Even in the middle of the boardroom, his focus collided with hundreds of different variables, he poked into every possible outcome. When they fought the super-villain of the week, he knew what to do. From board meetings to the battlefield, he constructed the plan.
“Except, you’re right.”
“We’re going,” Steve ordered, pushing out of his seat in the middle of a duet. When Steve pulled him to his feet, the plug shifted again. It was designed so expertly, to pinpoint the center of Tony’s pleasure, and the fact that Steve had made it--Tony moaned, stopping mid-stride as we willed away his orgasm.
Tony nodded, and Steve, who was shaking his hand on their behalf, smiled. “Please, Steve and Tony are fine alternatives. We’re out of uniform, after all.”
“You're mine,” he spoke low into the space between them. “And I’m yours.” Tony pressed his lips together and nodded, eyes torn between Steve and the collar. “Hand it to me.”
“Tony--!”
Pushing open the first door he saw, Steve found himself in a long, white hallway. He picked a direction at random and started to walk until he came to a bank of elevators. As he waited for the doors to open, he considered everything he knew about Tony and skyscrapers. Generally, the residences were on the top floors and he wouldn’t be surprised if the sole omega heir to the Stark fortune was nestled away, in a safe, in the very core of the building.
“I’m going to fuck you,” Steve growled, another finger entered and stretched. He bent over and tugged at the collar around Tony’s neck. When Steve spoke again, his breath puffed against Steve’s ear. “Full schedule today, have to call into couple mission debriefs, train with the spies, and I can’t even get out of bed without having you.” He slid in then, just the tip, and they both moaned in unison before Steve continued easing into him. “I want to fuck you all day. Know you’re here--waiting for me. Maybe,” Steve breathed, bottoming out. “Maybe tie you up pretty to the bed, slicked up and open for me.”
Tony’s hand stopped punching. “Can’t remember if I’ve ever had any other alpha say that to me before.” He started hitting again. “It’ll be painful, but if we wait it out, if I don’t see him for long enough--”
Unconcerned, Tony hummed, content to sit on this blanket in the sand, under the warmth of Steve’s arms, long after the storm rolled in.
“Marginally,” Coulson input under his breath.
SHIELD had set him up with an office when he first joined the organization. Steve found the sparse, white-walled space a general waste and had told Coulson as much; his place was on the field not in an office. But now, he was grateful. The office had a computer with a default password he’d never changed. It also connected directly to every file a Level 8 had access to. SHIELD had to have something on Stane, something they could use against him, something that he would want to keep private more than he wanted to keep Tony. Maybe if he willingly broke the bond--as much as blackmail was willing--Tony wouldn’t have to force a separation, they wouldn’t have to kill him.
He nodded and Tony did exactly as he promised. With his other hand, he lifted the camera and photographed their cocks sliding side by side. Steve’s pulsed under the camera’s attention.
Steve flushed, but did. Tony wanted him to come, wanted to give him pleasure and it looked so beautiful through the camera. Steve took one last photo, before letting it fall to the side. One more turn of Tony’s hand and they both fell over the edge.
“Yes, Tony,” he replied, automatically, and then blushed as he realized how that sounded.
“And that’s exactly why I’m going now. No one needs you to do this when someone else can.”
He stood there for a while admiring the way the water rolled over Tony’s shoulders as he swam laps down the pool. They were high above the streets and it almost looked like he was swimming over the city itself. When he reached the opposite end of the pool he turned and did a back stroke down the other end. Steve couldn’t look away from his abs, torso, chest, way more skin than he was expecting or prepared for. He had not worn enough scent blocker.
Barnes made an affirmative noise from the back of his throat and gestured to the knife, still stabbed into the drywall. “You can take that one.”
“Maybe they’re late? Though--” Steve’s eyes scanned the crowds for possible threats. “I thought they were all supposed to arrive together. We’ll ask the others when they finish greeting their fans.”
Steve chuckled. “Only if you claim it fair. I won’t let you win.”
When Wednesday finally came around, a pit formed in Steve’s stomach, one that hadn't been there before, one that felt like it could be good, excited, butterflies but then sometimes twisted into a foreboding ache; he’d overstepped. Tony would think him no better than Stane.
He whispered a spell and a small cut appeared, like it had over the false-shield. Tony held his breath as he watched the single bead of blood, his last chance, as it fell through the air until its
“Quick study, Cap.” Tony grinned, enjoying Steve’s narrowed gaze. “I mean, Professor.” Tony ignored what the honorific elicited in the naughtier sides of his mind and made himself focus. “I’d hoped there’d be something around here that belonged to my world, to create a link. And there was.”
“I guess making an impressive exit is a genetic trait.” Tony laughed and watched Anthony fly a figure eight in the sky. When he looked back at Steve, his eyes were still on Anthony, admiring but also assessing. The expression reminded Tony so fiercely of his Steve that in that moment, he almost wanted to call this whole thing off and find the shield and get back to him right away. But then the admiring in Steve’s expression tightened into pining, before slipping behind a blank expression and focusing on Tony, and Tony felt like staying had been the right idea.
Tony’s lips parted, his tongue darting out of its own volition to sneak a taste, even as he gasped in desperate lungfuls of air. Their eyes met and held, Steve panting down from his orgasm, finding their breath again, together. Tony knew what he must look like, come dripping down his cheek, flushed, lips swollen, chest heaving.
“After you, Captain.”
Coulson’s eyes narrowed. Steve knew the “modern world is very confusing” attitude would only work as a cover for so long, and he hoped he hadn’t passed its expiration date.
“Tony!” Steve lowered too, mind racing at possible solutions and he grabbed at the first one that he thought of. Fishing out his phone, he pressed the number to Phil Coulson and opened up their text messages. One handedly he used it to send Coulson their location and two words:
Every so often Tony would rub his hand up and down Steve’s thigh, his fingertips ghosting into the sensitive skin between his legs. The soprano sung, while Steve squirmed. He’d known what the toy was when Tony had offered it to him, but hadn’t thought about how one might feel inside him.
Tony did, stepping towards the doorway.
“I do,” the man replied.
. She shot Rhodey a look, pressing her lips together. Steve appeared to barely be aware of them, just as consumed by Tony. It was nice to see them both so relaxed.
Folding the sketch around the phone, Steve left the gift in the corner of the hallway, near the part that smelled the most of Tony. Then he turned around and left.
Steve didn’t need to hide anymore; they’d been caught. And now it was time for Stane to know who he was dealing with. He let his scent ooze into the room. Let him feel as violated as he made Tony, let him feel like his territory had been breached, and know that Tony was gone because of it.
Steve slammed open the stairwell door and ran into the hallway. It only took two steps in before he was blasted with the sour scent of Tony’s fear. Then he heard the shouting.
Tony smirked. “That’s nice to hear.”
Steve swore under his breath. “I can help.”
And now he clearly trusted Steve. Steve was more than trustworthy, but that didn’t change the fact that things between them had progressed quickly.
Tony went to dim the light and Bucky stood at the foot of the bed, arms crossed over his chest, assessing. The gesture made the muscles of his biceps dance under his bare skin, catching Steve’s focus. When Tony came back, he wrapped his arms around
The rage was back. Steve opened the laptop again, having to hold back from ripping it into two, useless, pieces, and started his search for an answer to that question.
It was his mother’s diary, sitting uninspired on a shelf in the corner that broke him. A strangled noise broke from his throat. He staggered, Tony’s arm shooting around his waist to settle him. With his closeness came his scent and a deep breath did just as much to settle him as the arm. “Steve, what is it?” Tony asked, obviously worried.
The panic swirled, morphing into shock and then a cold, endless, pit of fear. He’d lost so much already. He wasn’t ready to lose James too, not when they’d just found one another.
They turned the corner and Steve was face to face with a clothes rack full of his past: his Captain America cowl, his army uniform, his USO costume. His stuff was everywhere, boxes and bags of it, tucked away under his hanging clothes.
“Steve, you feel so good against me. That cock should be--fuck, oh yeah, grip like that--” Steve did, turning his wrist at the end of each stroke. “Fuck,” Tony continued. “Illegal. Your cock should be--” Steve’s hips jerked from the feel of his hand, Tony’s words burning under his skin, searing away the itch that had been building over the hours. His hand squeezed just a bit tighter and Tony cried out, come coating Steve’s hand and their cocks, pulse after pulse, and it was more than enough to make Steve fall over the edge with him, covering Tony’s cock with Steve’s own come before Tony’d even finished coming himself.
Tony continued through the Manhattan Project remnants, and Steve followed him over to a table where medals, awards, ribbons and plaques covered the entire surface. “Mother put this together for him.” Tony chuckled. “Father would’ve let it collect dust on the floor somewhere.” After a moment he turned to walk towards another cluster of objects, letting his hand drag along the edge of the table.

“Please,” Steve whispered under his breath. “Tony?” He traced his finger along his cheek, willing him to wake. Wanting it so desperately he hunched over the man, wings out behind him high in the sky. “Tony!” he shouted and the wings shot down in a single, loud beat. It reminded Steve of the burst that took Thor off his feet, but Tony remained secure in his arms. Then, his eyes shot open.
Tony didn’t answer immediately. When he did, his words croaked out, as if he hadn’t used his voice in a long time--Or, the sinister thought cut in, that Tony had screamed himself hoarse. “About thirteen days ago.”
Silence fell and neither of them said goodnight, just let the day fall away and sleep overtake them.
“It means he’s running late,” Namjoon explained before walking over with a few members to go say hi to a couple fans.
“Be careful with those–oh wait, can you even get drunk?” Tony asked, unfolding his blanket and sprawling out for a tan.
“It isn’t like that at all,” Anthony assured quickly; it was more than obvious that he didn’t want Professor Rogers thinking they were involved. After an awkward moment of silence, Anthony pulled out his wand and aimed it at Tony, who froze under it. Steve seemed surprised but not overly concerned.
Anthony smirked and said two words of Latin origin before Tony felt his whole face tingle.
“This is incredible, thank you for sharing it with me.” Steve didn’t much like war memorabilia, but he liked that Tony wanted to share it with him.
Tony pulled up next to him, wringing his hands as he watched Steve take in the room. He broke his hands apart and gestured towards the floor. “Personal artifacts of the Stark Family.”
People always assumed that would transfer to the bedroom, as well.
“But it could be anyone that they’d look at in the shapeshifters eyes, until they choose a new host,” Tony recalled from the briefing.
Another beat of silence. Tony turned his back to the books, so he faced the open, empty library that his mother had built. “Fertility. Arousal. Reactive and Active.”
“Vacation is about
The final chapter! Thank you so much to everyone who liked, commented, bookmarked and loved on this fic. It has been an absolute joy to share it with you. Thank you so much for reading! Come say hi over on
“That's SHIELD's,” Steve reminded.
He had to help this omega. Had to help Tony.
“Yes, Steve.” His voice was barely a whisper.
“What did you just do?” Tony touched his face, none of it felt familiar, making panic rise in his throat.
Steve swallowed hard around the astronaut food. He wouldn't be having any of these thoughts if he didn't know what it felt like to have Tony shift and roll his hips against his.
“Anthony Stark, Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.”
The mission was over. That usually meant they went their separate ways, decompressing before regrouping, but the Iron Man armor had been distracting during the battle and seemed to be after, as well. Steve had always found it impressive, but now, when he looked at it, he imagined the long hours Tony had put into making it, and it made him want to catalogue every detail himself.
Steve followed the order without hesitation. It felt like forever since Tony’s last order, his last touch. He had no idea what Tony had planned, but his uncertainty gave way to excitement.
Tony looked at Anthony, who nodded then back at Steve. “Ready?”
“You sound so sure.”
The evening steadily careened into bedtime like their ship making its way across the universe: inevitably and much too slowly. Every minute felt like a wait as Steve scribbled on a notepad he’d found in the cockpit and Tony took apart something that looked important and ended up back in the suit, just to fly around lazily, presumably out of boredom.
. But then (and now, he reminded himself) Steve had loved their time together too much to think straight. He wanted Tony all the time, in any way Tony chose to give himself. So he had kept falling into the pleasures of Tony, of him and Tony together, without seeing the risks.
“Suppressants?”
“I want to touch you,” Tony whispered in his ear, warm breath caressing his cheek.
Steve didn’t seem amused, instead he leaned in and ran a finger down Tony’s cheek, hooking it under his chin, lifting so Tony met his gaze. “What do you say, Tony?”

“Break the bond,” Tony could barely make out the words. “Either by forced, painful separation or….”
“Yes,” he breathed.
“I can keep you close to the ground, if you want.”
The driver remained silent, like they did every morning. The car started, and the low thrum of the morning news filled the small space as they wove through the city. He usually ignored the news. Most of it was half told narratives, biasly edited in a way that told whatever story they were trying to push. The real wars, the ones that happened off the morning news, he learned about in a SHIELD conference room and on the ground.
“Horcrux,” Anthony provided.
“Come on, Stevie, you have to let us help you,” Bucky implored from one side of the desk where Steve was
And Clint was trained too, his legendary aim didn’t end at his bow and arrows. He used it now to seek out and dig into the sensitive corners and crevices of James’ sides, stomach. Still, the man under his fingers didn’t wriggle away or try to knock away his hands, he did not laugh from Clint’s tickling.
Then there was a scream down the hall and the entire room tensed. Jungkook and Namjoon moved to stand, shoulders back and fists clenched to their sides, but the other members quickly pulled them back onto the sofas and gestured towards Tony and Steve. “No,” Jimin said in English. “Stay here. They go.”
“That’s what this is, isn’t it? You two were looking for a private place, ran into me, and now you’re looking for a way out to...canoodle.”
“Always putting on a show,” Steve mumbled under his breath, barely loud enough for Tony to hear it, but he did it with affection laced between the words.
On its shelves weren’t towels and sheets or clothes, but instead an array of sex toys--dildos and cock rings, some items Steve didn’t even known the name of. On the top shelf was a pile of lingerie, different colors and fabrics, and Steve’s mind unhelpfully put Tony in each of them, providing a perverse display of Tony being forced by Stane to show them off. He growled again, and this time Tony’s sharp inhale came from closer behind him.
Steve stood, wiping his palms on the pants he’d been wearing for over twenty-four hours. Instead of answering Tony, he moved towards the cupboard near the bed. There were plastic sealed bags full of white fabric and Steve grabbed one at random, hoping it was something to wear and not a spare blanket. Without turning back towards Tony, he left the small dormitory and walked towards the even smaller bathroom.
He scrolled through the years, the decades, of documents and found nothing of use, but the search results seemed endless. Frustrated, Steve tried not to squeeze the mouse too hard. A knock on his door made him loosen his fingers before he left any lasting damage. “Come in,” he said, retracting his fingers from the mouse.
to tell you, I--”
Tony sat.
Steve chuckled. “Individuals of every country are strong and curious–”
“I thought you were in the workshop this whole time!” To Tony’s left Steve laughed and Anthony snorted, Tony turned his head to look at them. “Who's there?”
Tony took one last deep sip of his coffee, before shifting his weight and swinging his plush office chair towards his computer monitor. The StarkChat they used for meetings had a preview of his face before he joined, and Tony used the reflection to fix his tie and check for any stray lovebites on his neck that he may have missed.
Steve kissed his head then lifted his Switch so they both could see. “And look.” Steve pointed to his house in the game. “When I sell more fruit or bugs or fish, I can pay off my loan, and then Nook adds a room to my house.”
When he finally pulled back, it wasn’t far, unable to get more than a few inches over Steve. His eyes were dark and his chest heaving; he sent Steve a sly smile that went straight to his cock. “Here I thought my devilish good looks could stop anyone, at any time.”
Tony caught his breath, eyes on Cap. The thought of their coffee date and how they linked arms flashed in his mind. When Steve finally turned back to him, whipping his helmet off, his hard gaze softened, and a yearning shot through Tony, brief but strong, to be back in Steve’s arms. “You all right?” Steve asked.
“It’s returned now,” Anthony assured. “It’s in my office, for now, and back to the headmaster after we resolve…” He waved his hand towards Tony.
The humor left Tony in an instant. “Are you not out--?” Tony was having an odd sense of deja vu.
No. He’d told a friend. Someone that he wanted to help and that was helping him. Steve wasn’t so oblivious that he hadn’t noticed the positive effects Tony had on him. After waking up in this century with everyone he knew from back then, a stranger now decades older; it was as if he was floating alone, a man out of time. But then Tony. The draw of him, yearning to get to know him, the will to help him, all of it was something that tethered him to the here and now. And Tony didn’t even know.
“You think I could fight this battle? Fight Obie?”
She had not been pleased by the rushed launch, and he couldn’t very well tell her about its true origins so instead he sent her back a couple links to purses and jewelry and shoes to choose from. He was just signing his name to the email when vibrations came to life between his legs. This time, instead of it coming from the plug it was the ring, wrapped tight around the base of his cock that made him gasp and smash his fingers against his keyboard.
Tony’s hand clenched around the tags, metal digging into his palm, cock straining in his jeans. He was so eager, desperate, there was nothing else in that moment but Steve’s words, and Steve’s eyes, and hunger.
“Fuck!” Steve shouted into his empty apartment, clamping his fingers in his hair and pulling. Hard. He had not planned for that to go the way it had. For one thing, he’d thought he’d find Tony alone. Which was stupid.
“Guess we'll have to renew my Friends of the Opera membership?” Tony guessed.
Then the man’s hand shot out, the impractical cape everyone seemed to be wearing lifting, to pull Tony through a stone framed doorway. The man’s hand gripped Tony’s shoulder hard, fingers pressing into his skin, and he held a polished, wooden stick with a carved handle to the center of Tony’s forehead.
There were no references of Tony in Stane’s documents, barely a mention of him in SHIELD’s files at all, though one bio Steve found had listed him as a potential asset. Steve wasn’t sure if that was good for Tony or not; Steve decided in that instant that he’d stand between the two if need be.
“This doesn’t seem like Kansas.”
“Tony, what are you doing?”
As soon as Stane had arrived at the hotel, he would have found Tony. It wasn’t hard to imagine him using his nose, just like Steve had done when he first went to the Tower. Steve had known Tony’s scent far less back then and still found him eventually.
Oh, thank god. That was the perfect distraction.
“Steve, come here.” Tony’s voice was soft, but Steve hopped to his feet and crossed the room to where Tony sat at his workbench. The surface was littered with delicate tools and scraps of metal. Tony held pliers in one hand and a delicate circle of metal in the other. He didn’t acknowledge Steve’s arrival, beyond lowering his voice further. “Do you trust me?”
Steve flushed, both at imagining Tony as his own, and at the perceived shame that he was going over his head or behind his back to be here. “He wanted to come, but because--”
Anthony turned back to him and pulled his wand out, aiming it right at his forehead.

This time something happened immediately, a sizzling noise followed by a hum that lifted the hair on his arms, he shot a glance at Steve and Anthony and they were dashing across the hut as Tony lunged forward, grabbing the stone then hissing as the heat emanating from it burned his palms.
“Anthony?” Steve laughed, surprised. “Of course not, he’s been flying since he was a child. Oh!” Steve blushed, looking embarrassed. “I forgot you aren’t from around here.”
“Yeah, I’m enjoying myself.”
Tony gestured for them to come over, watched his Steve’s face flash with surprise when he took them in.
Tony’s eyes were wide with fear when they swung towards Steve. He froze, then took one small step towards the corner of the hallway. Not towards his alpha, Steve noticed.

“....sure,” Tony replied. “In my world, my Steve uses it as a shield.” Tony may have imagined Professor Rogers’ breath catching at the word
“You just like my pretty words.”
that, because in this we are the same.”
“Of course not!” Steve shouted, the images of it all flooding Steve’s mind and it made his breath catch, his blood run hot, then boil over with the shame rooted in the flickering of arousal he felt, couldn’t help but feel at the fact that he too now knew what Tony’s slick smelt like: citrus and honey. Until Stane intervened and then Tony’s scent soured and wilted into something perverse and haunting. Arousal mixed with fear, distress.

Steve moaned as Tony bit a line over his collarbone, rolling his head on the small pillow they’d share the night before. Tony felt so good like this with Steve, but he’d have never even guessed it before. He knew the undeniable truth. “I needed--” he gasped at another brush of Tony’s lips on his chest, but barreled on, “the proximity. To know. To conceive of this--” he broke off as Tony fixated on one spot right above his nipple, sucking and biting and making Steve writhe under him.
Happy Wednesday!
Steve both wished and was grateful that Tony refused to take off his armor.
When they reached the limo, Tony slipped into the backseat, desperately hard, mind racing as he wondered what Steve’s plan was. What he didn’t expect was Steve sliding to his knees between Tony’s legs.
“There should only be four shapeshifters,” Steve whispered.
Tony held out his hands. Steve’s eyes danced as he slipped the cuffs around his wrists. Steve made sure a water glass, Tony’s phone, and his StarkPad were within arm’s reach before crouching back down next to Tony. His finger traced the collar, eyes heated, and Tony was distracted by the long expanse of naked skin, but also content to close his eyes when Steve told him too, stretching back into sleep.
“I want other things too,” Tony continued, and Steve’s focus left the man’s lips, moved over the bit of collarbone that peeked above his shirt, his long eyelashes that fluttered with every blink. But Tony wasn’t blinking now, instead he grabbed Steve’s chin, forced their gazes to meet head on. “I want to do so much with you. But for now, I’ll kiss you and touch you, whenever and wherever I want.”
The members returned as the screaming started again, so loud it cut off any chance for conversation. A few fans started to scream, “Jungkook!” so loudly Tony was worried they’d forever strain their vocal chords. Their friend next to them carried a sign with the name Park Jimin! on it and was waving it so hard it almost knocked over the barricade that separated them.
Steve ignored him, tugging the waistband with his teeth before rocking forward again to deliver another loud, sloppy raspberry. He broke off with a laugh of his own. “Well, when I had to shovel through a foot of snow to get to them, they certainly do.” He ducked his head and delivered another airy kiss.
Tony broke from the kiss with a gasp and
Minutes crawled on without anything. He was hard and aching in the pants Steve designed for him, the ones that showed nothing to anyone else. Only Steve knew, Steve who sat in the front seat with his legs spread, and Tony could see now, his hard cock pressing against the inseam. His hand was still there too, running up and down his hard, thick cock through his pants. Tony’s mouth watered, wanting. His body clenched around the plug, remembering the feel of Steve in him, just last night. His body wanted more, but all Steve seemed to want was to keep him on edge.
Tony obeyed, lifting the lid of the box until he could see inside. On a satin, plush pillow sat the design Steve had sketched and the collar rested softly on top of it.
He chuckled again and Steve closed his eyes, the sound rolling straight through his erection to land near where the plug nailed his prostate. “I’m not going to take you here, Steve. At least, not tonight.”
“Turn right,” Anthony interrupted. “And please stop. We’re about to see this man, well at least my version of him.”
Tony shook his head and lifted his knee onto the capsule, scooting over to the edge of it, next to the wall and back pressed to the mattress. “No complaints thus far, but you’re the one who managed to hijack my space mission.” Tony stretched out long leaving half the capsule for Steve. “So maybe my subconscious will be a bit vengeance-y.”
Tony heard Steve moan, then the hand on his jaw clenched, the gentle fingers turning harsh as they pried his jaw open. Before he had time to suck in a full breath, Steve’s hips pressed forward and Tony’s mouth filled with his hard cock.
“If you came on to me on planet earth, we could have utilized my humongous bed.”
A laugh broke from Steve’s chest. He pulled Tony close and kissed him again.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed.
Tony secured the knot of his Windsor tie and met his own gaze in the mirror. It was the final piece of his suit, tailored from Steve’s design to hug his shoulders and his ribs until it narrowed at the waist. While beautiful, it was not what required the special design. The pants, on the other hand, appeared fitted but along his upper thigh and between his legs, the seams allowed more room for Steve’s dastardly plans.
Steve clenched the phone in his hand, his mind screaming as loud as the incoming train.
Tony turned his head to take in the white sky, another snow storm just beginning to drop its first flakes over the balcony. “We can come back whenever you two want,” Tony told the sky, breath airy like he was making a confession. “I liked bringing you out here.”
“Sure,” Tony replied. “It’s distracting me enough from the internal pain, at least.”
He promised he wouldn’t be rash. He promised Tony. So he counted the days, the minutes until it was Wednesday again.
“Okay, I’ll take it. Where am I taking you?”
Tony’s heart raced as the pieces of the Iron Man armor formed around his skin. By the time they reached the end of the hallway, he was completely suited up. Next to him, Steve remained in his street clothes but his shield had miraculously appeared from a side hall closet.
Tony, of course, felt it and pounced. “What about you big guy?” He ground his hips forward, down, so that their cocks lined beautifully together. Steve had no idea if either of them expected the feel of it, Tony’s bare cock along Steve’s pants covered one, because they both swore and shuddered together.
Steve still sputtered.
“Can I put this on you?” Steve asked, terrified to touch him, to see Tony flinch from him again.
through a teasing smile. “Not all omegas have the flair for it. I mean, I do, but not about this. This was--” Tony pulled open the edges of his robe to soak a tan into his skin. The long span of his neck led to half his shoulder peeking out, below that for all the world to see were his dusty brown nipples. “Gosh, you’re an open book aren’t you. Even if you weren’t, your scent blockers aren’t nearly strong enough.”
When the moment softened and spread out but didn't break, Steve bent forward and pressed a kiss to the corner of Tony's mouth, enough cheek that they could write it off as friendship, enough lips that Tony could seize what Steve was offering but couldn't ask for out loud.
(See the end of the chapter for
And not just his chest. Tony was as affected as the rest of them by the summer heat. It was hard not to notice when he waltzed through the poolhouse, drink in hand, and somehow managed to disrobe into just a speedo without spilling a drop. A bead of sweat rolled down his back, twisting between the muscles. It looked like something out of a painting, the sun catching the glow of it as he led them outside.
“Open it.”
“Excuse me?” Anthony looked at him like he was insane. “It doesn’t belong to me.”
He pushed away from the door and went back to his apartment. Sitting on the couch, he stared at his hands and wondered what he would have done if Tony believed him about being Captain America. Would he come to believe him? He just blurted it out. The biggest secret of his life, and Steve just told a near stranger.
Tony dropped his head. “I didn’t pass the Reactive portion. At least, not suitably enough.”
The inner foyer was empty, but there were signs of life coming from hallways and what appeared to be a great hall towards his left. Tony turned right, and found a narrow hallway with a small staircase that he took up to the second floor, halfway up it the staircase started to vibrate and move. Tony froze, hand gripping the railing hard until the stairs connected to another hallway and stopped moving entirely.
“Anthony,” Tony called. “I think I found something.”
“Everything okay?” Tony smirked as he accepted the drink Steve presented. “You look a little flushed.” His voice had turned smooth and silky. Tony’d been watching him, had been for a while now, and his gaze burned with a challenge...or was it a flirtation? Steve’s blush only deepened, now feeling held in place by his words alone.
Then he reached floor ninety and the doors opened to two voices that sounded very much like they were trying to be quiet but failing miserably.
“Debatable.”
These Thursday mornings had become the longest day in Steve's week. It was the day after his every-other-Wednesday visit, and the day furthest from seeing Tony again. Still, the man completely occupied his thoughts. At SHIELD, Coulson had to call him twice before he was able to hear him and turn around.
Tony winked and continued his phone call.
They navigated from the courtyard to a large field. “This is penance. Karma. For everyone I’ve ever sassed.”
Steve froze under the harsh abuse, momentarily overcome by how quickly and fiercely Stane tried to bring Tony down. But next to him, it was as if Tony came to life. A roared, “No,” ripped from his lungs and he surged forward, hands outstretched. “You’re wrong, Obie!” he shouted right into the man's face. “You know
But it didn’t matter. He couldn’t do anything. Tony was gone.
Steve felt his cheeks heat at the thought, at how wrong it was.
Chef Ana’s brow pinched, but she kept the bag, slid it into her apron pocket and patted it through the fabric as she took in Steve. “Yes,” she finally said. “He does. I’ll make sure my husband gets it. Edwin can pass it to him.”
“Yup,” Tony said. “My two boys, chocolate candy, and snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes–these
“Good.” Tony pressed the release and the arc reactor popped forward. “Take it out.”
Steve was spiraling; he had to grip the railing when he stumbled into the elevator, and even that didn’t stop his knees from buckling. All Tony’s friends within the Tower, Ana and probably Mr. Jarvis, too, were gone. What did it mean?
“Artificial knotting.” Tony walked away, towards the next bookshelf over. He slid his fingers and pulled out a book, tossed it over to Steve without warning. He caught it anyway and in his hand he read that it was a book about the exam. “Since you seem so interested,” Tony sneered.
Tony nodded, tried not to shuffle on his feet.
Space travel felt like being on a submarine. The only safe place was inside the ship, and sometimes inside felt less than friendly as well. Tony kept avoiding Steve's gaze, muttering under his breath, and using the suit to fly around the ship despite the gravity pressurizing.
Stane never saw Tony as anything more than a fuck toy and now he’d never see Tony again, if Steve had any say about it.
“Oh how generous,”
With the lights down low, Jungkook blaring a solo ballad and Steve next to him, it almost felt like a date. Tony wanted to make it one. Linking their arms, he smiled when Steve looked down at him, eyes soft. He appeared to want to make it a date as well.
It wasn’t until the middle of the second act that Tony realized Steve hadn’t been entirely forthcoming with his plan, because he’d been waiting for what felt like hours, on edge and clenching, for vibrations that never came. Then a cellist led the strings into the next aria, and it happened, the plug jolted to life, as a smug smile crossed Steve’s face.
“Is that what brought you here?” Anthony’s brow furrowed, so similar to his own when he was deep in thought. “The portal?”
He tried to turn over, wanting more, but hands stilled his hips. “Stay,” Steve ordered, before spreading his ass to lick over the sensitive, puckered skin. Tony groaned, nuzzling his face into the pillow as Steve teased him with his tongue.
James wouldn’t hurt hum.
“One is already on its way, sir.”
are a few of my favorite things. Don’t worry, Steve,” he turned back to face the sky, still making his way through the chocolate piece. “We’ll be back soon.”
Over the ocean, in the far off distance, lightning lit up a gray cloud. Tony shifted on the blanket next to Steve, not quite ready to go inside from their impromptu picnic just yet. The wind picked up and made him curl further into the warmth of Steve’s arm, where it was wrapped around Tony’s waist.
Stony + raspberry, snow, flowers for jehbeeeh
Tony obeyed. He tasted a swipe of precome along his tongue and then Steve was pushing further into his mouth. Above him, tension drained out of Steve with each thrust. The angle was tough but it only made Tony want to try harder, to twist his tongue along the tip of Tony’s cock, to relax his jaw so the next stroke hit the back of his throat.
“Do you speak English?”
“Fuck!”
“Lucky for me, then.” He reached out for Tony, who managed to half-step, half-leap off the stage and into Steve’s arms. “Lead the way.”
Steve grabbed his bag and closed up his apartment. A driver in a crisp suit jumped out of the car that waited at the curb and walked around to open the door for Steve.
It was like time froze while his mind ramped up to triple speed. He’d hit his head, the students waving at him, the hum of the ring in his hands. Magic. Concussion. Disturbingly familiar disturbed eyes, wide and piercing with shock and question.
Wait. There were only five of them.
Tony remained silent in front of him, but eventually he brought his gaze up, met Steve’s for a brief instant, before returning back to his broken and bloody hands.
“Didn’t think you’d want this,” Tony whispered, almost as if to himself, as he let his hands resume their tantalizing explorations. His nail caught on the corner of Steve’s nipple, the other hand leaving his chest to run up his neck. Steve could barely focus.
So simple, but it sent a thrill through him; Steve was constructing a plan of his own.
Steve made an offhand excuse about a special delivery then rushed through the room, pushing open the swinging silver door and moving into the hallway. Chef Ana’s office was across the hall, the door slightly ajar but the light off. He pushed the door open. It was entirely empty of all her personal items; all that remained was an empty desk and bookcase, a pile of folders and an office plant. Steve moved to the folders and pushed aside the top one, on the top of the second one was a postit with three words on it:
“Tony!” Steve shouted.
Everything was white for a moment, his hearing fogged, eyes closed, and then the sound of clapping broke through and he rolled his head up to glare at Steve in the front row, who was giving him a standing ovation. The vibrations had not ceased.
