“I don’t,” He replied continuing his brisk stride out the front door, stepping over Angus at the bottom of the stairs.
“I do help people you know, byproduct of catching serial killers and all manner of criminals.” Sherlock said, in response to Lestrade’s tirade. “You do remember my first case…”
John grimaced as he put weight on his leg, “Just a little further, Hyperion, look, I’m hurting too.” Hyperion nuzzled him when John said he was hurting, his feeling of concern overriding the general malaise. Hyperion didn’t want John to be in pain any more than John wanted him to be. “It’s okay, it’s not too bad, we just need to get you feeling better and I’ll feel better, alright?”
“Yes. I want you to take those bandages off and let the wounds air out tomorrow, and, if you can, wash them.” She glanced down at his sling, “er, better yet ask someone to help. Please don’t let him lay in the sand after that, don’t want to muck up those injuries again. Other than that, make sure he gets up and walks around at least a couple times every day, a couple laps around the room and a few wing stretches, nothing too strenuous,” she recited, pointing out the wide ring around the sand pit for Hyperion’s path.
“They’re clean, brand new, just put them on.” John heard the door next to his open and Sherlock’s bare feet leaving.
“I-I can’t climb, bum arm, see,” John flailed for an excuse not to get into that saddle, moving his injured arm and hissing as he rotated it too far and too fast and a spike of pain flashed through the shoulder. Bellamy’s head was curled back next to them in an instant. Sherlock bent and grabbed one of John’s legs forcing him to put a foot up,
“No, no, don’t. I’m okay Hyperion,” he said, as the nose pushed him a bit across the sand. Feelings of happiness at his statement fluttered across the bond as the dragon rose to sit back on his haunches, freeing the use of his forearms. John attempted to sit up and return to his feet but found himself stuck like an overturned turtle as his good hand slipped out from under him in the sand. A large talon reached out and carefully scooped John up. The paw, shaped similarly to a hand, let the sand run away and left John lying in its soft-scaled grip. John settled back onto his feet, the giant paw a wall behind him to lean on as he gained his balance.
“I actually do find you attractive as well, so you can stop all the looks and the crises,” Sherlock added, finishing with the leg at hand.
“I’m sorry John,” Sherlock repeated sounding so very sincere, cuddling John close as possible. John could feel the fear squirming in Sherlock’s mind. Now that John was safely back at Baker Street the emotions that Sherlock had no doubt been suppressing were starting to show. Fear was one of the many that played across Sherlock’s mind, but it was certainly becoming the most prominent as time passed between them.
Sherlock laughed, “Like they were the first ones to ever do it, those restrooms have seen so much sex over the centuries you could fill volumes, but what has you so flustered, hmmm? It was a pair of men possibly, one on his knees-”
“If you could just leave it over by the door, I’ll come get it,” John called, as Hyperion shifted his head and put himself between John and her.
“She was telling the girls at the table this morning, said ‘that new rider, he was bathing with his dragon and flashed me!’ the rest of the ladies got a real laugh out of it.” Tom affected a higher voice for the steward’s, laughing.
“I know,” John chuckled as Sherlock squeezed him, “but you do seem to have an affinity for my human looks.” With a playful feeling John let Sherlock see a mental image of himself primping and preening like a human starlette just for Sherlock. John was immediately amused by the faint budding arousal from Sherlock’s mind at receiving John’s imagined poses.
John hobbled across, cane in hand. Hyperion sat waiting for him on the other side of the door, not nearly as energetic as Bellamy but no less happy to be allowed to go out and walk outside with John. The doors opened and Hyperion gingerly got to his feet and walked through them. John could feel Hyperion’s happiness at being out and about, it was similar to the feeling of getting out of class and going to recess as a kid, or leaving a stuffy office building on a sunny day and going for a walk in a park. Hyperion let out a large sigh and gave a small aborted stretch of his wings, obviously wanting to give a good full stretch but his injuries and the size of the hall prevented him from doing so.
“I’m sorry, I think I’ll stay on the ground,” John said, grabbing his cane and limping away towards the water fountain.
“I’m fine, Mrs Hudson, nothing worse than some soreness” John replied honestly; he really hadn’t sustained any damage throughout the day’s adventures, a fact he hadn’t really noticed until Mrs Hudson had asked.
“Just a sedative; keeps the dragons from moving around too much during the flights. It wouldn’t do too well for the dragon up top with that much weight shifting suddenly,” Lestrade explained, moving past him to lay a hand on Hyperion’s snout, petting him as he walked past his head towards the coiled body in the crate. “Oh, they did a number on you didn’t they?” he mumbled to himself, looking at the large bandages that swathed the area below Hyperion’s wing and the ones that curved up onto his back from the hip wound on his other side.
“I suppose you’d know,” he said, and John noticed him finally looking at him out of the corner of his eye. It was a brief glance, and then the blue wandered back to the field and Aerie before him. “While we’re on a tear with these confessions I’ll admit I am lacking in recent experience with either of those things on an interpersonal level.”
“Tonight I’ve watched a man literally turn into a shark in front of me. I’ve been manhandled by a woman who is also a fucking shark of some kind in human form. I have fallen from a moving vehicle, which if you haven’t noticed, happened while nude. I have been shot at, and I have come about this close to having my brain splattered across the aquarium wall by that same murderous shark woman, who is named
“The same thing: I’m out of the country on important business for my brother, that explanation is enough,” Sherlock said, leaning back in his chair and giving a good long stretch.
So stay John did, relaxing with Hyperion, talking about the day as the ceiling overhead turned darker shades of purple. As night descended he got up and turned on the lights, subtle things, no blinding flood lights just soft light lamps mounted on the walls providing a white-yellow glow to the room.
“Already? You just got in this morning.” Mrs Hudson had her doors open at the bottom of the stairs. John caught a glimpse of Angus, staring wide eyed and fixated on the television, a bowl of leafy greens between his forearms. Mrs Hudson was in the hall with Sherlock, “I hope you’re not overworking, Bell worries about you, I know she does.” Sherlock paused in his passing to look at Mrs Hudson. He leaned down and gave her a quick hug and peck on the cheek.
“Of course, dear, from what I’ve heard I don’t hold it against you, make sure you grab something warm to wear, don’t want to catch a cold,” she said in understanding motherly tones. John couldn’t help smiling.
She snarled again, but did back up before she crushed him. “Just stay here. I’ll bring him to you.” She hissed at him but backed away like he ordered.
“Sherlock, he went out earlier and I just got texts from him with instructions on how to find him and that he has found the killer he’s been tracking.” There was a long moment of silence on the other end. Meanwhile Bellamy had decided to start moving towards John.
A sudden gust at the top of the tower got under John’s collar and reminded him of how cold it was outside, the tip of his nose was growing number as were his ears, lovely as the whole scene was, even the little portable heater behind them wasn’t quite enough to combat the frigid weather forever. John was just about to suggest they go back inside, time to go home for the night.
“You keep saying ‘his type.’ What is he, if you don’t mind me asking?” John asked after taking a bite out of a half unwrapped egg salad sandwich he’d picked up from the now open counter.
He was left to follow along behind them. Hyperion’s limp was less pronounced than it had been before although it was still there. John could feel it faintly in his own thigh, but it was certainly healing. He’d have a mild limp for the rest of his life, at least that’s what Molly had told John, but he got along just fine next to Bellamy as they walked. Sherlock was up in his saddle, all good posture and handsome coat fanning out behind him onto Bellamy’s back. Bellamy was poised and looking elegant with her silvery hide reflecting the slightly overcast clouds like a grey cloak. And John was trudging along on the ground nearby, feeling a little out of place for reasons he couldn’t quite articulate.
There was a sigh on the other end, “He also wrecked parts of a college, interrupted an active crime scene, completely ignored his assignments for the day, and forced a, no offense but, completely untrained rider to take a dangerously unstable dragon out of the Aerie.”
Tom came and went and Hyperion settled again after walking to the door for Tom to feed him instead of sitting stationary on his mat. He’d irritated his leg and shoulder to the point John felt the keen sting in his leg and good shoulder. Mrs Hudson came upstairs with Angus to ask if he’d like to accompany her to lunch and John agreed since he needed to find the cafeteria until he could manage to stock the cabinets and fridge with actual food.
“Why here then? We could have had a Christmas-y dinner back at the flat too, indoors by the fire,” John asked. It wasn’t accusatory, simply curious about Sherlock’s thoughts. Sherlock sat quietly for a moment; John could see that he was thinking.
“Ah, John, please,” Sherlock gasped holding that arc in an attempt to gain more from John, more touches, more pleasure, just more.
John let loose a mental moan, giving in and reaching out with tendrils of his own to twine with Sherlock’s. “You know I’d love to, love,” he giggled lightly as they continued with their ‘love love’s’ and Sherlock’s mind let go a strong wave of lustful feelings in response.
“There, that wasn’t so hard was it?” she said, reaching up to scratch the opposite side of his head from John. “Just a couple more quick checks and you’ll be all done.” Hyperion groaned again his eyes shifting to stare at her. Molly asked Lestrade to bring her a step stool as she moved in front of Hyperion’s snout and said “Aaaah,” opening her mouth for him to see. John backed away a few steps as Hyperion sighed and opened his mouth good and wide for her, his black blue tongue sliding out of its sheath. She took a flashlight out of another pocket and shone it down his throat moving around his head as she checked the inside of his gaping maw. She pulled out another pair of gloves and checked under his lips and around his teeth, checked his tongue and and its sheath and the hole above it that flexed with every breath Hyperion took. “Missing a few teeth, but otherwise fine. Close,” she said with a smile, peeling off the gloves while Hyperion snapped his mouth shut.
Sherlock continued to sulk for the rest of the week. He’d still settle in next to John when he got tired and he’d stay near John when they were fish, but Sherlock would be grumpy about it and act like he didn’t want to and make excuses for why he decided to use John as a pillow. John watched Sherlock shuffle through his case e-mails and become flustered by his inability to go to the ones that looked genuinely interesting. His heart went out for Sherlock, he knew after weeks living with him how easily bored Sherlock got, the new discovery of being able to occupy his mind with the coding had been wonderful. John still fondly remembered the kisses Sherlock had showered on him.
John noticed Jim staring after them, the poor ex-rider had gone missing for nearly a week after Sherlock’s classroom interruption and two weeks on he still hadn’t returned as a teacher. But since Moran’s arrival and their somewhat odd reunion, John had spotted the pair in the cafeteria together, which was strange in its own right considering John had never really seen Jim without a flock of nestlings nearby.
“Your gills are gone,” John remarked quietly, hand finding Sherlock’s and meshing their fingers together, “and the webbing.”
“I’m sorry. Was trying to check on Sherlock. Making sure he is OK. I am with Hyperion like I was told to do.” John replied.
He picked up his kit and started out towards the shape, watching carefully for signs that it might be a trap of some kind.
The glow began to leave her skin from tail to head, new marks stopped shining and revealed silvery sleek fur, her cries emerged as guttural barks from a blubbery throat and the eyes were last, the blue glow faded from them leaving behind dark black orbs.
John went back to consoling Hyperion as Molly climbed up to check the wound. She went through the process again of stripping away the bandages, these tinged with blood even though once unwrapped there were no broken stitches. Hyperion’s eyes squeezed shut, and John felt the muscles tensing as Hyperion cringed. The wound looked awful, a mess of black stitches covering the area, and dark red blood still oozing forth trying to crust and scab between the sutures. When John had seen it in the field it had been packed with sand and an angry red with inflammation and blood, three distinct crescents ripped into Hyperion’s hide. This looked so much worse and upon seeing it John’s heart clenched hard for Hyperion.
John walked to the body and pulled in the parachute still billowing in the dying sunlight. He wrapped Victor’s corpse in the fabric and used the cords to drag him behind as he walked. John only made it a few steps like that before he felt his burden lessen and turned to see Hyperion as delicately as he’d ever seen, pick up the bundle with his mouth and gently lay it across his own shoulders.
“The eggs, the marks on the woman’s hands and arms indicate she is an egg caretaker. Most dragon eggs need to be kept at higher temperatures in order to hatch. They also need to be turned and moved, meaning a caretaker will eventually bear the marks of prolonged working in such an environment: tougher hands, old burn marks; judging by her age she’s been at her post for years.”
“He should, yes, but he’s going to have to basically relearn how. The scarring and damage to that shoulder will make it harder to stay in the air for long amounts of time, and the strain of slowing his descent for landing will be where it hurts the most.” Molly told him quietly, as if she didn’t want Hyperion to hear about what pain he would be in for permanently. “The hind leg isn’t going to help either, he’s going to have to learn how to land on that without the leg crumpling under his weight. He will have some amount of a limp for the rest of his life because of that one.”
“Pluto,” Sherlock repeated, gaze flicking to the objects in John’s hands and feeling a small anticipatory shiver of his own run up his spine.
John didn’t look back once he reached Hyperion’s doors. He stepped in and was met right away by Hyperion’s nose. Said dragon had been waiting for him sitting next to the door, aware that his rider was coming and they’d be going outside soon. But Hyperion was also aware of the tiff John and Sherlock had had out in the hallway, so close in proximity. John had never really done much in the way of shielding Hyperion from his own thoughts or cutting him off, and so Hyperion, if he fancied, could pick up on John’s thoughts and emotions easily, something that John had become aware of that had been lacking in his bond with Victor.
For the moment though, after a very long and stress filled night, they finally slept. Sherlock stayed covering John as they both drifted towards sleep. Whispered ‘I love you’s’ were exchanged repeatedly until John’s mind finally cycled down into exhausted sleep, followed closely by Sherlock who finally pulled an afghan across them. And there they lay on the sofa, sun streaming through the tall windows of 221b, light barely penetrating the wooly cover over them.
“Other than the fact that saddling me with you keeps me out of the way and on the ground as much as possible? Along with the added bonus of not setting anything on fire,” Sherlock said.
“I get a feeling Mycroft is going to be cleaning up fish for a while,” Sherlock said, directing John to look down at the floor where at least a couple of sharks lay surrounded by the tatters of clothes.
“But you have a palace. And she can visit it?” John was a little bemused by the concept, but the news that Sherlock hadn’t been completely cut off from Bellamy over the last few days was a reassurance.
, brother of mine,” replied Sherlock from his place behind his chair, his voice colored with venomous loathing.
John looked away at that, face heating a little. He wasn’t particularly mortified by the comment, just mildly shocked by the bluntness of it.
“I’m at Roland-Kerr Further Education College. I need you or someone from the Aerie here, now; Bellamy is on the warpath. Bring police too.” John didn’t wait for a reply before hanging up the phone and taking off into the halls of the school.
“She will be his support if he has trouble walking,” Sherlock said as Bellamy gently lifted her wing out of the way and pressed her shoulder to Hyperion’s. The pair began walking, John walking along between them. John could see the two dragons sharing subtle body language and his bond made him privy to Hyperion’s thoughts: gratitude, a hint of shame at needing the help, an all encompassing joy at being out, and underneath it all an incredibly faint feeling of adoration, the kind that made John himself want to lean into Bellamy and rub his face on her smooth scales if he concentrated on it too hard.
They landed at the central airfield, touching down with a soft whump into the grass. John was pressed down as close to their mount as possible, eyes squeezed shut, breathing hard, as he hung onto Anthea’s belt with his good arm and made an attempt at gripping a handful of saddle padding with the other. Once they’d landed Anthea turned to him with a light ‘hmph,’eyebrows raised. He released his grip with a small apology and she unclipped his tether, allowing him to carefully slide off to the ground in the most calm dismount he’d had all day.
As always I love getting comments and kudos, please leave some if you liked the fic. Thank you for reading and giving this one a try. :)
“A case, there’s a light splash pattern of mud up the back of her left leg, a rolling case!” Sherlock darted out of the room into the hall franticly looking for something.
“Don’t be. Let me tell you a secret.” He whispered, “I’ve had war veterans like you so bad they couldn’t feed their dragons, even with therapy. The blood, you see, they couldn’t stand to look at the blood and have it covering them. I’ve figured out how to get around it so they can share feedings with their dragons again like they want.” Tom smiled, backing away again, “If I can help them with their problems the others here at the Aerie can help with yours. Just give them a chance, alright?” John swallowed and nodded, starting to feel drained from the combined stresses of the feeding and his brief outburst.
“What have you told them?” John asked, licking his lower lip and glancing at the rest of the table, who’d resumed their own conversations, Mrs Hudson sneaking Angus a bit of egg left on her plate.
“No, no! Its alright, I’m covered,” John said, head and shoulders the only things out of the unfortunately clear water. Her fingers parted, peeking at him before determining it was safe and dropping her hand to hold the lunchbox with both arms.
“What have I done to merit that?” John said when they finally separated, a little breathless but no less happy for the attention.
“Doctor! Someone get a doctor over here, now!” He was being lifted out of the talons, the pain in his shoulder flaring again as he was moved. As he was placed on what felt like a stretcher he passed out again, the world blurring out and blackening.
“My, you do become very loyal very quickly,” the man said. His steely blue eyes wore the same look Sherlock had the night before, calculating, deducing, appearing to be able to read John like an open book. “Your former commanding officers said you were loyal, to a fault. Of course, what man with a wounded dragon runs towards the gunfire? One so loyal to his comrades he would die for them even though there is nothing left to save. Brave, that’s what they called it. What is bravery but another word for stupidity?”
“We won’t fall, I assure you, we’ve made this flight hundreds of times perfectly safe, and if we do fall there is a parachute in that cubby I showed you. The emergency switch to open the door is in the little glass case near under the light switch, but you won’t need it at all. If it makes you feel safer you can put it on for your own peace of mind, but I assure you nothing will go wrong and everything will be fine,” he told him, returning to help John sit down again. “ Hold onto your dragon, he’ll help calm you down, I’m sure of it.”
Sherlock’s mind began to wander, not focusing on much of anything, other than the feeling of the rope on his wrists, the blindfold’s fabric against his cheeks, and the bed sheets against his still hard cock. He rutted his hips gently against the bed, trying not to move as much as possible, but wanting that little bit of increased stimulation. He didn’t realize John had moved, so focused on the small pings of pleasure he was getting, until there was suddenly breathing next to his ear again and John’s voice, gravelly with arousal.
John let out an exasperated groan. “Sherlock,” he grumbled even as he followed. The area beyond was much bigger than the average dragon pit: wall-to-wall sand covered the floor with a small walkway of stone around the edge. Stepping beyond the door felt like stepping into a whole new environment, from the cold weather outside to an almost desert-like warmth and dryness inside. The ceiling was completely covered in white canvas, no holes at the edges for any heat to escape or rain to get in. The entire space was surrounded by a long, continuous balcony of gallery seating. Sherlock walked around the edge underneath to a door in the wall.
John knelt on the bed beside him, and Sherlock turned to look at John’s almost naked body. John was wearing his ridiculous red pants, and Sherlock had an up close view of exactly the effect he was having on John, his erection straining against the confining material. John leaned forward over Sherlock, beginning to bind his wrists together before tying them to the slats of the headboard above. Sherlock took the opportunity to be a little disobedient, and pushed his head up to lick a wide stripe across the front of John’s pants. John startled and shuffled away, tapping Sherlock on the arse quickly as punishment.
“I’ve noticed,” Sherlock replied with a chuckle that made John want to hug him even closer just to feel more.
A small glimmer caught his eye in the dim blue light of the hall, the knife, the handle at the top of her boot. His eyes flicked to it only briefly before focusing again on the muzzle in front of him, ready to blow him away. John watched her stand there for a moment, her nostrils flared as though she could smell the fear rolling off of John’s skin. Sebbie’s scarf had become dislodged during their chase and John watched thin lips open in a smile, revealing slightly pointed teeth, just like the shark men’s.
In the moment of quiet John suddenly realized what he’d just said. He’d said he loved Sherlock. He hadn’t even told Sherlock that to his face yet. A shrinking feeling squeezed John’s heart at the thought that if he didn’t manage to get Sherlock back to the aquarium before dawn he might never get to tell him.
“Eggs!” Sherlock shouted back, hurrying out the door as he stripped off the latex gloves he’d used to examine the woman’s body.
John thought. He slowly opened the smaller door and looked in. There Hyperion was, curled up in a ball on his mattress, but he didn’t look happy and the room was a mess. Sand scattered out of the central pool from large gouges around the edge, palm fronds knocked loose littered the floor, Hyperion’s mattress was skewed away from the wall and partially sitting on the sand pool. Hyperion’s face was a picture of upset where he was curled breathing harder than normal.
The barrel of the gun nudged his temple, snapping him out of his thoughts. “Got you,” Sebbie said quietly, grinning wide at him. And then the gun clicked, John flinched, and his life flashed before his eyes, his last thought being that he never got to kiss Sherlock again and say goodbye.
“It’s okay love.” John felt like Sherlock was about to have a mild breakdown on top of him if he didn’t curb the spiral of fear. “I’m alright.”
John realized then how strange they must have looked, Sherlock sprawled on his front with John straddling him and pinning him down from behind.
“John don’t talk to me like an infant,” Sherlock interrupted, any lassitude gone as he squirmed out of John’s grip.
John went to bind the other man, only to find the tartan scarf had been ripped to the point of unusability, so he pulled his own striped scarf off and used it instead. One of the cashiers gasped when they saw John’s neck.
“Sherlock, I need you to listen to me. You are fine. You are in 221b Baker Street in London. You are safe, and I am here with you.” John told him calmly as tears continued to run down the planes of Sherlock’s face, his eyes still glazed over as his frightened sobbing and shaking continued. John let go of Sherlock to reach for the duvet bunched up at the foot of the bed; he threw it over his still naked curled form, keeping his head uncovered. He threw on his pants again and sat down at the head of the bed. Sherlock recoiled the moment he saw the red underwear, pulling away and beginning to hyperventilate.
The jerking movements slowly tapered off, the up and down didn’t go away completely, but the severity of the motion did. John lay panting on the mats next to Hyperion, shaking hard.
“Later,” John reassured, turning into the connecting kitchen which was its own unique brand of messy. Laboratory equipment was strewn across nearly every flat surface, with a microscope sitting dead center.
The blue light glowed even brighter and John suddenly remembered what Sherlock had told him he’d seen before he became a fish: dark hair and a blue light. John could almost hear a dull hum in the air, a dark droning noise like nothing he’d ever heard before, and the light suddenly arched away from the book. Like a finger of electricity from a coil, it jumped from the book to the man’s forehead and engulfed him. With a single wailing scream the man disappeared into a massive ball of blue light, not that he was engulfed in it but his very edges seemed to warp and blur looking less humanoid by the second. His form became spherical for a shrieking moment before parts elongated and stretched, and the scream died till only the hum was left. The light began to dim and all that was left in the space the man once occupied was a fully formed, writhing, grey-skinned, shark.
“Sarai, her name is Sarai, you’ll be seeing her hatchlings shortly after the first of the year. I am Josie and I know all about you, young war doctor just came in with Hyperion, you’re still learning. Him though,” she shrugged at Sherlock, “He’s got a past breaking in over here. I expect an apology from you, young man!” She raised her voice at Sherlock, making the rider finally look at her. “Both to me and one for Sarai as you leave,” Josie finished with a very motherly huff.
John picked up his own box containing meaty ravioli and began eating as well, and the dinner continued on. Their fingers brushed in a moment when they both reached for the bread at the same time. At one point Sherlock sucked his spaghetti in and accidentally managed to flip a noodle up onto his nose. Before he even really thought the action through John had reached out with a paper napkin and wiped the sauce off Sherlock’s nose for him. Sherlock’s eyes crossed where John’s finger stopped mid-wipe at the bridge of his nose and John quickly retracted the napkin with a small embarrassed cough.
Ah, his dragon. John hadn’t seen any scaly corpses nearby, maybe it was captured? Though that was highly unlikely, since dragons usually defended their riders to the death.
“Touch him again, and I’ll toss you out myself,” John said darkly from the kitchen doorway, skin reflecting his tone as an extremely angry maroon color. Lestrade only rarely ever saw John turn that dark of a color but he certainly knew what it meant. Mycroft was overstepping bounds. even though the brown spot was already fading from Sherlock’s skin, the fact that it was there at all was enraging to John as Sherlock’s mate. Mollisians didn’t touch like Mycroft just had. Sure, they brushed each other like humans do sometimes in passing, but as a whole they tried not to whenever necessary and to forcefully touch another like Mycroft had, hard enough to transfer color, it just wasn’t done.
“I may not appear to have ears Lestrade but I can still hear you, you don’t need to shout,” a baritone voice said from the mouth, as the jelly blob began to stretch upwards.
“Well, just a warning, sip this stuff,” John said, taking the wrapping off the top before looking dumbly at the cork. “We don’t have a corkscrew.”
he told himself, shaking his head and turning back to the sitting room, cables clenched tightly in his fist. He sat in his chair waiting for Sherlock to return, all the while trying to scrub wholly improper thoughts about his flatmate’s enviable physique from his brain.
“Stuff sets him off all the time, he’ll probably take a day or two off and come back again like he usually does,” a boy sitting a couple seats down said, garnering a handful of murmured assents from the rest of the class sitting at the large round table.
John patted his leg, “yeah, I know,” he said tamping his own volatile reaction to feeling inferior down and pushing better feelings across the bond, affection, positivity, affirmations, “you’re doing good.” He added.
“Honestly? Yes, I wanted to let her out. But she also needs a bit of a soak, and Hyperion does need assistance, why not take advantage of that situation in order to satisfy another one?” Sherlock asked, looking down at John from his perch on Bellamy’s shoulders. John just smiled at the thinly veiled attempt to make what Sherlock was doing sound purely selfish.
John’s mouth formed again, “not going anywhere soon, apologies,” John replied, the bulk of him shifting to bump Sherlock.
“Yes, now would you kindly inform me what happened last night, since my brother isn’t divulging himself.” Mycroft stepped back a pace or two as John attempted to sit up again, rubbing slick hands over his face, before looking down at his now slightly webbed fingers.
John’s phone buzzed in his pocket the moment he closed the door. A text popped up on the screen, “Come home if convenient. SH” it read.
Sherlock’s hand shot out to grab his arm however, stopping him and making John look back. In the pale light John could just make out Sherlock’s face and his features looked worried. He wasn’t saying anything just looking at John like he was about to go walking back to the war. The hand dropped away as though Sherlock had just realized what he’d done and was ashamed.
Sherlock was nice and relaxed. The sounds from him hitched and turned into a groan at the initial breach. The hot clench of him only served to make John’s arousal flare, he’d been so focused on pleasuring Sherlock that he’d nearly forgotten about himself. He pressed upwards into that heat and with doctorly precision rubbed right over Sherlock’s prostate.
“He’ll be a tutor,” Mycroft finally said, making all five of the others look up at him. John saw a rather wicked smirk spreading on Mycroft’s face.
“Well, not so much working on anything, really,” John began, eyes scanning the tabs he had open quickly to make sure he didn’t have one open he didn’t want Sherlock to see. “It’s a little late for Christmas shopping, but-”
Sherlock picked up the dead lantern, the heater and his own bag and helped John with the blanket and cushions before finally heading back inside the command tower. The staff were still there and still ignoring them even as they bundled their things inside. Sherlock put everything into a storage closet near the elevator and they rode back down, if Sherlock stood a little closer to John so their shoulders touched John wasn’t going to complain.
John watched the gears turn in Sherlock’s head for a moment, that infinitely curious intelligent mind contemplating the remains of the book warring with the urge to stay at John’s side after their ordeal.
The restaurant had become deathly still and silent over the course of John’s raving but he didn’t notice until he stopped, breathing a little hard but feeling a bit better after letting the arse have a piece of his mind. If Mycroft was at all surprised by John’s bombastic reaction his face didn’t show it, he just continued to stare down at him. When he did move it was to reach into one of his coat pockets and pull out a smartphone.
John responded with his own emotional push, careful not to thrust his mind too hard against Sherlock’s and overwhelm him again. He coiled tentacles around Sherlock’s own, delicately tracing them up towards Sherlock’s main mass still stretched tall over him. Sherlock shivered hard, skin rippling all over with a mental coo of happiness. John picked up on a prick of aroused confusion from his mate as Sherlock locked up, unable to decide what to do with himself. Press himself fully onto John again or remain upright and teasing? John helped his indecisive partner by suddenly surging up and wrapping Sherlock in tendrils like a vine clinging to its trellis.
“You made quite a mess,” John said, looking at the sand and palm fronds on the floor. Hyperion managed to look guilty, posture slumping a bit as he looked away, a tinge of shame coloring the bond. The memory of Hyperion worried and angry played across John’s mind. He had gotten up and started pacing, and pacing, then visitors had come to clean his sand pit and Hyperion had been forced to lay down, irritated. The moment they left he was up again, pacing, small spikes of anger, striking the sand with his uninjured talons, spreading swaths onto the stone of his enclosure. He’d struck the trees with his tail and rattled fronds loose. In a last bit of frustration he’d bit his mat, shaking and shifting it before a heavy exhaustion set in and Hyperion lay down for good. It was after the tantrum that Tom had arrived with his daily pills. He had been so worn that Hyperion had remained lying amongst the sand and fronds on his mat, agonizing the entire time over the various levels of curiosity, excitement, fear, and worry coming from John’s end of the bond.
like you” John’s eyes raked over Sherlock’s riding gear, all tight and form fitting as always. With his knees drawn up to his chin John got a lovely view of the curves of his thighs and calves pressed into tight, two toned leather, patterned as though it was made to make him look even sexier at every angle. John licked his lips and looked away back to the screen.
It took a second for John’s brain to wake up properly and realize: there was no blue glow of aquarium tanks, no sound of water, no hard surfaces. He was in a soft bed, in a nice warm room, under a fluffy duvet, with Sherlock clinging to his back. The nightmare was over, no more fish and transformations. John took a deep calming breath and reached for Sherlock’s hand on his stomach, pulling it up and clutching it to his chest as he let the breath out again. Bed, he was in bed at Baker Street.
“Good man,” Tom said, still smiling. Hyperion finally nudged him away lightly and pushed his nose into John’s side, the contact helping to make him feel a little better. “You just hang onto him for a while and settle down.” Tom chuckled as John wrapped an arm over a nostril and leaned into his dragon.
“He’s gonna shed soon, he’s starting to look a little bit dusty. One day you’ll wake up and he’ll be all kind of white-ish and before you know it bits of him will be flaking off left and right. Yep, Dr Hooper’ll probably get him in for a bath before that just to make it easier to get off,” Mary said matter-of-factly.
“Please tell me someone called 999,” John said towards the counter where he knew the staff were still hiding.
Sherlock’s pained gasp as whatever Jim was doing took hold was the final straw; with a mad rush of adrenaline and a massive pull, the muscles in John’s arms strained and the ties binding him snapped with an almost anticlimactically small pop. His arms flew forward and in a matter of seconds he was off the floor and charging at Jim with a feral yell.
As the car wound through various tunnels and halls, John, unused to the massive Aerie, quickly lost track of where they were going. He was distracted wondering where Sherlock had been headed and what might happen to him. Hyperion stirred on the other end of the bond, not completely rising out of his nap, but waking enough to send John a thin feeling of concern ‘you’re still okay?’ John wasn’t lying when he said that he still was, though he tried to reign in the thoughts of what might await him at the other end of the car ride and the dragon drifted back off.
John hesitated for a moment after he watched Sherlock pass through the door, unsure if he should intrude. He looked over at Hyperion’s door, Hyperion sitting beyond it, calm and resting now that the bomb threat had passed. A soft wave of contentment radiated across the bond as Hyperion sensed John nearby. John pushed back his own thoughts of calm and happiness that all was safe and well again, along with a promise to come see him in a little while. He stepped up to Bellamy’s door then and he pushed anyway, slightly surprised that Sherlock hadn’t locked it behind him.
Mary hung back near John on their walk, not saying much but just keeping close. Sitting in on classes she was in had given John a chance to see how picked on she was by bigger classmates. She had a few friends among the children who shared her house with Mrs Turner, but otherwise she was fairly alone. She counted older riders who showed her kindness as friends, which was most of them it seemed, including John and even Sherlock.
The next few days were far more enjoyable; their newfound relationship giving them something to do with their night time hours beyond the dwindling amount of research Sherlock could do on the computer. There was only so much even Sherlock could do with nothing to go on, so he would maybe solve a couple of cases from his website, then grump for a little bit about not being able to figure out this fish problem, before John would lead him away from the screens and they’d cuddle up in their alcove for the night.
Sherlock didn’t appear to notice or care about Jim’s strange behavior, simply gave John a glance that said ‘I told you so’ and resumed his path back towards the back of the room. “Come along, John,” Sherlock murmured quietly as he passed him.
“I know the earth goes round the sun perfectly fine thank you, it’s the rest of the planets I couldn’t give a toss about. It is unnecessary information taking up space on my hard drive.”
“John, John, John,” Sherlock’s mind chanted absolutely drunk on his mate. John left his mind open to him and Sherlock’s dove into that loving and eroticized place like one starved, as though just a couple nights before he had not fallen asleep to the loving caresses of his John.
The little springer went back downstairs to his keeper and left John to put away his items. John continued to avoid the refrigerator, and had consciously bought things for dinner that didn’t need to share space with The Hand. He then spent the rest of the evening resting on the sofa focusing on Hyperion’s end of the bond. As dinner neared John felt him getting up and walking around like they had been doing every evening so far. John encouraged him from afar, closing his eyes and pushing good feelings across the bond, calm, happiness, praise, positive things to motivate him to walk a little further, exercise a little more each day. On a full belly though he didn’t go quite as far as the previous day or two but John didn’t mind; that he got up at all without him there in person made him happy and John conveyed that to him as well.
“You… I…” Sherlock seemed to be struggling for a response. John watched his eyes dart from the violin to John, down to where John’s left hand was clenched into a fist at his side, then away. John could almost feel the confusion pouring off of him; Sherlock’s gears of thought jamming on a retort. John backed down, taking a deep breath and relaxing his posture.
“The McDonald’s next to the exit is open for another half hour. If you’re willing to throw on a scarf and pretend to be homeless we might get something there,” Sherlock said indicating down the tunnel where they’d come from. John heard Sherlock’s stomach give a sympathetic little grumble as well.
“No need for the sir, just Greg or Lestrade will work when you’re not on assignment.” He clapped John on the back.
“Where’d Angus go?” John asked, for lack of anything better to say, as he propped his cane against the table next to the red armchair and sat.
“Sure. You can tell them that part,” John said, a note of tiredness coloring his voice as Hyperion continued to support him.
“All riders risk their lives, it’s part of the job description. The moment that eggshell cracks you’ve signed yourself permanently into a life of danger,” Sherlock said, dumping the blankets into John’s arms and then pulling all but two away.
“Oh?” John replied, eyebrows creasing together lightly thinking what else Sherlock could have possibly planned.
John jolted awake as he hit the dirt, his heart thudding away in his chest. John struggled out of the sheets sticking to his skin, feeling for body armor that wasn’t there weighing him down. As he came around, breathing hard, he realized the bond was in turmoil too. Hyperion was very much awake with him and panicking. Scared questioning feelings poured over John, ‘what is wrong?!’ and ‘are you okay?!’ screaming across at him in a fearful rush. John tried to collect himself enough to respond, to try and send his own feelings of calm but with his mind still reeling from the nightmare it was tough. He pushed his feet off the bed onto the floor and forced himself to stand instantly grabbing for his cane as the leg flared with pain. John went and sat in the chair near the window, the cool air away from the bed soothing. He breathed deep for a moment. Distantly he heard a door in the flat below slam and voices carrying up the stairs. The flatmate was back, screw him, he needed Hyperion calmed before he could even begin to deal with the mess-maker downstairs.
, about Bellamy, lovesick, eager, wanting. It was pushed slyly across the bond to John it was only missing the nudge and wink, the ‘we both know what’s going on here’ pokes and prods of a friend who’s figured out a secret and is over the moon about it.
orders first!” Lestrade said, smacking his own chest to get Sherlock to look at him. “You acting like a immature child does nothing but make the other Masters wish they could ship you off to Siberia and everyone else in the Aerie want to strangle you. Do you know about the petitions? The most recent one suggested that we send you to run post for the station in Antarctica. That one managed to get 97 signatures before we took it off the community activity board.”
John heard the familiar sound of a soldier shouting “Watson! Watson!” before the voice  was drowned out by the beating of wings far too close to the ground. A pair had come down to the sand, a large red dragon tangled with an absolutely massive black. The red carried a rider hanging half out of her saddle as she wielded her sword, stabbing into the black monster’s neck. The black was riderless but still in mangled flightgear; the shredded man on the sand must have been its rider.
This chapter got a little long... I can't thank my beta Nautilicious enough for helping me by cleaning up my errors and bad punctuation.
Sherlock acknowledged him, telling him to go wait in the car before turning to Bellamy to say, “fly home, I’ll see you in a few hours.” John could almost see the worry in her eyes as she hesitated to stand, still looking at the bundle between them, but she did take to the sky, perching on the roof of the building briefly before leaving.
“Apologies if I do not remember his name, I’ve been out on assignment in New Delhi for the last few months. You start to get names crossed going between big Aeries.”
. It was almost always there during their contact, but just in that moment it transferred a bit more powerfully, driven by an odd niggling anxiety that maybe John would never touch him again.
Bellamy darted through the air, wings flapping smoothly on either side of them, the sun making her scales shine all the brighter. John could only focus on the fact that he was flying, as the initial rush of take-off pushed him back; his hands began to hurt with the force of his grip. With a delicate swoop she leveled off to a glide, the jerk of it terrifying to the point that John reached forwards and rather than grip the saddle, clung to Sherlock himself, flattening against the back of the saddle and gripping fistfuls of the bastard’s clothing. John’s heart thundered in his chest; he couldn’t suck in enough air fast enough as he looked wide-eyed down at London, the grey stone canyons of the Aerie walls giving way to city then skyscrapers. Flashes of the Thames, the Eye, the Gherkin, various landmarks of the London skyline in the distance beyond intermittently flapping wings and all John could think was panicked repetition of
“Things happened to me while I was away,” Sherlock mumbled finally, his arms tightening around John’s ribcage. John took the sudden confession in stride; if Sherlock wanted to talk he would let him.
Wherever they were there were flashing lights nearby and John slowly peeled open his eyes, hands still keeping their death grip on Sherlock’s coat. They were near a row of run down houses, their fronts covered in scaffolding, Police cars with red and blue lights flashing away were the only things occupying the street outside a ring of police tape.
“No, oh, no, just unexpected that’s all,” John said, chuckling a little to lighten the mood and show Sherlock that he honestly didn’t mind the contact, only that he’d just been caught off guard by the ambush kissing.
, John thought. The foyer was dimly lit only by the light shining through the sheer curtains, but further in at the other end of the hallway a brighter light was visible. John followed it.
“I’m sure I’ll see you later,” Sherlock called over his shoulder. Lestrade sat back in his seat swiping a hand down his face with another sigh.
“Wouldn’t the police handle that?” John asked, Sherlock bringing them to a halt outside 2-21b’s small door.
They went back to laying together in peace and quiet for the rest of the evening and on into the night. John did get Hyperion stretch his neck over and drink from the fountain like Molly had told him to do, watching as Hyperion sucked up water slowly, and realizing that was among the multitude of things he’d never actually seen a dragon do before.
“Oh, no, its not a problem--” Tom replied. He paused. “Just, since you’re bonding, it seemed like a good idea to have you as hands-on as possible, but no one told me you were hurt, too,” Tom explained.
“I said don’t move,” John barked. Sherlock just hummed in response, resting his chin on the pillow, chuckling and thrusting his hips a bit at the small sting before stilling. He pulled at the binding on his wrists, cotton rope, soft but durable. John had taken pains to not make the knot too tight but he was definitely not slipping out of it.
John stopped struggling the moment he got a good look at the man’s face, long and far too pale with a very faint silvery sheen to his skin, under a wet, curly mop of dark hair. His ice blue eyes were wide, staring down at John as he panted, searching, studying him. It was his neck that made John freeze: there were gills open on both sides of the man’s neck, honest to god gills flexing with every breath. John’s eyes widened.
Tom looked up from where he was bent pushing the last of the vitamin capsules into a long slab. “He would never bite you,” Tom said simply. “Not even by accident. He’s aware of where you are at all times. To hurt you would be to hurt himself.” He reached across the cart to clap a hand on John’s bare shoulder before realizing how bloody he was and seeming to think better of it. “Nothing to worry about. You’d have been more likely to get hurt when he was a baby; they’re more clumsy, trying to learn how to control all those long little limbs.” He gave John a smile, leaning back when John returned the smile, feeling a little less nervous after the assurances.
“How about lunch?” John asked with a small smile, breaking the growing silence between them. Sherlock blinked at that and started to open his mouth, but John didn’t let him continue. “If you say no I’m going to bring back food for you anyway, you need to eat.” Sherlock’s mouth snapped closed, and then the pout that had dominated his face for much of the morning returned.
The comment made something very suddenly ping right beneath his breastbone. Like a sudden hit of adrenaline, John’s heart thudded away as he flicked his head to properly look at Sherlock. Sherlock was still looking up at the snowflakes, like he was pretending John wasn’t there. He was just commenting to the aether that what he was doing had stepped beyond the boundaries of a pleasant Christmas gift on into more affectionate territory. He didn’t seem upset by the thought however, and John didn’t feel upset either, the thudding in his chest wasn’t panicked it was eager. John didn’t know what to say in reply. A multitude of small fireworks lit in his mind the happiness that Sherlock might be open to a romantic relationship and best of all with John twisted with the repressed lust he’d been harboring for Sherlock for months to create a roadblock on his tongue for any response.
John brought up the rear, thankful to be having a good leg day, Hyperion healing well after a successful shed. An odd couple of days, Molly had assured him that it wouldn’t normally take days but with Hyperion’s limited movement he’d needed a little more help peeling away the old skin. Hyperion had been ambling around a bit easier afterwards though, the scabbed areas of his wounds looking a smidge less severe with fresh granulated scarring around the edges. The more he healed the easier John found it to walk, bad days were still there, but the good were beginning to outnumber the terrible crippling ones.
John didn’t see Sherlock again until a couple hours later. John had brought down his laptop and was fiddling with the new cable when a question for Sherlock occurred to him. Just then he heard a cabinet rattle.
“Dr Watson, come in Dr Watson,” The nearby receiver spoke to him finally. John shakily reached for it and pulling it up to his face.
The elevator stopped and the door opened to a small space with stairs leading upwards, Sherlock led him up them and John was greeted with a very different view of the Aerie. They came out at a glass enclosed balcony, allowing John to look down on the Aerie with a near three hundred sixty degree view. It was incredible, all lit up in the night, the whole Aerie aglow with Christmas lights.
Speaking sounded difficult in the pose he was holding with his chin pressed to his chest, his curly head and shoulders were still on the floor, but he’d locked his fingers together behind his back and swung his long legs up, curling his hips over his face and bringing his toes to rest on the floor far beyond the top of his head. A devilish thought supplied that bending just a little further would allow Sherlock to just about suck his own cock, and his face heated slightly at the mental image, undressing Sherlock even further with his eyes.
“Feels good,” Sherlock said calmly, an edge of smug I told you so in his voice. Sherlock shook his arms to dislodge John’s hands from their grip John came close to losing the entire lovely feeling from Hyperion when Sherlock let go of him, a frantic small scrabble of
“Thank you,” John replied, pulling the box closer and popping the lid. John’s mouth watered at the smell. The meal was simple, just a sandwich and a little container of small potatoes, carrots and green beans along with a canister of water. The sandwich was warm, though, and the aroma of cooked steak mixing with the sweet smell of beets and honey mustard almost made John forget his manners and simply tear into the food straight away. He looked up at the server with a heartfelt smile.
Sherlock blinked at him for a moment, his whirring motor of a mind halting for a split second as he too seemed to realize what had happened. He made no drastic movements or threw a frustrated fit, he just stood there and stared at John for a moment until John started to feel vaguely uncomfortable in the silence that enveloped the two of them. He thought Sherlock’s eyes were mesmerizing, but having them focused on him to the exclusion of all else made something undefinable in the pit of John’s stomach squirm.
A smile curved John’s mouth. He pressed his lips to Sherlock and began suckling at him. Sherlock pushed into the contact eagerly as John let the suction go only to move a few centimeters over and start again. In humans the method brought about a hickey mark, a little bruise. There was no bruising Sherlock’s skin, but just the intimate gesture on its own sent Sherlock’s mind into a lovely tizzy and made him clutch John all the tighter both mentally and physically.
He’d made the post and hadn’t expected anyone to find it, until he was typing up another post days later and noticed a number next to a little mail button, the number was bigger than he’d expected, not that he’d really expected anything.
If John thought Jim was deafening before, it was nothing compared to the almighty roar that accompanied the ripping of that spine. John felt himself thrown away from the remains of the book as though tossed back by an explosive shock wave. He landed against Sherlock’s wet side and could only stare as Jim herself levitated before him still curled in a ball, crying, pleading for mercy to an invisible force that had her like a kitten by the scruff. It wasn’t just Jim making noise, Sebbie next to him was screaming too struggling out from under Sherlock’s tail and scrambling as though to get away from some unseen threat, only to fall backwards into the aquarium. The whole warehouse seemed to echo with cries of varying volume, whatever was happening effecting all of Jim’s underlings at the same time.
“I haven’t left the flat,” Sherlock grunted as he bent back unselfconsciously, fingers knitted together far above his head.
“Now, let’s continue our review, hm?” Jim said, calling all the nestling’s attention to him and resuming the lecture, albeit with a slight fog of unease settling over the classroom as Jim seemed oddly perky after what had happened earlier.
John refilled their cups as they ate, Sherlock sipping his down easily after that first surprise belt. They drank in turns even after the main dish was done, Sherlock’s container completely empty, much to John’s surprise. Sherlock almost always had small bits of things left over; it made John happy to know that Sherlock both enjoyed the food and ate a proper full meal.
“What did they give him?” He knew it had to have been something the people at Kandahar had given him to make  Hyperion so sluggish.
“Oh, our crest? It means ‘Swift to Protect.’ They came up with it ages ago when the division was new. Back then we were meant to protect caravans of merchants and travelers from robbers and wild dragon colonies.” He chuckled, looking up at Hyperion, “We don’t do that anymore of course; we’ve got big ones like Hyperion here who qualify for military combat duty, but for the most part we’re just the Dragon Parcel Service: mail delivery, shipping, goods transportation, that sort of thing.”
A ridiculous part of him fantasized about bringing up an arm and fisting his fingers in those soft curls as he turned his head a just kissed the words right off Sherlock’s tongue. Said part of him was also getting rather bruised by the amount of times John was having to stomp it down, because Sherlock really did not need John lusting after him and trying to start something more intimate so soon after they’d only just become something resembling friends beyond just being roommates.
“Shy Death?” John remembered the name of the poison well, he’d even taken some time to read up on them along with a few of the other toxic and corrosive things Sherlock liked experimenting on in the kitchen.
But Sherlock hadn’t stopped in the kitchen, he’d dumped his mug into the sink and left it there, continuing on, heading for the closed door of his bedroom. John didn’t follow him beyond the threshold of the hallway, but still, in an attempt to not end the chat on an awkward note, blurted the first thing that came to mind.
The therapist set about helping him right away, and didn’t seem at all perturbed by the dragon occasionally nudging at her back now and then as John grunted in pain. She removed the sling and started him with some basic stretches, laying him down on the mat and helping him get his shoulder moving and trying to regain his range of motion. Through the whole session John felt concerned pangs coming across the bond, and he could see Hyperion’s head hovering out of the corner of his eye.
“Well yeah, its not every day we have a field-bonded rider come in. Is it true you bonded with him in the middle of a firefight? Lots of different stories going around about the circumstances. There’s a few who think you bonded mid-flight after Victor picked you up and he died in the saddle, that one I know is rubbish --” A loud snort and juddering grunt from Hyperion drew both of their attentions back to the large sandy dragon fidgeting away, eyeing the cart he knew contained his food.
Sherlock was on him in an instant. “What’s wrong?” he asked even as he seemed to list to the side himself.
“Dragons can be vengeful creatures without the presence of a bond grounding them.” Sherlock added before moving out of the light, leaving John to blink at the full sunlight painting a stripe across their armchairs.
“Well, Sherlock, enlighten us,” he finally said, eyebrows rising and head tilting a little to the side. With the look Jim was giving Sherlock, John was not surprised that the children were not overly fond of Jim as a teacher: the man was strangely intimidating in a quiet, snake-like way, one moment drawling on through a lesson and the moment something interrupted his stride he looked ready to strike at whatever stood in his way.
“Sherlock we need you and John to move if you can,” Lestrade eventually said, standing next to the unmoving pair. “Is he alright?” he asked voice, carrying a definite note of concern.
It was a ridiculous thought, to suddenly have the prickling feeling of inferiority prodding at his brain. John Watson didn’t do inferiority, not as a short doctor in the military and certainly not here with Sherlock. But there it was, scrabbling around John’s mind like an ugly gremlin as he looked up at the back of Sherlock’s head and the dragon pair’s backsides. John felt Hyperion give the bond a small concerned nudge of
“Shhh, John, calm, focus on calm,”John could hear the desperate tone to Sherlock’s mental voice, like Sherlock just wanted to completely curl around John’s mind and never ever leave as well. The soft words of his mate in his mind helped to ground him fractionally. It still took much of John’s energy just to focus on Sherlock through the drug, but it was energy he would gladly expend to distract from the fresh pain of the cuts. If he let his mind drift to focus on the shallow slices he could feel the panic rising again as his addled mind felt like the cuts were deeper, that his innards should be spilling out even though they weren’t.
The tail flicked and he was pushed out into the open water of the tank, above the statues on its floor.
The both of them must have been much sleepier than they had thought. John was awakened by the sound of Sherlock’s alarm going off and for a brief moment he forgot where he was. In their sleep John had slunk down farther on to the log, or Sherlock had pulled him, and had wound up with his chin resting in the fluff of Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock was clinging to John as though John was a large teddy bear, long limbs wrapped around John and holding him to him with his head pillowed against Johns bicep.
“You have a tan, you’ve been home from Afghanistan for what? A few months to a year. If you were the indoors type that tan would have faded ages ago.”
Sherlock leaned in close to the point John was laying flat on his back and put his mouth right to John’s ear. “More,” Sherlock rumbled simply, as he peeled away the gel over that ear. John felt the other ear freed as well and waited for Sherlock to clear his eyes.
Sherlock suddenly lurched forward and John found himself wrapped up in long arms, Sherlock’s face inches from his. There was only a moment of hesitation as Sherlock’s eyes flicked from John’s mouth to his eyes and then the gap was closed. John felt soft lips press to his, slotting with his own mildly chapped ones. Sherlock’s head tilted and he sank further into John, holding him a little tighter as his lips tugged gently at John’s, repositioning with a sharp inhale and taking in as much of John as he could in that moment.
Today however Jim and Moran had come to sit at the table right next to theirs and nearly anytime Sherlock moved it seemed like Jim glanced over at them. Since Moran’s return Jim appeared a little more cleaned up, his hair kept neat and slicked back, the bags under his eyes a little less prominent, but even so John still found him a little on the side of creepy for reasons he couldn’t entirely explain. The gaze that followed them out of the room did nothing to keep the hairs on the back of his neck from prickling.
“Shhhh, Sherlock you’re okay, calm down, shhh, you’re not bleeding, you’re good, perfectly fine.” John crooned softly, stroking his hair and face gently. He continued to murmur soothing words as he placed light kisses to Sherlock’s forehead and held onto him.
“We’ll have to come visit her,” John suggested, thinking she might like to meet the pair who played a part in her rescue. Sherlock gave a disinterested grunt from the sofa.
“Testing for how said bruises formed,” Sherlock replied, lips thinning with barely concealed loathing. “Which was far more interesting to deduce than the origin of that spot just under your collar”
“I was going to say we should rest tonight, but a nap sounds just fine as well.” John saw the little frown that accompanied a slight put-upon sigh and an eyeroll to complete the package. “Come to think of it I never see you sleep.”
“Fuck off, Sherlock, usually variants upon that,” he confessed, standing from his chair and taking his empty mug with him into the kitchen.
“Well, er, stressful situations,” he lamely attempted as an excuse, while John slipped his shirt on and followed him with his own robe over his arm. John just huffed a quiet chuckle.
“She has murder weapons and a body somewhere in that house I know it,” Sherlock said with such assured conviction that John was certain he was right, but that didn’t make how he went about finding those things any less wrong.
John got to watch from a distance what it looked like for a bond to start. It looked a little silly from the outside, all the emotions visibly playing across Luke’s face, but John understood what was happening in his head, that sudden surge. John could only imagine what it was like with a hatchling though, everything new. The rider leading the dragon, that was the biggest difference: John had bonded to a mature dragon, Hyperion leading him more than John leading Hyperion. John looked to the others to see them smiling as well, a look of pride on Henry’s face.
“I don’t care that you think these classes are stupid, I still need to take them and you need to come with me and be my tutor,” John said as he reached for a clean glass in the cupboard. “The sooner I get educated,” he swallowed at the thought of the next step, “and into the sky, the sooner you can go out flying on your own again and terrorizing Lestrade and Mycroft. Drink?” John lifted a glass of wine for Sherlock to see. He heard Sherlock sigh and the rider appeared around the corner, putting the papers down on the table.
He began puttering around the flat while he waited for Sherlock, did some cleaning and neatening up, settled down to read for a bit, made another cup of less angrily made tea until he heard a door creak down the hall. Shuffling towards the noise, John saw Sherlock had opened the bathroom door and moved inside to find Sherlock flopped in the tub looking like someone had filled the bath with tree sap.
“She’s really tired,” Luke finally said, voice shaking as he stroked over her clean head. “She wants to sleep, is that okay?” he asked timidly.
John looked up at Damir, now no barriers between them, before screwing up some extra courage and coming closer. “What are you doing here?” he asked boldly, very much aware of his sweaty exhausted appearance next to the immaculate gear the man wore; nowhere near as form fitted as Sherlock’s or Irene’s, but still custom-tailored, with black tails on his coat. John was ready to get the man a little dirty if he tried anything, hopped up on terror-driven adrenaline as he still was, behemoth dragon be damned.
John realized as he stared at the spinning pinwheel of a load screen. Trying to do both the inputs for the laptop and talk to Hyperion was a little taxing as his attention was pulled in two different directions, John had trouble trying to convey what was happening: danger, someone else in danger, need to help them, aid. The dragon was being keyed up by John’s worry, his own worry for his rider reigniting as John waited for the damn screen to load.
John looked up with wide eyes when Hyperion nudged his shoulder with his snout and a gentle prod of concern. John looked up at the now familiar face from the book of new and strange ones. “There are so many of you,” he said dumbly, a little overwhelmed. He’d been so focused on the ground all his life he’d never noticed these sort of differences; he’d only known they came in size massive to giant like Hyperion and the Nordics. God, how many dragons had he seen on the battlefield, strewn dead across it, that were different breeds from different countries? They’d all just been lumped as ‘dragons’ in his mind, and they hadn’t had names other than ‘big black thing’ or ‘skinny blue firebreathing one’.
The world swam back to John in a haze of pain and shouting. He was surrounded by yelling people, people putting hands on his face, people shouting garbled words in his ears, people prying at the huge scaled talons that encased him. Too much noise and too much pain and bright lights from torches being pointed in his face; John groaned, squinting into the lights, trying to make out faces around him.
“Where was I? Oh! We do have a physical therapist scheduled for you. She will be around this afternoon to start working with that arm. Your meals will be brought to you, don’t worry about that. And if he feels up to it Hyperion’s got some toys in the closets to play with I’m sure. I’ll have Sally bring some books by, you’ve got some learning ahead of you” Lestrade seemed to have exhausted his list of things to do. “Otherwise, just relax. Bonding is usually a very calm, happy time for rider and dragon. There’s normally some ceremony to this, traditions and all that, but you’re a special case, so just leaving you two to bond is the best we can do for now.” That prompted John to speak finally.
“They wanted to banish me to the farthest Aerie possible. There were a handful of death threats, I figured out who sent them, none of them threatened to kill her, just me, a pure silver dragon is too valuable to kill. They couldn’t send me away though, too young, and again a silver dragon is far too valuable. So they stuck me with the man who would be my first flatmate, arsehole that he was. The whole Aerie liked Bellamy, treated her well, it would not do to have a silver lady like her grow up weak and frail, I on the other hand, if I died it wouldn’t be hard to replace me with a new ‘more suitable’ rider for her.”
“Is that you?!” He felt a tiny wave of the creature’s confusion before he got something that could only be described as positive in his mind, a good feeling of ‘yes you got that correct.’ John started giggling, looking up into the gold eye watching him. The dragon was ‘talking’ to him.
“Sherlock, Sherlock! Wait!” John grabbed and caught the cuff of his coat before he could leave. Sherlock, frozen in the doorway looked at the hand gripping his cuff with a wide-eyed stare. Gone was his aloof mask in a moment of what John assumed was shock. John let go quickly. “Shouldn’t we be calling the police?” John asked.
“S-Sir, this establishment is closing,” said one of the cashiers, emboldened by the sight of the black clad guards already beginning to haul away the shark pair, replacing the scarves with proper cuffs.
Mycroft’s lips thinned further at that. “The surveillance system put into place around this building went down approximately one hour before your nightly changes.” Mycroft turned to level a frigid glare at the small army of people guarding the door behind him. “I was only alerted to the error a few moments before I placed the call to have one of the employees here check on you, only to find you were already here and injured. I don’t enjoy repeating myself. What happened?” he asked again, leveling his gaze back on John.
“She’s going to get away with it because of me, I have a right to be in a funk,” Sherlock grumbled back, John could hear the pout in his voice.
John thought as he watched a burly giant of a man with an RPG slung over his shoulder jump out last. Hyperion seemed to recognize the weapon on the man’s shoulder: a dragon killer. This guy had enough big ammo and weapons to have probably taken the drakes that had been protecting the camp. The fact that he was here now spoke volumes for the status of the rest of John’s men, dead and dying, all of them. The massive dragon behind John was no small drake, but an RPG could do enough damage to bring about a fairly slow painful death with one blow.
“I have come to the conclusion I actually am fond of you, have been for some time now, and with this evening I fear I have rather shown my hand,” Sherlock said quietly to the sky sounding if anything mildly frustrated with himself, “This isn’t a dinner. It’s a date.”
At the other end was a spacious kitchen, expensive, in black marble and stainless steel and more of the dark wood seen elsewhere. John’s attention was almost instantly drawn to a massive panoramic window in the attached dining room to his left. The window looked out onto a dragon pit. Unlike Hyperion’s or Bellamy’s, which both held greenery in varying amounts, this one was lavished in white and gold embellishments. An ancient oak tree stood at one end of the huge pit, its branches supported by wooden beams and spreading over the sandy center. A plush purple mat sat under the tree, unoccupied: the resident of the pit sat atop what John hoped was a short pile of fake golden coins in the sand, picking through the small metallic discs as if looking for one in particular.
John took that moment to straddle Sherlock’s waist, sitting on his hips and pinning him down. He dangled the blindfold in front of Sherlock’s face before he slipped the band over his head and the world went black.
Sherlock’s fans had found him. Not the ones with explosives, thankfully, though a voice at the back of his mind reasoned that they could be amongst the messages too, but the tamer ones he’d seen on Sherlock’s blog and in the comments on dragon spotting videos.
“And tell Sherlock, thank you.” With that he hung up. John looked to Sherlock to see him let out a sniff.
John couldn’t help the snorted laugh that rattled Sherlock off his shoulder at that statement, Bellamy seemed to be using her own instinctual knowledge of what she wanted in a good mate and projecting it onto her human rider. He needed consistent feeding and safety coupled with things that she thought were nice.
He grabbed John’s head and cleaned his face meticulously before planting a soft kiss on John’s dried lips, holding there for a very long moment before he finally pulled away with a sigh.
A warm, fuzzy, sleepy sort of feeling slowly crept in on John and he realized the grappa was beginning to get to him, and then he realized Sherlock was kneeling next to him pulling at his arm,
John turned and ran for the nearest entrance, Hyperion a glowing beacon of concern in the back of his mind.
“Yes John I heard you,” he grumbled, dropping his hand to look up at the fake vines on the ceiling, “the question is now who sent them? Who made them? All this has done is give Mycroft another reason to keep us sequestered in here and we are still no closer to solving the mystery of who has done this… Though I now have an idea where two of the missing sharks may have gone, but considering this aquarium is not the only one that contains sharks and we have no idea how far their master’s reach is that pair could have literally come from anywhere.” Sherlock bumped his head back against the wall in frustration.
Sherlock’s face broke into a smile. “Now you’re asking the right questions,” he said, and John felt an odd swell of pride at the meager praise and the small smile.
“Of course, gigantic Nordic blues, a rare breed, they hatch small and grow fast, but being a rider to something that big…” She whistled with an appreciative grin as she stared at the stretching dragon. John looked up at her. She wore dark burgundy leather gear, which hugged her form and left little to the imagination even with her parachute kit on. The little skin visible underneath the gear was pale, and she had sharp face, red lips, and dark hair pulled up and ready to go under her helmet. She was beautiful. He realized he was staring when she coughed, bringing him back to the present.
In the distance he heard a phone ringing and someone picked it up. “Sir, there’s a man named Mycroft on the line, says it’s for you.” John blinked up at the manager who had the phone cord stretched over to him. He took it and put the receiver to his ear just as Emma returned with the first aid kit.
It was all very gradual, no rush, just even movements. John began meeting Sherlock with his own hips. They undulated together, their hands eventually forgetting about gills to clutch at other surfaces, John’s on Sherlock’s hips, fingers splaying across Sherlock’s clothed arse. Sherlock’s arms went around John’s shoulders, holding his head close with one hand curled around the back of his skull between him and the wall.
“This has happened before?” John asked, startled. He knew that explosives had been intercepted in the post and defused successfully, but the idea of hostage situations happening with any amount of frequency made John pale to think about.
John pulled the sling on again and his pants, leaving the still faintly bloodstained trousers. He only had the one sling; there were other, less stained, garments still in his bag. He limped to the door, picking up the items left behind, and realized that he was as far away from Hyperion as he’d been all day. Hyperion stared at him with a sad pang across the bond. “I’m not leaving,” John reassured him, “not for a few days still, and even then, I’ll come back,” John tried to push comfort back to Hyperion even feeling as frayed as his nerves felt after the panic; it hurt to feel the upset underlining everything that crossed the bond.
John bustled through the door after him and was halfway up the stairs when an extremely sharp pain stabbed through his back; he fell on the stairs crying out in agony. He looked up through watering eyes to see a pale figure peering down at him over the railing, naked as the day he was born, again.
“There we are, now sit still for me,” Jim said, John saw her hand go to a book in her lap, the book, the old wrinkled thing that had turned the man at the aquarium back into a shark. It struck John in that moment just what happened to Mycroft’s agents as his eyes darted from the book to the fish on the floor that the shark man had just picked up and back.
“Yes, but--” She pulled up a cord from the side of her saddle and without any concern for personal space grabbed John’s belt and hooked onto it.
The world fell silent for John for a while and he was happy with that. It wasn’t entirely quiet for him with Hyperion in his mind, but the world around him was still. The only sounds were the comforting bodily huffs and gurgles of Hyperion’s innards working, heart thudding away at rest, and the very distant sounds of movement in the Aerie, a far off dragon’s roar being the most that penetrated the privacy of Hyperion’s room. John eventually laid down with his back still against his dragon, keeping that contact. Hyperion’s resting mind continued to wash over John’s, calmly learning more about each other. The stronger the bond grew the more John could read the curiosities and the concerns; John would think of something and Hyperion would react with a feeling that John could translate as ‘what is that? Where is that? Who is that?’ and so on. John was beginning to feel the same from Hyperion, thoughts, flickers of images, and he would barely break the silence to whisper questions about what he received from Hyperion.
The helicopter was rapidly moving towards one warehouse in particular, not well lit, just enough to show a nondescript old box of a building. As soon as they were down John wanted to tear off his belt and headset and be the first one into the building, but the other four beat him to it. Belts already undone and ready for action, they poured out of the little helicopter.
“I didn’t know Sherlock, I’m so sorry,” John told him pressing up against his back and winding his arms around again to hold Sherlock to him. “What did I do to remind you?” he asked, kissing the back of Sherlock’s shoulder.
Over Sherlock’s shoulder he could see the grey light of dawn glowing through the corrugated plastic windows, and John hugged him even tighter, happy in the fact that they’d see the sun, that they’d never become tuna fish ever again.
John thought that it suddenly felt very much like he was dying; the pain was everywhere all at once and it left him gasping into the rough metal grating of the steps. He was reaching for his phone to dial 999 when another stabbing spasm rocked him and the phone slipped from his fingers, clattering away.
Thank you so much Nautilicious for being my beta. Sorry it took so long to get this chapter written and up.
And if Sherlock now and then got a text alert with an update about the status and location of the seal that was Jim and the shark that was Sebbie, he quite pointedly ignored it, and never ever mentioned it to John.
“And what about Sherlock?” she asked, sounding equally as worried about the mad detective as John felt.
John looked down at the bag of leftovers Sherlock had left at his feet and back to the blanket mound that was Sherlock, questions still abuzz and begging to be asked. It was obvious Sherlock didn’t want to be talked to, though, so he’d leave them for now. John took the bag and left, turning Bellamy’s lights off and walking out into the dark hallway. He saw maybe a torch or two still out an about but otherwise dark and quiet. He dropped the blankets off just inside the door with Hyperion, and made his way back to the flat with the food.
