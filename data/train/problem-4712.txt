Dean smiles and just as he’s about to suggest they head upstairs, Cas furrows his brow.
They order drinks and Ash orders three different apps for them all to split.
“About what?” he asks.
“I’ll start with a coffee, black,” Dean replies, rubbing his temples.
“I know, I’m not upset with you. I’m just thinking,” Cas says back.
“I’m proud of you, Dean,” he says as he moves his hand to rest on Dean’s shoulder for a moment.
“Yes, something like that.” Castiel smiles.
Sam’s face turns bright red and Dean can tell this is the girl he’s refused to name whenever Dean bugged him about who’s been making him so happy lately.
After a hug that feels like it lasted forever, and honestly, Dean wishes it would, they finally all pull away from each other.
Dean laughs again and leaves the studio. He checks his phone when he gets back to the Impala. Nothing but a few missed texts from Sam and the guys. He locks his phone, puts it in his pocket and drives home.
“Just makin’ sure you get home okay. What kinda date would I be if I let you get inna cab by yourself?” Dean replies.
“Look, Sam, it was just a stupid fight we got into. I probably overreacted anyway. Just drop it,” Dean pleads, but Sam persists.
Gilda and Dean both laugh and then Dean sighs.
And without skipping a beat, Cas has lined himself up with Dean’s hole and is pushing himself inside.
They’re halfway through the movie when they pause again to clean up their dinner. Dean says they can wait until the movie's over, but Cas insists because he doesn't want the pizza to go bad. Dean rolls his eyes, but he obeys. Cas puts the leftover pizza in the fridge while Dean washes the dishes. He grabs the dish rag hanging on the oven handle. He’s drying his hands as he’s whipped around and pressed up against the counter, his lips met by Castiel’s.
They were so good together. In every single way, they were so good. And Dean resents Cas. He resents him for not wanting to come out. He resents him for putting Dean through the best seven months of his life only to rip them away. He resents Cas for making him fall in love with him.
One of us breaks down and has to pull over whenever it comes on
“Do we have any condoms left?” Cas asks.
Sam cuts the cake and begins handing out slices to the line forming in front of him.
“Dean are you sure you’re-,” Sam starts, but Dean cuts him off.
He thanks her for being supportive as he flips the light off and they all head to bed.
“Alright, let’s rock n’ roll,” Dean grins as he grabs his and Cas’ bags and bounds for the car.
“Just moved here from Kansas.”
“You pick. I’m still finding my way around, remember?” Cas answers. Dean laughs, putting the car in drive. He knows exactly where he wants to go.
“First of all, Crowley should mind his own business. Second of all, the ‘chick’ he saw me with was a coworker. We had some case notes we had to go over, so we went out for drinks. That’s it, Dean,” Cas says.
“You tell me, Cas!” Dean yells, throwing his hands up in the air. “You wouldn’t even talk to me afterwards. You wiped your hands clean of me, just like that. And Crowley told me he saw you with some chick at the Roadhouse a few nights back, so it seems pretty clear to me that you have.”
“If all you did was trip, why’d you cover it up?” Cas pries.
“Thanks. She was my dad’s before she got handed down to me,” Dean says, proudly. “So, where ya wanna go for lunch?”
“My sister, Hannah, called me a few days after you left for tour.”
Dean playfully rolls his eyes and walks into the kitchen to grab a couple of beers out of the fridge. He walks back into the foyer and offers one to Cas.
Dean glances towards the stage and Benny shoots him a huge grin and a thumbs up. He laughs and leans back in his chair.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean breathes out.
“Can you relax now, please?” Dean asks.
“No worries,” Dean laughs, “I’m just picking. I mean, I’d rather not talk about Jeffrey Dahmer’s psycho cousin during dinner, but I’m just messing with you.”
Dean texts back, letting his annoyance get the better of him.
They get into Dean’s car and head straight to Dean’s house.
“Dean, where the hell have you been? Why haven’t you been answering your phone? Didn’t you get my texts?” Sam starts in.
John sees who it was that just about knocked him on his ass, and he starts laughing. A laugh that gives Dean chills whenever he hears it. It’s not a normal ‘ha-ha’ laugh. This one is mocking, bordering on evil.
“How’d it feel? I mean, just being in the audience was surreal for me and especially for Jess. But you being up on that stage? I can’t even imagine,” Sam rambles.
“Listen, Cas,” Dean starts, “yesterday morning, I-I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you. I just, I didn’t get the bruise by tripping at my house."
“Oh my god,” Cas responds, sounding much more awake than before. “Is he okay? Dean, I’m so sorry I wasn’t there for you.”
Dean laughs and then he pulls out his phone. It’s three o’clock. That means there’s only two hours until the red carpet, four hours until the award show starts, and about five and a half hours until they go on stage. Dean takes another deep breath.
“They’re lovely,” Cas says, breathing in their scent.
They play a few more songs, take their bows, and thank the fans before they all head off stage.
“Yes, it is. I’m the one who pissed him off.”
Nice bedside manner. How’d this chick ever get certified to be a nurse? As annoyed as Dean is, though, he can’t help but bite his lip at how authoritative she is. But, despite being slightly turned on, he ignores the urge to flirt a little to get his way and he walks back over to Sam.
“Didn’t notice,” Crowley says.
deserve it, Dean. You put your heart and soul into this album. Nothing you’ve ever put out before is realer’n this one,” Bobby says back.
Dean peers around the shower door, his head still full of shampoo.
“Look, I’m sure everything’s good. Don’t worry!” Dean says, reassuringly, kissing Cas on his forehead.
Dean allows himself to sleep in today. Soon he won’t be able to for a while, so he takes full advantage of this time he has to relax. The only thing missing is Cas.
“So, first order of business, Luke is doing his Sunset tour and Morgan Wallen had to cancel his appearances for the shows in Cancun. Would you wanna take that spot? Those shows are, uh,” Bobby hesitates as he checks his computer. “June 9
“It’s nice to meet all of you,” Cas says.
“What? No, yeah, yeah, everything’s fine, Cas,” Dean says, now looking at him. “I actually, uh, I have some news.”
“I know,” Dean winks.
“Have’ta put the code in,” Castiel slurs.
“So, I’ve been meaning to ask you,” Dean starts, “Christmas…you, uh, you staying here or going back home?”
“Number one! Feels fuckin’ good, don’t it?” Dean yells back.
“Wasn’t much to tell, Sammy. Didn’t go anywhere.” Dean replies, plainly.
They arrive in Mexico at about midday local time. Dean’s more than thrilled to be on land again. As their shuttle makes its way to their hotel, Bobby lays out the game plan.
“Dean – you are amazing… fuck you are beautiful.” And he was. Laid down under Cas, so needy for him, begging for his cock. God he didn’t want to forget this sight ever.
“Speak when you are spoken to.”
He was looking at the various handcuffs options when he felt heavy eyes on him. When he looked to his left he saw the woman’s back, the man that worked here in front of her with his eyes locked onto Dean. He could hear the woman explaining something and the man nodding in agreement but his gaze - glued on Dean. He felt like he was being undressed in the guy’s mind and to be honest that got him a bit tingly inside. Maybe a lot tingly.
Dean nodded and started strumming. He played the song, then a couple more. He hadn’t enjoyed free time so much in a long time. Every time he was free of work he couldn’t get his mind off the cases he’d had to solve. But this right now, with Cas, felt different. His head was filled with smiles, instead of dark thoughts and puzzles and his stomach with butterflies instead of a sick feeling. And until now he was always alone. He was never lonely, but it felt nice having someone at his home at 11PM, having someone to share a beer with. The sound of Cas’ voice and even laugh, the few times he did, filled the room with serotonin. It was close to 12PM when Cas got up to leave.
“Here, you want me to take it off?” Dean asks, grabbing the back of the collar and slipping the shirt over his head. He balls it up and tosses it across the floor. “It’s gone now. That make you happy?”
“The hell are you doin’ here, boy?” Bobby asks, a pleasure as always.
After they finish eating, Sam cleans up letting Dean and Benny talk. Then, once they’re both gone, Dean heads back upstairs and gets right back in bed.
“It’s okay, Cas. So, uh, after she died, I guess I just found it hard to…to put my faith in someone when He could take my mom away from me like that.”
Just depends if you're talkin' about his world or mine”
He leans in to kiss Dean as he slides himself inside of him.
“And Cas told me that it wouldn’t be for a very long time,” Jack finishes.
“Damn right it is, and you’re going in, too.” Benny replies.
“How could you think you didn’t mean enough to me for me to write about you? Hell, I probably have, like, twenty songs in old notebooks ‘bout you. Just never recorded most of ‘em,” Dean continues.
Dean laughs.
Dean sighs, he knows he can’t argue with that. He walks over to the bed to think.
“I’ll handle the dishes if you want to take care of that,” Cas suggests.
“That’s not what I meant,” Castiel defends. He shakes his head and tries again, “I just meant I want to explore…,” Castiel trails off, searching for the right word, “the connection we had the other night.”
“Ooo, do you have a picture of him?” Gilda asks.
“You shouldn’t have to be okay with that, Dean.”
He leans down and kisses Dean as he inserts his finger into Dean’s hole.
“Dean, we need to talk,” Cas says, calmly.
Dean moves into position, sliding his boxers down and kicking them off onto the floor as Cas squeezes the lube onto his fingers.
Cas begins a steady rhythm pulling almost all the way out and then pushing back in, provoking moans of pleasure from Dean almost in sync.
Cas nods.
“Hey, Benny! It’s been forever, man. How you been?” Sam gets up to hug him.
“Right now? Uh, no…”
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Clearly you’re not comfortable with whatever it is,” Cas answers.
“Dean! That was awesome, man! Is that song on your new album?” Brady asks him.
“Don’t,” Cas says, pulling his hand away. “I got it.”
Everyone at the table gasps and Cas can even hear a couple of sniffles, but his eyes are glued to Dean. And then Dean starts laughing…
He watches his screen as the text goes through. Those three little dots don’t pop up, so he locks his phone and forgets about it.
“Possibly,” he says as he shakes his phone up by his face, “I’m gonna get going, but hey,” Dean’s smile drops and his face becomes serious, “don’t let dad in if he comes back. Call the cops if you have to, let him spend a night in jail to sober up. Okay, Sammy?”
“I don’t really give a damn who you are,” she cuts him off, flashing him a fake smile right back, “you’re not getting any more information from me. So why don’t you walk back over to your brother, take a seat on the floor, and the doctor will come find you when he’s out of surgery. Understood?”
His voice is gravelly and warm. Dean wasn’t expecting the man to sound so enticing.
“Hey, you wanna come in for a beer?” Dean offers. “Nah, I have an early morning. I’ve already been out way later than I should’ve been,” Sam replies.
“I love you too, Dean.”
going to let this go.
“Actually, that’s why I’m here,” Dean starts, “well, part of why. I also wanted to see your gorgeous face.” He winks at her and she playfully rolls her eyes.
Cas is silent for a while. Dean has a lump in his throat, anticipating Cas’ response.
“I’m good! Been baking all day,” she says as she closes her eyes and breathes in the scent.
“Dean, I,” Cas starts, “I had no idea. I’m, I’m so sorry you had to deal with all of that.”
“You doin’ okay?”
“I’m actually gonna head home,” Cas says.
Bobby has such a way with words sometimes, Dean rolls his eyes and walks over to the door of the sound booth. He stands there for a moment before opening the door.
“Really?” He asks.
They clean up and walk back out into the living room, both of them still completely naked.
“Look, Cas, I’m comfortable with who I am. I’m not really looking to be your little gay experiment,” Dean says.
“Dean?” Sam asks, reiterating his question with his eyebrows even though Dean can’t see him.
“Please,” Dean laughs, “I couldn’t get Benny to sleep with me if I tried. And I
“Oh, Sam! Look! It’s karaoke night! We should get up and sing something!” Jess exclaims.
Dean nods and unlocks the bathroom door.
Tell me everything ‘til there’s nothing I don’t know about you
And there's a car in the drive that stayed all night, where one of us used to park
“Well, that’s why I said, ‘Eileen and I’. I’ll really just be there for moral support. I’ll be her cooking wing man,” Cas says.
Dean still isn’t buying it, but he lets it go for now.
“So, do you know the owners here too, or am I allowed to pay this time?”
Sam walks to the kitchen with his arm draped around Dean, practically holding him up. He seats him on the bench before moving to the other side to sit across from him.
Sam does his best to give Dean his space, but with the state of the world right now, it’s proving rather difficult. Jack has been looking for a way to save Cas. He got Cas out before, he can do it again.
Dean opens one eye to look at Cas.
“Cas made a deal with the empty to get Jack back.”
Cas laughs as he buttons his shirt and walks over to kiss Dean’s frowning lips.
“Oh, so, if he was, then you would be,” Cas says, his words dripping in jealousy.
Cas continues to stroke him through his orgasm, watching Dean's body go completely limp as he begins to soften.
“You packed?” Dean shouts from inside his closet as he throws on a worn leather jacket.
“Basically, you’ve got ‘til the middle of this month to do whatcha want, then it’s down to business. I’m scheduling talk show interviews, radio interviews, oh and Blake has his annual benefit concert for Oklahoma that he’s doing in March and he specifically requested your performance. Blake, Luke, Thomas and his daddy, Carrie, Reba, Strait, Jr., they’ll all be there.”
“Oh God, no, Cas, come on, man. You’re one of
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
“One of us still has our picture taped up on the dash
Dean gets back from the liquor store shortly after he left. But when he pulls in the driveway, he sees a car blocking his garage. Not just any car, though. Cas’ car.
“Hey, Cas, I just wanted to say I’m really happy for you and really proud of what you did tonight. From what Dean’s told me, I know it must’ve been really hard for you to tell everyone that. And I know it meant a lot to Dean, too.”
“Woah, woah, woah, Sammy, relax. I didn’t have my phone on me, I was…busy,” Dean says in his defense.
Dean sits back in the booth. Yeah, okay, maybe he didn’t want to delve into his sex life in front of Colette and maybe he’s not sure what he and Cas are right now, but he sure as hell doesn’t see Cas as a friend.
Dean looks up at him.
“Oh really? What were you referring to, then?” Cas asks, matching Dean’s enticing tone.
“I’m gonna send Benny by tomorrow to check on you,” he says before shutting Dean’s door and heading home.
“You were dating for seven months and he was afraid to come out?”
“When was the last time you reached out to him? Maybe now that he’s had some time to sit with it, he’ll be more open to talking,” Sam suggests.
“Something happen last night?” He asks.
Sam pushes Dean’s shoulder and Dean laughs.
Cas raises his eyebrows, “Oh you were, were you?”
Dean laughs as he looks up to see Benny walking in, almost an hour late to their own party.
For a while we had forever in our hands
“Dean, wait,” Castiel says, panting.
“You heard the boy, no one will be commenting at this time,” Bobby says, shutting the door after Dean.
Castiel’s eyes went darker, hungrier, gaze tracing Dean from his toes all the way up his head. “Well… what
Fuck that voice. Fuck his stupidly handsome face that made Dean melt under those heavy blue eyes.
At those words Dean and Cas shared a strong look, immediately focusing on the monitor in front of them after.
They both nodded and Cas took out his notebook. He turned some pages and Dean allowed himself to take a little look. He didn’t want to intrude or anything, he was just a bit curious. Okay, a lot curious. At the first pages there were some kind of drawings. He couldn’t see very well, couldn’t make out the shape or what they were exactly, but they looked good. The other pages had something written on it, which Dean assumed was about the investigation.
She shot him a smile and took a sip of her own drink. “I’m Bela.”
Dean wasn’t usually as flirtatious as he was right now but there was something about that man that made Dean crazy. Was it the eyes? Or maybe the voice… or maybe his whole appearance. Dean was too tempted, too hungry for it. Adding to the fact he actually hasn’t had anyone in that way for over 7 months so it was kind of getting to him. His hand and imagination just weren’t enough anymore.
. Not need anything but need me.
Dean started blinking repeatedly at him. “You walked here?” he asked in a surprised tone.
“It’s nothing. Just a graze.”
Castiel pressed his lips together and drew in a breath. “Forever, really. Ever since I was little. Drawing helps me… escape. From the real world. Hence the angels and demons and what not.”
“You really asking me? You are the chief, boss.” Benny gave out a chuckle and Dean did the same. “Oh yeah don’t let me forget the other thing. You probably won’t like this.” there goes the bad news Dean really didn’t want to hear right now.
“When did u learn to play guitar?” he sounded genuinely interested and it gave Dean butterflies in his stomach.
Dean was literally left breathless so he quickly nodded his head.
Castiel moved from Dean’s neck to his face, blue eyes staring into green. “Ask me nicely. Say you wan’t my cock stretching you open, Dean.”
Castiel looked at him for a brief moment, then went back to scribbling something with his pen.
Did he fuck up? He hoped he didn’t fuck up.
“No, he usually just comes, drinks, and leaves. He never causes any trouble. Dude is just miserable I guess.”
She had long brown hair, falling perfectly on her shoulders. She was dressed with a brown leather jacket, jeans and boots. Her soft british accent added a nice touch to her look.
Him and Sam were really close. Even since they were little, they were always together and Sam never wanted to leave Dean’s side. He was like a mentor to Sam especially after the incident with their parents. Dean hated thinking about it but he also didn’t want to really forget what happened. It was a different feeling he had. It’s like you want to get rid of something but at the same time you don’t because you’ve just been too attached to it, it has impacted your life too much that if you lose it you might leave a hole in your soul. He used to park his car in the middle of nowhere and just look up at the sky, breathe in the air and just forget about the world for a little bit. It reminded him of this one night with his dad.
Castiel asked with the most chill tone ever. The confidence on that guy was something else, but it was so addicting. Dean nodded his head, eyes never leaving Cas’ who now had his tie wrapped around his fingers.
“Eyes on me, Dean.”
“No idea. You know how they are so I’m not even surprised. But yeah the head of their criminal investigations should come soon to talk to you. I was told 10am but who knows when he will arrive.” checking the clock Dean saw he had a bit of time to relax and think about everything Benny just told him.
Dean got worried and tried to get closer to him and take a look at his arm.  “Hey Cas, are you okay? What happened?” before he could do anything though Cas took a step back and lifted his hand up.
“So as you probably already saw, he was killed the same way as the first victim. He is sewed in the middle of his rib cages..” she gestured the marks “and I’d assume he has no organs again. The killer this time though was kind enough to leave us his ID so we don’t have to take samples of his fingerprints now.” She took it out of his pocket and handed it to Dean “The victim’s name is Andrew Carson. 34, unemployed.” Dean took a look at the ID.
: hey, u awake?
“And the new information?” asked Novak and Dean handed him the folder. He took it kind of hesitantly and it was like he didn’t want to open it and was waiting for Dean to give him more information. “Mind if I make copies of these and bring them back later?”
Castiel started nodding slowly and downed the rest of his bourbon. “I… think I will go home.”
“Where the hell where you? And please tell me it’s good news.”
“Thanks, Cas. What were you drawing?” he asked as he worked the lock of his office door open.
“The hell happened to you guys?” he asked with a confused look on his face. Dean almost forgot he got stabbed when he suddenly felt the pain rush through him again by the reminding of it.
He slowly took the bandage off and looked up at Cas who didn’t want to look back at him. His palm had bloody scars which looked like were from his nails. How could you even hold your fist so firmly to leave these kind of scars? Dean wondered if he was the reason he did that since he saw him holding his fist like that last night. He took a new rag and placed it in Cas’ palm which made Cas release the breath he was holding in. Dean wanted so bad to ask about it but also didn’t want to push his luck or make Cas upset again.
Dean looked up at him for a brief moment. “I got it.”
“Uh hey.” Cas replied and forced a smile. Should he ask him if he is a new hire? Would that be too awkward? The cashier returned the smile and started checking Cas’ supplies. What was it about this guy that made Castiel feel this way? Sure he’s had boyfriends before but something about this guy just seems different. It was a feeling of I want to grab you and fuck you right on this desk but it was also a feeling of I want to hug you and watch movies at three in the morning with you.
Benny made an unpleasing sound but when Dean looked him in the eyes he shut up and nodded. Dean drank what was left of his coffee and they both went into the main office. Castiel was sitting at one of the benches, his notebook in his hands.
Dean felt his cheeks heat up and right in that moment he hated that trait of himself. He would always blush whenever someone complimented him or if he felt shy. Which really did not help in some of the situations he’d been in. Especially if he was trying to hide something he was actually excited for.
Cas seemed to really think about it which was taking too much time and it was starting to get on Dean’s nerves. Just when he was about to say ‘forget it’ Castiel started talking.
Dean felt breathless. His heart started beating faster than ever, knees weak. His hands were trapped between him and Castiel and he didn’t even dare move. They were so close, dicks almost rubbing against each other and he could practically feel Cas’ breath on his lips.
He seemed to finally notice him as he put his phone in his pocket and turned to him. “Dean. Hey.”
Benny took the file with all the addresses of the stores Dean just printed. “Okay so I take Novak, go to the stores, and you go to the victim’s house?”
Castiel chuckled and that smile looked so good on him. “You will have to play something for me sometime.”
Castiel opened his fridge to check what he had so he could cook something for him and Dean. “Thank you. I’ve loved drawing since I was little so it means a lot when people appreciate what I do.” It was true. Growing up everyone except his parents didn’t really believe in him. They didn’t think being an artist is a high paid job. And even if it wasn’t it didn’t matter to Castiel. He wanted to do what he loved and not what people wanted him to.
“No. Strip.”
Dean felt his eyes on him but continued to search for a tape, ignoring Cas. He felt kind of annoyed by the way Cas was acting. Yes he didn’t want to pressure him but at the same time he wanted to know if he was the reason Castiel was like that today. When finally found the one he wanted he looked over his shoulder and at Cas who was still looking at him.
“How do they feel?”
“Cas please just –
Dean’s phone lit up with a notification from Sam.
also a little side note, the poem in this i wrote myself like 3 years ago, so pleace don't judge it too harshly! :D also ik i might be saying it a lot but i appreciate you reading! <3
“Come in.” he said while looking at Cas.
“Good. You like that?” Castiel asked, completely serious while looking Dean dead in the eyes. His hand was moving in slow movements up and down Dean’s shaft and it was very hard for Dean to keep his eyes open. Cas was working him up good, making Dean a moaning mess which earned him praises such as ‘
Was Dean supposed to make food? Does he prepare for a date? He already spent the whole afternoon tidying up his apartment and he didn’t have time to think about food or anything. He checked his phone. Four twenty five. He had texted Castiel his address but didn’t get a response back. Not that he expected one, Castiel was working after all. Plus what would he respond? Can’t wait to see you? Dean wasn’t that stupid, he knew Castiel wanted this as much as he did.
The rest of the day went by pretty quickly considering the only activity Dean and Cas did was stand in front of a computer reviewing CCTV footages. With the occasional ‘Hey I’m gonna go bring some food’ talk they had pretty much not moved from Dean’s office at all. The footages told them nothing new, even the one from the shop that arrived later in the day. There was still no reports of any bodies or any more missing people, so at least that was a plus.
“Yes.”
“Cas this is… this is beautiful.” he read it a couple more times because he just fell in love with it.
Castiel left a breath out through his nose and Dean could hear the smile on his face.
“How about you go check the living room? I will roam around here. See if there’s anything suspicious.”
“How about… ‘You are my sunshine’ by Johnny Cash? You know that one?” Cas took another sip of his water.
“Hey. The hell is wrong with you running at 3 in the fucking morning?”
He let out a long breath as he was closing the door. A lot to think about. Today was crazy, in all aspects of the word. They finally got a lead on the case and he just had an amazing time with his partner. Plus what Cas told him about his scar… He couldn’t even imagine what was going on through his head. Or his soul. And he didn’t even know the full story. But he knew enough to understand Cas a little bit more. When Cas told him he drew to escape the real world maybe this was why.
“I’m sorry for asking but…” Castiel finally managed to slip out “Are you a new hire?” he could swear the man’s eyes were on his lips the whole time. If that wasn’t enough he drew out his tongue and licked his lips.
The sight of Cas sitting on one of the benches in front of Dean’s office made his heart melt. He suddenly felt relieved, calmed by the fact that his partner was sitting right there, instead of beat up and tied to a chair. Dean quickly shook off these thoughts instead focusing on the way Cas’ messy hair fell on his forehead. The way his fingers were wrapped around his pencil, drawing away in his sketchbook. The way his eyebrows were clenched together, tongue drawing out every now on then to wet his lips. If it weren’t for the work they had, Dean could just stand there and watch Cas draw for hours. Or have Cas draw him instead. God he could only dream about that. He could only imagine himself drawn in the sacred sketchbook, as he called it, the fine dark lines of the pencil defining his face, his body.
And with that he left Dean in the bar, who wondered what he did wrong for Cas to just get up and leave like that. One second everything was fine and then he suddenly changed. His voice of tone, his expressions. Maybe he really just needed a rest. Dean looked at his phone and decided it’s time for him to go home as well.
Was it too early to invite Cas to his place right now? He didn’t want to look desperate or anything under those lines, that’s why he questioned himself that. Would Cas find it weird? Sure he said sometime, which didn’t necessarily mean right now. But what did Dean have to lose? They were friends – no – partners, or frie-… whatever. Ain’t nothing wrong in inviting your partner over for a beer, right? He was overthinking this too much, his head ready to explode from so much thinking.
“We need to ask you a couple of questions.”
floor so it was quite a nice view.
“Hey Cas, you okay?” he turned to his left to see Anna handing him his pencil. “You look a bit distressed.” Cas gave her a look saying
Anna licked her lips and smiled softly. “Sure. Follow me.”
Dean needed to slow down his breathing or he wasn’t gonna be able to talk. “I – I need you inside me, please. I need your cock in me, gosh I need it so bad. Please, Castiel.”
“I’m awesome. You hungry?”
She could easily say no and they would have to go back to the department for a consent letter to view the footage. Dean knew his ways though.
“Wha – uh, yeah. Yeah, of course.” Dean looked out the window and it looked like it had stopped raining. Cas started putting on his trench coat, Dean admiring his body. It was a good thing they were going for a walk because Dean was starting to feel his cheeks heat up.
Nodding, Dean took out his wallet to pay for his things. “Alright… I uh, I can come pick you up?”
The impala was now parked in front of the ‘Bad Luck’ bar, the big neon sign shining through the fog that was forming.
“Maybe…” he started, placing the handcuffs back to where Cas took them from. “…you can find out.”
In the past 40 minutes they were all looking for something, literally anything, that can be considered as a clue. Unfortunately they found nothing. Just pieces of old metal, some dolls and graffiti in the houses. In one of them there was some kind of circle on the floor with weird letters all around it and candles. What were kids these days up to? There is enough evil in the world, they don’t have to try and bring out more. Not that Dean believed in any of that shit. Okay, maybe just some of them.
“Cas?”
we need to talk about the case
When he got close to the impala he saw Castiel was already there, leaning against it with his notebook in his hands. He looked really occupied with it as he didn’t see Dean approach him. When he finally looked up his eyes widened and traced the blood on Dean’s hand.
The man skipped through the footage, with nothing more different than they already saw. When the time hit 2:17AM and Paul had been sitting in the same spot for 3 hours now, a man suddenly sat across from him. The man was still skipping through it so Dean told him to go back a bit.
Even if Dean sounded like a little fanboy right now he didn’t care. Artists were really underappreciated these days and even if Cas didn’t consider himself as one, he was. He might not make money from it but that didn’t mean he wasn’t an artist. Plus Dean didn’t know where this, somewhat flirty compliments, would take him to so he didn’t care how he sounded.
“Do you know this man?”
Castiel was resting his forehead on Dean’s, blue eyes staring into green, both of them moaning, mouths hanging open.
Dean’s apartment wasn’t that big, or so he thought. The big white hallway was the first thing you walked into when you entered Dean’s home. It was modern, with a big mirror attached to the left wall, with some shelves under it and some paintings and decorations on the continuation of the wall as well. A stripped blue rug was laid across the tiles on the floor. You could see the kitchen table from the front door, which was also connected with the living room. Down the hallway to the right into another small corridor was Dean’s bedroom and the bathroom. Inside the bathroom there were two doors, one leading to the corridor and the other to the bedroom. The bed was a king size one, of course, the wooden wall behind it giving the room a cozy feeling. There was a big TV in front of it, shelves and decorations all around it, the bathroom door to the right. Dean also had a little desk next to the bed and a big wardrobe with sliding doors on the opposite side. The windows were from ceiling to floor with big black curtains. Dean lived on the 11
“Well this kind man here, Tommy, said a man bought 10 big packs of cotton four days ago.” he motioned with his hand to Dean and Cas to come around next to him. “And he showed me the CCTV, even though it’s slight blurry and you can’t see much since the guy’s wearing a hat.”
Dean got frustrated and threw his arms up in defeat.
“You ever showed your art to anyone else?”
Dean felt speechless and he couldn’t say anything for what seemed like forever.
“Cas – FUCK – for God’s sake please just move.”
He took a few more glances around and saw a woman talking to a man with—
“We greatly appreciate it, thank you.” said Castiel instead and they both left the room, Dean picking up his phone.
Castiel shot his eyes up at him with a confused look as he saw the ice. Dean didn’t bother asking him first because he knew Cas’ reply would be ‘no need’ so he just didn’t ask.
He started playing each chord, focusing his gaze on the guitar, instead of Cas. And even though he wasn’t directly looking at Cas he could feel the man’s eyes on him and it made Dean nervous, his palm gripping the neck, sweat. He was probably thinking too much of it, he thought. Cas probably didn’t even find him attractive and his intentions were purely friendly.
“No.” Cas looked him directly in the eyes but then a second later softened and looked away. “I will walk.”
A brown haired woman came in with a concerned look on her face. Dean gestured for her to sit in the chair in front of her.
“Well that was a waste of our time. Why the hell would he send us here?”
“Do you uh, maybe want to come over? I’m a pretty good cook plus my place isn’t too far from here.” that will do for now. Maybe he was moving too fast but right now he didn’t care, he just needed to get out of this situation as quickly as possible and if Dean rejects at least he will know he tried.
“There is nothing to be sorry about, Cas.” he managed to find a tissue in his back pocket. “Hey look at me.”
She frowned and nodded her head. “Yeah I know him. He is a pretty regular customer of ours, comes every two days or so.”
“What are you waiting for boys? Let’s get to work.”
He had a slight smile on his face and Dean in no way wanted to ruin that with the story of his awful dream. He smiled back and took one of the cups.
And with that Castiel’s lips were on Dean’s. He tasted just like he imagined. Sweet but also sour and he never wanted this taste leaving his mouth. Dean made a pleasing sound against Cas’ lips and the vibration of his voice sent shivers down Cas’ spine. Dean was pulling at Cas’ shirt trying to pull him closer and ending up with his back against the wall. He tilted his head backwards to give Cas more room as he started kissing and sucking down his neck. Cas took Dean’s both hands and pinned them above his head, moving his body closer so Dean could feel how hard his cock already was. Dean was trying to get some kind of friction so he started moving his hips against Cas’ leg.
Dean remember he actually hadn’t told Benny about the report of the missing person. He thought to himself he’d explain later and gestured a hand to Benny which he seemed to understand what it meant.
“Yeah… I- sorry.”
– just fuck me already.”
When he finally pushed the door open, he was overwhelmed with the amount of dildos, ropes, handcuffs and literally anything kinky your mind could come up with. The shop smelled like lavender and had bright white lights that made Dean feel a little bit better. The place wasn’t that big and there was definitely a few corners where he could just hide and look for whatever he needed without anyone bothering him.
Dean left out another chuckle and then pressed his lips together. “Son of a-.” he whispered to himself.
The way Cas looked right now, in Dean’s home, made his heart tingle. The fact he was going to play for him made him feel uplifted and even if they were still in uniforms it felt kind of personal as well.
He got up and went to the kitchen to make himself some eggs. He was still sleepy and his hair was a mess but he had enough time until ten to get ready. He set up his eggs and coffee on the table and started eating. His mind was filled with thoughts about the art class. He had never been to one like that before so he had no idea how it was. He wondered who the guy would be and what he would look like. Or why he would take this as a job, wasn’t it awkward to him? A bunch of people watching him stand naked? But to him it was probably normal since that was his job, just like Castiel’s job was to portray him. He quickly finished his breakfast, cleaned up and by the time he got dressed it was already 9:30AM. He grabbed his coat and headed outside.
A soft smile spread across Dean’s face and he grabbed his guitar quickly. “Of course, Cas. Any requests?”
“Castiel.”
“Son of a BITCH!” he screamed in frustration as he was gracing himself up.
Just as he was about to put his phone on the desk, there was a knock on his door.
The ride was pretty much quiet except the occasional awkward coughs Dean gave out. He wanted to keep the conversations for when they got to the bar and it seemed like Castiel didn’t want to say anything either.
Dean looked at him for a second but then replied “Sure.” and Castiel was about to leave when Dean remembered he doesn’t actually have his phone number. “Hey, um agent? A phone number would be nice.”
Cas looked at him with narrowed eyes, a slight tilt to his head. “Dean, you are driving.”
His mind couldn’t stop fantasizing about that man. From his fingers, to his messy hair. His thighs. His dick. Dean needed to touch him, he needed to feel those hands roam his body, needed to feel the lips on his neck, scruff scratching slightly against him. He could only imagine himself pinned down to the bed, Castiel slamming against him. Fuck the guy wasn’t even here yet and Dean was already starting to get hard. Just as he was about to check the time again, there was a bell on his front door.
“There.”
When Benny arrived as well, all three of them went over the whole footage at least three times. They came to the conclusion Paul was in fact unhappy with his marriage and had been drowning in his own misery for God knows how long. Benny moved in his chair and put a hand out to the monitor in front of him.
Once he entered the shop confusion overwhelmed his face. It wasn’t Sam – the owner of the shop standing behind the cashier desk. On his place was another man that made Cas’ breath quicken and his heart racing. The guy didn’t seem to notice him since he was buried deep in the computer, eyes narrowed. Cas shook his head, snapping out of his trance and headed towards the shelves. Who was this guy? Was he new? Did Sam sell the shop? How was he going to shop here if this new dude took every breath from him and made him sweat with nervousness just from first glance? Whatever, he just needed to grab what he needed and worry about this once he runs out of supplies again.
He was breathless just as much as Dean, foreheads against each other. Dean started shaking his head, eyes tracing Cas’ face.
He completely stopped his movement now, squeezing Dean’s head. “Please what, Dean?”
Sure.
“Jesus –
“Five thirty.”
“I can show you later, if you’d like. You know, when it won’t be of danger for both of our lives.”
Cas opened his mouth and their tongues met, exploring each other. Dean’s heart felt like it was going to beat right out of his chest. If the initial kiss felt like a flower blossoming then this felt like a whole garden. Dean was now leaning against Cas, almost all of his weight bracing on his grip and Cas’ hand in his neck. When Cas finally broke the kiss to take a breath, Dean suddenly felt empty without the fullness of Cas’ tongue and the feel of his lips. They were both breathing heavily, catching their breaths, eyes closed. When they calmed down Cas’ fingers gripped Dean’s arm that was still holding onto his t-shirt and his blue, sparkly eyes met with Dean’s green ones.
“There’s nothing here.” said Castiel while looking at the book again.
Cas was leaning against the car with his notebook in his hands again. He seemed to love that thing too much but Dean found that kind of cute. The way he was leaning back against Dean’s own car, with that long black trench coat, his messy hair sticking everywhere and those long fingers gripping that pen. It made Dean feel all sorts of things. He licked his lips and handed him the coffee.
“So, what do you wanna hear?” Dean asked, gripping the neck of his guitar.
Dean hissed slightly as the rag hit his skin. It was cold, the sting bringing a slight bit of pain. The way Cas held his arm, the way he was so gentle with him made Dean have butterflies in his stomach. He was looking down at him with soft eyes and for a moment it felt like it was just them in the world. Dean felt the urge to reach across and put his hand in Cas’ hair but stopped himself just in time. The soft touch of his fingers made Dean close his eyes and drop his head back on his chair.
Jody Mills was one of the best evidence technicians Dean has ever had. She worked fast and with efficiency. You could tell she absolutely loved her job and she didn’t complain over how much work she had like some previous technicians. She had been worked for the department for the past three years and Dean already knew she was the best they’ve had. Some would argue that Dean didn’t require a lot of people. He didn’t have much workers. But in fact he just had less people, but they were the best at doing their jobs. For him it was better to have quality over quantity, which was part of the reason he risked his life as an officer everyday as well, instead of just being the head administrator and a public face of the department. People would say he was being unprofessional but he didn’t care. He cared about helping people more than just sitting in his office all day.
“Hey, I’m gonna head off.”
He started the engine and was looking for some of his cassette tapes to put on.
Dean sighed in frustration and leaned back. “I don’t even know man. We kind of got an opening today which is good.” he scratched his facial hair. “Benny found some pretty interesting things.”
Castiel started nodding, his fingers circling around Dean’s chest. He just got the best fuck of his life and yet he was looking up at this man, thinking how adorable he was with his hair sticking everywhere.
Castiel handed him the bag of ice, as it was half melt already. “Thank you again, for the ice.”
the thing tonight at jimmy’s bar still stands?
When they came to the conclusion that they weren’t going to get anything new from this footage, Benny took the drive to give to Jody and Dean and Cas decided to go question Paul’s wife. Maybe she wasn’t telling the whole truth.
“$23.89 please.” God. Castiel almost forgot he was supposed to be buying stuff and not day dreaming about the cashier. He took out his wallet and handed the money.
“Hey.” said Dean with a smile to his low voice. He started walking towards Cas which made him even more nervous. “Nice drawing.” Dean pointed, stopping right next to it.
Dean looked back at Cas and stopped to think for a second. He wanted to get to know the guy more and he wanted their work to flow smoothly, so maybe bed could wait.
“Uh, well my brother gave me one for my 25
“You uh…” the agent cleared his throat “said you have a brother?”
“You like being tied, Dean?”
“My scar…” he started slowly, barely getting the words out. “I got it when I was 13.” His breath was uneven, words shaky. His eyes were glued to the floor, fingers hooked against the bottle. He wouldn’t dare look up at Dean and all Dean wanted to do was reach to him, touch him, hold him in his arms.
Cas squinted his eyes and tilted his head slightly. “Did you just call me old?”
“You don’t want to work with me that much, huh?” he left out a chuckle but Cas stayed serious and looked out the window without saying anything. Dean’s eyes focused for a brief moment on the agent’s scar again. He licked his lips and put the cassette tape in.
Dean never in a million years thought he’d be doing his, but there he was. Standing in front of the sex shop with people walking by, staring at him because he apparently has been stuck in the same position for 2 minutes. It wasn’t the fact that he was embarrassed to go in or anything it was just… okay maybe he was a little bit embarrassed. He never had to actually buy something for himself, not that he didn’t want to he was just… worried of what people would think when they saw him buy the things he wanted. But at the end of the day everyone there were there for the same reason he was and no one would judge him.
“Okay, Benny that’s all I think. I will see you in the morning, yea?”
“Jesus, Cas, I-…” Dean stood up from the couch and filled Cas a glass of water. He sat down again, closer to the agent this time. He figured actions spoke more than words right now. “I’m sorry wouldn’t even cover the bills but… I’m glad you are here.”
Dean nodded and told Cas to wait outside by the impala to which he nodded as well and they both left Dean’s office.
Cas’ eyes finally shot up at Dean’s. “Don’t be. I used to stare at it a lot too.”
When he finished showering he went to check on his phone and found a message from his assistant Benny.
Dean started walking to check the living room out himself and confirmed there was nothing there that they could take as evidence. They decided to search the rest of the house which was the bedroom and the bathroom but had no succeed in that too. It looked like the man lived on his own since there were no family pictures or anything else that could indicate he had a family. Which was weird. Who doesn’t have at least one picture of their family hanging around somewhere?
Castiel started nodding slowly. “Sounds fun.” he shot a smile at Dean. “Okay.”
Dean felt the urge to lick his lips again as he started nodding slowly. He strung every string to check if the guitar was tuned. He had a lot of songs in his mind and he wondered which one would be the best to present to Cas. He settled on the first song he had ever learnt – Hallelujah. It was his mom’s favorite and he wished he’d been able to play it to her before she passed.
They had a lot of missing parts on the case still. Jody was still finding information about the previous victim, Andrew. With the autopsy done, even though it told them nothing new, gathering information was the next step. They had to find some relatives of Andrew. There was no way he lived alone, didn’t have a job at the time being and had such a nice home to live in, without any debts. Receiving information about victims wasn’t as easy as in the movies. It required a lot more than just searching up a name in the engine and clicking a button. They had to be patient and work with what they had in store right now, deal with the information that came up eventually later.
“Ah no.” he smiled shyly and then continued “Just helping.” Cas nodded slowly and he wasn’t sure if he was supposed to be happy or upset. But there was no way a guy so attractive can be into someone like him. Right? He didn’t think he was unattractive or anything but this man looked like a Greek God next to him.
“Yeah I’m fine Anna, thank you.” he said when Anna didn’t respond to his look and took his pencil. Dean started walking towards the chair and once there, took the position he was going to be in for the next hours. Fuck, it was going to be long four hours.
Cas answered pretty fast to that one, Dean didn’t complain of course. He clicked on the location Castiel sent and it turned out he wasn’t too far from his apartment. Maybe like a 10 minute run. He quickly put on some old ACDC shirt, black sweatpants, his running shoes and basically sprinted the 10 minute run.
“I – no… He had told me he is going out with friends but… I don’t recognize that guy.”
“Oh yeah. I was just with him before they called us in.”
. He was dressed in a white button up shirt, the top two buttons were undone and his sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. He had a tanned skin that perfectly matched his black hair and he was wearing slim fit trousers than hugged his hips and thighs at just the right places. The stranger had his fingers wrapped around a plastic dick, clearly explaining something to the woman, but the thought of those long, slim fingers being wrapped on Dean‘s cock instead had him breathless already.
“You are so good for me, Dean. That’s right, look at me…. –shit I’m-“ Castiel pulled Dean away from his dick, lifting him up from his knees. They locked eyes for a couple of seconds and then Cas’ lips were on Dean, tasting his own precome against Dean’s tongue. It was a messy, loud kiss and Dean’s hands were aching to touch Cas. His jeans had a wet spot on them already, his cock leaking hard trough his boxers.
“All right well, we can take my car.”
“Cas please…”
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean paused for a second and drew in a breath. “But the FBI got on the case as well. And they have some asshole as a boss and he managed to annoy me in the 5 minutes we talked.” he said angrily and looked outside the window. “But enough about me, what about you? Work okay? Eileen okay?”
There were so many things Dean wanted, he wanted Cas to touch him, he wanted to feel his lips on his own, he wanted to taste Castiel’s precome on his tongue. He must be huge, judging by the weight of that cock against him. Dean even wondered if he can take that in his mouth, let alone his ass. But God did he want to. And he was going to, no matter the cost.
“Are you okay, Dean?” He looked genuinely worried, hair now sticking in every position.
As Dean unlocked the front door he felt Cas’ stare on him and it made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. They stepped inside and Cas took off his coat which made Dean lick his lips. The agent’s eyes were roaming everywhere, exploring Dean’s apartment with his gaze.
“Just…” Castiel handed him a card that had a number on it and Dean felt himself stare at those fingers for more than normal. “…text me your address.”
“You are so sexy, you know that?”
Dean turned to face Anna. “You don’t remember this man coming in, he hadn’t ordered anything?”
“I’m…fine.”
Dean looked at him with the corner of his eye. What he said made sense but draw attention from where? Why would the killer want them in this house? Or maybe he was just sick and really did want to just toy with them.
“Well he is 4 years younger than me, so he is 33. Gosh that… made me feel old now.” he laughed and took another sip of his whiskey.
“Did you not hear me? I said, strip.”
And before Cas could say anything else Dean reached for his face and kissed him like his life depended on it. He could feel Cas’ smile against his lips and something was telling Dean
“I will take Novak with me. You take the stores.”
He headed towards the living room and found Cas looking at something on the table. When he approached him he saw it was a book.
“Yeah of course”
“What am I missing..?” Dean said moving his head in denial. His mind drifted away when he heard a knock on his door. “Come in.”
“You are so beautiful, so good.” Cas was close too, chasing his own orgasm as he was pounding into Dean. “Come for me, Dean.”
“Can I help with something?” the voice went from Dean’s ears all the way to his cock. It was a nice firm voice, the vibrations and the roughness of it making Dean weak in the knees. He turned and what he saw was even better. That man, dark hair, deep blue eyes – like the color of the sky, or the ocean on a bright sunny day. A soft scruff across his face, lips full and pink, shirt sleeves rolled up – exposing his perfectly toned arms. And damn those fingers. The badge on the man’s shirt read Castiel.
When Jo gave him the drive he was surprised that they had send it in so early in the day, but he wasn’t going to complain. His charms seemed to work on that bartender girl Dean had already forgotten the name of.
He went around the store and picked out a couple more stuff and then headed to the cashier desk, where Castiel was and placed his orders. They were both just eyeing each other and it was obvious Cas wanted to hear it out of Dean so he finally spoke.
“We don’t know what to think, ma’am.” Castiel cut her off quickly. “We just want to figure out what happened.”
“No touching me, understand?”
“Your name, ma’am?”
“I should tie you up more.”
As he was strumming along, the song coming to an end, he looked up at Cas who was looking back at him, smile reaching his eyes. The way a few hair strands fell on his face made him look like an adorable big baby instead of the mysterious and intimidating man Dean always saw in him.
Dean’s dick was twitching between his own legs, his knees probably already starting to bruise up. But damn did it feel good. Dean felt good being on his knees, pleasing his partner. Pleasing Castiel. And the sounds Castiel made, Dean never wanted to stop. He was moaning against the man’s dick, tasting his precome and swallowing every bit of it. Cas was practically fucking his mouth at this point, both hands on each side of Dean’s face, eyes glued on Dean’s.
He had no response again so Dean put his arm on his shoulder and said his name again, louder this time. The agent started blinking and looked down on his hands, a bloody stain forming on his bandage. He dropped his arms to his sides and shook his head. Dean was searching for his face when he asked him if he was okay. Cas started nodding.
The blue eyed man let out an audible ‘fuck’ and started slowly unbuckling his belt, not leaving Dean a choice but to just watch, his hands tied behind his back. He let his trousers drop to his ankles and he hooked two fingers inside of his waistband making Dean swallow, mouth hanging open already.
“Do you know if he got in some sort of fight last time he was here?”
“As far as I know, no. Considering he killed him somewhere else and just moved the body here there is not much evidence he can leave. You have to ask Bradley though, they are searching for any car traces or anything like that outside.”
“Heya, Sammy.” said Dean as he sat across the table from Sam.
“You can’t zoom in on that?” Dean asked a little more firmly than he intended.
“Special agent Novak is here to see you. Should I send him in?” Dean had almost forgot about the FBI agent. He rolled his eyes and nodded.
Dean gave her some papers to fill in and informed her that if they had any lead she would be the first to know. She gave them everything they needed and left.
“Well I did some research at the library, looked up the history of the Detroit Police Department online and glued the stuff together.” he looked pretty proud of himself. As he rightfully should be. There was a reason he was the chief assistant and a reason Dean picked him as such.
“Sure.” Cas nodded and headed towards the big living room. He was still as quiet as before. The whole ride to here he didn’t say a word nor complaint about Dean’s music like every other person that gets in his car. And the bandage around his palm? He was fine the day before so it must’ve happened during the night or early in the morning. Either way why was Dean so concerned about it? It was probably nothing and he was just overthinking it.
“Cas, these are amazing. I – I really have no words for them.” he swallowed and felt the urge to lick his lips. “When did you start doing this?”
She sounded genuinely worried and scared and they figured she was telling the truth. Dean leaned forward and put his elbows on his thighs.
Dean didn’t know what exactly was going to come out of this whole thing but he knew it was going to be something. And boy was he excited. I mean this man hadn’t even touched him and his dick was already half hard. If he could get him to that state only by talking…
“….Work.”
At that Castiel started thirsting into Dean, his mouth on his neck sucking wet spots, making Dean’s back ache from the bed and his nails dug into Castiel’s back. The room smelled of sweat and sex but neither of them cared. Cas was moving in and out of Dean, making him completely dizzy with every thirst he made. They were both building up to their orgasm and they were both so close but what made it for Dean was Cas grabbing his dick and stroking up and down with fierce. Dean could feel him smirk against his neck. With that Dean came with a loud scream of Castiel’s name, his hands pulling as hard as they can at the sheets. Cas moved his mouth from Dean’s neck to his mouth and started kissing him as he pulled his cock out of Dean and stroked himself as he came on Dean’s stomach. Dean was looking up at Castiel through his lashes and Cas could swear he was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. Dean’s eyes were shining, examing every inch of Castiel’s face. They were both still breathing heavily, the cum on Dean’s stomach getting mixed with Cas’.
Benny smiled at him and entered his car. “You got it, chief.” and the sound of the engine echoed in the distance.
“Hey chief.” Benny greeted him and sat on the chair across Dean.
Castiel took the water and wiped his eyes with his hand then looked over at Dean, locking stares. His eyes were sparkly, gaze soft. It made Dean feel at peace and he hoped Cas could feel that as well. “Thank you.” His voice was low, almost a whisper.
“Well I enjoyed the chit-chat, gentlemen but my eyes cannot keep me up any longer.” Benny said and got up from his seat and took his jacket. “Will see you tomorrow though.”
Right now though Dean was tired and he needed to get some sleep, because tomorrow they finally had some concrete evidence to go through. He took a hot shower, snuggled in his bed sheets and fell asleep.
He put his hands in his jeans pockets and slowed his walking. “How about now? We can… drink a beer or something and you can hear my awesome guitar skills.” Dean let out a laugh to mask how nervous he was. He couldn’t tell if that worked or not.
“Let me blow you… please.” He sounded so needy but he didn’t even care. Castiel turned him around to face him again, thumb sliding across Dean’s bottom lip.
“Dean what the hell? What happened, are you okay?” he asked, closing his notebook and putting it back in his pocket.
“Hello, Mr.Wincheser. I’m special agent Castiel Novak and I’m here to discuss some things about
He was starting to get annoyed at him already. He clenched his teeth and replied. “Yeah… Whatever you say.”
Castiel commanded and sat on Dean’s bed, leaving him standing in the middle of the room, his cock hard and leaking in his jeans, neck marked.
Castiel nodded slightly and smiled, letting out the long breath he was holding.
There was silence in the car for a few minutes, the cloudy weather outside making the atmosphere cozy. It didn’t even feel like they were driving to solve a case, but rather going for a sweet ride with no direction.
He licked his lips and continued to look, his eyes landing on a pair of standard metal handcuffs. They weren’t that much expensive and they really fit Dean’s taste. They weren’t anything fancy – Dean hated that. He didn’t like handcuffs that were all puffy and soft, with bright colors. He liked the normal ones, the ones he could feel the rough metal against his wrists. The pretty things were for other stuff.
Dean opened his mouth to say something but then shut it immediately, pressing his lips together. “Right.”
They talked for a couple hours. First about the case, Cas and Dean explaining to Benny about how Dean got stabbed, about Lindsey and her husband Paul and about Cas’ little fight. They talked about the alleged suspect they know have, even if they didn’t know his face yet. ‘Small steps at a time’ was how Benny replied to that and he was right. The important thing was that they now had two footages they can review over and over. After that they started talking about literally everything else, but work. Which felt good and refreshing that they didn’t have to worry about it all, even if they were still worried. They got a lot of work done in one day and they deserved a little break.
“Thanks.” Dean replied and huffed with a smile as well. The way Cas was standing in front of him made him look at his bandaged palm which was still bloody.
Benny was telling them a story about how as a child he got caught drawing graffiti under some bridge by the police and now he was a police officer himself. They all laughed and smiled, even Cas, which Dean found really cute and made his heart skip a few beats.
“I should probably go,” Cas suggests.
Dean glares at Benny and he smiles back, taking a sip of his beer. He rubs his hands over his face and groans before finally agreeing.
Dean rolls his eyes and attempts a laugh. He’s not tapping his leg anymore and he’s slumped back in his seat a little more as well, which leads Cas to the conclusion that the difference between then and now is that, today, the rest of the band was later than usual.
“You’ve been asked to perform at the Grammys this year,” Bobby responds.
Dean sips his coffee, staring out the window of the coffee shop, refusing to look at Castiel.
“I just-he wasn’t supposed to be here and then he called me-,” Dean stops for a second. “I shouldn’t have gone off on him, I-I just, I lost it.”
“I actually have a lot of things to do today,” Cas cuts him off.
Dean pulls up to the apartment building ten minutes later. He remembers Cas put a code in, but Dean doesn’t have the code, so he searches for some sort of call box.
“I’m really happy for you, Cas,” Jess says before closing her book and pulling the comforter up to her chest.
“What? Why?” Dean asks, confused.
Caroline jokingly swoons and the three of them talk for a bit longer while other guests wish Dean a happy birthday in passing.
“Yeah, I think I will too, actually,” Dean says, licking his lips.
About two hours later, they finish up and Dean gets up from the couch.
“So, you’re letting Cas cook?” Claire asks, making a face. “We might have to grab something after we get outta here,” she whispers to Kaia.
“What’d you just say?” He says, glaring at the reporter standing in front of him.
“Fine, for fucks sake, I’ll go talk to him,” Dean says.
“Oh, remember that guy I told you about? Met him at the Roadhouse, the song from the sushi bar?” Dean says.
Cas has been staying at Dean’s most nights since Christmas. Cas insists it’s not because of what happened with John, but Dean’s pretty sure it is. It’s not like he needs a babysitter or anything, but he has been enjoying waking up next to Cas every morning.
“Meg,” Dean flashes her a smile, “I don’t know if you recognized me or not, but I’m Dean Winchester and I-“
Dean brings the plates back to the table and he and Cas sit down in front of them.
Dean doesn’t have a problem singing in front of people, obviously. I mean, hell, he’s made a career out of it. He just doesn’t feel up to it tonight, but he knows if he refuses, that’ll prompt Sam to play 20 questions with him on the ride home, and he’s not about to willingly subject himself to that. So, he rolls his eyes, flashes a playful smile, and walks over to the stage. He whispers to the DJ, then pulls out his phone and hands it to him and walks over to the mic.
“That bad in the sack, huh?”
“It’s on the house. I know the owner,” Dean winks.
“Go home, Sam,” Dean grumbles at him.
When Dean finally gets back to the Impala, he turns the key and listens to the car roar to life. God, he loves that sound. The stereo cuts on and starts blaring AC/DC’s Back in Black through the speakers. He groans and turns it off. Looks like it’s about to be a silent drive to the closest Waffle House. He needs something greasy and you can find a Waffle House on the corner of just about every road in Nashville.
“I’ll be with Sam and Jess in our seats,” he says.
Dean can’t look at Cas. He’s trying so hard not to break down right now that he just stares at his untouched food.
“So, uh, I actually have to leave for work in about half an hour,” Cas starts as he turns to look at Dean, “but you’re welcome to-,” he drops off, a look of concern spreading across his face. “What happened to your jaw? I didn’t do that last night, did I?” Cas asks, apologetically.
And a slow, loud response “…Dean?”
“Okay, uh…” Dean looked down to see her name badge. “…Anna. You have cameras in this place right?” she started nodding. “Mind if we check the footage?” he made sure to lick his lips and smirk when the words left his mouth.
“Man, you hit hard.” he said as he put the bag in the sink to deal with later.
“I’m pretty sure we are the same age, dude.” When he said that Dean’s leg accidently bumped into Castiel’s and they shared a look. Cas swallowed slowly and Dean watched his adam’s apple go up and down his throat. What were this guy’s intentions? It was confusing Dean to the core. He closed his eyes and looked away.
“Yes.”
I – I want your cock Cas, no- shit I
“Cas…” his name in Dean’s mouth like that sounded so good. It was like honey. “Please...” the pleading sounds he made made Castiel’s dick twitch in response.
If it wasn’t for Cas nudging Dean’s arm off of his shoulder he would’ve totally forgotten it’s there. Cas didn’t sound mad or angry, it was more like he was upset or tired. Like he didn’t want to tell Dean what’s up because he didn’t want to burden him with it. Dean opened his mouth to say something else but closed it immediately. He didn’t want to make Cas any more upset than he already was. Instead he just nodded and tongued the inside of his cheek.
“Shit – I think this was the best fuck I’ve ever received.” said Dean smirking. Cas returned the smile and grabbed both sides of Dean’s face to kiss him.
He looked serious so Dean couldn’t catch if he was joking or not. Was he trying to annoy him or something?
“What? What does the FBI want with this case? Don’t they have enough on their plate to start jumping in on our case?” he could feel his palms starting to sweat again and he started feeling anxious. He was angry and you could tell by his voice and change of tone. He really didn’t like when people were questioning his motives for his work and the FBI were just these kind of guys.
thank you for coming to read chapter two!
They asked her a couple more questions hoping something, anything would come up as helpful but unfortunately, nothing. She was upset and they didn’t want to disturb her any further.
“2 days ago. He said he was going out with some friends to a bar but never came back. Doesn’t pick up his phone either. Which is very unlike him. I mean he has his phone with him all the time.”
“Let’s just… get back to the department.” Dean said and started walking towards the driver’s spot.
Dean nodded slowly, almost to himself. He loved people that read, intelligent people that were not afraid to admit they were a sucker for books or art. He also loved listening to people talk about the thing they are passionate about. He loved seeing the spark in their eyes, the same spark Castiel had right now.
They sat in silence for a while, until Cas broke it again. “Can you… can you play something else?”
“Nice car.”
“Well… talented people are always harsh on themselves. I know from personal experience.” Castiel replied and resumed scribbling away in his notebook.
“I must admit, your pieces are beautiful man.” Dean was admiring every piece Cas had hung up on his wall. He had quite a lot and all of them he was really proud of.
“Come just from your cock? Yes, I did.”
“What exactly?”
He waved his hand off. “It’s nothing, don’t worry. What’s up?”
Tommy played the footage and their thoughts matched with it. It was the same guy from the bar. Same clothes, same cap. The only difference was that it was slightly bit more zoomed, equally bad camera quality. Dean left out a breath, which looked like he was holding in for a while and then left out a chuckle. Benny narrowed his eyes at him.
Cas took his time taking the bag but eventually he did and put it on his bruised knuckles. Dean went around to grab his guitar then sat down on the couch as well. He took a sip of his beer and put it on the small table in front of him.
As Dean was taking out his car keys he stopped in front of him. “Come on, let’s go.”
Dean started taking his gun and badge. “No. Take Zeke with you.”
Not even a minute later a man walked in in Dean’s office. His eyes shot up and the man he saw surprised him. He was dressed all black, a black trench coat with the FBI logo in front of it. He had dark hair and blue eyes, full pulp lips and he had some kind of burned scar on the left side of his neck. He was like a dark prince out of a movie and Dean definitely did not expect him to look like that.
When she calmed down a bit she explained how much Paul was jealous, how he didn’t let her go out for a ‘girls night’.  How he would tell her what to and not to wear. Eventually this brought them to a lot of fighting, which was also the reason Paul was gone with days, drinking his pain away in a bar. Maybe their relationship wasn’t what some people would call – healthy – but Lindsey clearly cared about him despite his possessive behavior.
Dean was kind of surprised Castiel would assume he is a Dom especially with the way he was eyeing him. But maybe he wanted to get it out of Dean himself? He took the cuffs and examined them closer.
Castiel was talking on the phone with Benny when Dean came back from the bathroom in his office with a wet cloth for his arm. He sat down in his chair and started cleaning up the dried blood. Cas was looking at him while nodding to whatever Benny was saying over the phone.
“It does catch the eye doesn’t it.” Castiel finally interrupted Dean’s thoughts. And he wasn’t even looking at him, he was looking out the window, which caught Dean off guard.
“Let me.” his voice was soft and Dean couldn’t protest anymore. He leaned back in his chair and sighed. Castiel settled in front of him on his knee so he could easily reach up his arm.
Dean smiled and looked down. “I’m Dean by the way. But I figured you already know that.”
Castiel was looking at him with this empty gaze, like he was looking directly through him. Did he seem weird? He didn’t want to sound awkward and he wasn’t trying to make this a date, he just wanted a drink right now. Plus, two is better than one.
He looked like he was ashamed or that whatever caused this Dean wouldn’t understand him. Which was wrong. He would. And he was sure if Cas was ready to tell his story to Dean he would. But just not yet, and Dean respected that. He took a new bandage and wrapped it up around the agent’s palm and down his wrist. When he saw done Castiel finally looked down at him and licked his lips.
Castiel looked behind Dean as if he was going to see who did this to him or figure out what happened without Dean telling him. His eyes were narrowed, his breath heavy, those blue eyes staring into the nothing.
He ran a hand through his hair and walked himself to the bathroom, taking a cold shower. It was a habit of his every time after a nightmare. To take a cold shower. It made him calm down at least a little bit. After he was done with the shower he cleaned the cut on his arm, letting it breath this time. They had a lot of work today as well, so he quickly put on his uniform and grabbed his phone. Dean’s mind had this one thought the whole drive to the Department: should he tell Cas about his dream?
He was still very bluntly staring at him, like he tried to remember every little detail. He didn’t know what to say either so the situation got even more awkward. His eyes traced down to Cas’ neck. He didn’t like staring at his mark because Cas would probably think he was judging him which wasn’t like that at all. He was just curious about it. And it looked hot on him.
That deep morning voice sent a whole shiver down Dean’s spine, the way his name sounded on Cas’ tongue like this didn’t help at all.
Dean wasn’t looking at him but he could hear the slight smile in Cas’ voice. He smirked too and started nodding. “I’d love to.”
Charlie drew in a long breath and shook her head “I’d say… 12 hours at least. Maybe more.”
“The uh… The FBI are stepping up.” the room was filled with silence after that for what seemed like minutes.
They were looking at each other with a gaze softer than a feather. When Cas looked away at the window he smiled again.
That voice was like pure honey to Dean’s ears. He wanted to hear it non stop, he wanted to know how his name would sound on Castiel’s lips. And despite him being a few inches shorter than Dean, he had this highness in him and the way he spoke, so fondly and professionally made Dean want to obey everything that came out of his mouth.
When he arrived his brother was already waiting for him at one of the tables. They haven’t seen each other since Dean started working on the case. He smiled softly and approached him.
They were running in silence, Dean admiring the way Cas’ hair was moving up and down, sticking to his sweaty forehead. Dean usually worked out but he was nowhere near Cas’ skills. It was like the man had been running his whole life, he didn’t even hitch a breath. Plus Cas’ body was pretty distracting which didn’t make Dean run any faster. He was falling behind though so he picked up his pace, Castiel now a couple of steps in front of him.
touched him. His hand, those long, slim fingers were wrapped around Dean’s erect dick through his boxers. He let out a shaky breath, closing his eyes, for which he immediately lost the touch.
The bar had quite a lot of people in it, considering it was the middle of the day. Just as they started walking towards the bar stand a very clearly drunk man bumped into Castiel. He stumbled a little bit backwards, balancing himself on one of the tables with his hand. When the man looked up at Cas he started laughing.
“Nope. Get goin’,” He says.
“I said nothing, Dean,” Cas shoots a quick, but stern look at Dean before getting out of the Impala and walking inside.
“Yeah, I guess,” Dean says.
“Whatcha wanna watch, Cas?” Dean asks, not taking his eyes off the tv.
There isn’t much decorating the spacious interior at the moment. Benny moved in about a week before Christmas, so all that’s really set up as far as Dean can tell are a couple couches in the living room, a pool table in the den and a table with two chairs around it in the kitchen.
. Like, to
“Sorry about the mess,” Cas says, picking up the rest of the clothes Dean neglected.
Camera lights are flashing from every direction. He’s been to award shows before, but he doesn’t remember them ever being this intense. People are shouting his name to get him to look their way and he does his best to make sure he catches everyone at least once.
They make out for a few more minutes and then Cas flips them over so that he’s on top and he begins to unbuckle his pants.
“Benny, Lee. Lee, Benny,” he says introducing the two men.
“I know you are, and I know sometimes it may seem like Dean doesn’t get it, but believe me, he does. Our dad isn’t exactly the most accepting person, I mean you saw what happened on Christmas,” Sam says.
“Uh, wait, hang on Cas,” Dean says as he stops him.
“Got a nice grip there, son,” Bart smiles. “You boys come on in.”
Dean smiles around Cas’ cock and he continues to bob his head, licking the underside of his dick each time he comes back up.
“I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t fucking know!” Dean says, rubbing his hands over his face.
“Anyone else?” Cas asks, still annoyed.
I know you got blue eyes
“Believe it or not, Cas, this ain’t my first rodeo,” Dean says. “I’ve pretty much been in charge of Thanksgiving dinner since I learned how to work a stove.”
Dean takes a couple steps back. That was the last thing he expected to come out of Cas’ mouth.
About fifteen minutes into the documentary, Dean’s woken up by Cas nudging him in the side.
“Look, you were acting weird at the party and then after the party when we got back here and you’re acting weird now. What the fuck is going on, Cas? Talk to me,” Dean pleads.
“What did my dad say to you?” Cas asks.
“Sorry,” Eileen says.
“You must be Dean,” she says when she finally lets go of her son.
“Comin’ up!” Ellen says as she makes her way back towards the tap.
Castiel chuckles, “just wanna make sure you’re okay first.” Dean can tell Cas is enjoying this just as much as he is as he inserts a second finger into Dean’s ass, grinning as Dean tenses back up.
“Thank you,” he smiles.
“I’ve been banging on your door for twenty minutes, Dean. What the hell took you-what the fuck happened to your arm?”
“Don’t worry, I have heat lamps,” Dean says as he points with his tongs to two large lamps on either side of the spacious deck.
As soon as they’re inside, Dean pushes Cas up against the door and crashes his lips into his. Cas reaches up and rests a hand on the back of Dean’s head, kissing him back.
Dean laughs, ruffles his brother’s shaggy hair and climbs out of the car.
A series of “yes’” and “mhm’s” answer his question as everyone packs onto the shuttle. Cas notices Dean is getting antsy again so he places his hand on Dean’s knee and starts rubbing it with his thumb. Dean smiles at him and puts his hand on top of Cas’. Only a few short hours and they’ll be safely back in Nashville.
Bobby types something into his computer and then looks up at Dean.
Castiel doesn’t answer him, so he finally looks over at him and he’s met with Cas just staring at him with adoration.
“Can we run it again?” He asks Bobby. Then he turns to look at his band, “can we run it again?”
“Fuck Sam, stop doing what he tells you to do,” Dean grumbles again, not taking his eyes off of the man next to him.
“I don’t know about you
“Yeah, I know, I’ve had a lot of shit going on,” Dean says in response.
“See ya later, Sammy,” Dean says, rushing to shut the car door before Sam can protest the nickname again.
Before he does, though, Cas catches his arm.
“Wow. You’ve really done well for yourself, huh?” he says.
“Do you know everyone in this town?” Castiel teases.
“You wrote that in a night?” Jess asks in awe.
“He just gave me some good advice. Peace of mind,” he says. Cas doesn’t pry. Dean pulls out of the driveway and heads back to the hotel.
“Hey,” she says, sympathetically, “what’s got you in a funk?”
“I mean, what kinda guy do you think I am? I would never take advantage of you in your, uh,
They made plans to meet back at Dean’s house for dinner, so Dean heads out to the grocery store so he can make Cas a proper meal.
“Lately, though, you’ve flown to LA, Oklahoma, New York...why is this one any different?” Cas chimes in.
Sam looks back and forth between the two of them, unable to speak.
“What’s all this? You handing out hugs without me, Nay?” He says, pulling Cas in for a side hug.
The rest of the band gives Ellen their orders and then they make their way over to the pool table for a couple games. Dean stays seated at the bar talking to Jo for a minute to catch up. He’s about to get up and join his bandmates when someone at the end of the bar catches his eye. A tall figure with dark hair and bright blue eyes.
Bobby doesn’t say anything. He just searches Dean’s face for who knows what. When he doesn’t find it, he relaxes.
Cas laughs, “that good, huh? Okay, I guess I’ll go with that then.”
He slides his thumb over Dean’s slit, spreading precome over the head of Dean’s dick. Dean moans and reaches down to jerk himself off until Cas pulls his hand away.
“Well, I hope all goes well. I’ll grab you one of the pies I made today.”
Dean laughs and nudges Charlie’s arm as he pulls a chair up from another table.
“Alright boys, let’s go give Dean a good time, huh?” Benny says, attempting to lighten the mood.
Dean looks at him with a scowl on his face,
Dean, Cas, and Bart all take seats comfortably in the Novaks’ living room while Naomi finishes dinner.
“Lee?” Dean questions, having little memory of the previous night.
“Just a round of whatever’s on tap, El. And I’ll take a bacon burger.” Dean cut in. Ellen may be small, but she’s a force to be reckoned with and he’s gotta protect his drummer from getting his ass handed to him.
It’s been a little over a year since Cas came out to his parents. He’d reached out to his brothers and his sisters, most of which had already seen the news and told him they love him regardless. A lot has happened over the last year. Sam and Jess got engaged, Charlie and Gilda moved in together, Benny and Andrea found out they’re expecting, and Dean and his band went on the best North American tour leg he’s ever done, with Cas right by his side for each and every show. He couldn’t have asked for a better year. Everything was absolutely perfect.
“Dinner’s ready!” Cas shouts. Everyone files into the dining room to take their seats at the table. Eileen prepared a steak dinner with mashed potatoes, cheesy broccoli, corn on the cob, and buttered rolls.
'Cause when you do that thing right there
“Mhm,” Cas says in response.
“Not really in the mood to talk right now, Cas,” Dean says over the running water.
with him. Castiel. He remembers his name was Castiel, and he had the most beautiful blue eyes Dean has ever seen. The rest of the night comes back to him in flashes and he remembers he left his number on Castiel’s counter. He immediately rolls over to check his phone, which brings the nausea rushing back, causing him to jump up and bolt to the bathroom.
“I’m gonna grab a beer,” Cas says, flatly.
“She sent me over here because she wasn’t in the mood to burst a vein in her head having to deal with you tonight, Benny,” Jo fires at him.
“You take care of yourself.”
Dean steps back a few feet, holding his face and he locks eyes with John. He’s grinning, the piece of shit. If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d think John actually enjoys this. And who knows, maybe he does. But Dean knows John’s drunk. He always is. He’ll regret this when he sobers up, if he remembers it when he sobers up.
Cas clears his throat and sits up straight.
Dean realizes right after he says it that this admission is going to prompt the same damn game of 20 questions on the car ride home that he would’ve gotten if he hadn’t gotten up there at all. He sighs and answers her honestly,
She stops kissing him for a second and looks down at him.
“Enough, dad. Get the hell out!” Dean shouts.
“Dean, I can’t let you pay m’tab, I had a lot of drinks and dinner,” Castiel recants, emphasizing the word ‘and’.
Dean doesn’t move, still doesn’t say a word. He hears his hotel room door shut a few seconds later and his head falls onto his arm resting on the balcony.
“Mmm mhm,” Dean responds, refusing to pull away from Cas.
Cas moves out of Dean’s arms.
“I’m just really tired, I need a good night’s sleep,” he responds.
“I—uh,” he clears his throat, “I’m Dean. Dean Winchester,” he says, proudly.
“Hmm,” Benny says.
He made plans to meet Sam and Jess at the Roadhouse for a few drinks, so he tells Bobby and the guys that he’s heading out.
“Fifteen minutes,” the woman with the clipboard tells them.
“Y’all have been absolutely amazing tonight! Now who’s ready for Luke Bryan?!” Dean drags out the end of Luke’s last name as the crowd cheers.
“See you soon, Cas.”
“Morning, sunshine,” Dean says, his voice low.
Dean and Cas walk back out to the rental in the driveway. Once they’re inside, they sit for a moment in silence before Dean turns the car on.
Dean leans in and kisses him before walking back over to the stove to finish plating the pancakes. Cas puts AG in her booster and takes a seat next to her as Dean brings the food to the table.
“What would you say to spending Christmas with me, Sam and Jess?”
“No,” Cas laughs, “that would be a lot of Novaks in my tiny apartment. Several of my siblings have families, so it’s just better that they stay in Kansas.”
Castiel starts cracking up while Dean sits there with that smug grin still on his face, stretching from ear to ear. See? He knew he was funny, Sam can kiss his ass.
“Yeah, yeah, couldn’t get this one outta bed,” Benny winks.
You and me, let's lose it”
“Yes ma’am,” Dean smiles again and opens the door to leave.
TW// Homophobic language, violence when John shows up.
“Yes, Dean.”
Confused, Dean pulls his phone out and sends Cas a text.
Castiel hasn’t looked away from Dean yet, studying him. Dean reaches up and brushes the back of his neck awkwardly.
“Dean? It’s almost midnight,” Cas says, voice groggy. Dean can tell he woke Cas up.
“Dean!” Benny screams into the phone. Benny’s loud when he’s sober, so drunk Benny is amplified by 10, “the hell’d you run off to? the boys and i was waitin’ on ya ta join us but ya walked out with some poor bastard hangin’ off yer shoulder and ya never came back!”
“So, that song was written about someone you met the other night? Why didn’t you tell me about it?” Sam starts.
“Mmmmhmhmm,” is the only sound Dean can manage before taking a few deep breaths, eyes squeezed shut again.
“Come on, let’s get you up off the floor,” Sam says, pulling Dean to his feet.
“Because I didn’t wanna play twenty questions about it, goddamn!” Dean raises his voice. He doesn’t mean to; his dad is just a sensitive topic. He closes his eyes and rubs his hand over his face, “I’m sorry. I just, it’s not that big of a deal, Cas. It’s just a bruise.”
Tell me everything ‘til there’s nothing I don’t know about you”
“Sam,” Dean cuts him off, “I really don’t feel like talking about this.”
“Great,” Dean replies, rolling his eyes.
“Right? Me either! But the manager of the hotel insisted I try it and when I did, I immediately fell in love with the flavor.”
That’s when Cas looks up at him.
“I just want Chuck gone. Whatever it takes. So, are we gonna do this or are we gonna sit here and talk about our feelings all damn day?” Dean says. He raises an eyebrow at Sam, who sighs and gets up from the table.
“You call?” Dean asks.
“Okay, Dean. And stop calling me Sammy,” Sam complains.
“Mostly country, but I grew up on classic rock too, so when I’m not performing and I’m just playing for fun, I’ll play a little of that.”
“Cas, come on, man. We can figure this out. Please.”
Dean can tell Cas doesn’t really believe him as he glances at the shirt again.
“Tonight,” Dean confirms. He kisses Cas again and then watches as he leaves, glad this drama is finally over.
He tears one off the ribbon and rips open the package, but when he turns around to get back on the bed, Cas’ eyes are closed and he’s quietly snoring. He smiles, though, slightly disappointed.
He closes his eyes and begins stroking himself. He pictures Cas again, sliding his hand up and down Dean’s shaft. He imagines how Cas’ mouth would feel, taking all of him in. He moans and feels his knees go weak, so he puts his other hand up against the shower wall in front of him to keep himself from falling. He strokes himself faster and harder until he comes. He opens his eyes, breathing heavily, and watches as the water washes away the mess. He finishes washing his hair and body and gets out of the shower. When he glances at the clock, it’s almost 8:30.
How one of us moved on, one of us got stuck
10 minutes later, they pull up to a place called Abaddon’s Little Devils.
Dean leans down to kiss Cas’ neck and he whispers,
“We’ll pick up some condoms on the way home from the party tonight and then we can really celebrate. Sound good?” Dean proposes.
“Are you sure?” Dean asks.
Cas walks into the kitchen and turns towards the stove, his back to Dean.
“Hurry up, Cas. We gotta pick up Sam and Jess before we head to the airport.”
apartment.”
“We just finished the last song on the album. Bobby sent us home for the night.” Dean replied. They’ve been working day and night on this album for almost a year. Dean had a handful of songs from the beginning that he wanted on this album, but he wants it to be perfect, so he took his time choosing the rest of the tracks.
Cas clears his throat and snaps Dean back to reality. He realizes he hasn’t said anything back. His face turns hot and he rubs a hand over the back of his neck.
“What the
“Nah, you can just borrow one of mine. When I find it, I’ll give it to ya,” Benny says.
“Then don’t do it for us. Do it for you. Do it because you deserve better than this. You deserve to be treated like the great guy I know you are,” Benny says.
It’s only the middle of the day, but Dean is already exhausted, so he and Cas lay in his bed the rest of the day watching Christmas movies until they both finally doze off.
One of us don't even notice when the radio plays that song
“No,” Cas takes a deep breath, “no, I have to do this.”
“Yes, they are. My mother couldn’t wait to pass down her recipes. I think she was ready to pass the torch onto us so that she wouldn’t have to worry about cooking for six anymore,” Castiel shares.
Dean thinks for a moment and he doesn’t see why not. He knows Sam and Jess won’t mind.
else.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says back, “you, uh, you look good.”
“Thanks, Sammy,” Dean says, grinning.
” Dean swears as he steps out into two feet of snow. He heads back inside to grab a coat and to change out of his favorite cowboy boots and into an older pair. He forgot that it’s the middle of December. Was there this much snow on the ground last night when he’d gotten home? Whatever, he needs food. He walks over to the garage, punches the code in and watches the door rise to reveal an empty garage.
Cas feels heat rising on the back of his neck at the site of Benny kissing Dean, even if it was just on the cheek.
“Okay, my parents’ flight lands at noon. I’m gonna leave here in just a few minutes to go pick them up. Are you okay holding down the fort until I get back?” Cas asks.
“I’ll be off around 5. Maybe we can do something,” Cas says as he starts to walk out of the bathroom.
“C’mon, Cas. If I tell you, it won’t come true,” Dean smirks.
“Nice. I’m from Lawrence. Moved here almost 15 years ago with my dad and brother, then I started my music career. What brought you all the way out here?”
“Well, I sure hope you won, at least,” he says back seemingly unconvinced. “We’re gonna need to put you in a cast and you’ll need a few stitches. I’ll be right back.”
“What’s good here?” Cas asks, pulling Dean out of his thoughts.
“I would love some, thank you,” Cas responds, walking over to kiss Dean good morning. “Happy birthday,” he says.
“But?”
“It’s okay, Sammy. He’s gonna be okay,” Dean says, wrapping his arm around his brother.
“I can’t do this, Dean. I can’t-,” Cas stops and leans forward to get the attention of the driver so he can give him the address to his apartment.
Just as Jo sets their drinks down on the table, Dean looks up and sees Cas walk into the bar.
Sam rests his hand on Cas’ shoulder.
“Cas, please,” he says.
“I appreciate that, Sam. It took a lot for me to do that, but it was something that had to be done. I don’t want Dean to feel like I’m ashamed of him…of us. This whole thing is just unknown territory for me. I’m learning as I go,” Cas says.
What’s your dream job, mmm
“You think you could handle that?” Cas jokes.
They manage their way to the elevator and up to Castiel’s apartment on the eighth floor. Castiel struggles with the key but manages to open the door after dropping it and cursing a few times as Dean laughs at him.
They make their way into the house and Cas just kind of stands there in the doorway, completely awestruck.
It hit stores at midnight and three of the songs on the album are already in the top 10. The album itself has made it to the number one spot on the Country charts. He can’t help but feel proud of himself and his band. They worked really hard for this.
Dean’s face goes hot as he leans over and asks the bartender for another whiskey on ice.
The room is silent for what feels like forever as Naomi and Bart exchange looks with each other, and then with Dean and Cas.
“Yeah, you give horrible gifts,” Dean teases.
“I guess that’s fine. Lemme just, uh, pay my tab.”
They pull into the driveway of Cas’ childhood home at a quarter to 5. Cas doesn’t move at first, so Dean watches him and waits.
Dean speaking doesn’t faze Castiel one bit because despite Deans objections, he presses kisses down Dean’s neck and he nips at Dean’s ear.
“I knew you’d eventually replace me for Benny. Is it because I won’t sleep with you?” Charlie jokes.
Dean raises his eyebrows to reiterate that he’s waiting on Cas to respond.
The rest of the night goes great. They’re all laughing and telling stories. Dean is really enjoying himself and he can tell that Cas is too.
“Well, right now, it’s like 85% hard, but once I get my pants off and that condom on, we’ll be at full power,” Dean jokes.
Towards the end of the night, Dean comes up behind Cas and wraps an arm around his shoulders.
“Oh, I love you the
But I never walk up and talk to
Dean scoffs as he stares down at his phone. He reads the text a few more times to make sure he didn’t misread it. Nope, Cas ignored him intentionally.
Dean’s face heats up as he looks down at his feet. Lee takes a few steps closer to Dean.
Benny laughs as he flips Dean off and then claps him on the back.
“Sammy, you’re 23. It’s okay to stay out late and have fun.”
