“Ouch.” He wipes sloppily at his mouth with the back of his hand. “I dare you. I’ll swap you a fistful of pie for your fleece. You wanted to give it to me so bad earlier, you freak of nature with your bleeding heart.”
“Okay,” he replies, frowning. “I’m sorry. You asked some questions and I thought it would be most efficient to give you the one answer that fits all. I never expected you to reciprocate.”
“Right. Well. You better get in the shower. You have to leave soon, don’t you? Make sure to text me when you get there, so I don’t worry about you on the road.”
“Wouldn’t the better question be what isn’t?” He laughs humourlessly. “Are we talking again now?” The beer makes him a little braver. Enough to at least confront it. “Or are we doing a thing where we go between realising there’s a mountain of shit between us and ignoring it. As if we’re friends again.”
“I can’t believe I’m having to ask this again within a five minute window, but what the hell? Seriously, what the fuck was all of that?
“I hate that you lost your virginity to her. I hate it,” Dean rampages on, oblivious to Cas’ growing disinterest in the matter of April. “It should have been with someone else, Cas. Someone that knows how great you are the way I do.”
After dinner, the dinner which Dean keeps picking at until there’s only half a portion left and they end up just picking at the rest with their fingers and eating standing in the kitchen, they meander in a sleepy direction towards Dean’s bedroom.
“Go on. I’m not stopping you.” John looks so deflated it makes Cas feel a little sympathy for the man. Cas imagines he would derail off the course of healthy habits and normalcy too if the most important person to him in the world perished in a fire. He imagines his fall from grace to be legendary, were he unable to save his most important person. He looks to Dean, heart racing.
Belatedly, they both realise they’re still locked in a far too intimate embrace. Both of Cas’ hands are tucked into Dean’s arm now. They’re standing closer than normal even for them. Their foreheads are almost touching and unconsciously, Dean’s eyes flicker to Cas’ lips. Not because he wants to—God—kiss him or anything. He’s just vividly aware that that must be what it must’ve looked like was about to happen. Because that’s what they had been trying to emulate. Yeah. Just Dean doesn’t remember them drifting closer together like this and the plan was only to stride in, arm in arm like a casual couple, not—
Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, it doesn’t seem to upset anyone. It makes them all crack into another set of tittering convulsions.
“Last night was fine,” Dean assures, the heavy pressure of guilt pressing into the pit of his stomach. He sits himself on the floor next to his brother and pats him on the shoulder. He realises that Cas is standing in front of them now and he locks eyes with him when he says, “we all say and do stupid shit, Sam.”
“Benny, I’m gonna level with you,” responds Dean after a moment of quiet from their booth, “I’m not sober enough to understand half of what you just said. All I know is if Cas wants to grow tomatoes in cow shit, then I’m gonna build him a fancy fuckin’ shed to do it in.”
The amount of effort it took for him to perform that scoff doubles the brain pain and he groans loudly, dramatically, because he feels like being extra grouchy today. He supposes he fell asleep for the first time in a long time last night, but he’s not woken up feeling well-rested at all. He also feels physically disgusting, like he’s been dragged through mud and sweat and excrement. He needs a shower.
“Pretty,” he hums, dropping his hand and slumping into Dean once more. He doesn’t wait for Dean’s response, because right now, from the side, Dean looks a little stunned. He asks again, “Why are you here?”
“So...” Dean starts, breaking the seventeen-minute silence between them both in the car. He’s been counting. He taps the steering wheel thrice. “Guess she didn’t have that hard of a time believing we were already…um...you know. That was surprisingly easy.”
He feels his best course of action is probably just to be honest. “I don’t really understand what’s going on right now, Dean,” he explains.
“Can you…can you pass me my boxers please? They’re at the foot of the bed,” Cas says, rubbing a hand down his face.
“Doesn’t anybody here know not to creep up on a guy with a gun? Especially after all this shit today!” Dean yells.
“Why do you give a shit?” he demands angrily instead. “It’s not like I’ve been raking in any best friend of the year awards lately. Why are you sitting here, throwing me a fucking pity party as if the ones I throw for myself aren’t enough? Why did you stay when I asked you to? Why didn’t you just punch me in the face and walk out again? Why did we get breakfast, and why did you tell me my soul was beautiful or whatever that weird fucking thing was at the staircase? Why aren’t you fucking livid with me? Why don’t you hate me?”
“I’ll suck you up,” Dean goads to the disgusted groans of his adopted father and friends around the table. Benny goes as far as to chuck a french fry at his head.
When everything is gone, all the liquor and his fury and his—just Cas, he’s back in the kitchen to take whatever alcohol is left. Might as well save himself the back-and-forth trips, he thinks, feeling clever for chucking all the beers and a bottle of whiskey into a plastic bag he finds lying around.
“That’s why you love me!” comes Dean’s voice, detached from his body which has already turned the corner away from Cas’ sight.
This lasted for approximately an hour or so, up until a niggling thought started crawling around and burrowing a home inside his brain. Cas had watched as the glow emanating off of Dean took a nosedive. He had watched and he had frowned.
“Sorry, pal, I’ve got a busty blonde bartender I’ve got to attend to right now,” he says coolly. “Clocked her the moment I came in. Maybe I’ll have a better shot now that I’m riding solo. See you tonight—or whenever.”
One would be if Chuck was dancing in the background, snapping everyone away Thanos-style to the tune of Highway to Hell.
“You’re drinking a lot more. You’re not talking to Cas. You camp out in your room like that and the bathroom is the only place you’re allowed to be. What’s going on, Dean?”
“You remember our first exchange very well,” Cas murmurs, and Dean’s wondering if it’s a question or what, but then he realises Cas’ grip on his bicep has loosened, yet still touching, cradling. Every other thought sort of goes out the window.
“Nah. I don’t think so.” Dean shakes his head, pats Cas on the back reassuringly. “We’re still...in this for awhile.”
Dean’s knuckles whiten noticeably on the steering wheel. “I was trying to apologise. You’re acting really childish, y’know that?”
“If Sam and Eileen aren’t asleep when we return, we can drink some hot chocolate and watch Christmas movies. Perhaps only one tonight, but then we can wake early tomorrow and view another before Christmas breakfast. Or is it lunch?”
He pats Castiel on the back, too forcefully, again, and as he works his jaw with restrained rage, he stalks furiously towards the Impala, slip inside, and drives away with a speed that’s at least double the road limit.
“You certainly do,” Cas reproaches, nudging Dean’s knee with his. “Now what do you want for dinner?”
“You coming or not?” Dean asks once he’s eventually standing from outside the car, failing to hide his flushed complexion by looking skyward.
“I believe that’s what landed you in your current predicament,” says Cas with a hint of a smirk, “your appreciation of bendy women.”
“Hey! This morning I was the bee’s knees to you.” Dean leans his head lovingly into Cas’, smushing their cheeks together to Cas’ immediate flinch away. It hurts his feelings, but only for just a moment because Cas then stands and drops a kiss to the top of Dean’s forehead.
“Why you showerin’ at one in the afternoon?” he grouses, and though it’s directed at Cas, he’s looking down the hallway, unable to meet his eyes, or his pink-flushed cheeks, or his tousled mop of wet hair, a little too endearing and heart-wrenching and—
He must have fallen half-asleep. He blinks a few times to clear his eyes, but his vision remains blurred and he’s feeling a little dizzy too and oh—he’s still drunk. It reminds him of that time he drank the entirety of the liquor store and he giggles to himself. Back then, he drank because he couldn’t find God. Now he’s drunk and he wishes God never showed up to, as they say, ‘the party.’ There’s nothing he wishes more.
With a courage he commends himself quite smugly for, he advances closer still and skims his nose down Cas’ cheek, finally coming to kiss him soundly at the corner of his mouth.
“I have kept my mouth shut for so long because I didn’t want to out you to yourself. Charlie was very clear with me on that!”
Their lips slot together easily, forcefully, with vigour. Something pulls at Dean’s neck and like a shot he descends onto Cas. He crawls on top of him, feeling their bare chests touch and shock them both apart for a second before that same something—Cas’ hand—yanks Dean lightly by his bicep to collide their mouths together once more. His hand stays on Dean’s bicep. He squeezes it when Dean skims his tongue along Cas’ lips, who slips his tongue out to touch and entwine with Dean’s like he’s dying of thirst.
It’s about Week Two into their mutual evasion of each other when Sam, recently oblivious to any person but Eileen, notices.
Cas has crossed his arms and is looking at Dean with a indiscernible expression, which--scary--because Dean knows all of Cas’ expressions. The best he can milk out of this one is that Cas is a little mixed between impressed, horrified, and contemplative.
“People realise it at different times all the time. People accept things at different speeds,” Dean retorts. Benny must have done something with his face then because Dean groans aloud. “I wasn’t talking about
Cas is kicked into gear by the sound of Dean’s voice and he attempts—also fails—at pulling away. April responds by sucking his bottom lip into her mouth.
It doesn’t cool even when he’s under the spray of a cold shower. It’s only when he’s fully dressed that his racing pulse calms, and even then he is still overthinking the components of sex and Cas together, unused to the idea of the two concepts intertwined in a real and authentic way. It’s not as if he’s never entertained the idea as a joke or talked about it in jest many times before. It’s not even as if he’s unfamiliar these days to the idea of wanting Cas. Having it vocalised, however, was too close to manifesting something.
“Easy. Our love burned too brightly so we had to break it off for a little while. See other people. Turns out we’re not bi or gay or straight, we're just somewhere on the spectrum and it was just to each other to hence we were attracted--"
Dean breathes a sigh of relief, or maybe he just breathes for the first time since he started on his nowhere plan.
The one benefit of being a functional problematic-drinker, for Dean, is that his morning-afters mostly consist of weakness, fatigue, and thirst. Not so much memory loss.
He can envisage, at any moment, Dean Winchester chasing him out the door and chasing the memories of their intimacies away with a fifth of vodka. Knowing Dean, likely the entire bottle.
“Seems like I forgot mine,” he admits with an equally frustrated look that Dean had been sporting earlier.
They tend to a couple more rounds that morning before even his seventeen-year-old body cannot keep up, then she’s hopping up and down into her skinny jeans. She pulls her hair up into a ponytail, whipping up a coquettish peek at him.
“Dean, it seems you are fully stocked up on alcoholic beverages and condiments, but no…actual…ingredients or food.”
From his drink arriving to his burger’s demolition to forking at the dregs of his pie, Dean spends this time internally haranguing himself over his fight with Cas. He’s managed to convince himself that Cas will never talk to him again and that he’s going to die alone and that he was deluded to ever think even for a second that their friendship could turn into some big romantic gay love when his phone rings.
“Alright. Thanks, then. Friend,” Dean says, amused. “Let’s go to a diner,” he announces, “Two dudes grocery shopping together is a little gay. I don’t judge, but that shit’s not really for me.”
“No, not yet. Perhaps today will be the day though,” Cas answers with wryness. “I must admit, of all the human things I did miss, sleeping is one of them. It’s nice to be able to…forget and rest for a period of time each day.”
Cas starts unwinding her arms from around him and steps closer to his friend who immediately grasps onto his hand. Dean uses this grip as leverage to yank Cas behind him as if he’s acting as a shield between Cas and a ravenous lion.
"Dean needed a drinking partner,” utters Cas as his excuse, head bowed in shame as he shuffles upright.
“I heard that, jerk!” He calls loudly as he bumbles down the hallway, juggling his multiple sacks of goods that, Dean would like to reiterate, is ambitious for even a Winchester that size to physically transport. The kid is acting like a lovesick teenager with all this gift-giving ritual crap and it makes Dean chuckle under his breath with a degree of fondness.
“Shit,” Sam blinks, and he looks like something cleared in his brain as he sits up a bit straighter. “Shit, sorry. I didn’t mean—um. Look, man, I’m just a bit tipsy right now.” He says to Dean.
“I’m not upset,” Dean says in his most casual voice, shrugging, “but if I were to be, it might have something to do with that waitress flirting with you and you thanking her for it. I dunno. Just a thought. Bit weird to let someone flirt with you while you’re on a date.”
“Did you know that he puts socks on me while I sleep if I forget to? He also sneaks wheatgrass powder and crushed vitamins into my protein shakes to make me healthier. He thinks I don’t know.”
And even when they're fighting, Cas is there for Dean. Amongst all the vitriol, amongst all the pressure and strain, Cas always returns so quickly, from angel of the Lord with a duty to Dean's one and only friend.
According to a disgruntled Sam set against the backdrop of Maui’s sunset, Dean and Cas will be doing this until one of them dies — which, incidentally, is what Cas looks like he is wishing upon himself right now.
Warning: unhealthy coping mechanisms, i.e drinking to excess (do not try this at home...or anywhere really)
Sam scoffs. “Yeah, alright. Sleep. Everyone’s dead, the world’s ending, and my brother’s banging an angel man that’s been our best friend for eleven years. Sure. Okay.”
“We’re better together,” Dean says quietly, “remember?” He offers Cas a small smile, a peace token. His heart hammers in his chest as he hopes against hope that Cas accepts it.
His hand is looped cautiously at the crook of Dean’s elbow and he looks like he’s about to pass out— or pass back into reality from a fever dream.
Dean rolls his eyes and shuffles under the duvet, hip checks Cas and pulls more blanket towards himself. They engage in a tug of war for a few seconds until Cas, as always, relents with a huff and kicks whichever of Dean’s legs is closer to him.
Terror beating at his chest, Cas nods jerkily and goes to remove his confining jeans. He stops at the hem of his shirt and stammers, “I—I’m keeping my shirt on.”
“And Cas? You look at Cas like he hung the friggin’ moon. Don’t get me started on all the gazing you two do.”
“I think the kids these days are calling it bi or tri or pan or stove or whatever else you want to call it. I’ve seen you around girls. I don’t think you’re gay, but hey, whatever works for you, kid.”
...but I guess now this is a Part 1 Part 2 scenario because I ended up fleshing it out way more than originally planned
“Shit,” Cas shouts, and crawls over to where Dean is hissing and grasping the back of his skull in pain. “Shit, are you okay?”
"Then a few months later, oh, we've just been a bit too close all this time and that’s what messed with our heads during our simultaneous mid-life crisis. It’ll be a funny story that comes up when everyone gets a bit drunk in ten years time at a disastrous Christmas party."
“I don’t have any things to put away,” Cas says faintly, but he’s smiling. It’s timid, even feeble, but it’s close enough of an expression that makes something inside Dean twitch and glow.
Their words overlap and Cas tilts his head in question of Dean. “Isn’t the bed a little too...intimate for practice?”
“Billie’s dead. Guess we have a lot to catch up on, a lot to mourn,” Dean snorts, bleary-eyed. He’s thinks he’s blurred by tears that haven’t spilled. “The Empty is gone for now. If we can’t beat Chuck—“
“I was just joking around,” Dean says, “you look—um—fine. You look fine to me.” His eyes squeezes shut, and he curses inwardly at his choice of verbiage.
Dean paces slowly, menacingly, and very meaningfully towards his father who right now still towers over him.
“Come on, man,” Dean barrels on with an edge of frustration. “You like Meg but you’re not interested in her like that. I get it,” he nods meaningfully, “and I can’t avoid that yoga studio forever because my floppy-haired hippie brother owns the damn place and I’m his investor. If we tell them we’re together, Meg leaves you alone at our way too frequent group meet-ups and I don’t seem like a dick to Lisa and Ben, just someone that likes your dick.”
Dean casts this abashed look sideways, like he doesn’t want to believe Castiel but like Castiel sounds unassailable enough in his conviction that Dean has to at least consider the truth to it.
“I remember when I first gazed at your soul,” Cas continues, lips lifting into a fond smile. His palm drifts from Dean’s arm towards his chest and he presses down on where Dean’s heart is, firmly but gently. It was getting very weird very quickly. Dean’s never felt so nauseous and delighted. “It glows. It’s beautiful. I wish I could still see it as clearly as I did then, even through the fire and sulphur and brimstone.”
“Take things slow,” Dean echoes after a minute, scoffing but with no heat, trying to loosen the strain in the air, “where did you learn that from? You been watching those shit soaps again on TV?”
“Come on, let’s get you home.” Dean’s rubbing the side of Castiel’s shoulder that he has one arm around, ushering him out the booth. Castiel follows obediently, always going where Dean calls.
His face flushes with a heat he can’t decipher the source of, but he ignores it like he’s starting to ignore a lot of things these days. He pats Cas on the cheek twice and lingers a moment too long.
“If we can’t find paint, then I’ll just do it in blood,” Dean continues on to joke morbidly. “Always happy to bleed for Castiel, Angel of the Lord.”
The blanks in his memory is, however, what sets him into slight panic. He sits himself down on the edge of the bed and takes a deep breath, trying to collate memories and details and also trying not to heave all over the wooden floorboards.
“I think you’ve not been listening,” Cas whispers, like it’s to himself. He sighs. “If you’ll let me, we can speak tomorrow. You need to either empty your stomach of the poison you’ve consumed or at least let me take you somewhere to sleep this off.”
Charlie quiets just for a moment. “You’re just—you’re so dense sometimes, Dean. You’re going to end up hurting him and yourself, you know that?”
He lurches himself forward into a formless Cas, into the goo, begins to babble nonsensically, without plan.
"My point is I can get a yes from you on anything. I'll get it on this eventually, Cas. Let's just flip to the last page and be done with it, huh? What'd'ya say, bud?"
Shit, this is just getting worse by the second. Dean wishes he hadn’t reacted to any of this in any way shape or form, because now Cas is observing him with a mixture of curiosity and amusement.
He can’t say he’s sorry for the last time they’ve talked on the phone when he said naught more than he’d said. He can’t even say sorry for the last time their eyes met in person and Cas left without Dean asking him to not go. All these words, all the regrets, they catch in his throat, and all he can do is say that he’ll listen now. Cas had tried to talk to him, and he was fair in reminding Dean that Dean hadn’t listened. Hadn’t even looked him. Cas isn’t dead to him though, he could never be, and now, the least Dean can do at is look at him. Listen.
“Phone’s dead,” he grumbles. “You got yours on you? In case Sam or Eileen calls? I don’t want anything happening to them because I’m too stupid to charge my goddamn useless piece of shit phone, or if they’ve been attacked by a monster along the way, or something with Chuck comes up, or even if they get back a little early and we’re not there, and what if they think something’s took us, and—”
He doesn’t remember much. Only glimpses. Being cradled out the bar—a hazy memory he will replay and claw to keep fresh—the collapse into a booth, the vomiting in an alley, a perky young blonde waitress, a man that called Dean his boyfriend. Nothing too terrible, he doesn’t think.
Dean tries to smooth over his prickliness in time for when Cas appears in front of the bathroom door with his own towel in his hand.
The minutes tick by, enough time lapsing for Dean to perspire through his undershirt. His flannel hides some physical remnants of his stress but his forehead is starting to bead noticeably with sweat. Benny goes to turn the airconditioning on for Dean’s sake, and he in turn slaps his hand away and turns the radio off instead.
“Cas, you can’t be happy, not sacrificing yourself for me like this. Y’know the first thing I’m going to do after that bitch ganks you for good? I’m going to sit down in that corner over there and I’m going to ignore the world. Hell, I might even lose myself again. That can’t make you happy, man. Not like this. If you love me, you can’t hurt me like this.” He knows it’s not Cas’ fault but what he’s saying, it makes something twitch.
“I guess we both have trouble listening sometimes,” Cas remarks lightly with a smile as he shoulders past Dean towards the fridge. He’s jibing at him like they’re friends. Dean doesn’t fight the stupid grin that appears.
Could Cas possibly—could he maybe actually mean it when he said—is it all still a stupid plan gone bad—
Bobby dabs at the spilt water around Garth with some napkins, frowning, at what exactly, Dean wasn’t too sure.
He’s pretty. Like girls are, like guys can be sometimes. Dean sometimes thinks—knows—he wouldn’t care what body Cas was in, as long as it’s Cas in there. It would have just been a lot easier if he had been a girl. Something dad did give him talks about. Something he has experienced and understood.
She laughs tearfully. “I think I just wanted a family. You’re so good with Ben. You’re so good to me, and I—I overlooked a few things I shouldn’t have. You and Cas,” she tugs Cas’ hand into hers. Cas only shares with her a look of terror, which Dean supposes she misinterprets because then she says, “you two shouldn’t have to hide anymore.”
“Like any of those hats would fit on your big, fat head, Sammy,” Dean jokes and Cas snorts, then covers his mouth with widened eyes.
“You know, we should just get married for a laugh. Like at Sam’s bachelor party, I mean. It’ll be hilarious. He’d lose his shit and that would really be a night to remember. Everyone else is married. You and I…should…um…just—”
Castiel almost doesn’t hear him. He also doesn’t understand what led to what Dean said. Had Castiel been saying something before? Everything is a little hazy and darkened and whirling right now.
“Fine, fine,” Dean waves a hand dismissively but places it on Cas’ neck afterwards. He rubs circles there, thrilled he’s able to just do this now. “I love you.”
He gauges this mostly from soaps and telenovelas that he and Dean watch together in Bobby’s basement, once everyone is sound asleep and could never stumble upon them gorging on their collective guilty pleasure. He still doesn’t really understand why he should feel guilty about enjoying what he enjoys. All Cas knows is his friendship with Dean may be at risk were he to refuse shards of what Dean labels masculinity.
Dean gasps in half a breath of unhinged laughter. “I think I’m fine, but I’m only, like, sixty-two percent sure. A lot—a lot’s happened. I’m not even sure this isn’t all a fever dream.”
“Stop craning your neck. He said he’d be awhile. Why don’t you just sit here and talk to your old friend?” prods Benny. Though he can’t see him, Cas imagines him in detective-mode, taking a measured and thoughtful drink of his beer. “Why
Until now. An open Gas-n-Sip. Dean chortles. “Un-friggin’-believable,” he says as he clenches on the brakes and moves Baby towards a very empty parking space.
Cas’ head is slumped on Dean’s shoulder and he’s smacking his lips together like he wants to say something, then gives up along with his eyes as soon as they fall shut.
Both brothers snap up to attention to find Jack standing by Cas’ side, looking more together than the rest of them combined.
Dean exhales his held breath, reassured and calmed within a moment. He closes his eyes for a brief second and relishes in the relief.
He reaches forwards for the milkshake, and without saying anything, takes Cas’ straw into his mouth and sucks. It’s okay. He prefers pie.
Well, fuck it, Dean’s not just going to keep silent and brood like every goddamn time he felt something in his life. The world is falling apart, again, and they need each other.
“You’re my ride,” Benny says slowly like he’s explaining basic multiplication to a eight-year-old. “I just went to the bathroom for a second. Were you just going to leave without me?”
Dean chuckles. “It’s a bit late for that now, don’t you think? Hell, I’m surprised Sam and Eileen have kept their word and not babbled to anyone yet.”
They sit in a tense silence. Sam stares blankly out the frosted window from the backseat, resolutely ignoring them.
Cas breaks into a laugh with his entire body, teeth gleaming in the glow of sunlight that filters through Dean’s curtains. “Well, that came out of nowhere. I can’t believe you remember.”
She’s still clasping onto Cas’ neck, but she’s moved far enough away that Cas can share a look of horror with Dean.
“Thank you for helping with breakfast. Are you still making dinner tonight?” Cas asks jovially, flipping his expression to unbothered in a motion that’s as quick as wink. It makes Dean wonder what else he is concealing, considering the expert transition at play here.
“I know,” Cas repeats quietly. “I shouldn’t have...jumped to conclusions. I was feeling a little sensitive from—well...you know.”
“Because I’m in love with you,” Cas says straightforwardly, calm and cool like they’re discussing nothing more rousing than the weather.
There’s something he knows is quivering below the surface, all wrapped up in telling Cas that Cas is the thing that goes wrong, telling Cas to answer his goddamn messages and nothing else, him letting Cas leave, them not talking about it, him asking Cas about Sam but not Cas himself, Sammy, his baby brother, who he’s supposed to look after and he’s failing spectacularly at that again, God being back in the game again, losing mom again, Jack, Charlie, Kevin, Bobby, Jo, Ellen, every goddamn person he couldn’t protect, and now the world is coming to an end again—and—and fuck. They’re going to go eat pancakes and bacon.
“I know who I am,” Dean insists, stepping forward, crowding Cas into the wall. “I might stumble sometimes, for a little bit, while I’m finding my footing on this, but I,” he reaches out to whisk a hand down Cas’ bicep, stroking. “I know what I want.”
"Um—so I heard some yelling. Are you okay?" Sam’s eyebrows fly up his head when Dean scowls at him. “What’s wrong with your face? You guys just have your first lover’s tiff or what?”
He copies Dean’s charming half-turned grin, inviting and salacious. “Do you want to get out of here?”
They’re standing far too close, and when Cas’ hand jerks away from him as well as his backtracking steps, away, further away, Dean wishes he’d kept his mouth shut.
“It’s not you, it’s me?” Cas asks, amused, lifting away to cock his head at Dean. “Have you been watching more of your shitty soaps on that TV, Dean?”
“Hey, Dean,” Eileen says, head cocked, smirking at him. She doesn’t say the next bit, but she signs it.
“Meh,” Dean shrugs. One hand remains on the steering wheel while the other blindly reaches for Cas’. It’s met instantly and Dean laces their fingers together.
Cas observes him with a soft smile and amusement gleaming in his eyes, rather than the mock-scorn Dean had been expecting.
“I need to get over it,” Cas echoes. Dean can’t read his now schooled expression and tone. It terrifies him slightly.
“Hey, hey,” an unfamiliar voice nudges through Castiel’s sleepy brain. There’s also a hand shaking his shoulder as he fumbles his way back into a fuller consciousness.
happy for my baby brother settling down with this kickass girl, but when I think about myself for a second—”
“Love you?” Benny’s voice peals through his mortified reverie. “What’s up with that? Is that how you two end phone calls now?”
Dean scoffs, because Cas’ track list of past lovers looks more like an assembly of deranged to terrifically disturbed, rather than
The boy is late, which is not as surprising as his attendance, considering Castiel has never actually seen him in class.
Then one cruel sunbeam of light streams through a partial gap between Cas’ curtains, striking straight into Dean’s right eye.
Instead, they pick pinecones that are assorted in size, unique to each one of them. Sam, with childish jeers from others, ends up with the smallest one.
“Why now?” Sam asks quietly, but it’s so piercing that it interrupts Dean like a sharp needle has been run through his skin.
“Yeah, yeah, he’s slumped over in a booth, but the barmaid’s giving him lots of water. Wait, you are Dean, right? He’s been talking about you all night, I just assumed—and your number is listed on his favourite contacts—I—I’m sorry if you’re not—is there someone else I can call or…?”
Cas’ brandishes his trembling but thick and reassuring fingers to lace through Dean’s. He shakes it at Lisa and smiles like an asylum patient off their meds.
It goes on like this for the next hour, with Dean and Cas wedged next to each other on a too-small couch, shifting on their bottoms awkwardly as Sam bumbles around the room, cleaning up Jenga pieces they’ve abandoned on the floor, burning their popcorn twice, and setting up a movie Dean supposes they’re all going to watch together now.
Cas’ skills in eavesdropping has honed over the years. He almost wails aloud to himself out of irritation, because now his brain won’t let him move. Instead, he listens.
He reaches out instinctively to touch Dean. It used to be easy like this. He wouldn’t have to think so much if all he wanted to do was to reach out and comfort his friend with touch. He does it now, and maybe they’ve travelled back in time a couple years when Dean trusted him and cared for him and thought of him as a friend, because Dean lets him hold his arm. He doesn’t tense or move away.
Cas collapses onto the floor, heaving big breaths and glaring half-heartedly at Dean who is laughing with joy through his tears.
“I thought, maybe—we—I never—“ Dean inhales sharply and holds his breath for the few second that it takes for him to gather his thoughts.
“I really...I really love you,” Dean confesses as tenderly as he can, his heart racing. “I love you too, I mean.”
“You’re thirty-two years old. You should know not to pick food up straight from the pan.” Cas scowls, taking Dean’s fingers into his hands and inspecting them with care. “Of course it’s going to be hot.”
As soon as they’re in her bedroom, she starts clawing at Cas’ neck, bringing him down in a smothering kiss that he acquiesces to mostly out of confusion.
“Fantastic,” Dean cries sarcastically, which the girl mistakenly takes as affirmation. She slides over a keycard while Cas pays, and not too long after they’re lugging one rucksack and a somnolent Sam onto the nearest bed. He instantly splays face-down across the entire mattress like a starfish and shrieks his protest when Dean toes at him to move over.
Dean glowers at him, feeling called out. He’s finally willing to recognise some truth in these aspersions, but that doesn’t mean he appreciates it being vocalised and shared to all public ears.
“Maybe cook something for me sometime then, eh? Stick around and make me some of that...weird french pancake thing I smell every morning.”
“The guy you’ve been rambling on about all night? His freckles, his eyes, his soul?” The man before him is teasing him now, he can tell. Even drunk and still not entirely top of his class in ‘people skills’, he doesn’t miss the amused look the man shares with the waitress next to him.
It’s two a.m when his phone rings, Cas’ caller ID lighting up the screen. Dean fumbles out of bed and smacks onto the floor in his hurried bid to get to the phone.
“I told her there’s nobody else I want to share my life with but you,” Cas continues faintly, “I told her that I’m in love with you.”
“I wouldn’t do that,” Dean insists, eyes fluttering, sticking from the dampness of faint tears. “You really think I would do that? Fuck, have I really been that awful to you?” He presses one hand to Cas’ chest and grips his shirt into a fist.
“We make a great pair,” he remarks sarcastically. Nonetheless, there it is again. A sliver of hope that sneaks through his chest, when Dean touches him, when Dean gazes at him, or says something like this—even slightly interpretable as…well. That they could be something more.
“Dean is here,” he hears himself mutter stupidly, then shakes his head, because Dean couldn’t be here. Why is Dean here?
Castiel’s eyes widen a fraction but he swiftly collects himself. “Winchester?” he asks weakly, regretting it as soon as he says it. He should have ignored that, not think too much of it.
When Dean touches him, embraces him, cuddles into him, places a kiss by his temple or one on his jaw, he no longer quivers with want and desire. It’s with a bored roll of the eyes and a flirtatious
“I didn’t realise we were doing this so much more thoroughly now,” Cas says breathily when Dean pulls back, his hitch of breath hitching Dean’s. “Aren’t we—isn’t this a little too far for pretend or practice or—what is this, Dean?”
“We didn’t even get paint,” Dean scowls, “we got stupid fucking chalks. They rub off in, like, a few seconds.”
The uncomplicated normality they’ve slipped back into has Dean grinning with delight. Cas purses his lips against his own smile when Dean places a hand at his waist, leading them to a booth. His gut takes a nosedive in a good and exciting way, like when you’re on a rollercoaster and you can’t wait for the next drop.
Dean without hesitation drops his internal war and angles his head towards Cas. His reddened eyes, creased with anger and hate, now softens. His lips tremble. He bows his head.
The last two months of my life is titled the never-ending saga of ‘oh shit’, from friend drama to quitting my job to starting a new one to legit being in hospital for a week, but I'm so ready and excited to get back to writing fic again 😄
“I guess you want to call this off, then,” he mumbles without looking at Cas either. His stranglehold on the wheel clenches.
“Good. Awesome. Okay. I’m just going to—” he points in the opposite direction of where he’s meaning to go. “Going now. Bye.”
Cas huffs but then graces Dean with a small, shy smile once he’s spent twenty seconds pretending to be mildly annoyed. It rushes him with such a surge of affection that he can’t help but reach forwards to brush Cas’ dirty cheek with his own dirty thumb.
“Cas,” he says again, taking a step forward, “we’d like you to stay. I’d like you to stay,” and with some strength that he’s not mustered up in awhile, he adds, “please.” It feels like he’s leapt off a cliff.
He can see through the barrier and know with the same certainty he’s known all his life about his attraction to women, that he loves Cas and wants to kiss him. It feels okay now, so he smiles with the most relief he’s felt in a long time and drifts his face towards Cas.
“Hmm,” Cas hums, lifting his head away from the cold shelves of the fridge with a curious expression. “Do you often have a beer paired with ketchup for breakfast? I don’t think that sounds incredibly appetising,” he teases.
He takes the seat next to Castiel, the only seat left unoccupied due to a severe lack of friends on Castiel’s behalf and the boy’s tardiness.
“I can afford a motel room somewhere outside town for a couple of days,” Cas ventures once they’re settled inside the Impala with the heat running. “We’re lucky the gas tank is full though. Is your hand okay? It looks sore—”
His curiosities over his attraction to Cas have been satisfied and all that’s left now consists of pure want. Their flirtatious quips are no longer just that. Their casual and familiar touches have mutated into fire alighting his flesh. For Dean, all things Cas-related is now headed by an insurmountable longing.
“What, you really not going to comment on that whole—what’s a word you’d use...debacle?” Dean asks, mildly and sadly beguiled.
“Why? Isn’t that what we’re doing? Treating each other’s partner’s like they aren’t even family?” Dean demands, belligerent.
Cas flits a glance sideways at Dean. “You know...Thoreau once wrote that it’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see. I’m sure that Sam doesn’t look at this picture of us and see anything beyond what’s here—which is...just us, being us. A slightly different snapshot of our life is happening before his eyes, that’s true, but we are still happening too, as us, and if I’m being honest, Dean, I don’t really feel like we’ve been acting any differently around Sam and Eileen as we have before, which is to say when we were...not...a fake couple...I mean—bar a few kisses here and there—” Cas stops abruptly and purses his lips in what looks like an effort to silence himself.
Dean’s heart kicks into gear and runs at the speed it would if he were to be perched over a cliff edge. He opens his mouth in a panic to amend it with no luck in more useful words tumbling out.
“Because he’s drunk, Dean, and that’s not even what he said. Of course I’m not talking to him. I’m not…talking to anyone but you. In that way.” Cas sighs, unwinds from Dean who misses the contact instantly but also starts to feel cold and resentful.
Cas’ pulse elevates. He breathes deep to prevent an oncoming adrenaline attack, because no, it can’t be, his wildest dreams, the wants he’s tempered down all this time—
It’s scarier than any demon he’s ever met, how quickly Dean’s behaviour can turn from something so giving and kind and playful and wondrously childlike to this blackened ugly thing.
Dean sniggers, rubbing the hilt of his palm to his eyes to eradicate sleep. “I thought that once the sun is up, you’re up.”
“I think they think that the more time they spend with us as a couple, the easier it will be for them to wrap their head around it.” He pauses to yawn loudly. It sets off a sleepy, snuffling noise from Cas that tightens Dean’s chest with fondness. “I think Sam’s also doing the whole atonement routine where he needs to make up for not catching on earlier to the fact that I—that I’m—” Dean stops and chokes on the term, having never fully considered the validity of it until now.
“Wait, hang on a second,” Sam halts them with a hand that breaks them apart, making Dean whimper a little at the loss of Cas’ comforting touch. “You’re breaking up with her, aren’t you? At her place of work? Couldn’t you have just gone over to her apartment or ask her to yours? Dean, goddammit, I
There’s so much more intimacy for him and Cas to come, and the thought enthuses Dean so much that it bleeds into their kiss. The shy brush, tug, press, and pull of lips, turns into tongues sweeping into mouths and moans that escalate into Dean somehow falling into Cas’ lap.
“Then what?” Cas squints at Dean, and Dean grins, because it seems like Cas is finally, subtly, being kindled with interest—dubious though it still may be.
“You talked to Lisa?” Dean asks gently, regretting his birth and everything that followed because now he’s starting to realise why Lisa leaving the studio—compounded with how he apparently ruined his brother’s wedding and it’s still an issue for Sam—is worthy of getting drunk over. Hell, he’d brought Cas here to get drunk. He supposes it must run in the family, stemming back to dad’s old whiskey days.
Dean is not so much glaring at him, but he looks detached, angry, and sour. He tosses a jumper at Castiel with far more force than necessary, and it’s balled up, so it hits him square in the chest with some oomph.
“Are you jealous?” Cas pokes at the issue outrightly. Do Not Speak Aloud, he knows it’s one of those thoughts, and yet Dean is throwing a brimming basket of hope in his face.
“I wouldn’t phrase it so crudely,” Cas sniffs, “but essentially, yes, I suppose. I’m becoming human now. I may as well join in with your mating rituals.”
“I thought...” Cas begins, his expression transforming again into something slightly forlorn, “I thought you’d have a problem with my vessel. I’d always thought maybe, just maybe, if I had ended up occupying a female body, that you would—“
He claps Cas on the back as he passes him. His hand lingers for a second too long, relishing, but he doesn’t think too much about it. The same way he doesn’t think too much about how things are feeling okay again and it’s only going to blow up in his face soon.
“Always gripping me tight and raising me from perdition,” Dean mutters, half-amused, half-irritated, as he’s steadily lifted to his feet.
Come to think of it, she’s not even frowning anymore. She’s smiling at them carefully, not happy but not necessarily upset either.
Anyway, here’s some fluff! I hope it helps anyone looking to lighten their heartbreak over the ending ❤️
“Are you naked under there?” Dean continues in his hysterical voice, rushing to move the blanket from Cas’ lap.
“I don’t think I’ve ever heard you say the word shitty so much in my life, Cas,” Dean says with a wry smirk to himself.
“Sam did briefly think we were a couple when he was younger,” Cas cuts in nonchalantly, rescuing Dean from his verbal traffic. “You shut it down rather quickly. It likely stopped him from ever considering the possibility of you and I together romantically. It isn’t his fault that it became a non-subject over the years…and also, you aren’t actually—um—”
The pang of Charlie hits again, and it’s a little worse when he’s a bit drunk, so he struggles to hide the frown that crawls onto his face.
Today has begun so normally and domestically that Dean is starting to grow in anxiety, waiting for the other shoe—or bomb—to drop.
Cas pales. Dean, again, feels disgusted with himself. He has to cover his face with his hands, press down on his eyeballs so they don’t water.
It’s also entirely different because Cas’ jaw is strong in his hands, and his nose, larger than most girls’, pokes into Dean’s cheek more significantly, letting him know that he’s definitely there. There’s a fine scratch of stubble too, surprisingly pleasurable.
“I wanted my memory foam back. Your mattress is shit, it doesn’t even care enough about you to remember you,” Dean says blithely, circling an arm around Cas to pick up the bacon sizzling away on the pan.
“So,” Dean starts, when it’s obvious no one else is going to risk saying something because they may burst out laughing. “We gonna talk about this or what?”
“It’s not like I went into that relationship with the intention of being buddy-buddy with her kid,” Dean mutters defensively, “but he was cool, and he thought I was really cool.”
They move together gently for a few seconds before Cas pulls away and smacks Dean on his arm, the same place he left his bloody handprint.
Cas has his hands clasped on the table, waiting for Dean patiently. Always fucking waiting in the wings for Dean.
He’s too exhausted to fabricate apathy at this point. If he’s not going crazy, the softness is Cas’ face, millimetres from his, makes it look like he’s feeling something here too.
“That guy sucked. I’m glad he’s working on Christmas Eve. What an asshole. Do you think he was so shitty because it was obvious we were a couple? Probably a homophobe.”
His breath tickles Dean’s jaw while his body balances lopsidedly above. It makes Dean squirm with giddiness, an interesting sensation that exhilarates his nerves. He hasn’t felt this boyish and unsettled since he was—well—a boy.
“Jesus christ,” Benny mutters. “Cas, go. Dean, sit your ass back down. He’s a grown man. You don’t need to follow him into the toilet like a little duckling just to make sure he comes back in one piece.”
He kicks him gently on his shin. “I’m making you ratatouille. A salad isn’t going to sustain you but you still need to eat some vegetables.”
“I think she’s got it, Cas,” Dean finds himself interrupting testily, “can I talk to you privately for a fucking second? Please?”
“And you, you dull, indolent, plodding pile of goop, you want peace and quiet, I know that. I swear to you I will make your existence louder than the goddamn Big Bang once you take him. I’m trying to kill God right now. I think I‘m stupid and angry and stubborn enough to find a way to burst your eardrums,” Dean’s arrogant smirk wobbles through his tears, “He brought you to Billie. You have your vengeance. Kinda. Just—enough now. Please.”
Before he lets himself fall into a fast and effortless slumber, Dean pleads with himself to remember. To please let himself be brave enough to talk to Cas tomorrow.
“It’s bullshit! Eileen’s name was on one? Really? I’ve never seen her name spelt out like that in my entire life! I’ve also never met another Dean, by the way!” Dean yells, though he’s starting to deflate in his ire.
“Um—” Dean swallows, drawing Cas’ attention to the veins on his throat that protrudes with strain. “Sorry. I just—I meant p-practice. For—”
The comment serves its purpose. Cas’ steps falter and he spins around to give Dean the dirtiest glare Dean’s ever seen on him, so incensed and shaken. It’s something. He’s at least not leaving.
“Of course,” Cas answers, nodding and Dean can see his eyes are bloodshot, “I am always devoted to you.”
John plops himself on the bed beside them next to a soundly asleep Sam, and Cas is so attuned to Dean that he knows his jaw is clenched right now with barely contained rage.
Dean’s brain short-circuits. He’s drunk. He’s heard wrong. It must be. His heart jumps and his mouth runs dry and he’s shaking his head like it’s possible to shake something in his mind loose.
plan in the entire world!” he roars and reaches across the space between himself and Dean to give him a hard shove. “You are fucking insane!”
That kiss. The one they shared, somehow, in its delicacy and quiet and chasteness was far more intimate than a drunken mostly-blacked-out smooch for laughs.
They’re still hugging so it’s a little awkward when Cas replies, mumbling against his shoulder, “yes?”
Dean doesn’t reply. Castiel may be wrong, but a comment like that, he believes, requires at least some kind of response.
“So it’s a woman then?” Dean tries to goad him into spilling. Dean doesn’t know why he cares. It hurts both ways, but if it’s a guy, for an unfathomable reason to him, it aches more.
“You know, you didn’t really say much back there,” Dean remarks, falling into step with Bobby as he heads towards his truck.
He gives a contented sigh and closes his eyes before answering, “I had read about something called liquid courage. I believed it would have—helped me be…courageous. In pursuing a partner. It seems all it gave me courage to do is maunder nonsensical musings to innocent—” another hiccup. He hates the involuntary myoclonic jerks that humans suffer. “bystanders,” he finishes.
“Heya Jack,” Dean greets too loudly with an overconfidence he really doesn’t feel and plasters on his widest grin. “How you—what’s—what’s hangin’, lil dude?”
He’s also probably a little bit on the spectrum because after their kiss, Dean’s not been able to stop thinking about how gorgeous Cas is.
“I have never spoken about anyone or anything the way I spoke about you, to you, and after all that, you doubt the nature of my affections for you.”
remember if you have. It smells nice too. He uses this really great responsibly-sourced shampoo that don’t test on animals and stuff, ‘cause you know, he’s all about just…just being the greatest fucking guy. He cares about everything so damn much.”
With immense willpower he untangles himself from Cas, swears again when he notices the unmissable bulge in both their trousers, and ungainly manoeuvres himself onto a nearby chair.
Cas points at Dean maniacally, totally unhinged and out of character with himself. “See! You care what people think too!”
He had done his best, despite being off the line with a crack in his chassis, to blindly follow his elders’ orders and pursue what had been stapled into his understanding as ‘the norm.’
Her smile drops as she looks between them, but only for a second, and she asks if they want two straws with that milkshake.
“And you did it all for me,” Dean murmurs, smiling again. Cas can make him smile so easily when Dean lets it happen.
“Hey, did Cas teach you that?” Dean momentarily halts his attack on Cas to lean forwards across their booth, sloppy as can be. “’Cause he calls me that word all the time.”
He can’t say it directly again, not yet. He’s not even said as much to Sammy or mom in years, his father at all, but Cas knows now, and maybe he can say it again soon.
When he looks at Dean’s slumbering face, all worry lines smoothened, lips parted, expression peaceful, Cas knows for certain now what he’s been feeling for the past four years. It’s something that will live inside him for the rest of his life.
“You’re just as clever if not more so, Dean,” Cas argues grumpily, rolling to their bed’s edge and collecting the clothes he’d folded for himself off the floor. “Knowledge regurgitation isn’t the sole indicator of intelligence by any means. There are emotional components—”
Cas face heats up into a pale pink blush, and while it’s rare to see Cas blush, it’s rarer for Dean to notice that he thinks it’s pretty. He needs beer immediately, followed by shots.
“Dean Winchester can talk me into everything, but can’t string together one damn sentence when he’s confronted with feelings,” Cas interrupts, feeling entirely nasty the second he ends his words.
Cas nods at him and gives him a reassuring kick back at his shoe, smiling that fucking smile again. “Yes, Dean.”
“I’m sorry again, for, you know...” he mumbles, blinking away at tears, “being a dick. All the shitty things I said to you. How I lash out when I feel...not...wanted. I’m just shitty at feelings. It’s not you. You know that, right?”
Cas has to hold a hand up to his mouth to stifle a laugh when they confront a bored girl at the check-in desk whose first words to them are, “two queens?” and Dean splutters.
“Well,” Castiel huffs, “I think it may have been easier to get through to you if I were to participate in your favourite vernaculars.”
“So you don't own any then. You can borrow mine,” Cas offers diplomatically, cracking some eggs onto another pan as Dean tends to the bacon.
Last night was good, Castiel. If you’d like some more help getting over that ex of yours, give me a call and we can grab some ‘hot caffeinated beverages’ that you so enjoy.
The door slams closed again as Dean and Cas pause to goggle at each other. They also scramble away from one another at record speed, so rapidly that Cas falls off the bed.
“I know, I get that.” Dean, palms up in retreat, nods and squints at it with false understanding, “but I’ll make you a better one. You let him go and I’ll make sure you get your sleep. Your deal with Billie, that’s—what? Kaput now, isn’t it? But me, I can make that happen. I’m gonna get Chuck, I’m gonna get Amara, I’ll find a way to get you back to sleep and if I can’t—“ Dean swallows thickly—“well, you’ll be awake to come back for both of us.”
They sit like that for a little while, Castiel with one hand on Dean’s arm, like that day at the staircase, and at some point, his hand slides down to rest on top of Dean’s hand.
“It is…” Castiel peers at the grandfather clock installed towards the room’s corner. “Almost seven in the evening.”
“Why are you here?” Castiel repeats with wonder. “Why are you being nice to me? You’re not usually…nice to me.”
“Not as big of an idiot as you,” Cas says fondly, brushing aside whatever litter lain by the spot next to Dean so he can occupy its place. “Are you alright?”
“Sometimes I forget what an asshole you can be,” Sam mutters, looking away and training his eyes on the TV. “He’s been living like a human for ten-something years now. He’s even been human. He knows what love means, Dean. He’s told us he loved us before.”
His touch can now linger on Cas for as long as he wants, far longer than he would have allowed himself outside of their ruse. His eyes no longer shift away sheepishly when he gets caught staring for too long in front of other people nor does he need to simmer his warm looks at Cas when they become too heated. Their shoulders can stay pressed, their hands can stay held, their feet can stay poking into each other, and it’s no longer an eccentricity for them to be the way they are.
Dean’s up in an instant, his breakfast forgotten, and he’s rifling through the cabinets, cans and bottles and jars clinking together as he shoves unwanted items aside. “Chicken and Mushroom any good? Or we have—what is this—plain tomato? Fucking Sam, I bet.” Dean makes an offended face at the latter option which he holds in his right hand, though he brings both over and sets them in front of Castiel to choose.
“Okay. You don’t ever have to do or say anything you don’t want to. At least not with me, anyway.” Castiel shrugs.
Benny shakes his head vigorously. Does-Not-Compute has evolved rapidly into No-Fucking-Way. “No, no, no. What do you mean?”
“That’s—that was what it was...right? You didn’t mean—I mean it didn’t sound like—were you just saying goodbye and it wasn’t...that kind of love? More like a profound bond brotherly kind of...thing?” He stammers, sweat beading faster than when Death was literally at their doorstep.
Another groan falls from his parched mouth when he swings his feet to the floor and stands. He palms the wall for support as he putters towards the bathroom, grabbing the towel folded at the foot of his bed along the way.
“I guess you were just talking bullshit. Last night was all bullshit. Stupid of me, really, taking anything you said last night seriously,” Dean snarls.
The night ends with Eileen entering to let them know she’s found a standard salt-and-burn case, twenty miles south. It’s a nice night for a drive. Is Dean ready to hunt again?
enjoyed as much as Cas did if biology were anything to go by—he’s felt a flash of hope so luminous that it eclipses all the flickers he’s felt in the past.
A round of cutlery clanks around the table. Garth knocks over his glass of water. Suddenly all eyes are pointed at him like they’re waiting for the punchline.
Dean shrugs, looks at his feet. He only just realised there’s socks on them. Cas must have put them on him at some point in the night again, half-asleep as he normally does when Dean’s cold feet pokes him.
“Don’t be so crude,” Benny repeats with a pensive hum. “Isn’t that Cas’ catchphrase? You’re sharing sound bites now, along with everything else?”
In lieu of legal fees and ‘damages’ for their interrupted honeymoon, eight years later, Dean is still paying for Sam’s first drink at every one of their gatherings while Cas is responsible for Eileen’s.
“Are you okay for us to leave you with your boyfriend now?” The pretty blonde waitress asks. She looks like Dean’s type. Cas grumbles his assent to her and waves both her and the other man away. Then that word clocks at him again.
Dean shrugs and finds his spot next to Cas, far closer than acceptable for two buds. He’s too mentally exhausted to care at this point. “I’d rather sit next to you and do nothing than spend time with other people, doing stuff.”
He runs a hand through his hair that badly needs a cut, rubs a hand over his mouth, and looks away. Classic nervous Sam gesture.
Dean feels that fire, the one that’s been simmering in him since the Empty dared tried to take one of the few good things in his life, since he almost lost Cas, since he’s lost everyone else, maybe even Jack and his little brother soon. That fire, it erupts.
Cas patiently sets down ‘A World Without Bees, The Mysterious Decline of The Honeybee & What It Means For Us’ and appraises Dean with an amused look. He gestures with one sweeping hand for Dean to continue. His smile is faint, but Dean has catalogued the collection of Castiel Novak Smiles so thoroughly over the past two-something decades that he knows this one as at-least-a-little-beguiled.
“Even I think this is sickening,” Cas says wryly, “and we aren’t going to find paint,” he adds, frowning out the window.
“Me? What’s wrong with me?” His voice raises and he’s shaking his head in frustration. “He’s the one who dropped this—this unnecessary bomb on top of everything else we have to deal with right now. He’s the one that fucked up our friendship. He’s an angel, Sam. He probably doesn’t even know what it means.”
“Yeah, I—I think so. We’re in a bit too deep now,” Dean laughs humourlessly. “We’ll end it in a couple of weeks. Is that...is that okay with you?”
“He was already drunk when he called me to drive you both to the nearest bar. I can’t say I’m shocked that his plans are, once again, unplanned,” comments Benny.
“You’re sweating,” Sam says with furrowed brows and concern, “and—and staring at Cas like—” His words drop off sharply.
They’ve been sitting like that for a couple of hours and would have likely continued doing so had John Winchester not flown through the motel room, stumbling and shouting at a group of his drinking friends with half his body hanging out the doorway. He shouts a few strings of obscenities before kicking the door shut and snapping his attention to the two boys perched closely together on a loveseat.
“What are we laughing at?” Cas asks pleasantly, popping out of nowhere yet again. It amazes Dean how he can still do that the human ways, without his wings and disapparating mojo. God, he had listened in on to too much of Sam and Charlie’s Harry Potter references.
They hold hands on their way back to the car. Dean’s so grumpy that he doesn’t notice until he has to unleash Cas in search of his car keys.
“Didn’t I just say don’t be stupid?” Bobby mutters, smacking Dean affectionately on the arm. “You really think you gettin’ with Cas would ever be a problem for me or anyone else who loves you? Has that been what’s stopping you all this time?”
“What? You scared of sharing a bed with another guy? A minute ago you were fucking about with the idea of us being boyfriends,” Dean snickers.
When Dean pulls off the duvet, Cas’ hand tightens on his bare bicep and a shiver runs through his spine. He’s got to remember to change the thermostat tomorrow too when he doesn’t feel mentally and physically shattered.
“You!” Dean flaps a hand in Cas’ face, making him spring backwards and stagger. “You’re all devil-may-care about this entire fuck-up!”
A muffled cry of protest emerges from where he assumes Cas is, and then he knows it’s where Cas is because first he sees his chin, and then his cheeks, and then his eyes.
I hope that was okay! I can't wait to write more (it's like fandom therapy for me) and I really thank everyone for their kudoses and comments and reading :)
This one is a little shorter as we will definitely conclude at four, with the last chapter being mostly an epilogue of sorts, where I can tie up some loose ends and give you some fluff to soothe the angst.
Cas smiles like he’s drunk now. Dean understands. His brain feels soapy and mushy, caught in the haziest fog of roses and fantasies come true.
“Dean? Where are we going to go? I don’t want to go back there if he’s just going to come back like that again in a couple of weeks.”
Sam worries his lip with uncertainty, but because he’s eleven and his big brother is always right, he eventually relents with a careful and quiet, “alright.”
“Well—then—” Dean flounders, “none of us should have one with our name on it! We shouldn’t be leaving Cas out like this—or—” he glares at Sam again for good measure, “when you were getting them, why didn’t you just special order one with his name on it? They do shit like that now. Internet—and shit.”
Dean nods quickly, jerking his chin up and down with vigour. “Yeah. Wanna talk. Always wanna talk with you, Cas. Sleep, then talk.”
It’s like a cavity that’s been rotting away inside of him falls out along with that one apology. Vanished away with some glorious kind of spellwork. Three words, and poof.
Cas whirls his head at Dean as the car rolls to a halt in front of April’s house. “And why have you started calling me that? People are going to get the wrong idea and it—”
Cas’ composure crumbles instantly, and the look he gives Dean is the same one as the last time Dean had said that same fucking thing, but tenfold. This time, everything hurts more. Dean didn’t think that would be possible.
Dean has loosened Cas’ system of being to the point that he often forgets to limit himself and his whims. Most days, he doesn’t try to fit in at all.
“There’s a bar a couple miles outside town that I believe you and Sam have frequented. I’m getting an Uber,” Cas says, sounding a little proud of himself. It’s sweet, but Dean feels so huffy that he has no chance to enjoy Cas’ glee in doing human things.
“I just thought the bed’s comfier. Don’t wanna be making out in the bathroom either, doesn’t that violate some kind of hygienic rule?” he proposes carefully.
Thank you to all my readers, all the commenters, and everyone that's left a kudos or has given this story a chance! I really enjoyed writing it and am a little sad it's over.
Cas looks unimpressed and Dean tries not to look too eager. “It doesn’t matter either way because I won, so I think we should do it.”
He remembers and, shit, what an assault the recollections had been to his fragile grip on heterosexuality. He swears at least a dozen different profanities, carping to himself like a crazy person, in his hungover stroll towards the kitchen.
Eileen sobers up somewhat, straightening and leaning towards Sam, shushing something loving and calming into his ear which makes him sigh loudly. “Fine,” he says, “sorry, everyone. I’m being—” he grins goofily, “Silly ‘cause I’m annoyed I lost my best teacher today. Lisa asked for time off—because—well, you know why.”
It’s been chipping away for many, many, many years. It’s been crumbling quicker since last night, and tumbling to almost nothing this morning.
Castiel takes a seat besides Dean at the breakfast bar where Dean once slid him over a beer even though Castiel had refused one. He notes that Dean has a mug of coffee in front him, paired with an overflowing bowl of cereal. No beer with breakfast today.
“I don’t need to hear about you two bumping’ uglies.” Bobby waves a hand dismissively at Dean as he hops into his ride. “I’ll see you both for dinner some time next week, unless you decide to get hitched for real and forget to invite me again.”
sounds the room as Sam collapses his head onto the bar in front of him, with Eileen rubbing his back. Dean thanks the God he doesn’t believe in for Eileen Leahy-Winchester every damn day.
Cas looks flabbergasted. He opens his mouth, tilts his head, then shakes it. “I meant every word I said, Dean,” he murmurs softly, and he sounds like Cas again, the open-hearted, puppy-eyed, earnest man he had grown to be. “You are the bravest, exquisite, most stubbornly good man in the entire cosmos, but fuck, for such a clever person you can be so stupid at times.”
He scowls at it before pettily swiping his hand across the pile, so that it lands haphazardly on the floor. He kicks it for good measure.
It’s a little embarrassing how excited the idea of a back-to-basics practice is getting him. He hopes it doesn’t show too much in his tone.
Cas is still locked away in his room, probably back to avoiding Dean. Oh, well. The few hours this morning, cruised through the river of their denial, it was a good run. He supposes now they’re back to the avoidances, and tension, and uncomfortable chats that will occur when they accidentally run into each other in the hallway.
“At least make sure that you drink all the water that’s in your water bottle today so you don’t become dehydrated.”
Dean swivels his head back towards the door he’s come through and his heart skips stupidly when he catches Cas’ eyes. He’s not looked into them for far too long.
“What? I think it’s cute. Alright, that did sound a bit sarcastic but I mean it. I really think you two—”
“Well, now, our little moose is all grown up—and—” Dean pauses to burp resoundingly, “and maybe it takes him longer to get ready with all that hair grown out—I dunno. This was a very last minute dot com kinda thing.” Dean pauses again to titter. “Shit, I don’t actually remember if I invited him.”
“Okay. Let’s go deal with this then,” Cas replies more firmly, already pulling on a shirt and joggers. “Get dressed, Dean. I’m sure Sam is already hugging his knees in a corner somewhere, rocking back and forth. We don’t want to traumatise him further.”
Awkwardness leaks into the room as soon as those words are released. Cas shifts his eyes to Dean, who shifts his eyes away, and now they’re both shuffling awkwardly on their feet, looking anywhere but at each other
Ash shrugs. “I thought it was maybe an open relationship type thing, until you guys settled down and adopted or something. I figured that’s why you hate Meg so much.”
It’s more trivial annoyance than he’s felt in awhile during the drinking, the apathy, and the anger of the past few months. He relishes it a little.
“I am up. Regrettably. Considering how late we all stayed out last night, I should not be up right now.” Cas emits another unhappy sound from where his face is buried into Dean. “I have had more double dates with your brother and his wife now than I have had in a lifetime.”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel consoles gently, forehead crinkling. “That’s horrible.” He wordlessly extends an apple from his backpack towards the boy. “If no one is taking care of you, then you should take care of yourself. Steal some fruit once in awhile. Candy bars are bad for you.”
“It’s my studio, I’ll yell if I want to!” Dean shouts at an instantly regrettable volume. He somehow forgets to lower it when he powers through thoughtlessly with, “you’re also yelling, by the way!”
All in all, the great reveal had been met with less shock and denial than he had anticipated. Hell, his own realisation of his feelings for Cas was met with more surprise than this.
“I’ve been bunking off. They caught on. That’s why I’m on this stupid trip,” he glances at Castiel shiftily, “to make friends. Got about 1.5 at the moment—someone I bunk off school with and my pint-sized little brother.” He shrugs like it’s not a big deal, reaches into the rucksack tucked between his legs and flourishes out what looks like a full-sized pie.
“Why—why would you—” Dean’s voice cracks and he has to cough to cover it up. “Why would you want that?” he asks, his anger bleeding out into raw hurt.
“Um, alright,” a flustered Sam replies. His pursed lips looks like he’s holding back a thousand and one questions that Dean is not ready to answer.
“I still don’t understand why you’d want to, but I think we’ve established that I have a very hard time saying no to you.”
Saliva that’s come from Dean’s mouth, which had been on Castiel's, their lips and tongues exploring one another’s. He fretted as he stirred to consciousness that it had all been a vivid dream, borne of fantasy, and yet Dean is still here, holding Castiel to his own body like he’s afraid to let go.
Smoothing quickly back from her jauntiness to a small forlorn look to Dean, she signs at him that she’s sorry. Another woman to apologise to him today for shitshows that are staged because of him. Fabulous.
“Dean,” Cas groans, and that does amusing things to his stomach too. “Why are they still here? It’s been four days. Do these people not have jobs? They’re so loud.”
Cas could have burnt the clothes, for all he’d care. It wasn’t like Dean is ever going to wear them again, not now that they have touched Cas’ body. At least Cas didn’t keep them though. At least he had enough decency to realise he shouldn’t be wearing Dean’s things again.
He hears a dangerous grumble that could have come from no one else but Dean. It’s deep, and dark, and if Cas isn’t careful, the noise creates terrible flutters inside his stomach.
Dean leaves his seat in one quick swoop upwards, falling onto the table with one palm to steady himself.
Cas recoils away from him with a shock. The last time Dean has ever raised such a venomous tone to him was way back when they were fifteen and escaping John Winchester.
don’t really notice much,” Dean counters belatedly. He murmurs this in a much lower pitch than they’d been talking in, sending gooseflesh up Cas’ arms and his eyes back up to meet Dean’s.
Dean drinks some more of the milkshake. It’s growing on him, and he stops only when there’s less than half left so he can pass the rest to Cas.
“Right, of course,” he says, dusts off his spotless trench coat and gives a perfunctory nod to Sam. This, despite having known the kid since he was helping him learn to read. Dean’s methods had been far too stick-y and not carrot-y enough, according to Cas, though Dean is sure he had used much more eloquent wording.
His words pinch a tense space around them and all three tumble into this strange black hole of awkward silence. Lisa frowns, like she’s processing whether it’s a joke. Dean’s body slowly turns to stare at Cas, because his neck now hurts too much to move. It’s very bad timing but he thinks he’s dying because something is striking repeatedly and very forcefully against his ribcage from the inside and that can’t be normal.
What he thinks about instead is that he would like to tally up the boy’s freckles, connect the dots to create a facial constellation. He immediately frowns at this thought, adds it to the list of Things You Can Think But Never Say Aloud — an exercise Gabriel has taught him about many years ago.
“But I can’t fix the knots in your soul,” Cas continues regretfully, “I wish I could, but all I can do is be here and lend you my hand through the trek. I realise now that your heart is not mine to seize or to mend. Your heart is yours and you need to look after it the way you need to take your own showers, brush your own teeth, and chew your own food. I’ll always do anything for you, Dean, but in order for that to be sustainable, I can’t do everything for you—and I…I need to care for myself before I can care for you too.”
“Leave Sam with me. Leave my son, goddammit!” John half-pleads, in a voice both terrorising and distraught.
Maybe whatever happened last night makes them okay now—or as okay as they can be for the time being. Maybe they can go to the diner again, and Castiel can buy Dean a pie, and they can sit and watch television tonight, like they used to, where they’d take a few hours off from the strain of their lives and responsibilities to the world.
The thumb that lingers on his face moves to his lips to quiet him, and then he replaces it by touching their mouths together again.
“You said I don’t have to do anything I don’t want to. I don’t want to be not crude, whatever that means. Come on,” he urges, “have a slice. I’ll even give you my clean fork.”
“No, duh. You’d been watching anything but me the entire ride, thought you’d figure out the direction we were heading in at some point.”
“Um,” the boy mumbles after jolting at Castiel’s strange compliment. “Thanks. I guess. I like your...eyes. No homo, they just look cool. You’re like a human husky.”
“You ruined our wedding,” he bemoans into an empty tumbler, “and now you guys are fucking with Lisa, saying you’re in love and together and—” he waggles a hand dismissively at them, “—and all that shit. I don’t know what you’re doing, but it’s mean again.”
“Cas, buddy, I’m sorry to inform you of this but you’re really not my type and I’m pretty sure I’m not yours either. We’re allowed to share a goddamn bed. It’s only weird if you make it weird. Now will you get the fuck in?”
“I thought we were having dinner tonight,” Dean adopts his critical tone and stares Sam down with a disapproving look, “and you’re here getting drunk after work with your wife. You’re both very mature, by the way.”
“Are you insane?” Dean bares his teeth at her as if he’s turned into an animal himself. “We’re not here to tag-team you! We’re not—we aren’t like that.”
“I’m here to take you home,” Dean murmurs next to his ear. Castiel smiles, and he’s sure it’s a goofy one because he’s too drunk to care. He’s too inebriated to quell his desire to be near Dean.
“I think I’ve known since I was about fifteen,” Cas says casually, as if this effortless lie and change in script wouldn’t make Dean do a double take.
Dean stretches an arm over Cas shoulder’s and shuffles closer until their thighs are pressed side by side. “Sammy and Eileen gone home?”
He’s so shocked he jolts when Dean flips his hand and entwine their fingers together. They’ve never held hands. Not like this. Not so personally, where fingers are interlocked and the grip is so secure and present that it’s unmistakably a very intimate gesture.
“I’m not oblivious, Dean,” he replies, playing on a scandalised voice. When Dean doesn’t rise to the occasion with a quippy retort, he nudges his friend’s knees with his own meaningfully. “I notice most things, like how you seem not very happy right now. What can I do to make you happy, Dean?”
It’s a real relaxing noise, and Dean resents it for the fact that it calms him somewhat. Then he resents himself for trying to hold onto his temper.
Dean laughs. That’s good. Then, oh. It registers with Castiel, belatedly again, that this isn’t one of Dean’s good laughs. This is Dean’s ‘everything hurts too much but I don’t want to cry’ laugh.
“Yeah. You really are a pretty good pretender, aren’t you? Have you always been this good and I’ve just…not noticed?” Dean asks flatly.
“If there’s something we should talk about, it’s you,” Dean grits out. “I’d like to talk about why you’re so unaffected. I’m not the one acting weird here. You—you’re weird for being so fine.”
“My dad ain’t around much and my mum’s...not around at all. I pretty much just live in a motel room by myself, me and my little brother. Why’d you think I don’t even have a permission slip?” he says bitterly, picking at the loose threads on the hem of his overlong shirt.
Benny is shoved away for the second time as Dean propels through him. He looks barely bothered by the intrusion, only sapped and fatigued.
Benny boggles at Dean, caught between stunned and furious. Eventually, he yells, “Are you out of your goddamn mind?”
“My vessel, I think, is getting…older,” Cas muses. “I don’t mind it too much, aside from the constant need to relieve myself or when my knees start to burn when I run.” He glances down at his body in grimace.
“Well,” Dean flails, voice high, “that’s a damn lie. Anyone would look. It doesn’t mean I want to bang him or anything. He’s objectively a very attractive guy.”
“Cas!” Dean squeals back with levity. His lips are drawn up into a charming grin that is absolutely dashing.
Eileen bites her lip, holding her composure for about twenty seconds before collapsing into giggles and her husband.
Castiel glances down to see Dean pushing himself upwards by Castiel’s thighs, smacking his lips together like his maw is sticky.
“No!” Sam squeaks, “I just—you look at Cas like...like...I just thought—I dunno, people at school call you destiel—”
“I think Sam and Eileen are awake. I hear them pottering around outside,” Cas mumbles against Dean’s shoulder now, face inching down to smush flat against the fabric of his shirt.
Dean clears his throat dramatically, perches his ass onto the coffee table facing where Cas is sat, and relaunches back into his proposal, “all I’m saying is that it’s the best and least awkward clear out for both of us. I don’t want Ben to think I’m leaving his mom because I’m just—not that into her—”
“Can I ask why you guys did that to Lisa?” Eileen asks after one too many fortuitous minutes of quietude. “Are you really breaking up with her, Dean, and it was an easy out that you didn’t think through? Or—or some prank I don’t understand again like at Sam’s bachelor party? I just…want to understand.”
“I didn’t do that with anyone. I went on one date. You suggested I moved on from you. You suggested that I, as you phrased, get the fuck over it,” Cas snarls, pacing towards where Dean is slouched in his chair. He leans forward with threat in his face, so unlike the strange but tender Cas that is Dean’s—and much more like Castiel, the strong, thunderous, commanding angel Dean first stabbed in the barn.
“Just—time,” he groans, struggling to keep his head upright. “I want to get better. At least in this if I can’t take back all the killing, the disappointment, the failures. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I want to—I want more than this. With you. I need time. Please.”
It’s with a fuck-you kind of timing that with blood on his coat, mud on their shoes, gore and guts covering everything, that Dean thrusts his fists and clasps onto Cas’ trench lapels and firmly says, “No.”
Eileen winces at the animosity that’s entered the room along with Dean. He almost feels bad. Almost.
When they were much younger, before bones stiffened and backs ached and hard muscles melted into soft fat pockets at their sides, they would roughhouse like this to settle disagreements. Dean would smack Cas’ cheek in rapid succession while having him pinned beneath until he agreed to let them watch another Clint Eastwood movie over nature documentaries.
They’re cuddling on the couch when Sam enters, holding a bowl of cereal and munching on its contents merrily. He stops when he sees them.
. It’s likely the copious amounts of alcohol we drank. I’m sobering up, but I feel as if I’ve consumed an entire liquor store and it’s not pleasant.”
I can’t believe I had abandoned this for so so long 😭 This was something I was so excited about writing but some personal issues and time constraints just got the better of me...
They sing along to Dean’s mixtape, the one Cas apparently carries in his trench-coat pocket, a revelation that makes Dean turn even darker red—probably the shade of a beetroot now.
Dean is back-pedalling with high speed from the pat-on-the-back cleverness of his plan. He also starts to war over what he was trying to win during this wrestle in the first place.
remember finding Dean sitting on the floor, staring blankly ahead, their bookcase lying beside him along with an assortment of books, baubles, and broken glass.
It’s like Dean’s not even in the room, or worse, in one but as a child with two parents hovering over him like he doesn’t understand big adult words and big adult ideas. He huffs and crosses his arms petulantly.
“Cas!” Sam exclaims, barrelling through the door like the interrupting moose that he’s always been. Dean curses beneath his breath and shuffles further away from Cas.
“Isn’t as permanent, Sammy,” Dean declares with a casual tip of the head, already halfway down the hallway with a dumbfounded Cas on his arm.
He parts his mouth as if to ask, then smiles darkly as if the ‘does-not-compute’ element of his brain has been overridden by ‘whatever’.
The key they couldn’t find is dangling from John’s hands, extended towards Dean who snatches at it viciously.
His eyes wander towards Eileen, who’s stood up and is now pulling a face at Sam, and something like understanding seems to punch into Sam’s brain. Finally.
Castiel feels something tug at his lips, a movement he’s not entirely used to, and then he finds himself throwing his head back with unadulterated laughter.
It’s his hands which cup Cas’ cheeks first, gentle and reassuring, perhaps a little questioning too.
“What can I say, man? Not really feeling super with it today, I guess,” Dean mutters, sliding into his seat and igniting the engine.
“The winky-face asshole? Was it…that dick you met the night I came and picked you up?” he asks, teeth clenching in anger or anguish—he doesn’t know.
“Surprise, Dean! You’ve been laying kisses on me since we were teenagers and—and stripping in front of me and wrestling me and
Charlie once said to him on a rainy afternoon, when Rowena’s spell-cracking was headed nowhere and Crowley had irritated him so much during a phone call that his brain had checked out, that Castiel’s face had looked so done. Castiel didn’t quite understand how his facial features could combine together to resemble that of a task finished. Or perhaps a well-cooked piece of meat.
Dean’s heart sinks a little from the yearning he feels in that moment, the yearning that he has to temper because it isn’t returned. He wants to risk it all again—the fight, the rejection, the crumble of their familiarity for a crumb of something more. He wants so heavily that it’s weighing him down.
Dean feels his chest puff a bit with pride and quickly rebound with bewilderment. There’s a bounce of giddiness hopping inside him at Cas’ tentative credence in the plan, though it’s also directed at something
“Don’t do that!” Cas smacks Dean on the nose as if he were a poorly trained puppy. “You know I don’t like being bitten!”
“Heaven is dying, I believe…or the smudge of grace returned to me from Metatron is no longer viable to keep me strong. Whichever the case, I am falling. My powers, they…they’ve been fading, weakening. It’s likely I will become fully human soon.”
Sam snorts, as if the idea was laughable. “I’ve seen you check out guys’ asses, Dean, and Doctor Sexy? You’re bisexual, man.”
Maybe it’s because he’s a little drunk, his emotions are riding high, and it's spilling over regardless of Dean’s desire to cap it. Maybe it’s because he can’t go through it again, but this time, he manages to backtrack.
I don’t...I don’t know what happened. This was meant to be light-hearted, fun, and fluff but I turned this chapter into an emotional pinefest. I literally had to add an angst tag just for this chapter. I’m sorry!
This boy’s parents, Castiel surmises with regret, likely felt the same or had forgotten. Neither options were nice to think about.
When he’s sober, he’s hungover. When he’s drunk, he agonises over the words Cas said. He can’t decide between what he’d prefer; for Cas to have been confused over what in love means, or for it to all be…real.
Castiel thinks he might have been a little too touchy, a little too clingy, a little too obvious last night. He’s already confessed his feelings but it’s obviously not reciprocated, and he’d been doing so well in keeping his distance from Dean so as to not make him uncomfortable.
A muffled and surprised sound hums through where their lips touch. He deepens the grazing of their mouths. Cas responds with an enthusiasm that has Dean grinning into their kiss and eventually he’s grinning too widely to continue so vigorously so he inches back to pepper Cas’ jaw with small pecks. It’s a new and thrilling development up until Cas pulls away.
At April’s doorstep, after ringing the bell, they both face each other with regret and mortification.
“Cas, you know I—I…” Dean bites his lips and his shoulders quiver with some kind of restraint. “Cas, I…I really…fuck.” He tightens his hold of their hands and says, eyes squeezed shut, “just give me a second.”
Dean’s eyes crinkle at the corners with mirth. It sends Cas’ relief to wondrous heights to see the glitter of joy that still thrives between them no matter how bad things get. He often feels like he’s walking on a tightrope where he may teeter off at any moment, sending their friendship into an abyss the moment one verbalized thought reveals where his heart lies.
Cas reaches for his bicep and squeezes. He puts a quick kiss onto Dean’s cheek, and it calms him immediately. He finds himself struggling not to smile.
Dean grumbles, “cotton mouth.” He has a cantankerous expression on him that vanishes instantly when his eyes lock onto Castiel’s bewildered ones. Everything brightens when Dean grins sloppily at him.
“I called you two mean. I didn’t—I didn’t realise it would ever be a thing. I thought that’s what you two were just like. I—I’m so sorry, Dean. I never even tried to talk to you or—or support you. I mean a couple of years ago I thought maybe—you two look at each other like you’ve both hung the moon. I should’ve gone with my gut and just talked to you about it earlier. I’m sorry.” His head crumples forward onto his knees.
This was until his friendship with Dean Winchester started skewing his wiring with happy flickers of unpredictability.
He thinks about how he’s now watching the shape of Dean and wants Dean in any way he can have him—but he doesn’t need it. He wants Dean, but he doesn’t need the entirety of Dean, only the scraps willing to be shared, because this friendship is more than enough.
“Asshole,” he slings at Cas playfully, reaching to hold his waist, pull him forwards, and peck him on the lips.
Dean considers wrenching away from Cas. Instead, he run a hand down Cas’ arm, the one looped around him, and raises his eyebrows as if daring Sam to say something shitty. Obviously, he doesn’t.
They’re at the point now where they don’t pretend like they don’t hear each other so Dean agrees, “yeah.”
This is the moment that Cas’ chest caves with more want than he’s allowed himself to feel in almost a decade and also the same moment that a girl with dark brown curls in stilettos and leather trips over where he is sitting.
“Dean, please do not speak for me,” Cas interjects quietly. He takes a deep breath, controlling his emotions. He’s good at this. He’s practiced it enough to be an expert.
Tracing a classmate’s freckles probably comes under the same vein as asking his mother if lipstick was really necessary because
Benny looks comfortable and at ease, though Dean suspects his languor is an act, that he’s alert and watching Dean intently for a misstep. They conduct general chitchat, neither vying too off course and into the dangerous territory of how Dean and Cas actually came to be. Benny never prods or pokes any further than ‘how’s the commitment life?’ or ‘you guys going to move into a house soon?’ or ‘what are y’all doing tonight?’
He stumbles and Dean catches him, both arms winding around his waist, and Castiel thinks this is great. He should get drunk and helpless more often as long as Dean is around. He selfishly takes what he can get, leaning again, pressing again, clutching again at Dean’s jacket.
She lethargically rolls her eyes and shoves her way past Cas, past Dean, past Benny, and finally past their sight.
“We are way past like, my friend!” he continues, voice raising with every word. “We sailed straight past like a decade or so ago! You are not this stupid, Dean!”
“I have a date,” Cas simply repeats, as if Dean merely didn’t hear him the first time. As if Dean isn’t being pulled apart inside like a toy for toddlers, parts broken and smashed and separated and torn.
Castiel smiles at him brightly, abandoning his soup at once as he rises towards the kitchen’s exit. “Let me just get dressed quickly and we’ll go.”
“Not to my knowledge, no,” Cas murmurs back in an undertone. He rushes up a couple of steps to catch April by the elbow. “April, I thought we were going to watch a movie.”
“Holy shit,” Dean laughs suddenly, taking Castiel aback. “Man, I haven’t slept for that long or that well—in—well…years.” He peeks at Castiel, eyes blurred from sleep and soft all the same. “Maybe you’re a good sleep aid. Nice—er…cuddle buddy or whatever.”
It was a lot easier when they were hurting each other physically. Stabbing with knives and angel blades, over looks and words and actions lashed out in anger.
“Oh!” Jack exclaims. “Of course. Sorry. I’ll wait in the living room. You can bring the hot cocoa to me after your sex.” He smiles gratefully once more at them before exiting the room.
Cas is smiling at him, but it is too sympathetic, too awash with forlornness. Dean thinks maybe he can kiss that away, so without thinking too much about it, he sweeps in to press their lips together.
Involuntarily, Castiel’s eyes glue onto the boy and his pie. He’s still trembling ever so slightly even as he demolishes the monstrosity before him and his arm is prickled with goose-flesh.
If he wanted, he could look. He could stare. It wouldn’t raise any unseemly suspicions. They’ve done much less and much more and Dean has seen him naked more times than he would care to think about. If he reimagined his memories, it would likely send him into a mild panic attack.
Eventually the anxiety melts under Cas’ adorable snuffles and the weighty arm which falls haphazardly across Dean’s waist at some point in the night.
“I don’t hate myself,” Sam says gently, “but I do hate that I’ve not been a good brother to you lately. Not even a good friend.” He takes a swig of his drink—Dean realises it’s not even beer, but pear cider today, something Sam bought for Eileen. “I’ve been all caught up in making sure she’s real, you know? That she’s really back. That I can hold her, and laugh with her, and read up on cases with her. And with everything else going on, with Cas being back and falling as well, I guess I started to turn a blind eye to you. I’m sorry.” Because of course, Sam has no trouble saying the words I’m sorry.
Instead, Dean’s stomach grumbles, he can’t say it, and Cas suggests they visit a diner as Sam and Eileen are still likely hiding out, avoiding Dean and Cas, waiting for them to sort their shit out.
Dean pretends to whine into a corner before bounding back into Cas’ personal space to playfully snap his teeth at him. Cas belts out a boisterous burst of drunken giggles, shoving him away by his sternum.
“I was referencing your savagery, sharp teeth, and oh—you’re a fucking mean beast. Also, I’m running out of puns.”
sorry, and before he can explain himself, Cas has hauled one of Sam’s arm, the size of a python, over his shoulder. Dean hastily makes himself of similar use.
“If you aren’t returning to that place again, perhaps you can go to Bobby’s after all. I’m sure he’ll take you in and protect you from your father,” Cas proposes, tentative. “It’s got to be better than living out of this car.”
“I thought this would be cosier,” Dean replies with ease, beaming at Cas. He reaches for his hands across the booth, not really thinking about it anymore, but Cas jumps away like snakes are winding their way towards him.
Sam grumbles something indecipherable and moody under his breath. It doesn’t take long for him to curl up on himself, eyes fluttered shut.
“I have no idea what you were talking about either, but I’m gonna chance a guess that whatever it is, it’s about Dean.” She drops her head backwards and emits a loud groan as if her body was physically protesting her actions. “
He circles around their street a few times, thrown between intermingled dread and delight. Eventually, Dean bites the bullet and gingerly pads inside his home.
Dean raises his brow at Bobby, unimpressed. “If you’re trying to give me an LGBTQ talk, you’re doing a terrible job. Bit too cavalier and insensitive for the kids these days.”
“Yes, you, dumbass,” retorts Dean, resolutely ignoring poor flabbergasted Lisa. He once again has to haul ass with one hand urging Cas along with him by the shoulder, as far out of earshot as he can reach without leaving her by herself entirely.
Instead of saying this, he forces a tenuous laugh. “Quoting philosophy first thing in the morning, huh? You know, Cas, I could listen to you talk for hours.” The playful jibe doesn’t come off sounding like a jibe at all. It softens too much into truth. “You’re really clever. I don’t know why you spend so much time with me,” he admits wryly.
“You stupid son of a bitch,” Dean laugh-cries, rushing to his side and patting Cas down like a mother hen.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas laments, “I’m so sorry you didn’t get to take my virginity,” he lilts, the joke rolling off his tongue with ease and spearing his brain with a stress headache that he hides with a teasing grin.
“Didn’t realise that was a loaded question,” Sam says, huffing an awkward and stilted laugh. “I’m going on a supply run to get Eileen some clothes, food, and um—lady things. She’s still resting a lot too. Falling angels and people back from the dead, am I right?” He’s blabbering now, rubbing his neck. “Must just be another Thursday, I guess.”
“Alright,” he says distractedly while he searches for his keys. “Well done for getting your head out of your ass before you hit your mid-thirties.”
“Oh, Cas, you wound me,” Dean belly-laughs, “I can’t believe an angel like you would do that to his own boyfriend.”
!” Cas cries as she uses their interlocked hands to smack him upside the head in a brutal wallop. “What was that for?” he demands, betrayed.
“No, no,” Castiel says quickly, “it’s just—the idea of any kind of food right now…I…I am not feeling entirely too well.”
He’d like to be able to reach out and fluff Cas’ hair, hug his waist, kiss his cheek in the difficult mornings they’re all going to have to face.
Three days after ‘the incident’—where Dean has stopped speaking to Cas entirely, bar the occasional grunt of acknowledgement as they walk past each other in the bunker—he finds his loaned clothes freshly laundered and neatly folded, sitting on his dresser.
“Cas, fine, okay, shut up. I said I was sorry for not listening to you earlier, alright? And coming up with this plan. And being...mean. I thought this would be a lot easier and we could just—I don’t know...go with the flow. I’m sorry I threw away your index cards.”
Cas hesitates for another moment. He takes a deep breath, trying to clear his jumbled thoughts and feelings. He’s failing miserably in that task. Dean’s upper body is rising and falling at a much slower rate than Cas’ pulse is. He finds himself trying to slow it to the beat of his best friend’s inhales and exhales.
“Okay, okay,” Dean gasps, a little breathless, “stupid idea, really fucking crazy and stupid, let’s just—let’s just go, alright?”
Cas settles him, holds his shoulders, and helps him slide down the wall beside them. Cas crouches to the floor with Dean and holds onto one side of his cheek with a warm and soothing palm. It's a bit callused. Like Dean's. They match sometimes. He tries to fumble for Cas' other hand with his, trying to see if they can touch palms like in that Tarzan movie. He watched it once as a teenager with some girl from his class he was trying to sleep with.
A horrifying thought strikes Dean and he is suddenly overcome with an irrational and paralysing fear that he’s misunderstood everything.
Cas’ impromptu confession dragged a lot of him and yet there’s still enough adrenaline pumping through his veins that he almost powers through to confess everything to Dean in its entirety.
He shivers, and it takes a few minutes for his heart to gentle its roar inside his chest. He takes a few deep breaths, slow and steady.
“I’m probably bi, man,” he mumbles, and it feels uncomfortable, strange, but also pretty gut-punch awesome satisfying to say—well, mumble beneath his breath.
They’re finally looking at each other properly. He’s finally able to, yet again, grip to the blue in Cas’ eyes like it’s a lifeline.
“Well, that makes you dafter than I pegged you for. That boy’s been pining for you since you were about yea high.” Bobby brings his straightened hand to his chest.
“Getting ready to fuck you.” Cas’ gut drops and his heart flounders. Then, Dean rolls his eyes. “What does it look like I’m doing, man? I’m going to sleep. It’s been a hell of a long night,” he grouses, slipping beneath the sheets. He shuffles over to make room for another body. “You getting in or what?”
When they park, he lets go and Cas actively distances himself again as they walk side by side in public. It’s both a relief that Cas understands and gut-wrenching that Dean still needs this.
“I cannot believe you forgot to text Sam,” huffs Cas, quickly casting his gaze away from Dean’s mouth.
“Well…” Castiel puts on a ponderous face, and Dean thinks, un-fucking-believable, “I ordered a milkshake for myself and I assume that…you want to share? I could have just ordered us two. I didn’t know you liked chocolate milkshakes. Are you upset that I only ordered one?”
spikes at the touch. He’s a bit uncertain whether the clouded memory of what just happened is clogged in his brain by adrenaline or a concussion, but right now,
“I’m not upset,” he laughs spitefully, “I’m ecstatic for you! I did tell you to get over it. Remember? I said that. I rejected you, and now you’re free to do whatever. Didn’t realise you’d get over it so quickly but I’m glad you did, man. Now we don’t have to walk on eggshells around each other with your gay fucking feelings for me. It’s fucking fabulous. I always knew you were just confused.”
Dean puffs on an amused breath and stressfully works his fingers into fists, in and out. “Yeah, I guess not. I’m scared too, if that sounds saner. More like me. Really scared. Like I’m gonna throw up, but I’ve been feeling a lot of that lately so I guess it’s the new normal. Nauseous from my feelings for you and hangovers. Mostly you,” he rambles, bumping his hip into the table as he tries to cross it to get closer to Cas.
“And you often promptly, without hesitation, become best friends with any stray child that thinks you are cool? That sounds to me like concerning behaviour, Dean.”
“Oh, Cas,” Sam says sympathetically. His hand clasps onto Cas’ shoulder. “We’re going to fight this together. Your falling, Chuck, everything else the world has to throw at us.” The way they touch also isn’t the same, Dean thinks.
“Er...” he looks to Cas. Cas glances down at himself then shakes his head. Dean stares again at the mug.
Cas shrugs. “I’ve always been content with just the being, not the having. I never needed Dean to reciprocate, I never expected anything, or needed it. He was always as straight as they come. I just want him to be happy.” Cas smiles at Dean like it wouldn’t make his heart bloom.
Benny opens his arms wide, his wingspan extending to the point where he’s almost whacking Dean in the face with his outspread hands.
“You both realise you are in public, right?” Benny drawls, watching them apathetically. “Incorrigible, you boys are.”
“Heya Cas.” This voice is familiar. This voice is the one he could listen to until the end of the world. It’s cheerful right now, a touch false in said cheer, but it’s still layered in kindness and affection and a bit gruff and—Dean.
“Oh,” Cas says, and Dean curves his neck to look at him where—shit, Cas is pretty, but also so handsome, with flushed cheeks and moist lips. He also sees that Cas is blinking owlishly at him, as if in confusion.
“Frankly, I don’t believe I owe you an answer.” Cas’ voice is cold. It makes the room feel cold too.
“Will you just—” Cas stops and sips at the air slowly with a steadying inhale. His eyes quiver shut then opens firmly with resolve. “Can we just go?”
Dean shrugs, pushes his palms into Cas’ thighs for comfort. “What can I say? Gets lonely in my head while I’m lying next to Lisa and feeling bad about it the entire time. I know I was joking about it but there’s no way I would actually fire her or do something fucked up like that. I don’t want her to feel awkward around me if I bump into her at the studio. I don’t want Ben thinking his mom just isn’t good enough when really it’s…it’s me, you know? What am I gonna say, it’s not you or your son, it’s me? Something in me feels like it’s just not clicking? Like it’s never clicked with any woman I’ve ever been with and it’s just not doing it with you either?” Dean glances downwards and worries at his bottom lip with the sharp line of his teeth.
“I think we will, however, struggle to find a store that sells paint on Christmas Eve. Any open store, stocking anything, in fact.”
I'm thinking of perhaps adding a chapter as a second series to this, having a look at Dean and Cas later on in life - a snapshot, somewhat, of their future where their relationship is more established and Dean has come to accept himself more fully. I probably won't be able to help myself, so let me know if anyone would be interested in some kind of work like that :)
This was ALSO supposed to be a 5 + 1 chapter from Cas’ POV that visits five different timelines of Dean and Cas’ friendship.
He gets perhaps three minutes of restful tranquility before his window flies open to disturb the peace.
Bobby made a flyaway comment about it a few months later and Dean’s now been enlisted, along with Benny and a couple of other guys from the garage, to fix it in a week from now.
He exits the room without waiting for Cas and does actually find Sam sat on the floor, looking haunted.
A thrill hits his stomach, serrated and thrashing. He wonders if this is what humans talked about when they compare joyous stomach troubles to that of the flutter of butterflies.
“I was right though,” Dean calls, with Castiel’s foot halfway out the door. “You looked ridiculous last night. Baggy and…just—not right. Take something from my closet.”
Throughout the next couple of days, Cas wishes quietly to himself that Dean wouldn’t turn up at his place Friday night, brooding and adamant. He obviously does anyway.
“Do you want me to come over so we can tell Bobby together along with everyone else and—oh my god, we have to lie to Bobby,” Cas bleats with regret. “Oh my god, I feel sick.”
“You’re going to date someone and you don’t even care what parts they’ve got down there?” he asks accusatorially.
“But that’s only me projecting my own traits onto what my type is as opposed to what I’m actually attracted to, which I suppose, from experience, seems to be somewhat—”
Dean barely sees him, though he does hear him talking in murmured whispers with Sam and Eileen around the bunker, hears him in the shower, hears him pottering about in his room, hears him humming to himself as he makes breakfast.
“What are you going to do, live with him forever? You lived with him in college, you’re living with him after college, and then what? Are you going to move him into your guest room when you get a wife and buy a house with a white picket fence? He isn’t your therapy dog, Dean.”
That Cas knows he isn’t allowed to share in Dean’s possessions anymore sends a sick jolt of satisfaction through him, but also sits uncomfortably and wretchedly in the pit of his stomach.
It still sucks that when he walks into the kitchen, both Sam and Eileen are there, sharing sickeningly kind gazes and a bowl of ice cream. Probably that vegan blend of frozen bananas or some disgusting shit like that.
Dean reckons this is what having a heart attack while you win the lottery feels like. He’s buzzing, with fear, with excitement, and the tiniest bit of nausea.
“Nice,” Cas finishes, smiling off into the distance as he stares out the window. He traces sundry lines across the condensation. “Nice and human,” he repeats quietly, probably to himself.
“Sam,” Dean says again, voice cracking. “I’m not ready to think about it. I’m not ready to let myself want it. Okay? Cas, he’s—I just can’t. I don’t even know if it’s real.” Cas’ words echoes in his head. That they are real. Dean wishes it was enough to make him believe it.
“Because I needed to go to the bathroom!” Benny scowls at him from the side as they make their way towards the impala. “Andrea dropped me off and took the car. You said you’d give me a ride home. Have you knocked your head?”
Dean inhales deeply and glances up at Castiel, some kind of determination set in his face. Castiel’s seen that look before. It’s the look Dean gives the monsters he’s about to fight.
Cas is polite. As always. A little too polite, if you ask Dean. He smiles at her too much, and when she smiles back flirtatiously and says he has a cute smile, he thanks her.
“Bet you’re getting up to way more than sleeping now, aren’t you, Dean?” Garth reaches across the table to poke him jauntily.
He’s already out the bedroom door April was leaving through not too long ago. “I’d message her now if I were you. Give her a heads up.”
Sam shuts Cas’ bedroom door behind them with a resounding thwump. Eileen’s giggles trickle through their walls.
Charlie emphasises her point by slamming the door behind her. With as much fury and annoyance as Dean once did six years ago at Cas’ first girlfriend’s doorstep.
She bends over, kneels enticingly on the bed, and kisses him briefly before pulling back. Cas wipes his mouth with the back of his hand while she’s turned towards the door. She throws him one last look of lasciviousness prior to bouncing away on her kitten heels.
“No, I—this is your place. You were already watching something. You should stay,” he says, resting a hand on Dean’s shoulder to nudge him back down towards the couch. It’s a functional touch, but Dean savours it like a starving man chewing at stale breadcrumbs.
“Where did you even meet them?” he manages to slur, trying to come off casual and instead sounding incredibly spiteful and hurt. He’s always being spiteful to Castiel.
What’s bothering him is how right it felt when Lisa had clasped their hands and assured them that this was allowed. What’s bothering him is how when Lisa talked about wanting a family, all he could think about was how he already had one and the man was standing next to him.
“No cute little home projects, no sharing beds on cold nights instead of just turning on the damn heating—it’s really not that expensive, my friend—and
Dean throws his hands in the air with defeat. Three for three in one day. Picture-perfect timing. Today has just been one long terrible 80s movie, and Dean’s sure that if Cas and he were two seconds away from kissing, someone would interrupt that as well.
“Cas, honestly, you’re a smart guy. Why would any girl volunteer to put up with you and your...let’s say quirks, if this wasn’t the endgame?” she asks with growing exasperation.
“I don’t know why I keep hurting you and everyone else I love,” Dean says quietly. “But you. Mostly you.”
“Dean, this was the same waitress you once offered we, as you say, tag-teamed. Do you not remember? Why are you suddenly upset now about her being flirtatious?”
“I’m going to say fine for now because you are so drunk that I’m sure you’ll forget this stupid idea by morning, and if not then, most
“Cas,” Dean chokes, “you can’t—” but he wants, “you can’t just say shit like that, man,” he manages through strained, uncomfortable laughter. “It’s too fucking much.”
It isn’t until they both slam the door of the bunker shut behind them that Dean realises he’s alone with Cas for the first time in two weeks.
Dean grimaces. At least he’s not mentioned to Benny yet that he’s been making out with Cas like a touch-staved teenager. He reckons that would be the final nail in the coffin of Benny’s sanity.
Sam and Eileen are at the bar, throwing peanuts into each other’s mouth’s. Sam is waving a huge paw-like hand at them, eyes peripherally still trained on the peanuts flying at him, his mouth gaping open. They’re roaring with laughter, falling into each other, and Sam almost slips off the bar stool by waving too hard at Dean and Cas.
“We have Santa hats,” Sam adds, “festive enough. I don’t think we don’t need an excuse to kiss who we want,” Sam consoles her, rubbing his eyes with the hilt of his palm. “We’ll see you two in the morning—”
Castiel has always been conscious of his odd thoughts and tendencies, with a marked improvement in mediating them recently.
“Right,” Dean chokes back. Unconsciously, he wipes one hand down his bathrobe, at the wetness stuck to it from Cas’ damp chest slamming into him.
Bad timing, such bad timing that Dean almost bursts out with a snigger, but he’s never seen Cas’ arms bare before and he realises they look…nice. Like a lot of things about Cas. He’d like to run a hand down one.
The car almost swerves off the road and they all scream like small children until Dean manages to steady the wheel.
Cas bristles, squeezes Dean’s hand again, but with indignation now. “I don’t appreciate you deriding my intelligence, Dean, as I am definitely
“I don’t want it getting wet on our table, and turns out we don’t need it. We don’t mind sharing,” he explains with false cheer.
Please don’t hate Benny for discouraging their admittedly cute but ultimately unhealthy behaviour, he’s just trying to be a good friend
“Fine,” he mumbles childishly, but his face betrays his petulance by quirking his lips at Cas. “You’re my favourite person you know. I wish I just stayed home with you today. It was a damn two-person job.”
"Dean and Cas tried the whole relationship thing once even though they’re pretty darn happy with their respective wives now. They're just really, really good friends. Platonic soulmates, if you will. It would have been a crime to not have tried it at least once. Isn’t that so silly and funny?”
“It’s good to see you smile,” Dean says hesitantly, inspecting his fingernails and avoiding Castiel’s gaze, “but why did you get so drunk, Cas?” His voice isn’t angry like Castiel has come used to expecting. It’s tender. It’s worried. Castiel leans in more, presses further into Dean’s side, until Dean has to lift his arm away and set it behind on Castiel’s shoulders.
“Did we really ever establish boundaries?” Dean asks. “What the fuck are we? Are we just gonna fuck and that’ll be it?”
Dean plunks his head against the wheel. “Shit, I know, Cas. My idea of a human is just fucked up and selfish, grim and shit, and…you’re—you’re none of those things. I’m sorry. I’m a fucking asshole, I’m so fucking sorry.”
“Last time I checked, it’s the afternoon so if I want a couple of beers, I’m entitled to some,” Dean explains, but then, unable to help himself, acidly adds, “also I’m pretty sure both my parents are dead so you’re sure as shit not one of them. Mind your own fucking business.”
?” Benny shouts maniacally like a man possessed, his arms flying in every direction. It would be a comical sight if he didn’t appear so terrifying amidst his frenzy. “You think you like him! Is that a joke?”
Cas is pulling back much too soon, staring open-mouthed at Dean. He looks either astounded or petrified. Both?
“Dean,” Cas says gently, “You always have time. Until you take your last breath, you have time to do anything. And me, you know I do…everything for you. I can wait, I can help, I’ve fallen, I’ve rebelled—”
When Dean looks back to his saviour, Cas has his head tilted in the sweet, novice-human kind of way that reminds Dean of ten years previous. He’s looking at Dean with a mixture of curiosity and tenderness, something of the latter making him feel a dozen different kinds of uncomfortable.
“Don’t say shit like that to me. He’s not—he’s not that. He’s everything to me. I’m allowed to want him around for as long as I can have him!” Dean argues with fervour. “He’s my—he’s my—this is
?” echoes Dean with disbelief but an eager fervour all the same. His pupils have dilated to the point of dwarfing the hazel-speckled green that surrounds it.
Dean had reached for the whiskey bottle immediately in Cas’ silence, and Cas, too eagerly, joined him in their shared shitty habit of burying feelings. They had sat beside each other, neither one uttering a noise other than the gulping of liquor.
“We have everything but mistletoe,” Eileen announces sleepily before they all lumber towards their bedrooms.
“Did you have to work Christmas Eve when you were—you know—when I didn’t let you stay,” he forces the words out, revelling in the punishing punch to his gut. He definitely deserves to be as miserable as that rude cashier on a night like this, not cosy in his chest with the love of his life next to him.
Cas opens the car seat and settles inside, cuts Dean off, pulls the seatbelt around him and then nags at Dean to do the same.
“It did go very well.” Dean’s shoulders slump. “Not so much when I ended up spilling the beans to Benny in the car. I...I told him everything.”
“It’s never going to click with anyone for me, is it?” Dean had muttered, biting at the skin of his thumb. Cas remembers this because he had stared too hard. “I’m not even sure what being in love feels like. The only person I—forget it. I’m happy, I’m happy, but shit—I’m gonna die alone.”
“Dean is here,” he hears himself mutter stupidly, then shakes his head, because Dean couldn’t be here. Why is Dean here?
“What? What’s the problem? I don’t care, mom wouldn’t have cared, dad—well, maybe he would a bit, but he’s dead now so who cares? Who cares except you, Dean?” Sam needles, facing him once more, earnest. “It’s okay to be who you are. Even while the world is burning down around us. Let’s clutch at whatever happiness we can, right? What’s the point in punishing ourselves? God does it enough for us.”
Dean’s peripheral vision catches Sam and Eileen staring on with shit-eating grins and then bumping into each other in their failed process of dispersing.
Dean responds with the winning Dean Winchester grin, lascivious and charming, directed only at Cas but more for the benefit of the waitress.
Castiel nods his assent, patting his jacket—borrowed from Dean—down. He curses too, a habit he’s sure he’s learnt from Dean.
Cas looks caught in headlights. “I thought everyone left for a hunt,” he replies, words a little stunted. “I was invited, but I…declined.” Dean knows what that means. Cas thought he’d have to be in the same car as Dean, around Dean, so he chose to stay behind. Unfortunately for them, Dean is still here.
“I certainly am not,” Cas says, suddenly falling serene and vacant, “and I can also assure you that I am not pining for you because of some kisses. The idea is absolutely ridiculous.”
Cas snorts and goes to pick up his book again. “Sensible. I see you’ve resorted all possible alternatives before fake-jumping into bed with your best friend.”
“It was sweet.” Cas pats Dean’s cheek affectionately and Dean has to actively try not to chase Cas’ hand once it leaves his orbit.
Sam concedes tentatively, patting Dean on the back and letting him know for the gazillionth time that he’s here for him. That if he ever needed to talk.
His friend gawks at him as if he’s the most stupid man on the planet, and at this point, he may very well just accept that he may be.
“I like Cas a hell of a lot more,” Dean blurts without thinking. It seems to catch them both of guard, but Dean a little more.
“Wow. Um. Okay,” Dean mumbles. “Just feels a bit like your quiet is...an expression of disapproval, of sorts.”
“I can leave,” he says, sitting up from his couch and gathering the empty bottles to put in the trash. When he looks up, Cas is standing next to him.
“Are you experiencing feelings that are new? Am I suddenly something different to you now?” There is an element of fear is Cas’ voice that Dean is not used to. “Was I wrong to have thought our friendship was inviolable?”
“How many women have you paraded around me over the years?” Cas asks firmly. “How many have I had to watch you drool over and touch and kiss? Even Anna—”
“Cas,” Dean tries again and falls short. His eyes drop down to where their socked toes almost touch. They’re standing only a little away from one another. It would take a second to close the distance between them.
“No, I just—what I’m saying is we should probably learn how to kiss like lovers not like friends playing a joke—y’know?”
“Should I tell that hunter guy to piss off then? Now that you’ve found your one true love and everything,” Sam says, loopy. “You must’a had a good date. Dude won’t shut up about you. Says you’re a right great kisser, so, good for Dean, right?” He grins.
“Stop that.” When Cas rotates his head to throw Dean a dirty look, Dean flinches at the risk of being found ogling. “You’re going to stop disparaging yourself. I am so tired of you being the only person blind to your value. You're the most caring man on Earth. You are the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know—"
, and,” he pauses, embarrassed, “I don’t really know anything much else about the guy.” He shrugs. “Just overhear you sometimes when you talk in your sleep. Cute. Spouting off about french philosophers though? Nerd.”
“Heya Cas.” This voice is familiar. This voice is the one he could listen to until the end of the world. It’s cheerful right now, a touch false in said cheer, but it’s still layered in kindness and affection and a bit gruff and—Dean.
“I can’t believe this,” Dean shakes his head, gnawing at his lips, “She’s never going to buy this. You acted like a fucking alien out there! More than usual! Have you ever met a human being before? Who talks like that? We were supposed to be leaving, Cas. This was a bad idea. What—what the
They also become the only two left on the bus at the field trip’s third stop because Castiel’s mother refused to sign off permission for this portion of the trip. Waterfalls are dangerous. It doesn’t upset Castiel too much, registers to him as simply one more childhood experience redacted due to her anxieties.
“Is there something on my face?” Cas asks cluelessly, dabbing around his mouth and frowning down at his clean hands.
Also, I felt the need to explain why Charlie and Dorothy seemed a better match for me than the more explicitly canon Charlie x Stevie - we didn’t really get much screen time of their chemistry before she poof’d off the CW for being gay, and our OG Charlie seemed better suited to Dorothy. Just my humble opinion! x
Ahhh I’m sorry if the angst got too much again. Next chapter WILL be lighter and back to basics with fun interlaced with emotion and happy happy happy ❤️
It’s difficult to keep up this energy when everyone around him is looking at him so fondly and with a disgusting amount of amusement.
, he almost word-vomits. Cas is close enough that Dean can see the vibrations of his shoulders, agitated beneath the guise of calm.
“And a minute ago, you were balking at the idea. Now—now you’re half-naked in a bed and asking me to join you!”
Cas recoils at Dean’s tone, but composes himself just as quickly. He stands a little taller. “I believe you often partake in the same activity enough to know why I’d be going to a bar by myself.”
Cas embraces him immediately and Dean envelops him with such tightness that implies he never wants to let go.
Dean hides his face with his hands and groans. “You’re too good to me. Stop it. I’m always fucking up and you’re always here and—and I don’t deserve it.”
It’s not entirely nothing yet. There’s dust from the wreckage and some anxiety-ridden fragments splayed across the floor of Dean’s mind, but at least there’s no wall now.
“No, I mean,” Castiel stops faltering on his feet and Dean pauses with him, one arm still looped around Castiel’s waist to keep him vertical. Castiel also realises that one of his arms has found its way around Dean’s shoulder. Dean’s essentially carrying him out the bar. It’s nice. It feels nice to be taken care of like this, especially after being alone and miserable for so long.
“Did you not catch the puberty thing? You’ve been casually checking out his ass since we were fourteen.”
Cas snorts. “I’m sure you’ll come up with something worse someday. I’ll probably go along with that too.”
“Not as much as saying it myself.” It’s quiet and, not exactly uncomfortable, but Dean feels nauseous until Cas comes up with, “I’m pretty sure felt writing instruments are more permanent than paint anyways. Paint chips.”
“I’ve been thinking about this for awhile…I think I’m going to build a greenhouse for him, y’know. Someday when we get a place bigger than what we have now. Maybe behind our house—”
“I’ve seen you make out with a few girls, kissed your brother on the cheek, roughhoused with Benny, and cuddle with Rowena on occasion, Dean, but I have
“I said fucking get out then!” erupts John, jarring a half-woken Sam fully conscious. Cas clutches him tighter to his chest while he buries his head in the crook of Cas’ shoulder.
“Hey,” she chirps, smiling at him sweetly, “and...Cas. Hey,” her voice drops an octave as she addresses his best friend. So does her smile. She does this a lot. It’s one of the few reasons Dean has identified as to why she never clicked.
It’s of his own masochism that he is driven forward to corner Bobby as they dispense with goodbyes and congratulations and promises to meet up again soon.
“I’d share anything with you, Dean,” Cas says seriously, and they’re back to that impassioned piece of deep staring, the cheesy-ass Hallmark shit Sam doesn’t shut up about. Dean gets it now. There’s something very intimate about the way Cas looks at him, and in the way that Dean looks back until it gets too weird and he can’t anymore.
As soon as the bathroom door clicks shut, Dean is up and scouring through the chest of drawers, haphazardly hurling random articles of clothing into an old rucksack.
The sound of clattering objects and crashing furniture accompanied by Dean cursing loudly jostles Cas into action.
Cas sighs. “We are okay, Dean. We both just need some time apart, to think about what we want and who we are, because you’re right. We’re going in circles.”
“You’re probably not going to remember this so I’ll try to say it again when—if I can, but Cas, I’m—” Dean faces him with a fond but sorrowful expression. “I’m so sorry, Cas. For everything I’ve said, everything I’ve not. For not being even being nice to you. Fuck. It shouldn’t be this hard to not be a dick. I’m so fucking sorry. I know I don’t deserve you—and something else I know now, Cas, is that I…shit…you know, I—”
Cas morphs his expression into an amused one to lighten the mood for his friend who doesn’t appear ready to take another hit right now. Cas isn’t entirely sure what Dean is upset about—perhaps the fact that he enjoyed their kiss isn’t particularly welcoming—but Cas is sure he can wheedle the specifics out of Dean as always with some light humor.
Cas also remembers having bitten his lip very hard at this point, and yet, the words he knew were better left unspoken had spilled out anyways. “You’ll always have me.”
Dean does a demented movement with his hand that was supposed to be a wave and ushers Cas along at sonic speed.
“Cas,” Dean intones, and God, Chuck, whatever, it feels so good to say Cas’ name again, “I’m listening now.”
They’re making out like horny virgins against a wall when they hear a soft and surprised little, “oh.”
“No—well, yes, I believe I am allowed to feel my feelings too, but I also shouldn’t let that be turned into acidity against you.”
Dean’s about to tell him to forget it, then crawl into hole and hopefully die, but then Cas finally breaks out of his frozen shell and gestures towards the bathroom.
Castiel thinks maybe the alcohol has clogged up too much of his brain and time feels like it’s slowed, but then, no, Dean really is just sitting in the driver’s seat beside him, staring out the window. He’s not moving or putting the keys in the ignition or his foot on the pedal or driving or—
He can’t even resent her. She is kind, intelligent, beautiful, and more understanding of their intimate friendship than any girl Dean has casually dated in the past.
. I’m—I’m getting another drink at the bar. Either get Benny to drive you home or…” Dean sneers at nobody in particular, avoiding Cas’ imploring eyes. “Or get a ride home to Meg’s, I guess. Have fun.”
“You’re certifiably insane,” Cas hums from behind a gargantuan hardback that covers his entire head. Dean knows his expression is probably a scene of disinterest.
When he squeezes, Dean looks up to see careful blue eyes gauging him with the same cautious adoration Cas has always offered him.
This one is a little less fluff, a teensy more emotional, but I think we needed (well, I needed) it.
“Because I asked him to,” Castiel replies evenly. Dean didn’t even realise he’s talking aloud. God, he’s so drunk.
“Where are you going with that four-pack?” Sam asks, not even trying to hide the growing censure, the fading pleasantry.
“Not bad for a virgin,” April smirks up at him. Cas rolls his eyes at her fondly, then nuzzles the tip of his nose to hers which elicits a giggle.
Cas chuckles. “Yes, I suppose we do. You don’t generally speak so honestly to me unless one of us can forget the next day.”
He reckons they’re not going to talk about it either—about their kiss or how it went a little too far for practice or how Cas seemed to enjoy it when Dean roamed down his body and stuck his tongue down his throat.
“Dean, I didn’t. I’m pretty sure I just talked to some people. I don’t know why you’re getting upset, especially when it’s not really any of your business who I—”
Cas peers down to where Dean’s face is buried and then at their joined hands. He thinks for him this is enough.
His arm barely feels attached to his body anymore when it’s looped around Cas, and he’s being hauled upwards then forwards. They’re going to his room, he supposes.
“Alright, lets—lets go then.” He takes Cas by the hand and feels his clamminess with a spark of curiosity. Maybe Cas is looking forward to this too. Maybe Cas feels it a bit too. He’s not examined it properly enough yet but Dean’s pretty sure he would very much soar with happiness if Cas was into him the same way he was into—
He realises he’s convulsing ever so slightly in panic, lips moving uselessly, when his brother touches his chest.
Dean’s unfazed. His jaw tenses, his eyes grow cold. “Thought you said you didn’t meet anyone. Thought you said, nobody you wanted to be with like that.”
, “I believe I warned you several times not to sleep with one of your employees, and especially not to involve yourself so much in her child’s life."
He first appears in the playground, shouting at some younger boys with another younger boy tucked under his wing like a baby bird. He comes off toughened, aggressive, but also wildly protective.
“Hey,” he murmurs as they turn a corner. Still no lit-up stores. They’re very unlikely, Dean knows, to find an open establishment at this day and time. Jesus.
“I enjoyed sex with April before she stabbed me and tried to kill me. Perhaps tonight will go better. Less stabbing, less attempted murder.”
—so he quickly squashes whatever weird feeling it was—definitely not butterflies—and returns to his original purpose.
“Now, I’m fully awake, asshole, you gotta entertain me,” Dean says with a shit-eating grin. It vanishes when a pillow smacks into his face, planting him straight onto his back.
They’re clutched together so tightly in distress with Sam wedged between them that they don’t notice the creak of the door.
It’s still gratifying. It’s still pretty damn marvellous actually. He can’t think of a time where his lips had ever grazed against stubble before, but it feels…good.
They’ve been this close perhaps a handful of times. Dean’s never felt allowed to watch for too long. He does now.
me?” Cas flips the sheets off himself so he can stand and approach his friend. “Dean, she accidentally poked my chest with a kitchen knife one time. We were making chicken alfredo.”
“Yeah,” he affirms, assertive and unwavering, “we sure did.” Then, to Castiel’s shocked face, he grins at him wolfishly.
They’re walking again—stumbling—in the outside now, where the wind cuts sharply and a trickle of rain is dripping down on them. It stays quiet except for the rain. In silence, Dean manoeuvres Castiel to lean against the side of the Impala’s trunk while he opens the passenger seat’s door. He carefully, too gently and carefully, helps Castiel into the seat and pulls the seatbelt around him. Castiel grumpily feels like he doesn’t deserve any of this kindness.
Dean puffs out a spurt of air. “Yeah. Right. He’s just caught us...doing what we were doing not even for show, but in the comfort of your bed. Even if we called it off now, he’s not going to believe that we’re still just friends.”
“Or you could also call me something akin to a sugared and mucilaginous nectar made of bees. I like bees.”
“Looks and sounds a bit like I’m very much your type right now, buddy,” he adds hoarsely, overcompensating by just a little.
It’s a brief, bitter thought. He winces at it and banishes the path of that kind of thinking as quickly as he can by following where Cas has scanned his eyes to.
“I’m trying to hold your fucking hands so I can say something nice to you. I just—I forget how happy you make me sometimes, y’know? I think I take it for granted.”
Cas can tell this confession is difficult for Dean and he resents himself for how he feels only bitterness instead of appreciation in this moment.
Cas eyes peek open and the way he beams at Dean makes him forget why he’s not ever done that before. Why he was hesitant to do it in the first place.
Dean’s smacked straight back into what he’d forgotten for five minutes this morning. Their stupid lie. It’s slowly derailing Dean. He’s got a fair guess as to why he’s secretly looking forward to all they’re going to get to do to pretend that they’re together.
He probably should have just let Cas go if he’d wanted to go, because having him gone couldn’t be any worse than having him here but...gone.
“You tell me. You really mean to tell me this doesn’t—that you don’t feel anything after that?” he cajoles with his forehead falling to rest against Cas’.
John’s sniggers resounds off their backs as they hurry outside into the bitter cold. Sam is set down, eleven and already too gangly and heavy for Cas to carry all the way to the car.
“Not with that morning breath,” Cas retorts, then kicks him once in the groin. Light enough not to hurt but with enough pressure for Dean to wince. Not from pain. It’s, decidedly, from how his stomach flutters now when Cas comes near his crotch.
“We’ll stay in touch? Maybe you can still hang out with Ben and I some time, bring...Cas?” She smiles now, a lot more warmly at Cas than she ever has.
“Don’t you feel better?” Cas hums from the peaceful cocoon he’s made for himself in bed, eyes already fastened shut and smirking like he’s won the Pulitzer prize for an advice column.
As he dresses, slowly and painfully, he grumbles a few more times and wracks his brain for any more embarrassing or life-ruining events that may have transpired last night. He’s surmised as much that Dean had likely carried him into bed, unclothed him, and tucked him under some sheets. Folded a towel for him. Looked after him.
Cas smiles, and even though it’s the clipped one he offers people out of civility, Dean thinks for a second that this is it, they’re going to move back towards whatever normalcy they held onto before.
“Or you know,” Dean quickly interjects. “I’ve gotten pretty used to not being alone in bed. It’s...nice. You could still—if you want—”
Dean focuses his eyes ahead of the unmoving road and squints, struck soundless, too overwhelmed by this scene to react in proper time and action.
Dean rolls his eyes again. “Who the fuck where’s cardigans, Cas?” He doesn’t wait for a reply, already heading down the steps and waving a hand in the air dismissively. “I’ll get you a damn cardigan. Sammy probably keeps one, girly as he is. Or I’ll just get you Eileen’s.” Dean snorts laughter to himself and Castiel huffs, crosses his arms, and waits by the door impatiently, tapping his foot.
They’d been standing as they shouted at each other. It’s been horrible. Now, Dean falls against a wall to help keep him upright.
“Y’know, you’re real easy to talk to, blue eyes. Maybe ‘cause I’m still not one hundred percent on whether you’re actually a person,” he jokes with a smirk. Castiel scowls back at him, but it’s only half-hearted because there’s no cruelty behind his twinkling eyes. He’s looking at Castiel like Castiel is a sky full of stars, with wonder and curiosity and admiration. No one’s really ever looked at him like that before.
Cas stares out the window, thinking of one person he wishes he deserved. Clearly, the universe disagreed otherwise he would be in a different body or Dean would be open to the idea of men. He rebukes himself for the thought immediately because what he has with Dean is already more than friendship. It’s profound. Cas is lucky that Dean offers him so much of himself to Cas as it is.
So yeah, I guess I did turn one chapter into 3 long ones and dragged out the angst far more than necessary. Does it help if I say sorry? Probably not.
Cas is an extremely good liar, it turns out. The look of utter adoration he’s receiving is what Dean knows he’ll drown in for days. Maybe the rest of his life.
“I can’t believe I’ve let this conversation fester for so long. It’s stupid, and outlandish, and, if I must say, a little fucked up and weird,” Cas grumbles behind the protective barrier of his hands. “Meg’s unwanted affections and an awkward breakup isn’t enough to warrant something so—so insane. I’d have to be insane to agree.”
He’s not about to pipe up with ‘hey buddy, sharing a bed with you almost naked does funny things to my tummy now that I think I like you romantic-style’ just to ease Cas’ puzzlement.
Cas’ teeth scrape his bottom lip. Dean thinks he draws a little blood on his own mouth by pressing back harder. There’s still crashing and screaming and a cosmic entity eating another in the background and it’s pretty much exactly how Dean pictured his first kiss with Castiel, disgraced Angel of Thursday.
Thank you for anyone that takes the time to read and comment. I appreciate all feedback or even just any general support group complaining we got going on 😂
not your charity case, alright? Stop being so fucking nice and calm and logical and—can you just be human for a fucking sec? Can you try to at least pretend like you’re real—and not this—this caricature of some fucking guardian angel? Your whole flawless schtick is really getting old, man.”
“What happened,” Dean spits, “is I went to text Sam on your phone and it seems like you did meet someone after all. Good time last night, I bet.”
He thinks of how nice it would be to lay in bed and watch a movie with Cas. How nice everything with Cas is when they're not fighting.
“I’m emotionally illiterate too,” Dean proclaims numbly as he watches Cas’ back disappear beneath the shirt he dons.
“I guess not,” he quickly says. “I guess a diner’s a shit place for a first date.” He feels all sorts of stupid and ridiculous, acting like a jealous teenage boy over some harmless flirtation that Cas didn’t even actually respond to.
Cas thinks this is a good time to actually go to the bathroom now so he can retch up every inch of his mortification.
“You’re not going to keep that suit and tie and trench coat on for the supermarket?” Dean asks jovially, leaning on the counter and giving Castiel a goading grin.
He claps his hands together. “Okay. Now let’s go act like dumbasses that thought this was a good idea for a prank and never speak about it again. I’ll figure out the Lisa thing another way and the Meg thing...we’ll do that together too. Sound good?”
“Oh, please. I’ve woken up with you poking into my ass enough times to care more about you finishing my oatmeal.” Cas rolls off Dean then jabs a finger at his morning wood teasingly. Dean squeals like a little piglet and scrambles away so his back is to the wall.
—and that’s saying a lot, Dean, considering all the bullshit you’ve pulled over the years—this is the
“Sorry about what?” Dean snipes, already hooking his arm with Cas’ and ushering them off the couch and towards the direction of their room. “We’re gonna grab our coats and we’re gonna go for a drive to get some paint. Exciting adventures. Better than hunting monsters! Hunting for paint on Christmas Eve, awesome,” he cries with theatrical joy.
“Eileen’s gone to see her hunter friend for a couple of days. Helping out on a case. I should have just gone with her. I miss her.”
“Not your vessel, man, you,” Dean says, getting Cas’ attention away from his annoyed observation over his knees. “Jimmy’s long gone. It’s just you in there. Your body is you. Sometimes it sucks, but there’s good things you’ll feel now too. Food, and um—you know—” Dean wonders why it’s starting to feel weird to talk about sex with Cas.
“Well, fucking fine. Not like I give a shit anyway,” Dean snaps, returning determinedly to his indignant prowl, back to his shitty solace, back to his room.
“I’m here to take you home,” Dean murmurs next to his ear. Castiel smiles, and he’s sure it’s a goofy one because he’s too drunk to care. He’s too inebriated to quell his desire to be near Dean.
“I said crêpe,” he enunciates with more force this time, face flushing with frustration. It lets Dean know he’s starting to get to him.
Castiel makes another irritated sound as he lifts himself up from the booth to sit upright. “Dean. I was talking about Dean. Dean isn’t—”
It feels like that but if the butterflies had razors for wings. It feels like jubilation but also alarm because now that he has the human he loves wrapped around him, he could also lose him at any moment.
“I work here,” Sam repeats, his eyes flickering between the two of them with bemusement. “Are you guys here to fight or make out or—? Is this another bit? Like, are you doing a Brüno thing? Why are you—I don’t really get it.”
She heaves a breath that looked heavy inside. “Okay. I...I believe you. Thank you for telling me first.” She grins at Dean. “We had a good run, didn’t we?”
Dean wonders whether his soul burned to Cas as brightly as the blue of Cas’ eyes and the fullness of his lips and the gumminess of his big grins and the comfort of his embrace and—
“Benny. I’ve gotta tell you something, man.” Dean feels like he’s flying blind and he balls his free hand into a fist against his thigh to ground himself. He can hear the terror in his own voice, fracturing like splinters into the air.
Dean bounds up like a puppy hearing ‘park’ and ‘walk’, almost runs into Cas in his haste. They exchange brief awkward glimpses while they brush their teeth beside each other, glancing away with mortification each time they catch each other’s eyes. Dean notices with eager pleasure that Cas finishes brushing his teeth in two minutes instead of his typically required routine of four. He’s too giddy to unpack and overthink what that means about Cas’ own keenness.
“If it’s any consolation, Sam, Dean only realised it himself not too long ago. There was nothing to support or say before.”
Castiel sighs dramatically. “I suppose I’ll take some pie so you can stop being so stubborn and not die of hypothermia. Why is this even necessary of me? How did the teachers not intervene?” he grumbles the complaints mostly to himself with indignation.
For a brief fragment of a second, before his cerebral functions can catch up to this moment, Cas thinks he’s uttered these unspeakable words out loud himself.
“I don’t think I’ve told you as an adult how—um—great your eyes are,” he finds himself murmuring, unbidden. “I can’t believe I once said they looked like a dog’s.”
“Well, you’re going to have to get used to it,” says Cas, as casually as he can muster. “I’m watching movies at her place on Friday too.”
“I’m not better than anything,” Dean says, annoyed, “and, I had, like, three beers, maximum. It takes a hell lot more than that to take a tank like me anywhere close to tipsy.” As if cosmic intervention had it out for him—which just about explains everything over the past forty or so years—he misses a step down the stairs and almost plants head-first into the grimy floorboard.
“Well, obviously, I’m gonna be the one that does it,” Dean responds, huffing, “now where do we keep the paint here?”
“I know what it means,” Dean replies, “it means he doesn’t like it so much when I do shit like this—”
She shouts after him like some wanton journalist, hungry for gossip. “You’re not even going to deny it, Dean?”
Sam reaches something close to stability first. “Dean,” he says, one gigantic hand covering the side of his mouth as his shoulders shake. “It’s because Castiel is not a…very common name.”
“You don’t have to do that, man,” Sam intervenes, hip-checking Cas out the way. “You guys go get ready for the day. I’ve got this.”
She releases their hands and wipes a stray tear away. “Okay. Phew. That was a surprisingly short conclusion. I really thought I’d be a lot more immature about this when it finally happened. I’m sorry I never talked to you about this, Dean, never supported you, but well—shit, I’m sorry. I’ll see you both around.” She rushes away before Dean or Cas can say anything, before Dean can even tell her not to be sorry, that
“Dean!” he whispers harshly at Dean’s side, gripping his best friend by the shoulders. One hand inches up his neck and moves to capture his jaw. It calms his breathing in twelve seconds.
“Alright, when did this become an intervention?” he snaps, annoyed but barely invested in said annoyance because a lot of other concerns are spinning in the whirlpool of his brain.
Without forethought or due consideration, he clutches Meg by her elbow and steers her into a disabled toilet. It was a surprisingly seamless spin.
Their eyes still interlock, and something passes between them, something that feels like a promise of ‘later.’ A look, uncomplicated and in sync, much like the ones passed between Sam and Eileen that Dean had been so envious of.
Cas was right. Shit. Awkward. Fucked up. So, so, so weird. Nothing between them has ever been weird. It wasn’t even weird when they slobbered each other’s faces right after they got married and then pretended to hump each other on the altar. They’ve shared beds, they’ve seen each other naked in locker rooms, they’ve kissed each other’s cheeks and held hands and danced together ridiculously and made jokes about having sex with each other and why is this suddenly weird? Why is Dean’s heart pattering hard against his chest and his vision is blurring and his breath is—
“Yeah?” Dean mimics Cas with a tip of his own head to the side, hoping he accomplishes at least a shard of the cuteness that it adorns Cas with. “You happy to stay my boyfriend for a bit then, hot stuff?”
After his outburst, Cas waited for Dean to respond with anything but an open-mouthed stare. He remained there for a few seconds before storming out, only to be found by the Impala in the parking lot, leaning against it, cross-armed. Dean couldn’t think of anything to say and clearly Cas hadn’t either, because they had both gotten in and maintained an oath of silence up until now.
“Like they own the place,” repeats Dean, rolling his eyes. He claps Cas on the shoulder, startling him into a posture that’s straighter than a post. “Come on, let’s get in the shower.”
It’s a perky young brunette waitress that serves them—she has a fringe, looks a little bit like Hannah had in her first vessel, with the blue eyes and the slim figure.
“I burned the pot, not the kitchen,” Cas retorts, “and at least I‘ve been stocking our fridge up with more than three items per monthly. I also am an excellent cook now that I have practiced,” he sniffs.
“You alright there, Sammy?” Dean asks tentatively, squeezing Cas’ hand once before letting it go. He moves to sit by his brother.
“We’ll make it through together,” Dean assures them both, voice quavering but determined, “we’re going to get through this, and I’m going to get through this, and I’m going to—to heal myself this time. No more angel mojo. No more crutches. You can’t heal me this time ‘round, so can you just—er—stick around, you know, while I try to myself?”
They’re already halfway to the Impala when Dean curses at his phone and frustratedly shoves it back into his pocket.
The pressure on his chest increases. Dean almost cries in displeasure, maybe he does, when Cas parts their lips with a loud, wet smack and lifts Dean off him.
Like that, Dean convulses into howling laughter and it makes his head throb a little stronger but it’s worth it because of the absolute look of betrayal and menace on Cas’ face.
Castiel raises a fist to his mouth and tries not to vomit as he lurches forward with another wave of nausea.
It hadn’t been until the whiskey got them tipsy enough to quash discomforts that they started snickering over nonsense and musing on Sam’s bachelor party.
But third? Yes, third. Third would be here, right now, with Death ‘Here’s Johnny’ through the door, the Empty coming for his best friend who has tears streaming down his stubbled cheek as if this is the Big Goodbye.
For all their falsified detective work, the investigative hunting, the constant vigilance against a world full or horrors and hazard, Sam Winchester is really an unobservant little shit today.
“I saw how nervous you two were coming in here. I understand it wasn’t...an easy thing to do, telling me, admitting it to yourselves. Can I just ask if...” Lisa finally starts to match the level of discomfort Dean and Cas are both feeling now, “if you two ever...? Behind my back? While Dean and I...”
He exhales slowly, eyes drooping again, and he fights it by blinking rapidly. He wants to keep looking at Dean up-close like this. He’s so close. Castiel is so close he can count Dean’s freckles. Unbidden, his hand drifts up and they trace the sprinkle of little hazel patches on Dean’s cheeks.
“Jesus, fuck!” Dean’s coffee topples over its rim as he jumps about a foot. His hand had flown to fumble for his gun in his surprise before he realised he was only in a t-shirt, flannel pants, and a bathrobe. “What the fuck did I say about doing that? I could have shot you!” he shouts.
“Dean, are you okay? You look like—I don’t know—there’s a bloody handprint on your jacket, by the way. That doesn’t seem good either...”
He waits as patiently as he can for them to calm down, tapping his foot aggressively on the bunker’s living room floor. “Well?”
“Relax. I know you’re not interested. It’s called harmless flirting.” She leers at him. “Where’s your other half?”
Apoidea, fine, boys can like bumblebees and honeybees because at least they fall under insects. Insects are cool. Astronomy, also fine,
Cas has the window rolled down and Dean has to snap at him to not stick his head out like some fucking dog, to remind him that he’s human now and he could get decapitated or some shit if a truck were to drive by really fast.
Lisa picks up on it, of course. She was always very smart, and pretty, and bendy, and— “Something going on? I think you’ve only been here twice since we’ve met, Dean...and Cas, I don’t think you’ve ever—”
She shakes her head and plucks a Christmas cookie from the tin of goods Cas had prepared for them this morning. Dean loves the fact that he bakes.
“Lis, look, I’m sorry—“ Dean starts before he’s interrupted by her launching herself at him. She’s hugging him.
Cas cheeks flush with a fury ready to burn a thousand suns. Dean is so relieved that once his mouth opens, preparing to unleash a wicked rampage, his brother approaches them to interrupt.
“I thought you were going out for beers after the job. I don’t have anything planned for us, I’m afraid. Although I must say it’s a nice surprise to see you.”
He proceeds to chew at his burger and fries ravenously, attacking it angrily like it had done something to him in his past life. Cas sits opposite him quietly, peacefully, sipping occasionally at his milkshake and humming to himself with pleasure each time.
The boy combs a hand through his dark hazel-blonde hair. “Well, you should always say what’s in your head.”
He squints so infinitesimally that if Dean had blinked, he would have missed that micro-expression of unbridled confusion.
Dean smiles sleepily, burrowing his face into Cas’ chaos of hair and indulging in a long-drawn inhale.
“Why the hell do you own safety goggles?” Dean asks. “Wait, don’t answer that. I don’t want to hear it if it’s something kinky.”
Castiel chuckles, shaking his head. “Not much, I’m afraid. I suppose I may have made quite a fool of myself. I do apologise if I…overstepped with you in any way. You shouldn’t have had to come pick me up like that. It was irresponsible of me.”
“Do you want me to make you a pot? We have a teapot somewhere, but I’m sure we can make it into a cocoapot, heh.”
What he does is drink a bit more, then trip and totter into the War Room where he’ll be able to see Cas as soon as he comes down the staircase.
“Hey jerk, you owe me a drink.” Sam points, blurry-eyed, at the space in front of him. “Cas, Eileen wants a Strawberry Woo-woo.”
Dean watches as Sam’s mouth parts slightly and his cheeks brighten in colour and he nods—with poorly concealed subtlety—at Eileen. Sam then turns to Dean with a look that resembles a moose caught in headlights.
Dean’s breathing goes choppy and uneven. “Contrary to popular belief, I do think about things other than Cas you know.” It’s not a lie but it feels like one under this context.
He tugs on the end strands of his hair. The shallow, artificial pain does nothing to numb his horror.
Dean’s looking at him with furrowed brows and Castiel wants to puff a breath and blow away all the hurt that Dean keeps inside, the ones that sometimes creeps onto his face with a sullen glower. He wishes he could heal the inside of Dean the same way he could—or used to—heal the broken arms and busted legs.
“Cas, we’re not here to watch a movie,” she sniggers then takes his hand into hers, practically dragging him towards her bedroom.
Dean also almost vomits right there and then from the emotional gut punch—or maybe it’s the alcohol. Probably both.
“Nah, man. It’s fine. The amount of times Sam’s had to carry me home from a bar is just…ridiculous. It’s almost a Winchester rite of passage. No big deal.”
“You aren’t,” Cas insists as he returns to his side of the bed and yanks Dean’s socks onto his own feet forcefully. “You’re just a warm body, that’s all.”
“So,” Dean starts as he sits opposite Castiel, and for some reason he’s shifted from easy-going movements to stiffness, “you were pretty drunk, huh? How much do you remember of…last night?”
Dean has taken up wearing more than a pair of boxers to bed, initially to Cas’ confusion and mild surprise. His refusal to offer an explanation only stresses the crinkle on Cas’ forehead every night that he pulls on a newly purchased set of sleepwear.
“Aw, Cas, I love it when you tell the story of how we met,” Dean lilts in a sing-song voice and tilts forward to bend his forearms onto Cas’ knees. He widens his eyes just a smidge and blinks up adoringly at a wry-looking Cas. “You offering me the fleece off your back at such a tender age of eleven, me being nice enough to later welcome you into my awesome clique even though you were a massive weird nerd—”
“We made a deal,” the dark sludge hisses and it sounds like it’s reverberating from every wall in the room.
“We’ve taken the day off for tomorrow,” Eileen explains rationally with a composure Sam sincerely lacks at the moment, “it’s been awhile since we’ve had a fun night out, so we thought—”
Was this chapter angsty? I can’t tell anymore. Dean and Cas’ fight to me is not even a blip on their friendship because they always seem to bounce back 😌
“Neither. If you aren’t staying at Bobby’s tonight, we’re finding another motel as I previously suggested.”
Cas, for his part, looks about as stunned as Dean feels over what he’s managed to express. He, likely as much as Dean, plausibly anticipated a much colder and detached parting. Like last time.
Castiel contemplates backing out the room, coming up with a quick excuse to retreat to somewhere where Dean isn’t there, but he’s being peered at with such warmth that makes it impossible for him to leave.
Cas has no time to compose his defence. Dean launches on top of him quicker than hell could scorch a feather. They fumble about, laughing, until Cas loses momentum first and his back hits the bottom of their seat.
“No, dumbass. I just need to clear my head. You’ve given me far too much to process here.” As Dean glumly unlocks his passenger’s door, Benny sighs. “Jesus, Dean. Do you remember I once warned you that you and Cas are one day going to spiral straight into something fantastically stupid? This is it. How did you think this was a good idea?”
He considers just sleeping here, no sense risking an awkward bump-in with Cas as he navigates the hallway towards his room. The issue is moot when after a few more minutes of drinking and pondering, Cas enters the room.
“Yeah, welcome to your forties,” Dean scoffs, trying to not think about Cas being tired, and hungry, and aching, and human. “You’re looking a little grey there too, buddy,” he says, waving at his own hair and jerking his chin at Cas, making light of it, making this easier somehow.
When Cas is back, Dean is drunk enough to be unashamedly waiting for him by the door like a spurned housewife.
“Dean didn’t want to ask her not to bring Ben. It would have...incensed the issue before he managed to speak with her. He has a good reason, Sam, I promise. We’ll fill you in at dinner tonight,” Cas explains this like a professional actor with careless ease. So far, Dean has only managed to bumble uselessly about like a newborn guppy.
“Isn’t growing old with Cas a far more preferable option to you than settling down with the most perfect woman in the world?”
“You’re so astute,” Cas comments dryly, picking up his crumpled top from the floor and slipping it on. Dean’s eyes were trained too tightly on his bare chest for him to feel comfortable.
“We’re both dumbasses. That’s what makes us so great together!” Dean kicks lightly at Cas’ shoe with his own. “Hey. Can we just—you know you’re the best thing in my life after Sammy. You know I think you’re—that I’d be...well, lost without you. I think a hell many things about you but this is already getting too chick flick moment-y so let’s...you know...forgive dumbass Dean? For all of this?”
“Why are you here?” he asks, swaying side to side from his sitting position. The bar is spinning again and he clenches his hands on the table’s edge to steady himself.
“No—I—now. Wanna talk now. I don’t believe you. You’re not over it.” Dean’s getting really close to the angel now, so close and falling over his feet so much that Castiel—Cas has his arms outstretched, ready to catch Dean. Dean considers lurching forward on purpose.
He drinks the four-pack in under an hour. He listens to his music loudly, like a bratty pre-teen who’s been told they’re not allowed to throw a party.
Dean smirks, springs upwards in the direction of Cas —who to his credit only widens his eyes slightly in surprise before a body is launched at him— and tackles him to the floor.
Now, when they do this, only very occasionally, perhaps once or twice a year, it’s Cas and his much better physique that often overpowers Dean. He blames the taken-for-granted years of burgers and pies and milkshakes for letting him down next to Cas’ steady, sensible, boring diet.
“Don’t be so crude,” Castiel admonishes, starting to regret his impalpable interest in this green-eyed mud monkey.
“May I enquire as to why you are both...extremely inebriated, considering you two have work tomorrow and as far as I remember, there are no special occasions or something to mourn?”
The boy laughs at him with a mouth full of what looks like cherry pie, crumbs and morsels of jam spewing everywhere. “You’re so fun to fuck with.”
The information doesn’t move through Dean initially. He sits there, frowns, and then feels his lungs give out when the empty human-less landscape punctures him. His mind does a rerun of everyone they’ve lost and everything goes to black as tears prick his eyes.
“It’s my angry voice.” Sam starts dramatically pouting at them both, then blows a raspberry at Dean and then Cas.
“You’re overreacting,” Dean mutters as Cas ignores him and goes to dry his wet hand with a dish towel in an oddly sweet gesture. A cool substance is then rubbed onto his fingertips. His heartbeat stutters at the gentle contact as well as the sentiment behind the action.
“Damn, you’re good.” The boy chuckles throatily, an older chuckle that belongs to someone much older than eleven. “Doesn’t mean I have to answer.”
He’s gazing like a lovesick fool at Cas’ hands, up to his elfin ears, a little too small for his head, the wrinkles that are coming in with the grey hairs, the shoulders, the jaw, his stubble, his downcast eyes.
Castiel nods complacently, placing his rejected apple into a ziplock bag. “Have you just moved here? I’ve never seen you in class.”
“Christ almighty, why is this any of your business? Why are you even here? We were meeting at Bobby’s tonight.”
Dean and Cas’ wild scramble of word babble overlap one another’s and only comes to a halt when Jack’s head stops swivelling between them both.
He remembers it spilling because he had pulled too hard, too angrily, too spitefully, irked by Dean ruining their merry bubble with a preposterous and cruel idea. He had forgotten that it isn’t as if Dean
“I partook in one date. Not dating. It’s one evening where the partner I shared my meal with didn’t throw spiteful remarks at me and look at me with resentment.”
“You’re a fucking child,” Dean retorts, jumping on top of Cas, leg on either side, as he pretends to smother him with a pillow. Cas flails while Dean snickers his amusement. They end up rolling off onto the floor together with Dean pinned under Cas by his wrists.
“I thought you two were already together,” Ash comments, casual and disinterested around his mouthful of pie crust.
He’s holding a guy’s hand. He’s fully made out with a guy—practically crawled into his lap like some wanton girl.
Not only that way—though he’s starting to allow himself to want that more fully too—but what he wants most is the friendship back, the mutual affection, and their selfless vows to one another. He wants everything their bond was as well as any more intimacies he can share with Cas.
The more he leans into their friendly flirtations, the easier it becomes to just be in this friendship. It eases his desires by wearing him thinner each day. He embraces the inconceivability of it. He embraces the contentment it brings him when their fruitless flirtations snuff out the flames of a hopeless want.
“As they say, slow and stable motions do end up triumphing in running competitions,” Cas says airily, falling back to the couch with closed eyes again.
“So,” Dean continues, just as Cas is about to turn and leave, “did you fuck ‘em too? Getting around these days, Cas, I gotta say.”
Castiel groans for the fourth time. This, he doesn’t remember at all. He’s not even entirely sure if it was a woman or a man that he’d made acquaintance with, and had apparently given out his number so carelessly. Was it that man that helped him after he threw up? That waitress? No, they thought Dean was his boyfriend, not his ex-partner. Someone from earlier on in the night perhaps, where he drunk enough to talk about Dean, drunk enough to talk to a stranger, but not enough to vomit and solicit help from strangers just yet.
She is far too chipper for a girl whose boyfriend has brought a plus one to their date. He had asked her ahead of time, of course, and was indeed surprised to find no pushback on the proposition. With growing apprehension, he and Dean follow her past the living room up the stairs.
“We started all of this so I would have a good excuse to break up with Lisa. Meg staving off Cas was also a good bonus. It just—it just spiralled. It’s all pretend.”
“That’s why you’re borrowing Sam’s clothes? You’re going out? Out where?” He realises he’s starting to sound like a nagging wife but he can’t seem to stop himself.
Dean sulks, eyes fixed on the road ahead of him. His jaw twitches. “We can—we can turn around. I—I didn’t mean to—”
“No,” Dean laughs before Cas can reply. “Don’t answer that. I know the answer. I’ve been kicking at you like some evil son of a bitch with a puppy. You’re cuter than a fucking puppy and I’ve just been—you’re a fucking angel. You shouldn’t be hanging around people like me, never mind letting yourself get…get abused like this. Just—drop me here. On the floor. Here. I don’t deserve a goddamn bed."
Dean’s heart is hovering somewhere near his navel and Cas is still hovering somewhere near his face still. He surges forward and captures his lips in another tender but brief kiss, before releasing his friend and falling backwards.
Thank you to my wonderful beta and friend @Seralina 🥺 This update would have likely taken months to post if it wasn’t for her. You’re the best gal anyone can dream of
“No, I—I didn’t mean—sorry. I meant to say—um—yeah.” He exhales in the same second as an involuntary smile emerges and a pulse of butterflies flutter against the cavities of his chest.
Cas scants his head, his smile widening. “I’ll make you something that requires no mushrooms or chicken or pasta.”
“No, it doesn’t!” Dean shouts and immediately blanches. His mouth works itself open and shut on override while his thoughts tumble over one another in panic. “I mean yes—not—I don’t—no comment!”
“Didn’t realize it’d be so cold. I’m eleven, dude. I don’t really know how to take care of myself. My baby bro, I’m awesome in that department. Myself, not so much.”
Sam returns some time in the evening, arms overflowing with bags of food and clothes and more things than any human woman Eileen’s size would need. Dean’s nursing his fifth or sixth beer. When their eyes catch, they both make disapproving faces at each other.
While Dean fondly twines his fingers with Cas’, Sam glares at Eileen’s lowered head as she nibbles on her cookie silently. Wen she glances back up, she offers him an impish look that makes his body sag because—yeah, Dean knows that feeling—Sammy’s already given up on the pretence of being mad at her.
“I think this is just a shitty situation,” Dean continues with a tired exhale. He also slumps forwards. “It’s not easy for me, or for you, and I get—I get why you can’t help but be annoyed with me. I’m a pretty shitty person, with a pretty shitty temper. You’ve not said or done anything to me that amounts to even half of what I have to you, so don’t you dare be the one to start apologising.”
“In case one gets dirty or another gets wet. I didn’t realise until Mr. Henriksen told me this morning that I wasn’t going to be allowed on the waterfalls.”
Then he goes ahead and orders for them both like they’re a fucking couple—two double cheeseburgers with fries, and a slice of pie, with a chocolate milkshake.
He left his cereal bowl, Dean thinks numbly, then asks Cas without thinking or looking at him, “you’re still talking to that guy?”
“You’re still here,” Sam says with some relief, getting closer to Cas and engulfing him into a hug. His hand pats Cas a couple times on the back before he releases him. Dean notices with some trouble that Sam’s hugs are a little different to Dean’s when it comes to Castiel, angel of the Lord. It’s very much less like he’s clutching on to oxygen, for breath, for life.
“Either he’d climb through the window when you were kids or you’d be missing from your bed at night,” Bobby tacks on. “Just because I didn’t stop it when it was in my house doesn’t mean I didn’t notice.”
