“Yeah, lucky I answered so Sam didn’t get the call, too.  They said there wasn’t anything on the video, but there was some kinda noise.  You want me to go check it out?”
Dean looked off towards the ancient computer cabinets that lined the room with a thin lipped scowl.  Without having to look his brother in the face he flexed his jaw back and forth clearly tossing details of that night into bins marked ‘brother safe thoughts’ and ‘Cas Erotica’. There were far more jaw hinges left than right.

That afternoon was the moment of truth for Dean.   With a coordinated effort by the brothers and a certain redhead who still ached with guilt over not having caught the issue earlier; the small family eased the little blonde into her new home.
“So you’re cleared to come back or…” he asked finishing off the glass nervously.
The man shook his head and whimpered drool onto the plastic counter mat.
“Maybe so,” he flipped a pencil up and down seemingly poised to toss it at a target across the room at a moment’s notice.  “Aside from cleaning up after that nightmarish mob debacle, have you rousted up anything juicy for us to investigate?”
The levity fell out of his tone, but he kept trying to keep it light by smiling.  If he stopped, he worried he wouldn’t smile again the rest of the evening.  “The scumbag didn’t wear a condom when they had sex the week before.  She didn’t figure it out until the morning after.  Needless to say, she spent the next week trying to find him and get some answers.  All she had was a first name and a physical description.  That time we stayed in contact well after the swelling went down.  She had a small second floor yoga studio out in Blue Hill.  I made a few trips out there when Bobby and I were at each other, ended up staying the night most of them.  A couple months in she found out she was pregnant.  She never stopped looking for that asshole, though; put feelers out in all directions.  We weren’t together, but as her belly grew and the terror or raising a child on her own settled into the cracks, I stepped up to help her.  She didn’t ask me to,” he said letting the smile slip.  “But when a friend needs help, they don’t need to say it out loud for you to send in the cavalry.  But Cas, the second she appeared in the world, Claire has been my guiding star, showing me what matters most.  And Lisa, she was so happy to meet her, loved her long before she held her against her chest for the first time.  For a little while, we were our own little unit.  Bobby didn’t agree, though.  In hindsight, I wasn’t there for Sam as much as I should have been after I met her.   His temper flared at the drop of a hat and Bobby was right to drag me back to Lebanon by my ear.  But he said I had more responsibility to Sammy than Lisa and her newborn.  While he was right, the words never came out right when I tried to explain why I had to help her.
Her eye grew wide in astonishment.  “When?”
His jaw opened and closed a couple of times like a startled goldfish.  He uselessly reached for anything to keep himself steady, but resorted to clinching his fists ready at his sides.  “Me?”
The recording of the noises on Dean’s voicemail indeed matched the sound of the rusty door opening, but that clearly wasn’t what excited Sam.  The case was far from closed, but how that energized Dean was still a mystery.  With shortened strides to follow lock step, he followed the rambling man until they stood at the peak of the stairs in the dark.
“People bring their beliefs with them. You bring me to your side with a whisper, so why couldn’t someone bring a god halfway across the world, too?”
--------------------------
Sam shook his finger mid-air.  “The house was in Easton, a handful of miles from White Creek.”
Her right eyebrow rose up, but she did not let the supposition carry on as impossible as it sounded.  “I’m suggesting you use your imagination, Agent.  I will treat his bumps and bruises, get him healthy enough to walk out the door, but what he did before he got here and what he does after he leaves is not within my purview.”  The smile on her face had all but rotted away, her patience worn paper thin.
===============
Not bothering to hide his dismay, he slumped back closing his arms over his knees and harrumphed at his own cowardice.  That could have been his only chance before their mission north and he fucked it up.  Why was it so hard to simply take his hand?  It was so close, and would probably be pleasantly warm in his.  The backside of it against his cheek and the callused slender fingers curled around his would make the beat of his heart as loud as a bass drum, bucking wildly without any hope of control.  Would he have any choice but to close his eyes and soak in the angel’s nearness?  His jaw rubbed against the soft shirt on his shoulder as he tilted his head up and thought of Cas returning the affectionate touch, running his thumb over his bottom lip begging to gain entry.  Being the solitary focus of that lengthy stare made his breath hitch in lungs as he wrapped his arms tighter around himself, holding in the frustrated sigh.  How long would he be forced to wait before he had another chance to release the flood of questions he held back?  At the next possible chance, he would drag him by the hand to a solitary corner, even if Sam as there to glower or laugh at him.  The very next opportunity…
“Okay, I get that the picture might be one I want to scrub from my brain, but maybe there was some inciting incident.  To help you both, I need to know every factor.  Walk me through the day up until the event.”
“Sorry to be a bother, Doctor.  I’m special agent Winchester with the FBI looking in on your silent John Doe.”
“Mother would have disagreed,” he said matter-of-factly.  “I asked the neighbor to give us a ride to school which wasn’t unusual.  Father was frequently ill, so they had an arrangement worked out.  A few days passed in a similar vein, and like one would expect the food ran out and all the calls to our parents went unanswered.  I did the best I could despite the circumstances, but the shampoo was up too high in the shower and the amount of laundry soap necessary for one load was its own enigma.  The phone started ringing off the hook at night, but it was never who we needed it to be on the other end.  Eventually, the school sent us home with a note on dark navy letterhead requesting our parents meet with the principal.  I placed it on my father’s desk in his study where he did most of his reading and waited, like I made him dinner and the school’s stern warnings about our new definition of personal hygiene were his call to come inside.  Getting no response to that was probably what sent the social worker.  I can still remember how the chilly it was that morning she first showed up at our doorstep.  She had a kindly face, a tamed smile, and confident voice.  A police officer sporting a scrambled sounding radio edged his way in the door right after her and whispered something in her ear.  Shortly after, she told us to round up everything we would need for a sleepover and we were placed with a family for a little while.  That same social worker checked in on us, and was ultimately the one who informed us we needed to be re-homed.  She never used the word ‘orphan’ but she didn’t need to.  As long as my brother and I had each other, we would cope.  The next day he was gone, too.”
“Frame Dean?”  He perked up angrily.  “What are you going on about?”
Dean rolled his eyes, trying to cover the smile his dork of a brother smeared across his face.
Fiery breaths fanned over the buried ink as he nuzzled in further.  Being held so close after months of longing and years of imagining what an accepting, inviting partner could be like suffused his core with a glow so intense he felt like a sappy lightning bug.  Feather light pecks against his rolling ribs shifted into light nips traveling north.  Each one ratcheted the coil of intimate need further into plain view.  The space and time between each nibble stretched out like the smile he was fighting on his lips, knowing the affect his lingering touches had on him.  “Dean,” he pleaded into the air, without knowing exactly how much he could plead for.  It was all so new and wonderful, and the lust ensnaring him from within could easily sway him into souring it.  “We should – Ah!” he choked as Dean wrapped his lips around his right nipple.  He laved the pebbling flesh around with his dexterous tongue and carefully teethed it into perkiness.  Castiel slid his hands under the shirt and motioned his intent to pull him off, but the view of his flushing date licking away at his responsive skin halted him in his tracks.  Those lovely deep green eyes full of unspoken need to please and consume all at once nailed every muscle in place.
A nimble warmth spread out from his beating heart as he soaked it all in.  He was just being protective, maybe a smidge overly cautious, if anything.
Dean didn’t register the moan escaping his lips until he felt the vibrating joy springing from his lungs and not from Cas’s.  There was no way he could will himself to care how easily swayed he was by him.  Delighted hums erupted in volcanic grunts as they clawed at each other, prying thin layers from the temples of the bodies they burned to worship.  They begged to adore him with fingers and tongues and heedless thrusting to a deafening lustful chorus.  He reached down to feel the leaking heft Cas insistently pressed into him.  Priding himself on the beautiful deep maple seeping across Cas’s cheeks, he gripped as much of him as he could with one hand and stroked him menacingly slow. “Cas… need you.”
Dean lifted his pointer finger to his bottom lip and stepped two paces closer.  “You’ve got a…”
Genuine surprise overcame him.  “They’re letting you stay with the Bureau?  How did Mills even know about any of this?”
An abrupt concussive impact shook the lower floor of the Bunker sending Dean bolting into his repurposed rec room where he guessed the collision originated.   As a painfully familiar head of dark hair came into view, his heart leapt into his throat from subbasement levels.  Cas reemerged from some space wrinkle in the recently all but forgotten hang out spot.   Tightened muscles in his chest unclenched, oblivious until that moment how much that subconscious reflex was draining him.   His family was that much closer to whole again.  The glee radiating off of him instantly dampened when Cas’s eyes bobbled about the room scouring every surface for anything familiar.  After calling out to him, Sam stopped him from even approaching.  Something was terribly amiss.  It smacked of the moment he first discovered Lucifer inhabited Cas.  This time despite the circumstances was not so dire, but an alien woody smell wafted off of his unfamiliar clothes.  He donned a strange heather band t-shirt under a fall jacket and relaxed jeans with holes worn at the knees.  A couple of braided leather bracelets adorned his wrist similar to the protective ones Dean habitually wore but Cas had never taken to previously wearing; something about being impractical and ineffective for an Angel of the Lord.  Cas’s hair was also noticeably longer, bangs falling over his forehead with a slight curl.  All the possibilities of his absence would exist in his mind only until he explained his whereabouts the past three weeks or his forty-one days.  What was that hesitance to he explain himself right away?  Was it too awful for him to comprehend?  Even worse than hell?
Cas slumped a fraction and turned his head down.  “I would prefer not to discuss it.  I don’t have satisfactory explanations.”
Cas pointed to him with wilting anxiety.
The giant hunched over with the square message trotted out of the court, keeping his eyes down towards the cement walkway leading onto the sidewalk on the opposite side of the fence.  If he was the first agent on the case, instead of a second fiddle observation team, he would have kept several paces behind him but traced down where that sheet of paper ultimately landed.
Desperate pleas for understanding drilled into him as Mick locked eyes with him again.  “You have to believe me.  I had no clue he was asking me to put innocent people in danger – police officers’ family members no less!  You know I couldn’t knowingly do that!  I put an end to it the second I knew his demands were so nefarious.  Please, Sam!” he rounded the obstruction between them and reached out for his hands like a child reaching for a familiar voice in the dark.
Dean’s bedroom light was still on, the door cracked open invitingly, he reclined with his arms crossed behind his head on top of his comforter absorbed in the music playing in a very similar set of headphones wearing down under Cas’s contemplative grasp.  Their calm conflicted gazes were similar in a way, but Cas stared down into the floor while Dean kept his eyes locked on the ceiling.
The brothers bicker.  Dean is stretched thin.  There are strange sounds on Dean's voicemail.
“You seem eager to get out of here early.”  She poked at his elbow.  “You planning on hitting up your ex for a few drinks?”
Moisture prickled at his lower lids that he instinctively tried to blink away.  The vision of Cas holding Claire close on holidays while Sam talks with his hands over a fuzzy home movie style film filter crossed his mind.  Come to think of it, he entertained its possibility more than once before Cas made it all the more attainable by pressing that same desire into him through his overly intense but oh so
“Seeing as you like it so much, I’ll have to take you to Kline’s someday.  Maybe get something else on their dessert menu.”
His top teeth pulled over the curve of his bottom lip loosely while he eyes drifted to the stranger sitting hunkered on the floor beside the living room side table again.  Fractions of surprised and delighted expressions danced across his face as he listened to the late nineties rock pumping into his large thickly padded headphones.  Dean’s heart slowed drinking in the contented, open body language of his friend.  “He speaks to me, Sam.”
“What do you mean?” His realization ripped her focus from the screen.
Once their drinks arrived, the focus of the conversation shifted into more familiar territory.  Only then did the jig his heart was dancing of its own accord slow to an afternoon saunter, even while he followed the curves of the stranger’s face as he intently listened to Sam’s inroads to substantive matters.
“Sure he fought Sam tooth and nail to let him into our small Salvage family, but like Bobby said, ‘family don’t end in blood’.” He shared a long stare with Benny who in turn shook his head with a grin.  “Since you’ve joined out band of misfits, you’ve given Sam and I a full on education on business expansion, reporting methods, hell, even bee endangerment.” His observation sent a variety of cackles from all directions into the fire.  “But most of all, you made all of us want you to be around a lot longer,” he said then nodded at Benny who rose up to hand Castiel a brown manila envelope.
He ripped the headphones from his neck and shot up from the bed.  “No, Sam.  I’m out of patience.  I’ve waited long enough!  We searched high and low for him for weeks!  He pops back up and skulks around here like a…” his words crammed back into his throat like a slow motion wreck in reverse and his eyes widened.
Davies’ outburst thickened the air to nearly unbreathable levels.  Even Ketch let his ranting hang in the air, untampered before moving on.  “They caught me coming back from the drop point shortly after I received my new orders.  That’s when I dropped your alias, Dean.”  He tried to find any empathy in his partner’s face for the first time since their meeting in the parking garage.  The mixed results spurred him on.  “Covarrubias kept an eye on me from then on.  I tapped Davies for more help, but he became resistant.  My new boss halted all Sunday services and escalated the attack plans.  Her demeanor changed on a dime.  The intricacies of grand plan flip-flopped as the day grew closer.  I barely made it to the drop point with updated timetable without a suddenly clingy subordinate at my side.  Ammo production scaled up, crates of guns stacked up the warehouse higher and higher.  Our ‘volunteers’ were dying of exhaustion at an alarming rate.  With nowhere else to store the decaying bodies, I suggested piling them up in the freezer.  In order to hide the one corpse they weren’t looking for, I appealed to their fear of discovery.  Even though we were in the middle of nowhere, satellites would be able to pick up a mass grave if we weren’t careful.”
The blood drained from his face and washed out from his suddenly chilly fingers.  “What did Cas say?”
The girl of the hour sat on a cushioned lounge chair in the corner, mainly because of its manageable seat height, pulling her bright yellow socks on.  Her mood rebounded in a flash seeing her other aunt.  “Jo!”
“He said the gas stove exploded and burned through the rope on that bound him at the side of the table.  He pulled himself out of the house, but the blast gave him third degree burns over half of his body.  The agent surveyed the neighbors, members of the reservation nearby, coworkers, but only one person held any ill will toward the Blackbears.”
He chuckled and simulated Cas’s healing touch by bringing two fingers to the forehead.
Cas looked over the documents littering the table and found the legal pad with their combined notes on the case.  He leafed through the added notes quickly and folded the pad back to his sketches from the previous night.  The fearsome raijyu sketch drew the hunter’s attention to the center of the table where it was laid out. “Raijyu can be drawn from their subjugated hosts with a warded container and an expelling Shinto chant.  I found a recording of it online we can use.  The containment vessel shouldn’t be too difficult to make ourselves.”  The angel pointed to the doodle of a container next to it.  “An optimal container would house a singular copper rod with an ash coated glass shell.  I can replicate the sacred characters required on all of its surfaces, of course.” His fingers roamed over each component of the diagram.  “However we must fill the base with a moderate amount of corn powder.”
Years prior Sam established a practice in town but was tapped by the powers that be to join a larger practice.  The corporate representation life was working well for him, but seeing his clients stomp on the little people in agribusiness one too many times sent him screaming for less morally compromising work in local government.  Dean nearly laughed in his face when he broke the news that he was moving out of their three room flat in the city to pursue justice for the little guy back Bobby’s way.  Between a rock and a hard place, the margin for error to afford their flat and childcare became precariously thin.  Especially after taking so much time off travelling back and forth to settle Bobby’s affairs as be grew weaker and weaker, the elder Winchester’s days under the bright city lights were numbered.  The Saturday after they listened to the world’s least interesting audiobook of Bobby’s last will and testament, Dean packed up their things and headed for Bobby’s barren two-story ranch style home with a confused and ornery seven year old in tow.
“You would?” He stood up from his slouching spot perplexed.
“Hey!” a mouthy disheveled redhead shouted from behind the fence separating the party from the pair’s shrinking intimacy bubble.  An equally tickled Gilda folded an arm over her shoulder with cheeks full of ballooning mirth.  “Guys!”
He grunted in begrudging affirmation still drawn in on himself.
He shrugged his majestically broad shoulders and pushed off the pillar.  “Don’t know.  Sam just left a note.  Something tells me you would know his reason better than I.”
Castiel pulled the top two off of his neat pile and ruminated over both for a moment.  After careful consideration he nodded and lifted up the one in his left hand further into Dean’s view.
He harrumphed at the change in tone.   “Last time we spoke you were dodging Agent Green’s lips with lackluster enthusiasm.  Hell of a blind date by the way.”
Castiel grew pale and blurted, “Oh, no, I meant, thank you.  I um… I’ll change right away.  I have an overnight bag in the car.  I have a pair of sneakers in there.  Where’s your bathroom?”
“Those sound like porn titles.”
A small hum lifted into a higher octave than the accompanying melody then ventured down a half beat as the song dictated.   His feet strummed along into clear view of the cold linoleum floor bound angel.  Guileless footfalls drew the angel’s attention up to Dean’s tense gaze.  “Hello, Dean.”
The library, garage, bathroom, and spartan bedroom Cas occupied while he slept forty-nine feet from his own were all empty.  He scratched the back of his head and shifted his weight to the other leg in front of the room.  The lights were off, but the door was wide open.  With the bed made with military precision, Sam guessed he hadn’t been there since the previous morning.  The cars were all in the garage minus the Impala, so with his Grace depleted to such a scant level he had to be in the bunker somewhere.  The conversation over a lightbulb rang in his head.  Maybe he had been impatient with Cas.  Maybe he pushed him too hard.  Cas wouldn’t be avoiding him, would he?  He was too straight forward, too awkwardly abrasive to let a thing like that ring silent for long.  Cas was wallowing over something, and that thing had to be the Impala; so Dean by proxy.  He trotted further down the hallway and descended the stairs to the destroyed second storage room.  His fingers felt for the metal plated light switch and flicked up.  The sight of the Impala limping on a lone inflated tire was downright depressing.  Finding no sign of anything at least as depressing but animate, Sam huffed similarly deflated.  He switched the light back off and trotted up the stairs on limber muscles back to the kitchen.  On his way, he looked at the clock and crinkled his nose at the late hour.  How in the world were they planning on reorganizing the stack of journals if Dean slept into the afternoon?  Wherever Cas was, he needed his rest, but he would be damned if he was going to let Dean pout all god damned day over the Impala’s tragic yet temporary state.  He stood in front of the door eleven and strained his eyes to make out any light beneath the door.  The fucker was still asleep.  Still devising an adequate punishment, he turned the handle to the room and peered inside, choice words poised to hurl at his lazy brother.
As they scooped up parcels of flaky crust and apple their minds separated once again, Cas recalled their road trip to get more tires for Baby.  The Mom and Mom diner he happened across several drives through town before offered up a feast of scrumptious savory pies he’d never thought to try before.   After Cas fell, Dean started ordering for him, insisting he be his first guide into the complex and challenging world of human culinary delights.  Cas politely stayed quiet, enjoying the twinkle in his eye when Cas delighted in one of his choices.  A pattern began to evolve but didn’t strike him fully until they sat at that very diner and a warm plate of sweet potato pie was slid between them.  The hunter weighed and measured Cas’s experience with new food by the time he took to draw the fork or other utensil from his lips.  The longer it took him to steal the food from it, the longer it took to withdraw from between his lips, the more deluded his sincere gaze became, and transfixed by the universe the pieces fell into.  Cas let the languid withdraw tax Dean’s heated senses as he finished the last bit of buttery crust.  Dean bit his bottom lip and his tongue swiped over it to calm the pink dusted hue of his cheeks.  The waitress practically leapt when Dean called out excitedly for another slice.  It became Cas’s favorite.
“The more people who know about the bunker the more at risk we are for someone getting the wrong idea about Claire living there.  The last thing we need is someone assuming we live in a dark hole in the ground and sicking CPS on us.”
Her sneakers squeaked as she crouched down to grab her small yet mysteriously damp hand.  “What were you looking forward to the most at the County Fair?  Think real hard and tell me two things.”
He looked at the clock on his phone and stood up, one foot pointed towards the door.  “Well, if you could keep me in the loop, I’ll owe you another one.”
Universe, Cas thought again.  The possibility he landed in a different part of the world with a clone of Dean in it was unrealistically low.  The gravity of the realization settled over him like a dense comforter of dispossession.  Shoulders slumped as he climbed all the way under the thin waffle woven covers of the metal hospital bed.  With the pillow half under his head and half in his arms, be rolled away from the light casting around the door left ajar.  His even breaths warmed his cheek against the pillow.  His creaking joints silenced over a few exhales imagining the pillow in his arms was Dean’s usually hot slumber smell soaked backside.  Perhaps this was one of those brief travels though time and space.  Perhaps he would wake up curled against temporary tattooed skin and pick up where they left off.  Perhaps it was the smell of the bunker invading his nose instead of the antiseptic chemical tang against the back of his throat.  Any way he cut it, without Grace to dull his senses, he would dream of home.
Nervousness flushed from every pore at the intent of the drawing.  He collapsed back first on the bed and called out, “Very funny, Angel!”
They bumped into each other often as they were both inflicted with early riser syndrome. This particular morning, she had the bubbly demeanor of a pharmacology student with unfettered access to all the best amphetamines.  You couldn’t convince Sam her polished pleasantness was just to be blamed on her Minnesotan upbringing.  “Agent, you look two sheets to the wind.  Did ya get any rest?”
With both hands, he pulled him up for a rejuvenating kiss, tasting a background note of tang amongst the hoppy libation still on Dean’s tongue.  Since most of his bones already dissolved into jelly, he barely nodded when Dean wordlessly asked for permission to clean up their mess with a needy stare.  With thick wide licks he sopped up their largely diminished spend, delectation clearly knitted into his accompanying sedate smile.  Before Dean could race off to the bathroom to retrieve a warm damp cloth Castiel planted one last sloppy kiss on his temple.  Contentment washed over him at the newly intimate gesture.  Castiel waited for his return to more thoroughly erase their bone deep satisfying muddle with a flutter in his belly.
, he urged tightening his hold in an attempt to self-sooth.
“You see, Lafitte was like a dog with a steak bone.  The moment he stepped into her home the first time we met her; he knew she was guilty of something, like he could smell it in her blood.  She lived in one of those brownstones with fall decor bursting off of the front stoop: a woven wreath with fake maize, cheery five foot tall scarecrow, and an intricately carved foam pumpkin with a battery operated candle inside.”
“Don’t.  That’s when I called you the first time.”
“Can’t we ask this supposed ‘friendly’ to go get Cas for us?”
The supposition was worth pondering.  After the pair’s often bullheaded efforts to save people during a case, Cas has brought them to safety or repaired their bodies from seemingly irreparable damage many times before.  Taking the Raijin’s wrathful bolt for example, Sam had third degree burns and ruptured organs.  Grace can mend any carbon based life form down to the genetic building blocks of assuming there were any blocks left.  Despite the older hunter being far worse off; he was able to piece him back together although it took substantially more energy and time.  Hell, he swore with a smirk, mending Dean’s soul was a taxing but unchallenging task for him as well.  The raijyu’s tantrum was comparatively of little concern from the human perspective, but Sam wasn’t the one who had to summon the primal celestial energy to rejoin the fragments back into alignment.  “Rest assured Sam I will not let anything happen to your brother.  However part of this ritual is in your brother’s hands.  I believe he concentrate enough on the task, get past any trepidation he has.”
“Ah.  So how long have you owned the gallery?” he asked following James back towards the waning crowd.
“Okay then, Castiel,” Sam let the name jut out of his mouth carelessly.  “How have you been enjoying Chateau Winchester since your harrowing escape?”
“… With a blue and white tie,” he added and waved at the stranger.
“Before I met you there, did you see anyone else in that pit I found you in?”
He rubbed at both sides of his neck and stapled his arms back around his middle.  “It just got complicated, though.”  His gaze crossed over the account of Zachariah’s torture in the journey back up to Sam, but careened back down again catching a number at the bottom right of the document.  In disbelief, he flipped through the pages one by one searching for evidence of a mechanical flaw in the typewriter used to punch out the statement, a mistype, anything fishy.
his overworked engine stalled out.  Fingers gripped fast to his long sleeves desperately, every part of him drenched with fear so deep no light could reach it.
Emerald greens strafed away, mining his thoughts for the proper intentions.  “Nah, I mean, I don’t want to come off as self-deprecating.  It’s just… you’re this earth shatteringly hot, killer smart guy with a unique career and I’m just a mechanic who fell into brewing beer – a single father with a mountain of accompanying complication beating down the door.”  The “
“And it’s good to have you home, Cas,” he added.  Cas still didn’t turn to face him, so he headed back down the flights of stairs to retrieve his freshly showered train wreck of a brother.
“It was a miscalculation on my part.  Whole cultures have thrived for centuries on nothing but oral history.  Their calculating leader kept an eye on me over a few weeks through intermediaries.  My closest ‘friend’ in the group, a short name man named Reggie, noticed one too many inconsistencies in my induction ritual story and passed the word along to someone in the shadows.  While the leader didn’t care to let his followers read and write, he did let his members draw and take photographs.  Imagine my surprise when he presented me with an induction ritual album with instant print photos of each of his followers seemingly in ecstasy as he drugged and tortured each one into absolute submission. Pressed flat neatly into the pages next to each photo was a bit of that member’s hair or petal of shriveled dried out flesh.   Think of it like a scrapbook for sadists.  When he asked me to find my picture, I froze.  According to their edicts, there was no recourse for my defensing myself against their leader.  When I couldn’t point out a face, my friend tied each of my limbs to a foldable metal stadium chair with zip close plastic straps where I stayed for six days.”
Next Chapter:  Dean bends under the pressure of Cas ghosting them.  Castiel explains in the only way he knows how.
“About two weeks,” he said quietly.
Sam looked at the clock on his phone’s screen four times in the past fifteen minutes.  Counting backward from the time be walked back through the bunker door, it was clear Dean hadn’t gotten any recuperative sleep in those three days.  While he wanted to let Dean sleep, he also knew he would get his ass chewed if he sat on the reason Cas’s Grace changed his channel and didn’t wake him.  The decision weighed on him enough that he took up polishing the Olympic oval Dean wore into the library floor with his socked feet while he couldn’t get ahold of Sam those first agonizing forty-eight hours.  Somewhere on a high thirties lap, Sam heard the coffee machine carafe clink back into its recess in the kitchen.  His brother had slept for about twenty hours straight, but from the muttering he could hear on the way towards him, it wasn’t as restful as either one of them would have liked.
“In the simplest terms, yes.  There’s a cult here in Kansas that is the focus of my current project. It’s what brought me to the state.  Well, technically there are several in the state, but only one on my radar.”
“Sooner or later he’s gonna find out about the bunker.”
Dean quirked a playful eyebrow at him.  “Was that a dig at me?”
The stranger fervently shook his head and held out a hand to take the garment back.  After the jacket was within his grasp again, he smiled at Dean faintly.  Upon closer inspection, his outstretched hand showed signs of struggle.  Pink inflamed knuckles curled around the bulk of the jacket.  A new small welt blossomed through the day old stubble on his lower left jaw.  Dean backed away a couple of steps and pointed to the same spot on his jaw.  “What happened there, bud?”
Judging by the height of the selection closest to the player, he had already listened to over half of his current pile.  More than the day before, he guessed.  “If you’re not really listening to ‘em, then why play ‘em at all?”
“Being stuck in a tight space with you…” he muttered sheepishly into his hair tracing the outside edge of his foot with his big toe.  “If Jo hadn’t shown up when she did, I would have made a complete fool of myself right there in that hotbox.”
The angel smiled at them and enjoyed the calm frivolousness of the moment.  The bunker had become his home as it had become theirs.  As much as it was their birthright, they invited him to share it with them.  There was no doubt he needed this warm nest to recharge as quickly as possible.  Returning to his hunters always stilled his restless mind, but when had he started thinking of them as his?  In passing the hunters had referred to him as “their angel” for the sake of clarification and brevity.  Devotion seeped into the way Dean said it sometimes, but Cas tried not to read into it.  In the beginning, it was hard enough to accept that they wanted him around for who he was, not what they could do for them.  Sometimes self-doubt stirred misgivings of their intentions when they called him “their angel” so the pair went out of their way to refer to his abilities separately from his identity.  The effort they made to create the distinction was meaningful to him, made him feel appreciated and more at home no matter where they rested their heads at night.
“It’s not sore. The muscles are weak.”
“Ignoring the now undeniable fact that you spend entirely too much time at that construction mega mart, how does a part made after this place was last occupied appear under our sink?”
The instant Castiel spotted him, he half stepped back as if tripped by an invisible carpet.  “I guess the monster film fest already began.”
A distilled vacillation overtook him, sending a tremor out from his soul.  The tendril darted for its epicenter instantly.  Dean scrutinized his face, his breathing escalating, taking a couple of minutes to resolve.  Had he felt its yearning?  Sensed it waiting at his iron clad locked door without a keyhole to peek through?
“Yeah, Cas.  If we hand this over to the authorities…”
“Is he dangerous?  His profile said he was admitted to a mental hospital and had a prescription for anti-psychotics.”
Gleeful jitters sprang from Dean as he added, “Don’t worry, Sammy. You’re not the only one.”
“I needed to do a spell.”
“Hey, eyes on the prize, mister,” he gestured towards the fourth egg slipping precariously close to the outer rim of the pan as he cracked it.
“Night, Sammy,” Dean called, leaning his elbows backwards over the railing and returned his soft gaze to Cas.  A secretive smirk curled along his lips.
Thanks for reading until the end!  I couldn't settle on a title until I posted the complete work.  The story was partially inspired by a song called "Dumb Things", but using that as the title would have erased any gravity attributed to the intended amount of drama.  I hope all the time jumps made sense. If I end up finding a beta, I'll end up making adjustments anyway and clarify some things further.
Their link constricted, tugged them inwards against its warm comforting walls.  Dean’s knees wavered and knocked into Cas’s as they swayed.  Shuttering breaths climbed mountains to escape his nostrils erratically.  The thick smell of descending rain pillowed off of Castiel as he struggled to detangle their frayed nerves.  Dean tried to memorize every detail of the man in his arms, knowing he would fill the details in later with everything he loved about him.
The egging smirk died on his lips before he could finish the thought.  “Not the coffee then.  You sure you’re not flirting with any other synthetic encouragement?”
Surprise nestled into his brow.  “You know what?  That was actually quite tame.
Sam turned for a second to search Dean’s face for some missing detail.  “Meaning?”
“About the Lovette Park incident…  I’ll be submitting my final report on it this afternoon.  In all likelihood I will be out of here at a ‘Bureau 5’.  I’m getting the last words to paper so to speak.”
“Last time I was driving back from Reno, that Bowie cover came on the radio.  You know the one that Nirvana did live?  It was the first time I vividly remember imagining you being the one singing the song, feeling the lyrics from your point of view.  How we’ve both done the wrong thing for the right reasons over and over, watched each other slip away…But no matter how much time had passed, we came back together because we understood each other.  Staring at that desert highway for hours after, I couldn’t stop thinking about you, Cas.  You replaced all those strangers and became the only one those songs are those written about.”  His sweaty palms paused with his words.  Cas looked like he was pulling the air molecules in the middle distance apart only to reassemble them again a few feet over.  As much as Dean wanted to rip his focus back, he had to give him time.
A wide palm swiped over his face as if to wipe the sleep deprived expression clean.  “Here and there.  Words are starting to run into each other, anyways.  Could have sworn I just read what configuration an angel’s junk had to be in to ‘seed a Nephilim’.  Thought I was wrong at first, but there are detailed depictions.  Very unsexy and wildly unhelpful. I guess I should catch some shut eye for a bit.”
Dean squinted off into the van’s ceiling for a long moment. “Not a bad idea.  I could hit up the recipes when we get back and see if something jumps out at us.  Thanks, Cas.”
The triumvirate spent the rest of the daylight hanging around the city center indulging the littlest one’s whims.  When they returned to the bunker, Sam exchanged a reticent look with Dean as they unlocked the clunky side door.  Until they stepped through its thick metal doors knowing they were lurking, the bunker was never as thick with the ghosts of its previous tenants’ presence.  For the foreseeable future, they would continue to hang in the stretched corridors and the bottoms of utility closets, hovering just past distant corners until their secrets were unraveled.
Wordlessly, he nodded and closed the door behind him.  How was he supposed to enjoy how at peace he felt with Castiel now?  How was he going to gaze into his piercing blue eyes and not feel a peel of nervousness?  How obvious was his affection for an angel temporarily in his universe if Ketch knew just where to strike from miles away?  Where exactly had this instantaneous bond appeared from?  How could something strike and swallow his existence up with such speed?

He slowly nodded and uncrossed his arms, letting him know he was listening openly as he could.  The distrust was still riding shotgun, but his eyes were firmly on his face. “I do, Sam.”
With his eyelids shut closed, he tried to fully envision the moment Jody described the day they formally offered Cas the job.  He was dressed casually, but his jeans and button down looked slightly starchy, probably new.  The nerd must have been looking forward to their little shindig as much as he had been.  His hair had a smattering of product in it, like he wasn’t use to applying it regularly.  Random small spikes especially across the back took well into the evening to lay in their natural direction.  It didn’t look as soft as usual.  Dozens of times he wondered what those thick brunet waves would feel like under his fingers before he was gifted the opportunity to learn firsthand it was softer than he imagined.  He kept his eyes down on the precious tray of cookies he carried once he spotted him and then was too busy dodging Claire to pay him much attention at all.
The brusque order twirled around the base of his neck and a part of him wanted nothing more than to show him how obedient he could be, but he needed answers – not big complicated answers to any one of his similarly complicated questions.  Just solving one mystery for the day would be enough in his tired state.  God he hoped Cas wouldn’t grow weary of his persistent questions like he grew tired of his own perpetually turning gears.
He tilted his head in his direction when he was a bit too quiet for a bit too long.
“Good night, Sam,” Cas said.  The production he made of his exit from the kitchen was a big enough hint to Cas that now was the time to shoehorn the conversation he wanted them to have into the evening.  Before he could segue into the topic, Dean sat up and began clearing the rest of the table.
After a few moments of squinting, his eyes adjusted to the darkness and he could make out a second form just past Dean on the bed, only mildly shorter and smaller than Dean.  His hand leapt to cover his mouth and he closed the door unburdened by eloquent pre-determined swears.  Briskly, he returned to his coffee mug stamped “Property of Singer Salvage” at the kitchen table, filled it to the brim and let the liquid heat his finger pads through the ceramic.  In their line of business it could very well be a malicious entity enjoying the nearness of his brother.  He half turned in his seat back to the kitchen entrance in thought.  The bunker was more than sufficiently warded, even against the most recent baddies they learned about from Tamara.  That languid form that practically snuggled into his brother had to be Cas.  It had to be.  Had it finally happened?  Had they confessed at last?  He smiled at his temperate coffee with a grin as he swirled it around.  If they were at long, long, long last together he could stop agonizing over their situation and focus on something just as meaningful… maybe his own love life.
He flipped to the end of the book to get the page number of the last page, but his attention was drawn to some hand written notes in the margins.  Another Vonnegut lover had sat with this printing as well.  His pause drew Cas’s attention.
His brother cast him a chastising look that softened as he followed Dean’s hands from one costume to the next.  “Yeah, this is only half of it,” he pointed at the boxes lining the lowest shelf behind them, some of them in as bad of shape as the ones by their feet.  “I thought we could get some of those metal racks and hang them all up.  You know, air them out.  Some of them are too damaged after being down here for so long.  We’ll have to go through them and toss what’s too far gone.”
“How did Bobby and Sam take it?”
Gazing into the viscous brown liquor filled glass at his sightline; he reclined so far the back of his head hit the top of the ratty broken office chair.  He drowned the pinpricks of discord multiplying in his belly in another shot and put the bottom heavy glass back down in the same position he found it if only to have something else to redirect his attention to.  He traced the ceiling beams from one end of the office to the other pulling his thoughts along their lines into some semblance of order.
“Nah, I’m the only one that’s even been past the door.  Can’t speak for our would-be intruder, though.  If someone did break in, this place would have to be the reason, right?” his pondering absent any conviction.
“I would have enjoyed the show,” he admitted running a thumb over his companion’s palm.  “Hell, I already was.  You looked like you wanted to eat me for dinner, but I would have trussed myself up given the chance.  Albeit the van isn’t the best place for that kind of thing.”
He shook his head slowly, not wanting to come off as dismissive.  “All investments come with complications, stressors, and certain unpredictability.  You and Sam were very easy to work with.  Over time I came to think of you all as friends, closer to anyone I’ve been with in well… an exceedingly long time.  I have you both to thank for that.  Charlie has received many thanks for bringing us all together.  In particular, I’d like to thank you, though,” he nearly whispered.  He raised his hand to touch the side of Dean’s face, but lost his nerve staring into the tumultuous pools of moss analyzing his features hazily.  Ultimately he let his hand fall to his shoulder to stroke down the outside of his arm.
The hunter released his head, his eyes shifting back and forth as if trying to find their natural center again.  Words sprinted from his mouth, but none fell on the Angel’s eardrums.  Keeping every piece of himself in line took almost every iota of energy he had.  He inched his wobbling form back to Dean’s side now that he was more certain he wouldn’t cause his hunter any more discomfort.  From the warring expressions of concern on Dean’s face, the hunter was clearly just as frightened as he was, but he had the situation under control now.  The lips he just melded with his grimaced and frowned in quick intervals.  Those firm arms encircled him, ensuring he kept upright.  That calming encapsulation righted every atom of his being to magnetic north and he let loose a puff of relief.  As much as his tired face could manage, he smiled at the hunter and kissed his cheek.  While he couldn’t say how grateful he was to have Dean there with him through whatever was happening, he couldn’t hazard to utter a syllable of it.  Upon parting his lip from his nervous grin, every molecule flipped back to magnetic south, imploding every one of his cells into a burst of light.  The power of his Grace’s gravity pulled him to a speck smaller than a quark and every one of his senses went blank.
“Um, Cas? You want help cleaning that up?” he interjected.  God, the coffee was doing absolutely jack.
============================================
Mesmerized, he watched the piece disappear into his mouth and a tongue unfold from inside to lick up the excess sweetness from his lips.  He nearly dropped his fork recalling their foiled opportunities earlier.   Cas dragged a finger through the filling spilled onto the side of the tin and sucked it off of his finger clearly unaware of the effect it had on Dean.  He rubbed his knees against each other and tried not to follow the thrilling chase of where his thoughts went for two reasons.  One, he just had pasta and nearly half of a pie and extracurriculars would be jarring to his digestive system.  Two, he was sure no matter how strong the pull of sleep would be, he wouldn’t be able to withdraw from Cas’s proximity if the festivities started.  Who knew if he was comfortable with any of that anyway.  Before he knew it, his hand was reaching out to touch Cas’s, to simply begin their mind meld anew.  Now that he knew he could speak and experience this connection with him, his words felt dislocated, inaccurate.   To hear an emphatic ‘yes’ from their tether would somehow mean far more than a simple verbal affirmative, even if he could suddenly utter it.  Cas’s eyes darted over to a approaching hand questioningly, so Dean laid it flat on the marble island top and asked, “Would you like to watch a movie or something?  I can’t be up too late so no marathons, but we can watch whatever you like.”
Dean thought back to the first few hours keeping an eye on the mysterious space dimple.  “Not an inch.  If it can draw any furniture in, there are a few hideous pieces in the storage room I could toss at it... for science.”
“What about Bobby’s set?” he inquired still calculating in his head how much more it would cost to install three more cameras preferably pointing at entryways and not brick walls.  It’s cheaper to future proof, he reasoned.  Hindsight is always more costly.
“Then there was that time we were driving past Kansas City that you almost cried when you heard…”
The traffic between home and Lebanon took double the usual commute time due to a string of red lights and a strange piece of farming equipment he’d never seen before, like a red tractor on giraffe wheels with a smoker’s cough.  Truth be told, in the past couple of years he had been in farmland more than any time before.  The Family who raised him lived on a complex with manicured gardens, two tennis courts, and a household staff twenty strong.  After his homeless period hopping rides to the coast, he stuck to bustling urban centers where jobs were plentiful and he could squeeze out a modest college education on impossibly long nights and strangely short weekends.  The farmland darting past his windshield reminded him of his first drive back into rural Kansas, how unnerving he found the long stretches wild brush along the roadsides at first.  It was too unplanned, plants scattered about as if the wind haphazardly placed them there.  Of course he knew that was nature’s will, but seeing as he had been surrounded with nothing but cement rectangles and three by three foot squares of dirt housing a single tree since his emancipation, all that free range life seemed a tad ostentatious.  Once he migrated to a sleepy town only a couple hours from his childhood estate, it slowly wallpapered his ideal landscape.  The castles of industry built brick by brick became an eyesore, eventually dulling his affinity for city life altogether.  The lack of conveniences took less time to acclimate to than he imagined as the ability to order anything from fast food to boutique furniture online filtered out to even his newly developed neighborhood on the outskirts of town.  Over the past few months, crossing into the farmland connected to Salvage filled him with a majestic peace; the precise lines of skyward stretched crops were planned out, but the varying height of disparate crops reinforced that this was humanity’s work at its finest.
The same grimace Dean recognized from Sam’s elementary days covering for his underfed friend flashed on his face.  “So the remains of the remains we found have to belong to this guy ‘Zachariah’.  Those cuffs carved with strange symbols had to be the Angelic handcuffs Sunder mentioned, right?” he asked as less of a question and more drawing attention to the first exhibit in many that would follow.  During law school, Sam read all his elementary stabs at tort writing out loud in the same measured, insistent tone.  Its rehearsed quality didn’t make the points that trailed it any easier to hear.  “With as stained as those sheets were…  Dean, assuming he was murdered in the subbasement then his killers, this Lily Sunder and company, had access to the bunker.”
Sam looked at him incredulously.  “Say that one more time but with feeling.”
She rose to leave and gave him an almost paternal nod.  “You just give me the word and I will decimate his credit.  He won’t even be able to rent a bicycle.”
“Forgive me, but I will pass out soon, Dean.  One last time, is there anything else I can do to make you comfortable about tomorrow?”  His tired labored breathing heated over his forehead.
Cas gripped back just as tightly, ever careful not to hurt or injure his hunter with his superhuman enthusiasm even if it were hampered by the spell.  His jackhammering heart slowed in his arms at last.
He blinked several times and exhaled in a bid to re-center his attention on the here and now.  Dean’s bewildered expression greeted him when he turned his head.  “My apologies.  Your home is quite breathtaking.”
He opened his mouth and closed it again in silent confusion. His eyes searched in all directions for a clue as to what the two were insinuating.  “What?  I’m not… pregnant…” he reasoned out loud.
The next few moments sped by so fast Dean hardly had a chance to think, only move on instinct, and let his reflexes drive his body to the right place at the right time.  He threw his body towards Ketch’s hands as he lined up his shot.  Since they both started from the seated position, Dean couldn’t throw enough of his weight to misdirect the bullet’s trajectory free of Davies in time.  An incredibly loud pop rang out inches from his ear.  Not one second later, he heard two men grunt and the sound of something large toppling over something else behind him.  Ketch retracted his hands with gun in tow, irate accusatory eyes narrowing on him.  They shoved the table against each other’s shins as they struggled for the glock at one point aimed at the other’s face.  His partner hollered as he yanked the gun back with one hand and decked Dean with the other.  He leaned into his space thinking he had the upper hand.  The table broke under his weight as he fell.  Looking back he saw Sam pressing down on Davies’s chest as he pleaded to any god that would listen desperately.  His partner lined up his shot on Davies again and ordered Sam to step aside.  A sideways kick to the knee should keep him immobile and distracted enough with pain to recover the sidearm, he decided.  He drew up his leg and kicked Ketch’s knee sideways, sending him crashing down to floor with an excruciating wail.  He scrambled onto his knees to pin Ketch down only to find the barrel of the gun held right to his neck.  The partners swallowed breaths greedily, listening to the distressed agent behind them cry out for Davies to hold on.
Sam started to stiffen beside him, but listened patiently.
“Having second thoughts about that cake?” he beamed.
some things,” he rolled his fingers into the air implying how much more he knew.
“Found family is just as strong,” he stated, testifying to his belief.  He grabbed the empty glasses and bottle and walked backwards toward the kitchen.  “How about I go get us a couple of those Sahti beers I spied in the fridge?”
Missouri delighted in catching a glimpse of her home life but remained skeptical.  In her line of work it was impossible not to.
“Why can’t you… do that now?” Dean wasn’t sure if it was the want growing in him or the hitched heartbeat flooding endorphins through him, but his vision was fuzzing around the edges. “Pardon me for being skeptical, but you just appear to be a handsome specimen of everyday humanity...”  His eyes rolled up and down Castiel’s bursting blue eyes and firm jawline as he continued, “Nothing about your appearance screams ‘divine being’.  And you had so many fractures and bruised bones when I brought you to the hospital…”
===============
His heart swelled and he turned his head sideways to look at Cas, trying to imagine the expression on his face through the darkness.  “What did you play me, Cas?  A little Zepplin?  Stevie Ray?  Black Sabbath?”
Ignoring the imagery of Cas’s tongue laving over a long rigid surface took some effort, but he mustered the focus to stay on point.  “His track record on zapping Baby to and fro isn’t encouraging, Sam,” he whined through gritted distemper. Sam gave him a judgmental eyebrow raise and he let out a deep breath. “I know, Sammy. I just… I know he was just helping.  But we aren’t any closer to figuring out what took down that house or what possessed Donnie and company.”
he mused.
“It’s in Enochian, the language of Angels. It looks like a poem, but it’s actually warding against one particular angel.”
“Cas said he was adopted at the same time as another boy by an ‘Elder’.  That must be how they grow their member pool: legal adoption.”
“The lore says that divine beings’ wavelengths are subject to colliding energies. Those wavelengths have an effect on the universe around them.  They remain intact by periodically recalibrating to counteract opposing stimuli like other types of energy. By having a disturbed wavelength that angel created matter to manifest its pain.  Angels’ physiology adapts to new conditions faster than humans; like passing on advantageous genes between cycles of replacing cells, not through offspring.  An angel’s grace will remake the vessel over weeks to accommodate for updated external factors; think increased bone density, oxygen saturation levels, vary metabolism rates.  From what I gather, it’s not as fast as growing a third arm; more like unconscious mind over matter reconfiguration.”
The glow of the blue horns reflected the fear bouncing around behind James’s eyes.  “What is that, Dean?”
They checked their firearms and returned them to their rightful places, giving a final nod to signal their fully-cocked preparedness. The pair stepped quietly over the fence, crushing the neglected dying grass underfoot on their path to duck under the large living room window overlooking the sparse cul-de-sac.  The dusty curtains were pulled closed, but they could barely make out two strained voices in the front half of the house.  Sam squinted at Dean as he failed to parse the muffled words then shrugged in defeat.  There were no knocks or clashes to warn them of a struggle, so Dean gestured to the back side of the house where a similar large stretch of yellowed dead Kentucky blue grass whispered betrayal under their shoes.  A first peek between the pale yellow back door window curtains revealed no one, just the view of the closed front door from the opposite side. They must have been in the living room to the right of the door or work area to the left.  The basement was the most defendable point in the house, though.  That’s why most operations took place there; it was soundproofed, sterile, and stocked to the brim with supplies.  Despite all that, the hushed voices originated from the front.  With no other points of egress, they settled on this entrance with a practiced operational sign language hampered by guns in hand.  The voices disappeared, nothing guiding them to a target or captive’s location.  They waited for several minutes poised and ready.  Sam rolled his eyes at him impatiently.  Dean lifted a finger to his lips and peered up through the window again.  A dark mopped figure sauntered past his view into the living room on the right.  He ducked back down and signaled their next actions to Sam.  Even though a concerned reluctance consumed his face, he eventually nodded in agreement.  The taller agent used the safe house key he originally copied to slip Dean and opened the back door very slowly.  Even slower still, they made their way onto the shag carpeting and clicked the door closed behind them.
“Huh,” he commented. When they first arrived at the emergency room, a doctor dragged the stranger off to do an evaluation leaving the agent to navigate the sterile smell of several corridors until he found him in a private room surrounded by overworked nurses.  After speaking to the most amenable of the nurses the first time around, they said they’d test him for drugs due to his disorientation and keep him hydrated.  They found nothing chemically wrong in the lab results.  What would a fighter pilot be doing in a hole in the ground without any shoes on?  “Did he say anything to you at any point?”
“We appreciate that,” Sam replied more out of reflex than anything.
A laugh rumbled into him like a wave crashing to shore.  “Dude, that was so fuckin’ hot.  I had no idea you were so incredible.”
The main source of light in the depressing hospital room was one overworked tan lamp in the far corner. This evening, moonlight was the only source of light streaming in curving dashes over the lax form sleeping on his side on the reclined bed.  Dean reclaimed his space on the chair beside him, but again the chair was too far away.  To improve the view of his long lashes and hushed sleep panting he had grown accustomed to, he leaned forward and scooted the chair closer. The unintended scraping noise caused the messy mop of hair to stir.  The stranger rolled over to find the source of disturbance blinking a few times, but his lids closed again once he curled towards Dean on the bed.  Interlaced just below his chin between his closed hand and the bedsheet was the familiar his navy jacket.  The seductive pull of protective affection grabbed at Dean’s core.  Why was he so enamored with his unremarkable sport coat?  He thought back to smaller partners waking up in his larger clothing after a night of mutual rub and tug.  It wasn’t about the clothing that drove them to borrow it few a few hours, it was about who was wearing it beforehand that made it alluring to tangle themselves up in.  Again, he thought of how closely the stranger stood to him almost immediately, how trusting he seemed to be.  Was it really not that off base to think he liked the jacket so much because it was his?  If only…
(See the end of the chapter for
“I write under a pen name, yes.  How about if you can figure out what it is before Friday, I’ll pick out a movie for us to watch, deal?” he dangled the eventuality in front of him.  There was little doubt in his mind they would skip out on an excuse to prolong their time together, anyway.
“Ah, Claire, remember yesterday how I told you that I have a very important dinner meeting tonight?  I told you I’d bring you home a fancy dessert if the Mills said you were good.”
story your favorite?” he asked sounding out the word while pointing at each syllable.
“Well, you do pick the weirdest places to pick up ladies.”
Charlie rolled her eyes and smoothed out her jacket, practically biting him with her startled grimace.
“Did the dead cow say something funny?” The man with baby blues posited with a twinkle.
A shade of uncertainty gripped his lips shut, his jaw working from one side to the other in recessed thought.  He shook his head and waved him over to the long overburdened food table on the backside of the house.  “Let’s put that down before she takes you out at the knees.”
Not needing to hear that demand twice, he followed Mick down the hallway and showed him with his digits, tongue, and heart that Mick was his whole world.
“You can’t tell me they aren’t up to something.  They’re kicking us out so fast – it just doesn’t sit right.”
Dean waved him into a long office lined with wood paneling right out of the seventies and closed the door behind him.  He gestured towards the chair closest to the desk bogged down by an overflowing inbox at the center of the room.  With arms crossed over his chest he sighed and looked at the brown cardboard box in Castiel’s grasp.  “You gonna share with the class?”
A sudden hand on his shoulder corralled him back into the physical world and the brothers stared at him aghast.  Cas ducked away from Dean’s touch and stared at him still disoriented and a bit quailed.
The thin light in the room kept him from seeing much more than his head tossing side to side.
She nodded at him, “They always said you were clever, Winchester.” She paused and turned her attention to above his head like she was staring at the window he wished he had.  She peered at her phone and put a finger up to her lips.  “Well, thank you for answering all my questions.  I’m off to make your partner squirm like a worm on a hook,” she said, but remained seated.  She turned her phone face up and pressed a couple of buttons.
The now silent angel snickered behind his coffee mug.
“What for?”
“Hi, Charlie,” she grinned, the tension escalating and good sense leaking from her ears all at once.  “Uh, are we ready to go?  Not you and me,” she fumbled.  “I mean everybody.”
Sam frowned and scooted closer on the couch, letting his hands fall away.  “Listen, Mick.  It’s true, none of this simplifies matters, but I believe in you.  You can make the right choice and you have nothing but my support every step of the way.  Even … even if you just want that to be as a friend.  I am willing to fight for us… fight for you, even if you won’t fight for yourself.”
She had the documents pulled up on her screen he sent her earlier.  With an endearing perplexed expression, her eyes ran over each filed from bottom to top, side to side, and at a diagonal, filtering it through different encryption and light filters before the light bulb above her head flared.  “You see this, too?” She pointed at the deep blue digital markings going up and down the right hand side above where the file markings should have been.
“Hey Dean… You got a minute?” Sam asked, his tone a load bearing structure of apprehension.
“We tell him the truth: shoring up our security was never about keeping him out.  You know that’s what he thinks by now.  The guy obviously has no idea the Men of Letters are still an ominous threat here, too.  The longer we let him think we are pushing him away, the more he’ll believe it.”
The library table was almost pleasantly warm after a few minutes of laying on the sturdy hardwood surface.  Even though it was just a run through, mild jitters ran up and down Sam’s extremities upon setting eyes on the future home of the still malevolent force resting in his abdomen. He put a palm on his belly unconsciously, straining to feel the presence where Cas had rearranged his intestines looking for it earlier in the day.  To Dean’s amusement, all he accomplished was forcing a stomach gurgle out of him.
“I doubt Cas will disagree,” he said winding his shoulders back in an awkward yoga stretch after hours hunched over countless manila files.
A sheen of embarrassment glossed over his face.  “I have to admit I don’t know how much I said out loud to you and how much I told Pileggi when he stopped by my recovery room.  At the safe house I divulged it all, not sparing a single detail.  If there was a chance the info could expose that bastard, clear up my name, give me any shot at getting back my life, I was going to take it.  In the end I was quite lucky,” he mused.
“From what I can tell, the Men of Letters gathered knowledge on everything: science, nature, magic, art, music, technology – like the early twentieth century version of that popular search engine.  A lot of their texts are concerned with both the natural and supernatural world.  I’ve found books on vampires and werewolves and faeries and brownies and a whole host of things I’ve never heard of.  The Malkuth were the Men of Letters of angels, but seemingly had no moral compass when it came to methods of procuring information.  Those methods left a body count.”
