The brothers dug in. Dean quickly started moaning at the taste and stuffed more into his mouth, giving Tony a thumbs up. Sam ate leisurely, pausing between mouth fulls to complement Tony.
“Dean! We’ve seen things that most people couldn’t even dream about!” Sam’s voice matching the teen’s, all thoughts of getting dressed gone.
“He said, ‘if we’re found guilty,’ Steve. We didn’t do anything, so they can’t take anyone,” Tony growled as he began pacing the length of the conference room.
“Why should you even care?” Loki attempted to pull his arm away halfheartedly, with such little strength that Dean had the thought that it was merely a formality to the other boy to try and get away.
Gathering her courage, Natasha bit down again, this time at the man's neck, almost immediately letting go as she was splattered with more of the man's blood, feeling it spray the air around her as the man screamed.
"I know you're not fond of men, Nat, and you have good reason to be," he started. "But this may be your last chance to stay with Clint. If this doesn't work you'll have to go into group homes."
The man sighed and stood back up, leaning against his desk. "If you're feeling too overwhelmed right now to talk, that's alright, we can take a break and come back. Or, if the problem is you don't know why you did it, then that's okay too, and we'll give you time to think about it before we revisit this conversation. But Loki," Tony stepped up behind the teen and slowly placed a hand on his shoulder. "We are talking about this eventually."
"My dad said he drank to forget the people he lost. So that means you drink too, right?" Sam stared at his hands, somehow looking even smaller.
"Thank you for letting me help you, sweetheart. My car is just down the street, where we just came from. Can you guys walk that far?" she asked, standing up.
"No thank you, Dean," Clint responded with a small smile. "I'm gonna go ask Sam to play on the xbox instead. I really only had a couple questions left." The boy picked up his things quietly and made his way out the door.
“Look, boy,” Bobby sighed once they were out of range. “I’m sorry for how I left things. It– aw hell I need some more Jack for this. The sentiment still stands, get out of the life and never look back, but I shouldn’t have been so hard on ya.”
"Ha! I win!" Tony raised his arms in a victory. "You're done being a dick for today, alright?" He pointed sternly at Dean.
"Then the invitation is extended towards yourself as well Dean. Any time you'd like just say the word."
“Oh, thank God, Dean! You’re alright!” Steve rushed to the teen’s side, forgoing the chair and sitting on the edge of the bed. “Oh, Dean, darling we were so scared!”
The family laughed at the innocence of the question as Steve answered. "Her teachers are aware of the situation and she has other assignments instead." Steve was glad to see Nat smiling at the boy instead of being offended at the question. Dean on the other hand was staring at Steve again.
"Doesn't mean that Dean does too," Steve finished. Walking over to the bed, Steve crawled over top of his husband, resting on his elbows to look down at the genius. "I think we should at least talk to the man. You said how he was pretty much a father figure to the boys, right? How he even taught them to throw a baseball?"
The man froze, aware that the slightest of movements could set off the teen. Hell, Dean probably didn't even know where he was right now.
“That’s what I thought,” Dean spat and let go of the other teen’s arm, not caring to make sure the other was following before making his way back down the stairs.
“Alcohol? I haven’t had a sip of alcohol since I came here! I would never bring booze into an alcoholic’s house!” Dean was close to shouting. Though his eyes were still glassy with fever, he was now alert and pissed at the implication that he’d do something so stupid.
After a moment of pure shock, Tony placed his plate in the microwave and watched it spin. He thought about how wonderful his found family really was, and how much he couldn’t wait until things went back to normal.
“I made this sawed-off shotgun in third grade!” He explained, then realized what he’s just admitted to. “I mean, um–” the teen floundered to come up with an excuse as to why a kid would be making a gun.
"Oh yeah?" Steve smiled, then quickly threw his husband on their mattress and watched him scramble to get purchase.
“Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey!” Tony knocked loudly on the door to the boys’ room. “Sam, you better come downstairs for breakfast if you want to make it to school on time!”
"No, we're not thinking of doing anything like that," Tony stated. "But, we know the stress hasn't been great for everybody, so we just want to see how everyone is doing."
"Tony and I took the day off tomorrow to help you settle in. I'll drive the others to school then it'll be a day just for he four of us. To get to know each other better." Steve didn't miss the way Dean's eyes got bigger or the flinch the boy made. "For tonight, you two can do whatever you'd like. Hang out in your room, go for a swim, just relax. We'll go through specific house rules tomorrow, such as chores like clearing the table."
"Seven of us? They lookin for a big payout on foster checks?" Dean was scanning the house for any obvious signs of danger, not relaxing in the slightest when he didn't see any.
“Hardly,” Tony’s voice rang from the kitchen before appearing himself, joining the others in the living room. “We picked too many.”
"That's okay, sweetheart. I just want to tell you how much I love you and I'm going to miss you while I'm gone," Steve smiled, taking in Bruce's concentrating face.
"Dean. I've figured out what's going on with Dean. Well, maybe not all of it, a small part anyways-"
"I know what you mean. I was deployed in the Middle East some years back and we took leave in Europe a couple times. My best friend and I started one night in France and I get a call from him the next morning saying he's in Germany and has no idea how he got there."
“Same guy that called all of us, a Mr. Phil Coulson. He said the boys needed some support to put the old son of a bitch in the ground.” Bobby replied, then, looking directly at Dean, continued. “We may not have gotten on with John all the time, but being here for the two of you is something everyone here can easily agree on.”
"You have no idea how much I've missed you, kids," Steve whispered, basking in the glow of his family.
“How did you–” Sam paused, thinking a moment. “How did you stop thinking about it? How did you…stop being sad?”
"Tony," Steve interrupted, a small smile on his face. "As much as I love hearing your beautiful mind work, and I'm sure Bucky would absolutely love any arm you make him, I really need a distraction right now. Can we talk about the kids? What we're gonna do?"
Hanging his head, the teen obeyed, falling back into the soft cushions and bracing himself for the lecture about just how useless he actually was. Mr. Coulson knelt in front of the teen and braced his hands on the armrest, effectively trapping Dean in the seat.
"Because—" Dean sighed and threw himself backwards on the bed. "Because there are things that I just can't talk about with you, Sammy. You're my brother and there are things that I don't want you to know. It's—it's not because of anything you did, or that I don't trust you or—"
Of course, he thought the same thing when he hugged Loki at the airport for the first time, too. And when Dean accepted their invitation for adoption.
Steve gave a smile gasp and whispered "My ass. Tony, my ass is yours, please, please own it, please—" He cut off in a moan as soon as he felt his husband's long, lean and calloused finger push its way in his ass ruthlessly. When Tony had covered the finger in lube, Steve had no idea, but he didn't even come close to caring.
“If no one is Jewish, why the menorah?” Dean asked, eyeing the elaborately engraved item on the mantel.
The doctors and caseworkers wanted her to talk to them, tell them what happened. But she couldn't. They didn't understand that the words just
“Keep a good eye on him, Sam! We don’t want him getting any sicker,” Steve called over his shoulder as he pushed Tony out of the bedroom.
"Yeah! Then I warned him he'd get bathroom duty for a month and he asked if I could spank him instead! What the hell right?!" Steve ran his hands through his hair so many times it looked like a disaster. The man was pacing in Tony's workshop, trying to calm down.
Tony threw himself back into his chair. "You just had to show him the pictures first didn't you?" He accused Phil. "You know the answer is never no when he sees the pictures."
Christmas had passed in a flurry of food and presents, more than Sam and Dean had ever seen in their lives. The cheerful atmosphere was a pleasant distraction for the boys, for the week after held the funeral of their father. Upon discussion with the brothers, Mr. Coulson, Tony, and Steve had decided to have the funeral in Kansas and lay him to rest next to the boy’s mother.
Clint groaned dramatically and made his way to the staircase. "You know we all have phones for a reason right?" he called out.
They came to this house every day while mommy got her medicine to feel good, then they went to the park! It was like this every day.
That must have been what Mr Coulson was talking about 'everything you'll need to be safe is already in place'.
"Dean, have a seat." Steve gestured to the chairs Tony had rearranged to be in a circle of the room.
"Hey!" Tony snapped. "We haven't met him, we don't know where he is. You know you can't say things like that. It's not fair to the man." He chided.
"Good. Next. Clint was playing video games and didn't want to pause to greet you. Steve told him firmly to get his butt over to meet you. Did you see Steve touch him in any way to get him to comply?"
"Dean, that backpack looks heavier than usual today. Got any big projects due?" Steve asked as everyone climbed into the vehicle to start the morning commute.
Steve smiled at his eldest. "You're completely right. The next time you hear anyone talking like that about anyone you tell them why they shouldn't, okay? Stick up for people especially if they aren't there to defend themselves."
The ride home from the school was silent. Dean was scared to move a muscle the entire way. When they got home however, Tony couldn't even wait until they reached Steve's office.
Throwing his arms out above him in a display of dramatics, Tony groaned. "Why can't he come to us?" he whined.
"Open your eyes, Buck, look at me!" Steve begged, eyes brimming with the tears he refused to shed. Bucky's eyes opened, it seemed, without permission, as if the command were enough to control him. Letting the man focus, Steve stood completely still.
"It's a lot, isn't it?" Tony asked quietly, understanding that his husband just needed a moment to fall apart and support when he was done. Steve nodded frantically.
“Probably something to do with never feeling a part of a family when he was our age and wanting to give us what he never had,” Bruce speculated.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut as he felt a few tears slip free. He nodded slowly, before remembering that Bobby couldn't see him. Dean cleared his throat, then whispered, "Yeah, Uncle Bobby. I got it."
“Yes, Steve,” Tony responded immediately. “Because, honestly, you’re starting to scare me, babe. This isn’t you.”
Tony's eyes widened when he heard the unmistakable sound of a drinking glass on the other line when the man spoke.
Steve's face was pinched in concern, before shaking himself and started explaining gay relationships to Sam. He was very calm and sported a smile the entire time. Answering any questions the young by had.
That's all a nine-year-old Natasha could see as she let the sound of low grunting and squeaking wash over her.
Dean tuned out his little brother, occasionally muttering 'uh-huh' and 'that's so interesting'. He just needed to wait until Sam went to bed. Dean needed to talk to his foster dads. Preferably before tomorrow.
"He asked," the man shrugged in response, pouring himself coffee before joining the rest of the family at the table.
Sam leaned into the embrace offered by Tony, whereas Dean brushed off the hand Steve placed on his shoulder, constantly fighting back the tears threatening to spill. Many well-wishers stopped to convey their condolences to the Winchester boys, most wearing flannel or plaid and carrying a bottle of alcohol.
"I have some exciting news, everyone!" Tony announced when everyone filed into the kitchen for breakfast. "Papa saved Uncle Bucky yesterday!"
"Geography. Why are all the countries so small and close together in Europe! Can't they just all join one country and call it a day?" Sam dropped him head on the table dramatically, making Steve chuckle.
"Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answers to," was the quick response. "I wouldn't worry about that though. They've got good heads on their shoulders and wouldn't do anything stupid."
, Tony." Steve clutched his husband closer to him and tried to tell him how much he needed this with his tear-filled eyes.
“Hey, everyone! How was mass?” Tony called out from in front of the fireplace as the troupe returned from the Christmas mass.
"Every day," Steve confirmed. "You don't have to accept, do whatever you feel comfortable doing, but know that if that's something you want, we're just waiting to sign the papers."
Dean blinked, surprised. “Um, I think everything? I mean, I wouldn’t really know if I forgot something, but nothing is really too blurry–”
Every time the two had been in this situation before, Dean nodded silently and watched Mr. Wilson rage and pace, all the while cursing those that dared to hurt a child. Now, though, the man simply slumped in his chair, crushed and close to tears. The teen stared in astonishment as one of Steve’s old subordinates planned the prosecution of the country’s beloved Captain Rogers–his own commanding officer, no less–and the man’s genius, billionaire, (former) playboy, philanthropist husband, the famed Tony Stark.
"Nah. Sammy's the smart one, I'm the pretty one." He winked at his brother which made him giggle into his salad.
Dean couldn’t care less who or where that came from. His stomach hurt–he needed it to stop hurting! The hand was back, cradling his forehead, and another was on his back, soothing him through every hard heave.
"How can I help Sam if we don't talk about you, Dean?" she asked, calmly. "You're his hero, his protector."
"I ain't sayin' anythin' of the sort, Stark, calm down, just that there are things that you don't necessarily need to know."
Two other men clad in hoodies rushed in and gathered the sheet, struggling only slightly with the weight of it, then passed the three on their way out without even a glance.
“It’s not about that, it’s–” Tony paused, the man of many words struggling to come up with the right ones.
On a related note, I'm wondering if anyone is interested in betaing a one-shot I wrote in this universe that's going to be released after this one is done. If you are, let me know!!
"I've had some setbacks. I've had them before and I'll have them again. The reason for them is irrelevant and I know that Sam and Dean leaving would do so much more harm than good. They stay," Tony read for the others.
"I have like, one naked picture of me. You have like twenty!" the boy responded, laughing as well. The brothers were pulled from their musings with the arrival of the rest of the Stark clan.
The teen nodded, eyebrows pinched together, heavy with thought. "I– I have to think about it," he finally responded.
“Steve?” Sam whispered with his face pressed to the man’s chest. “Do you think Dean is gonna be mad at me?”
But enough of my pity party, I’m doing great! I figured out how to poop unicorns and sell leprechauns! Seriously, don’t worry about us! Focus everything you got into bringing home your kids' new uncle!
Steve shook his head and shot a glance to his husband. "Bottom line. Those are unfortunately quite common, and one of the reasons Tony and I go to therapy, to learn how to avoid and control them."
With a small nod, the teen left, leaving the couple to an empty kitchen and the sounds of their kids through the walls.
"Bring me some real food, I'd rather go back the gruel they fed me as a prisoner than the torture I'm supposed to eat here."
You’re doing something incredible and I love you for it. Your heart and your sense of duty are two of the main reasons I married you and I’m so happy to see it in action.
The captain thought for a moment, then shook his head. "In any case, I don't think we're going to change anything right now. Visiting hours are ending at ten, I think I'm gonna go spend some time with Bucky tonight if that's alright."
The two clutched each other tightly as they kissed, rubbing Steve's still cloth-covered erection over Tony's red and aching one.
"Dean I really like it here so far. Did you test them at dinner?" Sam asked as he flopped on his new bed. Every first night at a house Dean would throw the family with every supernatural test he knew of just in case they were living with monsters.
“Do they have a date?” he asked, mildly. He had a feeling of foreboding, but didn't want to throw a tantrum in front of Steve.
Weddings could be lovely, sentimental, beautiful, joyful, fun, solemn, and dignified; and many people longed to enjoying the perfect wedding that will fulfil all their dreams of a happy ever after. But they also involve people. And where there are people there is also bound to be trouble. Trouble caused not by ill intent but by clashes of high emotion as all those hopes and joys, fears and anxieties, jealousies and insecurities come and melt together and boil over...
Steve loved Tony. Of this there could be no doubt. Friends and strangers alike could see it in every tender glance, in every exasperated groan and eye-roll, and in every sneaky brush of his hand against Tony's arm or chest when he thought that no one was looking.
Tony was more interested in the scroll than in the bird. He picked up. It felt smooth to the touch. He briefly examined the seal and then tossed it to Steve. It looked as though it could be long message.
“No. I proposed when I did because I don't want to risk losing you. Ever. I can't live without you. Not one day. It's always been you, Steve Rogers, and always will be. And what I went through, the terror of nearly never seeing you again, was so great that there has to be some payback.”
Thankfully, love is strong and can prevail over any pettiness. Love, kindness, trust, friendship, understanding, and forgiveness would win over all other things.
Steve held onto to him tightly, resting his chin on top of his head. Tony never really liked it when he did this because it made feel aware of his limited height, but he would graciously allow it if he sensed that Steve was upset about something, as he was now. He wrapped his own arms around Steve's waist and waited for an explanation.
Together they brought out the best in each other and smoothed over the rough edges. They worked together to overcome any difficulties they faced; they supported one another in their endeavours and kindly criticised when they felt the other was wrong; they comforted and consoled one another when things went wrong; and would laughed when the time was right.
Steve chuckled. “I wonder how long they've been engaged for? They were probably just as surprised as we were to find out that – where did that raven go?”
The other man just smiled and pushed his pants down another inch, just enough to get access to his balls. With one hand on his balls and the other on his nipple, Steve alternated between gasping and moaning while Tony clutched the sheets in desperation.
“So, can I keep the gun?” Dean asked, very aware of the conversation he’d had with the foster parents his first night.
“No promises, but I’ll do my best,” Dean replied, which was not the answer his parents were looking for, but they knew it was the best they were going to get from the teen.
The man furrowed his brows together at hearing their native language and sat back down on the desk chair. "Bróðir, hvað er að?" {
Tony watched the teen submerged in memories for a moment. “He did a great job. Did he look after you and Sam a lot?” The man risked prying into the brother’s past.
"This." Tony made a vague gesture to Dean. "All of this...stupidity. You're a smart kid Dean, why are you being a dumbass?"
Steve watched his husband trying desperately to keep it together to support him, and realized that what he, himself had been trying to do since he got back, wasn’t being strong for his family at all, but falling apart slowly without even realizing it.
The soldier's eyes misted a little as he gasped silently. "Uncle Bucky, eh? I like the sound of that," he whispered.
"Well, he handed the company over to his son right before we left on that last mission. His son Tony," Steve concluded, studying his friend's reaction.
"Dude, what the fuck," Dean snapped, not caring to lower his voice since they were now alone in the library.
By the time he returned to their room, it was five o'clock in the morning. Exhausted, Dean crawled into bed and set his eyes on their door, determined to protect Sammy.
Steve watched as Sam shuffled out of the room, the boy looking back at his brother once more before closing the door on his way out.
"Okay, then off you go! Explore the house! Let us know if there's anything you need or if you have any more questions!" Tony shooed then off, then reached for his husbands hand. "I think we got this."
“Sorry, um,” the Captain cleared his throat and began speaking again. “They just don’t want to risk his heart giving out from the stress or something.”
There came an overwhelming cry of:"Papa!" Sam and Clint were currently trying to climb the man in attempt to hug the man, and the others were in various places in the kitchen getting dinner ready.
"Honey. Love. Studmuffin. Have you seen the size of your dick? It's gonna be a hell of a time getting it in little old me, the least you can do is let me ogle you like an expensive stripper," Tony teased.
"John would give me this nod to let me know that I did something right. Sometimes he would say 'good job, sport', but those were far and in between and for things like staying up all night with the shotgun watching the door while Sammy slept. Those were the only times I ever truly felt like he cared about me," Dean started. "Even when I got suspended for fighting or came home high off painkillers, I have never
"Fuck yeah, it does." Quickly, Tony bent over and swallowed the member whole, almost choking when Steve bucked the tiniest amount before regaining control.
Steve cleared his throat again. “Uh, yeah. Yeah, it is. But that’s why they’re waiting, to give him the best chance, ya know?”
"Although," she continued, walking up and joining them at the table. "We need to talk about your execution. It only took them, what, half an hour to find their clothes? You can do better than that."
Dean was even enjoying his therapy sessions. Not that he took them seriously, no he was having the best time fucking over the sweet young therapist they assigned him too.
"How ya doin' babe?" Tony whispered, caressing Steve's cheek lightly. The blond nodded, giving a small smile.
Tony on the other hand was studying Dean. His face was unreadable as he looked the teen in the eye for a long moment, before joining the conversation.
“Tony,” Steve whispered, “I can’t lose them. We can’t lose those kids.” Tears gathered in his eyes. “They have complete jurisdiction over Sam and Dean! Even if they don’t find us guilty, they’re gonna take them away!”
"And we'll kill you and replace you with him," he mused, throwing her down on the floor. "He's old enough now that a dick wouldn't kill him if we prepped him enough. Plus we'd get more money from the closeted governors that like little boys. You don't got no dick, bitch."
"That's right. We would never harm any kids, ever. Let alone our own. And like it or not, for the time being you're included in that category. Do you understand?" Tony was now sitting so close to the edge of the couch he could reach out and easily touch Deans hand. He wanted to. The poor boy looked so confused.
"Well," Sam broke the quiet in a small voice. "What if we made him some 'get well soon' cards? That way he can know that, even if he's not ready to meet us, we're supporting him anyways?"
that there was a family that loved you as much as we do to take you in and take care of you. And to give you the love and attention that you deserve.”
The man shrugged. "What good could it have done? You were literally half a world away, I'm telling you now that we can do something abou—"
"Dean! Laptops! This will make research so much easier!" Sam ran to the furthest desk and started fiddling with the computer.
"No offence, but I don't really want to take that chance," Dean laughed right back. "Breakfast. Downstairs."
"Yeah, it's been stressful," the boy admitted, looking at his lap. "But, Dad, Papa, I think they need us. They're our brothers, and they need our support. I don't want them to leave where we can't be there for them."
Sam's face lit up and he turned towards Dean. "Did you hear that Dean! He'll help train you! Dads gonna be so happy when he comes back!"
“I’m fine, Sam. One of ‘em just threw me around a little. Nothing a needle and thread won’t fix,” the teen whispered back. Seeing the bedroom door open once more, Dean exclaimed loudly, “Thanks for the soup, Sam! It was delicious!”
I already have quite a few chapters written, and my beta’s working as fast as she can! She says she's sorry for the wait!!
“Sometime next week, that’s why we had to move up the adoption,” Tony answered. “Any other questions?”
Clint found out that he also had an older half brother, named Barney. The ten-year-old took his father's ideals and wanted the siblings gone, going so far as to pinch Clint whenever no one was looking so he'd continuously cry and make their father upset. Natasha made sure that the older boy tripped whenever he passed her.
"I'm afraid this rule is one of the most important Dean. If you have a weapon, you're a danger to everyone in this house, and we won't stand for that-" Steve argued.
"I love you so much," Tony whispered, giving his husband the softest kiss he could muster on the man's pliant lips. "Are you sure you want this, hun?"
"I guess so! I mean we really won't know how this will effect him until we see a change or something, but I really hope this works." Steve grabbed Tony's hand. "I really want this to work."
"Clint? What's going on with Clint?" Steve's voice raised in concern. Nobody told him anything about Clint.
Steve smiled and rubbed the teen’s knee before returning to his seat. “You need another breathing session, just let me know, sweetheart.”
Drawing on his training, he fought the instinct to tense, staying perfectly still and relaxed as he took stock of his surroundings. Slowly opening one eye, the teen just about jumped out of his skin.
Steve was stunned into silence. The two of them sat there while Steve struggled to speak. The man pulled out his phone, typed something, then set the phone on the table between them. He then covered his mouth with his hand, and the two sat in silence once more.
"Aside from codependency with his brother and some abandonment issues from their dad leaving, his therapist and case worker are convinced he's a perfectly happy ten year old kid. Loves reading apparently."
“Dean! Look over there, it’s Pastor Jim!” Sam pointed across the field. Low and behold, there the man stood, talking to another man clad in plaid.
"Great job Thor, we've got our hands full at the moment, can you please bring Nat to the gym? Maybe help her work it out?" Steve was talking very gently and quietly. "Tony? Bruce needs your help right now, I'll tend to Dean."
The rest of the table thoroughly distracted, Steve took the chance to get Dean's attention. "Hey, I know this is a lot, do you need to call Dr. Mills?" he whispered.
The young boy hid his face as he replied "I'm not really a fighter. I do more of the research. Dean is the really strong one."
Thor resembled a giant puppy as he gleefully smiled at the boys before heading up the entryway stairs.
“Well,” Dean heard, “Pepper timed it. She could sit in the next room with a stopwatch, but heaven forbid she actually help me. ‘You got yourself into this mess; you can deal with the consequences,’” the voice poorly parodied the shrill sound of a woman. “I mean, she was right, but seriously. I felt like I was dying. She could’ve at least given me a glass of water!”
The other man chuckled and dropped his gaze to his lap. "You know I always wanted kids," he muttered. "And-and I'm not sure what's gonna happen with that now, but-"
Steve squeezed his eldest son’s shoulder tightly. “Phil is doing everything in his power to get him here, Thor, you know that.”
"Dean, you don't have to tell him all of your secrets. Hell, you don't have to do anything at all, but giving Sam those tools to figure out what's really going on is only going to help him, both now and in the future." Jody once again gestured for Dean to sit, which he finally decided to do.
Natasha studied her foster father's face, taking in the sincerity with skepticism. She held out her hand for the phone, which Tony readily gave.
doubted how much Steve and Tony care for me. Hell, even when I'm getting punished they still tell me they love me and that I can come to them with anything."
"You're gonna give your dad a run for his money in the brains department, huh? It's wonderful to meet you, Bruce."
The blond continued, tracing down his stomach and slowly unzipped his pants, letting every sound it made echo through the room, building anticipation. Undoing the button, Steve pushed the pants down an inch or so, just enough for his pubic hair to peek out and leaving the top of his crease exposed. Turning back around to face his husband, Steve ran his hand down his front, letting his thumb get caught in the tent poking through his undone clasp.
Dean nodded, expression unwavering, but Steve noticed that his hand shook as he opened the bedroom door.
"Have you seen her ass, bro? Girls can be as bitchy as they want as long as they have an ass like that."
"Hey, Sam?" Dean called out. The teen was sitting on his bed, fiddling with his phone as he watched Sam pack his backpack before getting into bed, the nerd. Dean had come back from his therapy session only a couple hours earlier and had been working himself up to actually have the talk with Sam.
Tony laughed as he took off his coat and hung it in the hall closet. "It sure does, bud! Hey, do us a favour and get your brothers and sister in Papa's office for us, okay?"
"You're–you're invitin' me for the kid's birthday?" the voice lost some of its edge, slipping into a soft tone.
Dean nodded slowly, then looked away from the man. “I thought you didn’t want me anymore,” he admitted.
"Visiting hours end at nine, but I can be home anytime," Steve answered as he began to clear the table. "I'll pick up the kids and be home for dinner at the normal time, then if nothing's happening I'll head back for a few hours. If that's alright?"
"Thor will leave them in your room for you," Tony reassured the brothers. "In the meantime, welcome to Casa del Stark!"
"We can clean up in the morning, Tones," Steve whispered, already half asleep. "I need you here with me right now, tomorrow be damned."
"What are you learning about in your classes?" Tony asked, trying to get more information from the boy.
"Look," Dean started, turning to face the man, "I get it. You see two brothers alone and you immediately think the worst. But a)I'm 18, I can take care of my brother when our dad is working, and b)our dad is gonna be home any minute. He only left on a business trip. So thanks, but no thanks."
Congratulations to Ebbys91 who figures out the woman in the last chapter with the crying 2-year-old was in fact: Kate and Adam Milligan, and to Beakers47 who noticed the reference to 1.04 Phantom Traveller with Dean on the plane!!
"Becky Walters? Seriously? She's my age! That's disgusting Dean, you pervert!" She shouted at her foster brother.
“Dean! I thought you were sick?” Bruce questioned when the teen entered. The 18-year-old was passing pancakes to Clint, who was already covered in syrup.
"She wanted it?! Just because you wanted it, you–" Natasha was grabbed around the middle by her father before she could storm over to the boy.
Steve opened his eyes slightly and winced when Tony gave a small squeeze. "You, Tony," he breathed. "It belongs to you."
Running up to his big sister, Clint hugged her around the middle, not noticing her stifle a gasp of pain. "Did they hurt you again, 'Tasha?"
Once upon a time he would’ve said the words in anger, but he was tired. Tired of the world kicking him down and expecting him to get back up again.
"Um," the boy dropped his hand quickly and stared at his plate before speaking. "Dean told me last night that you want to adopt me?"
He finally found a hunt half an hour away in Jersey City. It was obviously a werewolf case; there were reports of wild animal attacks in which the victims' hearts were missing. The killings had gone on long enough for hunters to catch wind of the situation, and nothing indicated that the carnage had stopped, so it was the perfect time and place to stake out some hunters!
"Dean, you're safe. We just pulled into the garage, and now we need to get out of the car. How about we get you into bed? Would you like that?" Tony spoke gently, approaching Dean as he would a young child or perhaps a skittish deer.
It was getting harder to breathe as Dean realized he was fighting off tears. He wanted to push the man away, but he couldn't remember the last time he'd just been held like this. It felt really damn good. Steve never pushed him away or said anything, he just kept rubbing Dean's back and held him tight, ready to hold him for as long as the boy needed.
"There's nothing that-" Loki stopped and stood up and walked away from the man. "I don't want to do this. Just give me my punishment so I can go."
“Oh, I forgot to mention, Bruce and Clint’s therapists mentioned that they might benefit from a joint session. Something about shared experiences.” Tony informed his husband.
"Is everything alright?" Bruce asked, head coming up from a book he'd taken from the Captain's shelves.
“Steve,” Tony’s voice was shaking as he rested a hand on his husband’s shoulder. “I think we need to take him to the hospital. Who knows what could’ve happened? All Sam said was that Dean got hurt and that’s why he took the pills. He could be bleeding internally, or broken a bone or-“
Forgetting the trials of the day, the family gathered to eat their late dinner and sit in silence as the movie commenced. Mr. Coulson was giving Dean glances occasionally, watching as the teen threw his crust to the box violently and braced his head on his hands and pulled on the strands of his hair before leaning back to continue to feign to watch the movie.
“Did–did you end up taking the codeine?” Dean needed to know that Tony hadn’t relapsed because of him. He couldn’t ruin another family like that–not again.
Dean's next therapy appointment couldn't come soon enough. Marching through the door and slamming it behind him, the teen exploded.
that someone needs help, you have to tell someone, Samuel.” The huge man knelt down and placed a hand on the boy’s shoulder, uncharacteristically somber. “Even if they say they are fine, there is no harm in getting someone with knowledge and experience to voice their opinion on the matter. When it comes to someone’s health and safety, nothing is more important. Do you understand, young one?”
The agreed-upon time of midnight came and went. Dean stared at the clock on his home screen while sitting on the living room couch with a container of salt and matches sitting on the coffee table in front of him.
“You think I don’t know when one of you leaves the city? I knew the second you were in the cab.” Dean supposed this was Phil’s way of explaining, though it revealed nothing.
The man smiled slightly, stepping forward to embrace Mr Wilson. "Good to see you too. And you know I'm bored out of my mind!" He replied with a well meaning punch to his friends' arm. Mr Wilson turned back towards the boys.
"Dean," Mr. Coulson's voice was low, but the prompt was enough for the boy to pause and turn towards the man. "I know something else is going on. Now tell me. What's wrong?"
Closing the folder, Mr. Coulson ran a hand down his face. "There aren't many places that will take both you and your brother, Nat. We've already tried three places!"
“When I–yeah, I remember that. Why?” The teen was truly confused as to why they were talking about his lack of coordination. “I was feverish and the concussion didn’t help, why–”
I wanted to take this time to say a huge thank you to everyone who comments on every chapter!! Your words are fuel for my love of this fic!!! If you haven't commented yet, please let me know your thoughts and ideas on what you think is going to happen!
"They've already been to eight. The longest they stayed in one was four and a half months. All of those foster parents except one couple are now either in prison, in hospital awaiting prison, or on bail awaiting trial." Phil's eyes glared down Tony's, already knowing those kids were coming here.
Natasha eyed Dean warily. "No," she replied, "but I'll talk to Becky before school tomorrow. And I have an appointment with Dr. Hill tomorrow night, so I'll see what she thinks."
"Yup. Dumped a vial of holy water in the water jug, watched as everyone sprinkled salt on their food and the cutlery was already silver so I didn't even have to replace it." He responded, flopping onto his own bed.
“Thor is pagan and celebrates the yule, Tony is a self-proclaimed ‘futurist’ and doesn’t observe any religious holiday unless we create one specifically honouring him, and Bruce, Clint and Natasha are Catholic,” Steve explained, making his way through the room. “I’m Protestant but it’s close enough to Catholicism that I go to the kid’s Christmas mass.”
Steve pulled away from the kiss and rested his forehead against Tony's chest, breathing hard while his husband ran his hands up and down his back and arms.
The room was filled with gasping and the sound of sucking. Occasionally, Tony would need to catch his breath and began kissing and licking his husband's cock and the surrounding areas before returning to his main task.
"Come on, Bobby, pick up," he whispered as he brought the phone to his ear. Dean figured that if anyone knew where their dad was, it was Bobby. However, the phone didn't even have a chance to ring. Instead, an automated voice could be heard saying that the number was "no longer in service," and to try again. So he did. And he tried again. And again. And again.
"Of course, what is it Dean?" Tony's eyes widened in surprise as he sat up further in their bed. The men watched Dean come further in the room, closing the door behind him and leaning against it.
"Look Dean," Tony reached for the teen's hand. "Just because something feels good, doesn't mean it's good for us. My body aches for things it can't have every day and it sucks! But if I have those things they'll kill me. Does that make sense?"
Steve’s expression hardened as he seemed to reach a verdict. “Dean, I know when someone is lying to me.” Captain Mode was beginning to engage, the man’s voice and posture becoming more rigid. “Tell us the truth, or we will look for those pills ourselves.”
Steve smiled softly. "Yeah, bud. Get daddy. But instead, you chose to throw something and you could have hurt someone because you didn't think through your actions. Does that sound right?"
The man did not look as happy to see Dean as Dean was to see him. The engineer was wearing a tank top, jeans, and sneakers and had goggles pushed up into his hair. His arms and face were covered in a black substance. Clearly, he had been experimenting in the workshop before he came.
The captain walked forwards and pulled the man into his embrace. "Hey, enough of that. He's gonna love you."
He sighed, then, brows furled in confusion and more than just a little pain, asked: "Why didn't he give that to me? Why didn't he give that to us?"
Seeing tears beginning to well in the teen's eyes, Mr. Coulson moved his hands to rub Dean's shoulders. "Hey, hey.
Thor tore his gaze away from Dean to look at the fire. “I should like to celebrate this next year with my brother. He tells me the hospital he stays in does not allow fire on the premises and has watched me light this fire on video every year we’ve been separated,” the man finished.
“Um,” the teen looked down to work at an oil stain in his jeans. “You remember our Uncle Bobby from the funeral? He owns an auto salvage yard and taught me how to fix up old cars and stuff.”
"Everything is fine." Steve raised his arms in a 'calm down' motion, moving to take a seat behind his desk, with Tony following behind.
“Dean, darling,” Steve interrupted. “Every person in this room has some form of abandonment issue. You leaving as you did might’ve triggered some people, but it had nothing to do with
"Thank you for last night, Tones," Steve muttered into his husband's hair. "It was exactly what I needed."
Gripping Steve’s and Sam’s hands, Dean held his breath and waited through the turbulence to (hopefully) land safely in the state he once called home.
Steve hung his head and wiped his eyes with the hand that wasn't clinging to Bucky's remaining hand.
"You go, I'll stay here and keep Dean company. That alright sport?" Tony asked the boy. Dean nodded and smiled at the man.
Sticking out his tongue at his brother, Sam still cradled the piece of plastic and metal. "It wasn't about the sport. It was the fact that we stuck around long enough for me to finish the season with the team," the boy explained. Dean stopped laughing.
"What?" Dean exclaimed. "You were convinced he was out there! Like, two months ago you asked when he was getting us!"
"A deal? What deal would that be?" Steve slowly drew the covers off himself as he prepared to get off the bed.
“He– he told me to ‘play the little rich kid game’. To forget about him and move on,” Dean spat, eyebrows furled in frustration.
“Stop it!” Dean interrupted, shaking Loki slightly. “Just stop it! I’m done with you trying to push everyone away and putting yourself in danger instead. I’m not just gonna leave you alone while there’s a fucking ghost hurting you.”
The boy sniffed, attempting to keep from crying even harder. "I don't know," was his honest response.
Steve dropped a hand on Dean's back and started to soothe the boy. "Shh, it's alright, just breathe. Take your time."
Steve beamed and turned to look at the door, as if he expected them to come back. "They really are, aren't they? And they love you Bucky!"
It had been about a month and a half since Bucky was rescued, and to say that the man had problems would be an understatement. The terrors in his mind caused him to blackout and relive the torture, or other times he just shut down completely, so the times where he felt like himself, he jumped at the opportunity to meet his best friend's world.
SURPRISE!!! I know everyone was super excited to read the next chapter, so morrismsteph and I hashed out the next chapter early!!
She'd almost forgotten she could see the colour without the darkness of night and the sound of violence. It lingered on the outskirts of her vision, but if she tried, she could almost pretend it wasn't there during the day. Until she had a half-day of school and came home earlier than expected.
The girl abandoned the punching bag and stormed towards her father, her eyes murderous. "You said I'd be safe here! How could you bring that disgusting, dangerous man into our house?!" Natasha screamed.
Steve placed a hand on Dean's shoulder. "Yes, you do. And now that your little brothers are gone, how are you really?"
"That's not how this works, Loki. You need to give me permission to come in, remember? This is your space and if you don't want me here, we go somewhere else."
Dean nodded. “Unfortunately, when ghosts haunt things, the objects have to be completely destroyed or else they’re not going to leave. So yeah, you’re not getting that ring back in one piece.”
Tony reached out and grabbed his husband's hand. "Hey, he also has all of us," he whispered. "Right kids? We're gonna give Uncle Bucky all the support he needs, right?"
"I fucking–I fucking knew this would happen! I told Steve that seven is too many! That we needed to think about the other kids, how you would affect them, but no! No, he just had to get attached to the stupid fucking pictures," Tony was muttering to himself now, completely unaware that he was speaking aloud for Dean to overhear.
In response, the man pulled out his phone and typed for a second, before returning the object to his pocket.
“Thanks for the soup, Sam! It was delicious!” the soldier heard as he crossed the threshold. “Can you bring the bowl downstairs for me? I’m afraid I’m still on bed rest, according to Captain Muscles over there.”
"Well?" The soldier took a breath to steel himself. "What are we waiting for? Let me meet the guy you're pounding into the mattress every night."
“I’m sorry to interrupt, but I don’t think we’ve met yet,” Steve interrupted, offering his hand to the man. “My name is Steve, and this is my husband Tony.”
“Shh, I know. It fucking sucks. Let it out. As much as it feels like shit now, at least it’s coming out at all. I remember there was one night–well, I guess it was morning–where I was over the toilet for five hours. I timed it.
"Symmetrical?" Bucky chuckled. "Are you flirting with me? You're husband's here, sweetcheeks, might wanna wait before you bust out the flattery," he winked playfully.
After hesitating for a moment, the teen slowly lifted the chain from around his neck and pulled the front from underneath his shirt. When the end of the necklace appeared, it was revealed to be a man’s ring adorned with diamonds and rubies.
“Hey, love machine,” Tony’s voice was like a spring of fresh water washing over Steve’s spine, loosening every fiber of tension he didn’t realize he was carrying. “How goes the Buckster?”
“No!” The outburst got both of the adults to pause and look at the normally soft-spoken boy. “Dean is my brother and he’s not going anywhere without me!”
"And I was kidnapped in Afghanistan and lived in a cave for a few months. I get panic attacks and live with anxiety." Tony offered. "Mental illness isn't something to push away or hide. It's a real part of us and everyone in this family has some need for help."
"Alright, buddy," Tony sighed as leaned against the door of Loki's room. "Let's talk. Is it alright if we talk here or do you want to go to Steve's office?"
“Tones?” Steve choked out, almost embarrassed with how little control over his voice he had at the moment.
"Okay," Steve sighed, picking up his car keys and putting on his jacket. "We'll talk more about this later, I'll call you from the hospital if I can, okay?"
“How are you fine with this?” Dean asked his brother, finally taking the offered mug from the engineer.
"Loki," Dean, started, setting down the laptop on the chair beside him and pushing up the sleeve of the arm, revealing more of the marred skin. "Loki, who's doing this to you?"
Dean heard the door shut as Tony left and huffed in annoyance. Tony was right. He pushed himself up slowly, testing the wound, and found that it was like every other set of stitches he had: yeah, it hurt, but nothing to bitch about. By the time he had finished getting dressed and brushing his teeth, he heard the kids calling out farewells to him up the stairs.
The girl was pulled from her musings by her stupid little brother, Clint. The three-year-old didn't understand why mommy left them alone.
The teen's head shot up so fast it took a moment for the world to stop spinning. "How do you know my name?"
“I better be getting some or I’ll hold you down and sit on your face instead.” Becky teased back, making Dean moan and his hips jump.
They were torn apart by a voice calling out for Steve, making the taller man sigh and finally let go of the embrace. A group of men in their army best saddled up to the two.
to get dressed up for this?” Dean muttered. “I mean it’s not like god is gonna smite us if we show up in jeans.”
"No thank you Steve. I want to stay with Dean." Sam didn't even glance at Steve as he watched Dean sit up.
"Relax, darling," Steve called out, elbowing his husband playfully and making sure the sheet covered the both of them. "You can uncover your eyes, you're not going to see anything you shouldn't."
"Okay Dean," Tony started, pulling his eyes away and looking at Deans face. "Why don't you explain what that was about."
"Hey, shh," Tony lifted Steve's head back up and waited until the other man opened his eyes once more. "I love you so much it hurts. My first thought in the morning and my last thought at night is of you. I would give away
Steve sat at the table beside Dean, leaving Tony to sit next to Sam. "Okay, so here's what's gonna happen today." Steve addressed the boys. "Right now we're going lay out the house rules and you can ask any questions you want. We promise to be completely honest with everything we tell you. We'd also like to know more about the two of you, so we'll ask you some questions too, but know that you do not have to answer questions you don't want to. We would prefer you to say 'I don't want to tell you' over you lying to us. After that, the entire day is yours! Go swimming, check out the library, play video games, go crazy! Understand?"
“I’m guessing we just have to accept that. In any case, if you used your allowance to buy it, just a reminder that that’s not why we give you that money. Spend it responsively and all that jazz,” Tony sighed as he ruffled a hand through his hair.
"Mine? Oh, honey, you were always mine," the engineer replied as he leant down to tease his husband's chest with the tip of his tongue. "This right here?" he flicked his tongue in the hollow of Steve's throat. "Mine. This?" He nipped lightly at the man's Adam's apple, "Mine."
Dean couldn't sleep, not with leaving things like that with Sam. He listened for the boy's breathing to confirm he was, indeed, asleep, then quietly threw off his covers, grabbed his phone, and went to the bathroom.
Tony sighed. "It hurts me to know you're not happy," he admitted. "I want to do everything I can to just take away your pain, but I can't."
The next night, after making several high priority phone calls and greasing only a couple of hands, Tony managed to move Sam and Dean’s adoption hearing to the following weekend. The only hurdle was then talking to the kids and telling the boys.
"It's Percy Jackson." Dean interrupted, staring at his lasagna. "His favourite is the one about the labyrinth."
Check it out! Things are a little different since I literally read it years ago, but I need to give credit for the entire universe my characters are playing in!
The man managed to explain away everything about the Winchester’s life without exposing the couple to the real dangers of the supernatural. He was fucking good!
Eventually Dean managed to successfully push down the tears and moved away from the man. Steve kept his hand on the teen's shoulder.
Putting his phone back in his pocket, he expected the conversation to be over, thus surprising him when his phone went off once more.
The sight that greeted Steve was so...extraordinarily ordinary that he had to fight down his welling emotions. The kitchen was covered in pancake batter, spilt milk and flour and the table was covered with sticky syrup that, usually would've earned a sigh from the army Captain, but today it just garnered a smile. This. This is what he fought to protect. This is what he would always fight to protect. This is what he thought about every second he was gone, what he was hoping and praying to come back to.
Boxes of decorations were strewn over every surface of the large gathering room with a giant evergreen pine tree now standing bare in the far corner.
A long, deep sigh came from the phone. "Dean, this is your chance to get out of the life. You're still young; you've got your whole life ahead of ya! Carry holy water and a knife at all times, but forget we exist!"
“It definitely would’ve been,” Clint confirmed, only to be met with a look of fake betrayal from his father.
Dean reached into his pocket and pulled out the bottle. Tony quickly snatched the pills and immediately poured a couple tablets into his hand.
"If you are not in me in the next two seconds I will get out the dildos, I swear to god," Tony swore, nipping Steve's lips.
Dean blew out the breath he was holding, thought for a second, then pulled his younger brother up to look him directly in the eyes. "Not at all, Sam. Steve and Tony give you so much more than Dad ever did. They tell you they love you, they drive you around every day, they keep up to date on all your little clubs," he paused, "it makes you human."
"Yes, Tony, we're doing this for Dean," Steve interrupted, answering the question for the fifth fuckin' time. Steve held both the receipt with Bobby Singer's number on it and his cell phone in the other hand, his husband draped across his back blowing in his ear. "Stop it, love. Later, I promise."
The day the family had waited two and a half months for was finally here: Steve was coming home. He was flying over in an army plane along with a sedated Bucky, who (in no small part to Tony,) had been transferred to the closest private hospital in New York.
A lot of the dialogue in this chapter is straight from an episode of Supernatural, bonus point if you can tell me which one!!!!
Steve reached for Tony's hand, puppy dog eyes in full force. "Abuse Tony. We can't let them keep going through this!"
At that, the boy simply slumped back down into his covers, choosing, it seemed, to ignore the man and his words. Steve studied his son a moment longer, then continued to eat his steak in silence as the teen once again drifted off to sleep.
He jumped and almost threw his phone against the wall when it rung broke the silence. He took a breath to calm down and answered. “Hey, hun.”
Bucky squeezed his friend's hand and smiled, then let go to offer his only hand in Tony's direction. "Sergeant James Bucannan Barnes, of the US army, and this punk's best friend."
Steve was beat red as he opened the door again, refusing to look Dean in the eye as he sat in his chair once more.
"We're gonna go home." The girl's voice was emotionless, mechanically holding an arm out for Clint to grab onto.
Blinking, Bucky followed the direction of the voice, settling his eyes on his saviour, the one person he wanted to see every damn day since he fell from that helicopter. He opened his mouth to ask if it was real, but a hitching sob is all that escaped.
Dean snorted into his food in a half laugh half embarrassed choke, remembering his and Tony's conversation just the other day.
Steve blocked him and put the letter in his breast pocket. “Trust me, there’s nothing other than talk about the kids in here. But seriously, I really doubt you wanna hear about douching.”
Dean, for his part, was starting to fall asleep again. He knew he ought to be more worried about how much he was sleeping, because of his concussion, but at the moment, he just couldn’t bring himself to care.
Dean saw something hit the paper, and realized it was a tear. Putting down the paper and wiping his face, he looked up and saw Steve and Tony staring at him, silently asking if he was alright. Nodding to reassure them, Dean replaced the note in the envelope and ran his hands over the steering wheel.
The engineer rubbed a hand briefly over the boy's shoulders. "I getcha. Want us to take the attention off you for a bit?"
Steve and Tony brought over huge stacks of crepes, immediately drawing the attention of the siblings.
"Hey, you take what you can get," Bucky laughed along with him. "There's my Stevie. Or, is it Tony's Stevie now?" he teased.
“Actually, it would be a huge help if you could get Tony for me. Then you can help Thor and Nat start dinner, okay?” Steve didn’t want the boy sitting beside his sick brother with nothing better to do than worry, so giving him an idle task was in Sam’s best interest. The boy nodded quickly before fleeing from the room.
The line fell quiet as Steve and Tony held a conversation with their eyes, both agreeing in the end.
"My name is Steve, and this is my husband Tony," the older blonde introduced himself while holding out his hand to the boys. Sam shook his hand politely, then Dean took the offered hand and squeezed. Steve had the bluest eyes he'd ever seen, and the biggest smile too.
"Painkillers. Keep the bottle, you'll need them with the hit you took. They're pretty strong, but I'm sure you've had worse, right, Dean?"
Every time she left a session with Dr. Hill she saw the colour. Sometimes it was sharp and painful, others it was faded and dull. Dr. Hill said the less she saw the colour, the better she was getting.
"This means that you have to give us any weapons you have now. And if you hide any, trust me we'll know," Steve said, letting go of Deans hand. "We can do that after we go through the rest of the rules."
"You little—" the man reached for her neck, wanting to strangle the young girl. Before he could, she darted between his legs and climbed up his back, feeling him struggle to get a good hold of her to throw her off. Natasha pushed down her fear of the man and focused entirely on Clint's safety. She didn't matter. Clint did.
Cling paused, then shook his head. "No, Papa, I just...he said I was 'simple' cuz I didn't read the books he did, then kept using these big words so I didn't know what he was saying."
"One and the same. And let me tell you, with as many fights as this punk got into, I should get a damn medal."
Her once favourite colour was now the source of her nightmares, fueling her fear and hatred for the men that hurt her and the unjust world that let them.
"And what do we do when someone is bothering us?" Steve asked, he couldn't help but smile at this small problem he was helping to fix. No matter what's going on in the rest of the world, Steve knew that his kids needed him, and that was the best feeling he could ever ask for. "What was that? I can't hear you, sweetheart," he prompted again.
"Fair enough," Steve calmly replied, not rising to the boy's bait. "Anyone else you'd like to invite?"
“I was Protestant long before I knew I liked men, and it was very hard for me to come to terms with my sexuality.” The man began. “However, I believe that God doesn’t make mistakes and that people do, so the fact that the church is against homosexuals doesn’t mean that God is.”
Unfortunately, the one second he turned to look for his brother was the one second Nat needed and she caught him with a blow to his chest, bringing him to the ground. Nat jumped on top of him and was about to cause him further pain before her weight was lifted from him rather suddenly.
"Kid you have too many daddy issues to start throwing that around. And fuck yeah they are. He says mine are the best though. He loves the beard burn he gets between his ass cheeks when I eat him out for hours." Tony shot back. Steve quickly stood up and left the room.
"For fuck's sake, take the damn pills, kid," Rufus scolded as he started the truck. Dean popped open the cap and downed three pills dry, too distracted by the prospect of finally getting some information on his dad to fully consider how many he was taking. Besides, the hunt was over and he was in pain, dammit! It wasn't until he was in the cab headed back to school that he realized three might've been too many.
He pushed the skimpy fabric to the side and ran his finger down her folds with one hand and pinched her nipples with the other.
That's how the police found them hours later with the news that Clint's dad had driven the rest of the family into a tree, leaving the siblings, once again, without a home.
Becky clutched at his shirt, pulling her closer to him. With one hand at her ass, Dean used the other to start fondling her breast, paying special attention to where her nipple would be under her bra.
Dean whipped around to face his little brother. “Hey, it’s okay, Sammy, we’ll get through it,” he assured the boy, wrapping an arm around his shoulders.
Steve, Tony noticed, looked much better than he had hours earlier, the tear tracks gone and mussed hair straightened, looking much more like his usual self.
Steve squeezed the teen’s hand and kneeled in front of him. “Breathe with me, Dean. In. Out. There we go, good job. Again. In. Out.” The captain coached his son until the boy’s breathing evened out once more, watching as the panic faded.
“Uncle Bobby!” Sam shouted in excitement, running towards a bearded man in a worn baseball hat and a flannel shirt under an unzipped vest.
"Yes. He enlisted just a month before I did. Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes. But I always called him Bucky. We grew up together in Brooklyn. I lost him in the war." Steve lowered his eyes.
get to take us away from the only home that’s actually felt like a home since the one our mother went up in flames in.”
"I don't need anyone to protect me," she started, glaring at the two other teens before her gaze softened ever so slightly. "But thank you, nonetheless."
"We would never, ever raise a hand to you Dean. We told you once and we will keep telling you until you trust us enough to believe it." Steve was aching to pull Dean into a hug and just protect him from the world.
The man didn’t comment on the hitch that developed in the teen’s breathing, or the fact that Dean held the soldier just a little bit tighter. The two stayed there, enveloped in each other, the stillness only broken when Steve would run a hand over the boy’s back or turn to kiss his head again.
The boy nodded. "That sounds like my dad." He peeked up. "So there are other people like that too? It's not just him?"
"That sounds really stressful. Having to take care of your little brother and not know how you're gonna feed him or what's going on with your dad."
“Everyone calm down,” Tony stood up and tried to get the children to settle down. Steve, on the other hand, was overwhelmed and hid his face in Sam’s hair.
With a laugh, Steve replied: "I highly doubt there's a gift shop in the middle of the desert, Clint."
Soon, the forks slowed and the meal was over. Bruce started collecting everyone's plate and Sam and Dean quickly stood to help him.
Dean shook his head frantically, hurrying to pull himself off the floor. Managing to get his chest on the bed, the teen was just able to swing his legs up, as well, before gritting his teeth and rolling over onto his back. It wasn’t easy, and he was sweating by the time he was done, but he did it.
"Yeah, stupid science," was Dean's response, which got the reaction he was hoping for when both Sam and Bruce took offense and started to explain why science wasn't 'stupid, it's the building blocks of life! How can that not be fascinating?'
"Just drop it Sam, and quit tryin' to get in my head!" Dean snapped, throwing the shirt harshly to the floor.
No more words were spoken that night. Dean listened to the sound of Sam lying back down and rolling around in the covers until he eventually did fall into a fitful sleep.
“Bullshit? Aren’t you supposed to be a child therapist? How would the parents react if they knew you were so crass? Or are you just being naughty for me?”
He went looking for potential hunts in the nearby area, but unfortunately, there was nothing in New York City. If Dean had to guess, that was Mr. Coulson's doing.
Natasha watched blood dripping from a different man, this one her foster parent. He approached too quickly and was going to hurt her and Clint, she just knew it.
Dean angrily started getting himself ready for bed, almost ripping his shirt in his carelessness to get it over his head. This couldn't be happening. Sammy doesn't get to know his ticks, he doesn't get to know when Dean's lying. He can't. He can't.
A sigh. "Yeah, I knew. Those boys deserve better than an old coot like me takin' care of 'em. I thought, hey, there's a chance they'll get a white picket fence, why not let them at least try?" More distinct sounds of glass moving on the other end of the line.
"Their oldest sons are 21 and 18, so don't worry about feeling lost, they'll have plenty of time to focus on the two of you. As for money, trust me, these guys do not need any more. You will not be going without here I can promise you that. Tony is CDO of his company Starktech, and Steve is a former Captain with the army. He teaches history at NYU now to fill his time."
"I've read it. Come on, I'll make sure you get a passing grade so you don't bring down the grade point average of the house by inventing plot lines and similes."
"Yeah, well ya got one now. Ya mom didn't want ya no more so she left yous two wid me. Only problem, I can't afford to take in a couple a bastards out a the kindness a ma heart. So, yous is gonna have ta work." The man was eyeing Natasha in a way that made her skin crawl.
Phil stepped back to let the group into the house. "Welcome to the Stark residence. Have a seat in the living room, I'll go get Steve and Tony."
It was once again Dean and his thoughts. The teen tried to calm himself, but his breathing was still hard and his hands clenched the thin bedsheet.
The teen snapped his gaze up from the floor to look at the woman once more. "If he knows when I'm hiding something, I can't protect him," he finally admitted.
"Um, yeah. He's—" Steve hesitated. "You remember Howard Stark? The guy that created our weapons for the unit?"
"Yes, but that has nothing to do with you." Tony took a step forward carefully. "We fought for a wonderful boy who had to live through something unimaginable and needed a home full of love to live in. Someone who needed good parents that would do anything to make him feel safe and happy. That's why we fought so hard, Loki, because you deserve much more than you'd been getting."
"I missed you all so much too, I can't even say how excited I am to hold all of you again!" Steve was overjoyed at seeing his kid's faces for the first time in weeks that he didn't even care that he had interrupted a conversation to take the call. One of the men made it apparent that they were waiting for him to return, though, with a pointed cough.
"You do whatever you want to me if you don't touch Sam." Deans voice dropped off and silence filled the room.
The seventeen-year-old furled her eyebrows in thought for a moment, before pulling out her phone and shooting Tony a text.
With a groan, the boy pulled off his shirt and sat obediently for his sister to clean him. "Hey, 'Tasha?"
“Dean, come on. You need to eat.” Tony nudged the lump of a boy with the corner of the tray in jest, chuckling at the tongue said lump presented him with.
"I can't pretend to know what's in Natasha's mind. But we can ask her. How about we go to the gym and check up on her? Both Thor and I will be there to intervene should she want to hurt you again. Hopefully we can figure out what happened." Steve suggested.
“Awesome, as much as we really want you to be a part of our family forever, that’s not the only reason we’re pushing it up,” Tony continued. “Steve?”
Clint's father, however, claimed that Clint was still too young for school and it was decided that he would watch the boy at home while the rest of the kids gone. That first day, Natasha was greeted with a big smile and a tackled hug from her younger brother and it warmed her to know he was happy. She didn't need friends, she had Clint.
Dr. Hill made her realize that there were specific actions and feelings associated with when the colour was near painful, and when it was manageable. Fear and helplessness was a given, but she also discovered she felt lonely. And sad.
Knowing exactly what his brother was talking about, Sam stopped what he was doing and looked at Dean. "Yeah?"
"Yeah, if you can. I'll catch a cab from there." Dean climbed into the man's truck, wincing at the pain in his side.
"Dean what the heck? I was just asking a question!" Sam pushed his brother away from him, annoyed. The older boy blinked a couple times before looking up at the couple.
Dean didn't have a response for the man, so he gave him a forced smile and shoved the receipt into his bag. "Thanks, Rufus, and thanks for the–" He shook the bottle of painkillers in lieu of finishing the sentence.
“Dean,” Steve tried again, pausing to kiss the teen’s hair. “Know that there’s absolutely no need to thank us for anything we do, especially for loving you and Sam. Know, that for as long as there’s life in my lungs, I will love you with every breath I take. But you’re welcome all the same.”
As always, I have to thank my wonderful beta morrismsteph for spending hours just expanding and editing this world I've created in my head and helped me put down in words!
Tony simply smiled and gave the man another soft kiss, before sliding down the bed to position himself between Steve's legs.
Steve took another step closer to Dean as he asked "Dean? You can say no if you don't want to, but may I give you a hug?"
"Do you need me to sit with you until you fall asleep?" he offered, knowing that the boy wasn't even close to okay.
Tony wrapped his husband in a hug and kissed his shoulder. "I know. I feel the same way. I would die for those boys in a heartbeat, same as Thor, Bruce, Loki, Nat and Clint. In everything but paper they are already our sons." Tony whispered.
Only, every window sill had salt in its casing. Every door had a mat in front of it that had a protection warding burnt into the bottom. The whole house was already protected.
Steve rolled his eyes and agreed. The engineer confidently walked into the room, but only made it so far as leaning on the wall beside the door.
Tony chuckled and held out a steaming mug towards the teen. “Yeah, I getcha. We made some hot chocolate for you guys.”
"Oh, shit, Steve, is everything okay?" Tony began panicking. "It's Bucky, isn't it? He didn't make it?"
“We know,” Tony sighed. “Unless you have any business you would like to attend to, or any questions you would like answered, you should be returning to bed, young man,” he instructed.
Posting an extra chapter because I'm headed across the Atlantic for a few weeks and I don't know when I'll be able to update!! So be patient and I'll do my best, other than that: see you all again after Sept 18th!
“Well, I mean, I would’ve. And– everyone was so–distant–after that.” Dean waved a hand in the air, vaguely.
Steve silently gasped and squeezed the boy even tighter, letting a few tears escape in his joy. "Thank you, Dean," he whispered back. "I know what a gift that is, and I will do everything in my power to earn it."
“I still say it wouldn’t have been ‘obscene’ or ‘over the top’.” the genius defended, handing out the drinks.
Panting, Steve rested on his elbows hovering above the man's dripping wet cock. The soldier's face was covered in spit and precum and flushed from arousal and exertion. Taking one look at his husband's debauched face, Tony pulled him up to kiss him, not caring in the slightest that his beard was getting covered in his own spunk.
"I am your math teacher, Dean, that's right. Now, why don't we go for a walk?" She offered him her arm, and Dean gave her a huge smile and wrapped his arm around it.
Steve nodded, his happiness radiated off of him like heat. "Guys, this is my beautiful, genius husband Tony. Tony, this is my old team."
Despite every instinct screaming to keep that door shut, the teen cracked it open to see Steve and Tony right outside.
Steve shifted Tony so the man was sitting properly in his lap before leaning towards the boy. “Why do you think that?”
"Did Steve tell you what I said earlier?" He asked. Tony nodded. "Good than you can answer my theory. I think you and Steve switch bottoming, I mean Steve's ass is to die for, but I'm guessing his dick is amazing too."
Dean rolled his eyes and set the glass on the table. No need for his bed to get wet when fists started flying.
Dean shook his head and Sammy called "Nope!" from his desk, already engrossed with the new technology.
"Oh, Sam!" Steve stood quickly and raced around the table to meet his son in a passionate hug, the man holding back tears of joy.
Dean let the hurt surround him. The pain that he never permitted himself to feel now coursed through him, every nerve on fire and every thought a razor blade. The codeine in his system only enhanced the sensations, smashing the mental walls that usually kept such emotion at bay.
The blond blushed. "Um, that was Tony," he explained, looking at his hands, then through his lashes, continued. "He's my husband."
"With the years of counseling I have ahead of me? Maybe, but I don't wanna go to my kid's high school grad when I'm fucking sixty," Bucky laughed. "But what I'm trying to say is, that you having those kids? Me being an-an uncle… Well, it's something that was meant to be, and so far, it's just as good."
Steve blinked, then shook his head. "Sorry Sam. I forgot about that until just now. It feels good to remember the good ol' days." The soldier smiled at the boy and covered a smaller hand with his own. "He was so confused! He said he was going to take a bus to meet me at the hotel, then next thing he knew he was waking up to an old man yelling at him in German. He swore he traveled back in time to the Second World War until he got out his smartphone."
"No, no, as much as I love that beautiful mind, I'm not letting it go there," Steve interrupted. "I love you, and nothing Bucky could say would get me to feel anything other than that. Yes, Bucky is my best friend, he is my brother, Tony, but you are my husband. There is nothing either of you could say to get me to change my mind about the other. Heck, I'm worried about if you guys will hate the other and not tell me because you both love me too much to tell me."
The girl's brows were pulled together in thought. "But–why would she–?" Nat took a deep breath and started again, "Dr. Hill says that sex is something meant to be shared with someone you love and trust. Becky doesn't know Dean. How could she want it?"
"Nope, I'm designing it. The idea is there, I've almost already finished it in my head. Unless, of course, if you want to hook it up to the central nervous system as well, that way he would be able to actually have sensation in the limb and not just mobility-but that would mean hundreds of thousands of sensors as small as nanobots on each of the fingers and-"
He just wanted Dean. He needed to know his brother was okay. He needed Steve and Tony to tell him Dean was okay, and to hold him if Dean wasn’t. He needed his family.
The older boy frowned and searched his memory. "What do you mean? He hasn't said anything to you like last time, right?"
"When you have secrets to hide, you learn not to let anyone close enough to care," the teen snapped.
The colour was back. She wasn't even trying to talk but the world was suffocating her again. Every thought was put into remembering how to breathe, forcing air into her lungs.
Slowly, Nat nodded, glaring at the officer to promise unspoken pain if she were lying. Despite her mistrust, something about the woman, whether it was her smile or her kind eyes, reminded Natasha of her mother. If the officer did put her in prison, at least Clint would be safe and cared for. Natasha didn't matter. Clint did.
"Unfortunately. But, because he's no longer on a secret base: he can call us!" the man announced, earning another loud cheer.
As Tony disconnected them, Steve heard one of the men scoff softly and mutter under his breath: "fuckin fags."
Steve started placing all his things on the unused side table for tomorrow and leaned forward to kiss his best friend's forehead in farewell. "Not this late, Clint, you know you get nightmares."
Nat nodded and turned herself and Clint around to follow the woman. As the siblings climbed in the car, Natasha closed her eyes, and let the feeling of freedom overtake her.
The man dropped the bags to the floor, no notice or care where they landed and scooped his youngests in the tightest hug he could muster.
Steve glared half-heartedly at his friend. "Because what kind of example would that set for my children?"
Dean, who sat beside the boy, placed a hand on his little brother's arm. "Sorry dude, I wasn't paying attention, didn't mean to spook ya. I'll clean it up."
“Do you trust us to stop anyone else who might want anything like that from you?” Steve continued, as if the confession hadn’t filled him with so much love he thought his heart would explode.
"I already did, bud. But the military doesn't trust me since I stopped giving them weapons of mass destruction, so they've banned Papa from bringing anything electronic on the off chance it could be used for contacting, oh I don't know, his husband and kids," Tony grumbled, stabbing his broccoli with more force than necessary.
"Good. Everyone here is so nice it would suck to have to kill them. And this house! It must be so nice to be rich! Do you think they're gonna have to move us again? I hope not. Bruce is really smart! He started telling me that our entire body is made up of something called atoms that-"
"I figured it out!" Steve exclaimed as he kissed his husbands cheek. Tony, on the other hand, had no idea Steve was there and paperwork and tools alike went flying as he jumped out of his chair in surprise.
Loki studied the other teen once more, before muttering in his slavic native tongue. "Alright, but don't say I didn't warn you," he took a breath and straightened his posture, looking Dean dead in the eye. "It's Odin."
“You didn’t realize? You stopped being a jerk when you and Steve started sparring,” Tony reminded the teen.
“You protected him. Not just from your abusers, but from the dangerous environment you grew up in. You shielded him from the horrors of the world, the despicable things that people are capable of. Mr. Wilson told us about how you told Sam your foster parents were vampires, and how
Just like Dean predicted, Loki didn't change his stripes after their talk. The other teen was sullen and bitter in his grounding from Tony, but he didn't lash out or actively insult anyone for a good week after the incident.
"No! We are not exposing him to our home and endangering our other kids just because Dean wants his drug supply open."
She smiled at the man that had been so patient and kind through every temper tantrum and setback she had, and responded: "Yes please, Papa."
The girl bowed her head to hide the tears threatening to overtake her. She needed to talk to Dr. Hill, this was a feeling she'd never experienced before. Almost… happy? Proud?
"Oh." Sam whispered. The men saw that he was deep in thought, and simply waited for him to process the information. "Do you think my dad could stop drinking like you did Tony?"
"Dr. Hill is right–that is absolutely what sex is. However, for some people, it can just be about having fun." If Steve felt uncomfortable talking about freewheeling sex to his daughter, he didn't show it. The man was a pillar of strength for his children in that moment. "Do you remember the story that went around about dad a couple years ago? The video that was leaked?"
"Because you still don't trust us, I will let you have one knife. But. You keep it in a locked box under your bed and you never take it out unless you fear someone's life is in danger." Steve conceded. "And, you give it to us when you trust us."
"I'm not sure, bud. It's really hard to beat an addiction, and I'm really lucky that I had so much support to get me through it." Tony answered. "But, I'm sure that with enough support, there's definitely a chance."
Steve was worried about Dean. Really worried. He hadn’t known the brothers for more than three months, but he just knew that Dean and drugs didn’t add up. The history professor’s morning went by in a blur, and before he knew it, he was back home, climbing the stairs.
Tony was frozen. His arms were extended, as if to try and help Dean stay on the bed. The man’s mouth was open in shock, his eyes wide, his breath ragged and hard as he stared at the young boy who, delusional with fever and coming down off a high, mustered up the strength to avoid his touch.
"Okay. Nat. She, admittedly, doesn't talk much. We're working on that, but we let her do what she's comfortable with. When she refused to speak to you did we get mad in any way?"
As the brothers pulled on their new (expensive, holy fuck) suits, Sam prattled on about what the church service would be like.
"Early. My plane leaves at 0500, which means I probably won't see any of you in the morning. I'll say goodbye to everyone before you go to bed, though," Steve smiled reassuringly at all his kids. "Look," he started, "I know you all want me to go, but this doesn't have to happen, I—"
"Steve," Tony responded, the same amount of adoration lacing his voice. "Steve, I love you, and it's wonderful to see you again, but honey," Tony paused. "You look like shit."
Her hands were loose at her sides, her stomach wasn't twisted into knots and her thoughts were far from the horrors in her past.
“This really is important, Dean. Would you be willing to consider getting tested with us in the room with you? Keeping you safe?”
"All right," the blond sighed. "Malnutrition, surgery for the misaligned healed fractures, stitches on your back from the..."
“Hey,” Dean’s voice softened, his protective instincts kicking in. “Don’t worry about that. I’m watchin’ out for ya.”
“Not important?” the genius interrupted, then sighed running a hand down his face, smearing grease across his forehead in the process. “Steve, you need to take care of yourself before you try taking care of everyone else. This has been a traumatic and stressful time for you, and-”
Sam studied his older brother. "No, you're jokes are usually you telling the truth in a way other people don't understand. What did you mean?"
“Are you sure it’s enough?” Dean asked sarcastically. Looking out at the decorated living room, the Stark family admired their work. There were tinsel and garland over every inch of the tree and wreaths and flowers hanging from the walls, and stockings hung below the glamorized menorah on the mantle of the fireplace where Thor’s Yule Log rested, just waiting to be lit.
“Attitude? Dude, when I give you attitude, you’ll fuckin’ know it. I ain’t pussying around with you here. Just buzz off, okay? I don’t need you to take care of me,” Dean sighed and braced himself for the incoming blow, knowing that apologizing would have just made things worse, but that rejecting the man probably hadn’t helped any, either.
"It's okay to have boundaries, Dean. If he brings something up that you genuinely don't want to talk about, just tell him that subject is off the table for the time being," she suggested.
"'Tasha says we're gonna make a home!" he smiled brightly, with all the joy an innocent child could muster.
"Screw nice and gentle, you promised you'd let me feel it," Tony whispered, sinking his nails into his husband's back, ensuring the long red lines would last at least a couple days.
"And now we talk about why. Why did you say those things, Loki?" the engineer sighed. "Clint is already so self-conscious about how smart he is, you had to have known you were saying things that were hurtful."
Deciding to take a page from Dr Mill's book, he sat up and placed his hands on Sam's arms, finally looking directly at him. "Because that's how things work in a healthy relationship. Sometimes things are kept secret between people and that's okay. There are also things that are really hard for some people to talk about, like how we don't ask Natasha about why she doesn't talk. Make sense?"
"Sam finished off the rest of the cereal yesterday and was complaining he was hungry. Can't let the poor kid starve." Dean ran a hand down his face, exhausted. He hadn't properly slept since dad left, always watching and protecting Sammy, even when he slept.
"I mean it, anything, I'll cover for you! I know how to hide bruises, I don't scream that loud, no one would ever know!" An edge of panic betrayed the boys voice even as his face was a stony mask.
"Well then, you and I are kinda the same there. Apparently a lot changes in a decade and trust me, it feels like I'm experiencing this country for the first time too," Bucky smiled.
“Hey,” the engineer’s voice hardened. “You didn’t let me hide away with my emotions, like ever, so payback is a bitch. Just tell me what’s going on in that head of yours right now.”
"Aye, you've reigned in your aggression marvellously. Dr. Sif always tells me to ask myself why I am angry and what can be done instead of violence to rectify the situation. I believe you've taken these words to heart, fierce Natasha," Thor congratulated his sister, loosening his hold on the girl. "And if you ever have need to ask questions about making love and do not wish to talk to our parents or your therapist, know I am always available!"
Steve sighed and hunched over to rest his chin on his hand. “Yeah, they’re taking him in for surgery soon to see what can be done for the infection in his arm, they’re just waiting for him to be more stable so they don’t risk him-”
Dean motioned for Loki to stop the boy, rolling his eyes when the other boy only muttered: "Thank the gods."
“We had a right to be upset, and to talk to you about it. If we found that you did it on purpose and just for fun, then we had a right to punish you, but you didn’t take those pills for fun, did you?” Steve asked. “You took them because you were in pain.”
“Dean? Dean, sport, we really need you to wake up to make sure you’re okay!” Tony was hovering above the teen, almost scared to touch the feverish boy.
“Your mom died when you were four in a house fire right?” She inquired. Demeanor completely different from before. Dean relaxed. Of course that’s what she was talking about.
"Who are you?" Natasha asked, jumping back. A tall man with an unbuttoned shirt loomed in the doorway, staring at the kids and making the girl's skin crawl with an unknown feeling.
"Can you nod to let me know you understand?" Dean slowly nodded his head. "Okay, then." Tony quickly left the room and shut the door, already dialing.
“Are you kidding me?” Tony asked as the two were cleaning up from breakfast one day. “That’s literally all it took was some exercise? Why the fuck is that all it took?”
The next few weeks were boring, to say the least. Dean and Sam went to school, they came back, they did their homework, ate dinner as a family, chill, go to bed, repeat.
“Then why are you still burning up?” Tony asked sarcastically, though a frown creased Steve’s forehead.
“So Loki, my best friend growing up was named Bucky. He was practically my brother in every way but blood, saved my life more than enough times to earn it,” the man explained, smiling and losing himself in his memories. “Well, when we turned eighteen, we both enlisted in the army. I made my way up to Captain and him to Sargent. We led three tours together before an extraction went wrong and he fell out of the helicopter.”
The man inched closer, reading Natasha's face as to how close was too close, before reaching for her hand and holding it lightly. She stared at the hand in wonder, squeezing it tightly after a moment. Tony was a man. Tony was supposed to come with fear, but she felt...safe?
“Dean?” The teenager was left stunned at the sight of the engineer. The man was usually unkempt when he was down in the labs, but now he was wearing an Armani suit with the shirt untucked, the pants and jacket ruffled, and the tie askew. Not to mention Tony’s hair–usually perfectly styled and coiffed–was much the same as Steve’s–wild.
The kids filed in one by one and smiled at the man in the hospital bed, who had convinced Steve to bring in a barber to cut his hair for the first time in years, so he would look his best for the occasion.
"What?" Dean lifted his head to look at the shadowy form of the ten-year-old. "Why not? You're already calling them–"
"I was eleven when I was started college. I started drinking at twelve and taking drugs at thirteen. I had sex for the first time when I thirteen with a nineteen year old. At the time I thought it made me cool. That I was an adult that could make my own decisions." Tony placed his hand under Deans chin and held his gaze to his own. "It wasn't until years later that I mourned my innocence. I was thirteen! What the hell did I know about life and love? That girl couldn't have cared less about me and it nearly destroyed me looking back on it."
"These guys are the best. I had to pull a lot of strings to get you guys a place here." Mr Wilson started leading them to the house as he talked. "Their names are Steve and Tony, they're married and have adopted four kids already with their hearts set on another one as soon as paperwork goes through."
The boy's head hung so low, his words were beginning to muffle. Steve ran a hand down Dean's back in an attempt to comfort his son.
"Fyrirgefðu, allt í lagi? Fyrirgefðu að ég er svo mikill skítabróðir og að ég meðhöndli þig svo miklu verr en þú átt skilið því þó að þú sért stundum sárþjáður, þá ertu mjög góð manneskja og lætur mig líða örugglega. Og, og takk fyrir að koma með mig hingað og leyfa mér að taka þátt í þessari heimskulegu fullkomnu fjölskyldu og reyna svo mikið að gera mig hamingjusöm og, og-" {
"She–" Dean glanced at the man and his two foster siblings before hanging his head and saying as quickly as he could, "She was begging me to keep going, not to stop, to go faster. And she asked if I had a condom."
“Did your family celebrate anything?” Bruce inquired, setting down his box and looking at the brothers.
"Okay. Tony and I had an idea last night, though. If at any point to need to step away for any reason, we could have a code word that would let us know to draw the attention from you so no one would notice. What do you think?" the man asked, gaze unwavering.
“You will always be John’s son, Dean. And Mary’s too. Now you just have a couple of extra dads to give you the love that they can’t give you themselves anymore,” the man whispered, rubbing his thumb across Dean’s knee in comfort.
Dean looked up in surprise. Dr. Mills was a no-nonsense person, she'd never said something like that before.
Tony gave Dean a small smile. “No, I didn’t. My sponsor held me back until Steve got home and took the bottle from me. I’m still sober and going strong, Dean.”
"Well, I mean, kinda?" Dean slumped against one of the shelves behind him. "Look, dude, I'm halfway through an essay about a book I didn't read, and I'm just learning about 'healthy sibling relationships' myself. Maybe ask your therapist? Or Steve and Tony? All I know is that I did what felt right at the time and I don't regret it."
Dean opened his mouth, and said nothing. He couldn’t tell him what actually happened. Not without putting his life in danger.
ALSO she is a WONDERFUL human being and found the original fic I read years ago that inspired this fic!!
As much as Dean could never believe that they would ever hurt anyone, let alone Loki, Dean had enough experience to know that you never judged a person by what you know about them.
"Minors. You believe he could pose a threat to us, Thor or Bruce?" Steve's eyes shot up his forehead.
“It’s because you’ve looked out for him that that he has a chance to be a kid and to have a successful future.”
Dean took a big breath, then let it all out before he answered. "I don't know. I'm sorry, I know you want me to talk to you, but I don't know."
"Yes, Tony," Steve bit back a laugh himself as he threw a pillow at the man. "That means we have to put on underwear to go eat breakfast with our kids."
Dean’s mind raced as he attempted to come up with a lie the genius and captain would accept, before he decided the truth was his best alibi.
“Yeah, looks like someone robbed the north pole in here,” he teased his brother as he removed his outerwear.
"Well obviously, genius! I meant what are we gonna say to him? He's never gonna believe us when we say we'd never hurt Sam." Steve stood up and was wrapping his robe around himself.
The house was easily the largest building the boys had ever stepped foot in. There were both indoor and outdoor pools, a formal dining room, a casual dining room, Tony's workshop, Steve's home office, a library (Sam's eyes had gotten as big as dinner plates trying to take in all the books so readily available to him), a home gym and Dean's personal favourite, a garage lined up with over twenty luxury cars.
"Clint, calm down, you're scaring Dean," Bruce shushed, giving Dean a small smile. "Dad and Papa know how to throw parties. As in, every party is tailored for that person. Clint gets a carnival, Nat gets the Russian ballet, Thor gets huge bonfires and I have a quiet dinner at home," he explained, watching Clint stuff his face with more food and nodding frantically.
“Shh, Sammy–it’s okay!” Dean reached out for Sam’s hand, gripping it as tightly as he dared. “You know how I get on painkillers. They knock me right out! Everything is completely fine! C’mon, you don’t–you don’t have to worry about me!”
"Okay, awesome. This is what we're gonna do, I'm going to state things you saw today and the logical explanation for them. You then tell me if it makes sense or if you have any questions and we'll go from there. Okay?" He waited for a nod. "Good. Now. When you came in, Thor was wearing a sleeveless shirt. Did you see any bruises?"
"My apologies if I frightened you young friend," the younger of the two huge blond men bowed his head to Dean. The teen relaxed his stance, but was still ready to fight at a moments notice.
"Nuh-uh, Tony," Steve smirked, gyrating his hips and pinching the other nipple, earning another whimper. "This is what you asked for, this is what you're getting."
“Dean, I would like to apologize,” Tony offered, which caused Dean’s head to snap up suddenly in surprise.
"Almost means not," the man scoffed. "Now tell me why you're here. The truth, too. I know when someone's lying to me."
“Hey Dean,” Tony whispered. “Is there anything we need to know about everyone here right now?” There was an edge to his voice that Dean couldn’t figure out.
"Are you sure you want to do this today Bucky?" Steve asked for the third time. "They'll understand if you're not up to it."
Surprisingly, all of what Steve says about the character's religion is true!! Although there’s some debate on whether Natasha is Russian Orthodox versus Catholic, but in one issue she was going to confession which is a very Catholic thing to do, so I ran with it.
“When we first started sleeping together. Actually sleeping,” Tony started. “Right before we both decided to get help.”
"Oh, Bucky," Steve sighed, squeezing his right hand tightly. "I know. I know," he whispered, letting a few of his own tears fall as he listened to the heart-wrenching cries of his best friend.
Another note, someone without an account commented a while ago that they made this story in their sims, if this is you (or you've done the same thing) please reach out to me! I'd absolutely LOVE to see it!! This goes double for any works of art or fanfictions anyone's done based on this world!!
Clint shrugged and shoved as much of the food into his mouth as possible before answering. "All bulls eyes all the time." Or, at least that's what everyone assumed he said around the food.
Nat paused, thinking about how she was going to protect Clint, where they were going to get food and shelter and how they were even going to get clean.
“We don’t know Sam. That’s what we’re going to find out.” With an apologetic smile, Steve raced past the boy to follow Tony into the garage.
“Well? Don’t keep us in suspense, what did the guy say?” Morita nudged the captain with his foot under the table. “We haven’t been on leave for a while, let us live vicariously through your boring marital sex life.”
"Oof. I'm taking that as a yes." Steve muttered as he pushed himself up again. "Okay." He got back down into fighting position. "Come at me."
"Good! I'm glad to hear it! How would you like to spar with me a few times a week?" Steve offered as he hugged the boy.
Her teeth sunk into the man's hand as he turned away, she felt the blood fill her mouth and she heard the scream of pain from the man.
How was he supposed to clean the wound now? He couldn’t have them hovering at all times. Knowing them, he wouldn’t even be able to shower without a chaperone.
"What do you mean 'you tempted them'?" Dean asked slowly, hoping to god that his little brother didn't do what he was thinking.
"Sure and the Easter bunny is totally real," he scoffed. "Look, I know how this works. You play real nice and all for the first few weeks, get us to trust you, get the CPS guy to stop looking so closely then you run out of beer and suddenly you're looking for blood. I know, I've been through this. That's why I'm offering for you to skip all that and just get to it. More fun for you. All I ask is that you don't touch Sam. That's it. That's the only requirement and I don't think it's such a bad one."
"What? Fuck. No. Of course not! Why would you- are you going to?" All of Dean's bravado disappeared when he looked up at his his foster parents. His green eyes full of such vulnerability and hurt that Steve and Tony's hearts broke simultaneously.
Steve smiled. "We do. I was a Captain in the army and saw a lot of hard stuff. I came back with Post Traumatic Stress."
The man was running on caffeine and less than three hours of sleep a night since the other man left.
“The audacity you have shown, coming into our home and accusing our parents of such a grievous act!” Thor bellowed.
“It hurts to see you like this, Steve, I’m not gonna lie,” Tony responded, starting to wipe his open face with the back of a dirty sleeve. “You know what this reminds me of?”
"Not yet, Buck," the blond laughed as he sat in his chair beside the bed. "How are you feeling today? Up for visitors yet?"
"Because I didn't want to see that my hero was being used as a punching bag. I also knew how you would react if I ever asked; you would feel like you failed to protect me." Finally, the ten-year-old turned his head to face the teen. "It's how you're feeling now, isn't it?"
The boy shrugged and looked down at his feet. “After you told me about the supernatural, I just– there’s so much evil out in the world, Dean, I feel like I could drown in it. And when I think about how I could end up–”
"Dean wants you there," Tony explained. "But there's no way in hell you're stepping foot on the property if you're a danger to the kids."
Short chapter alert!! I swear, not all the chapters will be this short, lol. Thank you for all of the support and love I've gotten after posting the first chapter, it really motivates me to work harder and faster for all of you :)
The woman really had no right to like Clint and Natasha, considering her husband cheated on her with a drug addict, but she assured them that the sins of their mother had nothing to do with the two of them.
“You two are the only ones who actually give a crap about me. About how I’m doing and how I’m feeling. And–I can’t apologize enough for how much trouble I’ve been.” The teen took a deep breath and closed his eyes tight. “All the stress I’ve caused you with having to get me from school two days in a row, to me using those stupid pills and leaving you with that damn hospital bill. I’ll do my best to pay you back, but I don’t know if I ever can. I–I’m so sorry.”
Tony will live. He has to. If he hasn’t died yet, that means he’s not meant to, and while Steve has always had a hard time accepting fate as law, he’s praying it’s at work now.
Afghanistan is stifling— sauna hot without the humidity. The temperature dries his lips but he moistens them with bourbon and two-bit jokes that put the soldiers around him at ease.
“You will not stay here,” the woman says. She’s standing, towering over him now, looking like some sort of divine being, the apocalypse in full swing behind her. The cool feeling of her fingers bites into his jaw as she grabs his face, forcing him to look into the black orbs Tony guesses are her eyes. If he could register anything beyond the feeling of ash (of
“I wonder how you’re human. You’re like a goddamn cockroach, Tony,” he laughs, half hearted and weak. “Nothing can kill you.”
— their fighting styles fit together like two pieces of a puzzle. Their teamwork is fluid, seamless in a way Tony has never experienced.
“You must fix him. He’s our last chance,” and it’s the blue woman speaking again. Steve pauses in his march towards the ship, stopping right at it’s maw, watching with rapt attention as she turns away, fading back into the dark. He can hear his blood pounding in his ears, his heart beating so fast it feels like it might crash right through his ribcage.
He sits there for an hour, two, the sun slowly setting beyond the glass of the window. His breath shudders and his face is wet, but all the while, he holds Tony’s hand.
Then there’s an explosion and Rogers is wrapping his body around yours, cushioning the blow, and for the first time, you're not the one that’s left tasting ash.
You meets Captain fucking America, and it takes everything you can to not spit in the mans picture perfect face.
The memory of her aches in a way it hasn’t in ages, and you’re sure that it has something to do with the star spangled man seething in front of you.
Every one of Steve’s senses goes silent as he bursts into a run, practically ripping Tony from the woman’s grasp, red immediately staining the palms of his hands. Tony’s skin is practically burning his skin with fever, but it’s him, breathing and beaten and broken but alive alive
He wakes to breathing. The inhales are deep, steady, and metronomic while the exhales are gusts— strong and forceful.
Yinsen’s voice is soft as down, like he’s trying to take the sting out of the words, out of the revelation.
He’s too young to take over the company, so he completes his masters at MIT and then gets another. After that, he gets a doctorate and then two more and eventually, he loses count— loses the ability to discern whether the degrees are honorary or well deserved. Tony works and doesn’t think— he thinks and then he freezes, only for moments at a time. Rhodey catches him once, staring into the middle distance with eyes oil spill dark.
Steve is still in the pits of denial even as the blue woman returns, this time carrying something, some
He gives Pepper his company, lets Rhodey take one of his suits, and then a spider with eyes like glass and hair like fire shoves a needle into his neck and tells him to get a grip.
Steve’s moving before he even registers what he’s doing. Natasha calls for him a few feet away, but he ignores her in favor of walking towards the opening.
There’s the barest of shifts, the slightest sound of linen against linen and Steve is holding his breath again, staring at Tony for any signs of him resurfacing once more. A moment, then another, and he lets the tension drain out of his body.
At seventeen, Tony becomes a man. The transition from youth to adulthood is car crash smooth, all broken glass and busted steering wheels. Somewhere, on a winding forest road, pearls from his mother’s favorite necklace are blowing in the breeze, nothing but powder. Red, rusted and flaking, stains the asphalt.
He follows the Dora, her pace fast and tense as they reach the doors, stepping through the threshold and out into the clearing where they had fought. There are still bodies lying in the grass, casualties from the battle that weren’t the result of Thanos’s finale, and it makes something sharp and acidic rise in the back of Steve’s throat.
He reaches for the bowl next to him because there’s something clear and liquid in the basin and it could be gasoline for all he cares, but he knocks it flat, spilling it onto the floor. There’s a tugging sensation in his chest, then— sharp and aching. He presses a hand to it, willing it to lessen, but his palm meets something hard and rigid, sparking at Tony’s fingers.
) grows up under the fierce indoctrination of fists and shrapnel. Howard’s disappointment is as brutal as a .50 caliber bullet, puncturing Tony’s still developing ribcage once, twice, three times before he learns that he must apply pressure himself, small hands slippery with blood, and grit his teeth through the pain.
“We will land shortly. I’m tracking the location of Rocket,” says Nebula, barely turning her head in his direction. Her posture is stiff, tense in anticipation. And grief, Tony supposes. It has a way of sticking in a person’s bones, regardless of whether they’re made of steel or not.
during the entire trip. She doesn’t sleep, doesn’t seem to need to as she keeps the Milano at what Tony would call warp speed if the phrase didn’t sound so fantastical.
“A ship has broken through the atmosphere. There's no telling if it’s friend or foe. The team calls for you.”
Rhodey’s already in the armor, faceplate down, but Steve knows the expression he’s hiding all too well. It’s a reflection of Steve’s own, after all.
Then Jarvis is there with tea and milk, a small plate of cookies resting beside the cups, and Tony feels the word home settle in his bones like it's always belonged there.
Tony sticks to it but Yinsen doesn’t and Tony flies out of camp with blood staining the backs of his eyelids.
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Natasha and Bruce making their way towards him, adjusting their pace to keep up. A beat, and then Thor and the racoon-thing he’d shown up with step into his line of sight, silent and solemn.
but then there’s blue, sky blue, staring at him and through him and something inside of Tony settles, shudders, stops.
Tomorrow, Tony will wake up. Maybe he’ll scream, maybe he’ll cry, maybe he’ll tell Steve to get out of his sight. Whatever happens, it won’t matter. As long as he’s alive.
Rhodey calls you insane and Pepper can’t meet your eyes until she's shoving her hand in your chest, gripping your insides with a delicate kind of strength.
He feels the rest of the team moving behind him, shifting forward together like a pack of wolves, starving and desperate in their attack. The viciousness of it all is disconcerting, and Steve wonders if this is really what they were meant to become. Lone survivors in the wake of such chaos.
Steve chuckles again but it’s sharp and not at all what he’s feeling but the alternative to laughing is crying and he can’t afford that right now.
She looks vaguely disgusted as she says the word “team” and Steve can’t blame her. He’s barely seen Natasha or Bruce or, hell, even Rhodey since everything ended. He has no idea if Thor is even on Earth anymore.
Steve can’t say how long he’s been sitting there or how long Bruce has been trying to get his attention, but how could anyone expect anything of him when Tony is
In his ear, Steve says “Tony, I—” and then there’s heat on his back, black in his vision, fire in his veins.
But he isn’t a Captain, really. Not after everything. Not since Siberia, and sure as hell not after this.
Obadiah’s hand is heavy on your shoulder and you feels like Atlas, then, with pressure on your collar bones, spine close to snapping.
Steve watches as Bruce takes out Tony’s tracheal tube, his own breath caught somewhere between his third and fourth rib.
“Captain.” God, and that makes his shoulders tense. He turns his head, meeting eyes with one of the Dora, her gaze unflinching but weighted. Not for the first time, Steve wonders how these people can have so much strength in the aftermath.
She’s shaking like a leaf, her teeth chattering. It’s probably shock but Tony can’t comfort her, can’t offer her any of his warmth because he hasn’t got any left to give.
Aliens are going down left and right and it’s awkward and it’s so not the time, but Tony feels laughter of all things bubbling up in his chest. The elation of feeling useful, the sudden sense of
There’s a searing burst of pressure in his side and then it’s only pain and thoughts of Peter before it all fades to black.
He lets the pain flow through him like some kind of penance, but it’s not enough. It will never be enough.
The lights are bright even behind his eyelids, sharp and sterile. Tony screws his eyes further shut, scrunching his face and trying to shift in what he assumes is a hospital bed. He braces himself, takes stock of his body.
When Tony was seventeen, his parents broke like porcelain on a backwoods road, leaving behind broken bones and bloody steering wheels.
Centimeter by centimeter, inch by inch, he can feel the jagged pieces of metal closing in on all his body’s softest places. Obadiah laughs and then he leaves and Tony just lies still, light as a feather and stiff as a board.
If this is an enemy, if this is some kind of final blow from Thanos, then dammit, he's going out swinging. He has nothing and no one to be careful for anymore.
He closes his eyes and watches DUM-E puttering around the workshop, hears JARVIS’s smooth timbre over the
He feels rather than hears Bruce say his name, the pressure from his grip sinking through the shoulder of his uniform as he finally tears his eyes away from Tony’s face.
In lieu of speaking, Steve just nods, getting to his feet with military precision. He feels like he’s made of glass, like he’s glued together— more fragile than he’s ever been.
“I’m so thankful that you keep coming back. Even if it’s not to me. You could take one look at me when you wake up and tell me to get out, to go to hell, and I’ll leave, I swear. All I need is for you to wake up, to be fine, to— to keep moving. Because we need you.” Steve swallows, his voice growing weaker.
“Quill! Drax! Where are you assholes?” The racoon is...yelling. Which, again, Steve would’ve questioned if this was before, but now they’re in the
Suddenly, the blue lady’s mouth snaps shut with a mechanical click, her features smoothing out. She places a hand on his chest and he can feel it, in the recesses of his mind— can feel the way her fingers probe what’s left of his armor, can feel when she finds the cauterized edge of the stab wound Thanos had placed there only minutes before.
and it’s only then that Tony remembers that Captain America went into the ice at twenty-six and came out the same age.
He's trying, he really is, to wrap his head around it but there's just no understanding. Half of the universe is gone, over half the team is gone, Bucky's gone and
Tomorrow, the sun will come up and there will still be bodies laying out in the field. Tomorrow, a new day will start and half the world will still be dust.
A loud whir echoes its way across the field, intrusive and sharp in the careful silence that's settled across Wakanda. One minute there’s nothing, and in the next, a dark mass is lowering itself to the ground, unsteady but purposeful.
A journalist approaches him and calls him the Merchant of Death, but two hours later he’s between her thighs.
She’s yelling at him, he can tell. He sees her mouth, blue and so strange moving at a rapid pace, teeth bared and furious. There’s grief plain and simple painted across her features, but he can’t bring himself to care.
In a flash, he’s tearing at his bandages, pulling them away like wet paper. There’s a sound, animalistic and high, and it takes him a second too long to realize that it’s him that’s making it.
Maria screams through his entire birth, loud and inconsolable while Howard sits at a desk half a city away, unknowing and uncaring.
. The racoon keeps moving even after Steve draws himself and the others to a halt, holding his ground. The creature scrambles up towards where a drawbridge is lowering towards the clearing, creaking and groaning from the weight, making contact with the earth with a low thud.
until the arc reactor is lighting up both of their faces, Tony’s paralyzed and pale and Obadiah’s flushed and gleeful.
“The wizard believed you to be valuable. You will fix this.” And with that, she’s yanking Tony to his feet. He can’t feel the ground beneath him, can’t help the way he fights against her, but he does because
. You need to run back to base. He’s barely breathing. He needs— he needs a hospital,” and those final words bolt through him, a shock to his system.
Aunt Peggy is a whirlwind, mouth red as menace and eyes sharp as tacks. Her hair is pristine, but her voice is sickle sweet and tea warm. She teaches Tony how to form a fist, how to throw a punch, how to plant his feet and snarl.
Anthony Edward Stark is born as an explosion— destructive and wild eyed, hair soot dark, his round cheeks ruddy with exertion.
In the darkest and deepest recesses of space, there’s the sound of rubble shifting, settling— an audible signal of the end. The sky is red and full of smoke, particles of metal and rock floating aimlessly through the air as if they’re afraid to land.
Her voice sounds like gears grinding against each other and it grates on Tony’s ears. He feels numb, like he’s floating above Titan, weightless. Some far off part of his mind wonders how gravity works on planets apart from Earth while the rest buzzes with numbness. In the back of his mouth, he tastes iron and copper colliding.
There are women and there are drugs and there are empty bottles that smell like his father’s breath, all wood barreled disappointment.
The voice is breathless, panting and frantic like whoever’s speaking just ran a mile or five. There are hands on him, then— searching and insistent. They’re on his wrist, pressing against the skin of his side and
“Sometimes, I wonder how you do it,” Steve says to the empty air. His voice sounds like it’s been dragged over coals, like he’s been screaming for hours and hours. There’s no response, and Steve wasn’t expecting one, but the silence still rings loudly against the linoleum tile.
Distantly, Tony understands that his stab wound is infected. He’ll probably become septic soon, if he hasn’t already. He doesn’t tell Nebula, doubts that she’ll understand anyway with her mechanical parts and lack of an immune system.
Before anyone can say another word, Steve has Tony clutched to his chest, sprinting at full speed. It takes a moment to recognize the sensation he’s feeling, only to realize it’s the wind on his face, whipping at his cheekbones. All around him is the smell of earth and blood and the scent of ozone. Suddenly, it’s like everything has been thrown back into vivid technicolor, abrupt and jarring in contrast to the constant black and white of the after.
Tony wakes up and he can’t breathe. He can feel a tube in the back of his throat and he pulls, the motion of the plastic inside of him making him gag, but once it’s out he’s gasping for air, damp and dirty.
That’s Steve’s hand in his hair, stroking his greasy curls back with a delicate sort of pressure, a gentle sort of strength, the feeling of fingertips against his hairline soothing the tension that’s crawled into his frame.
It’s a selfish wish, he knows. Strange saved him for a reason, said it was the only way, but Tony has been trying to make his life count since the day Yinsen died for him in that cave, and no matter what he’s done, no matter what he’s accomplished, it’s all been for nothing.
Howard says something on film that Tony presumes is supposed to be motivating, but the words fall flat.
“They’re dead. It’s just me and the metal man.” Her voice is artificial, robotic and so strange but yet familiar in a way that makes Steve’s insides twist.
“The world needs you,” but it’s not the whole truth, and it feels like he can't breathe. His eyes are burning, bright and stinging against his eyelids while his throat burns. The pressure rises and rises and rises until he snaps in the silence.
“I’ve seen the footage,” Steve says, and a smarter man probably would’ve taken a step back, would’ve yielded to the war hero that brought Hydra to its knees.
He’d thought that seeing Steve again would be painful. That it’d hurt. They hadn’t said a word to each other after Siberia, not really— only sending the odd text every now and again, usually while drunk or exhausted or lonely beyond measure.
Over seventy years ago, he crashed a plane into the ocean to stop a bomb that would’ve killed millions. Only five years ago, he defeated an insane robot that destroyed a country from the bottom up. Two years ago, he nearly traded Tony’s life for Bucky’s.
“It’s the Milano. Holy shit,” and if Steve could feel anything at all, he'd be surprised that it’s the racoon who's speaking. Instead, he shakes his head and starts jogging, heading towards the ship with single minded determination.
Tony feels himself nod but the motion feels detached, like his head is full of cotton, Nebula’s voice sounding far away and more artificial than usual. With his right hand, he fumbles for his stab wound, squeezing until he feels blood start to coat the pads of his fingers.
Steve was walking slowly towards him, concern filling up his eyes. Even the bird had paused in its guzzling to watch with its head tilted to one side.
Stories, history, songs, poems, family trees could all be written down again, but it would take time and there would be some gaps in the narratives and in their knowledge that the survivors would be unable to fill. They could try growing their own food, but it would never taste as good as the produce back on Asgard. They could grow flowers and trees, but nothing as beautiful as back home. The air would feel different on their faces, the rain would smell different, and the water would taste not as sweet. Everything on Earth would be familiar, but nothing would be the same.
Houses could be easily and quickly built (as indeed they had been), but what the Asgardians had lost couldn't easily be replaced. When they had fled Hela there had been no time to grab anything but the most essential items. Food and water was selected over books, medicine bags over family portraits. Blankets, weapons, and shields could aid survival, but musical instruments, statues, exotic plants, and pets could not. It was not just their world that had been destroyed, but their culture too. It lived on only in their minds.
He shrugged, smiling wobbly. “And so what if I want us to be the first married and remembered as that? Why not?”
“Alright,” Steve said, softly. He pulled Tony into hug, stroking his hair. “We'll set the date for the start of July. We'll fix it today and send out Save The Date cards so that there can be no misunderstandings. But, that's it for the green-eyed monster, right? Thor's happy for us, so let's be happy for him. Besides, who wouldn't want to attend an Aesir wedding? And a royal one at that.”
They would have kissed again if it were not for the alarmingly loud crackling noise that suddenly erupted to the left of them.
It had been five days since Tony had gone down on one knee, in his Iron Man suit and in front of the not-so subtle banners that flashed their declarations of love. Five days since Steve had accepted the proposal, first put on the silver ring, and had insisted on the banners being torn down. Five days for them to inform their friends that they were engaged and would at some point be deciding on a date for the big day.
He was fighting back tears, he could feel them building. And he had to say what was in his heart because if he didn't then he would explode. Didn't matter if he looked selfish or spoilt – he was both those things and knew it. But, he was also hungry for Steve, Steve, and more Steve. After everything they had been through he just wanted one thing to go perfectly for them.
Loosing only a couple of feathers, it landed on the floor and skidded to a halt, but the scroll remained with it, undamaged. Quite an accomplishment. It released the ribbon to caw furiously at them.
“See this time period we're living in, this is the aftermath to the greatest disaster every to befall the whole universe. Everything has changed. It will always be talked about, immortalised in stories and movies. We'll always be remembered and talked about. And I -”
“Strip,” he commanded, stripping off his clothes with precision, tossing them to the floor, eyes fixed on every inch of tanned skin that was revealed, his gaze wandering appreciatively over Tony’s lean muscle. Tony threw his clothes to the floor and looked up at Steve from his place on the bed, want burning in his stare and Steve felt powerful, preening under Tony’s needy gaze.
Steve shrugged, unconcerned about the red smear decorating Tony’s gray shirt. “I wanted to see how everything went,” he said casually. “Any hecklers?”
Tony bowed his head, but not before Steve saw a dark flush spread across his cheeks. Steve bit down on a growl, tugging Tony’s head up against to look him in the eyes. “Always a good slut for me, aren’t you?”
He and Bucky are inseparable as they wade through the recovery process, and he’s overjoyed to have his friend back. The years between Shuri’s genius fixing Bucky’s battered mind and the fight for their world against a purple monster full of hubris and power gave them time to heal and talk and figure things out.
Steve held Tony’s hips, rocking him down against his lap, pressing the thickness of his hard cock against Tony’s ass. “I don’t care,” He said, eyes dropping down to the red stain on Tony’s shirt, completely unashamed at the arousal that swept through him at the sight of the blood marking Tony. The blood that he had pried out of that asshole just moments before was now dried against Tony’s skin, the shirt ruined.
He stands through Tony’s anger with a quiet acceptance that surprises even him and refuses to let himself react to the vitriolic words Tony flings at him. He’s tired, so tired, and he just wants his team back.
Tony’s happy and Steve can’t even bring forth the resentment he feels he should have after he sees the soft, loving look Tony gives his daughter. Tony’s retired, he’s done, and Steve has no right to drag him back into the fray when he has so much to lose.
But he can’t.  He tells Natasha what he’s learned the hard way: they don’t get the luxury of moving on.
“No, it wasn’t like last –“ Tony stopped, now looking at Steve with suspicion. Steve sighed internally, wanting to skip the conversation that came next and commence with fucking Tony like he wanted, fast and harsh. “Steve?” Steve hummed in response, focusing instead on licking up a wide expanse of Tony’s neck. “Steve, did you kill that guy.” Tony’s voice held no hint of a question as they both already knew the answer.
“Yes,” Steve breathed, enchanted by the sight of Tony’s hole swallowing his fingers, the stretched rim catching on each knuckle and making him want to shove inside, wreck that pretty little ass until Tony couldn’t walk for a week.
Steve gazed up at him, knowing that his eyes were still steely and unyielding. “You do when I’m coming over.”
He thrust into Tony, every movement hard and purposeful, his hips snapping forward. The sound of their skin slapping together was obscene in the otherwise quiet room, the heavy pants echoing through the squelch of lube as Steve fucked into Tony, completely out of his mind with the need to come inside Tony, to make him cry with desperation.
The package arrives and Tony doesn’t know how to react to the letter. He means to put the battered old phone in a drawer and never pull it out, but somehow it ends up in his pocket anyway.
When his breathing slows enough to let the last of the panic attack fade, Tony lets the cold seep into his bones and waits for his rescue. He takes all the pain and love that is now irrevocably tied together and locks it down, puts it in a box and never brings it out.
