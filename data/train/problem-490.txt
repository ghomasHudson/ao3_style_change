He doesn’t expect a response soon.
‘ ‘nd?’
Sherlock makes a noise.
Letting John change the bandage.
Left or right?
He shifts a bit on the sofa, the computer in his lap.
The light catches between the fish’s parted lips. Just a glint. Sherlock blinks. Another twinkle.
George Gavin Greg Lestrade awaits them. He lifts the crime scene tape and hands John a cup of coffee. “Sorry, just got one left.” He looks at Sherlock apologetically. Sherlock shrugs.
The air is still cool. Promises to heat up later. The sky a shade lighter than Sherlock’s shirt. The street lamps start to loose their orange glow.
John really needs to hoover more often.
Sherlock’s mobile phone rings while he brushes his teeth. He walks through the interconnecting door into his bedroom, looks at the display, wants to find out if it’s worth to pick up.
John sighs again. “Fine. Go ask Mrs Hudson. I think she is okay with you deep cleaning her carpet.”
John can’t stand still, trips around. “We need to go there!”
John closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, tries to stay calm. “So that bumble bee this morning was from your collection too?”
But a few weeks ago something started to drag inside him. Since then he feels a longing now and then.
Sherlock frantically rubs his body clean. Doesn’t want to leave any reminder of what he has just done. But he can’t wash his memories away. And he doesn’t even know why he feels so distressed and sad and dirty right now.
John grabs his mug and slowly goes up the stairs into his room.
‘You alright down there?’, John asks.
John is still busy cleaning the kitchen. Sherlock grabs his flatmate’s laptop from the coffee table. He needs to order his new petri dishes. Now.
ZSL London Zoo
Thinking of his flatmate’s innocence and shyness makes John get hard again.
Adam smells gorgeous. He had PE in the first lesson, the scent of his shampooed hair has intensified.
But the stony pocket of land remains empty.
It takes Sherlock a while to find control over his limbs. John helps so he doesn’t get tangled in the sheets once more. John also holds Sherlock’s morning robe out for him to slip into.
‘Sherlock, maybe...’, John starts.
There is a tickle. Sherlock sneezes.
“Is everything alright?”
does feel
“John. Please.”
“Does it still hurt?”, John asks.
Absent minded Sherlock signs the delivery confirmation. The postman and Mrs Hudson leave the flat.
Observing myself: When does my body react? Where does my body react? How does my body react? What do I see when he touches me (synesthesia)? What do I feel when he touches me? Where do I feel it? What do I think when he touches me?
“And you stepped into it. You really
Sherlock wants to be liked, admired by John. It worked out quite well when they were occupied with cases. But then his mind started to behave strangely. Can a mind even do something like
“I like that.”
‘I promised Mycroft to keep an eye on your eating habits.’ John points his fork at Sherlock to emphasise his words. ‘By the way, he picks us up in half an hour. Eat up.’
Sherlock is intrigued. Keen on searching for more evidence on John’s sexuality. And he is something else that he doesn’t have a name for yet. Something that lays deep inside him.
But there it is and here I am.
“Sherlock?”, Adam asks.
Sherlock shrugs.
There is a voice through the closed door. “Do you want dinner?”
“Where exactly do we have to go?”, John asks when they enter the zoo. A policeman welcomes them.
Men in submissive and dominant poses, obscene and alluring. Nearly naked. Reviews of toys Sherlock has never heard of. An interview with the actor, a British sex symbol.
He cannot breathe.
‘You ruined it. You always ruin everything!’
“Oh my God”, Sally whispers, her dark eyes widely opened.
“What?”, Sherlock asks, his glance focused on the dusty circles.
John pulls Sherlock back down in his chair. ‘Do you think you can manage a bite or two?’, he asks quietly.
I touch my temples with my fingers, close my eyes.
Sherlock drags the magazine from under the bed, takes a look.
But he also has to find John. He has to find his heart to leave this place partly complete. He knows that his mind is long gone.
“That’s not too far. We have to turn left. Wasn’t at the zoo in ages.”
Although John has already spurted this morning, his bullocks ache, filled with white hot liquid that wants to get released.
Tears run down Sherlock’s face. He hates losing control over his body. He hates vomiting. He hates vomiting into a toilet. He hates being damp with sweat.
“You alright?”
He pats himself down frantically until he is sure there are no crumbs sticking to him. Nevertheless he wishes he could shake himself like Redbeard.
“Sherl, I never wanted to hurt you. I was just upset…”
A moment later John slaps his hands on his thighs and gets up. “Right. Bedtime for me, Sherlock. Bet I’m gonna be a bit rusty tomorrow on the maiden voyage. Don’t stay up too late.“
A wave of dark blue warmth washes through Sherlock’s chest. He still can’t look at John, but a little smile forms on his lips. “That would be nice.”
In the afternoon he changes the flowers, opens one jar a bit too wide. A bee flies into his face, makes him stumble backwards, lifting the jar even wider. Eighteen bees escape. Sherlock just stands still and watches the bees fly around under the ceiling, out of the door into the other rooms.
“I wanted to cook.” Sherlock sounds sad.
Sherlock gasps.
“I get my doctor’s kit. Don’t bleed on the carpet.”
They arrive at the crossroad where Greg has to turn right and John left.
mind palace, I am in control here.
At least it’s not into a car, Sherlock thinks. Then he hits the pavement.
There are three rooms on the left and three rooms on the right wall. They are even in size, number of windows and colour of wallpaper. All except one. The last room on the right wall is different. Different from all the rooms in my mind palace. It is locked four times. The key is lost.
He has to be more careful while opening the bell jars from now on.
Sherlock shrugs. “I’m fine.”
“I did ask you something, John. And that was not a rhetorical question.” Sherlock whirls around and sinks on the coffee table. He looks at John. Notices a worried look on his flatmate’s face. He is not good at reading other people’s emotions but John is an easy one.
Redbeard’s reaction to different animal noises
These are not my words, not my thoughts.
John wants to give in to his fantasies but time is not his friend today. He sighs. He needs to get ready for work.
Height: 1m69
John shifts in his armchair. Alarmed by his flatmate’s voice. “Are you okay?”
“Delivery for Sherlock Holmes”, the man says.
“I can rest at the microscope.”
The palace is collapsing.
John opens the door to their living room, Sherlock stands on his armchair, waves with the magazine.
John presses an adhesive dressing onto Sherlock’s skin. A long gash under the now bandaged knee. Not gentle. Not caring. Not hard either. Just professional. He is Dr Watson. But his tight lips are John’s. Anger.
The floor is dirty today. Crumbs and dust everywhere. John hasn’t vacuumed yet.
Buzzing sounds came from the inside. Sherlock kneeled down, opened his sleepy eyes a bit wider. The light was still a trifle too intense, but after a few seconds his pupils adjusted to the brightness.
“John!” He waits.
Sherlock blinks in amazement. He rests his chin on the wooden surface of the table.
Sherlock babbles and gabbles and John knows that something is wrong. “Any details yet?”, he wants to know. But the detective isn’t at his side anymore. He turns around. Sherlock stands under a magnolia tree, its flowers slightly wilting, stares at something.
‘That’s dealt with then. Can we eat now?’
The petri dishes won’t get filled today.
“Fine. Now, Sherlock, I’m starving. I really need to eat something. Want to join me?”
His erection is uncomfortable big.
‘Mhhh.’
He wants to spend the whole day in this bed. Between the sheets that’ve touched John’s skin a few hours ago.
It is hailing eyes.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” That’s why Sherlock doesn’t call his parents too often. They are always worried, especially his Mum. And then she comes up with disastrous ideas.
“Yes.”
“Oh, yes, right. Easy”, Sherlock stutters. His cheeks turn hot.
When the glass hits the floor it breaks into five pieces. The corn flake is on the tiles again.
“Everything alright?” Adam has noticed Sherlock’s strange behaviour.
“Male, white, 40 years, has been floating in the water. The keeper has found him in the morning when he wanted to feed the penguins”, Lestrade explains. “It’s the iceman. He has his booth near the birds.”
Sherlock opens a jar, leans over the green metal fence. The flowers smell intense, hence all kinds of insects buzz and bumble inside the little garden.
The foot hurts again.
Sherlock glances at his clock. 4 pm. He has to wait until 8 pm. At least. But he wants to make his observance now. He gets up.
Age: 2+ years (little holes over the dorsum of the foot, faded colour)
“It’s for all your observations and adventures. You can write them down now.”
Everybody freezes. It only lasts two seconds.
Sherlock doesn’t want his father’s socks.
Sherlock whimpers.
I stamp on them and bones crush. The heads in the walls start to scream in a high pitched voice.The arms belong to them, I realise. But where are their legs, their torsi?
John feels a tingling in his crotch.
The dream is gone. But it has left something. Sherlock’s pants are wet and sticky.
The door is open. I never leave the door open. I run inside, make sure to lock the door behind me, and the red sound stops.
“Won‘t“, Sherlock promises. Looks up at John. Wants to say something, explain something. His body still tense.
I need to find out what is wrong with my body. So I walk into the kitchen. The kitchen has always been a clean and bright room. Windows face east so the sun always begins its journey where I start most of my visits as well.
He storms out of John’s room, down the stairs, right into the bathroom. Tosses his robe on the tiles. He needs to shower. Doesn’t even bother to wait until the water turns warm.
“You should leave the kitchen alone. No cooking anymore, okay?”
“This is so creepy. They sure aren’t normal, maybe they are vampires.”
One day their teacher says the words Sherlock is eager to hear: “Adam, you work together with Sherlock.”
After the last bell has rung John and Greg wait outside in front of the school building for their friends Sally and Lip who are a form above. It’s a bright autumn day with blue skies and red leaves.
“Just some balm. Hold still.”
Sherlock walks out of the compound. Angry about Anderson’s incompetence, angry about John’s slowness of uptake. But mostly he is mad about himself. Because this case reminds him of a failure. A mistake he can’t correct, although he tried for years and years.
Sherlock nods. Tries to get up. Sways. John steadies him. Helps him sit on the toilet lid.
Slowly Sherlock heaves himself up. And limps home towards 221B.
‘Mh? What? Oh. This. Happy Easter, Sherlock.’ John smiles, spatula in his one hand, pan in the other.
He counts.
Maybe he has lost a bit too much blood. No, not enough to stop contemplating.
“Go back to bed, Sherlock. What time is it?”
“Now, can you please leave the flower bed? What are you doing there, anyways?” The policeman stares at the basket filled with buzzing pharmacy glasses, suspicious.
No, John thinks, Sherlock is not always right.
I whirl around and run up the staircase. A crack. I stumble. I reach out for the handrail. My fingernails scrape the metal. I hit the broken wood underneath me. I lay there, one two three stairs covered by my body. I feel a splinter in my left ring finger. Red, again.
John stands under the waterfall, drops sparkle in his hair, on his bare chest. The river’s water hides his lower abdomen that Sherlock is eager to see. He wants to join John, wants to lick off every single bead, wants to taste his skin.
The arms reach my upper legs now. They claw into my skin.
John makes himself a cup of coffee. “Want some, too?”
A red sound.
‘Breakfast first’, John says when Sherlock takes out another egg from the nest.
I stare into the corridor and the corridor stares back into me.
A fifth fact on beekeeping
When the two baskets are organised Sherlock turns to a big dark box in the furthest corner of the wardrobe. He has opened it before. Just once. Its content has made something to Sherlock that has scared and confused him.
Flashes of London outside the window. Stop and go. It makes Sherlock’s stomach churn. He closes his eyes. Leans back. He sits next to Mycroft. John is in the passenger seat. He’d prefer John with him on the back bench.
Jimmy hasn’t said that. But he has.
“And why is it the dust from our carpet?”
How is that even possible? How is all of that possible? This is
John gets up. “I can bring us dinner in bed and we watch a movie on my laptop.”
‘What’s this?’
He starts browsing the bedside locker. But its contents are the same as three weeks ago. Nothing new. Nothing special.
“Some fled.”
“John, come here.”
Later the day Sherlock lays on his bed. He still wears nothing but the sheet. Loves the feeling of the cool linen on his skin.
Oh, how much he wishes John was here with him right now! Leaning over him, kissing him.
Sherlock wants to snarl back. But opening his mouth might not be a good idea. He
A bicycle.
“No. No. Absolutely not. I don’t want to hear another word from you. I don’t care how sorry you are, if you even can be sorry. After all, maybe you just did an experiment. For God knows what Goddamn reason! You really think I believe your excuse of not being able to ride a bicycle? Sherlock Holmes, the world famous consulting detective, does not know how to ride a bicycle?”
It is.
And it’s because Sherlock
But today there is an urge inside him to open the box again, to take out all the stuff, to let the
Sherlock sits up. Lays back down in a different position.
A cramp shoots through Sherlock’s body. He contorts. Cannot control his movements for a moment. Clasps the toilet seat. Let’s out a whimper.
John and Greg start walking down the street slowly.
sick.
Shortly after four in the morning Sherlock gets dressed. He hasn’t slept.
Dog breeds in our neighbourhood
“You like it?“, asks John in the evening, squatting on the floor in front of the bicycle and testing the air pressure of the tires.
It must be in a box, hidden in his parent’s attic, Sherlock thinks. Maybe he should ask his Mum to send it to him.
But right now Sherlock doesn’t hear the mean comments made by his classmates. Happiness tickles inside him. His lips curve into a tiny smile.
“Afraid? You better are. You know what we do with freaks like you.”
And Sherlock definitely is nothing more than a boy in John’s eyes. He doesn’t think that Sherlock has a lot of sexual experience, if any.
“Sorry.”
Something inside Sherlock shatters.
“Are you okay?”, he asks. His voice soft and quiet now.
Sherlock points at the area between ring and middle finger of the left hand. “See that?”
There is the tearing again. Somewhere near his lower abdomen. But also right in his stomach.
He imagines Sherlock’s expression right now. Eyes wide open, he guesses. Bewildered.
John plants himself in front of his flatmate. He feels anger inside him.
Sherlock sucks in a big amount of air. His eyes widen. The lightning has inflamed something deep inside him that’s hot and burning right now.
Sherlock watches.
‘Not all of us have time and patience for your games.’
“I’ll do”, John promises. He nods a goodbye, turns around.
He prepares a plate with some honey, hopes the bees will fall for the sweet treat. When they’ll settle down to eat, he can put the bell jar above.
Sherlock puts the two notebooks back inside the drawer. He digs around. Finds a stack of blank books. Takes one. Closes the drawer and shuts his memories. He takes himself off to bed, grabs a biro (not a pencil anymore, although he likes pencils) (black ink, he has the habit of just writing in black), opens the notebook. The spine makes a cracking noise. Sherlock loves notebooks. It’s always a pleasure to start a new one.
He changes back into his own clothes, decides to buy the shirts he has tried on.
It’s late afternoon and John doesn’t go home right away. Instead he is inside an H&M shop, looking at shirts. During work he had the idea of changing his wardrobe, upgrading it. He knows that Sherlock hates his cosy jumpers. So why not exchange them for something more fashionable? John has a body that doesn’t need to be covered.
Carefully now I climb the last stairs until I reach the second floor. I want to turn on the lights but the switch does not work. The big window which usually brightens the walls is covered by red curtains that are not mine.
Sherlock leans back, closes his eyes. Feels how weight is taken from the sofa as John gets up.
Sherlock flinches and John moves too as if he is able to feel Sherlock’s pain.
I reach the door. The door I have never wanted to open again. The door that has been locked four times.
Sherlock grabs a glass and a magazine, tries to catch the little creatures while they sit on the walls or windows. But he has no success. As soon as the bees sense an air draught they take off.
Adam!
“Mhhhh.“ Sherlock peaks from behind his book about honeybees that he is trying to read for the last twenty minutes. Exactly since John started fussing over the bicycle. Giving the gleaming frame another clean. Testing the bell and brakes for the sixth time. Making sure the seat post clamp has not come loose since the last time he checked it three minutes ago.
Sherlock focuses back on John. His mind gets easily distracted these days.
John waves his arms, tries to clear his view a bit. Caused by a draught from the opened windows the smoke escapes.
“Kitchen. Obviously.”
It’s time to bring them back to the park. They do it together.
Sherlock panics. He is trapped inside the cubicle.
“Why do you tell me this?”, Sherlock mutters from under the duvet. This story is sad.
Sherlock nods. Follows John into the kitchen. The table is already laid. Two light blue plates, two mismatched coffee mugs. Cutlery. Something grassy and green.
“I am sorry, Sherlock. Please, listen to me, I…”
“Thank you so much”, Sherlock whispers, still staring at the lavender.
“Can you do it right here?”, he asks.
“What?”
The newspaper crinkles again. “Is that another collection?”, John asks.
I take a deep breath and look over the edge, look down, see his burst body already with my mind’s eye.
When he looks up he is back in his room in Baker Street, the old notebook still in his hands.
“No.”
John strokes Sherlock’s back. Up and down. Then in circles.
He falls down a chimney, falls down floors, falls onto a sofa. There is no sky anymore, there is no sea anymore. But his suit is glowing red.
“Maybe you can start collecting CDs or vinyl figurines or watercolour paintings instead of dust.”
‘Quiet!’
John grabs him by his arm and he is lead to his sofa.
John even pulls the duvet over his flatmate. “Call me if you need something.”
Sherlock presses the enter button, the website opens.
Sherlock feels bad. Not because of his chafed palms or swollen knuckles. Not because of his bleeding knee under torn trousers.
“I hope you’ll store them in your bedroom.”
Does Sherlock have a crush on him?
The pain is centred around the wound. So it should be possible to investigate the touch.
Murder. Right inside the compound.
‘Look! You made me step on the crack!’
Sherlock is aware of that. He can feel the glances. He bends down a little bit further so his pyjama pants shift out of place. He imagines John licking his bottom lip.
He storms back into his room, slamming the door behind him. He falls on his bed, the sheet merely covers his lower abdomen now. There is a bulge under the sheet that Sherlock feels the urge to touch.
Sherlock jumps up. He can’t let this happen. He has to keep himself busy.
“When I was a child I didn’t have many friends”, Sherlock confesses. “Actually I had none. I had my parents, my brother, my dog and… Bumble.”
I pull myself together. What is wrong with the stairs? I look at the wood. I blink and then I see them. Anobium punctatum. Common house borer. What caused them to invade my staircase? I am not a person who kills creatures without reason. But now I do. Beetle after beetle dies under my hands. My skin becomes raw from the broken wood. Liquid from the squished insects wets my palms.
It rains. Rain keeps me alive.
Way of proceeding:
‘So you converted to Christianity?’, Mycroft snarls.
In a split second Captain Watson stares right into the boys heart, recognises the vulnerability. Childlike innocence. For a moment he is appalled. Still, he doesn’t soften his grip.
John shoots out, grabs Sherlock by his wrists, squeezes them roughly.
Black. Shiny. Sporty. A neon green water bottle attached to the frontal frame. Secured on a kick stand in the middle of the carpet.
He carries seven containers in his left hand. One is falling down now.
“Come on, it’s not my fault you are all too dumb.”
And because he is alone in this little cubicle and because he doesn’t care about what his mind thinks – probably for the first time in his life – he gives in to the arousal in his length. He lets his hand slide into his pants, grabs his cock. An astonished gasp leaves his lips.
Effects of sugar on me vs. Mycroft
“I guess you should pick up your phone”, the policeman says, mistakes the sound of bee wings for a vibrating mobile.
Mum’s eating habits
But Sherlock doesn’t feel like letting his bees go so soon.
He presses his face into the soft material. Bumble smells like home, comfort and childhood. The blue circle reappears.
Red and pink in my veins. It burns. I assume that I have my body back. At least there are blood vessels.
John notices. “Is something wrong?”
There is the twitching again.
He can’t lose John. And John would be disgusted with his flatmate like Adam and the other boys were.
“Maybe we can borrow you one for a weekend. Or you get your own. Would do you some good as well, not always taking a taxi everywhere you go.“
“Are you crying?” John’s legs grow weak.
Sherlock gets pushed into his bed.
I fold my hands over my lips.
“Anything important you want to share with the class?” History teacher Mrs Lark claws at the note with her chubby fingers.
Searching won’t be involved. The hiding places are predictable. Their parents are predictable.
“Yeff!” Sherlock jumps in the air, foam sprinkles out of his mouth. He runs into the living room.
“Bumble”, Sherlock mumbles.
“Do you eat enough?”, she now asks, knows that Sherlock hates this topic. But it’s important to her.
Because there is no further explanation why his flatmate tears the carpet apart, John decides to get back to his newspaper. But now and then he has to peer at the man on the floor.
Brand: Unknown (no visible logo, just plain colour, probably H&M as John buys a lot of his clothes there)
When he walks into the bathroom to clean himself, his knees are still shaking a bit.
The morning is blissful. And under the sheets he can even imagine himself being twenty years in the past. At home. Redbeard on the carpet next to his bed.
“So you took my bike to practice? In the middle of the night?” John unrolls gauze. Doesn’t look up once. A grim smile appears on his lips.
He lies on his back, legs angled, feet on the ground, head tilted to the left, hands folded over his stomach. John might see his knees behind the coffee table. Because it’s that place again. Between sofa and coffee table. Sherlock lies here several times a week. John has gotten used to it by now.
John coughs slightly.
John is wide awake now. Kneeling in front of Sherlock on the cold tiles. Rolls up the torn trousers.
“Because I need them.”
“What are you doing?”
Wrong, so
His sight blurs.
‘An Easter nest.’ John fills their plates with fried eggs.
“Sherlock, that is worse than before!” John looks shocked. His fingers linger over the wound as if he is too afraid to touch the foot. “How could this happen? The cut is even bigger now! You need to get stitches!”
And because ivy bees don’t live in groups no one will miss this one. As if bees would miss each other anyway…
John doesn’t ask who is supposed to clean the kitchen. He sighs.
“Is there anything wrong with my trousers?”, John asks.
Still, Sherlock keeps the note, puts it into a little box where he also stores the tag from the first jar and his John-notebook.
“Take your time.” John sounds understanding towards his flatmate. Then he leaves the bedroom.
It’s a quick run around the house. Soon Sherlock’s basket is filled. Mycroft plunges his hand into it.
“Thank you”, Sherlock says.
“Do you know where my old bee is?”
“Sherlock, I’m naked, I can’t go!”
“Pasta? Really? That black shit was noodles once?”
“We told you, Adam. He is a fucking poof. We caught him in the act, thinking of you”, Jimmy declares. He moves out of the cubicle so Adam has a clear view of Sherlock’s situation.
He wraps himself in nothing but his morning robe and walks into the kitchen. On the table his petri dishes, filled with household filth, are still waiting to be looked at under the microscope.
He looks at the almost 30-year-old toy in his hands. The bee is shabby and scabby but it is still one of Sherlock’s dearest possessions, he realises.
Mrs Jones had told them? Sherlock doesn’t miss information, never. But he doesn’t even know the topic of their project!
Eventually John lets go of Sherlock’s wrists. They have turned red and will be bruised by tomorrow. He takes a step back, breathes heavily.
Sherlock shifts on the floor. His groin feels uncomfortable and comfortable at the same time. He suddenly is aware of the feeling of the textile on his skin around his crotch in a way he hasn’t experienced many times before.
“Sherlock!” The yell makes him jump. For the second time this morning he stumbles out of his bed, wrapped in his sheet again. The bulge is nearly gone.
“There you are.” Jimmy smiles. It’s not just mean, it’s sardonic. Behind him Geoff and Christian make a face. Sherlock has never understood how someone like Adam could be friends with such berks.
So he tosses the book on the floor, crashes his foot onto it. Screams out.
“When I was a child I had a little hedgehog. Not a real one, though. A plushie. I took him everywhere I went. One day I lost him at the beach. I didn’t get him back. I sometimes still think of him.”
As soon as he opens the door a bad smell hits him.
There it is. John’s past. Complete combat gear, uniform, tags, gun.
He has to get out.
“Bloody hell, no. How many collections do you already have? How many of them are not stored in your own bedroom?”
When John comes into the kitchen, Sherlock already sits at the table and stares into the ocular of his microscope.
Bicycle
“It was just for a few days”, Sherlock says.
“How?”, he just asks while he patches his flatmate up.
A lot of the following pages are filled with somewhat semi-scientific drawings of bee wings, snowflakes and dog hair.
With his thumb John caresses Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock closes his eyes again, focuses on the small strokes. Light blue.
It is 1983 yet and Sherlock has just gotten his first microscope for Christmas. Though he hasn’t been gifted bees. At least not real bees.
He observes John.
I cannot see the room behind it yet. I cannot enter this room. My whole body trembles. My
John lets go, stands up so he is for once towering over Sherlock. Crosses his arms. And Sherlock swallows at the biceps now protruding from beneath John’s shirt. Gets a dry throat from the boxers on height of his eyes. He quickly looks up again.
In moments Sherlock fell into a peaceful sleep as John carded gentle fingers through beloved dark curls.
"The fact that if you don't my next blog entry will be 'The Case of the Smacked Sherlock'."
Returning from work, John expected to find his husband in a strop and was not incorrect. Dropping a kiss onto luscious curls he headed for his second shower having done so before leaving the clinic. "Just off to shower again, can't be too careful. Be back in a tic."
"You underestimate my brother."
The normally cherubic man looked anguished. "You're not going to want to hear this next but the Arclight can only be used when Wesix is actively engaged with Sherlock."
"Fine, Greg. As I was saying before your outburst, one can and does survive that particular milestone, also Hudders and Mr. Chatterjee, both in their eighties, will affirm that it does NOT mark an end to sexual prowess."
"Already looking around for a younger man are we?", his loud sigh echoes off the walls.
"John, did we eat brownies?"
"What day is it?"
Sherlock jumped to his feet, "Don't be ridiculous, I never leave any loose ends in my cases. How dare you? Prove it! I'd like to see you try!!"
"No danger touching him way up there", John teased wiggling his eyebrows.
Looking sheepish he turned to Sherlock, "Weirdly, as if anything in our lives ISN'T weird, the canine teeth were the only bits I didn't find so..."
The PM in his "infinite wisdom" had issued rather broad and sweeping generalities concerning how the citizens of the U.K. should approach the coronavirus pandemic. Whilst the schools remain open for now, it is suggested that people not frequent places such as theatres and pubs, because you know, priorities? By all means protect the punters, the kiddies can see to themselves.
"There's no need for sarcasm, John. She was quite athletic from vigorous exercise with her dogs, several different types of canine hair on her trousers, and her frequent equestrian outings."
"Not at all. I look forward to multiple eruptions."
"Your JOB, if I'm not mistaken.", the bed answered smugly.
Counting on John's soft heart and the spirit of the season to grant him immunity from "punishment", Sherlock spent the entire day brooding in silence on the sofa back turned on the world. John said nothing but noted with delight that Sherlock was snugly wrapped in the Strop Blanket.
In the deathly quiet left behind John retrieved the hat and, cradling it like a precious treasure, opened his laptop.
"Course it is but, bollocks, being slimey with cum and lube all the time is shite."
Sherlock's mouth fell open in a wordless gawp and John picked up the pace. "Shake a leg. Sooner we get there sooner you get your surprise."
"Goes without saying."
"It's small wonder to me that someone didn't suffer a medical emergency. It was stressful to say the least."
"Thank you Hudders. I couldn't bring myself to insult the occasion when you've worked so hard. John is there wine?"
"You want to discuss that NOW?" John moved closer and began to work Sherlock's already interested cock with languid strokes.
"Tea is required for this ritual?"
When pandemonium erupted yet again Sherlock took perfect aim and hurled the sphere into the flames. To those closest there was a brief sound of breaking glass followed by a huge cloud of red and black smoke belching from the pyre. Then, the fire began to scream.
"John, I'm in my robe, you're in that hideous oatmeal jumper and I'm sitting in your lap."
"John, perhaps you should pace yourself, I mean at your age."
"How is that possible?", Martha asked.
"I fail to see how this will be an appropriately unique..."
Patting his stomach John whistled, "A triumph, Hudders, a veritable triumph!"
Hugs, kisses and breakfast delivered, Hudders secured their promise that they would make themselves 'decent' when she came up later with supper.
Epilogue:
Time for cocoa and a rewatch of A Study in Pink, where it all began. Ambling off to heat the milk and find some marshmallows she paused to collect the rejected pages torn from her rough draft - the ones tagged Major Character Death, Angst, Grief, Heartbreak and No Happy Ending. Feeling uplifted and pleased, she crushed them into a ball and threw them into the crackling flames.
"John, did you see that? Was that a camera flash?!"
John rose and knelt between Sherlock's splayed legs. "Well at least Big Ben will ring again and there are other ways to make fireworks, if you want to."
"If you want me to nap you're going to have to wear me out first.", Sherlock rumbled.
"What magic...?"
"Very well, go on if you must."
"Coming, coming you insufferable child!"
"Maybe but you know that's life and all that. Your choice."
"So I'm meant to put up with 'William' just sitting there being creepy and spying on me like Mycroft?"
"Come here you posh git!!"
"I have a favour to ask and it involves this shoe and...other things."
John charged forward as if he was back at war, fury burning in his heart. "Let go of him you son of a bitch!" He went to grab a shoulder then thought better of it and dug his fingers in a vice like grip into one of the leathery wings which had a wet slimy feel. For a second Wesix didn't resist then with renewed awareness he turned full force on John.
Long will we Johnlockers come
With no small dose of sarcasm John replied, "Oh thank you your most gracious Royal Highness. Challenge accepted!"
We won't give up on Sherlock and John
"No? What's this then when it's at home?", Billy cackled.
Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them. ~ Dalai Lama
"I've been well informed by Mycroft and his hubby Gibson..."
They were exchanging a passionate tongues slick snog when Sherlock, suddenly on high alert, pulled away. "John did you hear something?" Only silence surrounded them. "Hmm, odd. Well no matter, I'm just imagining things I suppose. So, what are we waiting for? Ravish me Captain!"
John stood, "On THAT note, I've a little surprise planned."
5th November Guy Fawkes Night-
Despite his intentions Sherlock found he WAS hungry and by the time the last of the pudding was eaten he had taken not only second helpings but thirds.
"Without a vote?", John teases.
"If you like but I don't recommend bouncing it, just a straight toss would be best."
"Again, do keep up John. Clearly evident by her well developed muscled thighs."
So saying he began peppering kisses down both Sherlock's legs from hips to ankles then bent low to lap at the shiny leather until it gleamed in the late afternoon sunlight streaming into the flat. Sherlock moaned, shivered and gasped, "A game?"
"Because whatever happens it's also Blame Someone Else Day, therefore we are covered. No ASBOS."
"But you think I'm barmy."
As far as I know the fight's still on
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
🌈❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️
A sleepy voice droned from the frame. "Goodly witch as is my task, I will show you what you ask."
Now laden down with enough food to feed an army, John was lost in his own thoughts. Hudders voice cut through the fog. "I know you said not to fuss dear but I simply couldn't resist trying these Mary Berry recipes for New Year's Eve. Beef Wellington, Fennel and potato gratin, Sprouts with chestnuts and pancetta, and Sticky Toffee pudding. Everything but the beef can be prepped some in advance so it won't be a chore. Can you think of anything I've forgotten? John...John?"
"We should be grateful for that sentimentality my friends.", droned the skull. "We have that to thank for their current sex holiday."
"If you insist. 5th August has two contenders so we shall enjoy both Underwear Day and Oyster Day in combination or separately. I'm flexible."
jwatson18: thanks, sherlock.
jwatson18: well thank you for telling me, sherl.
sherlock and john arrived to speedy's at 6:30 on the dot and greeted each other with a hug. they had only been there a couple of times together but had been there mostly been there alone while studying for their respective classes. they went so much to the point where the baristas knew their names. the two had ordered their coffees and croissants. neither liked fancy dates. they just liked spending time with each other, so they always went somewhere lowkey.
i deepy apologize. here's chapter 13. <3 :)
sherlock had been nervous, of course. he just thought john was a temporary thing in his life. sherlock sat in his psychology class wishing it would last a lifetime. he was scared of what his and john's meeting would hold. sherlock had enjoyed his conversations with john, and he didn't want them to be over just yet.
GREGLESTRADE HAS LEFT THE CHAT
freakholmes81: the only friend I've ever had. he and I were as close as close can be. we did everything together. but just as we were starting secondary school, his dad got deployed and the had to move to america. he hasn't talked to me since.
Thanks for 1000 hits! means a lot.
sherlockholmes81: I guess that is what I'm feeling.
FREAKHOLMES81 HAS LEFT THE CHAT
greglestrade: congrats, mate.
sherlockholmes81: i can't believe you remember that.
freakholmes81: I'm sorry, John. I'm not good with my people skills. when I said I don't have friends, I mean't it. nobody wants to be my friend. trust me. if people wanted to be me longterm friend, I would love to.
jwatson18: heyyyy greg how is life treating ya? I haven't seen you since high school ending. how are you and that guy doing?
jwatson18: GREG. IT'S SHERLOCK. HE SAID HE LIKED ME BACK.
~~~~~
freakholmes81: you called me sherl...
jwatson18: sherlock? I have a question.
mholmes: sherlock, just tell me one thing.
freakholmes81: oh
mholmes: please tell him. I am very tired of hearing of your little crush.
mholmes: john, what is wrong with my brother. what did you do to him?
jwatson18: really like me?
freakholmes81: what I'm saying is, I would love to be your friend if you still want to be mine.
jwatson18: sherlock. his name is greg lestrade. are you being serious right now?
feeling sherlock's discomfort, john suggested something else, "we can just watch some crap telly." sherlock just nodded and got comfortable on the couch next to john.
sherlockholmes81: what are we? well, we are best friends.
jwatson18: I hope to be more one day, too…
"look, sally. if it isn't gay 1 and gay 2." philip looked at sherlock and john holding hands.
freakholmes81: I'm truly sorry, john. I really am. I can be a dick sometimes, and I'll try to stop pushing you away.
sherlockholmes81: what?
jwatson18: oh
jwatson18: how I feel about sherlock isn't a little crush. I've had crushes before. he's different.
sherlockholmes81: okay, john. ask it.
freakholmes81: why would I want that? talking to someone sounds like absolute hell.
freakholmes81: you know nothing of what happened with victor. you never will.
jwatson18: I asked you a question first.
jwatson18: okay, "just greg"
jwatson18: oh yeah. my bad.
jwatson18: maybe it's for the best. maybe I'm too ordinary for you, or just not intelligent enough for you. I guess we will never know because this was a bad idea. good thing the semester ends soon because then psychology will be over and you won't even have to be in the same room with as much stupidity as me.
mholmes: are you scared to open yourself up to the possibility of love and friendship because of what happened to him?
To her consternation and secret delight, she was greeted by the vision of the two men deep in the throes of passion. At first tempted to look away, she instead arose, cleaned the mirror and resumed her 'observations'.
"Corpus delicti? Hudders, you need to broaden your circle of friends, Sherlock is rubbing off on you."
"Only one way to find out love, put on your coat and go look."
"Shan't be needing a lift. By then I'll be zipping around on one of those hover board thingies from that 'Back to the Future' film."
The old worn red armchair sighed. "You know I love you dear but we're meant to be sat upon you and I."
It was beyond comprehension, but what they were seeing could not be denied. Wesix transformed into something NOT human. Huge red wings supported by black ribs topped with razor sharp spurs sprouted from his back. His formerly flawless forehead held two small red horns and a long red tail with an arrow shaped tip emerged from his hindquarters.
They had just crawled out of bed when the familiar "Woo Hoo" filtered up the stairs. Sherlock clapped his hands in glee. "Excellent, I'm starving! Come along John."
"I don't. I wouldn't!"
"14th August, Chinese Valentine's Day, my opportunity to make amends for deleting last 14th February. There will be Chinese takeaway, I already know what the fortunes predict."
John knew better than to interrupt the "genius" at work, and was also smart enough not to ask the point of doing iodine contrast tests on something already diagnosed as cancerous. Sherlock insulted him on a regular enough basis, he didn't need to open that "door" and invite more pithy barbs slung his way. Besides he had something rather serious to discuss with Sherlock and if the man couldn't be in a good mood for it, at least John could avoid stirring him up.
both boys were unbelievably anxious to be around the other.
JWATSON18 HAS LEFT THE CHAT
sherlockholmes81: you can't be in class. it's saturday. the weekend. one of the days you don't go to class.
mholmes: sherlock. I believe you have something good with john. don't let victor get in the way of something great.
jwatson18: what?
sherlock was the first to talk.
I forgot to mention that sherlock had changed his username, because he felt comfortable with John protecting him to change it back.
freakholmes81: what is there to talk about? john. you told me that our whole friendship wasn't an accident. you did it on purpose. to talk to me, because "i'm perfect".
sherlockholmes81: john watson, will you be my boyfriend?
"oh, i don't really watch movies, so you can pick whatever you like." sherlock said trying to avoid john's eye.
freakholmes81: you got me there, Watson.
over the past few weeks, sherlock started questioning the way he was feeling about john. sherlock didn't remember feeling this way while being friends with victor.
jwatson18: on campus.
greglestrade: bye john.
freakholmes81: can we meet up? after psychology later? i think we should talk about this in person.
FREAKHOLMES81 LEFT THE CHAT
jwatson18: what are we?
sherlock just looked at each other before bursting into laughter. "that was brilliant, sherl. i applaud you. i'll imagine sally's face for the rest of my life."
freakholmes18: you actually want to be my friend?
freakholmes81: i can't sing, draw, or write.
"be my friend, sherlock. I'm begging you to be my friend, sherlock. give me a week. give me a week to prove I'm good enough to be your friend." John begged in a tiny voice.
jwatson18: are you free tonight?
connie prince's advice show was on, and the two were practically cringing the entire time they were watching.
jwatson18: I'm not like that, sherlock. that's not the type of person I am, and you don't know me well enough to say otherwise. thanks sherlock.
freakholmes81: john. I didn't mean it like that. it's just once you find out what a sociopath I am you won't want to talk to me anymore...
sherlock decided to ask john about these feelings he was having.
mholmes: brother mine, we must have a discussion about john.
sherlockholmes81: only if you're sure. i don't want you to get hurt.
jwatson18: sherl, you're scaring me. what does that even mean?
freakholmes81: chemistry.
the two cleaned up their messes, then made their way to john's apartment.
sally looked at her knees then she quickly walked away from the three of them. philip shot the duo a dirty look before running after sally.
freakholmes81: it's anderson and donovan. but it's fine. i'm okay with it.
jwatson18: hey holmes. how have you been doing?
*TWO DAYS LATER*
it's safe to say both of the boys fell asleep that night with smiles on their faces.
"anderson. how does the girlfriend feel about your cheating with sally?"
after sherlock has let john in on his secret, they had talked more than either boy had in a while. the boys didn't just text, they often hung out at speed's café. john and sherlock were a lot more comfortable with each other more than they were alone.
freakholmes81: stop texting me. I didn't ask you to contact me, but I did ask you to stop.
john just nodded and gave sherlock a quick kiss.
freakholmes81: there's no point, the kids at my college would change it back.
freakholmes81: well ’brother mine’, I believe the last thing we need to do right now is have a discussion. especially about john.
jwatson18: wow thanks man.
jwatson18: huh?
"that's exactly why I want to be your friend. the rugby team, they're all dicks for popularity. you're just different from everyone." John said nervously.
freakholmes81: promise you won't laugh at me?
jwatson18: talk to you later Sherlock.
freakholmes81: i thought you would be gone by now. i thought you were a stranger, but it's different now. you go to my school and you aren't a stranger now.
freakholmes81: that you'll leave me. like victor did.
sherlock sat on john's couch. he tried his best not to deduce john by his apartment. he noticed the cleanness showing that his father was most likely in the military.
sherlockholmes81: hello, john. how are you?
freakholmes81: I thought I told you to stop communicating with me?
jwatson18: I like different. :)
everything has gotten canceled including my peter pan rehearsals, i have no excuse not to update. so... thanks coronavirus.
mholmes: are you treating john this way because of victor?
sherlock quickly looked over at the clock, "oh crap, i have to get home. mycroft probably as government search party out looking for me, and I cannot deal with him."
freakholmes81: I'd rather be alone. thanks though.
sherlock had felt a little better until they reached john's front door. when john opened the door he heard sherlock take a gasp of air. john grabbed sherlock's hand and led him inside.
jwatson18: not scared, just nervous. but i just think about you when i get like that.
jwatson18: no wait, greg.
freakholmes81: I thought I told you to never message me again.
sherlock looked at john, before leaning into him, for a kiss.
jwatson18: bold of you to assume it's my fault, mycroft.
jwatson18: bloody bastard
"I've never had a friend before... mycroft always told me friends were a weakness, then he started dating graham then he stopped talking to me." sherlock said with sadness in his voice.
jwatson18: mycroft. sherlock just told me that he's not feeling like he did with victor.
greglestrade: my name is just greg.
"okay, John. let's get to know each other better." sherlock suggested.
jwatson18: really? you can dance? what can't you do?
while the two were talking, the two people they never would've expected to come into the cafe did. philip anderson and sally donovan.
freakholmes81: and mycroft's boyfriend is named gavin lestride.
after that there was silence between the two boys. each were scared to talk to the other. sherlock had just told john something he had never told anyone else before. after 6 minutes, John was the first to talk.
jwatson18: well, i remember most things that pertain to you. i've liked you for months.
jwatson18: I'll always want to be your friend.
jwatson18: when did you get here?
greglestrade: anytime. :)
jwatson18: phillip and sally are on academic probation and will get expelled if they even come near you. but since you knew becoming my friend was a bad idea, I guess we can stop being friends.
jwatson18: friendship? i'm your friend? god. i've been waiting for you to say that for a long time.
jwatson18: no. I think you should ask your brother considering I was just trying to help him.
MHOLMES HAS LEFT THE CHAT
sherlockholmes81: for you? always.
freakholmes81: fire, johnny boy.
"let's cut to the chase. why do you want to be my friend? nobody has ever wanted to be my friend, so why do you? especially you. you're here on a rugby scholarship. you're one of the popular athletic kids."
jwatson18: oh god. I have to tell greg.
eventually, john turned off the television because he couldn't handle the ridiculousness that was connie prince. sherlock and john locked eye, then the two burst into laughter.
i'm sorry for the 9 month wait.
sherlockholmes81: are you scared to come out to everyone?
freakholmes81: john, I'm sorry. please forgive me.
freakholmes81: I wish you would be a longterm friend of mine. but it won't last. especially since you texted me on accident.
freakholmes81: my name is Sherlock.
"sherlock, there's no need to be uncomfortable. i just don't want you to feel uncomfortable, or like you have to do something if you aren't ready."
jwatson18: I just asked you a question. don't you want someone to talk to?
jwatson18: wait
jwatson18: sherlock. I'm in you psychology class. I thought you would've recognized the name by now.
freakholmes81: did you have anymore questions?
I AM SO SORRY THAT I HAVEN'T UPDATED IN 30 DAYS
mholmes: well are you going to tell me what happened?
before he could deduce more, john came back with a bunch of movies, "hey, sorry about that. i have the movies, though. i wasn't sure what you would want to watch, so i just brought everything."
freakholmes81: okay. and please do hurry, I've got things to do today.
jwatson18: will he though? he's scared of disappointing you. he said he never wants to come to you because he would rather suffer himself than disappoint you.
the two continued their conversations until they had finished their coffees. sherlock was not expecting the question he was asked next, "do you want to come to my apartment, sherlock?"
jwatson18: why would i laugh at you?
JWATSON18 LEFT THE CHAT
freakholmes81: John Watson; a very boring name.
john looked as if he was about to pounce anderson when sherlock spoke up.
freakholmes: why do you care? you'll be gone within the week. so what's the point?
john just giggled at his boyfriend. while they just stared at each other, john unconsciously grabbed sherlock's hand. sherlock lightly squeezed john's hand in return.
jwatson18: i'll talk to you later, i need to talk to someone right now.
greglestrade: why are you still texting me?
sherlockholmes81: I like you too, john.
jwatson18: no it wasn't an accident. my friend greg... he's dating mycroft. I was with the two of them. we got on the topic of the people who go to my college, and mycroft mentioned you. then I pretended like my text was an accident. I'm sorry, sherlock. I am truly sorry.
"I just don't understand. why me? what about that nice molly hooper girl?" Sherlock asked.
JWATSON18 HAS LEFT THE CHAT
freakholmes18: what? I'm not perfect. nowhere near perfect.
of course, john was nervous. what would everyone think when their favorite rugby lad comes out, then tells them he's dating "the schools resident weirdo."
jwatson18: you know him best, and I just really like him.
"Politician, actors, musical performers, and whatever it is that Musk fellow fancies himself to be at the moment - all 1971 babies. Not too shabby company to be a part of but frankly all of them pale in comparison to my conductor of light and handsome husband, although that Freeman fellow is rather hot."
"Not spying, just observing for Santa, and don't forget I said there will be rewards for good behavior."
"Goddamnit Mycroft! It was real and Sherlock needs our help. Jesus can't you see what a state he's in?"
"Not a chance! No more radio OR tv interviews for that matter. Not after you told the BBC I shaved my legs."
"I am liking this criminal side of you John, quite stimulating.", Sherlock murmured as his roaming hand sought out a certain part of John's anatomy.
Trusting the witch with the pureness of his heart, he reached into the glass only to feel a hand clasp his in return. He pulled back his hand and the mirror vanished.
Plopping down on the sofa beside Sherlock, John glanced at the screen. "The news? You're so bored YOU are watching the news?"
Then Martha found herself with an armful of both men and two kisses on her cheeks. "Oh my boys, my dearest boys. We most certainly will, I never doubted it for a moment. After all without the three of here together, England WOULD fall."
The bonfire was blazing away with the hapless effigy of Guy Fawkes perched on top awaiting his yearly demise. Excited children chanting "Penny for the Guy" danced around their parents who were more interested in the nearby tables sagging under platters of sausages and marshmallows ready for roasting and Parkin Cakes, their spicy gingerbread smell filling the air. There was Apple cider for the young and the Teetotalers and a heady mulled wine topped with star anise for the others.
"Do any good?"
"You are an evil man, Sherlock Holmes."
"You were the one who brought up erotic fantasies, Sherlock. After all we're not the only ones with a 'toy' drawer in the bedroom."
"It wouldn't dare, I forbid it!"
John couldn't blame the trio seated opposite him in Mycroft's office for looking at him as if he might be having some sort of PTSD breakdown. He had trouble believing the story himself, but at least Mycroft, Greg and Martha had agreed to hear him out.
"August has to be the least interesting month of the year. There is absolutely nothing to recommend it."
"Of course John, what's going on?"
In the morning Hudders climbed the stairs to find them still on the sofa wrapped in each other's arms, sleeping peacefully. She covered them with a throw and noticed Billy seemed to be smirking. Conspiratorially she chuckled, "Well done you. First time a fractured skull proved to be a good thing. And just between you and me", she winked, "I KNEW they wouldn't be needing two bedrooms."
John settled the tray on the coffee table and poured her the first cup. "Sit down, Martha. Headache, queasy stomach or some such?"
Before a blushing John could respond, "Jaawwnnn!"
Whatever Sherlock said after that was lost to the loud pyrotechnics and John's reflections. Before he might have been amused or, on a bad day, irritated at Sherlock going on about subjects no "normal" human would possibly know or even want to know but now, tonight, it was the most wondrous thing in the universe. John decided then and there that if this was to be HIS delirium he would gladly "suffer" it for all eternity.
"And?! To a FOSSIL?!"
John began to giggle, "And Sherlock and I will have rollerblades with jet packs in the wheels so we can still chase down criminals."
The secret "Save Sherlock Holmes" crew had grown by one in number. "I know we've not seen the results yet but I took the liberty of asking him to come. If we ARE dealing with the supernatural no one is a better amateur expert.", Martha assured them.
"What ARE you mumbling about?"
"Actually, I'm suddenly feeling quite sprightly, ta Martha."
A brief tutorial and Martha was set. "Let me know when you're ready."
🛡🛡🛡🛡🛡🛡🛡🛡
John smirked as settled into his chair, "And as for just sitting there - you'll see soon enough. Ho! Ho! Ho!"
Sherlock and John tumbled in the door bent over with laughter. "Never thought I'd see the day when your brother actually left half his tire tread on the street."
And when their wankin' is done
"I advise you to drop the subject, forget this ever happened and tell Mrs. Hudson that she owes me TWO flicks of her magic wand for the indignation I've endured. Now get out of this bloody squashmobile so I can skulk away with at least a modicum of my dignity still intact."
jwatson18: come on, holmes. live a little.
jwatson18: nice. I like it.
mholmes: sherlock, I love greg. I take back everything about caring being a disadvantage. greg make me stronger. he makes me want to do better.
sherlock was thrown off guard by the question. he had never been in a relationship, let alone been to someone's house that he was romantically involved with.
jwatson18: please tell me I won't make fun of you. I promise.
when john entered speedy's, he went over to sherlock. john sat down, not saying a word.
jwatson18: you're not like other people.
JWATSON18 HAS LEFT THE CHAT
jwatson18: it's like you don't even care.
"john, we just watched 30 minutes of a mid-age single woman give relationship advice. my question is, what makes her entitled to give relationship advice?"
sherlock felt the same. ever since victor left him, he hadn't felt normal. john made him feel human.
freakholmes81: speaking of college, I have a class in 20 minutes. so I must go. goodbye John.
john had been just on time. actually, he stood outside the cafe for 7 minutes, because he had trouble gaining the courage to enter the cafe.
jwatson18: everyone needs a friend sometimes. don't you want to talk to someone sometimes?
mholmes: how would you know john? you’ve known him for two weeks.
jwatson18: oh yeah.
jwatson18: sherlock, man. sherlock.
freakholmes81: why are you so determined john? why are you so compelled to talk to me? I'm nothing special.
mholmes: must you ask me about everything that happens romantically with my own brother?
"because I want to be your friend, Sherlock. why can't you understand that?" John questioned with anger in his voice.
freakholmes81: john, can we please talk about last night? please?
freakholmes81: do you actually want to know?
"uh, sure. why not?"
"see you tomorrow, john watson."
i just got back into sherlock.
jwatson18: well, of course. nobody compares to you, sherlock. i've dreamed of being with you since you corrected our psych professor.
freakholmes81: oh...
jwatson18: gregory, do not be like that.
freakholmes81: well of course I'm being serious.
jwatson18: he told me. at speedy’s, he confided in me. he told me how different you two were in the minds of your parents.
jwatson18: talk to you another day, Sherlock.
sherlockholmes81: i'm okay. but i do have a question for you...
greglestrade: I don't.
sherlockholmes81: what the hell?
jwatson18: and minoring?
mholmes: oh god it's victor all over again.
freakholmes81: why would I tell you my name? you would probably make fun of me just like everyone else does.
jwatson18: I just wanted to talk to someone...
jwatson18: sherlock, that was a rhetorical question.
jwatson18: weird question, but how come you don't change your username back to whatever it was before.
jwatson18: all our talking yesterday and I still have a few questions that I didn't ask.
jwatson18: a ton of people like you, sherl. do you really not notice?
greglestrade: are you sure he was talking about you, johnny?
freakholmes81: caring doesn't look good on you.
freakholme81: I don't have friends, John. nobody wants to be friends with me, because I'm different. I'm weird, John.
jwatson18: but you like me?
sherlock just sighed. "are you absolutely sure?" sherlock asked unsure. all John could do was nod.
sherlockholmes81: well... none of them are you.
jwatson18: oh my god.
john raised his hand to sherlock's cheek. "let's just go watch movies in my living room, okay? does that sound okay with you?" sherlock nodded and they continued walking to john's apartment.
hello
freakholmes81: you actually punched anderson? damn it, john. you've just made everything worse for me. god, I knew becoming friends with you was a bad idea.
freakholmes81: that’s why I am so shocked you wanted to be my friend.
jwatson18: yeah... one question and you may not like it. who keeps changing your username to freakholmes?
jwatson18: hello sherlock. how was your day?
sherlockholmes81: I've never made one of those before.
freakholmes81: I want the ”caring is a disadvantage” mycroft back.
sherlockholmes81: of course I do, john. I just don't want to ruin our friendship. you're my best friend.
"you too, sherlock holmes."
when sherlock had gotten to speedy's, he was beyond nervous to see john. he had never had a friend before. sherlock had always told himself he had no friends because he was too intelligent when in all reality, nobody wanted to be his friend. this was a new feeling to sherlock.
the two boys sat in speedy's until it closed. just getting to know each other.
freakholmes81: speedy's cafe?
JWATSON18 HAS LEFT THE CHAT
jwatson18: like you're any better, mate. like you are any better.
jwatson18: give me one reason why I should forgive you, sherlock.
i've had a hard time with the girl i like recently.
sherlockholmes81: you like me?
jwatson18: let's make a vow.
john pulled sherlock over to the side of the sidewalk,"sherlock, i'm not going to make you do anything that you don't want to do. i don't even think i'm ready for what you're thinking about." sherlock rubbed the back of his neck, "no, i know you wouldn't. i've just never been to anybody's house before, let alone somebody i actually like."
jwatson18: hello sherlock. how has your day been?
JWATSON18 HAS LEFT THE CHAT
freakholmes81: I know you won't see this, but I'm truly sorry. john.
“Oh!” Sherlock’s face brightens. He jumps out of his bed, wants to hug John but stops just in time.
‘You had enough chances. It’s not my fault if you still don’t know where mum and dad hide them after all these years. They use the same spots. Every. Single. Year. I am not responsible for your ignorance!’
Sherlock mutters something, sits up.
Sherlock’s scared heart races. He can’t let such an experience as the one with Adam happen to him ever again. He has to stop touching himself, at least.
Sherlock embraces the coolness of the restroom. His cheeks are flushed. He hides in the last cubicle in the row.
Outside the weather is warm. It’s the end of May, summer lurks right behind the next corner.
“Who are they? How many? Where do they come from? What do they look like?”
The anger spreads through his body now, makes him clench his teeth.
“Still here”, he answers, his voice breathy. “But I have to go now.” He has not.
Sherlock shakes his head, but he doesn’t make another move.
“Go away”, Sherlock whispers. Blushes with shame.
“Bye, Mum.”
Colour: Dark grey
Sherlock interrupts her. “Can you send
“Then we are going to bake something and bring it to Creepy Cottage. In an hour at my place?”
He feels discouraged. He was so proud of his collection, so happy. He knew John wouldn’t think the same. But John’s reaction now just makes Sherlock sad. Because bees mean something to him. Because John has gifted him a bee. Because he wants to share something he loves with John.
He is wet and he is cold. He cannot touch the stars and he cannot breathe.
When he finally rises his lids his eyes are too dark. His heart has stopped beating. But he is right there now. Observes the moment. When he looked around the last time there were cornflowers. They are gone now.
cock.
‘Don’t tell Mycroft’, Sherlock whispers.
I can start my collection today, Sherlock thinks. He leaps to his feet. More careful this time. Cautious to not knock his head on the coffee table again.He shudders. His morning robe is dusty now. He hates it. He shuffles the robe off and lets it fall to the ground. He vanishes into the kitchen to get a tweezer and some clean petri dishes.
The door is teared open. He has forgotten to lock it!
He lets go, spills his semen over his fingers, his pants turn wet.
Twenty-seven insects I found in our garden
A whole notebook on John.
The three boys leave and silence creeps back into the room. Sherlock sobs.
They arrive. Sherlock’s parents are waiting for them outside. His mum comes down the gravel path. Gives the boys a warm welcome. Pulls Sherlock into a hug. Eyes his feet. Turns towards Mycroft.
But Sherlock just keeps staring. Watches how John’s hands disappear under water. He can just imagine what they do under the surface. John’s face tells him, pupils dark, lips parted.
Why does John use a dating website?
“Experiment”, Sherlock explains briskly.
Sherlock doesn’t leave his bedroom the following day either. He feels miserable from the lack of sleep. Stays in bed the whole morning. Stares sadly at the now empty top of the drawer where the flowers wither.
John opens his mouth. But no words leave his lips. He just nods.
Crawls behind the sofa. Here, as always, lays the biggest treasure. Surrounded by eggs sits a chocolate bunny. Sherlock rips off the golden tinfoil. Bites off the ears. 80% cocoa. Blissful. Especially after the very sweet milk chocolate earlier. The bunny has gone a bit soft. Behind the sofa the heater is radiating warmth. Sherlock doesn’t like his chocolate getting sticky. Formable. He stuffs the rest of the bunny in his mouth. Breathing is a bit not good now. He chews faster. Swallows hole chunks. He has to take off his scarf now. Even pushes up the sleeves of his coat a bit. Just so that his wrists lay free. It’s quite cosy between the back of the sofa and the heater. He hasn’t sat here in years. Remembers reading Treasure Island and Moby Dick (not enough pirates!) for the first time in this spot.
He moves into a more comfortable position and his robe shifts. The sheets are on his bare legs now. His skin tingles. There is a small movement between his thighs, like a memory of the dream he had earlier this morning.
trembles.
But he has never seen John’s whole body.
“ASMR video. Autonomous sensory meridian response. You know, these amazing sounds. Helps me think.” Sherlock babbles. The ivory bee, that started Sherlock’s bee collection, passes by. He has marked her with a little colourful dot of Mrs Hudson’s nail polish. John follows the insect with his eyes.
He has had four orgasms, yesterday only. He has turned into a wanking mass, a clichéd teenage boy.
In a rush he grabs the package and runs to his room, slams the door behind him.
John isn’t logged in. But that has never been a matter to Sherlock. He knows all his passwords.
“It’s a pretty small fence”, Sherlock says.
“I’m bleeding again”, Sherlock says.
Accidentally Sherlock touches a sticky spot. Strawberry jam. John’s strawberry jam. Days old. He rubs his fingers on his shirt. Frantically.
But Sherlock’s body wants to focus on just one thing: The touch.
“Three weeks?”, Sherlock repeats questioning.
“I hope there was no dangerous bacteria inside the broken petri dish?”, John asks.
But for now he sits down, prepares an object slide. Some fibre from the living room.
“A bite, John! A bite! Did you turn stupid over night?” Sherlock lets go of the hand which makes a funny noise when it hits the asphalt. He jumps to his feet, removes the gloves, tosses them on the ground. Stomps away. He is angry with himself. He didn’t mean to be so rude to John. But there is a sensation inside him that makes him anxious.
He is fifteen, already tall, but a bit too skinny. His hair is even messier back then.
Sherlock puts his coat on. ‘Are you coming?’
He closes the door, sinks on the wooden floor. No dust at first glance. He bends down, looks under the bed, makes a find. No dirt but a magazine. That hasn’t been there the last time Sherlock has checked, three weeks ago.
The bell rings a second time.
Sherlock listens.
He decides to skip breakfast, brushes his teeth and gets dressed instead. Rummages every cupboard, every drawer, every shelf. He once had a bug vacuum which is nowhere to be found today. So he has to stick to glass containers like the jam jar. He gathers some of his pharmacy glasses, prepares each with a drop of honey, then puts the jars into John’s woven shopping basket. Sherlock is good to go. His lips curve upwards in excitement.
“Right.” Sherlock nods.
How can he focus on anything else than these bright blue eyes?
“Why?”
Sherlock rips the knife out of his father’s hand. Leans over the table. His coat sleeves in the sauce. Pokes around in the fish’s mouth. Puts the knife down. Uses his fingers now.
John turns around. Blushes. “Oh, yeah. A delivery for you.”
In a split of a second he rushes into the kitchen.
I step back into the hallway. No one has the key to my mind palace. No one but me, obviously. But when I’ve come here a few moments ago the door was already opened. Who has opened the door? Who has made this mess in my kitchen? Who has hidden the morning sun? Anxiety hits me. I am too curious for anxiety.
But Sherlock is already back in the bathroom, rushes to finish brushing his teeth.
Adam turns around. He has blond hair and beaming eyes.
Sherlock’s heart starts to beat faster. His mind, his heart, his body – everything is longing for this. But there is also fear, insecurity and embarrassment inside him. He wants John near him so much. He wants John in his bed so much.
Observing John’s hands: When do they touch my skin? Where do they touch my skin?
For a moment John is standing still. Sherlock waits for him to say something.
‘Oh, Sherlock. I’ll get you some of dad’s socks. We can’t have you barefoot all day. You’ll catch your death. Come on in, boys. Come on in.’ Mrs Holmes pushes Sherlock towards the house entrance.
Sherlock groans. Annoyed. “Gloves”, he orders. Lestrade hands him a pair. Sherlock puts them on.
He can’t see right, the living room is filled with smoke. A whimper comes from the kitchen. John drops everything he is carrying, rushes to the big floor-length windows and tears them open. Then he hurries into the kitchen. The smoke burns in his eyes.
‘I won’t’, says Sherlock. He needs his coat. To hide. Hide the disappointment.
Sherlock looks around. There is his book shelf, filled with stories about travellers, adventurers and explorers. On his desk is a collection of old jam jars, now home to several insects.
“I promise.”
John stares at him for a moment. “I guess I am done here, aren’t I?”, he then says. Without Sherlock he doesn’t really know what else to do. It’s always the consulting detective who tells him what to do on a crime scene. But in another life it was John who gave orders and was in control of the situation. For half a year it was just nice to follow someone around, spending no thoughts on which way to go. But since a few days John feels a nervous trembling inside him, telling him to become the one in charge again. Commanding Sherlock certain things. Commanding Sherlock to kneel down, look up, open his mouth.
Hair colour: Blond
“Are you still there, honey?”
“Sherlock!”
“No problem at all.”
“Oh, come on, John. You really think so? This house is nearly two centuries old, no one cared for it for the past thirty years. It is a ruinous hovel. I can’t imagine anyone being interested to live there. They will have to spend so much money on refurbishing.”
He shifts, sits up.
John looks up from his newspaper. “I don’t know what you said, but because of your excitement I guess there is a crime scene that awaits us.”
“Hoo fap wap befoa.”
“Excuse me, but what are you doing over there?”
“But everyone knows that Creepy Cottage is a haunted place.”
And there is this boy Sherlock really likes, thinks of him way too often. Adam.
His heart aches, simply aches. No explosion of colours, no big geometric shapes. Just pain.
There! Sherlock’s fingertips touch something hard. He wriggles them around a bit. Then he seizes what caught his interest. He pulls it out. Holds the tiny object up between slimy fingers. It sparkles under the light.
“Sherlock, is everything alright in London?”
‘Ready?’
“Sorry, Mum. I’m working on something. Nothing extraordinary but it requires me to stay in London.” Stay by John’s side, Sherlock thinks. But he doesn’t say it aloud, obviously.
The tearing is almost painful now. A white and pink streak. Sherlock shakes his head.
But it is something else.
The sight is blurring again, Sherlock rubs his eyes.
“Pewn beach”, Sherlock mumbles.
“I guess my Dad will welcome them to Dorset Bay anyway today, introduce himself as chief inspector. We can wait what he has to…”
Stinging water runs inside his lungs, runs up to his mind, runs down to his heart.
Sherlock blinks a few times. Gravel scrunches beneath his feet, the air is filled with the perfume of blooming flowers. Besides a few joggers and mums with prams the pathways are abandoned.
Sherlock straightens his back. Has to focus now.
He kicks at a pebble stone.
When Sherlock puts some flowers under the bell jars a bumble bee escapes. Unnoticed.
“What is that?” He points at the bee jar.
‘In the bloody river, of course! John, call Geoff...George...Jerome...Lestrade.’
When he takes a deep breath the world around him shifts back into place.
His fingers fumble with his trousers’ zipper. His cock aches because of the pressure.
Sherlock wriggles his toes a bit, pushes one pedal down. The bicycle jumps forward, restricted by the kick stand. Sherlock gives a little yelp. Before he can stop it the bike rolls into the kitchen table. The handlebar turns a funny angle. Sherlock and the bike fall on the floor. Hard.
Sherlock wants to get out from under the chairs. A bit hectic now.
The door flies open, laughter enters.
The next morning another jar waits for Sherlock on the kitchen table. The escaped bumble bee inside. A post it sticks on the lid: "Look what I found! A fat one! J."
He starts to move his hand, cautious. His mind, not as productive as usual the last days, goes completely blank. Sensation and colours are everything that is left inside him.
One second. Two seconds.
Sherlock follows John, a tingling sensation inside him.
But he can’t think straight.
“Will you help me?”
Adam knocks on the cubicle’s door. “Are you okay?”
When he can see sharp again he lays in his bed in his old child’s room, Redbeard at his feet. The dog is sleeping. Snoring while he dreams. It must be early in the morning, the sun starts to rise.
Sherlock doesn’t give an answer. Sobs instead.
There is a movement on the wall,
My brain’s wintriness is gone. But in a way it is still bleak.
Sherlock can’t remember. Is occupied by the feel of melted chocolate on his tongue, coating his teeth.
“Just the broken glass, John. I haven’t finished the kitchen yet.”
He has to try to avoid this word somehow.
An online dating website.
Sherlock wants to be taken care of by John as well.
“Wait.”
Something is taped on the first page.
Sherlock isn’t much of a nostalgic person. But now, as he sits on the floor, cross legged, he grabs the first one in line, labelled
Sherlock is already asleep. He sleeps rather regularly these days, John notices. Remembers nights when his flatmate played the violin for hours or sighed way too much.
They make their way to the bathroom. John helps Sherlock sit down on the closed toilet lid. Then gets the first aid kit. It’s nothing new for the both of them.
“You spoil the mystery”, Lip snarls.
There is something wrong this time.
Sherlock just stares, eyes opened widely.
“Bye.”
A cool breeze comes from under the door. Mrs Hudson must have opened a window. Dust particles start to move, get caught in the fibres of the carpet.
Sherlock smiles. He has absorbed John’s warmth, feels cosy and pleasant. Later he will call for John to get a cup of tea. But for now he has to think about his strange feelings. There is still a lot to investigate.
A bicycle. Sherlock cannot ride a bicycle.
He moves his hips to get rid of that feeling. Doesn’t help.
I am in a vacuum. Am I in space? I am alone. That is one last thing I know.
“Hi, Sherlock. Been out?”, John asks while cutting tomatoes.
“I can bring you something inside.”
“Toilet”, Sherlock breathes through clenched teeth and storms out of the classroom.
Sherlock eyes it. There is an inscription on the inside.
He has to go back to John’s room immediately. Has to put the box away. John mustn’t get any hints of what Sherlock has done in there.
“I’m busy.”
A6, blank, black, hard cover, same company. Each is labelled on the spine and front cover.
‘Too much chocolate?’ No accusation but concern.
One two three.
He starts organising John’s clothes. It takes longer than usual today. Sherlock presses his face into each jumper, each t-shirt. He needs to absorb John’s smell. Aftershave, perfume, washing powder, sanitizer, sweat. Masculine.
“It’s a bit… just a bit scratched. And needs a new bell and lamp”, Sherlock stutters.
And further:
There is no time to pull the brake. My thoughts start running, flooding, overwhelming.
Sherlock collects his petri dishes from the floor and coffee table, brings them to the kitchen where his microscope is located. There are only fifteen clean petri dishes left. Sherlock makes a mental note to order some new ones. Not the 100 pack again, he adds. He should have gone for the 250 option already. He also needs new test tubes. It bothers him that he can’t finish all the rooms in their flat today. Perhaps he can send John to Barts to pick up some petri dishes there.
Books to read
“Please, listen, Sherlock. I don’t know what’s going on, but please talk to me.” John sounds frantic now.
Sherlock is awake now. He blinks. He stares. It’s the perfect opportunity to search John’s body for scars. But he can’t think of scars now. He can’t even focus. He just gazes.
“No. You don’t put 500 petri dishes in our kitchen.”
“Not very original.”
Sherlock nods to the book on the floor. “Stepped on it.”
to me?”
But Sherlock can’t observe this rule for too long.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Tell me later. Let’s get you fixed up first.” John. Pressed voice. Constraint exasperation. Finally looks up.
Too late I notice that the face has come closer. It is just centimetres away from me, gapes into me without eyes. But I feel the stare and I feel something behind that mask.
Also their intentional touching had increased. Sherlock found incredible creative ways to be touched by John.
“Fine. But we should still keep an eye on the wound. I don’t want you to get an infection. I will help with cleaning and bandaging, okay?”
Sherlock’s answer is a small noise. The tears are still running.
He spreads his arms, takes one step forward and lets go. Falls from the cliff.
The doorbell rings.
“I started a bee collection.” Sherlock sounds uncomfortable. “But I stored it in my room, not the kitchen anymore!”
“And why are there bees in the living room?”
“You are like Mycroft. Always working.”
“We are fifteen!”
He cries like he never did before. He clamours. He calls out.
‘Fish isn’t fattening. But thank you for your concern, dear brother.’
But John doesn’t wait for an answer, walks straight into Sherlock’s bedroom, followed by his flatmate.
He can’t let Sherlock talk to him like that. Imprudent, dismissive. A low growl leaves his throat.
‘Now we know where she is’, Sherlock says.
“I think I got a bit lost in my household filth collection. I had to analyse some really interesting fibres. And suddenly everything was filled with smoke. I wanted to put the pot in the sink but instead I burnt my hand. It was supposed to be pasta.”
Sherlock shivers.
The first time he was worried. Thought that Sherlock had collapsed or something.
Everybody stares. Has finally stopped moving and breathing.
And he hates it. But he can’t help it.
“That’s not dull, that’s normal.”
What phraseology is that? Sherlock is puzzled. But he has no time to think about it now.
“John, don’t be dull.”
John looked under his bed and could see that the magazine had been picked up. It wasn’t laying at the exact same spot he had placed it a few days before.
Fried eggs. Currently in the pan.
John’s face is so close now. Concerned. Focused. His eyes scanning Sherlock’s body. His hands following. It would have been a nice moment if not for the circumstances.
It takes minutes for John to go back to normal. God, that orgasm has hit him hard.
John coughs slightly. It’s not the time to get aroused again.
“Doesn’t matter.”
John looks after his friend for a few moments. Then he goes home too.
This time Sherlock remembers to unlock the kick stand first. Then he straddles the bicycle. The saddle is obviously adjusted to John’s height so Sherlock’s feet stand flat on the ground until he lifts them onto the pedals. Immediately the whole situation gets a bit wobbly. Not much different from his experience last morning.
“I heard that”, Sherlock interrupts.
“Old enough to stop believing in fairy-tales and ghost stories.”
Sherlock inspects the object. “It’s a notebook.”
‘Gladys! That’s Gladys Willoughby. She vanished a few months ago, probably died. Way too young. Only in her forties. Didn’t come home one evening after walking the dog. The dog came back eventually. Without Gladys. They never found her though’, his mum explains.
Sherlock is sure now. He has to make a household filth collection. Too convenient to neglect this. It will help solve crimes even faster.
Sherlock makes a noise. He doesn’t want to get stitches.
“Okay then. See you at Sally’s”, Greg says and walks away.
His mum takes the ring from him.
A sudden pain lets Sherlock gasp. It shoots through his lower abdomen. His trousers grow very tight around his crotch. He shifts on his chair but can’t find a comfortable position.
“I thought I could prepare dinner for us”, he whispers.
“Watson!” A crumpled note lands on John’s desk. He turns his head. It’s from his friend Greg who sits a row behind him. John unfolds the little piece of paper and reads. His eyes widen in surprise.
Sherlock collapses on the bed, muffles his groans with his pillow. Bites into it. Breathes in, breathes out, until the orange splinters fade into darkness.
He remembers himself scribbling down his notes, taking the little book everywhere.
John isn’t convinced. The book is the only thing laying on the floor. But he has no time to think about this now.
“Look out, I broke a dish.”
Finally Sherlock looks up, his bright eyes widely opened in surprise. His lips form a silent “Oh”. He is taken aback. Flinches. Wants to cover his face with his hands, expects to be hit, searches for protection. But he can’t move, John is too strong.
Drip drip drip.
“Without agars. It’s too much fun to prepare them myself.”
“No.”
A sigh from Mycroft. Eyes raised to the ceiling.
Sherlock plops the chocolate egg into his mouth.
He stands in the street, his home right behind him. Red dots flash around his pancreas.
“Creepy Cottage has new inmates”, Mrs Lark reads out loud. John doesn’t need to look at Greg to know that they have turned red in unison. The whole class sucks in their breath, no one giggles, no one coughs.
‘It smells very delicious’, says John quickly.
His cock pulses so hard it hurts. It still releases sperm.
Across the street in a small front garden bright flowers gleam. The perfect place to start a bee collection.
His eyes are flickering.
When Sherlock came into the kitchen this morning, drowsy and yawning, an old jam jar sat on the table. A tag, bound with a piece of string right under the perforated lid, said “To Sherl, from J.”
, in fabric.
John has thirteen pairs of socks, most of them grey, most of them old. Sherlock rummages his flatmate’s drawers sometimes. And, of course, he observes. John even has a favourite pair. Black and white stripes. Sherlock likes ringed patterns.
“I don’t know. But, honestly, they are just normal people. No vampires. Or werewolves. Or whatever. It’s time for us to grow up.” Greg sighs, kicks at a pebble.
Why is John not predictable anymore?
I look at the balls that spring over the floor. They look back at me.
He crawls to the door, pushes it open. Bleak hallways like caves, graves, wombs. The walls come closer.
But their project doesn’t last longer than two days. And that’s not because Sherlock has already finished everything.
John has new ones, Sherlock notices. Pants, not socks. Two dark grey pinstriped boxers. They look…nice. Sherlock swallows. Wonders if John has ever worn them. An image flickers through his mind, sends sparks through his body. He has to part his legs a bit to still sit comfortable. He goes on with the tidying up.
“You don’t make one single step until I’ve cleaned your mess.”
He shrugs again. Because he doesn’t like it when he isn’t good at something. Or can’t even do it at all. But he’s not confessing that to John.
Sherlock hasn’t noticed that he hasn’t said anything for a few moments.
He hears the bathroom door open. Footsteps. Bare feet.
He misses his Mum, this wonderful woman with an incredible abundance of patience and sympathy.
Tonight Sherlock tosses and turns in his bed. There are too few noises coming in from outside but too much creaking in the house. The fresh air is cool but the sheets are hot and have lost their clean feeling. Sherlock shudders. He wriggles around. His head is filled with pictures and voices and thoughts.
bleeding.”
One two three.
“Leave! Me! Alone!”
But he can fall and so he does.
They go to the same school, have chemistry class together. He sits right in front of Sherlock, has two little birthmarks on his neck.
“Look!” Sherlock shakes the hand now.
Sherlock hops over a small fence that separates the trail from a flower bed. He kneels down, doesn’t need to crawl deep inside the bed. Nearly every blossom nourishes a bee or pretty butterfly.
‘Don’t eat, don’t drink, don’t move! Don’t breathe!’
“Morning”, Sherlock mumbles, blushes. He looks adorable with a bit of pink on his otherwise pale cheeks.
One two three. One two three.
Wrong.
He takes Sherlock’s hands in his. Sherlock lifts his head. Lips parted. Stares. There’s a nice tingling building in him. He can smell John’s slightly musky scent.
Sherlock smiles, his inside tickles.
“John?”
He gets up, needs to change his pants first. Clean himself. But not while John is still showering.
A bit concerned. He still is John.
Sherlock swivels around. Marches into the sitting room.
What has he done?
Mycroft shoves him. Sherlock steps on a crack. His heart sinks.
Sherlock turns over once more. His pillows a wild mess under his never resting head.
A soft knock on his door. The breakfast scents are getting stronger.
“No. I wanted you to know first. Maybe they already know after Mrs Lark snitched the note and told everyone in class.”
How many scars are there he doesn’t know of? He has seen the big one a bullet has left on John’s shoulder. He has seen the three streaks on his arm. He has noticed the little one right above his eyebrow.
“We need to go where?” It’s Lip, his girlfriend Sally right behind him. They had PE, their faces are still flushed from the exercise.
Sherlock hasn’t done this many times before. And it has always been in the safety of his own room, under the duvet, in the middle of the night. Too embarrassed to do such things during daylight. But today, now, the urge is too strong to bear anymore.
“Whea?”
“Household filth.”
His hand is wet with dew from his length. With every stroke it makes a smacking noise now, rather vulgar.
John seems satisfied with the air pressure in the tires so he moves on (moves back) to check the brake lever. Again.
He toddles into the living room.
“Poof.”
The corner of John’s mouth turned into a smirk. Sherlock’s confused face must’ve looked gorgeous.
The evening is beautiful, still warm, purple light. John enjoys the walk.
Sherlock turns off the water. He takes one of his very big bathing towels from the shelf and wraps himself in it. He sinks down on the cold tiles.
With a pounding heart Sherlock flips through the pages.
I stare.
For a moment he is frozen, lingers in the air. Then his body shivers and he starts to move his wings. They take him over the sea until he is merely a shadow against the blazing evening sun.
Sherlock is eager to do so.
Sherlock has to examine himself.
“Mh?”
When Sherlock kneels down on the carpet John crinkles with his newspaper he is reading.
“Freak!” The voice belongs to Jimmy, a broad-shouldered idiot who loves to bully weaker people, especially Sherlock.
“Yes. Yes, I am okay. Bit of an upset stomach”, Sherlock lies. He frantically tries to close his trousers with one hand. The excitement of the orgasm is completely gone and he is mad at himself. Why did he give in to such a primordial need while at school?
“John! Glad you’re here!”
“No, John. Not petri dishes.”
A few seconds later Sherlock’s mobile beeps, indicates an incoming message.
And during the day he can get quite stuck on it. But at night with nothing to do but wait for sleep it starts a whole avalanche in his head. And this time it is not even a random sentence he can let spin around on its own.
He is laying on his stomach. Firm mattress. Soft pillow. Starched fabric on his skin.
Sherlock doesn’t bother taking off his coat, wraps his duvet around him, cuddles up.
Glooming fear crawls through my neural system. This door cannot be opened by anyone. This door has to keep closed under any circumstances. This door is not allowed to even exist anymore.
Sherlock jumps from his chair, runs past John into the bathroom. Locks the door behind him. He can’t bear it anymore. Has to calm the heat that builds inside him, between his legs, inside his loins. He undresses, his pants are dry now. When he steps into the shower a single translucent bead falls down.
‘You’ll catch a cold!’, is John’s reaction, while Mycroft tsks, shakes his head, curls his lips.
Sherlock wants to observe again.
He sighs. Because there are too many feelings inside him, too many colours and shapes. They have to leave his body somehow. Sighing helps, sometimes.
I need to glance now.
Sherlock gasps.
When Sherlock comes into the living room something is different. He stops. Blinks. Rubs his sleepy eyes. His view clears.
He wants to be caressed by John for ever. It’s soothing.
John does not care. He still has bed hair. Wears the t-shirt he sleeps in.
“Wohm! We haff a murbar ap Wondon foo!”
“Then go get them yourself.”
“That was just this one time when the Smiths moved here to live with their grandparents.”
‘But now I’ve lost!’ Sherlock’s voice wavers. Just a little. He feels the disappointment inside him. He never loses. Never.
Sherlock imagines how it would feel to touch the other boy’s wavy hair. To kiss his freckled face, to lick over these pale lips.
‘It’s a ring!’, John then says.
He feels lonely, lost. Although he always claims that he loves the loneliness it drags on his heart. He has hoped that John would become something like family to him. But this thought has gotten shattered today.
John laughs. “Your petri dishes, your problem.”
“No!”, Sally interrupts Greg. “We go there by ourselves. Doesn’t your Mum always bake a cake for new dwellers?”
Engine noise (Ford?
He can tell this to John now. It doesn’t matter anymore because he is nothing more than a freak to him now.
Something has fallen from the ceiling.
No waterfall, no John.
He looks at the text message again and his enthusiasm blunts a bit.
“Hey!”
Today the kitchen lays in darkness. I stop at the door frame, cautious. I inspect the room. The tiles are dirty. In the bowl on the kitchen counter all my apples are rotten to death. Even the flies lay dead beside what was once fruit.
For a moment they just stand there in silence. The buzzing bees the only sound in the room.
“Please, don’t”, he begs. His voice is shaking.
Once again, Sherlock is confused. He doesn’t know why he feels uncomfortable with John knowing about the bee. Normally he doesn’t care too much about what people think of him. But it’s different now. Sherlock can’t let it happen that John as well thinks his flatmate is a freak, like all the other people already do. Or the most, at least.
It’s an easy task to fill glass after glass. But the last two containers remain empty. Instead Sherlock starts staring, observing, dreaming. Still sitting between the flowers.
With shaking hands Sherlock takes out the army trousers. If he could see John wearing them just one time!
Sherlock counts. 98 seconds until he moves a bit. Shoves the bike off him. He needs to get back to the flat. Needs to wake up John. Needs to tell him what happened. To his bike.
The sky is dark, the sea is dark, his suit is dark. But the boat is glowing red. He cannot feel the heat just the pain when the fire melts into his skin. He lets it happen, watches, observes. There is nothing inside him but ash. A burned heart, a burned mind.
The streets are empty, the sky is blue, the air smells like ice cream. Sherlock closes his eyes, just listens, just walks. Absorbs this late spring morning. He can feel Redbeard at his side, almost. He can taste the cake his mother used to bake every Sunday, nearly.
Sherlock puts the other petri dishes on the kitchen table behind him while he still stares at the broken one. He wants to move aside. Steps into a piece of glass with his left bare foot. The splinter cuts through several layers of skin. Blood and pain. Sherlock gasps.
When she hears it’s her youngest son on the other end she is alarmed. She isn’t used to be called by him.
Are my eyes open or closed? Do I watch the drops falling? What is this lightning in my mind? It sends my brain into shock. It stops working. My brain never stops working.
And the tears are running down Sherlock’s cheeks now.
Household filth collection.
“We should go on a tour together one day. Out of London. Down to the coast and back.“
Then he turns around and leaves the bathroom.
I gasp.
He always leaves the first page blank. Then he writes down. Today’s date. The title.
“John?”, Sherlock asks from under the chairs. “John? Can you go to Barts and get me some new petri dishes?”
“You don’t have to be. We all know he throws a tantrum every now and then.”
Strength, longing, bewilderment.
I take my first breath. The air is ligneous and a bit dusty. Calming. I am home.
I still think about accessing the room.
But there are big crispy crumbs on the floor. Not fresh ones from John‘s breakfast at dawn but the kind that mingles with dust. So as fast as possible Sherlock shoves the bike off him and scrambles up onto his feet. Prickling all over from the thought of old bread crumbs touching his morning robe, body and hair.
“Shut up. I don’t want to know.” Adam’s voice is cold and harsh, his face stony. With a pitiful look at Sherlock he turns around and leaves.
What is the next number? I can’t remember. But I know that there are more numbers than just one two three.
John takes the first-aid case from under the sink. No need for his doctor’s kit this time, at least.
After a couple of minutes he still watches the little bee whirring inside the jar.
“Of course! Bumble. I have put him in-“
He doesn’t want to be predictable to Sherlock anymore. And he wants to find something out, too.
Sherlock lies in his bed. Needs a few seconds to adjust to his surroundings.
“John!”, Sherlock yells again.
One day, he thinks, he will come out of the shower like the day Sherlock got his new petri dishes. All naked and wet. And when Sherlock starts to stare again, he will just grab him by his hips, drag his ridiculous sheet away to have a look at the boner his flatmate is hiding under the fabric, and press him against his own.
John is still smiling.
John is dressed now, his marvellous body hidden under one of his ugly jumpers.
John licks his lips. Thinks of how he wants Sherlock’s head between his thighs. He turns hard, just a little bit, just enough that he has to move his leg to feel comfortable again.
“I don’t have time for
John comes home late. After work he went to a bar with some colleagues.
His head feels dizzy, he blinks a few times, finally gets up.
“Alright. Take care of yourself, honey. I love you.”
Like lava the pain rushes up his leg.
John turns around and disappears inside the bathroom.
He gets mad at himself. A whimper leaves his lips.
Then he sinks back down on the toilet lid. The water upsets his stomach. It hurts.
And then the ceiling breaks apart, he is falling into space. Galaxies form and explode. Moments pass, millions of moments.
Back at their flat he goes into his bedroom and doesn’t leave it for the rest of the evening. He tries to fall sleep, but fails. Hugs Bumble a little bit tighter this night.
“Just go to your room. Just leave me in peace until I’m off to work.”
Sherlock stumbles ever so slightly, opens his eyes. The brightness stings. He should have taken sunglasses with him.
Jimmy comes a step closer, is in the small cubicle now. “Your pants are still open. Ready to wank, right?”
“Nothing exciting”, Sherlock says and turns off the light of the microscope. “I… er… need to go.” His chair scratches over the floor.
“Seems like I am the master of the needle.” John wraps Sherlock’s foot in a new bandage, then he tidies his stuff. He bends down to help his flatmate to get up.
Plates clatter around him. His dad prepares the knife to cut out some fillet strips for them all.
It’s too late now. He has turned into a weirdo right in front of John’s eyes. Everyone’s right. He really
He just sat and observed.
“Go away!”, Sherlock yells.
“Let’s wait for the first bee”, John says. They sit down on Sherlock’s edge of the bed and keep looking, waiting.
Sherlock stares at the oven form in the middle of the table. The fish laying dead in a lemon sauce. Only its eyes missing. Usually Sherlock wouldn’t mind. Usually Sherlock doesn’t eat an exaggerated amount of chocolate eggs that make him sick. Now the sight and scent give his stomach an uncomfortable tingle.
Sherlock pulls the handle. Cold water extinguishes the flames.
The first strokes are slow and hesitant, but his grip is firm. He sighs with satisfaction. His head turns backwards, eyes closed.
I feel every single drop. One two three on my forehead. Too cold. Too monotonous. One two three. The same distance hands touch on clock faces. One two three.
Thursday 31st December -
Long will we Johnlockers come
"Holy shit, Sherlock!!"
"Hilarious Watson, but it is a good photo. Hudders was so impressed she went out and bought a similar phone. It was nice of her too thinking to get this extra print for us. It inspires me to concoct erotic fantasies."
"John Watson if this is a glitter bomb..."
"15th August, Relaxation Day."
She turned to the mirror. "Mycroft was the young man who you desired when he laboured in the name of the monarchy. Sadly, he discovered my 'secrets' and threatened to tell the new King. That could not happen but neither could I slay the brother of my sweet Sherlock. I cast a spell placing him in this mirror with the promise that the enchantment would be lifted when he found his need for love once more."
It is something John has said. It is something tied to a conversation. An expectation.
His hand moves faster, his fingers are clotty with translucent liquid. Smacking noises fill the otherwise really quiet restroom. A clutter of tension builds inside him, his cock twitches and Sherlock has to let go. He clenches his teeth to stop himself from crying out when his cock tenses and releases a hot stream of semen in his hand. In waves the orgasm rushes through his body, most intense in his loins and urethra.
“I didn’t mean to… I never wanted…”, he starts, desperate to explain himself.
Something touches my bare feet. I am alarmed. More insects, I think. I don’t look down.
There is a knock and the door opens. In comes Mycroft.
People look at them but turn around as soon as they spot the crying detective. Sherlock doesn’t care, he can’t stop the tears from falling, chokes on them. John wants to pull him in an embrace, doesn’t do it. He is too scared.
“It is. But it signals to not enter the flower beds.”
In the next chemistry lesson they sit next to each other, heads tilted over one book. Sherlock has forgotten his. It was planned. So they have to share Adam’s. Their faces are just inches apart from each other. And while Adam reads, eyes flickering over the sentences, Sherlock observes his features.
Greg sighs. “He is always right. That’s why I have to call him.”
Redbeard’s meals + eating habits
, opens it. The pages are yellowed on their edges. He has used graphite pencil back then, his handwriting crooked.
He needs to dedicate a notebook to John. A whole notebook full of deductions. And now also questions. John has never been a person to ask questions about before. What has changed?
Sherlock is grateful to wash away the horrible taste in his mouth. Drinks greedily. Splashes his face with water.
A butterfly net might help, Sherlock thinks. But he doesn’t have one. And there is no time left to organise one.
“I’m not –“
“Yes.”
John flushes the loo.
Once a palace it is no more than a haunted cottage now.
Eye colour: Blue
‘Sure, Mrs. Holmes.’
Sharply, Sherlock sucks in air. He even bends down a little bit, his knees growing weak.
A bumble bee lands on the lilac flowers.
“Listen, Sherlock, I’m here to apologise. It was wrong to open your package.”
“Yes, of course!”
His mother shoves little baskets into his and Mycroft’s hands.
John sighs. “Can’t it wait until later? Why are you dressed, haven’t you slept? And what happened to your… Sherlock! Are you bleeding?” Gone is the sleepiness. He’s out of bed in a second.
John sits down on his mattress, drinks his hot coffee, lets his thoughts run.
“My Dad saw them yesterday when he went on patrol. They moved in during the middle of the night", Greg tells.
I wipe my hands on whatever I wear. For the first time I notice that it’s my blue morning robe that hangs from my body. In addition to that I am dressed in a grey shirt and pyjama bottoms, both cotton.
He sits up. He is in a boat. It is a funeral.
“It was Anderson again, right? Did he examine the body? Oh, why do I ask? Of course it was him! Just an idiot can ignore it.” Furiously he grabs the hand, nearly hits John in the face with it. “Look!”
After arriving at Regent’s Park they sit down on a bench. Sherlock holds the two jars very tight in his hands. Doesn’t want to let go.
The pain is an orange pond.
“Beach.”
“So am I.”
Their driver puts the heating on. Accelerates. Sherlock groans. Some curls stick to his forehead. His feet are cold on the prickly carpet.
“Sorry. Ouch! That hurts."
Sherlock sits up. “What is it?” He makes room for his brother to join him in his bed.
He stalks into the living room. The bicycle still standing on the carpet, ready for the day. But it won’t get its first outing with John. Carefully Sherlock manoeuvres the bike down the stairs out on the street.
a freak.
He thinks of John. Wishes he could tell him. Wishes that John would explain these weird feelings.
Sherlock still presses his face into Bumble, hides under the blanket. He feels a movement, weight is added on the mattress, the sheets rustle. There is a pressure on his shoulder. Is John touching him?
Breathing (my own)
‘What’s that for?’
“Sorry”, John whispers, who has just made the first stitch. Three more to go.
Dad’s eating habits
‘Leave out your idiotic games for a day, why don’t you?’ Mycroft grabs for a napkin. Sherlock hits his hand.
John isn’t completely hard yet, but the thought of being observed by Sherlock is arousing. It doesn’t take more than a few strokes to feel his complete length in his hand.
Shower gel. Spicy. Minty. Fading. Approximately 12 minutes since shower.
Two new websites. A blog about blogging.
Sherlock freezes, just for a second, then hops from the chair. “Oh, er, there was a fly”, he says.
Name: John Hamish Watson
There is a twitch between Sherlock’s legs. He gasps, grabs his sheet tighter.
Scars:
But the bees don’t care for the honey, explore the flat instead, bump against window panes, crawl over furniture.
Memories. They don’t cross his mind too often.
“John, what are you doing?”
Captain Watson leans towards him. “Don’t you ever dare to speak to me like that again, do you understand?” His voice is low, hoarse. There is still fury rushing through his body. But also a soft tickle.
Microscope
“No.”
When John climbs the stairs to their flat, he senses that something is wrong.
I scream, I run to the edge. Fear clamours inside me, rushes through my veins, into my heart. I prepare myself for the worst, the ugliest, the truth, the death. I prepare myself to see the body of the one I love being shattered on the rocks. But can one really prepare for that?
‘But...a body! A corpse!’ Sherlock’s face, so pale after the vomiting, gets a healthy colour now.
Sherlock extracts a long white hair from the carpet. Doesn’t look like it belongs in here. He is curious. A new dog hair, maybe? Attached to one of their shoes and brought into their flat by accident?
He turns around, takes Sherlock’s hurt hand in his own. Careful.
I am not.
“Breathe, Lip”, Greg says, laughs. “I don’t know a lot. Dad didn’t observe much. Just noticed a removal van and two helpers unloading it in the dark.”
“Okay.” Sherlock’s voice is low. “I think I’ll go to bed. Thank you.”
Sherlock feels the warmth of John’s body. Ever so slightly he presses himself against John’s side.
the wall. I glaze in horror while featureless faces form inside the walls around me. They press their heads into the wallpaper that stretches around them.
“Bees.”
“John”, Sherlock says.
John leans against the kitchen counter, opens his trousers and slides one hand into his pants. He needs to have a wank right now. This boy turns him into a masturbating mess.
Mycroft and John think differently.
I know that when I enter the room I will be safe from them. But in this room there lurks something much bleaker than those creatures.
He arches his back, his left hand tenses into a fist.
There is another touch at my feet. A motion.
“So you said.“ Two times already.
But Captain Watson has to stay in role. Has to make his point clear. He likes the confusion in Sherlock’s eyes. Wishes he wore his uniform right now to turn little Sherlock into an aroused mess. His cock twitches.
Nostalgia. Again. Apparently because of his notebooks he has flipped through last weekend.
“Good morning. You are up early”, John says as he joins his flatmate in the kitchen.
“’lo”, Sherlock mumbles into the speaker, toothbrush clenched between his teeth, foam running down his chin.
‘We have the heating on. You’ll be hot soon.’
“What?” Sherlock is confused.
He was calm all morning. Then his robe has gotten dirty. Then he has run out of petri dishes. Then he has touched strawberry jam stuck on the kitchen tiles.
Something soft touches his face. He opens his eyes. Just a bit.
A red flash shoots from his knee through his body. Blinds him to other injuries. And for a moment he just lays there. Dazed. The bicycle still on him. The stones beneath him damp from the early hours of the day.
The 250 option is 300 £. The more one buys the cheaper it gets. Sherlock orders 500. 490 £. He uses his brother’s PayPal-account for payment. Delivery on Tuesday.
By the time he has calmed down he notices that the shadow behind the door is gone.
Mycroft, on the threshold to the sitting room, raises an eyebrow.
Birthday: 31.03.1974
The Creepy Cottage hasn’t had any residents in the last thirty years. At least not
Why did my body focus on John’s touch so much when he bandaged my foot today?
John nods. Gets his doctor’s kit for the second time today.
Sherlock stiffens under the touch. Too afraid to even breathe.
“Everything’s alright. A murder, John! What a wonderful day! It’s been four weeks since Lestrade needed me. Four weeks! Can you imagine? I nearly thought he was dead himself.”
I can’t have any hallucinations inside my mind palace. I can’t have any dreams inside my mind palace. There can’t be any intruders inside my mind palace.
John starts unwrapping the foot. Doesn’t touch Sherlock one single time.
Coffee. From the machine.
He feels the joy of childhood deep inside him. Collecting and observing insects had been one of his greatest pleasures back in the day. The circle of nostalgia is white today. Excitement.
Sherlock sits on the floor, his right hand clutches the left one.
“You ever did this as a child? Bike tour with your parents and Mycroft in the summer holidays? That’s how we explored the country.“ John smiles, lost in memories.
“Go back to class, I’ll follow you in a moment”, Adam says without looking at his friends. His eyes are locked with Sherlock’s.
He has become nothing more than a cliché, Sherlock realises.
On their way to the zoo, Sherlock’s anticipation is nearly gone and he even strolls, his steps small and slow instead of eager and fast.
He must have looked puzzled because Adam now giggles. “Manner of reaction of alkanes”, he helps out.
Sherlock heaves the box on the floor, opens the lid.
They have to be gone before John arrives. Caught in jars again. Or completely gone. Out of the window.
Cinder rises into the sky.
“I need your help”, Sherlock says. In a very small voice. Without looking up.
Right then he hears that the door gets opened.
Twenty minutes later Sherlock’s fried eggs are cold and untouched. The nest is empty. A rather sick-ish feeling builds in the back of his throat.
“Then I won’t.”
Words I like
“Creepy Cottage! Someone moved there, can you believe it?”, John cries out.
Why does John hide his new email address?
The first bees fly away, rise higher and higher. Sherlock follows them with his eyes until they disappear. He keeps staring into the twilight.
Sherlock sighs, grabs the fifteen containers and is on his knees again, crawling over the kitchen floor. A single corn flake, bread crumbs, apple seed, peas, pepper. The kitchen is easy. And dirty.
He has experienced something like this before. But dreaming of John is new.
One two three.
“My petri dishes, probably”, Sherlock says, toneless.
‘Didn’t you want to try a new diet, Mycroft?’
“I have something for you”, Mycroft says. He hands Sherlock a little black something.
But before Jimmy can make a move the door bangs open again.
“I need to do our other rooms first. Mind if you don’t clean today?”
“500 petri dishes?”, John echoes.
says please that John sits up. Rubbing his eyes until he gets a better view of his flatmate perched on the edge of the mattress.
‘A nest?’
The policeman’s expression changes, slides his hand to his belt. “Sir, please come out of the flower bed. Now.”
What’s wrong?, he thinks. Why isn’t my mind working as usual?
Oh, it’s a brilliant day for touching, feeling things! He will be barefoot all day.
He is much taller now, much larger. His body is covered in beautiful blue scales, he has wings, a tail lashes behind him.
They agree.
The swaying of the car. The sugar in his stomach. The lingering sharpness of the toothpaste. It makes Sherlock dizzy.
Sherlock looks up. The object slide slips out of his fingers. The fibre is lost. Doesn’t matter. Sherlock has to look at something else now.
“Redbeard is dead. Mycroft has changed. My parents live their own life. Bumble is the only thing that is still the same. He reminds me of home. Warmth and security.”
Sherlock tries to smile.
“Well…”
“I do my best”, Sherlock lies. In reality he hasn’t eaten in two days.
With little tubby sounds the tiny body bumps against the glass. Extremities like threads jitter in the air. Antennae slowly move back and forth, scanning for scents.
His mother’s handwriting. His bee has arrived.
It is fascinating. It is amazing, in some way or another.
He holds his face into the pouring water so he can pretend that there are no tears in his eyes.
Redbeard’s weight before and after taking a walk
www.laboratorysupplies.co.uk.
“I stay in bed”, he says.
He falls backwards onto the hard floor, parts his legs even further, claws John’s army trousers with his left hand.
“Bloody hell, I don’t have to get up for another hour.”
Sherlock pulls his other leg up onto the lid, leans his head against it. Watches John. Watches in silence. Shivers a bit in the cool bathroom. Goosebumps spread.
A weight is taken from Sherlock’s chest. A weight that has kept him in place. But now his knees are trembling, the tears are falling.
Sherlock pauses.
Another plop and another and soon it hails.
John hugs his flatmate with both arms now. “It’s okay. Whatever it is, it’s okay. I’m here.” Gives the duvet a tug so he can see Sherlock’s messy hair, caresses the dark curls.
I shudder.
Sherlock’s shoulders shiver ever so slightly. John is worried. Wants to touch him. Reaches out. His hand lingers in the air.
He grabs the second one. It starts with his wish list for Christmas 1982.
But he has never given in to the compulsion. Only when he was a teenager, and even then it was just a few times to test this new function of his body. He never had anyone to share his experiences or feelings with. So he decided to neglect this whole part. It worked fine. Until recently. Until John.
It’s easy to avoid it in everyday life. Usually. But today it broke through the surface like a worm that eats its way through an apple.
Sherlock notices that John moves closer to him.
Sherlock decides to keep it.
“You okay?”, John asks, but Sherlock has already rushed out of the kitchen.
There is a crescent in his chest, the opening turned downward, facing his entrails. He feels sorry. Because he has snapped at John. It’s not like that he hasn’t done this before. But he doesn’t want to behave that way towards John anymore.
Attitude. Last month’s copy.
Sherlock notices his looks. “Just… went to get some medicine”, he lies.
It is not so much a loop but an endless script. Again and again.
“You didn’t tell them yet?”, John asks.
John turns around.
He does not know. So he just waits and stares how the blood drips on the floor. It must be a big cut because there is a lot of blood. The foot aches. The glass still inside.
“What?”, John asks.
First fingers, then hands, then arms.
“You can’t hurt yourself every other day. I am not your personal doctor.” Although John would love to be. He would strap Sherlock to a stretcher and examine his body, especially his lower abdomen, his penis, his bum, his pr…
“Jimmy Fink. See the wound on his forehead? Someone hit him with a spade. Cause of death.”
Sherlock braces up, wrapped in his sheets. Stumbles. He can’t coordinate his moves when he is drowsy. He blunders against the wall. His foot still hurts.
“Did something happen between you two?” Greg knits his brows, waits for an answer.
He feels a sudden urge to have it near him.
Sherlock beams.
‘Couldn’t you wait until your brother was finished getting dressed?’
“What do
Breathing in, breathing out.
He sits up. He is at home. Ash trickles out of his mind, his heart. Ash is on his skin. The fire place is abandoned. He feels the cold. He stands up. His suit is gone, he is covered in darkness now. But his eyes are a beacon. He walks up to the ceiling. The world does not turn. He falls down on the floor. He is broken.
It’s a tiny bit romantic, although masturbation isn’t romantic at all to Sherlock, as far as he has an opinion on that.
I should start a collection of household filth, Sherlock thinks. Does dog hair count as household filth? He has a separate collection for that in the bathroom. He doesn’t think of dogs as filthy creatures.
‘You need to get some water back into you.’ John guides his friend to the sink.
“No, you can’t. I need more containers!”
“John”, Sherlock mumbles. He lays in his bed, still sleepy and dreamy.
It’s hard to banish the thoughts of the other man, naked. Distraction is what his mind needs now. An experiment.
“Three weeks, mate”, he says. No one has called Sherlock “mate” before. A yellow curve appears inside his stomach.
A strand of hair touches Adam’s cheek, Sherlock wants to brush it away. But, of course, he doesn’t do so, continues staring instead.
“Sherlock, open the damn door!”, John shouts. The water stops running.
No traffic, no tourists, no pedestrians, no school children. Not yet. Baker Street lies empty and tranquil.
The metal frame is scratched, the bell dented, the lamp shattered.
else.
But how can he concentrate on this dull project when Adam smells that good? Like freshly cut grass and shampoo.
“Can you open your window, please? This flower box is a bit heavy.”
‘Do you want to lie down a moment?’
The words are a sting in John’s heart.
Books
He jumps up. Knocks over his water glass.
They end with two big jars full of bees.
Honey bees
Sherlock has put his bees under two massive bell jars. They sit on his drawer. He needs to improve their housing soon.
On the stove sits a pot with some black indefinable something inside that still gives off clouds of smoke. John doesn’t care, he drags Sherlock along behind him into the bathroom.
“Let’s go downstairs. Come here, I help you.”
The pain turns into a white ray that rushes through Sherlock’s neural system. He makes a sound he is not proud of.
I need a summer coat, Sherlock thinks. He feels exposed without being wrapped,
“It’s healthier for me to ride to work on this instead of taking the underground all the time“, John goes on.
A chair leg scratches the floor, makes an awful noise. Sherlock likes it as long as he is the one moving the chair.
‘Thank you’, Sherlock mumbles between bites.
Penguin Beach
I reach for the handle but I am too scared to touch it.
Sherlock pushes his toes into the mattress. Focuses on the pressure. The weird patch the sensation leaves in his mind.
There is a sharp draught that lets my eyes water. Something vast rises into the sky. I look up. It’s him. And it’s not.
Adam gives him a suspicious look when he leaves the class room again.
John helps his flatmate get up. He wets a tea towel and wraps it around Sherlock’s hand.
The sofa behind him moves. He looks up. John.
John, freshly showered, wearing nothing more than jeans. Tight jeans that don’t hide the wealth of his crotch. No waistband of any pants is shown. Sherlock’s eyes linger on the path that goes down from John’s navel. Dark blond hairs. Short, newly grown. They weren’t visible a few days before when John wore the towel.
“I need to pull the glass out. That will hurt.”
He puts an index on the next two pages. He numbers every page in the book.
Sherlock sighs.
Sherlock traipses into the bathroom to brush his teeth, the tiles cold beneath his feet. The mint of the toothpaste mingles with the sweetness of the chocolate. Too much, too strong. Sherlock spits into the sink, rinses his mouth out with water. That has to do.
“That was quite a show in there.”
He can’t help it anymore. His hand glides down his loins. His mind doesn’t really know what to do, but his body tells him.
The world starts spinning. He rises. The sea is glowing red. But the sky is dark, his suit is dark.
“Of course you did.” John sighs and leans over the corpse.
“You are staring.”
Twenty-five petri dishes are filled soon. The flat really
‘A wedding band’, Sherlock says. ‘Gladys W.’
Wants them to ride a bicycle together.
Sherlock is a shadow behind the interconnecting door to his bedroom. He peeks through the keyhole.
Sherlock tenses a bit. „Sure.“
“They have to go. Tonight. And we try catching all the other nineteen flying around in our flat, okay?”
“I know you really like bees. But I never intended to keep the bee I caught. I never imagined you would catch even more and let them live in our flat!” John rubs his face with his palms. “Sherlock, you can’t keep bees in a London flat. You know that, right?” He looks at his flatmate.
I have no time to think anymore.
Mycroft’s eating habits
He has to wash his hands. Now.
