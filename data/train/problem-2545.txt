With his eyes still closed, Castiel imagines what Dean might look like right now under the lights, hunched over a guitar, his soft lips butting against the

It’s slight, but it’s an encouraging sound and Dean hollows his cheeks and sucks, dragging his lips from the base to the head and back down again with a

It’s actually a pretty decent view from this piece of wall. Castiel always appreciates a venue designed to make the entire place a front row seat. He has

“No.” Castiel answers, and Dean’s lazy smile is the last thing Castiel sees before closing his eyes and kissing the man again.
