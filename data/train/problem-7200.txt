What is up with the nerd squad and surprising her today?
"Oh, no, I'm just processing, I'm probably gonna have a meltdown sometime soon." she assures .
"Nope! The people in the upper PR said Ms. Jones was working on this for a while, and they cleared it a week ago. These were taken in Wakanda!" she pointed at the photos.
: before he starts again and goes on for an hour.
If someone could just kill him right now Thor would be eternally thankfull really. Please just someone kill him
But Peter reserves the right to claim that everything that went wrong this time  is entirely his aunts fault.
"Hey, Wade, mind letting me walk?" Peter managed to say even though he didn't look particularly bothered by being smushed against the merch -if his grin was anything to go by-
: *blushing Peter jpg* here you go, a tomato.
When the bell rang, Peter practically sprinted out of the room. The only reason he was visible was because he had to keep his identity a secret and he didn't want to leave MJ alone.
: *pale as a sheet Flash jpg.*
Holy heck Mr. Stark!
"Uncle Bruce and you talk about god knows what."
Flash sighes, "I kinda always knew him and I were never gonna happen, its fine, I'll get over it."
"Well, that trip is happening tomorrow, and I took the permission slip, and dad signed it, but our teacher Mr. Collins said, 'Peter your lie about the internship has gone far enough as it is. You could fall in serious trouble if it goes on record, and after that you forge Mr. Rogers-Stark's signature?'" Peter takes a breath to calm himself not looking at Steve.
He's fine, just frustrated.
"You did kinda just adopt everyone. And then proceeded to act like a mother, 'sides, I think everyone likes having you as team mom." he begins another sketch of times square this time.
"The doctors try literally everything for him. It just doesn't work." Tony sounded frustrated. He wraps an arm around Tony in support.
Peter thought he impressed the judges enough. At least, the head to toe black clothed dude didn’t find anything to say against him before they left, but he didn't say anything at all so....
From: Spiderson
"See, this is what your attitude should be like, and that's why I like him better."
"Nuh uh"
"Sir, I'm not here for the tour, I'm here on my internship." Peter answered. " Mr. Tritter sighed,
"Mr. Keaton"
Con: he looks sad
And that is how Peter found himself on the tour bus of Midtown High waiting to go on a tour to the building  that he lives in as though he didn't help with the newer updates designs.
a guy from a gala
"Excuse me, Dr. Odinson-Banner,  how do you know Leeds" Flash asks elbowing himself towards the front of the group.
Peter was glad to see that no physical harm was done and breathed a sigh of relief. He looked towards Ned and MJ to see Ned with his hand over his mouth, and MJ biting her lips to stop laughing. She also seemed to have her crisis notebook out.
"And besides, I thought you didn’t want to hear all the R18 rated one liners I have for him. "
Steve looked up from Tony's face and immediately his eyes landed on Peter. The boy sighed.
There was a bang on their door.
"No, It's today." Ned replied.
Whatever.
"I didn't know robots could talk so... well, or swear for that matter." Peggy says. She gets more and more interested in the robot the more it talks.
"I summoned you for a reason. I want something " he says sounding more, way more confident than he felt.
Ned and MJ exchanged a Look. MJ groaned and Ned shook his head.
"Wait, you actually do like me? I thought Brunnhilde was just kidding, you don't really have a reason to like me, and I thought Hulk would be an anti incentive since that thing in Sakaar and he did hit you before too, besides you're so gorgeous and you could have your pick of person why would you choose me and now I'm rambling, ... "
: 'ned mj and peter  are already taking their college courses on line, do you have the ability to do that with the job and high school?'
Flash looked rightfully intimidated. Even though -Ned suspected - Steve was actually trying to keep his anger in check.
What to do when you adopt a teenager by Anthony Edward Stark
"Why, do you think it takes an entire month for these- conferances to finish up." Thor says as he dodges a punch from Steve.
"Fine, I'll think about it."
Peter started calling the rest of the Avengers uncles and Natasha Aunt about a year ago when he was adopted. Wanda let him off because She's more of an older sister than anything,  he didn’t even realize he was exempt from being called uncle since it seemed natural for Peter not to.
NO I WILL NOT CALM DOWN!
"And what do you have for me now Friday?" He questioned, and a holo-screen came up in front of him. The video was a survalaince footage, of Peter.
"Friday? maybe you should gave warned me that my class is coming to the tower?" he says waving hello to Ned and MJ.
: when you date Deadpool. And want to introduce him to your class
"Whatever Bitch."
"Excuse me?"
"I...... You know what I don't have to answer that." Bucky looses it yet again and Nat took a bottle from the fridge. Its labelled as Natasha's and he's pretty sure it was Vodka.
"Peter, he keeps going about deferent universes." Bob points out.
: bea the friendly robot?
"Wait you're joining classes with us?!"
:oooookaaaaayy.
They don't get off on the right foot. That's ok though. He got to see the fire in his Star's eye. And not just from afar. It was directed at him.
"SON OF LEEDS! Great to have you here again! " Thor places a hand on his shoulder in a position Ned vividly remembers his dad uses when he's about to try to say Memes.
Tony's blood began to boil as he saw and heard what was being said.
"I- you - but- how the? - I have been saying that for months! "
"Ok, I know you’ve been gone for like twenty minutes,  but we just got the magazines,  and holy shit Miss Jones did it!!" Mami practically squeals.
"Oui, now, let's get the two of you set up in your departments!  You're in marketing and you’re in reasearch right now right?" she points to Betty and Cindy respectively.
Understandable.  But is he cute?
"Your child. " the reply was simple, calm, as though the demon didn't just ask for a human child.
The man in question mumbled,.
"I- i love you too, I love you so much I can't -" Bruce's mouth was covered by Thor's before he could say anymore.
From :GeniusBossBitch
: that boy worships the ground you stand on.
"I know I just....got.... caught up, I didn't mean to I swear." the three men sighed Steve ruffled Peter's hair
"Midtown high?" Bruce questioned, "Peter's school?" His eyes scanned the crowd and lit up when he caught sight of Peter.
"he's a nobody, nothing special, he's not even that smart. Just puny Penis Parker." he smirked, and Peter wondered, not for the first time how he got into a school for actual smart people.
"The magnet that looks for trouble,  It's inheritency at this point. " Clint wisely shut up when he noticed Steve's grimace.
"Mr. Parker, I must insist that you leave the premises immediately, you were not allowed on the field trip and should not be here." Mr. Tritter said and proceeded to walk towards Peter to deliver what was likely to be a very stern lecture.
"But he could still leave" he protested weakly.
Anyway, Wade takes out his phone and texts his most likely culprits,
:no? Where is wade?
Would you like some more pictures to post?
"Really? why didn't you tell me?"
Shut up paulina
"It has been a while since I've been summoned by a human. " the creature's voice was soothing, like an old friend,Howard jolted with the realization that every part of the demon is made to entice.
×××××××××××××××××××✗
Peter didn’t realise he was breathing heavily until Clint  squeezed his shoulder.
He was working on some of his codes when he saw Deadpool running for his life. Peter perched on his shoulder leaning down as to not get knocked on the head by door frames.
Remember how he mentioned Parker luck laughing at his face in the beginning ? Yeah, it's doing exactly that right now. Peter can feel something is about to go wrong (which he can but you know what he means)
"You know how Peter missed a month of school last year?"
"Hey! What gives?" Tony pouted
Thank you! See that's how you become encouraging yellow.
"Hey, what can I do for ya today?" Charlie smiles warmly. Cindy thinks they could be friends.
In hindsight he really shouldn’t have left the tower without the nanotech suit or maybe he should have paid more attention to his surroundings because one minute he was just putting his phone in his pocket, the next he woke up on floor in a dark room.
"Yes sir? " don't ask Peter how his AI managed to sound mischievous but that's exactly what she did.
A true american hero. *salute*
Not that it's not cleared, but why?
"You also keep our families safe" Clint
"Oh, I think we have a tour group coming in today, want to freak them out?" Clint grinned impishly. He took out his phone and began messeging someone
"I'm on a field trip  milady FRIDAY ." Ned said. MJ scanned her pass and got a quiet greet from FRIDAY as well. Then, Peter scanned his own pass,
"Don't look at me like  that, he was giving me puppy dog eyes."
They're not going to answer you
"So, I Have  been... Notified that you just started today."
"Tony!"
"And what exactly...." Natasha looked from Howard to Tony and back to Howard, " do you mean by there is no way for him to be Anthony ?  Besides he just said that his name is Tony" she raises an eyebrow to emphasise her point.
"Kid, you came with us the last five missions, there's nothing small scale about you." the robot (she really needs to stop calling him that) says reassuringly.
Thor and Dr. Banner just came out as bi and in a relationship I am living.
: is this about the time I panicked and called at 2 am
:  it's kinda ridiculous ngl.
Steve frowned and looked towards Natasha, she nodded at him to do it and his worries increased, Clint is a prankster, and Sam helps occasionally, sure, but what got Natasha in their plans?
(Image of Peter working on an armour)
I can't take this anymore.  @ fe-male @ ActuallyIrish 🅱lease, just check the  # brokenstony and comment
"Carry me?"
"My name is Natasha Romanoff, I'm one of Peter's aunts." she says the trace of laughter still in her voice.
"He must have hacked the AI! " Flash exclaimed. MJ gritted her teeth then made eye contact with someone behind him. a minute later a mechanical spider jumped on Flash's head and the boy was jumping around trying to get it off. MJ smirked and the rest of the students laughed. Mr. Tritter tried to Get the spider off the boy's head and succeeded to do so after a minute or two (or ten, but who's counting?)
"No, not really." Betty says solemnly and that was that.
: what did you unleash Sally?
"Manage what Flash?" he asked flatly. The limit to the amount of time he could deal with douches in one day exceeded after that terrible phone call.
: there's this thing called time zones.
Letting the AI in your suit report that to get backup and not tweet about it jfc
"Guys, come on, let's meet the Avengers!" he exclaimed a bit... childishly and proceeded to heard the tour group towards the elevator.
Peter sighed remembering the great Stony debacle raised after a photo of his parent's honeymoon got leaked.  Half of his school went through a celebrations of gay, some wanted concrete proof, the rest didn’t particularly care.
"Yes we are."
"Can you help fill Erskine's quota or not?" Howard asks after he realises his guest was not going to reply.
But he knew that he had. He knew that he had no other choice, That more than anything is what encouraged him to prick his thumb to spill the drop of blood in the fire.
JFC bruce banner just destroyed Flash.
: ????
"What the heck is he even doing here?" Eleanor  said out loud. It came out louder than she probably expected it to because everyone was looking at her.
"Is this the kid you thought didn’t have an internship or whatever?" Tony waved a hand towards Peter, looking at Eleanor .
Babyboy are you ok? You should be in hospital since your pants are obviously on fire from that lie.
"Come along kids! We don't have time to dawdle.  We need to get moving! " she hearded them towards the receptionist area,
"You love Peter then?" MJ asked wade replied "with all my heart" and Peter groaned,
No one saw him coming
Unfortunately Tony noticed,
: it's
He's also going to have a lot of people who dared to touch his Star.
"uhh....around.....15? I think?" Peter counted.
"Wha- PETY-PIE?!" was the eloquent response from the merc with a mouth.
He shook his head and made a mental note to check the footage from FRIDAY. )
"Why?- Tony why would we ever-?"
: how are the B a h a m a s Jason?
"It's fine Alice, you should go now, see what damage Amilia managed ."
"And who," Natasha - who was in the meeting too for some reason - pronounced looking at Mr. Stewart
Peter jumped on top of the teacher's table getting everyon's attention.
Peter froze,
: oh come on I'm not that bad!
The face plate lifted and Peggy was surprised to see the face of a man from inside.
Steve let out a sound of frustration.
Seeing Wade's face light up like Christmas tree, even when his face is covered in a mask, he decides that MJ's analogy of them being the puppy type boyfriends is absolutely correct
: guys?
: of course you do.
"W-well you see, he has been saying that he has an internship at Stark industries since his sophomore year and gave no actual proof of his claims.  And then suddenly he starts wearing better clothes after wearing old ones for a long time, and he gets new phones and accessories and gets homemade food and all that so everyone thought he was involved in some sort of drug trafficking and that's how he got the money to get all the new stuff."
"This boob here didn’t " Bucky pointed out Steve and took a seat on the floor.
Peter rolled his eyes, " just, yesterday you were talking about how poor I was? What did I pay her with Flash?" Peter checked to see if everyone had a pass and began to heard them to the avengers exhibition, while simultaniously reciting the history of Stark industries .
Peter blinked, was he supposed to be hurt?
Peter looks around for a weapon and sees nothing.
"Dad, think about it for a sec"
"So.... You think..... Peter is.......  Selling drugs?" Steve asks slowly. Peter groans and hides his face in his hands.
Tony Stark : you may think I'm just a Millionaire who doesn't care, but that's not true
"Howard,  " Steve began in a warning tone only to be stopped by the older inventor.
××××××××××××××××××××××××✗
"Coffee is life sustenance and I'm doing everyone a favour by making it easy to attain." Peter raised an eyebrow at that.
: his boyfriend might be tho idk.
Tony Stark just came out like an icon. I stan 1 (one) white man.
Gimmi
"Enough about that boy though Steve! You have to tell me what happens in the future! Does flying cars exist yet? What happen to my company?  I bet Obi kept it the top weapons company in the world!"  Peggy questioned her friendship with the man not for the first time.
"It's going to be a bit crazy  today, Mrs. Romanova-Potts' intern is coming down here today, so everyone's on their toes. " he shrugged,
"I'm fine dad! I thought they would be harder to beat , so I pressed the panic button- " Peter tried to appease.
"No, I'm not going." Peter grumbled.
: Bea the katana held by Wade.
: wait…. AaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA
Alfred shook his head in sympathy,
"It... slipped my mind?" Peter smiled innocently at his fathers.
"some of us were the target of your pine rants"
He looked at Peter,
"You're kidding me right?" Sam says.
Peter really didn't want to spend an hour each month listening to Steve's PSA's (especially since he's the guy Peter calls pops and he knows for a fact that Steve barely followed a rule in his goddamn life) but he apparently didn't have much of a choice.
"Yeah, why?"
"but I have a tour to lead here."  The other intern looked even more frazzled. And then she noticed Peter.
He didn't let Bucky kill Howard.
"Captain! " the man in the eye patch calls him. He steadies himself. He can't lose composure now. After all, all good things to those who wait. And his star? His star is the best of all.
"Nah, it’s cool. " he says and shuts his mouth firmly so that he wouldn’t blurt out something more embarrassing yet more true to his thoughts like,
By the time he reached home, his pops was already making breakfast. He and his Dad, (who is a hypocrite because he has terrible sleep schedule too) wanted him to stay home and rest for the day. Peter begged off saying that he had a test. (which went better than he expected). a compromise was made that he would rest tomorrow and patrol early today.
: and he said from Canada not that he's living in Canada.
"Flash has a crush on someone? Who? And how do you guys know?" he looked between his friends.
"Mr. Parker did you hear me?" his teacher nudged him.
: he surprised me!
I'm crying asdfghjkl they're together!!!!!!!!!
"Wait, I didn’t know they came looking for you, why the hell didn't you tell me you came looking for him? Are you trying to get killed?" Bob asks Mr. Yelli
: we could live text you?
"We should do something about the Bully kid. " Steve says as soon as they leave the room.
"But the shot hit his buddy beside me and hit his thigh.  Before he could do anything else, I grabbed the gun, but I kinda overestimated how strong he was holding the gun so I kinda hit the driver on the head with the gun with the force I was using and the dude passed out- "
: 'Ned is coding robots for cleaning entire rivers in a matter of days. What exactly have you done?'
From the other side of the video call Brunnhilde raises an unimpressed brow
"And I wanted to get off but they already started the car so I wanted to tell them to stop but the guy next to me had this spray out. I think it was to put me to sleep? "
"Hey Eugene, I'm pretty sure my eyes are the healthiest organ in my body, and all because of how many times I have to roll them at what you say, should I thank you?" MJ says in her monotonous voice. Someone snickers in the back.
Who are you though?
NoticeMe @ yuuki
Steve looked majorly unimpressed.
হহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহ
: by the worst of it we mean the pining.
The voice laughed lightly,
"That's Vision, he's..... an AI but he has a body. And I'm Peter. " he says. Peggy raises an eyebrow at the robo man,
"And not my business?  That's hysterical.  You were about to assault my son. The heck do you mean not my business? "
"Actually they were gonna join the earthlings in Trondheim vikinlag. What they wanted was the royal family to be there. " she says and Thor gets the distinct feeling that he's missing something.
"Mr. Stewart is this about the clothes?  I just got new ones because my old ones got ripped " also why did this have to happen in the middle of class with all the other student watching?
"Not as much as it probably should." his dad mumbles right when the door busts open and the rest of the family rushes in.
Everyone turned to Ned and MJ. The latter scoffed and turned back to her book, and Ned raised an eyebrow, " you guys didn't believe us about the internship. Why the heck would we tell you people about the adoption?"
"Wait, stop please, Sara, I'm not really that special, and besides, there's a tour?" Peter cut her off pointing at his gobsmacked peers bar Ned and MJ , and she seemed to come to her senses and began distributing passes to everyone mumbling something that sounded suspiciously like 'Peter Parker knows my name'
"There are a lot of people? And I think this event's one of the big ones so they need more time in organising. " Steve says as he immediately grabs Thor in a chokehold.
: which is to say they don't have a single ounce of self esteem between the two of them. But they chug the loving boyfriend juice on the daily.
"Here?"
"Bruce, bruce, you are, one of the most brilliant people I know, how many could even do half the things you could do? And I don't know how to make you believe but you are beautiful. You are possibly the most beautiful person I have ever had the pleasure to meet. And I love that Hulk makes you stronger. I love everything about you Bruce and I am in love with you."
"Friday, send this footage to all the Avengers, and the undead asshole and Pepper too, so she would understand why we have a dead kid in the facility."
"Just Ned is fine. I'm not really your boss." he sighed.
"Whaccha talk about?" Tony asks when he gets to him.
Yes please! His pictures are always welcome!
Stop exposing me child. Don't you have somewhere else to be cute?
Tony's eyes widen when he comes to a realization.
WHAT?!! No! This isn’t real right?
Steve: please don't get our son a giant teddy bear. Whats he going to do with it?
Bucky saw the frozen young hero on the doorstep and smiled,
: MJ!!!!!!
The teacher waved him off "It's ok if i call either, they're both your father"
"Yeah, don't worry about it it was just a picture of me. I kinda still want to see your crush, but if it makes you too uncomfortable I wont pry." he shrugs.
"Are you or are you not putting Mary as your project? "  Ned asks in leu of greeting the next day.
"Pay who? Maddie? I don't pay her, Mr. Rogers-Stark does." Ned replies confused.
Peter finished another mini lecture by the time they reached the lab. When they did enter the Lab though, Peter froze for the second time that morning.
Steve. he just finished his breakfast with the whole family  there.
"You know Flash on some days I think that you'll grow some common sense someday, but then I see your face everyday." MJ. says.
Steve got up and gave her a hug, Barnes stayed behind.
He knew the future held more promises. Besides, he might not do anything but he always has his Star to watch.
"We may be petty enough to use Mary, but not enough to tell about his crush" Ned says looking apologetic.
"Wha- excuse - Mom??!! Why am I mom? How am I conceivabley mom? I'm vodka aunt, or at the very least weird uncle since I quit drinking" Tony looked high key faux offended.
"From, Peter's school?" The Captain asks.
Granted he was getting way better at it since he started to go to his uncle Bruce to clear up what he didn't understand.
Flash sputtered but became quiet, he was happy to get the tour of Avengers tower.  if only for the reason to prove that Peter Parker was not an intern here. he was even more glad to hear that the intern that was giving the tour didn't know anyone working there with the last name Parker.
Peter shook it off and went to the kitchen, and then promptly froze.
++++++++++++++++++++++‡
It had the hight and measures of Obadiah Stane, his face looked like what Peter had seen in the picture as Aldrich Killian only fatter, and the dummy was bald and red. It's his aunt's favourite dummy to shoot at so there's plenty of bullet holes.
Eleanor blinked, they could tell it wasn’t a reaction she expected from Peter. She gaped at him for a while before Peter answered Himself,
From: Spiderson
Tony merely shrugs,
To the media concerned There will be a press release held at  02:00 pm tomorrow. We cannot disclose the reason as of yet, but it is of extreme importance.
Babyboy that's not even ten percent of the pictures I have of you.
"Yes?"
: yeah i know. And apparently genius didn't even tell Ned and MJ since he didn't want to worry them.
He was debating whether or not to receive the call when his father noticed his constipated look.
So when she came down for breakfast this morning and didn't utter a single word about being bored and was looking like she was trying very hard not to smirk at him, it put Peter on edge.
Peter sends him a glare, "that's NOT what I said. That's the opposite of what I said. Dad please don't get my boyfriend to murder my classmate"
"He didn’t tell me who he was drawing and I guessed it was his crush,  you should have seen his face, he looked so in love" Tony sighed.
MmmmmmwacchaJ
"......Ohhhhhh, in my defence, whatever you found out, it was probably Peter's idea." she says after a minute, right as the boy joins them.
"It's ok, MJ you can say you have a crush on her."
: ahem, dear classmates, can one of y'all at least live stream?
Shut up Paulina
Me, a confused fool : That's great Mr. Stark! I'm so happy for yo-
"who is this?" the voice went hard. It was what Peter called his I'm Here To Eradicate H.Y.D.R.A voice
"Well, kind of? " Peter looked back at the man who was still under his comrade, "He works for AIM sometimes, mostly he's freelance though" he stops himself before he gives his father an aneurism.
"yes, let's have a talk later, a loooong talk well invite the principal and some lawyers too, nice small party." Mr. Tritter gulped and looked about ready to pass out.
©©©©©©©©©©©©©©©
Ok, that's what backup is for
Tony sighed. "Is that why you told us not to intervine?"
It wasn’t Peter's fault ok? It really wasnt.
"Do you know how many employees work at SI? the avengers don't have time to get to know every scientist,  let alone intern, how are you planning on using them to expose my so called lie anyway?"
: you pay attention to one class and you miss all the announcements smh.
No one is to say anything about spiderman. No matter how alike Peter and Tony could be, there is no way that he'd be able to pull off a "I Am Spiderman"™ his dad said he could if he wanted to, but ultimately, it was up to him. And him being him, telling anyone that he is Spiderman is a big No No.
(bold is Peter and underline is Ned)
"Not that, what did you pay her to pretend to know you?" he insisted.
Maybe Clint will be their always
(Ned was at the tower the day before Peter left for Wakanda.
It frightened him really.
"Oh! Are we talking about his ridiculous crush on dad?" it was kinda impossible for Steve not to choke.
"Come along now. I zhink i just saw ze lab director. " Francine calls Cindy. She follows her all the while gawking at the equipment.
"Steve is like the sun" the sentence was said wistfully between the repeated and for some odd reason soothing clangs of the lab. Peter sighed and prayed for strength.
"You....lost... The page?" Steve did not know how to feel, there is literally only Tony's pictures in the sketchbook.
: who murked her?
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, uh- yeah they're- our class,  Oh! that's Betty and that's Cindy. " he pointed out the both of them.
He was an exact replica of the demon after he came out of the machine, again , bar the smile.
"When you say accepted... You mean?"
Howard nearly had a heart attack when he saw Steve Rogers. The man was....... A runt compared to the demon he saw but it was the same eyes, the same hair. The smile had changed though, it was more self deprecating, more human than angelic.
"Hello there kiddies, hope you're all having a good time here." he sounded so fake that Peter wondered if the rest of the class could see through the facade, by the cheering that occurred right after his words, they didn't catch on.
"We were. She's the one who got me all that Captain America memorabilia, also the one who told me Steve is bi. " he says.
"What, how?"
He will not kill them.
"Wow, wait, so you got adopted by the Rogers-Starks? " Cindy exclaimed, pointing at Peter.
"Hey Dr. Technus, you were looking for...... Uh, hey Cindy what were you doing here?"
If Peter didn’t have sensitive hearing, he might not have picked up on his fathers approaching them. But he does have super hearing so he did hear his fathers approach him.
"Macbeth?"
He supposes he wouldn't know, all the physical exercise he got in the building is walking in the gyms with Peter when the other boy had training.
Flash's father's eyes widen realising he has been beaten he doesnt put up much of a fight. Peter sighs.
"What's up with you space cadet, it's not normal for us to sneak up on you " MJ comments she doesn't look up from her sketch pad, but it's a near thing, which means she's actually worried.
"And I was just telling him that obviously I am the superior one." Sam pointedly told him. Peter sighed,
"It is currently 10:30 am sir, I would suggest getting your breakfast from the kitchen quickly the princess is scheduled to arrive in about half an hour" Peter perked up.
“Laugh all you want now, but you have to replace anything you break so hope you got the money for it.” Mr Jean-Jaques ( For fucks sake own up to it. {Fine!}) Mr. JJ warns which shuts them right up.
What Peter didn't notice was Shuri quickly telling Friday to sent the security footage with the audio to every avenger in the building. If that woman thinks tgat she can  mess with Peter,  well... she's not a Princess for nothing.
You're right he would never, have to be that desperate. And watch how you talk to my broken white boy
: they're pretty low-key about it so tabloids don't pick them up normally.
"well, then let's just make this a special trip then." Scott waved him off and turned to the Class,
Peter supposed he was the leader. He was the one wearing the black mask  Peter desided to call him Mr  yelli in his head since he sure could yell.
The Class was abuzz after the sparring they never thought they'd ever get to see Captain America and the Winter solder sparring.
Is it that obvious? " he decided to ask meekly.
"Oh right, um... that's aunt Natasha, she's a shield agent, and a specialist in all things murder." the woman mentioned half smiled and waved. Peggy liked her.
: lol no.
Then he caught it, she called him Petra. Tony's blood began to boil. Who the fuck does she think she is? it took the kid months to build up the courage to come out to the team. they had to continually remind him not to look down on himself just because he was born the wrong gender.
Tony scoffed, then scoffed again, and scrunched up his face like he sucked on a particularly thick lemon.
Peter grit his teeth. "I said leave my stall. Any moment my dad's gonna be here, and trust me, you can't handle a lawsuit from him" he'll probably have to move Flash to a secure location.  Maybe get him an emancipation?
Two more charged him and he ducked. They weren’t  trained very well considering they were all pretty raged and went with the predictable right hook first.
: they gave each other the exact same bitchface lmao.
: wut
So my intern just forced me to go through the # brokenstony. So.... @ ActuallyIrish wanna say something?
He debates the pros and cons of making some self deprecating comments in his hearing range.
: so, yesterday she told him to "cut the act" or whatever and "stop forging paperwork"
"Why not?" Wade pouts.
"THE LIGHTSABERS?!?!" Ned squealed from next to him.
: where's he from?
হহহহহহহহহহ হহহহহহহহহহ হহহহহহহহহহ
I'll be hear for a month, so definitely working on R2d2 at some point also *eyes emoji* "Pining idiots are hard to handle" as though you weren't one.
He wanted the man to anguish in the realization that the son he so easily gave up before the boy was even born, that boy filled his roles better than he ever did.
TFW when your teammate does something extremely soothing for the nerves.
: Ned!
Holy fucking shit
Peter grabbed Wade, waved goodbye to Ned and MJ, and left after his fathers.
Well... It only seemed that way.
"Around five minutes sir."
: wait Penis Parker's gay?
Tony: Imma get him one anyway
: yeah Sally?
"What did you see in book?" Peter asks, knowing fully well that this is what Nat Sam and Bucky were hearing from Steve's perspective.
Oh shut up @ Akemi, not everyone is gay, and It's frankly disgusting to project your thoughts onto someone else
Their badges didn’t say much it was white and had the number one on it. Which was probably why Betty had no idea that it was them coming to the tour.
"I'm almost done. Just need to figure out how to end the presentation. "
When she looked up there was a hushed conversation coming from the hallway.
"I wasn't planning a q&a but sure, go on I guess"
"Yes?" they both answer
"That's ok FRIDAY, don't really need anything specific. " Peter answered.
"For heavens sake!"
"Don't worry about it, just don't be a jerk from now on and its water under the bridge" he smiled.
He wanted to see the light leave Howard's eyes when he realised the man he trusted, the man he spend so long torturing his precious Star for was a demon.
Dude, just..... Watch it. Now.
The remaining team members thanked Bruce before going back to the movie, now able to focus on the plot.
"Tony he doesn't care as a friend, romantically I really doubt he's interested in me. Come on, after the crap that happenned at sakaar and not to mention how Hulk was mad at lightning for hitting him once, so he took it out on Thor. Why in his right mind would Thor go for me?"
: so… Wade is in fact not fake.
: ooh lovesick ?
Mr. Stewart stared at the phone as though it was about to come to life and bite him. Peter wouldn't put it past Karen if he did something to really piss her off
So where was he? Oh right! Anyway he refers to Tyler by his name and the others by dickbag no. Cause Tyler is the lead dick. The
"And you, kid," he turned to address Flash, "Peter is no longer counted as an intern because he is the heir of this company, and I hope you weren't planning on working here, because that won't happen."
They reached the gym and Peter could hear people inside. He frowned, this gym is strictly for avengers or higher level S.H.I.E.L.D personel. But no one actually practices here because they prefer sparring. And this one is not meant for that. He owns the doors, and...... Wow, Peter has never been more unimpressed while seeing the avengers workout before.
"I don't have my phone on me. I left it at home so...... I could just go home and then tell them what happened. " he didn’t really think the winning smile he gave her would actually help him in matters.
"Yeah, sure Fri, Pops, Wade, I'll meet with you guys later?"
"Who happens to be a genius " Rhody
"I have my ways." he shruggs.
Mr. Stewart reared back,
W h y are you so obsessed with his genitalia?  It's annoying Flash
:this mission actually sucks. I'm gonna head straight to the tower the moment i get back in NY to see your beautiful face.
: sorry
"Good job spiderling, I shall do yours as soon as it dries." Peter beams.
The woman grimaced,
I can't believe this is how You're telling everyone you're getting adopted.
Flash turned slightly red at the comment and relented for a while since the teacher came in but the whispered comments and spitballs still continued.
"Like hell it is, you're already spreading yourself thin enough you don't need a bully added to the mix." Tony ground out.
Today I was told that "its not natural for two guys to be together "  let me tell you just because I'm from the forties,  does not mean I've never seen two men together or that it makes it wrong -see more
©©©©©©©©©©©
So yeah, no way in hell they got in on their own.
"You're sure this will work though, because the people are actually waiting for the king and his consort. "
"So, you think he has a mystery crush?" Peter asks watching his father scoop up more icecream into his bowl.
"I went to his room and he was drawing something and immediately shut the book." Tony finally settled in the blanket fort on his couch eating a spoonful of chocolate mint.
"Dad, and Steve -wow I can call you pops now - ahem- dad and pops, you two are formidable warriors, two of the earth's mightiest heroes. people villains, supervillains have second thoughts about fighting.
"Peter, I am, -and I can't stress this enough,- a billionaire. You don't need free food! I could have gotten  you whatever you wanted! "
Ps. Brother is insisting he's not anxious to see Sam SMH.
"uh, yeah? he's my best friend, he tells me about these stuff?"
"Thank you ma'am. I'm glad to be able to help." he decides on saying.
"Riiiiiiight. Well, say something inspirational for my class and we'll be leaving you to your training."
He moved away and commanded, "medic on field" and watched with the judges as Mary came to life with a mechanical whirl.
"Uh huh, can I kiss you? I really wanna kiss you "
"No wonder they didnt show up. Probably didn’t have the courage to show face in a crowd huh. Tell you what son, leave their house, come live in mine, I'll probably throw my son out since he's like them too you could live with real a real man and my family-"
: you know what penis.
"Alright follow me." she takes them to the receptionist area where five people were answering calls left and right and two of them were typing something on their computers. "

Peter for his part just sighed, Flash has always been an idiot, but his sense of survival is dwindling by the minute.
Ned grimaced in sympathy for his friend and walked out of the school messaging about Legos and Star wars and everything else they didn't have time to nerd out about, He'll probably go to the tower later but hey, school time is prime talking with best friend time.
She gets to make a sales pitch about

" 'S not that funny" he grumbled. And he Did. Not. Pout. He does not pout.
"Is he who I think he is?" Steve hears as they break him out.
Peter smiles. They are adorable when they’re getting along. He hears a slight squeal a little of to the side.
"What are you guys doing here?" Peter decided to ask.
"And what do we have here?" an old man whit long white  beard asked genially. He had a badge that declared him as a judge. His companions had one of those too, one of the man had a shrewd look to him, dressed in all black. The other looked happy to be there, excited even. The last man had red hair and an encouraging smile that pulled Peter out of his usual mindset of stranger-anxiety-foot meet mouth
Behind her however another girl walked in. She, like Pepper, had coffee and her phone and she also had sunglasses looking cooler then normal. Ned smirked. MJ looked like the walking personification of the five minutes late with Starbucks Meme.
"No, being team mom makes you mom.... What am I doing with my life? Why am I convincing my father that he's a mom?"
" Captain,  It would appear that Boss is in trouble"   Steve frowns and looks up,
"Yeah way! And he might even know the tour guide!" Tyler crows.
Peter discarded that idea as soon at it popped in his head. His fathers were the two most headstrong people in the planet. It sometimes felt like a wonder that they even are together. They don't know when to quit, so obviously that's not what happened.
When Peter reached the front desk, Alice looked positively  beat. And it was only ten.
"I think your streak is waaay more important, don't you think guys?" Peter's eyes were wide and signalling them to agree.
@ IAmFe Peter told me to tell you no. But yes.
There is something extremely chilling about hearing Iron man talk to you coldly when you are committing a crime. It's also chilling when someone threatens his family. So Peter was safe to assume Harrison Thompson was the camel to his father's arctic right about now.
: I mean I know you both. But like who is Peter's mystery mans?
Maddie shook herself out of her stupor
"Take another guess"
"Cap I can close the portal now."
The lady she met, she thinks her name is Francine, told them to reach the tower at 4. The tower wasn’t too far away from the school.
______
I feel....... validated
"Ok, uncle Clint" Peter mutters softly.
"Oh Peter." Steve sighed and pulled Peter in a hug. "Hey, its OK, I'll get Tony to personally get you out of detention, If he can't, I'll break you out my self OK?" Steve promised, and Peter couldn't stop a giggle
She quickly steals a glance at Steve to make sure that was ok, he was smiling besottedly at Tony,  huh, Steve and Tony. She smirked, they're a nice match.
Lure you @ toYourDemise
So Peter took the card and placed it on his table and things kept piling on it and after a day, he had no idea where the card was. He saw it when he was moving his things from the apartment, and he knows he has it somewhere in his room, but.... Yeah,  He has no idea where his access card is.
When he sat on one of the front seats, his phone buzzed
Loud cackling filled the air.
"Yes, I've been to a few with Pepper, amazing networking platform." Peter blinked at her and then decided he's not stupid enough to risk his life by arguing with MJ of all people. (even if he thought the networking wasn't worth being so stuffy for hours)
@ widow  :p
"He's alive!"
4. Letting his father sign said permission slip.
"Yeah?"
: I don't.
"Alois I swear to fuck, one more stunt like that and you're going to the mail room." she kept pointing and saying as she walked in.
Peter was glad for his super hearing, because without that he wouldn't hear Steve growl softly. His pops gets /really/ possessive over his dad. Tony frowned slightly like he didn't want to answer, but nodded to Flash anyway.
“ALRIGHT BUCKLE UP WE'RE HERE-” …..why teach? “- I expect each and every one of you little shits to be on best behaviour, no yelling, no shoving, and no destruction of property.”
"Who's fault do you think that is?" was mumbled and was promptly ignored
The officer he was leaving the statement to finished up writing and smiled at him gratefully,
: I call bullshit.
Clint, Natasha, Wanda, Vision and Rhody all were gone in the light leaving no traces.
"Yes sir. "
: Ryner told is to stay together.
"Do I have to?" his voice sounded surprisingly like a whine even in his own ears.
"Are you nuts??? My boyfriend walks around with a katana dad!! And you know when it comes to me, his moral compass is a roulette wheel."
NVM just saw the tweet he was looking at I'll leave him to rot like the oblivious dumbass he is.
There is nothing to speculate, We've been banging for the better part of the month and It's amazing.
®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®
Tony stared at him for a long moment before  breaking into peals of laughter.
: yes.
"Nope!"
The avengers nod and agree, and if Peter gets more doted on for the next few days It's no one's bussiness but theirs.
Tony was confused. What happened at the field trip that Shuri would call them all to meet, even though Peter told them not to. They were usually thick as thieves,  they don't go against the other.
The avengers that are present didn't make much fanfare of it after that. As soon as Wade came back the class was excused to be bearded towards the food court. The glasses and year plugs did marvels for his headache. He kissed Wades mask covered cheeks. And if he heard one of his classmates mumble "holy shit he looks hot in glasses" just before he plugged his ears, well... He chose to graciously ignore that comment.
Peter withered down looking at the floor, something he does when he is confronted about putting himself in danger for the sake of others, or just suffering in silence for some atrocious reason
"I'm afraid so young sir."
Peter had to physically restrain the guy from attacking a kid with a bisexual flag cape in the pride parade last year. Not to mention the time Peter had to take an innocent civilian to hospital because he couldn’t control his gun. Peter heard much later that, he wasn’t on duty, and he was drunk when he shot the other guy.
Which was true considering most of their attaire consisted of sweatpants, jeans, t-shirts and other assorted comfy clothes.
Peter could not believe his ears, Wade in the same school as him? He would have to thank his pops and Agent Hill so much after this!
Tony cocks his head,
"Hey Wade, wanna hang out in a gym with the others after?" he asks.
He doesn't mean to push his friends away, but he should be able to do this himself. He's Spiderman for crying out loud. he should be able to handle one transphobe of a teacher. He lifted an entire building, why is this harder?
Maria screamed and cried and damn near died the day Anthony Edward Stark was born.
"Tony!" he nearly panicked.
Oh that's great. Yes definitely go to that flash.
He couldn't give the man more than being paralysed.
"Sure, 5 work for you?"
And when the bus stopped, and she took in her surroundings, she immediately didn't.
"yeah I'm fine, just got a detention. " Happy made a noncommittal noise of acknowledgement and began driving. the rest of the drive was in silence.
"Hey Mr. Odinson-Banner " he mutters.
: just let it happen.
"That's a slight to our contract isn't it? Since Tony is mine, you had no right to hurt him as you did now did you. No one else has a right to anything to do with my star. And It's such a shame that you're the one who violated the deal, considering you're the one who made the deal. "
Ned makes eye contact with MJ. The girl's face containing a profound displeasure at yet again being told that they'll like the destination, Ned understood the sentiment.
"Alright first things first, you all need to stand in a line in front of the ID detector " she pointed at the Machine.
Peggy's next bout of teasing was cut off by a bright light that whisked those from the future back to their time.
"But he can bully Peter? How does that make sense?" Steve positively glowered at the teacher.
: I'm gonna go blind from how bright he's smiling.
Betty was hyperfocusing on her sales pitches and had not looked up from her laptop for the last two hours.
Hunkey @sunshineBoi
Steve said nothing, steeling himself up.
"You have so many connections!” and has Jessie’s voice alway has been this shrill or did she like, get the memo that Wade’s head hurts today?
:bro chill. We just got off the bus.
Rumours have been surrounding the two heroes for nearly a year for their close relationship.
"Which is good because you look beat. Is Wade allowed to visit again? or did he break something... again?"
Her smirk turned more malicious. Wade resisted the urge to smirk right back at her though not that she'd see anything since he did have a mask on.
"Why is it your first conclusion that I -the brilliant mind that I am- did something wrong?" Peter looked at Steve,
"What is he even doing here?" Betty asks.
"Peter!"
(See the end of the chapter for
You two have probably reached the pinnacle of tomfoolery.
"we didn't need a scene there, and besides, his company was going to be ruined in a month, why add extra grief? " Tony says nonchalantly. Steve raises an eyebrow Peter has his mouth gaping
Peter's head snapped up, he thought he was lying?!
"So, then I told her that she can't use her fucking powers in training, and in the next round of combat she shot me, which, hurts like a bitch, but at least she didn't use her powers......" Deadpool rambled on all their way to the next destination, which Friday provided was a lower level avengers gym.
"And you're an ass. Come on Nat who else can I ask? " Steve practically whined and punched the "indestructible " punching bag.
"Well, well, well, guess the little liar's lies are coming to an end." Flash sneered.
"If it helps Mr. Rogers-Stark, Bob refused to take part in the kidnapping after he figured out they were going to kidnap Peter." Ned pointed out helpfully.
First of all, not interested in him either, my type has more boobs and vagina
"Please leave my stall." Peter says curtly.
"You know I can help you with that? If you can't put the moves on them, I'd make a great wingman~ " Tony cajoled.
Hey! He got Peter to like him back enough to date his sorry ass. If that ain't an accomplishment…
I'm not even sorry
"Peter, you're an excellent student and all that, but you can't keep lying about having an internship in such a prestigious place." he was about to say something more but was cut off by Flash.
Little known fact that She's actually talking about Pepper Potts
Sam pointed at the door she walked out of, "Her. MJ. I'm pretty sure she'll take over the world one day....... She'll probably be better than most political leaders though. " he ended thoughtfully.
"Come on Peter, where's the fun in that? Besides, inspirational is tall blond and patriotic's job." Rhody piped in.
It all starts when, He returned to his school after two days of excused day off, which is to say, he got so badly injured fighting doc oc, his fathers made up an excuse for him to stay home and got Natasha to call them and use her super spy skills to make the school believe that he had the flu for exactly two days.
Oh look vultures that want to pick on other's relationships are already here.
: STFU
"Why are you kiddies in my lab?"
"Hello children of Midtown high" Natasha welcomed, and nobody seemed to be offended, but then again it is entirely possible that they were too starstruck to actually hear what she told them.
"Hello, is this the tour group from Midtown high?"the newcomer was one of their interns (actual intern, not the web slinging kind) .
"That he is."
And there was another bang
"Listen man, I don't care that you can't die, but if Peter gets hurt under your watch, I will make you dead" MJ threatened.
There was a strangled sound from the other side. He guessed it was his dad.
When he just finished his patrol last night there was a house fire that took an hour to get in control. After that some burglars thought it would be a perfect time to rob a house. After stopping that, he saw Doctor Octavius, looking vaguely suspicious.
"Um - this gym was meant to - meant to be showed in the tour? We could come back if it bothers you all." she vocalised weakly.
Fine I'll just ask his boyfriend then.
My only question is, What did I ever do to make you think that I'm straight?  How do I stop it? I'm bi ffs
"Didn’t uncle Clint ask you what to wear to a gala last week?"
Secondly,  weren’t you supposed to be a playboy? I'm pretty sure you have lines better than that."  he types in and pushes the formula through for simulation.
Before they could rip Flash and Eleanor a new one, the doors opened, and in walked MJ and the subject of their conversation.
"Bully huh? we'll see what Peter's fathers and the rest of the family has to say about that."
One day you’ll understand you innocent child.
Turnes out it really was to knock me out since the guy fell asleep instantly but we were still going and I tried to stop the car but it hit a Fire hydrant before I got to the brakes. "
our tour guide. She's enamored with peter.
: I'm just curious about it at this point ngl.
"Steve Rogers!!! You're alive!!" he threw his hands up. he looked at Peggy,
And well, Steve wasn’t really going to say no to a little comfort right now.
I knew the dating thing was a publicity stunt.
"Special? "
Right now he got a call from Mr. Keaton. The guy gave him heebeejeebies, and not only because he kinda looks like Tooms (But that definitely plays a major role in the dislike.)
5. Not asking where the field trip was going when it was first announced and he wasn't paying attention.

The guys have kevlar and about half of them have guns. Their ski masks didn’t have any particular different between them, other than the colours. Some were dark brown, some navy blue and one black. There were twelve of them unless they have backup waiting and Peter really wishes he had any kind of weapon.
Flash.... Does not know when to shut up does he?
×××××××××××××××××××××××××✗
Which is when a red and black clad man decides to join the party.
"Why do you care so much about that loser? It's almost like you have a crush on him."
"I know!" Mami exclaimed.
"Why not?" the boy in question whined.
"What the heck Mami? I have a tour group waiting  right there, why couldn’t this wait?"
: yeah what MJ said.
"I really did not wish to make you uncomfortable Bruce, I value our friendship, and I never intended on you finding out" Thor tried to salvage the situation
"Well considering that I know everyone of you used that excuse at some point, let's go home before we tell him how dumb it was of him to get in a strange van when someone offers him food" Rhodey inputs after pointing Bucky to thank the Officer Peter was talking to.
After sending them away, Peter pointedly ignored the stares his peers kept giving him. Even though a yelling Flash is hard to ignore.
{Uh… no? Of course not. Obviously.   <(￣︶￣)>.   }  )
"Because that's what you get for betraying me and not coming to the trip to suffer. " Cindy informed her gleefully.
"PENIS PARKER IS FRIENDS WITH THE PRINCESS OF WAKANDA?!" Flash yells out. Peter sighs then suddenly a knife, an arrow and a bullet graze past Flash making the boy jump and shiver.
Cindy’s eyes widen and she makes sure her goggles are on right.
Still he would pick chemistry or nanotechnology over biology any day.
When they let go, Tony yelped and clutched his bicep Steve turned to see Natasha punching the genius.
"So how did you manage that Penis?" Peter sighed, It's not that he couldn't totally break out of Flash's grip on his shoulder, but it just raises more questions.
Alfred asked if he was Ok when he got back. He waved the other boy off too. Though he was sure Ned told him about what Ms. Terry said if the dark looks he keeps giving her is any indication.
"I think you're all going to love where we're going to go." She said with a barely there sneer directed at Peter.
"No! Nope, nada, not happening,  Steve does not have a crush on me."
:  do you have ANY idea how stupid he was.
"And you, " he says and grabs Peter by the scruff of his neck,  "You're coming with me "
What could they possibly do now?
But anyway the field trip. It's gonna be either a mess or great.
"And..... The intern is a.... Strict person?" she asks cautiously.  She probably would be on her toes too if she knew what was going on.
"The reason would be I want it."
The two of them took a minute to just,, take it in.  They're going to work here! They're going to work here,  in this huge architectural marvel with some of the greatest minds in the planet.
"Alright, I'm sorry Peter,  but I'm gonna pair Tony with Wade for after the brake." Steve announced at the training room. Tony cheered and Wade whimpered.
Peter heard Steve growl "Rogers-Stark" softly.
Today this fckn Dudebro had the actual Gall to tell me that the Avengers should be against same sex marriage. He said that to my face. Like some of us fight crime in spandex you think we're what? Straight?
He was having a nice almost peaceful day... up until the announcement came that is,
"What are you doing here Parker!." Flash spat.
"Sorry Eleanor,  I'm busy. I have plans with...." Peter was backing up. Eleanor cut him off.
The door breaks off it's hinges and the barrels of guns comes in the room before the men do. Peter could have probably beaten them but he doesn’t want to risk one of the students or Ms. Lanister to get shot at.
"Mr. Barnes!" Ned whined.
"There's a student in our school, he's a computer expert here? I think? And he probably wanted the fact that he works here to be a secret, and told in the school that his best friend has an internship here. Maybe you should have someone sort it out?"
"I did? What? "
she paused to take a breath eyes roaming over the students.  Not the least bit perturbed that they were only half listening to her and half gawking at the tower.
From his position on the back stage he couldn't see how many people there was but he could hear them filling in, Peter tuned out the sounds coming from the front of the stage in favour of his phone.
"Yeah it does."
"Drop the Mr. kid and cut the call, he's sleazy and I'm pretty sure he was thinking about getting in your pants." Tony says. Peter sends a disgusted look towards his phone before cutting the call and then throwing it a bit on the couch.
: Stark industries!!!!!!
He looked behind the officer to see that his pops had one hand over his dad's shoulder and boy did they look mad.
"I was agreeing to never bother Peter ever again."

Steve wished he could kill Obadiah Stane himself. He would have fun with him in hell.

I'm Peter's boyfriend
Betty ran towards Cindy and nearly knocked into the girl, pulled her a few feet away from the crowd to make sure they weren’t overheard.
"You know loser , I may hate Thompson, but thanks for reminding me that I'm capable of pity." MJ says and before Peter could ask what MJ meant, Flash walked in right before the teacher.
: here we go again.
Better ❤
"Whatcha got there soldier? " He asks, because it would be a cold day in hell when he can leave well enough alone.
"I really really can't " he muttred but was unheard.
"Wait? Wait? Wade no, what are you gonna wait for? There’s nothing to wait for! Wade?" Betty calls but the mercenary ignores her and walks away,
"It is at floor 46 mini boss, it's usually used by employees. "
But Wade made him pancakes. And he drowned them in syrup so there's that.
Peter looked towards Ned, who looked like he was barely holding on his tirade about going on an adventure. His best friend looked too excited about the trip for him to tell him he had a bad feeling about this.
He's strong. Or at least the Hulk is. The two of them are a mesmerizing process of hiding raw power in such a delicate looking person and it leaves Thor breathless sometimes.
"PETYPIE!!!!" Was Peter's only warning barring his spider sense before he was tackled by a very enthusiastic Deadpool.
Well purchased is probably  the wrong word when the man who owns the company is his his father and gave him a new phone  because his last one was a 'blasphemy in the house of technological marvels  '
That one multibillion dollar company that he was being trained to be the CEO of. His eye twitched when he thought how he didn't know this crap was happening.
: whatever.

"Woah, there dude, chill, Peter doesn't use the front door because there's usually  paparazzi waiting outside, there isn't much of them today, but I think there's still one or two of them out there.
Peter wakes gradually, he hasn't woken up so calmly in a while, mostly because school starts early and he barely gets rest, when he does wake up, he's glad his fathers made him take a rest day. He hadn't felt that refreshed in days, heck weeks, and he sits up, rubbing his eyes asking Friday about the time.

"the fuck did you just call him you dipwad?" Natasha says slowly and threateningly.
Bucky stared at Steve intently.
Betty winced. Cindy rubbed her face then looked at the angry couple. Dam, no wonder supervillains are scared of them. If looks could kill Flash would be dead, then zombified then re killed and then re zombified to be killed again.
Whoops. Well, at least the golden boy of America tried his hardest. There was no way for him to stop that after all.
His pops was too busy being a disappointed husband to actually admonish Tony about his language.
But his head was slightly unclear from thinking about May and he doesn't show it but he is slightly pissed. And Mr. Stewart had his hand out expectantly for his phone so Peter went up to the front of the club and handed him the phone. If that's how his teacher wanted to play it then so be it.
Iron Man and Captain America continues to flirt unknowingly much to everyone's pain.
But none of that trumped the last two men. Two men that she thought to be dead. Sgt. Barnes and Steve Rogers looked at her wide eyed mirroring her shock.
"It was kinda awesome" was said unhelpfully by Peter
MJ looked shocked for a second then caught herself and gave a half smile,
"Uh... hey Mr. Lang." Ned greeted unsurely.
"Ok, so maybe I am that bad" Tony conceded, because, really, why would Pepper be wrong? ever? Peter went back to listening to her lecture)

He saw one of the people who touched his star while battling Loki. He angled his shield to hit the Chitauri a second to slow.
"Stay there,  I'll be back in a minute!" she yells behind her.
"I know."
Steve cursed and told the AI to call everyone.
"Nope!"
"That's good for you Eugene. "
This happened in the R&D lab
"And! He can't even tell me who it is! Why can't he tell me who he is? this is ridiculous "
Cinfy snorted.
Peter ignored them. He didn't think even his teachers would notice but apparently they did and didn't choose to comment....... Until......
The group looks towards Howard who looked taken aback by the darkening in their faces.

"How do you know Leeds?" Flash sneers.
Oh, look another day another PR mess.

"Oh it's fine Rogers, actually I'd like to join this talk. " Shuri says eyeing Peter.
They froze when they saw the large group and the one on the others back looked towards Tony,
Peter grabbed his mouth so that he wouldn’t laugh out loud.
The man's eyes widen in his paralysis when he sees Steve.
"Your kid? Peter is an orphan." Flash asked. Peter wished he had some tape to put on his mouth. Why cant he just realise that he is currently in mortal peril from the earth's greatest heroes?

"Thanks Uncle Loki!"
"HEY PENIS DON'T YOU WANT TO EVEN MEET THE NEW KID?" Flash yelled across the hall. Peter winced and hoped the new kid -whoever they may be- didn't become Flash's new punching bag.
"Alright, I think we need to have a talk."
"Wade is my boyfriend. " Peter explains. Getting more comfortable on Wade's lap.
"Peter's supposed to be here with snack. I'm waiting" he said as he took a seat next to Steve on the couch.
He was of course fine in day one but he was not allowed to go to school or patrol for at least two days to make sure he " didn't keep giving his old men repeated heart attacks, do you hear me young man?" He struck a hard bargain with Tony to let Deadpool in the tower. And due to him being "injured" even got both Tony and Wade to play nice.
"YEAH, I JUST WANT TO CUDDLE WITH BABY BOY WHY IS THAT SO BAD?" Wade yelled out from where he was dodging repulsor blasts.
"I didn’t!....  At first. Then he said he would buy me a snack if I showed him the way! "
He walked to go out again.
Bruce rolled gis eyes, " We are friends, I may or may not like him, it does not mean he likes me back, I'm not gonna ruin our friendship for that."
"Not at all, let the kids have some fun and meet the Avengers! " he says as he waved the starstruck class in.
Tony sighed.
"Bu- but that's MJ!" he groused. Looking sullen.
She frowned, "You just finished the call though, how are they already here?"
I love how they always just know what the other is doing, how much time do they spend together?
So much so that he didn't notice MJ opening the locker next to his. If one didn't know MJ well they would say the girl was not listening but Peter knew she was paying attention too.
Con: Peter feels bad that he even feels that way
"Right, then we need to have a talk about getting into suspicious looking vans with suspicious people having no regards to safety" his pops cut in.
Cindy stared at Betty's face to see it go to heart eyes in a second...... It was. ..  Kinda embarrassing actually.
"Mr. Stewart I'm not- I'm not lying! Why would I lie about -" Peter was yet again stopped from finishing his sentence
"uh, yes you are."
Anything?
Second of all..... Yeah sounds about right.
Cindy pouted, because she is an employee dam it! Did she mention there is no need for her to take this tour? Because there is no need for her to take this tour.
"I find his company enjoyable " Thor follows the captain's example it was a good fight
(Picture of Peter in with the avengers all in civilian clothes having dinner Peter sitting between Tony and Wade while flicking peas at a unaware clint. Natasha looks on amused)
"So, Pete,  anything interesting happen today?" Tony asked him when they were working on the suit that day.
"He's going to be ok. He's a tough guy you know." his voice was even and steady. Peter wasn’t really sure if he was trying to convince Peter or himself that Tony is going to be ok, but his words rang true.
"Wellllll....... Pepper may or may not have cleared the entire thing with the PR and the board of directors, and Fury finally gave the go ahead for Steve and me coming out to the public  I have a press conference the day after the fair." he says cautiously  looking for Peter's reaction.
"Alright-"
"Listen kid I don't know who you think your parents are, but I am a police officer. You can't do shit about me kicking the stupid fairy out" Mr. Thompson growled into his face.
"Uh, yes??"
"What?! How? And why him?" Flash yelped out.
"Oh, are you gonna stop me?"
Why tf wasn’t I alerted, Karen was supposed to let me know?????
"He's saying the  MCU one sucks the most and he loved AA better.  " Peter shrugged.
"After all we've been through and I've gone through all the trouble of getting the legal document of making you my heir, you'd think he would introduce himself as more than my intern." a new voice calls out, the owner of the voice walking on the podium.
"Po-teh-to , po-tah-to." The billionear waved it off.
Everyone who was sitting at the table looked at Tony with varying levels of disbelief.
"She's kidding. But nothing against you, Peter has a boyfriend,  and they're really happy." Ned says
Eleanor.  Hide yo boy he's too precious.
×××××××××××××
"Back off Flash." he was about to shake the bully off when flash punched him in the stomach.
"Long story short, now I can't go to the field trip, and may also have detention for something I didn't even do!".
"Mr. Stark?" Vision prompted sounding polite yet with a hidden hardness to his voice.
"I am a hypocrite I thought you people would know this by now."
"Oh you humans! So easy. You don't even know what you lost. You don't even
Wow look at that who's chopping all those onions!
Peter was expecting him to be a disappointment,  Mr. Thompson was worse,
"Pick up the goggles and aprons, I meant it when I said safety first.  " he brought out a box containing a lot of safety goggles and aprons. Cindy took a pair and put them on quickly.
হহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহ
Bruce was treated to one of the rare Tony Stark real smile that was saved for people he really cared about.
"Who was that?" Flash demanded.
"It is not just about the clothes,  you have purchased a new phone of the latest model haven't you?"
: I'm drooling at the equipment.
"Tell me who the Stark Tower kid is, and I won't blow his brain off." Yelli snarls.
He has been pretty light since the spider bite. Tony once said he didn't weight more than a back pack. That worked well in his case because Peter was currently hugging a mercenary from the behind hanging quite like a backpack would.
"NO SIR! Uh- absolutely not" if nothing else, Flash looked hilarious stumbling over his words like a headless chicken.
"Who the fuck are they?" Tony pointed at the goons and Peter considers,
: Yeet. Dr. Banner saw the message.
"Mr. Wilson, pay attention if you don't want to fail. Circuits are hard enough when you do pay attention" Mr. Jean-Jaques  huffs at him like he's not learning the entire syllabus from his boyfriend anyway. Study dates are fun.
"No" Wade looked like a kicked puppy
ভভভভভভভভভভভভভভভ
"His phone signal abruptly stopped half an hour ago. Boss has put in a thirty minute delay to alert anyone of him being away from his phone in case of displacing it. Its last known location is in an alley next to a bakery. Scans show no sign of boss near.
: anyway here's to hoping we get a quiet lunch brake.
"Oh right, so this dude had a map and everything and he sounded foreign.  He said he was a tourist. And he wanted to go somewhere and got lost and I showed him the way. I even pointed it out in the map but he still didn't get it so he told me to just show him from the car-"
He twists the hand to hold it against the guys back and used his other hand to grab him in a chokehold till he passed out then he immediately let him go and dropped him to the floor.
ভভভভভভভভভভভভভভভভভভভভভভ
Tony stepped up to give them a fake paparazzi smile.

As she opened the door though, she, along with the rest of the group was gaping at the sight presented to them,
"It's Flash Peter. Do you want them to lie?" MJ says helpfully.
Hey @ intern a la Stark are you ever gonna fo a face reveal?
Peter isnt that ripped?
And....... Surprisingly Peter Parker.  Huh, she didn’t expect him to be able to stand after the marathon. Peter raises his shirt to wipe his face and........
: oh boy.
"Put us in hologram please, and show us an image feed too."
"This is the last room in the tour, the people in here are all working on transferring  the reactor tech to everyday lives, from generators to batteries, anything you can think of that could need a power source, the reactor is being tweaked, updated and whatever that needs to be done to make it work. " Betty announces cheerfully.
"Aren’t you supposed to be a tactical genius? " Peter asks
"Hi Ned, how are you doing, what's going on in your life?" Peter remarked.
MmmmmmwacchaJ
So while his classmates cheered and talked excitedly,  Peter folded his hand on his desk, puts his  face on his hands, and groaned.
Nooooooo. @ intern a la Stark is this true?
What is the banging noise coming from Barnes's room?
:and he's so cute about stuff too! He's like… a head taller than me and really muscular but he wears hello kitty pajamas regularly. He even lets me borrow them some times.
Ned craned his neck to see that they were running from Bucky covered in pink slime coming after them so maybe they were running for their lives.
After a while, when Tony was standing on his own, he asked for a little while.
Peter's class mates watched the exchange with wide eyes. It was a bit hard to believe the power couple of all power couples fought so vehemently.... Unless you lived with them, then you'd know that they fought for every tiny single little thing, most of the time just for the sake of fighting.
"Michelle? " she calls out.
He got up and approached Peter from behind, taking off his mask.
Happy insisted on the widows being tinted!! Besides that car was probably the least showy car in their garage!!!
They entered just in time to see the Avengers and one Deadpool laughing at something Peter said, Sam was pouting though and glaring at Clint while rubbing at his arm where a rubber tip of an arrow hit him.
"Peter how about this? You call your 'father' and put him on loud speaker and if he can confirm that my concerns are unfounded then he can say it himself can't he?"
OK, so maybe he's a bit more salty than he lets on, but come on, he could program these in his sleep!
"Hello, there!  my name is Alfred   Jones, and I'll be leading your tour today!"
: wtaf
The man said something and Flash's face fell. And he left to talk to one of his friends.
"Have you considered that he's four and you're a terrible father?" Peter asked looking a little red in the face.
(Yes he knows they have a crush on each other. No they don't know about the other one's crush. No he is not allowed to tell ether of them if he wants to live. And yes it is absolutely frustrating when they have a supernatural marathon and both of them complain about Cas and Dean.)
Peter, Ned and MJ's face lit up in a smile and Mr. Tritter glared at the girl.
Ned poked him, "Is that Shuri? should we go say hi? are we allowed to talk to her in public?  cause like she's a princess, and then you know her because your other job, but we're good friends too, but would talking to her could blow your cover, but like could it really blow your cover?........"
Flash stared at him dumbstruck Peter smiled, maybe the boy just needed to be away from his father's cluches to be a better guy.
Hey, @ Stark Industries  I know a guy who has been pretending to be you for a year.
"Well, Peter was not allowed to come to the trip so as the person with authority here, I say that he can't go in." Mr. Tritter says with a air of finality. Peter rolled his eyes.
"Wait Peggy do you know who he is?"  Howard asks.
When Mr. Warren was finally done with the headcount he lead the group towards the reception area a young neat blonde woman was sitting at the desk, typing away at her computer, Peter recognizes her as Emily .
Wait what? That was Peter Parker-Rogers-Stark?
Steve began to go on offence first trying to do some tricks Bucky has been trying to teach him. While they both were serum induced supersoldiers, Steve was more reliant on strength while Bucky was more focused about the techniques.
