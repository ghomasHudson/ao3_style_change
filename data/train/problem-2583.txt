Sherlock cups the right side of his face and bends forward to press his lips to John’s for a long moment, as though he’s already forgotten what John’s mouth feels like. After, his eyes open, and he looks almost heartbreakingly transparent. “I can hardly believe this is happening,” he says, and John wants to kiss the uncertainty away forever.
He can almost hear Sherlock’s wry amusement.
Sherlock agrees. “In five, then,” he says, and goes.
“So, neither of you knew anything about this whatsoever?” John cuts in, though not impatiently. “You’re not under suspicion. I’m just asking.”
Sherlock can hear the unsaid words plainly:
wear them more often.”
find our way. We’ve waited far too long not to.”
“Of course!” Mrs Hudson is reproving. “I wouldn’t miss
“I want to make it up to you on the other side, then,” John insists. He takes the lapels of Sherlock’s coat and kisses him one more time. “Besides,” he murmurs. “I’m beginning to be in something of an indecent state. Not that I care about that particularly, but…”
Sherlock shrugs, looking a bit self-conscious. “This. Not having anything on. Having time to cook like this. Nothing on the schedule for tomorrow. The… free time. It’s odd.”
This is the most emotional thing Sherlock has said to her since he was seven years old, since before Redbeard and Eurus and Victor Trevor, and Vee’s heart is suddenly in her throat. She swallows. “Then I’m glad for you,” she says, willing her voice to come out steadily. “I only hope he’s half good enough for you, after everything you’ve done for him.”
There’s another skate of his light blue eyes, almost challenging, and Sherlock feels discomfited by it. He brushes past Paul and gets out of the corridor, feeling the other’s eyes on his back as he goes. Awkward or not, he suddenly very much wants to be wherever John is, behind closed doors.
Greg                      "What are you thinking about? I know your mind isn't here." I say softly after I watched him for a minute and put my hand to his back where we had to weave through a group of people.
Greg                      "Doesn't exactly seem the right time to tell him how I feel or… to date really, I mean, has Sherlock said anything about Mycroft talking to him about me?" I asked and didn't realise Mycroft had come back to the bathroom and was listening in the hall.
Mycroft                 "I think you need to answer Greg's question first, Sherlock." I scowled at him from the bed.
John    “I’m here for a medical conference... I didn’t say I was a doctor by the way.” I had a strange sense of deja vu.
Mycroft                 Lestrade stood beside me near the back of the crowd, as we watched Sherlock looking particularly surly near the wide red ribbon near the museum doors. "I would have thought he'd be more appreciative of a museum dedicated to science," I said with a smirk. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I knew he really hated being the center of attention. The only reason he agreed to my mandate was that John insisted, and the good doctor can be very persuasive.
Let me speak to my daughter. -SH
Greg                      "I don't think he's gonna have to write one for a while sweetheart but yeah, I like like your uncle Myc.." I smiled at her lightly and took her bowl since she was pushing it away.
Stop smoking and answer me -SH
Sherlock               My attention is diverted just as Mycroft's finger twitches, huffing, "That's mine. Give it back. I was using it."
Peter Harkness    Seeing now why they sent a cop and not a military guy to be he chief of security I had to play it extra cool. “Oh wow! I bet you’ve got lots of crazy work stories then! But... why did you get this assignment then? No offense, but you’re not the typical military hired guns I see for this job.”
John                      I keep my smile, but my eyes communicate ‘you will not.’ to him.
Mycroft                 "What is it, Greg?" I looked up from watching Rosie devour her soup, as he walked into the room.
Mycroft                 "Very comfortable." A smile crept across my lips as I slowly sat up and snuggled up against him lazily. "But this is better."
Sherlock               Starting to search with my phone I roll my eyes, "Well you were so busy snogging my brother goodbye that you got here late." I can't help but give a small shudder at that thought.
Mycroft                 "No, no, I'm fine," I repeated, but I let him pull me up out of the chair, and steer me down the hallway toward my room. My arm was wrapped around his shoulders tightly. "You have nice shoulders..." I mumbled.
Greg                      "Were here because we are in the middle of a murder investigation. We understand that you used to be the head of security for the embassy." I started to explain and smiled at the waitress for bringing our coffee over.
John                      I sit up when Sherlock stirs suddenly. My hand goes to his where his arms were wrapped around Rosie.
Greg                      "Yeah, we're gonna have dinner now Rosie. Carbonara." I smiled as I picked her up and Mycroft seemed relieved to sit down, a couple pillows on one of our chairs so she could sit above the table a little to eat.
Sherlock               There's a flash of the picture on my screen for a moment, looking very much like the photo I sent Lestrade last night but with a lot less covers involved. Bringing my phone back up to my face I nod, frowning once more and starting to type on it, "You believe she may have been involved somehow? Maybe the letters to her were threats and she was murdered to pave the way for something bad to happen?"
Greg                      "Oh, I've been told multiple times, but I've coped with your brother, so I'm sure I can deal with you being a little grumpy." I grinned back at him, taking the bowls when Mycroft got up and I raised an eyebrow at him to sit down.
Greg                      I stopped his hand from stroking himself when I could feel him tightening around me. I continued thrusting into him, seeing if he could actually climax without me touching him. I held his hand to the side and dropped my head to his throat.
Mycroft                 I smiled a little when he squeezed my hand. His fingers were rough, but warm and comforting. My mind swirled with conflicting emotions.
Remember, Rosie -must- have her favourite book read before bed and you -must- do the voice and animals noises. I cannot stress this enough brother -SH
Mycroft                 I looked at Rosie in surprise. "Rosie, that's not a word you should be using, my dear."
Mycroft                 I got to my feet, and followed Greg to the living room, and sat in one of the chairs by the fireplace. He took the other chair. "So, when you said you found me 'mysterious', does that imply interest?" I said bluntly.
Greg                      I smiled at Mycroft to go shut Sherlock's laptop, my hands holding a envelope full of photographs of when I was younger along with Adrian. I showed Rosie a photo of me as a young toddler, around her age and I had deep brown hair like Sherlock's but it was just swept to one side. The big grin hadn't changed
Mycroft                 "Yes - along with the new pain medication. Took them with breakfast, as instructed." I nodded.
Wake her. I miss her. -SH
Sherlock               Frowning I reach for Rosie, "Are they essential to this tea party? I'm sure we can find other, more dignified hats?"
Greg                      "Yes we are." I nodded and Mycroft seemed to be just working something out himself.
Greg                      "I don't know. I’ve just always found you... mysterious. You didn't really let anything show and I just had the urge to learn what was under that facade." I admitted with a smile and it sounded stupider now that I'd said it out loud.
Greg                      "I don't think he's in the condition to be released today, really. It's only been a week." I folded my arms across my chest and glanced in where Mycroft was talking with Anthea
Mycroft                 I could hear voices. They sounded very far away.
John                      “Well, hopefully we can change that pain medication. These sutures look good. They’re dry and scabbed over. Just keep them that way ok?” I start cleaning up the old gauze and supplies.
Sherlock               Copying his motions, I think attempt to think back on my rather extensive research on sexual encounters, but my mind is filled with static, startling me and making me pull back with a gasp.
Sherlock               Nodding, I treat her to another wide, sunny smile, leaning back and listening
Sherlock               Pouring the water into the teapot I carry back into the living room, glaring at Mycroft, "Are you corrupting my daughter?"
Mycroft                 I take John's hand and let him pull me up, still a bit light-headed, but at least I'm not going to faint, I think.
Sherlock               Striding back into the room I'm shredding all the rather incriminating paperwork into shreds before tossing it up so it falls like confetti around us, glaring at Mycroft as if to say a word
Greg                      "So what do you do to clear your mind?" I asked as I moved my legs onto the bed and shuffled up so my head was now on the pillows beside him. I put my hand on his thigh, rubbing it gently.
Mycroft                 "Get her cleaned up and changed. Then come to the kitchen and we'll talk." I said in a kind but firm tone.
Sherlock               My face grows serious once more, "I shall be in contact with Anthea. Keep under house protection. Both of you."
John                      “Maybe when Uncle Myc is feeling better.” I say shoving her things back into her bag.
James Morgan      Thinking.... "No. Sorry. Never heard of him". I guide him into the Museum and start out tour. "Before we begin I want to let you know I may have asked a favor from a friend of mine and she has agreed to let you into the Shuttle but only as far as the Cockpit."
Mycroft                 I walked quickly through the kitchen to my room, and into the loo to splash some cool water on my face and start thinking of something - ANYTHING - other than Greg's muscular body.
Rosie                     "Gayg! Papa iz name is Gayg! Don' be an idit."
Greg                      "Are you sure that's all you do?" I ask as I continued rubbing his thigh, moving my hand upwards a little and I hoped he was getting the hint. I knew it would help me get to sleep at least.
Sherlock
Mycroft                 I leaned down and brushed my lips against his. "You would never hurt me," I whispered, and kissed him again, more confidently.
Mycroft                 I heard the knock on my door, and groaned.
Sherlock               Sighing, my mood seems lower from earlier, almost to the extent of my often-dark periods, "There's something going on. Something deeper than a love affair gone wrong. Something even deeper than Smith being a Russian spy. Nina's words trouble me greatly."
Greg                      I had noticed the name Peter but brushed it off, needing to ask one more question then would let Sherlock go at him full blast. "What's this Peter's surname?" I asked, and it was another test on his honesty.
Greg                      "It's the usual shit but in a different country, and maybe Smith wasn't her actual name? If there were code names like Boris and Natasha then Smith is a very common name. Covering up actions." I thought aloud and finished the last of my coffee in one gulp.
Rosie      "Oh you mean how that lady at the park won't try to touch Daddy no more cause she be able to see that we are a popper famly and her mean boy won't be able to say I'm weird cause my Daddy isn't married and shouldn't have a kid!!!" I'm so happy! Gotsta dance a bit to show my happiness cause I'll splode if I don't.
Carlton                 "I've worked with Ms. Anthea several times before sir, and I've even cut Mr. Holmes hair once before - him and his brother's - so she only had to give me a few notes about your situation before sending me over. I can assure my discretion is ultimate. Any good barber is worthless without knowing how to keep things to themselves." I sensed Gregory was discomforted by the sounds coming from the sitting room, so I could tell he cared greatly about the other gentlemen.
Greg                      I could feel him squirming a little, but I kissed his thighs, perhaps leaving a small mark just visible enough for him and when I began fiddling with his boxers, he lifted my chin, so I could meet his eye.
Sherlock               Huffing, I clamber out the car, a little more subdued though. There's a definite cloud of sulk hanging over me as I peer around the market before my face lights up, sprinting off across the area
Mycroft                 "I am sure Sherlock and John will have information soon." I laid my hand on his softly.
Greg                      "We need to let the ambulance get him to Hospital Sherlock, don’t worry, I'll take you. I'll take you to see him." I said over his shouting, feeling him punching my back but I had to get him to calm down if we were going to go anywhere.
Greg                      I looked around his office for a minute before my eyes went to the sofa, a small curve of a smile playing on my lips where Mycroft was snoring away. He looked so peaceful but I knew he was going to be in pain in the morning so I left a glass of water and painkillers on the table with the lamp.
Sherlock               "Thanks....Janet." Nodding to her I spin on the spot for a quite dramatic coat splay, waving to Lestrade, "Come along Graham. Brad. Let’s find somewhere to do brunch and coffee."
John                      He gives me a chaste peck and pulls back. I let out a frustrated whine and lift my head to try and reach him again.
Sherlock               Turning back to the screen I chuckle, smiling at Rosie and nodding, "Exactly that. Now, text that address to me Graham."
Sherlock               Eyeing his arms for a moment I gingerly wriggle myself across the pillows and into them, a little stiffly and awkwardly, "John...this won't change our friendship? Will it?"
Greg                      I put my knees between his legs as we kissed, gently lifting one of his legs over my shoulder so I could reach down to tease his hole. I brushed lube over it and felt him jump at the same time he bit down on my lip a little harshly. "I can't wait until you can fuck me." I muttered.
Mycroft
Sherlock               Slamming my fist on the desk I bark, "Mycroft Holmes....no wait, forget it. I'll find himself, " before tearing off again into the depths of the hospital, guided by my own knowledge having been there so much
Greg                      I rolled with my eyes with how much he was like Sherlock and followed him to the car. I kept my eyes put the window with Peter driving, my head turning when Mycroft asked me a question.
Greg                      "As do I but with Sherlock in both of our lives, do you really things will ever settle down?" I grinned back at him and whenever he looked at me, I always noticed his eyes sort of scanning me. All the while of his thumb brushing my cheek.
James Morgan      "Wait." I sit up and give him a moment to redress. "It’s my fault. I went too far.  We're both a bit tired and possibly a bit drunk. Why don't you go sleep in the spare room? You're welcome to come cuddle with me if you want." Seeing his nervous look, "just cuddling."
Sherlock               Shuffling forwards a little I attempt to slide Bee under Mycroft's hand once more, sternly telling him, "Don't drop my daughter's toy again brother."
Dillon                    My eyes sweep up and down the cute silver fox, winking, "Might as well give him a trim all over old man. Looks like he gets quite a bit of action. Now, I'll just take my equipment through." turning, I grab a large box in one hand and a fold-up physio table to wheel through
A faint chime sounds. “And there we are,” Margaret says gently. “Time’s up, gentlemen. I have time later in the week if you want to come back. For now, why don’t you take some time alone together? There may still be more you need to say to one another.”
“Okay.” Sherlock comes and sits down, almost gingerly. “How are you?” he asks, his tone oddly polite. “How was tea yesterday?”
“I can already smell it,” Sherlock says. “Certainly. Let’s get this one.” They carry the tree to the register and Sherlock pays, then they rearrange their grip slightly and somehow get the thing back to Baker Street and up the stairs into the flat.
John                      I sigh. “Yeah, I know.” I take a deep breath. “Well I told him I didn’t date men, but I didn’t really discourage him either. I let him take me to his apartment. I... guess I just wanted to see what it would be like. I was curious.” I say talking to the floor.
Greg                      "Well, most kids are hyper at that age. I know I was and I was obsessed with aircraft. My grandad was a pilot and used to take me to work during the holidays so I could sit in the cock pit all the time." I smiled as I sat back into the sofa so I could stretch my legs over him.
Carlton                 "Good Morning sir," as I ignore the rude young man that arrived with me reach out and shake the hand of the handsome grey-haired man. "You must be Mr. Gregory? Ms. Anthea said you were in need of a trim, and I can see she was quite correct" as I give him a knowing smile.
wanted to do?". I feel honestly sad he has been so ignored.
Mycroft                 I rolled my eyes. "John's right - you are a drama queen. That pint did not damage you. Consider it an early experiment."
Sherlock               John's words seem to break my little sulk, kneeling down to help pack and whispering, hoping Rosie doesn't overhear, "My brother looked at Lestrade like he used to look at a chocolate fudge cake with extra buttercream icing."
Greg                      I had a quick look through the house earlier, but I was still getting used to everything, my singing continuing as I cleared up and found a couple books that had also been brought over from my flat. There wasn't a lot when I thought about it.
Greg                      "Not even my snoring?" I ask as a small joke, knowing he was going to be surprised none the less when he sees it.
Mycroft                 I took a seat at a corner table, my hands cradling my cup of tea while Lestrade stared at his ice cream like an excited child. "I suspected, but could tell you had suspicions that our conversation was not as private as you'd wanted it to be." I wait for him to explain his 'gut feeling' further.
Mycroft                 Greg's hand on my knee... more information for my mental files. I feel my cheeks flush just a little. "Of course not," I smile slowly. "And dinner is an excellent idea."
Mycroft                 I was still glaring at Greg when Sherlock disconnected the call. "You had to do that, didn't you... we'll never hear the end of it, you know..."
Sherlock finally remembers the cigarette burning between his fingers and quickly snuffs it out. He shifts and turns in his seat leaning forward to better face John on stage.
Sherlock               My head tilts very slowly to the side by a few degrees, "It was interesting to catalogue your noises but it will be better to actually watch you. Please?"
John                      “Yes.” I gasp out, closing my eyes again. I think about Sherlock’s mouth on me. We’re back at the flat through, he’s sitting in his chair and I’m standing in front of him, my hand in his hair. My pace quickens, and I add a little twist to the uptake.
Greg                      "I just. I dunno, I just reckon it was the fever talking to rather than his own will. Especially with how he's been with me since I've been in the house." I sip from the water and meet his eye.
Mycroft                 I folded up the blanket and waited for Greg to come back.
Sherlock               Snapping now, "Can't you go any faster Lestrade? What use are these silly panda cars if you can't get me to the hospital for my brother?"
Mycroft                 Hesitantly, I picked up the envelope on the top, and slid the letter out of it, unfolding it. I stared blankly at the carefully-written Cyrillic script, and looked expectantly at Greg.
Mycroft                 I froze, my eyes searching Greg's for some hint that what he was saying wasn't true, and not finding it. The rational part of my brain understood - I had since read some of the e-mails, and it really made sense, however much my heart rejected the idea. I sat silently, fists clenched, knuckles white.
James Morgan      I keep an eye on the bloody DI coming at me as I fumble for the switch. A gun would be nice to have right about now. "Back off. Don't you understand?!?!" Turning to look at Holmes "go ahead and kill me, you fascist dick! My death will leave a legacy for those of us brave enough to change the course of History!" While looking at Mr. Holmes I hadn't noticed Greg was only about 2 feet from me. I lunge for the switch to set off the explosion that will end Congress.
Greg                      "I'll try… no promises though." I chuckled and rushed out the door, grabbing two quick coffees on the way and I didn’t even have to show my badge when I arrived at the French embassy.
Sherlock               Squeezing his hand I smile, seeming content now, shuffling around to sit on the bed facing the wall once more next to John, "I believe that is the correct term? Or would you prefer something else? Partners is difficult as it alludes to a longer, deeper relationship and we are already working partners. Lovers is inaccurate as of yet, though we may move up to that in time."
Greg                      "It’s just where the names come from... maybe you should do some research when we get back.  We will be coming back for more questioning, Mr. Carter, so if I were you, I would stop being so hostile with us." I warned as we stood up and he almost seemed to run at the sight of his boss waving that his break was over.
Mycroft                 "Nonetheless, they are far more socially acceptable than a sheet in this city, and this day and age."
Mycroft                 After a quick wash, I climbed back into bed, suddenly remembering that Greg was just in the next room. I hoped my voice hadn't carried
thank you. GL. I drifted off to sleep quite easily knowing Sherlock and Mycroft were happy.
Sherlock               Nodding to them both I set the laptop on the nearby table, sitting on the edge of the bed and keeping my voice low, "Tell me everything."
John                      “Interesting.” I say looking a little thoughtful. “You know, Sherlock is always a little loose-lipped when he’s sick too.”
John                      “Yes, But I do have some Lidocaine that I nicked from the clinic. But it doesn’t go very deep.”
Update on Lestrades - still in Sydney, and have found hotel. Team on way there now.
John                      “Uh huh... right.” I roll my eyes a bit, grinning at him.
Dillon                    Finishing my massage of his top I lean back, beaming down at the relaxed man on the table, "That's that done. Now, I noticed you're probably hurting in errr...." my eyes flick to his rear, "...other places. Slight limp. I could take care of that too for you." Giggling, I wink, "No more limp."
Greg                      "Well... I just..." stammered as I cut the bread and didn't know if I could be angry about it, wondering how she knew I needed extra-large condoms and it just felt like a small bit of an invasion of privacy.
I'll bring the evidence I have so far -SH
Mycroft                 I had just taken off my jacket and settled myself on the sofa when I looked up and saw Greg slip into the room. He looked much more relaxed and rested than he had earlier in the day. "Tea?" I smiled, pouring myself a cup.
Mycroft                 My head snapped to Dillon. "And that's ENOUGH from you, young man." I said angrily. "You were hired to rehabilitate my shoulder after a gunshot wound, not to critique any other part of my life. I suggest you pack up and leave. Now."
Sherlock               I totally miss the quote of course, taking her words for face value, "I have no wish at all to interfere with your politics but my brother..." scrunching my nose, I shake my head, "Willa Smith took his heart. I think she still has a part of it. He needs to know the truth, the whole truth."
Mycroft                 "Children are resilient. I'm sure she will have completely forgotten the event soon." I nodded.
Peter Harkness    “Okay, okay. But if you ever change your mind or get bored, I hope you’ll let me know. It’s seems such a waste to let this pass by when such good chemistry is hard to come by, especially in this town” as I look as softly as I can into his eyes with a small smile on my face. God this was going to be torture to keep working with him if this was the only taste I was going to get.
Sherlock               My face creases into a look of abject horror, "You're going on a date with a man"
Greg                      The cab with sherlock in had sped away before I could get in so I had to jog back to the embassy, my running routine meaning that I actually got back before them. I felt my phone buzzing and knew it was Mycroft calling me.
Give me 10 minutes GL. "Mycroft... I’m heading out to meet Sherlock. I'll see you later." I leant over the bed to gently rock his arm, kissing the side of the head when he looked over at me tiredly. He'd been working hard the last few days.
Nina Boucher      I take the paper and without even looking at it lay it on my desk, picking up the towel I had brought in with me earlier and head back to work. I would need to get a message to James later to keep him apprised, but that would have to wait.
Mycroft                 I ached all over, not just my shoulder. "John plans to come by this morning to change the dressing again. I should eat something and take the new pain medication before he arrives." I said, starting to swing my legs off the bed.
Mycroft                 "Thank you, Little Brother." I nodded, glancing at John. "And thank you, Dr. Watson."
Sherlock is sitting in a jazz club, waiting for the next performer to take the stage. He and John had finally come to terms with their love for each other and had been officially a couple now for a few months. John had excused himself to go to the restroom during the intermission. Normally John did not approve of Sherlock smoking, but had made an exception for nights when they would visit this classy jazz club they had discovered while on a case. John would occasionally even take a drag off Sherlock's cigarette acknowledging it added to the romantic ambiance of these date nights. So Sherlock lights a cigarette just as the lights dim for the next performer, and when they come back up, a man has walked out onto the stage. A man Sherlock knows better than anyone else in the universe. A man who should normally have no business being on stage at a jazz club having never shown any skills in the musical arts, but yet there he is, his John Watson.
Rosie                     Pfft. Boring. "Food is boring". My tummy disagrees and does that grrrr thing.
Greg                      I took a deep breath when I got to my room, just concentrated on getting changed into my running stuff and I put music on quietly in the treadmill/gym room so I could still hear Mycroft if he needed me. I just needed something to clear my mind a bit
Rosie        I try hard to remember. "We talkeded about how you and Daddy love each other and rings mean the whole world can see it and that if Daddy takes the ring we get bee hives on the roof and don't have to hide them in the basement no more".
James Morgan
My brother's situation is fresh in my mind. He lost something precious once. It damaged him, and I fear it damaged me in return. Caring is not an advantage. But I am helpless in the face of John -SH
Sherlock               Beaming into it I call John over, both of us waving to Rosie and murmering soft, loving words goodnight
Mycroft                 I looked at Greg, silently asking for help.
John                      I stand a little taller at that and reach for Sherlock’s hand.
John                      He steers me towards the planetarium. “Oh alright.”
Rosie                     Oops. I think I gots the pretty polish on the table and on Myca’s hand cause I gots so excited. "Papa says bees are disapp... disapp... disapp. Ugh. going away and no one knows why." The next part is a secret so I whisper, "even Papa doesn't know why." I gets tears cause some day they might all fly away and I won' see none every mores.
Greg                      I followed her into the gazebo and found some chairs for the three of us, letting sherlock sit nearer the end of the table to have a look at the honey he'd bought while I spoke with Nina. "It's about what happened with Ms. Smith. We want to know what REALLY happened."
Don't make me phone you. -SH
- a book on gay sex for beginners
Anthea                  "Just the usual forms and letters, sir" as I indicate on each one where he should sign. "And at least frustrated is better than alone and bored...or dead" and I pause as he looks up at me and swallows in what I assume is annoyance, but maybe it's realization of some epiphany I see in his eyes. Too hard to tell with him.
Rosie                     "Papa does it for us. Show Myca, Papa. Take off your shoes! Unca Myca, Papas nails are so pretty."
Mycroft                 "Definitely." I beamed, letting his hands go. I started to turn toward the door when I felt his hand on my shoulder, turning me back toward him.
Greg                      "I've got security experience and I'm pretty handy with a shotgun. Mycroft wanted only the best so that's why my chief back home sent me here. I am the best for the job apparently.." I shrugged and left out the part of having nothing back home for me anymore.
Greg                      "Uh, what usually happens when you find something mysterious? It gains your interest and you want to find out everything and anything about it." I said as the first thing that came to mind and was taken aback by his bluntness somewhat regarding this.
Greg                      "That’s why I asked you out for dinner. Flirted with you a little, to see how he'd react." I looked up at for a moment before taking a spoonful of the ice cream and it was like heaven in a mouthful. I shut my eyes to really savour it.
Sherlock               The bridge of my nose wrinkles, glancing away, "I try not to deduce you. It just makes you rather annoyed and leads to arguments"
The audience is a sea of deep breaths, women tearing up, and whispers as they all focus their attention on Sherlock. He only pauses for a second as he processes what John had just done before he deftly rises from his seat and moves towards the short small stage weaving gracefully between the few tables separating him from John. Sherlock never breaks his eye contact with John and halfway to him, he confidently replies with a "Yes!"
Mycroft                 I ran my hand up Greg's chest, tracing over the buttons until I reached his collar. I opened the top two buttons one-handed, revealing a glimpse of his muscular chest, and my fingertips teased the silvery hair there. I kissed just behind his ear, and felt him relax a little.
Mycroft                 "Hrmph," I huffed with a cough. "I know for a fact that Sherlock still smokes... just never around John or Rosie"
Mycroft                 I whimpered when he pulled me up, but welcomed his kiss, my hand still stroking his cock.
Mycroft                 I finished my slice, licking some errant sauce off my fingers. I looked around for my glass of wine, my eyes falling on the shattered glass across the room. "I suppose I need to get another wine glass..." I smile ruefully.
Sherlock               Glaring at Lestrade I shake my head, "How far along are you in your investigations about the one responsible for shooting my brother, Geoff?"
Mycroft                 We settled in to watch the movie Greg had chosen. Comfortable, I started to doze off, when I felt his hand shaking me awake
Rosie                     "Borrrin'. Bed is borin'."
Greg                      "Yeah, Sherlock will have the Information and then John will stop him from telling me right away because of the personal connection... the stress. I know how it works." I used my other hand around the stress and felt him squeeze my hand as he shuffled closer to me.
John                      “You still feel a bit warm. You should have called me last night. Or gone to the A&E. You need antibiotics.”
Mycroft                 "There are a few things I'd like you to look into. We will discuss them at length tomorrow. In the meantime, please get settled. Peter can show you your room, and perhaps take you out to see some sights... I'm sure you're restless after 8 hours on a plane."
Mycroft                 I uncovered the tray, and motioned to Greg. "Help yourself," I said, taking one of the sandwiches.
- a package of silk rope
Mycroft                 I groaned, and reached over to grab my phone, and rolled my eyes. "Greg, Sherlock insists we turn on the television. "
Greg                      "Okay. So, worry less, I'll have the stitches taken out in a couple weeks and I'll have a cool scar. Men dig scars." I gave him a sly wink as John spoke to a paramedic and I could see a small smile on his face.
Greg                      "Great… Just trust me." I whispered in French and got out of the car, taking Peters card and smiled, knowing he had been listening, "It's fine, we'll head out for a long walk and maybe some ice cream." I then followed Mycroft inside.
Rosie                     "But I want to see Daddy in a skirt."
Greg                      "Wait... Wait... Stop, I don't want to cum like this..." I didn't mean to, but I gripped his hair tightly, dropping to my own knees when I heard a mutter of pain. I did have an idea of what I wanted to do with him, but I guessed he wasn't that experienced.
John                      “I... I don’t know. I was just kind of letting you take the lead.” His hair was tossled from where I had my hands in it. It was curly and hanging in his face. That caused another pang of arousal to wash through me.
Has he sent you insane yet? Do you need me to take over? -SH
Sherlock               I stare out the window for a period of around five boring minutes before sticking my nose into my phone again, letting the silence stretch between us broken only by small huffs from me
Sherlock               Shifting a little I allow the sheet to expand, allowing John to get closer to Greg to help check him over. "He seems undamaged and in good hands brother." The sheet falls away a little to my waist, revealing I'm quite probably entirely nude under it while John is at least wearing jeans and socks
You haven't been back all day. Where are you? -SH
Greg                      I smiled and nodded, trying not to ogle him but he looked absolutely divine in the grey piece he was wearing. I saw a bit of change in his expression as if he were fighting it, the car swanky and I'm glad Peter wasn't driving this time.
Mycroft                 I stared at the pastries, half-expecting them to walk off the table under their own power. "Thank you, Lestrade, but I don't think pastries would be a wise choice this morning," I mumbled, my stomach roiling in hungover anger. Anything I ate right now would just come right back, I was sure. "Today's schedule is fairly light, actually. I have a luncheon meeting at the Hungarian Embassy, but otherwise, my day is clear."
Mycroft                 "Yes, fine, thank you." I could tell by his flushed expression that something awkward had occurred, and that he was leaving from the direction of Lestrade's room implied that Lestrade was involved. An interesting tidbit of information for my mental files, indeed. "I assume the Detective Inspector is settling in well?"
Nina Boucher      "I wish I could help you all more. I liked Willa, she had always been nice to me, and she and her staff seemed to all appreciate my cooking" I smile softly and stand up. "Well, unless there's anything else, I need to get back to work."
Greg                      "Smithson?" I question as he leant forward and I ignored Mycroft glaring at me, it just being a simple slip of the tongue.
Mycroft                 I focused on my meal, unwilling to let him see the pain in my eyes any longer. "She had mentioned a job offer, but nothing about it being overseas. She had no intention of taking me with her." My shoulders slumped a little. "I know now that she didn't have the same feelings for me that I had for her. Lesson learned, I suppose."
Mycroft                 "One moment" I walked to the room, and handed a pair of trousers and a shirt to him. "You left these behind when you last stayed here."
Mycroft                 "When I must, I do. You of all people should realize that." I shot him a meaningful look. "I do need your help with some investigative work, if you have the time..."
Greg                      "Let's have a look. It's alright, uncle Greg will take the pain away." I said softly as I moved from the worktop and picked Rosie up so she could sit on the small kitchen island. I looked over at Carlton to see if he'd seen what it was.
Greg                      I sat up a bit when I heard his voice coming out a little hoarse and turned down the TV so I could hear what he was doing. My heart was pounding, a million things going through my head to whether he was dreaming or not.
John                      “No, it’s ok. I liked it. I like you. The kissing was nice. It’s just... not what I want.” I say pulling my trousers up and rebuttoning my shirt. “And thanks for the offer, but I can catch a cab back to my hotel.”
John                      “I can see what Molly is doing today. I can come with you to meet Dimmock.” I suggest.
Greg                      "I was jealous because Caroline left for me a more attractive and frankly, better man and I just thought that there was nothing stopping you from doing that same. So... I was just gonna try and kick him out." I blurted and it made his eyes return to me again.
that's just common sense. Would it be worth me talking to Mycroft when we make a journey to the Hungarian Embassy in a few hours? GL
Sherlock pulls one arm away from John and reaches into his white tuxedo jacket pocket, his other arm wrapping tightly around John's waist. Sherlock leans toward the microphone while turning his face to keep looking at John.
Sherlock               Dashing over to where I last saw my brother I pause, spinning around and yelling at Lestrade, "Where's Mycroft? Where is he Lestrade?"
Mycroft                 I shrugged. "I suppose it was." I struggled to remember last night, the bourbon quite effective at erasing most of it.
Greg                      "I need to do a few things before I assist Sherlock... Do you trust me, Mycroft?" I said as I looked round the room and then looked dead into his eye. This couldn’t work if he didn’t.
Sherlock               Dropping my arm load of books and pajamas immediately with a clatter I kneel, opening my arms, "My little Rosie."
Greg                      "He still has one." I said softly as I walked in and smiled at John, everything of mine from my flat now in place. It felt very homely.
John                      “Sure? Got anything stronger than coffee?” I smile at him.
Greg                      I saw the warmth in his eyes and was taken back a little, my head nodding and I knew we had the rest of the afternoon off. "I hope I wasn't being too forward before. I didn't even know if you swung both ways." I said after a couple minutes of us walking in silence.
You haven't, believe me, okay? I wouldn't just be saying this to make you feel better because that would be useless. GL
Sherlock               Striding off I pretend not to hear Lestrade, glancing around and attempting to open a random door
Greg                      "Good. Let’s approach her slowly and not make it seem like an interrogation..." I sighed as we began walking in, my eyes looking around as well as keeping an eye on Sherlock.
“Wha – what is this?” Norman gasps. “You can’t do this! You can’t prove anything, except the affair! I told you about that myself, why are you – ”
“It’s fine. I couldn’t possibly care less right now,” he says honestly, and that makes John laugh.
Sherlock doesn’t answer immediately, his brows knitting together. “Mycroft knows about it…”
“I’m really not in a glass half-empty mood tonight,” John says, sounding smug, and Sherlock laughs.
“Well,
Sherlock kisses her hair and tries to calm her as John cleans the wound as gently as possible, then tapes a bit of gauze onto her forehead. She claws at it, trying to get it off, and Sherlock holds her arms down and remonstrates. “No no, that’s got to stay in place. Your father knows what he’s doing.”
They’re just pulling each other to their feet and giggling a bit as they tuck themselves away when someone opens the door to the changing room. They freeze, listening, the laughter evaporating as the dangers of their current reality return abruptly.
Someone’s brought out marshmallows to toast over the fire. Lestrade asks if they want to come over and roast any, but they both decline. “I’ve got what I need right here,” John says lazily, holding up his beer and swirling the liquid in it around in circles. Sherlock feels inwardly very pleased that John declined, too. He’s content as anything to stay precisely where he is, with John’s compact form pressed up against him, their feet and legs touching on the coffee table, too. The other voices around them are loud and jovial, but Sherlock notices that both he and John are rather quiet, both of them throwing out the occasional quip just often enough to not have their quietness remarked upon, but not engaging further than that. He can feel the warmth of John radiating into him, and his skin is alive with want for more, a hunger gnawing within him to turn ever so slightly and put his arms around John, bury his face in his hair, put a knee possessively over John’s lap and pull him to himself… the thoughts are so loud, it feels audacious to be thinking them in such proximity to John. He can feel his pulse thudding in his ears, his chest, at the very root of himself, deep within his pelvis and collecting in his testicles.
Sherlock waits as he turns on the kettle, filling it and then plugging it in and switching it on, then reappearing in the sitting room. He comes back to the sofa and Sherlock reaches for his hand and John takes it, sitting down with him again, his other arm draped around Sherlock’s shoulders. “That could be good,” Sherlock says. “With shish taouk?”
He finishes and lets out the rest of his breath, looking both deflated and defeated, and his scowl is somehow far sadder than it is angry. “Wow,” Molly says, not sure what else to say. “That does sound rough. I do think that something must be wrong, with him, I mean. He’s forgotten to pick Rosie up from daycare more than once in the past couple of weeks, and Kate Whitney’s had her more often than not, recently. I’m on for tomorrow, since it’s Saturday and I’m free. John’s not usually at a clinic on Saturday, but he asked Kate to take her, and Kate can’t, so she’s asked me. I don’t mind, but I do wonder why he’s been so… unavailable, lately.” Molly hesitates, knowing how dangerous it is to criticise John Watson to Sherlock in particular, but it’s got to be said. “I just hope he’s okay,” she adds, trying to justify what she’s said.
“I’m kidding,” I say, trying to salvage the moment. “I just meant – you know more about making this, that’s all. Just – point me in the right direction.”
There’s an ellipsis, then Sherlock’s response.
And he does.
Sherlock gets up and pads barefoot over to the kitchen to put the kettle on, then wonders idly if he’s eaten yet. No, he decides. Right, then: food, because he’s got to get on with the task of figuring out what to do about John. It’s been six days since he was in Molly’s lab. That was a Friday. The following day, she went to pick Rosie up and, as she later related it, found John drunk and living in filth, Rosie neglected and dirty. After much debate and consultation with Kate Whitney, a decision was made to not return Rosie to the flat. Molly and Kate went on Sunday evening to explain this to John, that they were going to take Rosie in turns for the time being in lieu of turning her over to the relevant authorities.
The truth is, I’m a fucking coward and I know it. I’m just so afraid of fucking this up. He’s everything to me. That’s the truth. He’s so much to me that it scares me. I’ve lost him before, more than once, and the last time was entirely my own fault, shoving him away like I did. There’s still more I need to say about that, but it’s got to be the right moment. It has to mean enough. I can’t misstep here, I just can’t. I eat the rest of my French toast, the peaches tangy and sweet, the vanilla-infused mascarpone delicious, and the conversation takes a natural turn to something else. It’s perfect, honestly, I think, pulling on my spring jacket as Sherlock hands his card to the server a bit later. We get ourselves back onto the pavement, blinking in the sunlight and a little tipsy, and walk back to Westminster, taking our time to enjoy the free Saturday with neither case nor infant to occupy us. We bump into each other frequently, shoulders or the backs of our hands brushing together, but it’s fine. Neither of us apologises or pulls away, but it doesn’t become anything more, either. That’s the problem: we seem to have settled at this particular place. We’ve been friends for so long that no one’s asking questions about who/what/how we are. This is it: we’re like this now. And it’s not terrible at all. But God, I want so much more.
“I marinated it,” he says, which is utterly bland. John hums his acknowledgement, but Sherlock wants to step this up. “I thought it would suit the flavour profile you generally seem to like,” he adds. “You frequently favour many different Asian cuisines. Chicken thighs on the bone tend to already be quite tender, but I thought the marinade would help that, too.”
John shakes his head. “No – I just – I wasn’t expecting it to – er, escalate so quickly. I’m very down for this. Definitely!”
“Okay.” Molly twists the combination lock on the fridge shut – not that it would keep Sherlock out if he decided to take an interest in her specimens, but it’s worth trying for some security, at any rate – and rapidly calculates transit times. “I’d best get going, then,” she says.
“Yes, you did,” Sherlock contradicts flatly.
It’s the measured tones of Lucas Brennan, president of Ravine Valley. Sherlock and John break apart, and John takes care to look particularly flustered. “Oh! Sorry!” he says. “We were just – looking for someone, and we, er, we got – distracted, you could say.”
John tries his best to keep himself from laughing at this, and only partly succeeds. “Hence you bringing up the subject of supper,” he says, and Sherlock looks rueful. “Maybe we should have a snack, then. I had lunch with Mrs Hudson. She made egg sandwiches and vegetable soup and it was good, but on the light side.”
John smiles. “
“It’s not aliens, obviously,” Mycroft informs him with disdain. “However…”
“Neither do I.” John reaches for his other hand now, too, and Sherlock lets him have it, their fingers interlaced across the table. “That’s what I finally decided last night, though of course I wanted to talk to you about it first. I want this: I want this life, with you. I want it here in London in the flat we just rebuilt. I want to solve crimes and go chasing after villains for as long as we’re able to. And while I love this kid very much, there just isn’t a place for her in all of that. Mrs Hudson is too old to have a baby dumped on her in the middle of the night. Besides, we put her in danger when we did that, and I won’t do that to her again. It’s a shit choice to have to make, but if we accept that we have to make it, for Rosie’s sake, then this is what I want.
John inhales hard, his face growing so emotional that it physically hurts Sherlock to see. “God, Sherlock – if only I had known!”
Kate takes a deep breath and looks at Molly. “Well… here it is: at the start of this, I was working, too, and it was getting hard, juggling things with Rosie. Especially last minute, like when the daycare would call and that. It was a bit tough. But Stan’s father passed away a month ago and we came into some money. Enough so I don’t have to work anymore. I resigned at the office three weeks ago. Stan’s still got his job at the bank and will until he retires in fifteen years. It’s a good job and we’re situated nicely. It’s freed me to be there whenever Rosie’s needed, and I’ve liked it a lot. Maybe you’ll think – whatever you think of me, given that my own son died of an overdose, but I think we’re good for Rosie. I like having her. It’s – soothed the grief a little, given me someone else to love and take care of. I’m – I’m not suggesting I keep her completely. But if you’re asking what I’d like, then that’s my answer: I
Molly covers her mouth. “An assassin?” she repeats.
John gets up and comes to read over his shoulder, his proximity far more distracting than he probably realises. “So,” he says. “Jimmy Walders, possibly not his real name, reported that his partner Ian Loring went missing while on a week-long stay here last year.”
“It’s a coordinating service of some sort,” Sherlock says. “It’s just a theory, and I could be quite wrong. There’s nothing to even suggest that there’s any link. But this particular exhibitor is here for nearly every convention…” he trails off, and John has no clearer understanding than he did before.
Sherlock knows when to back off and does so rapidly. He shrugs. “Just curious.”
John frowns. “When?”
John feels heat rise to his cheeks. “He asked me to help him figure out whatever he might need to know in order to navigate the whole thing,” he says, studying a forkful of pink soufflé. “Not – I mean, neither of us knew then that it would be more than that first drink you asked him out for. I thought it was what he wanted, and since he asked… I thought that the thing to do, as his best friend, was to help him get it. Get you, if that was what he wanted. And… he did like you, you know. He liked spending time with you. It wasn’t anything to do with you.”
John finds himself oddly nervous about saying this out loud. “I’ve actually… it’s not the first time I’ve thought about it,” he says, clearing his throat. “And the other night, after the hot tub, when you had me backed up against the door, there – er, yeah. That definitely confirmed that I’d be… interested in trying this, if it’s something you think you might like?”
Sherlock picks up one of the pamphlets and leafs through it rapidly. “You’re an entertainment booker,” he states. “Someone who suggests bands and musicians for weddings.”
Ella had re-crossed her legs then and told him that this was more common than most parents realise. She’d reached for her laptop and brought up website after website about parents who regretted having become parents, women and men both, to his surprise. She’d gone on and pointed out that, given the circumstances of Rosie’s birth, his complicated relationship with Mary, including her having shot Sherlock, and then the turmoil surrounding her death, it was rather more understandable than usual in his case. “Not everyone is meant to be a parent,” she’d said. “I agree; it has very little to do with how you feel about your daughter now. Had you and Mary discussed having children before you found out she was expecting?”
Sherlock               Drawing myself up to my full height I gather my coat around me, attempting to loom over them both, "He's mine now. Go away with your flirting."
Sherlock               Slouching back on the sofa I glare into the kitchen, "It obviously gave me brain damage, long seated issues with alcohol and memory problems. The only good thing was it was your bed I vomited on."
Mycroft                 I jumped at the loud noise, and I gasped as Lestrade shoved me into a nearby alleyway, looking about nervously. My heart raced, both from the adrenaline of his sudden actions, and at the warmth of his body pressed up against mine. After a moment, I put my hands on his shoulders. "Just a car backfiring," I gasped.
Greg                      "I've liked men since I was 17 but never really told anyone and it's not a new thing, no, he would come around nearer the end of cases and I dunno. He just seemed mysterious, understood the hassles of a job like mine. We could have a decent chat if we had the time. " I explained.
Greg                      I smoothed down his skin with my hand as I pulled the tape off gently. "Yeah, made him grow up a little." I mutter as I look over the wound and part of me is jealous of sherlock having a child to look after where Caroline would deny him again and again.
John                      I chuckle a bit and press down more letting my hips press back up into my hand. I rub myself through my pants, then getting impatient I peel down my pants and kick them off. My cock stands tall and hard as I wrap my fingers around the base.
Mycroft                 My eyes had been fixed on my brother, when I heard a loud pop, and felt pain radiating through my rib cage. I looked down to see a rapidly-spreading crimson stain on my jacket, when a second wave of pain came, and my knees buckled. I crumpled to the ground like a rag doll.
Anthea                  "He seemed...like a good...fit" I reluctantly respond. "I believe you two may have more in common than you realize if you give him a chance. And this attack has made me rethink my own stance on 'sentiment' as you put it... perhaps it has had a similar effect on you?" as I pick up the folders and push them back into my bag.
Rosie                     "You need me." I get out of Gaygs arms and crawl up to lay my head on Mycas pillow.
John's voice is beautiful and the audience is enraptured by his performance, even catching on that he is directing his singing at one person at the audience. John is singing these words directly at Sherlock making frequent eye contact with him but otherwise not looking at anyone else directly. Several people near Sherlock have started to watch his reaction instead of John by now recognizing the famous detective and his doctor partner.
Greg                      I looked into the car, jumping to the other side and I was glad when we finally started making our way to the embassy. I'd seen the way Peter had looked at me but I ignored it, my eyes looking over him when we were at traffic lights.
- Go easy on him.
Rosie                     I wiggle and wiggle in hopes of being set down. "Down now. Please. Tank you." Forever passes and I'm still not down. "Now pleasethankyou!"
But who is behind it?
Sherlock               As I'm hustled out of the room I shoot my brother a quick glare, then gesture sharply with my head towards Greg, silently ordering him to do something
Greg                      "Flight was alright and I have my bags. Where are we headed first?" I asked softly and I was strictly in a professional mode but smiled weakly. I had been slapped in the face by the heat, my jacket already coming off.
Sherlock               I return the look with a slightly sulky one, clutching my honey bag to my chest after checking it was all undamaged, "I'm not an utter socially inept fool Lestrade. I do have some human decency, though being raised alongside Mycroft it's a wonder any survived."
Rosie                     "Daddy isn't silly. He’s serialus."
John                      I walk down the hall with Rosie in my arms. As we approach the room we hear Mycroft and Sherlock talking. “Papa!” Rosie squeals. We enter the room.
Rosie                     I talkeded with the pretty boy with the so pretty hoodie as he set up a bed for Myca. He took off his hoodie and had just a normal white tank top underneath. How borring... Unca Myca came in wearing a robe and then Gayg called me into the kitchen. Grabbing my crime scene coloring books I went into the kitchen and set up to do my drawing at the table. Gayg was there with the old guy who looked a bit scary and had lots and lots of sharp things. I'll be good and keep an eye on him so he can't hurt my Unca Gayg. I give him Daddy's "yeah I see you, don't try nothing" look.
Mycroft                 I sat back in my chair, looking at Sherlock expectantly.
Has he or did he used to have a kind of shaved head with a tattoo on his arm of a bulldog? GL
Mycroft                 I choked on my tea. "Get to... know me a bit more?" It had been years since anyone had been inclined to try to get closer to me, and longer since I'd allowed it. Perhaps he only meant to get to know me better to facilitate the job...
John                      I look at him surprised, with a raised eyebrow. “I... I don’t know. I guess we’d have to see where it goes. Would this man be wine-ing and dine-ing me proper?”
Brad Carter          "Yeah. Can I help you? Need a room?"
John                      I look up at him. “No, never. I’m sorry I left. I mean... I had a good tome with James today...” I blush a bit. “But I’m sorry I left mad.”
Sherlock
John                      “No, no. It’s fine.” I laugh. I stand next to him and put my hand on his shoulder. “It was an accident.” I give him a small smile. “What’s next?”
Greg                      "Not at all, I'm looking forward to maybe trying some American ice cream while we're at it." I smiled and knew he had a lot of questions. I was just keeping my eyes out for anything suspicious if Peter was doing something.
Greg                      "See you John." I waved and went through to see Mycroft sitting in his chair by the fire, looking exhausted and a bit pale from what he'd just gone through with John
Greg                      "Yeah? How else would you put it?" I laugh as he nearly spat his drink everywhere and thought this could be a laugh at least.
Greg                      I dropped off with Mycroft’s arm around me and one of my legs draped over his. I'd pulled the covers up at some point, blissfully snoring against his shoulder.
Greg                      "Good and you can do shifts of heading home with Rosie, coming back here." I said as I pulled Sherlock’s coffee cup away from him and put it back on the tray if he wasn't going to be drinking it.
Sherlock swallows visibly. “I – would rather not.”
“Of course,” John says. “Anything.”
John nods, then kisses him again, his lips closed. It lasts for a long moment, and then he backs away again. “Agreed,” he says. “We’ve got to find these men. Let’s call Lestrade and see where he’s got with his end of the investigation.”
Sherlock frowns. “When did she give you those?”
Sherlock looks around the tea room a bit incredulously. “Here?”
John is a little surprised by this, but doesn’t say so. “Sure, if you want,” he says. “Brunch here or somewhere else?”
Finally it stops and his face is still buried in the crook of John’s shoulder, breath shuddering out of him, his arm gripping John’s shoulder and back. “Hey, hey,” John says, pressing kisses into his hair. “That was incredible – that was so hot! Are… are you all right?”
So I said yes. It made sense. We’ve got Rosie every other weekend, on the strict agreement that we don’t take cases for those four days every month. There’s a whole security hullaballoo that makes it possible, too. So far there’s been no overlap between our cases and our weekends having Rosie at Baker Street. Once Sherlock even snarled to Lestrade, on a Friday around noon, that we had to get the case wrapped up before six o’clock, because that was when his parents were arriving to deliver Rosie for the weekend, and to everyone’s surprise he pulled it off, like a miracle. We both smelled of the sewers and were dirty from head to toe, but we made it just in time, both of us still with wet hair from our showers when the downstairs door opened and Sherlock’s parents came up.
“Right, yeah,” John responds. “Very – scientific.”
Sherlock smiles, more to himself than to her. “Yes.”
Sherlock thinks about this for a long time. Then he says, “Thank you,” and strides across her office for the door. This time he stops. “Do you want me to come again?”
John glances at him. “Good,” he says, not really caring. “And you actually watched it without, er, getting distracted?”
“See you in half an hour,” Sherlock says again, in a murmur this time, and it’s astonishing how different his tone is. It’s low and velvet-smooth and gentle. She remembers him the way he was the last time he was here, unshaven and unkempt, dressed like a homeless person, a junkie, sobbing wildly and dripping everywhere, high and out of control, staggering into the street. What an amazing difference being loved can make, Ella thinks, marvelling again.
This is Horace’s cue to go. He gives me an unrecognisable look, then makes for the door and the stairs. I watch him go, wondering why I still think he looks vaguely familiar. When the front door closes downstairs, I look at Sherlock. “Interesting,” I comment.
Yet John continues to warm to him, and Sherlock cannot help but feel it acutely and want to respond to it. He considers every action thrice over before committing to it, his sole consideration being how John will interpret it, react to it. He doesn’t know why it’s happening, why John’s smiles have grown fonder, but they have. One evening he stirs, shifting his laptop to the side table and stretching enormously. “Feel like watching something?” he asks.
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock says at once. “I hope you never doubted that.”
“Er, yeah. Rather.”
When the wave releases its grip on him, John sags onto Sherlock in a boneless heap, his back heaving as he pants. Sherlock’s hands are still on him, lazy now, stroking up and down his back, and they lay together that way for a timeless drift, afternoon sunlight streaming in through the bedroom curtains and warming his back and legs.
“We can share it. We wear the same size,” Sherlock says, with a serving of side eye that makes John’s blood tingle in anticipation that he can’t help at all.
Sherlock nods. “So I did. And so you were.” This is getting a little much, so he turns the question back to John. “And you? What did you think of me?”
“So how was the opera?” John asks, still sifting through banking papers.
Sherlock swallows. He can’t tell whether he wants more to keep going or if he needs the short pause, but he doesn’t want to disagree. He nods and touches his tongue to his lower lip. “Yes. Okay.”
Sherlock’s laugh is low and more sensual than it has any right to be, given his general lack of experience with all this. “Then don’t,” he says. His long fingers pluck the towel open easily, letting it drop to the floor, and John’s erection springs free with almost embarrassing enthusiasm. Sherlock looks at it with open satisfaction. “This,” he says admiringly, “is perfect. And – I don’t know what I’m doing, but I trust that you’ll correct me if I get it wrong.”
“You’re not about to tell me that you would have offered to come with me,” Sherlock interrupts, looking at him now. His eyes are sharp in the streetlight. “Not with Mary pregnant, your marriage freshly reconciled.”
“I want you in me,” he manages, body contorting under the ministrations of John’s wicked mouth. “
Sherlock bites back the urge to say something sarcastic along the lines of tree shopping being more of a tedium than a joy. Who knows. For John, perhaps it is a joy. “Shall we?” he says instead, to John, who nods.
“You’re okay,” he tells her, the way he would when she’s hungry or crabby, though his throat is tight this time. “Thank God you’re okay, but you’re okay.” He searches her face. “You still know me, don’t you?” he asks softly, and Rosie bats at his face and makes a sound that might be agreement. He holds her to his chest, then digs out his phone to see if Mary really sent him something.
Mycroft looks away. “He was imaginary,” he repeats quietly. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. You… your memories of that entire time were damaged. It’s my fault. Mine and Rudy’s, but as he’s dead, there’s only me left to accept this blame.”
“Most of which wasn’t even your choice or your fault,” John interrupts. “I do know that, now.”
They secure a suit-fitting appointment, taste meals and cakes, and meet with the events planner at their reception venue to discuss the finer points of table settings and electronic needs, and they don’t argue once. Sherlock finds himself relishing these tasks with triumph. Last time, it was he who booked all of the appointments, then sent Mary and an increasingly reluctant John off to complete them. This time it’s different, and John is as enthusiastic as he is. They go to their meal tasting a week after their return. John leans a little toward a cheaper meal option, but it’s his natural instinct. Sherlock suggests they splurge on the prime rib, pointing out mildly that he hopes very much that it will be the last wedding either of them pays for, and John wavers. “Technically, you’re the one paying for it,” he says, but there’s no prickliness behind his tone.
Harry and Liz took Rosie from Friday morning to Saturday, inviting them over for dinner that night to come and collect her. They spend most of the day in bed together, stirring only to forage for food, then return to bed and each other’s arms. Now they’re showered and dressed and duly preparing the salad they were instructed to bring. Sherlock has already confessed himself addicted to John’s mouth and kisses him at every possible opportunity, which delights John to an almost embarrassing extent. The euphoria grows daily, and they’re becoming freer and freer with each other, with saying what they want and how they want it, no matter how candid or graphic or sentimental or personal, and John is in heaven.
Molly nods, and Sherlock sees a grudging acceptance there. “Good,” she says, her voice soft but firm. “I’m glad. For both of you.”
John can sense his discomfort, and is temporarily more aware of that than of his own. “Maybe later,” he says. This isn’t finished yet; he can feel that Irene has more to say about it all.
“Disagree,” John says firmly. “If you’ve had an orgasm with another person – hell, even if you haven’t – if you’ve been sexual with another person, that’s all the definition you need.” He redirects them back to the subject at hand. “Is there a position you would rather try?” he asks, trying to mask just how deeply his personal curiosity on this score actually goes. It’s something he’s wanted to know for
– then that would obviously be fantastic, too, but they can cross that bridge when the moment comes. Sherlock’s put himself on top of him again, which is also interesting – maybe he feels more in control of this unfamiliar thing like this? John doesn’t know, but doesn’t mind at all. If this is how Sherlock wants to do this with him, then he’s happy. Who’s on top isn’t the point, and even if it were, Sherlock has pretty specifically stated his interest in being the one bottoming when the time comes. If he wanted it the other way, John wouldn’t be averse, either, but the thought of getting to be inside Sherlock like that is intensely arousing.
John takes pity on him and steers them down the corridor to Sherlock’s bedroom, closing the door behind them, not turning on any lights. “I want you,” he says against Sherlock’s lips, the words mashed between them. “I’ve wanted you for so long – ”
“Yes,” Sherlock tells him. “You and I are going to confirm some registrations. Let’s go to your computer.”
“I’m coming over,” Mary says abruptly, and hangs up.
“Dr Watson, my boy!” It’s the old man, Roy Turner. “All on your own, hey? Where’s your detective friend?”
“I’m extremely open to suggestion right now,” John pants, which makes Sherlock chuckle.
He groans as Sherlock strokes his penis, his palm slick with lubricant, then transfers it to himself, liking John’s groan. He wipes his hand on a corner of the top sheet and begins to move against John again, trying for a long, undulating pattern. It feels – primal, he thinks, breathing through his mouth, looking down at John’s lust-stamped face, feeling his breath on his chin. Just thrusting like this, rutting against John’s erection with his own. It feels
Sherlock inclines his head back over his shoulder a little. “Yes?”
Sherlock takes a moment to digest this, taking a long sip of his chardonnay. “I’m only asking in the spirit of information,” he says slowly. “I would very much corroborate what you said, about the… corresponding physical component to the emotional.” He keeps his eyes in his plate, feeling self-conscious about admitting it aloud and clears his throat. “That is to say… I’m very much interested. And you have a substantially stronger effect on me than any number of oysters could, too.”
John nods soberly. “Yeah. You’re not the only one. Turns out we’re both pretty good at hiding this, which is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. But yes, Sherlock: years. Probably from the very start, if I’m being honest with myself.” His eyes drop to Sherlock’s lips and he speaks very matter-of-factly. “I mean, I always knew I was attracted to you. From day one, Sherlock. And I knew you were by far the most important person in my life. That’s never changed. It just took me awhile to admit all of it to myself, and acknowledge what it all added up to, and that’s this: I love you. You’re the only person I want, that I’ve wanted since the day I met you. No one and nothing else could even compete.”
John’s laugh huffs out his nose. “What, no deductions about the shadows, the angle of the light coming in?”
you, John – ”
He blinks several times. “As you are to me,” he says, his voice low and possibly a bit self-conscious, but not shying away from it.
Sherlock slides off the table and puts himself between John’s thighs. They kiss, slowly, sensually, their bodies simultaneously relaxed, yet incredibly aroused, and it’s a nice combination. John puts his hands directly on Sherlock’s arse and continues kneading it exactly the way Alex-or-Roberto was, which is perfect – Sherlock was wishing that they were John’s hands at the time, and now they are. His tongue is in John’s mouth, their penises rubbing up against each other’s, John’s legs are wrapped around his hips for leverage.
“Well – my only – sometimes I feel that John tries to fix our issues with sex rather than communicating what’s on his mind,” Sherlock says. “It’s not a complaint per se, but sometimes I feel he uses it as an evasion mechanism.”
Lestrade shoots a smirk Sherlock’s way. “I’m surprised you let him near you with a needle.”
John looks at him, equally uncomfortable, and swallows. “I do need to hear this,” he says, his voice low and hollow. “I need you to acknowledge that I did hurt you.”
“This,” John says briefly, shifting down Sherlock’s body to take his cock in hand, and very shortly after that, his mouth. Sherlock gasps and writhes above him as he sucks and sucks, not trying to draw it out or prolong the torture. Sherlock is already so hard that at this point, he must just want to come pretty badly, so John is determined to bring that about. Although maybe he could also swing a bit of the other thing, too. Without breaking his rhythm at all, he finds the lube and gets some onto his fingers, all the while swallowing down the salty traces of what’s leaking into his mouth. He rubs his slickened fingers over the soft hair and skin of Sherlock’s balls, already feeling dozens of times freer than he did the first time they did this, then rearranges Sherlock’s legs so that they’re over his shoulders and slides his finger into Sherlock’s body. His other hand is jerking over Sherlock’s length, his lips and tongue working hard over his head and leaking slit, and Sherlock comes less than twenty seconds later, his entire body spasming and then flooding John’s mouth with his release. John swallows, swallows again, his finger buried to the hand inside Sherlock, his tongue running around the head of his cock. He
They move John out a few hours later, Harry bringing by the minivan as promised. She offers to take Rosie home with her while they move, but John says they’ll manage, and they do. They pack all of Rosie’s things and most of John’s. They take his clothing and books and DVDs and CDs and leave most of the rest. There’s a box or two of his things from uni days that they take, and Sherlock’s eyes gleam at the sight of another box labelled
Sherlock doesn’t move a muscle. “Yes.”
“Ah.” This seems to reassure Sherlock and he picks up his knife and fork and cuts himself another bite, the pastry flaking but of course not getting anywhere on him. “And were you thinking that there’s more left to say between us that should be said?”
Sherlock gets to his feet. (Has he taken John’s response as his decision to not come with him? John’s gut turns in on itself.) Sherlock hesitates, not looking at him directly. “Are you… what will you do?” he asks slowly, his voice still horribly strained.
Both Anna and Corey look a bit surprised by the speed of their departure. “Oh – great,” Anna says, hastily getting to her feet. “Do you need anything else from our end?”
“We’ll figure it out,” Sherlock says vaguely.
“I said, I don’t even know how to kiss properly,” Sherlock says, his face burning. “It’s not as though one can take a course on the subject, make a thorough study of it. I’ve missed the socially acceptable window for learning. I’m fine as I am. Don’t – fuss.”
Sherlock understands. “I see,” he says.
“You didn’t – hear anything, did you?” Sherlock asks, trying to make it sound diffident rather than just awkward.
It’s not the first time she’s given him this admonishment, and it
After a bit, Sherlock breaks it off. He opens his eyes and they’ve gone starry, his heartbeat pulsing under John’s fingertips through his shirt. He swallows and touches his tongue to his lower lip. “I’ve never done that before,” he says, a tad uncertainly. “Not – for real.”
“Sort of,” John says. “What I was really grieving was the fact that I’d got into that marriage in the first place.” He glances at Margaret. “You’re not wrong at all. I did marry Mary at least partly out of resentment toward Sherlock. I thought I was making a safer life choice. Not only was it not a safe choice at all, she very nearly took Sherlock out of my life all over again. And now, hearing that he was doing everything he was doing and enduring everything he went through for my sake – I can’t tell you what a worm I feel like. And even after all that, after I beat him half to death in a hospital one day and walked out on him without even having the guts to say goodbye to his face, he still took me back without a second thought, and kept me from falling apart completely after my daughter died. I’ve done nothing to deserve it, and yet he’s just been there for me like no one else I’ve ever known.”
Mycroft                 "I will not." I sat at my desk, my hands folded in front of me. "I'm happy to hear that Greg's well-being is so important to you," I smiled at Greg weakly.
You're useful when you have my brother contact list Gavin. -SH
Greg                      "Yeah, let's pull these blankets up a bit." I smirked slightly and got my wrist back for a moment, so I could tuck him in further. I knew he wouldn't remember this, would probably go back to his normal self but it was nice.
John                      “Yeah... not not gay.” I take a deep breath. “Can I kiss you?”
Mycroft                 I looked at him carefully. It was obvious that his past marriage had been hard on him. It was almost as hard for him to open up as it was for me, and I had no idea how to proceed
Peter Harkness       I chuckle and almost spray my beer across the table. “Fingers in a lot of pies is certainly one way to put it.” Oh we are definitely on now.
John                      “What have the Doctors said?” I ask.
Mycroft                 "I believe we are both rested and reasonably sober, yes?" I said with a mischievous gleam in my eye. I smoothed my hands along the buttons of his shirt slowly.
Greg                      "It's just a simple pasta sauce Mycroft." I smiled as I popped my head through the door and had to stop myself calling him Myc like I had with Rosie.
Mycroft                 I put out my hand for Rosie to start, as Greg opened the bottle of hot pink polish for her with a grin.
Sherlock               My face pales to almost the shade of the sheet, cowering back at the yell and grabbing John before swallowing, my eyes sweeping over the scene and taking in details I missed in my haste before blinking, "Oh. My mistake."
Greg                      I ignored that text, simply putting my phone on charge and I dropped off around 3am after a lot of tossing and turning with SpongeBob on the TV. I woke up to a lot more texts when my alarm went off at 7 for my usual morning run.
Peter Harkness    Glad to see Greg was turning the tables and taking an interest in me as well. A good sign. “Well, besides the baseball thing, my job keeps me pretty busy. I work with all the foreign embassies but tend to have one or two that take up most of my time. Current political climate being what it is here, they tend to put me on the...delicate relationship ones” I say trying to dance around the fact I was no fan of the current POTUS.
Sherlock                       Crinkling my nose a little I watch Mycroft leave, then turn and shrug to an empty office, muttering, "Dinner John? Yes, why not." before turning and stalking out.
John                      I laugh with him starting to relax a bit and forgetting my fight with Sherlock. He grabs my hand once we are out of the theater. He asks if it’s ok. I just nod, not knowing how to feel.  As we quickly head towards the shuttle, I start to worry if my hand is sweaty.
Your ‘not date’ is not right. Do try to avoid him if you see him and not only so you don't accidentally put your penis into his mouth again -SH
Greg                      "You are doing well, by the way, even if you think you're a bit rusty..." I grin as my thumb brushed against his hand, my other hand resting on his arm as we walked together.
What do you want?
Sherlock
Sherlock               Nodding firmly, I finish my little tasting experiment, giving John a calm little, satisfied smile, "That was better than I expected."
Mycroft                 Closing the door behind me, I walked through the garden, mindful of the kitchen window, where I could occasionally see Greg looking out. No point in going to the gazebo; I was sure those cigarettes were gone now, which is why I'd grabbed one from my desk earlier. Once I'd rounded the corner, I put it to my lips and lit it up, breathing in the smoke happily.
Peter Harkness    “I haven’t met him yet either, sorry. I just found out about you coming in when I came to work this morning and my boss wasn’t in yet from his morning meeting with the Secretaries by the time I left the office.” We pull up to the Embassy gates and are immediately let in as I give Michael at the gate a wink as I drive past him as he salutes back at me. I hand Greg his bags from the trunk and follow him inside.
Sherlock               Nodding, I slink into the slight shadows outside my brother’s office and rooms, keeping watch on the entrance carefully
Mycroft                 "A good idea." I sighed, not wanting to get up, but sliding to my feet. I took his hand and pulled him up off the sofa.
Mycroft                 "I selected this lovely metallic purple for you, Greg," I said with a big grin.
Greg                      "I just want to make you feel good Mycroft," I said as I left the smallest of marks down his neck and I'd gotten half of his buttons undone before he near enough pushed me away. My face flushed with embarrassment, thinking he'd wanted it as much as I had with the erection in his trousers.
Sherlock               Pushing John and Rosie into the cover of the doorway I quickly check them both, murmuring to try and calm our daughter before sagging a little as they're both unhurt. Only then do I lift my head and look out over the surging, panicked crowd to try and see if anyone was injured.
Rosie                     "Herbert this is Unca Myca and Unca Gayg and I told you all's about them and Uncas this is Herbert and he is the biggest bee ever and Papa will be sad he misseded it".
Mycroft                 I looked at him carefully, his question plain in his body language. I covered his hand with mine. "It will take me some time.,. please be patient with me." I said quietly, my eyes soft.
Greg                      "I'm fine. Thank you. He was asking after you. When the paramedics got there." I waved at first and let the silence drop for a couple minutes before blurting out the first thing that came to mind. I didn't know if he'd wanted to know or not.
Greg                      "Hey." I said softly as I stepped in and shut the door behind me, my smile easy and I noted where the glasses and new decanter was just in case he decided to throw it.
Mycroft                 My clothing discarded, I climbed back onto the bed, pressing Greg into it. "Agreed." I growled, kissing him roughly.
I am unsure -SH
James Morgan      "We? You mean you and your friend?" We stop by a coffee cart then head to the Space Museum.
Anthea                  I see them all huddled outside the door as I walk towards it when Rosie turns her head in Sherlock's arms to see me coming and smiles widely at me through the glass. I briefly turn around as I reach for the door and remind Mycroft that I have everything under control and will contact him should anything critical arise. He clearly isn't pleased with this though. When I step into the hall I take Rosie with her outstretched arms from Sherlock who begrudgingly releases her before I turn to the group of men. "Greg, once Mycroft is released in a couple days, your help would be greatly appreciated. Until we uncover who was behind this attack, discretion and additional twenty-four hour protection from you would be, I think the best solution. I could have someone bring you and some of your belongings to his home later today so you can get settled?"
Sherlock               Hissing my next words, I shake my head, "That's a horrifying thought. Tell me, does his forked tongue give you any trouble?"
“Me too. I’ll just nip into the loo.” John does so, then comes out shaking water off his hands and zips up his coat. “Shall we?”
Right, their old routine: the 2-for-1 breakfast special at the café around the corner. It must be Friday, then. John texts back:
“And I’m not asking you to give up the work, either,” John says, hugging him tighter. “It wouldn’t be fair to you. And it wouldn’t solve the problem in any case. Rosie already
A knock at the door startles them both. “Are we expecting someone or something?” John asks, his voice low.
Stacey turns back to them. “So how
Molly does know. “Baker Street,” she supplies.
“Hmm?” John’s mouth is near Sherlock’s ear. He lips at it. “What?”
With that, he takes John’s cock with his right hand and pulls it to his mouth, closing his lips around it, and it feels so good that John’s entire body spasms, nearly kneeing Sherlock in the head. It’s been
Sherlock makes a negative sound. “Not really, no. Not that I can see.”
He cups Sherlock’s face with his hands again, making Sherlock feel so cared for, so much like he’s the only thing in the world that matters for John at all right now, that he can barely speak. He puts his hands on top of John’s and tries not to combust with emotion on the spot.
