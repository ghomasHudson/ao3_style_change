Dean smiles, but keeps his eyes on his lap for a few more seconds. "Just like your food style," he finally says.
he likes to run, but doing it with someone else, with someone he's never met, will turn his one activity of solace into a train wreck he already knows he won't be able to bear. As he thinks about this, his stomach clenching with panic at every passing second, Castiel notices the way his friend's eyes wander to follow a cute waitress delivering some burgers to a neighboring table, and realizes that Balthazar probably has other things on his mind than Castiel's dilemma. "Just think of it as a babysitting gig. A long...unpaid babysitting gig where you look after...a grown man." Balthazar pauses for a second, then wrinkles his nose. "Christ, that does sound awful."
--bookings at Lawrence P.D., is the same guy who slings coffee for a living and spends his spare time reading comics and listening to classic rock.
Cas nods. “They do.”
A remark like that is probably what earned him the new bruise in the first place, and if Michael were still here, Cas is sure that Winchester would have a broken finger or two to add to his collection of injuries. Michael’s
Cas glances at the bag in Dean’s hand. “Kale,” he says, which causes Dean to promptly toss the bag away like he’s been scalded. “Oh, come on,” Cas says, walking gingerly over to Dean and reaching for the bag, “it’s not that bad. You might actually like it.”
Castiel looks up at him through long eyelashes, and Dean feels his heart speed up a little. “That’s nice of you to say, Dean.”
“My mistake.” Cas smirks and turns off his phone before sliding it back into his pocket. As discreetly as possible, with the overly optimistic hope of a nervous elementary schooler passing a “Do you like me, check yes or no” note to his crush, he grabs a pen and marks Dean as his runner-up on his bracket, with the secret, far-flung hope that maybe, just maybe he’d somehow run into Dean on the street, they’d fall head over heels for each other, and
Dean stops as well and shrugs, but doesn’t answer.
And that just makes it even worse.
“Are you okay?” Cas asks again, shoving his mask up on top of his head.
He finds it weird, though, that he doesn’t hear Cas clapping.
“I, actually, I’m here to talk to you about that.”
The woman looks up at his voice and flashes them a bright smile, but when she tosses her long, dark hair back out of her face, Dean stops short at the sight of her eyes. They’re a milky white, the color of her irises faded practically beyond recognition.
“No, no, no, hold on,” Dean says, scurrying in front of him. He holds up his hands and walks backward. “I wanna see your reaction, dude.”
Hannah, one of the other nurses on duty on the second floor, looks up when she hears him approach. By the looks of it, working on Christmas has done nothing to dampen her spirits--she’s sporting a skewed Santa hat, earrings in the shape of little Christmas trees, and a warm smile.
Sam’s eyes brighten in recognition at the name, and he’s quick to amend his statement. “Oh, no, what I told Anna is true, he had been accepted before. Back in October, actually.” Sam huffs out a laugh that sounds like he’s trying too hard to be lighthearted. “I still catch him folding and unfolding that goddamn printout of his acceptance email almost every day. He hasn’t thrown it away, though, and he hasn’t withdrawn from the race, either, so I really think he still wants to do it.”
He smirks at Dean. “Consider it a...charity case.”
“I need you to be Dean’s guide in the Marathon,” Anna blurts out.
They should’ve left. The second they scooped the money, they should’ve turned tail and gotten the hell outta dodge. But being in town, having even the slightest semblance of normalcy at their fingertips, had felt too good. They could spare a few hours for a drink or two and to regroup. It only made sense, to stop and get their strength up before figuring out how best to tackle the three hours left to get to Lawrence.
“Nothin’, Bobby,” he answers for the both of them. “Don’t worry about it.”
He can hear the bustling of the office in the background of his sister’s phone call, and she sounds slightly flustered when she replies. “Listen, Castiel, can I ask you for the biggest favor? Like, ever?”
The flames flicker with the introduction of the alcohol, and Dean squints against the smoke that starts to burn his eyes.
Dean’s nose twitches.
“Ugh, what--” He nudges his hand under his side and pulls out a sketchbook.
“Family portrait,” he says, and Cas swallows hard as he studies the drawing more closely.
Seeing that faraway look in Sam’s eyes for months on end, him gettin’ sadder and sadder with each passing day...Dean needed something else to focus on, something to distract him from the pain his brother was feeling, and the fact that there wasn’t a thing he could do to stop it.
“Finish,” he says, voice rough and heady, pupils clearly blown even in the darkness on all sides, and Dean can’t move fast enough. His cock is still slick from spit and precome, and his eyes flutter closed as he thrusts into his own hand.
“Did you find it?”
Something’s still missing, though, and he finds it quickly in the form of a charcoal flap-top cap. “Bingo,” he mutters, putting it on and adjusting it carefully before looking at himself in the mirror.
“Hope you’re posting that shit on Facebook, too,” Dean calls after him as he heads back up to his room to get changed. “I’ll be the first one to like it.”
” a few seconds later that has Dean knowing he’s fucked.
Gabriel’s made them supper and drags over an extra chair from the sitting room so they all have a place around his rickety table. Dean’s got no idea what the hell they’re eating; all he knows is that it’s better than what they were given in jail, and he eats it gratefully, scraping his fork across the plate to grab every last morsel.
“But there
is a show that was practically
Sam gives him a knowing nod. "Oh, dude, trust me, I know. Think I haven't tried telling him that? He won't listen, though. He's too--"
Dean looks up from his pie and presses his fist to his chest before letting out a soft burp. “Who?”
Dean snaps his fingers. “Yeah, actually. Most people reach up and—” He mimes reaching up for one of the handles of the umbrellas and pops his foot. “Y’know, Mary Poppins shit.”
Cas tries to brush it off by giving Balthazar a look like he’s grown three heads, but Cas has never been a good actor. Balthazar raises his eyebrows and lets out a low whistle, leaning over to see if he can catch one more glimpse of Dean amidst the bustle of the restaurant.
“Ooh, a ‘sclusie!” Charlie squeals, pulling her chair up closer to their table and resting her chin in her hands. “Dish.”
He’s heading to the breakroom when he feels a tap on his shoulder, and he turns around to see a harried woman with a small baby balanced on her hip and a toddler wrapped nervously around her right leg. She’s got a badly wrinkled museum map in her hand, and she looks at Castiel expectantly.
“Nope,” he says proudly.
“No, I just...you look fancy.”
“Dean,” Cas says, and the stress of the situation’s gotta be gettin’ to him, because he swears he feels Cas fucking tap him on the shoulder when he doesn’t respond. “Dean!”
“How did you…” Cas gestures toward his own face, then remembers that Dean can’t see him, and mentally curses himself
Castiel's mind wanders back to when he first started running, to dodge bullies and older kids on the playground, and can't help but marvel at the fact that his now favorite hobby grew out of fear. It started as a necessity--don't get beat up--and it still is one now, but for entirely different reasons. He doesn't do it to avoid getting tormented anymore, now he does it to avoid the stresses of his everyday life. The simultaneous rush and exhaustion and post-run high make him happy, and one day, something switched in his head, and running didn’t associate itself with fear anymore.
Dean rolls his eyes. The backwards tie doesn’t stop Cas from looking
“It looks like Dean Winchester just found someone worthy of turning that number up to eleven.”
And hell if Charlie and Billie weren’t lying--the place
“I love the show,” Cas says, “it’s incredible, but whenever I listen to it, I always sort of think of him, you know?”
“Uh, you just hit it.”
, run a goddamn
person she should give this job to, until:
gesture that just makes Billie flip him off. He smirks, and Hannah waves her hand in between the two of them.
“It’s nothing like that--”
“Whether or not Charlie’s ready to get his hands on a new platinum single,” Dean finishes. He mirrors her stance, leaning against the opposite jab with his arms crossed over his chest. She matches him toe-to-toe, so long that Dean actually starts to wonder if she’ll let them in at all, when she finally cracks a smile.
“Did you make ‘em?”
All the episodes are from Dean’s season. Every. Single. One.
He’s got half a mind to head back to camp just to show Sam his handiwork, but he decides it’ll be even more impressive
Dean’s never been one to mince words, and he’s not about to start now, so:
“Uh, congratulations,” Dean says. “I’m Dean, that’s Cas, and the moron who was trying to give you wrong directions is Sam. So anyway, like I was saying, you’ll wanna—”
putting it back in his bag. Just to prove that to himself, he lunges for his messenger bag and throws the flap open, rummaging around until he pulls out—
Cas glances over his shoulder at Dean and unlocks his phone. The notification is a few hours old, probably back when he fell asleep, and Cas wonders what stupid meme Dean tagged him in this time. He’s surprised, though, when he opens his app and a photo of the two of them pops up on Dean’s account.
Novak may very well have had the bulk of Dean’s attention since he’d arrived, but that doesn’t mean Dean hadn’t picked up on the quirks and eccentricities of the other men around him as well, which is exactly how he settled on Ketch to be the one to help them out of this hellhole. He’s perfect: someone with a short temper, who wouldn’t waste time on stupid things like logistics or believability after hearing that someone had supposedly dragged his name through the mud...which is exactly what Sam’s going to tell him happened.
Dean’s beard itches.
Balthazar groans and throws his arms up in the air dramatically. “Oh, come on! Why not?”
“Easy for you to say,” Gabe says, focusing on adjusting his tie in the mirror. “You think Crocs with socks is a valid fashion choice, little bro.”
“I, uh, pie isn’t usually a traditional wedding des--”
in over thinking in college, but just this once, try not to, huh?”
The boy waves his words away. “Come on, man, the least I can do is make sure you’re okay after fucking up your face.” Cas can feel the boy’s eyes roaming over his face, and before he knows it, the boy’s gently picked up one of his wrists and is replacing his hand with Cas’ own to hold the napkin in place. He takes a few steps back and studies Cas, who straightens, pressing the ice a little harder against his throbbing nose.
Balthazar barks out a laugh. “Christ, no, of course not! I’m just trying to make you feel better, mate.” He tilts his head back and downs the rest of his beer, swallowing quickly before setting his bottle down on the table with a clatter. "Your sister obviously thinks you're the man for the job."
put us in worse situations than that, and that didn’t seem to stop you from worshiping the ground he walked on.”
After a few minutes and last-minute turns, the robotic voice of Anna’s GPS tells him that he’s reached his destination, and when Castiel peeks out the window, he can’t help but be impressed.
“No.”
sorry,” he says breathlessly, and on instinct, Dean shoves the entire piece of biscotti into his mouth before looking up at him. “I’m Castiel Novak; you must be Sam,” the man continues without taking a breath; he reaches out and shakes Dean’s hand vigorously before placing a hand on Dean’s elbow and leading him gently toward one of the tables. Dean makes a soft noise of protest around the biscotti--which is actually pretty damn good--as Castiel pulls out a chair for him, then takes a seat in one across the table.
the ones letting you tag along for free food?”
“I know it’s stupid,” Dean says before Cas can respond. “But...I dunno. Having to go to my shop and tell ‘em to cancel my pull list, not because I’m moving away or can’t afford it anymore, but because I went fucking blind.” Another humorless laugh, and Cas’ heart starts to pull down deeper into his chest.
Dean’s mouth quirks up in a little half-smile, and he shakes his head slowly. Cas finds himself zeroing in on Dean’s mouth, imagining what those lips would feel like pressed against his own, his neck, his chest, everywhere.
“What about me?”
With that, several PAs jog toward the stunned group of men, handing out creepily realistic baby dolls. Some are crying, and half the men handle them like they’re poisonous snakes. Kevin holds his baby at arm’s length, staring at it as it cries; Victor tries rocking his; Benny tucks his up against his chest, cradling it and resting its head against his shoulder like a pro. Andy stares at him, and Benny grins.
Several of the men are crowded around the big bay window looking out to the pool and patio, cursing Dean while simultaneously wishing they were in his shoes.
Cas finally looks back to Dean, who’s eager to see his reaction. “Cool, huh?”
“Maybe not, but
It’s still dark when Cas wakes up, but there’s just enough light filtering in from the street lamp outside his window and the small night light in the hallway for Cas to see Dean’s sleeping form next to him. He cranes his neck to peek over Dean at the clock--he’s still got a few minutes before the alarm goes off, and he spends that time just...looking at Dean. He looks so peaceful and relaxed in sleep, his lips slightly parted, face twitching every so often in reaction to a dream. Cas smiles and leans in, presses a soft kiss to Dean’s lips. Dean hums a contented little sigh and snuggles closer to Cas, who closes his eyes and smiles up at the ceiling, wrapping his arm around Dean’s shoulders.
you saying? How else are we supposed to find out if he's in jail without putting ourselves at risk? We don’t know he’s even there.”
“‘S on me.”
Dean raises his eyebrows, holds his hands up placatingly as Cas passes. Sam’s looking just as stunned as Dean feels, and the two of them watch as Cas continues forward without looking back.
Cas stumbles forward when he feels Hannah’s hands shove against his back; when he glances over his shoulder at her, she’s smiling, too. He makes a beeline for Dean, who’s leaning against the doorjamb now, his arms folded across his chest, feet crossed at the ankles. Joe Cool in pajamas.
“Open it,” Cas says.
“Weird?” Dean nods knowingly, turning back around and grabbing the second half of the potato to continue slicing. “Yeah, you’ll get used to it,” he says, and Cas feels glad, glad that Dean plans on keeping him around long enough for him to get used to it. He glances down at the jagged aluminum foil and smiles to himself before ripping a new piece and flattening it over the cookie sheet.
“Don’t gimme that,” Dean snaps. “I left him vulnerable, I should’ve—”
The pang of jealousy hits Cas hard and fast, and before he can stop himself, he finds himself glancing at Dean out of the corner of his eye.
“Nothin’. Just passing time waiting on you slowpokes to get up.” He tries to grin, but it’s overtaken by a yawn again as he reaches over and punches each of them on the shoulder. “Ready for today, boys?”
might not be what Dean needs. He worries his lower lip between his teeth and keeps his eyes on Dean.
He’d be lying if he said that he wasn’t trying to tamp down the disappointment deep in his gut at that thought, though.
“No, it’s not.”
“I always seem to catch you at the most inopportune times, don’t I?” he asks. He’s moving carefully, hesitantly, and Dean wonders if he walks that way everywhere he goes, or if Dean’s just special.
looking forward to seeing are blue.
After another half hour, Dean’s got five or six small fish piled on his shirt as evidence of his handiwork. He grins down at his bounty with excitement he’s trying real hard to hide as he waits for some kind of praise.
’s Facebook page is blowing up with comments and shares on his photos. Any other day, any other
good?”
“Not even close.”
“Okay.”
Cas almost drops his phone, watching helplessly as his brothers grab their things and start tromping toward the door.
“Take me right back here when we’re done. Otherwise I won’t be able to find that thing again.”
“But it also led to me getting laid more times in two weeks than I had in my entire life,” he adds with a grin. “Win some, lose some.”
Dean ignores him, hustling up a bit to catch up to Novak and nudge him with his shoulder. “Sam here got caught practicing law without a license.”
He rests his hands on Cas’ hips and tries to hide the way his spine goes straighter as he feels Cas’ thumb brush along the back of his neck, gently tugging him closer to deepen the kiss. For a split second, he’s mad at himself for not doing this—inadvertently professing his crush thanks to an edit of a reality star screaming at a cat—sooner, but everything about this just feels so goddamn
“Oh,” is all he can manage to say.
Dean opens his mouth, wants to say
Anna shakes her head and hops down from the desk. “No, Castiel, like a human. People run alongside the blind runners, letting them know if there are obstacles or other runners they need to avoid.”
“You’ll have plenty of other chances for that.”
Having four grown adults on the small, flat car makes for tight quarters, but they manage, with Sam situated at the front with Novak and Dean on the side. Not comfortable by any means, but the chance to get off his feet for a bit is more than welcome, and he runs a hand through his hair as he lets them dangle just above the rusted tracks. Breathing out a long, contented sigh, he leans back to brace himself on the wooden car, but jumps back like he’s been scalded when he feels his hand land not on the wood, but on Novak’s.
Dean waves his hand dismissively before taking another long swig of his beer. “No, fuck that. ‘Take Me Out to the Ballgame’ is for chumps.”
Hannah is still sitting at the desk, her iPhone propped up against a stack of medication binders, the box of chocolates sitting conveniently next to her elbow. She’s absorbed in whatever show she’s watching, and doesn’t register Cas's presence until he starts drumming his palms against the desktop.
“In an effort to make amends for my shitty elbows, can I show you around? Help you learn the ropes of this hellhole?”
Manuel smiles at them both, then heads back behind the bar. He digs into the mini fridge and presents them with two beers, uncapping them with an easy flick of his wrist and sliding them across the counter. “On the house,
“Exactly. We’re not exactly hurting for rankings right now, but even if we were, that’s still no reason to turn
would this be about my family?” He’s not yelling, but his voice is harsh, and Cas feels like he’s just shrunk to the size of a hobbit.
“Saw that, bitch,” he says, stretching further to rest his hand and forearm along Sam’s broad shoulders. He pulls them both closer, making it so Novak’s pressed right up against him, a hell of a bonus if Dean’s ever heard of one.
, you wanna take that class, right?” Cas nods, and Dean shakes his head sadly. “Wrong. So fucking wrong. I feel so betrayed.”
a kind of meat.”
Castiel hesitates. “I don’t usually make pie,” he says, and this just about blows Dean’s mind.
“I appreciate the support, Ollie,” he mutters.
“Mhmm.”
--but it definitely wasn't what's sitting on his lap right now.
He has his sketchbook; he
Sam’s quiet enough that Dean almost convinces himself he’s going to drop it.
“And he’s got a brother. Dean.”
“Missed you,” she says, tugging on his scarf to kiss him, not noticing the wince he’d given when she brushed a tender area near his mouth.
song, goddamn it, and he’ll sing it any way he damn well pleases. They’re right in the meat of the song, about halfway through, and Dean kicks up the volume.
“Hey, I got no problem with a little dust,” Dean says. “Just makin’ sure this is the right place, is all.” He glances at Castiel, who’s made his way to the front of their group. “So? Whaddaya say?”
Dean opens his mouth to retort, but before he can, Castiel cuts him off. “It’s clear that he loves you, and that he wants your happiness more than his own. I’ve only known him for a week, and that’s crystal clear to me, so I’m sure it’s clear to you, too.” Dean doesn’t answer, and Cas finishes his thoughts. “He wants what’s best for you, and I really think that this is it.”
Balthazar purses his lips. “Right, he’s much too old for you, isn’t he,” he muses. Cas can tell he’s running through every staff member they’ve interacted with, and he’s momentarily calmed down by the fact that he’s only been to Alchemy alone. There’s no way he’d know who Dean is; he’s safe, at least for the time being.
Cas fixes him with a look that has Dean pinned in place. “I know, Dean.” It’s simple enough, just three words, but somehow they encompass it all. They’re all Dean needs to hear to understand that Cas
Dean scoops up the chain between himself and Novak and hustles until they get to the edge of the cornfield. He’d keep going, just make a break for it, but Sam’s voice cuts through the yelling and fighting from behind them with another instruction.
it to end, but it ending means that his dance, his date, his whatever-the-fuck with this guy is done.
And, well, Cas hadn’t been expecting that. “I, you, what?”
“I’ll drink to that,” Dean says, raising his glass in a toast that Sam and Cas reciprocate. Their glasses clink together and they waste no time knocking their drinks back. Dean doesn’t stop until the thing is nearly three-quarters drained.
Technically, it’s at Dean’s discretion whether or not he wants to hold classes outside. He’s
It takes damn near a mile after they shimmy back under the fence and make a break for it for Dean’s nerves to even start to settle.
Dean Winchester.
Cas grins to himself at his college memories as he clicks over to his DVR, which is when he realizes that he’s still got 15 episodes of
Dean chuckles but waves him off, starting in on his next drink. “You’ve seen the show, you know I’ve dealt with worse.”
Sam rubs his hand against the back of his neck, leaning with one hand against the door frame in an attempt to look casual. "Why don't you just come in."
“Welcome to a special minisode of
Gabriel leans to the side and looks at Sam and Dean like he’s noticing them for the first time. He doesn’t say anything, just looks ‘em up and down. With a lack of anything better to do, Dean waves once, his head tilting along with it. Gabriel huffs out a laugh and nods.
“Christ, dude, get that stick out of your ass,” Dean mutters, leaning back against the couch and crossing his leg at the knee as they watch one of the contestants, an insurance agent named Harry Spangler, dig into Ruby, berating her for objectifying his fellow bachelors during a group date of strip dodgeball, calling her the event classless and disgraceful. “Who can blame her for wanting to see those male modeling sons of bitches in all their glory.”
Cas whirls around to face the boy instead of just his reflection, and his hands fly back to cover his nose again. “I...I’m sorry, I thought you--”
Cas takes it, hoping against hope that Dean doesn’t notice the way his hand’s trembling. Dean helps him to his feet, and Cas looks up at him once he’s upright. He hasn’t known Dean long, but it’s still unsettling to see him look anything but happy, or at the very least, amused.
The room goes silent, and Dean’s mouth quirks up in a pleased little smile as he gets to his feet. “Absolutely, you can,” he says. He holds his hand out and she takes it as they walk out toward the pool. They stop at two lounge chairs and sit down on the end of one, knees practically touching as they share the small space.
“Shit,” he breathes. “Fuck. ’m sorry, Cas, I don’t kn—”
“That’s comforting,” he mutters, walking over to Dean’s bureau. Several shirts are balled up and unceremoniously stuffed into the small drawer, and Cas starts digging through them. A souvenir from a charity walk, a faded Hard Rock Cafe shirt that’s probably older than Dean himself, a hastily screen-printed shirt for a local tattoo shop. He finally decides on an old Bruins shirt, and as he starts to pull it out, his hand brushes against something cold and metallic. He digs through the rest of the shirts and pulls out the object as discreetly as he can.
“‘A few’ is a few too many,” Charlie tells him. “Your article is rad, dude. Don’t let some trolls who want to bitch about the Colt ruin your day.” When Cas doesn’t respond, she looks at him hesitantly. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
“Even still,” Raphael says, clapping Samandriel on the back as he attempts to get the heat of Lucifer’s stare off him, “make sure you keep yourself in check, Luce. You know Alistair wants the honors, and you’ll be even worse off than Winchester if you kill him before Alistair gets his playtime in.”
Balthazar smirks and leans forward, clapping a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “I’ve got faith in you, Cassie. But the therapy office is closing up for the night; I’ve got an opening shift tomorrow.” Balthazar slowly slides out of the booth, pulling a few bills from his pocket and dropping them onto the table. He smacks his open hand against the wood again and grins at Castiel. “Just remember, though, running releases aphrodisiacs.” He waggles his eyebrows, and Castiel rolls his eyes.
“Sure, Dean.”
Dean rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah.” Taking care to avoid any sore spots, he dusts off his pants and shirt, then points an accusing finger at Cas. “You’re not going anywhere, Novak. Got it? Not to town, not back to Heyerdahl, not back to your fucking freakshow cousin. No plea deals or bargains or whatever the hell kinda deal you’re hoping you’ll get for turning us in.”
When Dean doesn’t answer, Cas feels his stomach twist uncomfortably, his cheeks going hot as he wonders if he’d overstepped his boundaries, but then Dean holds his free hand out in between the two of them, palm facing up toward Cas. Cas looks down at it for a second, then places his own hand in Dean’s. Dean is quick to entwine their fingers together, and once they are, he gives Cas’ hand a squeeze. Cas smiles down at their hands before noticing that Jack is on the move again.
They complete the turn successfully, and Dean laughs. “Two-for-two!”
The alarm starts beeping right at five, and Cas chuckles at Dean’s groan as he rolls over to face away from Cas, grabs his pillow, and buries his head underneath it.
She doesn't bother to respond.
Cas takes a bite of the fish, nodding slowly as he chews and swallows. “After earlier…” He trails off before finishing with, “I wouldn’t have expected people accused of selling others out to traitor cousins were worthy of supper.” The way he says it, like it’s the most obvious thing in the world, has Dean stopping mid-chew. He wants to just let the bite of fish fall out of his mouth and onto the ground, but instead he forces himself to swallow the damn thing and clears his throat.
He’s not the only one with this mindset; several of his fellow soldiers are making their way toward the large main tent in the middle of camp, which is where only the most important meetings and conversations happen. It’s also rarely used, which is why Cas has to do a double take when he hears several different voices yelling that that’s where the group is heading.
“Touche.” Dean holds out his hand and Cas takes it, letting their fingers entwine together. He watches as Dean brings both their hands up and turns them around slowly, as if he’s observing them on a pedestal. “So you’re sure you’re good with this? Because I’m not shovin’ you into anything you don’t want, Cas, I’ll tell you that right now.”
Castiel holds his tongue and nods tersely, trying (and probably failing) to keep the pleasant demeanor that had been drilled into his head a year and a half ago during orientation. He glances down at the desk underneath the counter and pages the manager on duty before looking up at the woman and offering her a tight smile. "He'll be with you in a moment."
Dean sucks in a long breath through his nose before slowly straightening himself, wincing as he stretches his side. Without responding to Castiel’s apology, Dean resumes a slow jog, and Castiel quickly falls into step with him.
nice in pictures, but secretly hold corpses and shit. Bring the whole family!”
“Ask me again in five minutes,” he says, and steps forward through the arched doorway and into the living room.
Dean looks at him, and Cas is able to maintain eye contact for a few seconds, but when a sliver of a grin appears on Dean’s lips, he looks away. He’s still looking away when their waitress brings their check over.
Lisa grins mischievously at him. “You’re good, Victor. There
Cas laughs. “Well, that’s good.”
Dean is typing something else, but Cas isn’t in the mood to wait; he punches in Dean’s number and calls him instead.
Chuck claps his hands together to get the attention back on him. “You’ll have to complete a series of household challenges, starting with dressing your baby,” he says, gesturing toward the changing table stations rife with doll clothes. “Then, with babies in tow—safely, of course!” He laughs, and a few of the men toss a couple of pity chuckles his way. “—you’ll unclog a drain, vacuum up a mess, search through dirty laundry for a fake wedding ring, and set the table for your romantic dinner with Lisa. Whoever can get this done first will get the chance to spend the evening on a one-on-one date with Lisa!
Part of him, a small, microscopic part way at the back of his brain that he shouldn’t even bother listening to because it’ll never fucking happen, also kind of hopes that he and Dean become close, close enough that he can ask Dean about it himself.
“C’mon, c’mon,” Benny mutters next to him. “Get out!”
“Oh, you mean for the fact that I can’t even jump over the short side of a goddamn bench?” It’s a little dramatic, sure, but Dean’s next action is to just drop to the floor, rolling onto his back to stare defeatedly up at the studio ceiling.
“But I don’t know why the hell you’d want to pass up the opportunity.” Cas and Hannah turn around to see their third co-host, Billie, enter the room. She pulls out the chair next to Cas and takes a seat, crossing her arms over her chest and studying him amusedly. “You were like a lovesick middle schooler when he was first introduced. What happened?”
on Dean fucking Winchester.
“I hate you,” Sam hisses, tugging awkwardly at his too-short shirt as they sneak through the grounds. Grabbing the shirts and caps to wear over their own clothes had been a last-minute idea, sure, but Dean feels more hidden wearing the damn things, despite Sam’s bellyaching to the contrary. “So much.”
Dean shrugs, trying to play it off as nothing, just a favor. “‘Course, man.” He chuckles. “Does this fix those shitty memories from your ex, then?”
A few minutes later, the car pulls into a circular driveway and stops in front of a mansion’s solid oak doors. A thin layer of snow coats the ground, and it's unclear if it’s natural or something created by the set designers for a special kind of romantic ambiance.
Dean sighs—and if it’s longer and more drawn out than it has to be, well, that’s not his problem. “Yeah, if we were going on a tour or to play games and shoot the shit.” He palms around the bench of the Impala until his hand lands on his copy of
“Yeah, I just…”
“You not wanting to admit it doesn’t make it any less true.”
But from the stupid fucking grin on his little brother’s face, it’s clear that he already knows.
“Rudy,
Dean pouts, and Cas is certain that if he had been standing, his boyfriend probably would’ve stomped his foot. “That’s fine,” he says suddenly, grabbing Cas’ laptop and situating it on the coffee table. He enters Cas’ password without a second thought and boots up Zoom. “I know all your hiding places.”
No matter how hard he tries to keep it burning, Cas’ anger only last for a moment or two after he leaves the tent. At first, he's indignant, wondering where Dean Winchester gets the nerve to talk to him like that, but he's quick to realize that he's Dean Winchester--he doesn’t need to have known him long to know that he'll talk like that to anyone, even Alistair.
“Okay, what do we think of this?”
Oliver mews noncommittally. He tugs his paws out of Cas’ hands and curls up in a ball on his chest, effectively calling the conversation finished.
“Yes.”
Dean chuckles, letting the silence hang heavy in the air for a few seconds before realizing that it’s his job to fill it. “Oh, uh, right. Dean.” He grins and extends his hand across the table for a shake. The second the guy’s fingers connect with his, Dean has to stop himself from sighing at the way he feels warm and sparking and
As they approach the end of the street, Castiel starts to veer to the right, leading them onto the next street in their route. As he turns, though, he suddenly finds himself in front of Dean, who stumbles over him and almost falls. Castiel’s stomach drops when he realizes that he hadn’t told Dean that a turn was coming up, and that’s why they were thrown off.
Alastair opens his mouth to retort, but a knock on the door interrupts him—the latest date card has arrived. Kevin jumps to his feet and hurries to the door, grabbing the dainty cream-colored card off the ground and walking back into the living room, waving it at his fellow bachelors like a battle flag.
Sam maneuvers himself around so that he’s facing Dean and Jess, his face frozen in surprise. “Castiel?” he asks.
“Fine, fine.” When Cas gets to the end of the tunnel, he looks up, and he can feel his eyes widen, his jaw drop open slightly in awe. He’s been to a few major league games, so he’s no stranger to stadiums, but something about Fenway is...different. It feels homey, somehow, like Cas knows every single visitor and employee there, and they know him. Players are scattered around the impeccably kept outfield grass, stretching and playing catch until the game starts. After looking around at the scene around them, his eyes are immediately drawn to the Green Monster, the monstrosity of a wall in left field.
Dean waits a few more seconds for some kind of verbal answer, but when Cas stays quiet, Dean mouths a long, drawn out “Oooookay” to himself.
“You should know that I’m allergic to pumpkins,” Cas says seriously.
“I’m not a monster, Sammy,” Dean mutters, tucking into the rest of his beer. “I like cats fine. Christ.”
“How far’s the closest jail?”
“You don’t get it.”
Cas had been so excited that
He reaches for the frame, letting his thumb run across the dark wood as he studies the picture behind the glass. Sometimes he gets teased for looking at it so often, but he can’t help it; there’s barely a day that goes by when he doesn’t at least
Someone jostles by him, and when he looks up, Dean is grinning at him. “You ready, dude?”
Dean allows Cas to keep his wrists pinned, but he nudges his nose forward against Cas’ neck. Cas takes the hint and releases Dean’s wrists before pulling him forward, struggling to keep his balance as they stumble down the hall.
” he mocked, “Since when did you get so concerned about my eating habits?”
"Ehh, party pooper!" said Dean before making a shooing motion with his hand. "Go on, go get your beauty sleep Sammy."
“Nah, this is my second cup.” Dean replied, taking an audible sip. “This should be enough to keep me goin’.”
"Heard you got your mojo back." she said happily.
“Thank you Sam.” Cas rose up from his chair. “I think I have learned quite a lot and I do believe I have a plan.”
"A oh what?" Dean questioned. He was certainly feeling more sober than he was a moment ago.
Sam chewed at his lip. “Yeah there isn’t really a cure for that.” Cas looked up in surprise. Sam continued, “I mean, you can always get on medication but not a lot of people like the way it makes them feel. I tried ‘em back when I was in college. Wasn’t a fan.”
"Why do you ask?" Castiel wondered out loud.
Cas couldn’t take it any longer and all his air came out in a rush. “I’m sorry, Dean! I’m sorry! I just don’t think this is working.” He looked to Dean, his vision starting to blur once again.
“Hey Cas,” said Sam, pulling out his earbuds and exiting out of the music app on his phone. “Whatcha doin?”
"Oh yeah, how do you "accidentally" look up Supernatural fanfiction?" Dean was beginning to get frustrated. He's seen the type of things that 'fans' have come up with. Hell, he had just been a part of that musical that girl Marie did.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed with a laugh. “Yeah, you’re right. Sure! Lemme just freshen up and I’ll meet you in the gym?” Castiel nodded in agreement before watching Dean leave.
So for the next several chapters, Cas did his best to speed through them. He took in the information but did not allow himself the time to react to anything. He skimmed through the parts the mentioned his memories returning and when Dean had revealed that he kept his trenchcoat. After that, he had immediately relieved Sam of the mental burden which he had caused. He smiled fondly when he read about Meg volunteering to watch over him.
Charlie burst out laughing and the angel felt his mouth twitch with the desire to join her, though he did not understand why what he said was humorous.
Cas sat alone in the library the next morning. He had set out to check the shelves in hopes of finding a book on panic attacks. He needed to learn more. Why they happen and how to stop them. He knew he couldn’t go another moment without knowing how to take this pain away from Dean now knowing first hand how severely debilitating it can be. Unfortunately, it seemed as though the Men of Letters and their vast amounts of research held little to nothing to do with the
Charlie nodded with resolution. "It never is, is it?"
Heartbroken.
"There's gotta be something in here. Somewhere." he said to himself, yanking open the empty dresser drawers. He got down to his hands and knees and poked his head underneath his bed. Nothing. Cas stood again, his heart pounding even heavier than before. He could start to feel the sting in his eyes as the tears began to blur his vision.
Cas looked down at the space between them. “I… I was trying to fall asleep.” He explained, his voice just above a whisper. “Then, out of nowhere, my heart started beating rapidly. I could feel it throughout my entire body. And it became harder to breathe.”
"I don't know! I think there might be a hex bag in here or something. I can't breathe! And- and my chest feels tight." Cas placed his trembling right hand over his heart and stepped closer to Dean, his face full of fear. "And my heart! It's so loud!"
"Unfortunately, it's not that simple." The frustration and disappointment was clear in his voice.
Castiel simply closed his eyes once more. Of course he trusted Dean. He trusted Dean more than he trusted anyone he’s ever known. Satisfied with Cas’s compliance, Dean continued.
Again, Castiel obeyed. His world had narrowed down to the synthetic pulse of his hand that Dean created for him. Soon, his heartbeat had synced with it and a sense of calm washed over him. “Wow.” he whispered. “It worked.” He looked at Dean. He saved him… again.
Cas placed himself in the seat across from Dean and they shared a few moments of comfortable silence until Dean spoke up again. “So, uh, how did you sleep last night?” He asked, his eyes focused on the half empty cup in front of him. “You know, after everything.” Dean brought the coffee to his lips again.
When Cas walked into the kitchen he was surprised to see Dean already sitting at the table, his hands wrapped around a fresh cup of coffee.
Dean sighed and placed his gun on the dresser. “Sit down.”
Excited, Charlie playfully punched Castiels' upper arm. "Did we just become best friends?" she asked, her face beaming.
“I, uh,” Cas hesitated. He didn’t know how much he should disclose to Sam about what he and Dean went through the previous night. Dean seemed as though he wasn’t too keen on sharing his struggles, not even with Sam. “I believe that I may have experienced one last night.” he admitted.
“Uh, huh…” Sam muttered, his focus fully on the computer screen.
"So..." Charlie said simply to fill the silence that now filled the room as she picked at the label on her beer bottle.
Cas does. Dean picked up the comforter and tossed it across the bed and waited. Cas made his way back onto his bed, sitting on top of the now semi made blankets with his back against the pillows. He crossed his legs and placed his hands flat on his knees.
“Good morning.” Cas responded, taking in Dean’s appearance. Cas had always noticed when Dean seemed tired. His posture was low, the dark circles under his eyes were ever present but somehow, now knowing what caused his lack of sleep, Castiel’s heart ached a bit harder.
"Um," Cas started nervously. He turned to face Dean. "It was Hannah," he explained, "she managed to get the location of the remainder of my grace out of Metatron."
Instead he asked, "What did you mean when you said you 'googled' yourself?"
“Uh, yes. Thank you.” Cas said, taking in Deans sudden nervous mannerisms.
Cas pointed at the screen, "Is that the 'fanfiction' you were talking about?"
He threw off his covers in frustration before leaning over to turn on his bedside lamp. He let outs a heavy sigh and dug the palms of his hands into his closed eyes.
Castiel nodded, even more seriously than before. Charlie smiled at him before saying goodnight once again and leaving to head off to bed.
"Oh, here." she said, grabbing the power cord from her bag and plugging it in to the outlet closest to Cas. "I have a feeling you'll probably be reading that all night since you don't sleep and I don't want it to die on you."
"Okay..." Dean said as he worked through the possibilities. "What makes you think this is a prophet and not some super stalker that we should be worried about?"
Cas was wearing blue-green flannel pajama bottoms with a matching soft, blue t-shirt. Dean picked up a few pairs the moment he found out Cas was human again which meant he’d need to sleep. This combination was actually Dean’s favorite.
"A03. It means ‘archive of our own.’ It's a website... for... fanfiction." Charlie explained. She looked up sheepishly, a guilty smile on her face.
“Sit. Please.” He said. “Let me repay you for last night.” His eyes were soft as he spoke.
Cas's face was still pinched with confusion and concern. He wanted desperately to ask her what Dean said in the confessional booth but was immediately flooded with guilt for even briefly thinking of betraying Deans trust.
He began to fill ill, even more guilt consumed him as he learned the details of Sam's suffering. He had to take several calming breaths before continuing to the next part of the chapter.
"I'm sorry Dean." she repeated.
Cas held back a smile. "Rough morning?" he asked, his tone teasing.
Castiel shook his head in silent disbelief. He always knew Dean was strong, stronger than any man, or angel, or any creature that he had ever met. However, getting this unique look into the hunters mind during a time in which Castiel could not be there for him, gave him a new found burst of admiration accompanied by overwhelming sadness when he remembered their current situation.
“I’m smiling because we are getting them all back. I am getting Eileen back.
“They’re physically fine. Dean is crying though, because of you. He was shouting about not being able to tell you something. Sam is drunk. We were… talking, but then I got a strange feeling… And then I just… appeared here. What are all those beings?” — he asked.
“Alright, alright, if you really want it…” — Eileen lightly punched him in the stomach in return. — “I’m just joking, whatever Charlie likes we’ll probably like, too.”
Suddenly the boy clutched his head and fell to his knees.
“It will be noon soon, Huckleberry” — Dean answered and immediately got a pillow thrown to his face.
Jack smiled, and his smile looked more human than ever.
“Hey!” — he yelled. — “Anyone there? Empty? Billie?”
Dean stepped back, he was out of breath, and another breath was not coming.
“If you can do it, please…” — his voice broke. He could barely breathe. — “Please… bring him back.”
“Even God gets reaped.” — Dean said and kept smiling wryly while Chuck was dying. Sam expected it to look like an angel dying, a lightshow or something even worse, but Chuck died as a human. He stopped breathing, his mouth fell open, and his eyes went still. God was dead.
Charlie seemed apprehensive. "I mean, sure but you should know that there's some heavy stuff in here." She seemed to catch herself, "I mean, of course you'd know! You lived it! Just..." Charlie sighed before pulling up the first chapter that picked up after Chuck had left off. She scooted the laptop over to the angel. "Just know that there are some details in here that might hurt you and some that Dean and Sam might not want you to know." She paused, "and some that you might not want them knowing."
“Is that why you don’t sleep as much as you should?” Cas asked, concerned.
Charlie stood and cleared the rest of the trash from the table.
His eyes flickered over to Cas who was politely looking away to allow them to share this moment.
The pair stared at each other for a moment. The air thick with the sadness they shared over the fate that awaited their mutual friend. Charlie decided change the subject in hopes of lightening the mood.
Castiel grit his teeth and shut his eyes tighter.
“Hey. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth.” he tells Cas. Cas began to pant, taking very small breaths in and letting out just as much. Dean placed his right hand over Cas’s left. “No, like this.” Dean demonstrated, bringing air through his nose, filling his lungs and releasing slowly out through his mouth. He showed the fluidity of this by lifting his left hand when he breathes in and lowering it slowly as he breathes out. Cas followed Deans lead. They breathed together like this for a minute or so before Cas spoke up again.
Dean had experienced this awful human phenomenon and so often too. “
"Nah... nah, it's cool. I trust you." Dean responded and gave her a soft smile. Castiel's eyes looked downward. He wondered what Dean could have said in the confession booth that he could trust Charlie knowing but not him.
“Yes. Though…” he thought, “not as bad as before”
“I do not believe that I have a virus but if you are concerned, I can clean your computer with a disinfectant wipe once I am done.” Cas said, refocusing his attention to the words on the screen that read
"Mornin' Cas." he said groggily, his eyes only half open. He groaned as he made himself some coffee. He set the pot on the machine and then sat in the spot across from Cas. Dean crossed his arms on top the table and dropped his head onto them.
He read as Dean was forced to push his piles of grief further and further down and how he put on a brave face in order to keep working, to finish the next job. He used Bobby's flask as an excuse to "honor his memory" thereby increasing how often he drank.
"And how did they know to post it on that website? That people would see it as 'fanfiction' or whatever!" Dean questioned angrily.
Sam read the paragraph that Cas was referring to before speaking up again. “I guess it helps because it kinda gives you the feeling of sleeping next to a person. So you feel, like… not alone, I guess.” He continued reading to himself.
"Don't read that last chapter, the one that has Dean going to confession."
“Don’t mention it.” Dean said, waving him off. Cas knew he had meant it. He thought back to his conversation with Sam.
He quickly closed the laptop and tried to appear natural but he didn't know what to do with his hands. He was still fidgeting when Dean walked into the kitchen.
Cas couldn't help but wonder if the author of these chapters had taken creative liberty with their choice of words or... He quickly turned his attention back to the screen and began reading at a much quicker pace. His heart was pounding against his chest as he desperately searched for more moments that described Dean's emotions following his sudden demise.
Dean placed his hand over his heart and wiped away a fake tear. "Charlie Bradbury, that is the nicest thing you've ever said to me." he said in a fake choked up voice. Charlie laughed and rolled her eyes.
Charlie nodded with a sad smile. Dean threw his trash away then turned to say goodnight to the pair.
“Don’t mention it.” Cas replied.
He turned over in his bed desperately willing himself to relax.
Sam had returned to the room just in time to hear Dean's question. Castiel looked to him, slightly panicked.
He smiled to himself with pride as he collected his own plate and washed away what was left of his food. Not only did he make sure Dean had a healthy breakfast but now he was about to make sure Dean got some much needed exercise as well! Cas was so excited that his plan was going so well already. He would make sure Dean was set up for the best chance of success against his internal struggles, even if he had to trick him into it.
“Mmhmm” Dean responded with a small grimace. “They could use some salt though.” He admitted, his head nodding in the direction of the cabinet. Cas shot up to go fetch the salt as Dean quickly reached into his mouth to pull out a small piece of shell.
Cas looked down at their hands, his face suddenly warm. Dean glanced down before quickly pulling back and clearing his throat. He stood abruptly.
“Dean wait! Uh,” he hesitated. Dean would be too suspicious if Cas simply asked him to go on a run like Sam or do any other type of formal exercise.
Cas gave his signature head tilt to let Dean know he didn't understand the question.
Sam sighed. “Man, I’m sorry. That’s rough. Are you okay?” he asked with concern.
Keeping his eyes down, Cas reaches for the slip of paper, but Dean slaps his hand over it, dragging it towards him before Cas can even touch it. Cas glares at him. “Come on, don’t do this.”
is,” he says quickly, “and I don’t want you to feel like you have to tell me. You don’t. But I just, I want you to know that I’m here.”
Hannah, Billie, and Charlie let out one long collective gasp, then immediately start asking Dean new questions. Will he be on the beach from the start, or show up later? What’s his strategy? Is there anyone in particular he’s hoping to see there?
. “...was it an accident?”
“Sweet, my ass. Sammy’s a pain.”
"You, too, huh?"
Dean lets out a low whistle, running a hand through his hair as he tries to narrow it down. “Ask me in five minutes,” he says, “because I’m just gonna say ‘all of it’ right now.”
“Dean!” Sam hisses, digging his elbow into Dean’s side.
Dean’s started drip-drying instead of toweling off after a shower, and as much as Cas appreciates the view, he hates the puddles Dean leaves behind even more.
! Put that down!” She lunges forward and Cas turns around to see the little boy playing with Dean’s cane. Dean’s leaning back, pushing all his weight onto his palms, seemingly without a care in the world.
This has never felt so effortless, not with anyone, and Cas can’t get enough of the way Dean seems to lean into every touch, the way that everything he does seems to be exactly what Dean had wanted. He builds on it, teasing Dean further and further with his hands and his mouth until he comes with a satisfied sigh, falling back into the bed and looking at Cas with slightly unfocused eyes.
“Pleasure. Is Dean here?”
him. Not only that, Dean likes him enough to kiss him. More than a friend. People don’t think of Cas as more than a friend. They just don’t, and the fact that this man who might as well be perfection personified
“You’re...making your brother do this,” Castiel says uncertainly.
“Nope.” Dean sets the markers down on a nearby desk and hops up onto the long sketching table running along the length of the wall. He gestures at everything behind him with a wave of his hand. “Last year’s seniors started it, but a few kids have added their own touches over time.” He taps the latest addition, a Japanese spider crab. “You have Krissy Chambers in any of your classes?”
It’s only a matter of seconds until Dean catches him doing so, peeking up over the top of his own menu. “I did some.”
,” Billie says. “Take one for the team.”
“Should we just begin?” Cas asks, and he hadn’t thought about it before, but
,’ your bruise is purple…” He trails off as Cas’ face remains blank. “You know what, never mind.”
Dean’s mouth is hot and wet and welcoming and Cas feels
right out of this fucking car.”
He sucks in a sharp breath through his teeth when the water sloshes over his feet. It’s freezing, but he’s been through worse, so he steels himself and wades in deeper, scanning for the little schools of fish he knows are lurking just under the surface. He can see ‘em, and sometimes one or two are daring enough to brush against his leg, but no matter how hard he tries, he can’t get a fucking handle on even one.
Castiel’s cheeks go pink as his mind continues to wander back to Dean, no matter how hard he tries to do otherwise. He thinks about Dean’s eyes again, and how Castiel imagines they looked in the past. They were green, that much was still clear, but he believes that at one time they probably looked like grass in the summer, bright and fresh. They’re still lively, that’s for sure; it had been pretty damn easy for Dean to express his emotions--anger, frustration, annoyance at Castiel--with a simple glare.
Balthazar is silent for a few seconds, studying Castiel over the rim of his glass before taking a swig himself and pursing his lips in consideration. “Honestly, Castiel, you need to stop worrying. Hell, when you get right down to it, it’s just running with a partner.”
if anyone finds out that I’m trying to lessen your suffering, especially when I should be doing the opposite. So I recommend that you keep your backtalk to yourself from now on, understood?”
He and Cas are on their feet, clapping and cheering as the cast members take their bows onstage, and as much as he tries to blink back those stupid goddamn tears, a couple still manage to sneak out and down his cheeks. He can feel himself shaking his head slowly in disbelief, taking a quick break from clapping to wipe away a rogue tear with the palm of his hand.
Castiel freezes, almost drops the folder. "What would you have done if I said no?"
Dean shakes his head. “Lots of booze, not much else. I was like that for a while, sleeping all day, drinking all night, would’ve gotten fired if my boss wasn’t a family friend. Sammy was actually the one who snapped me out of it.”
“Sorry,” Sam says suddenly, stepping back as if he’d been shocked. “I know some people don’t like hugs, I didn’t mean—”
the damn thing, so he does—only to jerk back at the sight of a pair of blue eyes peering down at him.
Cas manages to keep his lovesick impulses in control for the majority of dinner, but once the three brothers head off toward their respective evening escapades, Cas isn’t especially surprised—maybe a little disappointed in himself and his lack of inner strength, sure, but not
“We would have known.”
"No problem, hun." She turns to leave when Dean grabs her attention.
--” he gestures to his bruised face, “--to get my rocks off or because I want attention or think the cops are incompetent or whatever the fuck other excuse they want to throw at me. I just fill in where they leave off. I don’t want anyone else to have to deal with what Sammy and I did.”
"No problem. Goodnight!" Charlie responded. She stopped in the doorway before she turned back to Cas. "Oh and Castiel?"
"Do they feel kinda wet and cold?" Dean rephrased.
“Again.” said Dean.
"I thought you'd be shorter!" she gleefully explained before stepping past him to place the grocery bags onto the map table.
“So, are they okay?” Cas asked, his eyes wide with anticipation.
"Y-yes. My grace it's... it's been restored." Cas stammered. He shifted somewhat awkwardly but Charlie didn't know whether he was uncomfortable with the subject or just struggled with social interactions. She decided to press her luck, knowing that what she had to ask was important.
It was Dean’s turn to look away. “Yeah well,” he ran his hand over the back of his neck, “panic attacks don’t always have to have a reason. Sometimes they just happen.”
"Because," Charlie leaned in, her eyes locked on Deans, "I read the parts I'm in and they're accurate. Like scary accurate. Like the writer knew my exact thoughts and feelings."
"Charlie, Cas. Cas..." Sam trailed off as Charlie flung her arms around the angel. Castiel tensed awkwardly at the sudden display of affection. Charlie pulled back, still smiling, seemingly unbothered by the lack of reciprocation.
Charlie pulls out her phone and started scrolling. "Um, they update every two weeks or so. And I'm assuming they were fans of Chucks books before they became a prophet. They probably think they just got gifted with some awesomely detailed fic ideas." She stopped scrolling and skimmed over the last few paragraphs of the most recent chapter that was posted. "The last thing I remember reading was Dean and Sam going after some ghost nun and Dean talking to a priest in a confessional booth."
"See, this is the google search engine." she explained. Castiel leaned forward to get a better look at her screen. He recognized the search bar that he used when doing research on Sam's computer. "I'm sure you've probably looked things up using google before but instead of typing in something like vampires or werewolves, you just type in your own name."
Dean simply grunted in response to which Cas laughed at. He sat up and told Cas, "Rough mornin usually means a fun night so I ain't complainin' much." A warm smile spread across his face as he held the angels gaze.
The silence between them stretched until Cas spoke up again, giving Dean an out. “Well, thank you. For tonight.”
"Your carpal tunnel and your bullet wound are now healed." Castiel explained. Charlie smiled and placed a hand over the part of her stomach that was shot before she arrived at the bunker. "You may wanna continue wearing your wrist brace at night though."
"What?" he questioned.
"Why don't I get these to the fridge." Sam said as he picked up the bags again and made his way to the kitchen. Charlie returned her attention to the dark haired man.
Dean came bursting through the door wearing grey sweats and an old t-shirt, gun in hand. "Cas?" He looked at the former angel before taking in the sight of his room in desaray. "What's wrong? What happened?"
.” Castiel thought to himself. Rest should be relaxing and peaceful and Dean... Dean was alone.
"Hey!" Deans voice rang out from the top of the stairs, "look who decided to show." Castiel looked up to see Dean happily descending the stairs, his arms full with more grocery bags and a couple boxes of pizza.
“Do you still feel that way?” Dean asked, his tone was soothing. Cas looked up at him.
"Is that it?" she asked, confused.
Human or not, he’d be there for him. He promised.
It was moments like this where Cas was awe struck at how lucky he was to be in love with Dean Winchester.
“Mornin’” said Dean giving Cas an acknowledging head nod.
Now, as he prepares himself to read how Dean reacted to what Dean would have presumed to be his death, he realizes he has no idea what to expect. They've never really discussed what Sam and Dean did or how they felt while Cas was off believing he was the healer Emmanuel. He took a steadying breath and began to read the next chapter.
"I would assume he's dead." Cas answered. "Kevin Tran was the prophet that was next in line." He looked over to see Dean's eyes go dark and his jaw clench.
Sam slowly stood up and started gathering his trash.
Castiel couldn't help but think about how beautiful Dean was like this. His hair was in disarray, his under eyes slightly heavy from not enough sleep, all his features soft with the quiet contentment of waking up in a home that safetly housed his brother and his best friends.
Cas had been human a few times before this and had yet to enjoy the experience of falling asleep. Letting go into the nothingness of no longer having conscious thought has always terrified him. That night in the bunker, however, it was worse than it had ever been before.
"I know." he said simply. He squeezed her again before they both let go. Dean made his way to his room, leaving Charlie and Cas alone together.
Dean’s face turned a little red but he nodded. “Thanks, Cas.” He sat back down.
Sam cleared his throat and squirmed in his seat slightly. “I, uh, well I try to take care of myself. Exercising and eating right can really help.”
"Why would you do that?"
“Not too much!” Cas said, handing the salt shaker over.
He started to make his way to the kitchen just as Sam gave him another “Uh, huh…” under his breath.
” Cas wondered. From what he’s read, it seems as though people all over the world have to deal with the result of their mind convincing itself that there are reasons to panic when, in fact, there are none. That aside, Sam and Dean HAD a reason to be in a state of constant panic and yet they talk about these things as though they should be kept secret.
“Where is everybody?” — he asked, not even sure if he wanted to hear the answer. Or if he cared about the answer.
“Dean, maybe we could… Summon the Empty back? Do something?” — Sam asked very quietly. — “There must be a way…”
It was dark outside, and very quiet. No sounds, no cars passing by, no birds singing. Chuck must have started erasing the world and decided to begin with people inhabiting it.
Castiel almost told Dean when they were leaving the Purgatory. Dean’s prayer was so sincere, and it almost felt like he was confessing, that his feelings were the same. But they had no time, and Castiel still couldn’t believe that it was possible, remembering Lisa and all the women Dean was with. Also, they had to defeat God in order to survive, so he needed to step on his throat once more and stow his feelings away.
“It didn’t work the last time. I can’t… What if it doesn’t work again?” — Dean pleaded.
“Jack! You can kill him with the scythe now! You can hold him! You got new powers, believe me, so
he had in his head.
When Castiel was going to try to kill Death, at Dean’s side, again, he never gave it much thought, he was ready to die any day if he would be dying for Dean. He was ready to fight until the last breath, but, in the end, it turned out to be that in order to at least help Dean survive he had to give up instead.
And so, Dean called. Gathering all the strength he had left, he shouted like he wanted heaven and hell to hear him, like a drowning man does one last effort to try and reach the surface of the water.
The room fell silent. Nothing happened. Completely drained, Dean slid down the wall to the floor. He wasted his last speck of hope, and felt like he wasn’t himself anymore. If Chuck appeared in the room at that moment, Dean would have done anything he said to just stop it. He would have begged him for death, no, for utter destruction. Death wasn’t enough. They wouldn’t meet even in death because only the angels went to the Empty. His tears were turning to ice and he felt like he was freezing again.
for a long time, true. But his last words… What he said to me… Jack, I’m sorry. You didn’t have to sacrifice yourself from the very start, I should have been there to protect you. I should have been protecting you like… Like
He vaguely heard Sam and Jack shouting his name, running after him, but he never stopped, throwing Sam and Jack’s hands off like they were nothing more than some annoying obstacle he didn’t want to pay attention to.
“Did he tell you how he felt about you?” — Sam guessed. He looked scared.
“I love you,” — he said, but Dean said nothing, so he decided to add “All of you.” To not make Dean uncomfortable. There was no way he would share Castiel’s feelings, so it was wise to let Dean believe that they were best friends,
“I’ll have to watch you murder the world” — he told Dean, because there was no way he would try and kill Dean, even if he murdered everyone in existence. Even lying on the floor, covered in blood, Castiel never thought about himself, he was only scared for Dean.
He entered the room to see his angel sleeping like a baby. Dean didn’t know what caused this, maybe God’s death, maybe Jack or Cas’ unspoken wish, but when Cas returned from the Empty for the second time, he was still an angel, but he could sleep if he wanted, and, according to him, “food stopped tasting like molecules”. So, he became something in the middle between an angel and a human, getting the best qualities from both species. Dean quietly approached the bed and sat on its edge, feeling memory foam pressing down. He looked at Castiel and smiled. Sam told him that his smile was different ever since Cas returned.
Sam? Really? You’re grasping at straws now. This is what pathetic looks like, Dean.” — he said, turning away from Sam’s brother. Then he appeared next to Jack, grabbed the boy by the neck and lifted him in the air. Chuck took the scythe and threw it away. Sam noticed Dean slowly moving towards the scythe, but Chuck did, too.
“Dean! Where’s Cas?” — hearing this, Dean clenched his teeth. He couldn’t say it out loud. Just like he couldn’t say the most important thing in his life.
“You killed humanity. You killed my friends. You killed my family. You killed... You killed
“I’m sorry.” — they heard. Jack was back. — “You lost Mary because of me, and now you lost Castiel because of me.”
“We need to do something, Dean” — Sam’s voice was trembling and it felt like he spoke from a great distance.
Chuck dropped Dean and turned to Sam, and then saw Jack standing in the middle of the room, holding… Death’s scythe? Jack looked as surprised as Chuck and Dean, eyes wide, mouth open, just standing there. But Sam had no time to explain. He knew what they needed to do.
“It will, I promise, Dean.” — Jack simply replied. He sounded so sure, but Dean still couldn’t believe it. However, the desire to bring Cas back was so strong, that he would do anything he was told just to get the tiniest chance.
Dean looked up and saw the reflection of the light in Sam’s open red eyes. He lost Eileen, too — Dean reminded himself.
“Who fucking cares, Sam?” — Dean snapped, but his voice was quiet because all of the fight was gone from him. — “He’s still dead. Everyone is dead.
“Chuck did us all a favor by not killing them all, but
He wanted to tell Dean the moment he saw him getting out of the impala near that payphone. But Dean hugged him like he would hug his
Dean hit the wall in the place where
Sam squeezed his hands gently.
Sam rolled his eyes up jokingly and pinched Eileen’s side making her squeak.
Killing Belphegor hurt him so much, he felt like he was the one burning in his vessel, no, his body — at that point he was more human than angel. But he still thought about Dean, felt the need to protect him at all cost, so he kept going, despite all the self-hatred, despite all the pain.
It wasn’t a win. Dean was alone, on an empty Earth, and he wasn’t going to see the love of his life no matter what he did. Even dying wasn’t an option because he’d just go to heaven or hell. With God dead they weren’t able to change the way the system worked. All his friends were dead, too. He fulfilled his destiny, became the messenger of God’s destruction and even participated in it, but it was all in vain, so he felt himself submerging into icy cold water once again.
“He’s always had a boyfriend or girlfriend, Charlie,” Cas says defensively.
“Ooh, a Wellesley boy,” he says, smirking. “What’cha doin’ out so far from home?” he asks, patting Dean hard on the cheek with the plastic card. He glances down at the license once more before tossing it haphazardly over his shoulder. “Won’t be needing that anymore.”
he reminded himself. “Would you be willing to help teach me some hand to hand combat techniques?”
He made his way over to the cabinet and pulled out a mug before pouring himself what was left of the coffee. Cas turned back to Dean, “Would you like me to make some more?” he asked.
"despair", "the ones you love", "his angel".
.” Cas thought. He might not have his “angle mojo” anymore but there was no way he was going to let Dean continue this battle alone. Cas could feel himself being pulled into unconsciousness. He reluctantly let go knowing that tomorrow he’d find a way to help Dean.
He read about what he had done when he claimed to be God. He read about Dean's fear and anger and concern. He read about how when he stood in front of the portal to purgatory, attempting to purge the souls from his body and how when he begged for Dean's forgiveness, apparently he already had it.
Sam was quieter and more somber than usual, his mind clearly somewhere other than the conversation in front of him. Castiel on the other hand was livelier than ever. His eyes sparkled with amusement as he was watched Dean animatedly defend why Han Solo is the best character in all of history.
"As I was saying," Charlie started, "you're only biased to Star Wars because you and Han Solo are so similar. I swear, if I didn't know that those Supernatural books were written by a prophet, I'd think you were based on him."
Dean's eyes widened and his face turned a light shade of red. Castiel looks over at him in shock.
"You went to confession?"
"Here, I'll show you." Charlie bent down to pull her laptop from her bag. Once she turned it on, she clicked on one of the icons on the desktop that opened her internet browser.
Standing in front of her was Castiel in his traditional tan trenchcoat and blue neck tie. He gave her a shy smile and slight bow of his head before Sam spoke up from behind him.
Cas struggled to make through the next several chapters. He read about how Dean had increased his alcohol consumption, as well as his ever stunting trust issues. He learned that his actions had caused Dean to second guess who he let into his life and that his grief had clouded his judgment on more than one occasion. It took Dean being drugged by the turducken sandwich to show his true feelings, although they were cloaked in sarcasm.
"Thank you." Castiel said in his all too serious tone.
Dean swallowed nervously. "Uh y-yeah but I had to. I was working a case! The ghost was targeting people who had gone to that confession booth." He explained defensively before turning his attention back to Charlie.
"Night Cas." he said with a double pat to the angels shoulder. "Night Charlie." He pulled her in close to his body and kissed the top of her head, the same way Sam had. Charlie grabbed his arm before he had the chance to let go.
"So..." she started, "can't you just... you know... cure Dean?" Charlie could only hope that the solution to curing Dean of the mark of cain would be so easy. She could see the answer in Cas' eyes before he even spoke.
He had never meant to hurt Dean like that. He didn't even realize he had the power to.
“Not at all man! As long as you don’t give me a virus.” Sam said light heartedly before moving closer to peer at whatever Cas was looking at.
"Huh." Charlie said, her eyes shifting from left to right.
“Faster?!” Cas questioned, his eyes opening wide.
“I believe so. My body seems to be functioning properly now but,” Cas looked back to the article. “I haven’t been able to find much on how to cure it. Just more so on how to deal with them when they happen.”
“Cool.” Dean nodded. “Cool... Well I’m gonna head back to my room.” He gave a quick pat to Cas’s thigh before making his way towards the door.
"Um, what ever happened to Chuck?" she said, looking between the two men that sat in front of her.
Dean rolled his eyes and sighed. "Ugh those stupid books. I still can't believe Chuck published more after meeting us. That's just creepy, you know? I'm just glad he stopped after the whole Sammy taking Lucifer to the cage thing." Dean downed the rest of his beer before his eyes fell on Charlie's confused face.
Castiel nodded. He knew where he stood currently with Sam and Dean. They trusted him and he trusted them. He could handle reading about his past mistakes.
“Dean wait!” Cas called to him. Dean turned back just before he was out of the room, his face slightly red. “How did you know how to do that?” Cas asked quietly, nervous that he might be prying.
Cas moved forward to catch Charlies stare with his own. "How much has this author written? What was the last thing they wrote about?"
“That’s not… nevermind.” Sam shook his head and took the seat across from Cas. “So, why are you reading about panic attacks anyway?” Sam asked, downing the last of his water from his water bottle.
“Give me your hand.” Dean said, offering his right hand out, palm up. Cas slowly placed his hand in Dean’s awaiting one, his eyebrows pinching together in scepticism. “You’re going to breathe in again but this time, only breathe out when I squeeze your hand.” Dean explained, giving Cas a test squeeze. “Got it?” Cas nodded and closed his eyes. He drew in the deepest breath he could before holding it, waiting.
“Yeah, I mean, not as often as I used to.” Sam admitted. “But I still have anxiety and trouble sleeping sometimes.” His voice had gone soft just as Dean’s had when he spoke about his struggles.
After he had taken a moment to reassure himself that Dean had forgiven him and that they had moved past that particular mistake, he carried on. His next break came not too much later when he read what Sam went through when he first removed the wall protecting his memories of hell. Shame washed over him and he had to force himself keep the tears from spilling over. Still, he pressed on.
"You only say that cause you're practically the same person!" Charlie laughed before taking a sip of her beer.
"So... you're back?" Dean asked as he moved to set the pizza down. Castiel opened his arms and gestured to himself as he nodded his confirmation. "Hundred percent?" Dean pressed. Cas nodded once again with a tight smile. "How did that happen?" Dean questioned.
“Okay,” Dean ran both hands through his hair, “We can try something else. Something I’ve picked up over the years.” He suddenly looked a little nervous, like he was sharing a secret. Cas looked at him with anticipation. “Close your eyes.” Dean demanded. Cas obeyed. “Now I need you to listen to your heart. You’re going to breathe in as deep as you can and hold it. Hold it until you can feel your heart get faster.”
Sam came in through the bunker door, out of breath from his early morning run. He was about to head to the showers when he spotted the former angel bent over his laptop, his face pinched in concentration.
“So what do you do now?” he asked, “How do you,” Cas squinted at the screen, “cope?”
A couple hours and several beers and slices of pizza later, the four sat at the table inside the kitchen bunker. Charlie and Dean were in a debate that held no real heat over which was better, Star Wars or Star Trek. It was one they've had before but never managed to come to a unanimous decision on.
Charlie looked at him apologetically. "Dean I'm so sorry. I wasn't sure if it was real and I just wanted to know how much this person wrote. If I had known I never would have invaded your privacy like that."
Cas stared at the screen for a few moments suddenly feeling nervous. He wanted to read about himself and Dean and Sam, relive the good and reflect on the bad. But, he was scared that this was somehow an invasion of privacy. How was it fair that hundreds of strangers got to know their every thought and emotion but he felt guilty for wanting the same? These were his friends, their lives, their stories. He had every right to enjoy the content that he helped create.
“So,” he started, his voice much louder than it was seconds ago, “you good? Everything back to normal? Or at least our version of normal.” He smoothed out his clothing and placed his hands on his hips.
Dean's eyes flickered over to Cas and then back to Charlie. He could see she felt genuinely guilty. He reached out his hand to cover her wrist. "Hey, it's not your fault. You didn't know."
"Hey Dean," she looked up at him, "I'm always here for you, just so you know. If you ever need to talk or whatever."
Cas was dishearted to learn just how deep into his apathy Dean had spiraled. He read about how Bobby had pulled him back up, forced him to keep fighting when all Dean wanted to do was give into his hopelessness.
Dean moved his thumb over the back of Castiel’s hand. “Told ya.” he said, the smile he wore dripping into his voice.
Cas read about Dean sleeping with an Amazonian woman who ended up giving birth to his daughter immediately after. He blinked in shock as he took in this information. Why would Dean never mention her? Then, he learned that she attempted to murder him which was thwarted by Sam killing her instead.
Castiel paused here to check the time. It was nearly seven in the morning and he knew he didn't have much time before the others would wake up. He wanted to finish as much as he could before Charlie came to collect her computer.
“You, too, experience these attacks?” Cas was starting to wonder if these were more common human burdens than he had originally thought.
“How did they even convince you?” Her eyes narrow and she glances around conspiratorially. “Blackmail?”
, and it’s clear that he knows it.
Castiel furrows his brow at the question as he tries to remember when exactly he started running, an activity that’s become such a staple in his life that he can’t imagine a day without it.
Cas stops, equal parts warmth and dread growing low in his stomach at the sound. Sure enough, when he turns around, Dean’s walking toward him, sunglasses on and a towel slung over his shoulder, a small drawstring bag looped over his elbow.
“You’ve got this grin on your face,” Cas continues, zooming in on Dean’s face in the picture, even though he’s got the real thing right next to him. “You’re leaning against me, our heads are tilted together, almost touching. I don’t know. You look relaxed.”
“So let me get this straight,” Charlie says as they carry their trays to an empty table. “Dean,
Cas pauses for less than a second before answering, “‘Terrifying.’”
“Tilt your head back,” the boy says in reply, and Cas obeys without a second thought. He reaches forward and gently nudges Cas’ hands aside before pressing the napkin against Cas’ nose, and Cas twitches a little at the sudden cold.
…” he says, waving his hand vaguely.
Just a few days ago, Cas would’ve been completely content with this answer, albeit a bit annoyed at the fact that Dean had gotten his hopes up for pizza and failed to deliver. But now that he really doesn’t know where Dean is or who he’s risking his neck trying to protect, his appetite all but disappears.
“You met him, too--do
“Is nobody going to comment on the fact that he raised his little brother?” Cas asks, stunned that he’s the first one to bring it up.
And Cas does. He tells her everything, from the facial recognition to his stupidity at thinking Dean is just especially accident-prone, to the fact that those comments trashing the Colt are trashing Dean, and that he can’t just give away Dean’s identity for the sake of accolades and a probable promotion.
No matter what, Bobby had always been there. When they’d had to bury their mom on a rainy, windy day in November; when Dean had needed help on a book report and John was nowhere to be found; when John being nowhere to be found for weeks at a time led to them needing two of their three squares. He’d always been there, and there’s not much for Dean to take comfort in lately, but the fact that Bobby still is? That’s more than enough.
It’s obvious that the producers of
"I'm sorry, I—"
Breathing hard, Dean grins at the guy in front of him, who looks just as pleased. They can’t say anything to each other—fuck, it was in their contracts that they couldn’t say anything, why the hell did Dean fucking
"Me, too." Cas smiles. "Thank you for making me…not a Red Arrow virgin anymore." He taps the sticker that's still on his sweater, and Dean laughs.
Dean can’t help it; he laughs out loud. “Nah. Try, oh, I dunno--fiftieth.”
“You’re lucky this hasn’t gotten infected yet,” Cas says, ignoring Dean’s attitude. He uses his thumb to push Dean’s hair back so he can see the wound more clearly.
Cas digs into his bag until he finds his water bottle, answers to Billie’s question racing through his head and fighting for attention.
Dean stops short at that, the line he’d been drawing going jagged, but he recovers quickly. “Dunno what to tell you,” he says. “Business as usual.”
gets where Cas is coming from—this is a chance for them to be together, sure, but it’s also a chance for them to just
“All right,” Castiel says hesitantly, gripping his side of the tray. Dean reaches down to open the oven door, and they start to maneuver the tray down toward the rack. A blast of heat hits Cas in the face as they bend down in front of the oven, moving slowly to avoid dropping the tray, and for a second, Cas feels stupid. This would be so much easier if one of them did it--but if just one of them did it, he wouldn’t have an excuse to be this close to Dean.
Dean’s jerked back to the dinner table when someone snaps their fingers in front of him, and he looks up to see Gabriel leaning forward, one hand splayed on the table to steady himself and the other just an inch or two from Dean’s nose, ready to snap again. He groans and bats the thing away with a glare.
, but then decides something along the lines of
Cas holds his arm out in a classic
“I know him,” Cas insists. “He doesn’t deserve any civility. He’s just an attention whore, a player who will do anything to get in the hot girl’s pants.”
“Only to help defend those who needed it!” Sam yelps. “These folks had no other means to help themselves. I’ll be damned if I’m gonna let the county walk all over ‘em.”
“Good.” And with that Gabe, ducks out of their room and jogs down the hallway; a few seconds later, Cas can hear him banging on Balthazar’s door. “Up and at ‘em, Balthy, come on!”
Cas shrugs. “I guess. But I just have to make some new memories around it, and what better way than seeing the show for myself? He never saw it,” he says with a satisfied little glint in his eye that, well, fuck, turns Dean on more than he’d like to admit. He glances at Dean. “What about you?”
“It’s a pleasure,” she says, going along with his overly fancy tone and actions.
“Now give it to him, before I die of anticipation.”
“Then why haven’t you hauled ass outta here yet?” Dean motions to their waiter for two more beers, and finishes his off. “It was a combination of a lot of things,” he continues, “but I’d be lyin’ if I said you weren’t one of ‘em.”
“And here we’ve got the sitting room,” Gabriel says. He reaches for an oil lantern that’s balanced on a stack of newspapers and Dean’s gotta fight the urge to cringe when he lights it and sets it back down, practically setting himself up for the whole stack to go up in flames. If he’d thought that was bad, though, it’s nothing compared to what Dean comes eye-to-eye with once the room is flooded with light.
“C’mon,” he says. “Seventh inning stretch.”
When Lisa opens the door, her face brightens immediately at the sight of Dean, and she wastes no time pulling him into a hug punctuated by a long kiss.
Miracle of all miracles, Cas is able to wait until they get back to his apartment before he starts kissing Dean again.
And just like that, Dean’s perfectly tailored pants aren’t fitting as well as they did before.
He blinks like Dean’s just shaken him out of a dream, which, Dean knows from experience, he very well could’ve. That’s the thing about Cas. The guy’s not just stunning, but he’s also a little weird, stilted and awkward and overly earnest.
Dean gives him a small, tired smile before grabbing the menu again. "Y'know what this place has the best of?"
Dean makes to press his hands to Cas’ cheeks, but at the last second, he grabs Cas’ headphones and slides them down so they’re hanging around his neck. With one hand on each of the oversized earpieces, he tugs Cas toward him and leans in.
The creaking of the handlebar in the middle of the car gets louder as she approaches, and Dean watches the way she pumps the thing up and down in long, fluid motions. Her frame is slight, but she’s strong, and the car moves smoothly along the tracks. She’s practically right on top of them now, but still hasn’t reacted to them in any way, not even when Sam had started waving her down like a madman.
“Wanna see you,” he whines, canting his hips up toward Dean again, and Dean pauses. The warmth of his mouth is gone and Cas misses it immediately. He goes still, trying to place where Dean had gone, and he strains forward when he feels Dean’s lips press against his own.
“Dean, I--”
What’s
“That’s a pretty ominous way of announcing that you’ve met someone,” Cas says.
“I suppose, if you think giving someone a heart attack is funny.”
Cas’ eyes go wide at that, and she raises her hands in placation. “Just covering all the bases, dude, relax.”
The narration is timed to synchronize perfectly with Lisa opening the door to her townhouse. “Ben, honey? I’m back!”
Getting complacent: that had been their first mistake. Dulled senses make for dull decisions; they know that, they
Sam raises an eyebrow in surprise. “Lisa?”
Instead of starting up the stairs like he’d expected, though, he feels pain blossom in his nose as he slams into someone. His breath leaves him in a quick, sharp exhale as he stumbles backward, hands scrabbling for the wall behind him as he tries to find purchase.
“And can you tell what I look like from that?”
, morally speaking...it just, it gets you thinking.”
Cas works hard to tamp down the
Novak—no, sir. He doesn’t hate him, he’s more...
’ll have a field day trying to top this.”
“Not bad,” Dean says, taking in Cas’ sparse decorations and clean living space. “Just as uniform as I expected, honestly.”
Sam and Dean stare at him, then at each other. Neither of them expect a peep out of Novak in general, so for it to come now of all days, and in the form of a dispute, no less, is unexpected, to say the least.
“Thank you, Hannah,” he finally says a few moments later, after he’s figured that he’s left Winchester alone long enough.
The kitten doesn't respond, and Cas sighs. No matter how much he doesn’t want to be in the studio for this particular recording, it’s still a commitment, despite the fact that his parents and some of his more practical siblings might call it a waste of time since he doesn’t get paid.
“Probably not,” Benny agrees, “but it’d be a hell of a time, wouldn’t it?”
Cas' expression shifted to something that one could determine as fear. The more Charlie saw of the angel, the more she determined that yeah, he probably has some social anxieties.
"I think I'm gonna head to bed." Dean announced before standing up. "Charlie, please feel free to stay the night, we have plenty of room. Besides, you have to help me shut down the entire internet tomorrow so no more of our lives gets into the hands of teenage girls with a keyboards and no social life."
“Now when you feel your heartbeat speed up, let the air out as slowly as you can.” Cas breathed in deep through his nose and held it.
Dean nodded and drew in a deep breath. “I think you might be experiencing a panic attack.” he suggested.
“So it simulates human contact? And that can help stop a panic attack from happening?” Cas questioned excitedly.
Cas thought of Dean and his awful diet. He also thought about how he was only really active when running to or from some creature on a hunt. Castiel sighed. “Have you heard of a weighted blanket?” He turned the laptop towards Sam and pointed to the article. “It says here that people can use weighted blankets to help with anxiety. Why is that?”
