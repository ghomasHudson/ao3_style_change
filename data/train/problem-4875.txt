Steve is like a goddamn battering ram, and Tony knows he's close with how fast and unrelenting his speed has become and the desperate edge in his tone when he says, "More, Tony, say it again, tell me again–"
Tony stills. Thinks. After, he turns around, scoops up some water with his non-trapped hand and unceremoniously splashes it into Steve's expressionless face.
Steve keeps him in his lap, soft and limp as his orgasm has left him, while he goes over the mission reports. When he grows frustrated with the incompetence of the people under him, he fucks the emotion into Tony, who to his own future self's dismay, always keens for everything Steve gives him.
Then, there's blinding, excruciating pain from a place in his body he can't make out. He's just--floating there, wherever
When Steve sees it, he knows he isn't dreaming. Only reality has the potential to this kind of cruelty, to take and ruin without hesitation.
A response comes in the shape of Steve’s hard-on giving a noticeable twitch. Ah. Why does he have a feeling that man's going to be insatiable tonight?
Tony answers him in thought. Of course, the thing he says is, "No, no. Just looking. As you might be able to tell, there's not much else to do in this place," because this guy already sounds like someone who'd enjoy breaking that bottle over Tony's head without needing much reason to.
He's probably overthinking this. Steve shakes his head to himself and cracks the remaining eggs into the frying pan. If Tony doesn't appreciate the gesture, he'll have no problem eating one or two omelets more.
but then swallows audibly and his next breath is shaky. "I, look, I burn hot, and I usually have some things to help me… cope. Thought I'd have another week, and by then we'd have either made it to the front or kicked the bucket, but,
This time, it's Tony who is caught staring. He pretends as if he doesn't mind this happening, casual as he saunters back to the camp. Tony sits down on a log close to the fire and rubs his hands together, warming them over the heat of the flames. When he looks back at Rogers, he is met with a raised eyebrow.
When he puts the glove on, broken pieces of metal dig into his skin and flesh, but the pain is nothing compared to the feeling of pure, concentrated agony setting his every nerve-ending on fire as soon as he's fit the gauntlet snug over his hand.
he nudges Tony’s legs apart and positions himself behind, pulling Tony's rear end further up to meet his pelvis. Tony moans at the feel of the thick length against his thigh, feels the moisture of precome smeared against his skin. It’s a heady feeling, to be wanted this much, and he doesn’t think he’ll ever quite get over it.
Tony nods at the book in the man's hand. "Am I ever going to see that? If the cold doesn't get me, I'll have died of curiosity long before I get off this mountain."
and that's more than he's felt in all those past weeks that are already blurring together in his mind. He's
Steve decides to do them both a favor and complies with the request. He unceremoniously shoves Tony onto his stomach and kneels between his legs without ever slipping out all the way. Tony groans at the sudden pressure on his cock that’s now rubbing against the mattress beneath him.
The other man uncrosses his arms and heaves a long-suffering sigh, shaking his head in defeat as he does. “Fine, so I’m gonna ask questions and you’ll just answer, how about that?”
, the yellow dwarf they hold so dear that is nothing in comparison. He wishes he’d get to see it one more time, feel the heat of it on a warm summer day. He wishes for a lot of things; to take a walk in Central Park. Eat a hotdog. Go ice-skating. Smile. Drive too fast. Hear DUM-E greet him with an excited beep. Hug Rhodey. Kiss Steve again.
The sight before Anton made the Alpha freeze in his place with his hands on his pants; mortification took over him when he saw the person who was taking a dip in the water. The pale scared back was facing him, causing Anton to blink in curiosity at the scars that came in many different size and shapes, some of them Anton knew was caused by intense torture, while others left Anton confused about what kind of tool would cause it; long blond hair was gathered in the Omega's hands as the Omega ran his hand through it. Part of Anton was wondering if he could make a fast retreat without the person in the water seeing him, hoping to save his face and not be label as the unsavory predator the person swimming in the lake always labeled him as. "…You finally got out of the tree line…" The bored voice snapped him from his freezing state, causing his eyes to rise from the scarred chest, only to be caught by dark blue eyes that froze him like a predator cornering its prey; it was then that Anton realized he was the prey in this situation. "You know… I thought you were nothing but a peeping boy who entered his Alpha-hood… who knew the person who was peeping on me was the king himself." The mocking smile Anton was met with made him flush, in anger or embarrassment, Anton doesn't even know anymore.
"So, what is it, doc? Am I sick?" Tony asked Dr. Banner; in the past few days Tony felt different, he felt restless and nervous, sleeping most of the time and devouring enormous amounts of food, there were separate events too, ones that made Tony feel great discomfort. Fearing that something was wrong with him, Tony rushed to Dr. Banner hoping that the Beta will be able to help and that what Tony was suffering was nothing but a stage that will pass and not something else.
"So how was your day?" Steve said as he stood behind Tony, gazing down at the Alpha who was giving him a dopy smile while looking at him with his head lying on the backrest of the sofa, and Steve before he could stop the idiot urge, he was running his hands through Tony's hair, knowing that the Alpha was having a killer headache, as always, after staying in the lab for too long.
Entering the bedroom, Steve wince at the mess he saw, letting out a tired sigh at the upturned furniture and the clothes and products thrown all across the room; part of Steve was uncomfortable at the sight in front of him, wondering why Bucky would go to such an extent for a mere crush. Steve knew that Bucky's feelings could only be a crush due to the Alpha not going out much and the only outside interaction with an Omega he has was Steve. The Omega was sure that if Bucky went out, he would meet and fall in love with an Omega way better than Steve; an Omega free of baggage and hard decisions, and Omega who doesn't have any child to think of their future.
Tony hummed to himself, his eyes drifting back toward his baby who was sleeping soundlessly in the backseat of the car, which did nothing but caused a huge smile to take over his face and his face soften when his three years old, mumble something and snuggle into her carrier seat. Tony's smile widens as his attention returned back to the road, his mind wandering a little at the thought of returning back to the town.
“Steve, there you are!” Bucky called out happily, only to take a step back when Steve whirled on him, planning to kill every person standing in his way, and probably kill Tony too, for being so occupied with the less important thing than their son, who was in his room sniffing miserably. “Did something…?” Bucky couldn’t even finish, for he was feeling his instincts to fight of flight pick up, mostly flight, which made Bucky wonder to himself, how an Omega who was one-hundred pound soaked wet, have the ability to scare the living daylight out of anyone if he put his mind into it.
"Is that everyone or is there someone else?" Serpentine asked after she listened to the doll and the spider squeaked and hissed at each other, both of them complaining about Tony being able to disappear without them even being able to kill him. The sentiment was cute as hell, Tony most be popular and well-loved if all of his friends wanted to kill him and get rid of him, no wonder why Steve fell for him; unfortunately, Serpentine didn't have enough time to stand still as this reunion continued, she wants to return Bucky to his former glory so that she can plan her next world's crises. I mean Steve wasn't called the best strategic mind in the twenty century out of thin air, was he?
"Move the fuck away, I am his Goddammit husband!" A familiar voice snarled, making Steve raised his head fast to search from where that voice came; it was only a few seconds before Steve spotted the source of the voice and when he did, the tears he finally managed to stop were once again running down his face without stopping.
? They don't serve it unless you ask them at the bar." Tony asked letting the French roll from him in a purr, looking at Steve from his eyelashes, hoping that the man will fall for it and will leave him for a few precious minutes to gather his bearers.
It was calm, too calm; not that it mattered to the creature, for he was starting to get annoyed with the boat that dared to enter his water and disturb his calm, no one is welcomed to enter his water. Breaking the surface, the creature blinked his eyes, tilting his head to the side when he recognizes the person on the boat; the boy who dared and called him a bully.
"Oh…" Steven breathed as he rose up causing Tony who was standing near Peter looking out of the window turn to him with a lifted eyebrow, waiting for him to say something when he caught the recognition on Steven's face, which caused Steven to shuffle uncomfortably when Peter shifted his eyes to him with a hopeful glance. "It seems that you have been speaking about me." Steven mumbled which made Peter scrunch his nose in confusion. "The second star to the right is my caretaker; I'm the one underneath it, the one that disappeared…" Steven said awkwardly when he saw the realization painting Tony and Peter's faces.
Tony couldn't help but let out a small giggle when Steve picked him up from the floor and walked toward the huge bed in the middle of the room; the two were still kissing as they reached the bed, and Tony couldn't help but purr when Steve put him down and got on top of him.
"The AllFather is waiting for you." Heimdall said as he broke eye contact and start walking toward the palace with faster steps this time, which made Steven raise his eyebrow and follow the man, keeping an eye on his friends hoping they wouldn't rush toward anything in hope of exploring (Tony) or cause some trouble while they were walking around the place (Clint) or acting like a bullheaded idiot (Steve) thankfully Peggy, Natasha, and Bruce seemed to handle the rest of the Avengers and steering them away from everyone last they caused problems. "We have arrived." Heimdall said as they stopped in front of a huge palace, which made everyone's jaw fall, except for Steven, the older man saw such wonders in the New Asgard, even more, beautiful than here.
Though both Steve and Tony froze when they heard Peggy and Pepper's exclaims followed by Bucky's booming laughter; both of the adults looked at each other with a grimace. What made everything bearable to Tony though was the amused smile painting Steve's face as the star tried to dress without tripping trying to stop his giggling when he heard the other rushing to their room…
"My king! What a joyful sight it is to see you after all this time!" Tyber said in a sickly sweet voice when he saw him, bowing with his sister when Anton stood in front of them. Looking around the place Anton notice the servants and guards Tyber brought with him; Anton always wondered why Tyber brought many people to guard him if he was going to stay among friends, now Anton knew why, he was an oath breaker, and an oath breaker wasn't welcomed in any place they go.
"Are we talking about the same James who didn't show up to our engagement party and wedding, or show up to any gathering between our friends, or show up when you wanted to introduce me to your family or when we have a family dinner every month, or was he the one who to this day never called or texts or even sent a postcard, is it the same James or am I wrong?" Steve asked while raising his eyebrow, which made Tony sigh at that and leaned toward the Omega a little, making Steve tense when he saw the serious look on his husband's face.
So now, here Tony was, sitting in his private jet with cross arms, tapping the floor with his right foot as he waited for his husband to come back with the asshole who dared to destroy his beloved mansion. An ax was already in one of Tony's hands, waiting for his husband to come back with his prey so he could dissect him into small pieces and feed his meat to the sharks… Tony should have accepted Steve's proposal of taking the shark as their pet, maybe then, he could throw annoying people in the shark tank and enjoy their suffering.
Starkad gazed at the men that were forced to kneel in front of him with a dark look in his eyes; his scent spoke of rage and anger, sending terror down everyone's spine when they were able to catch his scent. Everyone was present to see the trial, and most of them were staying far away from him and the men; news had traveled fast, especially when it was known that the king's son was attacked and hurt by Hamar and his followers, everyone knows that if you touched the king's things no matter what they were, you are going to receive a harsh punishment; his people were already terrified as it is, not only was Hamar stupid enough to hurt the king's son, but he had also hurt one of his slaves. The slave part wasn't that much important, for a lot of people treated their slaves like dirt, but not everyone in the village knew about the runes decorating the Omega's arm but if they knew it will cause chaos, not only that, but it seems that a few of his people realized that the Omega was pregnant when he went into a shock, and that was another crime by itself, attacking a pregnant Omega, no matter who they were was forbidden.
"Thank you, Buck; then I will be in my room if you needed me…" Steve said, trying to give Bucky a cheerful smile and hoping it wasn't a grimace like Steve felt it was. It was pointless to get mad at Bucky when the poor man wasn't the reason for Steve's anger; it was also pointless to be angry at Tony for trying to make sure they are going to be alright after yesterday… Steve just miss Tony, he missed his husband so much, it wasn't fair that Tony was absent at the most important time of their life, it wasn't fair; Tony did tell him though, SI came before everything, but Steve didn't believe that SI will come before his own family and unborn child.
Once there Steve rushed to make coffee, knowing that caffeine helps, and hoping that it will help the brunt after he woke up from his light doze. The Omega paused a little wondering if he should make a cold or hot compress, then, in the end, he stilled on making both, hot compress, to relax the man's muscles, while the cold one to dull the pain, already knowing that the man was hurting more than Steve can imagine, considering that the Omega found him writhing on the floor.
Screams of his names rang loudly around him, not that Steve was paying them a lot of attention as his hand went to the source of his hurt and pain; when he pulled his shaky hand away, he saw it painted red, causing Steve to 'Oh' silently trying to make sense of what happened just then; that's when darkness took hold of him…
Something, someone, Steven will never know, but someone took a hold of his left arm and pulled him back causing Steven to let out a snarl, fear and distress making itself known, the thoughts of Johann finishing his son and coming after him causing the Omega's heart to drop. "Calm down, foolish queen!" A harsh voice hissed, causing Steven to growl, his mind refusing to put where he had heard that voice before, all his thoughts returning back to his missing child.
"Was it a dream?" Tony asked the empty room, hoping that the answer will show up out of nowhere and point to him how he ended up sleeping on his couch, covered in a warm fluffy blanket, while the fireplace had woods and fire burning in it, which he was sure wasn't his doing. "Is it the lake monster?" Tony asked himself this time, gazing around the place letting out a snort, a smile taking over his face as he borrowed in the blanket more, gazing at the fire with wonder in his eyes. "He doesn't sound like a bad creature…" Tony muttered to himself, one of his hands going toward his belly and caressing it, taking comfort in the fact that his baby was there with him.
Sarah shifted in her place before she turned her gaze to him, not moving him from her sight which was a little… extra to say the least. "I'm sorry." The woman finally said after a silent pause, which caused Tony to blink his eyes, trying to hide his shock from the woman. "I have to say, I review what you said… and you were right. I tried for so long to protect my family from what Peggy did that I didn't realize I was controlling my son and causing my grandson's condition to get worse… for that, and for what I said the last time we meet, I'm sorry." Sarah shifted a little, and Tony can see the discomfort on her face.
Hearing the words 'Holy Water' made Bucky shriek like his heart was pierced as he rushed toward Rogers with a towel, trying to dry the man who was gazing at Tony like the world ended before his very own eyes, which made Tony give another eye roll, especially when Bucky starts threatening him with painful death for what he did to his 'Stevie'. Tony huffed as he turned around and start walking back to the lab, ignoring the glaring and hissing he was getting from his teammates as they gazed at Tony like they were already planning his death… when Tony turned to glance at his team once more, he saw Rogers looking at the floor with a crestfallen face, but what made Tony feel guilty was when he noticed that Rogers' face and skin turn red like it was irritated due to the holy water…
Tony closed his eyes, letting out a small sigh, and opened them, but no one was there in the lab with him, that made Tony jump on his wobbly feet and look around the place but there was no sign of Steve being here. "Where did he go, JARVIS?" Tony called out in hysteria which made the AI answer immediately.
"Where… 's he?" Peter murmured as he ran his small hand over the picture, his dad looked just like him, he also had brown hair and eyes, but his skin was tan, darker than Peter's pale one, it made Peter wonder why his dad wasn't with him and his mother.
When Peter was two years old, the whole mess of Iron Man 3 took a place; it was then that Tony met Harley, the lone boy who lived with his divorced mother. Steven and the Avengers had rushed to help Tony when he called them to inform them that he was not dead, and thankfully to Steven's quick thinking and Edith, they were able to stop Killian before something unsavory happened, but not before Harley's mother ended up being killed in the whole mess, leaving the little boy orphaned with nowhere to go.
"It's okay, we're okay; we are here now…" Tony tried, but he is weak from emotion and his throat feels tight, causing Steve's jaw to tremble against Tony's temple, making Tony squeeze his arms tightly around him. "Never again." Tony's voice cracked, shaking as he swallowed the tears down. Then he lifts his face up to look at Steve, who's eyes reach to him like he's drowning; Tony took his hand, intertwining their fingers and locking them tightly together.
Steven stood up and gave Loki a small smile, eyes going distant as memories start assaulting him. "Yes, it was." Steven whispered gently, so only Loki could hear him, which made the trickster's eyes widen for a second before he nodded his head and return to his book ignoring everyone who went to talk to him, as Steven walked out of the room
Bucky stopped when he reached the edge of the webs, not going in for the fear of being stuck in the webs. Bucky-doll let out a few squeaks and squeals, which were answered not a few moments later with chirps and whistles and the sounds of skittering following the chirps. Serpentine raised her eyebrow when she noticed the shoe-size (Red?) black widow, making its way toward them.
"Tony…" Tony answered back, pressing his lips tightly as he sat up slowly, taking Morgan in his arms preparing to make a run for it if the ghost in front of him thought about doing something funny. "And I know who you are…" Tony mumbled taking in how Steve seemed to smile happily at Tony's admission… if only he knew. "What are you doing in my house?" Tony asked finally realizing that this room was in fact Morgan's room; God what a type of stupid question did Tony ask the ghost in front of him? Of course, Steve will be haunting the place that he died in.
"Yeah… that's a good idea… takeout?" Tony asked which got him hum and a kiss from Steve, causing him to purr happily at how affectionate his Alpha was being more than usual, and his usual was not allowing Tony out of his sight without hundreds of kisses.
"As much as I would love running away from here, I am actually waiting for Officer Natalia Rushman to take my statement." Tony said looking around for the redheaded female, which made Mr. Rogers wince a little.
It was a few seconds later before Steven left, which caused Tony to let out a shaky breath before he finally stood up on his legs that didn't seem to want to cooperate. After taking a calming breath, he went out of his workshop planning to follow Steven and explained everything to him calmly hoping that the man won't go batshit crazy.
"… He smelled like a family…" Peter mumbled looking at Steve with a confused look on his face. "Mommy, why did Mr. Stark smell like a family?" Peter asked which made Steve's heart skip a beat at that, clenching his fists and crossing his arms over his skinny chest, trying to calm his heart in fear of another asthma attack or worse.
Bucky-doll and the red spider squeaked and hissed at each other, both of them trying to force the other to go and open the door, the action caused Serpentine to roll her eyes; if her Stevie was here, he would have already brought his knife into play, which will convince anyone to say yes. She wondered if that was the reason Steve chose Tony, but that was a question for another time.
It had been two weeks since Steve asked Tony for the dance, two weeks of him fretting when he remembered that he doesn't even know any proper dances from this time, and Steve was sure that Tony won't appreciate the old dances that Midgard dance hundreds of years ago. Before Steve did something rash and regrets his life choices, he decided to man up and went to Peggy for help.
"It must have been the kids..." Tony said weakly which made the woman purse her lips and clenched her hands into fists, and Tony hummed as he went to the bedroom on the first floor, whoever had wreaked havoc in the rest of the cabin had not forgotten this room either. The mattress had been dragged from the bed and eviscerated, padding and metal springs trailing across the floor. The bedside table and wardrobe had been crushed. The bed frame, a sturdy double, made with thick lengths of pine, has been snapped in two across the center; it sagged in the center of the room like a broken bridge.
Tony wondered if Steve would have taken him out on another date, just the two of them with his pup being babysit by his mother who adored the pup to death, he wondered if the Alpha will take him to dance, he hadn't danced for years, he wondered if the Alpha will pull him closer to his body, and sway gently with him to the sound of music… just that thought made Tony flush and hug his baby tightly causing Goose to look at him from her perch on his pillow.
"Peter…" The boy said shyly and pointed at himself which made the man smile and nod his head. "Why 're you crying…?" Peter asked as he wiped the man's tears, which only made the man give a choked gasp and pull the pup gently to hug him. It made Peter tears up at that and his lips to wobble, but his Papa walked until he was standing beside his Mama and him, which made him sniff a little and wipe his tears, he had to show his Papa that he was strong, a hero like his Papa calls him.
You will think that after Steve gained the date he has been after for months it will mean he will calm down a little. Tony thought that he will, so Tony prepared for a few days of relaxation before he has to face the horror that was their first and last date. As soon as Tony got over the terror that Steve's room is somehow connected to his workshop and that all this time Steve could have entered his sanctuary but didn't because he respected Tony's privacy and loves him too much to do something as entering his safe haven (Which was kind of sweet, no one has ever done something like that to him; not that Tony will tell anyone that) Tony went to his comfy couch in the corner of his workshop, planning on taking a nap, or doing some light reading or maybe do some projects that don't need him to move his ass from the couch for the next few days if that was possible.
Steve breathed harshly through his nose, his hands were itching as he continued to wheel himself for what looked like an hour or so; so far Steve managed to discover that he was in Brooklyn, not far away from home, which was nothing but an uplifting thought. Looking around the place, Steve tried to find somewhere to call Tony, either by using a payphone or borrowing someone's cellphone, he just wanted to call the Alpha.
?" Steve asked the grin refuse to leave his face as he made another sharp turn at a speed that no sane person will ever reach unless they were planning on dying. Steve could still vividly remember the insane and scary face that his love done when he was done with his parents, leaving them comatose from fear and terror while pissing themselves before deciding that he got bored and left the villa.
"OK, Mr.…" The woman looked at him making the teen flush in embarrassment and mumbles his name to the lady, making her hum and look through her computer once again. "My name is Peggy Carter-Barnes, but you can call me Mrs. Carter." The woman said after she throws him another glance and returned to her work, only to frown after five minutes and swallow, throwing him glances now and then as her eyes returned to the computer. "OK, Mr. Carbonell, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that yes, there is a house available, a mile north from here outside of the town, a beautiful two-story lake house, with its own boathouse, and a few acres of lands, with a cheap price too." Mrs. Carter said making Tony's heart flutter with happiness at that, the chance to start all over again. "The bad news, the place is abandoned, meaning you have your work cut for you repairing the place, but don't worry, I will have my husband handle it, you just have to wait for a few months before the house is complete." Peggy said as she showed Tony the pictures of the house, making Tony's eyes widen at the rooms and furniture, and Tony nearly shouted out 'No' at the woman, after all, he won't waste his chance, even if the house was nothing but a box of scraps, Tony will buy it and modify it to his heart content.
"No, Ma'am the universe I am from doesn't have an A/B/O dynamic, so technically I am not a Beta, just a normal human." Steven answered the woman's question, which made everyone's eyes widen at that, and a thousand more question was asked. Now if Steven was any lesser man, he would have whimpered in fear and run away like his life depended on it, which it does at this point, but Steven just smiled and waved… well, more like grimaced and waved Peggy's concerns as she looked at him then returned her gaze to the crowd, hoping to spot any suspicious person that could have been one of Hydra, Natasha and Clint not far behind, disguising as reporters and sitting with the rest asking questions with the others.
"Friend Steven... uh, right…?" Thor asked which made Steve turn toward the thunder God and give him a small confused smile, did Thor died after Steve? Steve wasn't sure, but if he remembered right Thor's sister was the God who ruled the dead. "What business you have in this realm, my friend?" Thor asked as he took a step toward Steve but stopped not knowing if he should advance or stop where he was.
"They are…" Tony agreed with Howard as he gave him his mug, causing Howard to smile after he took a sip; black, two spoonfuls of sugar, his son always knew the kind of coffee he liked. "Steve was the one who pesters me about getting in contact with you; he said some really important points that I seemed to forget, or didn't think of. He is a good man, and his son is a good boy; I'm happy being a part of their family." Howard hummed to himself, his eyes not leaving Tony, whose face had a big smile, Howard could only study his son, hoping against hope that he won't make a mistake this time, that if he took everything calmly and heard Tony first everything will be fine.
"That I did not, you were just slow, right Peter?" Steve asked when he turned to the pup and Peggy who was standing in the gym with a smile of her face, Tony turned his face to the pup and had to smile as he saw the pup's face is one of awe, as he looks at Tony and Steve with wide eyes.
Tony wondered if that meant he needs to push Carol away to access the station and search the entire police station to find Fury, which thinking about that sounded too tiresome and risky, especially with Morgan nesting and snorting in his arms. "This way…" Carol ended up saying after a few minutes of looking at Tony like he lost his mind, which was rude if Tony was honest with himself.
Everyone! As you all know I had participated in a spooky dark challenge that will take a place this month!
"Why are you always telling me this at the last minute, Tony? You said James will show up three days from now so I can have enough time to arrange things, and now you won't even be here when he shows up…" Steve sighed already making a mental list of all things he needed to do before James showed up, knowing that this wasn't the first time the Alpha did something like that nor would it be the last, so that meant the Omega has to manage without his Alpha being here when his brother shows up.
"What happened? I was only told the basics about what took place an hour ago." The Alpha said rocking the pup gentle which made the Omega's eyes soften a little.
Tony laid in bed as he gazed at the ceiling, a dark frown on his face as he tried to make sense of why he was suddenly awake at (Gazing at the clock on the nightstand Tony frowned harshly at the green digits) 3 A.M. Part of Tony was confused; wondering why was he awake at this time of the night without any reason… maybe he needed to pee? Or maybe Steve was finally back home after a grueling night in the office… or maybe… the uneasiness caused Tony to swallow and sit on the bed.
"Don't worry about dinner, we will order a takeout and wake you up when it arrives; right now you need more rest after today's events, if not for you than for the baby." Bucky stressed, which caused Steve to hum and follow Bucky toward his room, all the while mumbling about this and that, it wasn't until he was sleeping under the cover that Steve realized…
"Don't worry, Steve, Peter will help, won't you baby?" Tony asked getting a happy cheer from Peter who then rushed toward Steve, pulling him toward the TV so that they will choose, and knowing his son, they will end up watching a Disney movie tonight. The pained groans coming from Clint and Bucky confirmed Tony's theory.
"Do I have something on my face?" Tony snapped gently as he put the pies on the kitchen counter with the rest of the dishes turning to Bucky Barnes who jump back from the angry Omega that was narrowing his eyes.
"It had been six years Tony, you deserve some happiness too." That made Tony goes quiet not knowing what to say, though he was saved from answering by the phone ringing.
It had been a month since he starts seeing Dr. Ross, and it was a draining month for him, because he was forced to reveal everything that happened to him when he was in Obadiah's clutches, and what he hated the most that the Omega was always a mess when that happened. But to be honest, as much as Tony hated the idea of going to the therapy, he realizes that it worked, even if it was a slow process that bore him to death, but he realized it worked a little, he no longer feel the urge to flee or fight when he sees a strange Alpha for the first time, and the breathing exercise that Dr. Ross advised him to do, did work when he had a panic attack. And let's not forget about the boxing/judo/karate/other-forms-of-fighting lessons that Steve took upon himself to teach Tony, as much as Tony hated losing to the Alpha, but day after day he noticed that he was anticipating their lessons together, letting out some steam and learn how to protect himself and his little pup… it didn't hurt that Rogers was handsome…
Steve's face light at that and turn to Bucky. "May, Peter, this is Bucky, Bucky Barnes, the Alpha I told you, about," Steve said which made the woman jaw to fell a little and for her face to lighten up in disbelieve and happiness, as for the pup he looked at Bucky with wide eyes letting go of Steve and walking to stand in front of Bucky like he couldn't believe his eyes…
"His office… he came from the S.I. to take something or stay? I don't really know…" Bucky grumbled, returning back to his own book, muttering something under his breath that was too low for Steve to hear but it made Steve concern at the dark look in Bucky's eyes and how the Alpha held his book tightly. Steve promised himself that he was going to talk with Bucky later, he just need to catch Tony first before his husband make a run for it, and then Steve wouldn't see him until it was dark again.
"I am a genius, billionaire, philanthropist, Captain; you can't beat me when everything special about you came out of a bottle." Tony said which made the Alpha look at the Omega with mouth opened with shock, which made the pup giggle and squirms out of his father's grasp to hide behind the Omega.
"Well, yes, of course, his name is J you know like 'Men in Black'? Wait do you even understand that reference because if you don't we can totally watch the movies-" Tony was cut from his rambling by the look Steven was throwing him. 'I know you are talking shit and you thought I didn't hear It.' which actually made Tony gulp as a shiver run down his spine.
Tony Stark was nothing if not prepared, that's why when a fucking meteor out of nowhere fill on him from the sky after Wanda did something spooky with her hands and disappearing in a swirl of red clouds, he was sure as hell going to scream bloody murder to his heart content. Because not a minute after they won and Hydra ran away, something (A Meteor if you can believe, that came out of nowhere, and not even his Ai was able to detect it!) slammed into Tony and just when he thought that he was going to be slammed face-first into the ground, he was dragged with the meteor by a force-field, making Tony scream like a five years old girl who found a spider in her hair.
Just like Tony predicts, he was going to regret turning Steve back to the Addams way, and he did regret it, big time. Steve now, is more persistent than ever; and that was a nightmare that keeps one and one, especially after him waking up from sleep one night to see that he covered in red and many roses' steams and dead petals surrounding him… he still refuses to remember that awful day, nor did he search what that red substance was… Other than Steve causing him a heart attack and make him curse the day his heart decided to sympathy with him; Steve was a lot nicer and considerate than he was before, if Tony told him to quit something that will destroy his mansion more than it already was, the man will listen. Even if it meant that he will go out and do it in the gardens and getting half of his land burned; but what can Tony say, beggars, can't be choosers.
Tony hummed to himself happily as he parked in the tower's underground parking lot, collecting his suitcase and then pause when he saw a colorful book in the backseat, that made Tony shake his head and smile a little pulling the comic book toward him and start flipping through the pages smiling when he saw that it was a Spider-Man comic, already knowing that it was Peter who forgot it in his car.
So with that Tony walked around the place, awing at the glassy surface he was walking on, it was probably the reason why his slid was smooth. Suddenly, Tony's eyes widen and his jaw dropped, was it possible… yup, he was inside the hole that the fucking meteor who hit him made! That made Tony walk faster toward the center, already planning to find that meteor and give it a kick or two before sitting on top of it until Shield or his aunt find him, whoever finds him first though his bets were on his scary aunt and her terrifying husband.
"My baby…" Maria sobbed as she reached Tony, holding him tightly but gently, Tony, on the other hand, hide his face in his mother's neck taking in her sugary sweet scent, sobs start raking his body as he took hold of his mother, refusing to let her go.
"Yeah, sorry about that, but you see, your crazy A.I. locked us in the workshops so…" Tony started giggling nervously, the noise made Steven zero on him with narrow eyes and tilted head a puzzled look pasting on his face, a movement that made Tony blink his eyes but soldier on, avoiding the fact that he just saw Steven kill more than a thousand people in the past three hours.
"If you were listening well, foolish brother of mine, you would have seen that this is not." Loki snarled, the smirk wiped from his face replaced with a dark look as he gazed at his brother for a few more seconds before turning to look at Tony, who was holding into Steve tightly afraid of letting him go least he was a mirage that would disappear. "I made a deal with Queen Hela of Hel, she agreed on releasing the Ancient One's soul, in for a price I will not disclose," Loki said, huffing and raising his nose at Thor who seemed to calm down and for his face to turn from that of angry person to a hopeful one. "The one you see in front of you is your Steve, the only thing that is different about him is that he is a full adult human with no magic or divine powers or immortality, considering that his original body was destroyed a year ago." Loki's words caused more tears to trickle down Tony's face, and he turned his sight to Steve only to see the hopeful and joyous look on the former star's face. "Have I paid my debts?" Loki's questioned was targeting Steve, Steve whose lips were wobbling as he tried to stop himself from sobbing; Steve seemed to only manage to give a nod, probably too worked up to say anything without him crying.
"Steve, you two don't know what you are throwing yourselves in; raising Peter is not like raising Harley." Betty tried to reason, but seeing the stubborn look on Tony and Steve's, Betty couldn't help but curse and glare at the two of them. "You are newlyweds; do you even know what that means? It means that you two have years to live before start thinking about children; if you are that desperate for a child then think about having them not adopting. Harley needs a stable home, not being adopted and then brought back into the clinic because you two couldn't handle him, this will break him." Betty stated in the last offer to stop Steve and Tony from making a mistake.
. "I wanted… I wanted to give something special to my husband, so I... I gave a little piece of my Shield to my friend, she knew how to handle Vibranium, and she made those rings… I still remember my husband's face when he realizes what I did…" Steve gives a little laugh remembering the shocked, happy, sad, look on his husband's face when he saw Steve with the rings in his hand, and the parts of his Shield in other.
Steven continued to glare at the king, hoping that he will burn with the power of his harsh look, but the king was uncaring, he just dragged Steven like he was a lamb lead for slaughter when the boats came in sight, Steven's eyes widen a little at the sight of them, it has been years upon years since he last saw a boat made by his people's hands, and it brought longing, an emotion he felt for more than a decade now.
"Pack? Why do you need to pack, honey?" Tony asked, pulling Harley gently in his arms, causing the boy to shake and let out a pained whine. "Who told you this, sweetie? Please tell me…" Tony cooed gently to the boy causing him to whine once more.
"Very well, Sir, Edward take that man away." Miss Rushman snapped at her partner as she pointed at the Beta that was trying to run, which made the Omega sighs in relief and hold into the pup, adjusting his grip on him, to the side so he can carry him comfortably then she turns to Tony who was cooing to the pup wiping his tears away. "If you don't mind, Sir, I would like to take your statement at the station." Miss Rushman said which made the Omega look at her and nod his head following her toward her car.
"Peter… what happened to your clothes?" Tony asked, leaning on the back of the couch and looking down on Peter with a mysterious smile on his face, causing Peter to shift at the sight of that smile. "You know that Grandpa Howard and Grandma Sarah are coming today don't you, sweetie?" Tony tilted his head, counting from ten to zero, any second now and Peter was going to crack, because surely, Peter would never want to be on his grandparents' bad side.
"I'm sorry…" Steve whispered as he kissed the back of Tony's neck, causing the Omega to hum at that and look forward with empty eyes, which made the Alpha press his lips tightly together, kissing Tony's cheek this time, tasting the salty tears, which dried up on Tony's face, which made the Alpha give a shaky sigh.
That made the older man chuckle quietly to himself and he entered his room going straight away to the shower, to spend the next half hour washing the mud and dirt from his skin. "Edith, open the pocket dimension." Steven said as he dried himself after getting out of the bathroom.
So sorry for the short and late chapter, but college is on the doors and I don't have that much time anymore.
"It's hard to be fond of someone who brought Ragnarok with his foolish decisions and the hate he installs in everyone important to him." Steven said coolly which made the older man grip his staff tightly and for his wife's face to pale at the thought of Ragnarok being upon them because of her husband. "If you really wanted to know who I am, then so be it. I am Steven Rogers, Captain America, leader of the Avengers, vice-commander of Shield, and earth's ambassador to the New Asgard and as Thor said I am a traveler between time and space. Now we got this out of the way, I demand to see Loki, I refuse for an innocent man to suffer more than he already did because you think that being tortured and brainwashed is not an excuse for his crime." Steven said which made the room become tense especially when Odin stood up and looked down at Steven who was glaring at the older man.
"I wouldn't have cared if you did it to me…" Steve said after a while of silence as he regains himself a little. "I… if it was me… I wouldn't care… but not Peter, not him, I can't do this to him… he is already heartbroken about Anthony Carbonell; I don't need a Tony Stark in the mix… I can't… please… just go… just go and never come back, it will be easier for Peter to think of his father as nothing but a dead phantom." Steve said letting out a pained breath as he left the two Alphas alone and headed upstairs toward his room, planning on getting his inhaler…
"Marry me." Tony asked Steve after they told their child the truth; hearing those two words that Steve longed forever since he met Anthony, the Omega couldn't help but smile happily and nod his head. The two of them married the next day, with the Parkers and Bucky being their witnesses (That didn't stop the Barnes family and Maria Stark from shrieking and threaten to kill them if they didn't have a real wedding ceremony).
Tony pressed his lips into a thin line and stood up from his bed that he was sitting on reading a book, causing Goose who was laying on the floor near Steve's folded matters that Tony prepared, to raise her head to look at Tony with swished tail, making the Omega give a small smile at that. "Can you take care of the little munchkin for me?" Tony asked/whispered as he petted the cat, which made the said cat meow and lick his hand before standing up and stretching, going over to the bed, jumping up and curling around the small pup when she found him, making Tony feel happy and lighter at that like his heart was about to burst open with happiness.
"Maybe you should tell us everything from the beginning, hopefully, it will make you feel better." Steve said which made Sam pause a little and then start word vomiting like his life depend on it, which to say the truth his sanity depends on it. Sam told them about how months ago a young Omega came to him in hope that he will able to find his son, about his parents giving his pup in close adoption, about him finding about the pup and his family, about the pup being dead with his foster father while the mother was still in coma, how he had to tell the Omega that his son was dead, and how the Omega ran away as fast as he can after that.
"You couldn't…" Steve repeated those words looking at Tony as he did that. "You couldn't?" Bucky looked nervously at Steve who was looking at Tony with a dark look as he parrots those words once again. "Just like how you couldn't tell me the truth… just how you couldn't tell your father to butt out of our life… just how you couldn't man up and tell your parents about us… just like you couldn't search for me to hear the truth out of my own fucking mouth… you couldn't, you couldn't, you couldn't!" Steve ended up screaming which made Tony shiver at that feeling two inches tall in Steve's presence. "That's always your excuse! Nothing new, the same sentence over and over again! Why the fuck did you return Tony?" Steve screamed which made Bucky look behind him and drag both Tony and Steve inside when he saw people stopping to look at the scene that Steve was causing.
Nope, not at all, you don't know how many video after video I watched that featured Steve's strengths and weakness, let's not forget the theories I read about Infinity War and Endgame, and Steve controlling the Infinity Stones is one of the theories of why the stones lashed on Thanos when he wanted to use them in the first place, as for the side effect of the time travel, I wanted to go more in-depth to what will happen years from traveling and changing the timeline, you will see if you keep reading the story that the side effect Steven fears… he fears for a reason… for further understanding what I'm saying, watch the video, 'Ten reasons Steve Rogers is stronger than you thought'…
It took a whole hour for Tony to calm down, having passed out from crying too much, Steve, on the other hand, his nerves were nearly fried, but he forced himself to let go of the Omega and open the door, sighing to himself when he saw everyone waiting outside Tony's room in their pajamas. "Peter, come here little one it's time for bed." Steve said gently to the yawning pup which made the small pup stand up from his place which was Maria's lap and walk to Steve while raising his arms up hoping to be carried which Steve did as he carried the pup and kissed his forehead before putting the pup with his mother in their bed, leaving the room he nodded to everyone.
"T… Tony…" Steve choked as he stood up; his legs wobble as he took a step toward his husband, which made Tony slip through the policeman's restraining arms and rush to Steve, pulling him into his arms, making Steve sob harder and harder at the familiar scent that surrounded him.
Confused about his feeling for Steven and Rogers; Tony bumped into Bucky who was recovering faster than anyone could have predicted. As much as Tony wanted to scream at Bucky for destroying his life, the two Omegas surprisingly get along well; it was then Tony asked Bucky how he knew he loved Rogers, and how he could tell if he really does love someone or if it was something else. Bucky was surprised and a little bit confused at the question, but he answered Tony as best as he can, detailing how he felt about Rogers and how could someone knows if he really was in love or in lust or something in between.
"Let's go…" Steve said before going to his room in Shield HQ to get ready… an hour later they were all in vans that were heading to Obadiah Stane's house or mansion as the fucker liked to brag. Steve was sitting in the van with Peggy, Natasha, Clint, and Fury. He was leaning on the van's walls behind him while wincing with his brows furrow.
Steve on the other hand put the glass of water in his hand down, smiling at Tony like he knew something Tony didn't know. "You are from the future right?" Steve asked causing Tony to look at him like he was crazy, yes, part of what the ghost said was true, but how did he know that Tony was from the future? "The last time I saw you, I saw the date, and it said 1999, cool! But are you really from the future?" Steve asked, and Tony didn't know what to do other than nodding, ignoring how his heart gave a painful pang at the bright smile Steve sent his way.
"You forget that this Tony is in love with your Steve… besides, I have lived my life with my husband, and was happy… I want Tony to be happy, and me asking him out will mean that he will have to abandon his happiness with Steve, just to be with me out of obligation." Steven said which made Peggy sigh through her nose and bite her bottom lip.
"No! Let go you heathen, no!" Steve choked out during laughter, trying desperately to slap Tony's hands away from the ticklish parts that only now he realize exist. Tony can proudly say that this was the first time Steve laughed at all, and it was because of him! Tony admits this was the first time he acted like this with Steve considering that he only acts like this with his family (Peggy, Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, and sometimes Bucky when he was in the mood) or his baby boy who loved having his attention all the time.
Howard sighed and starts massaging his forehead. "Maria, just let the boy be…" Plea Howard, taking a sip from his wine, which made Maria scowl at him. "For all I care, Tony can become a monk, just stop." Tony had to say he will give his father eight out of ten for trying to defend him.
"Oh God, please don't remind me, I had to endure Winnie pleading with me to throw the flowers in Natasha's direction, it was a nightmare, especially with her threatening Bucky with death in the same breath." Tony whined as he throws another invitation in the 'No' section. "You know I'm so tempted to just take you and Peter and run away from America, I heard that Italy is beautiful this time of the year." Tony grumbled, his pout getting bigger and bigger until his eyes finally catch something interesting.
"Who was he?" A dark growly voice questioned behind Tony, making the genius's eyes widen in shock when he noticed that the wall he was leaning on was not a wall, but was… looking behind his back slowly, Tony gulp when he noticed that it was the person he didn't want to see right now… Steve Grant Rogers in his full Winter Soldier gear. Now Tony doesn't know what he is to do when the blazing blue eyes kept gazing at him as if expecting him to utter the name in his mind so that Steve will handle the rest… and oh, does Steve know how to handle it? Death and pain, that's how!
"Please, be strong." Steve plea with his friend running toward the ambulance that contains the pup, the paramedics were hastate to let him ride with them, but the Beta from before told them to let him.
These words made the breath rush out of Tony's chest, fear and terror gripping his heart at the thought that Steve was hurt, it made Tony sit up with a rush, gazing around the place he was in; fear and confusion took over him when he saw that he was all alone in a strange place, where everywhere you looked there was nothing but white.
Maria and Steve then spent the time leading Tony to the clinic, once they were inside Tony sighed to himself and looked at Peter who was clutching his shirt tightly, making Tony give a sad smile and kiss his forehead. He never wanted his son to see this, to be forced to give his privacy because some idiot reporters/paparazzi couldn't respect others' privacy and life. The sound of the camera and the flash made Tony freeze and look up to see a reporter looking at Tony and his son with dropped jaw, it made Tony's heart drop in his stomach when he saw the reporter raise the camera to get a better picture of Peter who was whimpering and hiding his face in Tony's chest.
"Tony…" Rhodey's voice made Tony pause in his work (His work which consists of making breakfast for three hungry adults and a baby) the tone that Rhodey use already told Tony the kind of direction the conversation was going to take, but a small part of Tony was content in living in denial until proven wrong.
"Steve, why are you here?" Tony's metallic voice stated, and even with the voice modifier, Steve managed to detect the panicking tone taking hold of his lover's voice. It was a few seconds later that Tony stood in front of him, the missiles in his suit pointing at Gamora daughter of Thanos when the woman had the idea of rushing to capture Steve.
Steve didn't remember much of the car ride other than him trying to calm his sobbing baby, the pup had held into Steve hard whimpering and whining all the while refusing to let go of his mother when they reached the hospital.
The knocking on the door made Tony blink and raise his head, gazing at the door with a thoughtful look on his face before sighing and standing up, going straight to the door; if it was Rogers, then it would be a good time for Tony to apologize and explain to him that he was not his type (Even when it was a lie, cause tall blonds with blue eyes are so his type) and if it was one of his teammate planning on killing him, Tony was sure that J.A.R.V.I.S. will forget being petty with him and save his ass.
"I'm not a rebound, Steven, I can't be him." Tony told Steven, getting a soft smile in return. "I don't want you to be him, Tony, I love my husband dearly, and he will always have a place in my heart, but this, now, it's ours, and I don't want you to be anyone but yourself." Reassured by these words, the two of them finally get together, much to Peggy's delight who couldn't help but grumble. "A little bit late, don't you think?"
When Tony was in the car he tried not to growl or glare at the Alpha sitting beside him, Bucky Barnes his name was, the same Alpha that Steve left him for, Tony made sure to pour himself a drink and never look at the Alpha as much as he can. It all starts going to hell when they were ambushed, the scent of fear, pain, and death went around the place as they got shot at, what made Tony shocked was when he read Stark name on the missile before it blows.
Steve sighed tiredly as he finally shuffled to the kitchen, going to the kettle and heating some water, hoping that a cup of herbal tea would calm him down from the dark path he was heading to. Looking at the clock, Steve blinked his eyes when he saw that it was already seven PM and he wondered when Bucky would arrive so the two of them were going to talk about the pain in the ass that was Howard.
At hearing that voice Tony gave a sob making Pepper give an alarming cry at that. "H-he is alive, Pepper. He is alive, and he lied to me!" Cried Tony before Pepper could say anything.
After that, he never forget the star, he made sure to know everything there was about astronomy, he was a fan of space and future before, but because of Howard he never had that much time in studying what he loved; but after proving over and over to him, that his star is actually a lucky one, he couldn't be happier, he decided to know everything there is about his lucky star; he knew that his lucky star was an amazing neutron star, he also knew that it was a thousand of years old, and not millions, so it always made him wonder how it was faint before it even reached its 1 million years old, because neutron stars are detected with technology before reaching 1 million years old, but his lucky star in particle was so faint that no one can see or observe it even when he hacked NASA and saw the Hubble Space Telescope ducoments and pictures he couldn't catch it from how faint it was; but Tony could perfectly see it with his naked eye and a normal telescope, hell even his son later on told him he could see it, which made him the only one after  Tony, for not one of his family other than his son told him they could see it, not even Thor.
"No he didn't, I swear!" Tony hurriedly said when he saw the doubt taking over Steven's face which made fear sneak into the Omega's heart.
"Calm? Calm?!" Tony shriek as he stood up from his place, his arms tightening around Morgan who let out a whine, ready to start the waterwork and inform Tony of how unhappy she was. "You fucker! I will show you what being calm is!" Tony shouted, the book in his hand was hurled at Bucky who cursed and raised his hand to protect himself from the oncoming flying object. "Liars! The lots of you! Lairs; monsters, insane!" Tony shrieked darting around the place as he finally managed to go to the door of the playroom, crawling out of the door and getting out of the closet.
"It's either that you are an idiot or good at ignoring what I say." Steve said through gritted teeth as he hissed at Tony making the Alpha tense a little, fearing that the Omega will punch him in the face any minute now. "I told you we are over, Stark! I want nothing, absolutely nothing to do with you!" Steve nearly growled at the Alpha before huffing and massaging his forehead from the coming migraine that promised him a painful day. "What is the thing that you don't understand? Anthony Carbonell is dead, and in his place there is… you. So, please, leave me the fuck alone." Steve stressed his words hoping that they will finally make their way to Tony's thick skull.
"Yeah, he is awake for two days now, little kiddo wouldn't calm down unless he is causing troubles… sounds like someone you know, don't you think?" Tony grin, causing Steve to chuckle at the words he spoke; in truth, their Pete sounds like Tony more than Steve, the only thing that Peter inherited from Steve was that he was too smart to be caught red-handed, just like his mother.
"What the fuck are you doing here?!" Steve's harsh voice made everyone flinch, and the reporter was about to flee, but he was stopped by two Shield agents who took hold of him. Tony made sure to cover Peter's head and coo to him as he was pulled away gently by his mother's caring arms.
25-Er honum leyfilegt að hlaupa frjáls eftir það sem hann gerði? -Is he allowed to run free after what he did?
"It is not that, Tony, you just don't understand… Rogers… he could have saved Stevie, he could have… he could have saved him like he saved Morgan but he didn't, he let his nephew die… tell me would you let Morgan die if you had the powers Rogers had?" Natasha asked, trying to maybe justify what the town's people did, unaware that Tony finally knew why Rogers never welcomed anyone into his lake and house… why would someone want their jailor to come and mock or blame them while being trapped in this place.
"I… Steve… who is Tony?" Peggy asked, face confused and voice unsure, her words causing Steve to let out a choked sound, wondering if Peggy even knew about the man he was talking about. "Dear, what are you talking about? Who is Tony?" Peggy repeated her question slowly, gazing at Steve with protective stand and concern look, causing Steve to crack and tell her everything that happened since the last time he saw her, getting in her car with her pregnant mate as the two of them went to the doctor appointment, never managing to reach the doctor because of the car that crash into them, killing the two of them instantly.
" That was Bucky, who gave Tony a nod before going to Steve's car, letting Tony handle guiding Steve to his car, sitting in the backseat with Steve as he let Happy, drive them home.
So after digging deep and being thankful that Fury nor Phil weren't a Hydra agents (The former for Steven's peace of mind considering that he doesn't want to go against his friend, and the latter because of Clint's whining) Peggy and Steven made sure to inform the two of them about their plan of taking Hydra down, so now Steven and Peggy had four spies gathering information on Hydra, and one of them is Pierce's own friend.
The next day, Peter shuddered as he opened his eyes, yawning a little before he hides his head under his pillow, looking tiredly at the door one last time before the boy to curl on himself and turn his back to the door putting the pillow over his head, sniffling as he remembered last night, and how the Alpha didn't show up after he promised him... just like... The sound of the door opening made Peter pout and try to stop his wobbling lips, knowing that it was his mother, but not wanting the Omega to worry about him, especially when Peter wanted to do nothing but curl into a tight ball and cry his eyes out.
"I don't know to be honest…" Steve said after a while of silence, smiling at Jarvis who sat on the chair near the bed. "I mean, on one hand, this is my entire fault, if I just suck it up after the war if I just… didn't crash the plane this wouldn't have happened, I would have been here to stop Stane and Hydra earlier… on the other hand, my Alpha seemed attached to the pup and his mother, thinking of them as a family, chanting that I shouldn't be away from them… it's a mess." Steve sighed at that looking at the ceiling hearing Jarvis sigh.
Thinking about yesterday, made Tony bite his lower lip in deep thoughts, did Tony really wanted yesterday to be a date? Tony has to admit that he had fun yesterday, the most light and fun day he had in years, and his baby also enjoyed his day, it was the first time the small pup ever experience anything positive and good in his life, which made the smile on Tony's face widen every time he thought of it.
"I think so…" The boy said as he took Tony's hand and was pulled by the Alpha. "Whoa, you are strong, mister." The small boy said as he took off his Iron Man helmet that turned to the side when he slammed into him. Tony gazed at the small boy as the kid pulled a blue baseball cap from somewhere and put it on his bald head, the kid was pale, and his eyes were a chocolate brown color, but he looked so familiar when Tony tilted his head to the side. "You are Tony Stark!" The boy gasped as he looked at Tony the helmet in his hands forgotten.
!" That was all the warning Tony got before he was attacked by Rogers, and by attacked he meant strangled to death with the man's muscled arms as the man pulled him in his embrace and nuzzled him like his life depending on it, and from the corner of his eye, Tony saw Pepper glaring at him, which made him tense like a bow… he brainwashed Pepper…
"We were finally able to stabilize him; the thing was the stab wound wasn't the problem." Bruce let out a tired sigh as he ran his hands through his hair like he was trying to gather his thoughts. "It seemed that the blade Steve was stabbed with had some kind of poison; we didn't know about until Steve starts screaming on the operation table. The poison is not like anything I saw before, whatever poison Hydra was able to create, it was bad, it's a slow working one, which seemed to burn the host from the inside out; I took some samples to try and find the antidote for it… but I… I…" Bruce's voice vanished, not that Tony was paying that much attention, his head was already in his hands, and for once in his life Tony's mind was blank. "You should stay with him…" Bruce ended up whispering, putting his hand on Tony's shoulder, squeezing it in reassurance before walking away, probably going to the labs to try and find the antidote.
After two months of searching, Anthony finally received a letter from Steve, the Alpha's heart nearly dance in joy as he starts opening the letter, thinking that Steve will finally be back, that he finally back for Anthony. It ends with Anthony sobbing his eyes out after reading the letter, he was told many things in it, but the most important one was that Anthony was a poor excuse of an Alpha, that he was weak, that he will never achieve anything in his life acting like he is now. It ends with Anthony ripping the letter and scream and shouts and break things, it ends up with him looking at his face in the mirror and growl in hate and it ends up with him breaking the mirror with his fist and snarl.
Becky seemed to blink and a tired but happy smile graced her lips, though the pain and uncertainly in her eyes as she gave her baby and Steve a fleeting glance, probably wondering how Steve was going to react with his baby being gone and all that. "Stephen… we named him Stephen; do you wanna hold him?" Becky asked gently, tilting his arms a little to show Steve the boy who was looking at everything and anything with curious blue-grey eyes.
"Fine! Do as you want, but know this Tony if something happens to the kid it will be on you." Betty snarled, sending a harsh and disapproving look to Tony, hoping that he will back down, only to growl harshly when Tony just stood straight and met Betty's stare head-on…
"Jarvis? Is that really you?" Steven asked with caution, after all, he may have to see the butler's pictures and heard some of his stories and adventures from his Tony and Peggy, but seeing the man looking no older than thirty and staring at him was concerning, especially when the only Jarvis, Steven interact with was the AI version of him.
"I'm so sorry Tony." Clint said as he bites his lips and starts backing away slowly. "I am going to go, don't worry about Cooper and Lila, their Godmother is finally back into town and she wanted them with her today… I am really sorry." Clint said getting a nod from Tony who was humming to the pup, trying to calm the sobbing baby down, getting the wanted permission, Clint rushed out of the house leaving Tony and the pup alone.
"Steve…?" The woman asked which made Steve blink his eyes at that and tilt his head a little, wondering why the woman was so familiar and why he didn't seem to be able to remember her.
"Wait! So you are saying to me that people eat stars' hearts to become immortal, is that what you did?" Mr. Barton
It made the creature wonder and think, and he hates thinking because thinking meant remembering, and remembering meant pain and hurt; but this boy who called him a bully and he was carrying a child which made the creature think, and him hating to think, meant to hate the reason for it, which was the boy who still hasn't left the house when normally all of those who came into his land couldn't last a month in it. Anyway back to the thing he hates the most, thinking; thinking the creature did, and it came to it that the creature doesn't mind the boy staying on his land, only until the baby arrives, and then he will make sure to inform the boy that he needed to leave.
As Steve nodded, he pushed Tony on his back on the bed, and finally, Steve climbed on top of him; they kissed and touched gently, touches and kisses that become more frantic as time passed. Steve's hand curls around Tony's erection under his sleeping pants and Tony growled in pleasure, when Tony flipped them over, Steve had to hold his grin back, as Tony placed soothing kisses all over Steve.
"It's mine…" Tony said, trying not to make himself smaller than he already was at the blank stare he was at the end of, he already felt like a failure for breaking his promise to Steven, he doesn't need any reminder of how much of a failure he was.
Anger course through Steven as he walked as far as he can, trying to put as much distance between him and the foolish king who accused him of something unforgivable. Fury still took hold of Steven every time he was forced to remember that the uncultured and brute king accused him of being a prostitute just because the queen decided to be friendly with him, accepting his friendship and rewarding it with a gift. Steven should have known though, all Alphas were the same; brutes, arrogant, so full of themselves. Steven thought that the king was different, for the Alpha seemed to see that Steven was not a delicate Omega in need of protection and shelter. Steven was even hopeful that the man would be a true friend and ally against the Stone family; what a disappointment, the Alpha finally showed his true color, and on one of the happy days that Steven experienced since a long time ago.
"I don't need my sister following me to go anywhere, I am a grown-up woman," Carter stated, turning her face toward Steve, a harsh look stilling over her face as she send an icy glare to Tony. "I want to meet our son if you don't mind," Carter stated after a while, ignoring the way that Steve continued to glare at her as if ordering her to leave; Tony for his part, wanted to escape this stressful situation, but he doesn't want to leave Steve alone to deal with Carter who was mentally unstable at the best of times, so he sucked it up and waited for what his husband was going to do.
Steven can feel everyone pausing at the king's words, from the people who came to greet their family members, to those who were moving the riches and gold, all of them were gazing at the king like he has told them that he was the heir to Asgard, though the Alpha with the red hair and blue eyes shook her shock first and turned around, snapping orders which made everyone move hastily last they were punished. "Why the change of heart, my friend?" Jamti whispered in the king's ear making the Alpha purse his lips and turn his eyes toward him ignoring the Omega who was still glaring at the king.
Howard smiled with an undertone of sadness to it, the older Alpha walked toward Tony, standing in front of his son. "You have grown up…" Howard whispered, taking Tony in, disbelieve and happiness shining in Howard's eyes; the Alpha looked at Tony like he couldn't believe that the little Omega had grown up so fast when he wasn't there. "Your Mom would have wanted you to have this." Howard smile as he took a small white box from his pocket.
"Brother Stark, why do you look like you saw the flames of Hel?" Thor was the first to ask him, for he was the first person to spot him, and God, wasn’t that question a funny one? Because Tony did saw Hell, a hell he hopes with all of his heart that it won’t happen.
"Shut your mouth, you foolish old goat! What do you know of how the world works?! Be quiet, before I personally ask these barbarians to rid you of your tongue." Rage boiled Steven's insides in a way that made him dizzy, and if weren't for his child who was hidden in his arms firmly pulling him into a tight hug and the man lying beside him, he was pretty sure he would have attacked Johann instead. Steven cursed the king while glaring at his king in a way that if looks could kill, then Johann would have probably dropped dead right then. If the king noticed the act of defiance, however, he didn't pay any mind to it, turning around once more to yell again at the Vikings and demand to see their leader, considering that Steven didn't open his mouth to argue this time.
It was strange how the time passes in a blink of an eye after Anton died; he had a hard time looking at Midgard, looking away every time he passed the realm of mortals, but the few times he dared to gaze at the realm of his beloved he was baffled by them, especially by the way they started counting time in a strange way, it left him wondering why would they start counting their times from the beginning from the number 1 when they have been clearly living over 50,000 years, but mortal were strange like this, they were not like Asgardians where magic and science live together side-by-side and the history of the worlds' written in their archives.
He stumbles to his feet, his hands pushing at nothing as he tries to get away, breath refusing to leave his chest, and out of nowhere a fire flares up, painfully bright, and Tony backs away, his eyes watering and when he was able to open them he saw nothing. He spins around in the darkness, confused and disoriented. His hands won't stop shaking, his throat aches, his chest burns, he can't breathe. "Fuck!" Tony whined, rubbing at his eyes with the heel of his hand. He chokes back a sob, sucking in harsh gasps of air. His heart pounds like a hammer, every pulse sending a shockwave of pain through his chest. Nothing comes charging out of the forest towards him. Nothing wraps around his leg and drags him into the lake, he was only able to relax when his hand touched his belly and felt that the baby was still there, which made him relax even more
Grandma Addams screaming, making Steve put his head in his hands and let out a tired sigh, he was thankful that he was sitting cross legs on the floor or he was sure that his grandma's shriek would have broken the chair with how loud and high pitched it was, or maybe it would have made him fall from his chair, but whatever. The murmuring and shuffling could be heard from the crystal ball, making Steve hum and wait in anticipation, hoping that his mother was with the Addams family and not going on a vacation in the underworld.
"Yeah, Howard even said that we can use the serum you have in your body to create a cure for Peter." Tony grin when he heard the gasp coming from Steve; raising his head Tony's smile widens when he notices the hope and surprise on Steve's face. "Howard said it will be easy to create the cure for Peter because you are his mother, hopefully, the cure will be ready in two months or so." A sob left Steve, and a big smile made its way toward the Omega's face; it happened so fast, one minute Tony was holding to Steve and the next his mate was kissing him all over his face, causing Tony to give a joyful chuckle and hold tightly to his mate…
…" That's what Tony choked as he held Steve tightly, his breath shaking and his arms tightened around Steve when the Omega broke down once more and start sobbing, holding into Tony's suit jacket, babbling words that made no sense to anyone but himself, Steve's hand was still caressing his belly, the fear of losing his baby was getting irrational as what happened two hours ago kept replaying in his mind eye again and again.
It ends with Steve walking on shaky legs toward Tony's room after the doctors told him that his husband was too old, that it was his time, that Steve could go and see him for one last time, Steve had to hold his sobs at that. As much as Steve didn't want, he called Pepper and Morgan in hope that the two of them will come, Tony still considers Morgan his own, even after all the pain she and her mother caused him, it made him hate them, even more, when they didn't answer.
"This." Steve said thrusting the phone in her hand and walk around the room trying to calm himself, taking a deep breath after a deep breath. The sound of broken gasp made Steve look at Peggy who was shaking like a leaf.
"Well, that punk called me saying he is going to come home soon…" Before Bucky was able to continue he hears a deafening squeal from Winnie which made him wince and look at the woman like she was crazy, his mother ran outside of the house, shouting something about going to Sarah, Bucky grumbled to himself.
"Goodnight, Tony." His father said making Tony turn to him and nods; he waited outside with Jarvis until he saw their car leave the mansion's gates.
"Love…?" Mr. Stark looked at Steve as he put his checkbook in his right pocket and looked at the Omega with a blank look. "If I remember correctly Mr. Rogers, you are what? Nineteen and a half…? I presume I am right. Kids at your age… they change their heart like they change their shoes, you probably won't remember Anthony in a few years from now when you stop seeing him." The older Alpha said looking at Steve with a cold smile making the teen throw the man a dark look.
"Yeah, thankfully, everything sits, and Peter is finally cleaning his room so this is a plus. Oh! I already asked Bucky to buy some blueberry muffins in case the cakes Sarah brought aren't enough and-" Tony didn't manage to finish his nervous rambling, for Steve stood behind him and pulled him into his chest, holding him tightly.
The man grunt in distaste at that, taking a step back and raised his gun, making Tony pause at that and snarl. "Now, now Tony, I wouldn't do that if I was you." He said making Tony growl at that and gaze at Stan with hate. "You know all of this wouldn't have happened if you just accept being my mate… I would have treated you well." That made Tony snort.
Steve knew that stress wasn't good for both him and the baby, Steve knew he should take more care of himself for the baby in his tummy; the thing was it was hard, it was so, so hard, especially with Tony seemingly ignoring that he existed. Steve wondered for a second what would have happened if he kept his mouth shut; what would Tony do if Steve never pointed out his absence? If Steve let the older man be... if Steve just shut his mouth and let Tony do what he wanted until everything returned back to how it was.
"Guys I found him!" The raccoon called out in a snappish voice, growling at Steve who was trying to hide Peter away from the fire line, if Steve wasn't careful, Peter would get hurt, something that Steve wanted to avoid. Steve though, narrows his eyes a little, trying to remember where he saw that particular raccoon, he looked familiar somehow; the thing was, where did Steve see him?
the only reason I asked your hand in marriage was that I love and admire you!" Rogers, the bastard he was, butt in, and Tony shivered at the murderous looks he was at the end of, but when Rogers words made sense to him he froze in his place until he felt Rogers taking his right hand in his and start kissing it like no tomorrow. By then Tony shrieked and pulled his hand away, already planning to wash it with holy water lest something happened to him and he caught Rogers's germs.
"Stane made a deal with the FBI about giving them information about Hydra in exchange for giving him a life sentence in a high-security prison, and unfortunately for us, it's not with our juristic to interfere with the FBI considering that they made a deal with him after we refused to give him one." Peggy hissed and Tony was frozen in his place, he was sure that he was not even breathing, because did he heard them right? Did they just mention Stane?
And for once Steven was grateful for being able to finish his chores before Compline which gave him a lot of time to rest, humming a toneless lullaby to his son who held his pendant in his hands, blinking his eyes open every time he closed them. "Mama…" James whispered after a while making Steven hum and look at his son who was furrowing his brows. "Why can I not smell your scent anymore?" James asked in a confused voice, his words causing Steven's muscles to lock in shock, fear rising inside of him as everything made sense. "Mama?" James called out but Steven couldn't even move a muscle as the horror of what his son informed him finally sink…
"My name is Steven." The blond said, only to hear choking noises coming from Thor, and when Steven turned his gaze to him, he winces at how pale the man had become, as pale as a corpse, if it was the right phrase, Steven only blinked his eyes once before the man was bowing on his knees in front of Steven, saying his words so fast that it all mashed together to form unintelligent squeaks, causing Steven to close his eyes and massage his temples, feeling a strong headache was about to come and consume him. "Enough!" Steven snapped, which made Thor become as quiet as a mouse, causing Steven to hide his face with his hands. "This is a nightmare… this is nothing but a fucked up nightmare, I am not only stuck on this fucking plant, but I am also stuck with you! How did the son of Odin turn into an ass-kisser? Why was I not stuck with your brother? At least he knew when to shut up!" Steven mumbled those words, not caring whoever heard them, too tired to care about how Thor will take them, he was stress, he was tired, he was injured, and he was hungry (A feeling he never felt in his life, but instincts told him what it was) and he didn't need Thor's whining on top of him.
Tony knows that if he spoke to his Mom and Dad about the heat, they will do anything to insure his health and happiness, and that thought caused warmth inside Tony; what he was truly worried about was Steve's reaction to the announcement. What if he chooses to spend Tony's heat with him? What
"Son, please!" The sound was like his mother which made Thor shake and turn to the source of the sound that was behind him, the sight in front of him made him sway on his legs; his mother looked like a half-burned corpse at best, and Thor felt like he was about to pass out any minute now, when Thor's leg was pulled he let out a shriek as he looked down, only for his face to drain out of every color when he saw his brother's half-eaten face as blood trickled down his horror-struck expression
"What? Isn't that what marring an Addams is all about? You killed your husband! You could have divorced him but you didn't, so why are you acting like I just throw holy water at you?" Tony asked furrowing his brows, his ice cream went forgotten as he gazed at the ghost who looked like Tony just told her that everything outside is sunshine and rainbow and that there are no wars and evils in the world.
The days that followed his arrival were no better than the first day; first of all, Anton was still annoying as always, thankfully being annoying was one of the reasons that Steven finally start calling him by his name, because for one Anton was never this annoying, for another Tony became more annoying when he called him Anton. Secondly, we have the scary couple that Steven finally received their full names, Peggy Carter Barnes, who stresses on the
Steve's sharp voice made Tony tense and rush toward Steve with a shout, he could feel aunt Peggy and Peter's gaze on him as he rushed toward the soldier and raised his fist to strike, the soldier sensing his intentions, went to grape his fist and flip him over, but Tony was fast and he twisted out of the soldier's reach, and sent a kick to the back of Steve's right knee, hoping to make the Alpha lose his balance and fall down, but the Alpha seemed to know that this was his plan from the start because he gave Tony a smirk before he jumped out of Tony's reach and rushed toward him with his fist raised high, that made Tony gulp and trying to avoid Steve, but he was already late, the soldier opened his fist and took hold of him, and flipped him over his head, which made Tony squeak as soon as his back hit the matted floor of the boxing ring.
Tony was stress, so stressed that he knows if he didn't find anything to take the stress out, he will commit a murder; as hard as that sounded, Tony was prepared to kill everyone in the room with him and then kill himself, just to get rid of the stress that kept on increasing because of a certain Addams who doesn't know when to stop or what the word No meant.
A small part of Steven wondered what would have happened if the Iron king lost that battle, just that one battle against the Hydra king; just that one… just that one so that Steven will still hold his babe in his arms, raising him beside James and tell him how much he loved him and cherish him. the total time Steven spent with his babe before he had to give him up was one hour, one hour that wasn't enough for Steven to think of a strong name for him in his mother language.
It took only a few glares at Jarvis before Tony was in his suit and off to the tower, planning on pleading with Pepper to do something! Or maybe just give him the keys to his Malibu house so he will leave this place forever, if only the woman wasn't buddy-buddy with Coulson then maybe Tony's pleas would have worked, but as fate would have it the two of them had this strange friendship that no matter how much Tony disapproved, the woman won't listen to him and break the friendship she has with the man which made Tony pout like no tomorrow.
That thought made Tony pause and blink his eyes, it made him hum as he returned and snuggle in his bed pulling his baby toward his chest, making the pup give a cute snort and bring his thump to his mouth intending to suck on it, but Tony chuckles as he pulled the baby's hand away kissing his forehead.
"No, we broke up after Barnes got back… I don't think it's important that Rogers should be informed; he made sure to tell me he wants nothing to do with me." The last part Tony said to himself in a low voice, but nevertheless, Steven heard it and he let out a low noise that made the hair on Tony's body to stand on its ends.
After Steve was done paying the barber, he took Bucky to a homey hole in the wall restaurant, where the two of them could relax, the two of them spent the dinner joking and exchanging stories; Steve was so happy that Bucky opened up to him, the Alpha was shy, shyer than any Alpha Steve saw in his life, it was endearing. Bucky was so different from his brother, while Tony thrives in the spotlights, Bucky prefer the calm and quiet, it really made Steve warm on the inside that he was able to take Bucky out and show him around Manhattan. Poor Alpha, spending nearly twelve years of his life in the military and only now he returned home, of course, he will be unbalanced and confused by everything, Steve still couldn't get over how he and Tony didn't notice that his brother was suffering all alone.
"Only an uncultured fool will say something like that!" James huffed, his words causing Anton to lose it and laugh because he was sure that the queen said something like that to him a few days ago, Anton was glad to know that James could hold his own when it comes to it.
After The Avengers, after Shield, Hydra, The Winter Soldier, Ultron, Civil War, after Thanos… things changed, and finally after so many years of heartaches and pain, after so many years of crying and betrayals… everything was finally looking up…
"Thanks, I'm going to go… I have an urgent job to do." Steve said nodding to Howard and Peggy and hurried up to leave, as soon as he closes the door, the shouting return making Steve close his eyes and grind his teeth as he heard that cursed melody again…
Tony was a failure parent for letting his girl suffers in hunger while he was so lost in his head, but crying and despairing over something that had been done and over with won't bring him any good. "So you are saying that you are not from here? That they let you live after discovering their secret?" Tony asked, wanting to know how Angie managed to survive living in this crazy town, wondering if the only way for her to live and not be killed was for her to be trapped in this town.
Viking women and men married young—as early as 12 to 15 years old. By the age of 20, virtually all men and women were married. Life expectancy was about 50 years, but most died long before reaching 50. Only a few lived to 60. That's why Tony has a rough life even being a king, an unmarried man at the age of 32 in the Viking age was a practical plea of insanity.
But the thing is, Rogers was actually not that bad, he was weird yes, he has that unhealthy obsession with death and blood and gore and strange cursed things, that was for sure. But under all that creepiness, he was actually a sweet man, he was understanding for once, never making fun of her for being a woman. He even looked at her proudly and start telling her about how his cousin Wednesday was like her, beautiful and deadly and won't stop until in her vengeance until the blood of her enemy had soaked her clothes… which as much as it was disturbing, it was actually sweet… in a twisted kind of way…
"Yeah… his bride. Thanos called Steve the 'Golden Bride' and when Steve refused him… Thanos… he ate Steve's heart…" Tony murmured, his legs losing the strength they had in them. Suddenly Tony saw himself sliding down the floor, tears he desperately tried to hold in since he saw Steve die start sliding down his face, not caring that he was showing his family how weak and vulnerable he was after that crushing vision. "I couldn’t save him… we… I just stood there as Thanos killed everyone… I just stood there as he ate Steve's heart…" Sobs wrecked Tony's body, the horror that he witness was too much for his mind to handle; it was too much.
The wistful smile that Jamti saw paint Anton's lips, made Jamti press his lips tightly, praying with all his heart that Goddess Frigga will gaze at Anton and give him someone who will stand by his side, loving him and caring for both the Alpha and his child. The smile left Anton's face, and a mischievous light entered his eyes, making Jamti tilt his head to the side with wonder; when Anton went toward his son and the queen's babe, realization painted Jamti's eyes when he saw the queen standing beside the children with a soft smile, a smile that turned into a competitive nature when the queen saw the king making his way toward him just to start arguing about something. The actions did nothing but make Jamti's eyes wide in wonder, and realization painted the Alpha's face…
"What about Petrus? Where was he?" Steven asked as he raised his hand, swiping a curl of hair that always made its way to James's forehead; his son has the most unruly hair, it took Steven ages just to brush it down. Just thinking about it getting longer, cause Steven nightmares.
"No Sir, I don't fight using a Shield, I mostly fight with knives and guns." Steven said and he can hear some people in the back gasps like they were told that whatever the hell they believed in was not true, because Captain America without a Shield? That was a sin! And Steven wondered how his eyes didn't jump out of their sockets at how much he rolled them at the questions he received, he wondered if Hydra will take mercy on him and crash this stupid conference.
When Tony was out of sight like someone possessed Bucky rushed toward Howard snarling, the screams of terror behind him were unheard as Bucky throws punch after punch with his metal arm, taking in the pleasure when he heard Howard's nose break under his strong fist when he was pulled from the Alpha, Bucky struggled and screamed and shouted, it was only the growl of Peggy Carter that froze him in his place, because if one thing was known, the woman was a prime Alpha, not even Alphas can disobey her.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, a little bit of fluff, panic attacks, horror elements, screaming, we got to meet a lot of different characters! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated. Beta by the amazing Publisher021!
"Why… how… what… how did you get inside of the labs? J why is he inside?" Tony growled gazing at the ceiling with a dark look on his face, daring his A.I. to try and lie to him, giving him a half assist excuse as to why the person he doesn't want to see for the unforeseeable future is in his workshop, looking at him with a bored look on his face.
"Where is my pendant?" Steven asked as he turned to Margaret, the woman looked around the place, and when she saw that no one was watching, she raised her dress a little and unclasp the pendant from the hidden place near her right leg, where she put it, raising it to the queen, who smiled gently as he took the pendant, running his fingers over the branches of Yggdrasil, it broke his heart that he was forced to abandon his true origin, that he was forced to see everything related to his old life burn to ashes, he was grateful, so grateful, to Loki, the God of tricks, who gave him the ultimate trick and illusion to be able to hide this pendant, from the king's eyes for more than a decade… these days, Steven found himself praying to Loki and Frigga more than he ever prayed for the AllFather and Thor… he was almost convinced that any other God than those two do not exist.
"Enough, Tony… that's enough." Steve raised his eyes when he heard those words, turning to the source to see Bucky giving his husband a harsh look; Steve wouldn't lie, the face Bucky was sporting was scary, the blank mask on his face mixed with the cold as winter eyes made a shiver run down his spine, and maybe it did something to Tony, because the Alpha turned his glaring eyes from Steve to Bucky.
It was only when Tony caught the cautions looks Harley was sending to Peggy Carter that he realized Harley was trying to 'Save' him from this situation that he no doubt saw from the window of the living room; the action was so sweet and protective that it made Tony's heart race a little bit. "It's OK, bambino; everything is fine. Why don't you go inside and distracts your brother for me, hmmm?" Tony asked in a low voice, causing Harley to look between Tony and Peggy with a hesitant look, making Tony bite the inside of his cheek wondering what to do.
"My, king please, do not rill them up even farther. We saw what they are capable of, we should not-" One of Johann advisors said only to be cut by a harsh slap on the face making him fall on the floor. The loud slap echoed through the eerily silent room, and Steven eyed Johann wrathful expression as he saw Margaret rush to the fallen man and dragged him toward Steven who turned the man's head gently toward him and frowns when he saw that it was old Philips, he then took a handkerchief and start wiping the blood from the man's cheek that one of Johann's rings caused.
A ping came from the computer, then the AI starts making the same peeping sound with high pitched noise, making Dum-E stop, and lower his head? like he was cocking its head when the AI stopped peeping, Steve saw Dum-E lower his claw to the ground and let out a heartbreaking peep. "I know buddy, I know…" Steve said as he walked toward Dum-E and raises his hand to pet the claw…
Day after day, he hated himself for being so envious of Pepper, the day she gave birth, Tony was waiting with Happy who so nervous that he was making Tony dizzy. When they finally went to see Pepper and her daughter Megan, Tony stayed by the door, refusing to enter the room, he refused to hold Megan when Pepper offered for him to carry her, that day he went home and nearly drank himself to death…
When Tony and Peter returned, the Omega had to give a small smile when he saw the Alpha holding the sleepy pup, raising his eyebrow when he saw Peter's clothes covered in spider webs, which one look at Tony's proud face, told him that the boy finally mastered his web shooter, which made a smile take over Steve's face as he shook his head a little at that, waving for Tony to follow him.
Tony shook the shock and growled at his father nearly stalking toward the Alpha and punching him in the face, but he was stopped by a cold voice behind him making the hair on the back of Tony's neck stand on its end. "No redemption whatsoever with you isn't it?" Steve questioned as he turned around walking toward Howard with a dark scowl on his face. "Too bad you said that in my bad ear." Steve hissed before he kneed the older Alpha in the groin which made the Alpha choke and fall on his kneed in pain clutching himself as he tried to stop his whine. "Stop whining like a bitch I didn't even hit that hard." Steve said coldly which made everyone wince and look at Howard to some degree of sympathy. "Next time you use that voice it will be more than that, fucker." Said Steve before punching the Alpha in the nose breaking his nose in the process, causing everyone to wince at the sound of crack coming from Howard's nose... "Goodbye motherfucker!" Steve snappily said as he flipped Howard the bird with both of his hands as he was walking out of the room, ignoring the people who rushed out of his way in fear.
Tony never personally met the boy that Peter was all over, but Steve did meet him a few times, joking about how the boy and Peter could pass as brothers, which usually made the pup squeal happily and beg both Steve and Tony to bring him to their home, which usually got a laugh from both the adults… though, Tony could go without being called by Peter's principle every week to inform him that the little boy always gets involved in the school fights, because of that boy Peter befriended.
, not in that place. The contractions were getting closer together and the pain was overwhelming. Even if his throat was hoarse from screaming for so long, even when hours passed and he wished for his mother, father, Peggy, Angie, Jarvis… anyone. Even when the pain didn't seem to end, and he thought he was going to die… he didn't know how he survived but he did, and he held his baby. It was a boy, a boy that has his eyes and hair, he was so small that Tony feared he was going to break him, he should… he should kill him… it was the only chance for his baby to survive… the only chance for him to not be raised in terror… it would be easy, Tony just have to put his hand on the child's face and it will be over in minutes, he could leave the body for one of Stane's minions to take to their boss, and Stane will know that Tony was not a pushover, that he wasn't afraid to kill. He should kill him... he should, he should, he can, he has to! But he can't do it! Especially when his baby turns to him and raises his small arms waving weakly, Tony started sobbing, his baby was his only family now, his baby boy.
It wasn't like this…. Years ago it wasn't like this, when she first mated to Howard, it was an arranged marriage, yes, but the Alpha wasn't like this. He cared, he cared about her, and he cared about his friends, and he cared about his son, and their happiness… that was until Obadiah. She doesn't know what that bastard did to her mate, but it changed him, it destroyed their family, and destroyed Howard's friendship with his friends, after that instead of the kisses she got from him, she will only get a fleeting glance once every blue moon, with the reminding that she needed to get ready before their guests arrived, after that, the words of praised Tony always got for inventing robots and circuits turned into looks of disappointment and resentment for being smarter than the older Alpha, after that Jarvis who used to come to their house with his wife on Sunday for dinner never set a foot inside of their home after their last fight, after that the close friendship Peggy had with Howard turn into dust… it destroyed everyone…
Tony bit his lips, narrowing his eyes at the codes that flash in front of his face; the screen light up as the codes kept streaming before him, causing Tony to let out a sigh through his nose. It was a week since his heart to heart with Peter, a week since Tony realized that the Avengers can't beat Thanos with just luck and trying to recruit any superhero their eyes fell on, a week since Tony realized that they needed a backup plan. A plan that Tony thinks he gets the handle of… in theory at least.
"Steve, you know that there are clinics that can treat Peter, right?" Tony said gently which made the Alpha let out a deep breath and nod his head at that sitting on one of the kitchen stools.
It made Steve realize a lot of things about the commander of Shield, and his respect for the older man increase, it didn't hurt that Fury's mood always gets better when his Goddaughter Megan (Coulson and Maria Hill's daughter) come to visit him every week when she had time.
Though on the bright side of things, the Omega stopped fighting him every step of the way now that he knew that Starkad kept his promise, which meant no more headaches for the Alpha… unless some idiot decided to act up and start a screaming match with the blond Omega, then all of the Omega's little followers will jump the one who screamed at the Omega, which then it will turn into a brawl that the Alpha has to stop, he spent his days screaming, which was not helping that much, not when some unpleasant company will come to the village in a fortnight.
"Mama…" The pup whine at that, but he didn't scream as Steve returned him to the paramedics, so Steve considered that as a win, Steve felt a hand touch his arm, and he turned to see the Beta from before giving him a sad but knowing smile, they gave the pup a few shots, and the pup closed his eyes, it made Steve nearly jump in fear, thinking that something happened to the pup, but the soft breath of the child calmed him down, the paramedics took the boy and rushed out, with Steve following them closely from behind.
Tony digs his fingers into the pillow under his head when he looks down and is met with a picture that belongs in an art gallery (and isn't that an idea, putting Steve Rogers sucking his cock out there for everyone to see). Steve's always been lethal with his mouth, and yet it's not only the feeling but the sight of him, how his lips fit around Tony's length and his tongue darts out to circle the head when he pulls off.
At Steve's announcement of lunch being served, Maria peeks out of the backseat of the Audi convertible, grease stain on her cheek indicating that she, too, has been involved in the aforementioned vehicle's (dis)assembly before she transferred her attention to the Nintendo game currently clutched in her hands.
He's barely responsive, his body broken. Maybe part of his brilliant mind is, too. He's still breathing, but it's like he's already gone.
They've been riding for half a day. Even with breaks in between, it's the longest Tony has ever spent on horseback, and his body keeps him very aware of that fact with every movement of the animal underneath him. His legs are cramping and his ass is already numb, making the whole affair a rather painful endeavor.
he's holding glows. The pebble-shaped, orange crystal in his hand glows and pulses with renewed intensity as he reaches out to touch it, dumbfounded and speechless.
When there's no immediate answer from Steve, Tony nods to himself and pushes himself off the doorframe. "I'm tired," he says softly in a way of goodnight. The shadows underneath his eyes suggest he means it in a physical sense, but Steve doesn't doubt it's also true in almost every other way of interpretation.
Steven attempted to calm his stuttering breath and quickening heartbeat. The door was unlocked; any moment now, one of the castle's many inhabitants might open it and stumble upon the scene on the other side.
Tony feels his face scrunch up in a strained grimace as he tries to pry his eyes open. They refuse to cooperate, at first, and the first glimpses he gets through small slits in his eyelids are nothing but blurry smudges of color. It's frustrating and he grinds out a sound of displeasure through clenched teeth, fingers digging into the soft material underneath.
The man must've felt Steve's gaze on him, because he looks up almost moments after. "I'll do it," Steve announces, careful yet determined, but then thinks better of it. "If you'll let me."
Again–and Steve thinks he should’ve seen this too–even in their plight, it appears they’ve been lucky. Things seem to have gone well. They’re okay. There’s the first bang of fists, the screech of nails against the other side of the door. Steve doesn’t flinch. It was to be expected. A few more join in, but not enough that the noise becomes deafening. They’ve had worse.
thing, and then I figured I might do well to talk to Steve about it because he’d bite my head off if he found out I just went over their heads with this.” He pauses, stunned. “I ended up telling him about– my vision. So, we called for a team meeting, discussed the matter and decided, together, that it was too great of a risk. And that was the end of that.”
Tony hears himself whimper as Steve’s fist finally tightens around him, pre-come easing the slide as he begins jerking him in deliberate strokes. The picture in the mirror is absolutely filthy, and even
Siree Danvers did not care for the things proclaimed right and just in the eyes of others. In any case, everyone had their own idea of morale and honor – some drew the line at infidelity, other men saw no wrong in fathering a bastard or two.
Although, taking in the scene, it couldn't be denied that even from the sidelines, this had to be a sight to behold. Thor was pretty much living proof for that assumption, as he had barely moved from his spot for the better part of the last hour and still seemed as invested as he had been in the beginning.
The kiss, hot and messy as it is, has them both out of breath by the end of it. Tony looks at him quietly as they part, something new and unreadable in his half-lidded eyes. When their lips meet again, there’s a desperate edge to the way he moves against Steve that wasn’t there before.
Steve's muscles grow taut underneath his fingers, but he relaxes again before Tony can pinpoint what might've caused the reaction. "I did," he says, trailing a finger down Tony's spine. Tony leans into the touch, not quite ready to let go.
Then again, the bastard did play him like a fiddle until the very end, so maybe there is one piece they’ll finish under the thunderous applause of no one at all.
He offers her the vodka and she accepts, as is the proper thing to do when concluding a business. She doesn't wait for him to swallow first; poison wouldn't be in his interest and it wouldn't affect him to a noticeable degree anyway. After she's downed the shot, she sets the glass facedown on the desk and leans back, gaze assessing.
He meets Steve's eyes again and there's guilt in the twisted line of his lips. Which is precisely what Steve sought to avoid, but he's never been as good at camouflaging his emotions as Tony's known to be.
turns into yet another lie. They're apart, disassembled. Broken, all of them. As he sits there in the dirt, numb with a pain that’s yet to come, he looks up into the sky with tears in his eyes.
It's long after that people start slowly saying their goodbyes, the more distant acquaintances first. Steve eventually turns to go as well, leaving only Tony's closest family and the Parker kid behind, but Pepper walks up to him and holds him back with a hand on his arm.
Anthony Stark understood the courtesy of inviting even the less pleasant royals to his castle and his feasts, but only the ones whose company he did indeed enjoy would be asked to join him in the great hall.
"Like I said," Tony smiles with too many teeth and lifts his cup in a mock toast before downing the booze left, "I don't have much else to do."
, mocking the simple reality that no true title for a woman knight even existed. Carol, in turn, took this name and henceforth introduced herself as one Siree Danvers to everyone she met, which deterred the jokesters quickly enough.
After he’s sheathed his length in the other man, pelvis meeting his hip, Steve blinks his eyes open, dazed. Being assaulted with all that sensation, he hasn’t even noticed they fell close. Stark makes himself heard almost immediately the moment Steve bottoms out and stills: He grumbles a protesting “
Stark’s nostrils flare, his stinging, blue gaze reduced to a dimly flickering one. His eyes are indeed brown, underneath whatever tech usually shields them from sight. A pity, because they’re exceptionally pretty; chocolate, hickory and umber. Big, reminiscent of a deer’s. Of prey.
Later, Tony gets into the shower and washes off the confusion alongside yesterday’s sweat. There’s rarely a time the whole team is around the tower at the same time, and he’s looking forward to spending the obligatory movie night with them. Refreshed, he hums a little tune as he dries himself off.
The wait was worth it, Tony decides, as he watches his favorite shirt and the tailored pants get discarded, exposing those endless plains of muscle and milky skin that turns golden in the warm light. To no one's surprise, Steve's cock is already fully erect without having received a single touch. The sight is drool-worthy, and knowing that this eight-inch delight is going to be
Still, Tony thinks they could’ve reached an equilibrium. It is time that has run them ragged; the one it took for them to admit what was between them, the one it took to build trust only for both of them to tear it down in the end–Tony laid the groundwork of their destruction with Ultron, and Steve tore down the leftovers in Siberia.
Steve kisses his forehead, and Tony shoves the thoughts away to regard him with a curious look. Out of all the places he expected to be touched first, this wasn’t one of them.
The injured shoulder sends a spike of pain zipping through him with every step he takes toward the back entrance of the house, the front boarded up entirely to hide their presence from the odd traveller crossing through these parts. Steve makes himself embrace the pain, commits the discomfort to memory until a shadow of it lingers. This only scratches the surface of the agony he deserves to have coming his way, he thinks–and feels ashamed of it in the very same moment.
Lord Stark laughed out loud, a bright sound that echoed along the chamber's ancient walls and chided Peter for his youthful naiveté.
"Don't you fucking dare die on me, Steve," he says suddenly, the words spoken gently despite his language. His voice is almost inaudible to Steve, and still even the hint of it seems to soothe all his pains.
“We are all well aware that Anthony is quite peculiar in many ways. Gods, he put a woman in charge of his finances! But, ah, as much as he likes to allow them in places they simply do not belong in, he does not appear to enjoy their company very much beyond that,” Hammer said, taking a dramatic pause as he looked up from his cup. “So, when I learned that Lord Stark’s chambers haven been quite well-frequented by people most definitely not belonging to the fairer sex in the past, I cannot say I was particularly amazed. A man who sympathizes with whores would know to take it like one as well, I suppose.”
this. Steve had known he'd like it, had seen it in his nervous energy (fidgeting hands, bouncing on his toes, exaggerated expressions) and of course, the subtle bulge in his denim when they had, in every sense of the word, propositioned the others. But this– this was something else. A large portion of his enjoyment stemmed from Steve in him, but another, equally strong one originated from the knowledge that he was being watched, assessed, taken apart by prying gazes just as he was by Steve's dick.
Now, rainbows in puddles coated with oil are just dirty puddles. A skyscraper checkered with (un)lit offices is nothing but light pollution. And sunrise only announces yet another day the city may lose its serendipitous equilibrium between absolute chaos and total despotism.
Stark gets his act together a few days after, and he’s acting like he’s being made to do the walk of shame even though nobody really looks at him twice – no more than they usually do, in any case.
Anyone who says a fake dick is practically the same thing is lying to themselves. Fuck. Tony exhales a shuddery breath into the pillow, arches his back a little bit more. As Steve glides deeper and passes over his prostate, he can't stifle the long, wanton keen that seeps out of him.
Once he has assessed the damage done to his person, Tony looks around. He’s alone, completely and utterly. No horse, no mules, no nothing. Well, no group of hungry canines is greeting him either, so there is a silver lining leastwise. He shudders as a chill washes over him. It’s high time he gets out of the water.
They watered and fed the animals before setting off, Rogers taking the lead on top of his strawberry roan with a caravan of four mules trailing after him while Tony was left with two. They were either the most stubborn beasts he'd ever had the misfortune of crossing paths with, or he was even less prepared for this little adventure than he initially assumed.
Steve taps his fingertips against the empty glass for a moment, frowns in thought. He looks back up to address the voice in the ceiling; can’t help it. Really, he never could. It doesn’t matter whether JARVIS can hear and will answer him no matter if he’s facing the sensors – it’s just about being polite. (Needless to say, Tony had the time of his life making fun of him for that sentiment whenever possible.)
Fine is an understatement, even. He's always liked flaunting certain parts of himself, flattering himself with something maybe a little too tight or cut too deep, and he knew people saw it and liked it and he liked
Tony can't say he blames the old man, because the picture he had to have made was pitiful if anything: unshaved, a knuckle-shaped bruise on his jaw, shadows underneath his eyes and looking about fifty pounds less capable than Rogers who could essentially be considered a half-god incarnate under a too-large hat.
The compound crumbles and the earth seems to open up and swallow what's left. Steve is expecting to see his end, here, as he faces Thanos with bitter determination and a broken shield.
Tony flopped back down onto the covers entirely, head on the side facing their teammates, which was definitely a deliberate choice on his part. They'd get to see his coming undone, every twitch and raw detail as he'd be taken apart by Steve's dick in him, his every emotion bared to the people around them.
Refused to take up residence in the castle. The proposition itself, well – Peter did not have to ponder it for long.
He pulls the other man back down, cradling him tight as he presses a kiss onto the crown of his head. He’ll be damned if he goes out not telling Tony just how much his feelings are shared.
“You throw that at some poor bastard? Boom. Well-done mincemeat. Just need something to light the fuse.”
Steve then tracked down that man, his supplier, the man who’d supplied the supplier and lastly, the woman at the end of the trail who–after a short heart-to-heart with his ability to effortlessly break bone–shared where and how she’d met with the infamous Anthony Stark himself.
Come next week, his to-do list is stuffed to the brink with projects and his head spinning with dozens of concepts not yet written down. Once he discovers the extent of obsolete technology in this field he’s just touched on, he can't bring himself to stop. And if it's an escape from the event that triggered it all, well. He's had worse coping mechanisms in his time.
In the mornings, Tony drags himself into the kitchen. Steve will be there reading the paper and Tony will cast a glance at the ceiling. "I can confirm Captain Rogers is currently in the right place," JARVIS will say.
Tony throws his head back and groans, a noise that instantly causes Steve to direct his attention back to him.
cry out of sheer frustration. Then, after he hasn’t cried out of sheer frustration, he picks himself up and focuses on something other than the big picture for once.
"Nah, it's nothing important." Steve offered with a smile returning his attention to Bucky, who just nodded his head alone and didn't point out his lie. "So you said you used to draw in high school, tell me about your adventures, are you a good artist?" Steve challenged cheekily, stealing a fry from Bucky's plate, causing the Alpha to pout but the competitive light returned to his eyes as he told Steve all about the painting he used to draw in school.
Tony looked at the house in front of him with pounding heart, it had been two days since the last time he saw the love of his life, two days since he knew about his little bambino Peter, two days he spent paying all of Steve's debts to the hospital and all of its interest while booking them a private wing only for Peter in Jarvis' hospital, two days he spent working trying to make everything perfect for when he finally talks to Steve and explain everything to him.
Halfway done, with only the beard left to get rid of, Steve's phone starts ringing, which snapped him out of his chat with the barber and Bucky, he gave Bucky a reassuring squeeze before taking his phone to see who was calling, almost scowling when he saw that it was Tony; of course, Tony will call him now of all the time. Before Steve answered the phone he paused a little before turning it to the silent mood, not answering Tony's call, letting it go to the voice mail. Yes, it was petty of him, but Tony did the same thing to him, ignoring Steve's fifty-plus calls after he promised he will be with him today of all days.
Lady Maria’s fate threw the young Lord Stark into a depression so severe he almost found death at its hands himself, not least because Howard’s counselor Obadiah Stane had attempted to overthrow his reign in his time of weakness with a ragtag mob of sellswords and renegade knights from the Iron Guard.
With this piece however, the focus lay on all its detail and beauty, the person who had crafted the armor evidently considering its creation not a task but an art.
Tony can't help himself – a bit of sick wonder and disbelief claw their way into his chest. He looks back down, and, with no small amount of trepidation, reaches out with a hand. His palm smooths over the light bump of his stomach and then, he pulls at a fold of (what looks to be) mostly fat with his thumb and index finger. He jiggles the skin to check. Yup. No rock-hard abs there, as suspected.
And then Tony thinks that same thought again and this time it creates a little spark that sets something aflame inside of him.
Although one might argue that one of his demons always keeps his company. The flask of whiskey has traveled from his saddlebags to his vest pocket and never remains untouched or unfilled. He carries it with him like an injured deer would drag its broken leg; a burden, a hindrance, and one he's not going to relieve himself of at that. Until the day it finally kills him, that is.
It doesn’t matter that he crawls away on all fours to bring distance between them, with the drugs already in his bloodstream. And sure enough: When Stark tries to rise, he tumbles like he's three sheets to the wind and then keels over again, crash-landing on his hands and knees. One of his hands is metal but the other one is flesh, and it bleeds when it skits over the graveled concrete.
After various winding paths, issues primarily caused by stubborn mules and another three hours, Tony's caravan has made it down to the agreed upon place. The foot of the mountain is visible from here; it figures that they would make them trail all the way down here instead of meeting somewhere in the middle. He scoffs as he swings off Butterfingers' back and ties the horse to a low-hanging branch nearby.
Tony’s death means being left behind. Tony’s death means nothing being left. It means nothing to fight for, nothing to hope for, nothing to wake up to after a nightmare but an even worse one. Tony being gone means Steve will be too, sooner rather than later, first in spirit and eventually in body.
"Okay, come on," Tony huffs, rolling his eyes. "I'm always down for some power play, but you have to give me a
The man sighs but repeats his previous words, which are more helpful than Tony might've imagined before – Rogers shows him how to wrap the rope over his shoulder and around his elbow, so his animal ballast will neither exhaust Butterfingers' nor his grip strength. Tony doesn't get it quite right in the beginning, but after some trial and error, he has the rope positioned right and is sitting in the saddle in a way that distributes the counterforce equally.
Tony deflates in something akin to relief when Steve doesn’t object to his decision. Steve pretends it doesn’t sting. (Because it shouldn’t. Because Tony has every right to do what he’s doing.)
He wonders how far Steve will take this. Tony isn’t about to back down from a challenge, but if Steve plans to lead them through this whole evening under the banner of Fixing Tony’s Deep-Seated Insecurities, he might come out feeling pretty discouraged. He means well, but that doesn’t change anything about the sobering reality that he can’t just fuck some self-worth into him, no matter how hard he might try or how much of an expert he may have become at the fucking part.
Rogers pulls the door close and pushes the flimsy lock in place, a last gust of cool air carrying into the room before its kind is locked out entirely. Tony looks away before his gaze can linger, and returns to poking the humble beginnings of the fire crackling in the fireplace. He adds a few smaller chippings of wood just to be safe, watching as they’re consumed by the flames.
Once everyone's dealt with, he makes to move toward Stark's sleeping quarters – and is promptly held back by Donna, who looks at him with a tight-lipped expression and motions for him to settle.
Yes, the days where he could get off just receiving are over, and it’s yet another in a long series of age-related developments that grind his gears. Even though Steve "Hopeless Optimist" Rogers would argue that, well, it just means everything they do in bed lasts longer, and that should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a hindrance.
His profile bears more imperfections up close but to Steve, it only means he's seen more, experienced more,
encircled by Steve’s arms, his front plastered against Tony’s back and hands rubbing up and down his torso as though he doesn’t know which part of Tony to shower with attention first.
“Will do,” Steve mumbles against his neck, pressing a fleeting kiss there. It stings and he winces, which in turn has Steve voicing an apology.
When it was time for their parties to part ways, Lord Rhodes was the opposite of bewildered to find Rogers fall into line with Anthony's guard. It seemed like the natural order of things, if anything at all.
Yeah, most of what he's doing these days isn't considered physical exercise in the traditional sense.
He rides in the back of Fury's car with another agent who does his utmost to appear casual, which doesn't account for much considering Steve can very clearly see the outline of multiple tools underneath his coat designed to take out a super-soldier. He's pretty sure at least one of them is a tranquilizer gun, but, well… Can't really fault them for taking precautions, can he?
when you're the most perfect thing I've ever had the fortune of laying my eyes on. It's just, it doesn't make sense. Everything–"
ears, and that should mean– "What the fuck's that supposed to mean, JARVIS? I swear, one of these days I will sit down and hand-pick all those lines of code even
His voice is raspy, almost like a purr, and – really, there’s just so much Steve can take. Super-soldier or no, at the end of the day, he’s only human.
Steve starts him out slow. Tony’s grateful and annoyed about it at the same time, because while going easy on his body will minimize soreness later, he wants that circumstance to not factor into the way Steve chooses to treat him for once.
Steve must see something in his eyes other than apathy, because his grip tightens immediately as if he could hinder death from taking him by sheer willpower. And in a way, Tony has seen him do it before: he's come back from injuries no regular human being ever would. But Tony isn’t a super-soldier, and he’s tired. Not even Steve Rogers can break the circle of life, try though he might.
She meant to take an account of what would have to be taken care of the next day, but slowed in her step when she heard… curious noises from one place inside the building.
He shifts on the chair and realizes his mistake a little too late. The movement sends another spike of discomfort from his raw asshole up his spine. Because he let
