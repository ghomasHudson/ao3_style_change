"Let me tell you about myself." The pup nodded, staring down her with those intense light blue eyes. "I am thirty-three years old. And you're correct am the head of Psychiatry at John Hopkins. I have a mate Lara and a little boy named Jack. Do you want to see them?"
“The game its from May 1941. I know because I was there,” said Steve. Her gentle expression faded. The woman’s smile turned into a firm line. He rose to his feet, approaching her. “Now, I’m going to ask you again. Where am I?”
Their relationship was solid. They had their fights but they were minor in comparison to what they’d survived. His hand slid into his pocket, running his fingers over the small velvet box. It took him some time to figure out a metal would best withstand Steve's strength.
Lena smiled. She'd slipped up this time. The last thing she wanted to do was fight with him. They spent an entire day together again, each enjoying the family time they'd so been lacking. That night when they went to bed, Helmut wrapped his arm around her waist and finally asked, “how long will you stay?”
Fury could only imagine the shit show that would come with if it were to come out. Captain America begging some random alpha for a knot. There would no repair that image. Now it was officially one of his issues. Omega rights had grown immensely since Rogers’ age. There was so much the captain needed to learn. Fury already set up a team made for Steve’s adjustment to the new era.
“Fine,” he said. Tony forced himself to relax. This activity was far more intimate than he thought it would be.
The lights flickered on. He grabbed one of the punching bags leaning against the wall, and hung it up. Steve set an alarm on his phone for an hour and tucked it into his back pocket. Tonight was the night. A good work out would help him be more relaxed when the moment came. As he focused on the task, his mind began to wander. Memories of the war came flooding forward and Steve tried working through it. But his mind wouldn’t let go, as if it was trying to remind him how unworthy he was of growing life within him. With a final hit, the punching bag shot across the room.
It should be lighter. About two pounds lighter. The weight should be proportional. Piper tested its range of motion. Its purpose was more for strength and durability than flexibility. He pulled away slightly when she tried testing his upper arm range of motion. She instantly stopped.
"I didn't give you it, Steve. We made it together." Tony smirked at how sappy he sounded but it was true. He kissed Steve slowly, fully savoring his mate.
This was his odd way of comforting her. And it worked, just … not as much as either of them wanted. It would mean so much if Winter were her dad. Or if he wasn't a killer too. She couldn't believe her parents would accept her. They stood for good. What did she stand for? How could she be good if the thing inside her, that gave her strength, was bad? What if she let it out again? When she got mad?
Tony buckled Piper into her car seat, quietly shutting the door behind him. Piper slept through the noise of New York. When they got to the tower he carried her out of the car. As he entered Piper’s room Jarvis lowered the shades. Tony put Piper to bed, taking off her jacket and shoes.
"What powers did I have during the fight?" She needed to know if anything else had changed, since the last time she’d blacked out.
“I don’t want S.H.I.E.L.D. to have that information either. Only the people that need to know,” he said.
“The base is about thirteen thousand feet up,” said Clint. He hated mountain climbing, especially in the winter. Clint hated the thin air, cold, and wind. The strong winds made it all the more difficult to fire off a clear shot. The heavy clothing impeded his range of motion.
Tony checked his phone while Steve talked with the kids. Steve seemed so at ease with the pups. There was a notification from Jarvis. They were starting to gain more attention.
Steve slid off his shirt.  Tony licked his lips. His hands moved the omega's hips moaning as they rocked together.
Rhodes sighed. He didn't want to drag Tony into this. But they could use his help. As long as Steve didn't find it would be fine. And that was big if. Rhodes saw what Steve could do when he was angry. He didn't want to be a target of that hormonal rage.
“Only remembering when Howard and Maria first brought you here. He was tired but so proud. The man hardly let you out of his arms the entire visit.”
"It would likely make him more protective than average alpha, but that doesn't seem to be an issue with him."
"Any idea what caused it?" asked Steve. Nothing in Howard's office should have caused that reaction from her. It was more likely to stir such a response in him than her.
Piper jumped back putting a good amount of distance between them. Her wrists were aching. She jumped at the crack of thunder. The loudness was disorienting. The lights flickered. Threads of whitish-blue electricity circled around him. When his eyes glowed white, she realized her distraction too late. He crashed into her, slamming her into the wall.
The pieces clicked together. “You're Captain America, how is this possible. You’re alive,” she gasped.
Tony nodded. There was no choice but to use a command. He locked eyes with Steve. The omega kept his gaze.
“He shouldn’t. I assessed the situation, determined it was safe enough for me to handle. I can defend myself. Winter taught me well.”
The pup apologized too much. It was a bothersome trait, but it was better than the crying. He hated it when she cried. It left him helpless on how to deal with it.
When Rumlow dared to touch him, he grabbed the alpha, throwing him through the neighboring wall. Steve got into his room, locking the door behind him. He called Tony.
“Steve.” A small, fearful whine touched his ears. Steve was tucked under a worktable, shaking. His face was hidden. How had Steve managed to squeeze himself into the small gap? “Steve,” he whispered.
“I got all I needed from you. The great Captain America begging me to mount him like the weak primitive creature you were truly meant to be. You couldn’t even save your best friend,” said Tony. As soon as the words left his mouth he regretted. He'd gone too far.
Piper charged, hitting Winter with unexpected force. His back struck the wall, severely fracturing the glass. The pup hobbled back, panting heavily. The blue glow faded from her eyes as she collapsed. Alarms went off outside the cell.
He changed the channel back to the news. It was a nice change seeing mostly positive things about himself on the news. Steve woke around dinner. It was simple only pasta with the first sauce Steve found in the pantry.
A hammer slammed against his chest bringing him to the ground. He shot back at Thor, sending the god into a tree. With a kick, he sent the rival alpha all the way through. Thor raised his hammer, lighting shot from the sky, coursing through his armor. The charge was so intense he was unable to move.
Piper sat at her desk, waiting for permission to leave. Lena took Piper's notebook, flipping through the pages. The girl's doodles weren't doodles at all. They were blueprints. She was trying to figure out the mechanics of Winter's arms. So far, Lena hadn't gone into the subjects of mechanics or engineering. It wasn't something she was interested in. They were the carpentry of the sciences. She found it rather dull.
"This is between the two of us, not him," said Tony. His mask was filtering out the other alpha's scent. It was the only thing keeping in control of rage. Not at Steve but at the man so close to his omega. "Steve please."
"As I said, Ms. Pott is Sir's ex. Their relationship is strictly platonic. They stay in communication since Ms. Pott is the current CEO of Stark Industries."
"I think best to remind those under my tutelage exactly where they stand, so there is no confusion."
Steve leaned forward, feeling compelled to quick kiss against Tony's lips. He blushed and focused his attention elsewhere.
Tony swallowed Steve’s release.  He trailed a path of kisses up the omega’s tone chest, pressing their lips together, letting the omega taste himself. He spread Steve's legs slightly. Carefully pushing his finger past the tight ring of muscles. He bit his lip. There was so much he wanted to do, but he had to wait, give Steve time to adjust.
There were good things too, which brought calm to the chaos. Pepper and Maria Hill got married in a beautiful ceremony - Piper was the flower girl. The couple tried for a pup. But after multiple rounds of IVF, Maria and Pepper were excited to adopt.
"You don't, but I wish you would. And there's little I can do to make you. But rather than lie to me, tell me you're just not ready to talk about it. Lying isn't a good thing, Pipes. It's a bad habit I don't want you picking up," said Tony.
"I assume this has something to do with Steve's condition," said Bruce, cleaning his glasses.  A pregnant super-soldier. There wouldn't be another chance for him to study such a subject. Banner shook his head. This was a friend, not a subject.
Steve smile faded. The president looked toward him for. Steve’s jaw locked as Extremis shot up his spine gnawing at his nerves. His eyes closed. All he could do was wait.
There was only an hour left until the wedding. Guests were wondering around the ceremony area. Tony and others were dressed and ready. Natasha and Clint arrived at the same time. She wore a deep blue dress matching the colors of the wedding. Steve asked her and Clint to be groomsmen. Neither held the title of best woman or man. The honor belonged to Bucky. A seat in the front row had been left open to honor his lost best friend.
“Your birth control is 99.99% effective. I have to say likely because there’s an exceptionally slim chance of malfunction,” said Jarvis.
"I constantly reminded him I was still me. My heat didn't change that. I wasn't an omega that needed his protection. Eventually realized I still the same person," said Steve.
"Are you disappointed in me because you caught me in a lie, or that I wasn't telling you the truth?"
Steve growled, backing away from him. It was far deeper than what he expected from an omega, but his scent didn’t lie.
Under Tony’s shirt were the lines of a brace, immobilizing his shoulder. It could have been worse. A nursed escorted them to their room. Tony flinched when he laid back.
"So, I can say I understand, Piper and mean it. I know what it's like to afraid for your friend's life and to fear for your life. What it's like to be used solely for who you are, nothing more."
Steve let himself in. She performed a routine examination. Checking his heart, lungs, and blood pressure. It was a waste of both their time. His health was always perfect.
"It was a quiet night, but she'll be waking up soon enough." On cue, she jabbed against him. "Morning little one."
Jarvis played the footage. It was only a few seconds long, but it gave him an idea of what Tony saw. The darkness of space was haunting. He couldn't imagine what it would be like to experience it in person.
She nodded. He went to Steve’s room and injected the serum into his IV. The irritated orange glow extinguished. Steve relaxed.
Steve woke hours later to Tony joining him in bed. He shifted onto his side, pulling to the alpha to his chest, wrapping his arm around the man's waist to keep him close. Steve nuzzled against Tony's neck. “My alpha."
He got his feet again, bracing against the wall. Steve limped to the bathroom. A tub filled with hot water and bubble bath awaited him. He eased into the hot water, moaning at the sensation. It was terrific for his aching muscles. The jets worked out the remaining tension. Steve sunk into further into the bath.
He went to the mirror. Judging from the length of his hair, it had been four years since it was last cut. He trimmed his hair to a more reasonable length, then shaved. He took a moment to stare at his reflection. It was a face he hadn’t seen in some time. This face didn’t truly belong to him. Who was he? Did he have someone looking for him? He turned his head slightly, stretching his neck, but found no claim mark. No. No family was looking for him. That was for the best.
There was a crackle as the fire turned on. Steve went to the closet and changed into his sleeping clothes and put his sweater back on. Before returning to the living area. Christmas music was playing softly over the speakers. He settled on the floor by the fireplace warming his feet. Steve began singing along:
Steve nodded. They sped out the driveway, the gate closed behind them. Steve watched the surroundings pass by. He yawned. Tony turned down the music. When they got home he woke Steve up. The omega shot of the car speeding in the direction of the nearest bathroom.
He picked them up, balancing one on each hip. Steve carried them upstairs, tucking them into Piper's bed. He took a random book from the shelf
Bruce was amazed at what he'd gathered from the samples. Tony's cells took on some attributes from the serum when Steve claimed him. It would slow his aging, make him heal faster, not as fast Steve, but faster than the average human. He could spend months learning from these samples. What could be learned from it could change the medical field forever. In seven weeks a cell-free fetal DNA could be taken from Steve's blood it would be interesting to see what he could learn from it. He promised not to do such things. It would be a massive breach of privacy.
"Don't push yourself." She put a large cup of coffee in his hand. Tony had truly impressed her. He'd remained calm, the entire duration of the surgery. For most alphas, the situation would be impossible.
Tony followed Fury into another room. His inner alpha growled, hating being separated from such a compatible omega, ready and wanting. He pushed down the urge. Tony was unused to that side of himself. Fury tossed a large stack of a paper in front of him. It was at least five hundred pages.
Tony didn't know how to react. She was defending an assassin and rejecting her parents. The Winter soldier made no move against her. Could she not recognize them? He took off his helmet.
Steve was going to enjoy this while he could. He sat next to Tony, leaning against the alpha's side. Tony's hand carded through his hair. He began to purr. The alpha effortlessly drew the sound from him. They stay like that for the entire flight.
Genius recognized genius even in grief. His mind was trying to put together how the man created such an amazing piece of technology given the limited resources of the time.
“Howard wasn’t clear with his feelings. Letting Anthony believe he was a burden rather than telling him the truth,” said Peggy.
Natasha and Clint stripped. Steve signed and did the same. Keeping his gaze focused anywhere but his naked friends.
Tony laughed. They went to the penthouse. Tony worked on breakfast while Steve showered. Steve quickly dressed. He went into the kitchen. Steve poked at the plate of food waiting for him at the counter. He couldn’t get himself to eat. Steve settled for a breakfast of coffee. It gave him the caffeine he needed.
Tony quietly moved to her bedroom. He pulled the blankets over her. She could be a headache, but he loved her with everything in him. He hadn’t thought it was possible to feel that way. Tony didn't know what he'd do without her.
She found the nearest circuit, breaking into Jarvis's system from there. It took her about ten minutes. Jarvis's system was far more complicated than anything else she had worked on. Daddy would have to update Jarvis's firewalls. Holographic screens showing every room in the house, except the bathrooms, surrounded them.
“Its DNA is extremely adaptable. If it were reintroduced to serum the pup would absorb it and strengthen itself. Steve, what you were shot with caused your birth control malfunction. I believe those responsible for shooting you with the birth control defuser were aware of this information," said Bruce.
Steve braced against him. Tony lowered Steve into the tub. The omega purred loudly as the jets worked into his muscles. Tony sat on the edge of the tub running his fingers through Steve’s hair. He washed the omega’s hair, causing Steve to sink further into the water. The omega tilted his head back for him to rinse out the shampoo.
, he wanted to work on a project with someone else, that was a first. It could end badly, but it would show Steve he was willing to work together. He bought it.
Tony squeezed his hand. He shouldn’t allow it, but he wanted it. This would fade in time. They walked back to the lobby. Steve scowled when he saw Natasha. He wanted a few more hours with Tony.
The holographic blue image of the scene appeared before him. He walked to the center of the room, information floating around him.
Tony lazily released the embrace. He blushed when the alpha, wiped syrup from his mouth with his thumb. Tony licked the drop from his finger. Steve finished off what was on his plate, trying to forget the ideas it put in his head.
Tony rolled his eyes. “See that red lever. It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by and wait for my word,” said Tony.
It was a nice thought. But she didn’t realize how unrealistic that was? Even if they did escape together, no parent would want him near their child. The two of them were forced into this situation and just happened to get along. Winter simply nodded. He wouldn’t take away the pup’s hope. So many things would be taken from her. He couldn’t steal that from her, too. She’d need it.
From outside his office, he already heard the rush to action. It would be impossible to evacuate a facility of this size. It would take hours. A destructive worm was already working its way through the computers. There would be little to nothing left to gain from them when the Avengers arrived. The staff stationed here was weak and likely crumble under interrogation. They’d have to be eliminated. He gathered his personal team of soldiers into his office.
Tony laid Piper on her back. He took a deep breath before undoing the tabs. Steve laughed when he made a gagging sound. He wasn't going throw up! He powered through it and quickly disposed of it.
"I am asking for a chance. He deserves some kind of home," said Hill. The kid had gone through enough hell.
"I went to a Russian fighting ring, specializing in fighters with mechanical limbs. Someone there just happened to owe me a favor."
Steve nodded. There was an audience of S.H.I.E.L.D agents watching them. He turned red. Steve hid his face in the crook of Tony’s neck.
“Hasn’t Winter taught you to always be aware of your surroundings? It was your responsibility to be aware,” said Lena.
"I understand it’s an uncomfortable subject, but it’s very relevant to your current condition,” said Edith.
Steve relaxed slightly when Tony left. After ten minutes, he regretted his decision. His stomach turned uncomfortably at the separation. He went to Tony’s lab. The alpha was working on one of his suits.
Winter pressed the edge of the blade into Smith's neck, sinking it in just enough to pierce the skin.
"I'm not doing anything to him. He's designed to take commands. His current state is his own doing. Winter shouldn't resist. Denying or resisting an order will only cause him further harm."
He kissed Steve on the forehead, before leaving bed. Steve instantly spread out. The omega was out moments later. He went to the lab and worked on Dumm-E and U. Their systems were simple compared to what he was used to. His mind ached for the intricacies of the armor. What if Steve went into labor and he couldn't get there in time?
Once they finished lunch they moved onto what was next on the schedule. Espionage turned out to be the worse class. She was strapped to a lie detector machine, then made to repeat the phrase the 'the sky is red' until it came off seamlessly as if it were fact. She'd failed utterly and cried through the whole endeavor.
Steve was waiting for him in the kitchen with a large first aid kit. He sat through Steve bandaging his injuries. They ate quietly.
He moved his hand away. Steve whined alluring at the absence of his touch. Tony paid the delivery boy and hurried back. He placed four large paper bags of food on the coffee table.
Tony followed, marking Steve’s stomach with his seed. The omega went weak in the knees, leaning fully against him. Tony barely kept them standing. He lowered the two of them to the ground. Slick and Steve’s cum marked in his skin. The omega rested his head against his shoulder. It had been too long since it was that intense. The intensity must be due to the potency of Steve've heat pheromones. The levels must be heightened from long-term hibernation. That has to be it.
The scientists hurriedly left them. When they were out of sight he relaxed. His preheat was making him irritable. “What happens next?” asked Steve.
"Steve, she is. I hate admitting, but she is a danger if she doesn't learn how to control her abilities. If a population outside of S.H.I.E.L.D saw what she could do, Piper would be classified as a weapon, not a person," said Tony.
He glanced at the clock. “I have to go.” Steve went to the office where he met Barny once a week. A plate of muffins was waiting for him. As much as he hated going to these sessions, he needed them.
"Bye, Barny.” Steve tucked his phone back into his pocket. "Jarvis, pull up everything you can find on Dr. Caroline Bloom and Dr. George Wong."
Piper slowly regained to consciousness. Everything was numb and heavy, her eyelids immovable. Fear was the first reaction. But paralyzation trapped her inside with every hurt, every threat encroaching on her sanity. It was too overwhelming. She wanted to scream but couldn’t. Then she caught a familiar pine mint scent, her only comfort here, Theodore. His heartbeat and breathing were calm. He must be asleep or unconscious.
Piper looked to Winter, he nodded. He accepted what was about to happen, but it didn’t feel good. The glass wall of their cell lowered and Lena stepped in, then locked the collar in place around his neck.
“Calm down,” said Steve. Under all, the bluster was fear. Tony wouldn't be acting like this otherwise. Steve had to push through it, a task that was made all the more difficult by having a stranger in their den.
Steve handed him the shield. It weighed twelve pounds. The metal itself was unscathed. Tony itched examine it further. Melt it down and remake it, but Steve would never allow him. It would be simple enough to build an electromagnetic glove. The project would take an hour at most. Applying a new coat of paint would be a short process, but it would take twenty-four hours to dry. He could add a few harmless functions that Steve wouldn’t mind.
I'm sorry this update took so long. Due to a minor concussion during a riding spill, I was unable to complete it in a timely manner.  Thanks to my beta reader I believe it makes for a smoother.
“Military wedding, no patriotic patterns. I don’t need a church, but I want a Catholic ceremony," said Steve.
Steve nodded. Edith understood. The science team would be all over Steve if they found out. He’d be deprived of his privacy.
He couldn't do that to Steve and Tony. Hulk would hate it. The big guy liked Tony and saw him as a friend. In general, he didn't have many. Now he had five among them an alien, super soldier, engineering genius, and two highly trained assassins. They needed to be durable to be his friends. There was a knock on the door. He turned to see Steve with a bowl of food.
Steve was about to cry. Tony couldn't take the crying. "I'll go get some pickles is there anything else you want?"
"Mom had a habit of locking Howard out when he got on her nerves. So he kept a key here. And she let him think she didn't know. He never bothered updating the system," said Tony.
Winter was shifting on his feet. He could stand perfectly still for hours. That slight shift was enough to display his true worry. It hadn’t been that long. At least she didn’t think so.
Steve sat outside the shower listening to the sound of the water. Tony couldn’t spy on him here. He ran his fingers through his hair. His chest was uncomfortably tight. He managed to collect his breath. The water stung his skin. He wasn't sure how long he stayed there. A jolt went through when the water went cold.
There was a special on the pyramids. Tony worked while Steve watched. He worked better when he was sitting with Steve running his fingers through the omega's hair. Only looking away from it when Steve started snoring.
She smiled at the bright yellow coloring. It had been so long since she was exposed to anything but gray of her prison. She slipped on the shirt and sunflower patterned skirt, then shoved her feet into her shoes, staring helplessly at her shoelaces. Daddy knelt to tie them for her. “Einstein didn’t learn how to tie his shoes until was teenager,” he said.
Winter knew he looked horrible. His face was a mess of green-purple bruises. He'd broken several bones in his face. His nose was crooked and his eyes were blackened. By the throbbing sensation in his side, he'd broken at least four ribs.
The introduction of the two super soldiers went well. Lena just wished she’d gotten to Sergeant Barnes before Arnim Zola. Zola’s work was sloppy, treating his subject like a machine instead of human. Unlike machines, humans were flawed; that had to be taken into account. Subjects needed to be handled humanely enough to earn the proper responses.
“Piper, no. I’m not having a baby. I promise. Your father and I were in no place to have another child. Did they tell you that?”
. There were no weapons hidden in the room. Even if there were, most would be useless against Piper. But the beta exuded a confident calm, even though she was aware of Piper’s capabilities. That was terrifying.
“I put this in the records as a heat assessment, so don’t worry. First, let’s remove your birth control ring,” Edith said as soon as Steve arrived.
“I will.” The bracelet was a tracker with an emergency alert signal. That would call upon Tony and trigger the nearest suit to his aid.
He pressed a kiss against Tony’s temple. Steve quickly showered. Whatever he put scratched against his skin.
“Clark Gable saw Gone With the Wind twice because of him." Tony didn’t seem jealous, but he was smirking. That smirk left him with so many questions.
Steve nodded. He curled up on the couch. His eyes grew heavy. The smell of pizza woke him. Tony put on the news while they ate. He was starving. When done he relaxed with Tony on the couch. Steve yawned it was only nine and he was ready for bed.
Steve couldn’t believe Piper was already turning three. It felt like just yesterday she was taking her first steps. She was capable of such emotional complexity rivaling that of a teenager. Then, at the same time, she could have the naivety and childish behavior befitting her age. They’d tested her IQ when she was two. She’d earned a score of 180, breaking all previous records for someone in her age range.
“The scientists at S.H.I.E.L.D. have developed me a suppressant. They’ve already helped me cool down,” said Steve.
Steve slowly stretched out in bed.  He put on a pair of sweatpants, pausing in front of the mirror. Maternity clothes had proven to be some of the most comfortable clothes he'd worn. He wanted to get back into his normal clothes, something without an elastic waistband. It would be nice not feeling like a whale. He was six-foot and nearing the end of the third term. There was nothing small about him.
Before he could think it over, he was already nodding. He moved forward, making room for Tony. Steve leaned back against Tony’s chest. The cool metal of the reactor touch against his skin, sending a small shiver down his spine.
“Fine, it’s an honor to meet. I'm not sure what's more of a surprise. You moving in or you being Captain America," said Happy.
Bruce wrapped his sweater around her, swaddling her in it, holding her tightly against his chest. “Just listen to my heartbeat. I know you can do that.”
Tony hit play. The image Steve on a ventilator appeared before him. Bandages wrapped his arms. When doctors tried tending wound tending to him, he'd jolt from the bed in an attempt to attack, before losing consciousness seconds later.  Tony read through the aggression. Steve was terrified. "How did you let this happen?!"
She shook her head. Winter washed her until the scent of distress faded from her skin. After draining the tub and wrapping her up in a towel, he put her in the clean clothes had Lena brought. They were too big on the pup, but it was better than nothing. Winter tucked her into bed, hoping rest would be the answer to her condition, and took a seat in a chair beside her.
Steve nodded again. Barny handed him a large mug of chamomile tea. Steve added a spoonful of sugar and honey. He took a sip of the tea, but quickly put it down when he realized. If Barny took notice of the gesture he didn’t mention it.
“It starts off with a sickly little penguin named, Steve and his best friend Theodore. Theodore took care of Steve all his life. But Theodore had to leave him to get go to the sea. Steve waited and waited for his friend to return but he didn’t. And to did his best to become strong.”
"Why do you have to brush your teeth before you eat? It makes more sense to brush them after so food doesn't taste funny," she said.
Rhodes didn’t push further. Tony was barely hanging onto his current state of mind. Rhodes prayed his goddaughter, Steve, and Pepper's safety. Showing concerning would only agitate Tony further. He couldn't risk Tony entering alpha state.
But the alpha was clutching his left his arm, gasping. And then he was falling, backward… crashing into the cluttered work table behind him.
"A gift is something you can give back. I'm not allowed that. You've made that clear. So, stop making it sound like I have a choice."
“She’s willing to comply,” said Pierce. If the child was willing there was no need to possibly cause permanent damage to Winter.
The doctor took her leave. Tony went up to the penthouse where his mate was waiting. Steve was statute still waiting on the couch.
He was really craving sherbet, but strawberry would do. They went to the kitchen. Steve took a gallon of ice cream from the freezer, settling on the kitchen island. Watching as Tony pulled up a hologram of the tower. The damaged areas were highlighted in orange. The building's structure had held up well.
“We need them alive. How do I know they won’t kill someone we can use to get useful information?” Hill asked.
Piper agilely made her way through the minefield of toys and snuck into her parent’s room. Daddy was asleep! She pounced on him. He groaned.
Steve grabbed his shield from the front of the bed. Growling when Rumlow rudely barged into their room. His arm was in a splint and his nose was clearly broken.
Nothing. For hours he ignored her, even seeming to fall asleep again as the fluorescent light flickered off. Piper missed her parents. Someone had taken her for what she was. She’d always been warned of the risk, but it didn't seem real until now. It was all too much and Piper cried.
“For once I would love to go to a country without being injured or shot at,” said Steve. He leaned against the railing, taking in the landscape. Purring as Tony ran his fingers through his hair.
“Hey, Nat,” he said. Tony wasn’t playing fair. He bit his lip trying to keep his breathing calm as a hand traveled under his shirt.
The limited tight faced expression of grief that could be shown in war, but the true extent agony could be seen in a soldier's eyes—that anger and pure unbridled hatred at those who committed such horrendous crime against humanity.
"Nothing will happen, Tony. But I will you don't have to ask. You're just talking about the surgery." Tony nodded. “I promise.”
The weight dropped with a heavy thud. Piper was crying. Steve's shirt grew wet in response. She squirmed in Tony's hold. She'd caught the scent of milk.
Steve swallowed a growl. Too many knew! None of them were his alpha. Now it was a fact in a mission. A handicap that may affect his performance. It was never supposed to be that.
Steve quickly changed into the uniform. He changed its settings to stealth mood and latched onto his back. They got out of the jet. The climate was surprisingly warm, but it was growing dark. It was refreshing all his missions been cold.
“He’s not here.” He instantly knew that wrong thing to say. At first, it looked like she was going to cry. Then her expression changed swiftly, anger apparent. She stomped away from him. “Piper, they’d -” Winter started again, but hardly knew how to continue. Piper spun, grabbed a nearby hundred-pound plate and threw it at him. It zipped by his head.
He offered the vial to the bot. Dum-E took it carefully in its clawed hand. "Don't drop it, butterfingers."
“I know how to get what I want without killing them,” she said. Sir gave her nothing. What bullshit he spewed only serving to agitate her. Leaving was all she could do to stop herself from killing him.
Breakfast arrived but the pup was still asleep. Winter didn't move from the corner, wishing to not disturb her. She was sucking her thumb and he envied how peacefully the pup rested. He scratched at the collar locked to his neck.
"S.H.I.E.L.D. has come up with a backstory. I've made a few edits, but it's a sound story. There is one drawback," said Pepper.
Tony tensed when saw a figure in his room. He tapped on his watch face. It transformed into a gauntlet.
Killian tossed three black spheres toward him. A hologram of Steve appeared. He laid on the floor panting heavily. His skin glowed orange in certain spots as Extremis coursed through him. The muted cries of his mate played before him. All he wanted was to take away that pain. The agony of the sight threatened to call upon feral alpha wanting nothing more than to protect and mend its failure. He deep guttural inhuman sound created by the greatest anger. A zip tie snapped as he struggled forward. Killian pinned the free hand back. He snarled in tried lunging for the man’s throat.
“I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position,” said Tony.
She was in need of a diaper change. He laid her on her back only for her to roll onto her stomach. It was her most recent accomplishment. Her limbs squirmed desperately trying to move. She whimpered. Her mind was advancing faster than her body. Piper had thrown tantrums when she couldn't move on her own to a toy or something of interest. Steve cuddled her and purred, soothing her. She snuggled against him cooing softly. It would be a few more months until she could purr.
Steve nodded. Finally, the session was over. Only ten minutes until his date. He went to his room, grabbing his shield. Steve forced himself not to run to the entrance. He smiling when Tony’s car pulled up. His heart raced. He took a breath, calming himself. It did nothing to ease the butterflies in his stomach. He was only getting his shield repaired. There was nothing more to it. The car door opened. Tony was dressed in a white blazer, purple shirt, and dark jeans.
“I look forward to your next set of reports, Dr. Zemo. What a pair those two will make,” said Pierce.
She wished she knew what Daddy did to calm Papa down. Did he have the same problem as Papa? As quietly as possible she left the covers. She sat at a safe distance from the alpha. He growled. She kept her head down and started humming a lullaby. Piper counted down thirty minutes in her head before edging ten inches closer.
Tony laughed yanking away the pillow Steve was hiding behind. "What? It's not like she walked in on us?"
They were going to John Hopkins Hospital. Dr. Wu was mentoring there for a term. Jarvis already made a hotel reservation for them.
Tony tensed when he caught his husband glaring at him. Telling Steve slipped his mind. It would not be a pleasant experience when they got back to the hotel.
Steve parked in the garage. His parking space was next to Agent Coulson’s. Lola was parked in her space. The car was in perfect shape. Steve pitied the agent who accidentally scratched the car. The poor guy ended up on Coulson’s bad side.
“You don’t know how much I wish I had,” said Steve. If he had quit, his daughter wouldn’t be missing. "I suppose it’s too late for me. Being a soldier is all I know."
That translated into twenty to thirty minutes. Jarvis would keep the water at the perfect temp for Steve. He scented the omega’s neck, checking for anything that may be wrong. Steve nosed against his neck. After half an hour he was ready to get out. Tony drained the tub and helped him out. Then helped him into a pair of shorts.
"Where are you going?" asked Tony from the bed. He pulled the omega back into bed. "What happened to wanting to keep me to yourself?"
"I can't." He already heavily scent marked the alpha before he put on the armor. Some omega or beta would seak out his boyfriend. He didn't doubt in Tony's loyalty. He just didn't like the idea of others near him. That fact had almost been enough to make him go. His arms slowly slipped away from Tony.
His arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her back into bed. She cuddled into his chest, breathing his scent.
Piper could play for hours alone in her own little world and didn't seem to mind solitude at all. They'd tried introducing her to kids her own age but she showed little to no interest in them, preferring to be by herself. Every person invited to her birthday party was an adult.
Steve dropped his bag. He went the alpha. Steve looked into those perceptive brown eyes. Behind the fading anger were regret, pain, and guilt. He ran his fingers through Tony’s hair.
Steve came to a few hours later. Piper was quietly sleeping against his chest. He scented her. She smelled of lavender, honey, and milk. She was content. Perfectly healthy and safe. Steve sighed. This peacefulness was undeserved. How did he get his when others didn’t? She deserves better than what he could offer. He carefully got out of the nesting couch with Piper in his arm, setting her in the playpen.
The alpha only neared his bed. He grabbed Tony's arm, bringing him into a kiss. "It wasn't your fault."
He slowly got to his feet. Tony offered Steve a hand up. Steve took it but used it as an opportunity to catch him in a hug. He ran his hand down Steve’s back. Tony was still processing all that had happened in a short time. All he knew was Steve was his and their relationship managed to survive another fight.
Tony relaxed his offspring was safe. It was upsetting that Steve had fought in such a condition. How did he not put it together? It all seemed so apparent now. Steve couldn't have kept this to himself.
Steve respected Pepper. She was a nice omega. By all reason, he should like her. The bridge to friendship was denied by his inner omega. She was a rival. It was a petty dislike. He'd be polite. Her calls were always ill-timed. He pulled away from.
"I didn't need his permission. If I hadn't helped, who knows what world I would have brought my pup into," said Steve.
He took out a photo of a woman. Her light brown hair was styled in a pixie cut, and her eyes were dark brown. Her face looked so familiar, but she just couldn’t place it.
“I survive.” He was aware that at one point there may be an opponent or event that finally killed him. At times, he almost longed for it. Most often he was completely indifferent to whatever fate was assigned to him. Things had changed now that there was someone dependent on him. Winter knew there would come a day where she lacked that dependency. It could come at any point. They could freeze him and when he woke up she could be grown. And they may be strangers to each other. Winter began to understand that she was his replacement.
Steve snarled at the metal man perched outside their den. There was no scent. An empty shell. But that didn't mean he enjoyed its presence. He preferred the soft tones of their shelter. The armor's hard edges did not fit in with the rest. It ruined the level of comfort. He growled, preventing his alpha from joining him. Steve wanted it gone! Alpha shook his head. He had no intention of letting his alpha into their nest until it was out of sight. There was no swaying him on that. Maybe another approach was needed.
Steve leaned against his mate. Tony wrapped his arm around him. He followed him to the master bedroom. Tony tried setting him down on the nest but he refused. That was for after. He didn’t want to risk ruining it. Steve lowered himself to a bench the cushioned bench in the closet.
Everything about Tony was so sincere. He couldn’t find judgment in those dark brown eyes. Steve hugged him. Tony’s arms wrapped firmly around his waist. He melted into the embrace, realizing how much he missed the alpha's touch. They were slow to separate. An awkward silence built between the two of them neither of them knowing what to do next. Thankfully, Tony broke it.
“There’s nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out some pigeons though,” said the guard.
The museum came into view. It had changed dramatically since he last saw it. He was excited. Steve sat up, trying to get a better look. He grabbed Tony’s hand, practically dragging him through the door. Tony paid for their tickets.
Natasha shook her head before leaving. He locked the door behind her.  She left behind a toothbrush and toothpaste. He took a breath and steadied himself. For the moment his stomach was calm. Steve brushed the taste of vomit from his mouth. Steve wandered walking ship until he found somewhere secluded. There was a small window ledge where he could sit. Bruce and Tony lodged an uncomfortable thought in his head. He yawned. Steve tried pushing it away.
"Might have well have." She seemed to be a perfect split between Steve and Stark's personalities. Fury sighed. “No, one has ever gotten this close to someone you love, Natasha.”
As the pup drew Winter cleaned. When he took a break from his task, he saw the pup was scribbling an entire world map on the wall.
Tony rejoined him, and Steve rested his head on the alpha's chest, closing his eyes. The soothing beat of his mate's heart allowed him to finally rest.
Steve went through multiple handguns at the range, but none felt right. He was tempted to ask for a version of his old weapon, but he didn’t want to be a hassle.
The secretary nearly spilled her coffee when she saw them. “Dr. Wu will be you shortly. He’s currently with a student.”
Lena’s phone vibrated, disturbing her sleep. She pulled it from under her pillow, groaning when the lab's number blinked on the screen. This couldn't be good. She snuck out of bed, going into the bathroom, and locked the door behind her.
“Fuck.” Now he had to deal with that on top of a hangover. A hangover he could handle, but a potential fight with Steve no.
Steve led Tony to the elevator.  As soon as the door closed he pressed Tony against the wall, licking over his claim. Steve pulled away, realizing what he was doing. His face heated.
“My apologies a did not mean to insult your alpha status, but his stamina is beyond most human. I’m sure with your wide collection of sex toys, he’ll be fine,” said Jarvis.
“Steve!” Natasha rushed to his side. She pulling a poison-filled dart from his upper thigh. Clear liquid dripped from the needle. Steve easily got to his legs again. “How are you feeling?”
“I’m not pregnant, Tony." Steve wiped a tear from the corner of his eye. He shouldn’t be laughing, but Tony’s expression was priceless.
Days passed smoothly. Steve groaned hitting the alarm. He’d slept over at S.H.I.E.L.D so he wouldn’t have to make an early morning commute. Steve yawned. He never slept well here. But staying here also let him get whatever he needed from Edith early. Steve changed into the uniform given him. He went to the hangar. Natasha waited with the quinjet.
“It’s a nice visual,” said Piper with a shrug. And it was something to do. “Do you recognize any place on here?”
Piper used a blanket stitch. After the first one, the rest weren’t so bad. Soon, there was only the cut on his forehead to stitch. Her hands trembled.
Matt caught the flutter of Steve's heart toward the end. He believed Steve fought with his boyfriend, but he’d never caught Steve’s scent here before. Matt would have remembered it.
Tony took his hand. Steve easily lifted him to his feet. They were done with the subject. Steve would likely never speak of it again. He'd gotten what he needed from the confession. Tony understood trauma.  After losing his mother, he got blackout drunk state and told Rhodes of his sadness regret then buried it. Whenever such grief made a reappearance, he would drown it with drinking. Steve’s coping methods were unknown to him, but they seemed similar to his.
Tony grabbed Steve, pulling him onto the couch. He scented the omega. All traces of another alpha were wiped from his omega’s skin.
She was trying to absorb the information given to her. This would be the story of a lifetime if anyone were to get wind of it. Captain America still alive was one thing. Another thing was him being with the notorious playboy. The hero that embodied virtue with the one that embodied pride, arrogance, and indulgence. The headlines were already flashing before her mind. At some point, while she in thought, Tony snuck out of the room.
“Stay there. I’ll make you a nest,” said Tony. He gathered the extra blankets from the closet. Tony had gotten the hang of building a nest to Steve's high standards.
Tony went to the studio, carefully pushing open the door. Steve was curled up on the love seat. It always amazed him how small Steve could make himself. Tony joined him. Steve cuddled close to him. It was only nine but it looked like they were going to spend the rest of the night like this.
“You disturbed his process. I’ve seen Winter’s kills. He’s perfect, methodical and efficient. He prefers one clean headshot. This was-
"Honestly, I don't know where to start. Almost every bone is broken. His major joints have been dislocated put back in place and shot through. And that's just the preliminaries." Ballentine began listing the other multitude of injuries. “I’d say, all in all, he died of severe blunt force trauma, but it was slow. This took hours.”
Steve picked up the key from the floor and it to his apartment keys. It may not go to anything, but its sentimental value was priceless. Steve frowned. Would S.H.I.E.L.D allow him to leave? They put such stress on keeping him a secret. Living in the middle of Manhattan with Tony Stark was bound to bring attention. But he wanted this. He wanted it so badly. They could go to Malibu. It was secluded enough. He was willing to move away from the only home he'd ever known to have a life with Tony.
“Maybe.” Piper Stark was far from the average child. Those close to her seemed to forget that. It was a mistake to underestimated her. Or maybe he was overestimating her. “If anyone could get through to her, it's you. Your story could have been hers.”
“He’s perfectly healthy, sir. It’s only a matter of time. Preparations need to be made. It's been repressed for seventy years. It will be horrible for him,” she said.
Winter tossed the omega off him, then ran into the slowly gathering morning crowd. He didn’t dare look back. Those piercing blue eyes were too much for him. He felt like he was betraying something like it felt to disobey a command. But that didn’t make any sense. Not when he knew he was following orders; orders that were the only way to keep he and the pup safe.
He went through the aisle. Feeding a pregnant super soldier was a constant task. Food was delivered two to three times a week when they were at Malibu. He would have to set it up here. The omega always made sure he was well fed. He crammed the groceries into his sports car. Tony pulled into the back garage. There was always someone at the front of the tower. He grabbed as many bags as could before going up the elevator and put the bags on the counter.
Piper had enough of the tense angered voices and started wailing. Steve went rigid. Rushing to the elevator before the panic could fully take hold. The confined space was somehow comforting. His heart raced painfully in his chest. He sunk to the corner.
"We found a partial print on remains from the explosives and ran it through our data banks. There wasn't much hope for finding a match since it was so small."
He was shaking. Steve’s tight wet heat clenched around him. He was barely maintaining control. Instinct screamed for him to pound Steve into the mattress. He ran his fingers through hair. Slowly those muscles relaxed, allowing him to move forward. His thrusts were shallow. Steve’s soft whimpers transformed into pleasured purrs and gasps. Those long sturdy legs wrapped around him, pulling him deeper.
Tony pulled away from him. Steve sat up. He rested his head against Tony’s chest. Steve sighed as Tony’s fingers carded through his hair. Blush still burned at his cheeks.
She spent the next few hours stewing on that thought. Had they really beaten her down so much? What had happened to her? When was she ever one to give up? The idea of escape had just seemed to fade from importance as she became preoccupied with Sir’s new routines and her new friend. Piper fell from her chair as an electric rod jabbed into her. A punishment is unjust for default in attention. She growled.
Winter simply nodded, his gaze focused forward. Piper took a worried breath, snipping the first wire, and carefully studying the others before continuing.
Piper yelped when she was shot with another tranquilizer dart at close range. The jet started rolling forward. She was not leaving without Winter. Her eyes went a glowing blue. She broke the shackles binding her.
“DO NOT THREATEN MY ALPHA!” he roared. He punched the cement wall behind her. "Never threaten him again."
The soft tone of his omega’s voice made Tony relax. He moved closer to the beauty. Tony allowed the omega to tend to his arm.
Steve was too hot to bear, putting on a shirt. He cringed as he pulled a pair of shorts on. The fabric was sandpaper against his skin. His stomach growled.
Steve became lost in the alpha's touch. The alpha’s callused hands slid underneath his shirt, stroking his skin. Steve gasped as Tony thumbed over his nipple. Those soft lips traveled down. A shaky sigh left him as Tony sucked and nibbled his neck. The touch was further intensified as the alpha’s sharpened teeth scratch pleasantly against his skin. Steve pulled away before it could go any further.
After he hung up he found it impossible to get comfortable again. The fact that he was alone made him uneasy. Maternal instinct survival instinct demanded it. Despite the fact, he was more than capable of protecting himself. Steve went to the shower. Thankfully, the hot water still worked. He took his time. Steve towel-dried and changed into a fresh set of clothes. He waited in the kitchen for Tony to come back. Rushing to the door when he heard him.
Only feet away from her, Extremis sunk into spine his spine again, bringing him down next to her. He reached and rip off her arm restraints. Another explosion ignite. Steve covered their heads with his shield. Debris fell on top of them, pinning them.
"When they woke him he went into a feral rage. Killed the team working on him with his nothing but his bare hands. It took twenty men and two days to subdue him."
And for the most part she was fine walking holding Papa’s hand. When the got to less secure area she was uncomfortable with the amount of attention being focused on her. So much so that it made her uncomfortable. She kept her eyes down, trying to ignore them, but didn't fight it this time when Papa picked her up. She hid her face in his chest. Her muscles relaxed at his comforting scent. She couldn't resist her reaction to the smell. It was so ingrained in her as something safe.
Their frustration with each other faded as the night wore on. They sunk into the comfort of their bond. Steve trembled when Tony breathed against his neck. He bared it to the alpha, gasping as the alpha’s teeth broke his skin, reclaiming him. Tony tenderly lapped the mark. The tension left Steve’s form instantly, his body going limp. He cried when he felt the alpha’s agony coursing through their bond. Steve turned so he was facing Tony. Those brown eyes were dull with grief.
Calling out was useless but he needed voice his want. Steve took hold of his arousal, rocking into his fist. Every stroke caused a pleasured friction but didn’t lessen the urge. With his free hand, he reached the slick soaked slit. He bit back moan as he played with the wet sensitized rim. Steve continued to work himself. His eyes closed as he tried picturing Tony stroking him to completion. Steve shivered as press two fingers in. He spread his leg, bringing the digits deeper, riding them. His imagination faltered. He nuzzled pillows hoping his alpha’s scent would help him reach release. Steve scissors himself open with his hand. A heat-driven fog set upon him. His fingers did nothing to fulfill the empty want. He adds another finger but it did nothing to take off the edge. There was no tricking his mind into believing his alpha was here. That knowledge only made him more desperate. He knocked Tony’s present to the floor.
Steve groaned. Tony knew the omega was underplaying it. Him mentioning meant it was bad. There was an hour until his meeting. It wasn't enough time to properly help Steve reach his needed orgasm. He could still.
Steve hadn’t thought of that. The idea of walking down it alone with all those eyes on him was uncomfortable. Most of them were strangers.
He relaxed a little when she left. Winter took the soft stuffed item from the floor. Its texture was foreign to him. It wasn't a weapon or tool. What was its purpose? It smelled wonderful. He'd encountered that scent before.
Her phone vibrated. Steve’s name appeared on the screen. It was the first time he'd contacted her since they found Piper. She didn't blame him. He had more important things to think about.
Tony closed his eyes, completely ignoring him. A silent flight with Tony Stark another first. Rhodes was almost tempted to sleep but didn’t. The first and last time he fell asleep in a private plane with Tony was when they were teenagers when he woke up; both his eyebrows were missing. Tony must have grown out of it by now. He closed his eyes, and sleep soon came.
Steve relaxed. His body was working with him to protect his baby. It was probably the reason the pup survived the Battle of New York.
Steve rolled his eyes, allowing the alpha to leave. He waited for the elevator doors to close, before going to Jarvis.
Thor launched Tony in the opposite direction. Steve didn’t react. Keeping a calm head was the answer to this.
Tony kissed both of them on the forehead before fading into sleep as well. Whining woke him only a few hours later. The smell instantly told him what was wrong with the infant. He groaned he'd been dreading this moment. When he took her from Steve, the omega's eyes snapped open. He snarled at him, tucking the pup closely to him. Several seconds went by before Steve realized it was him.
“That’s part of it. When I was young, I was so rarely allowed outside. My mother feared the pollen would cause issues with my asthma. Even after the serum, I never had a chance to enjoy weather like this."
Steve disappeared into his studio. Piper was out. The pup slept like a rock. It had been an hour. He went to check on Steve. The door was ajar. Steve had put down the underpainting. The color scheme with black and white with touches of blue. He recognized himself as the main subjection. Piper was in his arms. There was something so lifeless about it.
“Two years. Most alpha omega couples married by six or eight months? At least that was the norm during my time. Has it changed?” asked Steve.
Piper went to her room packing up her backpack. They took the subway there. Piper sighed dramatically when he dropped her off. She had her father’s sense of drama.
Hours later Steve came out of it. His head rested in Tony's lap, the alpha's fingers brushing through his hair. Steve's throat was dry and his eyes stung. He sat up. Tony was pale and looked drained. He couldn't imagine the sounds he must have been making for the alpha to look like that.
The alpha woke up. Before he had a chance to speak Tony’s lips were on his. He relaxed into the kiss, leaving his worries behind. Tony broke the kiss, letting their foreheads touch.
Piper gave placed her soft tiny hands into his large, strong ones, trusting. She watched as he wrapped them in the white athletic tape. Piper had seen Papa do this many times before. Winter did it the same exact way.
Piper was relatively cool toward them for the rest of the day. The only person she seemed warm to was Rune. It was better than no one. She went to bed with little complaint, not even requesting a story.
“I don’t know if you can tell but I’ve patterned my whole look after you. My hair doesn’t look right but there’s no product in it,” said Gary, taking off his hat.
Edith smiled. One small change to a pattern cause that much of a reaction. She pulled up the information from Stanly, sensors in the fabric having survived Piper's safety check. There was a spike in her adrenaline and norepinephrine. She needed to do a physical on Piper. For the time being, she would allow Piper to believe it was her choice.
He was foolish enough to think his alpha could actually take something seriously instead of making a joke out of it.
“Why? When so many others have died. I’ve had two chances. While some never got the chance,” he said.
"I expected the child's DNA to reflect a hybrid of human and super-soldier, but instead it's a full super-soldier. It's your body's way of protecting and granting the survival of your pup. If the pup was only half I believe there would be a high chance miscarriage,” said Bruce.
The beta took a submissive stance. He grabbed her by the neck, not tight enough to kill, but enough to bring fear. His shield grazing against her neck. She whined. He dropped her. She gasped for breath.
"She asked me to teach her about biology when I caught her not paying attention, she freaked. As if she thought I was going to hurt her."
Lena prepared her went to the observation room that looked into Winter and Piper’s cell. She started sweeping up the glass. There was a knock on the door.
“Yes, I’ve trained several agents.” He couldn't recall their names or faces, but he was sure it was something he'd done. They'd want him to pass down his skill and efficiency to others. All those others he'd taught had some baseline. The pup was a blank slate.
There was a thud on the roof. They readied for attack. Tony opened the cargo door, moving to the exit.
“Is this okay? I don’t want to make this harder than it has to be. I can go if you want,” said Steve.
“I believe the sooner, the better, but I can understand if you have reservations. Mr. Stark and I have already informed the S.H.I.E.L.D agents that will be keeping watch.”
Steve ran to him. The alpha had thrown on himself. Steve turned Tony on his side, clearing his air. He rubbed the alpha’s back. Tony threw up again.
She doodled in her notebook as Lena lectured. Only giving the woman half her attention. Lena snapped her ruler on her desk.
“I think I’m done with legos for today," said Piper, getting up from the floor. "Jarvis, is Rune awake?"
The alpha coiled back into his corner. For the first time, Piper caught the scent of distressed alpha. She was scaring him, but that didn't make sense. Each remained in their corners, processing each other.
"Steve has been suffering from morning sickness for the last three hours, but his hydration levels are fine," said Jarvis.
That's what he hoped. Then he could start a family with Peggy. It was a dream he so wanted at the time. His hand subconsciously traveled his stomach.
Steve hadn’t thought of taking Tony’s name. He didn’t think he could part with his name. His pup would carry the name Stark not him. He needed the connection to the past it gave him. “I’ll be keeping my name. May I ask you a personal question, Thor?”
The envelope was simply addressed, Steve. He traced the familiar chicken scratch handwriting. “What does it say?”
He tossed his clothes in the hamper. Tony got into the shower and sat on the bench. He spent an hour under the rain of water. When Steve fell, he was terrified by the lack of control and fear he felt at the moment. He hated that feeling way. Tony went to the bedroom. Steve was sitting, playing with the bedsheets.
She could have a home with Winter and Rune. And she’d accept them. It would be an odd misfit place, but they’d accept her no matter what. But their home wasn’t in this place. They’d find a new one.
Steve did not want to dig further into the subject. How easily Natasha could read a person could be disturbing at times. “What did you learn?”
Edith tried avoiding situations where she was left alone with Stark. She hadn't much occasion to be with him. She mostly worked with Steve and their appointments had become less frequent. Now she mostly worked as his gynecologist He only ever made an appointment with her if it were to replace the birth control implant in his arm.
"A large team will draw too much attention. It will be better to go in with a small squad. Natasha, Captain Rogers, one of my men, and I will make up that group. Rumlow you and your men will provide backup,” said Neema.
Winter's hands clenched. Remembering the many bruises, he found on the pup due to this man. The man believed it was for the betterment of the pup. His prosthetic arm creaked under the self-inflicted pressure.
Tony played with his hands unwilling to confront the conversation being held, but he couldn’t escape.
In an attempt to hurt her, Lena showed her hand. It stung and was crushing, but it gave Piper a location and that was something. Piper jumped down from the bed, carefully tiptoeing around the shards of broken glass scattered across the floor. Among the wreckage, she found a few markers. She went to the wall and started drawing.
“Happy’s number. Give him a call. He’ll take you wherever you want. I’ll make sure he’ll bring you some clothes and shoes,” said Tony. He flew out the window.
"Understood." The call ended. Hill mentally put together a to-do list. A knock the disrupted her train of thought.
Steve yawned. He kissed Tony. The taste of wine lingered on the alpha's lips. “You shouldn’t drink alone.”
"It's fine, Steve go talk to your doctor. Tell me next time when you're having a bad day. I need to know things. I'm a genius but I can't read your mind."
She stuck her tongue out at him. Tony copied the motion. Breakfast went well, and soon enough it was time to leave. Tony helped Piper into a red jacket with cat ears and pawprint pockets.
“She’s alive,” said Natasha. She pulled up the footage of a fireman carrying Piper out the building and disappearing behind a fire truck.
"I'm not sure." Were these new doubts and feelings only due to a failure in his programming? Or were they how he was meant to be?
“He had a mischievous clever gaze like he always knew something you didn’t. And possessed an effortless mysterious confidence. Like even once you got to know him he could still be a complete mystery,” said Steve. He turned red, realizing just how much of a type he had. Howard and Tony fell into the category, even Peggy did to some extent. Tony was smirking.
“I know it’s a little over the top sometimes. It’s not entirely my fault; he has a tend…he's… he's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon wherever that is. Anyway, the point is ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky subtly kinda had its day,” said Killian.
“Steve?” His husband pressed a kiss on Tony’s lips. He quickly welcomed the intimacy, but he had to break away. Taking in the self-inflicted damage to his lab. "I have to process that footage."
Steve's inner omega cringed at the idea of spending hours with alpha with wasn’t his mate while in heat, but with Clint’s help, they could leave sooner. “It’s fine."
“What are you doing? You’re going to break his finger. He’s injured. He’s in pain. Leave him alone,” said Tony. He was actually jealous of the armor. It was immune to the agony he was enduring.
They nodded. There was a flash of a camera. The owner seemed very proud to have served them. Tony went to pay.
"Sorry, caught in a thought, but I'll take you up on that offer. Come back here after I visit Peggy. If that's alright with you."
In the lab, Bruce and Tony studied the most recent data gathered. Bruce scanned over the cane. Tony’s mind was split in its interest. One curious of the scientist working beside him, the other with the subject he was here to study.
It hadn’t even crossed his mind as a possibility. That probably made it a perfect location. Antarctica was a wasteland, spotted with a few research facilities, and none of them capable of handling Piper.
Steve nodded, getting out his nesting couch. He followed the alpha to the lab. The three scientists were speaking rapidly in what seemed to be in a different langue.
Through all that time, she'd remained devoted to their friendship, no matter how hard he pushed her physically and mentally when they trained. How she managed to do that was beyond him. He wasn't the most personable alpha.
Steve jolted, darting to the hall bathroom. Tony followed closely behind him. Piper shrieked when he barged in his shield in hand. Relief swept through him when he saw she'd fallen into the toilet. They couldn't help laughing.
“I don’t know. They haven’t told me anything yet,” said Steve, dropping his head into his hands. Happy squeezed his shoulder.
“They were soldiers Tony they knew the risks. Mourning is normal, but you should be thankful that such men existed."
"At least I know where I stand with him. There are no mind games that leave me questioning what I should be doing. Or make me question my skills. He just has a lot of high expectations."
Eventually, Piper calmed. He sat on the floor with Piper in his arms. He sat there for two hours while she worked through her meltdown. Tony prayed she'd never have reason to make that wretched sound again. It was hallowing. Thankfully she'd found sleep. His shirt was covered snot and tears. The room stunk of distress. It was a chemical burnt floral smell.
She hadn’t realized her arms were still wrapped around his neck. Piper shook her head. Why was she doing this? They didn’t want her. Why was it so hard to let go?
A gentle round-faced omega came into the small waiting room. She had golden-brown hair tied in a high ponytail with a pink scrunchy. Her big brown doe eyes were deceivingly innocent.  In her ear were small-flowered shaped earnings. It would surprise many to know she used to be one of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s top field doctors, before retiring from fieldwork after injury.
When the call ended, Rumlow punched a wall. How was it that crazy bitch got away with murder and was still praised, yet he was the one to get scolded?
"Yes, and they are far more relatable for a child soldier, even though Piper and Rune started their training at a far younger age than most."
“There is such a wide variety. I couldn't possibly name all of them. My favorite has always been honey balls,” said Thor.
“And shoes?” Tony picked up several pairs of shoes. Piper pointed to a pair of red sequined shoes with little flowers along the band. He slipped them onto her tiny feet. She instantly grabbed at her sparkling toes, giving a happy squeal.
“Steve wanted me to inform you that he’s watching the Wizard of Oz with Thor in the media room. You are free to join him,” said Jarvis.
“Mr. Stark, I’m about to eat honey roast ham surrounded by the agency’s finest. The president is safe on air force along with Colonel Rhodes. I think we’re good here."
“Look I don’t want to clip your wings here. We’re both a little over-excited. I got an issue I'm chasing a bad guy. I'm trying to grab a little something. Some hard creed data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof recalibrate the ISDN and pump up by about forty percent,” he said.
“I handle it myself. Put my sheets in the laundry room and showered. There was no point in waking you and daddy up.”
Curiosity getting the best of her, Piper peaked around Winter’s leg, taking a good look at the woman. Her scent was gentle and welcoming. It made Piper long for the comfort of Papa's scent. Her eyes were dark brown, and light brown hair cut short. She wore a yellow shirt, khaki pencil skirt, and clogs, with a white doctor's coat on top. The woman didn't look dangerous; yet, appearances meant nothing here.
"It will be here sooner than you know and it's never too early to start teaching self-defense," said Nat.
“I was scared!” Tony’s expression softened slightly. “I was terrified of being pregnant. We've never discussed children. I thought I might lose you-
“Pull up Steve’s vital from his episode,” said Tony. They appeared in front of him. Tony had his version of a basic understanding of human anatomy. “How do his vitals compare to others with PTSD?”
And just like that, the alpha snapped out of feral state. Steve laid on his uninjured side. She numbed the area. Tony held his hand the entire time, running his fingers through his hair.
"I was five and half when Howard took me to see it. He wasn't much for rating. My mom was so angry when I woke up crying in the middle of the night talking about sharks. Howard ended up sleeping on the couch for the rest of the night."
“I don’t know but one thing I can promise is that it will be a lot better than here. So, will you help me? Or at least not tell them.”
She shook her head. Tony sighed. Getting close to what was hurting her wasn't going to be easy. Still, he felt as if he'd earned some footing with her.
Natasha nodded. Steve hesitated before leaving the mansion. His omega screamed at to stay in the sanctuary of his den and to wait for his alpha to return. With the suppressants, it was easier to resist that side of himself. He got into the car with Natasha. Steve blushed when Natasha leaned over and scented him.
Breakfast sounded good. He always had room to eat. He went to the café, filled a tray with food. The only other thing he had to do today was meet with Dr. Turner. When he finished, he went to Turner’s office. The beta was in his always-relaxed state. He took a seat on the cushy leather couch.
"No, me and Daddy used to do this all the time. He'd put fake code in Jarvis for me to breakthrough. It became a game. We're fine, Rune." If anyone were going to get in trouble, it would be her.
Natasha sat in a high-end bar, hidden from mainstream social rings. She was perched on an art deco bar stool, silently studying customers. The room smelled of big money from around the world. Bets were being placed. Liquor was flowing. At the center of the room was a caged arena. Two large alphas with prosthetic limbs sat in either corner, waiting for the bell.
Tears were streaming down his face. His muscles were tensed, and his fists were clenched. He had a white-knuckle grip on the bedsheets. Tony couldn’t let Steve suffer.
Whenever or wherever Piper was, she was safe; knowing that was enough to calm him. He was in a cell drenched in warm orange-hued light. After freezing, he was always thrown into a room like this to defrost. He always enjoyed the process, laying under the giant heat lamp for days, as the heavy stiffness faded from his limbs. Without this given time, motor function, reflexes, and thinking were slowed. The newer versions didn’t have to endure the procedure. It was their loss.
They talked for an hour before he left. For thirty minutes, he was left alone in the room. Was the next alpha coming?  He frowned. The door opened. He scowled when he saw Phil.
Steve sighed. The risk was minimal. He could easily leave whenever he wanted. If he stayed out any longer he risked drawing attention to himself.
The emotion was nearly overwhelming. Tears leaked free. Tony only broke free of the shock when Steve wiped them away. Tony kissed Steve's hand.
"Pregnancy is draining, even more so when you're growing a baby super-soldier. Have you had any problem leaving home?” asked Edith.
Tony smiled. It was like seeing Steve for the first time again. Nothing could make the omega more perfect to him.
“I’m not going anywhere." The omega's hold on his hand only lessened slightly. “Ho Yinsen, a doctor kidnapped to take care of me. When I woke up as one of his Frankenstein projects. I was hooked up to a car battery. I don’t know how I didn’t die from infection, given the conditions. They wanted me to build weapons. I refused, and they tortured me."
Steve bit back his frustration. This was Tony's main deflection technique. Tony was upset with him but now wasn't the time. Their issues could be put aside while they dealt with the greater good. He needed the alpha to be serious and actually listen to him. Whatever personal issues they were having they could wait.
Tony waited for Steve to sleep. A positive side effect of Steve's pregnancy was rest came easier to the omega. He didn't so frequently suffer from night terrors. He ran a tender hand over Steve's round stomach and was greeted by a gentle kick against his palm.
"I can't." He was sure Tony's party would outdo those of his father. The party scene was not his place. At them, he was a wallflower trying that trying desperately to go unnoticed. Bucky would drag him onto the dance floor and try to get him to dance. He always retreated as soon as he could.
Steve would have been embarrassed about their current situation if it weren't so fulfilling. He moaned as Tony’s hold tightened as they worked through his second orgasm before his knot deflated. Steve whined at the separation as his pull away from him.
The next seventy-two hours were key. She’d have to keep an eye on caged pair, as leaving in them in the hands of techs would end failure. Everything was fragile. Lena sighed. She would have to remain here a bit longer. Helmut was due for leave. Part of her wished Helmut would retire but he was at the peak of his military career head of special forces unit. She would miss his return home. Lena picked up her phone. It was best to tell him sooner. Hopefully, he would be in range. The phone rang several times before he picked up.
He followed Steve’s gaze to a blonde female alpha. Tony hated the way she looked at Steve. He snarled. Was she the alpha that left their scent on his omega?!
Tony turned on the news. He always watched CNN or MSNBC. When Steve asked of other news channels he turned on FOX News to prove its idiocy after five minutes he grew frustrated and told Jarvis to block the channel. It left the alpha in a mood for a good ten minutes. Tony was the most liberal alpha he’d ever met. It was refreshing.
“Come on, there’s a lot for you to learn,” said Winter. He walked out of the room without hesitation, and waited for her in the hall. Piper froze at the doorway.
“Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?” The simple task of breathing was becoming a difficult task.
The pieces clicked together. They weren’t only after his help, but Tony’s as well. Steve remembered reading over some notes on the Avengers Initiative.
“What’s there to explain?! For the longest time, I thought Howard’s feelings were one-sided but apparently they were shared. Don’t lie to me and say they weren’t!” growled Tony.
The voices of the new casters grew annoying. He flipped through the channels until the screen became a blur of gray, white, black, enjoying the white noise it provided.
After the night he had he sleep was a great thing. His arm wrapped firmly around the alpha. He sighed as the alpha ran his fingers through his air. Steve purred.
She didn’t invade his space any further. Piper sat down waiting for him to come to her. She forced herself to be still. For two hours she remained perfectly still waiting for him to come to her. He got up offering her his arm.
They'd never taken her on a plane. The hours ticked by, and eventually, it was time to leave. Steve gingerly took Piper out of her car seat. He followed his husband onto the plane. Steve settled in the seat next to Tony. The alpha leaned over, checking if Piper was asleep. As soon as they took off, Piper's eyes snapped open. She screamed at the top of her lungs.
