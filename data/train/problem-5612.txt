“C’mon, Stark. Pop a squat,” Sam said carefully, kicking over a chair in Tony’s direction, “You too, Cap. It isn’t pretty.”
“He likes you fine. You are overthinking these things--just because he cries when you hold him does not mean he does not like you. He is an infant. He is going to cry,” Tony soothed.
“Bruce, what kind of stuff should the kid have? He was literally kept in a huge tube, so I don’t know if he needs, like, a bassinet—”
Letting Steve have his moment, Tony pulled away, resting against PJ’s bed. He carefully observed the two, noting how the tension in the Captain’s shoulders dissipated the longer PJ hugged him. Eventually, they pulled apart, both seeming a little perkier and a lot less upset.
Slowly, Tony heaved himself out of bed, careful to not disturb the Prime as he wobbled into the bathroom. A warm bath was in order to relax his muscles and clean off his sweat-dried skin. It took a bit to get himself undressed and into the tub, but as soon as he sank into the steaming water he sighed in bliss, almost instantly relaxed. He closed his eyes and let his mind wander as he soaked, testing out the new bond that filled his heart. It was like a heavy rock had been forced into the organ, taking up space that it was not meant to fill. However, it was not uncomfortable, and when he concentrated on it, he felt warm and tingly, like he was sitting in front of a fire on a cold night.
This was getting nowhere. He sighed and dropped his hand completely, looking away when Steve made a hurt noise again. There was no way he was going to be able to calm Steve down, and with Peter in his arms, he was not going to do much more than touch the man’s chest. It was frustrating, but Tony pressed a kiss to the baby’s head anyway, thankful that the little one was still calm amidst the chaos.
He grit his teeth at the thought and planted his forehead against Bruce’s back. Sweat rolled down his back, uncomfortably plastering his shirt to his skin. Peter whimpered and he shushed him, closing his eyes against the headache that was beginning to form.
was written on the bottom in Jarvis’ familiar script. Tony couldn’t help but smile as he flipped through the first few pages, seeing pictures of him and Maria playing together. Of course, the rare photos of him with Howard were at press conferences, with Maria holding him and Howard giving the camera a fake smile.
Tony, he just happens to be a big dense oaf sometimes. He’s genuinely so head over heels he has trouble thinking straight—no pun intended.”
Steve cocked his head to the side, but Tony’s stomach made its presence know and the Prime smiled and nodded. He gestured toward the door, jogging over to open it for Tony. The hiss did not go unnoticed, so as he passed, Tony sympathetically put a hand on the spot where Steve had hit the wall.
“This one is the best,” he decided, taking off his backpack and pulling out a box of crayons and a notebook before hanging the bag up on a hook in the cubby.
“You are very cute when you do that,” he admitted, seeing a bit of himself in the expression, “You look like a kicked puppy. Not that
Steve laughed again, a warm depth to the sound that made Tony’s arm hair stand on end. He never wanted to hear it end, but of course, PJ grunted between them, a tiny hand coming up to pat on Steve’s face.
“Finally,” Tony sighed, thunking his head back against the bed, “Hospital food is nasty, even across the pond.”
“We’re here,” she said softly, leading him into one of the classrooms, “Why don’t you look around and meet some of the other children, darling? I need to talk to your teacher for a minute.”
“Intelligence,” Natasha answered, her voice suddenly soft, “By year one, he was able to form simple complete sentences and count to twenty his own. For his age, that’s incredible.”
“You get what I give you, and nothing more. If you come before I say you can, you will be sleeping in the hallway tonight.”
“Nothing, Tony, I’m alright,” Steve answered, swirling around the slowly melting ice cream in his tub, “Just having an off day, I suppose.”
Steve panted and tried to not move too much, afraid of Tony pulling away or Peter unlatching on accident. He whimpered and Tony scraped his teeth over the glands, licking his lips as he leaned back.
“Oh, gods,” Tony muttered under his breath, ditching modesty to try and help the clearly agitated man, “Come now, I am not
“You don’t have to tell me everything now, sweetheart. You only just woke up,” he said, his voice bordering on a croak, “You should rest, yeah? Get some sleep?”
Already feeling sick at the thought, Tony took another breath, making a secondary note to create a vomit protocol for when he was outside of the suit.
“You really outdid yourself this time, Stark,” he murmured to himself, attempting to crane his neck to see the stitching where his GPS chip used to be, “Real good job you did, asshole.”
“C’mon, I know you’ve been holding back this whole time, let go, sweet thing. It’s okay,” he continued, thumbing at Steve’s cockhead, “I’ve got you, you’re okay, come for me, Steve—”
“I guess we are going bare this morning, baby,” he said, shifting Peter up to his shoulder, “At least it will be easier for you to feed.”
“Honey, your milky tits are making too much for one thermos,” Tony snorted, rolling his eyes, “Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.”
“Yeah, me too,” Tony agreed, reaching over to put his hand on PJ’s back to help the boy settle on Steve’s chest, “Me too.”
Taking a careful breath, Tony steeled himself against the bait in favor of looking down at PJ with a warm smile.
“Uh, we aren’t—we aren’t romantically involved, Colonel,” Steve said plainly, not quite meeting either of the men’s gazes, “Tony’s made—his intentions are pretty clear that he wants to keep things platonic between us, and I respect that.”
Steve’s blush rose onto his cheeks and the tips of his ears, making him hot enough to let go of Tony’s hand to rub the back of his neck awkwardly.
“That’s not what I meant,” Steve replied, his mouth flattening into something resembling a strained grimace.
“Actually, he’s been the one carrying up these boxes. JARVIS had some stuff delivered express,” Pepper corrected, finally taking her eyes off the boy, “He’s probably down in the guest room by your bedroom building things and setting stuff up.”
His voice cracked and he bit his lip to hold back the swell of emotion that tightened his throat. Gods, what was
“Okay. If you need me, tell Nat, and I’ll come right away, I promise,” He soothed, “Go eat, pumpkin. I’ll be back.”
Tony did as he was told, pulling over a lab stool and moving the finished phlebotomy equipment. Carefully, he picked up PJ’s small hand, lightly holding it in his own. Somewhere along the way, he got lost in his own thoughts, looking down at the child with an expression caught between worry and adoration. Shaking himself out of the haze, Tony picked up Bruce’s clipboard, looking down at the measurements.
Steve growled and picked up his pace until he could hear the bed frame start to slam repetitively against the wall. He allowed himself to look down, watching his cock disappear into Tony with an ungodly squelching noise that really should not be turning him on as much as it was.
He turned to find his husband cowering up against the wall, pale and looking more nauseous by the second. He immediately wrenched the water off, crushing the handle slightly in his haste to alleviate the situation.
“Good job, that’s exactly what it’s for,” He praised, choosing to smile down at PJ, “You’re a real natural. Soon, you’ll have to give
He answered with a right hook, to which Steve grabbed his oncoming wrist with the opposite hand and turned himself around, throwing Tony’s chest to his back. In one fluid motion, he upturned Tony over his shoulder and let him gracelessly slam onto his back on the floor.
He watched Steve’s lips tighten into a line, but the other didn’t make a comment. Suddenly feeling a bit awkward after lying there for nearly a half hour, Tony moved to climb back out of the bed, intent on moving PJ back to his bed. At the slight bit of movement, the babe’s eyes snapped open and he immediately started to whimper, sitting up as he looked at Tony.
“Steve,” Tony interrupted gently, reaching over the bed to curl his hand around the Captain’s wrist, “Just ask the staff to bring a second bed. You can stay.”
If the folder hadn’t been bright blue, Tony would have missed it. It was sort of shoved under some machinery on his desk, but it was nearly falling off anyway, so he barely got to it in time before it slipped off. Looking at it, he realized there was a sticky note on it in his husband’s handwriting:
“No! No, I--I am sorry, come here, please,” Tony said quickly as he sat up and tucked his legs under himself.
Tony groaned as he was lifted up and put onto what he assumed was a stretcher, blinking slowly up at the sun. Or flashlight. Or whatever that bright thing in his vision was.
“Please,” he begged, mustering up his best puppy dog eyes as he looked up at her, “Please don’ put ‘em in time out. It was my fault they were play fightin’, promise. Don’ put ‘em in time out—”
“As far as we can tell, the serum has been healing him and will continue to do so,” the nurse—Shelly—replied softly, “He just needs to take it easy until he can build up more bone mass and some muscular strength. Regular physical therapy should help, as well as a good diet. If anything comes up or seems irregular, bring him right back down. We can have a bed open for him at all times for a few months, just in case.”
bastard of a father. You made your choice in good faith, Steven. Even if you could not say that yourself, the others have been quick to tell me about how good you are. Was it surprising and scary? Of course. But so was taking my son and running into the wilderness. And I do not regret that decision one bit.”
As they walked, Steve tried to point out more stalls to investigate, but Tony was drawn to a small group of older women sitting in a circle with baskets overflowing with flowers around them. He ignored Steve’s chatter and carefully approached the women, unsure if he was welcome. Once he was close enough, they stopped talking and turned to look at him, only to burst into excited chatter and gather around, peering and cooing at the baby. Peter peeked up over Tony’s shoulder at the women, seemingly unbothered by the commotion.
“This is all fairly new,” he admitted, running a shaky hand through his usually perfectly coiffed hair, “God, Bruce, I’m drowning, and I know the instant that I sit down, stop moving, and just
“I do not know how to explain, but I am not his mother,” Tony tried, putting on the underwear up under his drying cloth and letting the cloth finally drop to the floor, “I will have Thor explain sometime.”
Tony watched as PJ closed his eyes, not making a sound as Bruce quickly and expertly took a few vials of blood. An uncomfortable feeling wormed its way into Tony’s chest when the child didn’t seem to notice that Bruce had put the plaster on his arm, leaving his arm stretched out on the bed.
Steve turned and pointed at the boy playing with the dinosaurs in the dollhouse, beaming when Bucky looked up and waved enthusiastically at him. Once he saw the smile light up Steve’s face, Tony decided he would do everything in his power to keep that smile only for himself.
“I still don’t get why he likes you the best,” Clint sighed, sitting down in one of the hospital chairs, “I mean, I’m clearly the cool one. I can juggle. Why aren’t I the favorite?”
“Shh, honey, shit, I broke you,” Tony murmured, cupping Steve’s face to keep wiping away his tears, “Honey, that was over 25 years ago, it’s over, I haven’t felt like that in a
Fighting every instinct to take Tony right there, Steve had to carefully lay himself down as not to accidentally squish the Omega under his weight. He took Tony’s hand in his own and kissed his knuckles, selfishly taking the opportunity to kiss down his wrist and arm, up to his neck and cheek until he was hovering just above his lips. He could feel Tony’s breath mingling with his own, but guilt squeezed his throat and he backed down, instead ducking his head into the man’s neck. He could only take so much longer; Tony was tantalizing, teasing him and staying just out of his grasp where he could claim him. He
“Middle of who-the-fuck-knows Florida. I had to leave behind the War Machine suit so I could infiltrate the base, steal a uniform, and try to get you out. Finding you and commandeering the truck was easy, but the second HYDRA guard wasn’t in the plan, so that’s on me,” Rhodey sighed, “I didn’t have my comm on me to tell the others, either, since it was in the suit. For you, other than the neck wound, nothing’s too badly banged up, save for your chest injuries. I had to do some emergency stitching when we got back, but I got word to Steve and I was able to staunch the bleeding until he got here to help. So, other than that, you might have bruising on your back from fainting in the truck and hitting the back divider at a good 85 miles an hour.”
“Goodnight, my love. Sleep well,” he whispered quietly, backing up to blow out the surrounding candles.
Rhodey interrupted him with a startled laugh, making Bucky turn around to see Tony flipping him off from the couch. Bucky simply flipped it back despite knowing that Tony couldn’t see him.
Dreams of bloodied eagles falling from the sky had him tossing and turning all night. Pained whimpers fell from his lips until something forced him to wake up with a sharp gasp. He quickly realized that it was Steve’s hand on his arm that had startled him, so he relaxed back down onto his makeshift bed with a sigh.
“So run this by me again. They were creating an army of Avenger children?” Clint asked, sitting on one of the few pieces of furniture that had not been destroyed in the attack.
He nodded and let his head loll back, momentarily wondering if Steve could open a window to let the draft in; after a second, the hand left his arm and he was scooped up, tucked back into the hot bed and propped up on more pillows that seemed to appear out of the air.
He swallowed his nerves and made to stand, clamping down on his urge to cry out from moving. Gods, it
“Alright. The last thing is your face, sweet cheeks. If you have an attack, it’s okay, I’m right here and Papa’s right outside,” Tony said calmly, re-soaking the cloth and twisting out as much water as possible, “I’m going to make this as quick as possible, then you’ll be ready for bed.”
“Bogey! One o’clock!” Steve yelled into the radio, watching something large shoot up out of the smoke and sail toward them.
“Fine,” he decided, turning to shrug on his lab coat and latex gloves, “If Nat will wait, so will I. But you’ll need to—”
Until, stripped down to naught but a towel tucked around his waist, he opened his bathroom door to see the team engineer fiddling with his shower, tongue poking out of his mouth in concentration as he worked.
Steve was about as red as a spring poppy and starting to smell of embarrassment, which made Tony giggle and put a hand on Steve’s cheek.
Thankfully, it had not caused any rift between him and the Alpha. Steve was quite aware of his tendency to cave into Peter and Tony could not blame him; the boy was damn cute. Every day Peter looked more and more like him but with Mary’s round face and dimpled cheeks. It brought a twinge to his heart each time he thought of his late friend, so he kept that feeling tucked away from the bond, hoping and praying to the gods that Peter never felt his father’s guilt.
Steve grumbled at that, not answering in favor of stuffing his face with more ice cream. Before he could scoop up more, the tub was plucked from his hands and replaced with Tony’s concerned face.
“They wanted to know if we had killed you and the child,” Steve answered with a frown, “However, they did not ask it in a way that was… angry? It was more of a cordial question than a demand.”
“Of course. She always loves a challenge. Perhaps I will bring her to the states sometime so you two can meet. That is, if the Captain allows me. He may want to prevent you two from staying in your workshop any longer than you already seem to be.”
“I am merely figuring out how to take you to the mat without embarrassing you too much, your grace.”
Steve sighed and got off of him; Tony took the opportunity to hustle his ass out of the ring and unwrap his hands. The tension in the air stung his nose to the point that he moved away from them again, only to relax once he was in the presence of Rhodey and Peter.
Staring at the ceiling, he was absolutely certain he looked starry-eyed, but he couldn’t care less, considering only JARVIS could see him, and he figured the AI wouldn’t say anything. The smile stayed on his face for all of five seconds, before the doubt kicked in.
, he thought to himself as he stripped down and hung his clothes on a tree branch. His thighs already felt sticky, so he hurried into the water and was surprised to find that it was relatively warm.
“Are you sure you’re alright? You’re wincing, Tony,” Steve said, shifting his body sideways despite PJ’s whines, “Is that better?”
“They are all… quite nice, actually. You would be surprised,” he said, “Really. I mean it. They do not care about same-designation relationships. They are sort of like one big family, and we got folded into it. I...I think I am happy here, Rhodes. At least, I think I would be happier here than back with Howard.”
Tony sighed and turned to find Bruce standing behind him, smiling when he saw the wistful look on the doctor’s face. A small question wormed its way into his head, but he tucked it away, figuring that he may not get an answer if he were to ask Bruce outright.
“And what about PJ?” Bucky asked, motioning with his head toward the child, “You already got grabbed once, just outside the Tower.”
He worked the soap and lathered up his hands before beginning to massage Steve’s right arm, gently washing away the dried-up war paint. Steve was silent while he worked, only uttering the occasional grunt when Tony found a knot in his muscles. Not wanting the man to suffer, Tony easily teased them loose, shivering at Steve’s barely-repressed moans.
“My father would find me. He has eyes and ears everywhere, so nowhere except these lands are safe. He is too… frugal to put men at risk by tracking me up this way. If all goes as planned, he will announce my death in a fortnight’s time and I will be able to live freely,” Tony explained softly, gently easing Peter out of his bundle so he could hold the baby up against his chest, tucking his head into his neck, “I have friends who still live there so if I ever return, I could stay safe, but…”
Careful to not scare Steve off, Tony held out his hand, waiting until the Warlord was close enough to gently touch his hip. He held him steady and, upon seeing that Steve was not going to cart him off and ravish him, peeled off his ruined bandage to reveal the red wound underneath.
“Oh, baby, how I missed you,” Tony purred, “Okay, Steve. You’re taking PJ and sitting in the back with him in your lap.”
Of course, Steve woke up first, just before the pilot announced their descent and a reminder to fasten their seatbelts. With a soft smile, he gently roused Tony from his nap, kissing his forehead gently to help him adjust to his surroundings.
“They want to see what you’re holding, to make sure it is nothing dangerous,” Thor explained quietly, gently touching Tony’s upper arm, “Please, show them.”
“That’s good. If he didn’t have amnesia then, he most likely won’t have it when he wakes up. He may be afraid, though. We’ll be monitoring the whole time, but if something happens, ring for the nurse and we’ll come running. Now, there’s one last thing to discuss, but we’d like to tell you privately, Captain, if that’s alright?”
He slowly packed up his lunchbox and blanket and everything else he’d used that day, zipping up his backpack with a slow
“Agh! No! No, no, keep your little grubby hands to yourself, you need a bath before you go near anyone—look what you’ve done, Steve,” Tony griped, “Ugh, fine. I love you too, you big lug. Tell Nat to hurry up the jet so I can kiss you sooner.”
Steve narrowed his eyes, but relented, sitting up to zip off his boots and dump them off the side of the bed before maneuvering himself under the sheets. PJ managed a small smile as he snuggled up to the other’s chest, immediately attracted to the warmth. The boy let out a small yawn and settled down with one small hand clutching at Steve’s tank top. Tony stared at the scene, a flutter of something pleasant rising in his chest.
“I’m alright, sweet thing,” Tony soothed through grit teeth, “Just a little achy. Why don’t you sit with Papa, hm? He’s much comfier.”
He zoned in and out until it was time to get up, and even then, he struggled to focus. He felt like he was made of stone, heavy and clumsy as he let Steve take him and Peter back into the bedroom. First, Peter was dressed and put down in his bassinet, already fast asleep with his new doll tucked in next to him. Just watching the babe sleep put the final nail in the coffin; exhausted, Tony fell onto Steve’s bed, starfished out despite not having put on any new garments. A choked noise sounded somewhere off to his left, so he flapped an arm out until Steve took his hand. He pulled and rolled onto his back, no doubt having surprised the other with his strength since the bed bounced as if Steve had fallen and caught himself.
It felt like the breath in his lungs turned into ice. He had not had Peter for very long, but to think about not having him in arm’s length for anything longer than a night scared him to his core. This was
One touch intensified the pain to that of a thousand suns; his back bowed off of the bed as a scream was ripped from his throat. Distantly he heard a door slam open and multiple shadows hovered over him, but before he could tell them Steve needed help, Steve was in
The thought that Peter could sense his emotions was already a bit frightening, but after hearing the doctor’s observation, Tony wondered how strong their bond really was. Sure, he could sense when Peter was upset, but babies did not have very many emotions to express in the first place.
“I know, sweetheart. I know,” Steve murmured back, hugging Tony close with one hand on the back of his neck, “It’ll all be okay, you’ll see. You’ll be so busy making friends and changing the world that you’ll barely have time to miss your trophy husband.”
There was a murmur of agreement, and with a nod from Natasha, the group began to collect into their teams and split, leaving Tony with Steve and Clint in the living room. Looking at the various papers still scattered, Tony grumbled under his breath about running a bed and breakfast, picking up the loose sheets.
Tony reached up himself to touch his cheek, eyes wide with surprise. Thankfully, Miss Hill called for naptime before he could respond, so he could file it away for dealing with later. He and Steve walked hand-in-hand back into the building, helping each other set up their cots before grabbing their blankets from their cubby. Secretly, Tony grabbed his fluffy rabbit from his backpack, keeping it tucked under his blanket so the other kids wouldn’t be able to see it. He wasn’t a
Unfocused, familiar brown eyes blinked back at him, confused and concussed, given the pupil dilation.
He grinned cheekily and flexed his arms, kissing each of his biceps and waggling his eyebrows at Tony.
He smacked the up button probably harder than he needed to, but he was still reeling from trying to comprehend and file away the past hour. Once the elevator doors opened, he made sure PJ got in before stepping in himself, all too aware of being in an enclosed space with Steve. Feeling more panic settle in his chest, Tony swallowed nervously, attempting to keep his nausea at bay. After a second, a small tug on his jeans had him look down; PJ was grasping tightly to his pant leg, looking up at him with a curious face.
“Oh no,” was all Tony managed before Bucky growled and leaped, causing the engineer to scream as he was tackled, and they rolled around the floor. Clint patted Steve’s shoulder consolingly, smirking as the Captain buried his pink face in his hands. Watching the scene unfold, Natasha sighed and turned on her heel, grabbing up her hat to dump the excess papers onto the floor before leaving the room with a small smile.
Bruce had laughed and Tony had shrugged it off, but now that they stood outside with Peter asleep in his arms, he could not help but think about what he said. Since Steve had left, Tony had found himself craving the Alpha’s scent, even though he had never really noticed it before. He cuddled Steve’s pillows, slept in his clothes, and buried himself in Steve’s bed to try and keep the smell on him for as long as possible.
If Peter was opposed to his plan, he made no comment on it, as he complied with wriggling into his new clothes and being laid down. Satisfied that the baby was set and safe, Tony rummaged through the closet until he found new underwear and one of Steve’s few shirts. Out of habit, he looked around before putting the fabric to his nose and inhaling deeply, allowing the scent of the Prime to ease the tension in his body. The shirt went on, and though it only hung to mid-thigh, Tony decided to skip pants for the time being. He much preferred wearing Steve’s larger clothes and there were no pants or skirts of the Alpha’s that would stay up on his smaller frame.
“He asked for me,” Tony said quietly, “He… he saw the scarring on my back, and said if I was to stay, he wanted to take care of me. Of
“Yeah, fuck, Tony, s’good,” Steve pulled back to pant, ducking his face into Tony’s neck, “Tha’s so good honey, love y’hands, perfect, perfect hands—”
“Do—Do we have another Tony Stark? Holy—goodness, is he yours?” Bruce finally asked disbelief etched into his features.
, just call out for me. I’m right next door and can be over in a jiffy, okay? Everything’s okay now, honey. I know you’re in a weirdo place with weirdo people you probably still don’t trust too well, but we’ll take care of you. We’ll keep you safe, I promise.”
“Be nice,” Steve scolded, “Maybe I said it was my favorite. I have it often enough that it could be….”
“Yeah, sure. You and your super soldier metabolism are going to take all my crumbs,” Tony grunted, licking his fingers free of jelly before moving to wash his hands and carefully clean the reactor, “How did he go down? Fussy?”
“Better,” Tony answered, padding into the room, “Nat’s feeding him. I came in search of clothes and maybe a few books to try and entertain him while we all try to discuss what we’re doing.”
Perhaps it was the familiar tone Steve generally reserved for battle—or simply the man’s presence—that made Tony gulp down a deep breath, forcing himself to hold it in his lungs for as long as he could before slowly breathing out. Hearing how shaky the breath was, Tony closed his eyes, attempting another deep breath, and another, until the air passing his lips was steady. Finding himself curled up tight, he slowly forced his shoulders to drop and his legs to fall, loosening his muscles.
It happened constantly, whether the team intended to offend him or not. Clint would take the remote out of his hand when he was trying to remember how to change to the HDMI port, Bruce would pat him on the back and tell him that “not all of us can get the hang of technology like Tony”, and even Thor would skip over explaining Asgardian technology—but at least that was to the team as a whole.
hoping he recognizes you or Steve. Less because of who you are, but more of because your eyes will be familiar to him. But that’s the best case scenario. Worst case is he absolutely freaks out since he won’t know where he is or who any of us are and we have to subdue him.”
“Would you two stop comparing penis sizes over there? I’m trying to listen to Jane ask about shaving,” Pepper hissed from the other side of Tony, kicking his desk.
Tony sniffled and shook his head, attempting to convey that he was not worried about safety any longer, but the Prime seemed to understand and moved his hand to Tony’s shoulder to squeeze before dropping altogether. He peered at Tony’s face, and once he managed to collect himself and shift the baby to his other shoulder, the Prime nodded, beckoning to him.
Tony paused at that, feeling more shame heat his cheeks and spread down his neck. He did not want Steve to hurt, it was not
“Sure, babe. Just hold him tight. And buckle,” Tony snorted, moving the seat back and shutting the door before going around to the driver’s side.
“Not really. I just know what flavor of bull you deal in,” she answered, grinning as he laughed, “Now, let me see my little nephew.”
Steve fell into place next to him and laid a hand on his lower back, but whether it was meant to be comforting or possessive, Tony could not tell. His touch
“I dunno. Probably Ma’s shepherd’s pie,” he said, not seeing Tony start to smirk and Bucky and Clint growing progressively annoyed, “She used to mix lamb and beef, since lamb was way too expensive to buy for the full recipe, and we’d have colcannon on top, but it was more cabbage than potato, for the same reason.”
The Alpha had redressed in his garb and held out a large cloth in his arms, motioning toward Peter. He took a step forward, but Tony immediately backed up, staring him down until Steve got the idea. He nodded and handed the cloth over, allowing Tony to nervously snatch it away and bundle the baby up. Only once was Peter swaddled did he get out of the bath, careful of his steps out of the slippery tub. Steve stood there and watched, then offered up another cloth for him to dry down with.
Steve hummed and beckoned him over, ducking into his closet to pull out a large wooden trunk. He propped open the lid and dug around before coming up with an armful of items. First, he settled a pair of leather moccasins by Tony’s feet, and upon deciding that they would fit, helped Tony slide into them and tied them around his ankles.
“Studying,” Tony lied easily, having told it multiple times over already, “Tasha was helping me with some stuff. Hey, have you thought about asking Coach if you could be his assistant? You’ve always been good at where we should be on the field and who should be doing what. And it’d keep you with us for games and stuff.”
“Yeah. He’ll need a draw,” Tony sighed, running his fingers through the child’s tangled locks, “I was unconscious for an undetermined period of time before they let me see him, so I don’t know what they did to him, if anything. He hasn’t complained about hurting or anything, but then again, I don’t know if he’d even tell us if it hurt. J hasn’t set off the alarm for bugging yet, so I’m hoping we can assume they didn’t put any tracker on him…but I want to be sure, y’know?”
“T’Challa and Bucky will explain more on the way over, but you guys need to do some uncover in some local nomadic tribes to see where sand dunes have been disturbed or whatever. From the plans Shuri sent over, we can see only one visible entrance, and even I can see that it’s a complete trap. Clint and Bucky suspect there’s something under the sand, so asking around is our best shot. T’Challa has a super out there he knows and is going to talk to, but for now, you and Nat and the others will be digging around. Perhaps literally.”
Once the elevator doors were shut and Tony knew they were secure, he let out a sigh of relief, feeling his shoulders sag from the tension leaving them. He turned to his left slightly, nodding over his right shoulder.
“I thought he was never going to go back to sleep,” Steve admitted quietly, an odd expression on his face as he glanced between Tony and the babe, “You’re good with him. It’s incredible.”
After some maneuvering and a few close calls, Tony managed to get the suit off and into sentry mode, now cradling the child close to his own chest without disturbing the arc reactor. Bouncing slightly on his heels, he moved in circles around the room, hoping that he didn’t accidentally wake the child.
“Is it too hot?” Steve asked, sticking his hand under, “It’s just like you like it. Do you want it differently? …Tony?”
turn on my knees, and I plan on bedding him someplace where I can chain him up so he cannot turn it back onto me.”
“You’ll catch bugs if you keep your mouth open, Stark,” Sam snickered, earning a shove from Natasha.
He glared at Steve until the Alpha dropped his head and sighed. He did not want to be harsh, but if they were going to make their family unit work, Steve needed to step up into his parental role and begin to build a relationship with Peter. And yet, he knew how scary the feeling of being thrown into parenthood was, and the fear of accidentally hurting a tiny human. As he slipped an arm around Steve’s waist, Tony leaned against his arm and smiled at Peter, hoping that he could comfort both of his boys.
As soon as his feet touched down, he stumbled off for the meeting place, careful to hold his necklace so it would not jingle and alert any of the patrolling guards. Thankfully, it was a new moon, providing him with the necessary darkness needed to dart from place to place. It was a practiced escape, but his heart still hammered wildly in his chest: enough so that he was afraid that someone would be able to hear it and find him out. Of course, he reached the city’s wall without issue, panting silently as he pressed up against the carefully carved stone, hiding in the shadows. The agonizing moments ticked on without sight of his partners, but just as he was about to give up, two sets of footfalls ran toward him from the right, and a quiet whistle signaled their arrival. He moved quickly toward the sound and found them, holding his arms out for the bundle passed to him.
After batting away Steve’s offered hand, Tony dragged himself to his feet to ready up again. Sure, he was in pain, but he had handled a bit of pain before and shoved the feeling down. He barely gave Steve the time to put his fists up properly before flying at him again with a feigned hook into a solid gut punch. If Steve had been a weaker man, he would have collapsed, but his tight abdomen easily took the blow and had Tony pulling away with a hiss to cradle his knuckles.
Tony rolled onto his side and tucked himself up against Steve’s chest, taking a moment to breathe in his calming scent and bask in his warmth.
, and after a cursory check, realized he had jumped to conclusions and had kicked Steve out of his own bed for no reason.
“If I don’t do it, the bullets get stuck in me and I have to fish ‘em out later,” Steve grumbled, absentmindedly skirting a hand over his abdomen as if to feel the ghostly remains of the bullets, “He knows that. And this isn’t the first mission I go home looking like swiss cheese—besides, I only took out the really bad ones.”
He lead the group down the hall and into the sitting room, relaxing once he saw Mother in her favorite chair, knitting needles working in her hands. A fire was stoked in the fireplace, giving the room a cozy aura that further unknotted the tension he was carrying on his shoulders.
The group looked at each other, and other than Tony and Clint’s respective glare and enthusiastic nod, there was a collective head shake.
He did not know why, but the Alpha’s correction had him seeing red. Bucky was yelling for a clean fight again somewhere in the background, but all he cared about was wiping the seemingly smug look off of the Warlord’s face. He would have been able to, had Steve been anyone else. As it were, Steve had incredible reflexes, allowing him to catch Tony’s heated punches in both hands. He took them down to the ground and straddled Tony across his chest, then pinned him to the floor by his wrists.
He left the room and closed the door behind him as Steve stood, moving to sit next to Tony on the bed. He wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist, resting his head on his shoulder so he could watch PJ play with Tony’s shirt.
“There has been a battalion sighted on our southern border,” Thor explained after translating to Steve, “Almost a hundred men on horseback. It is nothing serious; we have attacks like this often. However, with your status, the Prime wants to go to the field. If the battalion is of Howard’s men, it would be wisest for him to be leading us in. The Prime’s presence tends to put fear into men.”
Tony blinked in surprise, but sure enough, a freshly showered Steve walked through the door with a large bag slung over his shoulder and PJ’s elephant and sippy cup clutched in his hand.
“Let me,” Natasha interrupted Tony’s thoughts, pushing him away, “Go see if one of those hospital bedrooms has a blanket or a sheet we can wrap him in.”
“No, honey, you’re not going. You are staying here with me,” Tony said, pressing a kiss to the boy’s forehead, “Sorry, bud.”
“On your knees, cheek on the bed, please,” he requested, “I want to check you over again, just to make sure nothing tore.”
Tony has to deal with Alpha pissing contests (metaphorically speaking) and uses his bonding ritual to drown out Rhodey's news.
“It’s okay, you’re doing so well,” Tony panted, squeezing and teasing Steve’s pec to make sure he’d been milked thoroughly, “I think—I think this one’s almost done, okay? It already looks less swollen.”
Struggling to not cry, Steve couldn’t help but smile at the page, tracing a fingertip over the line. Looking up over at Tony, he cleared his throat, getting his attention.
Tony squeezed Steve’s hands, trying to give him a comforting look. PJ shifted on the bed, so they stayed quiet for a moment, waiting for the boy’s soft snoring to pick back up.
Since he had fathered the child rather than birthed him, he figured he could not produce the milk needed to feed him. Instead, he took up the wineskin full of milk and guided it to the baby’s mouth, careful to let him drink only a small amount.
“No. Surprised, perhaps. Bewildered. But not mad,” Rhodey said gently, “If it is what is best for Peter, then it is what it is.”
Tony barely got one footstep toward the door when a sharp pain electrified his heart and crackled through his ribs. His gasp was silent as he stumbled and smacked a hand on the wall, stunned by the sudden surge from the bond. It was difficult to concentrate on shaky legs, but Tony shut his eyes tight and tried to feel around the bond anyway. Searing heat radiated from the connection, burning in fierce rage and protectiveness. Unable to withstand it any longer, Tony’s eyes flew open and he forced himself to move, knowing that he needed to find Steve.
“He’s stable and should be waking up soon,” the one in the front said, “Now, there are a few things you should know before you go back and see him. Mr. Stark-Rogers has experienced a large amount of physical and emotional trauma. We’re…unsure of how mentally stable he will be when he wakes up. Now, when you found him, he was lucid, correct?”
“Other than alcoholism? Not that I know of,” Tony snorted, stepping into a private elevator, “I’m more concerned about something else.”
Tony grunted, but handed to phone over, writing down his answer on the cardstock. He looked over at the other two ‘wives,’ frowning when he saw them smirking at him.
Still trying to scoot away, PJ settled with huddling up against the bedframe, bawling and screaming each time Tony tried to reach his hand out to comfort him. Minutes turned to two hours as Tony kept trying; having PJ tire himself out was out of the question, as it seemed that super serum stamina also applied to panic attacks.
Sure that Steve had bonded him in his sleep, Tony shrieked and shoved the other man out of the bed, covering himself up with as many furs as possible. He heard Steve grunt and groan when he hit the floor, then saw his head slowly peek up over the side of the bed, eyes weary with sleep and confusion.
The room was silent, stretching on until Steve returned, eyeing them both as he set down Tony’s and his plates. He grunted and petted Tony’s hair, then turned back around and went back into the kitchen. Tony still kept his head down, even when Steve brought out a third plate, handing it to Rhodey.
“I think it’d be wisest to do it sooner rather than later, but you should probably have someone more qualified sitting in on it. Or, at least, do it somewhere where the cameras can accurately record facial expressions and bodily movements since he might not be comfortable with a stranger sitting with him and asking questions. If you want, I could try to set something up. Get the two of you some questions to ask him and all that,” he said slowly, sharing a look with Tony, “It might help with easing his panic…or, it might cause him to have worse panic from reliving whatever happened in the compound.”
Please be patient between chapters. Things are a little crazy right now and it is taking me longer to write than I initially thought.
“I wonder if you are actually hungry or if you only enjoy being fed,” Tony said quietly, wrapping both arms around Peter as Steve stood to take the empty plate away.
“I do not think he is ill—if he is, he is most certainly not feeling as awful as you,” he decided, “I think it would be best for Peter to stay close to you. Omegas heal faster when they have their infants nearby—there is a whole study of pheromonic healing, if you would like to hear it when you are well. In the meantime, since you are too ill to be out of bed, someone has to take care of Peter’s needs. Would you like me to show the Prime what he is to do while you rest?”
He’d nearly clocked the therapist for that one, but Steve had dragged him into his lap and held him tight, shushing him softly and telling him an assault charge wasn’t going to help anything. It took him a few minutes to settle down after that, but he’d stayed perched on Steve’s lap, arms laid over top of those wrapped around his waist. The contact was warm and comforting and it didn’t take long for their therapy sessions to move from sitting on each other to cuddling on the couch. If he thought about it, Tony knew they’d always been like that; whenever Steve was close, they were touching, almost desperate to feel each other underneath their fingertips.
“At least it is over, and despite our losses, we did manage to capture their strongest man,” he said, trying to reassure Tony, “Perhaps you should see him with me. If you know him, you could give advice on how to get information from him.”
He tried to stand up but almost tripped over something on the floor, cursing and curling himself over Peter as said thing moved. Steve groaned and stood up from where he had been sleeping, rubbing his head where Tony’s foot had connected with him.
Tony quickly translated and raised an eyebrow at Rhodey, who smiled quite strangely for someone who had just been told that his attacker might attack him again if needed.
Silence fell over them. The thought of being in such a stupor that he could not care for Peter worried him; he carefully pulled the baby away from his chest and brought him out from under his shirt, smiling when he giggled.
“My apologies. I did not mean to scare either of you—you both left in a hurry. Is everything alright?” Thor asked in both languages.
“It would have raised too many alarms. As it was, I had to sneak out of a fancy dinner to pack up my things, then climb out of my bedroom window so I could run to meet Pepper and Rhodey to take the baby that night,” Tony explained, “We knew he could never stay in the city because he would smell like me. We needed to hide somewhere, so our plan had been for Mary and I to run North in the hopes that the rumors of the Prime Alpha would be enough to keep Howard from sending troops after us.”
“I don’t know if I wanna go home, J,” Tony answered honestly, unable to help the fresh flow of tears when Jarvis reached over to take Tony’s small hand in his gnarled one, “I—with Dad, I just—”
He maneuvered himself to curl over the boy’s body, shielding him from the blast that rocked the car and blew open the truck doors. Noticing that they didn’t slow down, he turned to look over his shoulder, and there he was: sweet Steve,
PJ didn’t answer, opting instead to scrunch up his face and turn back to look at the elevator doors as they opened onto the main floor. He kept his hold on Tony’s pantleg, forcing the latter to walk a little awkwardly. Together, they headed to the kitchen, where Tony found a washed and dried sippy cup sitting out on the counter, praises be to Natasha for leaving it where he could find it. He snagged it before heading to the refrigerator to grab Scott’s clearly labeled apple juice, quickly pouring it into the cup and twisting the lid on. Handing it to PJ, Tony waited for the kid to let go of his pants before returning the juice to the fridge and herding the child out toward his new room.
Tony laughed, slipping his arm around Steve to bring the Alpha in to lay on his chest. He nuzzled the top of his head and kissed him there, taking a moment to just breathe in his warm scent. It was domestic, to be curled up in bed with an Alpha in the middle of the day, but he found that he did not mind. Rather, having Steve be willing to take the submissive position even in their cuddles made his heart seize and his stomach flutter.
Not waiting for an answer, he stepped into the room, toeing off his slippers before sitting on the edge of the bed. PJ made a noise at the movement, soon blinking open his eyes sleepily.
“Hey, hey, shhh, you’re going to throw yourself into a panic attack,” Tony interrupted, “C’mon. Breathe, Steve. In and out. I know that nice government juice took out your asthma and shit, but your brain can still go into hyperdrive. Still, let’s not talk about that right now, let’s get you into a better space so we can go home and cry over how much we love each other and how traumatic all this shit has been in
He left Steve on his own and went to peek at the baby, relieved to find him dreaming away. It always worried him when he left Peter alone for too long, but the distraction gave Steve a few minutes to compose himself and redress. Once he heard the water start to drain, Tony went back into the bathroom.
Balancing Peter on his chest, Tony went over and put his fingertips under the running stream. He flinched at the heat and turned the other tap until the water began to cool to slightly above lukewarm. Looking up at the Prime, he nodded and stepped back. The man put his own hand under the water and grunted, but Tony could not tell if it was a positive or a negative response. Once the tub was a few inches full, Tony reached over and shut the water off, pretending as though the Prime was not staring, watching his every move. Theoretically, he could do without a bath for a while, but Peter needed to be cleaned, and he was willing to sacrifice a bit of dignity if it meant the baby was happy. He sighed and carefully began to undress, juggling Peter around like a hot plate as he stripped down to his underwear.
“Darling, I wear your bite on my neck--had you forgotten already? It would be a death wish to try and steal me away from you. Our souls are entwined now, and not even the most handsome or smartest of Alphas could break that. Have faith, if not that your people are trustworthy, then in that I will stay by your side. You may infuriate me at times, but I have grown… fond of you.”
“Y’know, he really likes the reactor,” Pepper said softly, a smile curving her lips, “If he’s still having problems with the dark, why don’t you make him his own nightlight? Keep daddy close.”
She snorted in reply, making Steve grin and close his eyes, thunking his head back against the jet. The banter came easily as the adrenaline was draining from his body, but his smile quickly turned to a grimace at Clint’s loud cry at having his leg re-set and strapped in place to prevent it from moving.
“Great team outing, Stark!” Clint called from his perimeter position, earning a middle finger from Tony.
He rolled onto his side to face Steve and let the Alpha settle before scooting into his arms, happy to steal his warmth. Steve pressed a kiss to his hair and Tony smiled, burying his face in the man’s chest. Just as they began to drift off, the universe decided to intervene and Peter began to fuss and wail, sobbing his little eyes out. Tony sighed when Steve laughed, untangling himself so he could kneel on the bed and scoop Peter up out of his crib.
“Shh, I’m right here, it’s okay, you’re okay,” He soothed, ignoring the little hands pushing on his chest, “You gotta calm down, PJ. Okay? I’ll let you go once you can
“—the fact that you even took in PJ is a huge step. You know Steve would have wanted the team to have him, not SHIELD. Especially not after they were compromised. You did the right thing,” she continued, “And, I hope you don’t mind me saying, he really is cute, Tony. PJ, that is. He looks just like you. And for what it’s worth, you’re going to be a great dad.”
Steve nodded, so Tony focused on getting PJ cleaned up, deciding to do another sponge bath; after hearing about the submersion torture, he was more than wary on trying to introduce him to a regular bath or shower. Thankfully, PJ was tired enough that he didn’t whine too much as he went through his bedtime routine, eventually finding himself tucked up against Tony’s chest in Iron Man pajamas with his teeth brushed and his hair combed.
“Go and make sure you’re cleaned up,” she subvocalized, slipping one of her smallest knives into his hand, “There’s a kit back there for patching when you’re done.”
“Oh, sweetheart. No need to cry,” Tony murmured, kneeling down by the tub to pet Steve’s hair, “I apologize. I know you are just as upset with yourself as I am. I can feel how guilt-ridden you are and I know it really is not your fault. You cannot help that you are butting heads with another Alpha. We will get this all sorted out soon so we can all move on, okay? Please do not cry. One of my boys already cries enough as it is.”
“Steven, if you do not apologize right now, you will be sleeping outside tonight,” he threatened, immediately regretting his words when Steve’s eyes turned sad.
“Brucie bear, you’re with me,” He said, hearing the other scientist’s familiar footsteps behind him, “He’ll need a full exam and possibly a few blood tests. Even though we have HYDRA’s initial data, I want to run his chart just in case something odd comes up.”
“Perhaps. Either way, I have a…colleague out there who is familiar with the ancient architecture,” T’Challa said, “I’ll try to contact him, see if he knows anything.”
“I cannot accept your money,” He said, tossing it in the air so he could catch it and hand it back, “I—I already have taken so much, I cannot possibly—”
Steve dragged his eyes up from PJ to look at Tony, the wet glaze not going unnoticed. Tony huffed and gave a gentle smile, aching to reach out and try and give some sort of comfort.
The six guards stared at him for a moment, but one of them eventually split off, returning with a blanket that Tony noted was similar to the blanket he had found in the original compound to wrap PJ in. With a nod, Tony backed off from the doorway, watching the iron door close with four hefty clicks.
“I think Steve would agree and happily take it from you. Nothing beats him up more inside than the fact that he’s failed Tony once and will probably fail him again, y’know? He’s never doubted loving Tony, he just didn’t really know what that meant until he nearly lost him. I don’t think he’d ever purposefully try to
PJ nodded and stuck his hand out, grabbing hold of Tony’s hand as they walked out of the bathroom. Tony gently squeezed his hand back as thanks, letting the boy lead him—and by default, Steve—out to the kitchen. With a soft
“You really gotta stop talking like a weirdo, Thor,” Clint sighed, “We get the whole Norse thing, but really?”
“He takes my favorite jam,” he blurted, eyes widening as he realized he couldn’t back out, “I mean, uh, yeah. At breakfast. He likes to have jam on toast some mornings, and he knows I import my blackberry jam and that it is
“Sorry, peanut. I can’t right now. Soon, okay?” He promised, “How about you hold my hand instead? We have to go back down to the funny smelling place so I can get checked out.”
It was quiet for a moment, save for the sound of the water splashing as Tony rinsed him off. He carefully placed his fingertips on top of Steve’s bonding gland, unable to keep the small smile off of his face when the man whimpered.
Steve waved him off again. Thankful, Tony stood, bowed his head, and quietly exited the bathroom, making sure to close the door quietly behind him. He tiptoed over to Peter’s bassinet and peeked in, letting out a relieved sigh once he saw that the baby was still asleep.
Tony felt his heart break a little. Even if he could not feel Steve’s shame through the bond, the poor man soured the whole room with his scent, clearly in distress. He wanted to get up and throw himself at Steve to comfort him, but Peter beat him to it and began to cry, no doubt upset by the Prime’s scent.
Tony sifted his fingers through PJ’s curls until the child seemed to tire again, curling up against Tony’s chest with his hand on the reactor. Of course, the usual anxiety settled behind the hunk of metal, but seeing how peaceful the child looked, basked in the cerulean light—he couldn’t help but feel a smile twitch onto his lips.
“Is it possible to have loaded pieces of paper?” he muttered, crossing his arms as Bucky moved forward to draw.
Peter continued to cry as Tony checked his undergarments and bounced him, mentally ticking off reasons as to why the baby could be upset. Finally, out of desperation, Tony shucked up his shirt and the stupid nursing bra, holding the hems in his teeth as he guided Peter up. The babe took a second to latch, but once he did, he settled and his tears dried up. Relieved, Tony sent up a quick prayer to the divine, thankful that the babe was only hungry and not traumatized by Steve’s and his behavior. Careful of the material, he slowly let the bra and his shirt down, tucking one into the other to keep it in place.
The Prime gathers his council so Tony can tell them his findings, then takes his beloved out into the city to experience the market.
“No,” Tony admitted, picking up a bar of steel with tongs to put into the burning coals, “I asked questions where I could, but there were eyes and ears everywhere. My friends--Pepper and Rhodey--they did everything they could to get information for me, but I did not want the suspicion to be on them as well. As it is, them assisting me in stealing Peter away was bad enough. If they were ever found out to have helped me escape, I have no doubt that they would be killed.”
Bruce and Clint immediately stood, at which Tony snorted. He turned to ask Steve which he wanted to do, mouth hanging open as the blond grinned sheepishly from his standing position.
“Hey there, darling,” Steve murmured, gently pulling down the top of Peter’s dress to better see the babe’s face, “Did you behave while we were gone? I am sure you did.”
. At that moment, he silently vowed to keep Tony as safe as he could and knew his own Papa would be proud that he crossed his fingers when he promised so he could go home and tell Momma about everything without feeling guilty.
ticking right in front of you. Flesh and blood, right here for you to touch and hold to your heart’s content. I’m sure after a nicely worded letter from Pepper, Fury will give you well-deserved leave for a few years. I missed my trophy husband waiting for me in our bed, yeah?”
Tony ignored their bickering and started the math lesson that Miss Hill was trying to teach. He found himself picking it up after the first two problems and easily completed the rest of the booklet, sliding out of his chair once he was finished to turn it in at the front of the room. Miss Hill thanked him, but when he turned around, Tony was suddenly aware of the silence in the room and the eyes on him. He ducked his head to stare at his feet on his way back to his chair, taking short breaths to keep himself from crying, because
“They will come down from it eventually. I do not know how long they will be in shackles, but I think James should be fine by the evening. He scented of authentic righteous anger, while Steve reeked of annoyance and jealousy. It is more difficult to come back from being feral when Alphas feel that way.”
He set the cup down again, and feeling Steve still again, made a curious noise to look up at him. Blinking, Tony recognized his hooded eyes, but didn’t move fast enough to question Steve’s sloppy kiss.
supposed to mean?” he asked, letting her squeeze his shoulder before disappearing into the next room.
. He is merely trying to get a rise out of the Prime. Ignore him unless you are on the battlefield. It is the best policy.”
“Yeah. We probably should,” he finally managed, unaware he’d protectively tightened his hand around PJ’s without telling him.
They did not have to wait long for Steve to return, still sulking in his trousers and silky shirt. Tony whistled long and low at the sight, hopping up from the throne to meet his bondmate halfway.
“I seem to spend more time comforting you than my infant son,” Tony said, moving Peter down to cradle him in one arm so he could reach up to pat one of Steve’s hands, “You seem very sensitive to how I feel, no? For being unbonded, that is. I promise I am alright, Alpha. Bad thoughts come after us all sometimes.”
Steve set the bowl in his lap and reached up, fingers movingly deftly as he braided his hair back into the three braids he had had when Tony had first seen him. However, instead of using a string to tie off the ends, he dipped his fingers in the mixture and smoothed it into the ends, effectively pasting them together and preventing the braids from unraveling.
“Well, it’s alive,” He finally said, stepping up to the floor-to-ceiling glass tube, “Should we take it out?”
around and then attempting to skew this whole thing to be like a kid drifting between separated parents,” Tony replied hollowly, looking down at PJ’s small hand in his own, “I won’t do that to PJ. We gotta—we gotta do right by this kid, Brucie.
Tony rolled his eyes and scooted to the edge of the car, not at all feeling bad as pushed the unconscious guard aside.
He was quiet for the rest of the carriage ride, busying himself with attempting to calm Peter down enough to rest and thinking about what he had gotten himself into. Sure, his father had forced him to study various cultures in order to prepare him to assume the throne, but his few hours of lecture about the Warlords said nothing about tolerance in general, let alone that for couples. It was startling to hear that a group he was raised to think of as violent warmongers was actually quite progressive and, so far, quite kind. Kindness was a rare commodity, and to be gifted it by a stranger that looked like he could snap him in half with a flick of his wrist made Tony feel confused and a bit uneasy. His ability to trust had long been shattered; he began to bundle Peter up once again, swaddling him as tight as he could in case he needed to flee from the colony. Most likely, he would not make it far, but he would take his chances if his situation began to sour.
“Steve is going feral,” Natasha said quietly, drawing Tony into her body to keep him from watching what was happening, “James was fine until Steve came into the dining room. We could all smell you on him and I think James had the wrong impression of what had happened. They started off with quips and snide comments, but their natures could not handle two Alphas wanting to protect the same person.”
“It’s a morgue,” She finally announced, leading the team into what seemed to be a large operating room, outfitted with numerous gurneys, cabinets and counters, medical equipment and a small set of morgue cabinets on a back wall.
They traipsed back into the bowels of the castle and down a few flights of stone steps until Steve stopped at an unremarkable door and knocked four times, waiting for a beat between each knock. After a second, the door creaked open and Steve stepped aside, motioning for Tony to enter. He moved forward and paused, suddenly under assault by a room full of eyes. The entire conglomerate of Warlords stared back at him and he took a step back, only to bump up against Steve’s chest. Slowly, he turned his head up to look at the Prime Alpha and whimpered, unable to help clutching Peter a little tighter.
“Not at all,” Steve answered softly, “But I know you two are very important to me, and I wouldn’t give you guys up for anything. Heck, we’ve barely had PJ for a few days and I already feel that way.”
“I’ve got you,” Steve whispered, ducking his head so he could press a kiss to Tony’s cheek, “Kisses for my lovely wife.”
Tony yelped and whirled around in his chair, only to pout as Pepper clacked into the workshop in her tall stilettos. She sighed once she got close enough to inspect his face, reaching up to brush her thumb over the bandaging on his forehead.
“I know basic medicine, Doc, no need to spare me the details,” Tony interrupted, shouldering through them to look at the scans.
“Alright. Let us return and eat more,” he conceded, standing up from the bed and reaching for Steve’s hand.
,” Steve sighed, “I warned you this would happen if you did not let me take my time with you. There is no need to feel so bad about it, little rabbit. You are in pain; let me help you.”
“Is there any reason you two are still here? I mean, its really great to see you both, and I love you both very much, but I’d like a handjob from my husband, so if you all could exit—”
Tony grunted and did as he was asked, letting the nurse bandage his chest up, careful to avoid the arc reactor. He grunted a bit at the new pressure, but the familiarity of having set ribs at least eased his mind.
“Thanks. Ran out of Hulk ones,” Bruce answered, taking the vials over to his microscope, “Alright, let me do my work. Just, don’t touch anything. Go sit next to your son.”
Tony flushed bright red and sputtered, clapping a hand over his eyes as Steve wheeled him down and out of the plane; much to his horror, all of their friends were gathered and waiting for them, cheering as they appeared.
Steve bit down on his lip and nodded, letting out a shaky breath once Tony was done. Tony patted his side and readied a needle with thread, eyeing up how he was going to stitch the wound.
He switched languages and explained what was happening to Rhodey, giving him another hug before sending him on his way with Natasha. They disappeared around the corner, and Tony found his mouth being attacked, with Steve’s hands eagerly grabbing his hips to pull him closer.
. It’ll…it’ll take some time, and it might not even be this month that you get comfortable, but one day you’ll wake up and you won’t feel so scared anymore. We’re kind of experts on the whole new-world scenario, so.”
“Oh, oh no, he—everything has been fine,” Tony stammered, an awkward giggle bubbling up in his throat, “I am merely becoming acclimated to this new life. I do not know of customs or how
“We need medevac,” he said to Bucky, slinging his rifle over his shoulder, “Radio it in, keep the others away. They—They don’t need to see this.”
fast. But that’s how you kind of operate, so we’re trying to stay flexible, here. You need to keep calm for PJ, though. You only have to last until bedtime. Then you can freak out.”
Tony raised an eyebrow at Steve’s smile, rolling his eyes despite his gratefulness for the change in topic.
“How did you and Clint get here?” he asked, turning as Steve moved to grab his discarded suit top and shield from the living room couch.
The sound of the kitchen door opening drew Tony from his thoughts and he looked up, already beginning to salivate once he saw the full plates in Bruce’s hands. He barely let Bruce set the plate down before diving in and shoveling the food into his mouth. Sure, it was only rice and beans and some fruit, but
“Uh. Steve would want shepherd’s pie, but with colcannon instead of regular mashed potatoes on top,” he said, writing it down as he spoke, “He’d also want it with half lamb and half beef, and a Sam Adams. Preferably Octoberfest.”
“Team building exercise, courtesy of Nick Fury,” Natasha answered, shaking the hat between her hands as she gave Tony a look, “You can blame Clint for picking what it is.”

“At ease, Prime. No one is going to steal us from you,” he teased just to watch Steve’s cheeks tint pink, “You cannot help yourself, can you?”
baby, his only son, not even weaned, and Steve wanted to kick him out? The thought brought tears to his eyes, and he must have started to sour, as Peter’s wails quieted to whimpers and Steve reeled back to cough.
“The dick wants what the dick wants,” Jane said faux-sympathetically, not looking as she high-fived Natasha in front of her.
He set the boy down and took his hand again, unsurprised that Pepper smoothly slid into the elevator with them. PJ grasped Tony’s slacks, risking a few glances at her before burying his face in Tony’s legs.
“Is he alright?” Steve asked with a frown, gently poking a finger into one of Peter’s fists so the baby could grab onto him, “Did he eat?”
Peter cried more as he was dried off, but the hitting stopped, so Tony took it as a win. He skipped drying himself off and only wrapped a towel around his waist, figuring it could wait until he finished up with Peter. The crying was dwindling, so Tony risked picking him up, finally feeling some relief when the babe cuddled into his neck.
Rhodey seemed to understand and relaxed as they descended, but Bucky stayed ramrod-straight, even going so far as to put his hand on Steve’s knee. He squeezed lightly, trying to help ease Steve’s nerves as the plane jolted during landing, causing him to flinch forward and rip the seatbelt out of the chair.
Upon Steve’s return with PJ, Tony smacked a palm to his forehead, seeing the child drenched in some liquid with flecks of pink across his lips and face.
“No booster seat. Plus, this car is a bit advanced for your geriatric-ness. I need to drive and I can’t have him in the backseat by himself,” he explained, unlocking the doors and opening the passenger side to slide the seat forward, “In. Go.”
“Then we stay for now. We monitor, and we remain diligent,” Steve assessed, earning nods from the group, “Spread the plan to the team. I also want constant guards with Tony and PJ. If not one of us four, someone else on the team, but only from the team. We don’t know Zola’s breaching capabilities. Not that I doubt your abilities, Tony, but I don’t want to underestimate Zola.”
“Glad isn’t exactly the word I’d use, but alright,” Tony answered, moving forward with a hand on PJ’s back, “And could we tone it down a bit? Kid’s kind of exhausted from the whole kidnapping-thing.”
Thanks for sticking with me for this journey. If you liked it, please leave kudos and a comment, and be sure to check out my other works.
, which, to a bunch of pre-teens, was the fucking funniest thing they’d ever heard. He was already aware of and knew about sex and what his body was doing hormonally and physically, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t going to innocently ask Coulson absurd questions.
Tony snatched up one of the sweet rolls to eat and missed the strange look on Steve’s face as he scarfed down the treat. He licked his lips and turned back for more, but his hand paused in mid-air once he realized he was being stared at.
“You fell. Hit the ground like a sack of potatoes. You’re just lucky Clint and I were there to grab you,” Bucky said slowly, raising his right arm to show off his hot pink cast, “The others are pretty ticked, but they let me in since I was technically already back here. That, and it took pretty much the whole cavalry to keep Steve from bursting in here.”
Silently, he scooted the kit over to his side, only letting go of Tony’s hand for a moment so he could rifle through the kit. Once he’d found the tools he wanted, he moved up to Tony’s head, using alcohol wipes to start cleaning the grime from his face. His hair would have to be washed at the hospital, but Steve ignored it, shakily dragging the wipe over Tony’s face until his skin was clean. Tossing the used wipe aside, Steve picked up small suture scissors, carefully leaning in to start trimming his beard. Sure, it wouldn’t have clean-cut edges, but he knew how important the facial hair was, even if Tony never admitted it to him.
“Ow. Sort of. Not really. It’d be a long shot, and we’d probably be dino food by then,” Tony grumbled, rubbing his head, “Where’s the shield?”
“Bucky and Tasha wanna play house t’day, so you should join us,” he said around a mouthful of pretzels, “We can make our own house if y’want. Bucky’s usually the Mom, but he’s been complaining about takin’ care of the kids by himselfs.”
Tony hummed in agreement and rested his head against Steve’s chest so he could relax while playing with Peter. He quickly tuned out the meeting as the Warlords discussed the amount of food and weapons stockpiled for the upcoming months. They went onto how to expand the city and Tony’s ideas for better defenses, only to land on any miscellaneous news that any of them would like to share as part of the debrief.
“Ah. Easier than looking for ties and keeping track of them,” Tony said, watching Steve bend over to put the pot on the floor when he was finished with it, “Smart. I am glad I do not have to do that with my own hair, though. I prefer it to be short.”
“Taking Matters into His Own Hands. 1987. He’d have been…seventeen. MIT,” Steve said to himself, wincing when he had to peel the pages apart, “I wonder if James knows about these…”
He tired of the position and pulled out, ignoring Steve’s whines as he pushed the man onto his back. He took Steve’s hands and placed them behind his knees, forcing him to hold his legs up and apart. Tony quickly realigned himself and sunk back into the warm heat of Steve’s channel. With both hands on Steve’s waist, Tony resumed his pace, eagerly watching Steve’s cock bounce on his belly.
Steve, stripped down to a tank top and jeans with PJ in his presumably clean Captain America pajamas, perched on the blond’s hip. The sight alone made Tony sigh happily, only to suck in a breath as the two men gave him a quizzical look.
“Holy shit,” he breathed, tongue darting out to wet his bottom lip as he let his eyes drag over Steve’s body, “You look—oh God, you look so good, you’re not allowed to wear anything else ever again, I
do everything they could to keep you and Peter safe. He did not care what happened to himself as long as you and the tot were okay. You need that kind of unconditional love, Tones. I think he could be good for you.”
Bruce laughed harder and steadied himself against the wall, wiping away a stray tear before heaving in a deep breath.
“I know you can. I want to carry you,” Steve murmured into his ear, “Don’t worry. Nobody cares anyway, and I’ll even walk in the alley so you don’t feel so exposed. Okay? Let me do this for you.”
Tony laughed and batted Steve’s hands away so he could shove down his pants, his own erection springing free. A hint of sheepishness showed in his grin, which Steve took as a victory point.
With a swoop of his stupidly fluttery cape, Fury marched back up into the Avengejet without another word. Tony turned to Natasha with a glare, to which she shrugged and merely followed Fury.
, Steve thought to himself, laying his head on top of Tony’s to try and help the other relax as he began:
When Sarah was silent, Tony picked his head up, trying to quell his swimming vision by squinting. He squeezed Sarah’s hand, panic swelling in his chest when she didn’t answer.
“Well, I thought--” Tony nibbled on his bottom lip again and looked away, shivering under Steve’s gaze, “I figured, since you had practically slicked me up and got me hard, you were going to--”
“Oh, sweetheart, oh love,” Steve whispered, pulling Tony into a hug once his husband started to get choked up again, “I’m here, I’m right here, that’s enough for now, okay? No more, I want you to get
child, he’s going back to the Tower with me. You can try to fight me, tooth and nail, but you won’t win against
“Now, now. Thor means you no harm, small one, see? Nothing to fuss over,” he tried, moving Peter down from his shoulder to the crook of his arm, “Shh, sweetheart—I bet you are just hungry, yeah? A little milk will—”
. Fitting for you, little man,” Tony teased, kissing PJ’s cheek, “Alright. In the light of the moon, a little egg lay on a leaf. See? That’s the moon, that’s the egg, and that’s the leaf. What’s the color of the leaf?”
Tony struggled and tried to get out of the guard’s grasp, but with the other kneeling on his legs and his arm around his throat, all he could do was struggle for air and claw at the guard. A sharp pain cut through him, causing him to scream bloody murder as he felt fingers start to probe in the gash in his neck.
“Soon, my littlest love. Papa will give you something yummy to help those teeth, okay?” Tony soothed, running his hand through Peter’s curls, “Be good, sweetheart. I love you.”
Peter did not give a response, but Tony brought him up for a kiss anyway, cuddling him to his chest. He felt the baby tuck his head into his neck and nearly cried as his heart swelled with affection for the little one.
on me? So this whole time, all the not sitting with me anymore, the avoided conversations, the stilted voice—it was all because you have a crush and didn’t, what, want to make me uncomfortable? Is that it?”
Thankful for the distraction, Tony took his own plate and trotted into the kitchen with Bruce, showing everyone where the trash was and making sure everything had been left relatively clean. Once roll call was taken to make sure no one had
“What about the X-Men?” Clint asked from his desk in front of Tony, turning around to join the conversation, “Don’t you play them today?”
“I can’t help it. You were practically moaning over here. Made it very difficult for me to concentrate,” he grunted, taking both of their cocks in hand with a hiss.
He wasn’t prepared for the hand that smacked him across his face. He was stunned, feeling the hot pain jab like needles across his cheek.
baby without permission, but his stomach lurched again and he attempted to get out of bed, only to tangle himself in the bed furs and fall not-so-gracefully onto the floor. Groaning softly, Tony decided that the cold floor was nice until he realized the noise had woken the babe up. Peter’s whimpers turned into a full-blown wail, forcing him to attempt to get up.
Thor waved a hand to the one woman in the room and beckoned her over, murmuring to her in low tones before turning to Tony.
“One can be masculine and outwardly express emotions through crying, Tony. You of all people taught me that,” he teased.
“I used to jerk off onto your old posters, babe,” he snorted, standing to move over to the couch to crawl under the blanket with Steve, ignoring Steve’s pressing problem, “Of course that was my fantasy. You have always, unequivocally, been my favorite wet dream. That being said, would you like some help?”
Once again left standing in the middle of the room with the ghost of the engineer’s hand on his shoulder, Steve watched as Tony left, then glanced down at the toy. He fiddled with the knobs for a bit to get the hang of it, then decided that maybe he could master something the great Tony Stark could not in terms of tech.
“Hey, where’s pipsqueak? We’re about done in here,” the archer grinned, hands on his hips, “Looks cool, right? Thor went to Asgard for a bit. Something about furs. He should be back soon…Bruce is in the lab, and I think Pepper headed back up to her office.”
“Focus,” Natasha interrupted as she started to bounce PJ on her hip, “Right now the subject count is estimated to be around six-point-five thousand.”
“No, the lab is too much like the compound. He might freak out and be afraid,” Natasha countered, carefully watching the boy, “I think it’s best to just let Tony hold him and wait it out.”
Tony peeked over his shoulder to see Steve’s darkening eyes blink back at him. It was not often that he used his Omega tone, but the situation seemed to call for it and Steve was in no hurry to chastise him. The Warlord licked his lips and leaned in for a kiss, figuring that it would not hurt if they were a few minutes late. Tony could not do much until Peter finished his breakfast anyway.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’ll hook you up,” he agreed, offering one of his first real smiles in months, “Don’t take her to any bummy places, though. She loves being formal and uptight. Just your type.”
“Papa’s going to read to you, then he’ll tuck you in for sleep, okay? We’ll leave the string lights on for you and there’s a light on in the bathroom,” Tony explained, knowing that the child probably didn’t understand what he was saying, “If you need
Tony breathed out a sigh of relief and thanked the Warlord, whispering the good news to Peter as they headed into the forest. It only took a minute for them to reach the carriage, already hitched up and ready for the ride back. The Warlord helped Tony up before climbing up and sitting next to him, nodding to the driver to begin.
He refused to look toward Steve when the Alpha tried to comfort him. Peter needed him and he was going to pay attention to his sweet boy, whether or not Steve liked it. The bond throbbed in his chest, flooding his senses with Steve’s worry and nausea; it hurt to feel his bondmate’s rejection.
Tony rolled his eyes and stepped away from the table, letting Thor take and answer questions from the others. As the ruckus began to pick up in the room, Peter whined and fussed, unlatching in his fit. Tony quickly shouldered the baby and kissed his cheek, slipping out to the hallway where there was less noise. He bounced the baby in circles and attempted to keep him calm, rubbing and patting his back in case air bubbles were causing him discomfort.
PJ gave Bruce a side eye, only to snuggle more into Tony’s side and clutch at his shirt. Tony couldn’t help but laugh, immediately wincing at the pain that shot up his side. With a sympathetic look, Bruce patted Tony’s arm and stood, making his way out of the room.
The arms around him were strong, solid, comfortable; Tony buried himself in Steve’s chest and savored the feeling, only to squeak in surprise when he was lifted up, instinctively wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist.
He watched her go with a sigh, finishing off the rest of his coffee and sticking the mug in the dishwasher before going back out to the communal lounge. Sure, he didn’t mind having the kid to himself for a few weeks, but without Steve? Everything was so new; they’d barely talked about where they stood relationship-wise, and now he was going to be gone—
“That, and she might find it disrespectful,” Tony added, a twinge of loss ringing in his chest, “I’m also not so keen on this whole naming my kind-of child after people I know. Except Rhodey. I like the name James, anyway. He can deal with it.”
“It—It may hinder his growth. Other than that, no. If anything, it’s strengthened that area. He’ll just be very sensitive about the area.”
Steve’s sad eyes peeked out from under wet lashes, making Tony feel like an absolute jackass. Slowly, he untied Steve’s skirt and let it drop to the ground, holding onto Steve’s hands so he could step out of it and into the bath. Steve grunted and swore as he sat, no doubt achy and sore from struggling against his bindings all morning. Tony stepped in and slid down behind him, unable to help his cheeky smile when Steve stared at him.
Embarrassment spotted his cheeks when he thought back to their anniversary, to his gift, to what Steve had read—
“No, no, you’re in my lap for now,” Steve said, dragging the bag of things over before snatching PJ up, handing him his elephant and sippy cup before sitting down in the chair next to Tony’s bed.
“I think it’s good,” Steve voiced calmly, slicking back his sweaty hair, “But it’s ultimately up to you, Stark.”
,” Rhodey grabbed hold of Tony’s shoulders, using his strength advantage to manhandle him back into the bed, “He’s okay, he’s in the living room with Steve and Clint. He’s just a bit shaken up. Once you can sit up and
Spurred on by the thought of getting his baby back in his arms, Tony headed inside and hobbled his way to Bruce’s quarters, smiling as he heard familiar cries echoing down the hall. Something in his heart tugged and he knew Peter missed him. He barely got his fist up to knock when the door swung open, revealing the disheveled physician and a clearly agitated Peter.
Of course, being the insomniac that he was, Tony stayed awake for another hour or so, allowing himself to enjoy Steve’s familiar weight curled up next to him, listening to the man breathe as he slept on. It was one of those moments where he realized that, despite the shit that was collapsing around him, despite the mountains he knew he’d have to climb in both his new relationship with Steve and with fatherhood, and despite the oncoming dread of having to face his fears, Tony decided that for right then, he wouldn’t want to be anywhere else in the world.
They all stopped when a familiar cry echoed down the hall, and then Steve was standing in the doorway with Peter bundled up in furs and nestled in his arms. It was odd to see such a large man seem so small and distraught as he tried to shush the wailing infant.
“Sir? Can you hear me? This is Captain Steve Stark-Rogers. I’m here to help you. A medical chopper has been ca—”
“Never doubt my loyalty again, or you will regret it,” Tony said, unwavering in his eye contact with Steve.
She laid a careful hand on his arm and another on his back, rubbing comforting circles onto his stressed muscles. He barely acknowledged her touch, only slightly turning his head toward her. Sighing, she rested her head on his arm, squeezing his bicep.
, he will always follow you, even if you go away to school,” Natasha said quietly, starting to dab foundation onto Tony’s bruising, “It is how bullies are. Something should be done.”
“There we go. I’m sorry if I hurt you on accident, pumpkin. I didn’t mean to,” Tony apologized, keeping his hand still, “I’ll try to be more careful, okay?”
Thankfully, the ride back to the Tower was mostly uneventful, other than the lectures from Steve about being more careful, and the panicked calls from Rhodey and Pepper about leaving (Rhodey) and being gone (Pepper). PJ kept his little face pressed to the windows as they traveled, eyes wide as he watched the ground speed by below them.
He grabbed another piece of paper and drew up a quick sketch of a hot oil catapult, placing it on one of the areas that needed more defense. Steve peered over his shoulder and gave him a suspicious look, to which Tony made a whooshing noise, scratching down a river of ink over the mock army to blot them out of existence. He turned back toward Steve to judge his reaction and stopped, flushing when he smelled the wave of proud Alpha pheromones that began to scent the room. It was a sweet scent and he reveled in it, preening under the man’s warm gaze.
,” Tony stage-whispered to Steve, ignoring the staring around them as he slotted himself up against Steve’s chest, “God, at least we didn’t have to argue about taking each other’s names—”
Steve heard her step over to the on-deck shower, letting his face contort into worry once he heard the rattle of the shower curtain.
He could not help his soft whimper when Steve pulled away to listen to Bruce, hand lingering in the air for a moment. Later, he would wonder how he had become so attached to the man already, but for now, he was just thankful he had some sort of help. He wanted to watch Bruce to make sure he was careful, but Thor stepped into his line of vision and bent down to smile at him.
He threw up again, and it didn’t take long for the familiar sounds of asthmatic breathing to reach his ears, signaling Steve’s arrival. The arms left his waist and were replaced with Steve’s bonier arms, pulling him up and into the blond’s lap. Tony tried to squirm free, but Steve held close, wheezing into Tony’s hairline.
“He’s not dying, Captain. His leg is fractured in two places, but with Helen Cho’s help, he should be back on his feet in a week,” Vis supplied, phasing so he could sit on the seat that Clint’s bad leg was currently occupying, “I am at optimal functioning.”
nurturing seems to have kept the subject alive and calm. Which, for me, is optimal for completing my tests.”
“Good job, little one, telling me when you needed something,” Tony said quietly, gently stroking Peter’s fine hair, “Perhaps I should take you back to our room, hm? Today has been so stressful for you, I am sure of it…I should put you down for a rest.”
The choked-off sob from Steve was telling. Not wanting to delay any longer, Tony took hold of himself and canted his hips to slide his cock between Steve’s cheeks a few times before pushing in. He gently smoothed a hand down the Alpha’s back to help him relax, letting out a quiet little sigh once his head popped past the rim.
“Like I was sayin’, Barney was tellin’ me that when I get big ‘nough he’s gonna take me to the circus,” he was saying, carefully stacking wood blocks together to make a skyscraper, “I’m gonna be a rope walker an’ I’m gonna learn how t’eat fire.”
to walk away. For once, Tony was being the adult and owning up to the situation at hand. Yet, PJ was still screaming and crying across the kitchen, moving away each time Tony tried to get closer. At a standstill, he sat down fully against the bottom cabinets, letting PJ cry to himself as he huddled against the fridge.
“I apologize. I never intended for you to get hurt,” he said quietly, “We will understand each other soon, I hope.”
They stood quietly as they watched the fire, listening to it crackle and spark. As Steve shifted behind him, Tony hummed, tilting his head back to look up at him.
“JARVIS, call the others back in. You three keep your cards face-down,” Natasha sighed, taking out her own phone, “After they give their answers, you show your respective cards.”
Finally, he managed to get himself fully sheathed and he stopped, holding himself up above Tony to wait for him to be comfortable. He leaned down to gently kiss Tony's neck, hushing him when he whimpered.
“Hey. Why not let Bucky take you back to bed, hm? You are supposed to be resting, not running around with the baby,” Tony tried, patting Steve’s knee, “Maybe a nap will help you feel better?”
“I know, love. I will get you into your bed soon so you can sleep properly,” he promised quietly, smiling when the babe grabbed at his shirt, “Do not worry, darling, I will be right there to watch over you. No need to fuss, hm? I will tuck you in with some furs to keep you nice and warm during the night.”
He squeezed Steve’s hand once more and let go so he could rifle through the closet, coming up with another pair of Omega underwear and a large shirt that came down mid-thigh. Thankfully, there was a pile of infant’s clothing on the bottom shelf, clearly newly laundered. He chose a blue dress and matching undergarment, attending to Pete to dress him then put the babe back in the crook of his arm.
The Captain’s face went from annoyed to carefully blank, blue eyes flicking over Tony’s face for a moment.
“Just give ‘im to Cap,” The archer snorted, plucking out one of his hearing aids to clean it on his shirt, “Steve doesn’t mind.”
a paper-mâché moon that was also a lamp. It was fucking cute,” he grumbled, eyeing up the sleeping couple.
Sarah laughed next to Steve, who flushed and leaned down, planting a kiss on Tony’s forehead. When he pulled back, Tony frowned, pouting until Steve sighed.
“It’s okay. I’m tough. Made of iron,” Tony soothed, quick to change the subject, “Want to sit on the bed? We can—”
“He doesn’t know what that means, peaches,” Tony’s distant voice said, “You have to explain it to him.”
Yelping, Tony whirled around and nearly smacked into Steve’s chest, having to tilt his head up to look at the blond’s face. Finding nothing but concern etched on Steve’s features, Tony breathed a sigh of relief, spreading his hand over his reactor.
PJ nodded, reaching back with a giggle when Steve tugged on his hair. He whirled around and tried to push at Steve’s face, squealing when the man playfully nipped at his fingers.
He heard Steve move behind him, the familiar screech of metal against linoleum signaling the blond moving closer. Tony pretended he didn’t hear it, opting instead to pick up PJ’s hand again, cradling it between both of his own. It was silent for a few moments, only the sound of the heart monitor beeping filling the room. Tony was perfectly happy to stay quiet, for once; the monitor was enough sound to keep his attention from becoming too introspective and eventually self-loathing. But, of course, stupid
