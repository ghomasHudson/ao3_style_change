“Yeah. That, too. But also how you run your country. And I didn’t expect you to be so attractive. You know, you’re even more handsome in person than in those portraits.”
All hell would break loose, if their people discovered that their prince had dragon powers. For the fearsome beasts were widely considered a menace, with how they constantly raided forests, mountains and rivers, torching everything that impeded their hunt for treasure. To conceal his powers, Yinsen had forged a special medallion, and Strange had charmed it to suppress his abilities, allowing him to hide.
The juice was refreshing and sweet, which was a far cry from the very first berries grown in this garden. Despite all of Steve’s efforts to tend to them, that pitiful first batch had only borne a handful of white blossoms. And the few berries they’d painstakingly harvested were small, shrivelled and sour.
Time slipped away as he held Tony’s body close to him and breathed in the scent of his hair and his skin, feeling his warmth seeping through their clothing. “It’s okay, Tony. It’s going to be okay,” he lied as tears poured out of his own eyes and down his face. His eyes smarted and his throat burned. The air was heating up, and it was almost impossible to breathe.
And where were Steve and Nat? Agent Hill said she’d sent them to assist Fury but they’d gone dark, making it impossible for her to confirm their involvement in a second shootout along the freeway. Had they been shot too?
Steve gave him a solemn look of understanding. He knew what was at stake. Yet, Tony could feel the tension abating as they relaxed against the wall, bodies pressed close to each other's as they waited for Steve to recover.
“I’ll take you to the beach. We’ll watch a game. And then we go to the fair.” It sounded so nice. He wanted to make it, if only for that one day with him.
Glancing down at the beach, where Nat and the other petrified warriors were, Steve’s heart raced and beat painfully against his chest. With a deep breath and a heavy sigh, they began their descent.
Steve watched him, fondly. Then said, "The world as we know it might come to an end and you’re still working on his suits?”
, he thought with a flutter in his chest. He wondered how the prince of one of the most prosperous nations, was going to fit in with his family, and tolerate their simple ways and coarse manners?
Tony was off like an arrow, but despite his desperate manoeuvres to outfly the dragon, Midnight hovered above them with her sneer drawn wide. Her tongue was out and dripping with –
The word, spoken aloud, was all it took to undo the spell. Then, the Winter Soldier unravelled, falling to his knees, trying to ground himself to a helicarrier that was falling apart as icy blue eyes melting into pools of unshed tears.
“The serum in his blood is a stabiliser. It’s our last step in perfecting the virus. Thanks to our last encounter, I managed to collect a sample to run diagnostics. It was well worth the beating I got.”
Tony had to look away, overwhelmed by the images of Steve gritting his teeth, struggling in his bonds.
“Oh yeah, sorry. Steve, this is my best friend, James Rhodes, or Rhodey. And Platypus, this is my alpha, Steve.”
When Steve turned to look in their direction, Tony gulped, and forced his heart back down his throat. He dropped to his knees and crouched down beside Peter, as he contorted his body to make it as small as possible, before settling down behind a boulder.
Tony felt his heart race then slow down as Steve closed the gap, shyly placing his soft lips against his own. He savoured the aftertaste of vanilla ice cream, deeply inhaling the scent that was distinctly Steve’s own.
Fury was busy composing a text message and his grim expression told Tony he was not to be disturbed. So, Tony continued reading on his own.
“About a minute, thereabouts. It'll take longer for you to regain your strength. But you also are a super-soldier, so I’d give it ten minutes, tops.”
“Then,” she said, “You need to plant yourself like a tree, look him in the eye and tell him to make his move.”
“Look, we’ve only tested this on a small group of volunteers, but preliminary tests are promising,” Tony explained as the other man looked at him with keen interest. “Haven’t had time to do a full trial, but you don’t want a hospital and it looks like we’re stuck here. It’s epinephri – woah!”
Tony froze as Obie peered into his eyes. His face was so close that Tony could feel his warm breath against his skin. “This had better not be a trick,” the dragon warned as he pressed a talon against his cheek.
By the time all the pieces of his armour were lying neatly in a row on their dining table, Tony felt so exposed and vulnerable he might as well have been naked. He was drained, and all the fight had left his body. Shaking so badly he could barely stand, it was impossible to tell with whom he was angrier, Steve or himself.
“Yeah,” Clint agreed, feigning disgust despite the broad grin on his face. “Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.”
“I can’t believe it,” Tony said, still laughing. “My knight in shining armour is a dragon in gleaming scales. Why didn’t you tell me?” he added, a tinge of hurt in his voice.
He couldn't have done that when he hadn't even known who he was or who he was about to become. But now, he did.
Listening to the Jarvises discuss the difficulties of life brought to mind a boulevard, lined with fresh green grass and lemon trees. It was a eureka moment, an epiphany, and a vision of the path ahead of him.
Tony watched as Steve left. Yes, he had to get changed first. Get comfortable. Fetch his belt or whatever he needed. The belt wasn’t so bad.
Tony had thrown a tantrum, refused to eat or sleep, insisted he wanted to be guarded by the Winter Solider and only him. Then, when the lights went out, he whispered the same words to him and then some.
Wave after wave crashed into him, as the blood meant to transport oxygen and nutrients through his body began killing him on the inside. There were small lulls that gave him hope, until the surging tides would come again and cruelly extinguish that brief spark.
He turned to face the source of his pain. “I hate you,” he fired, blindly, the tears in his eyes making it hard to see.
He took a long, last look at Tony’s mussed-up hair, his red eyes and wet cheeks, and committed his image to his memory. For a few moments, they gazed at each other through their tears, neither knowing if and when they’d meet again. At the sound of a small explosion, Tony fled, and left behind the home they’d built and shared together, now going up in flames.
Steve turned away abruptly and checked his watch before mumbling something about being late for a job at the department store, where he would spend the rest of the evening shining shoes.
. They explored the possibilities before agreeing that even it if was going to end up being a city-hall debate, it was a decision best made as a team.
“Tony,” Steve warned, his voice stern. “I won’t have you talking about yourself like that. It’s not true and you know it. I think I know what might have happened. We can find out tomorrow.”
It took a long time, but his wounds had one day healed, leaving physical scars that were easily hidden and a smattering of magic that the dragon had unwittingly transferred to him - powers he retained but couldn’t command. Nothing fantastic - just the ability to light candles, heat things. Unless he learnt the spell, or the magic words, to invoke the transformation, he was stuck in this state – neither dragon nor man.
Thankfully, Bruce was near, and with the help of Nat and Clint, their little quartet managed to escort the intoxicated knights back to their chambers. Instead of returning to the feast, from which Steve was conspicuously absent, Tony chose to slip through the half-open doors of the library.
Tony was enjoying the show till Loki knocked Steve over and pointed his sceptre at him, demanding that he kneel. And that tipped Tony over the edge, spurred him into action, because Steve, the great Captain America, would kneel for no one, not even a power-hungry demigod. Except that one time when he did a thing for Tony and it was hot as hell, but wait. Never mind.
“Icing problem?” Obie asked and frowned at Tony, before a descending dracanix unleashed a hailstorm at his wings, thus causing them to freeze up almost instantly. Unable to move his wings, Obie plunged toward the ground, where he landed with a loud crash in the midst of tall trees.
“So do you,” Killian said and blow a giant fireball in his direction, which Steve deflected with his shield.
Tony couldn’t move, not when his heart felt like it was being ripped apart, not when his body felt like it was being torn into different directions. He wanted to keep the suit, of course he did. It was something he built. It was a part of him.
A veil of white haze loomed over the bridge as Tony drove his red Cadillac through the arches of high gothic towers that reminded him of church. But even as he looked out of the window to admire the intricately-woven steel cables, it never once crossed his mind that he was about to get hitched.
“Tony would be a brave and noble dragon. Do you know? He’s the bravest person I’ve ever known. Tony would protect the weak, defend the innocent. He’d be wonderful,” Steve finished, with a wistful smile.
Between them, the superspies spoke over twenty languages, including American Sign Language. Yet, their primary means of communication was a system of head tilts, brow raises, eye rolls, nose wriggles and mouth twitches. With their coaching, Tony soon mastered this dialect, which they used routinely to talk about Steve.
“What?” Steve exclaimed, with a face full of righteous indignation. “You can’t give me orders. I’m a king!”
“Is that what happened there?” Tony asked, pointing to a bare patch of grass with a single sapling growing on it.
Steve turned around just in time to see a fiery circle appearing inside their home, and the Sorcerer Supreme exiting from it.
Tony took the proffered glass from Steve’s hands. Such strong, masculine hands. They’d feel so good on his skin.
Tony could barely think. He felt light-headed and dizzy, and thankful he was sitting down. An omega was offering him food – that he made himself. It was a walnut date loaf, with a sponge base, packed with dates and creamy walnuts, and a generous layer of icing on top. Without even thinking about it, Tony took a bite –
Tony ran his hand through his overgrown curls, sweeping his untidy bangs out of his eyes. Checking for stubble, he stroked his smooth jaw and upper lip and briefly wondered how it would feel to be kissed.
“Yes,” Steve said, as he matched Tony's smile. “It’s a long one, and growing too, because every time I think I have you all figured out, you go right ahead and pull off another surprise.”
Steve took a deep breath before his next attempt, a flanking manoeuvre this time. “Why are you so keen to fight?” he asked, softly, looking deeply into his eyes like it contained the answers to all his questions. “There are so many important jobs.”
Children, and grown-ups, could be unkind. So, whenever push came to shove, Tony took it in his stride, collected the proverbial sticks and stones. The original weapons of war. If he wanted to run a weapons company one day, he was going to need lots and lots of those.
Tony thought that would be the end of the ancient dragon, but the stubborn old thing proved to have a few tricks up his sleeve and waiting in the wings, in the form of sharp spikes that sprouted from the top of his head all the way down his back.
He paused, listening closely to something. Tony increased the volume of the speakers to hear a woman’s voice – Nat’s. The assassin crouched. With slow, deliberate moves, he retrieved a grenade from one of numerous pockets and rolled it under a car. It exploded, tearing the car into pieces.
“The blue house beside the keep, with white flowers in the garden. You’ll find it in the bedroom all the way at the back. There’s a chest under the bed. That’s where it is,” Steve said, explaining where Tony had hidden his treasure chest.
There were others like Sarah – incredible people who kept their kingdom going with their blood, sweat and tears. Even in mourning, they made cheese and baked bread. They tended to their flowers and harvested their fruit.
Captain Rogers gave him a small smile as their eyes met so Tony returned it. Maybe life would be okay if his husband liked him.
Just when he was about to say his goodbyes and maybe something a little more sentimental, he felt the rotor slow down, allowing him to fly out and back to the ship. With his repulsor, he took out the last of Loki's men shooting at his husband.
“Oh, beautiful. You want me. I can smell it on you,” Killian whispered into his ear as the omega felt himself getting wet with increasing horror.
“Don’t gloat. We have incoming. Save my spot. Ready?” Tony said, looking over the waste disposal bins they were hiding behind.
Tony was thrilled to finally meet someone who spoke “English”, and his inner fanboy swooned when Dr. Banner invited him to his workspace, where they spent hours discussing anti-electron collisions and gamma radiation. Trying to impress the fellow Scientist, he was on his best behaviour, only prodding him twice in his (unsuccessful) attempts to turn him into a raging green monster.
. If only Steve knew how afraid he'd been of losing him. It was all his fault. If only he’d been honest right from the start, they wouldn’t have had those misunderstandings. He could have spared them both from this heartbreak.
In the corner of the room, Bruce and Strange were huddled over the calcinator, and Strange was using his magic to extract the antidote from Steve’s blood. As he distilled the clear solution into a glass bottle, Lord Strange muttered an incantation, which caused the potion to bubble and turn a shimmering white, before he vanished inside a portal.
“As are you,” Sarah said as her gazed focused on him. “I get the feeling there’s iron in your spine, fire in your veins. And we’re family now. We take care of each other.”
The armour-clad knights were a short distance away, staring miserably at the bleak landscape. Onyx Bay was a place of desolation, and its air was bitter and harsh. The stench of rot lingered everywhere, even near the forests, where withered mosses strangled the shrivelled trees that sprouted with maggot-ridden buds.
He knew Steve had been sketching, but he hadn’t known what it was. He balked at the thought of Steve reading his amateur work before illustrating his response - the masterpiece in his hands.
Tony chose that moment to return the atomiser to its case. “I assure you we have more to offer this world than making things that blow up.”
He recited the words, one by one, in impeccably-polished Russian. He’d practised, made sure he’d said them right. There was no room for mistakes.
His arrival at the tower was greeted by an eerie silence. Rhodey hadn’t been exaggerating about how quiet it was. He soon realised how much of the tower's activity had previously revolved around SHIELD, not till they'd moved out into their own headquarters at Washington D.C., leaving the first thirty floors of the building vacant. Not finding Steve in their apartment, he headed to the workshop, but he didn’t find him there either.
“NOOOOO!” the occupants of the room screamed as the metal-armed menace positioned himself on the roof of yet another unfortunate car, gun aimed at her head.
“That would be terrible,” Tony decided. And it was, because the thought of this wonderful man, with the chocolate-stained lips, being married to anyone who wasn’t him made Tony sick to his stomach. “Surely, there must have been some promising ones?”
Still, Steve was no moon. He’d always been too bright, too hot for anyone to hold. And the others had kept their distance. Everyone but Bucky.
“I know,” Tony said. “You told me very eloquently – the other day. And it made me so happy I forgot to say it back.” He brought Steve’s hand to his lips and kissed the back of his palm. “My love, I am sorry for keeping secrets. I am sorry for being careless with your feelings, but I will never ever be sorry for loving you. You’re the answer to my prayers, more precious to me than all the riches in the world. I don’t know how I have lived without you for as long as I have, but I can’t possibly spend another moment apart. And now I’ve gone – and made – you cry,” he added, choking up on the words himself as Steve buried his face in his hands.
For all the times he’d considered his powers to be a curse, they had at least allowed him to be his own forge. The mountains were at his disposal and long talons enabled him to rip up the earth to mine iron deposits, which he smelted and shaped with careful puffs of his breath into whatever his heart desired.
Over eggs and toast, Jarvis listened patiently as Tony, back to his characteristic hyperverbal self, launched into a ten-minute tirade about Steve, his outdated beliefs, illogical arguments and hypocritical ways.
Again, there were those treacherous tears at the corners of his eyes. How many times had he longed for this – for Tony to be back home and in his bed, too. And he thought of the number of times he’d almost lost Tony and how close he’d come to losing him completely. If not for –
He grasped at the sand and watched helplessly as fistfuls slipped between his fingers like the grains in an hourglass, a grim reminder of what was running out.
“This is where I go kick ass!” Tony said, and leapt off after Peter and Ivan as they flew past. He stayed hot on Ivan’s tail, ready to support Peter should the moment arise.
“Steve.” When Tony’s eyes flickered up in surprise, the young man was holding out his hand. “Steve Rogers,” he said. “Thought I’d introduce myself before you go on and hurt my feelings.”
Tony stared at the box in front of him. Jarvis had just handed it to him a few hours ago, telling him it contained his father’s personal effects. He picked up a white envelope, bearing his name in his father’s messy scrawl. What did Dad want to tell him only after he was gone?
The thunder god cleared his throat. “We’ve been searching through the cosmos for stardust and some magic colourful dragonstone things. That’s when we came across a path of death and destruction, which led us all the way here.”
The blood was streaming into the air before Tony felt the slashes down his lower back. Corvus Glaive, who had somehow crept up unnoticed, roared furiously at them from behind as he brandished his ironhard talons to claim credit for the despicable attack.
When Tony looked up, he found a tiny wisp of a boy whose cool blue eyes provided the perfect foil to the roaring fire’s red. Clearly a man with a plan, the young man's gaze wandered across the building's facade as a sharp mind mapped out possible routes of entry and escape.
Just like the palladium that was poisoning his blood, he had to cut out the toxic elements in his life.
Turning it over, Steve found a carving of an ouroboros, a serpent swallowing its own tail - a symbol of life, death and rebirth. Numb fingers traced the carving of the sea serpent in endless circles as his mind continued to whirl with the words he’d heard.
He righted himself and landed on one knee, right before they were about to slaughter a man in front of his sobbing family.
He placed it on Tony’s palm, and his fingers burned at the contact. When he looked at his hand, it was scorched, thus adding to Tony’s distress.
“And Captain America is on the threat poll?” Bruce asked, studying a list of names that had popped up on his screen.
The war was over, and while that was something to celebrate, the dwindling demand for arms meant that the Starks had to find ways to boost their economy. If they could get a farming community thriving in the midlands, they could also build a new castle to support it, and that would create new jobs for their people.
“More like hell. You begged us to let you die,” she reminded him. “In any case, Bruce created an antidote and he’s been cured.”
And how was Steve ever going to hold a candle to Tyranaksthon, with his gleaming scales and majestic horns, his gifts of magic and fire and flight?
“I’m glad," Maria said, taking his hand. "Your father was obsessed with finding you a good home. He may have gone overboard at times, but really, there's nothing he wouldn't do for you.”
By midday, after hours of aimless wandering, Tony had charted a course for them, making sure to explore his favourite exhibits multiple times before making the return trip home.
Nearby, the Hulk was struggling to free himself from a berserker pile. “Gyahhhh! Too many!” he complained.
Steve leaned in and pressed his lips softly against Tony’s open mouth. The contact was short but electrifying, and Steve felt like a newly-struck match, as the warmth spread from his lips to his cheeks and the rest of his body.
These invisible labours often went unnoticed, like the concrete that held together his mosaic of stones. Without it, a kingdom of earth’s mightiest heroes would be torn asunder, pulled apart like loose rock.
“He used to say that,” Wanda murmured, gazing thoughtfully at Tony as her trembling hands relaxed her grip on Steve’s throat.
His parents’ lights had gone out before their time. And in that moment of darkness, he’d looked up to the evening sky, found the right star and it had led him home.
Sarah’s face took on a grave expression. “I wish we had more time,” she said, with a loud sigh, “but you need to steel yourself for what’s coming. It's not going to be easy married to a king of warriors whose greatest glory is a beautiful death.”
All he made out was that he and Tony had been there the day of the dragon’s prophesied birth and that the dragon was some sort of shifter, which, according to Bruce, was pretty common these days. The revelation sparked off more questions of his own. “Was it hard? Changing for the first time? How did you even know what to do?”
Tony breathed life into a candle and held it up to illuminate the tall shelves stocked with old leather-bound volumes. The musty place smelled like a library should, but standing out from the heavy scents of smoke, earth and wood was one that belonged to Steve. Nostrils flaring, Tony followed that scent and found it thickest near the shelves housing the Valorian collection on Children’s Literature.
Steve nodded, and moved closer to the young man. “And as king, you will need your own collection of heirlooms,” he pointed out, thinking of his own sapphire ring and the curved dagger that the twins had returned to Howard on their first meeting.
Tony leaned closer. “Something’s bothering you,” he decided, as he rubbed his snout into Steve’s shoulder and took a deep whiff.
Tony took a deep breath. The concealer must have rubbed off. 24-hour coverage was such a lie. “Uh- I may have kind of- well not kind of- I didn't want to do as Dad asked.”
His brain screamed as he nodded in satisfaction at the poetic justice he'd served. Finally, he deployed his jet boots and rocket propulsion systems.
Steve was already by his side, holding Tony’s hand. “What’s going on?” he asked, looking desperately at Strange, who ignored his question in favour of observing Tony’s response.
The transformation began as he slept. Bit by bit, they broke him down, stripping away the excess and leaving behind only the essence.
“What? That’s crazy. And wrong. I don’t even get– why would– I’ve never hidden anything from anyone, anywhere. It’s none of your- you have- the nerve, the audacity. How do I know, frankly, that you’re not hiding something from me? Maybe you are. Maybe you’re trying to throw me off? Aha! Eureka! Check and mate!”
“Then, I think I have something you might want.” Steve reached into the basket and retrieved a shieldberger, gently placing the morsel into a large paw.
It didn’t even matter that the universe at stake, because to Steve, Tony was the sun, the moon and all of the stars.
“Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists. The ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's been credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years.”
They returned to the tower, surprisingly intact despite the devastation in New York. Then, showered and fell into bed, falling asleep with their arms around each other.
He looked up at the sound of Steve clearing his throat. The captain had been looking at the suit, appreciative eyes roving over the connections and curves for more than a few minutes. He could tell Steve was having trouble keeping his hands off the metal. Steve was so tactile. He just loved to touch.
He had to keep it together. With a curt nod and a sharp turn of his head, he made his way toward Rhodey and Peter, all the while feeling their curious gazes on him.
But Obie had already taken the bait. “Oh?” the dragon said, so all Tony had to do was to reel him in.
Tony's breath hitched. Because Steve was pushing all the right buttons now. Hitting all the nails on their heads.
“You’ve got to be careful with the weeds,” Jarvis told him. There’s no way to tell at first, with them pretending to be the plants you’ve sown. But time reveals their true nature. Then, you need to quickly nip the imposters in the bud. They spread so quickly, taking the light and all the good stuff with them, so much so that even the strongest and most beautiful of your plants will wither and die.”
Steve let out a deep sigh. “If you really want to come in with me, I don't think I can stop you. But there's something we should agree on.”
Tony took a deep breath and forced his lips into a smile. “Nope,” he said. “I’m all kinds of stubborn.”
Jarvis shrugged. “You know what they say? Plant and you plant together. Weed and you weed alone. Ana’s always busy when it’s time to take out the weeds. She’s gone to the atelier.” he explained, referring to Ana’s private workshop, where she made bespoke jewellery for an exclusive clientele.
Tony’s memory of the event was hazy, but he distinctly remembered the will-o-the-wisps, and how those glowing orbs of blue light had beckoned him into the woods that fateful night and led him to the prized jewel.
Thankfully, the omega wasn’t waiting for one, and had turned his attention to the interior of Tony’s car – evident from the way he fiddled with the window regulator and the locks on his door. His wandering fingers even found their way to a dial that turned on the radio, which caused the brassy notes of Harry James’ trumpet to blare through the speakers.
“I – uh – no. Not no. I’m not turning you down. I wouldn’t,” Steve insisted and mumbled something about three jobs and medical bills and a mountain of debt.
With a pained howl, Obie reverted to his human form, which was even more hideous than Tony remembered from ten years ago. The grotesque-looking dragon chased him down, before grabbing Tony by the neck and hurling him against a large stalactite.
Happy New Year! I hope everyone has a great year ahead of them, blessed with good health and happiness!
Steve’s own cheeks burned with the memory of the other night, when he’d burst into Tony’s room to find his bewildered husband soaking in the tub, under the cover of bubbles. Instead of leaving Tony to bathe in peace, Steve had insisted on adding hot stones to the tub, only to be so shocked by the scalding water it caused him to brush against bare skin. Needless to say, Steve had fled from the bathroom in favour of a cold shower instead.
All it got out of Steve was a curt nod. “Obadiah Stane,” he said, coldly. “You were, without a doubt, the worst knight I’ve ever heard of.”
“Tony, baby, sweetheart. I adore you. You know how much I do. But right now – Right now, I need the other guy.”
“Iron Man, you got a lot of strings sticking to your tail,” came Hawkeye’s voice in his ear. “Find a tight corner,” he instructed.
Thank you to the wonderful Serinah for beta-reading this and all her suggestions! Thank you to AvengersNewB for her advice on summaries!
“I don’t. It’s for you, Tony. A space for you to do whatever it is you do. I won’t pretend to know anything about it.”
Together, they flew across the Raging Serpent and into the forest, where trees rushed by in a mess of twisted, tangled branches that struggled for life in the barren woods.
There was a fair bit that was lost in translation, but he’d heard enough to cause a deep ache in his heart. All that was standing in the way of Tony’s return was the threat of Thanos, and once that was taken care of, Tony would be on his way.
“I live one floor away from you and it takes the world ending for you to visit?” Natasha complained, when she opened her door.
“He’s made it to Freoport, despite the delays from burnt bridges and scorched roads,” Sam translated.
“We’ve had one, yes. What about second breakfast? Elevenses? Luncheon? All those other things that precede tea?” Steve said, refusing to let go.
Tony buried himself under the soft sheets, wrapped up in thoughts of his new husband and his gold hair and sapphire eyes. He ran a finger over his bottom lip, which burned from the press of ruby lips. They tasted of promise, that Steve would one day be his, and when that day came, he would hold on tight to his
Alphas had needs. Tony knew that. That’s why they needed mates. To make them happy. Tony was lucky Steve hadn’t put his needs above Tony’s and forced himself on him before he was ready.
It was a sight that took his breath away - six dragons battling it out in the skies, with their unique abilities of ice, fire and lightning immortalised in the carvings. One of them was impressively sized and his stocky body was covered with spiky scales. He led two smaller dragons, one with fiery horns and the other with a forked tail that glowed with sparks.
They lighted up, like an inferior version of his holotable, to project a video of Steve bound to an upright chair. His eyes and skin were glowing hot, burning with
Tony did the opposite of that, and headed directly for the quarterdeck, which promptly burst into flames.
“Why are you doing this?” she asked, referring to his unusual invitation to have breakfast because they usually did not eat that sort of thing, at least not together.
Electroshock batons for the Black Widow. Specialised arrowheads for Hawkeye. Would Dr Banner be interested in a metal containment shell to minimise the Hulk’s damage for when he went on a rampage? An upgrade of their communications system?
Jarvis had just about finished pouring tea into their cups when they returned with dessert. “Lemon cake,” he said, cheerfully accepting the plate from Tony. Then, he turned to Ana, casually asking, “Have we got more lemons, darling?”
In the dim light, Steve spotted a flash of pearly whites and it warmed the cockles of his heart. How he wished to be the reason for that smile, for Tony to throw his head back with laughter because of what he said or did. It was just too bad he didn’t have the ability to turn into an enormous green rage monster at will.
He scooped them up gleefully, balancing as many as he could on his teaspoon. “I’m not sure I've got what it takes,” he told her, mouth full of candy.
Tony nodded. It would be okay. Home was where Steve was. The housing was compromised and couldn't be salvaged. Hopefully the replacement would be water resistant and shock proof.
"And I got married," he added, when he was able to speak again. To a man who’s sweet and kind and patient. And it was nothing I expected and everything I wanted. And I love and hate it at the same time. I mean I don’t hate it. I’m happy. I am," he clarified, after a moment's pause. "But also terrified. That it's all a dream. Like I might wake up to find that none of this is real. Or that
Just as the last of the civilians had scrambled to safety, Fury’s voice came on his personal line. “Iron Man, a nuke is headed directly for the city of New York.”
Hi! Here is the second installment of the story. I’ve added more details about Tony’s backstory. Thank you to Serinah for all her amazing suggestions! :D
Till finally, he lay sprawled on the floor, sputtering and gasping, unable to tell if he was breathing in or breathing out.
"But still I wonder,” Steve mused. “Do you think it’s true? That Thanos has recruited all of the world’s dragons to his cause?”
To Tony’s horror, the masked man wasn’t working alone. His blood turned to ice as he saw Steve rip out the car door, covering himself and Natasha, as they ran into a hail of bullets. Like the gentleman he was, Steve pushed her out of the way, taking the heat.
“What everyone does. A piece of you. The suit. Very impressive. I knew it was you, despite your ridiculous stories about a bodyguard.”
“Steve,” he said, slowly, and his teeth were grazing lightly on his lower lip. “Everyone calls me Tony, so you might as well.”
He couldn’t bring himself to look into his husband's eyes so he settled for his jawline, now covered in a five o’ clock shadow. Steve didn’t smell angry. Sometimes, Howard didn’t smell angry. He just reeked of disappointment and sadness. But Steve didn’t smell like that either.
Shovelling spoonful after spoonful into his mouth, compliments were heaped on Tony's culinary skills. And he revelled in the happy alpha scent that was filling the room. He did a good thing. Alpha was happy. And it was making him happy too.
It was a miracle they made it out of the labyrinth without passing out, stolen kisses and tight embraces in no way helping with the thin air. Finally, they fell onto the pile of blankets in a tangle of arms and legs, beside the remains of grilled fish and empty coconut husks.
He found Stripe alone, grazing on some grass, while his companions frolicked a distance away. It felt apt for his horse to be an outcast too, on the outside looking in. At least he was on the outside this time, instead of being confined to a life inside the palace and its courts.
Steve looked up in surprise and Tony couldn't help but notice how wet his face was. "You shouldn't," he argued. "I'm the worst kind of person, Tony. I'm a bully. You should stay away from me, run as far as you can."
It’s a watch, with the map of the world carved on its face, its hands automatically adjusting to its geographical location to tell the local time (3.30 p.m. in Gulmira). And always the time back home (7.00 a.m. in New York City).
The queen held out her hand, which he kissed in greeting. “We know that the valiant efforts of you and your warriors have kept our flags flying on our soil.”
“Get in the boat. Get in the boat now,” Tony said, trying to sound commanding, as desperate tears gathered in his eyes.
Steve finally tore his eyes away from the window. He looked surprised to see Tony in front of him with the unspoken question on his face.
Tony thumbed through the pages, trying to make sense of its inconsistencies and contradictions. He struggled to find something, a clue, to shed light on this perplexing situation. Then, he reached the final page. It was a summary of the assessment -
Finally, he allowed himself to break down the dam and open the floodgates. He had tried too hard to be too brave for too long. And through the tears, it became clear just what he had to do. Then, slowly, carefully, he pieced himself together. The only way out was up.
Steve gave him an amused smile. “Someday, you'll have to tell me what that means,” he said, referring to the endearment in Tony’s mother tongue.
Strange landed in front of them and held his hands in front of him. “Those attacking on a whim, will face the Shield of Seraphim,” the sorcerer said, before he erected a red filigree shield, which sent the enemy rider and horse flying backward into the charging troops.
Tony tried to twist out of his firm grasp. “Steve,” he hissed. “We’ve got a ten-second window. Miss it and we’re supper.”
Tony sank into his chair, temporarily relieved, when Nat showed up on the adjacent screen. She was sitting on the assassin’s shoulders, trying to strangle him with a garotte. She looked like she was saying, “You could have at least remembered me”. He obviously did not, tossing her off and onto the bonnet of a car with nary a second glance.
The room had filled up completely with smoke and visibility was zero. Steve had to fumble for the medallion, and strain his eyes for its signature blue glow.
“You know, Killian?” Tony said, walking towards the alpha. “After you've said so much, I still don’t know. Who, really, is the Mandarin?”
For a few moments, they just gazed at each other, reluctant to shatter the blessed silence. Then, Tony took his hand and led Steve to bed, ignoring his protests as he lay Steve down and pulled the covers over his exhausted body.
Shaking his head, Steve took his leave and headed toward the rock formation in search of peace and quiet, with Bucky and Nat’s voices fading behind him. They were at it again, bantering like an old married couple. And while it was usually cute, today it was only making him more nervous than he already was.
“How old is he? And what does he look like?” Steve asked, curious about the friendly neighbourhood Iron Man who often made the news for foiling bank robberies and helping old ladies with directions.
“Not possible when you take all the stupid with you,” Steve managed to say before Bucky pulled him into a tight hug.
They were quirky and goofy and could only be the work of one person he knew. Tony laughed, finally recognising who Ana’s mysterious client was.
During the board meeting, Tony announced his decision to shut down the weapons manufacturing department, which was met with a fair bit of resistance. Swords were crossed and guns were drawn. And Obie blew Steve’s fuse when he put his arm around Tony’s shoulder and tried to alpha-splain why this wasn’t a good decision. So, Steve pulled him off and slammed him into a wall, before calmly remarking that his lack of faith was disturbing.
Steve laughed as he held it above him, just out of Tony’s reach. “Yes,” he said. “But first, you were saying?”
“The dragonstones,” Tony breathed, in an awed voice, and turned his palms outward to catch the colourful lights descending upon them as the images of Rex and Thanos faded from view.
I might have underestimated how hard it is to be a wife, a mom of two while trying to have a job all at the same time. And because my husband (who is a wonderful person and father) doesn't quite approve of my writing indulgence, I sort of have to do this in the middle of the night when everyone is asleep.
Landing on the soft grass just outside of Shieldberg’s walls, Tony felt the weight of the world lifting from his wings, which disappeared into his shoulders as he returned to his human form. And as they crossed the threshold, hand in hand, Tony paused to gaze at his hand, bare but for the single gold band around his ring finger. It glowed softly in the moonlight, and looked brighter in the absence of those dazzling stones.
Tony seethed. What was the point of being an Avenger if they couldn’t avenge the people who needed it most? How many lives had to be lost before they were allowed in?
He could still see the vivid images in his mind. The metal arm and the man who wore it, tragically beautiful and beautifully tragic.
Tony knew the official story, about the Howling Commando and his courage, resilience and loyalty. A true friend, he stood by Steve, through thick and thin, and they were inseparable on both schoolyard and battlefield.
The twins had arrived in his absence, and Wanda had taken Steve’s place on the edge of the bed, using her magic to lull Tony into deep, restorative sleep. Out of habit, Pietro was standing protectively beside her, despite the lack of any immediate threats.
“No drink? You sure? We’re all having one.” Tony said, and gaped openly at Thor who was slurping his coffee noisily, clearly enjoying the beverage.
Killian stumbled backwards, shocked by the impact of the successive shots, still unaware of what had happened to his body. “You will never -,” he began, faltering, before taking the one-step shortcut to the lobby.
“You’d have liked him,” Steve said, when he finished. “He was a great friend, a good person. The best kind.”
Tickled by the hot breath on his neck, Steve chuckled and gave him a half-hearted push, but Tony only pulled him closer and licked the side of his scruffy face. “No, no,” Steve wheezed, and continued to laugh as he escaped his embrace to race Tony across the landing pad to the locked gates that led into the castle, where they finally came to a stop.
Bruce was by his side, handkerchief in hand. “How are you feeling?” he asked, as he dabbed away the beads of perspiration gathered on Steve’s forehead.
Tony frowned as he reached out for Steve’s chin, and turned it slightly so he could look in his blue eyes. “Of course, it matters – it matters to me. I need you, Steve. I can’t do this by myself. Not half as good at anything without you around.”
“Pretty much everyone in this room, yes,” Steve answered. “And Bucky too. He’s probably suffered the most for it, could someday write a book on our swashbuckling adventures.”
Watching Obie plunge to his death was like having his heart ripped out of him for the second time in the same day. But the moment he breathed his last was when Tony felt like he could breathe, really breathe again.
They pulled him into their house, and sat him down by the fireplace to warm up. He wasn’t ready to talk and they weren’t the sort to push. So, they fed him with apple tortes, chocolate souffles and butter cake, all of which helped somewhat to
Ivan bellowed as lighting sizzled out of his eyes and tail while he tried breaking out of Peter’s hold.
“If the emperor is after the heartstone, I don’t have it,” Tony told him. “I saw it once. Then he-who-shall-not-be-named hit me with a fireball. Don’t remember much after that,” he said.
Howard said. Like everything else he'd ever done for him. Striking him was for his own good too. So, why then, did he almost seem to feel bad about it, eyes red and face pale as he looked him over to see the damage he’d caused?
“Then, we move on,” she said. “My child, we have no control over life and death. We’ve never had. All we can do is love them as best as we can while they’re alive.”
Bruce dabbed at the wounds to clean the dried blood, and rinsed the towel in a basin of warm water, before he started over. As he went over one of the deeper gashes, Tony whimpered and twisted his body, even as his eyes stayed closed.
Did he really think Tony was going to stay forever? Living in their little stone cottage and baking bread, with the occasional trip to some offshore island? It was an alliance they had between them, and that’s all it would ever be.
“Are you?” he asked, turning the question back to Pierce, because Tony, for once, wasn’t the one with something to hide.
In a fit of anger, Pietro flung the shield onto the ground, leaving cracks in the marble floor. “Then, why did Father have to die?” he asked, sending chills down Tony’s spine with his frosty tone.
Rhodey’s voice was on the comms again, confirming that he and Nat had neutralised the threats, curing some and killing others, which they reacted to with little whoops of victory.
Ivan was right behind Tony, conjuring up a thunderstorm. A crack of his tail and one of the trees split right down the middle. Another split more trees into two.
Steve’s brows furrowed at the sight of Tony’s medallion, hanging around the neck of the statue. As far as Steve knew, Tony never took it off. Why did he have to? Was someone making him?
Tony smiled in spite of the pang in his heart, as he remembered the giddy feeling of falling in love. There was a time he’d been just as happy as Bucky was. He’d felt invincible and powerful, with the love of his life by his side. Indulgently, he watched Bucky’s expressions of happiness, living vicariously through him, as the lovesick knight went about retrieving his sword. Tony dived down, and picked up the knight, whom he returned to his anxious steed.
on Steve's bookshelf and had carried it off to bed the previous night, curious to find out what Valorians thought of the titular mythical beasts. Apparently, he’d bitten off more than he could chew, and had realised after a few pages, that the book was published in High Valorian, which was the much-forgotten language of Steve’s forefathers.
Tony's heart stopped as he watched metal fingers wrap around Steve’s neck, squeezing mercilessly as Steve's face turned red from the strain.
“Yup, I was thorough," he said, eyes flicking upwards for a quick second. "What about you? Know anything about me?” he asked, curious about what the captain had heard before agreeing to this marriage.
“But this is ridiculous,” Steve complained. “Why bother with repopulation if they wont give us the time we need to find the right person with whom to raise the family? How do they expect us to find this person before we’re 25? And why 25? Before that, everything’s a free market, and after, it becomes a command economy. For a country that prides itself on democracy, this is a crying shame, because this isn’t freedom – "
Tony stepped backwards as Steve reached for him, as if he wanted to rub the bruise out. As if he could rub out the ink on the papers they had signed. Maybe that’s how it worked for super soldiers, but Tony’s experience was different. Even when marks faded, scars remained. And the pain never went away.
“Tesaurimea,” he murmured into the dip of Steve’s neck. “I want this. I want you. You have no idea.”
He turned towards his husband and circled his arms around his neck, his arc reactor fitting nicely between Steve's shoulder blades. And it felt like all their parts, made exactly right for each other, were falling into place with the most satisfying of clicks.
“I love your mouth – and everything that comes out of it – and your eyes and your hair and everything else I haven’t had the chance to see.”
“He’s noticed,” Bucky said drily as he rode up on Blaze. Addressing Steve, he dropped his voice to a whisper, “It’s a horseriding term. No need to get all flustered, even if your new husband is very fetching.”
“Indeed,” Strange said. “It is the only story that accounts for the dragonstones in our universe.” With a clap of his hands, the sorcerer brought forward the images of six different-coloured crystals, positioning them directly over the flower vase. They lighted up as they were named: the bloodstone, mindstone, fangstone, scalestone, iristone and the heartstone. “For centuries, many have tried to collect the stones, be it for noble reasons or personal gain, but no being has come close to wielding the powers of Rex, except for maybe Thanos himself.”
Peter, who’d already stretched his tail to thrice its original length, coiled himself around Ivan’s lower body and spiralled around Ivan’s torso so he could bind it to the sea stack.
Steve gripped Tony’s shoulders, and held him together as Tony melted into the touch. Tony buried his face in Steve’s shoulder and hot tears fell from his eyes, which soaked Steve’s tunic. Steve might have pulled him in closer than was strictly necessary, as he selfishly wished to keep him in his arms for as long as he could.
Steve put his arms around his back, and rested them at the small of his waist. “Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, do anything like that again,” he said, softly. “If something happened to you, I would die,” he finished, as his chin came to rest on the top of Tony’s head.
. Steve knew a little bit about lodestones himself, having had some success with his latest spinners. Yet, the way the shield moved defied all explanation.
He was going to bed. Breakfast would be at eight the next morning and he didn’t want to be late. Besides, Tony was exhausted. He would close his eyes and drift off into a deep, restful slumber, fall fast asleep so he didn’t have to think of Steve.
“It is more than what others would have tried. You will make a fine king,” Steve said, and silently pledged to back the young man’s claim to the throne, as was his birthright.
. Proving they were the lowest of the low. Whatever tiny misgivings Tony had about his mission vaporised.
"Thought you didn't like to be handed things," Steve muttered as he watched Tony tear the wrapping open.
The bubbling inferno raging inside began to simmer. Tony could never stay angry with Steve for very long, not with the way he looked when he made these heartfelt promises. “Then, come here,” he murmured, less gruffly, now that his heart had slowed to its normal rate. “Need you right now,” he added, and curled a possessive wing around his man.
All night, every night, he’d traced the metal blades with his arm, closing his eyes as the red star burnt in his mind. That was how he slept, kept impossibly warm by a man who spent far too much time being cold.
was one of his least favourites. But Tony was learning that there were greater horrors than a clear-cut
“Nope,” Steve said. He pulled the prince toward him and inspected his face and body under the moonlight. Much to his relief, the young prince was miraculously unscathed.
“You going to spend your money trying to win me a stuffed bear?” he asked, because that was the yardstick of true love.
“It was warm last night. With you,” Tony added for the benefit of his oblivious husband, notoriously slow on the uptake when it came to such things.
“Actually,” Tony began, looking at him uneasily. “I was hoping to be on the barges. Need to make sure it all goes smoothly, you know?”
In the quiet of the antechamber, where the only audible sounds were Steve’s footsteps pacing the room, Tony could hear the joyful sounds of merrymaking inside the Great Hall.
Steve seemed a little insecure. And Tony wondered if it had anything to do with the hours and secrets he was keeping, trying to hold down two jobs and a husband all at once.
“But everything special about you - came - out - of - a - bottle,” he said, punctuating the words like stabs to the heart.
It had to be the farthest thing from the truth, but the words had given him the courage to accept Tony’s mission, and he had kept the stone safe until Tony had needed it most.
“No. I think it’s your eyes. And your smile,” he offered and watched it grow brighter and warmer, against the midday sun.
Steve nodded in understanding, well aware that the twins had taken advantage of Thanos’ retreat to right some of his wrongs, and that the mindstone had been instrumental in liberating the humans under the monster’s control.
“You all right?” Tony asked, as he turned his head to check on his rider, after a particularly close shave.
A horn rang out and floated across the ocean into their ears. It was followed by a series of different horns at different pitches, said to match the battle cries of their namesakes. Straining his ears, Steve could make out the chords of their national anthem, which heralded the arrival of the Howling Commandos and their ships – Fury’s
Resting his legs on a large rock, Steve got out his knife and the conical object, whittling it down to streamline its shape. The quintessential child's toy, a spinning top, had long delighted children of all cultures, and Steve was no different. Time always seemed to stop as he watched it defy gravity to spin upright, as if by magic. Besides, it always seemed to slow his racing heart and gave his hands something to do.
Tony took the gem from him, and studied it curiously for a short moment, before slipping it into his pocket. “This is all our fault,” Tony sighed, and buried his face in his hands as he sank down into the sand.
He was in the Mark VII. It was a childish thing to do. But the suit always made him feel safe, and powerful. He was gearing up for an uphill battle, one he wasn’t sure he’d win. And if he lost, he’d have to surrender it to the powers that be.
By the light of the setting sun, they watched as the lovebirds danced around each another in a ritual. How they took turns to be the pursuer and the pursued, the give and take, the back and forth, before finally meeting in the middle.
Tony suspected an issue with the motor connected to the drive belt so he took the turntable apart to confirm that. After removing debris from the motor and replacing the belt, which he'd picked up on the last shopping trip, he cleaned the other components with a rag and some rubbing alcohol. But in his excitement to reassemble the device, he dropped the stylus, which snapped at a weak point upon contact with the ground.
A fresh wave of berserkers threatened to overwhelm their forces so Tony breathed down fire, and herded the newcomers into a new portal that sent them back to hell.
Steve almost said, mesmerised by the dragon’s bright eyes. He was. And charming too. Steve took a step back, before he could do something stupid, like touch the dragon, or worse, kiss his nose.
With Bruce’s help, they cultivated new strains, which adapted better to their warm and wet climate. These new plants, that one could now find all over Kingsgarden, had small leaves, and bright pink flowers. And while the berries were just as delicious, there was a marked difference in their taste.
“We’re dealing with powerful magic,” Lord Strange reminded her. “We can’t always predict how it would react to our treatment.
An alpha with warm hugs, soft kisses and an impossibly gentle touch. A knot which filled the emptiness that had been his life. And a bite which made Tony’s head explode in a litany of “yours, yours, yours” as fervent rejoinders of “mine, mine, mine” echoed in his ear and reverberated in his heart.
“Hill!” Clint screamed, as he caught a shieldmaiden who’d dropped like an anchor, her gaze still and body unmoving.
“Good save,” Jarvis commended, accepting the bowl with a look of delight. “You know how fond I am of poached eggs. And this, it looks splendid.”
He plucked at the loose threads on his jacket, surprised at how much they resembled fraying insulation, a potential hazard unless masked with tape.
Tony felt himself rising into the air before his body hit the ground painfully, but the claws around his neck were mercifully gone. As oxygenated blood rushed back to his head and restored his sense of sight, Tony looked up to see Thanos raising his purple claws into the air, all ready to clap.
Bucky was the first to set off, eager to get a head start on his mission. The rest cheered, waving as their flag fluttered behind him. But Tony couldn’t. Because just before Bucky mounted his horse, he’d waved goodbye to Tony. And on his hand was a gold band with a bright blue stone, sparkling like the stars of their flag. Tony had just seen it in the garden.
Tony would cross that bridge when he got to it. Till then, he would keep his mind open and his heart free.
“And you have,” Steve reminded him. “So, you can go back and tell them how you’ve done that – and managed to save the day too.”
Instinctively, Steve closed his fist around it, and took the medallion into his own hands. It was Tony’s and no one else could have it, not even Tyranakthon himself.
She did a good job of hiding her sorrow. Someone who didn’t know her might even say she glowed. But Tony knew how to recognise the cracks. And stars shone brightest just before they collapsed.
What did the country do with unstable alpha heroes? They gave them volatile omegas to make them happy. Tony would have laughed, if he hadn't been too busy being horrified, when he first heard of his father’s plans to marry him to Captain Rogers. He was supposed to help! Do his part for the country like a war prize.
Tony remembered a man who loved Science and Technology. Obie gave him his first toolbox, convinced his dad to send him to MIT, offered to marry him – wow he really dodged
“Then, it just might work,” Tony said, and went back to pacing the room, while he mumbled something to himself.
Yet, when Wanda pulled at the thread again and he felt his mind beginning to unravel, he found himself pulling right back.
Cold mist hung in the air and softened the bright lights from the ships below them. Unable to move beyond the line of defence created by the Howling Commandos, and bereft of their serpents and monsters, the weapon-deprived Anguisians had begun to beat a hasty retreat.
Tony cursed his hands and their inability to leave things alone. It was supposed to be a quick fix. But he’d bitten off more than he could chew. And in this case, broken it too.
The room tensed as its occupants waited for Fury to answer the question. Thor and Natasha approached the director, circling him without saying a word. Just before he could respond, Steve returned, slamming a large HYDRA gun on the table.
They listened carefully as the footsteps got closer. Then, Rhodey knocked one of them out with a well-positioned blow to the head. Tony pointed his firearm at the other one, experimenting with different angles to maximise the intimidating effect he was failing to create.
Tony gazed at his husband, his eyes tracing over his messy hair, the curve of his cheekbones and the set of his jaw. He took in the red-rimmed eyes, the wet lashes, the tear tracks on gaunt cheeks. He could have sworn those lines on his forehead hadn’t been there before.
Bucky eyed him coldly, flicking the dagger in his hand as he walked toward the messenger. “You tried to kill Natalia. That’s the last thing you’ll ever do, pal.” Swiftly, he hauled him to his feet, keeping a firm grasp on his shoulders, even as he looked toward Steve, who gave the knight a small nod.
made me anything like this,” Steve lamented. “It’s so beautiful," he continued, running his fingers over the weapon lovingly.  “And is Iron Man an Avenger now? Because funny, Fury forgot to mention. Again.”
Tony’s eyes drifted upwards to study the sun-kissed hair and brilliant blue eyes. With his finger, he traced the pink lips, appreciating the crescent of his smile. He gazed at the star of Steve’s uniform with the same focus he gave to his birthday candles and remembered how, many moons ago, upon those blue flames, he'd wished for the universe.
More recently, he’d pulled the fangstone from the mouth of Fin Fang Foom as the imperial bled out. He’d ransomed the scalestone from Drax the Destroyer while using his daughter as leverage. Having failed to capture Shieldberg, Thanos’ fleet had sailed to Attilan, to invade the country and raid its vaults for the iristone.
It made sense, that Steve would think Rhodey was Iron Man. Rhodey could handle the suit. And Tony needed a sidekick. Next Christmas, he’d make Rhodey a suit, something less ostentatious. He’d always liked silver. Give him a kickass name.
The captain stepped aside, inviting Tony to enter the house before him. At least he didn’t try to carry Tony over the threshold, driving home the fact that he was being married against his will.
She deflecting the question with one of her own. "Would you?" she asked in a low voice as a smile played on her lips.
Steve turned away quickly, as if to hide his face and Tony wondered how much more pain he was concealing behind his smile.
“What an enigma your father was,” Jarvis said, looking outside, eyes finally settling on the small road leading to the main house. “He expressly forbade you from driving, punished you for doing so, and finally decided on teaching you himself.”
The horsemen charged with great speed, with their spears held high above their heads. One of the faster ones broke through the ranks, and came at them so quickly that Tony barely had time to blink.
What was left of the free world would turn their eyes toward Valoria, in the hope that they would put a stop to the emperor’s conquest. And they would be led by Steve, a brave warrior with blue eyes and red lips. Lips that were opening and closing and speaking at the very moment.
Tony always read the prophecy with a healthy dose of skepticism. Yet, here, in the heart of the cave, surrounded by these elaborate carvings, Tyranaksthon felt more real than ever.
They finished dining in companionable silence, before a smiling Sarah got up to leave, with Tony following her to the door. She turned back to face him at the threshold of their home, and surprised him with a warm hug. Finally, with a kiss to his cheek and a swish of her dress, she was gone.
“Yeah. We don’t really need to start a conversation,” Tony said, and directed their attention to Ivan who was coming back for them.
When Tony thought about hitting rock bottom, he never thought it would literally be due to a rock, a piece of rubble that had got trapped between layers of his clothing from the explosion.
Tony shot him a look and schooled his face into a serious expression. “I do,” he said, solemnly, like he was repeating the vows, just for him. The teasing smile was back on his face in a moment. “You owe me a kiss,” he complained, “A proper one. Otherwise, the marriage won’t hold up.”
Steve wasn’t even surprised. It was always about the dragon. That was all Tony ever seemed to talk about. “Yes? Which one?” he asked, trying not to let his irritation show.
Yet, Tony’s condition was deteriorating by the day. causing Steve to fear that he might never again gaze into those brilliant brown eyes that once dazzled with shimmering flecks of gold.
As he waved back at Steve, the light fell on the stones on his finger. He realised that happiness, true happiness had always been in his hands. He’d found himself and his family. He had built them a home. And that joy, that effervescent bubbling in his heart, it was real.
Pietro’s eyes grew wide as he cycled between shock and betrayal and anger. Then, with their faces set into firm lines of determination, the twins turned on the emperor, who was sitting on the throne once more, still looking confident in his righteousness.
Following that little display, they peeled off their photostatic veils, tickets to the most exciting box seats in the century, revealing their real identities to those present.
He paused at the sound of Steve’s voice, and his breathing began to slow down. For a while, he buried his tearful face into Steve’s chest, enjoying a few moments of silence.
The bite had consummated their bond. A magnetic system, an in-built compass. To each other. Was it too broken to work? Or was he too broken to save?
Bucky, who’d just been saying his goodbyes to the captains, seemed to know at once that something was off. His face fell and the blood drained from it. Then, he broke into a slow jog.
