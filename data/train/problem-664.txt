When John first moved to the cabin, he had a dog. It was a given that if he was going to hunt and live alone that he needed a dog to help him and keep him company. He wanted to be alone but a dog did not count and he’d very much enjoyed having it there to talk to. He especially enjoyed how it couldn’t talk back but rather looked at him happily and wagged its tail as dogs are want to do. He was very fond of the dog and very glad of the company out there in the wilderness.
“Believe me,” Sherlock said, folding his coat more tightly around himself and stepping towards the door. “I’ve had my absolute fill of foolishness.”
“To you as well,” said John. “I can’t believe you walked here. You could have called, or waited for the weather to clear, or—“
I made it to just after four a.m. before I gave in and showed up at John’s hotel room door. I knocked rapidly, and it opened in less than five seconds. There was John, standing in his underpants and a t-shirt, looking like he’d been through hell and back. The lines on his face were long, the circles dark under his eyes. He sagged with relief against the door frame when he saw it was me.
Suddenly, they heard shouting from down the beach, coming from the children. Lestrade groaned. “Bloody hell, not again… I guess we’d better go see what they’re up to.”
Anna thought suddenly. Had he also paid them to act like her friends? Had he paid David to… to… flirt with her? To build up her confidence, perhaps? She stared at him, trying to decide, and unable to do so. She didn’t know how to decipher what was real, and what was a lie.
There was a knock at the door, and I jumped two feet in the air. I turned and opened it wide, and there was John, still holding his shoes, looking so obviously like he’d just woken up from having been shagged senseless.
“Clearly.” Sherlock just wanted him to shut up now, leave him to his thoughts. He was still angry with him, anyway, for involving Anna in the whole mess. “When will he be ready to leave?”
Anna scowled and muttered something under her breath, something that most definitely included the word “wanker.”
“I almost didn’t figure it out,” said Sherlock, mildly. “I’d been so wrapped up with being a father for the last thirteen years that I lost something of myself—of my observation skills, to be exact.”
Carruthers uncrossed his legs, then crossed them the other way. “Alright, detective, why don’t you tell me what you know already, and my darling wife and I will fill in the gaps?” He delicately reached up and took his glasses off his face, then breathed softly on the lenses.
Sherlock stared at Molly, in shock. “Was this one with the other two?” he asked, his voice urgent, “on the boat?”
We showed up to the scene, a manufacturing plant, and Anderson was already there, collecting samples. “Well well well, look who decided to grace us with his presence,” he sneered. “What, the one-offs are too boring now? Have to wait for at least three bodies before you lend us a few of your precious brain cells?”
I bent over the body and started to examine it. The cuts were indeed meticulous. And the bruises were on both sides of the body, larger ones up by the sternum, and—
The cat appeared out of nowhere and jumped tentatively back onto John’s lap. He reached out to pet it again. “I still can’t believe he
Sherlock had got closer but hadn’t said anything more. John didn’t look at him but he felt his presence like a tree or a bush or a pile of wood under a tarp, a fixture in the environment and nothing more with no bearing on John’s work. He could watch if he liked. It was no concern of John’s.
,” he echoed, his glare boring a hole into her skull. She snatched the headphones away before he could say anything else.
“If I became involved at this juncture, something wouldn’t seem right to some over-enthusiastic reporter, and the ruse might be exposed; at which point the British Government would have no qualms giving me over to the dogs,” Mycroft told him, as a matter of fact. “It is the nature of the intelligence world—sacrifice one for the good of the whole.”
Sherlock clearly expected that revelation to elicit a profound reaction on John’s part, but, of course, John had nothing to show. “What?”
Sherlock finished climbing the stairs and stood in front of John’s view of the bedroom. John’s gaze remained where it was as he shook his head. “Bloody hell,” he swore, quietly. “She lives here. You…”
Lestrade blinked and opened his mouth. “The—the woman, I killed her. She came at me with a knife.” He paused. “The man, Carruthers, he surrendered. So I arrested him.”
“Don’t forget, John,” said Sherlock, his voice gone up an octave, “she was perfectly willing to sacrifice both our lives on a whim. Do you really want someone like
Sherlock glanced down at their hands together. “A bit tired, actually,” he said, pulling his away and tucking it under the blanket. “I think I’d like to take a nap.”
Sherlock immediately began to inspect all of the furniture and trinkets, the magazines, the books on the shelves…
Sherlock swallowed. That’s most certainly not how it was going to go. But he was here now, and he had to look. To see. He started forward carefully, examining the rubble, shifting larger pieces to see underneath. He searched for several minutes with no luck, when a thought suddenly struck him: What if John escaped? What if he got out before the bomb exploded? What if he was alive? Sherlock’s heart leapt into his throat.
“Ahhhh,” John moaned, and if I hadn’t just come twenty minutes earlier, I would have done then without even touching myself. My cock spasmed and I groaned around John’s, badly needing more. More contact, more sounds from John, more of him—
, he almost finished. They did, or used to anyway from what he remembered. Sherlock would be under the water for thirty minutes at least and John would have no hot water of his own if he had been planning to take a shower after. Sherlock would claim he lost track of time thinking about cases but John thought it might have had something to do with the four-treatment hair wash he used. But John didn’t say any of that or bring it up because it happened a long time ago to another man in another life and it wasn’t relevant anymore. There was a two-in-one bottle of shampoo and a bar of soap, and John hadn’t seen Sherlock bring in a backpack of any supplies so what he had would have to do.
seen a little boy around, and that the Carruthers seemed like polite, decent people, Lestrade had dropped the whole thread of inquiry and chalked it all up to coincidence and poor intuition.
John sat completely still. These were questions he always wanted the answers to, and thought he’d never have.
“You’ll just have to get a more appropriate coat, Sherlock,” said Mrs. Hudson. “Something that can be wiped and cleaned easily. It’s just not economical to wear expensive clothing when you have a baby.”
Sherlock was quiet then and John still hadn’t looked at him and kept on fidgeting with the blanket, folding and creasing and rolling and unrolling and pretty soon it was so quiet that it was as if Sherlock wasn’t there at all. John finally looked up again and Sherlock said, “Do you want to see her?”
I felt the warmth of his fingers through my sleeve. An intrusion of my own bodily temperature. It felt foreign and welcome at the same time. Part of me wanted to grab his face and kiss him. To give in, and let everything else go to shit. But I couldn’t do that. If I didn’t stop this now, I wouldn’t be able to go back. I would never get the Work back, again.
And now he was lying on his mattress, his sheets and quilt over his head, breathing in the hot, thinning air trapped underneath. He brought them all off and down to his belly with a rush of wind, and sighed. He looked up at the ceiling again.
Mycroft began to come round more often after that, several times a week. Sherlock tried not to be too annoyed by it—truthfully, he was grateful for the company. He would even help him talk through cases, from time to time, though that was actually
Sherlock adjusted the volume and then turned back to John and Anna. He took off his coat and scarf with flourish as the music started, tossing them delicately onto the couch. “I’ve been waiting for a case like this,” he said, to no one in particular. Then he held out his hands with a sharp, “Give her to me,” and John, completely out of his element, handed over the poor wailing child. Without a moment’s hesitation, Sherlock settled her in his arms and began to dance around the living room
. And pretend that John hadn’t pulled away so soon, that he’d kissed back again. Pretend they’d gotten hungrier for it, John threading his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, Sherlock sliding his arms around John’s waist, their lips parting to touch tongues, just a bit—
Every blowjob John could remember getting, all from women, had been dirty, depraved—rather porny, to be crude. This, however, was anything but; it was simply a physical expression of closeness. Sherlock wrapped his hands round John’s bum and pulled his body deeper into his mouth, licking and sucking John’s prick with finesse, with firm, thorough movements, slowly and deliberately. John moaned aloud as he watched it happening, running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair over and over, chanting, “I love you, I love you, oh God, oh yes, yes,
Sherlock took a deep breath. “It’s a long story,” he said, deflecting. “And you have to get to the cemetery.”
Mycroft Holmes had never been the type of man to hold a grudge. He considered himself above that petty, human resentment. He was a smarter man, a stronger man, a more important man, than to get mixed up in all that business. But oh, how he’d held a grudge against Jim Moriarty. Not only had the man been a thorn in the country’s side and turned his brother’s life a living hell, but he’d made a fool of Mycroft, ruined his reputation, and had almost gotten him fired. Mycroft wanted to destroy Moriarty in every possible sense of the word. So most of what he’d said to Molly was true—he’d planned to exploit Sherlock and Anna to bring down his mortal enemy—but his reasoning behind it was not for some noble purpose, to protect his country or whatever it was he’d told her.
“Choose, Anna,” breathed Moriarty. “Shoot John, and Sherlock lives. Or keep John alive, and shoot Sherlock instead. It’s a simple decision: one,” he flipped one hand’s palm up towards Sherlock, “or the other.” He flipped the other towards John. “Whichever one you choose,” he added, closing his hands into fists, “I’ll let you both walk out of this building, scot-free.”
“Interesting,” he said, scarfing down the rest of his meal and brushing the crumbs off his hands. “I guess we’d better go solve it before he starts chopping them up beyond recognition.” He grabbed his coffee and headed back to the stairs.
Sherlock steadied John’s torso, John’s shirt unbuttoned and stuck, sopping, to his sides. “I don’t know,” he said, heavily. “I’m sorry. I wish they weren’t—“
When John woke up again, it was dark outside. He sat up suddenly, angry with himself that he’d slept the whole day through. His headache had subsided, but he still felt unbalanced and fog-brained—and he had to pee like the dickens.
Sherlock sighed, heavily. “I did feel something, then,” he confessed. “But it’s been thirteen years.”
The fuzzy bubble Sherlock had been living in all day day dissolved in an instant. And he lashed out.
“This is all very touching,” interrupted Moriarty, “and if it were any other day I’d say keep going; it’ll make for a far more entertaining end. But unfortunately I have other appointments on my schedule, so we’re going to have to get this party started.”
Together they made several trips and brought the wood to the woodshed along the side of the house and stacked it tall until it reached the ceiling. Then John shut the door and wheeled the remaining half-barrow full up to the house. He opened the front door and stepped inside, taking off his shoes in the entryway. “Come on,” he said to Sherlock, who was still standing outside and watching him. “Before we let too much heat out.” The house was only heated by the stove, and while wood was not scarce it was time consuming and exhausting to prepare and John was not keen to waste any of it.
In the morning John could tell that more snow had fallen even before he’d got out of bed. There was a certain silence that accompanied fresh snowfall. John could hear it now. He sat up and folded back the quilt and put on his socks and jeans and a jumper over his vest. He made the bed and then quietly opened the door in case Sherlock was sleeping. He wasn’t though. Instead Sherlock turned his head from where he sat at the table, evidently watching the snow fall over a steaming mug of tea. He saw John and smiled.
Once he was done with the torso, John stepped back. “Sherlock, I… I’m sorry, but I really should look…”
John was sitting and resting his arms on his knees and he looked up when he heard the door open. “You found me,” he said. “Figured you would.”
I didn’t really like it. Sex, I mean. I’d never really liked anything about it, except maybe the beginning, before it was actually had, the
“You really didn’t need any convincing, did you?” Moriarty went on, his eyes demonic. “You did it because you
Anna breathed out slowly, watching the jet of air turn to fog before her eyes. “He was kind of like an imaginary friend,” she said. “I used to talk to him all the time. For a while I couldn’t fall asleep until I’d told him all about my day. He was always such a good listener… though he seems pretty good in real life, too.”
Ella turned back to Sherlock when John had closed the door. “I wanted John to leave because I wanted to give you some advice.”
Molly felt extremely uncomfortable. “Well,” she said slowly, looking back at her hands in her lap. “I think he was rather using me, too.”
“Fumigating?” Sherlock popped up off the couch and spun around to stare at her. “Why? And where did you come from? How long have you been in here?”
Immediately, Sherlock knew something was wrong. “You aren’t going to role-play, are you? So why are we here?” But he’d deduced the answer before he’d even finished asking the question.
him. “You don’t mean that,” he said, in a small voice, still, still not believing me, and something inside me snapped.
John’s eyes lit up, and he turned to Mary for her approval. “Oh, yes, of course,” she said, rolling her eyes and smiling. “Go for it.”
Anna sighed. “Oh, Dad,” she muttered under her breath. She turned back to Sherlock. “He’s a complete dickhead, sometimes.”
Oh God, what if he’d fallen for John a long time ago? What if he’d been living with this unrequited love, the curse of his own words still haunting him, “I’m married to my work,” and with John’s heterosexuality vocalized at every possible moment. And John had gotten married, once-and-for-all off limits… but now he was no longer married (John felt a terrible, aching pain in his heart at the realization). Did the fact that John was available… did that cause Sherlock to reopen his heart, rekindle whatever fire had been extinguished by John’s marriage?
John moved his fingers over Sherlock’s lips, sliding them back and forth between the iterations of the word. His thumb pushed a little ways into the opening, gently running over the tips of Sherlock’s teeth, and Sherlock closed his lips around the thumb and drew it deeper into his mouth. “Oh,” John gasped, as he felt the warm wetness of Sherlock’s tongue. He shoved his thumb in further, as far as the back of Sherlock’s molars, and Sherlock hollowed his cheeks as he sucked it in. It gave John an idea of what he’d rather put in there instead, and he shivered with the expected pleasure of it.
“That’s it,” Carruthers purred, in an eerily soothing voice. “Let’s hear it, Sherlock.” He squeezed again and thrust his cock into Sherlock’s arsehole more ferociously.
John could almost hear it click into place in his head. “Because you said you’d help her. She thought we would help her.”
“Sherlock!” he’d shouted, entering the living room to see Sherlock sitting upright on the couch, staring straight ahead with the blankest expression John had seen him have, ever, and that was really saying something. And John had tried to talk to him, get his attention, asking “What the hell was that?” and other such questions, not getting a response, until he’d waved a hand in front of Sherlock’s face and Sherlock finally stood up and went to lock himself in his bedroom.
I supposed four months of “shy virgin” was too many, and John had started to become suspicious. Why he’d chosen this moment in time to bring it up, though, I didn’t know. He acted so irrationally, sometimes. I looked up from my microscope and blinked at him. “Of course I am.”
For some reason, John blushed. It was something about the look Sherlock gave him, something about the way his eyes were dancing…. John was lucky that his hands were covering most of his face.
He maneuvered his head around to look me in the eye. “Are you okay? With this, I mean. With...” He swallowed. His hands were moving over my chest, the spots where his fingertips touched tingling with electricity on my skin. Even through my shirt.
Sherlock stood up angrily, the stool scraping the floor and teetering as he left its seat. He whirled on John. “What did you find out about the boat?”
Lestrade had picked a lot of locks as a young lad. He’d grown up in a fairly small town, and he and his mates would often break into their friends’ houses or local storefronts and such and pull pranks on the residents. He’d had his fair share of peer pressure, wanted to be the “bad boy” and all that, but honestly… he did it because his father would fly into a red-eyed rage when he got caught. And there was nothing he loved more than pissing off that no-good, stick-up-the-arse wanker.
“I know,” John murmured in his ear after it was over, Sherlock catching his breath on John’s shoulder. He twirled a lock of Sherlock's hair round his finger absentmindedly. "You love me too.”
Mycroft looked at her a moment, with a sort of bored expression that only a Holmes could make. “First of all,” he said, as if it was unbearably tedious for him to explain himself, “you are the child of a highly intelligent criminal and an extremely clever ex-assassin, raised by a man who has the most brilliant problem-solving mind in all of England. That is not ‘just’ a child. Second, you have an advantage in that, because you are
Anna felt her eyes sting with tears. “So, what is it, then?” she asked, suddenly angry. “Why are you telling me this? So I’ll be afraid? So I’ll have to constantly watch my back, waiting for him to come snatch me off the street?”
“No, Anna,” he reassured her. “Just… you should…” Sherlock grit his teeth. He knew he should make her apologize; it was just, he didn’t really believe in apologies, except in extreme circumstances—and this far from qualified.
her way out, there was no other way to describe it. Her movements were fast, precise, effective. She was wielding the scepter as a blunt weapon and thrusting out the small sword with her other hand. She was even using the cape, tangling it around the guards before stabbing or bludgeoning them.
Sherlock made a little noise that sounded suspiciously like a snort. “John, they’re simply frightening.”
John blinked, still unnerved by her plan. “There’s… there’s always a choice, Mary. For instance…” He thought quickly. “I could tell Moriarty what you’re plotting.”
John sighed from the chair, glancing past his newspaper. “She’s been here for an hour, Sherlock, cleaning. Haven’t you heard her?”
John told himself) enamored best friend. He tried to come up with what he’d say on the ride over, but everything he thought up sounded either insensitive or downright ridiculous.
“No,” Sherlock took the towel out and gasped from the counter. “No. Just do it. Just do it and ignore me, please.” He put the towel back and gripped the tap in his hands, anchoring himself to it.
Of all the times John thought he might have seen Sherlock naked, this particular scenario had never crossed his mind. If it had been any other time, John would have taken a moment to admire his body; as a doctor, John had seen many naked bodies, of all shapes and sizes, so he felt he was pretty qualified to judge Sherlock’s as one of the most beautiful he’d ever come across. Slender, but not skinny—his arse and thighs were firm and strong—skin cream-colored and smooth all the way down his graceful legs. His cock was a nice size, too (
Sherlock made a noise he’d never heard before, high pitched and needy. “I can’t,” he choked, and opened his eyes.
“And I did it,” said John, ignoring me. His hands were sliding down my chest. “Because you did. Because you do.” They slid down.
But suddenly there was nothing to push and kick any longer and John choked up on his grip on the rope and pulled himself out of the water. His head broke the surface and he cried out as warm air hit his lungs. He pulled himself up onto the thicker ice where Sherlock was lying, his feet still dangling in the water. John rolled him over and saw his face was too pale with ice and snow in his hair and blue lips and blue veins in his cheeks. “Sh-Sh-Sher—“ John tried, but he was shaking so badly that he couldn’t get the word out. “Up. Up!”
John jumped, remembering his manners. “Of course!” he said, stepping back to let them through. They entered the little foyer, unbuttoning their coats and unwrapping scarves, Anna taking off her cap, Sherlock fluffing his damp hair (he never had much cared for wearing a hat).
“Oh.” John looked down and released his grip. “Sorry.” He attempted to smooth out the wrinkles, but a few fruitless tries later and he dropped his hands to his lap instead.
For some reason, John sniggered. “And that’s the first thing that comes to mind? How short are we talking?”
John, meanwhile, walked all the way to the farthest corner of the kitchen and leaned against the countertop.
, thought Sherlock, quickly making a check of the surrounding rooms to be sure. For a family with a three year-old son, there was a suspicious lack of toys in the house. He knew, from visiting John over the past year, how toys accumulated in a house with children.
Mrs. Smith sniffed again. “She said she never really looked at him—didn’t want to catch his eye, encourage him, you know—but that he was very small and had a thick, dark beard.”
“Fuck,” he breathed, and he came, all over the sink, faucet, mirror, thinking about being tangled in John’s sheets, their bare skin touching in a thousand places.
He came close and started kissing me again, cradling my face in his hands. His fingers curled back behind my neck, the tips just barely tangled in my hair. He kissed with desperation, with his mouth open and sweet. He kissed like a soldier, gone away for months.
They sat in silence then, for a moment. Of all the times Sherlock had dreamed of seeing John again, of all the things he thought he’d say, the pleas, the threats, the tears—this scenario had not crossed his mind. None of those things he’d said in his head seemed appropriate, anymore. He wasn’t sure how to feel about this… wasn’t sure if he
John really doesn’t know how this happened. It had seemed innocent at first, incredibly innocent, it was supposed to be just a little, relaxing break from the baby and Mary. He was supposed to come over to help with some case or another, but somehow the topic got shifted all the way over to music, and all John could remember was that they’d had a couple drinks each and John had said something like, “Nah, you couldn’t possibly like rock and roll,” and Sherlock had said something like, “How would you know?” and John had retorted with “Well, because no one who’s got a stick that far up their arse could possible enjoy it.” Then Sherlock had looked quite affronted and mischievous at the same time, which was a very dangerous combination, and said something which sounded like a shot at John’s observation skills (John couldn’t exactly remember the wording) and John had said back, “Okay, Sherlock, prove me wrong then.”
“S-some support,” reeled Anna. Her voice shook with anger, an anger that she knew was covering up something deeper, something much more painful. “Looks like you changed your mind.”
“For a long while, yes. Breast cancer, apparently.” Mycroft tutted. “Such a terrible way to go, cancer. I’d much rather… I don’t know…
John opened his mouth to scold him again, but somehow a laugh escaped him instead. “Such a child,” he muttered.
He somehow managed to stand and half drag him all the way to shore. They were breathing heavily and Sherlock collapsed on the ground while John took off his own jumper. “Get undressed,” John commanded and at the same time started to do it for him as Sherlock was clearly incapable of doing it himself. He pulled off his coat and unbuckled his jeans and pulled them down and took of his jumper and vest. Sherlock was now half naked in the snow with his jeans bunched up on the tops of his boots around his ankles. John took a pocket knife out of his jacket where he kept it always and cut them away. Sherlock was breathing shallowly and he’d stopped shivering. That was a bad sign. “Come on,” John said and leaned down to put Sherlock’s arm around his shoulder. “I can’t carry you all the way, you’re going to have to help me.”
“I can’t believe you!” Anna shouted, her voice shaking. “How could you do that?! I’m so mortified!” She started to cry, while Sherlock just stared at her, bewildered at everything. “You’re so bloody
Sherlock didn’t know any of this of course. She’d kept it from him as best she could, for she was afraid that if he found out, he would somehow think he’d failed her. And the absolute worst thing in the world was disappointing him.
There was nothing else he could have been doing. His pants were around his ankles he was holding his erect cock in his hand, turned around with the unmistakable deer-in-the headlights look that John had seen in the movies when mothers caught their teenage boys looking at porn. They’d just stared at each other for a split second (felt like an eternity), and John had finally forced out a “What are you… doing?” right as he was putting the scene together in his head and knew
Sherlock felt his own cock begin to ache with desire, but felt something else, too—that same tingling heat that had started in his chest and spread throughout his whole body on the night he realized he loved John Watson. He felt the urge to coerce John into making ridiculous promises: “Promise we’ll never stop doing this,” “Promise you won’t leave me,” “Promise you’ll love me forever.” John was pumped full of enough endorphins right now that he just might actually make them, which would prove even more devastating later on when he’d break them.
It was then that she noticed Tchaikovsky playing in her ear. Anna couldn’t remember what piece, but she knew it was him. “
Sherlock’s eyes began to water as Carruthers pounded into him, over and over, unrelenting. He used every ounce of his willpower to keep from making any sound again, biting down so hard on his tongue that he tasted blood. “How does that feel, darling?” Carruthers cooed, his voice thick and rasped. He ran a hand up Sherlock’s back, under his shirt, and dug his fingernails into the flesh between his shoulder blades. Sherlock sucked in air, sharply, and Carruthers “
Molly rubbed her eyes. “Sherlock, we already knew that. We conducted those autopsies thoroughly… the girl died hours before the fishermen, and Mary—or whoever—
“Arms up,” John breathed, and Sherlock’s hands shot into the air. In one swift motion John lifted his shirt over his arms and tossed it onto the floor. Sherlock momentarily lamented wasting a clean shirt on five minutes of wear—but then he was distracted again by John’s mouth on his, hungrier than ever.
He kissed all over my face, my cheeks, my eyes, my chin. I rolled my hips forward, almost involuntarily. I was so hard it was painful, and the contact sent a thrill of pleasure all the way to the tips of my extremities.
Sherlock looked up, studying him for a moment. “As a matter of fact, yes,” he said, sitting back in his chair. “Apparently, Mycroft has traced his current whereabouts to an abandoned cosmetic testing facility, just outside the city. He’s ordered a raid for Monday evening.” Sherlock picked up a manila envelope that had been resting under the late biscuit plate and leafed through the contents before pulling out a photograph. “But Mycroft has informed me that he would like you and I to go in, first. Some top secret government conspiracy something-or-other.” Sherlock waved dismissively. “I told him I was not his errand boy, I would not cater to his every whim.”
Mycroft nodded. “I’m offering you the chance to help him. This is the first time we have ever had the opportunity to be one step ahead of Moriarty—with you as a spy, you could aid us in bringing him down from the inside.”
“Tell me it’s a trick. Tell me you know, you’ve known all along that this was going to happen. Tell me you lied to me about it, because you’ve got some grand, master plan in the works. Tell me you’re one step ahead of him.”
“She said she wouldn’t tell,” Sherlock blurted out. “She promised she wouldn’t tell you I was here.”
Sherlock stood up to wrap the coat around Anna. She smiled weakly at him as he bent over to help her arms through the sleeves and fold the front of it around her torso. As he pulled down her arms, he deliberately slid her hands into the pockets—and Anna felt the fingers of her right hand curl around something cold and hard.
Ella ignored his combative tone. “No,” she said, patiently, “I think grief can make us do funny things, and I think combining grief with the judgment-clouding effects of alcohol is a poor idea.”
Lestrade planted his feet and pushed his full weight forward, swinging the door open. Bright light hit his face, momentarily blinding him; he lifted an arm to shield it. And then, his eyes focused.
Finally finished with stomping up the steps, Anna slammed the door behind her (for good measure) and tried to go to The Void. She needed to disconnect from reality, for a few minutes, at least, because reality was so stupid that she didn’t want to live in it right now. She plugged in her headphones and turned on the music—but it wasn’t working, she wasn’t going anywhere, so she just laid there on her bed and cried instead. None of it was fair, not John, or Sherlock, or Mycroft, or her mother, or Sam, or Heidi, or David, or those guards at the museum. Moriarty was the least fair of them all, his laughing face full of bullets and blood.
He blinked himself awake, turning his head to try to loosen his stiff neck. He felt the crust of dried blood in his hair, from where the person behind him had struck. He looked around, groggily, attempting to get a grasp on his surroundings: concrete room, no windows, one door—
“Sherlock…” John murmured, now pressing himself even closer to the wall and peering with one eye out the door. “They’re coming.”
John choked out a laugh through his tears. “Christ,” he swore, wiping his face. “You’re an arsehole, you know that? Just an
He stepped through the door and collapsed on the couch. Maybe just a bit of sleep, just a little nap to recover some brain power. But he found that he couldn’t sleep, not while he was so concerned with finding Mary and Moriarty. If they got their hands on Anna… he would never forgive himself.
Suddenly, John placed his tongue and the base of Sherlock’s prick and gave it a firm lick all the way up to the very tip. Sherlock moaned before he could stop himself, and then he knew that John had won.
Sherlock laughed bitterly. “My brother has no sense of morality when it comes to catching enemies of his country. Knowing him, he’d use Anna as bait. No, Mycroft is the last person who should get involved in this.” He sighed. “But you’re right, Molly… Anna needs a place to go if something should happen to me. And I should be much obliged—no—honored, if that place would be with you.”
Well, John wasn’t about to give up at that point, because he was still pretty sure, like seventy five percent, that Sherlock was bluffing, so he stumbled down to Mrs. Hudson’s to get ahold of some of her herbal soothers. And when he returned Sherlock said, “Only if you do.” So they lit up and took a couple hits each, and then, to John’s shock and wonderment, Sherlock disappeared to his bedroom and reappeared with an electric guitar.
Anna chuckled again. “Goodbye, Sherlock. I’ll see you after school.” She grabbed her pack, then (with a groan) her project, and headed down the stairs. As she left, she heard Sherlock give Mrs. Hudson another “What?”
Despite knowing it would hurt, John was wholly unprepared for Sherlock’s reaction: his whole body spasmed and he moaned into the towel. “
“Ugh!” Anna grunted and threw her head emphatically against the back of the sofa. “Why do you always have to do this? Why can’t I just have friends without you having to analyze every one of them?”
“Mycroft made such fun of him,” said his father, with a bit of disappointment. “He could be a nasty brother, at times, couldn’t he, my dear?”
By the time the cow was back in her stall and watered and milked, the afternoon was already starting to wane as it did so quickly during winter in this part of the world. There were only a few hours of light left but John had finished most of his chores. He stopped by the chicken coop to gather the few eggs that had been laid since the day before and check on their heat lamps. These were still functioning and so the birds’ water was not frozen and they would stay warm tonight. John walked back up to the cabin and stomped the snow off his boots next to the stairs and took them off outside the door.
Mrs. Smith blinked at him, surprised, and then hopped up to pull him into a hug. “Oh, thank you, thank you, bless you!”
“That was it then,” he said, his voice oddly strained. “She must have decided to give it all up for a life with you.”
The shock of the cold was even worse than John remembered. But he forced himself to concentrate and he surfaced his head and drew in breath. Sherlock’s head hadn’t come up still so John took as deep a breath as he could and dove into the blackness. He opened his eyes under water and they screamed in pain. But he kept them open and by the dim light through the two holes in the ice he saw Sherlock still attempting to struggle, although he was moving slowly and was weighed down by his clothes. John swam underwater and underneath him and tried to push him up and back toward the shore.
The room itself was dark, had to be—their one-way mirrors weren’t the best quality. The interrogation room, however, was lit from the inside, a row of pink-tinged fluorescents illuminating the small metal table and two chairs, one of which had a disheveled-looking Mr. Carruthers handcuffed in it.
daughter, too, and Sherlock was probably just bringing her round for a “Merry Christmas” courtesy visit. He and Sherlock hadn’t worked out how it would go, them sharing her—but it was just like Sherlock to come up with a plan of his own and carry it out without including John.
John raced back up the path through the trees and into the barn to his work bench. However the length of rope was not there and the John remembered he’d used it to secure the last load of hay when he’d brought it in the truck. He ran out to the truck and looked in the bed, and then in the bench seat and behind the bench, but he still couldn’t find it. He cursed aloud and felt tears of frustration on his face. “Where are you?” he screamed and ran back to the barn to see what else he could use. He passed the cow’s stall and doubled back because he saw the long rope lead that he used to hook to the cow’s halter in the summertime when he moved her between pastures.
“Annalise, that is a paradox,” Sherlock informed her. “I cannot ‘basically’ and ‘exactly’ be doing something. And anyway, I’m not doing what you did,” he said. “I’m actually deducing things.”
“They’ve given us the ‘go.’” It was Lestrade, a fair distance away, probably so he’d have time to flee in case Sherlock decided to attack him again. “To go back in and… search.”
was the plan, and nowhere did it mention that Sherlock and John would be involved. The fact that they were here meant that everything had gone to hell, that Mary had (once again) lied, and they were all in very grave danger. “
, John thought, not only because it had been thirteen years instead of two, but because emotions were difficult for Sherlock in general. But he could come back to it. He would. There was nothing that could keep them apart. That was one thing John was sure of, had always been sure of, all those years while he waited in that prison cell to be sent home: that he wouldn’t lose Sherlock Holmes. The love they shared could cross time and space. It had crossed a hell of a lot up to that point already.
about who she was? Being married to you was clearly some scheme to get to the key. What would she have to gain by telling you about it, and thus ruining that scheme?”
Christ. All this time, and he still didn’t understand me. “Of course things are impossible. Many things are impossible. That’s how I can arrive at the right answer. I eliminate the impossible first. And what’s left is the truth.”
For a split second Anna thought she saw genuine surprise cross Moriarty’s expression. But it passed, and she wasn’t sure if she’d seen it at all. He lowered the scepter and walked over to her again. Anna felt more repulsed by him the closer he got. “Your… father,” he echoed, looking her up and down. “And who told you that?”
My mother sighed, and her eyes pitied me. “Then you’ll spend your whole life chasing an impossible dream.”
After a few minutes, Sherlock deemed most of the vomit washed away and began to strip off John’s wet clothes. John suddenly opened his eyes and looked up at him. “They’re dead,” he said, beginning to cry. “Why’re they dead, Sherlock? Why?”
It took her twenty minutes to get there, and when she opened the door to the flat, she found Sherlock pacing around the room. “Whoa, Sherlock, sit down. I’m sure she’s fine! Tell me what happened,” she said, putting her hand out to stop his movement.
. Then he concentrated with immense effort and managed shift his weight—didn’t move any particularly distinguished muscle, just completed a weight shift.
“After that, Sherlock decided he couldn’t go back to solving crimes. But he did need something to do, and he was tired of relying on Mycroft for all his spending money, so he went out and looked for a job. Can you imagine, Sherlock applying for jobs? The interviews?” Mrs. Hudson chuckled. “He was rubbish at it, of course. But one night Molly Hooper had us over for dinner, and he was complaining about his latest disastrous interview, and Molly said to him, ‘You should come to the morgue tomorrow morning—I’ll get you a job, no problem.’ So that’s what he did. He went down to St. Bart’s and Molly trained him to help with the autopsies. It’s a bit boring for him, I’m afraid, but he hardly ever complains. He stopped going to crime scenes, stopped putting himself in all that danger… I suppose he thought it was all worth it for little Anna.”
Sherlock grabbed her face with both hands and backed her up against the edge of an empty autopsy table, pressing his hips into hers. “Molly,” he growled, his voice thick, “do shut up.” And then he drove his tongue into her mouth, and felt her body go limp around his kiss.
Sherlock averted his eyes. “Well, there I can’t help you. I didn’t have much of a ‘normal’ teenage experience, either.”
, he said to himself. He left the bathroom and climbed back into bed, pulling the covers up to his chin and falling asleep once more.
But Molly couldn’t tell him. She just couldn’t. Because if there was a chance that Anna could do what she said she could, to finish Moriarty once-and-for-all, then Molly had to help her. “Oh, nothing. It’s just that things are so different among young people these days...  seems like none of them are normal teenagers anymore.”
The lights were out in her flat, so Sherlock suggested they visit her tomorrow. Anyway, judging by her reaction when
John couldn’t help but laugh at that. It was just like Sherlock not to consider his own feelings until prompted by someone else. “Ok, then,” John amended. “The… the wanking part. How long has that been going on?”
John pulls down Sherlock’s trousers and pants and puts his mouth around Sherlock’s erection without a second thought. More sounds come out, more lovely sounds, and John thinks he’ll do anything to hear those sounds forever, even if that anything amounts to him sucking on the other man’s cock. After a few moments, not long at all, Sherlock suddenly grasps the back of John’s head with his strong, spindly fingers and pulls it off his prick, then sits up and literally falls into him on the wall again. Sherlock’s pants are around his ankles and his shirt is flapping open and he’s grinding his bare crotch into a wet spot against the front of John’s trousers. “John, John, please.” There it is, another beg, and John’s hands fly up to pull the detective into him by the waist. “What do you want,” John murmurs, except it comes out like a growl, and he’s startled because it doesn’t even sound like his own voice.
“No,” Sherlock said, defiantly. If John was really going to do this, he wasn’t about to make it more comfortable for him.
“Okay,” John echoed, letting go of his hands to reach into his bag and extract a pair of gloves. “Show me where it hurts.”
“Actually,” Carruthers shifted in his seat, “she hadn’t met Max yet. We never bring him to the interviews, you see—we’re very careful because he gets attached very quickly.” He smiled again. “He’s the most loving, trusting child you’ve ever met. I’m sure he and Violet would have got on splendidly.”
They got out of the cab, Sherlock paid the driver, and in thirty seconds they were inside the building, Sherlock’s keys jangling back into his pocket. “I can’t believe they finally gave you a key,” John said. “How the hell did you convince them?”
, she thought. But the butterflies were stifled when she heard the tone of Sherlock’s voice on the other end.
Sherlock continued to puff on his cigarette, staring off the balcony at the city below. He wondered if he should have just stayed home, like he’d done for Christmas (alone, playing violin and eating through two whole tins of Mrs. Hudson’s homemade Christmas sweets). He’d had to make small talk with off-duty police for the last two hours, and he
Sherlock looked stunned for a moment, then turned, wide-eyed, to Mrs. Hudson. The landlady sighed. “Oh Sherlock, the poor child doesn’t understand. She doesn’t love him like you did, dear. She doesn’t even remember him.”
John felt the room spin for a moment. His face grew cold, and then blisteringly hot. Violet was raped. Of course she was.
“Quite exciting," Sherlock answered, dryly. “She received a new rocking horse and promptly spent the rest of the morning playing in the box. Honestly, why do we even bother buying gifts for children?”
Mary had been quite serious about John not coming home, and so Sherlock had got his wish—for him to move back to Baker Street. But it wasn’t anything like the fantasy Sherlock had dreamed of; John had been absolutely intolerable, driven to near lunacy at the guilt he felt for leaving Lestrade at the Yard that day. At first John had taken to drinking the anguish away, and then, when Sherlock finally outlawed it, he’d taken to crying.
Sherlock remembered how Anna had turned and hid her face in his shoulder. The memory of the gesture still warmed his heart, all these years later—any uneasiness he’d felt about his choice to raise Annalise had vanished the moment she looked to him for protection. She trusted him to keep her safe, and he would.
seen it, he would have figured out how to open it in an instant. “There’s a bit of lore to it, which is entirely uninteresting, I can assure you. The point is that the British could never open it, and so were never able to make use of the wealth. Some believe that the treasure could have financed their rule in India, boosted the economy, provided food during famine—essentially prevented the revolts and stopped them from losing the country altogether. It was
Sherlock looked at him, no trace of humor in his expression. “She’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”
I weighed my options. I could tell him the truth, that I “wasn’t in the mood,” and watch his fragile confidence crumble behind his polite and stolid mask. Or, alternatively, I could put up with it for a short time and then he would be happy and satisfied leave me alone for another few days.
“Of course, you had every right to be suspicious,” Sherlock said, ignoring Anna. “But I can assure you that you will have the key in hand very soon.”
“They will,” I muttered. “They’ll have him before we even get back to Baker Street. Just you watch.”
Anna sat cross-legged on the frozen ground, in front of the stone. “Do you think they’ll take it away?” she asked, after a moment.
I blinked, trying to retrieve the memory—it was much more difficult than it should have been. “At Bart’s?” I asked, finally. “The day we met?” Impossible. It couldn’t have been then, that was before I even knew him, or felt anything that would have impeded my objective observation. I would have seen right away if he was interested in me.
“Nonsense. Of course we will train you on the technical aspects, but, my darling, you have a natural gift for deceit. To put it most indelicately, it’s in your blood. We can help you to access it, by letting you… ‘off your leash,’ so to speak, in a way that Sherlock always refused to do.”
It was a quick ride to St. Bart’s, though that could have very well been because John’s brain was buzzing violently with all that he’d discovered at Baker Street: Sherlock had raised Anna as his own. Sherlock was still in love with him. Sherlock was on his way to deducing something that would save them all. Now, if only John could help him, the way he used to.
John felt very strange again. He suddenly couldn’t breathe and had to get out of the cabin. He really didn’t care if Sherlock was here and drinking tea and that he smiled at him in the morning with the cool winter light coming in through the window. He didn’t care about it but it bothered him because he lived here for a reason, and because of what Sherlock had promised him. John hadn’t expected him to keep that promise but he had done for four years and so John had relaxed into his new life. And now he felt himself unraveling even though he didn’t care about any of it.
The door between the observation and interrogation rooms slammed closed, and Lestrade blinked in surprise as he watched John grab the empty metal chair and swing it over to jam it underneath the handle.
“Oh? It’s not?” Mycroft’s lips stretched so thin that he adopted a frightening, alien-like countenance—which is how he always looked when he smiled.
The guard on his knees tried his radio to call for help, but of course it wasn’t working. He turned to the other guard. “Call maintenance, tell them we need a… screwdriver. Or something.”
Mycroft walked round the side of the bench and sat next to his brother. “Have you a theory on why John was kept alive?”
It was dark inside the other house, and much quieter, although there were still several people scuttling about. All of the shades were drawn, all of the lights off. “This way,” Lestrade called, and John followed him around the corner and down a long hallway. There was a group of police at the end, and a familiar female face—
“No,” said Mycroft, sternly. “She’s not your daughter, Sherlock, as you are so fond of telling people. You may have raised her, but she is and will always be the child of Jim Moriarty. And she is the only one who can help us destroy him.”
Sherlock released her and stepped back. “Do you realize what you’ve done?” he asked, in quiet terror.
“Shite,” John said, because in all their haste, they'd forgotten to tell her he was alive. The landlady was more stooped than she had been, and her hair was no longer colored, but grey, and shorter than he remembered. She had been old before, but now… and with that look on her face, absolutely petrified with shock… “Shite, Mrs. Hudson, I’m so sorry.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and closed his eyes, trying to relax his body. It was going to take a bit more work, this. He wondered if he should think about something. About his dream… a stab of excitement hit his belly, just thinking about
I’d had just enough social etiquette to ask her to ice cream before propositioning her. I’d read that chocolate was an aphrodisiac so I’d ordered it for her and watched her eat it, every last bit. And as soon as she was done, I’d asked her whether she cared to become intimate in the backseat of my mother’s car.
John didn’t stir at all as Sherlock set down the glass. But when he took a step back, about to turn away, John made a small sound, a little whine. Sherlock froze, but John stayed still and silent.
Sherlock hung his coat and scarf on the hook as John came up the stairs behind him. He smoothed the sides of the coat out and down, absentmindedly, not wanting to turn around and face his best friend, who was currently standing right behind him and waiting to destroy his heart.
He gently lowered himself into the rocking chair and rocked his little girl in her slumber, his face buried in her hair, until the scent faded away.
Sherlock’s eyes popped open, ridden with fear and anguish. “John—“ he gasped, bringing a hand up to clutch John’s t-shirt. “John—“
“But you loved him,” John insisted. “Wasn’t it absolute agony, not being able to be with him? How did you stand it?”
things myself!) until he reached in to wash it off for me. It was a spot on my wrist, just below my palm, and he grasped my hand and turned it over and thumbed the spot under the running water. My hand tingled where he touched it.
“No. This is non-negotiable. He can’t… I can’t have him believing that I’m dead, for two years. I just… I know what that’s like, Mary. You know I know what that’s like, how awful it was for
The Detective Inspector held his mouth in a tight, thin line, and inclined his head. “Sergeant,” he greeted, in return.
“Sherlock! John.” It was Lestrade, striding towards us from across the room. “Find anything yet? I was just speaking with the supervisor upstairs, he said the security system didn’t recognize any unauthorized entry last night.”
The wait for Mycroft’s extraction team was nearly unbearable. Sherlock just kept staring at John, and John at Sherlock, in excruciating silence, in which no viable theories on why John was alive came to Sherlock’s mind. And he had a thousand questions, he knew, but none of them were surfacing.
“Oh, goodness no, Sherlock doesn’t solve crimes anymore,” replied Mrs. Hudson, drying her hands on a dish towel. “Not like he used to, anyway.”
the row must have been, imagining Mary asking for a divorce, imagining John coming back to 221B, a suitcase in tow—
John suddenly felt very tired. He stood and shuffled up the stairs, making it back to his room and collapsing on top of the mattress, pulling the quilt over his head. He turned his face into his pillow and began to sob.
, Sherlock nearly retorted, but stopped himself, because that didn’t make sense. John was standing in front of him, clearly
And kissing him, and liking it. That had never happened before. What I had been trying to tell him, so ineloquently, was that I thought I might need to be in love to enjoy physical intimacy. The two, for me, seemed to be inextricably linked; I couldn’t take pleasure in the second without having the first. But as John was clearly not wired that way, so he would have a difficult time understanding.
Sherlock laughed. It was a rarity, to make him laugh, and John let the sound wash over him. “You sound like me,” Sherlock told him, still chuckling as he sat up to fill his glass again.
He looked at his watch—fifteen minutes until midnight, forty-four hours and fifteen minutes until John was home and back in his bed. He stuck the cigarette back in his mouth and sucked down the smoke.
upset about the recent turn of events. Sure, he didn’t approve of John’s drinking himself to death’s door every night, but John would eventually move on from that stage of grief—he didn’t
I didn’t know how to explain it. I thought perhaps that the best thing to do would be to start at the beginning. “I started having these dreams, you see—“
Three pairs of eyes stared at him. “Well, it’s…” Sherlock was taken by surprise—he didn’t know John had told her they were working on a case. They should have discussed it ahead of time, come up with a story. “It’s a secret,” he finished, tentatively. “Top… secret.”
Major Sholto was standing outside the glass, his hat in his hands, shoulders stiffly at attention—the way they always were, in that uniform. Sherlock saw a flash of his face through the throng of people that had crowded into the little hospital room to see the new baby.
So when we actually made it out of that flooding room alive, and got back to London, and John followed close behind me up the stairs of 221B and shoved me against the door to kiss me again, I didn’t understand why I was repulsed. Why his slimy tongue in my mouth, pushing his four-hour old coffee breath and the taste of his unflossed teeth between my lips, made me want to gag instead of suck it down the way I might have (and did) when I thought we were about to die. Why I was back to my old self, instead of the new one.
“Eh-eh-eh!” Mary cut him off before he could start. “You want to stay here? Then the experiments have to go.”
“Cruel woman, indeed,” muttered Anna. Sherlock leapt past her to the safety of Mrs. Hudson’s presence.
The room was even more silent than before. “Let’s speak with the supervisor again,” Anderson finally said, to his boss. “Ask him which of his employees have the most organized workspaces. That should give us a good start.”
what Sherlock was doing. And Sherlock had gaped, his lips smacking together like a dying fish, no explanation or sound or anything leaving his mouth. And then John had looked down on the bed.
“I don’t—“ John was clearly overwhelmed. “Look, Sherlock, it’s pouring out, and I—let’s go inside before we get drenched.”
I braced my free arm on the table below and rutted against him, experimentally. A spark of electric desire jolted through my groin and into my stomach, and I shuddered and rutted again. John made a strangled noise in front of me. There wasn’t really a rhythm to what we were doing, but it was more than enough, with John’s cock sliding next to mine, with the sounds he made and the way he gripped my hips so hard that I had bruises the next day. The way he said my name, “Sherlock,” interspersed with “God,” and “Jesus Christ,” like they were synonymous.
He visibly relaxed, and ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t know how you can blame me. You call everyone an idiot, whether you’re in love with them or not.” He smiled a little.
“Sherlock is fond of speaking about the motivational power of love, but what most people don’t realize is that love and hate are very closely related. There is no one my brother loves more than Annalise Watson, and there is no one he hates more than Jim Moriarty. I knew that to connect the two of them would be an advantage in some way, some day. So I lied to him. I told him that the results confirmed that Anna was Moriarty’s child. And I found a chance to use that lie, to use Anna to bring Sherlock and Moriarty together, so that Moriarty may be destroyed, once and for all.”
The girl was shot in the same place that Mary had shot Sherlock; it was a message, and one specifically for him. To frighten him. And it had certainly done that, had made him decide to go after them—
“Yes, Anna,” Mycroft said, firmly. “But it really doesn’t matter, because we cannot wait any longer to put you in the field.” He considered her. “Do
But in the real world, there are strings. There are loads of them. In the real world there are uncomfortable backseats to cars, or hard shelving of broom cupboards digging into your spine; there is cold air, sweaty skin that sticks to itself and to others’ and makes the most unappealing noises; there is bad breath, there are teeth, there are… distractions. Too many distractions. It’s not a controlled environment, it’s not predictable, it’s not,
shorter, though there was still a suggestion of curl at the ends. Sherlock ran a hand back and forth through it a few times to get it unstuck from his head.
If I was obsessive about things before, it was nothing compared to now. By the time he arrived I would be in complete agony, so keyed up that all I needed was for him to brush up against me, for one or two quick strokes of his hand down my pants. I couldn’t sleep (and believe me, I wanted to, after all the physical activity). I wasn’t hungry (John had already had to use sex as a bargaining chip for me to eat a proper meal). Nothing else in the world mattered, nothing at all. It was terrible and wonderful all at once.
“Well of course he wouldn’t,” replied Molly, her hands fiddling with her coffee cup, “because it’s a crap idea.”
Satisfied, Mycroft reached into his other jacket pocket and pulled out a photograph. It was an old mug shot of a dark haired man in a cream-colored jacket, his large, brown eyes glaring menacingly into the camera as he smirked above the placard that showed his name and the date he was arrested.
“Oh for the love of—what do you think, Mary? You think I’m going to hurt Anna? Or you? What the fuck is the
he was to another person; he hadn’t had any sort of closeness in several months. When John had died, there was Anna to temper the isolation, and she’d done it well—in some ways, it had almost been like having John in the flat again, except better, because there was no threat of her leaving if Sherlock made a mess of things. She accepted him, totally and completely, because that was all she’d ever known. She’d always forgive his transgressions. She was his family.
Mary growled and twisted her arm to turn the gun on John, instead. She glared into Sherlock’s eyes. “Do you have the key, or not?”
Mycroft swallowed and tried to calm himself—but that didn’t quite work, because Mary’s bullets began to hit their craft. All of them ducked down at the sound of the artillery, all except for the driver, who was promptly shot through the eye. The boat slowed abruptly and the other three pitched forward. “Oh, for God’s sake,” groaned Mycroft, grabbing the dead driver by the collar and hauling him out of the seat. He slid down in his place and the boat was off again, in hot pursuit.
He’d definitely thought of them, of Mary, he had to have, and he was still kissing me. He was still in my room, with the door locked, kissing me and running his hands down my body. He wanted me more than her. He wanted me, he had since the beginning. He’d do anything for me. Still. He was still mine.
Sherlock’s didn’t reply, now extracting bits of dirt from underneath the fingernails of the next body. He scraped them into the second dish that Molly had laid out for him. “I don’t deserve you,” he murmured, eventually.
He heard then a quiet knock and put down the cup to open the door. John appeared from behind it and gave Lestrade a slight nod as he entered, gun in hand. Lestrade nodded back and peered out the door and into the deserted hallway before he closed it again, locking it from the inside. He turned back around to—
The good thing about it was, that unlike the dog, Sherlock weighed more than John and so had broken through the ice at a thicker point than John would have done. John took it carefully across the pond and when he got close he lay down on the ice to spread out his weight. “Grab my hand,” he said and reached out as he shimmied forward.
“Tell me that you knew about Mary, even. The whole time. I wouldn’t care, Sherlock, if it was all for a plan, if you could get us out of this bloody mess.”
“Then I suppose I’ll find a way to do so,” she said, defeated. “But he’d better not fuck things up.”
“Sherlock,” said John and his voice was pleading. “Sherlock I can’t carry you and we have to get to the house. We have to go. Please.” He tried lifting him again and Sherlock managed to stand on his feet. He leaned into John as they shuffled along the path, through the forest, and back up to the cabin.
He’d only allowed himself to cry that first day. And cry he did, in every way he remembered from his childhood; and then, when the day was over, he stopped.
Sherlock turned around. “I know, John,” he said, quietly. “He… Carruthers…” Sherlock’s body began to tremble, again. “He did it twice. The second time was with the screwdriver, four hours later, after they’d beaten me.”
“When he first decided to raise Annalise, there was a lot for him to learn. He went out and bought all kinds of books, so when I wasn’t teaching him practical things like how to change a nappy,” she laughed a little to herself at the memory, “or mash up Anna’s carrots just right, he was reading. Trust Sherlock to think he could learn everything about being a parent from a book. I mean, books are ever so helpful, of course, but Sherlock treated them as his own personal canon law. He’d quote from them incessantly, it was incredibly annoying.”
By the time she was eight, Anna had begun to lie. It was easier, to lie. Some child would make a comment and, instead of simply denying it, she’d retort with a false truth. The other children would be confused. And upset. They’d go to their parents with this other truth. “No,” their parents would say. “Anna is a liar. Don’t play with her.”
“Your flatulence has the same odor, as well,” murmured a moody voice from the bed, and both Anna and John started. “If you’re searching for others.”
John’s lips twisted. “You know, now that I think about it, you probably want it that way. You want her to hate you, because you think it will drive a wedge between me and her.” Sherlock glanced up sharply, but didn’t deny it. John felt a burst of satisfaction at being right. “When did that start, Sherlock? You used to
Thirty minutes earlier, John had burst through the door of 221B, eyes wild and chest heaving beneath a heavy spatter of blood. Sherlock and Mary and the baby on her hip had turned away from the telly to take in the sight, still in shock from the news report that had just popped up: “
“I haven’t done anything dangerous, you know,” Sherlock told him, annoyed. “I was only inspecting the coffee shop. Crowded, public place. Well-lit. Safe. Just like I promised.” There was an edge to Sherlock’s voice, one he put there on purpose. He didn’t want John to know just how easy it had been for him to agree to that promise, or how relieved he’d felt when John asked him to make it.
John turned around, peering at Sherlock through the dim light of their flat. “Fuck you,” he said, not really with any malice; more as a matter of fact. He turned back and climbed the stairs to his room.
John wasn’t sure if he’d made sense; not only was he inebriated, but he was rubbish at this stuff, and Sherlock usually took no interest in it, anyway. He shook his head. “I’m sorry, this—I’m past all this, I really am.” He pushed it away in the air. “It’s just this week, you being here… it’s got me remembering.”
“Honestly, John,” Sherlock tried again, “I don’t know… I’m not sure what came over me. You didn’t deserve that.”
Sherlock’s eyes lingered on John’s for a moment. “Probably the exact language she would use,” he murmured. He shifted his gaze back to the storm. “But beyond that, she likes music—although she could have a better appreciation for classical—and prefers playing fiddle over violin.”
Eventually Sherlock calmed down enough to open his eyes. He stared at the ceiling breathing hard. The afternoon was gone now and the fire cast a faint orange glow behind the outline of Sherlock’s chest moving up and down. Sherlock turned his head to look at John and John looked back at him.
John smirked, glancing over for Sherlock’s reaction. He was staring straight ahead, his jaw clenched, not saying a word.
But John was not stupid enough to jump in after it, so instead he ran to the tractor that he’d parked along the other side of the pond where he’d attempted to cut out the river trail before the snows had set in unexpectedly. He ran to it and brushed aside the snow and found the buckets of tools he kept on the back and in one of these was an orange extension cord. He pulled out the cord and ran back to the pond’s edge where he could hear the dog still struggling. He tied the cord around a stump at the edge of the ice, then he tied the other end tightly around his waist because he knew that if he fell into the water it would be easy to lose the cord. He called to the dog that he was coming and then stepped out onto the pond.
“Oh, do shut up,” Anna cut him off. “Quit being such a know-it-all.” She stalked off to the kitchen to check on the kettle.
John picked up several stones and put them in his palm. He curled his hand into a fist like he was a superhero who could crush them in his bare grip. He sniffed once, and then let the rocks fall out. I could see the little red and purple imprints they’d left on his skin. “I never wanted to ruin you.”
John giggles around my cock, and I wonder (not for the first time) if he knows what I’m thinking. He pulls his head up. “What the passersby must think,” he says, pretending to be scandalized.
Sherlock sat with his fingers steepled under his chin and his eyes barely open. He did not usually deal with kidnappings. Parents with missing children normally went directly to the police first—and either the child would be with a relative, turn out to be a runaway, or come home in a body bag. There was normally never much of a mystery involved, and there was no usual happy alternative when the first two outcomes were not plausible. And the police knew better than he how to handle the third.
John’s eyes grew very wide. “I figured you’d given it back to him. I bet that’s what Mary and Moriarty thought, too, when they realized I’d snuck it into your pocket... I suppose we all underestimated how much you hate your brother.” He grinned, lopsidedly. “You still have it, then?”
Sherlock tore from the bedroom, skidded out into the sitting room where John was standing. He looked like hell; dark circles under his eyes, pale skin, hair all mussed up in the back.
I gave him what I hoped was a highly-disgusted stare. “Do I strike you as the type of person who would pine?”
“Not that you have been,” Mrs. Holmes said quickly. “But maybe you should encourage him, as good friends do, to move on. Not in those words—tactfully, of course—but he can’t keep pining for you, John.”
Hands were on him, restraining. “Sherlock! Sherlock, look at me.” His eyes left Lestrade as the hands turned him around and Mycroft’s face swam into view.
.” She wrinkled her nose, as if it was the bane of her existence that they were so. “But the other part was the silly story that I’d come up with to make sense of why Mum cried. I thought that she was in love with you,” Anna explained, “and that, for whatever reason, she’d married my dad instead. From there it was an easy jump to thinking that you might actually be my real father. Especially easy because of Dad, because of how he was.”
. The little street was packed with police cars, ambulances, news crews, the like. John grabbed his bag and flung open the door, not bothering to shut it as he rushed toward the scene.
And that was that. Sherlock remembered feeling deflated at that moment, rather like a balloon, all the air in his lungs that he didn’t know he’d been holding onto had rushed out of him all at once. He remembered how heavy Anna had felt in his arms, then. He remembered that she’d stopped crying, and he’d tipped her back to feed her. She hadn’t complained. The formula was the perfect temperature.
Sherlock was silent for a long while, staring at John’s face. “Alright,” he said finally. “I need to go out for a bit.”
John glared at him through his fingers. “You could have helped me out, you know. Given me a tip or two before she left, so I wouldn’t look like such an insensitive prick.”
Molly’s mouth had fallen open, disbelieving Mycroft’s massive capacity for deception. “But… your own brother. Didn’t you care at all about his feelings? About what would happen to
Sherlock blinked, in shock. Was it really them? How were they here? They must have come home early… but why were they
“Now, now, let’s not all start bickering again,” Mary reprimanded, adjusting the baby in her arms. She’d fallen asleep halfway through her meal. “Just tell me, are you anywhere near close to solving it? It’s just been taking up so much of John’s time… We miss him around here.” She didn’t quite meet Sherlock’s eyes.
Alright, so, yes, perhaps it wasn’t the most scintillating thing I could have said. But it didn’t seem as if he was going to pull me back towards him quite yet (if ever) (probably never) (did that disappoint me?) (what on
“I’m so sorry,” she said again, and Sherlock sighed, pulling her to him. She sobbed and clung to his shirt.
Molly must have noticed his expression, because her shy smile quickly faded at the look on his face. Then John, slow with his limp, stepped up the last step and out from behind. “Oh!” she shrieked, flipping the tray in the air and sending chocolate all over the entryway. She put it in front of her waist to cover her bottom half. And then she recognized who was standing beside Sherlock, and dropped it, her mouth wide open.
researching how to smuggle an entire flock of bats into Mycroft’s flat, and not once did you try anything with me!”
Mary tutted and rolled her eyes, then caught sight of John coming down the hall. “John, show him Airplane, for the love of God.” She turned back to the washing.
“Sherlock, listen.” Molly took a deep breath and set down the dish. “I never expected to compete with John Watson. I’d never want to; I wouldn’t stand a chance. He’s your…” she sought the right way to say it, “…
Mycroft gave him a wry smile. “It’s a rather enjoyable way of life. I don’t regret the additional weight one bit.” He patted it. “Keeps me quite warm in the winter.”
you’re that person I always talked to, but now that you’re really here, it doesn’t feel the same. It’s like there’s the real you, and then there’s my Dad.”
.” He almost did, because sod duty, sod responsibility. If he wanted to live his life as a confirmed bachelor with his sociopathic best friend (who, was, at the moment, completely reversing that diagnosis), why couldn’t he well do it?
“Oh Mrs. Hudson, do calm down. I’ve got her, she’s quite warm enough in my arms.” Sherlock smiled and opened his eyes wide as Anna attempted to feed him the snow flake that had landed on her fist. He stretched his lips over his teeth and slurped the snowflake off her hand, and her eyes brightened as she smiled. She reached out to grab another flake, and as soon as one landed on her (the wrist, this time) she thrust it out toward Sherlock’s mouth. He slurped again, making a silly, surprised face. “That’s cold!” he exclaimed. Anna giggled.
“I’ll need a scalpel,” Sherlock announced, putting out his hand without looking up. Molly sighed and handed him one, and watched him make a few incisions in silence. “Do what?” he inquired, suddenly.
Sherlock continued to stare in silence, not sure how to respond. It was a thing he’d dreamed of hearing John say, for the longest time, but there was something flat about it, now. It had hit Sherlock’s ears and had passed through with nothing even
Sherlock searched Major Sholto’s face, his eyebrows drawn over his eyes in puzzlement. “Tell him… what?”
Sherlock’s stare became hard and cold. “No,” he said, and Mary blinked at him in confusion. “If you’d loved them, you would have given up
Mary swallowed and her eyes grew very wide. She reached out and delicately took the key from his palm.
“Alright, then,” he agreed, trying not to smile. “I’ll buy you a chocolate bar, but only if you promise to go back inside and do as she says for the rest of the day.”
“Anna,” Mary called over the sound of the straining engine. “Anna, please, listen to me.” Anna looked around the boat, ignoring Mary’s voice.
. He probably had access to the vault, and probably had a key-card somewhere on his person. He most certainly had a thumb for the thumbprint. “So obvious!” said Anna out loud, shaking her head at herself.
Sherlock walked through the snow and with his long legs he could cover more distance than John. John began to walk faster. The snow was up to his shins so he had to step high. He yelled as loud as he could and started to run, stepping higher and kicking up snow behind him. Sherlock didn’t turn around. John tried whistling, a piercing sound that cut through the wind and snow and that he had not used since with the dog. Still Sherlock did not turn. Instead he rounded the corner of the road and disappeared behind the trees.
“Yes, honestly,” Anna echoed, setting the tea down on the coffee table. “You’d make a terrible spy, Molly.”
“I don’t think it was a matter of if he could,” said Molly. “I think it was more of he had to; there was no one else to do it. And since she was
In the distraction of the fall, one of the attacker’s arms came off of Anna. She didn’t waste any time; with her now free arm, she reached over and grabbed the nearest thing she could: one of the splintered table legs. Without thinking and without mercy, she flipped the sharp end inward and drove it into the attacker’s side.
Because of the nature of John’s death and the length of time it took the forensics team to investigate, it was almost three weeks before John was officially “pronounced” dead. Sherlock remembered when Mycroft rang to tell him: he was holding Anna in the kitchen, she was crying, he was testing the heated formula on his wrist the way Mrs. Hudson had showed him, still unsure what was too hot and what was too cold—“It has to be body-temperature Sherlock, just imagine it came right out of a woman’s breast!” “I’d rather not, Mrs. Hudson.”—and had somehow found and extra hand to pick up the phone.
As the Detective Inspector had driven away from his house, grumbling to himself and rubbing his tired eyes, he’d begun to think a little more about the situation. The fact that Sherlock’s first instinct was to investigate the Carruthers started to bring to mind the oddities that Lestrade had noticed when they’d initially interviewed the family. Like, for example, how Violet was supposed to nanny for them, yet their son was nowhere to be seen. “Visiting his grandparents,” they’d said, and Lestrade had bought it—the first time. The second time he’d come to ask questions, the son still wasn’t there—and neither was
The landlady snapped her jaw closed and muttered some highly disturbing insults under her breath as she stomped out of the flat and slammed the door shut.
John opened one eye and looked at me. “I don’t blame you. My digestive noises are hot.” He was grinning.
“Yes.” I uncapped the lube and squirted some onto my fingers. It was a little cold, but it heated quickly on my hand. I moved down between his legs, which were spread wide on the bed with his knees upright.
Sherlock heard the door close a moment later as Molly left the room. He sighed and whipped the covers up over his head.
“What about your son?” Sherlock continued, watching him carefully. “Did the two of them seem to have a connection?”
“No,” she interrupted. Two fat tears spill over her bottom eyelids, and she wiped them off gently, turning out to face the skyline. “No, Sherlock, I don’t want your pity. I never have. You reach this point where you sort of just accept that your feelings won’t be returned, but it doesn’t matter; you’re going to keep feeling them anyway. You come to a sort of peace with it, knowing that you will love this person forever even though they can never love you back. You accept that you’ll do anything for them, be anything they want you to be, because you no longer have control over yourself or what happens to you. You’re totally consumed by love.” Molly sighed through her tears, and turned back to him. “I will do anything for you, Sherlock. Of course I will take care of Anna if something happens to you. Of course I will keep your secrets. I’d much rather be your… your
“He challenged me,” I began. “Not because he was smarter than me—please—but because he never let me get away with anything.”
Mary nodded. “I couldn’t help myself, I told him just to let it go. To forget about what they had said.” She looked down at the table in front of her. “Part of me still really wanted to be a family. I thought for a time that I could… that I was over the obsession to recover the treasure. That I could move on from my need for revenge. That I could live with John and Anna and be happy… but when I heard the key was out there, again, I just couldn’t. I was a slave to it.”
Sherlock’s eyes turned back to the table, a smile of satisfaction playing on his lips. Then, he frowned. “You should probably call Mary to bring the car over."
Finally, Sherlock’s arms had tired and he’d brought Anna down to his lap, where she promptly fell asleep with her mouth wide open, snoring like an old man. John had laughed at Sherlock’s incredulity. “I suppose it’s bedtime,” he’d said, and carefully picked up his daughter to take her to her room.
I couldn’t hold on anymore. I was going to come, and then John reached down to tug at himself, and I couldn’t, I just couldn’t comprehend how good it was, and I was coming, and coming, shouting things, I don’t even know what.
The women froze abruptly, Molly letting out a little yelp of surprise. “Into the alley,” said the man, his gaunt eyes glaring at them from beneath his hood. He used the knife to motion to their right, where there was a small alleyway.
, the water couldn’t heat up fast enough. He threw off his clothes in a frenzy and scanned the counter, spotting a bottle of lotion. He took two pumps of the cream and spread it over his hard-on. He was embarrassed at himself, but no one needed to know that this was happening, that he was about to get off for the second time in six hours, and that he couldn’t even wait for the shower to be warm before he did it.
And now she’d done it, she’d found the jewels. She walked up to them, touching them with immense satisfaction—and then her spirits plummeted as she realized just how large they were. The cape was so incredibly bulky that there was no way it was going to fit in her backpack and back through the vents. But she realized that she wouldn’t be able to take the vents out, anyway—one of the security guards who had seen her in there was still alive, and once he came back to find the dead guard and the crown jewels missing, he’d know exactly where she went. She wouldn’t have an hour to crawl through the ducts and back to the building’s entrance—she wouldn’t have five minutes. Anna picked up the cape off its hanger and studied it; she was going to have to wear it, and walk out the front door.
Of course, that was an insane and completely unrealistic fantasy. Even if John were still alive, Sherlock highly doubted that he would have helped him to raise Anna. Perhaps he’d babysit now and then, but he’d probably just pass her onto Mrs. Hudson and go back to whatever dangerous case he’d been in the middle of in his own little Sherlockian world. Funny how much things had changed in just a few short months.
John swallowed, staring up into Sherlock’s face, which was flushed in anger. It was frightening and satisfying at the same time. He could have ended the row there, could have apologized and everything would have gone back to normal. But he didn’t want to. Something about his mood, whether it was his hangover or his grief or the fact that he hardly ever got to see this emotional side of Sherlock, was making him feel combative. So he pushed further.
John snorted at that, glancing sideways at him. “What a load of rubbish, it’s got to be driving you up the wall.”
Mrs. Hudson had rolled her eyes. “Oh that doesn’t matter. You’ve got a fascinating job—you work with dead bodies! The children will be hanging onto your every word, and they won’t care if you’re her parent or not.”
I sighed. “Of course I’m attracted to you,” I repeated. I was. Or I had been. That one time. It wasn’t a lie, exactly. “I’m just...” I sought for the right words to pacify him. I knew I couldn’t avoid the topic forever, but maybe just a bit longer... “Afraid,” I finished.
to call me? I’m fine with whatever,” he went on, hoping to set her at ease—though he didn’t know how he’d feel about her calling him anything but “Dad.”
“Yes,” I told him, not because I knew what he meant but because I didn’t want him to stop talking. It was a good distraction.
As it turned out, that “something else” was Sherlock’s murmuring into his ear that he would never ask what happened at Scotland Yard. The only thing he wanted to know was if Lestrade had any culpability, and if John knew of some way that they could help him get off. “I owe him my life,” Sherlock said, quietly. “Both of you. I owe you for phoning him, and him for rescuing me.”
Sharp, blinding pain racked John’s whole body, knocking the breath out of him. He screamed with such force that the contraction of his lungs made his entire torso spasm, then moaned and gasped as the spasms waned, unable to think of anything save for the pain.
“Fuck,” John moaned, giving in. He grasped the back of Sherlock’s neck. “I couldn’t stop thinking about you, either. You’ve no idea, it was awful.” Sherlock started undoing John’s shirt buttons, one after the other, his hands shaking with anticipation. “I’d be sitting there at dinner, with Mary and my parents, daydreaming about your voice, your hands, your mouth....” John grabbed Sherlock’s face to kiss him again. Sherlock leaned forward, sank into the curve of John’s torso.
did it, what made Sherlock realize that he’d severely miscalculated: the tone of John’s voice. It made his hair stand on end, drove a hot knife through his belly—
how many times Sherlock had got hard at the thought of this happening. How many times he’d brought himself to climax thinking about it, just the kissing. Oh, he’d thought about other things too, of course he had, but the kissing alone could do it for him. And even simpler things could do it for him, on his really horny days—for instance, John being in the shower. Sherlock couldn’t count the number of times he’d been in his bedroom and heard John get into the shower and had masturbated, quietly as he could, laying back on his bed, thinking about John’s body under the hot running water.
John squirmed and moaned under my hand. I squeezed his arse, digging my fingernails in. Then I hooked the fingers of both hands into the waistband of his pants and practically ripped them off. John lifted his hips and went to his knees, his forehead resting on the bed between his arms. “Yes, Sherlock, yes—“ I got behind him and spread open his cheeks. I spit onto my hand and shoved two fingers in, right from the start. He made a noise of pain.
“There’s no ‘point’ to it at all; we’re family, Sherlock. Therefore, I would risk my wellbeing to protect you, but I will not for Lestrade.”
John was sitting fully upright, his chest heaving with breath, and looking at me, bloody scrutinizing, in a way I’d never seen. I was starting to panic. I should have put an end to the conversation when it started.
Sherlock jumped a little as a voice spoke to him from behind. He turned around and observed a young woman with long, dark hair and dark, clever eyes. She smiled, tentatively. “Sherlock.”
. I just can’t. It means something that you could never be. I don’t mean that in a bad way,” she amended, quickly. “Just, I’ve used it for so long to mean the person that I tell all my thoughts to. Things I’d never actually tell someone. Like a… a…”
Because after everything and all those years and living in the woods and Sherlock coming, it was the only thing he could do.
Sherlock was gripping both arms of his chair, staring Ella down with such force that John was surprised she could hold his gaze. John, for his part, was holding his breath, hoping to God that Sherlock wouldn’t blow up on her. It had taken much coaxing and threatening on John’s part to get him to come here, but somehow, here they were. And Ella clearly thought she was going to have a field day with the deductive genius and self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath that was Sherlock Holmes.
. It’s cold outside. I want to play with Lyra!” Anna ran to the couch and picked up her new doll, just opened that morning.
Sherlock’s eyes were blazing with rage. “Nothing is fine, Mycroft. It is the opposite of fine.” He was shaking. “We had a deal. You promised you wouldn’t tell her.”
, pure and simple. These were crimes of passion, not selfless sacrifice.” He smirked. “It just so happens that John’s passion took the form of mutilation and torture, where yours was a simple shot to the head.”
“So, let me get this straight,” said Molly. “You are training to be a spy for the British government, through the instigation of Mycroft Holmes.”
“I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to go back in there,” clarified the D.I., “but I figured you’d do it anyway. So I wanted to let you know. We can go in.”
John looked down at the mess of blankets on the floor. There was still one crumpled over his legs and he took a corner of it and folded it back on itself and smoothed out the crease.
“Jim Moriarty is the largest threat to human kind that I have ever witnessed. I will sacrifice my brother to obliterate that threat. I will sacrifice his lover, his daughter, his friends. I would sacrifice myself if I thought that I’d do more to protect the world dead than alive. Fortunately for me, that is not the case.” Mycroft allowed himself a small smirk of self-satisfaction.
Mrs. Hudson whipped around, faster than John would have thought, and gave him a glare. “John Watson, don’t you dare say I’m old!”
Sherlock had severely miscalculated. Instead of being able to put his fantasies of John into the back of his mind, they were multiplying, spreading, growing, taking
However, John seemed to have other plans for this afternoon. “Hey,” he said softly, putting his hand over mine to still it. “Why don’t we try something else today, hm?” He smiled down at me, his eyes already glazed with lust.
John paid special attention to both of his balls, continuously working his hand on Sherlock’s shaft, slowly, sensually. Controlled. The way Sherlock liked it.
was tired, certainly—I’d spent the majority of the night awake and waiting for a phone call that he’d been eviscerated by his jealous ex-assassin wife. Or a knock on the door that would be her coming for me. She’d already tried to kill me once, and that was
“She was a complete moron, that’s how,” Sherlock spat, and John snorted out another laugh. “Well, she was! Put the rug back the wrong way round. Can you believe that, John?” Sherlock leaned forward over the coffee table, his drink dangling in his hand. “Picked up the whole bloody rug just to shove one measly envelope underneath! I mean, all she had to do was just lift up the corner,” he mimed it in the air, “and slip it in! How can people be such
Mycroft sighed heavily. “Molly, do sit down,” he told her, motioning to Sherlock’s chair. Molly remained standing. “Quickly, before you give yourself an aneurism.”
He heard movement in front of him and looked up just in time to see John crossing the room toward him and pulling him into another kiss.
“You’d think that, but you wouldn’t have recognized him. That child could do no wrong. Honestly, if she’d kept up that ‘Polly’ business, I’ll wager Sherlock would have ordered me to legally change my name.”
“Of course,” said Anna, excited. Then she looked past Molly to where Sherlock was sitting in his chair, staring at them, his fingers steepled under his chin. “Can I go?” she asked, hesitantly.
Sherlock eyed John once more, then held out his map, turning it around and upside down. “So, left here, then right in two… or three? Did she say three blocks?” He frowned. “Shit.”
The Major inclined his head in a goodbye and walked off down the hall. Sherlock watched his retreating figure, deep in thought, then turned back to look at John through the window—and was startled when John caught his eye. “
“You’re so... ah.... oh—oh my God—“ His fingers tightened on my arm. They were going to leave bruises, evidence that would last days afterward. “Just like that, yeah, and twist—twist at the top—“ I twisted his foreskin over the head of his cock, ever so slightly, and John moaned. His legs began to shake. “Yeah, ah, oh, Sherlock, I’m gonna—I’m—oh, Sherl—“ His speech dissolved into incoherencies and my hand suddenly slid smooth and slippery over his spasms.
“For me,” John clarified. His eyes were suddenly shining. “Do you even feel anything for me, anymore?”
That night, after the rest of his family had gone to bed, Sherlock had snuck out of his room and poured over all the dictionaries and encyclopedias, learning everything he could about the word “sex.” His parents had had nothing to do with it.
John gaped; this was not a turn he’d expected this conversation to take. “Sherlock, this has nothing to do with the fact that I… I mean, I’m not trying to say that there’s something wrong with… with kissing you… I mean, it’s just I’m not… not…” John trailed off, suddenly feeling angry. “Bloody hell, Sherlock, it’s not always about you!”
?” coughed Sherlock, in a weak impression of a screech. “What are you doing out of school on a weekday? John,” he rounded on him, “you may be new to parenting, but even you should know this is completely out of line. Get her back in class, at once.” He turned back to Anna. “You’ve already missed too much time, and we all know your marks cannot afford that.”
Sherlock switched off the kettle and hurried into the bathroom, closing (and locking) the door. He turned on the shower, remembering last night, and his dream, and
If there was one thing that never failed to worry Mycroft, it was Sherlock’s feelings. But Mycroft seemed uninterested this time—in fact, he had seemed uninterested throughout the whole ordeal. It was as if hurting Sherlock was actually part of his plan. It was bizarre, and not in the usual “Holmes’ unorthodox-response-to-human-feelings” way, either (which she was all too familiar with). No, this was something else. It smelled fishy. And it got her thinking, as she waited in Sherlock’s flat with nothing else to do….
His gaze softened and he continued. “I was selfish, for a long time. I forced his memory on you all those years, but it was never for your benefit, it was for mine... I see that now.” He paused. “And I sincerely apologize, for that.”
The two men flew out both doors and rushed down the hallway, around to the back of the building where John had initially entered. They spilled out into the alleyway, Lestrade turning to catch the door before it banged closed. John paused in the middle of the street, his breath rapidly expanding and contracting his blood-spattered chest. “Greg—“
“I’m going to join a band,” Anna announced, once Sherlock had come home and plunked down in his chair with his newspaper. She was surfing the web on her laptop, and kept on as if nothing surprising had come out of her mouth. She heard the crinkle of the paper and saw Sherlock gaze suspiciously at her over top of it.
“Da-da,” Anna responded, smiling. Then she grabbed two orange blocks and proceeded to speak to him in a string of unintelligible gibberish.
John wanted to hug him. He wanted to get up, step outside the glass and hug him, tell him everything was okay, run his hands through his hair, turn his face up and wipe the tears away, kiss his lips—
you,” Mycroft told him, smoothing his hair and adjusting his coat. “You are so naïve, Sherlock (and don’t become cross, you
At first she thought they were the police, and panicked—until they chloroformed her with a dirty rag. Her last thought before she passed out was,
A fierceness sprung into Anna’s eyes. “I’m going to make him pay for what he did, Molly. For what he did to my father—I mean, John…” she shook her head a little. “And to Sherlock.”
woman’s life ended from something as base as childbirth. Billions upon billions of women have survived it, and yet Mary, who had survived so much more, didn’t. You’re angry because you don’t know who to be angry with, because no one killed her; it wasn’t a violent death, it was a natural one. You don’t know on whom to take your revenge, because there is no one to blame. Well,” Sherlock amended, cocking his head to one side, “except for maybe yourself. Maybe you are angry with yourself, the only possible person to blame, for getting her pregnant in the first place.”
“And you’re a feminist, given by the trouser suit and the lack of jewelry, but insecure, you still wear makeup, and a little too much, not quite the right color for this decade, probably trying to recreate a look from an old photo when you were younger, prettier. Adverse to change, then, as well. The photograph on your desk is of your ex-husband, how do I know he’s an ex? Because no wedding ring, not right now, but you’ve been wearing it recently, I can see the indentation on your finger. You wear it in private and then take it off so no one will know you’re still in love with him.”
I gasped. Legitimately gasped, and the world went dark for a second. I realized after the fact that it was because I’d closed my eyes.
“Yes, you tried it half-baked, before Mary actually knew who she was and that such a thing called the ‘Agra treasure’ existed at all. She hadn’t been told a
John didn’t look at Sherlock directly but he saw him eat everything that he was given and drink all of his tea. He thought it was the most he’d ever seen Sherlock eat in one sitting. He almost said something but caught himself in time. That was what Sherlock wanted and John would not do it, not to spite him but because he didn’t actually care. If Sherlock ate full meals now it was no concern of his and it didn’t affect him one way or another. He would not say anything because any words he used would be meaningless and only to fill the void of silence, which was a void that John was comfortable with now. They could sit and eat in silence and if Sherlock was uncomfortable then it wasn’t John’s problem.
