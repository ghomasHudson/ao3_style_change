The hissed curse and an array of limbs near catapulting themselves over the back of the couch were Steve’s only warnings before he suddenly had a lapful of Tony, who promptly took Steve’s face between his hands and kissed him, skipping right past chaste and going right to tongue. Lots of tongue.
In the end notes, you can find which movie the quotes are from....though I'm sure you'll recognize them anyway XD
He’d been expecting panic, fear, a healthy dose of betrayal, had plans of action ready to enact for any combination of these. Now….
Steve managed a smile when Tony retracted the helmet. Just seeing his face was enough to make everything else fade into the background. For just this moment, nothing else mattered. Tony was here, and that was all he needed to know.
Tony processed the words carefully, making sure he understood them correctly with his still somewhat muddled-over mind, before finally asking, “How exactly did you think this would be helpful?”
Tony just smiled in that way that made Steve’s chest tighten under the weight of the love and unyielding desire he felt for this man, and slowly slid his arms around Steve’s neck until their lips were all but touching.
“I just wanted to get that back for you,” Steve went on, completely unaware of what he was evoking within the man beside him. “I wanted to help you, and I thought that…”
But as much as Steve wanted to stay pressed against Tony like this, he wanted more to get Tony out of here and somewhere safe, regroup with the team - what was left of them, he thought, pressing his face further into Tony’s warmth as the pain of that settled in him like a steel ball - and find a way to destroy that which had taken so much away from them. Steve forced himself to pull away, thankful Tony took the cue and did the same, not sure he would have been able to resist the temptation to push his nose into Tony’s hair next.
“There was a fairy princess who weaved the most beautifully colored clouds, pinks and golds and blues, more vibrant than any other could create. But she was restless and grew bored of her heavenly duties. So she stole down to Earth for a night in search of some fun. While there, she met a mortal cow herder, and they fell desperately in love. They were soon married and had two beautiful children. And they were happy.
Tony’s response was to get his foot caught on a rock – or what he assumed was a rock. The only reason he didn’t go sprawling face first into the dirt was Steve’s enhanced reflexes bracing his arms around Tony before either of them had even registered he’d moved. “You were saying?” Tony bit out as he regained his footing.
Steve swallowed his current mouthful and pivoted his head to find Tony half turned back to face the soldier with a curious expression. Steve looked down to the water in his hands, then down to the unfinished chocolate bar in his lap, assuming by the wording that Tony was referring to the latter. “I probably shouldn’t—”
Before he knew it, the bar was devoured and he was licking off whatever had melted and stuck to his fingers.
Steve smiled brightly. “I’d like to go. Seventh month so, July...if we tell Fury now, that’d be more than enough notice.”
Steve gave another yank at the restraints, his eyes beginning to burn as desperation took over. “God damn it, Tony!”
“Just keep in mind that if I trip and break my neck out here, there isn’t anyone else who can catch your ass when you decide to jump out of every fucking tall building you can find,” Tony complained as he walked, each step as blind and tentative as the last. “I mean I guess there’s Thor. But let’s face it, we all know he gets way too excited playing whack-a-mole with the bad guys to pay us any kind of attention.”
He loved hearing Tony speak like this. Most of the time Tony went on some triade, it was about some crazy night in college, or a party that ended not at all flatteringly, or even about some project he was working on and lord knew Steve couldn’t follow any of the common day slang or technobabble if his life depended on it.
Steve nodded again. “Good.” He took a breath and reached forward to take Tony’s hand again, gently peeling the fingers away to ease the pull on the skin. “We should get some alcohol on that cut. I think our first aid kit is in the bathroom.”
“Hey,” Steve exclaimed around the shuffling of fabric, the jacket in Tony’s hand shifting but never slipping loose as Steve changed positions. “I’m here, Tony. I’m right here. Can you hear me?”
Curious and figuring that it wouldn’t hurt to try a piece, Steve had opened the oddly shaped box and tried a piece.
He pinched the tips of each finger to pull the glove loose, each tug feeling a bit like sandpaper against his skin. It took a few seconds, but when he had it off it was a bit of a relief. Until he looked at it.
Though even if it did, it looked almost comical amongst the still reddening other knuckles, one of which was already starting to go a little dark. How the fuck was he supposed to keep this under wraps, for lack of a better word? He wasn’t willing to add any more Hawkeye paraphernalia to his being, lecture be damned. Not like that would have been any less conspicuous anyway.
Tony continued nodding as he made his way towards the door, taking the time to put the glove back on, wincing as he did. Did the damn thing shrink?
They laid there silently, just feeling each other and sharing warmth between them. Tony took a long breath, letting the familiar smell of Steve seep into him, settling whatever residual unease was left over, replacing it with something rounder, something more substantial and consequential. Something he could hold onto and feel grounded.
“‘Just a bit further,’ he says,” Tony mutters, his hands tightening around Steve’s as he steps on a bit of uneven ground. “What, the five hour drive and hour long walk wasn’t enough already?”
Tony couldn’t hold back his smile. “No, they did not. And certainly not the Greeks. They had no qualms with striking down us mortals. Do you know the story of Orion?”
His thought stream was cut short by a series of banging and shuffling noises coming from behind him. Turning to look, he saw Tony in the kitchen apparently doing his level best to open and close every drawer, cabinet, and cupboard in the room. Twice.
Steve smiled as he felt the very last of the tenseness release from Tony’s shoulders with a contented sigh that made Steve happier than he’d feared would be at all possible tonight. Really, he should just be used to Tony surprising him by now.
Happy shook his head and he made the turn to pull into the garage at the Tower. “Just a long way of saying rusty.”
Well, he may at least be able to use this time to his advantage. “How long has he been in the shower?”
So many….so….Why are there so many? Too many, they were surrounding him, trapping him, encasing him...imprisoning him in heat and fire and beauty and fear and...so, so many….far too many...
Tony had blinked rapidly, breaking him out of the trance first, and didn’t speak a word as he’d closed the distance in three large steps to take Steve’s hand to lick off what was left of the chocolate for him, even going so far as to slip two whole fingers into his mouth until his lips caressed the base knuckle as his tongue did it’s ever best to lick every last bit of the chocolate away. Once his task was finished and an entirely different digit of Steve’s was aching for similar attention, Tony used the now clean hand to pull Steve toward the bedroom to do just that.
“Well yeah, that too, it’s just...I mean I get that they’re gods and all, but so’s Thor, and granted he eats enough to feed a small army, but I highly doubt he could swallow a baby whole.”
“It’s okay. You don’t have to explain anything. Not now. Or ever, if you don’t want. We can...we can just go home. Get you warm and….we could watch a movie. Or I could read you a book, or anything you want. Okay?”
Tony pulled away, just enough to mutter into Steve’s mouth, “I love you,” before kissing him again, not letting Steve utter a sound beyond the agonized whimper he couldn't manage to hold back. “So much.” This kiss didn’t last much longer before he pulled away again, the distinct taste of salt passing between them as he continued on to pepper kisses across Steve’s face. “I love you so much. I-- Fuck, this isn’t fair,” he hissed, the fingers in Steve’s hair curling in tight against his scalp. “I wanted…damn it, I was really looking forward to…to us, to...I really wanted this...” Tony fumbled over his words, had to catch his breath with a painful-sounding hitch. “God, Steve, please tell me you know how much I...how loved you are. Tell me I didn’t epically fuck that up, because...everything. You’re
“You know I can’t.” Tony’s voice went whisper soft as he drew their faces closer together. “And neither would you.”
His knees, a dull ache throbbing through them both like he’s been roundhoused with a two-by-four, were tucked under him, pressed firmly to his chest.
He could hear it in Steve’s tone, that he thought he’d failed Tony tonight. Or worse that he’d actively hurt him. It shredded Tony’s heart into tiny, miniscule pieces hearing Steve this way, and to make it worse he knew Steve well enough to know that he was going to drown himself in his own guilt if Tony didn’t do something right now.
Tony rolled his eyes, remembering the day Clint had come in, holding the box high like it was a Heisman trophy, announcing that he was officially the coolest member. Natasha had remarked that it was a reflection on his klutziness. True to form, he’d used his first bandage that night.
They resumed their previous actions of Tony cautiously stepping forward with his hands outstretched, both of which were gently but firmly grasped in both of Steve’s who was guiding him through wherever the hell they were.
Fucking magic. Alien magic, at that. Because just one wouldn’t have been enough. “Of course not,” he muttered darkly with another pull.
Steve pulled at his restraints; pulled until he could feel the muscles in his arms and back nearly rip to shreds, but he kept pulling.
Steve’s grip loosened – only then even realizing he’d grabbed him so tightly – and rubbed his thumbs along Tony’s pulse points apologetically. “You remember what I said a little bit ago? When I said I’d never let you fall?”
Steve used the quiet to again glance over the stars, trying to see what Tony saw when he had looked before for that brief moment when his face had seen wonder and beauty before it was overshadowed by the pain and the fear. All the stories and history and memories and--
Steve wasn’t quite sure what to do with that answer given the man’s actions. He opened his mouth as though he actually knew an appropriate response, but then closed it when he realized that there really wasn’t one.
“As if that big squishy teddy bear would ever so much as steal candy from a baby, much less eat it,” Tony chuckled and nuzzled his nose across Steve’s chest. “Anyway, needless to say, that was hardly Mom’s favorite story. Too much gore, not enough feels. I think the only reason she even told it was because she knew I’d get a kick out of it.”
Even still, he didn't dare look away, forcing himself to remember this moment, the way the metal reflected the light, the exact shade of white-blue light the reactor shone, the precise way Tony held his body when holding himself still mid-flight. He saw it all and memorized every piece, every detail. Even as his vision blurred, he took to furiously blinking as opposed to turning to scrub them dry - the thought of not being able to see Tony right then, for even a moment, was endlessly terrifying.
He could feel Steve’s confusion in the hesitant way he brought his arms around Tony in his usual hold, but once they were there, Steve held Tony tight against his body, one big hand cupping Tony’s head through his jacket.
Tony took a shaky inhale and continued. “She’d take me outside and show me the constellations, tell me the myths and stories from all over the world. So, on clear nights when I can actually see them in the city…it’s….I can hear her voice again.”
“Not even a little. Artemis is also, ironically, the protector of animals and she didn’t like when hunters killed more than they needed, so of course his ‘gift’ for her was not well received. She summoned a scorpion from the ground to sting and kill Orion painfully and slowly. Zeus stepped in and placed both Orion and the scorpion, which you know as Scorpio, at opposite ends of the sky to prevent further conflict, but also as a warning to all hunters.”
happened. He said he’d find you sometimes looking up at them and it was like...like you were so calm. Comforted by them. And it killed me to know that that comfort had been taken from you. Especially as a consequence of you nearly sacrificing yourself to save millions of lives. It isn’t right.”
Steve went quiet, then there was a sigh. Careful fingers slowly dug their way under the jacket, not actually lifting the sides but just enough for the digits to slide under and touch the side of Tony’s hand as they gave a comforting slide back and forth across skin.
Tony groaned. “No.” It'd be pretty conspicuous if Tony didn't want to join him and he couldn’t very well step into a shower with his hand the way it was. He knew he couldn’t hide it for too long, but at least maybe for tonight. Just tonight, he could hold off a lecture. He wasn’t in any mood.
The image he managed to conjure in his mind was beautiful and only served to deepen the ache he felt, because he, too, now, was resentful that Tony’s reward for his valiant altruism had been to not only lose something that had seemingly brought him such peace of mind, but to have it be turned on him in such a cruel way.
Steve was pulled from his wonderings to look back down to his jacket-covered boyfriend draped over his chest. “Persephone?”
“Hey! What? Nothing!” Tony swung around, making sure his hand was behind him and doing what he could to sweep the wrappers over, hidden behind his body..
Steve rolled his eyes with an exasperated but endeared smile, and added in a mollifying tone, “I’m sure Sam will be very grateful. And even if he’s not, I’m sure proud of you.”
It was passionate and sexy and…odd. Not ‘bad’ odd, not even a little. It was actually one of their better kisses, but there was definitely something a off about it. He’d say it was the chocolate, which was certainly something new, but if anything, the bitter sweetness of the dark chocolate mixed with Tony was hot as hell, and they were definitely going to have a discussion about that at a later point when his tongue wasn’t so preoccupied with Tony’s, which seemed to be doing it’s own acrobatic act into every corner of his…oh. Oooh.
Steve felt triumphant when Tony slid out from under the car, but he didn’t look in Steve’s direction.
“Are you aware of the function of the arc reactor?” The hologram spun on its side, giving Steve a full view of the arc reactor. He saw wires protruding from the bottom end.
Steve fell to his knees by Tony’s body. The suit was coming apart, exposing Tony’s prone form, until all the metal covering his chest was removed.
Steve walked over and reorganized the fallen items. Tony had found what he was looking for: mustard, ketchup, lettuce, french fries (Clint’s), tomato slices, julienned pickle, three types of cheeses, and sliced cucumber. Tony, somehow, managed to squish all of it between two slices of bread and took a giant bite.
On his fifth drawing, Steve drew Tony without his faceplate. It made him grin, the sight of Tony’s bare face sticking out of that suit. He’d never tell Tony, of course.
“We can handle this, Hawkeye,” said Steve, glaring daggers at Tony. In return, Tony gave him a white-toothed smile.
“Tony,” Steve said. He reached out to grab Tony’s hand, but the paramedic threw her arm out to block him.
It was quiet, for a time. The sky was free from aliens, robots, and bitter gods with a tendency towards the dramatic. Tony seldom showed his face and hardly ever talked to Steve, except yesterday, when Steve had said “good morning” and Tony had replied with a grunt. He’d had a sandwich in his mouth and looked hungover, so Steve wasn’t too bothered.
Steve didn’t think - he pushed his hands into Tony’s sternum, squinting from the bright, blue light. One, Two, One, Two, One Two. Between compressions, he felt the deep hum of the blue light.
“You can’t just go around pulling jokes on us like that. What if you were really in danger? We wouldn’t have known. And the next time you do that - ”
“Don’t fucking talk about them. Do you think I don’t think about them? You think I don’t have nightmares about them? You think I don’t see their faces at night?”
He and Natasha were sitting in the lounge in silence. Steve wasn’t in the mood for talking, and Natasha was reading. She wasn’t the chatty type anyway.
“Let go of him,” the paramedic ordered, and Steve realized he’d been squeezing Tony’s hands bloodless.
“What, you're pinning this on me again? Goddammit, Steve, at least we’re alive." Tony's voice was bland and tired.
But looking down at Tony, with smile wrinkles around his eyes, browned skin, and blooming purple bruises, Steve couldn't stop the steady thump-thump of affection and anxiety.
Tony, for whatever reason, had insisted Steve live in his tower. “You need to get out of that musty health hazard of an apartment. There's probably asbestos in the ceiling. That's a carcinogen, by the way.” So now Steve was sprawled on a king-sized mattress lying on sheets worth more than a month’s rent in Lower Manhattan. It didn’t matter. It was all pocket change to Tony.
"I'm not in the mood for this." Tony's voice was sharp and brittle, so much so that Steve let him push past and disappear.
Freed from the bird, Steve put a hand on his throat. His palm came away slick and wet. A few feet away, the bird lay in a sizzling heap on the ground. “Steve,” Tony said, running up to Steve.
Steve looked back at the puzzle, feeling queasy. He heard Tony set the cognac down. The container rattled hollowly.
Apparently, they hadn’t managed to get rid of all of the genetically engineered birds that had appeared earlier that morning.
Steve had six broken ribs, but the doctors gave him bandages only as a protocol - his wounds would heal within hours at most. Only fading white scars remained on his neck, and his bruises had disappeared. Natasha and Clint sat on the other side of the room. Natasha had broken a wrist, which had been set, and a nurse was stitching up Clint.
It had been three days, Tony was alive, and Steve still saw red when he closed his eyes. He didn’t know exactly who he was angry with. All he knew was that it gathered in his belly and wouldn’t go away.
“You’re such an old man,” Clint said. "You’ll be wanting the newspaper, ri-oh my god.” Steve had opened to the puzzle section The New York Times.
Why did they always go for art? Steve wondered. First Nazis, now robots. Most of them followed their leader’s instructions to cause general chaos and destruction, but there were a few rogue ones who’d wandered south and into the MoMA to fry some paintings.
Tony wasn’t there for the debriefing, which was unusual - ever since Pepper had taken charge of the company, Tony was always present for debriefings, what with his boss breathing down his neck. Unless he’d been seriously injured, he always managed to show up, albeit about half an hour late. Worst of all, Fury didn’t even question it. He shut Steve and his questions down, multiple times. By the time Steve returned to his quarters, he was fuming. He took a burning shower and considered shredding his mattress to bits.
Steve felt like he’d been there for hours when he felt a hand on his shoulder. It was Natasha. “Come on,” she said. “Tony’s gonna be okay.”
Tony lowered Steve onto the ground and Steve tore off his cowl, ready to scream. Tony popped open his faceplate. “Cap. Relax.”
For several days now, Steve had only been at the Tower to sleep, and he’d always slipped in as unobtrusively as possible. Today, however, Steve had woken up to the sound of heavy sleet hitting his window and decided to use the gym instead.
"I am always with Sir,” JARVIS replied, sounding faintly amused. “As I said, Captain Rogers, I must address some concerns."
"Yes, in the operating room. Due to Mr. Stark’s situation, we agreed to implant an ICD. It was intended to be temporary, but the computer said that it couldn’t allow that, and made several threats.” Dr. Mendez paled slightly. “Since Mr. Stark’s condition was stable, we decided not to interfere. The rest of the armor didn’t come off until we left him here alone.” Dr. Mendez gestured to a briefcase tucked in the corner of the room. “That's where his suit went.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t feel like it.” Tony opened the cabinet drawer where cookware was kept and pulled out a bottle of cognac.
But Tony was already gone. Steve looked down at his Sudoku, only to realize he had snapped his pencil in half.
Steve wondered if reading something would help and got up to look at the bookshelf. He had just selected an Agatha Christie when the door opened.
“He’s fine,” Bruce said, grabbing Steve’s shoulder. “He’s got a few second-degree burns, but he’ll be fine.”
Thor wasn’t usually in the Tower. When he was, he always took Steve out to pizza. It made Steve a little queasy to watch Thor eat, but Thor made him laugh, and he listened to Steve’s aimless rambling.
Dr. Mendez looked at Tony. "He woke up sporadically for a while, but as soon as the armor came off, we put him on painkillers. He's very weak."
Tony and Steve stood frozen, staring at each other. Natasha slipping past Tony, gently patting his shoulder. “Be nice,” she said.
Steve jumped. He still felt unsettled by the disembodied voice in the ceiling and avoided it whenever possible.
“Sir! Sir!” Steve looked up, not stopping for a moment. It was a first responder, and she was holding a manual defibrillator. With practiced hands, she opened Tony’s shirt and smoothed the pads onto his body.
Steve tried to stand and felt like his ribs were burning. He tried to hide his wince, but it was too late. Tony wrapped a mechanical hand around Steve’s arm. “All right. We’re taking a little trip down to medical.”
It was a quiet Thursday afternoon when Steve, not sure what was possessing him to do so, decided to put an end to Tony’s perpetual absence. He went downstairs to Tony’s lab and peered through the glass doors, which were locked shut.
Clint laughed. “Sir, yes sir." He pushed himself off the countertop he’d been sitting on. “Well, time to go drag my ass down to training. With Nat.” He disappeared out the door, his gaze shifting over the ceiling. The pair had a knack for climbing through the vents no matter how many deterrents Tony put in place.
Steve tried to sit up, but the world spun, and it felt like someone had knifed him in the chest. Tony pushed Steve back down. “Don’t move, all right?”
But he did remember Tony. He was wearing a blue hospital gown, eyes closed, his upper body covered in wires and stickers and tubes. But his chest was moving up and down, and the heart rate monitor’s beep was steady.
"I'm coming,” Steve said. He veered towards Central Park, where he saw a plume of smoke rising into the sky.
Over the earpiece, he heard Tony whoop. A moment later, a red streak circled across the sky in a glorified victory lap.
Bruce’s lab was strangely soothing. Bruce was calm and methodical about everything, to the point where Steve wondered how much of it was a practiced calm and how much of it was natural. He had considered coming more often, but the lab was Bruce’s refuge, so he didn’t intrude too often.
Steve ran past a staggering robot that promptly collapsed into a heap. These robots were big and could discharge volts of electricity, but their legs were spindly and easily broken.
As soon as the doctor left, Steve went over to the suitcase. The lock appeared simple, but when he pressed his fingers to open it, it wouldn’t budge. Instead, Jarvis’s voice filled the room. “Reading. Captain Steven Rogers. Access authorized.” The metal locks unfurled to reveal a small lens. It clicked on, and a hologram of the arc reactor appeared before Steve.
The paramedic sat back on her feet, muttering under her breath. Then she leaned forward and began chest compressions.
Steve flipped to another page of his sketchbook and started another drawing. Tony flying, Tony blasting one of those birds, Tony and Loki facing off. Steve smiled at the memory. Loki had looked especially pompous that day.
“On your six, Iron Man!” Steve said. A giant robot, much bigger than the rest, moved towards them, crackling with energy.
Steve spent time with Natasha and Clint when they weren’t on away missions. They trained and practiced hand to hand combat with each other. He also spent time with Bruce in the lab. Tony had given Bruce his lab, complete with enough funding to rival the GDP of a small country.
The head, the arms, the legs. Rough bits of a person. And then: more detail. The shining bits of armor, the hard lines of metal. And finally: the glow of light in the middle of his chest. Tony Stark, the Iron Man.
“Jesus fuck, you traitorous son of a bitch!” Tony yelled at the ceiling. He moved past the table, rattling Steve's soggy bowl of Cheerios. He threw his half-eaten sandwich into the garbage.
“I wasn’t dying. You know that." Steve stepped closer, and he was gratified to see that Tony looked intimidated. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
Steve rescued a Picasso, too. He had just subdued the last of the museum robots when he heard Clint’s voice. “Cap, are you with us?”
“Captain Rogers," The voice said, calm as ever, "I am ridding the suit of electric charge. Sir is in cardiac arrest. I have already contacted emergency services.”
The world tilted and Steve squinted, trying to focus on Tony’s face. There were bags under Tony’s eyes, dark and bruised.
Steve winced when Tony took a swig. Do something, he thought. But he stayed frozen in his chair, staring at the sudoku numbers blurring together.
He was a little more than halfway through the bar when he heard from across the room, “Should I leave you two alone?”
There was another silence as they each continued to stare at the other. Tony’s face pinched in defensiveness, Steve’s somewhat unreadable.
“We need to retreat, just for now. Do damage assessment, see who’s still in a fit state to fight and figure out how to dismantle--”
He watched as the doctor – number four, if he was remembering Bruce’s descriptions correctly. It was another few minutes before the baddie of the week was finally revealed, something he and his friend – no, companion – kept calling Cybermen. Though the more he watched, the more he wondered if Dr. Doom wasn’t a also a fan of the show, considering there were a suspicious number of similarities between these Cyber-whatevers and the Doom—
Tony glared at the placating tone but his blush made it not nearly as intimidating as Steve was sure Tony had intended.
Tony hadn’t realized he’d been crying until he felt a thumb wipe a tear across his cheek. He looked up to see that Steve had pulled the jacket up high enough to cover the both of them so they could see each other for the first time since…
“Yes,” Tony answered with no small amount of hesitance. Not exactly the feel Steve had been going for, but he was hoping his next words would help.
Steve was quiet before he huffed out a breath of laughter. “Well damn. The gods didn’t screw around back then, did they?”
Tony smirked resignedly. He couldn’t say he was surprised at the question. He’d pretty much walked right into it and he’d known it the moment the words were out of his mouth. It was something he hadn’t really given much thought to. Each story meant something to him, each one having painfully carved out its own special little place in his memory. Trying to pick a favorite would be like picking a favorite between Rhodey and Pepper. Not at all something he would be even remotely capable of.
Tony felt the blush immediately splash across his cheeks and buried his face in Steve’s chest, even though the jacket was still hiding him plenty enough.
Tony wasn’t sure how to respond to that. Rhodey was not exactly known for being subtle, especially when it came to Tony, and most especially when it came to Tony’s well-being. He was more the ‘Everyone and your kid-gloves, stand back while I pick up this useless idiot and shove food down his goddamn throat before locking him in his room. Jarvis, don’t you dare let him out until he’s slept for at least a day,’ type, a sentiment which Steve seemed to have adopted even before they’d started dating; though after they did, Steve hadn’t needed Jarvis’s help to ensure Tony stayed in bed.
And with that, Tony told him the story of Hades kidnapping Persephone, and Demeter freezing over the mortal world in demand of her daughter back. Of Zeus having to bargain with them both for a peace that would leave the humans cold and cropless for only the three months of the year that Persephone would be required to be with Hades, hence the winter season.
It was only then he even realized he’d spoken his mother’s words along with her as the memory had played out in his mind’s eye.
Steve, nearly every time, was able to bring him down to that level but then somehow managed to keep him there. And not only keep him there, but help him let go of all the things trying to drag him back up again.
Tony hadn’t even noticed that Steve had been rolling his thumb over his back until it suddenly stopped. Steve’s arms coiled tighter around him, his usual reflex whenever Tony spoke about his parents, as though he alone could protect him from the memories. Some days, Tony almost believed he could.
“LET GO!” a voice screamed and he was immediately released and nearly fell all the way…..all the way down…..falling….he was falling….
Tony leaned back just enough to look at the presented triangle of goodness, then back up to Steve with a blank stare.
Tony was silent for a moment before he burst out laughing in complete disbelief that that was the descriptor that Steve chose to emphasize, simply because he knew it would make Tony smile. He pulled himself up the few inches to press his smile against Steve’s, sharing the last laugh between them. “Pretty sure the story’s old enough to have been the very origin of the term ‘cliche’.”
Steve had to wait for his chuckling to die down before he could get out a full question. “How...I mean…He just
But Tony’s smirk only grew into an incredulous smile. “Honey, you’re talking like I don’t know all this already. I trust you. You know I do.” His smile wavered slightly, though Steve could see he tried to hold it still. “At least I thought you did.”
He’d never understand how Steve did that. Pepper had always had her own way of pacifying him, bringing him from a heightened sense of agitation and bringing it down to a manageable level so he could think and work, but it always just built right back up far sooner than either of them would have liked.
Tony settled further into Steve’s warmth as he let it all settle over him, the quiet sounds of the crickets carried over the still brisk but no longer biting breeze. And of course the steady, reliable ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum that often lulled him to sleep without fail.
Didn’t really matter anyway, because Steve’s attention was more focused on the triangular sweet held in his hand. He took no time in opening the package and snapping off the first near-black pre-cut triangle from the bar.
Now all his mind seemed able to focus on was how beautiful Tony looked like this. He still had yet to look away from the illuminated spectacle above them. And it was a spectacle. Steve had made a trip to this spot once before to speak with the manager of the nearby observatory, and it had been just as stunning then, too, a dark mantle sweeping across the sky, studded with pulsing diamonds.
Tony removed the glove again, though it seemed the sandpaper had been replaced with razors this time, and made quick work of slapping on the bandage over the broken skin. He held out his hand to observe his less than perfect work. Because the abrasion was right on the crown of the knuckle, the bandage had to go up and over the joint awkwardly, not quite giving it the coverage it probably required.
Between getting the flu, then having it turn into bronchitis, then having work go absolutely bonkers...life decided to pile it on just then, I guess.
Steve finally nodded slowly and Tony readied himself for the scolding, the lecture of how he can’t be so reckless, that it was irresponsible and pig-headed, and then sigh with that ‘I’m so disappointed,’ fall of his shoulders.
Now, Steve knew Tony was a perfectionist to a fault, but usually only with the important things: the designing of SI products, engineering and testing of Avengers battle paraphernalia, his clothes, making sure to kiss Steve each night before going to sleep - even on nights spent apart, Tony would send texts of a kiss emoji or ten – his hair. But everything else? He never made the bed, happy to keep it a jumble of chaos, his clothes rarely ever made it into the hamper – okay, Steve may be a little at fault for that, but when he’s actively peeling an eager Tony out of his clothes, tidiness is hardly the first thing on Steve’s mind, and how could anyone really blame him?), he never put the clean dishes away, and he certainly never gave a second thought to the straightness of the paintings on the walls.
There was a pregnant pause as Tony swallowed heavily past the growing tightness in his throat, hoping he’d be able to say now what he’d never been able to say to anyone else before.
With a smile so big it was a wonder his face didn’t split in two, Steve leaned down to press a kiss into Tony’s hair as he whispered, “I’d love to.”
- just as he’d been instructed. He recited equations in his head, theories and algorithms of projects he’d finished and ones that were still in progress. He counted out every inch of the Iron Man suit, recalling every dimension with perfect accuracy. Imagined himself in his workshop, surrounded by his bots, and his machines, and his Jarvis, and his holograms - his own little safety net.
“Just a bit further,” Steve appeased with a smile, though he was more than grateful that Tony couldn’t see just how shaky and nervous he knew it was.
Steve took the one long stride back till he was close enough to wrap his unoccupied arm around Tony’s waist and pressed a kiss to his lips that put the previous kiss to shame.
Anyway, here's the next chapter. The second half of this chapter is not beta-ed, so I would love some comments on your thoughts of the chapter.
“No, no. It’s…” Tony started, lifting his head to look up at Steve’s face and immediately felt guilty for the distressed set to his brow, rubbing at the space just above Steve’s heart in apology. “Altair and Vega, the stars for the cow herder and the princess, won’t be visible here this time of year.”
“I figured it out. I know how to get to the gem and destroy it. Without it, the rest won’t be much of a threat, so...two birds…or, maybe more like a few hundred birds--”
Steve loved Tony’s smile, especially when he was the one who made those tempting lips curve up so captivatingly. It had happened so rarely when they’d first met, that the few times Steve had seen one drawn out by Rhodey or Pepper or JARVIS and the bots, he’d decided that he wanted to be the reason Tony smiled like that.
It was then, when the fog lifted just enough for his mind to process the smell and taste of grass and dirt, that he realized he was lying in the fetal position, face down...in a field? What the fuck...
Tony’s face was downcast as he stepped away, the gauntlet once again wrapping around his hand, repulsor shining bright and unwavering, as the suit lifted him up till he was hovering a few feet in the air.
“The cow herder went with his two children to find and bring back his beloved wife, but the goddess cut a wide river into the sky, what we know today as the Milky Way, forever separating them: the princess on one side sadly weaving away on her loom, and her husband caring for their children on the other.
He shifted to grab the remote from the table, making the wrapping from the chocolate in his lap shuffle loudly. Right, he still hadn’t finished it.
What Steve couldn’t bring himself to ignore was something that Tony had left wide open and Steve was not about to let this gnawing question go unanswered.
Steve led Tony till they reached the edge of the blanket, squeezing Tony’s hands to indicate they’d arrived.
Steve quickly plucked off another piece and shoved both into his mouth. Obviously one just was not going to be nearly enough to distract him from whatever madness this was.
Steve kept his eyes on Tony, never letting them stray from the beautiful image he cast in the suit. It was an image he was more than familiar with, one he adored and could never tire of. He knew every curve, every dip, every sharp line and soft edge intimately, could draw it from memory with absolute precision, had found himself doing just that over the years hundreds of times, countless hours spent on painstakingly capturing every detail. He knew this armor well, and the man within even more so.
“Tony, please just...Just let me...I won’t let anything happen to it or to you. You know that. You know that! You’re safe, sweetheart.”
So many little dancing lights, little speckles of white on a silky-black canvas. Breathtaking. Deadly.
Only then was he was able to take a deep lungful breath, unencumbered by panic and fear and terror, surrounded in Steve’s smell and warmth. He finally felt safe again.
Tony could only gape as he ran that over in his head a few dozen times before it finally managed to set in. He had once wondered at what point it was that people stopped the falling part of falling in love. It had to end at some point right? So why then did it seem like he was always falling deeper and deeper in love with this man?
The first time had been an accident. Tony was a man of acquired tastes. Aka expensive tastes. Aka one could probably run a small country on the amount he shelled out when he took anyone out to a nice dinner. So Steve had been a bit hesitant when he’d stumbled across a triangular cardboard prism labeled in bright red on a black background the word Toblerone. The name sounded vaguely familiar, something someone had mentioned during the war but hadn’t paid much mind to – as he’d had more important things to think about at the time – and he was fairly certain he’d seen Natasha eating out of a similar yellow box before.
“Yeah, yeah. Just wanna make sure you didn’t forget.” Happy looked back down as the light turned green. “We hardly spar anymore, you know? Now that you got your superfriends to train with.”
Tony couldn’t do anything but nod, the throbbing in his hand intensifying as he tried to unclench it.
The engineer opened his mouth, but JARVIS’s voice intoned from the suit before he could say another word.
But he didn’t stop there. Tony spun tales of all kinds, and Steve listened intently, so invested in every story that he couldn't stop himself from responding along to the characters’ wiles: The five Indian princes who traveled to find heaven – he hummed happily when the eldest Indian prince kept fiercely loyal to his canine companion, his devotion allowing them both entrance into heaven and the canine a place in the stars; One of Juno’s lovers being turned into a bear out of jealousy - he took a fearful inhale and gripped Tony tighter when the all too able hunter, Arcas, took aim at the bear he hadn’t known had once been his mother, only for Juno to turn the son into a bear as well so they may be together again as mother and son in the skies; Aries the ram who was sent by the goddess Hermes to rescue a young prince and princess whose step-mother was less than kind to them - he sighed sadly the princess, Helle, lost her grip and fell to her death, the people naming the body of water in which she landed Hellespont in her honor and the gods aligning stars in the doughty ram’s form. The outrageously bizarre tale of Zeus’s origin story consisting of his father, Cronus, hearing of a prophecy that his sons would overthrow him, so he swallowed them all whole save for Zeus whose mother had stolen him away to protect him – he was still laughing, even after Tony had told the part of when Cronus had later regurgitated them all back up again when Zeus poisoned him and fought his father alongside his brothers, overthrowing him and fulfilling the prophecy.
He started and peered up at hearing his name in the familiar robotic modulation, only then hearing the sound of repulsors as beautiful lines of red and gold lowered in front of him. A wave of relief hit him so hard he lost his breath a moment before he tried to pull at his restraints again, if only to get his hands on the man hovering in front of him.
“But we should be able to see them as early as June. If you...You know, if you wanted to come back then.” Tony closed his eyes as his breath hitches in his throat. Shit, now his own heart felt like it was about to start beating out of his chest at the thought of seeing that sky again. Breathe. In...out….
So it was not at all an odd occurrence when Steve, newly returned a day of nothing but meetings – he was starting to understand why Tony skipped out on so many of them; too many in a single day was surprisingly exhausting, considering the fact that he generally remained sitting for most of it – grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge, snatched a Dark Toblerone from the pile, and sat himself on the couch before asking JARVIS to turn on the latest episode of whatever was on last. Steve frowned thoughtfully when an older episode of Doctor Who illuminated the screen. Looks like Bruce was back early from Brazil.
“No, no of course not, just um...I-” In his effort to keep the wrappings blocked from view, he brushed them too far until they trickled to the floor. Steve bent down to pick them up.
And Steve probably would have been perfectly able to support Tony in this by keeping him as far from the night sky and as distracted as possible whenever needed, until…
Tony opened his eyes at that. He couldn’t see past the darkness that the jacket provided him, which he was perfectly fine with, but he was surprised enough that he did anyway.
He thought for a moment, recalling one story in particular he remembered having a bit more of an impact on him. He closed his eyes, letting the memory and the words wash over him, a dull ache starting in his chest.
They stood breathing each other’s air, Steve basking in the feeling of Tony’s fingers carding through the hair at the back of his neck absentmindedly, when he felt more than saw Tony’s lips move to form a comment.
Steve chuckled. “You’re welcome, and I love you too. Now come on. We better trade that purple sticker for some real bandages or Clint is never going to let you live it down.”
And with a perfectly valid reason. After using up the very last of his battery-powered heart – “That’s not how it works, Steve, my heart is perfectly ‘me’ powered,” he heard Tony’s echo reiterating for the hundredth time, but when Steve had seen the reactor dark and silent as Tony laid motionless in the middle of the buckled and thoroughly wrecked street, that had been exactly how it had felt – to carry a nuclear missile through a magic portal into an alien universe to save the planet and the billions of souls on it, any sane person would have a high probability of gaining a phobia or two.
"Sir...shall I try Ms. Potts?" - Avengers: Jarvis talking to Tony just before flyinig the missile into the portal
Steve knew that if Tony could, he’d have been blinking up at him in confusion. For now, all Tony could do was furrow his brow under the fabric. “Why?”
“That’s the part that confuses you?” Tony asked incredulously. “Not him throwing them back up again? Years later, and all still miraculously whole, by the way.”
It hurt how much he loved this man who was ripping his heart to shreds with his complete and utter selflessness and still managing to feel ashamed for it.
Steve eventually let his head fall back to rest in the grass, his hand not cradling Tony’s head falling back into its rhythm of gently rubbing circles into his back.
“Yeah, it’s a sight to see. All the decorations, the...the lights.” He’d attended a festival some years back and it really had been beautiful with all the lanterns designed to look like the Milky Way was flowing through every side street. It truly was stunning.
Steve continued to watch him through his second go-around until Tony, mission obviously not yet accomplished, did the same to the fridge, the oven, the dishwasher…the garbage?
Tony closed his eyes, teeth painfully digging into his bottom lip for only a moment before he leaned up to kiss Steve’s temple, somehow managing to keep the steady contact despite both their trembling, and Steve trying to wrap his chin around Tony’s neck in a desperate attempt keep him there as best he could, as Tony embraced him one more time.
He took a few steps to continue on his way, stopping only once to again turn back with an authoritative, “Carry on,” before finally disappearing into the hall.
It suddenly dawned on Tony that he had gone to the hospital to visit a Make-a-Wish kid who he had made a prosthetic for. Apparently his wish had been to build something with Iron Man (and how that had touched a part of Tony he wasn’t sure he was ready to deal with yet) so he’d made seventy percent of the arm and helped the kid, Miles, assemble it and add in a repulsor replica that shot out nurf-like darts with suction cups at the end. That most certainly would not have been uneventful.
Tony jerked back to awareness, a scream on his lips and the sound of the Hulk’s roar still reverberating through his skull. His lips were wide open and gasping in….
He gave his head a good shake for that. No. He’d come this far, he was not backing out now. For better or worse, this was happening. Tony deserved to at least be given the chance to fight to gain a little piece of himself back, and Steve was determined to help him through every swing.
“Goddess of the hunt,” Steve supplied quickly, followed by a sheepish squeeze to Tony, “I um...I know that one.”
He must have shivered because only seconds later, the jacket he still had in his vice grip shifted again. Panic made another annoying comeback at having it taken from him but it dissipated once he realized it wasn’t being taken, rather it was twisted before he was suddenly engulfed in its sheltering warmth. He wasted no time in pulling the jacket up and over his head until he felt buried in it.
Steve felt Tony take a deep, albeit shaky, breath, and it only broke him further because he knew Tony was steeling himself for what was coming next. “No…” Steve muttered as cold finality seeped into his veins, his muscles all but going numb with the icy spread. “Please, no…”
The doors opened and Tony stepped out, following JARVIS's instructions to the Band-Aids that had found their way to a drawer and pulled them out. Sure enough, the box had an action image of Clint in full garb, an arrow pulled taught in his bow, and the image of the bandage showed they were decorated with purple H’s and a few arrows thrown in for design.
“Hey! That’s hardly the point! That little pest can now withstand a good five Hulk hits. The real and only noteworthy point here,” he hissed at JARVIS, “is that he better be damn near thrilled.”
“I could…” He took another steadying breath. He could do this. For Steve, for his mother, he could do this. “I’ll show you then. If you want.”
Steve pressed his lips to Tony's lightly. Then again. And again, until they stopped separating and basked in the feeling of the other, the warmth, the concern, the intimacy.
Another gust of wind breezed past and it only reminded him of how under-clothed he was. Where was his jacket? He could have sworn he’d been wearing one. Steve had said something about him throwing off his jacket. Stupid.
“I love you,” Tony whispered into Steve’s hair, pressing one final kiss to seal in his words. “I’m so sorry.”
Steve had felt like an absolute heel when Rhodey had had to painstakingly spell it out for him, something that should have been – and was, now that he objectively looked back, god he was an idiot – exceedingly obvious.
If Steve hadn’t known Tony as well as he did, he wouldn’t have understood the slight shift in him as the relieved sigh that it was. “Well, that will all depend on whose side you’re on.”
Steve hummed as they once again fell into silence, his eyes scanning the stars above him. There were so many now above him that he wasn't sure he could point out the three stars he knew to be Orion’s belt but he looked anyway, trying to follow the designs Tony was tracing into his chest.
It was definitely going to bruise. And that was saying nothing for the cut on the knuckle that had caught on the jackass’s teeth. The others were already an angry red, but no doubt by tomorrow they’d be a beautiful collage of purple, black, and yellow. Shit.
“Your thumb,” Happy repeated from the front seat, glancing back at Tony in the rearview mirror. He held up his hand in a fist, thumb outside along the other fingers. “You left it out, right?”
“Tony.” Steve’s hands came up on either side of Tony’s face, gently tilting it up until their eyes met. “I..” He leaned forward to press a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “..am very…” his cheek, “...proud…” his nose, “of you.”
His hand went to his chest but couldn’t feel anything, his fingers numb and aching and malfunctioning and…..where was it? It has to be there. He needs it. Where is it?!
“Is it, now?” Steve said with a fond smile as he looked behind him to gauge how much further he needed to guide Tony to the spot he’d pre-designated. He was relieved to see the blanket and basket already set up exactly as he’d asked the owner of the nearby facility to do so only a few more yards away.
He felt Steve try to stand and Tony did the only thing he could think of to keep this night from ending like this. He took Steve’s hand in a firm grip and pulled until Steve was seated again, and then further still until he was on his back, which was when Tony proceeded to place himself in his favorite cuddling position with his head resting on Steve’s chest, ear just over his heart so he could hear the strong pumping rhythm deep within - all while managing to keep Steve’s jacket pulled over his head.
Tony’s shoulders lowered in a sudden disappointed slump, but when Steve looked to his face for any reason as to why, he found none. Huh.
“Yes I would.” Steve knew it was a lie, even before he hissed the words through his teeth, but he had to try. He had to stop this--
“Wow,” Steve intoned quietly after a bit of silence, almost afraid to break the moment. “That’s incredible.”
Turning back once again to the TV, he was met with a commercial for dog food, which wasn’t at all stimulating enough to distract him from the crazy that was going on behind him.
But he was fighting it. Breathing deep, letting Steve’s warmth keep him grounded, reminding him that he was safe in these arms that had kept their promise to always catch him when he fell.
He couldn’t let them down. His team needed him. He couldn’t let them down now, after everything they’d been through to get here. There had been so much pain already, so many hardships, so much grief. Though that had nothing on the fact that he hadn't seen Tony in awhile and that always sent him careening into panic without fail, to say nothing of that the last he’d seen him, Tony had been pissed as hell at the entire situation. And, genius though he may be, that was when he tended to make his most idiotic decisions, effectively shortening Steve’s life expectancy by the decade in sheer trepidation.
“Well,” Steve placed his glass down solemnly, “it can be hard sometimes, spending time with a child who’s sick.”
A dark shape making a quick movement in the corner of his eye was enough to spark his reflexes as his head swiveled….to find Tony at the wall beside the couch, seemingly correcting the angle of a hanging picture.
Tony smiled at the jealously miffed tone, mocking expression and all. He supposed he had been ignoring a few spots of training here and there, trading the close combat sparring for agility training with Thor, target practice with Clint and a few well-built bots, and strategy simulation exercises with Natasha and Steve. All of it in the suit. “I guess there is something to be said about getting back to the basics once in a while.”
When he didn’t feel Tony’s hands move from their places on his waist and neck, Steve looked back down at Tony. Whose eyeline hadn’t left Steve’s face.
Of all the stories she’d told, this one had always held him captivated, no matter how old he was, no matter how many times he had heard it before. From the moment she started the story until even a while after they had been silently staring at the skies, basking in the shared closeness, she’d always held him just a little bit tighter, her voice taken on a wistful tone that had made Tony want to believe that magic and love were real. And her eyes would always be just a little bit brighter, a touch more alive than he had ever seen them before.
And felt he cushion beside him shift and move. Steve almost didn’t want to look, too afraid of what oddity his apparently insane boyfriend was partaking in now, but his curiosity got the better of him and he slowly turned his gaze to see the Tony Stark…fluffing and rearranging couch cushions.
Tony rarely spoke so candidly, even less so about anything to do with his family, and Steve desperately wanted it to continue. But he also knew that Tony would only talk as long as he was willing and not a second more. Pushing would get him nowhere fast.
“What?” Steve asked hastily, eyes wide and instinctively looking for injury. “What, did I hurt you?”
When Steve thinks back on this evening, he will be forever amazed to think that all it took – from removing the blindfold and kissing Tony, holding him in his arms, to now – had happened in the span of mere seconds. Seconds, apparently, were all they would be allowed before this beautiful moment was all so painfully shattered.
“Yeah.” The look on his face when his dad put his hand on his shoulder. “It’s always the good ones.”
Fast forward a few years and one supper serum later, and Steve found he could eat pretty much anything he damn well pleased without so much as getting a stomachache. He’d been too wrapped up in the war to really pay that much mind at first, but after the ice, he’d taken the time to explore his options. Sushi, Kimchi, Philly-cheese steak, pizza with every topping under the sun. He hadn’t really put much energy into the sweeter side of it, until one fateful day when he’d had his eyes opened to his unbeknownst love of dark chocolate.
Tony could have - and did, if he was being honest with himself - fallen in love with Steve all over again for the non-committal hum he offered, leaving the decision to divulge any further completely in Tony’s hands, demanding nothing of him and patiently waiting for Tony to make up his mind on the matter.
“No, not… We could go to Japan. For the festival. Or China, I haven’t seen that one. I mean I’ve been to China, but I haven’t been there during the
He almost forgot how much it stung. It had been a while since he had punched someone outside of the armor. It's no picnic.
“If it helps, there is a box of Hawkeye themed Band-Aids in the kitchen drawer. I believe Mr. Barton left them some days ago.”
No. Stop. It’s too tight. Too tight. He can’t breathe. It hurts, his chest hurts, his throat hurts but he couldn’t feel anything else. Everything was numb, so why the hell did it all hurt so much?
Steve hummed in affirmation. “Once, when I was sick. I don’t know if I can remember them all, it’s been so long, but...um, I think I remember one about Perseus. Didn’t he….yeah, he used Medusa’s head to kill the sea monster and rescue….oh what was her name … An … An-something?”
“I found you,” Tony sighed, sounding just as relieved as Steve felt. He wasted no time in getting his arms around Steve as best he could, given the restraints, with one arm wrapping around his waist while his other hand went to the back of Steve’s neck to hold him against his chest.
“Oh. Yeah, he um...he’s a good kid. Smart. Funny.” Tony could still picture the look on his face when he held his newly assembled arm with such pride and joy. And how it fell when his dad had entered the room. “He’s got a bright future ahead of him if he can pull through.”
“Good,” Steve cut off Tony’s rambling. “Good, that’s great. Okay, so...get me out of these things. We’ll fill in the others and get your plan going.” He turned his gaze up to his restrained wrists above his head expectedly, deciding he could take a moment to marvel at the beauty of Tony’s strength in the suit. It never failed to spark something heated and intense to watch those hands that could be so gentle when touching Steve’s skin do something so powerful when--
Steve’s fingers twitched. He’d packed his sketch pad and a few pencils because he knew Tony liked to watch him create and he’d thought it might serve as a nice distraction if needed. They were in the basket just there on the blanket only a few feet away. He needed to get to them,  preserve this memory, document it, keep it safe. So many things had faded from his memory already. He couldn’t allow this to be another.
“Ahh..” Tony hissed and jerked forward from the counter where his hand had started to pinch between the counter and his body.
And how was Tony supposed to argue when Steve used such sap-tastic ammo against him? He had never considered himself a particularly sentimental person, most especially in regards to relationships, but when Steve went and said things like that, how was he not expected to feel his chest swell with all things good and warm and terrifyingly idealistic?
Steve felt Tony smile against him. His fingers distractedly began to draw out a pattern along Steve’s clavicle. “The man who slayed the beast and saved the beautiful maiden, Andromeda,” Tony iterated with something of an epic tone in his voice. “Yeah, Mom liked that one.” There was a moment of silence before he added, “You know the whole reason Andromeda was even strung up for Cetus to eat was because Cassiopeia, her mother, was too vain. And with the sacrifice of her daughter unfulfilled, Cassiopeia’s punishment was to be hung upside-down in the stars. Apparently a very unflattering position.”
Steve’s hands went to grasp Tony’s hips out of reflex, but once he got his bearings and stopped wondering what the hell was happening (because who the fuck cares?!), he pushed back into the kiss with just as much ferocity as Tony was giving. Tony certainly was the better kisser out of the two, but Steve was no slouch in this area and he was more than happy to prove it.
Steve returned his, now suspicious narrow-eyed, gaze back to Tony whose expression had gone from simply curious to insistent.
Even when they were fighting, Steve would do something - leave a sketch of DUM-E or Butterfingers for Tony to find in the shop, have Happy deliver an oddly shaped pez dispenser he’d found during his most recent thrift shop adventure - to make sure that Tony smiled as often as he deserved.
Steve had never been much for sweets. Partly because he’d never really been able to afford any as a kid, but also it was a bit of a danger to his health. Simple sugars never really seemed to agree with him much. He’d learned that lesson after he and Bucky had spent the better part of two weeks saving up what they could from odd jobs around the neighborhood, then pooled their earnings together to buy the biggest pack of gummy bears they could find. They’d proceeded to sprint home, break open the bag, and gorged on them ever so slowly, savoring each tough, chewy morsel.
Steve felt a sudden rush of panic and before he knew it, his hands were around Tony’s wrists. “Wait!”
Tony couldn’t stand the matching defeated tone to Steve’s words. Steve should never sound like that, especially when he was insinuating that Tony could ever feel anything less than unequivocally safe with him, which was just so very far from the truth.
Steve’s enthusiasm slowly melted away as he rolled his eyes. Tony apparently got the hint that Steve was no longer participating and backed off with a loud pop and a lip lick that could only be described as obscene to catch any of the chocolate that had found its way there. The sight was almost enough to have Steve diving back in, but his exasperation at the fact that one of the best kisses –quite possibly the best kiss – they had ever shared only happened because Tony was too eccentric to simply ask for a piece of Steve’s chocolate like a normal human being won out.
“Rhodey put you up to this?” Tony asked, nearly tossing off the jacket in his surprise before remembering what was on the other side of it and tightened his grip, pulling it all the closer as he focused on keeping his breath in it’s newly acquired normal rhythm.
And now, hearing the fruits of his labors put in so many words, that Tony trusted him enough to not even let it be a question anymore, made Steve want to pull him in and kiss every syllable as they slipped from Tony’s lips. He only hoped he wasn’t testing that new founded unequivocal trust beyond its limits with what he was about to do.
Tony looked down at his hand. He hadn’t removed the glove yet. He’d told himself he’d been waiting for the cold draft from when he’d entered the car to clear away, but by this point he was about to start sweating. They still had a few minutes before they were home.
“You wouldn’t be the only one.” Tony took the hand that had been caressing his cheek and held it in his own against Steve’s chest. It was another moment before his face lit up when an idea came to him. “We could go.”
Steve’s fingers moved in a caress along his cheek, letting Tony’s beard lightly scratch at the backs of his knuckles.
“Yeah, well. If you’d give up whatever idea you have in that scheming head of yours and let me take this damn thing off,” Tony made a vague gesture toward the fabric covering his eyes, “we wouldn’t have to worry about all that, now would we?”
He heard the others crying out as they fought, as they were hit, as they struggled, as they tried not to die.
Steve chuckled and pressed another kiss to Tony’s brow. “And you weren’t kidding when you called it tragic. It’s a beautiful story but...once a year? That’s terrible.”
They stood staring at each other for a solid several seconds before Steve’s face dropped into something resembling displeasure and Tony steeled himself for what would come next.
The rebuff went ignored as the hand on the back of his neck came up, the plates of the gauntlet sliding away so there was nothing but warm skin to touch his cheek. “I don’t expect you to be okay with it,” Tony said in a reverent voice as he watched his own fingers trace Steve’s face. “I certainly wouldn’t be. In fact, we both know I’d be downright furious, you ever tried to pull anything like this,” he added with reserved chuckle. “But...I’m the one who has the say this time, so--”
"You know that's a one-way trip." - Avengers: Steve talking to Tony about going through the portal with the missile
But he just continued on, needing Tony to hear this and believe it unconditionally. “Just listen. Please. I need you to trust me and know that I will always be here for you, and I will never, ever let you fall. Alright?”
Tony couldn’t help but melt into it, letting his shoulders ease until he was pliable under Steve’s hands, his thoughts fuzzy and formless. For a moment it was perfect. A moment that seemed-
How could his best friend do that to him? He’d seen first hand how much he’d been affected by “The Incident” - as people seemed in favor of calling it, like not calling it what is was, a fucking alien invasion, was going to make it seem any less horrible.
The soldier’s hands moved up Tony’s back to pull him in more, one going right to the engineer’s neck in a possessive hold that he knew Tony loved, earning a deep moan for his efforts.
Even the sound of the repulsors firing at full strength to carry Tony through the skies was not enough to drown out Steve’s screams as he was left helplessly watching his very heart fly away where he couldn’t follow.
