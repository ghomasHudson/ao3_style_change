Inexplicably, John felt his own features mirroring Sherlock's as he moved towards the bed. He wasn't even put off by the IV drip that was inserted into Sherlock's arm.
John looked down to his hand to see that what he had taken from Mycroft was an envelope addressed to him in a recognisable, messy scrawl. The scrawl of his best friend, the world’s one and only consulting detective.
John couldn't see anything of interest where Sherlock was pointing, but he heard a small gasp of understanding from where he knew Liz was standing. "Of course!" she moved forwards to where Sherlock was stood and looked at the patch of ground he was gesturing to. John followed.
John’s head snapped back to his friend. He walked quickly over to him, placing one hand on each shoulder, locking his eye with those piercing blu-green eyes. Sherlock flinched at the touch, but he didn’t pull away, allowing John to keep a firm grip on him.
“I’ll do nothing of the sort,” breathed Sherlock, purely for John’s benefit. John was glad to have more reasons to laugh and smile than cry these days.
"Lestrade told me all about Anderson's, quite frankly, ridiculous theories as to how I survived the fall." He huffed out a small laugh. "Odd, I always thought that he and Donovan would be the first to pop the champagne corks at the news of my death."
Leaving Mary would be hard, especially with the baby on the way, and there would be days when he probably regretted it, but John knew that it was for the best. It was his only chance a being happy with the man he loved.
"For someone who hates repetition, you've said my name an awful lot during this conversation. Now, what is option two?"
Then Sherlock had sacrificed everything, a life for a life. He stayed silent and still on the pavement, even though John’s frantic pleas to let him through were killing him to hear.
After a few days of being cooped up together in the flat, the two of them decided they needed some fresh air. Sherlock had dashed into his room and come out wearing something completely ‘un-Sherlock’. He was wearing a pair of faded denim jeans, ripped at the knees and had obviously been loved once as they looked well worn. A dark, brown jumper covered his torso and he pulled a beige coloured beanie down over his curls. He placed a pair of rounded glasses on his face and turned towards the doctor. If John didn’t know it was Sherlock, he would have mistaken him for a uni student, at least 10 tears younger than his actual age. No-one would recognise him, unless the were about 3 inches from his face and looking incredibly hard.
John took a few moments, still perched on the edge of his own bed, the sound of Sherlock playing the violin still travelling up the stairs. The air seemed to stir around him at the sound, as if the flat was waking up around him at the sound of the familiar strings, stretching it’s walls as it recognised the return of it’s detective. John ran his hands through his short, grey-blonde hair – an action that he seemed to be repeating a lot recently. He let out a sigh of resignation and pushed himself off the bed and towards the door.
John could practically hear the cogs whirring in Sherlock’s brain as he regarded Sergeant Carter, and he longed to hear what deductions Sherlock had made about this woman that made him smirk like that.
“Because he needs me.” Said John, the smile still etched on his face. He looked fondly at the woman who he’s never had time for, except those Christmas and New Year parties. He’d always meant to talk to her, but in all honesty, they were both so involved with Sherlock that they had little time for anyone else.
Silently, he thrust his hand out the John, who automatically took it from him. After a curt nod, and another worried glance at his little brother before exiting the room once more and leaving the detective and his blogger alone.
John returned to the flat with Mary to find Sherlock sat at his desk in the living room. A laptop - probably John’s – was open in front of him, and he was completely engrossed in whatever he was reading. John did not bother to password protect his laptop anymore, not since moving in with Sherlock, who could always guess them in under a minute. Both he and Mary removed their coats and hung them up on the hooks just behind the door. Sherlock did not turn to look at them, but chose instead to carry on reading whatever it was that was in front of him.
Sherlock turned to look at John, this eyes scanning his face, deducing. John swallowed, is throat suddenly parched. Hi gulped down some of his tea in an effort to make talking, swallowing and breathing easier.
Sherlock had always seemed a little reserved around Mary. John was sure it was just Sherlock disliking the change that had occurred during his time away. John had moved on, and Sherlock needed to accept this. He was never rude to Mary, which was a relief. John knew how cutting Sherlock could be with his deductions about people, but he seemed to hold back anything he was reading from her.
It had been 2 months since he watched his best friend, Sherlock Holmes, fall, or jump – John wasn't sure which word to use in the context.
“Not your fault,” Sherlock managed to croak and John slumped next to him so they were sat shoulder to shoulder, hip to hip. “You’ve been attending to other, more important matters.” Sherlock’s hands seemed to snake their way up into his dark curls again and clutched at them, almost tearing them from his skull This seemed to snap John out of whatever daze he’d been in.
Lestrade had arranged everything, made sure there was a statement released about Sherlock’s return and scheduled a press conference for the next day. They knew it would make the headlines, and this time, Sherlock wanted to make sure the facts were correct, and they were addressing sensible, mildly intelligent people – as intelligent as you could get whilst working in the media, how tedious, thought Sherlock. He did not want a repetition of what had happened with that Kitty Riley woman.
But John didn't do any of these things. His reaction took Sherlock, and himself, completely by surprise. He ran to the younger man and threw his arms around him. Tears began to spill from his eyes and fell onto Sherlock's shirt.
John, sensing that Sherlock needed to be alone, made a silent exit form the site of the grave. He didn't go too far, far enough for Sherlock to have his privacy, but not so far that Sherlock was out of his eye sight.
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he watched the movement of John’s finger. His mind whirled as he assigned letters and words to the tapping. Helpfully, John repeated his tapping.
John could see the spark in the detective's eye, he could see the consideration of Moriarty's request. John refused to let Sherlock back down. They had a plan, and John intended to stick to it. Some part of John's brain knew that he and Sherlock had to pull off a convincing performance, and maybe Sherlock's reaction was part of the act, but a larger portion of his brain was taken back to the last time he had been in proximity to this rooftop, several years ago, watching from below, helpless. He couldn't watch it, not again. Not ever again.
Greg only made it a few steps into the room before stopping short at the sight that lay before him. He could have cried, not only at the sight of John lying there, alive and breathing, but at the image of Sherlock, slumped next to him, hands clasped firmly around John’s, sleeping more peacefully for probably the first time since this whole ordeal began, comforted by the continual warmth that was John Watson, reassuring him, even in sleep, that he was really here.
John couldn’t remember a time when he’d felt more lost. Well, he could – stood at the foot of St Barts, watching as the blood pooled around a set of dark curls. But this was different. Now there was no magic trick, and Mary would not be coming back.
"I've never had friends. Why on earth would I have friends?" He spat the word out as if it tasted sour in his mouth.
Bees seemed particularly attracted to the yellow petals, and three or four flew lazily from one flower to the next as they collected pollen and nectar from their precious findings.
Greg was stunned into silence. Sherlock was leaving the flat? And he couldn't even pick up his bloody phone?
Greg had drained the last of his pint before clapping John once on the shoulder, it was probably supposed to be reassuring. It wasn't. Greg left him there.
“Sherlock,” John began, a wide grin now spreading across his face, “you are such an idiot.” His voice was so full of fondness and tenderness that Sherlock found it impossible to take offence. “I was in the army Sherlock, I know Morse code.”
“So, Lestrade, are you convinced that I’m right, or do you wish a repeat of what happened a few months ago. Please do think carefully, I detest repetition.”
John gasped in great gulps of air as he tried to calm himself after the cabbie's most recent death glare.
Greg turned his attention to Mycroft. Usually, their interactions were kept at a minimum, their only common concern being Sherlock.
Serbia. He hadn’t waited for backup. He’d bee shot. Hence the hospital and the pain killers. Shot twice, John prayed he’d never reach the lucky number three. Hopefully his new wound hadn’t got infected and left such a large scar as the one on his shoulder.
John was loathe to admit it, but 221B had always been home and probably always would be. Even when he had moved in with Mary, he had always felt a strange loyalty to the flat - although, he'd never admitted it to her.
Thanks to all of their combined efforts, the day went surprisingly well - despite the attempted murder. Mary had looked absolutely beautiful in her dress, John had a very hard time keeping his eyes off of her. He had never been prouder. Sherlock's speech was actually very good, despite everyone's predictions. He was funny, charming, and even sweet in places. And he had managed to solve a murder at the same time. Once again, John was amazed at his best friend's capabilities. Now, John had a wife, and a baby on the way.
Sherlock was so easily disarmed by Mrs Hudson’s voice. It had such a motherly tone to it, a quality his own mother had never possessed. She smelled faintly of flowers, mixed with the smell of baking and tea. It was a comforting smell to Sherlock, he associated it with being home, being safe and loved. She was his real mother, in many ways. She kept him out of trouble when he first moved in, and no matter how pleading, or angry, or sulky or even rude he had been to her, she had never given him what he wanted. She helped him kick the addiction more than that damn rehab centre ever had, and for that, he owed her his life.
“Oh, this is about Mary’s tumour.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed as he obviously connected two points in his brain.
In her eyes, he was her boy. She had a pathological need to take care of him. When he bought John around, that first day, she could see what a difference it had made in him. It was like a school-boy bringing home his friend for play time. And ever since then, Sherlock had looked so much happier.
“How pleasant it must be to be able to remember.” The words were spat, with such venom that John stopped smiling and the hair on the back of his neck stood up. The stare that Sherlock was giving him now was not analytical. It was cold, harsh, and full of contempt and loathing. “How wonderful it must be for you to be able to remember exactly what happened to you last week, or last year, or during the past five years.” Sherlock stood in one fluid movement and began to pace up and down the flat. His eyes were searing with a kind of fury that John had only ever seen once, sat by a fireplace in an inn on Dartmoor, after Sherlock’s first encounter with the hound. “How extraordinary it must feel to not have had five years pass without you remembering. How special you must feel to be able to remember who I am when I don’t even know you. How terribly amusing.”
I could do could bring them back. But it bought a minuscule amount of satisfaction from him being punished for his actions. So I started to take clients, to help others who had gone through the same thing. That's why I stay detached from cases, John. If I get too emotionally involved, it reminds me too much of her. And the Yarders don't know, and I couldn't bare them to know, because I don't want their
“Sherlock!” Both men were laughing now, which was a welcome change from having the two of them crying, John thought.
“Not important? John, the man’s killed three people! Where’s Sherlock? Put him on the phone and maybe I can talk some sense into-”
“John, it’s fine. I can see when I’m not needed.” She stood up and made her way out of the flat, pausing to kiss Sherlock and John on each of their cheeks and hugging them tightly before she left. “It was a wonderful meal John, thank you,” she spoke into his ear as she wraped her arms around the shorter man.
Without taking his eyes off of his sleeping friend, Sherlock replied, “If it’s all the same to you Mrs Hudson, I’ll get changed, but I won’t be sleeping. I want to be here when John wakes up.” Mrs Hudson gave his shoulder another squeeze, to show she understood. Sherlock rose from his seat and turned to Mrs Hudson. There was only a moments pause, filled only with the sound of John’s heavy, sleepy breathing, before Sherlock stooped down and enveloped Mrs Hudson in his arms. She wrapped hers around his back and hugged him back just as tight. From somewhere just above her right ear, she heard Sherlock whisper.
“John, if you really were – are,” he corrected himself, “my friend, then you’ll know that I cannot stand repetition.” Yes, John was fully aware of that. The irony of that was, that Sherlock repeated this reminder at almost every opportunity.
"There's no obvious damage to be found," Mycroft began, standing behind John, but obviously addressing the both of them. Sherlock turned to look up at his brother. John continued to focus on Sherlock's reactions. Considering what happened earlier, it was important to keep an eye on how Sherlock reacted. "They were going to continue to keep you here, but I managed to
He wrapped his arms around Mary, holding onto her as tightly as she was holding him. He vowed, just as Sherlock had done - God, his vow, it meant so much more now that John understood why he had made it - to protect Mary and their child with everything he had. How would take are of them always, and allow no harm to ever come to them.
The realisation caused tears to spring to his eyes, and he covered his mouth with his free hand to cover a sob. How could he have been so blind? How could he have ever wanted anything more than the brilliant, extraordinary man who he had the pleasure to call his best friend? John thought of his life with Mary, and felt nothing. He pictured his life with Sherlock, if they were partners in every sense of the word.
"Blow to the back of the head and amnesia actually count as traumatic experience, especially in my book, and especially when it comes to you. I'm
"Jesus, Sherlock!" He reached out and grabbed the taller man's shoulders, holding him in place as he scanned the rest of him, making sure that there was nothing else wrong. Sherlock's eyes never left John's face, and only after their eyes locked for a few seconds, did John let go of Sherlock. He realised that this might have made Sherlock uncomfortable. "God, I'm sorry! I'll just…" he trailed off. Sherlock continued to watch John as he clumsily settled himself back into his armchair.
“There’s no need to apologise to me, John. I’m sorry too. I probably said some things I shouldn’t have.”
"Sherlock collapsed and his at Charing Cross," John explained to Lestrade, who was still looking at John with wide-eyed panic. "He's conscious and still being obnoxious as ever, which I'm taking as a good sign." Greg sighed in obvious relief. "Anyway, his highness is demanding my immediate presence and has promised a slow and painful death if I..." John trailed off.
Sherlock turned his head, staring at the white linoleum hospital flooring. He could see Mycroft in his peripheral vision, hovering worriedly at the edge of the room. At the accusation, he visibly stiffened, all colour drained from his face and he looked – dare Sherlock say it? – utterly terrified. Sherlock watched as Mycroft closed his eyes and breathed in deeply, preparing himself for what he was about to reveal.
‘What if he doesn’t turn up? What if he’s left me again? What if his taxi crashed? Or his cabbie was yet another homicidal psychopath? What if, what if, what if?’
Okay guys! Thank for reading this and staying with me! Just a note to say that I've now begun work on another fanfiction with my very good friend Jennie! It's called 'Whatever remains, must be truth...' and I'd love it if you guys could check it out! The username is '2penstopaper'. Thanks guys! xxx
It wasn't fine, not really. But seeing how he couldn't even handle his own emotions, he didn't want to be dealing with a distraught Molly as well.
"Everyone at the Yard's read it John! I sent the link to my sister Mary. We love to talk about it when we meet up. We love it. We're a particularly fond of 'A Study In Pink.'"
His eyes flew open. It was now dark outside of the windows of Baker Street, meaning that Sherlock had been thinking for over 5 hours. It was so easy to get caught up in his own thoughts. Sometimes a whole day would pass and he wouldn’t notice.
John considered going after him, but was not sure that the action would be appreciated, especially after hearing what happened the previous time and then told in no uncertain terms that he was never to bring the subject up again. However, John felt that someone should be keeping an eye on Sherlock, and who better than Big Brother himself. John’s lips quirked into a smile reminiscent of Sherlock’s as he internally praised himself for his excellent Orwell reference.
He stood at the foot of the stairs, doing nothing, just staring at them. His feet felt as if they were made of lead, which Sherlock knew to be impossible, and yet he did nothing to stop a thought like that to rush through his mind.
She’d shouted, she said some things that she regretted, mostly about John always prioritising Sherlock before his own wife, resulting in her completely breaking down into sobs. The tears didn’t seem to ever stop. But John understood. She felt like he was abandoning her, choosing Sherlock over her, always Sherlock. And part of him knew that she was right. Mary was always right. Not in the same way as Sherlock, but she was always right, right about John. She knew how their relationship worked, and she knew that John would not rest until Sherlock was better, even if that meant leaving her behind yet again.
"Not incredibly creative, or clever, but they were merely the muscle required for the operation whilst the mind behind this was sat comfortably behind a desk-"
He opened his eyes and looked around the flat. He spent so much time repeating this action it was a miracle he hadn't gone mad. John hadn't moved a thing in the flat. Everything was exactly how they had left it on the day he lost Sherlock.
John visited Sherlock the following morning at 221B before his flight to Antigua for his honeymoon. Sherlock was in his pyjamas and blue silk dressing gown.
Sherlock frowned, his eyebrows pinching together. Warm? Solid? He continued to run his hand up along John's arm. The feeling of warmth and solidity never faded.
"He's still stable. The anaesthesia should have worn off by now so he's just resting. He'll wake up when he's ready. When he does we'll remove the tube and let him breathe for himself." The nurse was proficient, and her explanations were to the point. Mycroft thanked her and she exited the room.
There were no visitors on the third day, apart from Mary, who came in before heading off to work. She’s ruffled Sherlock’s hair gently and kissed John before leaving. John did not do anything that day. He just existed. He did not talk to Sherlock as the others had done, the idea seemed ridiculous. Besides, what on earth would he say? Sherlock would know that John wanted him to wake up, he didn’t need to be told, and anything else John would want to say would be irrelevant.
On his way here, Sherlock had been deep in thought. He knew he needed to do something. He hated the way John seemed to be avoiding him, yet at the same time following him. This was an entirely one-sided game of cat and mouse where John played both the cat and mouse, and Sherlock didn’t like it. He wanted things back the way they used to be, but he knew that there was no chance of that happening.
Molly hit him over the arm again, although not as forcefully, just a playful tap, as if to remind him what she was capable of and snap him out of his current mood.
Mary’s hand were wrapped tightly around his as they sat in the consultant’s office. Her eyes were watering, but she somehow managed to stay strong. Whatever it is that she was doing, she was doing it better than John was. He couldn’t bring himself to look at the consultant, and only a few words were registered. He wanted to block them all out, to deny everything that was happening, because it couldn’t be happening. Not to him. Not to Sherlock.
“Okay.” John took a deep breath, trying not to let Sherlock get to him again. “I may have lost my temper a little the last time I was at the flat.”
“Sherlock, John, meet Sergeant Annalese Carter. Carter, this is Sherlock Holmes and his colleague, Doctor Watson.”
John had unconsciously moved up, out of his chair n into the kitchen, ending up stood in front of Sherlock, who was just turning back to the living room having just completed the washing of the mugs.
Sherlock was frozen in his chair, unable to comprehend. The sacrifice John had just offered. It hurt. Picturing a scenario where that was necessary hurt. And it was in this moment that Sherlock glimpsed a tiny fraction of what John had experienced when he had faked his fall.
He climbed out of bed and reached for his clothes. He dressed slowly, the disappointed feeling in his stomach was still festering. He knew it was silly to be disappointed, but it wasn't something he could control. It wasn't the only thing he couldn't control lately.
It was completely different from when John had sat here waiting for Sherlock to return from hospital after the accident. Then, John had felt a leaden weight in his stomach, convinced that nothing he did would help Sherlock in the slightest.
“I didn’t know it would be this hard – coming back. I always assumed that we would slip back into the routine. I thought I would solve cases, he would blog, and we would all drink tea.” He said, taking a sip of his own. “But I didn’t know, I didn’t anticipate just how much damage my leaving had caused John. I want to make this as easy as possible for him. I’d been thinking about it ever since I came back, and today I’d only just settled on a solution. I thought I needed to leave. A clean break, so John could move on with his life. I restrict that so much but just being present. I wanted to get out of the flat, so we planned a walk. I didn’t want to be recognised, hence this,” he gestured towards the uncomfortable disguise, “absolutely appalling outfit. So we took separate taxis. But John’s anxiety obviously built up more than I knew because even that brief separation caused him to have a panic attack.” His speech had become rushed, garbled. He felt that stirring inside him… sentiment.
Mary was glad for the visits. Obviously she loved having John there all the time – a comforting constant in a world that was spiraling out of control – but she enjoyed hearing about the lives of others. John guessed that it was to take her mind off of the fact that she didn't really have a life anymore.
Anthea walked with purpose straight into the hospital. John followed her past the reception and into a lift which took them up to the floor where Sherlock's room was located. For once, John did not care that he was in a hospital. He just needed to get to Sherlock. He did not stop when Anthea stayed behind in the lift. He continued down the corridor in front of him until he met Mycroft, who appeared to be waiting for him. With a curt nod, Mycroft opened the door.
They had agreed not to take on any cases – private or through the Yard – until they had settled back into normality. Sherlock had never liked being patient. For him it was an unnecessary characteristic, waiting infuriated him. He needed something, anything to distract his mind. Only John was the exception. Sherlock knew that John needed the time, needed him to have patience, to just wait, and help. John was the only exception to a lot of things.
“Doctor Watson. Please do come in.” The was no welcome in Mycroft’s voice. It was an instruction rather than an invitation. John followed Mycroft through the door into what could only be Mycroft’s private study. He had a desk at the opposite end of the room, but unlike the desk John shared with Sherlock, everything was neat and tidy. All papers were stacked up in organised piles. Pens were in line with each other, and everything was set out at right angles and straight lines. It made John uncomfortable and scruffy.
It was with these thoughts that stepped fully into the room, pulling up a chair on the opposite side of the bed to Sherlock and proceeded to wait for one, or both of them to wake up.
His memories were there. They were there, still tucked up in his mind palace, struggling to get out. The waltz had clearly triggered something that had allowed these small pieces of information to infiltrate through the fog, and bloom into Sherlock’s mind like the most beautiful flower in existence. Where Sherlock felt rage at being unable to remember anything else, John felt euphoria that something was coming back to him. Granted, none of it had lead to the uncovering of John’s identity in Sherlock’s mind, but it was something. A very good something.
As he did so, a harsh laugh echoed through the walls of his mind palace, surrounding Sherlock. It was manic, taunting, utterly gleeful and frighteningly familiar. It continued to echo until there was no other noise save the laughter. It sent chills down Sherlock's spine until his whole body was shaking as he curled further in on himself, hands grabbing his hair, pulling and twisting until it was nearly ripped out of his imaginary skull.
Each of the rooms in his mind palace were actual places, rooms he had visited and constructed in his mind. There was his bedroom from the hous he grew up in, filled with memories and data about his childhood. There was Lestrade's office, where he stored new cases until he could construct a new room for them. It was extensive, exquisite, a true masterpiece.
“He looked like a lost goldfish with his mouth open like that! He looked unable to form a coherent thought!”
John kissed her hand, and finally Mary turned to face him. She’d looked so healthy the other day, not she looked drained. Maybe it was just John’s mind trying to find something physically wrong with her before he could accept the truth of the situation. Honestly, John just thought the diagnosis had drained the life from them both. The spark that once used to dance behind Mary’s eyes had disappeared. No smile graced her face, and her whole aura just seemed to flatten.
Except it hadn’t. Because Sherlock hadn’t really died that day. But it didn’t stop the pain John felt as he finally turned to look up at the hospital. He had believed, after all, that he watched his friend jump to his death. He had believed that he would never see Sherlock again, and that had hurt. As he looked to the roof, the place where it had happened, John’s eyes began to burn. He quickly turned away. Both men had spent too much time crying recently, and as Sherlock had pointed out to him on many occasions, crying wasn’t going to solve the problem, or make anything better.
John's heart hurt. His gut twisted at the noises coming from his friend, from what he was saying. John had always wondered why Sherlock had turned to drugs. Sherlock had always insinuated that it was to dull his mind and streamline his thoughts. The truth was even worse than the lies.
A few nights after the incident with the smiling, John announced he had a date. A date with a woman. Stupid, of course it would be with a woman. For some reason, this made Sherlock incredibly uncomfortable and angry. But Sherlock couldn’t pinpoint the problem. Why should John going on a date cause him to be so… irrational? John brought the woman, Stephanie or Sophie – something like that – up to the flat to introduce her to Sherlock before they left for dinner.
John deposited his bag in the doorway and moved to the window. He stood there, just staring out of it. If he were Sherlock, he would pick up the violin and play an utterly heart-wrenching piece of music to show how he was feeling. If he were Mrs Hudson, he would insist on talking to someone about it. If he were Harry, he would drink his problems away. But he was not any of these people. He was John Watson, and John Watson didn’t have a clue what to do.
John reached inside his coat pocket and dialed the number for Mycroft. He swore under his breath as he did so. It pained him to resort to this.
“Mycroft, Sherlock’s gone. He ran off at about 3 this morning and I’ve been looking for him ever since. I can’t find him Mycroft he could be anywhere with anyone doing anything and all because I didn’t think to follow him straight away and he could be in danger and…” His words were all melting together because he was talking so fast. He knew he needed to calm down, but since when was anything to do with Sherlock ‘calm’?
The voice sounded distant and faint, as if Sherlock was listening to it through a layer of water. As soon as the image had appeared, it vanished. He tried desperately to cling to it. He had these flashes occasionally, and no matter how hard he tried he could never hold onto them for a significant amount of time.
"Exactly,” replied Lestrade, finally choosing to look at John. “You know, I asked him once - after he'd done it three or four times - what he was looking for."
Molly’s shoulders slumped in relief, and a tiny smile graced her features. This was wiped away soon, as she regarded Mycroft worriedly.
"Here. Here is the exact spot." He exclaimed, pointing to a spot on the pavement and moving the focus to the road, and then back again.
His long was caught in the breeze. As it blew around him, he kept his chin tucked into his scarf, it was quite cold on this particular day. At least his hair wasn’t getting in the way. He removed one of his hands from the pocket of his coat and swept it through his – now shorter – curls. It felt god to have them back to their normal length. His lips curved into the smallest smile as he replaced his hand in his pocket.
"There is every point!" Molly's voice was loud, angry, and a little hurt. She shot him one last look of desperation before turning to help the others in their task. They all continued to push and shove at the door. Sherlock continued to watch them from his huddle on the floor.
John supposed he had every right to do so after everything he’d been through. His best friend had (albeit temporarily) forgotten his existence, he’d watched his wife struggle through a brutal fight with cancer only to lose her at the end, and their lives had once again been poisoned with the presence of the infamous consulting criminal, whom John was quite happy to see die at the hand of the same best friend who’d suffered amnesia but after an encounter with Moriarty and a short stay in hospital, regained his memories.
"Sorry, I just- It's nothing." Sherlock physically turned from him, looking out towards the window. John new it was no good trying to pursue the issues. There's only so many times Sherlock would allow John dominance in their conversation. He decided to let the conversation drop.
It was there, in Lestrade’s office, at the start of a new case, as he watched his best friend work, that John Watson felt truly happy for the first time in months.
He walked in with such total confidence that it looked like he could have been the soul owner of the flat, and they (the actual owners and inhabitants) were merely an irritation to him. It was only Sherlock who noticed the lack of spring in Mycrofts step, and the slight sag of his shoulders. Mrs Hudson jumped as she saw the eldest Holmes brother and John put his arm around her shoulder to calm her down. She waved him away, muttering about her own silliness. John was not having any of it.
He felt nothing but self-loathing. He wanted to tear his own skin off, wanted to disappear. He wasn’t worthy of John’s care and attentions.
John could feel his arms and legs, also a good sign. He tried to flex his fingers, but could only manage a tiny movement. The was a warmth wrapped around on of his hands, with something light and fluffy tickling an area just above his hand on his wrist. The grip on his hands tightened after the miniscule movement of his fingers, and the tickly, fluffy thing vanished. Unfortunately John couldn’t identify it without opening his eyes.
“I can’t. I can’t remember anything else.” He grabbed the closest item to him – one of John’s mugs that had been left on the mantelpiece above the fireplace – and threw it across the room. It missed John by inches, smashing into a hundred pieces against the wall to John’s right, but John didn’t even flinch, he was too focused on what Sherlock had just told him.
Sherlock made no attempt to follow it. He made no attempt to move at all. He made no attempt to stop the intense pain in his head. And he made no attempt to prevent the dark oblivion from once again taking him from the world as he slipped from reality.
There was a moments pause, where John and Sherlock exchanged glances. "Tea would be lovely, Mrs Hudson. Our flat?"
And with that, Sherlock began to tell John exactly what had been happening from the moment he woke up in the hospital.
"Something amusing, Dr Watson?" He was stood behind the desk, at which Sherlock was currently situated, occupying the black, leather office chair that accompanied it.
The encounter in the cab had shaken Sherlock, that much was obvious. The colour from his face had gone, and John had noticed a slight trembling in Sherlock's hands as he told Mycroft and John exactly what had occurred in the cab, with no detail left out. Sherlock had been directing his tale mainly at Mycroft, which made sense as he was the only one in the room who could do anything to Moriarty whilst at the same time remaining inside the boundaries set in place by the British laws. Sherlock wasn't an idiot. He knew exactly what thought's were going through John's mind at that precise moment.
“I should get started on that dinner if I were you. Mrs Hudson detests lateness and delay, and we did promise her a 5 star service after all.”
But more importantly, Sherlock had relapsed. It made John want to punch a wall, want to punch Sherlock. But no. He didn’t. He wanted to hold Sherlock and never let him go, even just to save him from his own mind.
"Call me Liz," she introduced. "Now, if we don't get a move on soon Mr Holmes, we shall loose the light of the sun, which will not only make everything a pain to see without torches, but it will also be quite cold, and these overalls aren't incredibly good at keeping you warm." She shot a quick glance at John, who had to stifle his laughter again – why were all the good ones married?.
“My apologies for not visiting sooner Mrs Watson, it was fully my intention to visit as soon as I heard the awful news, and I’m deeply sorry. However, I wasn’t sure of whether or not I’d be welcome.” He was polite as ever. Git. How was John supposed to stay mad at him now? John could feel Sherlock’s gaze on him, and when he looked up at Sherlock, John caught a flash of blue-green. But John blinked, and Sherlock had turned his attentions to Mary.
It's true that John may have landed a one or two (or four or five) punches on Sherlock over the years, but they had always been forgiven. It wasn't as if Sherlock was the most tolerable person in the world, so he instantly forgave John for every wrong. IT had been harder for John to forgive Sherlock, but there's a difference between a punch and pretending you're dead for two years.
"You're quite sure he'll make a full recovery?" Mycroft trusted medical professionals, of course, but he needed to be absolutely sure.
There was a murmuring on the other side of the line, and then Mycroft returned."He was seen on CCTV getting into a cab outside St Bartholomew's hosptial at 10.13pm. He was travelling for 10 minutes in the direction of Baker Street, but before reaching there, the cab stopped, Sherlock got out and confronted the driver, who then proceeded to drive away, leaving Sherlock there on the pavement. From the CCTV footage, he collapsed shortly afterwards. Two young ladies found him who, luckily, happen to be nurses who were returning home after their shifts at Charing Cross. They called an ambulance and have been with him ever since."
There was a trail of unexplainable warmth down Sherlock's cheeks as he screwed his eyes even more tightly shut. It was becoming more difficult to breathe. Air entered into his lungs in great gasps. The trail of warmth, Sherlock realised, were his own tears. He wasn't just crying, he was sobbing. His chest felt like is was trapped in a giant vice, and every time he tried to take another gasping breath it was pulled tighter. It was not in his mind, it was a physical pain. His stomach rolled and cramped as another sob wracked through his body. He wrapped his arms around himself. His head dropped so he was completely curled in.
Mycroft sighed. Clearly it was going to take a while for his plan to become effective. It was unlikely that Sherlock was ever going to come around anytime soon, and Lestrade was going to need time. But it was their best hope. The Inspector was a reasonable man, and if anyone could bring Sherlock to forgive his brother, it would be Greg. But it looked like there was a long road ahead.
John turned with military precision and did, what he'd come to know as, the hardest thing he'd ever have to do.
"You're one to talk." John let out a rush of air that could have been a laugh, but wasn't quite. His lips quirked into a smile, but instantly fell back into the sad expression that had been the default since he returned to Baker Street. "You never held any regard for personal space during the while time I knew you." Sherlock's eyes narrowed and his face furrowed into that familiar frown that triggered a thousand different memories in John's mind. It pained John to the point where he believed to to be physical pain, that Sherlock could not share this with him. Sherlock's head turned slightly to the side, so he was now eying John from the corner of his eyes as he had done with so many previous clients
By the time Sherlock returned to Baker Street, John was already packing. He was leaving Baker Street to go and take care of Mary. She was refusing to stay in the hospital. She said the bed could be given to someone in more need than her. She wanted to spend her last few months at home. John would have rather died a thousand times over than see any harm come to Mary. But the universe did not care what John Watson would rather have.
“Do you really think we haven’t already taken every single course of action Dr Watson? We have searched every street in the city, gone through every tape from the past week and there has been nothing. He has been taken from right under our very noses and there’s not been a single trace we have be able to find to track him. So you honestly think I would have let this pass me?  Just given it to my brother for him to play around with so he would get bored? This is the British government John and I’ll be damned if you think I am not taking every precaution and available measure to ensure we find him!” Mycroft raised his voice during his outburst. His face was flushing, but after a minute he composed himself and adopted an aloof expression – the default for Mycroft - as if John was beneath him. Sherlock almost pointed out to him, that John was a much better man than Mycroft, but held his tongue, reminded of something. Sherlock was instantly taken back to his childhood.
As she turned, her hair rustled ever so gently, and it looked like water shimmering  in a gentle stream on a spring afternoon. Everything about this woman seemed to scream elegant and professional
.’ Jason, he knew what I was thinking, he knew. And I know I sound crazy right now, but I promise that its true.”
“Doctor Watson, Sherlock and I are similar in the respect that we both detest repetition. It is a waste of time and I am sure you heard me the first time.” He rolled his eyes at John. “Yes, I envied you. You changed Sherlock for the better, something I had been striving to achieve for years and yet you seemed to accomplish it within a week short weeks, possibly even days. You made him happy, you were the only one who ever could and probably ever will.”
The silence was more relaxed on the journey home. One thing for certain was that John’s panic attack had left him exhausted. His breathing was getting heavier and slower as he sat in the back of the taxi with Sherlock. Sherlock could see John struggling to stay awake out of the corner of his eye, but he didn’t mention it. A comment from Sherlock was probably the last thing John needed right now. Their surroundings were growing darker as the late afternoon moved into evening.
As it turned out, Mycroft needed no summons. Whenever Greg visited Sherlock, he would often find Mycroft sat in Sherlock's armchair, but never John's. Sherlock did not allow anyone to sit in John's chair, ever. He wasn't eating, that much was obvious.
"I'm sure you are aware that I do not take kindly to strangers poking their noses into my business."
John felt a wave of jealousy run through him. He longed to be happy, to laugh with friends. But he couldn't. It was impossible.
Mycroft sat himself behind his desk, as John seated himself in the comfortable (he hated to admit it to himself, but it was – Sherlock’s distaste of all things Mycroft related seemed to be rubbing off on him) chair opposite the desk. Under Mycroft’s scrutinising eye, John felt like he was back in school, about to be reprimanded by his headmaster.
John didn’t move, and was sure that even if he wanted to, he wouldn’t have been able. Mycroft’s word seemed to have frozen him where he stood, just staring. Mycroft let out a rather loud, irritated sigh. “Shock is not becoming of you Doctor Watson, and I’d seriously suggest closing your mouth before you choke on the amount of flies you will inevitably catch if you continue to do so.” And with that, Mycroft dropped his hand back to his side, giving John a chance to collect himself and reflect on what had just been said to him.
“Wrong,” Sherlock cut in. “You’re men are mediocre at best. You need an expert.” Sherlock shot a glance at John, his eyes pleading with him. John gave a sigh, giving in to resignation. He closed his eyes and nodded in the general direction of Lestrade and Sherlock.
She stayed with John for the rest of the day. At about 4pm, John began to feel confined, so he popped out to get some air into his lungs, and Mary watched over Sherlock again. John returned and before he stepped into the ward, he saw Mary leaned on Sherlock’s bed. She’d pulled her chair right up close and her head was laid on her folded arms. Her mouth was moving, talking to him, and John opened the door slightly to hear what she was saying.
“Unfortunately yes, sneered Sergeant Carter – Annalese – “now if you’ll excuse me I have something to discuss with Sergeant Donovan.” She promptly pushed past the men and exited the room, leaving the three men in silence behind her.
It was the only thought rushing through John’s panicked brain as he combed the streets of London. It had already been 3 hours and there had still been no sign of Sherlock. He’d promised himself, for the sake of Sherlock’s dignity as well as his own, to not get Mycroft involved, but now it was getting ridiculous. It was no longer dark as dawn had begun to break at about 5am, just a sliver of light along the horizon. But now, London’s skies were streaked with reds, oranges and pinks, the blue of the daytime beginning to weave it’s way through the other colours to gain it’s dominance in the sky.
He released John’s hand, and exited the flat, leaving John to watch the edge of his coat whip around the corner from the open door. John closed it and returned to Mary. He wanted to ask what Mary had spoken about with Sherlock, but when he moved into the living room, he fond Mary curled up on the sofa, fast asleep.
But sometimes they creep up on you, and there's nothing. You can do about it. Sometimes they limp into your life, offer their phone and never leave. They take your breath away, they dull the noise, they make you're heart skip a beat.
John continued to visit Mary’s grave. It was still hard for him to accept that she was gone. He spoke aloud to the gravestone sometimes – it helped him cope, and if he looked mad for doing so, well, John didn’t care.
Sherlock paused. “I know,” he finally replied, “I know.” He did know, she’d proven very useful when he wanted to when he needed to…
The consultant looked quite panicked, and John only returned to his chair when he felt Mary’s hand on his shoulder, guiding him down. Mary was in control, providing the stability John needed as his world came crashing down around him.
"He was incredibly lucky, a few centimetres to the right and we would probably have lost him. Many people have it a lot worse."
did you figure that out? What is the coffee stains on my sleeves from the type of coffee you can only get in the hospital? Can you see the lack of sleep I’ve been getting recently, and the creases on my shirt that show I have been sleeping in the chair beside a hospital bed that my wife occupies?” John’s eyes flashed, and Sherlock took the smallest step backwards. He knew that John was not one to be messed with today.
The taxi pulled up and John got out, paid the fee and ran. Ran only a few metres before stopping and turning, looking in earnest for any sign of his best friend. He couldn’t see him, he wasn’t there. He could feel the panic rising in him, feel his heightened anxiety taking hold. It seemed as if I vice was squeezing around his chest, he couldn’t breathe. He opened his mouth to scream Sherlock’s name. But he remembered that they were supposed to be on the down low. He was helpless. He turned again and again on the same spot, searching frantically for any signs of Sherlock. Tears began to spill over and roll down his face as he became more desperate. He gasped in large quantities of air, but it didn’t seem to make any difference. The passers by were watching him with looks of concern, some even looked panicked. John’s mind was going fuzzy, his vision was blurring over.
The John he saw was alive - just. He was obviously unconscious, but breathing. A monitor to the side of him helpfully tracked his pulse in irritatingly high-pitched beeps that jumped at a constant rhythm, but the rhythm was slower than it should have been. There were several tubes protruding from him. One was coming from a bag of muddy-red coloured liquid - a blood transfusion. One was a clear coloured with a machine attached so you were able to adjust the dosage if they needed to - some sort of pain relief, probably morphine. And one tube was inserted into his mouth and most probably down his airways to help him breathe. He was deathly pale, nearly as pale as Sherlock himself, which was no mean feat. His eyes were closed, and judging by the dark circles beneath them it was the first time they had been in a very long time. He was so much thinner, looking even more like a corpse than the image of him broken and bleeding at the foot of the hospital. He was wearing the standard issue hospital gown, but Sherlock could clearly make out the bandages underneath, wrapped around his chest. He was covered in the faded blue, green and yellow of old bruises, all of varying size, and there were several scars along his arms that John didn't have which were a sign of recent combat, self defence perhaps.
They laughed, just like they had before, back when they'd return to Baker Street after a case and share a moment of sheer absurdity together in the hallway. They laughed until John could feel tears pricking at his eyes. Having decided that he'd cried enough for a lifetime and remembering that he was a British man, and crying was simply not done in favour of a healthy dose of tea and denial, he turned away to try to rid himself of the excess moisture.
It had been over five months since John had died. Three weeks ago Sherlock had locked himself in 221B and had not emerged at all. Not even for a case.
Jealousy, possessiveness, increased heart rate, constant thoughts about John, smiling because of John, the things he said, what he’s done, the swooping sensation in his stomach…
He was now faced with three choices. One – he stays at 221B and prolongs this torture until it sorts itself out. Two – He and John sit down again and have a real conversation about the possible solutions to the problem. This was likely to be an awkward conversation as Sherlock knew that the majority of the blame rested on him. Three – He leave Baker Street, leave John, leave London. He releases John from the stresses of their life together and allows him to move on with his life. Sherlock considered all three options carefully. He had just settled on one as the cab pulled up. He got out and moved into the park. He waited there for John, deciding on how he was going to approach this. It would be painful, messy. But it would be better for John in the long-term. Sherlock closed his eyes and began to imagine how the conversation would take shape.
He reached over the bed to take one of the ex-army doctor’s hands in his newly bandaged ones. As he enclosed it in his hold, he bought John’s hand up to his forehead as he rested his elbows on the edge of the bed. He squeezed his eyes tightly shut against the tears that had been threatening to spill over the entire exchange with Mycroft finally slipped gracefully over two well defined and sculptured cheekbones.
“Sherlock, we’re not doubting you, no-one here is.” John glared at Lestrade and Anderson as he spoke. Sherlock’s eyes were still tightly closed as he focused on John’s words. John knew exactly what was happening in Sherlock’s head. His mind palace had turned into a rooftop, Sherlock was stood on the edge. “Sherlock, it’s okay. The past is the past. Moriarty is dead and he’s never coming back.”
“Sergeant Carter, I’m warning you,” started Greg, moving between her and Sherlock, creating a physical barrier. John took a step towards Sherlock, ready to pull him from the room if Carter became more aggravated, which, in all honestly, was very probable.
It was incredibly unhealthy, and Greg had been trying for months to get him out of the flat but to no avail. Every time he tried to reach Sherlock on his mobile, it rang straight through to voicemail. Clearly Sherlock hadn't bothered charging his phoned.
Sherlock's head snapped up. His eyes locked with Liz and they shared a look. Sherlock looked utterly amazed and, quite frankly, struck-dumb, a concept that had never to this day been applicable to Sherlock Holmes. The moment would have lasted longer, had John not cleared his throat to make introductions.
More often than not when Greg visited, he was curled up on the sofa with his back to the world, either asleep or in that ridiculous mind palace of his.
Hey guys! Sorry this chapter took so long! I have been suffering with the well know ailment that is WRITER'S BLOCK! Anyway, this isn't as good as my last chapter, so forgive me, I blame the WRITER'S BLOCK!
And Sherlock went and protected him. Sherlock hadn’t been able to look at him when he explained this. It was a good thing. John had felt sure he was going to explode with happiness, regret, shame, pride and a million other different emotions. He was touched, no more than that. He couldn’t find the right word to describe the feeling, but now was not the time to go looking for it in the dictionary that Sherlock kept on top of the bookshelf.
The plan had been simple. Lestrade would talk, explaining the situation, Sherlock would fill in the blanks, and then there would be a time for questions from the journalists. John was unsure of his purpose. He’d asked Lestrade if his presence was actually necessary, but Sherlock profusely refused to continue if John was not with him. It seemed that Sherlock still had something to prove to the army doctor, despite the resolve of their problems a few nights before.
"I don't know how or why," Sherlock cut him off, determined to have his say. "But I do know this. Your full name is John Hamish Watson. You hate your middle name yet willingly gave it up as a possible baby name for The Woman and I. Really, John? Me and Irene Adler? We solve crimes, you blog about it and I forget my pants. Your favourite colour is a deep, mossy green because it reminds you of outdoors. Your favourite flavour of jam is raspberry and we currently have three jars of it at home. Your favourite film is that ridiculous Bond film, Casino Royale, which you forced me to watch because 'it's your bloody heritage and you will enjoy it' whilst stuffing me full of Thai food from the takeaway a few streets away. You dislike how I talk to clients, you think it's a bit not good. You think I'm rude, obnoxious, arrogant and yet I am still your best friend, as you are mine. I was the best man at your wedding where we prevented the murder of Major Sholto. You don't just solve the case, you save the life as you've saved mine so many times. And even now you continue to do so."
John’s head was spinning. His mouth was dry and his breathing had become shallow and quick. He needed to see Sherlock. Now. He needed to see with his own two eyes that the world’s only consulting detective was alive. He asked his cabbie of they could go any faster, passing off his anxieties as a frantic dash to a family emergency.
John gave up with trying to get Sherlock to stop interrupting. The consulting detective pretty much did whatever he wanted in any situation, so why should John try to change things now? He looked back down at his tea and laughed quietly to himself, shaking his head slightly. Sherlock watched all of John’s movements. He was very fond of that smile, the way he would tuck his chin to his body and let out a small laugh. It was one of the many things about John that he was fond of, and it made Sherlock smile to know that he was the one responsible.
They sat opposite each other at the dining table, sharing fond looks and reaching over to join hands as they ate their toast. There was a mutual understanding between them. John showered and dressed quickly, as there was a taxi picking him up at 11am to take him to Baker Street. He picked up his bag, which until then had been poised in the hallway, beckoning to John to get on with the task at hand.
Of course, John stayed in Baker Street. It was illogical for him to be in any other place – as Sherlock pointed out to him on more than one occasion. There were arguments, nights where tempers had risen so high that both men saw red and something nearly always got broken. But a unrequested cup of tea, or a newspaper cut-out of a particularly interesting looking case in each other’s direction the following morning usually put things right.
Sherlock’s voice was barely more than a whisper. However, the other noise being the whirring and beeping of the machines that John was currently relying on, Mycroft had no problems hearing the words as they travelled across the room to reach him. He had not turned his gaze from the pale, unconscious figure on the bed.
“Details?” Asked Sherlock as all three of them began walking towards Lestrade’s office. They walked quickly, falling into an easy rhythm down the corridor; no-one met them on their way.
Sherlock's voice was not harsh. It was not a command to return from his thoughts to the present. It was not said with a force to demand he turn his attentions away from his fantasies. No. It was gentler, guiding. It provided a calm reminder to John that whilst it was very pleasant to lock himself away in his mind, it would be better if he focused on the here and now. It was this that bought John back to the hospital room.
“My phone had a voicemail on it. And I didn’t want to open it but I had to, I just knew who it was and what it was. That voicemail were the last words he said to me.”
The trembling in Sherlock's hands spread like ice up his arms, through his shoulders and down his spine, until his whole body was shivering as if he'd spent the whole day in the Arctic conditions of London in winter without his beloved Belstaff coat.
Mrs Hudson answered the door almost immediately. Evidently she had been waiting for the boys to return. She took one look at John and gasped, clearly getting the wrong end of what was a very long stick.
He held out his hand to me and I shook it. His hand was warm, despite the cold, and soft, like worn leather. He let go and walked away, but just before he got around the corner, he turned back and waved.”
Sherlock considered this. His first assumption was that John was medically interested in Sherlock’s injuries. But with further thought, he realised it was sentiment. John cared about Sherlock, and wanted to make sure he was okay, despite the fact that Sherlock had just waltzed back into his life, potentially messing John up mentally. Yet Sherlock’s safety and well-being was still the most important thing on John’s mind. A strange sensation swept through Sherlock, the same sensation he felt as he stood atop St Barts.
It was three weeks before John saw Sherlock again. It wasn’t for the normal, predictable reasons of John leaving something at the flat or just accidentally bumping into each other on a day out. No. This meeting was quite out of the ordinary.
His medical license must surely be in question here. He was a bloody doctor. Clearly John had been so self consumed that he'd failed to make Sherlock take care of himself. He felt awful and the guilt clawed at his stomach, making it twist uncomfortably.
This could be it, the beginning of Sherlock’s memory returning. But he mustn’t get his hopes up yet. This was a start – a good start – the best. But baby steps.
"You want to know," she repeated. Sherlock's hatred for repetition had rubbed off on John, who tried not to voice this.
John was now stood up, shaking. His whole body was tense and his face was flushed with colour. He was ready to explode, to scream every insult he new at the walking dead-man that stood before him. He wanted to throw every item he could get his hands on at that face, with his stupid cheekbones and permanently smug smirk. He wanted to beat the man within an inch of his life to show him how much pain he had felt over the past two months. He didn't care what that Adler woman said, the teeth and nose were the first ones that would get hit.
He could feel the tiny fractures spreading throughout his body, a physical and an emotional pain coursing through his veins, over his skin, throughout his entire being. He felt as if his chest was being squeezed, struggling for air. He gasped in as much air as he could, but his lungs burned with every mouthful, and each breath out became a heartbroken sob. Tears streamed down his face, burning trails of heat over his cheekbones. He stumbled forwards, trying to steady himself on the arm of the sofa, eventually giving up and just siding to the floor. His hands wove themselves into his curls, tugging painfully; trying to ground himself amidst all of this emotional pain he was experiencing.
A small chuckle escaped the man in the bed, a wince of pain following. John chucked himself, but sobered at Sherlock’s pain. He let go of Sherlock’s face and began to run his hands through the luxurious, practically sinful curls on the detective’s head. A small, tired, yet happy smile broke free on John’s face as he gazed down at the man he loved, who was valiantly trying to fight off sleep.
"Piss off, Mycroft." Josh was not interested in dealing with the eldest Holmes right now. He would much rather be dealing with the younger. God, what John wouldn't give to hear Sherlock complain about how bored he was. "My task was to disarm Alvarez. He's not going to bother you anymore now, is he?"
Sherlock closed his eyes to cope with the onslaught of fear, panic and desperate, relentless sadness at the idea of John placing himself between a bullet and Sherlock. There were no tears, just quick, shallow breaths as he tried to maintain on the right side of hysteria.
They’d stood there, neither moving. They must have been there, in silence for a while, because John heard movement from behind him. He tore his gaze away from Sherlock’s to see Mary making her way down the hallway.
Sherlock did not look as if he had registered a single word she had said. In truth, he hadn't. His hand still rested on John's solid arm. Sherlock had never been able to touch John in his dreams, he'd always vanish before he could. And heat was a sensation his mind was never able to replicate in his subconscious.
“I was scared Sherlock. You left without any warning, then out of the blue you turned up on the door-step without even giving me a clue that you were still alive.”
Sherlock could hear Jason snort on the other end of the phone, the sound made Sherlock’s lurk quirk up in a quasi-smile, before succumbing to his memories.
John had felt a rush of affection for his wife, who once again had been thinking of him, and only him. They’d walked through the streets of London until they ended up in a park.
When the simple verse was over, the laughter started up once more. What was happening? Why was his own mind torturing him like this?
John knew that if he and Sherlock worked together, then at least one of them stood a chance of happiness in the future.
“I could see that Sherlock was going to take one of the pills,” Sherlock read aloud. He skipped several sentences. “Which is when someone shot the taxi driver.” A few more lines were skipped. “That someone could have the power of life and death over someone else - but I'm glad whoever it was did it, because they undoubtedly saved Sherlock's life. And, frankly, after everything that man had done to those innocent people who got into his car, a quick death like that was better than he deserved.”
"Yeah.” Lestrade nodded, eyes on his empty glass, refusing to meet John’s eyes, which were now staring at Greg as if he’d grown an extra head. “He'll be spouting of his usual stuff, you know, the 'deductions', and he'll turn around, like he's looking for someone. Completely stops his train of thought and he's got no bloody clue where he left off."
Sherlock finally bought himself to dial the number he had been avoiding for the past week. He knew that his absences had not been received well, but he’d needed time to process and come to terms. Despite what Jason believed, he was very in touch with his emotions, and over the past week they had been too overwhelming. But Jason deserved an answer, and an explanation.
"You're the bloody genius, you figure it out." John finished stuffing his clothes, and closed his bag. He stood there for a few moments, trying to breathe deeply and get control of his anger and frustration.
Sherlock moved to get up from the bed, probably to begin pacing again like he had been doing this morning when John woke up with an uncomfortable ache in his neck as a result of the awkward angle he'd been sleeping in. Damn the uncomfortable hospital chairs.
As the concerned nurses tugged Mycroft into the corridor, Mycroft heard his brother snarl over the requests by the doctor to calm down.
"But not my best friend. You were the only friend I had, John. And you didn't just die. You purposefully jumped to your death and you made me stand there and watch. That's how it's your fault."
Molly quickly grabbed his hand, and without a word lead him from their table, out into the street and hailed a cab, giving instructions for the cabbie to get them to Bart's as quickly as possible.
“It was a bit obvious. Your eyes followed him everywhere. You made an effort to make him smile or laugh, and if anyone ever hurt him, well, you saw to it that they got ten times worse. And I knew you loved him in some sort of way the moment you left his wedding early.”
The press conference regarding Sherlock’s return had been a total success. Everything had gone according to plan.
There had only been 2 more fits since Mary had arrived, and John hadn't moved from her side. He held tightly onto her hand and never wanted to let go. He got very little sleep, always wanting to constantly watch over Mary. If something happened to her whilst he was sleeping, unable to do anything to help her, he would never forgive himself. He thrived on coffee and adrenaline, knowing that sooner or later he was going to crash – hard. But whilst Mary needed him, his body sustained efficient energy levels so he could stay with her.
"My thoughts exactly. Whoever these men were, they weren't as clever as the one behind it all. I guarantee if we look back at the CCTV footage again we'll find out all we need to know, including the vehicle they used, now that we know the direction they were travelling."
“I can think of one individual who would possibly assist us. However, it is likely that he too will be emotionally compromised, so expect more hostility before things begin to get better, Miss Hooper.”
Sherlock’s stomach lurched and his head felt like it was splitting in two. The song was getting louder, he was surrounded by it, trapped, suffocating.
The phone rang for a few moments, before the person on the other end of the line picked up. A silvery voice spoke.
On reflection, John couldn’t understand how he didn’t realise sooner that it was Sherlock, and not Mary that he wanted to be with. No matter how many times they had gone their separate ways, John always found himself drawn back like a moth in the night, and Sherlock was a shining beacon of light.
John gently placed the paperwork from Lestrade in a neat pile on the coffee table as Sherlock flopped rather inelegantly into his chair in a dramatic flair of long limbs and expensive suit. The silence continued as John moved into the kitchen to put the kettle on.
“Yes.” She shot John a cheeky wink as she held out both of her hands. John took them and allowed her to pull him up. He wrapped his arms around her and held her tightly. She returned the hug, relaxing into John’s embrace. John kissed Mary’s head, before pulling away.
People were beginning to stare now. His face was no longer covered by his hair, and his cheekbones were exposed for all to see. This and the fact that he was wearing his signature coat and scarf, made him recognisable to anyone who’d bothered to pick up a newspaper, or tune into the news over the past 6 months. The passers-by looked as if they had seen a ghost, which in their minds, was probably true. He would speak to Lestrade or Mycroft about organising a press conference about his return. It was better to come clean, than let people come to their conclusions.
If he were conscious, or even real, he would have been in intense pain. Sherlock was relieved that this was a fantasy. He would never wish this upon his friend, and John definitely had never deserved to end up in such a state.
Sherlock considered this for a moment. There was nothing Sherlock would enjoy more than to see Mycroft try to deal with these ‘complications’. But he saw the desperation, and decided to overlook their sibling rivalry. Besides, the case did sound extremely interesting.
Sherlock considered this for a moment. “There is obviously something else troubling you. Please don’t hold it back to spare my feelings.”
Sherlock had visibly flinched. Not just a subtle change which only John could interpret, even Anderson and Donovan would have seen Sherlock flinch. His face scrunched up, eyes blinking rapidly, as though someone had just slammed a door and created an incredibly loud noise. His body tensed up completely.
His eyes travelled over the chair opposite him, the violin perched beside it, the kitchen, the microscope, and the unfinished experiments. After scanning the entire flat, his eyes rested on the wall. The face that had been sprayed there seemed to be mocking him, the bullet holes sending a new wave of pain, anger and loss through John's body.
John and Sherlock finally looked up at each other. Sherlock’s face was still set in the cool mask he wore which he used to cover his true emotions. Only 3 people had ever seen him when he lowered this mask. Molly, Mrs Hudson and John.
Lestrade was just stating the obvious now. "Yeah, he get's flashbacks sometimes. Gives him a killer headache but it's kind of reassuring." John felt guilty that this reassured him, but it was a sign that the Sherlock of those 5 years was in there, just trapped, and fighting to get out.
John and Sherlock had never been the most affectionate of friends, often choosing words or a strong handshake where others would find comfort in a hug. It was an unspoken rule between them. They simply did not do it. It seemed now that the rules had flown out of the window at the return of Sherlock's memory. His beautiful, exquisite, amazing, brilliant, fantastic mind had done it. It had overcome the largest barrier that life had ever presented to him, and John was equal parts relieved, ecstatic and proud.
Christ. Sherlock really was an idiot – despite all evidence, and self-declaration to the contrary. Sherlock had insulted, manipulated and pushed away possibly the only person willing to help Sherlock other than his brother, and Sherlock would not tolerate being in his brother’s care for any longer than necessary. John was his flatmate. Friend? Sherlock didn’t know. Sherlock had never had any ‘real’ or ‘proper’ friends, and that fact that he’d had one, but can’t remember, and was unable to keep hold of him was absolute torture. He wanted to hold on to what he had with John – or had in the past – and hold it tightly and not let go. It made him sound like a petulant toddler, but, as Mycroft, Lestrade and Mummy had so often reminded him, that was just how he acted sometimes.
“Yeah. You’re entire face is lit up. You should smile more often, it suits you.” John grinned sheepishly up at Sherlock from his armchair as he’d said this.
"I still think it's your fault," muttered Sherlock under his breath as he waited for the toast to pop up.
"What could you possibly want Mycroft that involves coming over to out flat at 10.30pm, interrupting our dinner for Mrs Hudson and offending my flat mate?" Johns head snapped towards Sherlock. So, he had registered the tension in john's body, and was reading the changes which signaled John's anger. But Sherlock could see how much this evening had meant to John. He had spent the vast majority of the day being ‘a slave to the cooker’ – a phrase Sherlock had heard but never quite understood (how can one possibly be a slave to an inanimate object with no conciseness or sense of thought, therefore unable to give commands and orders for one to obey and thus become it’s slave), until today. John had poured his heart and soul into making sure everything was perfect, and Mycroft had just ruined it.
”Sherlock cut him off immediately. In a flurry of curly hair, black coat and fury, Sherlock was on his feet, striding towards Mycroft, brining himself to his full height and looming with a great sense of malice over his older brother. Mycroft had never seen Sherlock look so angry. No, not just angry. He looked betrayed, hurt, desperate. “You knew he was out there, alone. You allowed him to get hurt, Mycroft. You’re the reason he’s in this state. Both you and Miss Hooper.”
"Yes Dr Watson, Miller." Her voice was silvery, the words slipping from her mouth as if they were silk.
The Detective Inspector raised his head, and sighed in obvious relief at the sight of the two of them. Sally followed her boss’s gaze and sent a withering look at them, clearly she had not wanted to call them in on the case, but they were out of their depth and desperate.
“Well, I can’t deny I shouted. I was so full of emotions, and it just seemed like the logical thing to do. But In the end, I didn’t do any of that. I cried and I think I nearly broke his ribs when I hugged him. I guess- I guess I was so completely shocked, and yet overwhelmingly happy to see him, alive, breathing, existing, that nothing else that I wanted to say or do mattered.”
It was situated just under the shade of a tree, a solitary protrusion from the grassy covering of the ground around it.
“I caught him within a day. Tied him up in a nice bow, attached a note and sent him straight back to London and to the Yard. Apparently, Molly had a lot of explaining to do to Lestrade when a man appeared in his office, with a note that could only have been from me saying that this was an assassin assigned to kill him. Molly’s never been good at keeping secrets. She keeps biting her lip when she’s lying so she’s easily caught out. I got a phone call the next day requesting I come straight back here and explain myself. I did. But I had to get back to work.”
“Indeed. I found Anderson’s ridiculous expression to be highly amusing,” said Sherlock, a smile spreading widely across his face.
The following morning bought about the first Sunday of the month. Sherlock rose, and donned his coat and scarf. This time though, instead of just waltzing out of the flat, he collected John's jacket, which was still on the sofa from last night - for John had slept there, wanting to still be close to Sherlock in case of another round of hysterical sobbing, but not too close so that the consulting detective felt over crowded. He held John's jacket out to him. John took it from his hands, put it on and followed Sherlock out of the flat. A car - a sleek, black, expensive looking model, and therefore obviously Mycroft's - was waiting for them just outside of the door, hovering idly at the curb whilst Sherlock took a moment to collect himself before entering.
"Truly, I am sorry, John." Sherlock's voice was barely louder than a whisper, but it didn't need to be any louder. He wasn't addressing a large audience, this was a moment shared just between the two of them. John felt the heat prickle at his eyes, and before he knew it, he was wiping the hot tears from his face.
John was really only there to be a face, he zoned out as Sherlock spoke, not wanting to relive the moment again in his mind. He focused his eyes on the folded hands in his lap, just listening to the vague noise coming from Sherlock’s direction. He occasionally saw the flash of a camera, or the blink of a lens as it caught the light, but his eyes never moved. Sometimes he would hear other voices, never clearly, just voices. It was all just noise, roaring in his ears as he kept his eyes purely on his hands, not blinking, never moving. It wasn’t until he felt the long fingers poke his ribs tat he finally looked up.
If there was anyone in the world who was entitled to a week off to catch their breath and reflect on recent events, surely there was no better candidate than John Watson.
"Charing Cross Hospital," she trilled to the driver, and the car began moving into the darkness towards the hospital and, more importantly, towards Sherlock.
“It seemed that our first anniversary came around so quickly. We promised to take the day off from work to spend with each other.”
Sorry it's been a while since the last update! Hopefully this chapter isn't too disappointing. Thank you so much for staying with me whilst this story sat dormant for a bit! As always, comments, criticisms, suggestions, requests are all welcome so please feel free to leave them! Hopefully it won't be too long before the next chapter, so hang in there guys!
John seemed blissfully unaware of both his date’s and Sherlock’s inner turmoil, and eager for the date to go well. He was just about to leave when Sherlock called out to him.
Who knows how long the two friends were sat there, Sherlock deducing, John thinking. They remained sat there in total silence for a little while longer, as Sherlock concluded his observations.
“No, I still have panic attacks when we’re separated. I’m always scared that he’ll leave me again one day, but I know he won’t…”
"I wish I could say the same for you, but I'm afraid I can't if you drug your opponent. Not in the spirit of fighting fair is is, Alvarez?"
"He'd used you as a target before John, twice before. Both occurrences nearly ended in one or both of our deaths. I can't help but feel that Moriarty will once again reach out and use you as a target, John. Only this time, if he does, I don't think we'll be able to get away so easily."
"There!" Sherlock pointed at the screen with his still gloved hand. "See? He's there walking down the road in that shot, but in the next one," he clicked the mouse to move on, "see? He's gone." Sherlock tapped in some sort of code - John was amazed at how much he knew about the system, but had learned that Sherlock didn't need telling how brilliant he was 24/7 – and the screen jumped from angle to angle, all focused on the street where the man went missing. "It appears you have a blind spot, Mycroft. John," Sherlock turned swiftly to John, nearly hitting him in the head with his own due to how close they were all leaned over to see the screen.
He stood, surprised by the strength of his imaginary body after the onslaught of pain and mental instability. Sherlock knew that had it been his real body, it would not have been able to cope, once again proving that his mind was more important than transport.
John looked back fondly at them. He pulled out his phone and quickly took a picture to immortalize the tender moment between landlady and detective.
“What do you want Mycroft? What could you possibly want that required all of this instead of just ringing me?”
John was sat on yet another extremely uncomfortable hospital chair, next to yet another figure on yet another hospital bed. He held one of Mary’s hands between both of his own, being careful not to jostle any of the needles.
And with that, Sherlock turned to rejoin Mrs Hudson and go back to Baker Street. It was not going back home. Baker Street without John was no longer home.
A nurse bustle into the room, moving efficiently past Greg as if he wasn’t even there and began to check John’s vitals, as well as adjust some of the machinery that he was plugged into. She tutted disapprovingly at the form of Sherlock lying with his head on the bed, and moved to wake him.
It was at this point, luckily for Mycroft, that two of the nurses assigned to John’s care chose to walk into the room. Upon seeing the almost feral detective attacking his brother, the both ran to restrain Sherlock whilst calling for help. Immediately two other nurses on their rounds ran through the door, closely followed by a sturdily built doctor. The nurses quickly ran to Mycroft, checking over for any major injuries and hurridly escorting him out of the room. The doctor ran to calm Sherlock down, who was still struggling against the nurses to reach his brother.
Yes, John reflected as he sat reading the comments. He had his best friend back, and now he had Mary too, Lestrade was still giving them cases, Mrs Hudson fussed and Mycroft was being his usual aloof self. The reflection of his life at the moment causes a small smile to spread across his face.
She’d reached up and wiped the tears off of John’s face, pausing as she rubbed her thumb along his cheekbone, her other hand cupped around the back of his neck, drawing them closer together. John had caught her hand and held it to his face. He smiled weakly down at her, and wrapped his free arm around her waist. He leaned forward until their foreheads were resting against each other. John had closed his eyes and breathed deeply for the first time in days, and allowed himself to forget why they were there in the first place. All that had mattered at that moment, was that John had his wife in his arms. They shared this intimacy for a few moments longer, before Mary laced her fingers through John’s and detached themselves from each other. She had lead him downstairs, and John caught a glimpse of Mrs Hudson fussing around Sherlock, who was in his thinking position, sprawled across the sofa, completely unaware of the hurt he’d caused John. He had opened one eye lazily as John and Mary entered the room. He’d looked the couple up and down once, and then closed his eye again, returning any thoughts he’d abandoned to watch John and Mary. Mrs Hudson had sent an apologetic look at the two of them. Mary had gently guided John out of the flat, and as they walked down the stairs into the hall, she’d turned and said her first words to John since she arrived at Baker Street.
“For not doubting me, and for helping me when I needed it. It was, umm, good.” Sherlock shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his yes now looking everywhere but at John.
“John,” Sherlock interrupted, holding the doctors arms with a look of caution. “You don’t need to tell them this if it makes you uncomfortable. If truth be told, listening to the description John was giving them was making Sherlock himself feel uncomfortable.
“You, you’re everywhere. In my mind palace, you’re in every room. I see you’re face everywhere, and yet I still can’t place you. It’s infuriating.” Sherlock slammed John’s laptop shut, and stormed out of the living room in the direction of his bedroom. This was confirmed when John hear the heavy slam of a door just beyond the kitchen. John hadn’t moved a muscle, hands still planted on the chair and desk, which was lucky, because he didn’t think his legs would have been able to support him at this point.
John hung up and left the building, just as the rest of his team moved in to deal with the mess John had left behind. He collected his minimal belongings from the safe house, and made his way to the airport. He had an appointment in Romania. As the vehicle Mycroft had sent took him to the airport, John closed his eyes and allowed himself to hope that maybe this time would be the last time, and soon he'd be able to return to his best mate.
“I’m the best chance of solving this case, Annalese and you know it.” Sherlock threw his comments over his shoulder, never taking his gaze from the evidence wall, eyes dancing over all the paper and photographs attached to the usually bare, grey wall.
The force behind the Detective Inspector’s punch threw him into the nearest wall. Cupping his chin, Mycroft winced as the pain registered. He was mildly impressed by the hidden strength of Lestrade.
When John Watson was a patient, he tolerated hospitals. He saw the necessity of their existence, and appreciated the care given to him when he was admitted. Even if he was bored out of his mind, and it always had the strong smell of cleaning fluids and people which very often gave him a headache, he was grateful that he was there.
“Let’s get one thing straight.” Sherlock purred, his voice so low that if the room had not been so silent he would never have been heard. “Do you really think that I would have willingly left John if I had known how much it would have hurt him? Do you all honestly think that the only thing I care about is myself? Maybe you should re-read your notes. I was prepared to die for this man, and I hunted down the assassins who threatened his life. When I was given news about John I was told he was doing well and moving on with his life. I was lied to, and if I knew what was really happening to John do you not think that I would have returned home much sooner? John’s descriptions of everything are admirably accurate. To see the way I was hurting this man, it was worse than torture. All I ever wanted was to keep him safe, as he keeps me safe, and I failed, I’m ashamed to admit it, but I failed. I felt burned to the core, dirty. Leaving John was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I have no intention to ever do it again. Do you understand?” The words hung in the air. Every syllable of this last statement was individually formed on Sherlock’s lips, each having a life of their own, and their own emphasis. It was clearly having the intended effect.
Lestrade’s expression hardened, a look of fierce determination on his features as he shook his head.
Sherlock left this statement hanging in the air, as if it was on a fishing line, and he was waiting for John to take the bait. He wasn't disappointed.
Lestrade drained his glass again, then turned his attention fully to John. "Not a clue,” he answered, shaking his head. His expression turned thoughtful, and then he averted his eye, choosing to look at his feet as he continued, “but if I have to put money on it, I'd bet my entire salary that it was you."
“Yes, I’m here Sherlock.” Sherlock turned to look at him, eyes still trying to focus. But when they did, Sherlock still looked weary and cautious of him. And that had been the moment where John had realised. “oh God, please no.” He began to shake, and the tears were spilling fast over his cheeks, leaving hot, salty trails down his face. He had clasped his hands together, as if in prayer and pressed his forehead against them with as much force as he could manage, trying desperately to cling onto his sanity. He had begun to rock backwards and forwards in his chair, crying out, “no, please, no,” over and over again as he did. He was removed by one of the nurses and placed in a separate room whilst the other doctors had attended to Sherlock.
"Yeah." What was the point in denying it? If Mary didn't want to tell him, she wouldn't. But if she was willing to… Well, John wasn't going to deny it.
. Sherlock recalled the last few hours, where he’d opened up to John, and how humiliated and vulnerable he’d felt after doing so.
Sherlock didn’t know what to do. He’d been experiencing this too much recently and it made him uncomfortable. Sherlock always liked to be in control, but now he wait relying on John to direct him. And John wasn’t doing well enough for him.
John noticed that they were all crying, except himself and Sherlock – who had come. Mary would have hated it. She would have wanted people to be happy.
After stating at John a moment longer, Mycroft fished his phone out of the pocket of his immaculate jacket.
John had lost a great many things waiting for Sherlock, the most important and most painful loss had been Mary. But that made John more determined to hang on to what he had left, and what he ha left was Sherlock.
Sherlock knew what Molly was doing. The blanket, the tea, the looking at him with a certain amount of cautiousness that meant she thought he was going to have another breakdown at any second.
"You did what needed to be done, Sherlock. It might not have been the 'right thing', but it needed to be done. We're safe now."
“That’s because I love you, you daft sod!” She laughed lightly. John noticed how her smile seemed to light up her whole face. He had always love that about her.
This has been my most read fic, my most liked fic, and I've had such an overwhelming response to it.
Apparently she’s been showing the signs for months. She’s experienced the severe headaches, which she’d just passed off as migraines due to stress bought on by work. The drowsiness, the nausea, the vomiting. Mary had even confessed that she’d been finding it harder and harder to concentrate on anything for lengthy periods of time, and that she’d had a few stumbles on her walks to and from work.
He listened to Sherlock pay, the long, high-pitched notes reverberated around the entirety of the flat. John marvelled at how Sherlock move effortlessly from one piece of music to another without a pause in-between. It took the breath out of his lungs to hear so many beautiful notes all stringed together like that. Sherlock truly was a genius.
When John Watson was a doctor, he liked hospitals. They were incredibly well equipped with some of the best technology for medical care. They were sterile, preventing the risk of mass spread of disease. They allowed him to work, to do what he did best, to fix people.
“No,” Mary’s voice was soft. John turned his head to see what was happening. Mary was no longer on the sofa. Instead, she was no stood in front of Sherlock, one hand on his cheek, her thumb smoothing over his cheekbone. “He still is, Sherlock. And I think he always will be, no matter what happens. You just need to trust him. Your mind is trying to fight back, let John help.” She patted his cheek, and moved away.
It was only another stay in the hospital and several months away from Mary that Sherlock finally managed to convince John to forgive his wife. She could make John happy, John loved her, she loved John and they were expecting a child together. And now Mary could also provide John with adventure and the sense of danger that he had so obviously been missing before. They were perfectly suited to each other, and Sherlock was redundant. The couple reunited at Christmas, which was horribly cliché, but if it made John happy, Sherlock was not going to complain. What he was going to complain about would be the pitying looks both his mother and father gave him every time he was within a close proximity of the former army doctor. Of course they knew, Sherlock could not hide anything from them, he had never been able to. His parents meant well, he knew that, which is why he still felt slightly guilty about drugging their punch, but he had important business to attend to.
Sherlock was dressed in a suit – as always. Black trousers, black jacket and a tight, white shirt underneath. His hair looked perfect, for there was no other word to describe it. The curls seemed to have a life of their own, curling this way and that. But it was just so… Sherlock.
Mycroft was cut off by the fist that had connected with his jaw. Having already been punched several times already this evening as a result of his deception, Mycroft should really have seen it coming. But he did nothing to prevent the attack.
He finally placed his violin down and listened. He couldn’t hear anything from the room above, for John was in a deep, dreamless sleep thanks to Sherlock’s unbelievable music talents – John’s words, not Sherlock’s. He checked his watch, 6am.
“No, I’m sorry the name isn’t familiar.” Another wave of disappointment flooded over John. “I’m calling because we have your wife, Mary Watson here with us. She collapsed this morning at work and was bought here as soon as possible. We’ve been running tests and should get the results of them soon. We’ll explain more thoroughly when you get here, I’m afraid she’s still unconscious, but we thought it would be best to contact you and you can be here when she wakes up.”
They were in the master room of his mind palace, one that replicated a grand entrance to a stately home he'd visited on his first official case with NSY. It was the first room he'd taken considerable time and effort to construct. Until that point, the rooms in his palace were all identical, professional, only used to store information. After the completion of the entry, he'd spent months creating the other rooms, until his mind palace had been fully constructed. The ceiling of the entry was high, higher than any other room in his palace, and large enough to harbour any new data until he could sort it away, or construct a new room.
He heard the door behind him opening, and looked around to see Mrs Hudson arrive with handfuls of shopping bags.
“Is this Doctor Watson?” John frowned at the unfamiliar, female voice, and he could not help a sense of disappointment settle over him as he realized this was not Mycroft. He realized that the question warranted answering, and he finally connected the parts in his brain that allowed him to do so.
“Does Mycroft have an inability to figure out the use of a mobile phone?” He rolled his eyes. “Seriously, why does he have to go through all the bloody dramatics? A quick text would do.” Anthea ignored him, still focussed on the utterly enthralling words that seemed to dominate her screen.
He felt hot tears in his eyes, threatening to spill over. He let them roll down his cheeks. What was the point in trying to cover them up? He was alone, no one was going to see, unless Mrs Hudson decided to pay him a visit, but it seemed unlikely, given the way he had been treating her.
They spent the next few minutes repeating the same exercise as they had done before in the park. It took a shorter amount of time to calm Sherlock than it did John. Everyone shifted where they stood, not taking their eyes from the two men, waiting to see what would happen. Sherlock nodded as John spoke, acknowledging his instructions.
"I always knew you were a sentimental git." The imaginary John laughed fondly. "I don't see why you hide it so very deep, I always liked knowing you were human."
"I assure you John that no-one is placing the blame on you. You're an extremely competent doctor whom I've always trusted to take care of my brother seeing how he does an appalling job of it himself." John couldn't help but laugh. Both of the Holmes brothers seemed to have an uncanny ability to read his mind. It must run in the family. "Considering recent circumstances, I do not point the finger in your direction over Sherlock's condition. It's his own fault and I've seen fit to remind him of-"
"Because you're not the same Sherlock Holmes that I know. You're still a brilliant, arrogant, snobbish know-it-all, but you're not the man who was my best friend." His voice cracked, and he looked towards the floor, desperately trying to keep the tears from falling as the brutal honesty of his words settled in. It had been one thing to think them, but admitting them out loud set it in stone. This was not the same Sherlock Holmes, and John felt that no matter how hard he tried, he was never going to fully regain his best friend. However, this did not mean that he was not going to try.
“I had stayed with Lestrade the night before, and was therefore thoroughly unprepared for the weather, so he let me borrow one of his jumpers. I wore it under my coat. It was not a flattering look.”
His mind palace was in disarray. Everything was throwing itself around, there was no sense of order. The paint was peeling, the doors were flying open until everything was thrown together, all one huge bundle of information and memories and theories and feelings until Sherlock couldn’t think clearly. Random thoughts were flitting through his head at lightning speed.
"Something happened after I left Bart's. I didn't know it's significance until I woke up. It was in the taxi. I-"
John snapped his head around to stare at Sherlock. Never had the man admitted to ever being at fault, let alone deserving of such hostile behaviour.
Sherlock’s breath hitched as Jason used that oh so familiar phrase that came so casually, but meant so much more.
John let out a short laugh, but there wasn’t anything remotely funny. "They shouldn't be. I should be able to mourn the loss of my wife with my best friend there to support me." It was now John’s turn to turn his attention to the remainder of his drink.
Mrs Hudson sat chatting away. It was near 10pm, and she, John and Sherlock were sat around the table, each with a mug of tea in their hands. The flat smelled of tomato and garlic, strong but not overpowering, and pleasant to the senses. The fire was lit in the living room and there were several candles on the wooden table in the kitchen. As John had been setting them out, Sherlock had made a passing comment about 'not being your date', which had resulted in John laughing so much that she felt like his sides were surely going to split, as Sherlock looked on, a deep, amused chuckled escaping him.  The atmosphere in 221B was relaxed, welcoming and warm, reminiscent of the time spent there before, the three of them around the table. Although, in previous times, Mrs Hudson was the one fussing around the men, at least one of them sporting an injury sustained during a case more often than not. This evening, however, the tables had turned.
"Ever the drama queen," John sighed. But even as he said so, he was relieved to hear Sherlock sounding like himself. "Mycroft, tell him to shut up and then tell me why he's in hospital again."
That had been the turning point, as Sherlock caught sight of John on the other side of the police tape. His mind has shuddered to a halt – a spectacular feat in itself. He couldn’t form words as he took in the sight of the army doctor, trying to blend in with the crowd, to look like the innocent party. Sherlock had felt his heart rate increase, and felt the strange fluttering and swooping sensation in his stomach that was usually associated with Fight or Flight. He felt a warmth surrounding him, much more efficient than any shock blanket, and suddenly, the emotions began to claw their way out of their prison and infiltrate his mind and body.
He saw life, people going about their daily business, laughing, joking. Their happiness left a hollow feeling in the cavity of Sherlock's chest. These people did not deserve to laugh. These people with their secrets, affairs, drug addictions, stealing, racism and general stupidity. They did not deserve to be happy. The only person Sherlock had ever thought deserved happiness was gone. He'd died believing happiness was impossible. Sherlock would have given anything to be able to prove him wrong.
“Didn’t take you long to figure out, did it?” John didn’t turn to Sherlock, choosing instead to focus on organising the food products on the side. His tone was slightly harsher than intended, but John guessed he was still highly irritated and frustrated from his encounter with Mycroft.
"No, it shouldn't matter," John corrected him, "but it does. You're still recovering from a traumatic experience-"
As John realized this, he became overwhelmed by how much he loved this woman, and how much she obviously loved him. He moved off the sofa and was lead to the kitchen by the smell of toast. Mary was stood at the counter, spreading generous amounts of John’s favourite jam on the fresh toast. She was faced away from him and did not see him come in. Her hair was ruffled, and her cheeks were slightly flushed. She was dressed in her much loved pink dressing gown. To John, she had never looked more beautiful.
They were all wrong. Sherlock had a rather large heart, but when you grow up in the Holmes family, sentiment is frowned upon, caring is not an advantage, and love is simply a chemical defect found in the losing side. Sherlock had always been on the losing side, and he had always been capable of love. He was cautious. He’d never expose his heart unless he trusted the recipient completely. Growing up in the Holmes family meant that he’d learned to trust very few people, and hence he never showed any interest in those around him.
helping John to plan his wedding. Like he was just a shell that had been running on auto pilot. But he never worked on the first Sunday of the month. Never. He continued to vanish and return to the living world late into the evening. The next day, Sherlock would be back to normal.
"It's an exact replica of her wedding bouquet." Sherlock had always possessed an uncanny ability to read John's mind, and once again he was completely right. "I have a new one made every month."
“Now, look here,” began Lestrade, clearly about to tell the man that it was not his business and John’s private affairs were not the reason for this conference. However, John cut him off before he had the chance.
“Shhh, Sherlock.” John began to brush the hair out of Sherlock’s eyes, just as the medical team began to rush through the door. “Just be alive for me, okay? Can you do that? Just be. Just exist. Just fight.”
Mrs Hudson smiled fondly at the detective and shook her head at him. “When a certain young man waltzed into my life and taught me some very valuable lessons, and hopefully, I managed to teach him just as many.” She gave Sherlock a quick wink as she drained the rest of her tea and began to tidy up. She placed the two cups, on empty, one full but now stone cold, into the sink. When she turned back, Sherlock was watching John sleep again.
Sherlock sat himself down at the table with John seated in the chair opposite. He did not talk. He needed to think. It seemed that the game was continuing - with neither Sherlock or Moriarty actually dying after the face-off on the roof of St Bart's - and Sherlock could tell that it had become significantly more dangerous, but not for him. But for the man sat across from him.
He didn’t know how long he was there,  but after some time had passed, John felt arms around him, pulling him in. He smelled the honey shampoo before he saw Mary’s face, and allowed her to envelope him in her arms, as for the second time in three days, John completely let go of any self-restraint he had managed to hold onto.
John didn’t know, and probably didn’t care. Well, that’s what he’d told Mycroft when he was found, high as a kite, unceremoniously bundled into the back of the black car and found himself face to face with his older brother. He’d never seen Mycroft so angry in his life. If Sherlock was being honest, he had been more than a little scared of Mycroft. His voice had been so harsh, so cutting. So accusing. Mycroft never shouted, but he did then. He’d shouted about how much Sherlock was damaging his body – which had been through enough recently without returning to ‘the sauce’ as Mycroft so elegantly put it. And Sherlock hadn’t put up a word in his defense, because what was the point? There was no defense. Sherlock knew he’d done something stupid but he really just hadn’t cared by this point.
Thank you guys for supporting this story so much! Really, if it hadn't been for you guys I probably would have given up this fic long ago, so thank you for that!
Eventually, Sherlock calmed down and allowed himself to be treated. The drugs hadn’t entirely left his system yet, so his body needed rest. But John couldn’t let Sherlock fall unconscious again whilst there was so much that he wanted to tell him.
He had tried his best to comfort her. He held her close, just as she had done, rubbing small circles into her back, not caring that she was leaving black marks from her tears on the shoulder of his jumper. He repeatedly reminded her that it was only temporary, just until Sherlock recovered – if he ever did. He told her that he loved her with every cell in his body, and that was not going to change no matter what was happening in John’s life, or however many miles separated them. He promised to tell her everyday just how much he loved her, and thanked her for putting his life back together after the incident involving Moriarty, St Bart’s rooftop and Sherlock.
After the brief moment, he returned to his default position, just sat in the chair, thinking, wishing that he could be happy, for the pain to end. There had been nights where the pain was so great that he has tried to swallow all of the sleeping tablets he could find. Mrs Hudson had arrived just in time, and had forced the bottles out of his hands. One night, he blacked out and woke up the next morning to the clean smell that accompanied hospitals, with a tear-stained Harry beside his bed. He'd promised her then that he wouldn't try again. They might not get along, but since their parents rejected her, John was the only thing she had left.
They walked in silence through the corridors, passing figure after figure in the long, white lab coats that is was custom to wear here. The faces didn’t register with John as he moved down another corridor. His breathing eased up in these familiar surroundings, and the sensation in his chest was fading to almost nothing. The lights were too harsh, leaving John feeling exposed, judged, examined. Molly pushed open a door to their right and held it open for John. He stepped through and waited for Molly to join him. She gestured to one of the lab stools, where John sat. She pulled up her own and sat facing him. It was obvious from her position and the look on her face that their topic of conversation was a serious one.
"Not at all, Mycroft," replied John, airily, "just admiring the office." The comment was returned with the cold look that Mycroft often gave John – disproving could have been one word for it.
Sherlock bent down to carefully place the flowers at the foot of the white marble. As he stood back up to rejoin John, Sherlock was wiping his eyes on his sleeve.
John had a lot to take in. He repeated Molly’s words, over and over again in his mind. And finally, something clicked in his brain. Suddenly, the world made sense again, the sun appeared from behind a cloud, he could sense a shift in the universe from that one moment of understanding. Why had he ever been so stupid as to worry about Sherlock leaving him again? The very idea seemed laughable now. In fact, John Watson did laugh. His face broke into a smile and he laughed as if he’d heard the funniest joke in the world.
They had planned to do nothing but lay in bed all day, just drinking each other in and lavishing each other with words of love and comfort and home. It was supposed to be the happiest that Sherlock had ever been.
Sherlock turned,Not to acknowledge either of them, but to delicatley pick up his violin and raise it to underneath his chin. He closed his eyes, breathed in deeply, and began to play what Greg had entitled in his head 'John's Song'.
John turned his head and found him, being loaded into the back of an ambulance by yet more paramedics.
They entered the room from the same door they had just exited, with the cameras flashing, and the reporters all jostling for the best positions to get their scoop. A few cameras were set up towards the back of the room, to film the whole event, presumably for the evening news. Lestrade had entered first, sitting on the left side of the room, then Sherlock, who was seated in the middle, and finally John, sat to the right of the consulting detective and closest to the door, just in case.
“John?” Lestrade’s voice broke through the haze that had been clouding John’s senses. A firm hand took hold of his upper arm, and John noticed that he had moved forward towards the ambulance, towards Sherlock, without even realising. He turned to face Lestrade, whose face was lined with worry and concern.
When Mycroft had been cleaned up slightly by the insistent and, in his opinion, highly irritating nurses, Mycroft was accosted by Molly Hooper, who had been waiting anxiously for news regarding to the detective and the army doctor since their arrival here several hours previously.
“Then there’s nothing more to discuss.” Sherlock, once again, resumed his observation of his cultures. He let a few moments of silence pass before looking up at John, who had not moved and was still watching him with a look of utter shock still etched on his face. Sherlock glanced over John’s head at the kitchen clock, and then back at John.
"It was my fault." The voice was so quiet and timid that Greg could hardly believe it was coming from the man next to him. Sherlock had taken his face out of his hands, which were now resting of his knees drawn up to his chest. At full height, Sherlock Holmes was often rather intimidating. In this state, he couldn't even intimidate a mouse. His eyes - usually so analytical as they took in every piece of information available to them - were staring at nothing, completely blank. It was disconcerting.
But when he returned home at only 10pm that evening, it was obvious the date had not gone as intended. Sherlock had spent most of the evening sat in his armchair, staring at John’s, thinking about how best to hide his attraction from John – who simply could never, under any circumstances ever find out. It would ruin their friendship, and Sherlock couldn’t risk it. Not after he realised that this is what had been missing from his life. No. They needed to remain friends, and that was only going to work if Sherlock didn’t reveal the extent of his feelings to his flat mate.
"No getting away from it this time, Sherlock. No magic carpet to swoop in and save you. No big brother to protect you," he taunted. It was obvious what Moriarty was planning, and had been obvious since he turned up in the cab. History was repeating itself, and this time Moriarty intended to win. No cheating, no magic tricks. One dead body and one survivor standing victoriously over it.
“He’s the best chance we have.” He pulled out his phone from his pocket, excusing himself from Molly’s company and gesturing to his phone by way of explanation, before bringing the device up to his ear and walking smoothly down the corridor, away from Molly and towards the entrance of the hospital.
“Only the parts when he talks about our cases,” he admitted. It was true. Sherlock was only interested in how John made their cases sound. The better they sounded and the more intelligent John made Sherlock out to be, the more cases they would get, and end Sherlock’s insufferable boredom.
The music continued in the background. Even Mycroft had shown no surprise or alarm at the sudden outburst.
Sherlock couldn’t hold it back any longer. He let go. He sobbed, great cried wracked through his body, an animalistic cry of anguish that was just as painful to hear that it was to experience. He still had the voicemail, he couldn’t bring himself to listen to it again, but he could never delete it. He had it memorized.
John was so caught up with Mary, and Sherlock didn’t want to take him away from her. He didn’t want to worry him with his relapse. Sherlock had taken great care to hide it. John only had to lift Sherlock’s sleeves and there he would see the track marks. But kind, trusting John would never have even considered the possibilities of Sherlock relapsing.
He could feel his pulse quicken and his breathing became heavier and faster. Inconvenient? Inconvenient! How dare Sherlock do this to him!
He fumbled in his jacket pocket, pulled out his phone and dialled Lestrade’s number. It rang for only a few seconds before the man on the other end picked up.
John chucked and muttered under his breath as Sherlock picked up the delicate instrument and moved towards his bedroom, “that’s because you act like one.”
The word echoed around the halls of his mind palace. He blinked rapidly and he stopped himself from breathing too deeply – it would convey his panic at the word. He forced himself to deliver a cutting remark.
“Uh,” John tried clearing his throat, which had become oddly tight. “We might have had an argument.”
If it weren't for the fact that Sherlock let him into the flat whenever he visited personally, Greg would have ended up summoning Mycroft to sort his younger brother out.
"I am genuinely wounded and hurt by that you lanky git," he smirked and shot Sherlock a cheeky, knowing wink. The small gesture felt like a knife in Sherlock's gut.
Many thoughts were racing through Johns mind. He had done as Sherlock had asked and not said a word. He listened intently to the younger mans voice, taken in every tiny detail about his story. His heart had jumped when he found out why Sherlock had jumped. To protect him. A rush of guilt had pulsed through John after hearing this, as he remembered their last words to each other, face to face in the lab.
But John either wouldn’t, or couldn’t speak. Sherlock believed it was the latter, as John had struck him as a man who knew what to say in most situations. He’d always offered Sherlock reassurance when he’d needed it in these past months. He’d always known exactly what to say, even when Sherlock was trying to make life as difficult as possible for the army doctor. He regretted that now. All John had done was continue to be a friend to Sherlock, and Sherlock had shut him out in favour of sulking and wallowing in self pity.
Sherlock had not realised that his own version of himself was sitting in the corner of the room, hands clutched to his head, tears running down his head as it continued to feel like someone had sliced it open in two with a white hot scalpel and decided to examine his brain. The pain combined with the happenings of his mind palace was overwhelming him. He thanked a higher power which he didn't believe in that he was unconscious, as it dulled the pain somewhat. If he were awake, surely he'd be screaming in pain.
But what surprised John the most was the look of pure, open hatred in her eyes as she glared directly at Sherlock, lips setting into a thin line and eyes never blinking.
During the time of their separation, John had Mary to fall back on. She was there to pick up the broken pieces of John's life and had carefully pieced them bak together with her love, her kindness and her goodness. But this time, if Sherlock left John behind again, there would be no-one to catch John, no-one to ut him back together.
Moriarty liked to play dirty, and bringing John back into the game again was the worst kind of foul play that Moriarty was capable of, because he knew exactly how much John meant to him.
The argument had been inevitable. John was expecting it the moment they walked out of the consultant’s office. But of course, Mary had waited until they were back at home.
“It’s not my fault the girl was incapable of asking relevant questions!” Sherlock argued. Lestrade opened his mouth to retort, but John put his hands up to stop him.
“And you… uh… remembered all that?” Sherlock blinked several times as he tried to get the words out of his mouth.
"John, if you spend all evening stood outside questioning 'what if' you'll never actually find out the answer to anything."
"Knew that would get your attention." Sherlock's smile turned sheepish, but he did not look away from John. It was as if he was trying to memorise his face. Reflecting back, it was here that John knew. But it didn't stop his doubts or worries.
Everything stilled, and Sherlock thought of nothing, the hand at his back providing an anchor for Sherlock to cling to, to keep him grounded. His body stopped betraying itself, and Sherlock attempted to stand, but his legs didn’t seem able to support him. Sherlock began to fall to the floor, but what he was not expecting was the pair of strong arms that caught him, and lowered him gently to the floor so he was sat with his back to the kitchen worktop, knees drawn up to his chest. He heard John get up, and Sherlock fully expected him to leave again, but he returned only a moment later with a glass of water and two tablets resting in the palm of his hand.
