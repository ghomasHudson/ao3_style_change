Puddles formed between the cracks in the pavement, and Dean’s eyes had become glued to the ground in an attempt to save his shoes when he caught a glimpse of something fluttering and beige out of the corner of his eye. Lifting a hand to shield his face from the rain, Dean peered across the road and down a side alley. If he wasn’t mistaken, someone was standing against the shadowed walls. Someone in a trench coat.
“Forever,” Castiel said once more, into the stale air of his bedroom. He said it with just as much conviction now as he had then. “And I did. You showed me true happiness. You showed me paradise. I would wait for that forever.”
They were not the letters of a spy, nor of a betrayer. They were, if Sam had to put a name to them, love letters, although not the teasing, passionate letters that existed between Mary and John. These were more like diary entries, addressed to someone never meant to read them. They spoke of one-sided love, of a lover resigned to go on unnoticed.
. I don’t know how to bring him back. What if he doesn’t come back this time. Everything has been taken from me. I don’t know if there’s any point anymore. Why have I been left here? Why do I have to stay?
“We aren’t going to bring him back, Dean. That was the whole point of the Ma’lak box.”
“Unless you still want the-”
In this lighting, with his mouth tightly set and his body still tense, still affected by his time in Heaven, Dean remembered how easy it was to be scared of the creature beside him. Castiel’s posture, after years acclimating to life on earth, had become deceptively relaxed. The angel that walked the Earth fresh from Heaven held himself like he was made of ceaseless power, like he wouldn’t hesitate to draw the blood of anything that got in his way.
It was a waste of time to try.
For a moment, with his body heaped onto clifftop, Castiel couldn’t move. His fingers tangled in the short, sparse grass underneath him, his face pressing into the ground. Each breath that he took rattled into his lungs like it would be his last. What had he been fighting so hard for? The ocean below crashed loudly against the cliff face. Seagulls called from overhead. Would it be so terrible, to just lie here a while?
“Why does this sound like a goodbye?” Dean asked, the fear automatic. He had to be wrong, because there was no way Cas would just leave him, not after saying those words that made Dean’s head spin, made his heart race. All of Dean’s insecurities, his thoughts of himself, spoken and dismissed as Cas had smiled all the while.
The bed groaned as Cas slid himself off of it, and he grumbled right along with it. He walked shakily across the room, using the walls and furniture to his advantage. Once he’d made it into the adjoining bathroom, he braced one hand onto the sink as he took in his reflection in the mirror.
He snapped his gaze to the touch, and found Dean’s hand holding him in place. A look to Dean’s face revealed the driver’s attention still glued forwards.
“Well, yeah. But that’s ‘cause then I
There must be a way to get him back, but we haven’t found it yet. If the kid knows how to get him back, if he has that power and isn’t telling us, then I’m going to find a way to rip it from him. He’s going to pay for what he did to Cas, I
“Cas.” Dean smiled. “I thought I saw you. Where did-” He faltered, forgetting what he’d been about to say.
Judging from the sandwich that Sam had shoved towards him about half an hour ago, it was more likely closer to lunch time than midnight. Dean eyed the sandwich, with its green lettuce leaves sticking out, and pushed it to the edge of the table with the tips of his fingers. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt hungry, and he certainly didn’t feel so now.
- Taylor Swift, marjorie
So here was the end, then. Death would kill Dean, and then both she and Cas would be taken by the Empty. Dean would never get to tell Cas that he loved him back.
It’s easy, when in the presence of something as beautiful as that, to forget everything that has gone wrong. Is it terrible, to occupy my mind with the world’s beauty when I was almost the one to destroy it? When I could still be the one to destroy it? I have messed everything up, and I don’t even know how it happened. I don’t believe that any of this pain was ever my intention. I was trying, well, what I was trying to do is not important anymore.
Dean followed Cas blindly forwards; his attention was glued downwards, to the way that the snow yielded to each press of his foot, crunching softly under his weight. The white lines for the parking stalls were just visible. They walked past cars that wouldn't be starting anytime soon. They found their way into an empty space near the back of the lot.
“I have duties to Heaven. If we aren’t working on the case, then I’m wasting my time here with you.”
“‘S fine, buddy,” Dean said quickly. He pulled his eyes away from Cas so that he could watch the road as he backed out of the parking lot. “I should’a let you know what I was doing.”
“You’ll be okay,” Castiel smiled, sinking down to the ground.
Cas pulled his trench coat sleeves off one by one, and twisted in his seat to pull it the rest of the way off. He folded it up into a pillow-sized bundle, careful to remove his angel blade and anything else sharp from the pockets.
(See the end of the chapter for
'Tis the damn season, write this down
“D' they know that it’s you?”
“You’re wasting your… with me?” Dean’s fingers slid away from the still-full shot glass, and he turned on his bar stool towards Cas. For a second, Cas thought that Dean would ask him to stay, like he had at the restaurant. Instead, the barista returned and asked Dean what he was waiting for. Dean turned around and picked up the shot, drinking it under the mesmerized gaze of the barista.
“You’re in pain? Where?” Dean felt as if he were in one piece, but maybe Castiel had missed something…
Cas leaned his head to the side so that his face aligned with Dean’s. He slid his knee away from himself, farther down the bed, so that his hip could slowly, slowly touch down onto the mattress. Nothing made a noise. Nothing moved. Cas lowered his head until it hovered inches from the pillow.
- Taylor Swift, cowboy like me
Dean goes looking for Castiel after finishing the case in the bar alone. He does not recognize Cas when he finds him.
“An angel is placing a star atop my head,” Dean muttered to no one in particular. He did as he was told, holding himself as still as possible. After a few more subtle adjustments, Cas stepped back, both hands held up carefully. The slight weight of the star stayed in place on Dean’s head.
And so did, apparently, the entire world population.
mean to write fluff when I wrote this. No, I don't know what happened.)
Across the parking lot, through the fog, Dean waited for the movement that he knew would come. He closed his eyes for brief intervals, the cigarette smoke not really doing his headache the good that he’d hoped. As if that would be enough for him to put it out before it was done. He scratched at his wrist with his free hand. The cut there—werewolf attack—was beginning to scab over. He scratched too hard and his fingers came off bloody. He wiped them against his jeans.
They stepped apart, parted, and a chasm opened between them. Dean clasped his hands together, to keep them to himself, but it wasn’t necessary, because suddenly he couldn’t imagine ever being able to so much as to touch Cas’s hand while passing him a mug of coffee, or while righting his upside-down FBI badge.
Dean tightened his grasp around Cas’s hand. His Cas, this creature that masqueraded as human but really was so much more. Castiel had known the risks and he’d chosen to weaken Heaven anyways. This would not be the end for either of them.
“It’s snowing,” Cas agreed.
It took him a moment to get settled again, nodding his head slowly up and down against his knuckles as he waited for the words to come to him. “I don’t hardly get hungry anymore and I’m startin’ to wonder if this is how you felt all the time, not having to eat ‘n all. I’m not saying I envy you. I miss how much I used to look forward to bacon in the morning.” He trailed off, mind racing with images of Cas sitting at the booth in the kitchen, chatting with Dean as he fried himself bacon on the stove. Dean always poured Cas a mug of coffee, even though most mornings it sat untouched. Dean hadn’t been inside the kitchen since coming back. He didn’t want to face it alone.
Castiel smiled with half of his mouth. It was an expression that he’d learned from Dean, and it always caught Dean off guard. “You mean what did I do to them? They are weak, Dean; Heaven grows weaker everyday. Blood was running through the halls, I had to wade through it like a stream. They are losing.”
Yes, I got your letter
Cas left his hand hovering less than an inch above Dean’s, unable to drop in the rest of the way, and returned his gaze once more to Dean’s face. Dean’s eyelashes hung delicately towards his cheeks, the shadows elongating them, darkening the circles below his eyes and the dips of his cheek bones. Even now that he’d stilled, he didn’t, as Cas would have hoped, look peaceful. The worry line between his eyebrows remained ever present. His lips were tense, too.
“My true form.” Cas repeated. “You forget that I am, above all else, an angel of the Lord. There are rules for me to follow, standards I should uphold.” His hand slipped slightly away. “Standards that do not include accompanying you on a hunt.”
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
“What, it got bored?”
“You mean, did I really just sit around all day by the phone waiting for your call?” Castiel asked with more than a hint of sarcasm. He rubbed his thumb over Dean’s where their hands were entwined. “No. I worked at the same bookstore until it shut down, which I thought would be the end of making use of my history degree.” He smiled. “Instead, I was recommended to fill a vacancy at the museum. It’s a good job, good benefits,” he gestured briefly towards himself, “and luckily plenty of sick PTO.”
“Whatever you like. Help yourself. I’m going to shower.” With that, Cas closed his bathroom door and set Dean’s mind down a path he had a hard time directing it away from.
“Not,” Dean denied with a glare. “No, just figured we’d take turns so eventually . . .”
He settled back with a small groan then glanced over at Cas to see if he’d heard and, of course, he had. Dean sighed then ordered, “Get in, Cas. Let’s go. Or do I need to drive?”
Cas’s hand forced Dean’s face back to him as a lone tear trailed down Dean’s right cheek. Cas’s thumb caught it and lightly brushed it against Dean’s full bottom lip. He couldn’t stop himself, even if he wanted to.
Dean shook Cas’s arm off, like he just now realized it was behind him. “Of course. Driven a lot worse off.” Cas looked uncertain but Dean reassured him. “I’m peachy, dude. Don’t go all girly on me now. You lead. I’ll follow. It’s not like I’m going off on my own, you know.”
“Hell, yeah, I am. Didn’t I just prove it to you when I almost kicked your ass while wounded? If it hadn’t been for the ribs . . . I just happen to be used to being cuffed. Goes with the job sometimes so it’s really not one of my hang-ups. Course, I don’t get off on it, either, ‘cuz it was old for me before I was twelve,” Dean explained blandly.
“Nice,” Dean commented absently, wondering what it would be like to build your own house. “Couch is fine by me. Don’t need much. Could sleep in my baby if I need to. Have before. Let’s go grab a table.”
McDonald spotted them coming up the drive and moved to greet them. A taller man with a full head of speckled gray and black hair followed him, contrasting McDonald’s mostly bald head with solid gray on the sides. The other man was about half a foot taller than McDonald which put him at about Dean’s height.
What do you think Dean should do about all this? Continue visiting the Egyptian river?
Cas looked at him in confusion. “Decided what?”
“Whatever, nutcase,” Cas dismissed. “Maybe I’ll finally get a chance to knock you on your ass while I’m at it.”
He hated it, this need within him, the need to feel something, anything besides the loneliness and pain that he had been. He really couldn’t stand to have a woman with him after the last few fiascos in that department so this was all he could have and not be alone. He felt Casy’s hand glide gently up his chest and Dean arched slightly into the caress as another soft moan slipping under his mantel of control.
Dean gave a half shrug before he evaded dismissively, “It’s been said.”
“Fell into a freakin’ snake nest. Think I got them all, though,” Dean commented wryly. “Plus, can’t really answer when I couldn’t really hear anything, you know?”
“No, but he’s a about my size and likes trench coats,” Dean described briefly. “Really hard to miss.”
They both dug in then played darts for about an hour before they headed back to Cas’s place for their match. They both stripped to their jeans only then Cas led Dean out into the backyard. Neither one knew how much the other enjoyed the views they had.
“I got her. Cover us,” Alfie insisted, back in the present and drawing more strength with each word.
Cas cleared his throat then greeted uncomfortably, “Mornin’. Sleep well?” Cas casually leaned against the kitchen door frame.
“Dean!” Cas yelled in protest.
“I can check with Gabe and let you know when the next good time would be, if you want. I’ll introduce you,” Cas offered lightly.
“No, that wasn’t it at all but I wondered what you would say to it?”
“Which means,” Dean interpreted dryly, “he said that you followed in his footsteps and took the dare to enter the old witch’s house. Now he’s bringing you home. The folks will smell the alcohol well enough, or not, as the case may be.”
“Just a friend from out of town,” Cas shrugged. “Name’s Dean.”
“No, . . . but someone could have slipped us something. They had to have. There’s no other way . . . no such thing. It was just a bad trip,” she reiterated firmly, desperate to believe that.
Cas got Dean in the shower then spread sheets on the couch and added an extra pillow. Dean came back out of his bedroom where the only shower currently was. He’d thrown on a old gray t-shirt, boxers and some jeans. He walked slightly hunched over, protecting his left side, but his color appeared to be a little better.
He finished the grave then torched the house, making sure to salt and burn everything, including the cellar. He hung around as long as he could to make sure it didn’t get out of hand the blaze.
He smiled at the sight of the couch and asked hopefully, “Got any whiskey.”
Dean finally yielded because his ribs really couldn’t take anymore. He tapped out since their match had dissolved into grappling on the ground. Cas let him go easily then stood up and held a hand down for Dean. Dean grasped it and allowed Cas to pull him up.
Dean quirked his eyebrow in question but the kids all muttered, “Yes, sir.” Then they filed out silently but Alfie told Dean, “Get some rest. You look like hell.”
Afterward, though, he felt so drained, like he had nothing left. He’d never before felt so disconnected. Sam, or his dad, had always grounded him so he’d never needed the emotional connection while his family was around. Unfortunately, they had all left him and now here he was floundering.
Before he could even finish his turn, he was airborne, one of his least favorite things. He still had Kelly in his clutches but he’d lost his sawed off. He tried to turn, attempting to see where he was going. He definitely didn’t need another knock in the head.
Dean had stayed by Cas during the conversation but, at the end, he placed a hand on Cas’s arm briefly before hoisting himself into the backseat. He grimaced as his ribs protested then smirked at the two in the front. He teased lightly, “No more naking, you two. The elders are back and we’re not into the whole voyeur thing.”
“Pretty much,” Cas acknowledged dryly.
Dean blinked as he slowly leaned forward. His brow etched in confusion while he clarified, “Do what? What am I being accused of?”
Dean glared and admitted, “I was thinking that I should’ve remembered this damn death trap soon so that I could’ve warned everyone, asshole. That’s what I was thinking but, of course, you with your Hulk like stature just had to be the one to step on the rotten thing. Why the hell didn’t you watch were you were going, moron?”
“Ribs are still really pissed. Left ankle’s a little sore but no big. Take your time. Not like I’m claustrophobic or anything,” Dean snarked wryly.
What's left of the haunted house
Dean moved his hips, feeling his shaft move up and down in Cas’s huge hand. “How long what?” Dean questioned softly, not really paying attention to anything but Cas’s hand motions.
“Okay. I’ll get you some ice. Be right back,” Cas told him as Cas left the room again.
Dean grabbed his sawed off shotgun and stuck it into his smaller duffel, along with holy water, salt rounds and salt, before he pulled the duffel it out of the trunk and shouldered it. He turned to Cas and suggested conspiratorially, “Well, let’s go. If nothing else, we can maybe play a prank on them, right?” Dean wiggled his eyebrows conspiratorially.
A muffled scream sounded from behind the wall about the time he found the hidden latch. He carefully eased the door open, but it creaked anyway. Unfortunately, another scream covered the noise. He crept down the steep steps with the flashlight still on. It was too dark down there to see anything without it.
Cas sighed out heavily. “I wasn’t imagining things all those years ago. Was I?”
With quick calculation, he realized that tendons would probably have to be sliced for him to really snap out of this. He knew that wasn’t an option for him. Apparently, a high pain threshold and cutting just didn’t mix.
Cas drew a shuddering breath but only allowed Dean a few sucks on his cock before Cas pulled him up by the shoulder and latched on to Dean’s mouth. Cas walked Dean back and forced him down on to the bed as he pressed his hips down in Dean as hard as he could. Their cocks rubbed but were out of alignment so Cas reached between them and grabbed up both of them together more firmly than Dean ever could.
Once Dean locked up the house and climbed into the truck, Cas informed him, “You look better. Moving better, too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dude, you so have no clue about my dreams so let’s eat then we’ll figure out who’s pretty and who’s the bitch,” Dean suggested mockingly.
’ that threatened to shout out of his mouth. Why the hell couldn’t he have kept his mouth that shut last night?
They quickly drove to Cas’s house and Cas motioned for Dean to pull his car into the garage since Cas needed to leave for work early tomorrow morning anyway. Dean pulled in, making sure he didn’t scratch his baby, then got out with his duffel in hand. Cas opened the door to the house then turned on the kitchen light. Dean dropped his duffel inside then stopped Cas before he could say anything.
“Oh, shit,” Dean muttered passionately. Dean felt an electric spark of lust that shot down from his neck straight to his groin. He was filled with a desperate need to consume Cas.
“Dude, we are both drunk off our asses. It doesn’t matter what’s on the TV that we aren’t paying attention. That,” Dean motioned towards Cas’s groin, feeling his own swelling in response, “is from either the threesome or the bondage. So which is it?”
“What about what really . . .” Alfie trailed off.
Dean’s face didn’t show any response but it was in his eyes if someone knew how to look. When Dean glanced at Cas, Cas saw the relief and joy over the praise he’d just received. Dean slowly relaxed his stance before he suggested as a peace offering, “Come on. I’ll show you the grave and maybe your coroner or whoever can sort it out.”
Something touched then gripped his hand tightly and suddenly he was yanked up onto his feet. “What the hell?” he snarled, swaying drunkenly.
“But . . .,” Alfie stammered.
“Want me to stop?” Cas asked as he lifted his head and stared into Dean’s eyes. It surprised Cas how hard it was to stop sucking on Dean. Dean really tasted intoxicating and highly addictive.
The whole time, Cas bucked, thrusted and squirmed, moaning and groaning under him. Dean had never felt so much pleasure at one time and no one had even touched him yet. Cas let him do what he wanted with Cas’s large body.
“Oh, God,” Dean groaned in pleasure. “Shit, baby. Want you.”
Cas frowned in confusion at the new topic as he looked up from his shot. “Flo? You mean, from the night that I met you, Flo?” At Dean’s nod, Cas cocked his head curiously then clarified, “Make what up to her?”
Lyle quickly assessed the young man in front of him and verified, “You the one who helped Cas get Alfie out of that house?”
The hot water woke him up and sobered him up some. He bandaged his arm and gathered up his stuff. He didn’t care what Cas thought. He’d driven in worse shape than this and he had to leave this town behind along with all the crap that had happened in it before he lost what was left of his mind.
“Bet on it, pussy.” Cas laughed and headed back out the door to give Dean time to put himself back together.
“Keep your friggin’ pants on, bitch,” Dean taunted back loudly. “Was a little busy down here. Shit.”
“Yes, sir. Taking them home as well,” Cas answered politely.
Alfie swallowed hard then confided softly, “He really saved my life in there. Kelly’s, too. I . . . I couldn’t have . . . she wanted to kill us, slowly. It was . . .” he trailed off with a shudder then added reluctantly, “I knew we were dead. I still don’t know how he . .  .” He trailed off again but this time he turned to stare at the surrounding darkness while he fought back the tears that threatened.
Dean didn’t look at him as he shook his head and answered with a weak smile, “I’m good. Just tired and itchy.”
Dean plastered a smirk on his face with his game face then slapped Cas on his shoulder, reminding Cas he was still there and listening. Cas swung around to glare at Dean who laughed in Cas’s face, “Dude, they pranked the others. Good prank, too. You know they have to be hiding somewhere out here. We just need to find them. Right?”
Dean groaned as his eyelids finally acknowledged the dawning sunlight piercing them. He briefly wondered where the hell he was this time. Since his dad and Sam left, he really hadn’t cared where he’d ended up at night, or if he’d even woke up the next morning. He knew he needed to find a new hunt. Hunting gave him purpose, a mission, until his father decided he was worth something again, which was normally either bait or backup. But, at least, he got to see his dad then.
“Good enough?” Cas asked softly against Dean’s lips.
After they’d finished eating all the pizza, they settled back and kept drinking while relaxing and trading stories of adventure and women. They were both on their sixth or seventh beer respectively. Lights were out since they had started drinking around five and didn’t see any reason to get up and turn on more light. The action flick they had been barely paying attention to was over and the credits were rolling.
Dean still had a soft smile on his face when he repeated slowly, “What’s the plan for tomorrow? Is there a game? Cow Tipping? Anything?”
Dean knew this would be a future conversation for him. He flinched slightly in acknowledgement as the men continued to check his arms all over. He’d never been so conscious of all the scars he had. After that, they check his legs from the top of his boots to his knees then checked his torso and back while he raised his shirt.
Dean then bravely met Amber’s father’s eyes and told him solemnly, “I’m sorry.” The father’s face drained of all color but Dean continued, anxious to finish this part, “I don’t know for sure but there is a pile of bones in a grave about a hundred feet behind the house. I can show you where. I’m fairly certain the old lady’s bones are in there but there are more than that. You’d have to have a specialist come out and check.” Deep down, though, Dean knew she was dead.
Dean shook his head slightly before he argued, “Well, one, I have busted ribs and a hell of a concussion so I’m impressed that you even think that I could manage that today. I must be bad ass. Two, I never confirmed that I did it and you should know what assumptions do. Finally, three, who in the hell would I have taken with me if I had a notion to do it? I sure as hell wouldn’t take you kids.”
, he admonished himself.
Cas’s loud laughter was heard through the phone while Kelly stammered with embarrassment and Alfie hissed out, “Seriously, dude? What the hell?”
“Damn it, Dean,” Cas’s curse thundered around him. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?”
Cas added, “We’re added another rope to make sure it’ll get all the way down to you. Give us another minute. You hurt anything falling?”
“Okay, boy,” Lyle finally allowed. “Looks like you dodge the bullet, or the snake as the case may be. How many were there? We heard about five shots.”
Cas stared at Dean during the recital then switched to Alfie at the end. He could tell Alfie was about to lose it. The problem was that Cas wasn’t even sure about what he saw and he obviously missed some. “When the hell did you get thrown into a wall, Dean?”
“Damn annoying old bitty,” Dean cursed under his breath before he commanded Alfie, “Move your ass, kid.”
Dean cast a quick glance at Cas before he answered politely, “Yes, sir.”
“She can, just until she sees if this works, right, Dean?” Cas concluded.
“Nah, just bruised ribs. Not cracked. Know the difference,” Dean informed him.
“What the hell did she do to you?” Cas demanded with slight outrage.
“Someone to, touch you,” Cas finished softly. “Why me?”
“No, I’m good,” Dean answered thickly. “The blanket’s fine. Thanks, Cas.”
The ladies exchanged quick looks before agreeing enthusiastically, “Sure.”
“Aw, you’re so sweet,” Dean praised with sweetly dripping insincerely while Kyle stifled a laugh. Dean wiggled his eyebrows at Kyle as he continued, “But you just gave me a free pass. I’d be a fool to let that go without taking advantage.” He heard a laugh on the other side of the phone, letting him know that Cas also had him on speaker.
“No, please,” Dean whispered, trying to keep what was left of his pride and not beg. “I just needed . . . wanted . . .”
, remember? Doesn’t that make you the dickhead?”
“Did it while you were gathering your stuff. They know and are relieved.”
“Just . . . just touch . . . touch me, Casy. Just a little touch. That’s all. Nothing else,” Dean coaxed softly, too drunk to keep it in anymore. “
The sheriff and others who had gathered around all smirked or just shook their heads, knowing that Dean was right. Dean laid it on a little thicker as he warned easily, “I’m not helping you dig this either. Got some seriously bruised ribs from that night and I seriously doubt I should be doing something that strenuous with them.”
Alfie nodded again then cleared his throat and straightened. “So what’s with your friend?”
She continued, “Since I spoke up first, I get first dibs.” And with that, the kissing contest began as she slid up to Dean and pulled his head down for the first kiss of the evening. Another girl slid up to Cas and copied the first lady.
Cas glared at him through the mirror. “Stop hurting yourself, you moron.”
“What the hell does that mean?” Kelly’s father snapped.
“Normal to attack you?”
“Man, I definitely need to try that then. That’s my favorite movie,” Dean admitted easily, feeling the tension in his shoulders and neck release at the conversation. He uncocked his gun in reaction then put the safety back on. He put the gun away then got up and stumbled to the bathroom. He felt the sudden need to clean his cuts, like he was trained to do.
McDonald pushed his ballcap back on his head and sighed, “I was trying to make sure you didn’t do that fool thing everyone’s talking about first. Then I came to warn whoever did it and, no, I don’t want to know who did.”
“Aren’t you still working?”
“Don’t know tell I see them. If you’re sure they’re dead, bring one up with you so we know, just in case,” Lyle advised.
“Whatever you want,” Dean replied easily. “No one will believe you anyway because you were all drinking out there. I smelled booze on all of you. So it doesn’t matter what you say. Although if you don’t want to become social outcasts or shipped off to the nuthouse, you’ll just say it was a really good prank that you all were in on and everyone fell for it, hook, line and sinker.”
“Well, it’s getting close to October and Halloween so he’s probably over at Ol’ Lady Hutchinson’s place,” Cas drawled out. “That’s the normal hangout this time of year.”
Cas came back in and handed him an ice bag then an ice pack. Dean took another large swallow of the whiskey before he eased back down. Cas helped him arranged the ice packs then resumed his seat facing Dean.
“Alfie hasn’t come home and it’s way past curfew so just typical teenage stuff, you know. All the older kids have moved away so the youngest has to act out,” Cas explained the on-going problem. “Parents are already tired from raising the rest of us so they’ve been really lax with the discipline. Now, Dad’s blood pressure is way up and Mom’s trying to calm him down before he has another episode.”
Cas returned the grin and taunted confidently, “Doubtful but whatever helps you sleep at night. Call me when you’re headed out and I’ll give you directions. You pass Mel’s on the way so you can head that way for starters.”
“I didn’t bring crap here, except this,” he countered tauntingly and he brought his shotgun to bear on her form.
So they both got up and took care of that before Cas grabbed Dean’s hand and pulled him into bed. Dean sighed heavily but allowed it and climbed into bed. He got under the covers while Cas turned off the lights. Then he felt Cas pull him in close to Cas’s warm body with his back up against Cas’s solid chest.
“The groin because he did her or he’s trying to get out of it?” Dean wondered with a small smile.
Alfie looked up at Cas hopelessly. “She won’t wake up, Cas.”
The sheriff looked down at the mud covered jewelry and nodded solemnly, “Yeah. I can do that. Thanks.” He gave Dean a slap on the back then moved off.
“No kidding,” Cas scoffed with amusement. “Maybe it will teach him to be more responsible and stop being such a dick.” Cas paused then amended, “Don’t get me wrong. Alfie’s a great kid. It’s just lately he’s, I don’t know, acting out, I guess. Not sure why?”
Dean shrugged then moved away, announcing casually, “I’ll help with minimizing the death trap.”
. . .
Cas shook his head slightly then followed Alfie to the front door. He talked with his folks briefly before hurrying back to his truck. Dean had managed to get himself into the front seat and close the door by the time Cas made his way back. Cas climbed into his truck then took in Dean’s slumped form, resting against the passenger side door. Cas finally demanded harshly, “Do you need a doctor?”
Cas sighed as he opened the door and told Dean, “I’ll show you the way to the house then I have to run an errand.”
“Your what?” Dean mumbled. Cas’s hand was warm against his cheek. The rain and the wind hit against him as cold as ever, but they were easier to ignore with Cas’s warm hand right there.
“‘Little no-name bar’? You’ve got to be joking.” The barista flipped a clean glass from the stack behind her, and filled it up with clear liquid from a tall bottle. “For that, you’ll be buying me a drink.”
“Occasionally,” the barista said smoothly, “men tumble through those doors lookin’ like they made a wrong turn on the way back to Heaven.”
Dean had mumbled as he’d watched her finish the star from over her shoulder.
Dean drew the last thing from his pocket. This was the one that Sam had made the biggest fuss over.
“Sammy,” Dean said, voice quiet as if he could speak without Cas hearing.
That paused her movement, and she drew her eyebrows down as she turned back to him. “Excuse me?”
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Sam loitered by Dean’s side, looking down at the suit jacket and dress shirt that Dean had laid out on his bed. “I mean, you and Cas-”
Content warning for drinking, allusion to major character "death."
There wasn’t much
For the flesh wounds, it would be easy enough to let them scab over and heal. Castiel was more worried about the searing pain in his left shoulder, and the thrumming heat in his right knee. He couldn’t even begin to think of asking Dean to let him stay for long enough to heal a knee injury in the human way.
The coat finally fell from his one side, and immediately caught in a gust of wind, pulling Castiel around so that his back pressed to the cliff face, his face exposed to the wind. The view downwards was dizzying, even though he’d known what to expect. The ocean was far, far below, white-caps like bubbling dashes of white across a wine-dark abyss. It stirred and thrashed, as if the water itself were alive.
“Where’s the fire, Cas?” Dean asked. He had his hip leaned against the countertop and held a sandwich with both hands. Although his tone had been flippant, his eyebrows were knitted together.
He ducked his head to read the labels off of a short freezer, charmed by the faded images of rainbow popsicles and ice-cream sandwiches. The cold that came from within the freezer did not pain Castiel, as temperatures hardly affected him. It did, however, send a pleasant tingling sensation across his hands. He picked up a box from within out of the want to continue on with the sensation even after closing the freezer. He held the box lightly, fingers scratching against beads of ice.
Freezie’s, it turned out, was the name of a single-room bar on an otherwise vacant road. Dean had his pick of parking spots as he brought the Impala to a rest; the bar was surrounded by a road’s width of gravel on all sides, with cars and trucks parked in an entirely unorganized pattern all around. The crickets chirping and other soft such night noises were drowned out entirely by a pumping beat emitting from the building. Cas assumed it was music, although it sounded more uncomfortable that any music Dean had played for him.
“Cas,” Dean began, breath warm against his hands. “I hope you can hear me. I know I told ya’ that I’d take care of myself, and I’m trying. I know you must’ve told Sam to take care of me, because it’s what I would have done in the opposite situation, and because he won’t leave me alone. He keeps trying to give me food, terrible, healthy food like he eats. I’m lookin’ at a sandwich right now with lettuce coming out all sides.” He tipped his head up and blinked his eyes open briefly towards the sandwich in question, so that he wouldn’t be lying.
I know I seem different now, and I feel it too. I am not as I used to be, but this is because I know more now. I was dead, gone! I was dead and gone and then, miraculously, I came back. Some joke, probably, to bring me back and make me relive the pain I caused all over again. A mistake, perhaps. In coming back from the dead, though, I’ve realized how many wonderful things I was missing by paying attention only to my duties.
Chapter 11.
Dean tried to take a deep breath. He let his head fall back, watched the ceiling fan spin, and dropped to sit on the now-empty side of the bed. He tried again to take a calming, deep breath. Damnit, that meditation crap Sammy was always on about never worked when it needed to.
Did I paint my nails black after writing this? Hmm... uh... I'll let you decide.
Baby’s engine roared to life, her headlights flickering on and illuminating the gravel ahead. It wasn’t until Dean turned to look over his shoulder as he started backing up that he noticed Cas sitting in the passenger seat. He startled, swearing under his breath. “You’ve gotta let me know when you’re there, man.”
The shiny black body of the Impala waited patiently for him in the parking lot. A large part of Dean wanted to get inside of Baby, rev up her engine and start the smooth ride back home. Cas was a free agent, he didn’t need Dean tracking him down for leaving. Hadn’t he said something about his duties to Heaven? The guy was probably out of Dean’s reach by now, anyways.
“I think it’s time for me to move on.”
“Can I get ya’ a drink?” Asked a bartender with a white towel thrown over his shoulder.
“The angels already talk poorly of me,” Castiel continued, speaking to the sky. “They say that I am growing too close to you. They question my loyalty. They call what I choose to do ‘undignified,’ and I fear they may be right. I’ve become too comfortable here, pretending like I’m human.”
Outside the bus windows, the night was beginning to seep back into day. Cas could make out the lines of the trees and the point where the side of the road stopped and the forest began. He held his coat against his chest as he asked, “how do you know that they consider you family?”
“Okay,” Castiel repeated. He picked the loose flowers that he’d brought in up from the dresser, and pressed them into Dean’s hand. “I’m not going to stay and watch you make this mistake, Dean. I love you. I’m sorry that that’s not enough for you.” He brushed a hand through his hair smoothing it back down, then touched the door handle.
But that wasn’t fair. The way Dean had grown up, will the way that John had joked, had made fun of people who were different in that way… it was no wonder that Dean had so much trouble opening up that part of himself. The jealousy faded into regret for his brother as Sam considered how much shame must cloak the feelings Dean had for Cas.
“Yeah, yeah, I- ...Cas?”
Dean shrugged, gluing his eyes to the dark TV screen. Sam shifted his weight from foot to foot, and Dean knew that he wanted to say more, to turn this into a chick-flick moment. Luckily, he thought better of it. He placed Cas’s badge onto Dean’s bedside table, and closed the door softly behind him when he left.
And yet, Cas’s traitorous hands still itched to offer their help. The back of his knuckles was begging to shimmer gold: the beginnings of his grace coming to the surface in preparation for being used. He shoved the hand into the pocket of his trench coat.
Cas to do in the bedroom, Sam supposed. The angel didn’t sleep, didn’t seem in any sort of need for an abundance of personal space, and was content to do research in the library or leisurely in the kitchen. He resided in the bunker, Sam was certain, out of large part to be around Dean, and as Dean wouldn’t be caught dead in Cas’s room with him, Cas was better off in shared spaces.
Castiel— because of course it was Castiel—stepped up to Dean and waited. He waited with an intense air of importance that wafted across Dean and nearly forced him to flip his attention immediately upwards to Castiel’s watching face. Instead, he managed to drag his eyes up slowly, scanning across the few loose roses Castiel clutched in his hand, the swipe of makeup over one of his eyes, the tight set of his lips.
“Oh!” Castiel held the box forwards, and flipped it so Dean could read the words.
“Cas.”
The holes in the shelf, little ones, perfectly circle, at the end of each panel, began to dig into Cas’s wrist. He leaned over more, trying to nudge the holes under his sleeve where they wouldn’t scratch at his skin. His arm, having been moved forwards about two inches too far, hit against a bag of cheddar cheese potato chips and tried to knock the whole row of them to the ground. Castiel leaned quickly to catch them all. They swished into his arm as if they felt sorry for him.
“Ok, cut it out.” Sam stepped away, out of reach. “Just, let me know if the… situation gets out of your control.” The almost apologetic look Sam used to accompany his words was enough to send a spark of indignation through Dean’s veins. Why the Hell did Sam think Dean deserved his pity?
Castiel lifted his hand out in front of himself, palm forwards. Nothing came when he called, healing abilities or otherwise. He let his arm drop back down, using it to secure himself against the wall. He frowned. “If it’s not too much trouble, I’d appreciate staying here in the bunker, at least until I regain some strength.”
: Twenty years ago, Dean and Cas were in love. Now, Dean has come back to say he's sorry for leaving, but it may be too late. Angst with happy ending. AU.
“I don’t need anything from you.” Cas pressed the palm of his better hand into the solid ground, wavering for a moment before he pushed himself to standing. Mostly standing. A good portion of his weight was being supported by the cool wall behind him.
“There’s always a choice.” Castiel’s eyes tightened, his expression stern.
Dean took a step forward, on instinct moving to block Cas. He’d left his knife back at the motel. He balled his hands into fists and lifted them in front of his chest, ready. Cas’s hand landed on his back calmly.
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Sitting down on a stool, however, rebooted Dean’s brain once more. He’d unintentionally chosen the same stool he’d sat on before, and the missing presence of his case-partner became immediately apparent. Where had Cas gone? He’d said something about wasting time...
Perhaps angels weren’t meant to have families. Celestial beings, it was likely, were just too inhuman. Cas had been the closest out of all the other angels to actually joining a family, and despite all the good that it had brought him, Cas had watched it fall away. He’d caused it to fall away.
Chapter 2.
Feel free to hop around and read these in any order. Only a few are related to each other, and even ones that are can be read alone :) The table of contents includes a brief overview of each one-shot, whether it's more angst or fluff, and whether it's AU or Canon Compliant (CC)
Dean let out a surprised laugh. “I think I’ll take that as a yes.”
“What, because if you’d been around me as much as usual, you would have remembered who you actually want to be with?”
His wet hair stuck to his forehead in dripping tendrils, every so often causing beads of water to drip past his eyes and down his cheeks. He hadn’t spared a moment to mourn, hardly even to think. But if he was too late, if he did have a reason to mourn… Castiel shook the thought from his head and tried to focus the panic into making his arms and legs work even faster. The demons had known they were coming, and there had been too many of them. Castiel should have known. If he’d still had his full powers, he would have known.
Content warning: descriptions of blood/injury
“This will never exist again.” Dean only realized he’d spoken the words aloud when Cas raised his face to answer.
“Just because he left,” Sam took a step to the side, and reached towards the ground. He straightened back up with Cas’s badge in his hand. “Just because Cas left, doesn’t mean that he isn’t going to come back.”
“Because I had to help you?” Dean asked kindly. “We’re family, Cas. That’s kinda in the job description.”
but when Dean pulled them smoothly away from the wall, Castiel did not fall.
Dean had suggested Cas stay. Throughout the meal Sam had made passing jokes about crashing their date, which Dean had pointedly laughed off. At the booth where they’d sat to eat, Sam had been alone on his side, leaving Cas and Dean to squeeze together on the opposite bench. Seeing that there wasn’t much room, Cas had offered, again, to leave. Dean had asked him again to stay.
Chapter 5.
Cas made to interrupt, probably to apologize. Dean pushed on. “But whenever you don’t want to be any of that, you can come to me. With me, you’re Cas. You’ll always have me. You’ll always know the you that you are with me.”
Cas watched over the girl as she slept. It gave him something to do, something to occupy his mind instead of thoughts of Sam and Dean. Each time Cas’s brain brought him back to Dean’s anger, Cas focused harder on ensuring that the girl was protected. He had nearly forgotten what he was trying so hard to repress when her eyes fluttered open, and a million images of Dean’s eyes doing the exact same thing hit Cas like a train.
Cas sighed heavily. He dragged on hand over Dean’s shoulder, rubbing once up and down the back of Dean’s suit jacket. “Okay.” He said, then he moved away, forcing Dean to support his own weight once more. Dean swayed from one foot to the other.
Next chapter, Castiel tries to live in the moment and Dean attempts to leave a store without paying for his item.
“What’d you think, Cowboy?”
Dean bit his lower lip. Having Cas here, in person, slowed his thoughts on the matter. He needed a moment to process. Cas watched him expectantly, his never-blinking gaze not really helping Dean’s thought process.
(See the end of the chapter for
A slight weight landed on Cas’s lap, and he clutched at it with his free hand. The material of his trench coat scratched against his fingers. The girl had returned it to him.
Sam bit his teeth into his lower lip, obviously fighting back a retort. “You aren’t going to find a fix today, then, can we agree on that? But there are people we can save right now, and cases that need our attention. Get yourself cleaned up, and come with me on a vamp hunt in Oklahoma. When we get back, you can look at the books with fresh eyes. It’ll help, even.”
“This is ice cream, Sammy,” Dean cut in. “Keep your rabbit-food eating habits out of it.”
There’s something that Sammy told me once, about how he felt when Jessica died.  He said that it made him feel a type of sadness that wasn’t crying, wasn’t slow or whatever. He said it was antsy sadness. Sadness that can feel like anger.
“You know why, Cas.” Dean said between his teeth.
If Dean didn’t let them stay anywhere for the night, then he wouldn’t have any opportunity to ask Cas to come to bed with him. He wouldn't find himself with any chance to pull the covers over his own shoulders, then open them again, welcoming Cas in with him. No chance to feel Cas’s warmth beside him, to wrap an arm around Cas, or to be held as he fell asleep. No chance to ruin everything. No chance to give everything away.
Castiel rolled his shoulders, settling the trench coat into order around himself. He tipped back his head to take in the sky. The last time he would see the sky. Dean tried to swallow. He brushed at his face with his sleeve again, this time wiping away beads of water that fell begrudgingly from his eyes.
Lay the table with the fancy shit
Chapter 6.
Dean’s hair lay golden brown against his white pillow case, sticking in all directions from his ceaseless turning. Cas brought his hand to his own hair, running his finger up from the root, pretending he was touching Dean’s hair instead. Dean’s hair would be softer, lighter. It wasn’t rough and thick like Cas’s, or rather, like Jimmy Novak’s.
“I can’t make change.”
“Whaddya got there?” Dean asked softly, voice so different than the one he’d used with the cashier.
“Alright, sure” Dean put his hand palm-down onto the bar. “So you’re telling me this is popular with the locals then, this place?”
“You look like you’re not alright,” the girl added.
Oh. Oh. The words across the page stuck out as tired, lonely, and sad. Sam let the page drop away from his fingers. He took a step back, embarrassed to have read it in the first place, when it had so obviously not been for him. After a moment, with his cheeks slightly flushed, Sam picked up a second paper. As he’d guessed, this one was written in a similar fashion, addressed to the same person. Letter after letter, in Cas’s timeless handwriting, starting with the same singular word.
Will you forgive my soul
“How do you want me to do this?”
“Excuse me?”
“You did come back, Dean. You’ve come back to me.”
He stumbled into his own room, fell onto his own bed, and turned in one smooth motion to force his fist into the wall above his headboard. The impact of his skin against the wall worked to clear his mind, yet unfortunately, the thoughts that fell away in his new clarity were not the ones that he would have liked to see go.
A girl had gone missing. Cas knew from the picture of her face, the one from the website that Dean had printed off. He hadn’t seen the picture because of any desire on Dean’s part to show him; no, the only time Cas had gotten to look at it had been a quick glance as Dean had folded it up and slid it into his wallet.
Dean’s mouth fell open despite himself. “Oh, yeah. A’ course.” He looked past Cas, through the doorway, then shifted his gaze towards his hands. “So, then-”
I know that it's over
He tapped his socked toes against the floor, his whole body wanting to move but unsure what to do about it. He stayed seated on his bed, his bed that he shared with Lisa. He brushed the tips of his fingers along the material of her dress, laid out on top of the sheets. He traced across the lines of white lace with his eyes as the door to the bedroom swung open.
“Yeah, I guess,” Cas agreed hesitantly. “Heard from Sam lately?”
Dean’s loud, pleasure filled moan encouraged him and Cas moved his lips over his friend’s hungrily. They tasted the alcohol they’d been consuming for hours and they tasted each other. Cas’s tongue battled for dominance which Dean easily surrendered to him. Dean’s mind only wanted to feel, not fight or think. He only wanted to pretend someone actually cared about him for as long as he could. And, like he always did for those who loved him, he willingly submitted, letting them take whatever they wanted from him.
“What the hell was that for, you bitch?” he bit out angrily.
He opened the door and gave the delivery teenager money. He closed the door then set the pizza on the table before he went to get Cas. He was very hungry and didn’t want to wait to eat. He knocked on Cas’s bedroom door, not hearing the shower anymore.
Dean grumbled groggily, “Leave me ‘lone. Five more minutes.”
“If I remember correctly, you ended up taking care of me that night which means you stood her up, right?” Dean verified then demanded at Cas’s slow smile. “What?”
Cas shuddered briefly then pumped their cocks together while his lips captured and consumed Dean’s mouth. They both thrusted up into Cas’s firm grip. Cas worked and pumped their cocks together with a practiced rhythm that he normally could keep going for a while. But normally he didn’t have Dean gasping, groaning and withering beneath him.
“Talk,” Dean ordered, knowing somehow that it was Cas. “Don’t tell me that you miss me already. Who knew you were so needy?”
“In your dreams, bitch,” Dean snarked back with a huge smile.
“Said I was too straight-laced for her tastes because I wouldn’t . . .” Cas trailed off, wondering again why he was telling Dean all of this.
He paused then continued, “Look, I know you’ve been through a lot lately with Dad and all. Now, this hasn’t helped anything but, I want you to know, I’m here for you. Whatever, whenever you need me, just call or come by. Clear?”
“Stop hurting yourself, damn it,” Cas snapped.
Dean paused thoughtfully then wondered absently, “Was it?”
This time, Cas only held a hand down to him. Dean eyed the hand a long moment then snarked harshly, “Are you offering help or taunting?”
He fell quite squarely onto the hard ground, the jolt shaking up to his injured shoulder and his pounding head. He was almost grateful when his skull hit back against the floor, if only to let him rest for a moment. Something felt off, however. The ground under his head was… softer, somehow, than what the rest of him had landed on.
“Because I’ve known since you pushed me against the wall in the Green Room,” Dean said smugly.
“Dean, I don’t think you can-” Cas pulled out of their hug to criticize Dean to his face, but his gaze fell instead to Dean’s lips. This whole thing with Cas, the actually talking about it part, may have been entirely new, but Dean was well versed with someone eyeing his lips like that. He knew what that meant.
Dean tiled his head backwards again, to feel the cool press of the snowflakes to the flushed skin of his cheeks. “What is?”
“Dean, the case.” Cas said slowly, the words stiff. He moved his face closer to Dean, watching his eyes for a hint that somewhere in there Dean was listening to him. Any sort of sign that Dean had brought Cas along because he’d wanted him around.
“Oh why oh why,” Sam mocked the letter quietly, “do I feel so sad that Cas is dead?” He folded the letter back along its indents, but didn’t slip it back between the pages as he closed the book. “My good buddy, my best angel pal has been taken from me,” Sam continued as he lifted himself from his chair, “and I’m mourning him like a widow but I still can’t tell why this is hitting me so hard.”
Cas held his coat forwards once more, and this time the girl took it. She squeezed it between her hands before tucking it against her shoulder and leaning over once more. “Thanks,” she whispered as she closed her eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You ready to go, man?” Dean asked. As always, Cas was wearing his tan trench coat over a full suit, which would work fine for the party’s dress code. That was a bonus, as Dean wasn’t sure he could get Cas to change clothes if he’d tried.
And to think—Cas breathed out a rough laugh—to think that Dean may have wanted Cas around for any reason other than his help. As Cas spent time wondering what he meant to Dean, so did every human spend time thinking the same thing. Cas would be a fool to consider the future where Dean picked him out of every other countless option.
“Something like that,” Dean said. “Hey, hold onto that drink for me, ‘k? I’ll be back.” Dean flicked the bartender a grin over his shoulder, and descended from the bar stool. The weather outside had shifted towards rain, and Dean popped his jacket collar up as the bar’s door closed behind him. He could feel the raindrops already seeping into the denim.
Dean shuffled his weight between his feet. The snow crunched, and even its gentle sound was sharp in the snow's blanketing quiet. Although there was a road right beside them, and although there were people in the rooms facing them, all Dean could hear was the soft falling of snow onto the ground, and all he could feel was alone. Unwatched. Only him and Cas existed; the rest had fallen away. Had been buried under the snow.
So there was nothing to worry about, here, and nothing more sinister to focus on. Castiel could let himself forget, could focus on the ridiculously bright candy packages, or the laughing child a row over. He could let his thoughts stretch outside of the store, listen for the rumble as cars pulled in and out of the gas pumps. He could let himself be nothing, nothing, with the complete trust that Dean would retrieve him and bring him back to the world. There was a peace, in the gas station dollar store, that rebounded off of the white walls and traded between the beige and orange tiled floor.
And rightfully so, because when he had fallen, it had been straight down onto the unyielding ground.
Dean took the drink all in one go, then wiped the back of his hand over his mouth. “Hey, not bad for a little no-name bar like this.”
You're alive, so alive
“I’m going to find a way to bring you back, Cas,” Dean said, to Castiel, who may or may not have been able to hear him through his own stolen thoughts, or to the darkening world around them, or just to himself. “You’ve just got to hold on until I do.”
A brutal wind knocked Castiel’s beaten body into the cliff side. His hands stung with the cold, fighting to grasp between the cracks in the rocks, holding himself to the cliff face. Far below him, ocean waves crashed together as loud as thunder. The chilled, salty spray that was sent into the air with each wave blew in the wind, reaching all the way up to beat against Castiel’s back. His trench coat was soaked. He cursed his luck at having been so close to the drop-off when the demon had lunged at him.
Dean had prompted,
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
He reached for his knife once more, this time freeing it from his belt and holding it loosely around in front of him, circling it in his hands. The silver of the blade caught the light like splotches of blood.
Castiel visibly restrained himself from rolling his eyes. He turned his shoulder, reaching for the wispy white fabric of Lisa’s veil where it hung from the top of the mirror.
Castiel could have cried out with joy at the brush of air that puffed steadily from between Dean’s lips. In the dark, Dean’s face was only an outline, impossible to tell the extent of any injuries that he may have sustained by sight. But he was still alive, which meant that Castiel should be able to save him.
“Yeah, almost. Hang on a minute.” Dean forced himself to stand straight, pressing one hand against his pocket to check that
“Yeah, but-”
After a beat, he lifted his eyes, finally, painstakingly, to lock with Dean’s. The second that passed felt all at once like an eternity and like it was gone before it had begun. All too soon, Cas began to walk away. The desperate, emotional part of Dean’s mind cried out for him to say something, anything, to stop Cas from leaving. The larger, stronger part of his mind pushed the crying part down. The stronger part was made of anger, indignation, and fear.
“No, Dean, I did not tell them that you were
Yes, I'm doing better
Dean bowed his head forwards, his forehead falling against the mattress as his hands slid up to rest atop Cas’s chest. He closed his eyes tightly, bit his lips to stop the swear words that tried to crawl their way out. Finally, his voice muffled against the bed, he said, “I’m-”
Dean smiled into the kiss. He was so light he could have been floating. Happiness. He realized, this was happiness. He’d missed it for so long.
“Tell me,” Castiel repeated, whispering, “that you don’t want me.”
“You were gone for longer this time.” Dean breathed into Castiel’s mouth.
Dean sat back against his chair, finishing the rest of the bottle slowly. Maybe he’d help Sam on the vamp hunt. Maybe he’d even do a few more after that, but soon, if he didn’t find a way to bring Cas back, Dean was going to give up. He felt the fact of it open up inside of himself like a breaking dam.
“Cas…?” Dean’s eyes, half-open, trained slowly upwards.
“Yeah, her.” Dean’s free hand brushed up over his own shoulder, and ghosted down Cas’s fingers. Cas had, he only now realized, wrapped his arm around Dean’s back.
Dean dropped his head into his hands, squeezing his eyes shut as the pain throbbed. Cas lowered himself down beside him, his rings clinking against the pavement when he put his weight onto his hand. The morning was still hours away.
Beneath Castiel, Dean sputtered and choked. His breathes grew further apart. Castiel grasped his hands into the wet cloth of Dean’s shirt. He threw everything he had into the saving, the one thing he would always do. The one cause he would be always loyal to. He tried. His hands glowed weakly from his palms, the light more pale and washed out than the golden splendour of older days.
- Taylor Swift, closure
She watched him like Cas watched him. And in that moment Cas realized two things.
I will always be here if you need me. For as long as you want. As long as I can. If you need me, call out for me and I will come. Otherwise, I will leave you alone. You deserve to have me leave you alone. I have destroyed everything, Dean. I am sure that I will only do it again. I killed so many souls, so many angels. I feel their absence like a hole inside of me. When I took on Sam’s burden, it only magnified my pain. It showed me how much of a monster I became. I have no idea how you can even look at me. You saved me from a life of not being myself, and in doing so returned me to you. Do you regret it? I understand why you left me at the hospital; I wouldn’t have wanted to stay with me, either.
- Taylor Swift, coney island
“In that case,” Castiel replied. His breath was acid against Dean’s cheek. “I’m sorry.” He pulled away, and Dean released his hold around Castiel’s back. He grabbed him instead by the shoulders, holding Cas still so that he could take him. The light shining through the windows lit a white stripe across Cas's face, darkening the shadows even deeper by comparison.
Maybe Castiel was too sick to remember. Dean had heard of that happening, people so out of it that they forgot who they were talking to, or what year it was. Perhaps Castiel wasn’t even aware of the terrible things Dean had done, all of his selfish decisions. If that was the case, it would only be fair for Dean to excuse himself and let Castiel be watched over by someone who hadn’t hurt him.
Cas’s eyes opened marginally wider, and he shifted his gaze to Sam as if checking him for signs that Dean was joking. After a moment, Cas replied, “that won’t be an issue.”
“Oh,” the woman said, leaning one dainty wrist against the elevator handrail. “The guest list specified that we were waiting for two gentlemen. I assumed, from the way you were standing, that you were the couple on the list.”
His pockets produced a handful of coins—mostly pennies and dimes—as well as a fifty dollar bill. One of those options ought to do. He decided to wait for a few hours, and if the bus hadn’t come by then, perhaps he would have thought of somewhere to go on his own.
The worst thing was that the room, realistically, wouldn’t even look that different. Cas hadn’t slept, so his bed had always been unused, and he’d hardly had any possessions to either leave behind or take with him. The only real difference would be the knowing that Cas was truly gone.
Dean waited, each exhale tickling across Cas’s face. Cas tried to say to Dean,
Maybe I'll start giving little teasers for the coming chapters: next one, we're gonna see Cas struggling to convince himself of something he'd up until recently accepted as fact.
In the letter, Castiel did not seem to hold any grudge. Although Sam doubted he truly ever could, with Dean. The letter read:
Dean nodded, knowing that Castiel wasn’t really waiting for a response. They continued moving forwards through the fog, boots crunching on the gravel of the parking lot and stomping louder once they’d reached the road. They passed underneath the diner sign, the red lights casting blood-like shadows under Castiel’s eyes and into the dips of his cheekbones.
I'm never gonna love again
Chapter 4.
“Hey there. Looking for something?” She asked. Cas thought to answer her, but her attention was undoubtedly pointed towards Dean, who, for his part, rolled his shoulders back and gave her a sideways smile.
Song 2: champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Without raising his gaze from the blankets, Cas began to move off of the bed. His attention snapped to his own hand. Something warm and solid had pressed on top of it.
“Holy fuck,” Dean breathed. He let his head fall onto the mattress again, now for an entirely different reason. Colours and sounds began seeping back around him: the rustle of windchimes outside, the tapping of little paws against the floor below. A large, shaking breath fled from Dean’s lungs, pulling with it a low laugh. “Oh man, Cas. Shit.”
- Taylor Swift, long story short
Cas pushed himself unevenly upwards, trying to bring his face level with Dean’s. The position pulled painfully at the gashes in his abdomen. “Sam deserved to at least speak with her first, Dean.”
Yes, I do like to take some creative liberties re. Cas's grace and its abilities.
“And I’ve enjoyed hanging onto them, for the same reason.” Dean pulled Cas’s hand back out flat, and pushed the second ring onto his pointer finger. This one was thinner, a black band with a line of deep red circling along one side. It was made of minerals from the grounds of Hell. One ring to represent above, one for below, and somehow together they made Castiel think of him.
“I just meant, do ya' want to rest,” Dean rephrased.
The waitress’s dull eyes were open towards the ceiling. Dean shuttered as he finished stepping past her body. He’d almost had to kiss the thing—not that it would have been so terrible to kiss the waitress—but the thing wearing her face, he didn’t ever want to be that close to.
Song 15: evermore
“Okay, maybe it does look a bit tacky like that,” Dean moved closer to pull the red band from the hat, balling it up and shoving it into his pocket. Their chests were nearly touching. “Alright, that’s better,” he breathed.
Castiel’s blue eyes, which had always held such trust and clarity within them, were clouded with something unfamiliar and animalistic. Although the multiple sleeves that he wore (his trench coat, his suit jacket, his dress shirt,) covered the mark, Dean knew that it was digging into Castiel’s skin more and more every moment. He remembered, still, what the mark had done when it had been on his own skin, how it had shifted his vision until everything he’d looked at appeared to him like prey.
And the road not taken looks real good now
Cas’s hands held him steady. “You may feel groggy or tired, but you should try and stop yourself from falling asleep. You are recovering from seeing my true form.”
The rattling of glass shards against the cement floor meant that Sam had found the broom, and that he was cleaning up Dean’s broken bottle. “As long as it takes to bring him back,” Dean said against his arms.
Again, Dean looked to Sam for an assist and immediately regretted it. This time, Sam’s apologetic look was back, joined now by something like humour. Dean wanted to slap the look off of his face. He continued talking instead. “Charlie managed to hack into the system and get us one invitation, but,”
It was lucky that they had each other, the deer. If the mother hadn’t rushed her babies across the street, then the car that passed would have run right into them. The world was much easier to navigate with a family. At one point Cas had considered the other angels his family. That had been before he’d learned the true meaning of the word.
“I’m going to keep looking until I do, Cas. I promise. This is my fault and my failure, and I will keep lookin’ until I figure out how to bring you back. Don’t give up, okay Cas? You’ll see that stupid plant again yourself.” He managed to smile against his knuckles. “Alright, that’s all for now. Over and out, buddy.”
Should. Would have been able to without a doubt if he hadn’t lost most of his grace. If he hadn’t allowed himself to become so weak.
Castiel, if you’ve got your ears on, I’m sorry. I’m going to get you, okay? Just hold on a minute. Don’t get your feathers in a bunch, alright. I’m going to bring you back to me. I need a win, everything’s gone to shit, and the Nephilim baby that you fought so hard for is crazy powerful and we need your help with him. We can’t do this without you. I can’t do this without you.
Dean obliged, holding the shovel so tightly that his knuckles turned white as he dug the grave deep, deep into the earth. The Ma’lak box weighed too much for him to really be picking it by himself, but he couldn’t ask Cas to help drop his own cage into his own grave. He could hardly even stomach himself doing it. Every movement felt wrong, like he was breaking a promise.
don’t want to believe that that’s goodbye. I couldn’t watch as I threw the lighter, either. We’ll find a way to bring him back, and all the rest of them too. We’ve done harder things before. If we can fight God, Hell, we can bring Cas back.
(See the end of the chapter for
The gesture made Castiel feel better, slightly less antsy. He knew—he
“Uh, I guess because they are related to me, but that’s not really what you asked.” The girl tugged at her sleeve. “I know that I consider them my family because I love them, and although some days I’d rather have some distance between us, I wouldn’t want to live without them. I guess that I know they’re my family because I can tell that they feel the same way about me.”
“Don’t mind my friend, here.” Dean patted Cas roughly on the shoulder. “He doesn’t get out much.”
Ooh, but you won't like it that way
As if he could read Dean’s thoughts, Castiel pushed himself forwards, slipping his hands behind himself in an attempt to push away from his pillow. He lifted his head half way towards Dean’s, then was halted by a racking of coughs which sounded to have started deep in his chest and ended cutting through his throat. He bent forwards, hands in front of his mouth.

Someday soon, he would stand down from hunting. Without saving Cas, there was no point. No amount of saved lives would amount to that loss.
“Yes, I remember.” Dean dropped his hands from his face, eyes still closed. He was picturing the scene in the kitchen. Probably, Castiel was doing the same.
The follow-up to this chapter is now available in chapter 9: dorothea.
“Alright! Here we go.” Dean said, grinning as he walked around the side of the car. He thumped Cas on the back as he passed, and led them towards the bar. Cas’s shoulders tensed, and he pulled absently at his tie. He followed Dean.
“Dean-” He said softly. “Dean, that’s-”
“Dean, if she’s seen the angels here then maybe they have something to do with the missing girl.” Cas tried to make Dean listen, but Dean seemed to have forgotten that they were at the bar for a reason.
Dean let his legs carry him towards his car. He rubbed his hands together, thinking about the music he’d play on the ride back to the bunker. He slid his hands into his pocket for the keys, pressed them into the lock in the driver’s side door, and then used his free hand to knock against the side of the hood in exasperation.
When we burned his body I think I forgot to breathe. I don’t remember the smell of the smoke, or of the gasoline. I think of that night and it’s just his limp body in that curtain, how I had to tie him and leave him atop the pyre. I couldn’t even look at him, lying there on the kitchen table. I couldn’t look at his dead body. Couldn’t believe it was him, even though I saw him die. Fuck. I saw him die. That’s burned into my brain like a constant reminder. I don’t remember watching him burn. I only remember this knowing that he was gone, like a noise in the back of my head. He’s gone. He’s gone.
“The what?”
Cas stood in the doorway, lit from behind. His head was tilted to the side in an expression that Dean had learned to read as ‘fondly disappointed.’
The person outside the diner straightened themselves up, their silhouette shaped with wide shoulders and long legs. They stepped onto the sidewalk, moving underneath a streetlight. The lines and curves of their face were immediately familiar.
Thanks for reading!
He knew when it had ended because the withdrawing of the power threw him backwards, off of Dean and onto the ground some feet away. When Castiel looked towards Dean, the returned darkness appeared twice as dark in comparison. He could hardly see his own hand held out in front of his face. Castiel inched his way over the ground, still shaky, unsure if he was dead tired or frantically awake.
“Her name is Phoebe. She likes to sleep against the left arm rest of the couch.”
Epilogue: Dean still has a ways to go to prove to both himself and Cas that he won't take the relationship for granted this time, but as Castiel heals, so does their understanding of each other. They stay in the house that Castiel bought (the Impala finding a home in the two car garage), and even buy a second cat. Dean starts a little local law practice, and when he isn't busy helping clients, he takes long visits to the museum. No matter how grand the artifacts, there's always only one thing on Dean's mind when he walks through the museum doors; Cas is strict about taking time away from his job, but he can always spare a moment and a kiss for the man he waited for.
“Everything will be okay,” Cas mumbled into the ground. The wet rocks were somehow more comfortable against his cheek now than they had been before. His eyes dropped heavily closed. His fingers, which had been tensed, melted gently against the ground. “It’s okay now.” The last of his grace fizzled and died somewhere deep in his chest. Given to a better purpose than himself. "You're saved, Dean."
“Did she say where-” Dean cut Cas off with a wave of his hand.
Not actually nothing, of course: Cas’s room looked exactly like every other uninhabited room in the bunker, but that was what Sam always found so strange; Cas’s bed sheets were never rustled, his shelves never crowded with any sort of objects. The chair was still overturned as it had been for storage, and the lamp remained unplugged — everything about Castiel’s room felt vacant. No wonder he hardly spent any time in there.
The smoke that he blew out spiraled up into the air, only visibly different from the sky for a moment before it mixed into the foggy grey half-light. It was either early morning or late evening, impossible to tell the difference without a watch, and Dean’s was broken again. It clung, still, onto his wrist, the glass shattered and the hands unmoving.
Cas opened his eyes, not remembering having closed them, and was met by a pair of very worried, very intense green eyes hovering right over him.
As such, Dean was taking the opportunity to do what he wanted to do. If nothing mattered, then why would he make the effort to work all day? Watching TV in his pyjamas was fun. Dean Winchester deserved fun.
Jealous Cas tries to stop Dean from flirting with a barista while they work a case.
“Buy a drink first, then we’ll talk.” The woman gestured back behind her towards the bar.
Cas raised their joined hands up slightly and gave Dean a questioning glance.
After many false starts scratched out with a dark pen, Dean’s angled scrawl was legible. The lines were oddly spaced, as if written at different times, or in different bursts of thought.
Castiel took a step back, releasing his hold on Dean. He tilted his head back, gaze floating up towards the dark sky. Dean wavered and caught himself with the palm of his hand against the rough ground.
Perhaps Castiel had been slightly tipsy or adrenaline-drunk as well.
The barista returned to stand once more before them, having somewhat recovered her composure while serving drinks to another table. “Can I get you anything else?”
Castiel rolled his eyes. “If I hear that star drop while I’m gone, I’m eating the pie myself.”
“In a-” Dean turned one way, scanning the room, then flipped around to see the rest of it. “Have you seen a man in a beige trench coat? Dark hair? Dorky little guy?” He asked the bartender.
“No, I think,” Cas tilted his chin towards the wall where the Empty had been, as if not quite believing his own words. “The Empty was angry with Death for sending Jack there. Perhaps, after taking Death, it decided that it was satisfied.”
Dean pressed his nose into the glass as he tried to get a better look. He hadn’t seen snow in years, had never been far enough north. His heart slowed, calmed by some false association between snow and a family memory that had never actually happened. A day dream, a false memory, of the four of them, at Christmas time, drinking cocoa and putting on mittens and all that movie crap.
The hit of Death’s scythe against the ground echoed louder and louder, as if it was repeatedly being lifted and dropped right beside Dean’s ear. Finally, it stopped.
“I will not stay here against your wishes,” Cas said coldly.
Castiel pressed the cloth deep against his wounds, catching the breath of pain before it moved past his lips. Just look at what the notion of love had done to him! He pulled the cloth along the length of the wound, and dabbed it to the skin on either side. Catching his eyes in the mirror once more, Castiel was surprised by their watery state, like tears were seconds away from falling. “And anyways,” he reminded himself, “love is not your purpose.”
Cas’s eyes flicked upwards as he responded, the red lights turning his irises the colour of sin. “That I’m the reason for Heaven’s unwinding? No.” He shrugged one shoulder. “It’s not as if there are any bodies for them to use to identify me. Most of the higher ups are refusing to even acknowledge that an outside force is trying to bring them down. They’re trying to say that there’s some fault in the coding, or with the function. As far as most are concerned, no crime-”
Dean drew his eyebrows together and looked at Sam with all of the uncaringness that he could muster. If Dean didn’t succeed in stopping him, Sammy was going to try and say something all mushy about how he was allowed to feel sad that Cas left, or whatever. But it wasn’t Dean’s place to feel anything. Cas was a free man, he could do what he wanted. He was under no obligation to stay where Dean was.
Yes, it was good that Dean and Cas were getting some time alone. Maybe, if Sam had even a smidge of luck left in the universe, they’d talk some things out. Some big things. Some things that would mean Sam could go back to doing things for himself instead of acting as the buffer between his brother and the feelings that he wouldn’t dare say aloud.
“I haven’t told you,” Dean started. He toed the sleeve of his jacket again. “I don’t need to sleep tonight. I didn’t tell you, but, I’m tellin’ you now. I’m not tired, so we-” his mouth stopped moving. Dean swore he’d had more of a point when he’d opened it in the first place.
“Are you getting on?” Called the only person Cas could see. He sat on the far side of the machine, on a raised seat. The bus driver, it took Cas a moment to remember.
“Oh no, not at all! Most people arrived early. I wasn’t expecting to greet you at the door, but I just so happened to check as you arrived.” The woman paused as the elevator doors opened. Dean felt Cas’s arm in his pull as Cas began to move, but the woman stopped them. They still had many more floors to climb.
“You said it yourself, Dean: I can’t be trusted to make the right choices. I’ve changed. I couldn’t even smite a demon because of some… emotional hang up.”
It had been a rainy day, stormy enough that Dean’s phone was constantly forced to refresh the airline’s website and check if the flight had been delayed. Dean had decided that, for each hour the flight got delayed, he would drink four glasses of whisky. Castiel had called the decision laughably stupid.
“You left them over there ‘cuz they were muddy,” Cas replied as he motioned to the back door. Near the mat were his muddy boots. “Which vehicle do you want to take?” He took in Dean’s glare and sighed, “Why did I even ask?”
“Also, drunk? Or, high, maybe? Thought I smelled pot out there. Secondhand smoke is a really bitch, I hear, along with all that crap?” Dean retorted lightly but he could tell that Cas didn’t buy it.
“You, too. Dean,” Cas agreed.
“Shuddup and let go,” Dean snapped angrily, moving up to make Cas let him go. He couldn’t take Cas laughing at him right now. He felt too exposed and emotionally vulnerable to deal with it. In the back of his mind, it definitely creeped him out how much he did enjoy Cas and everything that they were doing to each other.
“No. Don’t want to . . . can’t talk . . ,” Dean evaded haltingly then gasped in surprise as Cas’s warm mouth surrounded his entire cock. Cas had sucked in every bit of his cock in an instant.
“Ever think that we might need to do it. That it might help with, with . . .”
“At the moment,” Dean offered noncommittally but it was the best he could do.
Dean would never actually admit it but that he didn’t really mind swallowing Cas and had really enjoyed it. It really worried him how much he hadn’t minded sucking or swallowing Cas. What really scared him was that he not only didn’t mind, hell, he enjoyed all this more than most of the times he’d had with women recently. Yeah, that really scared him. That, and the fact that he already wanted to do it again. Luckily, the alcohol allowed him to push the worrying fear away and ignore it at the moment.
“Like you ever follow through with your threats,” Dean goaded lightly. He knew that he was entering very dangerous territory but seemed to be unable to stop it. He didn’t really want Cas to follow through. Not really. Did he?
After the first few ladies, he felt his body stirring towards arousal. Of course, kissing all these ladies aroused him. That was natural. It definitely did not have anything to do with watching Cas kiss his ladies so leisurely, seeming to taste them longingly, like Dean liked to do. It wasn’t how Cas took possession of their mouths and slowly curled them into his massive frame, swallowing their smaller frames in the process. No, a certain part of his body didn’t just get stiffer at that thought because he was not gay.
The screaming stopped and a force shoved him down the stairs. He tried to control the fall down the stairs while making sure that he kept his gun and flashlight in their respective hands. His left shoulder hit the stairs hard. He went with it and rolled to his feet then threw his back against the nearest wall as he surveyed the scene. Of course, his shoulder didn’t appreciate that, judging by the burst of pain that exploded from it. He ignored it and surveyed the scene before him.
Cas frowned. “Dude, did you get clocked in the head?”
“She’d what?” Cas wondered with concern.
After a few minutes, Cas stated, “It’s done.”
“Or it could have been from any one of your exploits. You were damned detailed,” Cas reasoned. “Besides everyone knows that dudes don’t sit around watching pornos with other dudes unless they are gay.”
She glared and charged him again, bowling over Alfie and Kyle. He knew he didn’t have a lot of time but he’d been digging in his duffel as soon as he gained his breath. He managed to grab the salt when she slammed into him. He used the momentum to spin them so that he was on top of her. He gripped her jaw and forced her mouth open then poured the salt into her mouth.
The soft touch lightly explored his six pack definition and, though he tried to stop it, a soft, needful moan slipped past his carefully constructed walls. His eyes popped half opened to see Cas still his hand on Dean’s abs while he looked up at him. Dean breathed out huskily, “D- don’t . . . don’t stop It’s . . . good, so good.”
“She can’t keep that up,” McDonald argued.
Dean takes care of business
Sure, there had been bar maids and single chicks a plenty at first but soon it all got to be too much for him. Yeah, he could pretend that the chicks liked him, that they cared about him, that they thought he was something, was worth something, or even somebody. But after a while, it just took too much work to pretend anymore and he felt twice as bad afterward. The emptiness of it all threatened to consume him in a dark swirling abyss. It was especially hard when he kept remembering how everyone who was actually supposed to care for him, deserted him every chance they got.
That thought had Dean looked away from Cas quickly and move toward the truck with his head bent in shame. He’d corrupted his friend. How could he have done that? Was he really that screwed in the head? He needed to leave as soon as the game was over and not come back. Maybe if he stayed away from Cas, Cas could forget this . . . mistake.
“Too hard. Just a minor concussion. Haven’t even thrown up yet so it’s manageable,” Dean dismissed easily.
“Yep. Unless we bat for the home team,” Cas replied rhetorically.
“Don’t you think you might have a home field advantage here?” Dean observed dryly.
“Uh,” Dean stumbled slightly then cleared his throat and answered quickly. “Pizza’s here. I have everything set up in the living room. Figured we could watch TV while we ate on the couch, if that’s okay with you.”
Dean arched a questioning eyebrow. “I did okay then?” he questioned hesitantly, always needing praise, any kind of praise. “Better than the pierced chick.”
Lyle grinned at their ragging and told Cas, “I’ll be at the shop when you get there. Let me know if you need to leave early for practice.” Then Lyle held out his hand and thanked Dean, “That’s twice you saved my boys. You’re coming to dinner tonight after your practice. You need to meet the rest of the family. Too bad Steve isn’t here but I have a feeling you’ll get a chance to meet him yet.”
Kelly flashed a look of thanks to him before checking with Alfie who nodded in acquiesces. She relaxed slightly then tensed as Dean leaned forward and tapped her shoulder. She turned back again.
Kelly flinched then ran a hand through her hair and allowed slowly, “After the night I had, they would probably make an exception as long as I kept the number low. It’s worth a try.”
Cas’s eyes flew to Dean’s where he saw the gentle amusement there. He slugged him in the bicep, “I’m not gay, you dick. I didn’t mean. . . ”
Well, Dean had no freakin’ clue about that.
“Wha . . . What?” Cas stuttered then wondered, “You asked me something, did you?”
“Stop it,” Kelly yelled with her hands over her ears. “Just stop it. It didn’t happen. Hear me. It never happened. We just had a really bad trip, or something.”
“Yeah, and I had no intention of going but, I couldn’t, you know. I just couldn’t leave her if she needed help. I didn’t know I rushed in alone. Then the . . .  Ol’ Lady . . . she was just there and . . . “ Alfie trailed off with a shudder. He closed his eyes tightly then shook his head.
“What is it, Dean?” Cas wondered curiously as he cocked his head to the side in question.
“Whatever, bitch,” Cas mumbled softly against Dean’s ear, causing a slight shudder to flow down Dean’s body.
After a moment of no response, he turned his head to see if Cas had passed out. He saw Cas staring at something. He followed Cas’s eyes and saw them watching his resting hand. He smiled slightly and tested a theory. He slid his hand down and into the waist band of his jeans then rested it there. Cas swallowed hard, having followed Dean’s hand to where it now rested, before he glanced up to find Dean’s eyes on him.
“I can go for a burger and some darts or something. Need to get out of the house a bit,” Dean answered lightly then taunted, “That is, unless you need the rest, old man.”
Dean inclined his head slightly in acknowledgement while smirking then ordered, “Tell me Ol’ Lady H’s story.”
By then, Kyle had made his way up to the porch, having done the gallows walk on the way. His father turned to him and ordered, “Inside, boy, and you’d better not let your mother catch you smelling like a brewery.” Then he turned back and told them, “Night, Cas. By the way, who’s your friend?”
. He scratched his head, acknowledging his deep need for a shower before he did anything else.
Dean smiled and tightened them up for show while he answered lazily, “I have a routine that I do almost daily. I have a physically tough job and my dad was a Marine. If there’s one thing a Marine knows, it’s physical fitness. You have great def, too, Navy Seal.”
When they came, they felt even better than when they had checked out his head wound. His hands were rough and callused, like a typical working man’s hands, but he ghosted them over Dean’s injury with gently confidence and skill. The familiar soothing heat flowed from Cas into to Dean’s heart and soul. Dean had to stifle a pleasure filled moan that built up in him as well as trample down the need to arch into Cas’s touch. The slight pain Cas’s prodding caused helped Dean to control himself, but it was a hell of a lot closer than it ever should have been.
Alfie rolled his eyes, just like Cas did, which made Dean want to smile while the others nodded in answer. Alfie snapped, “School’s over. Been over for half an hour. We just heard. Did you do it?”
Kyle shook his head. “I . . . I don’t know. It got real quiet. Too quiet. I couldn’t take it anymore. We called to them, but they never answered.”
He considered Cas for a moment then offered softly, “Look, if you want to test them out, you know, touch them, it’s cool. Like I said. We’re friends. Just ‘cuz we’re guys doesn’t mean there can’t be any touching as long as we don’t talk about it afterward. Ever watch a game, any kind of game, those guys pat each other on the ass all the time. It doesn’t mean anything.”
Cas quirked an eyebrow with a slight smile on his face. “Making excuses already? You really that much of a pussy?”
“Whatever, pretty boy. Keep it up and you’ll be Deanie before you know it,” Cas threatened menancingly.
“Cas,” Dean greeted back as Cas sat down beside him and ordered a beer and a burger.
Dean grimaced slightly as his ribs protested his current upright position. He didn’t think anyone noticed but, the next second, McDonald told Kyle, “You need to get these two home before they get in more trouble then come home yourself, you hear me? That boy there looks dead on his feet.”
Cas shifted slightly and muttered with embarrassment, “Nothing.”
McDonald greeted them, “Dean, Cas. What are you boys doing out here?”
He really should have stayed in that motel room, in that last godforsaken town. Memories of the last time he was this drunk returned to him. He knew if this didn’t work out, he was very close to a repeat.
“So,” Cas started off slowly. “Alfie says you saved his life back there. That the ghost was going to get him.”
“You ruined everything, you bastard,” she hissed in an eerie voice while she tightened her grip on his throat.
“Yeah, cheeseburger, fries and a beer,” Dean ordered then found himself a seat at the end of the bar. His food arrived without much of a wait and he dug in. He’d finished and was on his second beer by the time Cas walked in the door.
“Dude, she threw you headfirst into a wall. I heard the impact. She also threw you down the stairs and across the front yard. Twice. It’s obvious that you’re in pain,” Alfie argued, now truly worried as he remembered the events of the evening. “Then she also choked you when she . . . aw, shit, what the hell actually happened out there, Cas?”
By the time Dean had controlled his pain then slowly sat up, he saw that the three teens from last night were in Cas’s living room staring at him. He frowned and wondered vaguely, “Shouldn’t you guys all be in school or something? Is everyone okay?”
“Wanna bet,” Dean dared. She charged and he blasted her with a load of rock salt.
“I’ve asked Cas but he wasn’t in the house, according to him. Only you were and he heard gunshots inside there. I know Alfie didn’t have a gun so what exactly were you shooting at? A ghost?” Lyle listed off categorically. “Plus, that boy never had a nightmare in his life but screamed a bloody fit that night so I want to know what exactly happened to him.”
Since Dean wasn’t kissing him, he leaned down and gently licked over the top of Dean’s cock. Dean jerked up into a sitting position but Cas stopped him halfway with a huge hand to Dean’s chest. He pressed Dean back down to the couch as his hot mouth engulfed Dean’s swollen cock and he sucked on it hard.
Before Cas could answer, Dean slapped him on the back and winked conspiratorially, “’Course he is. He still has a Monte Carlo to take care of, right? In fact, just give me the keys and I can wash up then meet you at the garage.”
“Resting. Time to lay into the young’un,” Dean directed wearily.
“Yeah. I’m good. So, haven’t heard from your dad yet?” Cas answered casually.
“Watch your language,” Cas scolded, completely avoiding the rest of the questions.
“In a small town, we’ll find out,” Cas taunted knowingly.
“We do,” Lyle agreed and they all nodded. “But no one’s ever been trapped inside before. I mean, some say they saw her. Others said they heard her. But no one’s ever been hurt by her before.”
Dean grinned up cockily and admitted, “Obviously. Not so bad yourself. Besides, you started it this time.”
, he realized with a sloppy grin, enjoying the endorphins in his system.
Cas reached down and grabbed Dean’s cock while he gave Dean a long penetrating kiss. He firmly caressed Dean’s cock. Dean moaned softly and gently thrust up his hips into Cas’s hand, needing more friction.
“Technically, she was, about a hundred years ago,” Cas amended then surmised correctly, “You pissed her off to get her focused on you. Just like that bar fight two months ago.”
did it and I just want to know why the hell you didn’t take help with you. You are injured and she could have . . .” Alfie trailed off unpleasantly.
Cas grinned wide and asked seriously as his voice got deeper with each word, “Excellent. So what do you want to do first? Pool or should I teach you some respect?”
“From what I remember, being a teenager is reason enough. Your dad’s health, you being away and the problems that happened after might have all piled up on him. Now that you’re back, he has the freedom to let loose again,” Dean hypothesized softly.
McDonald argued, “Suit yourself but I’d say you’ve already done more than your share, just saving those kids. Probably should rest your ribs. How’d you get those bruises on your neck anyhow? She strangle you or something.”
Dean paused as he moved into a better position over Cas’s groin. He gently gripped Cas’s thick, engorged shaft, surprised that he was barely able to surround it with his hand. He gave a soft appreciative whistle. “Damn, Casy. I thought I was big. Man, I bet the women love you.”
He leaned over and lightly lapped it up with his tongue. Cas bucked up, trying to enter Dean’s warm moist mouth, and his hands came down to grip Dean’s short hair. Dean savored Cas’s flavor for a second before wanting more but he also wanted to see the reaction in Cas’s eyes when he did.
Cas gave him a wide smile. “Thank me by helping me kick butt on Saturday.”
“Just wondering how you get such definition,” Cas answered honestly but also adlibbing some. “How many crunches do you do and how often?”
Cas glanced back, replying, “Yeah. Why? Thought all you youngsters were into the electronic information age.”
Why Dean was checking Cas out now, he had no idea. Dean never really looked at Cas that way because he still was not gay. But he watched the women all turn their eyes toward Cas as he entered the room and Dean could definitely tell that Cas was probably what they considered attractive. Dean was nowhere close to gay but he knew that Cas was definite competition for Dean.
Dean shrugged as he answered over his shoulder. “I was hoping to scare the bitch. But I made sure I had a clear shot before I did it. And I got them out so why not drop it and move on?”
“Here. Drink,” Dean ordered firmly. She stared at him with surprised suspicion. He smiled reassuringly and told her honestly, “It’s just water.”
“Can it, wiseass,” Cas scoffed then ordered, “Put me on speaker.”
“You got that right,” Cas concurred with a knowing glare.
“Dean, let’s find out for ourselves who the best kisser is,” Cas whispered huskily a second before he gave in to the drunken urge to see what those awesome lips tasted like. Finding out what it was like to kiss Dean had been driving him crazy since that first night at Mel’s. He didn’t even think of waiting for a response, instinctively knowing that Dean was more than willing to do this with him.
, he thought sarcastically.
Dean sighed heavily, remembering the other set of bones he’d uncovered. He’d put them all together to burn, just to make sure since he wasn’t a forensics expert. He ran a hand through his hair nervously.
Dean walked into Mel’s sports bar in the middle of Nowhereville and took off his sunglasses while he gave the room a quick once over. It was almost four in the afternoon on the second day and he was starving. He glanced around the bar but didn’t see Cas so he wandered over to the bar to ask the bartender since Cas seemed to be something of a regular around here if their conversations were anything to go by.
Dean nodded and grabbed up his other stuff before heading to the stairs. He motioned Alfie up first but then the ghost appeared on the steps, causing him to back up. Before he could do more than a step back, Dean blasted her away again.
When Dean knew he was nearing the bottom, he pushed away from the wall and tried to land on the balls of his feet like he was taught then rolled back to help distribute the force. It still hurt like hell. Dean cursed then heard the hissing seconds before he saw the strike coming. He jerked back just in time and jumped to his feet, pulling his pearl handled colt. He quickly shot the snakes he could see in the head then fumbled for his flashlight in his pocket. He immediately turned it on and checked for anymore threats. He saw another snake slinking away. He shot that one too.
.” Then he opened his eyes and told Cas honestly, “Really not gay. Never, you know, experimented or anything with a guy before. Never wanted to really. But you, wanted you, wanted to see, taste . . . Guess I finally got drunk enough. Just didn’t want . . . no women. Not tonight.”
“Need someone to what?” Cas wondered softly as he inched toward Dean’s face.
“That the best you can come up with? Dude, you so need rest,” Cas insulted. “See ya tomorrow.”
Dean glared at him and stood up slowly before he warned harshly, “Well, right now, I’m thinking you need an attitude adjustment, buddy boy, so pipe the hell down. Now what the hell are you talking about?” Alfie pulled back slightly and shifted uneasily under Dean’s warning.
Dean shrugged noncommittally. “Does it matter?”
He had passed drunk about two beers ago with the help of the now empty bottle of Jack on the table. He felt the bottle in his hand and took another long pull before letting the bottle rest in his hand on the couch.
Cas turned to the girls and lined out his plan. “Excuse me, ladies, but do you want to help us with something?”
“I’ll bet,” Alfie concluded.
Dean gave a half shrug, protecting his injured side. “Could be a bit of both, plus, that supposed angsty teen drama stuff. God knows, Sammy went through more than his share of that crap. Used to drive me up the freakin’ wall, all the damn drama and wearing the hair shirt shit.”
Unable to believe he could actually smile after everything; Dean released a deep breath that he hadn’t been aware he was holding then let out a slightly wet laugh. “Yeah, nothing like. Course, if I’d even been smart enough to make it, I’d have flunked out by now because of that. Still wouldn’t mind going to one to see if it’s like
thought about this, in detail.”
“Sleep,” Dean retorted instantly.
Cas looked into Dean’s eyes through the rearview mirror and admitted slowly, “I never thought of that but, now that you mention it that was about the time he started acting out. I thought it was because he didn’t like me coming in and taking charge.”
Alfie groaned, “Just who the hell is he, Cas? I don’t remember you ever mentioning a Dean.”
Cas gave a husky laugh then observed with heated satisfaction, “Automatically assuming the submissive. I like. I really like, De.”
Frantic pounding on the door snapped Dean into an upright position that set off his ribs. He groaned and fell back as he tried to breathe through the pain.
He stared at the gun again, as if, noticing it for the first time all over again. Half of him wondered what he planned on doing with it. The other half wondered what was taking him so freaking long to do it.
“What do you mean?” Cas wondered in confusion.
“As far as you know,” Dean muttered sardonically.
Dean pulled up, twisted and squeezed a little harder this time, cutting off Cas’s question. Another shudder passed through Cas. Dean focused on the head of Cas’s cock but glanced over at Cas in confusion. “What do you mean?”
“Wouldn’t what? Oh, man, tell me you did
“You’re such a girl,” Dean snarked lightly as he let his hand slide down Cas’s torso, enjoying the contact. Contact with someone he knew cared about. He needed that so much and Cas’s skin was soft and warm. Cas’s muscles spasmed slightly as his hand passed over them.
Dean smirked slightly, having caught the relief in the boy’s eyes. No one wants to be alone after something like this, Dean knew from experience. He slowly lowered himself into the ’68 red mustang. He took the keys from the boy next to him and started the car, having heard Cas start up his truck already. Dean’s cell phone rang so he got that out of his pocket and answered it as he put the car in gear.
Dean chuckled softly in response while he cursed softly under his breath. He was torn between amusement and pain. It seemed no matter what was going on, Cas always managed to amuse him.
“Yeah, right, like that’s going to happen,” Dean snapped sarcastically while he smiled and shook his head at Cas’s antics.
“Water,” Cas advised him as he held out a bottle to him.
, Dean observed with satisfaction at finally being able to touch it like he’d been wanting to.
Cas sighed as he observed Dean’s panicked worry. “Well, yeah.” He drawled out slowly and saw Dean’s shoulders slump slightly then he continued softly, “cuz now that I know what you can do, with your lips, your mouth and your body. I know what all of you feels like against me. I’m getting a hard on just looking at you and remembering.”
Cas motioned with one hand behind himself. “A party game where one person decorates another with garland, lights, and plastic ornaments. Greg said that it is the highlight of the night.”
“What?’ Sam called after him. When Dean didn’t answer he turned to Cas. “What’s his problem?”
“So I win, then.”
Cas’s retreat was that of a surrender, no fight, no yelling. There had been times when Dean, also out of anger, had pushed Cas against the wall, yelled at him, and confronted their disagreements with violence. That had been for mistakes much smaller than this, than killing Mary. This time, Dean’s anger only made him silent. It rendered him speechless.
Even Sam, leaned against the passenger-side door, reading something on his phone, appeared in monotone colours. Cas started towards him, but Dean caught at his elbow, pulling him to the side. It was the contact that Cas had been waiting for, and he leaned into it, allowing Dean to lead him a ways down the side of the building.
Dean sighed. He couldn’t believe that Cas was right. “It’s to play the damn party game.”
Chapter 8.
Dean brought his hand back towards himself, and flipped over to lay his head on his pillow. Staring at the ceiling, Dean’s memory supplied him with replay after replay of Cas’s face as he’d turned to look one last time. Cas’s eyes, always large and sad, had appeared especially sad, especially sorry. His eyebrows had been turned up, as if he’d been asking a question.
“It would be odd for me to suggest that you were having relations with someone else, as people here think we are together. Or did you forget the cover?”
encompassed too much of himself to be able to escape it.
Sam comes across secret letters and realizes that his brother's feeling for Cas may be more complicated than he'd thought.
“When I had the mark, I still couldn’t hurt you,” Dean said unfairly.
“The Empty took Death, and then,” Cas frowned. “And then it left.”
Song 13: marjorie
“Sam, stop!” Dean called, as loud as his tired lungs would let him. Castiel kept pace beside him, despite his bruises. As they ran past the windowed door of the diner, a head of dark hair sat herself down at the bar. Ruby—the demon who let Sam drink her blood.
Dean’s body was stiff where it lay against the cold ground. Castiel placed one hand on either of Dean’s shoulders, sending one leg over top of him so that he straddled Dean’s torso. He slid his hands over Dean’s chest, feeling more than seeing the torn fabric, the sticky blood from his wounds, and underneath that, the shallow rise and fall of each breath.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam unfolded Dean’s letter and slipped it between Cas’s inside of the manila envelope. It did not stick out as obviously different with all of the pages pressed together in the confined space. Possibly, Cas wouldn’t even find it.
“We are on our way to investigate a murder in Arizona.”
“Oh, it’s just you,” Dean dropped the knife down, then took a second to conceal it on his person once more. He was slow to raise his gaze back to Castiel’s face.
Yes, I'm doing better
“Yeah, but I’m pretty sure I got some drool on your coat, so you can pretty much tell me anything now.” The girl shrugged. She slid her backpack along the floor as she moved a seat closer to Cas, one empty spot still between them. Her bag was open at the top, just enough for Cas to catch the title on her textbook: 12th grade Economics. She was still in high school.
Dean’s thoughts circled on loop.
Cas’s ‘fond disappointment’ grew as he pursed his lips and tilted his head even farther. One of these days, he was gonna pull something in his neck, Dean was sure of it.
“Did ya' think I’d forget?” Dean asked as he reached into his pocket for the second ring.
This was... fluff? I wrote something with more fluff than angst?? Wow guys, better enjoy it while it lasts.
Cas ran a hand absentmindedly over the gashes in his shirt, and replied, “I’m an angel of the Lord, Dean. I’m sure I’ll manage.”
Cas left. All Dean would hear would be a flap of his wings, and then he’d be free to forget all about what had happened. Cas took himself to where Dean couldn't follow, stepping quickly through the gates of Heaven and continuing towards the offices of his superiors. Right now, Heaven had to win his loyalty. There was no other possibility.
“They’re all I have,” Castiel answered, his voice nearly lost under the wind and rain.
“Congratulations on your wedding,” he said, fake-brightly. And then the door was opened, and he was gone. He was gone. Dean sat back on the bed, his face in his hands. The chime on his phone, counting down hours until the ceremony began, chimed once. A ripple of laughter drifted through the closed window. Dean allowed himself five minutes to grieve, then he stood, slid his tie from the dresser, and continued to get ready. He couldn’t meet his own eyes in the mirror as he flipped his shirt collar up and settled the tie around his neck.
I don't need your closure
“Why won’t they heal?” Dean asked, letting his words fizzle into the thick air. Castiel had, at one point, been untouchable. Neither bullet nor blade had been able to leave a mark, and if anything had, his celestial power would have healed it within seconds.
Cas’s eyes tightened, their gaze never faltering. His expression sent a ripple of fear through Dean--not because Cas looked worried, but because he looked the opposite. Cas’s eyes shone with a vibrant happiness, as if his whole world had come together. Why did he look like that? Why now?
As if the thought had burned him, Cas pulled his hand quickly away from himself. He leaned forwards, setting his forearms onto his knees, and forced himself to remember Heaven’s plan. He was amazed by how little, in that moment, he cared to follow their orders or to listen to their warnings. Heaven already suspected that Cas was growing too faithful to Dean.
As quickly as it had come, the light vanished, the darkness pulling back in like water thrown over a fire. The lightning fizzled through the air. It struck its mark, and Castiel’s breath was thrown from his lungs. His insides shook, pulsed, alighted. He opened his eyes and could only see white static. His back felt as if it were on fire.
“Awesome,” Dean said hoarsely. He leaned heavily against the wall as he lifted himself to his feet. His footsteps echoed too loudly against the cement floor with every step. He brought himself to where the Empty had appeared, and traced one finger down the lines of the bricks. “How do we know that it won’t come back and get you later?”
“But it’ll be safer if we go as a group.” Cas’s head was tilted to the side as he tried to read more information from Dean’s face. Dean squirmed under the scrutiny.
“I’m sorry I doubted you, Dean,” Cas said, making sure that his eyes were locked with Dean’s the entire time.
Did you feel my rage towards Cas's ending in this? Bc I sure did. He deserved to know that he was loved, damnit!
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas was close enough for Dean to hear his breathing. Dean was overwhelmed by a whole new spinning sensation as he eyed the reflection of the Christmas lights in the glass door. He ended up passing his phone to Cas for the invitation, while Dean’s mind rebooted. Too many bright lights around him for him to think straight.
Dean moved his hand to cup behind Cas’s head, and brought their faces closer. He closed his eyes as their lips pressed together. Somewhere against the floor, Dean’s phone buzzed. He let it ring.
Cas’s hand had moved on from Dean’s hair to rub soothing circles into his back. “You would have come all this way just to say goodbye?”
Dean slept in a cold bed, and he didn’t get any opportunity to mess everything up by asking Cas to lay with him, because Dean had messed everything up in an entirely unexpected, unanticipated way instead. He hadn’t seen it coming, hadn’t known to stop it. Apparently, the
Dean licked his lips, and dropped his gaze to the drink she had poured for him. Cas slid off of his bar stool and fixed his trench coat around his shoulders. Dean only noticed him when he started to walk away.
There is one other thing that I’ve been devoting a significant amount of thinking to. This one was in the back of my mind even before I walked into the river and died, but I’ve never allowed myself to think of it before. It’s wrong. I still know that it’s wrong. It’s not in the plan. But you see, Dean, the plan is imperfect. Isn’t that hilarious! The plan, which I have devoted my centuries and centuries of life to is imperfect! Incomplete!
Dean closed his eyes and let them stay closed as he finished off his cigarette. Sammy had been better, recently. Or he’d become better at hiding it. Dean’s attention to his little brother hadn’t been what it should be, lately--too many other things on his mind. The rumble of a semi down the road shook into his bones and a weight landed heavy against his chest, pinning him against the wall. Dean smiled against his teeth.
This pain wouldn't be for
Comments and kudos always greatly appreciated. <3
“I command you to look at me,” a deep voice boomed, at once coming from everywhere and nowhere. It was easy to discern from the shrieking, however it did not quiet the noises in any way. The wind continued to howl and billow, circling Dean as if he'd been caught in the middle of a tornado. The rain pelted him from all sides, harsh and stinging. His breath caught in his raw throat. He forced his eyes open and raised his head.
“You were supposed to stay in your seat,” Cas said without turning.
Dean stepped up to Cas, leaving less than a foot between them. “I’ve never known what to say, Cas. Each time I thought about telling you, the words got all twisted up, or I talked myself down. But I know, I know that when I say, ‘I love you too,’ I mean, ‘there was no way in Hell that I was letting you die without getting to tell you that,’ because I want you to know, man. You deserve to know. Even if I can’t frickin' say it.”
What died didn't stay dead
Dean turned over in bed loudly, moaning indistinguishable words into the pillow before settling in again. Because of how he’d turned, he lay facing away from Sam, towards the wall. He’d pushed himself onto one side of the bed, leaving a large empty space in front of him.
“Cas,” Dean said, the beginning of a plan on his lips.
“You’re not…” Dean had received the phone call when Cas had been rushed to the hospital. Apparently, he’d never been removed from Cas’s phone as the emergency contact. All Dean had known was that Castiel had collapsed on the street. He’d just assumed… Dean had left in the Impala immediately, completing the six-hour drive in four and a half. He’d thought he was running out of time.
Castiel is wary of allowing Dean to help him after he's hurt on a hunt (ft. Cas accidentally bursts some light bulbs).
I have gone off track. I apologize. I have so much to apologize for, don’t I. Here’s one more thing to add to the pile, then: I’m sorry that I love you. I haven’t allowed myself to write it out until now. There it is, now. Words on a page.
I'd think you were still around
Dean tightened his arms around Cas’s strong back. He bunched the thick material of the trench coat within his fists. He followed Cas’s slow sways back and forth, let him turn them a quarter ways around, then around again. Their footsteps left tracks in the snow, overlapping and uneven.
“Well, yeah. If they do, they could call for more to arrive and help them, or leave with hostages instead of attacking them here where we could stop it.”
She’d agreed to leave with him after her shift, the product of some well-timed winks and flirty one-liners on his part. Dean had planned to wait until they slipped somewhere private to make sure that his hunch was right. She’d tried to kiss him as soon as they’d made it five steps from the bar. Man, that had been a close one.
Song 7: happiness
“Look up.” Cas’s fingers gently wound their way around Dean’s neck, and ever so slowly tilted his head back. Dean’s eyelashes fluttered as snowflakes brushed past them. His eyes adjusted, pointed right up at the sky. He felt that he’d fallen into a world where everything was softer, where that pain that always thrummed just out of his reach was less painful.
As Cas took his damn sweet time, Dean’s teeth worked into his lip until he almost made it bleed. His foot tapped back and back against the tree. He threw his arms up as Castiel finally approached, hissing “I told you 7:10 am.”
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
Chapter 15.
Cas rides a bus and talks to a stranger while running away from the bunker.
“Don’t you have other people who should be here?” It came out sharper than Dean had intended, and his tone wiped the happy smile right off of Castiel’s face. Dean regretted his words immediately. “I didn’t mean— I just-”
Now you hang from my lips
And there is happiness
No, no body, no crime
. I miss him. I don’t know what to do.
Have you seen the flowers? This time of year, I have found, they are at their most glorious. The red ones, in the garden of the hospital, they have five petals each. The petals are yellow on the inside. I would have never noticed it, because you can’t tell unless you’re looking right down into them. I was following a bee, a great bit one, all yellow, and it landed in one of those flowers. How lucky! I looked right down on into it, and I saw the bright yellow smiling back up at me, like the kind, bright summer sun.
Cas let the bunker’s door close behind him, and lifted his face up towards the evening light. His mouth opened slightly, drawing in a shaky breath of the cool air and then closing once more. Inside the bunker, through the door he’d hated to close behind himself, Dean was probably still standing against the table, silently raging. The anger that was inside of him, Cas wished he could pop it like a balloon, give it space to seep out of him. Dean was not himself, and he hadn’t been for weeks.
Dean brushed snowflakes from Cas’s trench coat, once, twice, his fingers never straying far from the firm curve of Cas’s shoulder.
That would've loved you for a lifetime
What died didn't stay dead
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Cas’s eyes tightened as he considered. “Distract?”
It looked so simple for the beings on Earth. Love was not only for the humans; animals cared for each other, Castiel had seen, as a mother bird had risked her own time and energy to care for her young. To teach them how to fly. No one had been there the first time Castiel’s wings had lifted him from the ground. No one had been there to tell him, “it’s okay if you’re scared of falling, because I will be here to catch you.”
“Aw, man,” Dean mumbled. He pressed his pointer finger solidly into the volume button for a few seconds, then collected all of the spilled cereal that he could easily reach into his hands. He debated for a moment, before shrugging and spilling the cereal from his hands into his mouth. His blankets were clean enough.
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
“'You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again,’” Cas said. “Homer. Ἰλιάς. The Iliad.”
Dean's frozen fingers couldn't possible hold around Cas any tighter. “You don’t mean that, Cas,” Dean said. Snowflakes caught in his mouth as he spoke.
The screeching quieted slowly into a low hum, vibrating through Dean’s bones. He lowered his hands from his ears, pressing them instead into his thighs. He blinked, prepared himself, and returned his gaze to the glowing form. It now looked like a human, no taller than Dean himself. The glowing rays behind it, stretching to either side like wings, dissipated into the rain, the light drawing back in.
Cas flipped his middle finger up over his shoulder, his black gloves nearly blending into the skyline. Dean sighed, pulled the ring box from his pocket, and flicked it open. Lisa’s ring, that Cas had been holding onto; its white stone shone a buttery yellow in the sharp morning light. Dean slipped it into a different, deeper pocket. He rubbed his bare hands together, trying to warm them, and watched his breaths form small clouds. When his watch read 7:30, he returned to his car.
I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
“Cas,” Dean said, hovering the thing he’d gotten from the store up towards their faces. “You remember where we’re goin’, right?”
He arrived next to Cas just as the angel sliced the head from a second vampire. Dean blocked an attack at Cas from behind. The vampire grabbed Dean by the shoulder, pulling him forwards. Dean ducked out of its grasp and used his momentum to spring back up and cut its head from its shoulders. He killed his second one easily moments after.
His throat was raw as he drove the Impala back, the trailer bobbing behind and reminding him, at each turn and each bump, of his failure. Of his misery. He’d ignored Sam’s attempt at a conversation upon returning to the bunker. He’d locked the door to his bedroom and fallen onto his bed and had stayed like that for some amount of days.
Dean’s shirt was damp and malleable, shaping underneath Cas’s hands as he pressed them down into Dean’s chest. He kept his eyes closed, letting his head knock forwards. He focused on sending health and healing into Dean, trying to burn up the last traces of his grace to do so. He could feel it within him, fighting against his demands, clinging to Castiel. He pushed for it to leave him, to bleed out through his fingers.
“I think it would be difficult,” the girl said slowly, “to get to that point of understanding and trust with someone if they didn’t feel something similar for you.”
. He couldn’t see anything, not anything, and then his eyes adjusted. In the faint light shining through the other windows, little flecks fell through the air. They twisted and fluttered, but fell unmistakably downwards. They were made of something light, slower moving than rain drops. They stuck to the ground where they hit.
Consider this my take on their dynamic in the Tombstone episode (13x6).
Humans looked like that when they… Cas tried to think. His memory supplied him unhelpfully with an instance last week, when he and Dean had been waiting while Sam paid for their food. They’d stopped for burgers after completing a case. Cas had offered to leave, as their work was done and he didn’t eat, anyways.
Dean’s thumb stoked down Castiel’s cheek, over his mouth, and dipped into the crevice between the top and bottom lip. Castiel started to part his lips just as Dean continued his thumb on downwards. Dean’s fingers tingled at the contact, remembering when he’d had even more of Castiel’s skin to touch. He pressed his thumb into the indent in the center of Castiel’s chin, drew it over his jaw, and pulled his hand slowly away.
“Goodbye, Dean,” Cas said, because apparently the stupid angel still thought Dean was going to let him say all that and then sacrifice himself. Cas grabbed Dean’s shoulder firmly. He started to push Dean aside, out of the path of Death and the Empty. He would leave himself completely open to both.
Being with Cas wasn’t the same but, at the same time, it was because Dean was able to relax and let go. Not worry about reputations, being tough, being, well, the image that Dean had made for himself. And the best part was that Cas let him.
Dean laughed lightly then evaded, “Just making a point. Seemed to hit a nerve there, asshat.”
Dean smiled wickedly then surmised enthusiastically, “Guess we have to have another contest, huh, baby?”
that. It’s just . . . aw, hell, I don’t know. It’s just not what I want right now.”
Dean sat up slightly, drawing in as deep of a breath as he could. He grabbed the bottle and took a large chug then filled his glass. He heard Cas moving around in the kitchen, so he took the opportunity to lean over and calm his body down.
“It’s Sunday night. About ten o’clock my time.”
Dean shot his eyes back over to Cas and couldn’t help noticing Cas’s groin swelling again. Dean smiled widely and commented, “You know, with the limited room we already have, you don’t need to get any bigger.” Cas grinned widely as his cock filled more under Dean’s interested stare. Dean gave a put upon sigh and grumbled playfully, “Guess I have to something about that, huh? You know, since you won’t.” Dean ignored the fact that his own cock had woken back up and was now swelling too.
He led the sheriff to the grave, knowing all the while what would happen when he saw it. He stopped beside it and waited. The sheriff observed dryly, “Well, now, it looks like this has been dug up recently.”
Dean grimaced slightly before he dismissed, “In the house but no biggie. It only sounded bad because it was right next to you, half-pint.” Alfie looked like he wanted to argue but Dean shut him down. “No hospital. Just need some Tylenol and rest. I’m good.” Dean shot his eyes over to meet Cas’s in the mirror before he added firmly, “Seriously, dude. Still up for the game, too. No worries.”
“What? Why?” Dean demanded with confusion.
“Do over,” several of them yelled which was quickly followed by laughter. Both Cas and Dean laughed at that as well.
Dean’s smiled grew wider as he teased lightly, “We? Or you, Casy?”
Dean smirked back, “That’s what you think. We’ll see what you say tomorrow when I kick your ass.”
“Sir?” Dean replied uncertainly.
to win back the rest of your money.”
“Did Amber have blonde hair and blue eyes? Like Kelly?” Dean prodded gently. The father nodded solemnly which caused Dean to sigh. “According to what the ghost said to Kelly, the woman her husband replaced her with looked just like them. Petite, blonde, young, blue eyes. That’s why . . . “
“Remember last night when I told you that some people had tried to burn the house before but it didn’t take?” He started then waited for everyone to nod before continuing. “Well, that ain’t exactly accurate. People have burned the house before and watched it burn to the cellar. But, first thing the next morning the house is back, just like it looked the night before it burned. It’s never been gone more than twenty-four hours. So, there’s no way of knowing if it took until tomorrow morning.”
“Are you tired?” The emphasis on each word suggested that Castiel rather liked to be the one asking this question, instead of the other way around.
“I’m fine, Sam.” For whatever reason, Sam had decided that Dean was going to have some sort of problem taking Cas as his plus one. Obviously, Dean was perfectly capable. “Besides, out of the two of us, who looks more likely to have been invited to a swanky Christmas party, huh?” He nudged Sam in the ribs with his elbow. “Huh?”
Dean’s back had always been a sight to behold — lean muscle, broadened over the years, now as usual covered in layers of shirts and a coat. But as he straightened it and rolled his shoulders back, leaning one hand onto the counter of the poor cashier, he became a version of himself that Cas hadn’t seen in a while; he became a glimpse of the old Dean, who knew he was pretty and wasn’t scared to take advantage of it. He became the Dean that Cas had first fallen for.
“I'm not gonna say what you did was perfect, Cas, because it wasn't; but everyone’s got their stuff! You think me or Sam never done anything stupid in the moment?”
“Cas,” Dean repeated. He’d pushed himself up to his elbow, and seemed much more awake than he had only seconds ago. “Where're you going?”
“Yes,” Dean said quickly.
Past the curses and cries
He walked slowly back to the table, taking his sweet time, the bastard. Dean held his breath as he waited, using his thoughts to send threats to the star should it feel like making any attempt towards the ground.
“Heaven is losing,” Cas said, words just as quiet. He didn’t elaborate, and Dean didn’t press. He just continued tracing his finger against Castiel’s skin: alive, solid. Here, for the moment if nothing else, here.
The air in the bedroom was like thick putty, pushing against Dean’s every movement. His eyes were having trouble focusing. His thumb stroked over Cas’s lips. He thought he heard Lisa’s voice from somewhere outside. The light seemed to have lowered. Surely, he could hardly see.
But if the paper hadn’t been folded and shoved into the old book by the Men of Letters, then that left only a few possible suspects, and Sam couldn’t imagine either Dean or Cas having any reason to do such a thing. The last time this particular book had been opened… Sam’s gaze drifted upwards as he searched his memory. The last time they’d used this book for research had been on a rugaru case shortly after… Oh. Shortly after Cas and Mary had died.
Champagne problems
Cas turned to look towards Dean. The driver was still very diligently keeping his eyes on the road, and each car that passed them from the opposite direction alighted his side-profile golden-yellow. He looked like a movie star, which was something that Cas knew about because Dean had made him memorize a few of Dean’s favourite celebrities.
The book, if it could be called that, was at least a foot long by a foot wide, and several inches thick. The cover was solid black, its plastic sheen shining blue and purple. Sam flipped it open and the book flattened itself to a certain page as if it had been waiting to do so.
Castiel leveled his eyes at Dean, as if saying
Each time that the bus turned a corner or drove over a bump, the girl’s body hit against the side. She didn’t seem to mind, but human bodies were so delicate. She could get hurt if she hit her head too hard.
The veil was off of Castiel’s head, smoothed out, and hung back on the mirror before Dean had managed to remind his eyes that the room was, in fact, bright enough to see in.
“Halo Top! I read about this brand on a health food sight, and I-” Sam started from the passenger side.
The operation, it appeared, was going well. Dean’s tone suggested interest, approval. He spoke slowly, letting the vowels linger in the air. He complemented the cashier’s haircut, and when her hands twitched up to pull at her ponytail, he shifted seamlessly to noticing her painted nails. Judging from the cashier’s pink cheeks, she was only a few moments away from either giving Dean what he wanted or from throwing him out of the store.
- Taylor Swift, gold rush
His ankle hit against something soft, and Castiel nearly toppled over onto Dean’s body. He managed to angle himself to fall to Dean’s side, bringing one hand at once to ghost over Dean’s wrist, checking for his pulse, and the other hand finding his mouth to feel for breaths.
“You’re Cas.” Dean supplied easily. “You’re a soldier, and a warrior, and one frickin’ terrifying angel when you wanna be. I’m very aware of that now.”
By the time Castiel’s fingers felt the top of the cliff face, he had fallen against the rocks many more times. His scratches were bleeding, his white dress shirt soaked in salt water and sticking to his shaking body. The tips of his fingers scratched against the top of the cliff, trying to find a hold to use to pull himself up.
“Other options,” Dean laughed in a short, joyless way. “Maybe in another life there would have been an option that ended with us together. Maybe.” He kicked his heel into the ground. To his left, the gravestone of an E.R. Ritchie watched their hushed argument with little sympathy. “I wish it was different,” Dean added quietly.
The image of lights reflecting in Cas’s eyes forced its way into Dean’s thoughts violently, making him remember the fluttery feeling, like the urge to smile for no reason. It had been mere seconds, probably, since Cas had been close enough to share his body heat, and yet somehow Dean already wanted him back. He was sure that feeling only had to do with safety, and how he’d be better prepared to fight the vamps with backup.
Dean smirked and adlibbed playfully, “Shouldn’t surprise you. In case, you don’t remember, teenagers will do all kinds of crazy things when they are drunk and bored. And, I’m not sure, but I might have smelled some pot out there that night as well.”
“No,” Dean argued meaningfully, “it was just the most awesome prank, ever. You guys totally had everyone believing in her. Wish I could be as good as you two.”
Cas swallowed nervously, “Uh, me, I mean, my side.”
“Shuddup and move your ass, Winchester,” Cas ordered playfully before lightly shoving Dean to get him moving.
“It means,” Dean explained firmly, “how many of you would have admitted to, one, seeing a ghost to your friends, or, two, being thrown around by a female ghost? Most people will write it off or bury it rather than have their family and friends believe they’re a few cards short of a deck. You know I’m right.” They all shifted uneasily which gave him their confirmation.
“Yeah, but, one, I let you win. Two, I called dibs. Finally, three, I’m a guest and wounded so I get the first shower,” Dean taunted cockily as he strutted inside. “I’ll try to save some hot water for you, bitch.”
, you know.”
More than an hour later, they had kissed all the ladies at least three times so Cas wondered, “So, what do you ladies say?”
He snarked mentally before he answered his own sarcasm with the knowledge that he had actually known that really well.
They drove the rest of the way in silence which Dean was grateful for. Cas pulled into his driveway then got out and headed toward the front door, keeping an eye on Dean. He knew how injured guys were because he’d been one before and knew he’d act a lot like Dean was if the positions were reversed. That didn’t mean that he wasn’t going to look out for him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Has it?” Dean demanded with mounting dread, wondering if he’d already screwed up the only relationship he’d had left. It took conscious effort to not grip his hair tightly as he mentally berated himself,
“My turn,” Cas informed him with relish.
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean, hiding his amusement, then Cas patronized him sarcastically, “Yeah, right. That’s it exactly.”
“What the hell are you all doing ganging up on him?” Cas demanded in response to Dean’s nervousness.
“Kay. Just be safe, Dean. No driving tonight,” Cas ordered.
“You know, the same. Midterms, papers, busy,” Dean lied easily.
McDonald smirked, “Bringing in a ringer for the game on Saturday, hey? Good. Good. Looking forward to you beating those Hardin boys into the ground. Go on and get those kids to bed and yourselves, too.”
“Because you haven’t really been trying. Let me guess. Don’t really care. Don’t have the energy to care,” Cas guessed knowingly and knew he was right when Dean’s eyes move away. “Yeah, I get it. After I got dumped by ‘the one’ a while back. Felt the same. Got back into and, guess what? Just got dumped again. Chicks, man. Too bad we need them, huh?”
He also really liked a challenge so he decided to get all of Cas’s cock in his mouth. He wondered briefly if any girl had done that before. If so, he wanted to meet her.
Cas gave a pained smile, fighting the intense desire to bury himself into Dean, before answering cockily, “Better believe it. Uh, Dean?”
“Yeah, I hear that,” Cas reminisced. “There was this one girl, Rachel, and she was hot but the things that she did. God, she had a pierced tongue and, man,” Casy shuddered slightly.
Cas smiled wanly. “Yeah, I know, buddy.”
“Doubtful,” Dean admitted quickly. “You know, when I stop thinking about . . .”
Cas stared at him a long moment then answered softly, “Honestly? I’m not sure.”
Cas leaned forward and ran his tongue lightly over Dean’s bottom lip, tasting the salty wetness that Cas had put there. Dean’s tongue came out to trace over the same path when Cas’s lips swooped down to sample those lush lips to the fullest. Cas captured Dean’s tongue in the process, sucking it into his mouth like a captured prisoner.
“Good, good. Heard they partied at the old bat’s place. Hope they learned their lesson this time. Someone should have burned that place down long time ago. ‘Course word has it that someone tried but it didn’t burn. She was spooky enough when we were kids. Still say that’s what happened to that missing girl last year,” McDonald reminisced.
“Why are you calling me Casy like that?” Cas panted as a shudder passed through him.
Comments for cookies!!!!
He licked his lips nervously then continued with the same hesitancy, “And maybe she was the one, you know, or I thought that, but it was really only two weeks. Yeah, that’s the probably longest relationship I’ve ever . . . but . . . ,” Dean stumbled then let out a heavy sigh. “Just not been batting very well in that department, I guess.”
“Did it scare her?” Another man wondered.
Dean’s phone vibrated within his pocket. He pulled it out and checked it but saw that it was only a text message. He sighed and put the phone away for later. If it was a text, it wasn’t immediately important.
“Dude, after what you did . . .”
“Dean?” Cas checked.
Dean was relieved when he saw the rundown shack in the distance. It was out in the middle of nowhere surrounded by fields and trees which meant he could do this in the daylight without having to worry about the authorities or nosy neighbors. Now all he had to do was find her bones.
“Really? That the way it’s gonna go? Fine.”
Cas smirked slightly then asked, “Feel up to going out tonight or do you want to get some more sleep?”
“Shit,” Cas growled and kissed Dean again while he tried to clean Dean up. It wasn’t working very well so finally Cas pulled away. He sighed heavily and turned to focus on cleaning their cum off Dean’s hot body. He felt Dean slowly caress his shoulders and run his fingers through his hair.
Cas laid his head back against the wall, allowing Dean to attack his neck, while Cas tried to catch his breath. The immense desire coursing through his veins surprised him, considering he’d already had an orgasm not too long ago. Then he felt Dean’s hand reach between them and grab both of their cocks in one hand then slowly pump them.
“What about your head?”
Dean cocked an eye open, commenting without thinking, “Which is why we’ll never do real gay guy sex.” Then he quickly amended, “If we ever do this again.”
“I know, Casy,” Dean answered a little softer. “I’m fine. Just another day at the office,” Dean muttered to himself then studied the wet ground under him, remembering what he’d seen from above. He crouched down after checking for more snakes, or snake movements.
Dean knew he couldn’t go into more detail and didn’t want to give them wrong ideas in case they encountered another ghost. “Not really but we still got away.”
Dean flushed slightly in embarrassment from the undeserved praise then held up his muddy hand in a motion to show how dirty they were. Lyle shook his head at Dean and gripped his hand anyway before pulling him in for a one armed hug. Lyle nodded to Cas and headed off to the other group of men.
The bartender smiled big. “Yeah, he is at that. You must be Dean. I’m Ted, bartender here.” Ted offered his hand and Dean shook it. “Cas said that he’d be here in about thirty. He’s finishing up a car.  Can I get you something while you wait?”
Cas snickered at the sight then elaborated, “Dude, we just gave each other blow jobs so I think it’s safe to sleep together now. You know. As in the same bed. Which is definitely much more comfortable than the couch.”
“Couple of days. Need a shower and some sleep before I leave.”
Cas glanced at him for a long moment before turning to the girls that were exchanging looks. “You really need to be a lot clearer when you ask questions like that.”
Dean heard Alfie ask hesitantly, “Wha- . . . what did you tell them?”
Kyle stepped forward and explained, “It’s making the rounds that someone set the Ol’ Lady’s house on fire. Everyone is blaming everyone else but Alfie . . . “
He coughed slightly when drier air easily flowed back into his lungs. He rolled over to cradle his lungs as he hacked slightly. He felt a comforting hand on his shoulder and knew it was Cas before he even spoke.
Cas sighed heavily and rested his forehead against Dean’s. “Dean,” Cas exhaled and shuddered again in memory, “If you were any better, I’d be dead. No way do I believe that was a first time. You suck better than all the girls I know. God, you’ve ruined me.”
Dean sighed softly in frustration then pinched Cas’s arm, causing another rumble behind him. He knew he should correct Cas but he couldn’t find the energy to leave the sated, contented feeling he’d fallen into. For the first time in years, he actually felt safe, and loved.
The bartender arched an eyebrow and verified vaguely, “Cas? Got a last name?”
“So you’re driving my car, huh? You don’t look to be in much better shape,” Kyle snarked lightly.
Cas smirked with amused pleasure and verified, “Not Pee Wee?”
“Like hell,” Dean growled, “If anyone’s the bitch in this relationship, it’s not me, bitch.”
