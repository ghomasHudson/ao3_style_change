"I-I need you too." Dean shivers, "It's just-hard to-" Castiel hushes him, tells him it's okay and that he understands. Dean's just relieved he understands and that he's not mad about the lack of sex these days. His neck is being kissed and licked at which feels amazing but his brain is worrying over a nagging thought he can't make go away, he speaks up- "Would you find someone else, if I couldn't- anymore?" his eyes scan down to the tent in his scrub pants.
It looks like tonight might be more eventful than Castiel thought, chaos seems to follow his love everywhere he goes. Sometimes it's the good chaos, other times it's not so good.
That night Castiel calls out the name "Dean-" into the silence of the home after letting himself in, all he wants to do is get in bed after the long day he's had. He drops his bag on the floor and somehow manages to not drop his coffee cup or his laptop that he'd been carrying in his hands. "Anybody home?" he calls once again.
"She knows-" Castiel sighs into the silence of the home.
"Is that so-" Castiel visibly relaxes a bit, but not much because he doesn't like walking in on Dean with some other guy. "What do you do?"
“Hmm?”
Castiel kisses his forehead, "Okay, Dean. Give it a try, I think you just might like it." it was no secret that Dean had been so excited to start college, because it was going to make him
"Careful-" he calls out to them.
before. Dean was good about that, always where he should be and nowhere else. Eventually he even ends up at Sam's house, asking his mother if Dean was there since she had been outside tending to her garden.
Castiel doesn't look down at his privates, he keeps eye contact. "You're showering at four in the morning?"
Dean's pissed for obvious reasons. "You mean that loser that was pressuring you for it a few weeks back?" right then, the girl begins crying softly into her hands. "Okay-" his arms wrap around her. "I'm sorry, I'm not tryin' to be a dick here but-" they pull away from each other. "Are you sure you're pregnant?"
someone
Castiel hates this guy already, it's confirmed. "I'm a doctor-" Derek nods, he's impressed. "You keep calling me sir, just how old are you?"
Still felt healthy and strong. He got better for a while- he played basketball with Sam every day and ate well. Where did it go wrong? He had been fine, then that damn day- he drove Castiel to the hospital and it all came crashing down. He got dizzy- felt like he had been in a dream all of a sudden- he hasn't woken up since. This life he was living now had to be some
Dean gulps, "Work-" and puts his sandwich down uncomfortably. "He's comin' back soon-" but the clock on the wall in the living room says otherwise, it was only three in the afternoon.
Dean licks his bottom lip again before he bites down on it. "You see, I was kinda hoping tonight would be the night I get to fuck you." He's saying this and he's so confident in it. Castiel almost hates him for it, he sounds so much older than he is, especially now with the sudden weight loss and he's looking taller this close to him. The freaking even teenager even has abs coming in now. Castiel is taken back by his request. "You promised."
He had to admit he looked rather adorable and smaller than he already was, he cleared his throat to get his attention. Castiel looked up to find him standing right there, keeping a comfortable distance. " Hey. " Dean greeted shyly. The boy went back to placing product's on the lowest shelf, ignoring him.
When the credits to the movie on the screen begin roll, Castiel looks over at Dean who was already looking at him. Double
face on. "-Dean?"
"Shh, Cas." Dean pulls Castiel closer to his side of the bed and cradles his head to his chest. "I'm sorry I grew up-" that only made Castiel cry harder. "I still love you."
"Yes sir." he gives a little bow and doesn't know why he's so weird. "Bye." he runs to the bathroom and locks the door. Dean takes his time brushing his teeth for fear of encountering his uncle again. He hides in the small room until he hears a bedroom door closing. "Thank God." he exits the bathroom, looks both ways to make sure it's safe and he makes his way to Castiel.
"Looks nice on you, keep it-" he opens the door, "See you tomorrow at ten, you better show up."
"Yea but it makes me feel like a girl-"
Castiel gets uncomfortable, shifting his weight on the bed. "Dean, I didn't come to argue- I just wanted to give you the ring."
Dean tensed, “Shhh, Will you keep it down. You’re making a scene.”
Castiel looks up at him from where he was between his thighs, and smiles warmly. "You didn't do anything wrong sweetheart-" he pulls up the teens panties to his waist before climbing into the bed with him, and lays on his side. His fingers lazily brush through the light colored hair. "I miss you, baby-"
"Take a hot shower." Castiel orders, Dean goes- but asks him to join so he does. The showers hot- steam fills the room and they make out under the spray. "Feels like we're on our honeymoon."
"Why is that a problem? They weren't going to do anything to you."
Castiel tries prying the teens hands away because he wants to see his face, "Dean, you're aware that I'm not your real father- aren't you?" he nods because
The two of them drink and look out at the stars in the sky while casually talking about the ones they loved. Bobby told his boy more stories about his Karen, like how great of a woman she was and how she made the best damn pies around town. Karen even won a few pie baking contests and Dean smiled at that.
"Casss..." Dean hissed, a cold hand trying to sneak it's way into his jeans, fumbling with his belt. "Stop."
Dean chokes up a little bit, he knows Castiel is making sense. "Love you...night."
Castiel didn't know he'd fallen asleep until a knock on his car window startles him. "Bobby-" he rolls down the window. "Bobby, it's you-"
"I just got word from your mom that you will be leaving, your father's got important business in Europe-"
Castiel opens his eyes eventually and shakes him gently, "You okay?" his voice is raspy from sleep. "You had me so worried baby-"
"He's always out late-" Dean comments, getting up from the table and taking his soda with him to the living room. Castiel gets up from the table as well, picking up their dishes and gets started on washing them. That's when the front door slams shut.
Both Dean and Castiel are quietly making the drive to their awaiting cabin very early in the morning. While Castiel drove, Dean kept thinking about it- why is it that whenever one goes on a trip, you leave early? It's always before the sun comes up. The teen shakes his head over that thought with his step father looking over at him occasionally in the silence of the vehicle.
"Since when are we afraid of gettin' our asses beat?" they make eye contact. "I've gotten my share of-" and the mood changes between them, and he won't continue because the guilt is evident in his uncles dark eyes. "But yea, gettin' my ass beat don't scare me-"
A raspy voice called out, "Yeah?"
Castiel winces at the sensitivity in his ass but does as he's told, "Almost there baby-" the question sounds desperate.
Get this done so he can come back because he's never not seen Dean for that long since they met.
with him. "Goodnight, Dean-"
It's been a few short weeks since Dean and Castiel had been keeping their distance. Somehow their relationship seemed to be growing more organically than ever before, with all their late night phone calls while they lay in their own beds somehow made them feel more normal than ever. Castiel came over for dinner every other night, bringing a pizza with him or a bucket of fried chicken.
"People argue, no big deal-" his uncle smiles, somehow it makes him feel better. "Now eat, I know you tossed last nights dinner-" Dean apologizes and polishes off his breakfast to make up for the wasted food.
Dean looks up at him through his lashes, Castiel runs the back of his hand down his cheek lovingly. "You're so fucking pretty." Soon Dean's left alone in the room for several minutes. When his step father returns he has a bowl of what appears to be ice cream. "Hungry?"
"Why don't you go play, I'll be fine right here-" he says warmly.
Castiel sighs, letting him run off to find the
Dean shakes his head, "No?"
Dean smiles fondly as he holds the ring in his hands and comments, "This is so gay-"
Dean shoves him, "Just leave it." he presses the pack to his mouth as they walk to the car.
Castiel steals his phone back, "I'm not giving it to you, stop being like this-" it was the wrong thing to do because John grabs his book and tosses it across the bedroom. "Hey!" Soon after his book ends up on the floor, he's being dragged out of bed by his ankles. "Stop!"
"Hey Robin." Dean smiles, "Chocolate shake and fries." Castiel orders as well and the perky waitress leaves them be to go fetch their food.
Dean inhales deeply, the exhales. The feel of warm fingers exploring his chest now and rubbing his nipples felt good. So good that his back is arching into the touch. Eventually his arm goes around his step father's neck, gripping his shirt from behind to hold himself up.
"Cas-" Castiel yanks Dean's jeans down and that's when Dean starts to cry and he cries very loudly. Castiel blinks away the sweat from his brow.
Bobby leans over the table - "You idiot, why don't you ask her out? You'd be cute together."
"Yea don't say it." Dean huffs a nervous laugh, "I'll talk about anything, but that-" he shakes his head. "Another name to add on my list of dudes I hate-" now this time he laughs for real.
he can't face Castiel today.
When they arrive at the diner, Castiel gives him a card to give to the waitress which no doubt contains some money inside. The man was less than thoughtful but it's not like he knew the girl as well as Dean did.
Castiel doesn't want to send him to his room so he invites him to get in, "Come on-" he gets under the covers and allows the boy to get under them too. "We'll take a nap while we wait for your dad-" Dean nods, instantly yawning into his hand. Castiel closes his eyes, ready to sleep when he feels the boy using his chest as a pillow. It feels weird, really weird but he liked it- he envied John of this, he had a child to love him and he was missing out because he enjoyed time at the bar more than time at home.
Kevin and Robin go home first, around one in the morning. Ash goes home last, around two thirty and that leaves them to clean up the remains of a very awesome new years. Dean's going around with a garbage bag and picking up everything he can manage to see in the dark. Bobby heads in for bed because he's so damn tired, it was a really long day for him.
Dean's sitting on the floor Indian style while he reads through the older mans mail, with his permission of course. The guy probably felt bad for him since he didn't have any of his own mail or any kind of reading material. His eyes look up to see Castiel sitting on the edge of the bottom bunk enjoying a jar of peanut butter. "Where'd you get that?" he licks his lips, shoving all the letters off his lap.
Castiel chuckles before caressing his lovers face tenderly with the back of his fingers. "If you're not up to it tonight, just tell me-"
Castiel takes the towel and shirt, "Thanks Bobby." he looks over at Dean for a second before heading towards the bathroom.
"Wanted to surprise you." Castiel climbs out of the car and pulls him in for a hug. "Missed you so much-" he glances around, "Bobby working out back?" Dean nods, that's all he needs to give him a quick peck on the lips and whispers in his ear- "Meet me in the woods tonight."
and unlocked with several tabs open- mostly bank statements and research, but one of pages caught his eye- and blinks them several times to try to get his vision to focus and it serves as a reminder that he's in dire need of his own glasses. He takes one look over his shoulder to make sure the coast was clear and clicks on one of the more interesting tabs which was clearly some gay porn.
Castiel's breathing became labored but he tried to keep his cool. " I need-"
"Ya got Kevin now, that Robin girl-" Bobby's tone is very reassuring, "Ya got me." there's a pause. "Let go of em'- it's time to let go. Yer not alone anymore-"
Castiel's eyes scan around the yard, looking for signs of trouble. "Have a decision for me?" after noting the teens confusion he clarifies, "About letting me take care of you-"
Calling. "Shit-" he pushes the hungry teen away from his crotch and answers, "Hey Bobby-" he tries to act casual- but Dean being the devil he is, starts sucking his cock again anyway. "Hmmm-" he tries not to moan, "Yeah, Dean's here-made him dinner since you were out, didn't know when you were coming ba-aack-" he looks down at the teen going to town on him. "Hmm-" he tries not to moan again. "Sure-I-I-" he's so close to coming- "I'll walk him over right now, bye-" and as soon as he hangs up he explodes into Dean's willing and open mouth. "Ugh-mmm-"
Ash nods, "I know that-" and takes another swig of his soda.
Dean nods eagerly because hell yes he does want to go to Mexico. "Thanks sugar daddy" so many images of all the dirty things they can get up to at a resort are flashing behind his eyelids every time he blinks.
me?" his eyes won't meet the teens.
Dean wraps an arm around Castiel, he's pretty tall by now and Castiel melts into it for a few seconds before he lets go. "You know me so well, huh Cas." They go and pick out the rest of his party essentials and they're standing at the checkout line when Castiel asks "So it's going to be Sam, Charlie and who else?"
Dean groans softly, "Don't make a big deal about it, please."
"What're you doin' here?" Castiel stays silent and simply listens, they're both hoping he didn't hear anything. "Who you talkin' to?"
"Fucking hell-" the older man groans behind him, "You're such a good fucking bitch-" the sound of skin slapping skin was loud in the silence of the cell. "My fucking bitch-"
Castiel buries in even deeper and it's causing his love some discomfort but the more it
11:45 p.m.
Dean shakes his head in response, "Can I tell you something?" he looks up again. Castiel nods.
"Think he's a Satanist-" Castiel laughs at that, "He had a tattoo of a pentagram on his arm." Bobby overhears their conversation as he walks by, he pokes his head out from the screen door. "Right, Gordon's a Satanist?" he asks his uncle.
Dean rolls his eyes as soon as his uncle walks into the living room, "Really can't leave us alone for a second can he-"
"Went to see Robin-" his fingers play around with the keys still in his hand. Bobby looks at him expectantly, "I'm still confused, sorry to disappoint-"
Castiel sits on the floor next to the overly decorated tree and hands him his gifts, "Merry Christmas, baby-"
"Yes, I also want to be your boyfriend- or anything you want me to be. I'll take any label, as long as I can have you."
that scares him too.
"Fuck you." Dean hangs up the phone and goes to bed. Castiel puts the phone away in his pants pocket and continues to work late into the night. It's nearly morning when he realizes he spent the whole night painting. He finished turning Dean's old room into a pretty pink nursery for the couple's baby girl and managed to turn his old bedroom into a nice master for her parents. The rest of the home- he'd paint tomorrow. Well, later- since it was tomorrow already. Castiel peels off his sweaty clothes and makes a mental note to paint the small bathroom as well because toddler Dean Winchester had written his name in red crayon on the wall near the light switch. Before stepping out of the shower he thinks of those green eyes staring back up at him- "Fuck." that's when he comes- the whole time he was in the shower he kept thinking of Dean down on his knees sucking him off.
"No friggin' shit-"
Dean nods, his lip caught between his teeth. His cock is still hard. Blue eyes lightly slaps his cock, he shrieks. "The fuck-" but he kinda liked it, though he pretends it hurts. "Please stop-" Another light slap on his dick. He giggles, "Cas-"
Derek nods in agreement and for a long while there's a heavy silence in the air, until the sun goes down completely, that's when he turns to face the teen, "Can I kiss you?" his words are whispered in the darkness of the night that wraps around them both.
He swallowed. Adams apple bobbing. "That was nice." Was there really more he could say? this was beyond random.
Dean nods quickly, still not entirely convinced on the idea and stands up. "I gotta get back before Bobby loses his shit-" he offers his hand for the older man to take, which he does, and helps him off the hardwood floor. "By the way, I don't hate you. But I guess you're used to me sayin' crap I don't mean-"
"I could ask you the same thing. What're you-" he takes the laptop from Dean and sees that he was watching some kind of cartoon porn. "Dean- how could you be in the mood to watch this right now?" He shrugs. "Come on, go to sleep." he shuts the laptop and sets it on the table.
Castiel pulls away and stills his movements because this sort of confession is a little odd because the teen isn't always vocal about his feelings. "You really mean that?" there's a pause. "You're not messing with me?"
His baby. They both begged him to eat something and he almost always refused. It was sheer luck when he accepted the occasional bottle of water or soda he was offered.
Castiel raises a
"You definitely need a cleaning, no offense-" he laughs. "Come by tomorrow, around ten? The address is on the card I gave you." after a beat, "On the house-" because he knows maybe the teen can't afford it because he knows where he lives. Bobby's house wasn't really up to code on a lot of things, they lived in an old house- it was no secret and he wanted to do something nice for the kid.
He hadn't wanted to stay but he falls asleep regardless with come on the inside of his boxers. When he wakes up in the morning his body feels uncomfortable and gross, especially down south. "Damn it-" he slowly gets up, and yes his head is pounding and he feels like shit. "Oh, hey." he says to the boy who was watching him from the kitchen table, eating his cereal. "You're going to school right-" the boy nods. "Where's your dad?"
Dean spanked him, then rubbing at the area "Fine then, I'll give you what you want. I won't apologize for hurting you." Dean rolled Castiel on the bed and climbed over him, his rough hands exploring the pale skin that had been newly exposed.
"Because you look like crap-" she whispers, "Are you sick?" he nods because it's easier than telling her he might now have a dope problem thanks to his new friend. "If you're sick you really shouldn't be eating the food around here- too greasy."
That's something that hurts worse than anything he could imagine.
"Meg." he moans weakly,"It hurts-" she lifts the sleeve of his hospital gown to reveal a bad bruise on his arm, where he keeps getting poked for blood draws. "Agh-"
Dean nods, "Yea-" his eyes close tightly at the pressure he feels at his hole- Castiel pops inside and he almost cries. Not in pain but in relief. Dean was desperate to replace the memory he had by the train tracks with a new one. "Ugh- just fuck me-" he whines. "Fuck me hard-"
Dean checks out the curve of his ass in the profile view he's got of him. "Uh, well  I slept-"
Dean looks at the ceiling, "No."
Bobby quickly stands, heading for the keys on the wall hook. "You comin?" Dean nods. Instead of driving all the way into town, they go to a local gas station to pick up the medicine. They walk through the door, it pings electronically. "You said cold medicine right?"
Castiel props himself on his elbows right the on the bed, panting heavily through his mouth. His legs were shaking.
"What did he do-" Dean asks, clearly not understanding the situation at all. "Dad always drinks-"
Castiel blushes, "Alright, alright-" and buries his face into the back of the teens warm neck. "I love you too-" there was no mistake, they definitely felt closer after their talk and it was obvious.
"That's her son, Ben." Dean makes a comment about how young she is. "She's only nineteen and already has a four year old." she shakes her head before getting back to work and he watched them for a while- until Lisa turns around and notices him, she smiles before getting to work on wiping down tables.
"Fuck-" he pushes away from the teen and takes a few deep breathes. It can't happen, nothing can. "We shouldn't-"
"Where's your Dad?"
"I've already seen you naked before." he rubs his hand up and down the teens back, "You know you can trust me."
"Cas-" he licks his lips.
While Ash talks about his neighbor, some hot single lady whose kinda hot for a milf, he just watches the man take a seat on one of the stools up front. All he can really see is his backside which wasn't bad to look at by any means and that hair, almost looked brown in the sunlight coming in through the diners windows. Dean's got the straw of his soda between his teeth and chews on it mindlessly in arousal.
"Them?" Castiel asks, his eyes focused on the approaching car.
"Perfect." Dean says sarcastically in fear that the guy won't rush to get out of the hospital, he lays back in the little bed. It's smaller than his twin back at home. "Fuck." he sits up, it's worse laying down in that thing he feels like he could fall off. Falling a few feet off this thing would feel like falling off a building to him right now. It's almost an entire hour later that Castiel finally shows up, the call comes in and she tells Dean to go to the front office "Thanks." Dean hops off the bed unsteadily and he walks slowly to the front office.
After a while of pacing the boy asks, "Do you have to pee-" and points at him because he won't stop moving around the room like a crazy person. "You're walking a lot-"
"Great-" Dean forces a smile, "Just great." He gets up to refill his coffee mug, "You better pray for a friggin' hurricane or somethin' cause I sure as shit don't wanna go."
Castiel knocks the little pill back with coffee and sighs, "I'm never drinking again."
"You like football?" John asks, standing up so he can put on his jacket.
"No shit-" Dean says. Castiel is silent.
Luckily Castiel came home earlier than expected that night, around five. "Honey, I'm home-" his humorous tone echoes through the house as soon as he lets himself into the house. The teen comes padding over quickly from the living room, burying his face into his chest. "What's the matter baby?" his tone softens into a loving one.
Dean looks over his shoulder to look at him, "Dude's in the same cell is me-" it's clear to now that whatever is going on between them can't possibly be real because Castiel will never be honest with him. "That's all-"
He flips the light on in Dean's room, "What's wrong?" his voice is sleepy but empathetic, not at all annoyed that he'd been woken up from much needed sleep.
Dean smiles, "Oh yea?"
"Kissing?"
Dean is confused because just how many other
Castiel is taken off guard, "Tighter?"
Castiel nods, chuckling. "Well- you weren't completely wrong." Dean squints at him, "I'm sort of-" he kisses the teen softly on the lips now. "-kinky, but you knew that." after a beat he then asks, "Wait a minute, how do you know about bondage parties?"
"Dean?"
"Ugh- fuck-" Dean's movements start becoming slower, he was so close. "-ughh- oh fuck- shit- gonna come- oh fuck I'm gonna come-" he breathes harshly against Castiel's sweaty neck, "-ughh- gonna come!" he cries out as his orgasm hits and Castiel comes inside his ass with a string of loud groans. "Ugghhhh-" he signs.
Kevin doesn't blink for a while, maybe a full minute. "Uh-" and the teen is processing the information. His eyes scan his friends body briefly, up and down as if checking him out but not in
As soon as the front door opens, the teen is stunned but not happy. "Oh, new car?" he says without an ounce of suspicion, It's as if he'd forgotten that he had already seen it at Bobby's a few days ago.
"Don't you have class today?" the muffled question comes from down the hall.
"Yea, Cas." Dean sniffles, "Yea."
Castiel watched all the faces he made, Dean's never looked so...
"What?" Castiel pulls away.
Dean pulls his hand out from underneath his shirt. "I was just scratching-."
Castiel's pissed at what he did but he can't help but nod in agreement and hates that he's such a man whore. "Yeah, guess I do-" although his cock is rock hard in his sweatpants, the knowledge of being drugged is too much for him to handle and instantly, he's soft. "Forget it, I can't-" and pushes the older man away. "Not feeling well-"
"Hunting." He kept stuffing clothes into his green duffle bag.
She shrugs, "Of course I love you, I always will."
"Wouldn't it be the same if you married me?" Dean asks, biting his nails again.
"Stop doing that!" John yanks on his hair, "If I didn't know any better, I'd think I had a little girl instead of a little boy-" Dean starts crying again, sobbing for his mom. "Maybe you're a little girl after all, since you get sticky back here-"
Where does John get the audacity to take his keys and control him like
themselves, they join Bobby for dinner. "I love hot dogs, Bobby." Dean mumbles with his mouth full and it makes Castiel snort.
"That's disgusting." Castiel looks away from him, laughing. When he looks at the teen again he starts laughing for another reason.
Dean nods quickly, "Yea-alright." he smiles, following her down the hallway to the waiting room where his uncle was waiting for him.
"Cas!" Dean wakes him up early one morning, pulling him by the arm- "Come run with me."
you were with.
Castiel is growing impatient since there's a certain someone at home waiting for his arrival, "I
Castiel takes the cigarette, placing it in his mouth and inhales. "These not the ones
way-" and it's obvious to him, why else would he get hard every time they so much at hug.
Castiel nods, making a note to never touch Dean in bed, while the lights are off. "Sure. Let me just go tell Bobby." When he comes back outside, he's got his wallet and a pair of jeans for Dean and his boots. The teen takes the jeans and pulls them up and buttons the flannel he already had one. He looked
Castiel calmly asks, "Now why don't you get mad when he says it?"
"You're an only child, forgot you never got used to rough housin'-"
"Okay, okay." Dean lays back on the bed, getting comfortable. "Cas?" Castiel looks at him, nodding like he's saying
No one has ever said that to him.
He drives to the grocery store because it's the only place still open- he buys his boy flowers because that's all he can think of as a peace offering. Maybe he'll pay someone to fix the car he got for him so he can actually drive it. After that, he goes to Mcdonald's because it's the second place he sees open amidst everything being shut down these days- he orders both boys breakfast and he doesn't forget that Mocha coffee thing Dean likes. He's trying his best in this situation in hopes to be forgiven for fucking his best friend. That
"Dean." Castiel gets down on his knee, "Look at me- I'm not abandoning you. I know you need me, I wish there was another way but Bobby can have me arrested- there's no fooling him this time." Dean nods, fat tears rolling down his cheeks. "If there was another way, I would find it. You have to believe me-"
Dean crosses his arms on his chest defiantly but nods in understanding. "Yea, whatever-" tears are threatening to come soon. "I mean, yea I understand-" he stands, "You need space-"
Castiel opens his eyes, "Aren't you the best boyfriend."
"Cas-" she warns with her tone, big brown eyes looking up at him. "-don't be mean to me, I'm your best friend."
Dean steps closer to her, his hand cups her face gently. "I'm fine sweetheart." he winks and kisses her forehead before leaving the bathroom. Robin follows him a minute later, by then he's gone.
" You are twelve. " Castiel shook his head and climbed out of the car.
"Dean..." Castiel sighs roughly, he's in awe of the little ass just displayed for him. He pulls Dean towards the edge of the bed so he can get closer, he's standing behind him. Kneading at his exposed flesh, "Round two?" he asks him for permission. The boy nods, almost crying. Castiel forgets he has lube so he uses his saliva instead, he strokes his hard cock for a few seconds, rubbing his wet fingers on the hole to lube it up as much as he can and pushes the head against the hole and it pops in easily. "Dean, with you...it's so fucking easy to get in."
"John?-" he calls out, drying off his hands on a dish towel. The man sees that there's no dinner waiting for him and he loses his mind- Castiel knew instantly that he must have been on something, his blown out pupils told him so and his eyes quickly glance over at the boy standing by the doorway, watching them. "John-" his voice trembles, he's actually afraid of his boyfriend right now.
The boy could hear the faint sounds of Dean's masturbation on the other end. This was
of pictures.
"Dean, be nice when you talk about her. She's a good girl."
"Oh my God-" Dean groans. "Do I really gotta do all this fuckin' shit-"
He couldn't tell from the distance...but noticed his hair had been slicked slightly to one side.
It was Castiel's turn to start laughing, the image of Dean Winchester taking a pregnancy test just for fun was too much. They giggle like children for a while before the reality of the situation hits but it's Dean who calms down first and looks saddened again over his poor friend.
"You sound like a bitch."
Bobby had allowed them a night out together, since things had been going so well lately. But things were to be kept strictly platonic and warned them both to keep it so. Castiel was threatened with getting a bullet to the balls if he even suspected that anything went on between them. Of course nothing would happen, nothing could happen.
"No baby, he's fine." he tries to lay back but Castiel pulls him back up into a seating position, "Stay with me." he gently pats his heat flushed cheek. "Wake up-"
After seeing the mental struggle he's going through, Castiel says, "Take your time baby."
Dean nuzzles closer, arms wrapped around the man in fear. "You didn't tell me those technicians were comin' by-" he says with a punch to his shoulder when he pulls away.
Castiel smiles, "Very. Gotta go-" he hangs up because his interview is about to start. By the end of the interview, he feels overly confident that he will be hired at this hospital- and he was right. "Thank you, I look forward to joining your team." he says on his way out of the office. He now has a new job and he's got to figure out a way to let Dean know- he's been too used to having him home the past month or so. Castiel picks up a pizza on his way home because it's Dean's favorite- he walks inside at five thirty fully expecting him to already be there. "Dean if you're not here, I'm going to kick your ass-" he goes to the living room, pizza in hand.
"There's plenty, Dean." Castiel says, wiping his hands and mouth on a napkin. He's had two slices himself. No way in hell was Dean going to eat more than a grown man. Sam's only had one slice himself, but to be fair he had also made popcorn and he'd been munching on that too.
That night they both seem to toss and turn in bed with sleep proving hard to come by. Eventually Castiel types up a message of -
Dean smiles, wiggling his eyebrows in a silly way. "You tickle-" the spider man in his arm is released so he can touch the older mans chin, feeling the stubble there. "Dad's beard doesn't tickle-"
"Guess not-" Castiel has his hands clasped together under the table, on his lap. "I'll have a beer-" he asks one of the semi nude waiters that passes by them.
"Keep going, m-fine." Dean sighs, "I always forget how big you are-" Castiel pushes in all the way a little rougher than he meant to, making the teen groan loudly. "Fucking hell-careful-" They make love slowly for about an hour and a half, Castiel alternating from pounding his boy to slow and deep thrusts. Dean's a mess by the end of it after being made to come twice.
Dean hides a smile by looking away, "Cas-you're making me feel funny. Stop it." They watch the waves crashing into the sand for a while- until it starts to rain they run all the way back to their room, hand in hand. Once through their hotel door, Dean sneezes three times in a row. "Fuck-" Castiel hands him a tissue. "I hope I'm not getting sick."
Castiel wastes no time in collecting on the favor, already groping himself over his khakis in order to make himself hard. Obviously that doesn't take long and he's pulling his hard cock out of his pants, stroking it suggestively.
Soon enough he and Sam are waiting out front for their bus to come when a car honks at them both. "Is that
Bobby wipes his hands on a rag, "Why would he lie?"
"Yea, if we get married. Dunno if I wanna marry you anymore, gonna keep my options open-"
Castiel takes it slow and it's the only reason they both lasted for hours without getting to the finish line but when they do- it's fireworks on the fourth of July. It's Christmas morning and it's every fucking holiday you can imagine.
Castiel laughs, "Love you!" he calls back, shutting the front door.
He gets to the cell first and something must have gone wrong with the brown goop on his plate because his stomach hurts so he does what he doesn't want to do- sit on the toilet. His khakis are pooled around his ankles, elbows on his thighs as he's hunched over and shaking his head because he feels completely defeated. Castiel walks in with a cocky chuckle.
Dean's face is pink. "Like me and Sam?"
John suddenly rolls him onto his back. Castiel's face was a lovely shade of pink and so were his lips. Kinda like
"She's here!" Jack covered his mouth, "My baby sister."
"Please what?" Castiel looks down on him. "What do you want?"
Almost an hour later Castiel walked into the bathroom to wash his hands and face as he always did before he left work but he found him there, sitting on the counter between the two sink's. " Cas. " the man said.
"Yes, sir?" he swallows, "Yes, master?"
"What!" Dean sets aside the plastic army men so he can go see what his mother wanted. When he walks into the kitchen he sees that breakfast was made and on the table ready for him to dive into. He was extra happy to see the waffles, it had been a while since he'd had them.
"Shut up-" they share a brief kiss. "You're sexy-" his fingers run though the mans dark hair that now has some gray to it, not a whole lot but it was there. "So fuckin' sexy-"
smoking, it tastes like shit but it's the only thing that reminds him to breathe normally.
"I'm going to kill you." Castiel whines into the phone. "But I guess that would help me stay away from you. After all he suspects me not you."
"Bobby said you could stay here tonight- in case you don't feel well and besides, he doesn't know how to set up an IV." he gets out of the car with Dean's things in hand, "Come on-I'll make you something to eat." Dean follows slowly behind him. All he was in the mood to eat were tater tots so Castiel fried some up and it felt like old times. Extremely
"Since when do I need permission for anything in this house-" he spits water into the sink before wiping his mouth on a bath towel.
After a much needed warm shower, the teen dresses in his room and pulls on some comfortable clothes. He takes a seat at the table by himself because Bobby had already eaten and left his plate at his usual spot.
Castiel rolled his eyes. " You're thirty six. "
Dean rubs at his eyes, "I don't know what believe-"
Castiel's arms wrap around the teens shoulders, "What happened?" his tone is soft and warm. "Talk to me-"
"Who'se me-" He began to ask until he saw the boy's head peek inside,"Oh hey. I'm just finishing up here."
Castiel straightens up, coming close to him once more. "Are you telling me that? or yourself-"
Surprisingly the man begins to sob and his words sound broken when he says, "I never wanted to touch you-" he inhales roughly. "I never- you just wouldn't leave me alone-"
bedroom.
"How lovely-" Castiel picks up a book with a very disturbing book cover. "Shouldn't you be reading-" he pauses, putting the book back on the shelf. "I don't know, something kid friendly?"
It's almost midnight, meaning he's been gone for almost
"Robin!" he goes to the kitchen even though he's not allowed. "You think I can work here?" she says they aren't hiring. "Part time, anything- I'll do anything." She nods and hands him an application, told him to bring it in tomorrow. "Thanks sweetheart." As he makes his way to the exit, he looks at her once more and she notices him yet again and smiles.
among the trees that surround the happy mismatched couple.
"Fine but I want you back before midnight." Dean pouts. "Leave now-" Castiel rolls his eyes and nods before he gives his love a kiss on the forehead. "Wait!" he hisses, "Kiss me." the older man comes back and plants one on his cheek, "No you ass, kiss me." he's got him by the collar of his shirt and Castiel has no choice but to plant one on his lips.
below the belt. It took some getting used to, but it felt great nonetheless.
Dean looks at him, eyes tearing up. "When it comes to Cas, no-" he gulps. "I don't-"
"Dean, do you want a girlfriend?" Castiel crosses his arms.
Castiel broke again, falling to his knees and hugged the man's legs over his denim jeans. Loving his bowlegs and mentally kicking himself for not noticing that small detail before.
Dean looks inside the cell, it's nicer than he thought it would be. The cell was empty so he was thinking maybe he was going to be alone in here, that's until an older guy walks into the cell with him. "Yea-" he says, attitude clear in his voice because he thinks this guy is going to give him trouble.
"I wish you could ride me.." Dean husked into his ear, his fingers now tugging at black hair. "Wish you could take this dick. " he ground into the boys ass once.
"Starving." Dean plops down heavily on a wooden chair and pours himself some orange juice. "I need ketchup for my eggs-" he says to whichever adult will listen. Castiel brings him the ketchup after all and serves him his plate- "Thanks." He digs in and in no time he's finished.
"I'll be there soon." he says, hanging up the call. "Dean. What's gotten into you?" Castiel turns, "Tell me."
"Whats gotten into you?" Castiel moans as the teenager kisses his neck as soon as he waked through the front door, "Are you feeling better?"
his hands are on the bedspread at his sides, fingers digging into the fabric just to hold on because it was hard for him to do
The teen hesitates for a moment but eventually ends up standing up and hugging the older man from behind. "I still love you-" Castiel nods, taking another sip from his cold beer. "It just hurts."
Castiel's walking up to the house when he sees someone that he thought might have been Dean walking around in the kitchen so he runs inside, "Dean-" his eyes look around the kitchen, "Dean-" he repeats. He wasn't here, but he saw someone-
Castiel clears his throat, "What about the drugs-" he just had to bring it up and now Dean gets pissy again but remains well behaved. She looks at Dean.
Dean shrugs, "Hell if I know-" the same waitress comes to them with her notepad. "Morning sweetheart. Bacon, eggs and coffee." She's about to leave when he says, "Make that decaf." His heart is already beating a mile a minute against his ribs, he doesn't need to make it worse with regular. "So, Cas. How are you?" he smirks.
"On the house."
"How bout you leave her here and come back to my place? We can have a few beers."
He smiles at the boy who quickly walks up to him.
Castiel didn't notice the gradual change because he spent all his time with his friend. Dean began to play outside more often with him as well when usually he was happier indoors watching horror movies on the couch, or reading coming books. Castiel looked up from his book to see that now the two teens were shirtless, only wearing basketball shorts and sneakers. Dean was running around after Sam, trying to steal the ball from him- he kept having to pull up his shorts every so often. They were looking a little baggy. "Time out!" Dean suddenly calls out, he's panting, hands on his hips. "I need a break." Sam nods.
"Are you sure?"
Castiel shakes his head, "I'm used to it." he quickly grabs Dean and flips them over, so that Dean is now laying on his back. His head propped on his pillow. "I'll love how you taste."
"Stop-" Dean whimpers.
"What about a ski mask?" Dean's laughing. "You might as well you're gonna break in and fuck me."
Dean's green eyes look up to quickly notice the mans sadness, "Do you need a hug?" the question is asked so suddenly, so innocently. "When I was sad, mom gave me hugs-"
Once the house is as clean as he can manage to get it without becoming a chick- he leaves, locking the door behind him. The day is chilly and overcast, like it usually had been the past several weeks as Autumn was rolling in slowly. Winter was something that he wasn't looking forward to because it was going to be a rough one according to his uncle.
The boy nodded and told the barista that they would have two white chocolate mocha's. After Castiel paid with Mr. Winchester's card he handed it back to him and they found a table near the back, next to a window. They didn't get a chance to talk until their drink's were called.
"It's okay." Castiel reassures him.
kids, but his blooming feelings for this boy births an idea.
"We could wait all night for him to join us and he'd still find a reason to get upset-" Mary fills his plate generously and he's grateful for it, he'd been hungry.
They hug goodbye, for now, and go their separate ways. Castiel goes home, and Dean goes to his uncles bedroom to sleep in his bed for the night. It's only to keep him company and watch out for him through out the night in case he gets sick. But Bobby was good about that, booze never really affected him, almost like he had a belly made of steel.
He squints, tilting his head to the side in wonder. "You were found in a bar, passed out- and you're asking me out for a beer?" he can't hide the laugh.
Dean gets up to and goes to have a look. The guy was dropped off by a big black truck by the wooden fence, although he can't see him too well from here but he's wearing a leather jacket and sunglasses on an overcast day.
The teen scrambles out of bed and rushes to change into something more appropriate for leaving the house. Of course he was a little surprised that Dean decided to tag along for a grocery trip because he seemed to have outgrown those a while back.
Castiel rubs Dean's cheek tenderly, "I know how you feel and I feel it too. I don't want to be away from you either-" he kisses his bottom lip quickly. "But I have to go to work."
"No." Dean states seriously.
Dean swallows and meets his uncles brown eyes across the table. "He did smack the shit out of me, more than once-" a look of hurt is displayed on his face. "Bobby, how could you say that to me? You know what happened-"
Once inside the room he looks around, "You're too good for motels?"
Castiel also remembers doing Dean's homework for him, John doesn't know that. He knows the snacks Dean loves and always makes sure there's plenty of food for him. When he moved in all there was in the fridge was a pack of ham and bread that was starting to grow fuzz. Always makes sure his clothes are clean too. This boy was always covered in mud. He'd spend most of his time playing outside with the other kids in the neighborhood.
Derek and Dean walk to the front door together, Bobby hands the guy his keys, telling him his car is waiting for him out front. "Thank you Bobby Singer-" they shake hands and Bobby leaves them be.
They weren't asleep for very long when the sound of heavy rain splatters against the roof of the cabin. Dean looks at his phone, five in the morning- "Damn it." he was the only one who could fall back to sleep. Bobby and Castiel met in the living room and watched the storm from the window as they enjoyed a cup of coffee each. Eventually Dean comes padding into the kitchen barefoot- "Why you guys up? It's early- " he opens the fridge and takes out the jug of orange juice.
Blue eyes lightly smacks his ass, "Messy boy, look what you did to your bed." Dean looks at the creamy mess under him and he just shrugs. He flips the teen over, "You like being dirty don't you." it's a statement not a question.
Dean drives aimlessly for who know how long, he contemplates going to see Robin at work- maybe talk to her for a while- cry on her shoulder.
Dean was taken by surprise at those words. "I'm sorry, for a while I guess I forgot I'm just a middle aged guy."
Castiel broke the law by being with him so shouldn't she be doing
"I almost hooked up with this older chick at the diner where I work-" he blinks away the memory. "-Cas was really pissed-" after saying that he doesn't continue his sentence or she may pick up on something she doesn't need to know about just yet. "I love kissing-" he admits suddenly, looking up at her through his lashes. "-if I like someone, I kiss them-I've kissed all my friends."
"Sure-" Castiel smiles, standing up. "Let's get going, we can show your dad what we got today-"
they must know by now he isn't home. Castiel rings him next.
"La Calavera-" Bobby calls. Castiel and Dean both have that one, they each put a button over the skull on their playing cards.
Dean just nods in response even though his guilt is now giving him a stomach ache, the kind that has him thinking he should find a bathroom sooner rather than later. A bathroom that is not in this guys house because
"Yea, I get that-" Dean swallows, suddenly remembering that he has kissed Jack. There's a tornado of bats and butterflies in his stomach- butterflies for Jack, bats for Castiel. "Listen, about that kiss-" he rubs the back of his neck nervously. "I didn't-" The younger teen leans forward and presses a soft kiss to the corner of Dean's mouth, he'd been aiming for his lips but missed. "We can't be doin' that-"
No one happens to be in the lobby so that prompted the two to run like bats out of hell in order to make it to their room as fast as possible. Many laughs were had in the process of fighting one another for the key card and Castiel is the one who wins at last, opening the door.
Ash stands, "Are you hungry?"
"Oh, you
"Of course baby." Castiel kisses him and pulls out his phone to make the call while Dean listens in on the phone conversation between his step dad and his therapist. He's not no clue how in the world he's going to break it to this man that he's told her about
Castiel blinked away his tears. "Can I at least have a ride. I don't want to take a cab."
A few minutes into the innocent cuddle session, Castiel begins to feel the warm breath on his skin. It gives him goosebumps for the next ten minutes, until eventually getting used to it and forgets all about it.
As soon as he pushes that door to get out of the courtroom for the second time, he takes a deep breath and his heart flutters more than once. It's breaking his heart that he will not be going through with this, at least not today.
Castiel gets pissed, "I thought I lost those-" and takes them from the teens hand.
John holds out his hand, "Good doing business with you Cas."
The man huffs, "What about me?"
In the morning before he got out of bed for work he nudges Dean awake, "Dean." he tries again after a few seconds, "Dean, wake up."
They read a few chapters of their next book, which was something Dean had little to no interest in. His suggestion of reading
Dean sighs loudly as he follows closely behind the other inmates on their way back to their block. The fact that Castiel seems to have disappeared yet again doesn't phase him, every time
Dean swallows, making little struggling sounds in his throat. Unable to speak. To explain what he wants.
Dean comes back to the present instantly, "Sorry-" and hugs himself. "I just really hate Meg-"
"Are you really saying this?" Castiel smiles, he can't believe it.
Castiel just stares at him for a long minute with lust in his eyes, before he blinks the lust away- "I must be tired." he shakes his head, he wanted more- for the boy to touch him a little higher, maybe grab something-there's no way it would ever happen. He laughs softly too himself, he feels drunk with hunger for this boy but he'd never act on it. He's John's boy after all- he can't do that.
As he lights his second cigarette a teenager walks by- stops and stares at him. One hand goes up in a awkward motionless wave, "Hello."
Castiel opens the car door, "Go to school, Dean." he repeats before getting in, Castiel speeds away and Dean almost runs after the car but he gives up before he tries. Castiel looks into the rear view mirror and sees the teen standing in the driveway - hugging himself and looking lost.
"You stalkin' me now?" Dean says, Castiel turns around to find him in the hallway instead of his classroom. He wasn't alone, he was with a boy the same age. Dean sees him staring at his friend so he introduces him, "This is Kevin, my friend."
His father didn't come to snuggle with him now that Castiel was home which only serves to confuse him. There's a feeling of loneliness when he wakes up early in the morning before everyone and goes to get himself a bowl of cereal in the kitchen. John comes into the kitchen to grab his coffee to go a little before eight in the morning and is completely oblivious to his sons presence as he leaves for work.
The teen is fucking into his stepfather while he remains standing until eventually his hips begin to feel tight at this angle, so he rests only one knee on the foot of the bed. It gives him better leverage and an even better angle, allowing him to go deeper and hit the mans prostate every single time. "Ughh-" his bottom lip is caught between his teeth and he shoves his cock in and out of the man at a very menacing pace due to his lack of experience, but they're both enjoying it anyhow.
men are going to hurt him. His eyes water a bit and he's biting the skin on the side of his thumb again, watching the television mindlessly.
"I know he rapes you." he looks over at the house behind Dean. "Your step dad. I saw him-"
"You want me to move in?"
That was the last thing he said to his younger brother Sam. He didn't tell anyone this but every year, on the night of his birthday he would always drive. Just
Dean shakes his head, "Not one bit. There were times my parents and I came close to being-" Castiel nods, not wanting him to say it. "-but thanks to you-" he pokes Castiel's nose, "-that never happened. I wasn't lying when I said you saved my life- you saved it in more ways than one."
Castiel laughs again, "You can't be serious-" they walk out the door together, "Seriously! I can't show up to work in that-" he looks at the car. "-that ugly old thing."
"What's going on here?" Castiel smiles, walking up the driveway as casually as possible. John had his head buried under the hood of his old impala. "She break down on you?"
Castiel closed his eyes, to keep the tears from falling.
Dean sighs loudly as he stomps up the porch steps to find that his surroundings extremely quiet. After giving the darkened property a once over, he heads inside the home to find his dear uncle asleep on the couch with a knocked over beer can on the coffee time. Poor uncle Bobby, always drinking himself to sleep- someone should really help him out with that and he thinks he should.
"We can't keep moving to run away from our problems-" Castiel says seriously and Dean sighs dramatically, "We'll come back sometime, it is nice-"
"Right." Castiel says unconvinced. "I guess I'll see you tonight?" Dean asks where. "My house?"
"Hey sweetheart." Dean beams at her when she comes by to take their orders, "Usual for us, thanks." she nods and heads to the kitchen.
"And mouthwash, quite the party huh?" Derek smiles, handing him the appointment card. "I'll see you in two days, I'll be helping the dentist."
His head tilts to the side and says,"You think I'm sick?"
"Good." Castiel sits on the sofa, relaxed. "By the way, Jack is outside-he wanted to talk to you." he says, unbothered.
Castiel was so used to Dean being a little more than musty after fixing a car or even when he was younger and came into the house after playing all day with Sam. But Robins a girl and girls don't like when boys stink, all that fussing over him- he could just picture it. Coming home after a long day of working and sweating his ass off at some shop, and then her nagging him to get in the shower before even getting the chance to kiss her. It would drive him
Dean almost looks to be in awe, mouth slacked open as he props himself on his elbows while still getting ridden by the man. "Ugh, God-" he sucks in a breath, looking completely smitten and aroused by the view above him. "Keep ridin' me-" he asks, because he's so damn
"I'll take you shopping." Castiel takes another bite of his burger. "There, problem solved." Dean nods sadly and digs into his meal. After they finish, Castiel takes out his wallet and calls Robin over so he can pay for lunch.
"Good-" he admits in shame, "-I like having him fuss over me. My mom never did when I was little, neither did my dad. I was so alone until he came along-" he blinks away fresh tears before they fall. "He's my everything- he's all I know."
Castiel finally says, "What-" because those green eyes feel like lasers on him. Finally he looks up and their eyes meet, "Why are you staring at me?"
John sniffles, "Yea-" before lighting another cigarette.
"Wait-" Dean begs, "Can you put it? I'm scared to." Castiel can't deny him when this pink lips pout in that pretty way. "Thanks." Castiel gets on his knees in front of him so he's at eye level and all he can think about are all the things he's done for this boy. He's massaging the thick cream onto his skin when he notices that Dean's getting hard. "Sorry." he apologizes.
He tosses the rake on the pile of dry leaves again and runs up to the fence, looking around and seeing nothing until he looks down the road- by Castiel's place. "Cas!" he shouts, the creepiest sensation floods his veins- it's not Castiel.
Dean treads carefully, not wanting to spill the beans about his relationship with the man on his first session back. "He died-" his hand grips the armrest of the small couch. "I woke up crying-" nails dig into the leather unintentionally. "In that moment, I didn't know if he was really dead or not-" inhales sharply, exhales slowly.
"You didn't finish-" Dean relaxes into the mattress, half of his body over his step father.
Seems like he bought it because Bobby says- "I thought gay men didn't like body hair." and digs into his second hot dog. Both Dean and Castiel exhale.
"Robin." he lies, his uncle glares at him. "Fine, Cas-" his uncle sighs heavily, they still haven't spoken about Dean's love confession the other night. "Bobby, are you gonna call the cops on him-" he asks.
"He gave me coke alright!" Dean hisses, pulling up the covers to his nose because he's freezing.
Castiel stops, "You're going to end up someones wife eventually. Wouldn't you rather be mine?" his tone is soft, caring even. "I'll protect you-" his thumb is caressing the teens plush bottom lip, "I'll make sure you're fed, watch over you in here-"
" I'm...Thirty shhixshh. " Dean covered his mouth on the second digit to make it not-audiable.
Dean shuts his eyes tightly, biting his lip.
Jo shakes her head, "I'm not ready, wait-"
"Protective over your dad huh?" the doctor laughs and the teen goes pink in the face. "So, what brings you here today? Aside from wanting to check for, you know-" he laughs again.
Dean doesn't hear him, he's spinning in circles-eyes scanning everywhere.
met but that isn't stopping Castiel because he's always looking at the pretty teen as if for the very first time and bats his non existent eyelashes his way.
with him-"
"Wasn't planning to." Castiel gently bites on his neck, Dean groans- "I need you-right here-" The teen nods and he pushes his seat backwards so hes laying down- "Come here-" Dean climbs over onto his lap, straddling him. "Fuck, I need you-"
"Damn it Cas-" he blushes, holding the box in his hands.
When  the movie ends Bobby snorts, "She couldn't name her cat until she belonged to someone?"
"Hmm-" he hums dreamily, not having the will power to kiss back at all. "Kinda like it-" his words a little slurred.
"Then what-" he chuckles, making a joke, "John came and raided your stash then, drank ya whiskey-"
"Shh-" John hisses angrily right before he comes all over his hand, traumatizing his son in the process. He keeps feeling his sons ass until his fingers lightly touch between his cheeks, "The fuck-" he almost laughs when his fingers come away a little bit sticky. "You like this-"
"Mmm-mmm-mm- Dean bites his lip, whimpering every time the cock in his ass punches in deeper. "-ugh-ugh-hmm-mmm-" he looks over his shoulder to see his step father pounding into him relentlessly. "Gonna-fuck- gonna come-" he moans into the pillow before spilling into the sheets once more and Castiel comes inside him- he can feel it, the hot warmth filing him up.
Love is love, regardless if there's a label on it or not.
When he wakes up in the morning he realizes that it completely slipped his mind to pick up Dean from school. Dean must have gotten home somehow, John must have gone to pick him up or maybe took the bus anyway. Castiel takes a quick shower and gets ready for work before going to check on the boy, he was nowhere to be found.
"Dean, we're different. I'm not as put together as you might think but I'm an adult and I have to act like it- I can't throw tantrums."
" BLAAAAACKKK, Like your soul you mean. Mhm of course. "
"Don't come crying to me when you can't sleep tonight." He smacks him on the head playfully and it's a good thing too because Bobby had been spying on them for a while. Satisfied that nothing strange was going on- he went to the bathroom to get ready for bed.
"Sure." Castiel nods, taking a big bite of his hot dog. "Just don't shoot yourself with it." it was meant as a joke, a notion- to be safe around guns but Dean took it to heart.
Castiel bangs on the door, "Dean, please-" he tries to remain calm, he's not angry- he's worried. "I don't want you to be alone right now. I'm afraid of what you might-"
Dean nods, "Where?" all logic is slipping away because he too, is rock hard and Castiel knew it- it was poking him in the hip the entire time.
The sunlight peeking through the wide open curtains is what wakes him up in the morning. Castiel gets out of bed with a frustrated groan, rushing over to get the boy ready for school and he complained of his stomach hurting while he handing him him clothes for the day. That he couldn't go to school because he was sick and he knew it was an excuse because he wanted to go with him to the station to pick up his father. After thinking about it for a minute, he agreed to let him tag along.
"So, you'll take it?" Castiel asks the young couple after he had given them the small tour of the place and explained everything they needed to know about it. They said
It was obvious though. Dean was Castiel's first in many other ways. In many other actions of love.
As they watch television in the living room, Castiel does notice that Dean is sitting really far away from him, all the way on the opposite end of the couch. "You okay?" he chuckles because this is weird. The boys shoulders move up and down quickly, eyes focused on the television. "Oh-kay-" he crosses his arms at his chest, eyes refocusing on the flickering screen, not at all hurt by the boys distance.
When he enters the room again, "Can we go home-" the boy asks with a sleepy yawn and he nods- holding hands all the way to the car that was parked outside in the middle of the nearly empty hospital parking lot.
As they walk slowly behind the crowd of inmates heading back into the prison building, Castiel takes Dean's hand and they run off around the corner to hide behind the air conditioning unit once again. They're breathless and smiling at one another as their backs rests against the industrial sized appliance until they catch their breath. It wasn't much of a long sprint, it was the adrenaline that was running through their veins.
Castiel leaves Dean to sleep it off in bed and he sneaks out early in the morning after a few short hours of troubled sleep- Sam is there on the sofa still passed out and he wishes the kid didn't show up but he's Dean's
is all his uncle says.
"That's right." Bobby stands up, "Who wants coffee?" they both reject his offer before he goes in search of some.
Castiel quickly takes the beans away, "Right, you're gassy enough as it is." and Bobby laughs in utter agreement.
"Thank you, sir. Thank you."
Dean shrugs, biting his lip. "Will I know if I'm gay?"
"He's nice is all-" Dean says, looking out the window as his forehead presses to the cold glass.
Spending the winter months here in Kansas.
He begins to panic internally, ignoring the boy next to him.
"You still want to marry me right?" Dean looks over at him, surprised by the question- he nods. "You should probably do your communion- I've looked through your fathers papers when he left, I found your birth certificate and everything else but nothing regarding your communion."
Castiel is a little taken aback by the breathtaking view, "Posing like that for me or the camera?" he comes close enough to stand behind him. His free hand just roaming the expanse of the teens glorious ass. "Either way, I'm a lucky man-"
"Then Go!" Dean rushes him out the door, "Save some lives."
he's feeling himself getting horny. He kinda likes when Castiel is firm with him and playing it cool.
Castiel gets up from the table, pulling out his chair. "Have a seat." Dean sits down, his eyes scan the dinner. There's salad, pasta and dessert.
"Yea." Dean finishes his food too, well barely- Bobby rushed him because they got Cas' cake in the truck.
Dean's caught so he just gives up pretending to sleep and opens his eyes, "Morning-" and he instantly wants to cry because he's not waking up in bed with his little brother.
Dean rolls over onto his stomach suddenly, eyes opening slowly to see the digital clock on his nightstand. It was only three in the morning, he must have had some kind of nightmare. He doesn't remember it all of it, but it was about his father. It must have been, he' woken up feeling strange and dirty, just like he used to feel at night as a boy. As soon as his eyes land on the empty space next to him it hits that his step father isn't there to offer comfort right then.
"Yes?" he asks, bracing himself for what's about to come out of his mouth.
After a while Bobby walks by and leans against the open doorway, Dean looks over at him and smiles softly, a little awkwardly.
When he opens his eyes in the morning he's alone in bed and he quickly goes in search for the man, "Cas!" he yells, looking through the house and finding him at the kitchen table with his nose hidden in a cup of coffee.
happy life. "You can be so annoying-" his voice is hard, but aroused.
boyfriend was chatting with another very much older man than himself and it pisses him off instantly. There's no way this is fucking happening, not on their first romantic getaway.
"I was helping mother around the house-she has trouble doing things now." Jack doesn't elaborate but Dean already knows she must be huge.
The boy had been disgusted with himself after getting Dean off earlier and had  prayed  himself to sleep for forgiveness.
He pulls away finally, spinning the chair to face his computer now. "I can't just steal the kid whenever I feel like it-" but he has, having already taken Dean several places. Just them two.
He watches from the window- observes how the two interact. They look like your average father and son, but what was that before? Bobby's confused. He could expect that kind of silly behavior from Dean, if he had reached over and licked ice cream of Castiel he may not have given it another thought. But Castiel did it. He licked ice cream off a teenagers mouth.
"Good, because I feel like you just got me pregnant." and he says that seriously, "Whew-" before sitting up, wiping his sweat dripping face with the towel he'd been thrown earlier.
" I'm nineteen...You're thirty-six...I- You're abusing me. "
"Yea, friends." he kinda wants to be friends with benefits and he's angry at himself for being such a slut. "Wish you were here, we'd have a lot of fun-" they sounds like actual teenagers right now as they speak, "My uncle is showing me how to shoot tomorrow, you'd love it-"
Cas-" it's arousing alone to know that something is about to happen.
"No reason-" A chill runs down their spines, "You havin' nightmares, boy?" Maybe Dean scratched himself during a nightmare they're both hopefully thinking.
Dean shivers, "Okay-" the word sounds unsure.
Castiel looked over his shoulder and didn't know if he liked the look in the mans eyes.
"Am I gonna see you again?" he looks up at him from where he is on the floor.
“No I mean it. Chain me to the bed or something so I don’t leave. “ Half was meant to be taken as a joke, the other half was a plea. “I never want to leave you.”
Benny reaches into his uniform jacket pocket, pulling out a yellow envelope. "These are all the pictures we found-" Dean nods, taking the envelope. "I took copies so I could show you-"
Dean got a reply instantly, ' DEAN! that's inappropriate right now because I was about to text you to come get me please I need you. ' he quickly read it and was about to type back a response when another text came through. '  My dad is out of control and is not allowing me to use my car. Get me out of here :( '
Castiel raises an eyebrow before taking a seat next to him. "Her husband is cheating on her with the babysitter, "I was merely comforting her." there's a knock on the door, "It's open!"
"You like Jo a lot don't you?" Castiel clears his throat, setting his phone down.
means and it doesn't involve communicating with words. "I don't think so baby-" his tone is sad. "I need to be alone tonight, can you understand that?"
The teen runs his hand down the older mans body until his hand is over his crotch and begins to grope with firm pressure. Instantly Castiel's eyes close because it does feel nice, like
"His name is Tommy-"
Castiel parks right in front of him and he rushes into the car, once he sits on the leather seat and feels the cool air from the vents hitting his face he sighs deeply.
Castiel looks over at him, "So do I, but that doesn't mean I'm going to get it-" and the admission sounds like he's made peace with it. The teen leans in and presses a kiss to the corner of his mouth, "You serious?" and his eyes lock on his. "When?" then he looks around, making sure no one was around to listen.
Pastor Jim speaks first, "Dean, you look well. I'm so sorry to hear about your mother and father-about them leaving."
Castiel makes breakfast while listening to the boy telling him the same jokes he's heard from his friend Sam at school. They aren't exactly all that funny but anything coming from his mouth makes him smile and laugh, mostly because of how cute he is. Once they're eating at the table, he can't help but look at the boys mouth chewing away on his breakfast.
Castiel laughs at his stupid joke,"You'll make a cute husband baby." and that makes Dean blush, "Love you, get to bed." he winks winks at him before leaving the young teen alone in the room once again.
When Castiel slowly pulls out of the twitching hole that doesn't seem to want to let him go, they both moan at the loss. He spreads the teens legs wide open again and bends him in half before diving in to kiss and lap and the puffy hole. Dean shivers, closing his eyes at how sensitive it feels right in this moment.
"Done-" Dean leans back on the wooden chair, exhausted. "That was good, thanks Bobby." When he looks at his empty plate he realizes how much he really ate and he doesn't know how to feel- Castiel knows what he's thinking.
The two bunk mates make the long walk through the dimly lit prison halls all the way to the showers. No one was ever there this early, usually five is when the early risers start flooding the place. Castiel turns on the shower and pulls the boy close to his fully nude body, "Why waste water-" his lips press against Dean's. Green eyes look the older man up and down, taking in the view of his nicely sculpted body.
Dean's eyes bug out of his skull for a second in anger, "You'd let them do that to me? how fucking dare you!" he charges at Castiel and he's ready to punch him yet again but he gets out of the way as soon as Meg and Chuck barge into the room at the first sign of yelling. Chuck pushes Dean back onto the bed, while Meg shoves a needle into his arm as fast as she can.
"Shit, sorry Bobby." Dean says, putting yet another button on his card and realizing he won. "-Bingo!" he calls out, all too happily. "What do I get?"
Castiel, with his mouth hanging open in shock and anger growled- “THAT...MOTHER-”
Castiel checks him out as he does so, "Sure, we're together." he presses a kiss to Johns lips and didn't mind the stubble one bit. "I like this-" he rubs the older mans hairy chest. "-my last boyfriend waxed."
"Okay-" he gulps down his juice until his cup is empty. "Can I call uncle Bobby on the phone-"
She smiles, "You are."
"Don't wanna wear a suit-" he whines and starts stomping on a family of ants that crawl by with his boot.
Castiel takes a deep breath before saying, "Dean, I want you to marry me-" the teen nods his head uncomfortably. His tone is soft and gentle, "I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Seeing you up there, on the alter-"
Dean pulls off his shirt before he pushes the lawn mower alongside the wooden fence, when he sees it again. It shouldn't be so shocking that he'd see it again.
“I can’t calm down!” Castiel lunged forward to punch Dean in the chest with his fists over and over again, it didn’t hurt Dean of course but it was worth a try to cause him some pain after what he was feeling. “Why don’t you want me anymore! You let me give you a blow job!” He hissed in anger. Tears rolling down his red cheeks one after the other. "Why didn't you stop me...you kissed me too."
"D-Dean?" Castiel stood there, in shock. He instantly felt like crying, he thought he must have fallen asleep and be dreaming this out of the blue reunion.
This is fucking
"Wait a minute-" She's confused, trying to catch up with him. "Dean, you know I'm very supportive of your orientation. But marry your step dad?" she repeats.
Bobby stops, "I won't-" and relaxes. "But I need to know what ya been doin' at his house, I wanna hear it-"
Dean’s eyes rolled back in his head, he opened the car door and instructed Castiel get out first. He followed, both basically running to the front door of the house. The older man fumbled with his keys as fast as he could. “Please hurry.” Castiel moaned.
Bobby sighs, "Ya wanna tell me what's got my boy so upset?"
When they reach Bobby's house Castiel basically just dumps him there without saying much. Dean worries about him so he calls every hour at least twice with no answer, texts also go ignired so eventually he goes over with cookies he had baked in the oven with his uncles help. Yes, Dean Winchester baked cookies for the man he loves and they probably aren't very good. What did his uncle think about this sweet gesture? He thought Castiel was sick or something since it's what the teen had implied.
It was a drunken kiss that Dean managed to catch when daddy walked his friend to his car one night after having dinner at the house. His new friend was around so much that mommy got tired- she told daddy she wanted time with just the family but he didn't listen, it wasn't until mommy caught them one night-
Both men were worried about him though, he hadn't spoken about what happened by the train tracks. Every time the news ran the story -
Castiel shakes his head, "If you didn't want to tempt me, you're failing." he licks his lips, his eyes looking over the sweaty body not five feet from him. "You're not even trying-"
"That hurt your teeth too?" he teases.
Dean speaks up softly, "Bobby-"
"Why do you say that?" she asks softly.
Castiel laughs, "I'm indoors, Dean, In air conditioning. What more could I ask for?" that makes the teen laugh. "Honestly, I don't know how
Castiel had been home all day. His friends busy with their own lives and his parents were out of town for the week. The weather outside was dreadful, heavy rain and thunder had been going on since he woke up that morning. He smiled though always having loved storms.
"You broke my nose-" Castiel coughs as a wave of nausea hits him because of all the blood dripping down his chin, "You're taking me to the hospital-" Dean's about to protest but the glare he's given has him quickly going for the keys. Castiel goes to the bathroom to change out of his bloody shirt, he also rinses his face off with warm water to get most of the blood off himself and in two minutes he's ready to go, the ice pack is still pressed to his face.
The boy breathed a sigh,"Yes yes, perfect." he led the way and Dean followed, tray in his hands.
"Was going to, sweetheart-" the southern drawl always makes him weak and John knows this. "Ready for me?" he's rolling on a condom and spitting on his hand to use as lube. "Legs open baby-"
The doctor nods, "How have you been feeling the fast few days?"
Dean grabs the mans strong shoulders to keep him at bay, "It looks kinda cool-" his voice is shy. His stepfather gets up and reaches into his closet for one of his belts, "What are you doing-" his eyes follow the mans movements. When the belt comes down, smacking the bed beside him- it turns him on. "Fuck, that's hot-"
"Your dad brought him over right? For dinner was it-"
"Nothing-" a vehicle pulls up, "That's our pizza, wait here." he gets up and goes over the delivery man and pays him. Soon he's walking up to the house again, "Let's eat, you must be starving." one hand is carrying the pizza, the other is guiding the boy through the door. "Have a seat, I'll serve you." Castiel works his way around the kitchen, looking for plates and something to drink and the boy climbs up onto one of the chairs at the table.
He's outside, hanging up the laundry on the clothes line when the back screen door slams shut. Castiel looks over his shoulder to see the short boy standing there, squinting at him in the morning's sunshine.
Castiel gets himself dressed as quick as he can manage before speeding down to the church because he's going to mass and no one can stop him. It's a free country after all, if he happens to catch a glimpse of Dean or run into him, that's the universe doing its thing.
Castiel groans deeply in his chest. "God, yes. I wanted that-" his voice is so rough and broken.
The teen simply nods in relief because poor Bobby, working himself too damn hard when he could be retired. The guy just needs to take it easy, maybe take on one project at a time instead of the workload he's got now. He worries about something else happening to his uncle, that scare he had not too long ago was enough to permanently scar him for life.
Castiel nods, "I'm going to bed."
"Yea-" he sighs, finally leaning back against the couch "I want to talk about-" and hesitates before lifting the sleeve of his sweater. "-these."
His eyes carefully examine his surroundings- he hadn't noticed how drenched in sweat he'd been. His jeans had been soaked through just like the shirt he took off had been.
"You're so fucking tight-" he pushes in as deep as he can, at an angle that has Dean crying in pleasure. "-love this ass so much." he continues fucking his boy until he comes inside the wet heat, though he continues until Dean has to come. "You close baby?"
"I took Dean to get a Halloween costume-" the mechanic laughs and lets him go. "Did you know he wasn't in school today?" he shrugs and reaches for the bag on the table. Castiel bites his tongue once more and goes to check on the boy- he was in his room, looking at a bruise on his hip. "How'd you get that-" his voice is full of concern.
Dean bites his lip because he's fucking horny too, "Did you have a big dick in high school?" the man nods eagerly. "Guess none of the girls in your class ever give you a second look huh daddy- with your sweaters and glasses, they thought you were just a fucking loser."
He could admit it was pretty pathetic of himself to beg his sister to drive him to his boyfriend’s house after midnight just to see if the giant batmobile looking car was in the driveway, but he had to know the truth.
The car honked.
Castiel doesn't like this one bit because he's feeling like Dean's forgetting all about him. "Bathroom-" he gets up and disappears down the hall as well. He knocks gently on teens door, "Dean-" and peeks inside to see him laying in bed with his eyes closed.
They head in together and the bell on the door jingles when it opens and closes behind them. Castiel goes off alone to find a table to sit at while Dean meets with his friend because It's kind of embarrassing and he was way too damn shy to give her this type of gift right in front of the man who fucks him, so privacy was begged for. It really was going to look like a boyfriend giving his little girlfriend a present but whatever.
"I couldn't sleep all night, I was thinking about what you told me back at the cabin. You being homeless-"
Dean nods and leans forward to whisper, "Bet it took a lot of self control not to just fuck all the sluts in your class huh, bend them over the desk and just pound their fucking pussies-" he moans weakly, nodding. "Imagine, them coming all over your big fucking dick-"
"Dean, I'm very good at my job. Your little weekly injection is nothing compared to what I do at work."
Dean gets up, "Can I walk her home?" Castiel nods. He's relieved he walked in on them when he did.
"I really don't." Castiel clears his throat. "Your dad punched me once."
"I understand-" Castiel clears his throat, "For what it's worth, it's killing me-" they make eye contact again. "Not having you is killing me."
' Dean keeps telling him, in the most loving way he can manage.
A few days later after they finished their Christmas tree, Dean and Castiel are on the couch in the living room. The two of them are simply enjoying how pretty the tree turned out when the door slams shut and they straighten up as if they had been doing something they shouldn't have.
After getting the all clear, they pack a bag with a few things and completely forget to bring a blanket. It's not like they needed much of anything, this was only a one day trip- no more, no less.
The following night, Dean's cornered in the shower by one of the bigger guys. "Come on, let me go-" his tone is one of annoyance because he's been pissed for the last week. Not getting enough food or a cigarette had him in a certain kind of mood. "Seriously, move-" he states angrily. The man grabs him by the shoulders and throws him on the floor, flipping him over onto his stomach roughly. "Help!" he shrieks, "Somebody help me!"
"Sure, Cas." Dean nods, he doesn't really want to do chores but it's extra cash.
" Gnn- " He let out a strangled noise Castiel never heard himself make and surprised by it.
When he got home from the store he fell on his bed, staring at the ceiling and thinking of Mr.Winchester.
"Jimmy huh?"
"Do you think Dean's doing this- without knowing? or is it something
"We're done." Castiel bites out, "Tomorrow I have the day off and I'm getting you a new bed so you can sleep in your room." with that Castiel locks himself in the bathroom, then the water for the shower turns on.
their breathing stutters in unison. "They're cowards, that's why they hurt other people. It's how they feel strong-"
"If you were a girl I'd just buy you a designer purse and call it a day-" he pulls up to the dirt road that leads to the house. The comment was meant to be a joke, even if it is what he would do if he had a girlfriend. "-but you're not a girl."
"I'll wash this for you." Castiel rolls up the dirty shirt and holds onto it while Dean gets up and walks to the door, "I love you-" he says somberly, "I miss you-"
Castiel nods, "Yeah-" and pulls the blanket over his sticky and sweaty body in humiliation. "Why did you make me call you-" he can't say it, "-that."
Castiel looks away, "We both wanted it-" and swallows the emotion. "But I raped him, no matter how you want to  look at it-"
all the time, but I can't. I'm getting older and It's harder to keep drinking. I drink all the damn time, and no one says a thing. I'm not doing it for the attention but fuck, you'd think Sam being the health nut he is would beg me to drink some water once in a while. All I eat are chips and candy bars and all I drink is booze, I have no clue how I'm even alive.
Dean spends an hour laying in his uncomfortable twin bed that needs replacing until he pulls out his phone, quickly typing out a message to Jack- asking if he could sleep over. It's passed midnight by now but he's got a hunch that his young friend is wide awake and when his phone pings with a reply he smiles. He dials Jack- "Can I come over?" he asks as soon as a small voice says hello on the other end of the line.
Dean must have forgotten to eat that day and he knew it. Castiel decided that he would stay right here tonight, to watch over him and make sure he eats a good breakfast in the morning. The teen can be so careless at times, forgetting to eat and making bad decisions on occasion.
The cops watch the interaction between the two men in complete silence, mostly just looking uncomfortable in this situation.
The teen sucks on it innocently while Castiel watches him, their eyes meet occasionally but they say nothing. When the sweet is gone, the older man sits down on the bunk next to him and the goods.
"You think we'll get a tornado?" Castiel asks, looking around, hands on his hips in concern.
dream about him opens new doors,
"I'll call in the morning, if it's available- we'll rent it." he's beyond humiliated right now, he's being kicked out of his home but it would be good to have a his own place with Dean again. They won't have to sneak around anymore behind closed doors.
"We're here-" she sing songs.
The teen makes obnoxious gagging sounds when his stepfather tightens the tie around his neck. The man rolls his eyes and they spend a quick few minutes standing in the dressing room, just eye fucking each other in their suits.
After several minutes in the bathroom someone was knocking at the door. "Sorry it's busy." he called out shyly. The knocking persisted. He unlocked the door and as soon as he did Dean burst into the bathroom; locking the door behind him.
"You like that, don't you slut-" John breathes into his ear.
Is he going to
Castiel doesn't hear him over the TV so he opens the door enough to peek his head in, that's when he notices him and turns off the TV. "Are you okay?"
This was news to Castiel, "Since when?"
"Ready-" Dean drops the towel on the floor and Castiel helps him step into his Hulk underwear, then his pajama pants, and his shirt.
Throughout the day Castiel had managed to tear up every time he sees a young boy coming into the ER, it's hard to tell if he just doesn't want Dean to get older or if he's just yearning for a child of his own. It's so confusing because he'd given up on that dream a long time ago but he would definitely be open to kids if Dean had wanted them, though he's not so sure about what his opinions are on the subject.
"Yea-a big one." he blushes again. Being at Bobby's is doing quite a few wonders for their sex life. That night Dean catches his uncle outside- "Hey, what are you doing out here." he asks, stepping out.
"And Cas-" Dean's looking up at him, green eyes wide. "I remember something else...I never said anything. Ever."
does. Though in his mind he's assuming there must be logical explanation, perhaps guilt or grief. They both know they haven't really processed it and moved on pretty quickly after they dumped his ashes.
"Ready?"
"So-" Dean exhales smoke through his nostrils, somewhat like a bull. "Where are your folks at?"
Dean's nose scrunches up, "You're really old-" and the doctor doesn't take offense to that, simply laughed- laughed even harder when the boy started counting something on his fingers.
After taking a nap he goes to the hardware store and picks up a few cans of paint and a giant tub of spackle, there were many holes and marks on the walls he had to cover up to make it look like no one had ever lived there, especially a Winchester. He also got some curtains for the living room and the bedrooms- he figured the nicer the place looked, the greater the chance of the couple wanting to rent the place right there on the spot. Castiel heads to Dean's old room first to get started on the paint job- after he spackled the holes in the walls and smoothed out the various curse words Dean had carved into the walls during his years in this room he began to paint.
The teen is looking down at his boots when he quietly confesses, "I love him-" looks up to meet her eyes because she's not saying anything. "I'm in
"You know you can talk to me." Castiel reassures him. Another flash of blue light.
"Sure." He turns the page of the book he had been reading. Dean's against him in bed eating his soup in silence. He reads for another ten minutes before deciding to put his book away for the night, "How are you feeling?"
Dean gets up and the teacher asks him to stay behind. "Am I in trouble?" he reluctantly stays behind, watching everyone else leave the room.
Dean pouts, "Once a day?"
"Since it's too hot to cook, I'm thinkin' sandwiches for dinner, want one?"
When he's done eating he asks Castiel, "Join me out front for a beer?" and he grabs two beers from the fridge. Castiel nods, giving Dean a look of
"Have you had sex with a girl before?" Castiel turns around to see Dean at the table with his chin to his hand, like he wants a full report on his sex life. "What, I'm curious."
"I doubt that. You were always with Sam-"
Castiel calls him, "I'm a wuss?" he husks into the phone as soon as Dean picks up. "I'd fuck you right now if you were here."
Dean tries not to smile at the compliment but his cheeks are telling a different story. "Yea-" after a moment of silence. "Are we going to move again someday?" and the question is asked without him looking up at his stepfather.
Dean smiles devilishly, "Yea? Did you have to jack off a lot -" his voice is more of a cooing, as if he were talking to a little baby.
The teen yawns with a subtle nod in agreement before going and doing just that. The bed feels like heaven as soon as he lets himself fall onto it, though before he has a chance to fully drift off to sleep the bedroom door is lightly kicked open by Castiel and the aroma of bacon and pancakes hits his nostrils.
Dean tries to stand, he doesn't like this conversation- he never does. Castiel's strong hand pushes him back down to sit.
Castiel's logic returns and he pushes him away, "Go to bed before we get caught." Dean pouts, "Go-" he points towards the bedrooms and off he goes, stomping his bare feet on the wooden floor as he walks to his room. "Fuck-" he lays back on the couch and passes out.
It was the weekend and Castiel didn't bother waking Dean up early. Taking care of Dean has tired him out, along with working so many hours. He works only a few days a week but they are always stressful long hours at the hospital. When John was still here, he usually took care of the outdoor chores like mowing the lawn and he usually handled the more domestic chores like laundry, cleaning and cooking as well as the grocery shopping. Now that he thinks about it, John didn't really contribute anything. He even helped Dean with his homework. Castiel figured he would wake up early and mow the lawn himself before it got too hot outside.
"Was therapy that bad?" he places his hand on the boys shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze. "Come on, anything you want to do? We could order a pizza-"
"Is it a heavy flow?" He grins, picking up a package for heavy flow. She nods so he takes two packages. "That all you need?" She nods again. They head to the check out lane and Dean being the gentlemen he is, pays for her hygiene products. "Wait, this too-" he tells the cashier as he reaches over and grabs a few chocolate bars. She smiles at him.
Dean rolled his eyes, “I just woke you up. Seriously? Yea.”
Bobby and Castiel glare at each other for a few seconds, "We were up all night?"
The trunk popped open and he was given the go ahead to place the grocery bag's inside.
There's a knock at his door, startling him. "Yea?" he calls out.
That was all Castiel sent him in response but it was enough to make his heart drop down to his stomach. Dean re-reads all his messages and regrets ever sending them. He doesn't know why does all this, maybe he's crazy. Those thoughts run wild through his mind- he's got a good guy by his side and he's ruined it for a few minutes of fun with Lisa.
"So uh-" now the teen is leaning against the bathroom door frame, looking at his stepfather rinse out his mouth over the sink. "When do you think we can do that?"
"Go ahead without me-" Bobby says from the front seat of Castiel's car, "Darn knee is actin' up-" his hand rubs up and down his kneecap. "Jus' leave the air on will ya-" Castiel nods and they get out of the car, leaving him behind.
Castiel gets off the boy and stands above him, "You're so pretty, Dean. Your pretty lips alone drive me crazy-" he unbuttons the casual shirt hes wearing, letting it fall off his shoulders. His eyes travel down the teens body, "I could bury my cock deep in that juicy ass of yours for hours." he strips out of his pants, "Take off your shirt. Pants too."
The next day- they did shoot as promised by uncle Bobby. It was a breezy overcast day- perfect day to learn how to use a gun. "Thanks, Bobby." Dean smiles as they line up some glass beer bottles and soda cans on top of the wooden fence.
Kevin says, "I'll come hang out with you soon-" as they walk to his mothers car by the fence.
"You knew?" Dean looks down at his wounded wrist- Castiel nods. With that Dean stands up, takes the towel handed to him and begins to dry off. "Can you go-I-I need to be alone." Castiel looks like he doesn't want to leave him, "Not gonna do nothin'-gotta use the bathroom." He nods and once again he's left alone. Dean sits on the toilet and cries for a few minutes as he tries to catch his breath so he can get dressed. He knows Castiel would have helped him dress, but he just can't let him do that. He doesn't want to be a kid who needs help anymore- he wants Castiel to see him as his partner.
It was almost closing time so he didn't know what could possibly be accomplished in there. Castiel pushes the door open, "John?" his voice is extremely raspy. The older man locks the door and shoves him into one of the only two stalls, kissing him frantically. "Fuck-" he curses because a heavy hand was rubbing deliciously on his crotch.
Dean's pouring too much cream into his coffee and mumbles- "Yea I know." he looks distracted.
It was rare to find the home empty this late without being given a heads up, actually this has
"That's not what I'm mad at!" she yells, shoving him away."I'm mad you took my virginity and left- You didn't even call the next day! And now my body hurts all over and I'm bleeding!"
The teenager nods with his hands in his jeans pockets. "Whatever, you threatened to call the cops on Cas. On Cas for fucks sake! The guy is practically a friggin' saint!"
All three of them sleep in way to late for breakfast, they awake around noon- as discussed, Bobby treats them to lunch at the local diner. It's a bit cramped in Bobby's truck- with Dean sitting in the middle since he's the smallest. "You still like burgers?" his uncle asks him, "They got a damn good burger."
After both boys were showered and ready for bed, Sam looks at him - "Where's your dad?"
"You do? Since when?" he's actually surprised by this fact.
"Hmm?" he hums in response, closing his eyes once more.
Bobby wasn't there, unfortunately, but they had a fucking
Dean takes the bag and opens it, fries. "Thanks." They wave goodbye and he drives back to the house. As he heads up the porch steps his phone rings, he hurries inside and goes to his room. "Cas-" he sighs, "I'm so glad you called."
"But am I pretty?"
Bobby leaves the teen standing by the dead bird, his rifle back in his care. "He's out here killing birds-" he walks passed him.
Dean looks outside to the other men who are staring at him, they looked more like gang members rather than technicians.
"At me." Dean nods, "I'm sorry but I didn't want you going anywhere today, after yesterday-"
"I'm not going to worry just yet, it takes time to get them within normal range." Castiel puts the chart away, and starts preparing the injection he had brought with him, Dean hadn't seen it until just now.
Dean's head snapped up and he flicked whipped cream at him. " THAT. BOY. Is not funny. "
“Tell me. Please.”
"You're breaking up with me?" Dean sobs silently, Bobby was just outside fixing a car.
They all nod and secretly cast hateful glances at Mildred for ruining their evening because they actually liked Castiel and were becoming his friends. It didn't start off that way at first though, they saw that he was a doctor and who wouldn't want to bag one of those but the more they talked to the man and spent time with him, they saw that he was a great person.
When he's done he cleans Dean's neck off with that same towel, getting all the fallen hair off his skin. "You look real handsome baby." Castiel comments, kissing behind his ear. "Going home?"
"Turn around-" the guard asks stiffly and he obeys, "Squat down and cough-" that has the nervous teen looking over his shoulder. "It's standard procedure-" he sighs. "To make sure there's no contraband in, you know-"
"Wanna go to church tomorrow?" Castiel asks.
Dean sways back and forth, thinking of which one he wants. "Um, black?"
Dean was oblivious, his eyes were focused on the screen the entire time. Like the cliche, their hands touch by accident when they reach for their soda.
Dean grunts again painfully before being allowed to fall on the floor, on his knees. "Agh-" a large hand is roughly gripping the back of his head, pulling backwards so that his eyes can meet blue. "You're hurting me-" his eyes sting with tears because he's afraid of the guy, regretting ever taking his
After a few minute's when Cas didn't return he looked up from his Blackberry to find him talking to a guy behind the counter. A Starbuck's barista. Dean cringed but kept his calm because he heard him say goodbye and was walking back to their table near the back of the coffee shop.
feelings.
Castiel lets it go, because his cat most likely had been mauled to death by something. "I know you're upset about the cat-" the teen shakes his head, biting on the skin of his thumb. He wraps an arm around him, pulling him close. "I missed you, work's been-"
he doesn't feel better. He feels like death is an inch away and he doesn't know why- he's healthy. His lab results prove he's healthy. It scares him that this might just all be in his
