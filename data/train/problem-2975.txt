“It's not your problem, Dean,” Castiel replied in annoyance. He was starting to wonder if kissing Dean had made him think they were friends again or something.
5.) Castiel brags about baby in front of Bella at LEAST once
"Ok, so Castiel, you said you are great with a bow correct?" Cas nodded. "Great, then you will be Charlie and I's partner. You two's job is to hide in the trees. I noticed you already like trees quite a bit Cas and Charlie is already part monkey. If disaster comes then Charlie will snipe at people from the trees and Cas, you help me hide somewhere. Like you said, I'm useless until further notice.
As Castiel walked down to the hot tub, he tried to erase the memory of Sam with sex hair out of his mind. He was pretty sure the only thing that would be worse than that would be if he had walked in on Gabriel having sex. He shuddered mentally.
Castiel looked down at his burger and milkshake and his stomach growled. He sighed in defeat.
"Sorry buddy, but that boy on the floor over there needs help. And the boy behind you wants to stab you. So just let the nice girl go and we let you loose."
Dean ceased the twisting motion. He pushed off Castiel's back again, thrusting with his arm now, just holding his fingers straight and still as he fucks. Lightning erupted up Castiel's spine. He obeyed his body's desire and held still for it again. He just let Dean do it, just laid there with his legs spread so wide they ached and let Dean make him feel better than perhaps ever he had.
He felt someone grab his shoulder and he turned around quickly, pressing a knife to her throat.
District 12 - Dean - 11, Joanna - 8
“Oh I do, but when I tease it is from a place of love. When Bella teases it is from a place of pure evil and skankiness.” She slung an arm over his shoulder but he was too tall so she settled for just pushing his back to get him moving in the direction she wanted him to move in. “Besides, the coat is cool. Now let’s go, I wanna show you my thing.
Dean replied right away.
Castiel was stunned.
_--_+_--_
Charlie turned to Castiel, “your room?” He nodded.
“Where did you get this?” Dean asked while he looked down at it. Castiel took the borrowed time to think over what he had learned.
Dean felt his face go hot, "well if you win these games what would you like to do?"
“Sorry Hannah, got to go.” Dean grabbed Jo and dragged her over to the chariot. Making nice with a career like that cocky asshole did not interest him in the slightest.
Bobby smiled and slapped his back, “atta boy.”
“What is up with the wings?” Jo asked before he could reach her. The girl that she was behind turned around and tilted her head.
“Well, you better go say hi,” Castiel backed away from him.
“No clue. I just met him.”
“Jo, you are making it needlessly weird again. Why are you like this?”
Dean has a drawer in his room that nobody knows the true contents of. Not even Sam knows of it. He hadn't looked through it since he went to hell and just avoided it altogether once he discovered what Cas had done.
Castiel gave him a look that he hoped would portray how stupid of an idea Dean’s suggestion was. “Please tell me why you think that’s a good idea.”
“Look,” Dean started, “I wanted to say that I really… I appreciate it, but it's never gonna happen”
“Oh! Okay.” Castiel nodded. “It is a nice car.”
Her cheeks flushed with anger. “I didn’t make the rules, Dean! Should she just get to come for free? How is that fair to everybody else?”
“Dean, I did the black diamond!” Sam said excitedly. “I beat Gabe!”
To avoid reading the assault just skip the kitchen scene to when Castiel is with Dean in the bedroom trying to calm him down. Basically Lee kisses Castiel, which is all you really need to know.
“Well welcome to my party,” Lee cheerfully patted Castiel on the shoulder.  He leaned forward and gave him a conspiratory wink, “but the real party is going to start later if you know what I mean.”
“I was wondering about how much I should remain faithful to the divorce laws of the 18th century for my newest novel,” Castiel lied.
Dean nodded slowly, “well how about I make you a deal. You finish up your food instead of blatantly trying to escape me, and I will give you a ride home. Deal?”
“Okay, so you got one gay person. Unfortunately, she is a lesbian.”
"You do? I thought it was the other way around." Castiel's blue eyes shone with intensity and Dean was suddenly very distracted with the little violet flecks. Cas deliberately looked down to Dean's lips and back up, his heart raced and he had no idea what to do. The blue eyes told him to lean in but the cameras he knew where on them told him no. Also the very obvious part, Castiel was pulling a Charlie.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay Kev, on a scale from one to ten how much does it hurt?”
Castiel nodded, embarrassed that she knew exactly where he was despite her constant nagging that it wasn’t healthy. “Yeah. I left my bag in his car. Can you throw down the spare keys?”
Castiel glared at him. “I’ll pretend to date you to make Bella jealous.”
“The least you could do was sit next to me on the bus!” he bursts out.
“Hey Angel,” Dean kissed Castiel's cheek when they got there.
“Well any excuse to show off my baby,” Dean grinned.
Of course, as soon as he said that, Michael turned around and waved, proving Castiel wrong. Something which Gabe and Jody proceeded to tease him for, for at least an hour afterward. Mainly because Castiel had been a drama queen.
“Do you want to be a, vampire,” he shot back. She scoffed and took a sip. It was then that the smell hit him. “Oh son of a bitch,” he muttered. He had forgotten about Gordon’s corpse.
“I finished the first draft of my next novel, it's really rough but I'm just glad it’s over. Now, the editors get to butcher it and I could not care less”
Castiel clutched at his shoulders, his hair, and what began as a bright stinging pain dulled to heat and ache. What seemed like too much a moment ago was now so perfect. Once again, he was spreading his legs, opening himself, and Dean was there to fill him. He pumped Castiel full over and over, and the slick friction had Castiel's mouth dropping open. Dean whipped his hips and instead of being painful, it was just right.
“What is the plan for today then guys?” Jo asked. Charlie scrambled out of the hole in the ground.
“Alright, whatcha wanna talk about?” He stole the bag of chips from Castiel and opened it.
“Set the mood?” close enough.
"O-okay." For the first time, it was Dean who sounded a bit scared.
Dean bumped into a boy with golden, hazel, eyes. He smirked at Dean with a ‘you wanna go bro?’ expression on his face. It was Gabriel. Dean nudged his head in the direction of the woods and Gabe ran off. Dean saw a wicked curved blade at his side, coated in blood. He didn’t want to think of whose it was.
“Everyone knows that.” Castiel bristled at that. “Who else?” Dean asked.
"Dean, I want to help you and yet everything in your life has been you sacrificing yourself so that job sounds nearly impossible." Cas had shoved his face into Dean's and was breathing heavy in anger.
“No but I saw a burger king back that way. Does that work instead?” Jody and Alfie’s voices faded out.
“What do I do?” He asked panicked.
"I write romance novels," Castiel repeated. "I write novels with cheesy storylines and happy endings. There isn't any second guessing about how people feel because it is so painfully obvious. When there are declarations, it is dramatic and big and completely expected."
“Yeah yeah, let’s just go get some food and a bed from him. I hope you know taking care of him is your responsibility. I’ll pay for the supplies if you do the manual labor.”
The white cloth was a little dirty but Dean couldn't see any blood.
“Please,” Castiel begged, “I need at least one sane person there with me.”
“Come on Castiel,” she said good-naturedly when she saw the look on her face, “It's only gonna take a second. Just smile.” He groaned but stood next to his brother and cousin.
"Luci and Mr. Boo Boo are busy. I was put on watch."
Ellen smiled warmly at him, “you just sit tight boy.”
"Oh, he is pulling a Charlie." Jo wasn't full on sobbing anymore and Dean held out his arms for a hug. She practically leaped her way into his arms and he held her close, regardless of the blood soaked in her clothes. He so she wouldn't notice he reached in Kevin's pocket for his token. The boy had shown him before the games, excited to be able to talk with his new ally. It was the symbol of district three carved into wood with his name in something called binary surrounding it.
"Yes, actually.”
Jo sighed in defeat, giving Charlie an unreadable look, “yeah. I guess I am.”
Anna opened the window and leaned her head out. “Hey. Did Winchester leave already?”
“Why are you here Cas?”
"Shut up Jo."
In exchange for the tutoring, Dean taught Castiel how to cook. Soon he knew how to make pasta without it being too raw or mushy, how to make homemade meatballs, and the perfect recipe for lasagna.
He wanted to hit her for saying that. “I’m literally a couple of months younger than you.” Anna laughed and they pulled away.
“Alright Alfie, you’re up.”
That was when Dean noticed the stars, or lack thereof. He must have fallen asleep. Suddenly it came back to him, the story and Castiel’s brilliant blue eyes. “Son of a bitch,” he muttered searching for Cas.
Dean smiled and his cheeks turned red, “well the first is that I kinda already knew you were Misha Collins. Since your very first book came out.”
“Come on Cas, you have to uphold your half of the bet,” reasoned Dean softly holding out his hand.
“Oh, so you wanna use me as your pawn?”
Dean practically growled as he dragged Castiel down and flipped them over so that Dean was on top.  Then he began to kiss him within every inch of his life.
“What?” Charlie sputtered. “No!”
He fumbled around blindly under the deck, feeling around in the dark for the spare keys they kept hidden under the flowerpot. Then he remembered that the spare keys were in the junk drawer, in the house, because Gabe forgot to put them back the last time he got locked out. Castiel had no keys, no phone, no way of getting into the house.
Dean smiled in excitement. “Really?”
"Great, you get to sign it first."
“Well I’m sure as hell not gonna stop you,” Dean said breathlessly.
"Uh, what?" It seemed like, just like with Castiel, that was the last thing Dean had expected him to say.
Cas smiled, “yes Dean. When will you learn that I do what I want?”
“I know,” Castiel reassured him.
“Well, I was under the impression that on dates the two people usually ate at the same time. And well, you’re the one who wanted it to be a date.”
The jabbing didn’t stop.
Jo shook her hand and asked again, “what is with the wings?”
She was probably right, Castiel looked down at his own cocoa. “Should I go check on him? Just to see if he’s okay?”
“Anyways, returning to the task at at hand,” the long haired man gestured towards the camera.
District 3 - Kevin - 5, Charlie - 9
Jo frowned even more so, “who could have killed us Dean?”
Charlie just blushed deeply.
2.) No snitching
“Feeling more self-confident?” Dean asked. Castiel tried not to notice how Dean’s lips looked slightly reddened and his cheeks were flushed. Castiel could only nod in response. Dean’s grin widened and he clapped his hands once. “How about we cut up the brownies and put them in sandwich bags for the bake sale while the pie cools?” Mutely Castiel followed his lead.
“Well I know I’m a good lay but I don’t know how you can stand to look a me. I mean look,” he gestured to one of his many scars on his arms.
Dean pulled Castiel in front of him and put his arms around him. “I’ll keep you warm.” Castiel looked up at him and rolled his eyes at his cheesiness, but Dean’s attention was somewhere else. He was watching Bella. Castiel felt a familiar pit of jealousy in his stomach. Dean snuggled against his neck, but Castiel squirmed away from him.
Dean turned around in surprise, “my loves! You have returned! Michael darling, how is your boo boo.” Dean started to walk away from the hole to divert their attention.
“Anyways I shall be turning this video off before I can be insulted anymore. So you know what to do. Give this video a thumbs up if you want more and subscribe if you haven't already. Also, comment below a YouTube name for Sam and I will tweet my five favorites and who suggested them. Lastly survive to Kevin because his videos are awesome and survive to Charlie because if you don't then she will kill me.” A laugh rose from Kevin. “This is impala67 signing out. Bye!” The screen froze on his wave and Sam’s bitchface.
Dean laughed at that, “shouldn’t I be the one trying to make you feel better?”
"BOOM."
“I don’t know, but I am loving this,” Gabe said excitedly. He ran over towards a small kitten who was playing with a scratching post. Castiel decided to remain where he was while the rest of his family was going around looking at pets that Jody would eventually say no to when she regained her senses.
“Okay, Charlie Bradbury.”
“Ooh, who knew. Sass does go to the man with a perfect ass.” Meg nodded to the district six girl who walked forward and sank a knife into the little girls chest. Dean stared at the little girl, masking his horror with a laugh. Meg raised her eyebrow, “what is so funny.”
Dean gave him a half-smile. “Will you give me just ten minutes. Ten minutes to explain everything.” Castiel repressed a smile, so Dean had gotten his message. He nodded mutely in agreement. A wide smile of relief stretched across Dean’s face. He took a step back and held the door gesturing for Castiel to come inside.
_--_+_--_
“Yes,” Castiel replied without hesitation.
She popped her head out of the cave and relief filled her features, “oh thank god. Dean I woke up and you weren’t here.”
Castiel couldn't help but smile at that. "Then I suspect I'm asking for two."
“You want us to sign this? I thought you thought it was stupid.”
Cas shifted and turned to stare at Dean with a curious expression on his face. "You truly wish to know?"
“Are you asking or telling.”
“Yeah?” Dean took his last bite of scampi and brought their bowls over to the sink to wash.
those things?” She managed to get the whole sentence out before her lungs decided to get more water out.
“Sorry?” Castiel cocked his head in confusion.
They stood there in silence, staring at each other awkwardly for a couple of moments. Castiel nervously stared him down, trying to figure out exactly what he wanted to say. Finally, Dean broke the silence.
"Dean, you help Jo up and then go get Cas, okay? We all kind of need you right now but she trusts you more than we could ever claim to." As if to prove her point Jo hugged Dean tighter.
“The poor guy. He stares at you like you’re the stars and you think he barely even considers you a friend.”
“What happened?” Charlie hissed as Dean adjusted Kevin carefully. The dull ache in his side momentarily flared up. He had forgotten about it until that moment.
“Hey,” Castiel said.
“Oh right.”
“I’m not worried about having sex,” Castiel waved him off, “it’s nothing I haven’t done before. I’m worried about dealing with all the other psychopathic high schoolers.” He realized his mistake immediately when Charlie and Jo stared at him and gleeful surprise.
“Boom bitches, now down to the Queen of Moondoor and her handmaiden,” she shouted as Dean put points under each of their names.
The two of them stared each other down while Dean gaped at Castiel. When nothing came out Castiel was both disappointed and unsurprised. “Goodbye, Dean.” He pulled his wrist free and turned to leave.
“Should we help?” Dean asked.
“Hey Cassie,” Lee slurred as he made his way over to him. He looked completely drunk as he stumbled his way over.
“I actually haven’t,” Dean said. Castiel stared at him in abject horror.
“I’m not with him,” Castiel blurted out then winced at his rudeness. “And Ellen is getting me something anyways. Thank you though.” The waitress nodded and walked away towards the kitchen.
“Wait I know,” Charlie grinned, “the party right? You two disappeared so early everybody was talking about it.”
He turned his head, “exactly Cas, you lost your wings for me.”
The next night, Castiel and Dean were at the Roadhouse to study for a few hours. Well, Castiel studied, and Dean kept trying to distract him by asking about Michael and being nosy about what Castiel was learning instead of doing his own work.
“Parking in a spot isn’t part of the driving test,” Castiel reminded Gabe.
She snorted, “don't forget the two hours we spent on omegle hoping to get a one on one conversation with him.”
"Can I… kiss you?" Dean asks at his ear. Castiel turned, slinking his arms around Dean's neck. Their lips meet, and for a strange moment, it's so gentle. Then Dean smiles; Castiel smiles. Dean opened Castiel's lips and deepened it. Castiel relished the strength in him, the heat of his skin.
The other girl looked at her hands sadly, “just because I might have to doesn’t mean I want to you know.” She reached for the sticks, “try moving the sticks up and down as you rub them together, all right?” She held his hands and moved them slowly, “like this.”
“Wh-what? I never. That’s-” Castiel sputtered, flustered.
“It doesn’t matter, I already knew that.” Charlie had tried to tell him that a while back but Castiel didn’t put much stock in that. Bella was dating some college guy again so she had probably rejected Dean. “Look, I know Dean didn’t even like me back. I accepted that a while ago, I am just experiencing emotional turmoil after heartbreak which I understand is common.”
Castiel groaned in defeat. “Okay, okay. Fine. Fine. Um… It's Anna Milton?”.
Castiel had a quick flash of Bella and Dean on the bus with their heads close together, and the picture made his heart squeeze. He looked down at his hands, trying to think of what to say to that.
Jo gave her a weird look, “you’re going?”
"What for?" Dean tied off the ends of the first vine and went for another one.
“Excellent thing that you asked, I want you to make friends and work on distance weapons. Okay?” Jo looked at him with a raised eyebrow and he seemed to catch the meaning, “You are much more likable than Princess grumpy over there,” Dean growled in a challenge but Bobby ignored him, “and you need to look as if you have things to learn. People overlook the people who need to figure things out as weak. If they don’t even see Dean working on fighting they will either assume that he is too weak or too skilled or just another district twelve moron.”
“Alright. Castiel, I promise to stop making fun of you until you fail at parking again.” Castiel chose not to acknowledge that.
Castiel looked around the hall and noticed everyone staring at him for the first time. Some sophomore girls were staring at him hungrily and several others were holding his books in their hands. He swallowed nervously.
“Text Jody, tell her you’re hanging with me tonight.” He changed his direction signal and turned in the other direction.
He huffed and carefully began to swim with Dean trailing behind. Charlie reached the other side first, just as the first of the hounds broke through the trees.
“Well,” Gabe said reluctantly, “skiing is my favorite form of skiing.”
“45, 44, 43,”  the timer counted down. Dean looked around him at the things from the cornucopia. About two meters from him was a pack of matches, no doubt useful. One meter down from that was a waterbottle and no more than a half away was a backpack. Dean saw a glint in the grass, which he hoped to go was a knife, about thirteen feet away. Now he had a goal.
“Um-”
The next morning he was at his locker, putting his books away when he saw Dean walking down the hallway. Castiel’s heart thumped in his chest so loud he could hear it echo in his ears. Castiel ducked his head into his locker and started arranging his books into a pile.
It was only three seconds in that claustrophobic tube and it felt like one second. Yeah, three seconds were feeling fast. That must be so surprising, huh?
“Good thing you asked Charles,” he ignored her glare, “because I am going to tell you. Pretty much we will be playing three two player mini games as teams. The team that wins the most rounds with get a star on their tally.” He pulled out a wooden board with four slots. Each one had a picture of somebody's face. “So yeah Chuck played another God of all things computer and found us three games to play.”
“She told me that she was going to flip them off and braid her hair,” Jo explained for Pamela. Dean laughed, Pam was awesome.
Instead, he turned to Sam, “I’m assuming that is not your brother under the bed?” Castiel whispered.
“Pay attention, you know what Ms. Harvelle did last time we didn’t. I couldn’t get the smell of tuna off my hands for weeks.”
“Fake boyfriend tax. I keep you safe from Anna, you give me chips.”
The amount of time it took for him to put two and two together was a single second and in that single second he heard the strangest shout.
By time what Cas said registered in his mind Jo had his arms behind his back and Cas had his legs wrapped around his body and pinned. Charlie unzipped his jacket and pushed up his shirt. He fought to get his arms free as Jo gasped in surprise. “Dean, why in all hell did you let it get that bad.”
“Dammit guys, how do we keep losing him?” Lucifer asked.
“Should I tell them I’m taken?” Dean teased as he opened the door to get out.
“Well, you better not get expelled on your first-day kid,” Jody joked in a tone that was not at all joking. Gabe laughed at that but she gave him a stink eye and he closed his mouth quickly.
“Oh yeah. Whatever, the point is, I had sex on the ski trip.”
Castiel shivered as a cold breeze blew through, “since when are they friends?”
Charlie was next to Castiel and Lucifer, only three down from Jo. Kevin was next to Lilith, from district two, and Hannah. Now that he had them all in his sights he felt more at ease. The plan was for Charlie to run right to a place where she was hidden from everyone but could still see, which would be easy seeing as they were in a freaking rain forest, and watch for Jo, Kevin, and Dean as they returned from the cornucopia with supplies. Charlie admitted reluctantly that she would probably freeze as soon as they said “go” so any advantage from being the fastest would be lost from a late start.
“Okay, great.” Castiel went to stand up.
“Will you wear one too?” Castiel asked.
Hello y'all! Had a touch of writers block and I'm busy with college. The next chapter will come out Monday! Please give me feedback on how I've done so far and anything you might wanna see. I hope y'all keep getting enjoyment out of this little fic!
Michael smiled with superiority, “yes really.”
“I agreed to go on a ski trip just because I hear you were going!” Jo shouted at her in frustration. Charlie and Jo stared each other down, Charlie was gaping like a fish.
“Duh,” Dean rolled his eyes “first rule of fight club.” He fished around the bag of chips and shook the last of the crumbs into his mouth. “Man I love Doritos.”
School on friday was rich with teachers having nervous breakdowns. ‘Rich’ meant two teachers. Two teachers mean Mr. Novak and Ms. Harvelle. By ‘nervous breakdowns’ that meant two different things for each of them.
“He proposed?”
“Jerk.”
Castiel shook his head, “no, you do not get to know that.”
Dean thought back to the room. When he had walking in all the female gamemakers had been buzzing estatically. One of them had actually demanded the removal of his clothing. What he had done involved the paint though, those classes with Castiel seemed to pay off. He got five dummies, one for each career except Cas, and painted the faces of those careers. Then he got to work with he sword, slicing and dicing them to pieces. The gamemakers were silent as he left the room.
“I believe you,” Castiel reassured him. Dean smiled at that and began to mix together the brownies then pour the first batch into a pan. He then mixed the rest and poured them into separate pans he put in the oven.
District 2 - Lucifer - 10, Lilith - 8
"Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck… Dean…!" Castiel's balls tightened as he came.
“I saw that. You two practically had a conversation. I thought you two were still pretending the other didn’t exist.”
“Damn, Cas, you're a player.” Dean grinned, looking almost impressed. “Who else did you write letters to?”
Well Charlie was just full of surprises today. First with the ball fondling, then talking about Castiel. Now she seemed to believe she was psychic. “Yeah right,”
“No,” Castiel insisted.
“Also I want pictures of you for the first day of school tomorrow,” Jody warned him.
“Jerk.”
"Yeah Charlie," he replied to her distantly before focusing. He looked at Kevin. "Only if you two promise not to get yourself killed also. Okay?"
Ruby laughed, “you’re a cute kid. Old Luke here has been around for a couple of months. He's about six years old so he’s having a hard time getting adopted. That, and he’s missing a leg and is super aloof when it comes to most people. Seems like he likes you though.”
They would have their lows too. When Luke dies during Castiel's first week of med school. When Sam goes all the way to Stanford for law school and Dean misses him. There would be arguments over stupid things that would lead to both him and Dean needing a moment to cool off before talking to each other again. But in the end, they always would come back together, because something as stupid as whether and orca or a polar bear would win a fight was not enough to keep them apart.
“No really,” she protested, “I do seriously.”
Castiel’s heart felt like it was going to beat out of his chest. He was silent for a moment, debating what to do and trying to calm himself. He felt the walls he had slammed all those months ago crumbling, leaving himself vulnerable to the full force of his feelings for the man in front of him.
Jo noticed as well, “what is up with the wings?” She whispered non-discreetly.
Castiel had told him about his home life, not just the nature part. He had a brother and sister, Ambriel and Balthazar. Ambriel was younger but more mature than Balthazar who spent his days trying to become a stand-up comedian and claiming a fear of boats so he wouldn't have to fish. His sister Ambriel had an undertaker service, keeping track of the dead. Castiel was the only person who actually did any fishing in his family. He had actually taught Dean how to make a fishhook out of virtually anything.
Castiel and Charlie winced simultaneously. Jo hated being called “Joanna.” She always had. She started going by Jo as soon as she possibly could, and the only person who was still allowed to call her that was her mother Jo’s face darkened.
“Fine, but since you know how to bake, you are showing me how to make brownies.”
"We woke up like thirty minutes ago. We wanted to make a meal for you and Charlie as thanks for yesterday." Cas grabbed his bow and notched an arrow. He pointed it at the nearest hound and after a twang it was dead. "We grabbed all the gear by the way."
“Why would I be mad?” Then it was back to quiet again. The staring contest resumed.
“Since I unfortunately have no girlfriend to do the girlfriend tag with I had to settle for my boyfriend Cas,” sighed Dean dramatically. He looked past the camera and laugh, “you know that I am joking Cas lighten up,”
Castiel hums in agreement, “Victor said he would be out all night you know. I got the room to myself.” Dean pulled away and looked Castiel in the eyes. The hunger that was there nearly knocked Castiel off his feet.
"I write romance novels," Castiel blurted out.
Castiel gasped in surprise. The single finger hadn’t hurt, but there were two fingers. Dean had thick fingers, thick hands. This would probably hurt. Castiel braced himself.
_--_+_--_
"Mm-hmm." Castiel pulled Dean in for a filthy kiss. Dean immediately cupped his neck with his other hand. Castiel let out all his breath and relaxed as Dean began to push. then retreats, then push again.
Castiel clapped his hands together, "well, let us get in the trees my friend." He held out his elbow and Charlie wrapped hers around it. They walked away and not long after there was some rustling in the trees.
“Did you get any more work done for your portfolio?” Castiel inquired as he played with a pile of chalkdust on a table.
When they arrived at Calculus, Dean pulled Cas into a hug. “Sorry I couldn’t drive you today, practice ya know?”
Castiel turned to Jody, “you finally got Donna to agree to a date?” Jody blushed, the sight was very strange to Castiel, considering Jody was the perpetually ‘nice but very strict aunt.’ He smiled at her, “that is great Aunt Jody! You shouldn’t have canceled.”
And Castiel felt so good, thrumming and sated.
"God, that's the hottest thing I've ever seen," Castiel told him.
“Hey Cas,” Dean said. He sounded confident but Castiel could hear how nervous he was.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said cheerfully as he slid into the booth across from Castiel.
“Fantastic,” Dean pulled into his driveway. “Now come on Angel, let’s go bake some pie.” Castiel helped him carry in all the ingredients to the house.
“Don’t try to pull that card on me Ms. ‘I got a nine,’” he teased.
“Damn Harvelle,” Charlie whistled appreciatively. “You made me look
The peace was interrupted by a certain blonde that wasn't Jo.
“Yes I will be okay, and you know why I want to move. The legal drinking age in Scotland is 18 and I very much plan to experience that.”
Very quickly, Castiel’s brain started to yell at him about how Dean was going to regret this. How Dean was going to turn around and say he wasn’t gay and walk out. Or worse, how Dean was going to turn around and decide that he maybe he was gay, he just didn’t want anything to do with Castiel anymore.
"Joanna Harvelle if we get killed because you can't stand to leave Kevin do you think he would forgive you?"
.” Castiel did have to admit that even though the meaning was dark it was still a gorgeous painting.
"It looks like some type of amulet thingy."
After five minutes of just standing there, trying to decide what to say, he finally just decided to wing it and raised his fist to knock. As he raised his hand though, the door swung open.
“Well, no…” Jo trailed off. She sighed and put it down in front of him, “well you’ll see.”
Charlie's entire face dropped and so did the bow. "Kevin?" She ran over to her friend. Dean walked away, to Gadreel.
“Oh my god that’s awesome,” she fidgeted excitedly, “can you sign my book?” She pulled out a worn copy of ‘The Babysitter’ and passed it over to him. “It would be the awesomest thing ever.” Castiel smiled awkwardly and wrote his name in sloppy cursive inside the cover. He handed it back and she took it with a squeal, running off to show her friends.
3.) Double Feature: Fight club and Harry Potter
“Your brother should be leaving work soon right?” Castiel took a sip and coughed. It tasted like a flavored hand sanitizer, burning as it went down his throat.
“And I have told you countless times that I don’t care. Now will you get my ambrosia or not?” She sighed and rolled her eyes but still walked to go grab his cinnamon. He let out a smile and pulled out the popcorn machine to start the batch of popcorn.
“Uh no.” Charlie smiled at that.
“So is this you knowing or is this you making a logical guess?”
“Mr. Novak gave everyone ten bonus points on our test. The only time in his history of his teaching career he has?”
Michael rolled his eyes and pulled out his sword. He lunged at Gordon but the other man pulled out his knife. He threw it in the direction of Lilith and Dean saw a red line on her face appear where the knife skimmed it. She choked in surprise and held up her hand to the cut. It was hardly a scratch and certainly not lethal but she still got pissed. Rather than letting Michael finish his task she ran him through with her own knife.
“Oh good,” Jo smiled in relief, “I didn’t want to send it in unless you were cool with it, since it is you after all. I was going to paint your brothers as Michael and Lucifer next. Kind of makes them two people on either side of a protest arguing at each other. Make sure then look sad and angry at the same time ya know?”
“Obviously because it was more fun that way.” She slung her arm around Castiel’s shoulder. “It’s going to be an interesting weekend, Novak.”
“Hey Jesse let’s go to my house instead.”
“Assbutt,” Castiel punched Dean’s arm. He chose not to bring up to little notes he had just read. Instead, he pulled Dean down into another kiss. This one went uninterrupted as they made their way to Dean’s room.
Jo ambled over to him and pushed Castiel away. In one quick movement she untied the vines and peeled away the moss. “I can’t see very well, Dean take off your jacket, and shirt.”
"What's that?" Castiel rumbled.
Dean grinned, “you like that?” At that he thrusted a little faster, still not pushing any deeper.
The boy holding him ran away from the wall of hounds, all fighting for a piece of the blonde girl. Dean could see Charlie running side by side with him. After what seemed to be a moment the hounds disappeared from view and water began splashing at his back. They were at the river.
“Yeah, well I wasn’t expecting you to show up on my doorstep out of nowhere like this. You surprised me Cas.”
"Where did your other arrow go?"
“Which was technically last year.” Jesse just smiled in defeat while she grinned widely. “But did he really upload?”
“What?”
A couple of minutes later, Charlie and Castiel were sitting on his bed in his room. Charlie had stopped to get them hot chocolate and some gummy bears from the lodge’s convenience store. He managed to get through half his bag of gummy bears before Charlie’s patience ran out.
“I have an idea,” Crowley stated, “district twelve is coal and coal keeps our fires burning like the fires of hell. Why don’t you make him look like he went through hell?”
“Look, this is the end of the month, you can talk to Bella. How about you stop ignoring her and finally get what you wanted so I can be done with this.”
“Deal,” Dean smiled. Castiel took another bite.
"Grab Kevin!" Jo shouted and she ran over to the injured boy. Charlie still had her bow pointed at Gadreel to cover their escape. Dean ran to Kevin, and stopped in his tracks.
“Of course. Just Jesse, do me a favor? Don’t ask Dean Winchester about his car. He will never shut up.” The bell rang and Mr. Novak grabbed their papers. Opening his mouth he shouted, “class dismissed!”
“Yeah babe?” Dean asked sleepily. He turned around to face Cas.
If she hadn’t put him on edge before, he definitely was now. “Why would you try to help somebody if they are supposedly looking to kill you? Someone, who you also coincidently want to kill?”
Dean beamed, “Bella doesn’t think so. Make sure you talk about how nice my car is when she is around. Maybe it will make her even more jealous.”
“You have an awfully high opinion of yourself,” Castiel teased.
“Yeah sure. Grab the cinnamon while you are at it.”
But Dean just grins at him, that full-force smile that makes Castiel's knees sweat. He said, "Not nearly." And then he kissed Castiel again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Try me.”
Castiel ripped the letter from his hand, “shut up.” He ran upstairs and looked at the letter. Thankfully the letter had a “return to sender” stamp on it, which meant that Crowley had never opened it. Castiel was momentarily grateful that his ten-year-old self had addressed the letter to the camp instead of Crowley’s home address.
“She's... She's gay.” Dean insisted.
_-_-+-_-_
Then, one day Dean would write Castiel a love letter. A full one, not just a little note every single day. Only the letter would be read out loud in front of their friends and family and accompanied by rings at the same place Dean’s parents got married. Things would be perfect.
“Ex-girlfriends.”
He stared down the door, getting up the nerve to knock. Gabe had dropped him off and drove away with the promise to come back in half an hour. “Unless you tell me otherwise,” he had added with a suggestive wink. Castiel had just glared him down while he drove away.
“Hey,” Dean murmured. Castiel relaxed.
Gordon and the two in the tree stared at him incredulously but then Gordon smiled. “I guess you really are a little angel, too pure too kill.” He grabbed the knife awkwardly and slit his own throat. A cannon boomed and Castiel reached forward to close his eyes.
“I think if you ask Gabe to pose he would try and show up naked,” Castiel warned her, but Jo was starting to ramble about her ideas and she even said something about demons and hellhounds and he lost focus.
“Are you two together too?” He asked Jo.
“I’m a sprinter, I hate this distance crap.”
"Well my dear Lilith," flashed a wicked grin, "I would call this a pleasant surprise except, oh yeah, I don't like you."
“I gotta go see Jo anyways.” Castiel lied as he waved him off. Then he whispered in a voice low enough for Dean to hear him, “go get her.” He turned around and walked away, fighting back the tears in his eyes and swallowing the pain in his heart.
plans to be here tonight. My mom canceled a date with the hot sheriff from two towns over because she felt bad about leaving you here alone. And well, you're 18 and a senior in high school, and I don't think you had anything else going on, am I right?”
“I went out and got them last night specifically for the bus ride,” Dean smiled at Castiel’s enthusiasm. “For you and me.”
Sam came over nearly every day to see Gabriel. He had introduced himself to Jody and she loved him like a second son immediately. Castiel was glad to see Sam but still tried to avoid him. He couldn’t look at him without thinking about Dean, it just made him hurt more.
Castiel tried not to let it damage his ego that all the other kids were on the black diamond slopes and he was on the green circle, aka
“What do you think Michael is doing tonight?” Jody wondered out loud while she discarded.
Castiel walked away from Dean, feeling his face burning as he made his way to his next class.
“How did you manage this?” Castiel hissed to Gabriel while Alfie played with a tiny corgi.
She glared at him, “Heaven forbid I wanted to see you Dean you dumbass,” then she added as an afterthought, “also Ash is visiting her.”
“I’m not moping,” Castiel argued in defense.
Dean let out a laugh, “just imagine him trying to reach the pedals.”
“I know that you kids are having sex and I don’t want any STDs or unexpected teenage moms.” Jody didn’t even bat an eyelash, she had zero embarrassment or shame over the topic. “Now do I need to teach you how to use those or are you good.”
“What have I gotten myself into boy?” Castiel asked him while he scratched Luke behind his ears.
Dean looked down at Kevin pants and saw the torn fabric. “Are you comfortable taking your pants off? I don’t want to rip them but I do need to see it.”
“I know, didn’t you make your AP Biology professor cry because he messed up describing some process?”
"What is your job back at district four?"
She reached over to grab a can of ginger ale, “how so?”
“Well then let me pay the rest.”
“I think you’re hot,” Lee said seriously. He started giggling like he had just said the funniest thing on the planet. Castiel just watched in amusement as Lee had to brace himself on the counter he was laughing so hard. “Dean Winchester’s hot boyfriend at my stupid party.”
Dean seemed to become aware of just how close they were at the same time Castiel came to the realization that he wanted to kiss him. Castiel watched as those beautiful green eyes flicked down to Castiel’s own lips and back up. It was so brief, but the way Dean’s pupils and where their chests were pressed against each other, Castiel could feel Dean’s heart rate pick up.
Gabe looked annoyed as he held his skis. “You got lucky sasquatch.”
Automatically Alfie replied, “I can if you give me a new Xbox.”
Dean’s felt his eyes watering and he felt happy. So, so happy. But Castiel wasn’t finished just yet.
“Come on,” Dean complained, “you gotta tell me who this mystery stud is, otherwise I'm gonna go on believing you have a secret tattoo with my face on.”
Bella folded her arms, “Joanna didn’t sign up for the ski trip, so I’m sorry, but she can’t come.”
“Don't you find it kinda depressing that it's Saturday night, and you're playing cards with your aunt and little cousin?
"Then I will come with you." Cas looked excited as he dragged Dean over to the station.
"This is most certainly the most dumbassed thing he has ever thought of," Dean muttered to himself. He steeled his nerves and walked out with the most sarcastic grin he could muster.
"You horrible, murderous, incorrigible assbutt!" Each word was punctuated by a punch, except the last on. That was punctuated by a kick to the gut.
The kiss was pure and sweet, none of the usual heat behind their kiss. It felt soft, comfortable, like coming home. Dean instantly wrapped his arms around Castiel’s waist and pulled him flush against his body as he returned the kiss with enthusiasm.
Dean stabbed a piece of the pie and held it up to Castiel’s mouth in offering, “open up.” Cautiously, Castiel wrapped his mouth around the fork.
loved
That is what snapped what little self control he had.
“It was my father’s.”
“You’re doing great angel,” Dean moaned out. Castiel smiled and gave his dick a few more tugs, feeling it pulse in his hand. He looked as precum dripping out of this tip. Then, he had an amazing idea.
“It’s on sale,” Castiel said defensively.
“Oh, right.”
“You guys talking to old Luke?” A friendly girl at the shelter walked up to them. “Hi my names Ruby, I work here.”
“Nice try, now get out before I make you take the pop quiz.” Jo and the rest of the class grumbled.
“Thank you Jody, he seems like a good companion. I really appreciate you helping me get him.”
After dinner, Jo went back to the slopes to snowboard. She said she was surprisingly addicted to the rush. Castiel was heading back to the room when he ran into Peter again, this time in swimming trunks and a hoodie. He was with Victor and Benny. They had towels around their necks.
“That doesn’t mean anything,” Castiel rationalized, “he’s probably upset because Bella dumped him again.”
Charlie smiled victoriously, “so one can’t do the girlfriend tag without a girlfriend right?” Dean nodded his head sagely and she slapped him.
Dean slowed at the sound of his name.
Dean pulled Castiel down and kissed his cheek, “see you later babe.”
Sam made a surprised sound, "I meant how he thinks we hate him."
“You might as well go first. We both know you were planning to anyways.”
“What are you doing here?” Castiel hissed. “I thought we weren’t hanging out tonight.”
"Thank you Dean." Castiel sounded really happy.
“Hear that Castiel, ‘awesomest thing ever.’ You’re a celebrity.” Castiel turned to see Jo walking towards him, looking amused.
Charlie grinned, "you are speaking to the most skilled person when it comes to foraging for food." She jumped up and rubbed her hands together. "Shall we?"
“Gordon? I thought you knew. By the way Lilith, shoddy work on that one. Making Castiel clean up your dirty work.” He tutted his tongue, “was it a little too much for you to handle?”
Mr. Novak was having a nervous breakdown that wasn’t as surprising. The was a couple of clues.
Sam glared at him again, “I hate pie.”
“Well, if you were dating somebody, then maybe you wouldn't have to drive at all 'cause they would take us places. Less needing to worry about running over a poor guy just walking to practice.”
“Oh I do, but if we are gonna fake contract then you have to fake sign it. I don't want any takebacks on your part later on.” Castiel rolled his eyes but signed the paper. Dean grabbed it from him and signed underneath his name.
“Sixth grade and senior year can hardly believe it.” Jody took one more picture of the three of them and smiled wide.
“Nah, this could be fun. Never had a fake relationship contract.”
“Let me ask again, what are you doing here? How did you get past Ellen?”
“Yes,” Castiel assured him. He had also found out that Sam was walking home the days that Dean had practice so volunteered to drive him instead. He pitied Alfie the days that Gabe and Sam were alone in the car together.
“Exactly Charlie, what the hell? I thought you were a lesbian,” he looked down to see his water bottle nustled where Charlie had been reaching and felt a blush coming on. “Oh.”
“What’s up with you and Winchester by the way?”
“Well, maybe one glass wouldn’t hurt. I’ve always wondered what it was like.”
“He’s in the hot tub, said he wanted to be alone for the rest of the night.”
“Hey, Winchester, I heard Bella dumped you for a college student, that true?” Jo smiled wickedly at Dean.
Castiel sighed and followed after his fake boyfriend. Dean was humming some song under his breath as he kept pushing the cart. He stopped by the freezer aisle and gave Castiel a sideways glance.
Castiel looked up at Dean in surprise. “What?”
Dean had basically just told him that the reasons he originally had to end things were made up by a crazy ex-girlfriend. Now Castiel knew that part of the problem was his impatience and not letting Dean explain himself. Dean had never cheated and he had not gotten back together with Bella.
“That's what I'm afraid of.”
ago. I was really upset and bored at the dance and you kept me company. Thanks to you I felt a lot better. But I do not have a crush, in fact, I doubt I ever did.”
“Me and my perky nipples,” he smiled cheekily.
From behind the locker door, Dean speaks up, “Hey.”
"Are you playing dumb Winchester?" Charlie asked between giggles.
Castiel’s alarm blaring woke him up in a shock. He groaned and buried his face in his pillow, trying to forget the dream. Everything within him screamed that it was a sign: dating Dean Winchester would solve his Anna problem.
Castiel couldn’t fight the small smile across his face. “Depends.”
Dean felt himself breath as memories of Castiel enthusing over those dumb flowers with an equally dumb expression on his face. He felt himself blush but kept his knife out in defense. “Maybe ‘cause we are in and arena in a fight to the death?”
They were sitting on the couch, Dean in their lap comfortably with some scene from star trek playing on the television. He turned his head to see Cas’ blue eyes looking up at him questioningly. Dean reached up a hand and pulled Cas’ face towards his own in a slow kiss.
be more important than going up to your room and continuing this,” Castiel growled. He made another pass to pull Dean into a kiss which was momentarily successful. Castiel was surprised at his own impatience, but after spending so much time away from Dean because of Castiel’s own stupid misunderstanding he found that he just wanted to be as close to Dean as possible.
"POUGHKEEPSIE!"
"Huh what?"
"Eight. I have used three on these dumbass hounds. Twelve to start with."
She clucked in disappointment, "oh Dean, I thought we were past such rude greetings."
"You let it get infected. Do you really want to die from infection or give the Capitol a problem with it if you win?"
Dean yanked out his knife and held it in front of his face. “What the hell do you want?”
"Me?" Cas asked in surprise.
The other man kissed him sweetly and held Dean closer to him. “You do know, heaven or hell, I will stand by you right?”
“Well, you wanna adopt him?” Ruby smiled as she asked. Castiel looked down at Luke again and gave him forehead a quick scratch. The dog looked up at him with sleepy happy eyes and jumped up to lick his face, accidentally unbalancing himself in his excitement. Castiel sat down and let the dog wiggle into his lap and lay down, letting out a noise of surprise at how heavy it was.
"Oh god yes."
“Bitch.”
“My cousin asked me to make him something for the first of October bake sale tomorrow, and this is what I can do on short notice.
Castiel stood there and waited for her to come back to the window, but she didn't. She came outside the front door instead. She’s wearing a hoodie and sweatpants. It’s Michael’s favorite hoodie. When they first got together, she used to wear it all the time, like it was a letterman’s jacket or something. Castiel didn’t know that Anna never gave it back.
A sad smile, “okay, come on.” He sat down on the bed and pulled him down. “What is the first part?”
Jo rolled her eyes, “whatever. Just promise to never make me read another one.”
“Yeah, the vid is called multi-” he couldn’t finish his sentence before he was interrupted.
“Carry on my wayward sooooonn,” the television demanded their attention. There was a video of a person in a car. “There will be peace when you are done,” the man started up the car. “Lay your weary head to resssstt,” he started driving. “Don't you cry to more,” a video of the back of the car driving away into a sunset. “No!” The screen went black.
Jo went off to snowboard with Charlie. She invited him to come along, but Castiel said no thanks. Castiel was still slightly traumatized from his last experience skiing with Michael.
Christmas vacation came and went. He heard back from Duke University and sent his own acceptance almost immediately. In all the drama with the ski trip, Castiel hadn’t noticed the acceptance letter sitting in his email but it had been a nice surprise. Aunt Jody had taken them all to the Roadhouse to celebrate.
Dean sensed his nervousness and pulled his lips away, resting their foreheads together.
“Easy there tiger, the video isn’t going anywhere now,” he laughed as her hand dug into his wrist.
“That just made it even better.” Castiel sat for a minute, trying to comprehend his apparent fame. Dean started the car and began driving. He cleared his throat, “so why did you ask me for a ride? I know you hate driving and all, but you are still capable.”
Charlie’s eyes filled up with a profound grief, “I don’t think so. I would hate for my queen to think wrong of me before I died.” Dean stared at her sympathetically but she didn’t seem to notice, off in her own little world. He opened his mouth to tell her not think like that before he heard a young boy screaming.
"Our place. Now what are they?"
“This is not over,” she hissed at him.
He did not.
“Hello once again audience,” started Dean after his intro.
“Dean,” shouted Charlie as she jumped him. Together they went crashing down to the ground.
“Exactly.”
Realizing what Dean was so interested in, Castiel gave him what he hoped looked like a seductive smile. He reached down, playing with the edge of the shirt. Dean watched, utterly entranced.
Dean laughed at him, “you sound like a robot in a dating simulation.”
“You are just jealous,” she teased.
“Well great, cause Bella was asking for you.” Castiel felt his heart drop in his chest at the reminder. The reminder that what Dean and he had was fake. Castiel ducked his head and he pulled his hand away from Dean.
“Or maybe,” Castiel croaked out, “maybe you could fuck
"Yes!" Shouted Jo and Charlie unanimously.
“Well with his age we usually charge 100 but since he is missing 25% I will give you 25% off.” She smiled and laughed at her joke. Jody just stared her down with her ‘I am not amused and what you said was rude and you should apologize to that dog right now’ face. Ruby swallowed uncomfortably, “sorry Luke.”
“Hey,” whispered Jesse, “couple weeks ago was awesome for us too.”
All the people before Dean seemed to have a personality. Michael was cocky. Lucifer was sly. Charlie was cheerful. Kevin was witty. Hannah was frigid. Castiel was stoic. Gordon was angry. Anna was shy. Gabriel had the whole audience laughing in minutes. Jo charming and flirty. When Dean went on he almost forgot everything Bobby told him.
Castiel stared at him wide-eyed as Dean rambled, rooted to his spot as he listened.
“Yeah no, you’re fine,” Castiel assured him. Since baseball had gotten into full swing, Dean had been unable to drive them a lot. Practice before school started on Mondays and after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Castiel ended up staying for Dean's games on Wednesdays, per the contract, so Gabe had taken to driving Alfie home on those days.
The girl holding the remote flashed a glare, “It's loading dumbass. Give me a break. Then she added as an afterthought, “also don't eat all the popcorn. He just stuck his tongue out and threw a piece at her.
“I’m officially home base,” she says, wiping the corners of her mouth. “Mr. Turner’s on slope duty. Besides, I’m much too old to get myself hurt doing something silly like skiing” She took a bite of soup. “What about you, Castiel? Are you avoiding your very sweet boyfriend?”
“Well well well,” Gabe smiled, “Cassid talking to a freshman he doesn’t know. I can’t believe you  are scoring with the jailbait.”
Dean could distantly hear Cas calling his name but all he could hear were the hounds, Jo’s scream. He could only see her peaceful smile, not even afraid of death.
Charlie and Jo started cackling like birds and Dean felt his face flush red. He opened his mouth to answer.
Sam flushed bright red, “please don’t tell Dean. He’ll never stop harassing me for having sex on the ski trip.”
“Ouch Dean, what the hell?” Jo demanded but he ignored her, staring straight forward.
Cas ignored his question. “It that it?” He was gesturing to the dagger at his belt.
“Hey, Castiel,” Benny drawled in his creole accent. “Where you disappear to all day?”
“Oh no,” Lilith snickered, “wrong boy. Castiel is the one with a stick up his ass. Michael is just boring.”
“Why would you want that?” Castiel asked with a dry mouth.
“This isn’t a date, this is you avoiding responsibilities,” Castiel reminded him.
"Of course!"
Dean saw the skepticism on his face. “If you don’t want to snowboard,” he continued, “the lodge has a big stone fireplace and big comfy chairs. You can sit and read for hours. And they sell the best hot chocolate. I’ll buy you one.” He squeezed Castiel’s hand excitedly.
Bobby seemed to think it over, “deal.” He passed the salad with a fork and went over to the television. “Play reaping.”
Castiel just stared at the beautiful rendition of Dean, feeling the familiar weight that had been in his chest since he and Dean had broken up. He turned to face Jo.
“It is to reflect the situation that our protagonist are in. For example, the song of family is playing towards the beginning because they were all happy together,” rumbled a gravelly tone, “so Krissy was correct.”
Dean frowned. “Why are you always bringing up Bella? I’m trying to talk about us, and all you want to do is talk about her. Yeah, Bella and I have history. I’m always going to care about her.” He shrugged awkwardly. “But now . . . I like you.” Dean looked up at Castiel. “So what do you say?”
Dean growled and shoved his cock up Castiel's ass until they were pressed tight together, until Castiel was once again gasping, his ass stretched wide around the girth of Dean's thick cock. Until Dean was moving again, rutting, and he was panting against Castiel's neck.
“What would that be?” Castiel replied absentmindedly. He grabbed his cards from Jody and began to organize himself. She had dealt him three aces to begin which was
“You do know that Gabriel is also an angel right? He was god’s messenger?”
District four had a boy with dark hair and blue eyes that seemed to watch Dean through the screen. He didn’t seem as excited as the other careers were for the game. He seemed calm, though, sure of himself.
“Yeah,” breathed Jesse. They turned their attention back to the video playing.
“We are going to watch a YouTube video with popcorn and soda as if it is a movie.”
Dean lowered his knife, “yeah thanks for the tree thing man. I really appreciate it.”
Alfie shrugged, “the truth hurts, Castiel.” Castiel looked down at his cards and tried not to feel bad about ruining the night for his family. He took his turn.
Cas reached his hand behind Dean and pulled his water bottle to view. He poured a little over his hands and rubbed them together. Dean sighed, "come on man. It isn't even that bad. Just pour some water and cover it up."
“Is she out there?”
“Three weeks.”
"I got you something." He pulled out Kevin's token and held it out for her to grab. She smiled weakly and started a fresh wave of tears. Dean felt for his pocket and took out the string Castiel insisted he had to 'fix his stitches if they broke and don't you dare let yourself bleed to death Winchester.' He pull out his knife and carved a small hole in the wood which he threaded with the string. He cut off the thread once it was long enough and tied it off. Bam, a necklace.
"You are a hero Dean. But that will be your undoing." Cas's hand still clasped Dean's. He yanked his hands out of the others boy's grasp and turned his head.
“What can I get for you, honey?”
Jo frowned, “well now I am definitely going on the trip. You two will be so horny that leaving yourselves to your own devices would probably be considered a war crime.”
Worried, Castiel whispered, “You didn’t bring any alcohol, did you? They’re checking bags.”
Now that Castiel’s friends were all dating each other and he was sans Dean, something which sent another round of pain and heartbreak through him every time he thought about it, he had a lot of free time to himself. After he was ahead of his work as humanly possible, he started writing another book. Just one of his passion projects, nothing he ever planned on publishing.
“Semantics,” Dean threw a chip into his mouth. He reached in his bag and pulled out a packet of gummy bears, "want these as a trade."
“Uh,” Dean scratched the back of his head, “you fainted?” Oh... Okay. “Here, give me your hand.” Dean grabbed Castiel's right hand with his own, “And the other one, too.” Castiel grudgingly offered his other hand and let himself be pulled to an upward sitting position. “Come on, you got this. Here we go. And you're up.”
"Guys, stop." His voice was soft and small. So was Kevin's grateful smile.
"Yeah remember how I thought she was flirting to get in good with her?"
Dean rolled his eyes, of course, Sam would be dramatic. “Sam, you are fourteen years old. Even if you survived the games you would be traumatized.”
“And I need to get away from here, small towns are black holes, and the further away I go to college the less chance I have to end up stuck there.”
“I could…” Dean blushed. “I could write you notes, every day.”
“Right. Ex-girlfriends.” A timer went off on the stove that Castiel hadn’t even seen him set. Dean left the scampi to simmer on the stove as he walked over to the fridge and pulled out the dough. He began to roll it out and shape it into a pie crust. They sat in comfortable silence as Dean worked.
Castiel expected Dean to tease him for being slow, but instead he started washing all of his dishes. “When you’re done with that let me know, I’m going to wash these and move on to the brownies.”
“And you shame me for my fanfiction writing.”
"Oh god…" Castiel's eyes rolled shut.
“Charlie you okay?” She nodded shaky and stared back over the river where the hounds had formerly stood.
Castiel looked up at him in surprise. “Why didn’t you-” he started. He trailed off his sentence, staring up at Castiel in surprise.
Castiel laughed at that, “Dean Winchester, I'm not trying to date you.”
“I don’t see how that’s my problem,” Castiel said stubbornly.
“You got rules?” Dean scoffed. “Come on, you really know how to zap the fun out of a situation.”
“I’m going to calculus, have a nice day Dean.” He turned and walked away while he still had the upper hand.
Cas returned after ten minutes and raised an eyebrow at Dean and Charlie. "What are you doing?"
“And, promise me you’ll go out on the slopes at least once,” Jody added.
“But-”
The girl had flaming red hair and a knowing smirk. Her brown eyes twinkled mischievously. She was sitting next the the man in the center. With his godlike jawline, blonde hair and emerald eyes he shouldn't be allowed to be the gorgeous.
That was true, he hadn’t. “You aren’t going to like it,” Castiel said wryly.
"Hm?" Cas had wandered over to the bags, probably to search for food. He didn't look up to answer Dean's call.
He heard the door open up, “Dean,” whispered a soft voice. Definitely not Sam. A soft hand touched his shoulder and he turned his head to see Ms. Harvelle.
“I’m making a contract to follow. If you don’t like it you can go.”
Dean laughed at that, “well if you are going as me can I wear the trenchcoat?”
In middle school, he and Dean had been best friends along with Bella and Anna. At Bella's birthday party in middle school, she had pulled Cas to the side.
“Yo, Milton, yeah?” He heard Dean shout through the window in his house. He walked up to listen to their conversation.
She ripped the canvas down to show a picture of Castiel, thankfully not naked. He had big black wings that looked like they had just been through a hurricane. His actual body was covered in a tattered white t-shirt and crouched holding a child in his arms who was wearing a cheap-looking crown. Tears were on the angel’s face as it stared down at the child.
“Ms. Harvelle, are you okay?” asked Jesse slowly.
“Hey Dean..” Castiel trailed off, unsure of how to word it.
“Well, I only made the rule because I’ve never kissed anybody, and I was nervous people would see how awkward I was and guess the relationship was fake.”
“Fair enough.”
“I’m just gonna get to homeroom, please don’t be late for yours,” Castiel reminded her. She just waved him off and continued to sketch. He smiled and walked out to find his homeroom.
“Oh, no. Don't push him. He's shy!” Bella gave him a look that anybody who hadn’t been her friend for most of the elementary school would think was friendly. But he knew it was a challenge.
Castiel knew exactly what was contained in that letter. He had written it after a middle school dance.
Surprisingly enough, Dean had kept the ‘no talking to Bella’ promise pretty well. When talking with Castiel in the hallway he would act like she didn’t exist as she passed by. It was very impressive. Strangely, Bella hadn’t tried to attack Castiel or make his life miserable, but he was preparing himself mentally just in case.
“Hello Dean,” Castiel was used to the stupid nickname by now so didn’t bother correcting him. “Hello Sam,” he smiled at Dean’s brother.
The peacekeeper opened up the door and showed him into the room, “your first visitor will be here in a minute.” Dean looked around the small room, taking in his surroundings. It was bare with bars on the windows. The only furniture was a long sofa with a cheap plastic chair across from it. He sat down.
Castiel’s rationalization just seemed to piss Dean off more. “You think I’m upset because people might think you were cheating on me?”
“Quick, Lucifer. I heard something,” Dean stared at the pointed finger and watched as other careers followed it.  “Quick, run. I’ll stay here and finish Gordon off,” Michael nodded and led the people away from the tree Dean and Charlie were in. Castiel stared at Gordon and handed him a knife, “your life is your own to finish. I just know that it will take only a little while and be very painful if you try to fight through it.”
“Pretty good ma’am. I think he got tonight off if you wanna call him,” Dean said in response.
“Impatient much?” Castiel teased him.
Dean stared at the hand, "look man. I know I probably seem all kind and cuddly to you but your fellow careers aren't. Talking to me is a big no-no if you want a chance to team with them at all."
“I’ll teach you. Come on, it’ll be fun.” Dean grabbed my hand and said, “Please please please, Cas? Come on, be a sport. It’ll be fun, I promise.”
“And each person will pick a straw. Whoever has the short straw plays with Dean.” Dean let out a choked noise.
A smooth voice replied, “reaping playing.” The screen lit up to show a black man reading out the names for district one. Dean ate two bites of the lettuce each time a name was called. A couple of people stood out to him.
It was a rundown bar that Castiel technically wasn’t supposed to be in, but that is why it was perfect. Most kids from school wouldn’t step through the door in fear of incurring Ellen’s wrath. Emphasis on
Castiel repressed a smile, “are you really gonna go?”
“Is that Ms. Harvelle?”
“Good,” Dean replied. He looked back at Castiel and Jo but Castiel ducked his head to avoid eye contact.
Castiel got bolder as he pulled up the top big shirt enough to show his boxers. He slowly began to slide them off, careful not to touch himself and come too early. Castiel threw the boxers to the side. Now he was only wearing the shirt.
“Where does ‘like a bitch’ go on the scale?”
“Besides, as I said before, I'm just here to take down one of those burgers.”
“Exactly, oh. Now can I drink some water or we planning on becoming damn vampires and drinking your blood?” He handed her the water bottle with his cheeks still burning.
“Hey Kali, mind scooching?”
“Why?” asked Dean, “It's my channel!”
_--_+_--_
“Well, what should I do with them then?” Castiel asked. “What do you prefer?”
Sam wasn’t there yet, much to Castiel’s surprise. Between his brother and the Winchester, Sam was definitely much more punctual.
Castiel’s eyes widened in surprise, “Dean, I am not getting drunk.”
“He had been running around non stop and refusing to sleep. He also doesn’t seem to have washed it.” Cas looked at Dean, “do you still have the knife?”
And then the great Dean Winchester, king of the school and resident fuck boy extraordinaire, blushed, unable to look at him, and buried his face in the crook of Castiel's neck to finish. Castiel cupped the back of his head. Before he could think, he kissed Dean's temple.
“You wanna hear something funny?” Castiel cocked his head.
“He’ll get bored, he likes sex and frankly it is obvious that you have been holding out on him.” Bella stood up, “and when he realizes that you are a sexless joke, I will be here waiting.” With that Bella walked away, leaving behind a pit of unease in Castiel’s stomach.
She smiled widely, “I’ll take that as a yes.” She crossed her legs, “you are doing that wrong you know.”
His nervous breakdown was subtle though. Krissy and Jesse had finished the day's worksheet and were walking up to the front of the room. They were talking about, you guessed it, Dean Winchester.
Kevin grinned, clearly happy to be of use. "Well, I might have something."
“I wrote five actually,” Castiel interrupted his sulking, “so don't go feeling too special. Also, not in love with you.”
“Nah it can’t be. She is smiling.”
Dean smiled, "a samulet." He looked up at his mentor and smiled, "good night Booby."
“You were drunk.”
“Dean ya idjit, it you don’t eat anything I will personally shove food down your throat. There is no point in starving yourself to death.” Dean glared at Bobby holding out a plate of salad for him to eat. When the old man had arrived on the train announcing that he was going to keep their asses alive. Also, he was going to kill them if they died in the games. Then he tried to make Dean eat vegetables
“I just told you.”
"I wasn't there, behind Gadreel. I said I would be there." Not what he was expecting.
“Well, if you’re drinking then you gotta sleep here. I am not bringing you home to Jody drunk. She’s the sheriff. She has a gun.”
“I’m surprised Sam wanted to come,” Castiel raised an eyebrow at Dean.
“Okay. Deal.”
“How romantic,” Castiel rolled his eyes. He could manage the notes if he knew they were for revenge.
Castiel had been thinking about her words while he was traveling with Michael to the airport. He has been so spaced that he didn’t really process when they had arrived.
He knew he needed an arrow to make a tourniquet for Kevin’s leg. The knife wound was bleeding heavily and the best way Dean knew to help with the blood flow was to use one. There were twelve arrows there still for some reason. Had Charlie somehow managed to retrieve an arrow from Michael’s hand under his nose? He shook away his thoughts and grabbed one at random.
