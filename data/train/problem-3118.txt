“What are you laughing at?” He asks. His face is serious, but his hair looks insane. Dean wants to respond he really does, but Cas just looks too damn stupid to be taken seriously and laughs louder while he pulls out his phone. It reminds him of all the times Sam had experimented with using a blow dryer. Cas keeps glaring even after Dean has snapped a photo.
"No, you're right. This is terrifying." Dean interjects and takes a few deep breaths. "I'm sorry. Things will calm down."
Saturday has Dean feeling better. He gets it now. It all makes sense now. He needs Cas. It’s not a question or a thought in the back of his mind anymore. He needs him always. Cas is important and when he’s without him it feels like fire in his lungs.
“What specifically do you do? I mean, when you aren’t downtown bothering me,” Dean laughs and Cas turns around so quickly Dean doesn’t have time to move out of the way. His face inches from Dean’s.
“No! You were gone, Cas. I was going to be okay without you. I was...I was going to move on and be okay without you. I thought you were dead! I thought you had just...I thought I couldn’t save you. I tried, Cas. I tried so hard and you just...you gave up? You let me kill him?”
Dean sighs and takes a look around the area, “I was in a similar position a few years ago. There weren’t many people who helped me and those who did weren’t what they seemed to be.”
“I know, but it’s not the same,” Sam pauses for a moment. “It’s like, he could live without talking to me everyday, but with you, it’s like he’s missing a whole part of himself.”
Dean folds the paper and holds it tightly in his hand. He grabs his shoes and shirt and runs barefoot back to his house and puts the note safely in his duffle bag and if he takes it out later that night and memorizes it that’s for him to know and for no one to ever find out.
“I don’t understand, Dean. One minute you want him here, then you tell him to leave, and now you can’t be here for him when he needs you the most? What the hell is going on? What is so bad that you can’t stick around for your best friend?” Sam stands, “I know you think I don’t know Dean, but I know. I can see it everyday. I’ve seen it every damn day. You walk around here with the weight of the world on your shoulders and you don’t have to carry it alone! You don’t have to do this alone!”
Dean presses on the gas. It’s six-thirty. Even if Sam wasn’t awake he might still make it on time. The bakery he’s delivering to today is only a few minutes from Sam’s school. He parks in his parking spot and rushes into the house. He can hear the shower running. He knocks on the door and opens it.
But maybe this was something different. Maybe this was more than just a love for a family member. He didn’t feel quite like this for Sam. It was the same but something was different. Maybe more intense? More personal? More romantic? No. That doesn’t feel right? Or does it?
Sorry that this isn't very long. I'm working on the last few chapters and wanted to give you something to look forward to. Thank you for reading!
“Yes,” Cas says quietly and quickly. “I don’t know what to do when you’re having a bad day. I don’t know what to say or do to help you through it and I don’t feel confident that I’m going to be enough for you to keep moving forward.”
“Cas...please don’t make me beg,” I catch his gaze in the mirror and it’s different again. It looks much like it used to, like back when I have first started working for him back when we were just friends and the sexual tension wasn’t so thick you could cut it with a knife. I had to admit things were much simpler then. I stare at him and his eyes drop to the floor. Maybe I should make him beg. In fact, that sounds like a great idea.
Dean counts seventeen people in the line. A couple of the people look pretty intense, but it seems like everyone has a sense of belonging and for a moment, Dean feels envious of them. He used to belong somewhere. He had a family like this once. People from broken homes and struggling to make life worth it. Just trying to make a little money by doing anything they could. He had done some pretty shitty things back then.
“Dude, I don’t have time to explain, but I need you to trust me. Okay? I need you to go. You need to get out of here. I don’t care where you go, but you have to go.” Dean hears a car door from outside and springs into action. He grabs his bag from near the couch and stuffs it with the few things sitting near him. Gabe is pushing him towards the back door when the front door opens.
I have never felt so much adrenaline in my life. I don’t know if it’s the drugs or just me. I reach my hand out and give him a few good strokes before I lean down and take him into my mouth. I start moving my fingers again and Cas is making the most beautiful noises. Noises I didn’t know he could make. I groan in response and his hand finds the back of my head and pushes my face down into his crotch. I want to gag, but I know if I do I’ll puke. I’ll ruin everything.
Dean's starting to realize that if he had simply done this a long time ago he wouldn’t have wasted so much time. It's his biggest regret. Wasting everyone’s time and energy. He now sees that just trying to get him through a single day was like running and marathon and he never really knew it.
After a few moments he knows he has to go back. He has to hold it together just a little longer. He can do that. Fake it until you make it. He walks around the room picking up his things and placing them in his duffle. He makes his way to the bathroom and plucks his things from the counters. He passes the mirror and something is wrong. He freezes and lets the things in his hands fall to the floor. There is another reflection and there is no mistaking who those blue eyes belong to.
Wednesday is warm and the stars shine brighter than Dean has ever seen. He’s on the ground wrapped in a blanket. Cas on one side and Sam on the other. Cas suggested going to the lake and watching the stars.
"Dean no one here thinks you aren't okay. We just...we worry. And I think considering what did happen, it's appropriate. I don't want you to feel like you have to hurry up and get better or something. Do this at your pace." Sam says. It's something that he's brought up before in past appointments. He's not wrong. Dean does tend to rush through things just to get it over with, but this isn't that this time.
“You don’t know?” The confusion is genuine and it makes Gabriel feel like he’s missing something important.
“Soon,” Cas replies and unlinks his fingers from Dean’s and stands. Dean stays where he is. He doesn’t like goodbyes. Never has. Cas leans down and places a kiss to Dean’s lips and walks to the door. He picks up his bag and Dean doesn’t have to see his face to know that Cas’s eyes are red rimmed. He knows Cas won’t cry until he’s on the road away from him. Dean closes his eyes so he doesn’t have to actually watch Cas walk out the door.
Thank you so much for reading and thank you for the support. I'm going back to posting once a week (on Wednesdays) but I decided that I would post today so you don't have to keep waiting. I also just want to remind everyone that this story does have a happy ending, but things are going to get a little rough in a few chapters. :)
I push him away from me and let my feet slide to the floor. I turn towards the mirror and attempt to fix my shirt and shove down my embarrassingly hard erection.
“I’m going to go see if I can figure out what the hell Crowley is up to. There’s a hotel that’s been losing a lot of it’s customers. Thought I’d check it out,” Dean notices Sam’s expression change from annoyance to concern but he doesn’t say anything, “Just keep working with Kevin and see what you can get from the tablet.”
Okay, that was unexpected. Although, it’s not exactly untrue. When Cas isn’t there he does feel off. He does feel like there is something missing.
Again, the time jumps are all over the place because I keep forgetting what timeline I'm in. So, if you can ignore that, this story will be over very soon! Thank you all for sticking with me. We're almost done!
I am looking for an artist to make some fan art for this story and I am also in need of a beta. If you are interested please message me on tumblr. :)
“A little excited?” Dean asks and promptly kisses his way up Cas’ body stopping quickly at each nipple. Cas’s hands find Dean’s hair and he pulls him up by the hair and crashes their mouths together. Dean’s nose is mostly healed but he knows his bruise is going to be back in the morning. Cas is pushing Dean up and back until they are both sitting up, Dean firmly in Cas’s lap. Their kiss is all tongue and teeth. Cas runs a hand down Dean’s side while the other gently grabs his erection between them and gives it a few quick pulls. Dean’s head rolls back as he lets out a moan and Cas’s mouth finds his throat.
They stare at each other until the timer in the kitchen goes off. Dean turns and leaves Cas sitting on the stairs. Seeing Dean should be making him happy. He should want to hug him and kiss him all over but all he feels is fear and uncertainty. What if this is one of the last times that he sees Dean and he’s not even allowed to touch him? What if Dean decides that Cas is better off without him and disappears?
“I’ll tell him you stopped by,” Garth says. The guy is like a hundred pounds and visibly shaking in fear.
“Are you going to see him again?” Charlie asks. His eyes open and he just looks at her. He doesn’t know. At this point, he doesn’t know. It feels weird now.
Purgatory was pure; uncomplicated. Kill or be killed. He had been able to tap into a part of himself that he didn’t know he had. A part of himself that he could have never been able to access outside of Purgatory. He had spent a year searching for Cas and killing things before they could kill him. Cas was the only thing to look forward to while he was there. His only reason for fighting and trying to find a way out. He didn’t need to talk about Purgatory because that meant talking about Cas and how much his feelings towards his friend had changed, and that was not something Dean wanted to do. Ever.
Day three Dean wakes up early with the intent to make Cas a giant breakfast. He walks out to the living room, but Cas isn’t on the couch. His bedding is folded in a neat pile and his shoes and backpack are gone.
Fuck it. I press myself against him again pushing him back into the wall near where we came in. I tangle my fingers in his hair and pull his head back into the wall with a quiet thump. My mouth finds his for a moment and then moves to his neck.
Thursday he dropped his tool box and dented the shit out of it. He still can’t find a few of the bolts he knows were there before.
Dean doesn’t speak. He doesn’t do anything. He just sits there and absorbs the story. He plays Cas’s words over and over in his head until he thinks he’s going to explode. Who would do this? Why would someone do this? He can’t look as Cas because all he will see are the yellowing bruises and cuts on his face. He’ll see the pain in Cas’s eyes. He might see that there is more to the story that he doesn’t want to know.
“I’m here,” Dean replies. He’s holding Cas’s hand. Eva is writing with a pencil. They had tried the pen thing a few times, but Dean’s not ready for that. He can handle a pencil.
Dean doesn’t answer. He knows Bobby will figure it out himself, but he doesn’t want to admit anything out loud.
“Yeah, she was. And I need Sammy. I just…” Dean stops talking and turns back to the stack of wet plates and starts drying again.
Dean lands with a heavy thud, missing a jagged tree stump by a few feet. Benny lands a few yards away groaning as he tries to sit up. Dean’s eyes scan Benny’s body to make sure he’s not hurt too bad before his gaze finds Cas who falls to the ground.
“Nothing,” Sam turns and heads upstairs and slams his bedroom door. More often than not he comes home to a situation between his father and brother and is always somehow caught in the middle.
“Dean?” Dean looks up and sees Cas looking at him from the kitchen with a concerned look on his face. “Are you going to answer it?”
He pushes on the door with his good hand and stands to wait for his brother. His legs are shaking and his mind is screaming at him to run. Get away! He doesn’t want to be locked up again. He doesn’t want to be strapped down to a bed and shot up with drugs that make his mind feel like he’s thinking in slow motion. But he has to. He has to get better.
“I’ll do it. But, I’ll kill you if I have to,” He says. He doesn’t know this vampire but he decides that finding Cas is more important than letting this vampire go. Everything inside Dean screams for him to run the other way but he needs to find Cas and if this vampire has any information, he needs to find out what it is.
“You know and you...what? Had a slumber party with yourself for a year? What the hell is wrong with you, Cas?”
“Cas, I- I’m sorry. I just, I don’t do this. People don’t- once they know. They leave. Or I leave. Once you know, this, whatever it is we have, will be gone.”
Friday sadness creeps in and makes Dean feel like he’s going to throw up whenever he thinks about Cas leaving the following day. He doesn’t want his friend to leave. He’s just starting to feel normal. He’s starting to feel like himself again.
“Well, now you know. You can go if you want.” Dean says. He doesn’t want to cry but his eyes are stinging.
“He just needs time, Dean,” Sam says. Dean lets some of the tension in his shoulders go. Even now, after years and years of being together Dean is still impressed when Sam knows what’s going though his mind by just body language alone. Something in Sam’s words pulls on Dean’s nerves and he finds himself to be more annoyed than anything. Why did he need to give Cas anything? He had thought he was dead for months and now he was just supposed to sit back and give him space?
“I already called 911, they should be here shortly. Keep him warm,” Dean’s dad says and helps the boy over to the other man who takes the boy into his arms and covers his face in kisses. It makes Dean angry and he’s not quite sure why.
With the thoughts of Purgatory starting to make a permanent home Dean’s mind the bunker becomes almost unbearable. The tension is so thick you can cut it with a knife.
“Not your fault.” The man says. His voice is quiet and raw. He must have been screaming for hours. Dean looks up at the guy and frowns. This isn’t a way to live. This could have been him if it weren’t for Gabe.
“I know you said you don’t want help and I know this is weird,” He gestures between the two of them. Dean’s had friendships before, but for some reason this feels different. “It’s just I’ve been alone for a long time and now I have a friend and I-I just want to help.”
Cas stays in his room for days. Sam and Dean both try to speak to him but he never responds and Sam feels they shouldn’t intrude on his personal time. No sounds or movements come from the room and Dean is sure that Cas has left again. It wouldn’t shock him if that were the case. Cas had developed a habit of showing up and leaving unexpectedly.
“Hold that thought,” Cas says and backs away to the oven to turn it off. They can come back to that later. Dean laughs and heads to the staircase as he starts to unbuckle his pants. They fall dangerously low on his hips and Cas doesn’t think they are going to make it upstairs.
Dean sighs in response and keeps walking. He has to find Cas. He had to find him and tell him how important he really is. He’s not just a baby in a trench coat. He’s his best friend. He has to tell him that’s he’s the only reason Dean is alive. And Benny, of course.
"I'm having a hard time with what happened. I know I should have brought it up sooner, but I feel like now is the right time." Cas takes a breath and reaches for Dean's hand, " I am not ready to live without you. I am not ready to find your body because you went through with suicide."
“I understand pain and regret and I understand having a past that you want to run from,” Cas says and starts walking again. His tone wasn’t angry, but there was some pain there. Cas leaves Dean standing next to his car confused and wondering what the fuck just happened. This was not how he imagined his day going.
“Would you be willing to help me pass these out?” Cas asks. Dean is thankful the other man doesn’t say anything about comparing him to an attractive librarian.
“I saw you come in,” Cas offers and smiles. It’s a small thing, but Dean will take it. Cas doesn’t smile enough. Dean buys the book and has it shipped to his brother.
"I feel like it's not fair that I get to just discover this new part of myself with Gabe with little resistance."
Hi guys! I'm still here! I'll be posting a few chapters in the coming week to help move things along for you. I'm sorry about all the interruptions.
“You have a right to be harsh. I broke your heart. I’m so sorry, Gabe,” Gabriel pets Castiel’s hair and calms him enough to get him to the table to talk.
“Dean!” Sam calls again. Dean shakes his head and slowly walks towards the angel and his brother. Cas’ eyes are closed and his face is bloody. He had definitely been in some kind of fight. Dean kneels down in front of Cas and carefully lifts his chin up.
“Castiel and I had a deal. He backed out. He got what he deserved,” The man says. Charlie turns and looks between Dean and the older man. Dean looks like he’s about to snap at any second.
“You are.” Sam looks down at his hands for a moment and then meets Dean’s eyes. They sit there looking at each other for a few moments but Dean feels like it’s a lifetime. It’s like he can feel all the words that Sam wants to say but can’t. He knew they were going to talk but he didn’t think it would be like this. And certainly not in the fifties themed diner.
“Fuck me,” He says and I freeze. We had laid down specific rules before we started this relationship and him never bottoming was number one.
“Thanks,” Dean mutters. Cas gets up and goes back to the kitchen. Dean takes a few slow sips from his coffee. It’s made perfectly. A little cream and just a hint of sweetener. He used to drink it black, but Cas makes it better than he could ever hope to make it. He can smell the bacon as he gets into the shower. Cas has gotten up nearly every day to make Dean coffee and breakfast. He knows it’s not going to last forever, so he tries not to be used to it, but it feels nice waking up to someone. The urge to leave is still in the back of his mind. He still wants to pack everything up and leave, but it wouldn’t be because he isn’t wanted. There’s a whole new set of feelings coming up.
The line goes dead. There are at least 3 more messages, but he doesn’t bother listening to them. He’s already turning around to go back. No one has actually wanted him to stay after them finding out about his past. He hasn’t even gotten into the details of everything. He doesn’t know if he can trust them, but he wants to. He wants to go home to his friends and be content with his life. He wants to stop fighting against his natural instincts to settle down. He wants to have a house and a yard and a garage to work on the car in. He wants it all, but he knows his life wasn’t made for that.
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas stands and reaches out the hand not occupied by a hamburger. Dean takes it and gives it a firm shake before turning to leave. He feels a little guilty for suddenly leaving, but he’s done okay without friends so far, and who makes friends with a homeless person? I mean, the guy seems normal, aside from his weird name, but who knows. He could have killed for crack or something.
“Yeah. Not much further. I was told he was hangin’ out down by the water. Maybe a mile or so. Think you can make it?”
“Dean, I think we need to renegotiate the terms of our contract,” he says. I look at him and his eyes are closed, almost asleep.
“Charlie?” Dean says and takes a few step towards his friend. The man’s gaze leaves Charlie and lands on Dean.
“Did I wake you up?” He asks. Her hair is all over the place and she looks sad. He sets down a cup of coffee in front of her and gives her a smile. She doesn't say anything for a long time. She just stares at the cup.
“This,” He says and holds up the bag of garbage, ”Whatever I can.” Dean can’t believe his eyes when Cas offers to help an old lady cross the street. The woman hands Cas a few small bills. He thanks her and places the money in his pocket.
“You should make sure you’re more punctual next time.” The man says and takes the boxes without another word. Dean leaves, heading home. It’s not like he had left it on purpose. He shouldn’t have taken it off. Everything would have been fine if he would have just left the stupid thing on. He’s almost home when his phone rings. It’s Alastair. He doesn’t even get a chance to say hello.
The work day is over and Dean makes a beeline for his truck. He doesn’t make it far before his uncle is standing in front of him blocking his way.
“Dean,” He says, and I look at him again using all my strength to pull myself up on my elbows. “Don’t close your eyes.”
I’m left standing in my boxers, pants around my ankles. Cas is still fully dressed. It feels so wrong that there is so much clothing between us. I reach down and unbutton the few buttons on his shirt and remove it as I step out of my pants. He steps forward pushing me back a little and I sway as I find my footing again. He chuckles and reaches out a hand to me. I take it without question and he spins me around so that the back of my knees hit the bed and I fall over. He laughs as he pulls my boxers down my legs. I lift my hips to help.
“We were just talking about that before you got here,” Cas informs. They all laugh and share some snacks before Charlie has to go back to work. It’s always nice when Charlie comes around. She’s a great friend and always tells it like it is. The two men say goodbye and go back to their chores.
Dean drives a little more carelessly than he normally would. If they knew where he lived, Cas could be in danger. God, he will never forgive himself if Cas isn’t on the couch when he gets home. He will never forgive himself.
“I’m sure.” Comes Cas’s reply and Dean can’t stop himself from looking at his friends mouth. He remembers what those lips feel like. His eyes find Cas’s and he feels everything that was wrong in the last few weeks melt away. It’s gone. There is nothing left but Cas and so what if he lets a few tears escape.
“How did this happen?” She asks. He’s not sure if she’s really asking him or not. He doesn’t have an answer, only more questions. Why had Alistair decided to come here? How had Cas even gotten involved in the first place? Dean doesn’t want to talk about his past, but Cas and Charlie seem like good people. If they decide to part ways after they find out what he’s done, he’ll just move on again. It’ll be awful, but he’ll do it if he has to.
I grab him around his middle and lay back so he’s sitting on top of me. His hands are resting on my chest and he’s looking at me with another look I’m not used to. I keep my hands on his waist and he grinds down on me. I throw my head back and moan and he laughs.
"No. I wasn't upset. I was happy. When Charlie brought up your mom you didn't shut down. You thanked her and then moved on. I'm proud of you."
He finds a few people that he’d seen when he used to run around the area, but no one seems to know who Andy is. Gabe shows up with tons of pizzas and cases of water and Dean helps him hand them out while he waits for Andy to show up. He had been in the tent, he’ll be back for sure. Only those who have nothing left go in the tent. It was only a matter of time before he would pop back up again.
“What? You wanted him to make a delivery for you? Huh? Cause people like us, were expendable, right? We’re not worth anything so you can just use us like we’re nothing?” Dean takes another step towards the man and Charlie tenses. She grabs Dean by the arm and starts pulling him away, but he breaks free.
Dean’s sitting on Cas’ bed skimming through a book about extreme outdoor camping when Cas walks into his tent. His hair is much shorter and styled in a way that makes Dean’s mouth go dry. His face is smooth and Dean feels like he’s seeing him for the first time all over again. The sight of the new look makes him stare longer than he intended to.
“Gabe,” Dean chokes out. Gabe stops pacing on the phone and turns to look at Dean who has a smile on his face. He can’t explain that he’s been practicing when he can’t sleep. He can’t explain that it’s easier to say words when it’s quiet.
“I thought you might want that. I don’t want you to forget what I look like,” Dean says. Castiel knows that he doesn’t mean it how it comes out like Dean will be gone someday and Cas will have to live without him. His chest constricts.
By noon, Dean was drunker than he had ever been. The had the windows rolled down on his truck to let the breeze in. He had his back to the driver side door and his feet almost touching the passenger side door. He watched in a drunken haze as birds and other animals wandered around. He thought about Cas and what he was doing. Probably studying for something or sitting in math class taking notes. He was always a good student. Dean pulled out his phone and sent his friend a text.
To Everyone Who Has This Bookmarked: I am changing my Username. I just wanted to let you all know before I did it. It will be changed May 12th.
“You’re welcome,” Dean says, watching as Benny walks up behind her and starts spraying her hair. Her hair is graying at the roots but towards the ends it’s a deep chocolate brown.
“Dean, you can’t just decide to do these trials on your own. You’re going to need help and I want you to know that I’m here for you, okay?” Dean can feel Sam’s eyes burning into him but he doesn’t dare look at him. He can’t, because if he does he’s going to talk. Talking leads to sharing and he didn’t want to share. Sharing meant talking about Purgatory and talking about Cas, a subject both men have been avoiding. Dean keeps his eyes on the road and lets Sam talk about old cases and how excited he is to take a shower that has decent water pressure. He even lets Sam pick the music which would have caused some kind of conversation but Sam keeps quiet about it and lets Dean drive.
It’s then that Dean realizes where they are headed. He hasn’t been living in the area for long but remembers being told about the homeless camp in the woods near the park. Bobby had talked about it when a few people had come in to trade cans for cash. They walk for about fifteen minutes before Dean starts to see the tops of tents and tarps hung from trees. He feels a pang of guilt as he follows closely behind Cas. Maybe Cas has a family out here.
Cas is going to have to leave and Dean knows it. They’re taking a walk to the park and Dean feels like he’s walking in wet cement.
"I can't help it. I just feel like, how unfair that this happened to you and I get to get away with it."
My thigh slots between his legs and I lean into him while holding him in place against the wall. He feels perfect moving against me. Grinding his erection against my leg like he was born to do it. His breath hitches and he lets out a low groan. I kiss him hard and turn us so his back is to the door. I push him back until he’s up against it and reach behind him to find the lock and flip it into place.
“Dean, I’m only gonna say this one time. If your daddy lays another hand on you, accident or not, you call me. Do you hear me?”
He looks down at the bottle again and closes his hand around it. Feeling the light vibrating in his hand is slightly comforting. He can do this. He can find the human and get him out. He has plenty of time to think about his option to stay or go.
“You know me,” Sam replies with a smile. Sam looks out across the water and then sighs. “She was fucked up, huh? I can’t believe that I didn’t see it before we got married. I see it now. She was full of secrets and I just accepted it because I thought we were in love.”
“Honestly, I don’t know. We may have...kissed. He was drunk. It was...well, to be honest, it was nice. He just... I don’t know, Dean. I’m emotionally stunted about this kind of thing. There’s also some shame and guilt there too. I don’t know what I’m doing.”
Sam doesn’t know what to say. Pregnant? She can’t even get pregnant and Dean knows that. He knows because Sam told him a year ago because they had been trying for years to have a baby and the doctors told her that it was impossible. It had broken Sam’s, heart. It had killed him and Dean had been there to pick up the pieces and carry the weight of the news.
Sometimes early in the morning I catch her watching me from the chair in the corner of our room. I can’t help but feel like she already knows how I feel, but neither of us wants to be alone, so we do what we have to do to make it work.
“Really? I mean...after what happened?” Dean pretends not to be listening as Benny brings out the clippers and starts cutting hair from his face. To be honest, he’s terrified that this man who he barely knows is going to slit his throat and laugh at him while he bleeds out.
Dean nods weakly. He knows he should have called his uncle when the drinking started up again, but he didn’t want him to worry. He doesn’t want anyone to worry. He can do this. He can take care of his family by himself. He doesn’t need help from anyone else.
“Dean Winchester. The man who saved my life,” Andy finishes. Dean tries to come up with something to say but nothing comes out. So he just nods. This was definitely not the Andy that he saved. It was, but not really. This person in front of him was so put together and polished. It was like he went through years of therapy in a matter of months. “I’ve been meaning to call or something, but I wasn’t really sure what to say.”
“I can stay. I can do that for you.” I say. I pull out of him take off the condom and throw it somewhere in the room. I can deal with it later. I lay next to him and he pulls me into his arms after wiping himself down with his discarded shirt.
“Hello?” There is a female voice he doesn’t recognize on the other end. He’s only able to make out a few words in his sleepy haze, but they’re enough to have him running through his apartment gathering his things to get to his car as fast as possible.
Also, I have no idea what the time frame for things happening in Purgatory is in the show, but for my story I made up my own time frame.
Dean pulls the pack off his back and the man's eyes rest on the bag, following it as Dean unzips it. He tenses as he pulls out the bag with the hamburger and fries in it and hands it to the guy. It’s still warm. The man relaxes, takes the burger and unwraps it faster than should be possible and shoves it in his mouth.
“We’ve all done things. Do you think he’s just going to let this go? You think he’s going to live his life without you?” Benny laughs to himself and looks towards Dean who’s headed back towards the two men, “He ain’t gonna let this go.”
Sam and Dean are driving back to the bunker from a hunt a few towns over. The drive is uneventful and Dean hates it because there is too much time to think. Sam is asleep and it’s leaving Dean to be a victim of his mind.
It was awful, but it was also freeing. It was all the answers to all the questions he had. It was all the information on Alistair that he would need to take him down. It was why his father had done what he did. He had to wait, though. He had to make a plan. Maybe having Cas and Charlie on his side wouldn’t be so bad.
“That’s how I met Dean. He was checkin’ out the tent city. Helped Castiel hand out some baked goods. Did I tell you he has an interview at the bakery?” This little piece of information seems to make Charlie perk up.
I am going to write a timestamp because I know that some of you might have been looking forward to the wedding and things like that. I don’t want the opinions of others to get in the way of giving you what you want.
He sits and watches the other patrons in the place. There is a couple in the corner leaning in towards each other talking quietly and laughing. There are a couple of families with kids and an older gentleman at the counter sipping his coffee. He smiles at the simplicity of it all. Sam shows up a few moments later.
Dean isn’t sure how much time has passed when he wakes but he knows he has a sunburn. He slowly rolls himself off the dock and into the water to soothe his burning skin. He comes up for a breath and notices Cas is gone but there is a rock with a piece of paper pinned under it. He pulls himself up onto the dock and looks around before lifting it and picking up the piece of paper. It’s a note written in crayon.
“It’s a bad word, Sammy. Where did you hear it?” Dean demands in a hushed tone. He doesn’t want to wake up his father and risk him hearing this conversation.
“See ya in a few hours,” Dean says and walks over to his truck. He has his work issued jacket and a bagged lunch he made the night before. He can finally begin his work day.
He arrives at the motel in early afternoon with nothing but his wallet, jacket, a duffle bag filled with clothes, and few necessities should he run into trouble. The motel is old and creaked in all the right places and he felt oddly at home there. It reminds him of Bobby’s house when he spots the floor to ceiling bookshelf on the far wall. Dean smiles at the thought of Bobby and his books but he doesn’t let the thought linger too long. Thinking about Bobby means accepting that he’s dead. He knows Bobby is gone but who wants to think about the finality of death of their loved ones? He wants his death to be final but thinking about it for others while he was still living is maddening.
Dean spends most of the next few days in his hotel room feeling sorry for himself. He only leaves for food and more whiskey.
“You coming?” Dean asks. The steam is already making its way out of the small space. Cas strips in record time and joins Dean for a shower. It’s all hands and lips and teeth. Then it’s soap and shampoo and a rinse. Then it’s more lips and touching. They get out and towel off, touching as much skin as the other will allow.
He can’t help but feel guilty that he didn’t take the time to get to know the guy at all. He’s been bringing him stuff for a month, yet he can’t take the time to learn a name?
Dean wakes up and it’s bright. It’s too bright. There are people standing over him. Everything seems familiar, but he can’t place where he is. He sees a face he recognizes. Gold eyes and light brown hair. Gold eyes. Kind eyes.
“I’m fairly certain you know how I feel about you, but,” Cas turns his head and stares at the side of Dean’s face. “I’m ridiculously in love with you and I have been for awhile.”
“Want me to stay?” Cas doesn’t answer right away, but Dean can see the emotions flash across the other man’s face considering his answer.
Dean is about to change the subject when he sees a young kid about seventeen wearing the hoodie that he had given Cas a month ago. His gaze follows an elderly lady wearing his gloves and he spots a man about his age with his backpack. He now understands why Cas has refused his offer to stay at his apartment. Cas does have a family. He doesn’t want to leave them behind.
“Cas?” He reaches over and places a hand on his shoulder lightly shaking him. There’s no response, “Shit.”
“What difference would it have made had I told you then? You would have left!” Cas shoots back. Dean turns back towards the road and starts driving again. Why would Cas care if he had left. Why care at all if he 'ruined his brother's life'. He doesn’t say anything else. They pull up to the apartment and Cas gets out.
“Sam doesn’t want to be around me, I get it. I do, but for him to be with your brother a man I barely know. I’m just, I’m really...I’m pissed off! What do they even do? What do they even talk about?”
“Uh, maybe...I think I should maybe go.” My body is betraying me. If he didn’t know I was turned on before he knows now. It’s like he knows what he’s doing to me and I think I like it. It’s not like at work where it’s innocent. It’s a want and a need so great that I feel like I might explode.
Dean looks up at the ceiling and stares at it. The swirls in the plaster resemble what he’s feeling right now. Parts of him are happy. He's so happy that Cas is here. But there are other parts that remind him that good things do not happen to him.  He knows Cas is going to leave him again. His best friend is going to die and all he wants to do is tell him how much he loves him. The thoughts curl in on each other and make Dean feel like his head is going to explode.
There wasn’t a reply after that and Dean frowns. He misses his friend. He needed his friend and the way that he was able to make everything better. He missed the way he could calm Dean down with little effort. Usually a touch to the hand or a look was all Dean needed. The smallest gesture from Cas and all the pain and suffering was gone.
“You're welcome!” Dean calls out hoping that he heard him. Dean makes his way back to his own house and is greeted by an excited Sammy and a sleeping father who has twelve empty beer bottles on the table next to him. Dean stalks to the kitchen with Sammy close behind.
“Cas and I used to be pretty close. It’s hard not to want to be friends with someone so caring and loving. When he first got here he had nothing. So, I took him in for awhile. He was working at Gordon’s part time. Alistair started coming in regularly and they had a weird friendship, but it was more like cat and mouse. He was scary and creepy and Cas, you know Cas. He’s kind. He wants to give everyone a chance,” She looks at Dean and gives him a small smile. “Anyway, one day Alistair doesn’t come in. Of course, Cas goes looking for the guy thinking he’s in trouble. At that time, there wasn’t much of a camp, but he somehow found Alistair there trying to recruit some kids to deliver something for him. Cas said he’d do it instead. That I know of it was the only time, but Alistair never stopped asking.”
Dean likes taking long walks in the woods. He’s just made it past the line of trees when he hears a sound coming from behind him. Dean whips around his hand automatically goes to his hip where his pocket knife is sitting. He crouches down and stays as still as possible and waits. He scans the trees, but he sees nothing. He slowly stands and starts walking again.
“I love you so much, it hurts. I can’t breathe when you aren’t here. I feel like I’m drowning. I miss you everyday. I miss you even when you’re here. I never want to be without you. I need you,” The words spill from Dean’s mouth. Even if he wanted to stop talking he couldn’t. He wouldn’t. Cas deserved to know everything.
The panic sets in before he can get to the hospital. He’s speeding and he hopes with everything in him that he doesn’t get pulled over. Cas is in trouble and for some reason, he had been used as the emergency contact. He doesn’t have time to worry about how Cas had even gotten his number in the first place.
He walks up to his house and stands in the driveway. It doesn’t even seem like the same place anymore. It’s dark and looms over him. It makes him feel like the house is watching him and warning him not to go inside, but he needs his stuff. He needs to get away and he can’t do that with nothing. He takes a few steps up to the porch and sees something out of the corner of his eye. A camera. It’s sitting in plain sight, but he knows he wouldn’t have noticed it otherwise. The red light blinks at him and he knows that it will only be a matter of time before they find him now. How long had they been watching him?
“Dean, I don’t want to kill the mood, but are you sure you’re ready for this?” Cas asks between kisses. Dean takes the smallest step back and thinks about Cas’s question for a fraction of a second.
“Dean,” There are hands on either side of his face and his eyes are meeting gold. “Listen to my voice, okay? Just listen. Take a breath, Dean. You can do this,”
“Alright, your paperwork is here,” the man points to a desk. "Fill them out and bring them to me when you’re done and I’ll get you set up. Do you have your watch?”
They lay in bed and talk some more just like when they were young. It feels good and healing for both men to be open. Dean still wants to clam up, but he forces himself to say what he needs to say. For a moment the darkness in Dean’s mind is gone. The emotions bring tears to his eyes.
“No. I swear I didn’t know,” She answers. All Dean can see is the fear in their eyes and he wishes that he had never come here. They didn’t deserve this. They didn’t deserve any of this.
“I didn’t tell him his name. Dean already knew,” Charlie confesses. Cas stands up so quickly his chair falls over. He stares at the two of them as he backs away from the table. He looks hurt and afraid.
He stops walking when he reaches the bench at the entrance to the trail and places his head between his knees to calm himself.
“Castiel,” He replies and takes the bottle from Dean’s hands. He opens it, drinking down half the bottle in just a few seconds.
Dean feels the guilt clawing it’s way up his body, digging in and refusing to let go. He wants to tell sam everything. He wants to make him understand that talking about it makes it real. He swore to himself he would never talk about it again. Anger suddenly replaces his guilt and he pulls the door open all the way and launches at his brother, grabbing his shirt and pulling him down to his level.
After a quick shower and a trip to the liquor store, Dean comes to terms with the fact that he had lied to Sam. He knows this is what he needs. He needs to be alone, even if it’s just for the night. He wanted to be honest with Sam but sometimes you just need your fear and regret as company and it’s best to greet those old friends in private. You have to be away from those who trust you with their lives. It was wrong to let them see you fray at the edges and slowly start to fall apart. He could think about Purgatory freely here. He could think about Cas and how he had left him once again.
He goes to Oregon. It’s a small town of 1,000. He spirals into depression and sleeps with anyone willing. He works in a grocery store and keeps enough money in his wallet in case he has to leave again. He calms down after awhile. He finds a girlfriend and volunteers for the fire department two summers in a row. After the second summer, he starts getting calls from a strange number. He leaves in the middle of the night. He leaves a letter saying sorry and not to look for him. He doesn’t want them to end up getting hurt. They will be hurt that he’s gone, but that’s better than what would happen if Alistair found them.
He could run. It would be so easy to get away. But he can’t do that to his family again. He can’t make them worry. He can’t make them think that he’s dead or that he’s gone and never coming back. He doesn’t think his brother could live through that again.
They say their goodbyes and Dean almost wants to end his shift early and go back to his apartment. He doesn’t want to think about being back home and it sucks when Sam asks when he’s coming to visit. He doesn’t have the heart to tell him that he’s not. He can’t. It would have to be a cold day in Hell before he ever set foot in his father’s house again.
Cas agrees to stay for five days so Dean takes a week off. Dean doesn’t mention the fact that his hand tingles where Cas held it.
“Are you alright, Dean?” Cas asks concerned. He sets his jacket down on the back of the chair just inside the tent. He looks so different without his giant trench coat on. He’s wearing a plain gray fitted t-shirt and faded blue jeans. Jeans that Dean is pretty sure were sent from heaven because they are perfect. On his feet, he’s wearing a pair of beat-up Chuck Taylors. He’s pretty sure his mouth is hanging open. “Dean?”
“He started the trials.” Dean blinks at his brothers words and takes a deep breath letting the words twist and pull, making a home in his brain.
“You need to leave,” He repeats and his eyes drop to the ground in front of Dean. Dean feels like there’s barbed wire wrapping itself around his heart. The pain is almost crippling. He had risked his life this whole time to find Cas and he’s telling him to leave? Dean needed him. He needed him more than he needed anything else. Dean pushes past Benny’s arm and stands a few feet in front of his friend. Cas’ eyes trail up Dean’s body and rest on his face but his gaze never meets Dean’s.
He parks half-assed in a parking space and runs into the emergency room. There aren’t many people, but there are enough that he feels all eyes in the room shift to him as he runs in. He scans the room looking for the front desk and his feet start moving towards it before his brain can even register what he’s seeing.
He can picture Cas sitting there on his couch in the apartment they have shared for the last few months. He’s probably sitting in the light of the Christmas lights they put up a few days after Thanksgiving. He’s probably straining his ears to hear the sound of the Impala pulling into the parking lot. Or maybe he’s wrong. Maybe Cas left. Maybe he won’t be there when Dean gets back. He doesn’t want to think about that so he carefully dials Charlie. She picks up on the first ring. He explains what happened and she listens without saying a word and she promises to let Cas know that he’s on his way back and that he’ll never ever leave Cas again.
“I told you I LARP, Dean. I happen to be a big deal. I’m the queen actually,” She says and that’s all that’s said about it. She takes off the cape but leaves the flower crown on. He doesn’t know why but for some reason it makes him happy that she leaves it perched on top of her head.
“Cas, please. I’ve been thinking about this all day. I need it. I need...you,” I close my eyes for a brief moment and then look at him again. “Do you want me to get on my knees? I will. I’ll beg if that’s what you want.”
Dean moves his hand to the door handle and pushes the door open. He isn’t going to argue, he had just almost killed them. The crisp cold air fills the car and makes Dean wish they were already back at the bunker so he can sleep in his nice, warm, memory foam bed. He stretches his tired muscles before passing Sam in front of the Impala. As he turns to get into the passenger seat he sees a small movement out of the corner of his eye. He faces the rear of the car and tries to make his eyes focus on the figure moving towards him. He quickly moves his hand to the gun on his hip. He looks to Sam who’s standing on the other side of the car in a similar stance. He turns his eyes back to the figure and slowly starts to realize who it is and watches as he falls about ten feet from the back of the car.
Dean shifts in his seat and looks out into the alleyway. Sam has a way of always asking loaded questions that Dean can’t quite answer. “Alright, what’s going on? Are you okay?”
Around 10PM he makes his way to bed. He’s tired and has to go to school the next day. He’d rather dropout and work for his uncle but he promised Cas he would try to graduate on time.
Charlie sets the folder down on the coffee table across from Cas. His eyes don’t leave it. He stares at it as if it’s going to open by itself or if it will start talking to him.
“Benny are we getting close?” Dean isn’t one for complaining but he’s tired, hungry, and thirsty. Benny looks over his shoulder and Dean and smiles.
“Well, I’d love to tell you, I really would. But information around here ain’t free. I’m gonna need something from you,” The man opens his mouth to show his sharp fangs. Dean’s grip on his knife tightens and the man’s eyes fall to Dean’s hand. “Keep calm there, brother. I’m not gonna do anything I’m gonna regret. I know what you’re capable of. Just wanna make sure you know who you’re dealing with.”
“He knows about the drugs. He knows about what you do. He knows everything and he’s going to out Alistair to the police.”
Why hadn’t he just been honest with Cas? Why hadn’t he just tried harder to forget Purgatory? Why hadn’t he been honest with Sam? Why had he done so many bad things in his life?
“I needed you, Cas. Didn’t that mean anything to you? Didn’t Benny’s life mean anything to you?” Dean pushes off from the wall and walks to the other side of the room. His head is spinning.
“Handle your brother,” His dad spits and turns to the fridge. It’s clear he isn’t sober and Dean sighs.
“Thank you, John.” The man says and turns to leave. John nods in response and grabs Dean roughly by the shoulder and looks down at Dean’s feet. His new shoes are soaked and probably ruined. He looks up at his dad and bites the inside of his lip. He knows what’s going to happen and he can’t say he blames his dad for being mad at him. He shouldn’t have worn his new shoes and he should have taken them off before jumping into the water.
“Hey! New word!” Gabe says and hangs up on whoever he’s talking to. Dean wants to laugh, but he just keeps smiling.
Dean’s eyes snap open and he sits up. He’s met with Cas’ gaze. He’s sitting at the end of Dean’s bed.
As usual they stare at eachother a little too long and Dean feels like there is fire in his ribs. He wants to reach out and pull Cas into a hug and tell him how sorry he is but he forces himself to stay put. His eyes finally leave Cas’ eyes and he’s able to see that Cas doesn’t look well. His face is too sharp looking, his cheeks are hollow, and there are incredibly dark circles under his eyes. Dean’s chest aches with the want and need to ask him what’s going on. He almost does but he bites his tongue hard enough to draw blood to stop himself. He nods at Cas instead. He can take him to the store. He can do that one simple thing. It’s the least he could do. He searches Cas face for any sign of relief or happiness but there’s nothing. Just a blank lifeless stare that wraps around Dean’s insides and squeezes.
“Who’s this?” She asks looking at Dean. She then promptly stuffs the bagel in her mouth. She stares at Dean while she chews and it makes him feel like a bug under a magnifying glass.
Sam hangs up and leaves Dean to his devices. He could keep driving or he could turn around. He had already done this to Cas before. Just leaving without a word.
A few more minutes pass and he notices the manila envelope on the desk. The corner of it is barely sticking out, but he recognizes the handwriting and pulls it out of the stack. It says “Agent Jody Mills” across the front. It’s much thicker than his envelope. Just as he’s about to open it the door opens behind him. He sets it down with an embarrassed “sorry,”.
“Yes, I’m fine,” There’s a brokenness in Cas’ voice that Dean recognizes right away. He knows without a doubt coming in Cas’ room was a huge mistake.
Confused? That's okay! Head back to the very beginning to re-read the story with all the new additions.
“You know?” Cas’s eyes find his brothers. It comforts Castiel in a strange way. Like maybe when he left time was frozen and it didn’t rip out his brother's heart like he imagines it did.
“The day you told him to leave...he came to me and told me that he had started the trials. He wanted to tell you, Dean.” Sam’s face is unreadable and his voice is too calm, “He wanted to be the one to tell you.”
“I was just thinking about how sexy you are when you’re covered in grease from head to toe.” He confesses. Dean’s cheeks pink at the admission and he smiles.
Dean gave him a small wave and disappeared into the back room to change into his coveralls and work boots. If this was how his week was going to end he wasn’t sure he even wanted to be there. There were many things that could go wrong and some of them included death. He was grateful his uncle noticed he was having an off day and gave him simple tasks to complete. A few oil changes and a couple battery swaps. Nothing that would result in too much damage if things went wrong.
“We’re a mess,” Cas says and laughs. It’s not a real laugh, but Dean still stores it away anyway. Dean nods in agreement and helps Cas get his things ready to go. Cas can stay with him as long as he needs.
The three men make their way into the office and sit in various places in the room. Sam sits in the chair next to Ava's desk and Cas and Dean sit on the couch across from the desk while Ava sits in the other chair next to Sam.
Sam hasn’t been around much. He drunkenly called Gabe one night to pick him up from a bar and hasn’t left Gabe’s couch since. It’s been three weeks. He can’t even drive onto his street without feeling like he’s going to throw up or cry.  He can’t look at his home. He can’t look at all the things that Ruby left behind. He’s done with her, yes, but he can’t help but feel a hole in his chest when he thinks about her. He tried to pretend that he’s okay, but he’s not. He’s thankful to have found a friend in Gabriel.
“Cas, I’m gonna…Oh, shit,” It’s too late. My orgasm hits me and I see stars while filling the condom inside Cas. I can feel him tightening around me and I almost think I have died and gone to heaven. I look down just in time to see Cas come all over himself and my hand. His eyes are closed and his mouth is open. His face is flushed and he’s perfect. I can’t help but stare. He opens his eyes and stares right back.
“Last name?” The nurse asks lazily and Dean mentally kicks himself for never learning Cas’s last name. His face must give him away because she starts typing away on her computer without saying anything else. His mind is going a million miles a second and he doesn’t know where he’s going, but as soon as the words of where Cas is are out of her mouth he’s moving again.
Cas raises his hips and Dean moves down his body to help remove his boxers. He’s never seen Cas up close and naked before. He’s kinda surprised to see that Cas is all lean muscle. He runs his hands up Cas’s body and watches as Cas arousal peaks. Dean can’t help but lick his lips. He’s always wanted to know what Cas tasted like.
“You don’t know what that light is. You tried to touch it and you are not human,” The man says quickly and Benny slowly shakes his head, “It’s a portal. Only humans can pass through.”
“Dean!” Dean jumps at the sound of his name. He whispers and apology to the man on the floor and rushes back to the car. Something tells him this job is going to last alot longer than he originally thought. This couldn’t have been what Chuck wanted him to do. This couldn’t be what Chuck does. He gets back in the car with Crowley and he realizes that this was less about Garth’s boss and more of a warning to him to do better. It was a threat of what would happen to him if he were ever late again.
,” Dean thinks and starts the engine. As much as he had previously wanted Cas to come back he wasn’t ready for this.
On the fourth day Dean finds Sam in the library looking through some books that he thinks mentions Metatron. The bunker is proving to be more useful than just a place to shower, eat, and sleep in safety. Dean picks up the book closest to him and thumbs through the pages and sighs. He knows Sam has looked up from his own book and is staring at him but he doesn’t look back.
This chapter is NSFW. Skip the the italicized section at the very end if you don't want to read Dean and Cas having sex.
“These make me very...happy,” He says and smiles around his second bite. Dean can’t help but smile too.
The boys are about fifty miles out from the bunker when Dean starts to get tired. It’s just about 4AM and Sam grabs the wheel from Dean’s hands, yelling at him to wake up. He had been driving in the wrong lane. Luckily, there had been no oncoming traffic.
He doesn’t know how many hours it’s been, but he knows that he should be talking by now. He can think clearly. His ribs hurt like a bitch, but he can think clearly. He tries to talk, but the words won’t come out. He tries to write and he can’t make his hands move. He has tubes and wires coming in and out of his body and he wants to scream that he’s okay. He wants Gabe to stop looking at him like that. He wants Andy to stop leaving and he can’t tell anyone anything.
Dean is only partially aware of what Cas is talking about. His last few nights had consisted of drinking until he couldn’t stand and then puking all day the next day. He vaguely remembers cursing the angel.
“No, I’m named after an angel. My family is very religious. I have three brothers and a sister. We’re all named after angels,” Castiel sets the bottle down next to his thigh and picks up the burger again.
“I-I think you had a panic attack. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have taken off like that,” She says and leans back onto her heels. Her flower crown is crooked on her head and he reaches up to fix it. She smiles at him. He drinks down the rest of the water before trying to sit up in a more comfortable position.
“You’re dying, Cas,” He says. Cas takes a step back and the moment is over. Dean lets out a breath and stands a little straighter, “Why, Cas?”
“The portal is for human use only but if your soul were to somehow find it’s way into Dean you could pass through as well.”
“Alright, brother. Let’s go find your angel.” He smiles at Dean and it looks sincere, but then again, he is a vampire and vampires can’t be trusted.
“Dude, you were like totally zoned out. I literally said I eat fat pig balls every night and you didn’t even flinch. What’s going on?”
It’s true. Dean doesn’t know where to start. Everyone was right. He should have told Sam a long time ago about his time on C-street and what he did for Crowley.
Cas looks down at his lap. He doesn’t say anything, but Dean can see the shame on Cas’s face. He takes a step in the door and closes it behind him and takes a seat in the chair next to the hospital bed.
“No, I was- Uh-” Shit. Does he tell him he was about to search for him and bring his ass back to the apartment?
“Jesus, Dean! Why didn’t you just wake me up?” Sam slowly lets go of the wheel as Dean pulls off to the side of the road. He grips the wheel tightly and lets his breath even out before he speaks.
Dean waits a few days before going back to C Street. It had been way too emotional and he had spent the last few days sulking and having horrible flashbacks of some of the things that he had to endure. When he goes back, he goes during the day. There are less shady things going on during the day. He walks around looking for the guy from a few days ago, but he avoids the back of the alley. He doesn’t like it there. It makes him want to peel his skin off and grow new untainted skin.
“Hey, Sam,” Dean says quietly. There’s no movement in the room, so Dean walks over to his brother's bed and turns on the lamp next to it. His brother's sleeping form is illuminated in the dim light. There is a book on his chest and papers all over the bed. He must have fallen asleep studying.
Dean blinks a few times. Not real? Everything about what’s he’s feeling is real. It’s the most real thing he’s felt in a long time, besides what he feels for Sam. He’s sure. He loves Cas. Why does Cas not believe him?
“Okay,” I tell him and sit up and scoot to the side of the bed. I’ve topped a few times but never like this. This is different and suddenly I’m kinda terrified of what this means. We had already broken rules and now this. Something is happening, but I can’t quite figure out what it is. All I know is I’m about to fuck Cas. I look at him one more time and the desire and want are back in his eyes.
“Maybe I can help,” He takes another step towards me. There are only a few feet between us. I can smell his aftershave and cologne. Okay, he’s propositioning me in the men’s room on our first real date. I didn’t think he had it in him.
He gives Gabe a small smile and heads down the alley to the tent. He gets catcalled a few times by the locals it makes him want to take a three-hour shower and scrub his skin until there is nothing left but bone. He gets to the tent and waits. There are no sounds coming from inside so he rings the small bell next to it. There’s no answer.
“I’m sorry.” Dean says. Cas moves to the side and Dean takes no time at all to get out of there. He wants to wrap his arms around Cas so badly that it hurts but he can’t let himself get too close. Not this time.
“Take a look, Mufasa,” Dean chuckles. Cas’s eyes leave Dean’s face and land on the phone. His expression changes to a much softer one and small smile forms on his face. Dean pulls his phone out of Cas’s view and pockets it, shaking his head. “I’ve only seen one other person with hair like that!”
“You wish I would say something? Do you have any idea how betrayed I feel right now! I feel like I don’t even know who you are anymore. I don't know what I feel right now.” Dean pulls off onto the side of the road and turns himself towards Cas.
“You shouldn’t have done that,” His voice sounds snake like and makes Dean feel like he’s going to throw up. No one's voice should sound that twisted and evil. He knows a voice like that and it makes his skin crawl.
I am so sad to be ending this story, but It's time. Thank you all so much for reading and all the comments/messages on Tumblr. I am so thankful and blessed to have been able to share this with you. I will be starting a new fic soon and I hope that you'll take the time to read it as well.
Dean sits at the table and fills out the paperwork. It’s all basic stuff like his name and age and how many deliveries he’d like to make a week. It doesn’t even ask for his address or work history. It only takes him a few moments to fill it out before he’s walking back up to the front desk. There is another man standing there with the guard.
“This is it,” Cas says and he steps through a tent flap. Dean stops outside the entryway. He feels like he should be doing more to help Cas. “Are you coming?”
“Yes, let's go.” This shouldn’t be happening. This isn’t a thing that happens to him. Dean feels like he’s overheating. He’s gotta get outta the tent. It’s suddenly too small and too confining. He pushes past Cas and starts towards the trail. He hears Benny behind him yell something and Dean waves over his shoulder. His breathing is erratic and his vision is blurring.
“No.” Dean laughs. “I have to work early so be ready by six-forty-five. I’ll be here at exactly then.”
Finally, he finds the right room number and bursts into the room without knocking. He sees Cas sitting in a hospital bed. There are cuts and bruising on his face and his arm is in a sling. The wires from the IV are visible and Dean lets out a breath of relief to see that Cas is alive.
“Cas, this isn’t your fault,” Dean stands up. He doesn’t want Cas to know about his past. He doesn’t want to see the look on Cas’s face when he knows what he did.
“You scared me.” She says. She takes a few steps and gives him a quick kiss before walking back to the counter. She leans a hip on it and crosses her arms across her chest.
“Why would you say something like that? I’m sure he has a good reason for leaving us out of whatever is going on with him. He may not be human but he was very clear about the guilt that he felt about what he did in Heaven. I don’t know about you, but I can identify with that,” Dean knew Sam was right. Cas had felt a lot of guilt for what he had done in Heaven. He had killed thousands of his brothers and sisters and he knew trying to argue with Sam about it was useless because Sam himself had some guilt about things he had done in the past.
“No. I woke up and you were gone and no matter how many times I asked mom and dad what happened they never gave me an answer,” Gabe plays with the handle of his mug. He looks up and watches as Castiel’s shoulders sag.  A new wave of sadness washes over his brother. He doesn’t cry but the pain is written across his face in dark thick lines that can never be erased.
“What did you tell him, Ruby?” He asks more forcefully. His voice is louder now and she looks defeated.
“What do you mean you aren’t going back?” Benny was gobsmacked. He has spent the last year trying to get these assholes outta here and now this?
“What happened?” Dean can hear books being slammed closed and a chair being scraped across the floor.
Dean stops and turns. Charlie backs away from him rubbing the sore spot on her arm where Dean’s grip had been. She grabs for her phone in case she needs to call the police. Her hands shake and she presses the numbers into the phone.
“Okay.” Gabe never pushes. He just asks the hard questions and lets you think it over for weeks on end until you crack and tell him everything. It isn’t going to happen this time, though. He can’t risk anyone getting involved because of him. He’s seen what happens to innocent bystanders in Alistair’s way. They end up dead or worse.
When Benny opens his eyes again he knows its close to night fall. He’s propped up against a tree and feels better than he ever has. He reaches a hand to the back of his head to check for bleeding but there is nothing there. Not even a scratch or bump.
“I’m sorry, Sammy. I didn’t realize I was that tired,” Dean slowly looks over at Sam, who’s less than amused with the current state of things. Dean lets his hands fall to lap and presses his forehead against the steering wheel.
“Give him a call and see what he has to say for himself. It’s not like you’re not on speaking terms.”
Dean gets up and walks down the stairs to see his father holding a large mailing envelope. He can see from the entryway into the kitchen that his father’s name is written in large bulky lettering and there’s no address. Dean figures someone must have dropped it off after he had gone to bed.
“I could never forget what you look like,” Castiel says and puts the photo back in the bag along with the clothes. “Thank you.”
“He wants to go back to Lawrence. He wants to go to college. He wants new shoes. He wants to join the debate team. He wants and wants and wants and wants. He never says thank you. He doesn’t do shit around the house. He doesn’t care that his mother is gone-”
The boy is face down and not moving. Dean moves quickly to get his face out of the water. He wraps an arm around the boy and flips him over to get him on his back. Dean is careful to make sure his hand is firm across his chest with the boy’s head resting on his shoulder. He has to make sure to keep his face out of the water before starting to pull his lifeless body to the dock.
“Ava said you were going to stop by for some clothes. I got a bag together for you, but you are more than welcome to go upstairs and get whatever you want,” Dean’s words are kind but they are careful. Like he doesn’t want to say something that he can’t take back. Dean sets the bag down at the bottom of the stairs and heads to the kitchen. Cas watches as he goes. He doesn’t know what to say. He looks at the bag for a moment before walking over to it and unzipping to see what Dean had packed for him.
Dean nods and leans his head on Cas’s shoulder. This has become common in the past few days. Little touches here and there. Nothing too intense, just small intimate moments to let one know that the other is there. Dean can feel the tension between them, though. It creeps in when moments like this happen. When it’s just the two of them. Dean can feel Castiel’s questions and it makes him crazy that he doesn’t just ask them and get it over with.
Cas would count the freckles on Dean’s face after he had spent the day in the sun. He would sit a little too close and lean his head on Dean’s shoulder when no one else was around. When Dean spent the night, Dean would sleep on the floor, but by morning Cas would be pressed up against him. It wasn’t sexual, just intimate. Private. Like Cas was trying to tell him something.
“I’m sorry, sir. My brother was running late and then I forgot the watch. So, I went back to get it.” Dean explains. The man has a wry look on his face and it makes Dean feel like he’s being watched under a magnifying glass.
“I suppose I take after my mother in that area,” He says simply. Benny pauses and looks at Dean who meets his eyes. It’s like he’s trying to convey some kind of message. Like something important had happened and he missed it.
Once he’s in the city it’s easier to hide from passing cars. He thinks about going to C Street but he knows that they will look for him there. It was only a matter of time before they turned on him. He feels like he knew it would happen, but he didn’t expect it to be like this.
“I do have it better than some,” Cas sets his bag down and pulls out several bags of bagels. Dean watches as he takes two and puts them aside. He then pulls out a tray from under the bed and places the bagels carefully on the tray. Cas’ hands look cold. His long fingers pick up each bagel so gently. Dean wishes he was one of the bagels for only a second before he realizes what he’s thinking.
“Cas, I’m glad you called.” It’s not a lie. In truth, he had been missing him all week. It was nice to have someone there even if it was awkward half the time they talked. They never really talked about anything substantial until the day Dean went to the camp and even that wasn’t an actual conversation.
Benny’s shop is a few doors down from the bookstore. It’s small and looks like something out of a magazine, complete with an old school coke machine and dark hardwood floors. Dean enters and he’s greeted by a redhead who introduces herself as Charlie. While he waits his turn she talks about Star Wars and her crazy weekend adventures in the park doing something called LARPing. Dean isn’t quite sure what LARPing is, but she’s so passionate about it she keeps his attention.
Dean is relieved to be away from Sam so can can have some time to himself but there’s a growing guilt creeping it’s way into every fiber of Dean’s being. He swore he would protect Sam and keep him safe and here he is in some dingy motel about to drink himself silly. There are no disappearing customers. He lied to Sam to get away and he feels like a coward and part of himself wishes Crowley would catch him.
They order their food and make small talk. He wishes he had more to say, but he doesn’t. He can’t stop thinking about Cas and how uncomfortable he had looked before he left. Sitting here listening to Charlie talk about computers is nearly impossible when he has the urge to get up and leave.
This may get a bit weird after this because we're getting to the parts that I'm still re-writing (because I accidentally deleted a HUGE portion of this fic).
Sleep doesn’t come easily. The doctors told him he has a traumatic brain injury and that he shouldn’t be alive. He shouldn’t have lived through what he went though. He can’t remember what is it he went though and he can’t ask anyone either. He’s starting to get bored and the healing wounds on his face itch and he can’t scratch them. His hands and arms barely move.
“Fight,” Dean says. The rage boiling under his skin is the only thing that is going to keep him going at this point.
“I appreciate the offer but no, thank you.” Castiel starts to walk away. Dean follows. Castiel stops and turns around. His face is so close to Dean’s he can feel the man's warm breath on his face, “I said no.”
Dean nods at the guy in response. The man doesn’t say anything else. He just picks up his book and starts reading again. Dean backs away and heads back to his car. He can admit that the interaction was awkward, but he feels better having done something for someone else.
“He said something about Gordon’s,” He replies. Something flashes across her face and then she’s standing and rushing out the door as she pulls her cape around her shoulders. He’s still sitting at the table looking at the spot where she had been when he realizes that she knows who hurt Cas. He drops a fifty down on the table and follows her out as quickly as possible. He doesn’t want to lose her and then feel responsible for her getting hurt or something.
My eyes trail down his body and land on his dick. I want to taste it. I know that I shouldn’t because it’s a rule that we put in place for a reason, but it looks so inviting sitting there leaking all over the place. It twitches and my mouth starts watering. I look up and I see Cas watching me. My fingers still and I reach my other hand to touch him.
Wednesday sucks. Dean skips school again, but he does go to work. He avoids his uncle the best he can, but he knows that he’s going to get yelled at for missing work. He will also no doubt be questioned about his black eyes and bruised upper lip.
Castiel and Dean had been friends since before either boy could talk. Their parents had been friends in high school and ended up being neighbors until the boys were sixteen. Dean had to leave when his dad got a new job six hours away from everything he knew and loved. It wasn’t a huge change because his uncle Bobby owned an auto shop where they were moving.
“Not currently. I’m the next best thing.” The man laughs. He then lets out a sob and then reaches out and grabs ahold of Dean and holds him so tight Dean can barely breathe. He can’t stop the tears that come out of his eyes. He helps the man out of the tent and takes him to Gabe who’ll help get him out of here, at least for the night.
“Yeah, we’ll be there soon.” Dean hangs up and looks at Cas who's still standing in the doorway of the bedroom. "Charlie needs us to meet her at Benny's."
“Dean, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to, I’m sorry.” His dad is kneeling on the floor staring at his hands. The larger man grabs at Dean and pushes his face into his son’s chest. Dean can’t move. The pain in his nose is so painful. His eyes are stinging with tears but he can’t let them fall. He hears movement from the other room and looks over just in time to see Sam walk into the kitchen with a look of horror on his face.
Cas disappears shortly after Dean has the car packed and ready to go. When he gets driving he’s thankful the angel didn’t stay. He needs this time to think.
He shouldn’t tell him why he calls him Cas. He definitely shouldn’t tell him that in the same conversation with Sam, he told him they’re friends. He doesn’t. Dean can feel the blush coloring his cheeks, “Uh, yeah.”
“This is Dean. He used to own those gloves you’re wearing,” Cas sets the nearly empty tray down next to him on Benny’s work table and smiles at her. The woman keeps looking at Dean.
The pull up to the back of the building and two men are standing outside waiting. Dean doesn’t like the way anything looks. Something bad is going to happen and he knows it. He shouldn’t have taken this job. Crowley opens his door and greets one of the men. He completely ignores the other and Dean doesn’t miss the way the man scowls at Crowley.
He pulls up into a parking spot that faces the water and he turns off the ignition. He stares at the open water and watches as people walk by with their kids and pets. There are a ton of geese roaming around squawking and opening and closing their wings.
“He hangs out with Castiel.” Benny says. Then, “Alright, brother, no moving. I’m gonna have to use my electric first to get some of this hair outta the way.” He knows not to move and part of him thinks that Benny brought Cas up at this exact point on purpose.
The way he says sorry makes Dean want to cry. It doesn’t sound like “I’m sorry”. It sounds like goodbye. The kind of goodbye that can’t be taken back. He knows in that moment that he won’t ever see Andy again because he’s going to disappear or worse. Maybe Alistair and Crowley have a plan for him.
“I’m counting,” That’s all Cas says and Dean closes his eyes again. He doesn’t get touches like this anymore. The touches he gets these days are too rough. He ignores the feeling that bubbles up in his belly and focuses on Cas’s light and gentle touches to his face. This is the first time Cas has touched him all summer. He feels like it should freak him out that someone other than his dad or Sammy is touching him, but it’s Cas, and Cas would never hurt him.
He lives in a small town where barely anything ever happens. That’s how he likes it. Low key and boring. Also, there's the fact that not a soul knows where he came from or knows about his past. That alone is a blessing he thanks the universe for every day.
“We need to talk,” Sam says and guides dean by the elbow to the library and sits him down. Sam pulls up a chair and places it right in front of Dean. He’s sitting too close and it makes Dean feel uncomfortable, “Cas…” Sam doesn’t finish, the silence forces Dean to snap back to the present.
“He’s hurting, Dean? He’s hurting? I ask to go see mom’s grave and I’m treated like I asked to be fucking president. I miss her too, yanno.”
“I don’t know what happened to you, Dean. I don’t know what happened in Purgatory, or what happened between you and Cas,” Sam turns around, “but I can’t help you if you don’t let me in. It’s supposed to be you and me against the world. We’re supposed to be brother’s, Dean, and right now...I feel like I don’t even know you. You changed.”
Even though his shower had relaxed his body, his mind is still racing with thoughts of what’s going on at the bunker. He takes a few more gulps of whiskey and sits at the table in his towel waiting for the thoughts of Cas to slip away. He’s just over half way though with the bottle before he’s drunk enough to get into bed and have a real nights sleep. He stumbles to the bed and falls on top of the blankets, his towel still secure around his waist. Somewhere in the back of his mind he knows no matter what happens now he won’t remember it in the morning.
“Jesus! You nearly made me piss my pants,” Gabe stands and walks over to the bed and takes Dean’s hand. It takes everything he has to squeeze Gabe’s hand as hard as he can. He knows that it’s not much, but he has to get better.
“Stop it,” Cas says. Dean stops walking and looks at his friend, “I know what you’re doing and I want you to stop.”
He takes a few more deep breaths and his heart starts to beat more normally. He keeps a firm grip on Cas’s hand and Cas is staring at him.
Everything about Cas’s behavior before Dean had left makes sense. He’s scared of Alistair. Dean turns his head and looks at Charlie. This time last year? Dean had just moved here then. Was Alistair following him? Did Alistair know where he lived?
Cas follows his gaze. His face thoughtful for a moment and then it’s replaced with an unreadable expression. Benny eyes Cas for a moment longer before he heads off to help Dean who’s arms are full of random pieces of wood.
The beeping wakes him. He can’t move, but he opens his eyes slowly. It’s darker now. There is a body sitting in the chair next to him. They are sleeping. He can’t see as clearly as he should be able to. His eyes aren’t working right. He can feel his heart beating quickly and he can’t catch his breath. He can’t breathe. He slips in and out of consciousness as the body next to him starts moving.
“I’m terrified that I’m doing the work and I’m putting in the time and at the end of the day it’s not going to work. I’m still gonna be fucked up. I’m tired, Sammy. I’m so fucking tired.”
“Oh, I know who you are. You’re kind of a legend around here.” Benny raises his arms and looks out into the dense woods around them. Dean laughs darkly and lowers his knife but keeps his grip unchanged on the handle.
“He’s better when you’re here,” Sam says. Dean blushes. Cas doesn’t respond with words but he knows he’s looking at Sam with a questioning look in his eyes. “I wish I had that with someone.”
The day approaches quicker than he had anticipated. He does his best not to show how nervous he is, but he can sense that Cas knows. He's been extra helpful. Making Dean breakfast in the morning, offering to wash his hair in the shower. He even brought him his pills and offered to drive to the appointment. That part wasn't going to happen, but Dean appreciated the effort.
“Why did you leave Dean behind?” Benny’s voice carries through the open space and cuts Dean deep. Cas starts to back away from him and it feels like he’s losing him all over again. It takes all of the strength Dean can muster not to pull him closer again.
“Don’t you make me feel guilty about this, Sammy! I’ve had enough of feeling guilty,” Deans eyes sting with tears but there is no way in Hell he’s going to let them fall. He has to be be strong, even if there is a storm raging inside his chest.
Dean walks further into the living room and sets his bags down. His dad is slamming things in the kitchen and he knows it would be stupid to say anything. Maybe he won’t. Maybe this time he’ll let his brother and dad work it out themselves.
