‘It's a date then.’
They teamed up against Hawkeye, totally creaming him. Clint demanded individual rematches. He beat Peter but, when he went up against Wade, it went from pool game to pool fight. Pool balls went flying and pool sticks turned into katanas.
“You’re right…you are what I
“Where are we?” Steve asked as he slowly turned to take it all in. There was also a door, bolted shut with five deadbolts and a board across the middle. It wouldn’t be easy to get in or out unless you teleported as they did.
“Oh no,” Tony whispered. “I was just wondering where to start…”
“Well that solves one thing,” Pepper stated, breaking them out of their reverie.
“And it’s killing me,” Tony stated gruffly, shoving the reactor back into his chest. It stung again as a fresh dose palladium rushed through him. This time he became a little dizzy. Tony closed his eyes until it passed to fight back the nausea. When he reopened them, he saw that Howard’s eyes had slid over the rest of his chest, taking in his dark, inflamed veins and settled on Tony’s hand that was still clutching the reactor with a tight grip.
“Would you leave Peter if I let you bond with me?” Steve asked.
Steve chuckled and reached out to run the back of his fingers over Tony’s prickly jaw. Tony leaned his head into Steve's touch with a relaxed sigh. They stared happily at each other and all the bad feelings Steve had disappeared.
The suit sealed itself and then nodded to Tony as Jarvis took control. From the suit, Jarvis replied, “Yes, Sir,” and then took off.
Steve’s chest contracted a little upon the mentioning of Tyler. He slumped into one of the elevator walls and mumbled, “I still don’t even know what she looks like…and I’m being accused of her rape…”
Wade’s eyes instantly heated and he blinked back tears.
It now read: Stark & Son Industries.
With that thought, Steve spun around with the mindset to stop loitering and go to the Emergency Room.
Steve’s heart was beginning to frantically beat against the inner wall of his chest. He decided to jump right into this. If they were being casual there was no need for romance, just carnal pleasure. Steve looked up at his reflection in the mirror. His hair was already starting to dry and was growing lighter in color and his face was bright red. Steve patted down the burning flesh, trying to dispel the coloring. He gave up with a sigh.
Steve watched in amazement as he pulled the calendar up. His jaw dropped as he watched him do it and when he held it out to Steve, Steve confirmed that the doctor’s and the “phone’s” dates matched.
“You’re my mission,” Bucky replied simply as if it explained everything and, sadly...it did.
“I can see why you whined about the size of the Army tubs,” Steve stated ironically.
Surprisingly, Tony looked to him last and, for the first time, he said, “Dad…” The breath caught in Howard’s throat and Tony continued, “…Don’t…I – just…” He sighed heavily and then stated with finality, “Thank you.”
? Baby boy, open your eyes.”
"Don't say anything," Wade whispered. He was afraid of what Peter would say or how'd he react if Wade confessed.
“I think I might have hallucinated a little before passing out…” Tony joked to his friend. Rhodey did not find it as humorous as he did and his frown deepened.
Upon mentioning of Tony’s name, Steve immediately fought back a flush and the memory of “Captain Handsome.” Steve ran his hand over Peter’s soft hair and glanced up at Natasha. He tried to be elusive as Natasha whenever around her but he knew he let something slip by the look in her eye.
– to complete the thought.
Steve would be a great father and he could already picture him smiling warmly at the little boy there were to adopt.
Gilded gates were sealed between him and the property but there was an intercom there. He pressed the button and cautiously said, “Hello?”
Or Tony, whose faith in technology was absolute, would see his implant reset, and know with absolute certainty he was gone.
Tony settled against Steve and closed his eyes. Steve was his fiancé, they had a son, and now he was free of the reactor.
Tony looked back down at Steve and whispered, “I’m going to miss him so much.”
He reached around a cameraman to open his own door. The cameraman saw this and he swung his huge camera around to catch one last image of Steve. The man, however, misjudged where Steve was going to go. Instead of filming Steve entering the car he hit him solidly across the head with the camera lens.
He jerked away from him – more afraid of being recognized than staying by Tony’s side. He scrambled back and Tony’s eyes rolled back into his head and he passed out.
“…Okay, time out, serious question here…Do I turn myself into Robocop?”
Tony curled his fingers around Steve’s and his thumb brushed the back of his hand in a soft caress. He leaned in and whispered to Steve, “No, thank you.”
“Next time…Next time, I’ll make sure someone is there…alright?” Tony implored.
His heart felt too heavy to beat and only felt heavier as he thought of his boyfriend. How was he going to explain this to him??
The older scan had a sprinkling of white dots throughout Tony’s torso.
be trusted.
He went straight to the workstation where Eddie was and asked, “How’s our protoplasm?”
They came up to a small pond that must have been freezing and Steve stated, “You can start taking your baths in my room like the first time…I wouldn’t mind.”
The Soldier nodded and ignored the implant like his master commanded. It became another item at his disposal and nothing more.
“First?” Wade repeated, his voice almost tragic in its level of hopefulness.
“I can see that,
His eyes were spanning the area as he asked and he spotted the familiar red hair of one Pepper Potts. Whatever the bystanders may have said to him went unnoticed as he ran to Pep. She stood at the end of the crowded hallway waiting for the elevator.
Tony was stunned by their entire interaction. That woman was barely there a week and she already had the infamous Winter Soldier whipped.
who knew who you were, nonetheless someone in our unit!” Bucky picked up the mechanic uniform and held it up like it was evidence for a murder. “There are already rumors in the camp but the brass can ignore rumors! They can’t ignore facts or a damned participant!”
Steve jerked violently like the first shot had personally hit him.
“Thank you for telling me. I know it must have been hard,” Tony whispered, rubbing his back gently.
The President and agent wordlessly unbuckled themselves and it undeterred them from their work as they continued to weigh the benefits and cons to the embargo. Steve effortlessly droned them out and focused on the noises of the plane as he stared at the door.
“Nat, it’s not that bad…” Steve began. Part five of the plan was already crumbling around him. He tried to salvage what he could and hoped it would not make things worse. “It’s just that Bucky remembers you and he misses you…”
He cleaned up the lab the best he could. Most of the mess was around Tony with discarded food, empty glasses, and random notes on outlandish inventions that were created from his drunken state and could never work. He threw out the food, cleaned out the glasses in the sink and left them beside it to dry, and then stacked the notes into a neat pile and left them on his worktable.
Tony chuckled and said, “I don’t think that answered my question.”
“Really?” She asked with an edge to her voice.
“I’m not Grumpy. If you’re Snow White, then I’m Prince Charming.” Tony grabbed some jelly out of the fridge and when he turned back around he spotted Steve’s expression and asked, “What’s got you smiling like that?”
Pepper put her hands on his shoulder and hissed, “Woah! Wait! You just had major surgery! You can’t move just yet!”
“We have nothing planned!”
Being with Peter was like a fantastical dream filled with sparkly unicorns, gay rainbows, and the sweetest dick-shaped chocolate lollipops on Earth.
Tony’s eyes flickered down to Peter then back to the frozen image of Steve.
“I see why he wants to but…I…” Wade looked to Peter and continued, “I’m scared of how the media will react to me and…it will change us. I know it will and I’m scared it’ll be for the worse…I don’t want to lose him, Logan…”
Eddie chuckled and said, “I guess not…Though, you clearly trust me with some hefty secrets since I know your number one secret now.”
“Boring,” he announced.
“What do you think I have been trying to do all this time?” Bucky grumbled.
Steve seemed to care if he ate regularly and got enough sleep…things like that made him feel like Steve was too good for Tony.
He lay back down and laid his head on Steve’s chest. He grasped one of Steve’s hands and closed his eyes. It physically felt so nice but it was all wrong. The overwhelming desire to cry and admit defeat was there and was ever present as he held onto his comatose boyfriend.
“It feel alright?” Tony eventually asked him.
Even his breakthrough couldn’t deter him from this man in front of him.
Tony removed the family photo from the wall and they both huddled over it. He and Steve stood together with a young man with a cap and gown. He was about Tony’s height with brown hair and a joyful smile.
“I can honestly say, no. I always thought of Stark as a ladies’ man.”
Tony lifted Steve’s legs over his shoulders and picked up his hips, plunging deeper into him. Tony’s finger dug into the flesh of Steve’s ass and gasped, “Yes. You’re amazing. God, you feel so good. Ahh, yes, Steve. Steve, don’t stop.”
Steve grinned and said, “Of course, Peter. We’ll make a day of it and maybe even stop by Coney Island and walk the boardwalk, go on some rides, check out the aquarium…”
Steve rounded the counter in a few steps. He embraced Tony tightly and gasped, “Thank you!” He buried his face into his shoulder to hide the relieved tears that instantly sprang to his eyes. He gasped again, “Th-Thank you!”
Coulson chuckled and stated, “You know it…” They only spoke for a little longer. He asked her about the mission for Fury and she revealed what she could.
“Goodnight, jerk,” Tony said as he backed out of the room.
Tony’s eyes narrowed and he said, “Didn’t Steve tell you? He said he brought it up. He and I are in a…relationship.”
As Steve punched, the bag went flying back but it did not explode under the force like a normal bag would have. Tony designed the bag. It was made with a tougher fiber and hooked to the ceiling with a rubbery metal alloy that could take extreme violence. Remembering Tony’s part in the bag’s creation made Steve roar and attack the bag with no abandon. He did not know how long he punched the bag but once it finally gave out, Steve was drenched with sweat, shaking with emotion, and still angry.
!” Someone announced and the rest of the car cheered in agreement. Steve muffled a chuckle as the truck moved out.
He quickly flipped through all the pages but paused when he saw a scribbled drawing of Captain America’s shield. He ran his finger over the drawing. He must’ve made it but he did not remember doing so…
“…Steve?” Bucky questioned uncertainly and Steve’s heart soared.
He whispered, “I thought Clint…”
Steve’s head snapped up and he looked up to where the voice emanated with trepidation. He had forgotten about the AI. Jarvis was absolutely loyal to Tony, would he warn him of Steve’s intentions before he had the chance to slip away?
Sam nodded then waved good bye. Both Steve and Tony waved in reply as he took off.
Tears were running down Steve’s face too but he was smiling at Peter. He shakily got to his feet and Vision assisted him part of the way. Steve gasped, “We have a trauma center set up. It – It’s this way.”
Steve smirked and shook his head to dispel the near hysterical laugh that almost escaped his lips. He did smile widely as Tony awkwardly grasped the child to his chest and he kept smiling as Tony found a comfortable position for both of them and then grinned confidently at Peter.
“That sounds beautiful,” Steve whispered and leaned into Tony so he would not see his tears.
“Firstly, release a statement confirming you two are in a relationship and demeaning the photographer for intruding on a private, emotional moment,” Pepper stated. “Which I am writing right now and will be sending out within the hour.”
She never seemed bothered by his surprise or reluctance.
Peter waved to his aunt one last time and then jumped into the car and jerked Wade in after him.
Peter took Wade’s silence as enough of an answer and laughed humorlessly. He looked up at Wade with a sad smile and interlocked his fingers behind Wade’s neck. Peter stated, “See? It’s not possible so…let’s just go back to kissing.”
Natasha scoffed and said, “This was what you were planning to happen.”
“For a little…”
An older man stepped outside the residence and stared pointedly at them.
She turned to the remaining officers, who had drawn their guns on her, and informed them, “Let me try asking this nicely one more time…”
“And just like that we are dancing,” Tony whispered into his chest.
The holo of Bucky Barnes stepped into the projection with a familiar, smooth gait and was wearing the same cocky smile Tony had grown used to in the weeks he’d gotten to know the man.
Steve sighed heavily, running his hand through his hair and murmured, “That could have gone better…”
“What’s Unca Tony doing?” Peter asked sharply, fear laced his voice. He looked up to Steve, his face displaying unmasked concern, and he clutched his toy tightly.
Wade’s fingers tightened slightly into Peter’s flesh and he returned the kiss with a tiny, needy noise. His kiss was everything Peter remembered it to be. Peter felt all of Wade’s love and concern pour over into their linked lips. Wade’s lips were tender when pressing into his and his tongue gentle when caressing just the inside of his lips, like going any deeper might hurt Peter further…but he didn’t stop kissing him. He peppered kisses over his mouth like every kiss was stolen and precious and then he began to whisper, “I love you – I love you so much, Peter – I love you, Peter –
Tony laughed and leaned into his side saying, “Pops would never hurt Dad. Additionally,
“That’s the last thing we should do,” Tony stated and found Steve’s belt. He unbuckled it and slipped his hand in his pants. Steve began to breathe shallowly and trembled in Tony’s hold as he stroked him.
“I need your help, Cap. Seriously, I can’t do this without you and…well, with you knowing I am more than a machine, I was hoping you’ll be able to see how dire my situation is. I am a person, not a machine. I have people back home: friends and loved ones, another life waiting for me. Hell, I’m a superhero too! My tech is needed to help people! I’m not just a piece of technology and I needed someone to see. I need your help and compassion…and maybe some access to food and water...AND coffee! Definitely coffee!...You wouldn't believe the caffeine headache that's been plaguing me! So...Will you help me?”
“COWARD!” The Goblin screamed after Steve and Thor silenced him with a swing of his hammer.
He was given a soul implant when he was old enough as it was Steve’s right as an American citizen “to pursue happiness”. The law was enacted not long after soul implants came about. He had never questioned how the implants were made or where they came from. The secrets behind the technology itself was highly guarded. The company that produced the implants was one of the strongest in the world and were tightlipped about it. The soul implants came about around the same time as the Industrial Revolution (many attributed the start of the revolution to the fact that the implants were being manufactured on such a high scale).
,” Steve whispered discouragingly.
?” His dad implored, sounding worried.
“Yes, I heard Jarvis,” Bruce replied dryly. He asked, “Is our ‘science’ talk done?”
Tony sighed heavily and said, “Okay…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Shock washed over Pepper’s face and she peered at him speculatively. She slowly whispered, “…Tony, why—? A-Are you really?”
From the corner of his eye, Steve turned bright red.
Norman had changed in the year since Steve had last seen him. The man used to look strong, handsome, and had been oozing with arrogance. Whatever sickness that had taken hold of him had done a number on him. Norman had aged, he was pale, and his once salon perfect hair was in a disarray. Steve would have thought him weak too until he met his eyes. The strength of his gaze revealed his unflinching determination that was the core of Oscorp’s business power. Norman may have been sick in body but he was no way weakened in his mind.
Once again, Steve did not understand what she meant. Why wouldn’t she want Tony to be gay? If he is a happy person that would be a good thing wouldn’t it? And what was a bisexual? Did he hear her correctly?
Below him, he heard his uncle get on the phone. By the tone of his voice, he knew he was speaking to Aunt Tasha. His aunt was busy calling together the rest of the Avengers together. They were all to go to the community floor to wait for his uncle and pops’ return…so Peter only had a small window to work with.
,” Bucky cursed. “Why didn't you say anything, punk?” He sighed heavily, rubbing his forehead, and demanded, “Tell me everything.”
What he did not account for, however, was the elevator dinging as it opened in the group’s path and Eddie Brock stepping out…
“Ughhhh,” the other moaned back. He scrunched his face as if to escape the new day by tightening his eyes.
The breath caught in Tony’s throat and he gasped, “Pull up the files from earlier! The ones on my teammates or adversaries!”
Tony was going to be sick. His son...Peter was being hurt right in front of him and he couldn't stop it.
Once he was out of earshot, Tony groaned and fell back into the couch. He murmured, “Goddamnit, I still can’t believe he jumped off the tower.
Steve, meanwhile, was pale. All the blood had leeched out of his face and he was staring at the hand Tony just touched like it had betrayed him.
But he did do a drive by.
“…What?” Bucky said, taken-aback.
Peter’s Spidey Sense suddenly flared and Happy slammed on the breaks, swearing loudly as the car whiplashed. Peter immediately stuck his fingers to the upholstery to keep inertia from throwing him forward. His parents, meanwhile, had no way to fight the force and were flung toward the front of the car. Steve grabbed Tony and wrapped himself around the more fragile man and muffled the impact with his body.
“It’s been a big day,” Steve agreed. It was crazy to think he woke up that morning, alone on a bus, wondering if Tony was still afflicted by palladium poisoning...It already felt like years ago.
When it connected, Logan stated, “Hey, we may have a problem…”
He did not want to let him go from the hug...and into the time stream.
Steve groaned, the sound shuddered deep within his throat and he pumped faster, imagining Tony frantically kissing him and desperately wanting to stroke Steve’s sex and make Steve come for him. Tony's hand would've been smaller but Steve had no problem imaging his hands as Tony’s. He pictured Tony’s face growing flush and he wondered what noises he would be making as he touched Steve and Steve touched him in return.
The familiar dark SUVs of SHIELD came tearing out of the trees and across the lawn. SHIELD agents jumped out and they surrounded them and started rounding up all their opponents.
Blondie glanced and Twitchy. Twitchy looked like he was going to be sick.
“Oh…” Bruce sighed sadly for him. They shared a silence as Bruce struggled to find words to comfort him. Eventually, Bruce lightly grasped his arm and asked, “You wanna go blow something up?”
“In your dreams,” Harry chided,
“Tony…” Steve began but then paused at a loss for words.
He just publically came out.
“Night!” Tony said, tossing his cards on top of Bucky's.
Steve shook his head and didn’t meet Tony’s eyes as he said, “I’m a man who’s just wandering right now…I lost – I lost my fiancé recently and…” He tried sticking as close to the truth for it to be believable but, as he said the words aloud, he was transported back into that moment: Tony on the ground, the hole in his chest, him gasping out final words of love, before –.
“Who’s the enemy?” Tony asked.
To be continued...Chapter 3: The Big Reveal (in more ways than one)
Tony’s mouth twitched into a smile and he murmured, “It was good. The director had a real artistic vision.”
He was in the process of lathering his hair when the father dropped off some clothes for him by the door and then Steve sped through the rest of his washing.
Thanks for reading! The next chapter will take a little longer to get out as I am taking a camping trip to Yosemite and going to Comic Con next week! So I'm going to be doing a lot of driving and am going to be pretty busy but I promise to post the next chapter as soon as possible! Once again, thanks for reading! :)
Tony went back to work with a small smile on his lips as he thought of the super soldier.
“Ahh-gah,” Peter garbled with a sharp gasp hunching into Wade. The sound went straight to Wade’s groin. How many more noises could he draw out of Peter?
“Hey, Tony,” Steve sighed.
He planted one last, deep kiss upon those lips and then pulled up slightly, his face hovering over Tony's.
“What’s up, Dad?” Peter replied.
“Welcome home, Dr. Banner and it is a pleasure to see you again, Master Rogers,” Jarvis said and the elevator began to rise.
“Just do what comes naturally,” Wade murmured, wrapping his arms around Peter’s neck. “Foreplay should be pretty similar and the fingering will just be in a different hole!”
He gasped, “W-who?” Code Silver meant one of the Avengers was in mortal danger or held hostage. Friday was not being forthcoming so Tony demanded, “It’s not Steve, is it?!”
Steve threw back his head with a heavy sigh then looked down to Tony with a small smile. He lifted his fists and whispered, “If Bucky dies in front of my son I am seriously going to reevaluate my decision about teaching you these moves
This time, Tony felt the jolt created by Thor’s arrival as it shook the entire room. He sat up sharply in his chair and looked wildly around him. It had felt like a small earthquake, and had rumbled the entire room like one would
“Sir, we found it.”
Peter jumped at Natasha, initiating their sparring.
Steve nodded unable to open his mouth without fear of vomiting. He’d never been so nervous going into battle. When he fought he, at least had some control of the outcome but, in this, he had no way to fight. He’d already done all he could by “faking” a relationship with Tony. Even with an honest to God relationship with the man did nothing to stem favor. Tony’s lawyers were the ones fighting in the trial and all Steve could do was sit beside them and wait.
!" :)
He was completely enamored with the super soldier.
Tony crawled into his embrace and Steve kissed the top of his head and Tony felt the first inkling of ease.
Crap.
“Hey,” Steve murmured gently. He grasped Tony’s shoulder and asked, “Is everything alright?”
Steve stepped forward and mediated, “But like Peter said, Wade is not Stane. We shouldn’t fight about this.” To Tony, Steve pointedly said, “We haven’t really even met Wade, Tony. The only times we’ve interacted with him was during or after fights, not on a personal level. We shouldn’t be so quick to judge. Let’s give him a chance.”
“Pops!” Peter called out, looking for him. Steve and Tony parted, exchanging one last chaste kiss.
Tony’s arms immediately wrapped around his head, pulling Steve in closer and tighter, like he was afraid to let go.
“Buc—,” Steve began but Bucky continued talking.
“This is it, isn’t it?” Tony gasped, his voice growing higher. He sat down next to Steve and nervously collected both of Steve’s hands into his.
Steve recognized the voice. He had pinned to hear it for days. Was it real? Was Tony really there? He looked beadily around for Tony but did not see him. It was another trick of the mind he surmised until he saw the figures running beneath him. Kilian’s men were in a frenzy. Some were falling to an unseen foe.
He recognized Tony’s light steps as he approached him. He paused by Steve’s side and wrapped an arm around his waist. They leaned into each other and Steve whispered what was on his mind, “How do we take down those three helicarriers before they kill us or any innocents?”
“Hello Auntie Tasha,” Peter copied him, smiled at her, still upside-down.
Once again I am doing two POVs! I'm starting off with Steve again and ending with Mary!
Tony sighed and tightened his hold on Steve’s hand. He whispered, “I survived.”
Wade flushed and awkwardly tapped her back, replying, “You’re welcome?”
mercenary would definitely draw attention.
His heart raced faster than it had when Hydra almost got him again and he almost collapsed from the resulting vertigo. He had held it back from the father in his retelling of the story, but the white lie festered within him and it felt wrong denying the man this last bit of critical information, especially with all he was sacrificing in order to get Steve to Tony.
Steve leaned over to Tony and whispered in his ear, “Do you know where Bucky is?”
Tony’s heart leapt into his throat and it remained lodged there as he lifted both his hands and pointed them at the Soldier. His repulsors whined loudly as he charged them as quickly as possible to full power.
“You also need to show that you stand by Steve in the rape accusation. Tell people Steve would never do it,” Pepper added.
Coulson represented SHIELD and the Captain probably was not pleased with SHIELD at the moment. But, it did not matter how Captain Rogers perceived him. His hero was broken and Coulson will help him heal. Affirming his mental status was only second to that. Coulson whispered, “Hello, Captain Rogers. I am Agent Coulson.”
It was quiet downstairs and, for one fearful moment Peter thought they hadn’t heard, but then Wade called out, “Who’s up there?”
“…Steve,” Tony whispered. Several miles away, Iron Man stopped flying and turned to him. He was only a speck in the sky but Steve could feel Tony’s eyes on him. Steve stopped where he was and stared back. “Steve, I mean it I love you. I have for years…I just never asked if you felt the same because I thought you were straight…Do you...?”
“If you hadn’t seen Steve in years…If you thought he was dead and suddenly he was just there…would you just stand aside and avoid him because you might get hurt? Even when you’re the only one who could help him?”
Peter did not want to talk to him and by the way Steve responded he knew he would not be seeing him anytime soon.
Had he not gone to the past, it would’ve taken him months, maybe even years to have noticed it. But, because he was forced to charge the suit so regularly, the poisoning must have been accelerated.
People love their tragic romances after all…
Steve looked from Bucky to his teammates and replied, “No…”
But he could not feed.
Tony’s stomach lurched at the sight and he remembered his friend vocalizing his fear of being experimented on.
“…What I want does not matter,” Bucky whispered, still adverting his eyes.
Bucky got up and groaned, “I’ll help the punk function…”
“Yes, Master Rogers,” the AI replied and the hologram over Tony’s workstation reappeared. Instead of Mary’s image it played back the grainy image of Venom stopping the mugger.
“Yes, thank you,” Steve said and the elevator doors closed and it began to move down without his asking.
He smiled warmly at her and she inserted her hands in the spaces between his arms and ribs before pressing her chest to his and wrapping her arms around him.
Tony was ridged in his hold for a second and then awkwardly returned the hug. Tony hummed, “Uhhh, you’re welcome? Really, Cap, it isn’t any problem. Like I said, easy-peasy.”
He paused randomly at one page and read a few lines and his excitement over the find spiked.
The memory of the sting had him jolting up in bed and he touched his bottom lip as the pain lingered.
Eddie clapped his back and the tiny tendril on Peter’s neck quickly slithered beneath his collar before either of them noticed it.
“No, I romanced you,” Steve countered. “For our first date, I can envision dancing involved.”
If they’d only met in his era…
Iron Man tilted its head in a slight nod and murmured, “Of course, Sir.”
Sam had texted: “Dude, is this real? When did this happen?” And had included a link.
Tony’s brows bunched together and he sighed, “Steve, you are…this is because…because of those laws, back then right? Before the big freeze? They’re not around anymore. You don’t have to worry-.” Tony reached for Steve’s hand but Steve knocked his hand back. He hit a little too hard and winced when he heard the metal of his suit crack from the impact.
Tony shot off Steve and Steve stood just as sharply. He remains of his shirt fell off him without his notice.
He had no possessions. He had no soulmate. He had no “brother.” He had no feelings.
Stark directed his repulsors at Norman and blasted him with both hands, burning his armored skin. Norman stumbled back and as he got his feet under him he dumbly watched Stark fly to Venom.
They entered the tent and Steve stood off to the side as Howard plowed forward and interrupted the Colonel in the middle of speaking with one of his subordinates. Phillips’ face soured as soon as his eyes landed on Howard and that sour look became more pinched as Howard began to talk.
Steve quirked an eyebrow and dryly supplied, “The jello?”
are an option.”
Tony spun around and smirked as his eyes fell on his lover. Steve was back in his bathrobe and was holding a second comforter.
“B-But they weren’t superheroes or spies!” She gasped.
Tony leaned in and flirted, “I
“Yah!” Peter exclaimed then asked, “Will dey have ice cweam?”
Steve slipped in and snapped the tent door closed when he saw Tony laying half naked in front of him. He tied it off tightly and he gasped, “This is stupid.”
Steve slowly pulled back his hand and whispered, “I had to, Tony. He’s the
He just couldn’t shake this feeling that something was off. The few times Tony met his eyes, he could tell something was wrong by the way he looked at him.
“Why is it so bad Uncle Bucky remembas you?” Peter asked Steve quietly, after the doors sealed behind Natasha.
“Where are we?” Steve gasped, looking around them, voicing Tony’s very thoughts.
Steve clutched Tony’s face at the first sign of life as Tony gasped for breath. His hazel eyes frantically looked around them until they settled on Steve. With his eyes boring into Steve’s, he gasped, “Please tell me you kissed me.”
Peter sighed heavily and dropped his head into his hands.
“No…” Steve whispered, slowly laying back down. He still appeared confused and explained to Tony, “It almost sounds like a commentator for a baseball ga –.”
Tony did just that. He got off his chair and joined Steve on his, partially sitting on his lap as he wound his arms around him. Steve wound his arms around his soulmate and pressed his face into Tony’s chest.
Steve was one of the few people she could actually call a good person and one out of a handful whom she could call friend. She didn’t want to shoulder another death that shouldn’t have happened but she already felt herself preparing for it.
She left with a nod. Once she was out of earshot Tony raise his hand for a high five and said, “I think Winterwidow Part Four went off beautifully.”
God had a plan for him and in a week’s time, he’d meet the person he would spend the rest of his life with…
“It’s reckless,” Steve murmured. “You can really hurt yourself…”
“Tony?” Steve gasped, cupping his face. His soulmate did not respond to his touch or voice. Steve felt like the world was falling around him.
He and Tony had only wanted to be together.
Natasha nodded and said, “There’s blood down there but I don’t know whose it is. It could be this guy’s, the Winter Soldier’s, or Steve’s.”
“And a granddaughter apparently…” Tony added dryly.
Till next time! :)
The man grinned madly and said, “Captain America, you would not believe how happy I am to see you here.”
It was Tony’s turn to flush as he imagined what Steve proposed and Tony murmured, “I can actually picture that. A dinner date on top of the Tower and then dancing in my lab.”
Steve would have loved to grow up in the era of wonder Tony described…and he would have been free to love Tony as well.
Steve's hold on Tony's hand tightened for a moment as the use of “beloved” made Steve's heart soar and then he lay his head on top of Tony's. Steve whispered more to himself than Tony, “Now, more than ever, I wish it was different…”
Bucky actually flushed and stepped away from Natasha to whisper in Tony’s ear, “When a fella has a pretty dame like that wanting some physical contact, he’s got to be gay or crazy to say no.”
Bucky’s eyes narrowed and said to her, “I only asked
“…And we would kinda like a blood sample,” Tony murmured. “To, you know, see that it really is you…”
Hill brought over chairs so they could all sit down as they began to discuss what to do about Pierce and Hydra. Tony automatically shifted his chair next to Steve’s and leaned into him. Steve wrapped his arm over his shoulder. Their public display of affection did not go unnoticed and the SHIELD agents all eyed them curiously but did not ask anything. Steve couldn’t help but wonder if they already knew about their affair and had known since they stared sleeping with each other.
Tony sighed and scratched the back of his head. He said, “Okay, with that outdated terminology, Pepper, this is Steve, Steve Rogers. And before you ask, yes,
“Uh oh,” Tony’s voice drew his eyes to the screen and the smile fell off Steve’s face.
America’s ass was still as fine as ever.
Tony slowly sat up and Steve moved with him, their eyes never breaking. Steve heart began to speedily race in his chest. Whatever Tony had in mind, he wanted it. He wanted it so bad.
Steve ran one of his hands through Tony’s hair and chuckled, “So do you.”
“You have a lot of SHIELD agents running around like a chicken with its head cut off,” she observed with a smirk.
But of all things to get him discovered…it really had to be his
Tony seemed to finally note Wade’s presence because, when he looked his way, he jumped slightly. Tony also hadn’t seen Wade since the time travel.
The reactor was a shell of its former self. Cable totally took it apart and the many pieces were strewn all over the table. So far, he fixed the shell. It was no longer crushed but back to its original shape and now he seemed to be fixing the internal pieces that had been crushed as well. It was encouraging to see but Steve wouldn’t feel too optimistic until it was totally fixed and back where Tony could use it.
“But you’re remembering,” Peter stated.
He willed and prayed for his body to heal faster. Fear flowed through his blood like icy cold. Tony did not have a suit. How was he faring against Kilian?
Tony was still concerned for him but still felt a little happier by the fact that Steve was clearly heading straight to him. He also found it hilarious that his stubbornness in getting to Tony was foiling SHIELD at every turn.
Cable’s eyes snapped to Steve and then he stomped over to him and then roughly hauled him to his feet. Cable hissed, “Lieutenant Rhodes will be here soon to wake him. We need to move Stark downstairs and set it up so he’ll think he dreamed it all.”
Steve pressed his face into Tony’s hair and let himself finally shed some tears over his own death.
He trusted his friends, especially the ones Pepper had picked. They were close with Peter and good people…but what if there was another Mac among them? What if someone takes their photo and posts it online? What if they do so by mistake? How long would they be able to keep it a secret? How many people was he going to have to lie to? How long can he and Wade be happy without their relationship being dissected by total strangers?
I’m starting to remember I loved others, Steve. You are one of the big ones but you were
! Is that you? Are you alright?” Peggy jumped in.
The Red Skull took off his belt and Steve tensed, readying himself for more pain. Steve expected him to hit him with it but Schmidt wrapped it around Steve’s upper left arm tightly. He locked it on his arm, cutting off the blood flow. His arm twinged with discomfort and his fingers prickled slightly from his blood being cut off.
“Hey,” Tony whined. He sat up and demanded, “Jarvis, where did my feed go?”
Steve kept busy with Bucky: setting up camp, preparing for Colonel Phillips, and rooting out information on the remaining Hydra agents in the area.
“Your suit legs are unsalvageable,” she sighed as she took in their clothes’ wrinkles. She took out her phone and sent out a text as she said, “I’m going to have to use the big guns on this one.”
Bucky's lips twitched into the semblance of a smile and then strode the rest of the way into the room and straight to Tony. He carefully embraced Tony and Steve overheard Tony murmur to Bucky, "As soon as I get my new arm in, we need to do an arm wrestling contest."
“Pete –,” Steve started to cajole.
Tony bit back his frustrated groan and he reiterated, “Who do you fight for?”
! Tony was only human! You’d have to be insane to ignore such a magnificent treasure!
Venom wildly hit Mary as she approached him but she used her manufactured strength to surge through the tide of tendrils and sat by Steve’s side. She reached out and grasped his hand and he held it tightly.
And it might’ve just cost him his life.
“Unquestionably,” Wade retorted.
Steve was unable to finish the thought as the darkness swallowed them and tore them apart.
Peter’s grip on him was steadfast and he pulled Wade after him. Wade followed diligently and shot Happy a sympathetic look as he passed the scowling man. His eyes immediately returned to the back of Peter’s head and he worried for the younger man. What was going through his mind? How was he handling all of this? Wade wanted to ask him but he was also afraid of upsetting his boyfriend further…
It broke his heart to merely imagine it, he could not envision going on without his son.
With everything he’d seen, the time machine, the Iron Man suit, the arc reactor…the only thing he wanted to know about was what had happened between him and Tony to make his son barely tolerate his presence.
Peter tilted his head up and whispered to Wade alone, “I love you.”
A bright red blush blossomed across Steve’s cheeks and he mumbled, “I…Tony, I – I like you in…in more than just a friend way.” Steve's face got impossibly redder and he continued, “You're probably the first man I've actually felt this way about. Before, I lived my life believing it was impossible…” Steve finally was able to meet his eyes though his face was rather quite red, he continued, “You made it possible and…even though ‘
Tony kissed the corner of Steve’s mouth and murmured, “I gave you chocolate for Valentine’s Day but I don’t think I have ever given you flowers.”
But mostly he sounded like he was breaking.
Instead, it felt like the worry was evolving into a cluster of twisting snakes in his belly.
Wade twirled his gun in his fingers and then tossed it down on the pillow. He then flopped onto Peter’s back, using Peter’s body as his form of modesty. Peter glanced back at him and Wade grinned happily at him. He leaned back into Wade, using him for support like a chairback.
“A son is a glorious gift!” Thor informed him as he placed him back on the ground.
“We decided we are not going to wait long,” Tony said.
?” She asked in English with a yawn. “
– to make sure someone was going to be there to see us. I was so positive someone was going to be there…I’m sorry, Steve.”
Peter rubbed his eyes furiously but, nope, he couldn’t get the image of his father and Steve, both half naked and rubbing against each other, with Steve’s hand in Tony’s pants.
Tony’s heart crumbled for the man but he kept up his front and he promised, “I’ll attend the ceremony and throw you guys the most amazing reception ever.”
It turned to Tony, a second before impact, and shrieked defiantly at him. Yet when Tony turned his thrusters on the monster its shrieks of defiance quickly turned into shrieks of agony.
“I’m not so sure, I will look into it, but there may be some spiders with some advanced sensory perception similar to precognition,” Bruce murmured thoughtful. “I will need to conduct some research, of course…”
Schmidt’s other foot rose and slammed between Steve’s shoulder blades, pressing him deeper down onto the shoe. Schmidt murmured, “Like you mean it, Captain. You do want your soulmate to survive this, don’t you?”
Tony fired again before the soldier could get up and the Hydra agent flopped back down and didn’t move.
“That was the Han Dynasty vase,” Pepper whispered, her voice tight from shock.
They moved Steve to a new room and Tony went with him. He watched him as his head bobbed lightly as the bed was moved. As soon as they reached the new room, Tony sat down next to him and stubbornly continued his watch.
His comatose state came to an abrupt halt when the last of the oxygen was used up and his body had to wake him before he was ready or risk dying again.
Steve’s heart leapt into his throat and he leaned in closer. He gripped his hands tightly together and breathed shallowly to better listen. It was the truth but they had little evidence to back it other than his word. Marcel had to make this 100% plausible for the jury to believe him.
Peter fell asleep in his arms and Steve carefully laid him in his bed. He tucked his son in then quietly exited the room.
“Let’s hope so, sir,” Steve replied with a nod.
“He's only at 45 degrees? When do you think you’ll be able to warm him up more and wake him?” Bruce questioned as he stared at the reading.
Steve lightly touched his shield, still fastened to his belly. He did not want his identity known. He barely knew how to operate in the future. He could not imagine what it’d be like once they knew who he really was and that he’d survived all these years. He knew the first reaction to such a miracle would be to study him. Even when he was small, Steve strived to stay out of hospitals to be poked and prodded, and being bigger didn’t change that.
Steve smiled at his son and promised, “We’re safe here, Petey.”
That night, however, Steve found himself facing Tony in Tony’s bedroom, outside was sunset and the sky was red, shedding its blushing hue onto everything it touched, including themselves. Steve looked to the sunset and then back to his soulmate. Tony’s eyes were glittering like diamonds in the dying light and Steve was drawn to them like a beggar man.
Tony was torn…what was he to do? Join the fight? But who would he aid? What if the guys fighting Hydra were just as bad?
“Why doesn’t he remember?” Tony hissed, his own worry growing with every second.
Tony was bleeding badly and struggling to breathe. Steve wanted to be by his side and help him with his wounds but, as soon as he stopped fighting Bucky, he knew the Winter Soldier would attack.
“I have to find out about your life one way or another,” MJ retorted, leading them to an empty couch on the far side of the room.
“And I thought I was an only child,” Ultron retorted sarcastically. It raised its red gaze to Peter and stated, “It matters not…because, when I get my Vibranium , the only thing that survives my wrath will be metal. You, our father, and the rest of the Avengers will –.”
“Steve, if you don’t mind me asking, did you really crash the plane? There are theorists who say the government said you did it to make you out to be a martyr. Some think the plane simply crashed on its own.”
“Our luck sucks doesn’t it?” Tony ironically asked.
“Wow…I must be feeling deprived of love if I'm fantasizing like this,” Tony laughed to himself.
Peter’s muscles tightened a fraction at the mention of Venom but he forced himself to relax and replied, “Wade saved my life. It’s a fact and I would be happy to clear up any rumors that state otherwise.”
“Whoa, whoa, baby boy,” Wade gasped as he helped Peter to the ground, kneeling with him. Peter leaned heavily into his boyfriend. He clutched his chest, where the pain still lingered It was the only thing he could feel other than the pressure of Wade's hold. Despite all that was happening to his own body, but he payed more attention to his parents.
Gabe smirked and then said, "Frenchie wants to know if Tony here is a boring mechanic or a fun one."
Wade said, leaning into the doorframe.
Tony’s mind was racing at full throttle at the possibilities. More to himself, he said, “I could get something like that for Pete…”
Steve felt his mouth dry. Tony was thinking about them being together too? He gasped, “Really?”
“She’s fine. She with five agents and they’re about to arrest Obadiah,” Rhodey assured him, helping him sit up against the counter.
Ben asked, “Why haven’t you contacted May or I? We listed you and Richard as dead. Where have you been all these years?”
“They could be tracking it,” Bucky explained.
Steve laughed, instantly overjoyed with relief, and he teased, “Did you run into the fight recklessly again?”
“Savage,” Wade hissed comically under his breath. Despite it being a whisper, everyone heard it and Tony looked even more destroyed.
He stood back up, rubbing his head as he glared at her. He demanded, “
He took every offer for an interview for magazines, talk shows, and newspapers. He spoke at schools and toured museums. He soon was even accepting missions and created a friendship with his SHIELD liaisons, Natasha and Phil.
“Most I think,” Bucky murmured and slowly sat up. “I doubt Peter will try it again for a long time after that scolding.”
That was another thing. Peter was first attracted to Gwen because of her beauty and then fell in love with her personality. Peter was attracted to Wade for his personality but how would he feel about his features in the long run?
Bruce had come to pick them up in Tony’s Bentley.
Steve’s eyes focused on the camera and he whispered with yearning, “
The shooting continued and broke the remaining glass, forcing them all to duck to avoid being cut.
Steve spent most of the flight to Germany staring blankly out of the window of the quinjet. Natasha sat up front with the pilot and they lightly talked about their heading.
"What's wrong?"
Thor nodded and murmured, “Sleep well.”
“The next month,” Peter corrected, drawing a chuckle from both his parents and they smiled warmly down at him.
Tony made Peter a number of new toys, including a new Iron Man action figure to replace the one that had been lost to the wreckage of Air Force One.
“It’s even better in concert,” Tony said. He sat up and watched Steve slide out of bed. He walked naked across the room and Tony was instantly hypnotized by his ass.
“We’ll bring him. He might be the only thing that will stop them. Natasha loves him and Bucky-,” he let the statement hang in the air but he and the others knew Bucky loved Steve.
Tony shook his head with a smirk and then murmured to Steve, “I cannot believe we are doing this…”
“You know you love it,” Wade retorted as he leaned toward him making kissy faces. He expected Peter to playfully push him back but his baby boy leaned in and lightly kissed him.
Bucky‘s expression was blank as he ran his fingers through Steve’s hair. His blue eyes studied Steve as if searching for something. He leaned forward and chastely kissed Steve on the lips. Steve was about to murmur a protest but Bucky placed his fingers on his lips, silencing him.
Peter’s vision blurred.
He was the rest of his life.
Steve watched him run to Bruce’s side and gently wrapped his arm around their friend’s tense shoulders. Together, they walked out of the room and no one said a word until the doors closed behind them.
“He told me he loved me,” Steve whispered, staring straight ahead like Tony. From the corner of his eye he saw Tony twitch. Neither of them told the other that they loved each other. Steve loved him and he knew Tony cared for him deeply. Steve winced and dropped his head as he felt himself grow smaller. Tony did not say anything so Steve whispered, “He kissed me…and…and I — I kissed him…”
Tony scrambled off Steve and gasped, “We have to go after him! Why did he leave?? I told him to put Spidey on hold!”
Silence fell between them again, but it was calmer. Steve took comfort in his hold and the skies outside slowly cleared up.
they fucking did it, SHIELD would probably not survive.
The Commandos had lined up their tents together and already had a fire going. When Tony appeared, most of them cheered and Bucky announced, “Now the gang’s all here!”
Steve sighed to himself then settled down next to Tony. Tony automatically pulled himself into Steve and grumbled nonsense into his chest.
As Peter climbed up the side of a building and looked for someone to help, his eyes could not help but stray to the Avengers Tower. He could see cranes around it as it was being repaired. How was his family? And Pops – the last time Peter saw him was when he tried to rip Peter from Venom’s hold – he must have been
“Godfather is more of a religious role anyways,” Tony later told him. “I’m not religious but both you and Ben are. It fits.
“I’m sorry! I’m just extremely distracted by sexy, younger you and you’re not wearing a shirt. And Stark is wearing less! And Stark is hot too!! Your old pictures don’t do you guys justice! Did I come to a sexy alternative universe and not the past??”
Peter was happy. He could tell by the way he smiled and threw himself into his laughter. He loved seeing this side to his baby boy. He wanted to see such unbridled joy in him every day.
Peter squirmed madly when he recognized the bottle and then jumped on the bottle like he hadn’t eaten in a while.
Mary nodded and replied, “And you know who I am, too.”
With a serious expression, Bucky nodded.
Tony woke with a sharp gasp and grabbed the arm that was his pillow.
Wade rolled up his mask and pouted, “Once more.”
lives.”
Steve did not really wake up until he remembered why he was there and then all his emotional turmoil came crashing back into him. He fell back into the mattress and stared up at the ceiling. His tears had dried on his face and his cheeks were caked with the dried salty liquid. His throat was raw and his head hurt.
“You will be watching?” Steve guessed with a small smile and a constricted heart.
“And the fact that I am your soulmate?”
Tony jerked up and let out a bloodcurdling scream that would haunt Steve in the years to come.
“This seems too good to be real,” he whispered.
There was no sign of Bucky or Natasha upstairs, but it was very late so they most likely were already asleep.
He could not ask Tony for forgiveness but he selfishly needed it. He could not imagine being separated from him, even just for a day.
Steve grinned mischievously and sat on the lip of the tub and leaned against the wall. Tony did not notice him and continued to rub down his body, leaving behind a trail of suds on his skin. Steve inspected Tony’s torso looking for any damage. Tony said he was fine but he would also say that if he was hurt. When he was sure he was uninjured, Steve leaned back and enjoyed the view. Tony’s newly cleaned skin gleamed under the bright lights of the bathroom and made his muscles stand out in higher contrast. He could not help but he aroused by his boyfriend’s naked body and started to grow hard.
Even Friday didn’t notice and the AI was always watching. Venom was probably disguising itself just as it had disguised itself as his shirt.
He pulled the trigger.
Wade shook his head and murmured, “How did you fall in love with this mess?”
Wade returned with gusto and they helped each other out of their remaining clothing.
“I have Jarvis hacking into all the cameras in a ten block radius, looking for any sign of known criminals or someone with a weapon. We’re going to get this guy!” Tony informed the others.
His wristband began to beep and Steve stumbled to his feet, swaying on his damaged legs. His shield would be there any second. He just hoped he would get it in time. Behind him, Tony did as he instructed and ran away with Peter, his son’s cries pierced his heart but hardened his resolve.
“No,” Steve gasped aloud to the symbiote. He clutched his head and gasped, “Just give me more time! Let me find the food,
With that thought, Tony’s heart felt like someone had stabbed it and twisted the blade in his chest.
Also life is demanding more attention so I may not be able to get this out on a weekly basis. I will try though! But don't be surprised if you don't get an update within a week! I am still writing! It's just going to be more time! I won't leave you guys hanging!
Jacques held up a lantern and positioned it above Tony.
After another all-nighter, he returned to the dreamworld with a new reactor and a large smile that had been absent from his face for many weeks.
Someone knocked on their door before either of them had a chance to use any tongue. Tony groaned with frustration as Steve sat up sharply.
They pushed through the doors and into the lab where the chair was and then jolted to a stop as Natasha's worst fears were confirmed.
Tony broke the quiet as he hoarsely whispered, “We missed Father’s Day.”
Even though it was years later, some nights Bruce woke screaming out in terror from what he had inadvertently done. Bruce inwardly sighed and reached out to lightly touch Peter’s head. Peter will now share similar nights and Bruce was powerless to stop it. All he could do was the same as Tony currently was, offering a shoulder to cry on when it became too much. The poor boy…He had a hard life ahead of him.
“He’s not the bloodthirsty assassin all those missives made him out to be,” Pepper countered.
The Chameleon had gone into hiding but Norman quickly contacted him through the usual channels and learned that the robot was not with him.
SHIELD HQ was being evacuated. Agents came forward to see if they wanted additional assistance and, in the same breath, told them where to find the attackers. Steve asked them to get to safety but thanked them for volunteering. Before the proud agents could counter he suggested they help in getting everyone out and make sure the perimeter was secure.
Eventually, his friend came undone in his arms by their kisses and thrusts alone. Steve shuddered against him and came with a gasping moan. Tony pulled back with a pleased smirk as Steve slowly resurfaced. Glassy blue eyes focused on Tony and his blush returned.
“Mmmm,” Tony hummed, lightly running his fingers down Steve’s smooth back. “Sounds like a very good future to me.”
Happy jumped into the front seat without another word and drove off. Peter sighed heavily.
Steve’s heart rate picked up. He placed his phone on a nearby counter and his hands instantly rose to his hair, brushing it back, trying to fix it. He then ran his over his shirt, to destroy any unseen wrinkles.
Once they finally were out of the main hall and cleared away from the majority of the mass that had exited it, Peter turned to Wade and said, “I’ve got a scheduled appointment right now to annihilate Hawkeye at pool…Would you like to join me?”
Steve swam over to him, his muscles flexed with power and unyielding promise. His eyes were focused on him and were determined. His gaze sent a shuddering pulse of desire through Tony.
, I think we need visit SHIELD HQ.”
Steve grinned and grasped his hand as he whispered, “I love you too.”
Tony nodded and took in a deep breath and pulled away stating, “We brought your uniform. Clint should have it.”
Tony nodded and said, “Alright, let me get dressed. I don’t want to let them think you and Peter are running around with crazy people!”
The side-yard was an outside walkway that was squeezed between the house and the wall that separated them from the outside world. It was where they kept the trash stored as the side door to the kitchen led out there. Tony barged through that side door and slammed the door behind him.
“He reminded me I left my oven on, now, if you’ll excuse me…” Tony turned on Sneaky’s stealth capabilities and seemingly vanished in front of the agents. He was about to step away, but he turned back to the agents and said, “By the way, if the priest isn’t being placed under arrest you should let him go. It’d be even more bad publicity for SHIELD if the public found out you were mistreating one of the clergy like that…Especially if it isn’t done within the hour. Goodnight!”
“...This is the worst of it right now, Peter,” Pepper consoled, her hand moved from his arm to his back and rubbed comforting circles there. “It will die down eventually.”
Tony flushed too and rubbed his lower face. His eyes darted from the bathrobe to Steve’s face repeatedly before he spoke.
“You’re amazing, Tony,” Steve stated as a tiny robot rolled around Steve.
And despite the decades that had passed for Tony, his father recognized him instantly too.
Marston’s jaw dropped a second time and the audience went insane. Steve did not think they could get any louder until Tony leaned in and kissed him. The kiss was chaste and lasted maybe a dozen seconds but Steve’s heartrate had never before escalated so quickly. His ears began to ring from the shrill, excited screams.
Steve dropped the paper and didn’t hear the employee curse him out as he sprinted out of the store.
,” Tony gasped, his eyes focusing on his son.
“Try to sleep, beloved,” Tony whispered as he closed his eyes, already feeling pulled to sleep by Steve’s near encompassing presence.
Steve spun around to another magnificent sight: a flying, robotic man.
Tony sat up and asked, “J, where is Steve?”
Steve heard the teasing timber of Natasha's voice in the background and felt tears come to his eyes again.
“Let him swing around,” Steve murmured into his shoulder, lightly kissing his flesh.
His screens flickered on and Jarvis stated, “Sir, you are grievously unwell. You require immediate hospitalization.”
Sadly, they could not stay locked away in Tony’s apartment forever.
Peter had inherited his mother’s thick, brown hair, her thin form, and her wide smile. From Steve he inherited Steve’s sky blue eyes, his square chin, and all the characteristics that made him a super soldier: his strength, speed, and fast healing. From Hydra, the cause of Peter’s birth, he had inherited gamma-radiated Spider DNA and with it the ability to stick to walls and a precognitive sense that warned him of danger.
precinct search the collapsed building in their district.”
“Who's your dad?” Steve inquired, wondering who had photos of him like that.
Coulson wanted to reach out and pat his shoulder but he knew the action would be unwanted. Coulson sighed and stated, “Captain, I swear to you, I will bring you proof that Stark is alive as soon as I can...”
“He’s sleeping,” Steve cautioned.
She did, albeit slowly, and she asked, “What is it?”
Steve flushed and embarrassedly glanced at Bruce who was openly staring at both of them with his mouth slightly agape.
“’Out of the mouth of babes,’” Tony quoted.
“Ooooh tactics and strategies, how sexy,” Tony purred.
“Harry will never forgive you,” Steve teased. He rested against the counter next to Tony and leaned into his side. They both watched the boys chase the robot around for a moment. Peter projected annoyance in his voice but his face portrayed his true feelings of excitement.
Peter twisted in his hold and also looked at the clock. He stared at it for a moment and then whispered, “Wow…I’m exhausted…”
? You had more holes than a Goddamn sponge!”
Another minute passed and then Wade replied: ‘You just made me smile so sweetly that I could have given you cavities so I had to punch something to feel like a man again instead of gingivitis.’
“What do you mean?” Steve asked, perplexed.
“Th-Then yes,” Steve gasped. The words were heavy and hard to push after so many years of rebuffing them. Yet as the words came out, they would not stop. It felt amazing. He stated, “Yes, please…A dinner date. Yes, I want it.”
“Jarvis?” Tony weakly called out…but his AI was silent. Obadiah must’ve reboot the AI before entering the property. Tony hadn’t thought to restrict Obadiah’s clearance. He’d only been trying to prove Obadiah was in the wrong…and he certainly had all the proof now but…
Jarvis charged right after the man and Howard half expected him to chase him down. Instead, he slammed the door closed behind him and bolted it shut.
Tony woke with a groan. They had fallen asleep on the floor of his lab and his entire body felt stiff and achy. Tony sat up, moaning pitifully as his entire body protested.
Natasha continued to glare at him, but, after a minute, she stepped back with a satisfied smirk and nodded to him.
Her kiss made him want for a life more than that of a machine.
When Tony eventually crawled out of bed, it was around noon. He found his husband in their shared office. Steve had a few holograms open before him and he didn’t look away from them as he greeted, “Good afternoon, sleepyhead.”
"Jarvis, how do I have a heart-to-heart with my son through a video message?"
The metal fingers dug deeper into Bucky’s scalp and he whined, “
The elder Howard flickered back to life. He was staring up at Iron Man with a serious gaze and he scratchily stated, “Tony, when you go out there, you need to remember one important thing about Hydra: when you cut off one head, two will always take its place. The first Cap ignored this…and we both very well know, because of this, he suffered a fate worse than death.”
They were getting nowhere on planning. It was Steve’s forte. Tony’s heart ached as he remembered his arguments with Steve on the importance of plans versus flying into the fray without one. He now saw how important it was to have, at least, some semblance of a plan…he would never risk his soulmate on a whim.
“Wakey time, Petey,” Steve murmured.
“…It’s human, Tony, don’t torture yourself,” Steve used his own words against him and spun them in accordance to this current situation almost perfectly. He continued, “Let me help.”
Tony shook his head, wiped his eyes, and wetly gasped, “She isn’t my soulmate anyways…”
Tony hadn’t done or said anything since. It was further proof that it meant nothing…Not that Steve wanted it to mean something. He had never been attracted to men before, not even Bucky and Bucky was one of the most handsome guys he knew.
Tony met his lips with a chuckle and they fell back onto the couch, smiling and kissing without a care in the world.
He did not believe Jarvis when he informed them Peter had been returned safely to the tower. When Steve saw him alive and unharmed in Bucky’s arms, he could not help but shed a few tears of relief.
He solved it by listening to his music at full blast so all he could hear was the compositions and not his whiney thoughts.
Peggy shook her head and Tony lightly shook Steve’s hand as he pressed, “
Natasha strolled up to them and said, “Listen, I think there’s someone who could help us.”
“Yesterday, at exactly four th –,” Wade began but Peter elbowed him with a shush.
Tony worried over him but once he saw Peter had fallen back asleep, he relaxed and looked over his son. He was still extremely skinny but there was more meat on his bones since he last saw him. He also wore a hospital gown, similar to Tony’s, and had an IV in his arm supplying him with constant fluids. He did not seem to have any physical injuries but Tony knew the mental injuries alone would take years to heal…if they ever did.
Steve was tempted. He was very tempted.
too would have changed regardless. It just would have been in a different era!"
In retaliation, her mate slammed his head into hers and the world swam before her. He wrapped his hands around her throat and choked her. For a moment, her heart seized with fear as the air constricted in her throat but her training kicked in and she calmed down.
“Aw, I’m sorry, Petey,” Wade murmured. “I lost my own girl a while back. We were going to get married and everything…but…but, I know the feeling…” Wade tapped his chest with his fist and whispered, “It stays with you.”
His shield, gloves, and the top half of his uniform were still on the outskirts of camp, unnoticed by the others.
Peter…Peter may already love him.
Jarvis was even less informative as most of the cameras he hacked did not have good quality and it was nearly impossible to see the difference between a man and a dog nonetheless pick out Chewie from the hundreds of thousands who walked the streets daily.
Steve motioned to all the bags and said, “Is this really all for us? Do you need help with anything?”
“I have a shift scheduled for today,” Peter replied. “I missed yesterday and I don’t want to miss anymore. My lab is in the building so it's not like the press can hassle me.”
Thanks for the kudos, the bookmarks, the comments, and for reading!
“Of course, like I always say, stay as long as you want!” Steve replied. He handed the action figure to Ben and got to his feet.
Peter knew he was pushing his luck but he asked, “Can Wade come over tonight? He won’t come for dinner! It’s definitely too soon after the last one but…I just…” Peter flushed and murmured, “I’d like him to spend the night.” The muscles in Tony’s jaw flexed as he clenched his teeth so Peter added, “I can pick him up later,
Steve followed Tony to his car where his bodyguard, Happy, was waiting and rushed them in. The man then rounded the car, slid across the hood, and jumped in the driver’s seat before accelerating into traffic.
She pulled out a semi-automatic and then held it out to him. He stared at the offered gun speechless.
By the tone of his voice, Steve easily guessed, “Bucky is here…”
Tony continued, “Schmidt is doing all of this to humiliate Steve. He made him kiss his boot, he made him say things he did not want to say, he’s degrading him by…by hurting him.” Tony paused as the breath caught in his throat. He gulped to clear it and continued, “He could humiliate Steve more if the Red Skull had the possibility to do the same to me and Steve having no way to stop it…”
Steve glanced down at the “I Love LA” tank and then back to his once dead best friend.
He popped open the bottle and downed the pills dry. They wouldn’t go into effect immediately and, the way his heart was beating frantically, he doubted he’d be able to fall back asleep any time soon.
Tony rushed into the lift before the doors sealed and went down with him.
To Tony, Vision stated, “I cannot take you as well but the quinjet will arrive in an estimated 30 seconds.”
Tony had left the door to the bathroom open but the shower was behind the door so Steve could not see him. Yet his mind went wild and he imagined Tony under the water and all the grime slipping off his skin. Steve gulped, his throat suddenly dry and all his bravado gone. He silently walked across the room and paused at the threshold of the bathroom.
Without any warning, bullets shattered the windows to the caretaker’s shed and Steve dove to the ground. He covered himself the best he could with his shield and waited for an end to the onslaught.
Tony put his hand over the reactor and hesitated for only a second before turning the reactor and removing it from his chest. He placed it down on the counter and stepped away from it and sat down on a workbench, staring at the glowing object with trepidation.
No, Peter had been acting odd…
And Cap was frozen until recently so it made complete sense why he never registered onto SI Online. He was still learning the basics on how to work computers. He probably hadn’t known SI Online even existed.
Her soulmate attacked first this time and threw his blade at her heart. Natasha flinched back to dodge and her mate used the distraction to leap in and knock her off her feet. They fell to the ground together, with him on top of her. He pulled another knife out of his belt and brought it down to stab her in the throat. Using all of her strength, she pulled enough to the side that her mate’s blade skewered the cold ground only inches from her flesh.
Wade lifted his head, grinning ecstatically at Peter.
“Just providing input, Sirs,” Happy replied.
“He’s back under Schmidt’s control,” she replied. “He ordered him to kill us.”
It felt like her words were tugging at his very heart. When had she attained such power over him?
Tony’s stomach turned as he remembered his last moments with Peter before the dusting.
“Nothing like Project One,” Bucky murmured dryly.
He held Peter up and got a good look at him. Peter jutted his lip out and his face scrunched up with frustration. He had the same hazel eyes and dark brown hair and…his face, even though he was so young, there was no denying it. It was his future son…no, not future, it was the present day and he was holding the same boy he and Tony were going to adopt.
Even a demon from Hell could not destroy the friendship he had with Harry. Their bond was eternal and could withstand anything.
“Are-Are…Is this really happening? Because I-I will be sorely disappointed if this a dream,” Tony stammered. “I mean w-wow. Hi. Why’d I say hi? Look at you…You look good wet and practically naked – hem – I mean, are you? A-Are you wearing anything – uh – under that clothing—there—the robe…on you?”
“He’s going to be fine,” Steve stated before she could finish the thought. “If Howard can’t find a solution then Tony will go back to the future and get help there.” He repeated with more vigor, “He’s going to be fine.”
He followed Natasha back to regroup with the others. The Avengers were mobilizing for a fight but paused when they appeared. Most of their eyes fell on him.
Why did he do that?
To Tony’s absolute delight, Steve pounced on him and Tony wound his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed him with as much fervor as Steve did.
Either way, he awkwardly raised his hand to wave goodbye to him. And as he wondered whether it was in good manners to wave to someone flying away or not, the arm of the lab coat he had borrow dropped and exposed his lower arm. In the panic to escape, Steve hadn’t thought to look at his soul implant.
“The shield was lost with Captain America over seventy years ago,” Coulson stated.
why hasn’t she said anything!”
Wade had hunched over, clutching his head and Steve bent down with him, trying to help. Tony turned away and looked back to his son’s image. As he looked at Peter, he felt like he was standing on the edge of a cliff. His toes were already over the edge and he was just barely supported on his heels.
However, unlike last time, the mass did not return to the beaker.
There was someone sobbing nearby over a prone body and it made Steve’s apprehension grow.
Tony stumbled after him, gasping, “You want me to woo you again, don’t you? Admit it, you romantic dork!”
He didn’t factor in the fact that there was a reason this assassin was so renowned.
Steve released a breath of relief and said, “Thank you, Tony. Hopefully my ‘old friend’ is just someone they’ve made up to get me specifically to go through this door.”
“…Hammurabi’s Code?” Norman recognized the archaic law.
The Soldier shook his head but did not discourage her efforts. Who knew, maybe she’d actually get it one day…
Tony thoughts came to an immediate thought when Jarvis continued, “It is Master Rogers, Sir. Dr. Banner believes that Venom would choose him as a host over Master Parker if he were more willing. He believes their DNA is similar enough that Venom could survive off him as well, seeing how the smaller pieces of the symbiote survived off him for that short time period. He told Master Rogers this and Master Rogers expressed willingness to do this. Ultimately, Master Parker would be free from Venom, however, Master Rogers will be trapped.”
“The one holding the gun to my head said ‘Hail Hydra’ before he tried to kill me,” Tony murmured. Steve paled and cupped Tony’s jaw with one hand and ran his hand over his forehead, looking for injury.
It was like they were racing time.
“Will you let him go free once you are satisfied he is mentally stable?” Stark demanded.
Peter was sleeping when he was suddenly violently awoken by his father’s voice, yelling, “PETER!”
“Good afternoon to you too,” Bucky grumbled. He looked like he was in the middle of eating a sandwich but stopped to properly glare at Tony. Tony shot the man a wily grin and went straight to the coffee pot.
Steve leaned back and asked, “How are we going to let the secret slip?”
There was no questioning the glistening in Wade’s eyes were tears. His eyes looked like they were on the verge of over spilling, especially when his eyes crinkled from his resulting smile. He whispered, “Aw, Petey…you know how to make a guy feel like a million bucks.”
“We do not have a relationship like that, Tony,” Steve whispered, stepping back. Tony moved with him, never letting any distance come between them.
Tony exchanged incredulous glances with Steve.
“2009 last I checked,” the man grumbled, sounding annoyed by Steve supposedly inane question.
Peter stepped back from the photo and let himself fall back onto his bed. After he landed, he kicked off his shoes then did the same with his jeans (there was something nasty on the bottom left cuff which he did not want in the bed).
Iron Man floated several feet above the ground and had his arm pointed at the door with a small gun sticking out of it. Tony slowly lowered his arm and the gun sealed away into the armor like it was never there. Iron Man floated to the ground and Tony’s face shield popped open. His husband’s mouth hung slack with shock and his eyes were wide and glistened as disbelief and hope warred within his gaze.
