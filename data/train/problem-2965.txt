He has finished the apple by the time he gets to the motel. He wipes his hands on his clothes, looks at his reflection on the window of a car and deems himself presentable enough. With a quick sniff at his clothes he thinks he doesn’t smell too bad. He hopes he is not going to be thrown out without getting a chance to talk.
He finds the main road again, and follows it trying to hitchhike a ride. It takes a long time before anyone drives by, and even longer before anyone stops. When they do, they only take him 2 miles before they reach their destination. It still helps, and Castiel still smiles and thanks them for their help.
“Fine, we’ll make a release form and a liability waiver and whatever other legal mumbo-jumbo we can find to make this not our problem. But Muriel here will have to be interrogated.”
The entire interaction is quiet, some grunts and moans, mostly on her part, and the sound of flesh slapping against flesh. She screams and clenches and Castiel feels his own orgasm rolling in. It is unsatisfying to say the least. The woman gets off him with a "thanks, love", and leaves. Castiel feels forlorn and lost, he feels worse than ever. The sex had been hollow, devoid of meaning and connection. And, above all, devoid of feeling. Castiel decides then that he will forget about sex. Masturbation would have to do to keep his needs in check, and only behind locked doors.
He watches Cas’s attempts to clean himself with a washcloth while spilling water everywhere and leaving dirty footprints as he moves around. He doesn’t know why he simply doesn’t shower. Or takes a long soaking bath. But looking won’t make Cas move faster, or heal his wounds, or make sure he is all right. Leaning on the door frame, he makes his presence known. "You should shower, you know? It will be much faster."
“Sir, step away from the vehicle, hands where I can see them.” The officers had arrived, and had their firearms drawn. Show time, Dean though putting on his best smile, his less aggressive expression and hoping it would be enough to fool them.
He keeps with the light kisses, switching to the other side of the neck, but letting his tongue come out more often. When he reaches the jawline he starts biting, and then sucking on the worried skin, leaving his mark. Cas starts breathing a bit harder, so Dean knows he is finally getting the appeal. As he makes his way back down the neck, Dean abandons the light kisses in favor of open-mouth, wet and dirty ones, with a few bites here and there, and exhaling into the wet skin, with hot breaths that leave Cas trembling and moaning.
Dean chuckles, and is amazed, not only at Cas making jokes, but making jokes about his mortality. And that's when it finally hits him. Cas is human. Actually human. Naked, bruised, bleeding and fully aware that a simple thing like taking a bath is filled with enough risks to kill him. And he is okay with that. The last hang-up that Dean had about him and Cas, the one that he didn't even realize was there, suddenly is not valid anymore. Because now they are equals, both human, both mortal, with no power imbalance. With no fear of angering a mythical being, a being that can smite him or punch him like he was nothing. With no guilt of having all that power at his disposal, by just asking, by just twisting the truth a tiny bit. It's a new path opened to him, with a possibility of an almost normal life.
Cas wakes once they arrive at the bunker, and Dean had made sure the short drive was extended as long as he could, to give him time to rest. But it had been as slow as he could actually drive.
"There would be no shame in that. We’ll have other opportunities to go slow." There is a question implied, even if Cas hasn't phrased it as one.
So they were following up on angel stories - although Castiel has no idea if they are having any luck or not. But he chooses to believe that it is a sign there are still angels around, and despite all, it brings a little warmth to his heart. "I know them, yes. They follow up on… strange occurrences." He had no idea what kind of story they had told this guy, but that was the gist of what Sam and Dean did everywhere they went.
Dean chuckles but he is happy to comply. He starts with the hands, kissing the palms, softly, lightly, as he moves up to the wrist. There he starts licking again, and biting. He moves up the forearm, kissing and bringing his own hands to it, stroking and grabbing along the arm, rubbing his fingers along the bite marks. Once he reaches the sleeve hem, he stops and looks at Cas, who has his eyes closed, and is obviously enjoying himself. But he has to check, because this is sudden, and unexpected. "Are you sure you are okay with this?"
Dean freezes in the spot, looking surprised. He stays still for one, two, three heartbeats and Castiel starts to think he broke him. Finally, Dean appears to have processed what Castiel has said, but still can't make a proper comeback and just stands there going through whatever it is he is thinking about saying, his entire internal monologue showing on his face.
In the kitchen he finds Sam, running clothes on, sweaty, drinking water as if he had run a marathon. Which would probably be close to the truth, knowing his brother
"That’s what I was saying, I couldn’t find it. I swear I put it in the office, with the rest of the business cards people always leave, but it isn’t there. But there is a number on their check-in form. I shouldn’t give it to you, but I mean, they gave us a card for contact, so there shouldn’t be a problem. As long as you don’t tell my boss. And you say you know them, right?"
In the end they never made it to the bunker. Dean bought a cell phone, and gave it plus whatever money he had to the angel. Muriel would live his own life, provided he didn’t start hurting people again. And when or if Dean ever found a way to get him back to Heaven he would get him there. Also, if Muriel heard from Castiel he was to contact Dean immediately.
"A hunt? What kind of hunt?” Sam's voice is hoarse and slow, like he just had woken up. He probably had.
The second angel they found turned out to be a baby. Much like when Anna had fallen, a couple that had been unable to conceive for years found themselves expecting. They left the couple alone, and marked the place where the grace had landed.
"Now, Sam!" He screams but Sam is already on it, stabbing the angel on the chest. He lights up, which they had doubts if it would happen. But if the angel had been graceless a stab is a stab is a stab.
"No, my friends are, though." Castiel figures that saying he’s from Heaven won’t do, so he decides to borrow one last thing from Jimmy. "I’m from Illinois."
After two weeks of this Dean was getting stir crazy. He had to make sure Sam was eating. He had to make sure Kevin was eating and taking breaks and actually sleeping. He had to force Crowley to take a shower when the stink became unbearable. He had to get out of there, and a grocery run was the perfect excuse.
They try to pin him down, but angels are a force of nature. Maybe they could have tried the banishment sigil, but with heaven closed they have no idea if it will work. And it doesn't seem the time for experiments.
“This is going to be like dad all over again, isn’t it? Traipsing through the country looking for clues and cold trails…” Sam mutters.
I've realized I have really no plan for this (*sorry*) - all I had was the idea for the first chapter and a probable get together scene. So, yeah, making it up as I go. But should be done in 2 (or 3 chapters) more chapters.
"You don’t have to. If you’d rather stay here trying to find something about the angels. It’s not a job. It’s just Cas."
"That’s great news," Sam says, standing up. And Dean sees the happiness in his face. On Charlie’s and Kevin’s too. All seems right at that moment, his family is getting back together. "I’m coming with you."
But soon Cas is complaining about cold water, and stepping out of the tub, into the unfolded towel that Dean holds. It's been a while since he has done that, engulf someone in a giant towel. He used to that to Sam when he was small and not the giant he turned out to be. It used to end in a mock fight. Before Sam knew about hunting he used to pretend he was a ghost, but that had been a short lived game.
"Do you know them? They were a weird pair, asking strange questions around town, ‘bout miracles and new people here."
"I suppose. But it wasn't just that, Dean. There was clearly something working against me getting here."
“Crowley? Half-human depressed Crowley that has been moping around the bunker? That Crowley? The one that has said a grand total of one word since we got him there and that word was
Dean wakes up to noises in the bunker and at first he is disoriented because the door is on the wrong side and something is trapping his arm. He looks down to figure out what it is only to find Cas fast asleep, snoring lightly. He smiles, realizing he must have also fallen asleep sometime during last night.
"I know." Dean sits facing him, and takes his hands, forcing his attention in him. "Listen to me, Cas. There is nothing wrong with feeling lonely. Anyone who had to go through what you did would have felt lonely at some part of the way, if not the entire way. The fact that you are still sane is a testament to your strength. I mean, I'm not sure I would be able to do it. I hadn't been hunting alone for that long, when I had to get Sam - and I can make friends in any bar I walk into. Hell, I made friends in Purgatory. And look at me, I've been dragging the kid along with me all this time, just because I don't want to be alone. So, feeling lost, confused, even if there is no spell, it's normal."
Eventually he would have to bring it up, using all the words to make sure the message was understood. He would have to or he would go mad with not being able to kiss Cas. But for now he could go on a little longer. So he would let Cas sleep. And he would make him breakfast. And then he would teach him how to drive.
“I missed you so much, baby,” he says once he pulls away slightly, unsurprised to find tear streaks on Cas’ face as well.
He looked to the house behind him, where Daphne stood before the picture window, having watched the entire exchange.  She smiled sadly and nodded to him, a silent consent.  Draping the worn coat across his arm, he thumbed through the phone’s unfamiliar contacts until he found Dean’s name, devoid of anything but the one word.  He picked up after the first ring.
So, he dutifully swipes his debit card and makes a mental note to write the grocery bill on his hand. As much as he hates to admit it, it's necessary - unless he wants to forget it later when he balances their account after getting home. Did he forget to deposit that check from his brother?
As they pass the nurse's station, Louise, one of their favorites, waves a good night, purse tucked under her arm.  The three of them wave back and continue down the long hallway.
Castiel’s eyes scan the crowded bar for his roommate. Dean disappeared nearly fifteen minutes before, with the promise of shots sprinkled across his tight-lipped grin. And, of course, Castiel found himself waiting, barely able to mask his anticipation in front of their friends. He fears he’s being obvious, that each turn of his head holds a number count that only
right now.” And Castiel gets it. Dean doesn’t realize what he’s saying. So he goes for the less practiced, less familiar response in his arsenal. He kisses him, pulls Dean’s face up to his own, and gives it his all. Abandoning every scenario of how he thought this might go, he focuses, again, on the now. Dean’s muffled
was wrong.  The man – Dean – was only seeking his services.  Of course, this shouldn’t come as a surprise.  His gift was miraculous and he’d seen his fair share of clients since its discovery.  Daphne, unaware of the conflicting thoughts turning in her husband’s mind, invited Dean into their home while she fetched them all coffee.
“Stay here,” he tells Sam, holding a hand up when he starts to protest. If anything’s wrong, Dean’s sure as hell not bringing his brother into it. He doesn’t need to be getting fired on top of everything else.
In the small amount of time Emmanuel could recall, he had little knowledge of how quickly life can change.  He’d been with Daphne for several months and was content to remain so.  She was a kind-hearted, beautiful woman who saved him when he didn’t know he needed to be saved.  He thanked God every day for putting her in his life. Or, in his case, putting him in hers.  With that gratefulness and love aside, for the second time in a year, Emmanuel’s life changed with a single act.  The doorbell rang.
Dean bites his lip, thinking back to any of the more recent conversations he’s had with his college-student brother, and recalls a quick phone call from the night before. A phone call that may or may not have taken place during his and Charlie’s weekly Dr. Sexy stream session. “Right. What’s on the menu, monkey face? Unless you want to split the carrot sticks TJ tried to bribe me with in favor of grading his nonexistent homework?”
“What’s stupid?” Sam steps back into the room, an enormous bowl of fresh popcorn situated between his moose hands, and Dean groans outwardly. Sam’s a sucker for dogs; they’re watching the damn movie.
Dean closes his eyes and counts to ten. In Latin. If there’s ever a time when he feels like punching his
Christmas. Birthdays. Easter. New Year's. All of the special days they celebrate and observe couldn't hold a candle to this moment. This day. It's the best moment of his lifetime, second only to the birth of their children. Not only are they in the clear, they can finally start toward recovery.
"What's wrong? What is it? Do you need a nurse? Ellie just took over for Louise. I'll go get her," Castiel hooks a thumb over his shoulder and starts to turn when a pair of calloused hands grab his face.
“Cas,” is all he can say, all he can think. He knew Cas would be home in two months, had been holding onto that time with a vice-like grip because two months were only sixty days and sixty days he could manage. After waiting for so long, sixty days were a
The look on the man’s face, beneath the pure shock etched across his handsome features, could only be described as one of immense relief.  Confusion morphed into anger, which then slid into pain and settled on incredulity.  His mouth hung slightly open, his brow creased above the light green of his eyes.
" - and Xavier races ahead in the parking lot so quickly that Castiel feels his heart drop to his toe nails. Thankfully, the lot is fairly empty for a Friday night -all vehicles parked- and Xavier is spared from any of the horrible scenarios whizzing through his dad's head.
Straightening his shirt and smoothing his slacks as best as he can, Dean walks down the hall to Missouri Mosely’s office and completely, 100% does
Xavier looks between him and the wall of buttons above his head. After pressing "four" and getting a head shake in response, he presses the "five" button and backs against the wall.  Marie fusses when the doors open and they don't get off yet, but a second later, they're on Dean's floor, and all is good.
His brother stands, grabbing the beer bottles they’d thrown back throughout the film, and makes his way to the kitchen. Calling over his shoulder, Sam yells, “Thanks for the movie choice, Cas! Night, guys!”
Outside, Dean led him to a dark, vintage muscle car and opened the trunk.  “These are yours,” he said and handed over a tan, folded coat, a cellphone and a wallet.
"Can you come home tonight?" The question falls out of his mouth as soon as he pulls his lips away and he wishes it hadn't. This, this news? It's already more than enough. To get his hopes up for more, he's learned, is simple masochism.
"Stay with Daddy, Xavier," Castiel takes the boy's hand in his own and shifts Marie to his right hip. Room 562. Dean's room.
Castiel’s about to apologize, his usual reservations creeping back in, when Dean breaks out into another grin.
"I'm sorry we're so late, baby. I couldn't leave campus until after six, and then when I got to Sam's, Jess wouldn't let me leave without seeing Bryce run without help, and
"Dean?" He knocks on the door and hopes if his husband is throwing up, it's not loud enough to scare the kids.  "Babe, you okay?"  Castiel barely hears the answering "yeah" before plowing on with his train of thought.
Dean. Warm eyes and bowed legs, carved to perfection, culminating in a considerate being who cares about the organization of their groceries. After all they'd been through, he's got a mischievous grin to excuse away his sometimes high maintenance tendencies. And while his strength isn't what it used to be, Castiel is confident it'll return soon enough. It has to. They've gotten this far, and they'll keep pushing until they no longer have to.
And, like water, Castiel’s savoring evaporates at the thought of what Dean might want to share with him. Perhaps he’s decided to get back together with Lisa. Or maybe he got that waiter’s number, from the hotel’s restaurant. Gabriel kept
"Daddy's on the fifth floor, baby," Castiel reminds him as they step into the parting metal doors. "Can you show me number five?"  Thank you Sesame Street and the Count for teaching his four year old when he hasn't the time. Or energy. Maybe he'll write the company a letter.
Dean couldn’t have looked more perplexed if he tried - mulling over his answer, carefully choosing the words he thought she would want to hear. But then, at the last second, he seemed to change his mind.  “Yes.  He’s, he’s my best friend.  I’ve been looking for him for quite some time now.  And I can’t believe I found him.”  Dean rose from his seat on the couch and pulled out his cellphone.  After glancing at whatever was on the screen, he rolled his eyes and pocketed the thing. “Do you think, maybe, I could talk to Emmanuel alone, outside?”
"I'm not, I'm not, I'm not," comes the whispered reply. Finally, Castiel lets the tears spill over.  Despite his quivering lip, and the full awareness of his ugly, crying face, he kisses Dean for the first time in what seems an eternity. Really, it's been about a week, but time has long since ceased progressing as it should.
"No fucking way."  He clamps a hand over his mouth and blinks furiously as tears spring to his eyes. He'd been trying to limit the bad language as best as he could and even news like this wasn't worth having one of his kids repeat a certain choice word. Dean laughs and chokes a little, keeping a hand on the doorframe to steady himself.
If he had had any doubt as to the appearance of the man he dreamt of, standing before him was the physical manifestation.  Clad in the same jacket as last night and jeans that were stained in oil and dirt.  Spiked, dark blonde hair that looked like it had one too many hands run through it.  Probably out of nervous habit.
He places the stapler on a neighboring desk and surveys his work, eyeballing his phone and willing Cas to reply faster. He knows his plane got in that morning, and he knows they’ve agreed to wait until after the school day ends to surprise Dean, but this? This gift is bigger than he could have ever given his older brother. It almost feels criminal to keep it from him for any longer.
Dean’s on him in a flash, coffee and food forgotten. “Dude, what are you doing? You can’t just leave the room; these kids are Tasmanian Devils times a trillion.”
having to admit Cas was right – Dean jumps nearly three feet at the sound of the metal door creaking open above him.
“Missouri needs to see you, Dean,” Becky breathes out, clearly flustered. Her eyes are wide, wider than normal, and if Dean cared to ask if she was okay right now, he would. Instead, he files that observation away under the already bulging folder of Weird Things Becky Does and nods.
Sam waits until Dean leaves the classroom to text Cas. Well, okay, he waits until he’s done stapling the cute little papers Dean’s students made, but nonetheless he waits. He can’t believe his luck, if he’s being honest. When Cas had asked for his help with this little arrangement he nearly broke his phone from the excitement. Jess had to take the rest of the call because he could barely speak from the sentiment. And yeah, maybe there were a few tears, but a guy can be excited to see his brother-in-law, can’t he?
“Oh, you think that was for your birthday?” Dean hooks a thumb over his shoulder as they stroll back to the front of the bar, looking behind him in mock confusion. “I hate to break it to you, Cas, but the world doesn’t revolve around you. Your birthday was yesterday, dude.”
Dean lets go of his hand and stops walking. “You cheeky sonofabitch, using my own words against me.”
Inside, an upbeat Latin song is layered over something from the Top 40 and Castiel laughs at the absurdity of his thoughts having such a nonchalant backdrop.
Gabe entered the room again but this time didn’t raise the lights. Dean was straddling Cas, busy licking his way down Cas’s torso and encouraged by Cas to take his time.
Dean looks away meaningfully, dragging his eyes across the room and fixing them in the corner, fixing them on the wooden chest resting there.
Castiel finished the massage with the base of Dean’s feet, working the sore spots until he could feel them release under his fingers. Dean was placid like this, calm like he almost never got to be in normal life. With his job and the pressures he placed on himself, this was an indulgence he almost never got, or gave himself. Cas hopes to remedy that in time but until then, he worked at making the most of these hard fought moments, let Dean unwind for now and let it all go.
“Okay, first this.” Cas reaches under the bed and pulls out the straps permanently fastened there. He flips them first across Dean’s body, checking the length and positioning. He slides them under Dean. One under his ankles, one his hips, his waist, and the last under his shoulders.
“What can I say?” John chuckled, “After bringing Dean into my life, it’s put a lot of other things into a different perspective.”
“No. No, of course you don’t do that anymore. I don’t either. Shit man that place is really fucked up. I stopped going ages ago. I just wanted you to know how happy I am to see that you’re doing okay.” He pats Dean familiarly on the shoulder, smiling at him like they share a secret or something. Dean can’t help but flinch, pull back bodily, please don’t touch me, he wanted to beg. But instead he just pulls in on himself, unable to speak, unable to run, do anything.
“Charlie? Are you sure?” John tried to keep the disbelief out of his voice. Charlie was Neutral. She might know the correct information, but she had no practical experience with the sort of ‘Pure’ level protocols Castiel would be expected to abide by. Hell, almost no-one did, Pure dominants were just so rare. But that was the point he supposed, in that sense Charlie was as good as anyone.
They’re interrupted by the arrival of Cas and Jess as if called by magic (or maybe just the beeping of the oven).
One person just wasn’t capable of taking care of Dean throughout all of the estrus period. Luckily Gabe was a beta, perfect to assist as he was unaffected by their pheromones. He could keep a clear head and a steady hand when needed. His training as an Omega Nurse and history with Dean was also an essential part in making this a success. Dean needed to trust him intimately or it just wasn’t going to work.
“Dean, it’s me. We’re going to do this just like we practiced. I’m going to walk over to the bed and I want you to come with me.”
“Thank you,” Sam pushed the thick binder across the desk to him, “I know you probably won’t have time to read all this, but you might as well keep it. Some of it might be useful to you.”
“Yeah, the university sent their lawyer to go over the documents for me and they were pretty clear that to keep my job I had to sign it. There had been dozens of complaints and worried emails from students and staff. I guess they wanted to safeguard their investment.
Gabe swaps sides and has him finish off the second set of exercises and in under a minute they’re done, with Gabe wiping off his fingers on a towel and reaching for the dilators to give them a clean. He heads into the bathroom and Dean takes a moment to catch his breath.
Gabe nods, giving Cas time to climb up into the bed, to rest his hands on Dean's chest before he slips away.
He dragged over the spare IV stand that rests in the corner of the office. Dean sat gingerly on the sofa, readying himself for the process.
He woken up three weeks later, half-dead, but kept alive by machines and veins full of chemicals. Six weeks after that, once they’d pulled the tube out his throat and he could hold a sitting up position, they’d transferred to a Dynamic Treatment Centre. Later that day, Castiel would undergo a Dynamic Spectrum  Assessment and find out that had an FSDS of 19.89 and a ‘Pure Designation’, which placed him at extremely high risk for Dynamic Disfunction.
Dean groans at the touch, shifting his hips against the teasing strokes, weeks of denial winning out to rush through him with desire and need.
“Eight hours since initial symptoms. He was slightly feverish at 100.4F, taken ten minutes ago, but that is to be expected. At 6:30pm he managed two cans of nutritional supplement and has since had one glass of water, 300mls. He continues to pass all cognitive test questions and therefore initiation of the intervention phase may be delayed upon reassessment in an hour.”
“It’s me. You’re safe. I promise. You’re safe.” Cas repeats, hoping finally the words might get through.
Dean doesn’t reply, but instead snuggles down deeper into the blankets, getting comfortable. Cas takes this to mean he’s ready. He’s warmed the lube thankfully, so all Dean feels is the welcome intrusion of fingers making their way deep inside him. He bites back a little panting moan and tries unsuccessfully to think unsexy thoughts.
“Yeah, and this is just the first one.” Sam’s haggard look agreed, he knew exactly what Castiel must be thinking, “In the foster system, he was listed as a ‘problem child’, with many behavioural issues and minor run-ins with the law.  Nothing serious, just getting into fights, drunk and disorderly, stuff like that. But it got recorded against his name. After he spent a couple of years on the streets, he began taking odd jobs here and there, some of it was with the wrong people and the cops started to pay attention to him. That’s how we have some records of that time.
No one believed in him like Castiel did. His belief in Dean was rock solid, nothing could shake it. Time and time again, when Dean was struggling and needed reassurance Castiel was there, telling him, showing him just how precious he was. Of how much he was capable. Of what what he could take and stand up again, against it all.
Dean growls, angrily, swinging his weight against him in a desperate effort for contact. Words might be lost to him right now, but his intent is clear, and his pain.
He doesn’t always make Dean wait for his assistance, obviously it’s impossible while either of them is at work or when they’re separated for other reasons but when they are together the expectation is that Dean will ask, will wait for him. A sure fire sign that Dean wants (or needs) to go back on the catheter is not telling Castiel when he needs to go, or more problematically going before asking assistance.
This uncomfortable tube was as close as he got, it could be excused as medically necessary, as anything really but the mark of a Dominant Alpha who loved him. He just wished he was strong enough to do more.
It goes on like this for a while, Cas occasionally praising him and continuing to work him further and further along. But eventually Dean feels it, the nothing release, the slip of liquid out of his cock and the unfulfilled ache flowing away. He still wants to come but now it’s emotional instead of physical, he can feel it easing away. He smiles privately into the blankets, trust Cas to know just what to do.
“No, he...he was a mess. Worse than usual. I don’t think I saw him sober the whole time, he… he was just so angry you know.”
“Do you know how much I’ve wanted you too? I’ve not been able to have you...” his voice is deeper than usual, shaded in arousal. “Every morning, I would wake to your need. God! I wanted you so badly then and every night I would go to sleep knowing how much you wanted it.” he’s panting too, working himself so that Dean can see, his cock thick and ready.
Cas rests curled up in bed with Dean, till he can feel his breath even out with the heaviness of deep sleep. The sedatives will keep Dean under for several hours yet and the app on his tablet will allow him to monitor all his vital signs effectively.
Cas takes his own seat across from Dean, readying himself by taking a slow mouthful of coffee and considers how to start.
He pulls off Dean, walking quickly over the the chest and opens it. He eyes the contents critically and decides, in for a penny in for a pound. He reaches in, scoops out the lot.
He squinted at the CCTV feed, Cas was on top of Dean, all his weight pinning down the younger man. Only the smallest movement of Cas’s hips indicating that they were knotted. But Dean was staring up at nothing, eyes glazed over, unfocused.
Dean slept little, fitfully waking each time the slightest noise could be heard. Cas didn’t sleep well either, worry waring with frustration and easily overcoming his need for rest.
Cas liked CRP frames. He liked their function and simplicity. He liked that they provided submissives with a safe way to experience the intensity of complete immobility, while also allowing Doms with a safe restraint method through the quick release straps. They were expensive, but easy to maintain and very durable. Medically speaking they were also excellent at keeping the sub safe and calm them during necessary procedures (such as the insertion of a catheter, cannula or feeding tube etc).
“Dean. You were dreaming.It wasn’t real. Listen to me. You are in our apartment, it’s Monday the 21st of March and you are safe. You hear me? You’re safe.”
"There you go," Cas's smiling now, he can hear it in his voice. He's obviously noting the change in Dean already, "that's right, it's meant to feel good like that. You're being so good, love, enjoying it." And Dean is, enjoying it, relishing the stretch and thrust, he pants with it, wanting more and deeper. He groans, grinding his inner lips down on the smooth surface of the machine desperate for more traction, more pressure. Cas takes the hint and slips his fingers between Dean's legs, pressing and massaging his Omega glands, pleasure growing, wave after wave.
Cas is quick then, knowing he needs little prep, the hunger his his eyes burning Dean a little, he wants to look away but can’t, he’s trapped there and gasping with his own desire. It’s so immediate, he want Cas inside him now, now, now.
“You’re doing good, just two more.” Gabe reassured him, placing his free hand on Dean’s shoulder after sensing his unease.
Sam laughed, but it was bitter and short, “Oh, he definitely tried! He didn’t make it far that first night mind you. Barely made it out of the Mainhouse before Michael and the security team picked him up. But he played it off, said that he was out for a midnight stroll. We gave him the benefit of the doubt. By the third attempt, after he’d almost made it over the estate walls, we stopped believing his stories. By the fifth, they brought him back biting, kicking, and screaming. By the seventh attempt, after the cops in the next town over picked him up, we realised that this was deadly serious. Dean was utterly terrified of us and trying desperately to escape.”
But now that the room is built and they can do it at home, allow themselves that small luxury, if not complete privacy.
Soon enough they were settled in for the night and had retreated to their room to ready for bed, Cas led Dean away to their room and firmly shut the door.
Dean can't meet his eyes. Cas knows that mostly he can't ask, mostly he’ll just withdraw, pretend that everything is fine, until it really isn't.
“Sure thing.” Charlie turned back to Castiel, “Do you need anything before we go down to the clinic? Lunch?”
Dean moans a little as Castiel slides the metal prongs steadily inside him, he’s much too aroused now to not respond to the intrusion, canting his hips the small amount possible against the straps. But Cas shushes him, leaning forward to pull the hip and thigh straps tighter and prevent him from moving against the speculum.
The urge was still there, that horrible need to be filled, to be mated, wasn't even close to being sated. But at the same time he was lucid enough right now to hate the thing below him, inside him. He was angry, it was illogical and yet he couldn't stop resenting that it wasn't Castiel. Just some combination of plastic and metal drilling itself inside him.
He gave a last longing look at the coffee pot before grabbing his own keys and phone. He didn’t want to be late and knew that Charlie would be waiting for him in the studio.
“Did you also know that he did his training at Harvard in the Progressive School of Dynamics? That his treatment methods aren’t going to be anything like the ones used here?”
Dean groans audibly and relieved, more bruises added to Cas’s thighs, as he fights the urge to touch, to disobey.
“Just saying, I'm sure you're students appreciate the view!” There is no way Gabriel would ever even consider seriously coming on to Dean but the banter between them remained playful and Cas doesn’t seem to mind. Trusting them both entirely.
“Not a design I am completely happy with, but since it’s only for a few more days. I think it’ll do. If this works for us, we’ll get something custom made.” Cas is playing with the device, checking there are no rough edges or sharp spots, distracted for a moment. He reaches under the table and retrieving an ice pack and shaking it casually. And then Dean isn’t so sure for a moment, the ice looking mightily cold.
“You should have seen the day Dean was given his submissive designation, Dad flipped! The school brought in a Dynamic Assessor for all the kids that were missed in early childhood and Dean tested out Submissive on the 99th percentile. He was shaking all the way home, terrified of Dad finding out and of the meeting the school had wanted for the next d ay. But, they had already rung home, you know how they panic when a submissive streak that strong is identified. Anyway, by the time we got home Dad had already packed up our stuff and was waiting to leave. He ordered Dean not to tell anyone, ever.”
“Good. That’s it,” Cas used his other hand to wipe Dean’s hair back off his forehead, “You’re doing so well.”
Plus he loved when Castiel doted on him, loved it when he was the centre of Castiel’s entire focus, loved to get home from work and have him waiting there for him at home. He just wished that sometimes Castiel could demonstrate that he cared in some slightly less humiliating, physically intrusive ways and sometimes it hurt.
“Okay, first set.” He warns, before gently placing Den’s ankles against the leather, positioning them comfortably apart. He fastens the first of the ankle cuffs around Dean’s leg, checking the fit by sliding his fingers underneath it. They’re medical restrains, softly lined and designed especially for this but he doesn't want to take chances with them. The other follows easily.
Gabe nodded, meeting Cas’s gaze squarely, he knew how hard the request really was on both of them, how intimate this would be.
“Sam was there when I woke up. He’d flown down as soon as they called him. I’ve never seen him so scared.” Dean looks away, refusing to face the guilt he feels.
“Why didn’t you tell me before how hard this was for you? Why did you hide it?” the hurt and betrayal evident in his voice.
“Oh, Honey. I’m so sorry.” he pulls Dean closer, hoping to drown out the memory of their touch with his own more immediate presence.
In all the chaos of packing and sorting, he hadn’t had a moment spare to research the House itself. The only thing that he’d heard about Caladh House itself was that it was old and that it was powerful.
I started to fear that every word I spoke, every movement I made might give me away. I couldn’t talk to anyone without feeling like a fake, I wasn’t worthy of taking up their time, wasting their breath on me but I was so desperate for anything to make me feel something, I wanted it anyway. But it just made it worse. I wanted touch and affection so bad it almost killed me. But more than that I didn’t want them to find out that I really was.”
“Yeah, well where was I the next time he needed me? I’d fucked off with Jess, that’s what!” Cas can hear him swallowing raggedly in the background, obviously fighting off tears, the guilt Cas knew he held still for not being with Dean, even now. “Where was I when that Bastard came back?”
And Castiel is there, finally back where he belongs, back inside him, where he should have been the whole time.
He feels rather than sees the tears, Dean’s an expert at hiding his pain, but his cheek is damp where they’re pressed together. Cas knows better than to comment.
But, then something is placed over him, soothing away the cold and the pain, a warmed blanket he realizes. Cas kept them in a special cupboard for moments like this.
“Dean was raised by her? Outside of the Society?” Castiel was sure there was probably much more to the story, and he would investigate that later, but he needed to keep on topic.
He must have dozed a little himself because the next thing he knew Dean was moving in his arms, fighting against the hold he continued to maintain around him.
“Dean?” he asks hesitantly, seeing that he's roused “I know it'll hurt, but we’re going to have to talk about this eventually. I need to know what happened so I can keep you safe.”
“No, Dean. Look at me.” Cas waits, Dean does, fearful. Cas wants to reach back in time and punch John Winchester in the face, “I’m proud of you. It’ll come give it time.” Cas leans forward to plant a soft kiss on his lips.
Cas chuckles, drawing back the blanket to peek underneath. Before planting an indulgent kiss on Dean’s forehead.
Dean panted a little, refusing to give into it just yet, putting off the inevitable for as long as possible.
“It’s okay, I already know sweetheart,” Cas can only offer so much reassurance, so much comfort, but he can offer this. He’d worked it out immediately, once the truth was plain, but he wanted to be gentle about it now.
He pulls out one of the novels he'd packed, knowing he wouldn't make much progress with it but figuring it'd at least give him something to think about other than what's going on in the other room.
“I’m not sure I...” it’s getting harder for him to speak, nervousness stilling his voice, what if it’s too much?
And there it was. Cas knew it would come up eventually, the return of the infamous John Winchester, the man behind this whole mess. Because just like that, after years of nothing, like some ghost that refuses to stop haunting him, he showed up in Dean’s life again to destroy what he had built.
And Cas does, working his way up from the straps around his ankles, calves, thighs, hips, chest and neck. He even adds the wrist and upper arm cuffs for good measure before holding out the final one. It’s a little different from the others as it has a wide padded panel at the front for Dean’s forehead and an extra strap on each side to hold it on firmly. He’d added that after Dean had struggled and shifted too much once and marked himself. Although the leather was lined, it was still enough to abrade the skin lightly, and any mark was more than Castiel allowed. This modification Dean doesn’t really like, it feels heavy-handed and a little claustrophobic, he frequently requests it be left off. This time though, he doesn’t comment, he meets Cas’s eyes and holds perfectly still for him to fasten the straps securely on each side of his head.
Through a combination of mechanical and electronic components it could be adjusted into a wide variety of shapes and configurations. Dean’s body wasn’t forced to move with the frame, in fact the the slightest resistance halted it entirely, But while it gave support, it also restrained him and once in place held tight through a wide variety of straps and harnesses, Dean could be held open and immobile in almost any position. A small collection of machines sat waiting for Dean in the corner, each could be mounted to the frame in different configurations designed to work Dean through his relentless heat. A technician had been by yesterday to check them over so Gabe didn't need to.
“He actually responds really well to heavy restraints, especially the weighted or binding varieties, like secured weighted blankets, immobilisation on his CRP Frame and restraint-jackets. Compression-Restraint-Pressure Techniques and Deep Pressure Therapy sometimes work. It’s one of the only things, outside of sedation, that we’ve found to be effective at calming him down.”
“Okay,” he’s helped up, with Charlie on one side and Cas on the other, he’d plain forgotten she was even there in the panic. But right now he half walks, half hangs off them as they guide him to the car, gently easing him into the passenger seat.
Benny nods, accepting the advice easily, “That’s easily arranged. We have a House tailor who already has Dean's current measurements, he'd be happy to create whatever you need. Is there a specific garment design you have in mind?”
Gabe pulls one of the stools over and lowers it to the perfect height to watch both the mechanisms of the machine and Dean's reactions. He activates the first program, watching carefully as the first phallus raises up inside the machine through a mechanical opening and directly into Dean's vaginal passage. Dean gasps, but doesn't try to pull away, more shocked than anything else. Once the first is fully seated but not yet moving, the second is raised, the device's inner panels sliding open to allows the second phallus to ease itself into Dean's anal passage. This time Dean does shift, the sensation of both passages being filled somewhat difficult to accommodate. He lets out a shaky, slow breath, preparing himself for what he knows is coming.
Dean doesn’t complain. Cas’s kiss is intense and hungry. He uses his hands to hold Dean’s face, and he is not ashamed of using his tongue. Dean might have gone gentler for a first kiss, taking into consideration Cas past hangups about sex. He is glad Cas took the initiate though. He moves his hands to hold on to Cas, to make sure they can deepen the kiss, that none of them are going to stop. It does bring them closer together, and it’s surprising to feel Cas’s erection pressing against his. He gasps, for air and in surprise, but just for a moment, before he is pulling Cas down for another kiss.
On the grocery store the clerk had the TV on the news report. The unexplained meteor shower was still in the highlights, the scientific community was still baffled. He no longer paid attention to it. He was almost checking out when he realized that what the newscaster was reporting was very different. A man had been hit by one of the meteors and had gained superpowers, only he seemed to be out of his mind, and was harming people. Two towns over. Dean paid for the groceries, and called Sam while driving.
The first weeks after the fall they had barely left the bunker. Sam was recovering from the botched trial. Kevin was working himself into a frenzy with both tablets trying to find a way to send the angels back to heaven and closing both heaven and hell without anyone having to die. Crowley moped around, poked his nose where he shouldn't and ignored the Winchesters all together. They discovered that demon traps were still effective against him and started drawing them everywhere. Crowley no longer needed to be shackled and thrown in the dungeon and they didn't have to worry that he was going to run away. Mostly he sat around and read old magazines that he found. The oldest the better, it seemed.
Sam nods, while still drinking, managing to spill some all over the already wet clothes. Once he's done and has more or less dried his face on his shirt, he asks, "How is Cas?"
Dean knows all about physical relations, sex and pleasure. Love he keeps it at bay. Love is what always hurts him, and what makes him feel worthless. Love is reserved for family, which is the grand total of Sam, and the closest friends, which are mostly dead. And... No, he refuses to acknowledge that. Love is for family and close friends, and to be kept buried otherwise. He can do casual sex; he can do a casual fling too, even if lately he has chosen not to. He will not, however, put his heart out to be trod on.
"No, Dean. Drowning is no laughing matter," he deadpans. But there is a quirk to his lips that tells Dean otherwise.
John drops him at Burlington bus station, and since they made good time, with no hurdles, no setbacks whatsoever, Castiel decides to press his luck, and gets a ticket to the closest place to the bunker he can afford. He just hopes the luck will hold.
He never makes up his mind, though. Just sighs, picks up a tray Castiel hadn't noticed was in the desk by the door, and sits next to him, leaning on the headboard.
Dean chuckles. Despite all, he does like his brother, and knows he means well. And he supposes it's easy to spot how Dean feels about Cas. Maybe it's the lack of action that has Sam worried but there are reasons for that.
Cas blinks at the light, but he manages to get out of the car on his own. Sam and Dean help him down to the bunker. When they reach the reading room, Cas throws a hated look towards Crowley and nods to Kevin. Charlie waves, but Dean realizes they never met.
"Were you standing guard?" he asks when he realizes how fast Dean had come to his rescue. He doesn't think he had been screaming in his sleep to have woken him up. And if that had been the Cas he is sure Sam would be here as well.
His hand is on the doorknob when Cas speaks up, "Please stay. Keep me awake. It would be stupid for me to drown after all I just went through."
"No we can’t. The only lead we had has gone dry. Like I said, regroup and rethink." Dean has to be practical, and during the entire search for Cas he has to admit he has been anything but. "Charlie will probably have a way to hack into bus service servers or something and get the live feeds from stations or something. Maybe Crowley will give an input and tells us a spell to find people. I swear I don’t know why we haven’t killed him yet."
They are driving to Nebraska, checking another news report of strange lights and miracles. Dean hopes it's an angel willing to talk. Scratch that, he hopes it’s Cas. He tried praying, but he doesn’t even know if his prayers can reach him. He believes Cas is human, much like the other angels. He just hopes he hasn’t forgotten all about them again, that he hasn’t found a new wife, a new life.
"And how do you propose to do that? As for Cas, let him rest. We can then see what he wants to do." Secretly, Dean is happy Cas is human. He is happy he can finally distance his friend from the rest of the heavenly horde of douchebags. But he remembers 2014, he remembers the human Cas he met there and didn't like, the one that was so frustrated by having lost his grace, who was so depressed that he had thrown himself into drugs and sex. And he is not quite sure his Cas won't want to be an angel, given the chance. That he won't be as frustrated as that other one.
"Dean Winchester, you better not be lying right now because after today, I don't think I can take it," Cas takes a few deep breaths to steady himself and settles his hands on either side of Dean's face.
when he thinks about Sammy being upset over a dog dying. True, he never knew Bones, and he had little experience with the animals beyond his time acting as one. But that stupid dog Marley was a
“Hello, beloved,” Cas whispers into his ear, his arms tight around his waist, and the tears are coming faster than Dean can help.
Emmanuel listened, familiar with their story, without retaining any of the words.  His gaze was fixed on Dean, who stirred disjointed images and emotions inside him.  How was it possible, that almost a year of nothing but intense dreams, this single person could just ring the doorbell and change everything?
Cas smiles, small and quiet, and dips his head to press his lips to Dean’s. Slightly chapped and soft, they are the lips Dean kissed, seven years before, on what had begun as a grudging, blind date. They are the lips that have made him laugh until he cried, the lips that made him believe in love and hope and everything Dean had resigned himself against. They are the lips that, four years ago, he kissed before everyone – their families and friends and God, Himself – and they are the lips that hold him together, now, when it feels as if the ground is being pulled out from beneath him.
. This is better than he’s ever imagined, even more so when Dean’s hands snake around his back and dance across the bit of skin that exposed itself to the night air. Goosebumps creep along his arms and legs and if he thought his lungs didn’t work
Xavier shrugs out of the blue plastic chair and hugs Dean’s leg as he had Castiel’s in the checkout line.  And once he’s gathered Marie and Dean’s packed bag, which he saw was waiting at the foot of the bed, Castiel leads his family out of Room 562 for the final time.
“I’ll see you around, Cas, er, Emmanuel.  Don’t forget, my number’s in that phone of yours.  Call if you need anything,” Dean clapped him on the shoulder and stepped around to the driver’s side of the beautiful black car without another word.
feel like he’s the one in trouble here. The door is closed and the sign at its center is some motivational kitten hanging from a tree. He makes a note to compliment the change in signs and knocks three times.
“This is stupid.” Dean checks his phone for the eighth time in three minutes, literally watching the door from the foot of the stairs as the box shuffles in place. Cas, having grown tired of arguing over whether the puppy would be okay in a tight, closed box, was busying himself with the laundry. Bending down to untie the stupid ribbon from the stupid box – he
. Now, everything is the same and everything is different. Now is Florida and birthdays and summer vacations. Now is the way Dean’s skin looks under the moon, both shimmery and tanned from their time spent outside.
turns into a sweet moan of surprise and something sparks in Castiel’s brain, spurring him to kiss deeper.
And damn if they don’t end the night there and then, choosing instead to run back to their motel, down the beach, for a night of perfection.
It is a statement.  Not a question.  Dean swallowed and looked up from the spot on the carpet he’d become interested in.
Cas steps back and brushes off his hands, surveying their handiwork. They haven’t done too terribly, for a guy and an angel with zero gift-wrapping experience between them. Before Dean can say so, the box emits a shrill whine, causing both men to seriously re-think their decision. And really, if anything goes wrong, it can all be blamed on Sam. They wouldn’t even
“Well, if you don’t have anything,” Dean smiles and Castiel’s lungs forget how to process oxygen. “I have something
So when Daphne answered the door, and the responding voice was the low, gruff one from his dream, Emmanuel felt completely justified in the slight relief that fell over him.  He quickly left the kitchen and joined his wife in the hall, standing just behind the door so as not to be in the way.  When Daphne opened it wider, however, to reveal the caller, his heart dropped into his stomach.
Emmanuel watched as the man drove away, as the vehicle stole his one moment of clarity.  He knew he couldn’t just go back to how things were.  He couldn’t return to his life before Dean showed at their door.  And he didn’t want to.  The resounding ache that settled in his chest was evidence enough.
Dean warns the second he steps into the teacher’s lounge and watches his friend pour the last of the coffee into his #1 Gym Teacher mug. Sidling up beside him, he bumps his shoulder jovially. “If you don’t make another pot right now, I’ll fill your office with water filled condoms. Don’t think I won’t.”
Dean smiles as he sorts the American flag cut-outs the kids filled out before they broke for lunch, glad to see they actually put some thought into their responses. “Well, actually, he prefers to call me ‘honey bee,’” he replies, distracted as he pauses to read the page from Krissy Chambers thanking her aunt for her service. Ignoring the sad pull in his chest, Dean grabs the stapler from his desk and shoves the stack at Sam. “Here, make yourself useful. I’ll get us some chocolate milk.” Sam’s answering squawk is enough to make him laugh but, sure enough, he hears the stapler pang into the wall until he’s halfway to the cafeteria.
“Well,” Castiel slips an arm around his husband’s waist and adjusts the diaper bag on his shoulder before turning to their kids.  “Let’s go home then.”
“No wor-?” Dean pushes past his brother and heads straight for the office, not bothering to wait for Sam. Whatever they need it better
Dean’s not paying attention when Sam lumbers into his classroom. No, he’s busy writing the next lesson on the whiteboard, grateful for the hour or so he has until the little monsters get inside from their lunch and recess slots. Teaching his fourth graders has its moments but really, he needs alone time as much as the next person. Which is why he’s only partially surprised to see his brother from the corner of his eye.
“Thanks?” Sam side-eyes him once he reaches the bottom of the steps and stops at the sight of the wrapped box. “That for me?”
Which is exactly what prompts Sam to dash out of the room, taking care to close the door in case any stray kids happen to wander inside, unsupervised. Cas is early. Cas is early and Sam has a job to do. Gotta find Dean.
In that moment, something changed. For the first time in months, he wanted to step away.  It felt wrong, facing this man while in the arms of Daphne.  He should be on the other side of this door, he knew part of who he once was lies in the presence of this green-eyed stranger.  The man cleared his throat and looked at the ground before introducing himself.
Benny laughs but goes through the motions of refilling the machine anyway and Sarah teases him for forgetting,
Soon, he finds him around the side of the building, leaning against the railing of the veranda. Dean’s arms cross at his wrists, his elbows supporting his body against the concrete, and Castiel wonders how
It was actually really unfortunate.  He was in the middle of relaying the strange dream he had the night before; Daphne always encouraged him to share as much as he could.  Anything could be a helpful memory.  The night before had been particularly vivid, with flashes of green eyes and pools of blood.  He was afraid, truly frightened, for the person in the leather jacket but he didn’t understand why.  The man wielded a large knife and seemed perfectly capable of defending himself. Still, the dream had left him unsettled and worried.
“Sammy! What brings you to our lowly elementary domain on this fine Thursday afternoon?” He caps the blue marker he’s been using and takes a step back to survey his work. Dean’s no artist but he sure as hell can draw a decent enough depiction of rock layers for their current science unit.
While Sam rolls on the floor, having happily sunk to his new pet’s level, Cas sidles up next to Dean, smelling of fabric sheets and soap.
The eldest Winchester grins and types back a hasty, “It’s Marley & Me…you don’t want to be here,” before Cas politely asks him to, “please put the phone down. It’s rude to text in the dark during a movie.”
“Honey?”  Daphne’s voice broke through his thoughts and he realized he must have missed a question.  He turned his face to the small woman seated beside him and tried his best to give her the attention she was seeking.  However, he could see in her hazel eyes comprehension beginning to burn.  She turned to Dean, quiet for a moment, before asking,
“In the words of my brother, why carry a mirror when in the constant presence of perfection?” Castiel quips back, gesturing widely to himself. He’s not sure what has him speaking so daringly – he’s usually far more reserved – but he suspects it has something to do with the margarita Gabriel had foisted upon him at dinner. Still, Dean laughs and Castiel would drink a thousand more margaritas if it meant hearing that sound even one more time.
Behind him, he can hear people cooing and taking pictures. Sam’s explaining something and Missouri has stepped around them in an act of privacy but Dean couldn’t care less.
Yet, all the stops were still very far from the bunker. He was close, but if he was going on foot, he might never get there. Dean scanned the roads while driving, figuring Cas would at least stick to the main roads.
"Are you sure that Metatron hasn't been messing with your dreams?" Dean steps back and starts pacing, still worried, and Castiel can't blame him, not after Naomi had controlled him like she had the past year. Having his dreams controlled by someone who they are sure has not a single good intention in them, that was reason enough to be concerned.
"I… I don't remember any dreams. Not since last night." He had grown used to not remembering every single dream. He assumed it was a human thing and not Metatron's spell. Though from being woken so suddenly, he would have expected to remember something.
Castiel wakes in the middle of the night, or at least he supposes it’s night, from another nightmare. He is lost at first, not recognizing the place he is in, the quietness of the room, the warmth and comfort. Eventually the events of the previous day start coming to him. Being safe, the bunker, Dean. Dean, who is entering the room, looking worried.
"Uggggghhhhh…" is the only answer he gets as Cas flips down again, burying his face somewhere between the arm he is still clutching and Dean’s chest. Even for Cas this is a blatant disrespect for personal space, but Dean is not exactly bothered by it.
"No, I don’t know this Clark Kent." Castiel answers, smiling, although it’s true, that’s one reference he has yet to acquire. "But I get what you're saying. I was afraid, you know? That you wouldn’t recognize me without the coat."
Sorry for the long time without updates, RL is a bitch. No much further to go, so let's see if this can be finished before Christmas (no promises)
"I would appreciate it a lot if you did." It’s the first real break he gets, the first lead he manages to get his hands into.
Dean can’t believe what he is hearing. He thought Sam liked Cas. “Are you saying that you rather just forget about Cas? Is that it?”
Dean could join them, look into the books or past cases to find a solution. But with all the driving around, rounding up angels, he needs some alone time, with his thoughts, with his bed, with his things. Funny how before they had the bunker he could have, and had indeed, gone years on the road, from one motel to another, to nights slept inside the car, without any problem. But now he has a home, and he craves being able to just use his space, sleep in his bed, put on his records… In fact, he decides it’s time for a little music, to chase away the silence.
“Doctor Bromden, right. Are you working now?” Muriel seemed to be also listening in on the conversation. Dean hoped we wouldn’t get any ideas, and would just keep quiet and still.
The rest of the trip is filled with small talk, and John has a lot of stories to share to fill the hours. He gives hitchhikers a ride frequently, as it gives him some company for the long drives, and adds to his long list of adventures.
He realizes he is staring, and blinks. "You know you can borrow, right? I mean, Sam’s clothes are obviously out, but between Kev’s and mine, we will find something that fits you."
And as his body no longer has a grace to keep needs at bay, Castiel soon enough also feels the need for sexual release. At first he thought that it was just the need for contact, but when he started to get erections for seemingly mundane actions he realized he had to do something about it. He knew the mechanics, of course, he had watched humanity before and he knew what he had to do. And he knew there was nothing wrong with what he was doing, so there was no coyness or shame about it, and as such Castiel wasn't quite prepared for the onslaught of pleasure. He dived right in to it, grabbing his erect penis, and tugging it, surprising himself with a loud moan. It was quick, almost clinical, but exhilarating too. The orgasm sated him like nothing had done since he became human.
"Sometimes when people go off meds it takes some time for their disease's symptoms to kick in. And if he took such a big hit with the meteor it's normal for things to be… well, off norm, even when off norm is not very normal." God, Dean wished Sam was there. He could spew medical drivel and platitudes so much better. But they bought it. They must have been really desperate to see the back of Muriel. He signed the forms, put the angel in the car, prayed he wouldn't kill him and drove off in the direction of the hospital. When he was sure we wasn't being followed, be started to make his way back to the bunker.
Dean is startled by the turn this speech has taken, so he moves his hands to Cas’s cheeks to make him look up and just stop going down that path. "Hey, hey, you are here now, you are safe. We’ll figure something out, we always do. Okay?" Cas nods at him, and Dean lets go of his face. "Let’s start with a bath, a good meal and good night’s sleep. Here, let me help you."
"Nightmare," Castiel explains, although the word is not enough to describe the horror of Metatron's torture and accusing stares of dead angels. But then again, no words or combination of would ever be. Dean sits by him, giving him time to get his breathing back to normal, and to collect his thoughts.
Which puts his interactions with the Winchesters into prospective. Neither was very religious, Dean had been outright against them at the start. Yet he had trusted Castiel. He had thought that maybe Dean had seen that he was a good angel, had good intentions, but it at been all about trusting. Trusting not to be betrayed, trusting that humanity wasn’t going to suffer from Heaven’s politics. And it had been a close call so many times.
Oregon turns up not being about an angel at all. It is some pagan god that heals women and in exchange impregnates them and then takes the child. Wacky, but all in all, easy to deal with. Dean wonders when dealing with gods has become an easy job.
Dean, however, is close to giving up the search. Because by now, Cas will be making his way through countryside, and there is no way they can cover that much ground. He figures Cas has at most two weeks headstart on them, but he has no idea how he is moving around. He doesn’t think he knows how to drive. Which is something Dean is intent on teaching him, if he is going to remain human.
"Sure? No, of course not. As human I lack that kind certainty. But it never felt like my memories were altered, beyond the confusion that seems to be a product of the spell," he tries to explain. It's hard though, because he is not even sure how Metatron managed to do that.
Castiel discovers that by company Dean means taking up more than half of the bed and talking about all the things they discovered in the bunker. Soon, he falls asleep leaning on Dean's shoulder.
He muses this as he observes a couple, possibly a recent relationship by the amount corny sugary phrases being used. He is waiting for Sam, looking at the news reports of meteor showers and miracles and strange amnesiac men.
Cas opens his eyes, and stares into Dean’s. "That was before. Before, I was in a vessel. It works differently."
“Or he could be on earth, human and glued to the ground like the rest of the angels. And you know he was really bad at taking care of himself as an angel. I don’t think he is going to be any better as a human.” It’s not like Dean hasn’t thought about this before, but he chooses to stick with hope and optimism for once in his life.
He tries to remember one of Dean’s numbers. He used to know them by heart, but his mind is coming up blank. Too blank. He realizes that Metatron did something else besides making him human: he made it impossible to contact the Winchesters. But for some reason the memory of the bunker is still there. So Castiel holds on to it.
Dean doesn’t know what they’ll do once they find him, but most likely just keep going. Searching for angels, a way to send them back to Heaven. Dean wonders if Cas will want to go back. He seemed willing to shut himself in with all the other angels before. Would Dean lose Cas again? He wasn’t sure he could go through that.
Which adds to the fact that Dean is starting to get tired of the pointed looks, the seemingly innocent remarks that have always a deeper meaning, and of Sam's unsubtle tries to get him to talk.
"Not that I am aware. And I think the confusion is not as strong in here as it was when I was alone. I think maybe it's dependent on not having a control group to ascertain the validity of my situation."
"Those are some pretty big words, Cas. I thought we had agreed that you wouldn't talk like a robot. Besides, all that you just said? What I get is that part of your confusion was just you being lonely."
“Ask who? Bobby is dead. Garth is missing. Every other hunter wants nothing to do with angels. Or us, for that matter.” At this point Dean is sure that they are the experts in angels - everyone else just has theoretical knowledge and a lot of assumptions.
Touch and conversation were not the only cravings he felt. Famine had awakened Jimmy's desire for food, and as an angel he had acquired a taste for some foods and beverages, though he did not actually need them. But now Castiel feels true hunger and thirst, and has had a hard time finding sustenance. He has no money, and no one to turn to.
Cas’s intensity soon threatens to overwhelm Dean, so he tries to slow down, stopping the kisses all together, just holding on to Cas, stroking him. He wants to take his time and to make the most of this, but he also wants to just dive in and have it all.
On the third day he gets to a very small town, and manages to buy some food. But the locals are wary of him. He supposes he looks dirty, broken, suspicious. He doesn’t blame them, and keeps going.
Dean feels a glimmer of hope. It’s just that, a glimmer. Because it’s probable that Sam’s idea won’t lead them anywhere. But the truth is they haven’t had any kind of info on Cas since they started finding angels. And although he tries not to think it, there is a small voice whispering, telling him that Cas is dead, and it seems to get louder every fricking day. So he’ll take anything, any harebrained idea that might work. Because he needs Cas. He has known it for so long, but had refused to admit it. But after purgatory he knows that his family won’t be complete without Cas. So he agrees with Sam, and calls Charlie, who manages to set up their plan with the minimal fuss. She even comes up with ideas to use online communities to get Cas photo to circle around.
“Wow, Dude!” Dean shouted, “Are you trying to plead insanity? Is that it? Calm down and think what you are going to say, at least in front of them. I’m here to… I’m here to help, okay?” His mind was going a mile a minute, trying to figure out what to do. The angel had already made quite a fuzz, but if he went to jail things were not going to end well. The cops were finally getting up and drawing weapons. “Play cool and no more wacky stuff. What’s your name?” He shot a quick text to Sam saying “Cuckoo’s Nest,” and hoped he would get it in time. Fishing for the appropriate ID card, he looked at the angel. “Name?”
He ponders doing the same to Cas, starting by ruffling his hair and ending up in some kind of tickle fight. He is positive Cas never had one of those, and that's part of the entire being a human experience. He is also very certain that Cas is in no condition for any kind of rough play, so he just helps dry him off.
"Wai... What?" Dean is startled by the sudden question. Technically yes, but he is not sure what is brother is actually asking. Because, even forgetting about everything else, Cas was in no shape for the kind of sleeping Dean thinks is being implied.
"Now it’s just me. My body, my entire being perfectly contained within it. And you are neglecting it."
Castiel soon learns how to get out of wherever he is. He learns how to get some change. He learns that helping load and unload boxes at the backdoor of a restaurant can mean a free meal. If he cleans up somewhat he can hitch a ride in a truck. A smile goes a long way in getting things. Helping others will open them to help you.
At night he sleeps on the streets. He finds other homeless people, shares what food he has and they show him where to find shelter. They all talk about the meteor shower, how the sky was lit with thousands of shooting stars, how pretty it was. It pains Castiel to hear of his brothers’ fall in quite that way. It was not pretty. It would have been painful and devastating.
"It’s hard sometimes to get rides where I want to go. It seems like my… erm… luck is just not that good." Lack of luck is a good way to put a curse of an angel in layman’s terms.
"Pushy," he answers, but he helps Cas remove his shirt, so that he can continue kissing his arm. He makes his way with lips, tongue and teeth, until he reaches the shoulder. "So, what’s the verdict, neck or arm?"
His legs ache, and his feet are blistered. He has walked through the night. He didn’t want the brief company of another trucker and he didn’t want another night filled with nightmares. He asks himself where the angels are. He has yet to find any, though he doesn’t know if it’s a good thing or not. Maybe they all died. Maybe all that is left is Metatron, with an open path to become a new god. He did always loved stories, so maybe he would fashion a new mythos just for himself. Maybe they just don’t remember, like Anna hadn’t. Maybe they were all human now, starting new lives.
Dean looks inside the bathroom. Cas is barefoot and shirtless and making a mess. Dean smiles at him affectionately. He still can’t believe they just happened to find Cas. It was a good thing they did find him though, as he is thinner, much thinner, and covered in bruises and scars. He looks tired even after the impromptu nap in the car. How much longer could he have had walked to get to the bunker? How much more could those blistered feet have taken?
It doesn’t take long for Castiel to realize he has miscalculated his speed. He managed a good 20 miles on the first day, reaching the next small town. The next day he was able to walk 10 miles before he had to give up. Only he was in the middle of nowhere, and his water was running low.
He doesn’t realize but he must have fallen asleep sometime, because the clerk is shaking him. "Hey, oh sorry, didn’t realize you were actually asleep. I was gone like 5 minutes. You must be really tired."
"Touché.” Truth be told, they had had harder hunts besides Gabriel. But to Sam that hunt ranks the hardest, Dean figures. He couldn’t imagine seeing his brother die a hundred times, day after day.
“Muriel, hmm? When I worked there he went by William. William Dunn I think, but everyone called him Billy. I suspect he’s been off his meds for some time now. He was prone to delusions, I think, so… I can call my friend, he used to be responsible for his ward, he should know better.”
"Well, Mr. McMurphy, it appears you'll have to transport Muriel back to Osawatomie. Are you okay with that?"
"No mojo on him, from what I see. He looks tired, and sore, and probably wounded or at least bruised. And he stinks. I mean, really horse level man stink. Don’t tell me you didn’t notice that. He is thinner, which means he also needs food now, and we saw him sleep. I haven't checked, but I'm positive he also poops now, so by all accounts he is human." He is not sure what more can he say to define being human. "I mean, he didn’t look this bad after a year in purgatory."
“Escaped 2 weeks ago, hmm? Delusional psychosis disorder?... Non-violent!? He’s far from non-violent, sir.” Dean looked at Muriel again, hoping he wasn’t getting angry again. He was. But it was silent rage in the form of glaring daggers at the man on the phone. Or possibly at the voice on the other end of the line.
"Yeah. Well, my friend dropped him at the bus station, and I gave him some money, so he could be closer to you."
Charlie dropped by, laptop, tablet and god knows what other gadgets in tow, and is typing away in her computer. Sam is cataloging the library, working in silence, and doing everything by hand. Every few hours Charlie steals his file cards and just adds them to whatever program or app she forced them to use, muttering about it being the 21st century.
"Yes, right. So, that’s the last you know of him?" Dean finds a map of Colorado, and starts searching for Burlington.
"I know. But we have a small cot in the office, for the night shift if we need some shuteye. You can use it, free of charge. You look beat, and if you are actually walking home, which is what it looks like, you should rest. Maybe I can find someone going your way, who can take you part of the way. Where is home?"
"Yes, please. I... Umm, I lost all my things, that's why I need to get in touch with them, they are friends, they can help me." The man, Castiel finally sees a name tag, upside down, Carl, nods and gets him the phone. As he expected the number is disconnected, at least it’s the message he gets.
Cas’s eyes are dark, full of lust, but there is still a spark of mischievousness. "I wouldn't know. I require hands on experience of that too."
In Purgatory, Benny used to joke that they were an old married couple that wasn't having sex. Dean’s response had always been a "Shut up, Benny", Cas would just keep on ignoring the vampire. But Benny had been right. They were just like a couple, they just weren't having sex. And Dean had never approached the subject of sex with Cas after that incident when they had been looking for Raphael because Cas had been so uncomfortable with the notion. Sure, he probably had had sex as Emmanuel, and he is pretty sure something had happened with Meg, but he still thought of the angel as mostly asexual. And Dean was anything but. He didn’t know how to deal with a relationship without the physical contact, without sex. The touching, the kissing, the caressing, the sucking, the fucking. Everything.
"Oh, I remember. What can I help you with? Did something else happen?" It had been an amnesiac angel, but he seemed to be able to cure people. They had had a talk with him, but gave nothing away. He had found his powers when he cured his wife of cancer, and had seemed a very good guy. No point in disturbing him.
“I don’t know, he might already have a new life. He might be happy not remembering.” At Dean’s sour face, Sam rushes to change the subject a bit. “But maybe we should be trying to do something about Metatron. I just feel like we’re treating the symptoms, you know? And the sooner we get to him, the sooner we can know what happened to Cas.”
Angel after angel, they were no closer to finding Cas or anything new about the curse. Dean is hoping the 20
Castiel remembers. He had just saved Dean, didn't really know him then, didn't really care to know. He had been the perfect little soldier, battling on, no questions asked. But Dean's dreamscape had been so unlike what he had expected. For someone that had just spent 40 years in Hell it was surprisingly peaceful and horror free. For someone that had been dealing with the supernatural from a very young age, it was surprisingly ordinary. For such a hardened man, it was surprisingly beautiful. That had been the first crack in Castiel very imperfect armor. There had been a resonance in those dreams, of a soldier that should have never been so.
The officer had a deep scowl by then, clearly not happy with the situation. Turning off the phone, he faced Dean.
"I mean, do we start to look into a way to make him an angel again? Do we keep searching for angels? Can we finally get to hunt for Metatron?"
in the things he assumes Cas is, but he sees the fleeting thought on Sam’s face. "So, I was thinking, maybe we should be searching for him a little bit differently. I mean, the other angels haven’t heard of him, even the ones actively searching for him. So, maybe see if we can get Charlie to hack into Missing Persons’ databases and get Cas in there, with our number as contact. I would even go as further as newspapers’ ads. I mean, someone will have seen him by now. So if we can get at least a small trail to follow, we can find him."
He sighs, looks at the water and fruit in his hands as if they could hold the answers to his troubles. So close, and yet so far. He takes a bite out of the apple and makes his way to the motel. Maybe they are still staying there. Maybe they are working a case. Maybe they’ll come back.
"I mean it Cas. And look, you are not alone anymore. If there is still confusion, or numbness or bad dreams, you can come to us, you can come to me. And we'll figure it out. Together. Okay?"
There is breathing, but it's shallow. Sam is suddenly by his side helping him lift Cas and put him in the car.
"I don't know. You've been human longer than me, what does one normally do when they stay in bed all day?"
He is 30 miles outside Denver, exiting a mini-mart when he hears the unmistakable roar of a ‘67 Chevy Impala. He turns his head to find the source of the sound, just in time to see it turn from the parking lot of a motel and speed out of town. Castiel just stares into the distance, seeing the car get smaller and smaller. He supposes he could have tried running, hoping Dean would spot him in the rear-view mirror. But he doubts he could even muster the energy for a quick jog.
He looks at Sam, who is going through the bus plan again, and just shakes his head. "Time to give up, Sam. We’ll never going to find him this way. Let’s just regroup, and rethink our strategy. These towns have our missing person ads, they’ll call us when and if they see Cas."
“Sure, sure, officers. Is just that I used to work down in Osawatomie and Billy here was a patient there. You can imagine my shock when I saw him on the news. He shouldn’t be outside, at least not without his meds.”
Castiel nods at him. He is being very helpful, though he is expecting the phone number to be a dead end. He knows how Dean works. That phone number is going to be a fake one, as it is tied to a payment with a fraudulent credit card. He takes the small card with the number in it and just stares at it.
It's not because he feels ashamed of those feelings, not that. Part has always been the fact that Cas is an angel. Or was. Sam had had relationships with monsters and other supernatural beings, but Dean had always tried to avoid it. Not always possible, true, if he missed the fact that who he was fucking was something other than human. And it had always been just that. Just sex, casual, one time things,
Dean gets up and lets go of his hands. "Now, what do you say about some food, and getting out of bed?"
"Okay. You know, it's okay." Sam says pointedly, making his message clear, as if Dean needs that assurance. So, the question had not been as innocent after all.
“Could be. He was curing people last time. Or could be another angel, maybe this one will know something.”
"It might be a fallen angel. News reports said a man was hit by one of the meteors and gained superpowers."
He is flustered, so he busies himself picking up the discarded clothes with the pretext of washing them or throwing them out or anything that will allow him to leave the bathroom without seeming like he is running away.
"Yes, I suppose. But not being actively messed up with. Just… side effects." That's the best way he can describe it to Dean.
Dean leaves Cas in the bathroom. He picks a t-shirt, boxer shorts and a pair of sweats. They will probably fit. The towels are next. He is gone about 3 minutes, but when he returns to the bathroom Cas doesn’t seem to have moved. He is still clutching the washcloth like a lifesaver. The water is still running from the sink tap.
as he says. But he knows it’s not as easy as that. "I have no money, or very little that I have to save it until to get me home. I can’t afford a room."
"Dean," he admonishes without opening his eyes. "You would know if I wasn’t okay. I am very much okay with this."
The bus ride is peaceful, and he manages to get some sleep. He remembers the last time he took a bus, running away from everything, with a tablet hidden inside himself. That had been a risk, a big gamble, but he would have done it all over again. This time he has nothing to his name but the clothes on his body, a map on his pocket and the change from Carl’s money.
He lies down, humming to himself. He is at center of the bed, he can sprawl all he wants, but he keeps his arms crossed on his chest. His mind wanders, and it’s not that strange that it wanders to Cas. It seems that all he thinks about these days is him. It’s the uncertainty maybe, the fact that he is actually running on hope, hope that Cas is alive, that he is well, that he remembers, that he wants to get back to them.
“And how do you propose we get into Heaven? Assuming that bastard is still there. Kevin is looking into it, but he’s not getting anywhere.”
"Just… today was the first time I heard you laugh. I… I was surprised. I still am, every time you do it."
But he smiles and says, "You should do that more." And Castiel thinks that he’ll try to do so. Laughing felt good. "Are you ready to go back to sleep again?"
Cas has questions about being human and Dean isn't sure he can answer them all. It's like having a four year old in his care all over again, only with far harder and stranger questions.
"Dean?" Cas is standing again, buck naked. Dean realizes he had been going commando. It is also unfortunate from Dean’s position kneeling on the floor. He gets up before he says something he might regret, and makes the decision to close the door. Can’t have Cas catch a cold, right? Or have someone get the wrong idea, from seeing him in that position without any context.
"Kind of. Look, you were pretty beaten up before, we actually thought you might be dead for a minute there, and Sam and I decided that maybe we should keep an eye, make sure everything is okay. Just for tonight. Just until we sure we don't have to rush you to a hospital."
He is plagued by nightmares. He dreams of the angels burning in the sky, falling, falling, crashing all around him, looking at him accusingly. Castiel is surrounded by angry angels but he does nothing. He deserves their anger and hatred. He destroyed heaven, allowed Metatron to play him. Why shouldn't they have their revenge? Every night Castiel dreams of torture at the hands of his brothers. Yet every morning he wakes up and tries to get a little closer to the Winchesters. Because he has to fix this. And if anyone can help it's the Winchesters.
He steps down from the bus, blinking in the sun. He is grateful it is warm, but he is fearing the cold of the night. He could find a room, he still has money. He could find a shelter too, the town is big enough to have one. But the goal is so close that he is unwilling to tarry.
"Thank you so much. We haven’t heard from him, so we were afraid something had happened. And thank you for helping him."
Dean smiles at Cas, not sure what to say next. He looks at the filled tub and Cas seems to get the message this time, and moves to get in. He needs a little help stepping in the tub, and Dean obliges. As he sits down he lets out a loud moan, and Dean physically takes a step back, not knowing what to do with such a sound without it being in a sexual context. Such a sound coming from Cas.
The clerk goes into a small office, and Castiel can hear the rustling of papers, pens falling on the floor and the occasional swear word. He sits on a small sofa near the door, content in giving a rest to his legs, stretching and massaging them. He is still getting used to the aches of the human body. Truth be told, he’s still getting used to the human body. It has been almost a month since Metatron took his grace, but everything is still very new, still very strange.
“And what, Sam? Give up on him? I’m not doing that. I will look for him until I get some answers, okay? I mean, dude’s resilient. I lost track of the times we thought he died, and the times he actually died.”
During the trip he tried to get information from the angel, while explaining what he knew about the fall. He was not happy to share, but tit for tat and all that, it was the only way to have Muriel open up. Also, there was a very strong resentment toward Dean, Sam and Cas, and explaining that who really was at fault was Metatron smoothed things out.
The fourth angel didn’t have any memories of being an angel, but everything else fit. Sam had finally gone with Dean to check that one. After a brief conversation with the ex-angel, they went away. They started a list of found angels, and state: barred from Heaven, amnesiac or baby. There was no clear pattern on why they showed these symptoms.
He checks Cas legs, and there are a lot of scratches and cuts and bruises on his chins and ankles. So he asks Cas to sit again while he cleans those, but it doesn’t take long. Soon the tub is filled, the air is warm, and there is nothing else for him to do there. So he stands up, turns off the water and stares at Cas trying to convey that he can get into the water. Cas stares at him, not showing any sign of understanding his look, but he does get up as well.
Finding Cas is not as easy as it had appeared to be. When they had arrived in Burlington, he wasn’t there, of course. Some asking around told them that he had indeed gotten into a bus. No one knew to where. The next step had been to go through all the stops along the way, all the way to Wichita to try to figure out where he could be.
“No, Dean. What I’m saying is just… Don’t get your hopes up, okay? If he is human, and he remembers, he will call. He knows our number. He knows where the bunker is. ”
Castiel misses the warmth of Dean's hands on his, and it's such a strange feeling, because he had not been craving that touch particularly. So he balls up his fists and sighs. "Yes to the first part, but can't I stay in bed all day. I understand it's something humans do."
“We damn well saw that he doesn’t respond well to restraints but what else are we to do. He was able to beat up 5 armed officers with his bare hands.”
"Dean…," he starts, looking at his hands. He looks perfectly comfortable being naked, and it isn't anything that Dean hasn't seen yet, although he is glad that this time there are no bees. But even if Cas is human, there are some things that will never change, and Dean feels that Cas is far too close, far closer than anyone would have been even fully clothed, or at least anyone other than Cas.
"Sleep, which is out because you're not tired. Mope, but you are not depressed or morose by character. Watch TV, or read, I suppose. But most times, there are two people involved, to keep each other company."
“Hello, can I speak with Patrick Bromden?” Dean heart was almost exploding with tension, improv was usually not a problem, but
“You know he could be dead, right? We have no idea what happened up there. Actually, he could still be up there.”
The bunker had become a way house for broken people. Even Dean fitted the bill, if he was honest with himself. He hadn't been whole for a long time. They just needed Cas and then they would have the full deck. Not for the first time he wondered where Cas was. He had tried to contact him, but the phone had been disconnected. He prayed. He just had to wait for Cas to call then. Or to drop on their doorstep.
"Yes...  Well we think so, we found him in a crater, buck naked and covered in soot. The people in the farm took him in, gave him clothes and fed him. We did try to find out who he was, but no one answered our notices. Didn't think of checking the mental hospitals though. The problems only started today. He tried to set the Robertson's cat, that's the family that took him in, on fire. And then attacked Mrs. Robertson."
"I would say it was after we discovered that the hard pagan god hunt was actually an archangel." Sam says without looking up from his files and news clippings.
"Human…?" Sam asks doubtful. He probably has thought the same thing before and failed at reaching a satisfying answer.
"Did you sleep well?" Castiel nods at him, sitting up. "I found you a ride, friend of mine can take all the way to the state line. Should save you some days of walking. Do you have a map?"
Dean stops his thoughts right there, because it’s no use thinking like that, wishing for things. He focuses on the angel hunt instead. So far they've managed to track down 19 angels, none of them with answers.
He has a destination in mind. Lebanon, Kansas. Once he gets there he is sure he can find Sam and Dean. He can find the bunker. The problem with hitching rides is that no one seems to be heading where he needs to go. He thanks the drivers for the short trips, sometimes he walks through the night, until his feet are full of blisters and his clothes are ragged.
These new ideas give him that extra hope, and he supposes Sam sees right through him, with his knowing smile. But he doesn’t care. Because he can believe they are going to bring Cas home.
Kissing evolves into grinding, and Dean has the presence of mind to start removing clothing, first his shirt, then his jeans, followed by Cas’s sweats, until they both discard their underwear.
And he does. He starts by just pressing his lips, like Cas had done. He leaves light kisses along Cas's neck, and he knows Cas is not impressed. When he starts to get antsy, to the point he might complain, Dean lets his tongue flick the skin, just briefly, but it's enough for Cas to be surprised.
"We’ve got a lead on Cas. One week ago he was in Burlington, Colorado. I’m going there to figure out where he went next."
"I do, Dean. I let Metatron fool me. I should have known better than to trust him. It seems that every angel is rotten to the core, power hungry."
Castiel nods once and looks at his hands, which are still shaking. He knows he has to calm down but controlling physiological responses is much harder as a human. Dean holds his hands, which both helps and worsens his state. He is startled by the contact, much as he had been before when Dean treated his wounds, still not used to it after being so long all alone; but he also feels more grounded, and safer.
Sam simply raises his hands and leaves, and he is glad that he does not try to take the conversation further. He wants to solve the Metatron problem, he really does, but unlike Sam, that isn't a priority to him. Getting Sam well was, finding Cas was, and now getting Cas healthy again is the priority. Friends, family, whatever Cas is, they always come first.
He misses the Winchesters; the careless way they bumped and shoved and hugged; the unstated way that contact was always there. He misses their conversations too, the way they had entire exchanges filled with culture references that he had no clue about. How they would smile at his bewilderment, and he could smile in turn, knowing that they were not laughing at him, but with him. How he would sometimes pretend not to get it just so they could carry on. How sometimes he showed he understood just to see the look of pride on their faces.
But with Cas it would be something entirely different. His feelings would be the driving force. Not pleasure, not sex. Although he really hopes there can be some of that too. But he feels like a teenager again, uncertain of what to do, afraid to put his heart in the open. Because he thought he had made his point clear a number of times before. And he thought he had gotten an answer before, only to get it thrown back at his face. Only to have Cas leave, or die, or go mad, or get brainwashed, or amnesiac. Because what had the last four, almost five years, been but a long, painful, slow and turbulent way to say that they loved each other.
"Yes, most of the nights I get them. They are not all the same. Sometimes it's the angels, sometimes is Metatron, in a few occasions you and Sam."
"Still sore," it's what Dean gets, but since Cas has not lifted his head, it could have been something else too.
Castiel smiles the first heartfelt smile in a long time. He is glad there is still goodness in the world, and that people still help each other, despite there being angels on heaven or not, despite there being a god or not. "Kansas. I’m still very far. Thank you for the offer. I would like very much to have some rest."
Cas seems to figure out what he wants to say, or manages to find the courage he needs, so he looks up and starts again. "Dean, thank you. For helping me, for finding me. For healing me, I suppose."
Dean wasn't too happy to share a car with an angry and hostile angel, but he also needed real answers. And something to do. So he would have to be Jack McMurphy a bit longer. "Of course, officer, Billy shouldn't be out at all. I'm surprised he hurt other people and not himself. On the news they said he was hit by a meteor?"
"We now know they will not stop to listen and really want us dead." Sam says with pointed look and Dean has to admit that this was the first angel they couldn't talk out of murdering intent and revenge.
The tray is forgotten on the floor, and the bed covers are strewn everywhere. Cas is still wearing his makeshift pajamas, Dean discarded his boots long ago. They are holding hands. If anyone asked, they wouldn't be able to say when that had happened. Maybe Cas had tried to get Dean's attention and grabbed his hand. Maybe it was the other way around. But however it started they had yet to let go.
"Well, he is not dead. Should we still take him to a hospital?" Sam asks, looking at knocked out Cas.
"You are not sure either, stop trying to come up with excuses. Let’s go. We’ll stop along the way to get some supplies. And pie. I really need pie right now."
"Sorry, got a bit lost in memories. I don't think it's Metatron. The dreams feel real. Regular. It's just guilt."
Castiel sits down and weeps silently. He is tired and alone, and is starting to doubt that he should ever have started this journey. He could have done what Metatron had told him to do. Find a wife, live a life. Forget everything about angels and the Winchesters. Yet Metatron hadn’t taken his memories. So he clearly wanted him to remember, wanted him to despair, probably. And that thought itself is enough to make him stand up, and keep walking. Because he won’t give Metatron the pleasure of beating him.
Disturbed by the turn his thoughts had taken Dean gets up, intent on doing something that takes all his concentration. His phone starts ringing before he decides what.
"Hello. The two men that left, in the black Impala, are they coming back?" No time for beating around the bush or making small talk. The quicker he could find Sam and Dean the quicker he could rest and let his guard down.
"I think they said they were reporters, yeah. I should have their card somewhere, in case something else happens, they said. I can dig it up for you."
Dean thought. Going to a hospital where there was no record of the angel, or themselves was clearly not the plan.
Kevin is still translating the tablets, but he says he continues to find no clues as to send the angels back to heaven and deal with Metatron once and for all.
"Never, dude. Last time that you kept popping up, sure you had the coat, but that thing was filthy. Purgatory filthy. And I still knew it was you while I was driving. Clothes don’t make a person, never believe that. There was a rough period when Sam was 13 or 14 when he wanted to dress nice and rich to impress a girl. I don’t want to go through that explanation ever again."
"Yeah, fine. Just another day hunting, right? We've had worse. But damn, I wish we could have gotten some answers." He says, still getting his breath back.
Again with the half smile, but this one is clearly forced, trying to mask sadness and failing. "I’m tired, Dean. I ache all over, and I have no idea what to do. I had one goal and it was to get here, because you and Sam would surely know what to do. But Metatron messed with my head, I couldn’t remember how to contact you, I only remembered I had your numbers written down once I let go of the coat and was far away. I hitchhiked, but most times I wasn’t even going in the right direction. And the closer I got here, the more confused I got. When you found me I was losing hope, I was so ready to lie down on the road, let night come and just…"
"Well, it’s about to change. My friend can leave you here." He points at the junction, very close to the Kansas state line. "He has some business to take care there. I’m afraid he can’t take you further, but this should really help you."
The drive back is fast, they had already been circling back to where they started. Dean doesn’t realize he had still been scanning the side of the road until he sees him. For a moment he thinks he is going mad, that he is imagining things. That it is the return from purgatory all over again. But the mess sitting by the road side resembles Cas so little that it has to be real. It's surprising Dean recognizes him at all.
Once they leave the bathroom, Sam has sandwiches prepared for Cas, and takes his turn mothering him. It doesn't take long for him to eat, and soon enough they take him to his room to sleep.
"Sammy, I'm gonna check a possible hunt close by. Make sure no one destroys the bunker while I'm gone, and eat something."
"It isn't, they showed the picture on the news. Regular dude." As regular as they could be, by the footage on the TV. Mid 40s, a slight beer belly, going bald. He looked like someone who would do carpentry on the weekends, maybe build dollhouses for the daughters. Not maniacal angel bent on destruction. But then again Cas looked like a holy tax accountant, and he was anything but.
He spends a night looking at the stars, refusing to sleep despite knowing that the rest would be useful. But he also knows he is at his limit, even if his supplies can be stretched to two days, his energy can't. And if this is to be his last night, he wants to see the marvel that is the universe once more. He will look at the stars and the moon, and listen to the sounds of the night and make peace with himself.
Cas looks up, like a deer in the headlights, hand clutching the washcloth near his stomach. "I have nothing else to wear, and if I take these off, I don’t think I’ll want to put them on again." His voice seems lower than ever, if that is possible. It's quieter too. But his face, his face is full of expressions and Dean marvels at this. He sees the shame and guilt beneath the tiredness, but also a certain contentment and peacefulness.
". It’s punching and kicking and Sam running to get an angel blade from the trunk of the car and hoping the angel doesn’t get any smiting ideas.
did not include a Sam at half steam. The captain was listening to the answer, and there was no change in expression. So far, so good.
“A few things worth checking out close by. But check this one, miracle man in Oregon. I think it’s worth the drive.”
While he waits for Cas to get undressed he notices the open door, making his thought take another unexpected turn. Because an open door leaves room for escape, even if a closed one is not necessarily locked. And Dean wonders if he left it open for his sake or Cas’s. He also wonders if he should man up and just close it, make it just the two of them, closed off from the rest of the bunker. Private. Intimate, his brain supplies unbidden.
Castiel has no more words to properly thank this man, so he nods and smiles, and takes the money. He figures that this is why he always rebelled before, because in the midst of war, and pettiness, and greed, and violence, there is always this spark of goodness, of selflessness, of caring, of love, that all the angels on heaven could never understand. They followed orders, they loved because they were told to. They could never understand choosing to be this good.
"Okay, get your pants off, so I can check your legs." Cas does it without questioning or looking at Dean. Dean averts his eyes, not sure why. And also not sure why it’s so important to him to make sure every inch of Cas’s body is checked for wounds and splinters. He tries not to linger on that, although tiredness and the stress from the past week mean that he has very little control about where his mind drifts to.
He tries to figure what time it is, but there are no clocks in Cas’s room. The noises are probably Sam, which could mean it's really early and he is going out for a run, or just early, and he is back.
With the few dollars he managed to earn in odd jobs and from charity he buys warmer, more comfortable clothes. The trench coat he trades for a pair of sneakers. Of all the clothing that he lets go, the coat is the only piece that he even thinks of keeping. Dean had kept it for him before, had placed a sentimental value on it, treasured it even. But sentimentality would not make the journey easier. Good shoes would.
"Yes, that would be him. He had a bit of trouble, found himself with nothing. I couldn’t find your card, so we tried the number you gave on the check in form, but no luck. I don’t know if he has already reached you, but since I found the card today I thought it was better to let you know anyway." That was the first lead they had. One week ago, Cas had been in Colorado. Just one state away. And they had been there. So close.
He learned that for two weeks the angel had been without any kind of mojo, and then suddenly, he was powerful again and the cat got caught in it. And then Mrs. Robertson. He had been unable to control the power. He had tried to return to Heaven then, but had found it barred to him.
The day goes on, and Dean doesn't know what the rest of the people in the bunker are doing or think Cas and him are doing. Maybe Sam took them all out for a road trip, Crowley included. Maybe they are all listening in, making bets. He wouldn't put it past Sam to do that. But he's not sure he cares either way.
He manages to get out from under Cas without upsetting him too much, and leaves him to sleep a bit more. He understands that the poor guy wants to sleep, wants to enjoy the comfort. He would, after walking that much and to be honest, he does exactly the same thing after a few weeks on the road.
“So they told me.” Sam sounds sad, like it’s his fault somehow, Cas could imagine the conversation he must have had with the OSP people and it couldn’t have been pretty. “I felt like such an asshole, not even thinking about what it would do to Dean going off his meds cold turkey. I was so sure that all he needed was to get away from Dad and everything would be fine, Dean could be a normal Omega finally. So fucking naive!”
And they did, easing up together and down the corridor, Dean clenched his fists and tried desperately to act normal.
“Shit, shit come on then!” he said, leaning over the bowl and bracing himself against the back wall in an attempt to hold on a little longer.
“They took me into a back room, it was obviously set up for it. And they gave me the drug. I don’t know whether I wanted them to hurt me or fuck me. But I got both.”
Gabriel was very proud of his tale, it had tragedy and redemption, heartbreak and grief, love and devotion, all the elements of a great drama. And well, if it wasn’t entirely true, it was true enough. Anyway, Gabriel reasoned, it served its purpose; now everyone was inordinately approving of, and sympathetic towards Dean, John and more even importantly, Caladh House. It was the perfect piece of political propaganda and Gabe made sure to capitalise on it.
Dean groaned again and shook his head, turning what little he could bodily away from Gabe and the tube. It was a pointless gesture, tied like they were, but Dean had never been one to take t his easy. He has no appetite while in Heat, constantly on the edge of nausea and pain. But they do all they can to keep it at bay.
Gabe’s been in here before, to restock the supplies and to go over the equipment with Cas in preparation. He was familiar with almost all the pieces already, having worked with Omegas for most of the last decade but knew it was helpful to revise some particulars anyway.
"Come on Deano, don't fight it this time buddy," Gabe holds Dean's head still and pushes his thumbs deep into Dean's mouth, forcing it open for the mouthpiece. Dean shakes and shifts to get away, knowing what's coming.
Dean starts his exercises, feeling the familiar pressure of fingers testing the muscles, measuring his internal strength. And for a moment he feels brave, brave enough to lift his hand and tell Gabe to stop.
Dean nods and leans over, hungry for a kiss. Cas straddles the bench in front of him, and kisses back desperately, as if to claim back ownership of Dean's body. Gabe can't imagine how difficult, how powerless it must make Cas feel to have to watch while machines do what his own body can't. He doesn't linger long in the kiss, but not fully pulling away either, instead he rests his hands on either side of Dean's chin, making him focus for a moment longer.
“That’s good sweetheart. Perfect. Now shut your eyes,” Gabe reached across the mattress for the blindfold and pulled it against Dean’s face, “that’s good. We’re going to get you all wrapped up and then you’re going to have a nice little nap.”
But he couldn’t let Dean die. Not only would that break John’s heart, but it would throw the entirety of Caladh House into a year-long period of mourning. All of their businesses would be affected and worse, it would deny Gabriel the right to run for Council Leader.  He would need to wait another eight years and he couldn’t let that happen,
Having finished reading the small amount of information available on the topic he clicked through to the ‘Dynamic Spectrum’ page, curious to see if Wikipedia had been updated yet with the newest Scientific Research on the topic.
The Omega Support Program (OSP) had warned him that Dean would need a firm hand and a lot of coaxing to get him where he needed to go. When Dean had almost died the second time, showing just how unable he was to care for himself, they had approached Castiel to take his guardianship contract. Chosen him specifically because he was both an Omega specialist physician but also because they knew him by reputation.
He also resisted the urge to set Dean up for a polysomnogram, although he has all the equipment for a proper sleep study. This is not the time and although it would serve to make him feel better, it would do nothing but disturb Dean’s sleep. So as tempting it would be, Cas resists. He’ll do it another time he decides, he’d planned to anyway, but not now.
“You should already know the answer to that. Isn’t it in his file?” his voice is hesitant, like he just want to avoid the topic altogether. Too painful Cas supposes.
Gabe can see that it’s working, but not enough. He grabs a second canister of Aphroxil and fits it into the other side of the mask. Setting the flow speed high. Then he prepped a sedative, readying it for a shot, but Cas stopped him, shaking his head.
Castiel gave it a try and was pleased to see that it already had Sam, John, Benny, and about a dozen other numbers already pre-programmed into the contact list. Well, at least that solved one problem.
John Winchester, the Head of Caladh House, paced back and forth across his office as he fumed at the person on the other end of the phone, “Gabriel, don’t you dare tell me to calm down!”
“No, I can. I like him. And Benny's still got three months training left in Paris. Honestly. I’d like to work on it.”
“I know. I know. It’s not fair,” Gabe soothed, running his hand up and down Dean’s back, “Just relax, that’s right. It’ll all be ok soon,”
Dean ignored him as he approached, too engrossed in his task to notice as Gabe slipped in behind him. He needed to be quick as the mask needed to be locked tight over his face before any of the pheromones could be released. There was a very real risk of Cas having an aggressive response to the rival scent if any of it escaped before the mask could be secured properly.
“Sorry?” the jumble of words and sounds barely contained any meaning though Cas can guess what Dean is wanting. He’ll have to ask though, it’s important that he expresses what he wants.
But there is little Castiel can offer for that, little relief from a regret that he too feels intensely, that it had happened that way. The chance for a better start for Dean, for them both, hangs hauntingly between them. But he pushes back the regret, conscious of his responsibility and the chance that they have now, and slips his hand down to encircle the cage resting between Dean’s open thighs.
He understood why many people sought membership as the benefits were substantial. All members were provided with housing, employment, healthcare, education and many other advantages.
Gabe could feel the change immediately. Dean's muscles relaxed, his breath became less laboured and his eyes drifted closed. Some sort of miracle of human evolutionary reaction there, he marvelled. Dean stilled, calmed for the moment.
The ice pack is back and before he can say a word it’s pressed against him, eliciting a shout and a curse.
He stutters a little but manages to congratulate them both. Even engage them in a sort of stilted conversation about their plans for the ceremony. Sam and Jess patient and considerate of his clumsy but heartfelt attempt.
Castiel knows that for most people, whether a Dominant ‘guides’ or ‘takes’ is a nuance, it’s semantic, it’s splitting hairs. The problem is that for a tiny percentage of the population, like Nick (who couldn’t let anyone, but his wife take him down) and Dean (who likely experiences his headspace through fear and pain) the reality is that it’s a matter of life and death.
“Slowly, it’s one thing to design it and another thing completely to build it. But we’re getting there and Cas is being great about the long hours. I feel bad you know, getting home so late each night and working all these weekends.”
Dean was pacing back and forth at the end of the the bed, rubbing his palms up and down his hips in an obvious self soothing motion. Cas was sitting on the end of it, hands out trying to calm him but no longer touching him at all. The distance between them obviously painful.
Cas lunged forward, driving himself deep into Dean while at the same time locking his hands on either side of his head. His thumbs slipping into each side of Dean’s mouth as it fell open to gasp at the sudden forceful thrust. He recovered quickly though, bucking up and trying to shake off the hands holding his mouth open, but Gabe was too quick, holding the already open tube over his open mouth and squeezing the contents inside.
Cas can’t help but feel proud of Dean. It had taken a lot for him to be able to show physical affection, he still can’t with most people, but now, with those he trusts he lets himself indulge a little.
Cas hasn’t loosened his bonds though, instead, he’s got him on his back and was lying over him. Pinning him down with all of his weight.
Benny thinks for a moment, "I'm not entirely sure, but one thing I know for sure is that he doesn’t trust us.  We keep forgetting he wasn’t raised here and he doesn’t understand our ways. Even before he got sick again, he kept asking me why we’re always so careful, so restrictive of him, he hid it, but I know it made him angry. He thinks things just keep getting worse and worse. Yesterday, he told me that everything now feels like it's the final time. Final walk outside, final sleep in a normal bed, final piss, final meal. We just keep taking things away from him." Benny sounded miserable. “I know Dean thinks we're cruel and I don't blame him. We have been cruel.”
Dean was looking gorgeous resting heavily amid the silk sheets on their bed. He wasn’t asleep, Cas could tell by the still tight muscles of his back and shoulders as he struggled to unwind from the day.
For a couple of hours he focussed on his own job, drilling patterned holes in sheet metal ready for her to weld. Stopping only a couple of times to suck on some ice from the fridge in the back. It was hot work and hard going on the shoulders. He was leaning back stretching his spine out from the hunched over position when Gabriel walked in carrying a cooler and whistling at him suggestively.
Cas dumps the contents of his arms on the bed beside them both, sorting through it quickly and organising his mind while he does it.
Cas and Dean were still curled up on the sofa when Gabe returned. Dean had leant back slightly against Cas, his arms relaxed at his sides and one of Cas’s hand rested high up on his chest, his eyes were shut and he was breathed steadily, too controlled to be anything but forced. He was obviously working his way through one of the breathing exercises Cas had taught him.
“And Dean? How was he?”  Cas was almost afraid to ask, knowing the importance of creating a routine and firm guidelines in stabilizing him.
As they readied for bed that night, Dean tried again to talk him out of the feeding tube. Castiel bathed and prepared Dean with his nighttime dilation devices, another area that Dean had needed to grow to accept. They were significantly bigger than the daytime dilators Dean usually wore and took some getting used to, but like the feeding tube, Dean eventually grew to accept them as necessary. Dilation was something Dean was very familiar with from his time in the OSP centre. It just took Castiel being firm and consistent in his expectations.
“That’s it.” He praises, “Keep still.” the direction clear as a bell, even when spoken in Cas’s soothing voice.
“You’re the bravest person I have ever met,” Castiel whispered leaning their foreheads together, “I don’t know what I would do without you.”
Cas reappears,the device resting in his hand. It’s made of plastic and metal. Dean eyes it a little warily, it looks different now that it’s about to be put on him.
Cas’s ruts are mild, not unusually so but on the lower end of the spectrum. He actually requires physical contact to initiate it and it will abate within a few hours, far too short a time to satisfy even the barest of Dean's needs. A typical Omega’s heat will eventually sync with their Alpha's, abating once the Rut has passed but as usual Dean is the exception.
Dean cleared his throat roughly, it had been hard work out there and while he wasn’t technically thirsty, his mouth felt dry and a little rough. Castiel wordlessly retrieved a glass of ice chips for him and rubbed his back encouragingly.
He feigns sleep for a while, leaving limbs touching, breathing synchronously, hearts beating against each other's chests. Reassuring and quiet in the calm morning.
Dean eyes are already falling shut again, now that the adrenalin has faded and the medication not yet completely out of his system, consciousness fleeing. Cas feels the moment he falls asleep, his tense body finally relaxing back into the restraints.
“What’s important now is that this is mine now. And so are you. All of you. Even all that you regret and I’m thankful for it, because it’s a part of you.” He kisses Dean openly, holding his gaze, “And I’m so proud of you. For getting through today and being so fucking strong. I think a reward is in order,” he lets his hand gently massage Dean balls and slide down the enclosed shaft. Fortunate that he’d decided to focus on denial this week as Dean’s body would welcome the chance for release and distraction. Cas hoped that maybe he could forget for a little while at least.
“But you have to tell me before it gets too bad, before I have no choice but to force you,” Cas is leaning over, willing their eyes to meet, he holds Dean's chin tightly circling his head with his other arm, his weight pressing them both down to the bed. Locking him into the uncomfortable conversation.
“Alright. I’m going to have him do the pelvic floor monitoring internally today. I want you to try at least, if it’s too much, ask him to step back. It won’t be a failure if you can’t do it. Ok?”
“I’ll be massaging your prostate for a few minutes to stimulate a release. You won’t orgasm and you won’t get hard, though it should feel fairly nice, if a little intense. You might feel like you need to go, you don’t. The best thing to do is just relax, let it happen.”
"Can I ask, where exactly do you think you went wrong?" Castiel enquires gently, knowing it’s a sensitive subject.
Dean rolled his eyes at him. Of course it’s for him, but it’s for himself too. He wanted to learn to trust, it’s just really hard.
The OSP had been right. Dean needed a firm but kind, carefully placed hand. Experimentally, Castiel had spanked him once, when Dean had forgotten to drink enough, leaving the carefully labeled bottles in the fridge for Castiel to find when he returned that night. Dean hadn’t fought as Castiel shifted him over his knees, but he hadn’t relaxed either. Not even when Castiel had steadied him, working his hand down his neck and along the edges of his spine, like it normally would. Instead he took the hits with a flinch and a hiss, forcing himself through sheer will to endure it.
“It says here that you were severely dehydrated and underweight as well as suffering from shock and extreme post-heat syndrome. I’m not surprised it took that long for your body to recover enough for you to regain consciousness,” Cas notes.
Next, they’d contacted his lawyer, his employer, his old university mentor and his parents, each time offering higher pay, more and more incentives.
His body already knows how, instinctively relaxing as his alpha commands. And suddenly it's not so bad, the slide feels deep but comfortable and fulfilling, and the want has returned too, the need to be filled up. It feels so good, each minute push, a beautiful expansion of the sensation, pleasure sparking down his spine where only minutes ago he felt only panic and pain.
