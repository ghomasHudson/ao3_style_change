That he has changed.
"I shouldn't have come, sorry. I guess, I should have figured that one out by myself. I don't know what I was thinking."
For a short, glorious moment Dean's world is perfect.
Grabbing one of the bright blue oven mitts still laying on top of the kitchen counter, he slowly opens the oven door only to hastily jump back, when a cloud of dark smoke erupts from it. Swearing loudly, he blindly aims to where he suspects the remains of his lasagna to be.
"The most beautiful girl I've ever seen In. My. Life. walks in," she exhales dramatically and a dopey smile spreads on her face.
The door was jammed as usual, so he forcefully pushed against it, until it opened with a loud bang.
"Yeah nicer," Charlie repeats, making a vague gesture that betrays her discomfort and now Cas is sure that her perception of his staring is of an entirely different nature.
Whoever it belongs to is capable of loving in a way that goes beyond anything Cas has ever known.
The smile on Dean's face must be the most beautiful thing Cas has ever laid eyes on. It seems impossible that he should be the one to cause the incredible happiness radiating from the beautiful man by his side.
However, the shy smile on Dean's face is answer enough and Cas lets out a breath, he didn't know he was holding.
Cas is still not entirely sure how exactly Charlie caught wind of his silly crush that hasn't faded one bit even after almost over a year, but she invited Dean along before Cas could even begin to object. He does not mind in the least. It borders a miracle that after all this time he still hasn't met the man who has been like an older brother to his best friend.
"How's my favorite redhead?"
It's not like he ever thought he stood a chance with Dean but he has never felt so far out of someone's league as he does now, realizing how pathetic he's going to look as soon as he opens his mouth and informs Dean about what happened.
He knows it's stupid.
It sure as hell seems private.
"as long as it is not holiday related."
After last year's disastrous events, Cas had decided to take matters into his own hands and host a get together at his own apartment.
Indulging in childish fantasies is a waste of time when there are two boys who clearly need a push in the right direction - towards each other.
He pulls Cas up from the sofa and starts walking towards the door.
The countdown starts and Cas decides that this is what he wants to take into the new decade.
The man hesitates, before nodding slowly, like he's not quite sure about his decision yet. His eyes dart around like he's looking for something to say and when they settle on the menu, he grabs it like a life line.
He tries focussing on that, tries to free himself from his negative thoughts that are spiralling like the snowflakes above him, but he can't.
It isn't until Charlie pointedly clears her throat that he registers what he's doing.
And Cas tried. He really did his best to ban their conversation to the darkest corner of his brain, but it wouldn't stop bothering him.
Their eyes lock, yet no words are spoken and Dean resists the urge to start nervous blabbering by clearing his throat.
There is just no way someone as confident and intelligent and beautiful as Dean Winchester would see Cas that way.
His words come out a little clearer than before, and Dean laughs at his words.
Cas had stood in the same spot for another five minutes after they had driven off,  asking himself what he did to deserve such humiliation.
"What the hell?! Don't you dare come any closer, I have a ... Dean?!"
Unfortunately, the coughing fit that follows leaves him unable to defend himself and Charlie, despite pretty obvious gesturing on his part, goes on to make her point.
Cas opens his eyes.
Although he considered the possibility for an embarrassingly long amount of time, until Meg threatened to show up at his house and drag him to the party in his sleeping pants if he really decided not to come in favor of hanging out with his parents and their friends.
"So you like Star Wars, huh?"
His teasing tone immediately puts Cas at ease.
This is where the night ends, where their ways part, and where it's up to Cas if they go back to the way things were before or if something new will happen.
"I do," he says.
He sees him biting his lip to keep it together.
He is aware of some of Castiel's likes and dislikes, but Charlie said they were supposed to gift something from the heart.
He looks peaceful and relaxed, and it makes Dean's heart hurt a little because Cas is always so laser focused in class that he sometimes seems to forget to take time for himself and have fun every now and then.
Charlie grins proudly and is about to walk behind the counter when Dean grabs her by the hood and pulls her back.
His heart rate picks up at the thought.
"Heya Cas," he says, sounding not nearly as confident as he was when they first met.
They arrive on ground level and Charlie takes off again, leaving Cas no chance to answer.
And because all of this is really happening to him, just like that.
Dean snaps is mouth shut in a harsh, almost violent movement.
And great friends they are, leaving him alone as drunk as he is.
And that’s the burden of belonging, he thinks. Once you find where you belong, it’s just that bit harder to be anywhere else. When you find the person you belong with, nothing makes sense without them. And he’s so much better at losing things than he is at belonging, and a person is so much easier to lose than a place.
He meanders. Takes whatever road he wants without worrying about efficiency or speed. He watches the landscape change around him as he heads east, towards the sea. Sometimes he listens to music, and sometimes he doesn’t. Most of the time he just thinks, the way he has always thought best; with an open road ahead and horror close behind.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” And then, because he can’t bear to dwell on himself a second longer; “How’s it at Eileen’s?”
They hug for longer than Dean thinks they ever have. At first he holds on tight, afraid of letting go, and Sam holds on the same. It’ll be the last for a while, but it won’t be the last. It won’t be the last. It won’t be -
. “I’m sorry I called.”
He’s not really sure he ever thought he’d retire, not for
He nods towards the chair where Dean’s jacket hangs, still bloody. Dean looks at it, looks at the handprint scorched on the fabric when it used to be -
. Dean wonders if he’ll ever get used to this, to the way the rest of the world communicates.
And, okay, he’s not okay with that last one any more. He wants Sam to be happy. He wants to be happy, too, and though he knows now that the two don’t have to be mutually exclusive, he also knows that this time they might be.
Dean drives out to the coast, because he can. Nowhere to be and no one waiting for him when he gets there, he drives closer to the Canadian border than he’s ever had reason to before. And then he drives as close to the sea as he can, and then he gets out and walks.
But when he first catches sight of the water, he knows it’s been for nothing. All he can think about is open arms and fearless steps and a trench coat floating to the shore. It’s stupid, with the
“Thanks, Sam.”
it’s been
“Why Maine,” Dean says, and then because the silence is too heavy; “After purgatory.”
And it’s not just that. Even when he was out of commission with a broken leg those years ago, he was still
again. Though there are only two of them, and though they only use one of the many bedrooms, the space that a few weeks ago was impossibly big instead becomes just a little too big. It’s not perfect, but it’s better, and Dean is too happy to care anyway.
He wonders when that stopped being enough. When he started to want
“I’m here, Cas.”
The day is clear, sunlight breaking through the trees and warming him as he walks. He remembers how it felt back then, walking along these roads after a year in the darkness. Like seeing the sun rise for the first time. How he felt alive again, for the first time in so long, and how he would’ve given that up in a heartbeat to be back in purgatory with Cas.
. Sam is gone and Cas is
Dean should get a move on with that. He’s already promised Cas they’ll do some more landscaping over the summer, and he needs to make space in the garage before autumn so that Cas can finally make the jam (the fucking
him - but the anger is gone as quick as it came when he realises that’s not quite true. Every turned down case, every time he can Cas chose to research from the sidelines and let Sam and Eileen, or Claire, or someone else take the lead. Hell, even buying the house, putting down roots of a more permanent kind, on their own terms, somewhere that wasn’t an inherited bunker. Those were choices, every time, choices they both made even if they didn’t really think about where they were heading.
His eyes are alight with joy, his fingers are drumming on the steering wheel and the smile on his face seems almost unconscious. Like he doesn't even know it's there.
Cas has everything he wants and Dean has nothing to give but himself, so maybe he should take Charlie's advice and just do it.
Yes, they had had several nice talks in the morning when they both left for work or in the evening when they both came back to there apartments. And maybe Dean had spent a lot of time waiting in front of his own apartment to increase the frequency of their chats, but that didn't mean that they were close enough for Castiel to forgive him the intrusion.
Ash next to her is all lazy smiles, until his gaze lands on his watch, and he nearly falls off the bench.
"Hey welcome to Espresso Patronum, what can I ...", the words catch in his throat when he sees who exactly made his way into the shop today.
He awkwardly waves Cas off before he can say anything. The last thing he wants is for Cas to feel like he has to apologize for the way he feels. Or rather does not feel.
The other man is as gorgeous as Castiel remembered him to be.
Not expecting a blow-back, he nearly trips over his own feet, but somehow manages to hold the fire-extinguisher steady enough that he doesn't spray the entire kitchen with foam.
it? You told me yourself that
“You know, Sam, I am. We’ve basically figured out this case. We inherited the salvage yard. Claire is insisting on handing us cash. I apologized to Cas. We’ll be having dinner with people we love, who love us back. Where’s the down side? Because I’m not seeing it.”
“Yeah. But just like the Swiss were technically neutral but still did a hell of a lot in support of the Nazi regime… I was technically neutral, but I stayed with Dad and kept hunting with him. I know it hurt Sammy.”
“Um… no. I was going to do that tonight, but….”
“You know, Anna tried to tell me that it wasn’t my fault, too. She said that it wasn’t my fault that I had tortured other souls in Hell. She told me to forgive myself. That was a long time ago. If nothing else, I’m consistent.” The ghost of a smile crossed Dean’s face briefly, then passed on, as if Dean had eaten something salty with an iron fork
“Crowley was born Fergus MacLeod. He was Rowena’s son, but she thought love makes one weak, and refused to love the boy. She was a witch – a powerful one – and she abandoned Fergus at the age of nine and traveled around, seeking ways to become stronger. Fergus ended up making a deal with a crossroads demon; he says it was to get a penile extension, but who knows if that’s really true. Anyway, he went to Hell, and eventually became the King downstairs. Occasionally, it was in his interest to help me and Sam, occasionally, it wasn’t. But eventually, we all ended up in an alternate reality where Michael had won the Apocalypse, and it was every bit as bad as Lucifer winning had been foretold to be, and Crowley sacrificed himself – literally stabbed himself with an angel blade – to save us. Rowena eventually did the same; technically, Sam killed her, but he just held the knife still while she walked into it, in order to activate a spell that collected the souls that had escaped from Hell when Chuck opened the rift in Stull Cemetery. And then she fell into Hell and sealed the rift, and saved us all.”
Mia smiled.
“Have you even
Dean nodded. “Yeah. Okay. I may not be a Seraph, but I am Cas’ equal
“I…I don’t think so. I don’t remember him hitting me
Mia took a slow breath in and out. “Dean, apparently it’s been quite a week. I had noticed that my clocks had stopped, but I didn’t realize that all clocks had stopped, I just thought I needed to buy some new batteries.”
“Busy. I feel like I made progress, for the most part.”
“But my having gone through shit doesn’t give me the right to put
“Yeah. I’ve been trying to find things that I can do for Cas, or things that I can give to Cas, not anything big, just little things, here and there, that let him know that I’m thinking about him, that I care. Because for so long, he didn’t know that I cared, or worse, thought I actively hated him, and I regret that, because I love him so damn much, and I hurt him so badly.”
your father put Sam in kindergarten; was he not intending to send you and your brother to school?”
“The bit where I’m talking to myself? Yeah, I knew you’d laugh.” Dean grinned, but still looked uncomfortable.
They walked out to the parking lot together, and got in their cars. Gadreel drove home, thinking about how lucky he was to have the friends he did - people who would sit him down and tell him when his head was up his ass.

“Do you feel that he blew you off about it?”
!” He broke out into fresh giggles. Dean and Cas both smiled softly.
"Dad said,
“So, Sam did remember seeing your father hitting you. That’s too bad. Hmmm. You say here that you ‘remember Hell.’ I take it that’s
, and that’s where he ended up - but since the Cage in Sam’s mind has no lock, he’s free to wander around in Sam’s brain, essentially. Later, he pulled Michael in with him, when Amara gave Michael the same choice.”
“Write about the same night, each night for a week? Um…okay. Kinda don’t see the point, but, sure. I can do that.”
"My goodness, Dean, did you take self-deprecation as a course in college?”
“You know…I actually did let that out once before,” Dean said.
. The logic was sound. He couldn’t find an argument against the conclusion – except for his own feelings of guilt and shame.
“But I

“Had you known what the consequences would be, do you think you still would have given in?”
“What are you thinking of, Dean?”

Claire got herself a cup of coffee and doctored it. Jody got herself a beer and sat down to Dean’s right. Claire came and sat across from Dean, to Jody’s right, and they rolled to see who would go first (Claire, playing Miss Scarlet (red)), second (Dean, playing Colonel Mustard (yellow)), and third (Jody, playing Mrs. Peacock (blue)).
“Y’think?”
The rest of the afternoon passed normally; he taught a basic yoga class - which he was glad to see both Castiel and Dean attend. Afterward, he talked to them on their way out.
Mia nodded. “I would suspect so, Dean.”
, D. Please? I need to know that I can trust my big brother, not just with myself, but to make good decisions in general. And it sounds like maybe you haven’t been for a long time. I get why, you’ve been though a ton of shit that no one should have to go through, but….”
“So is he, I think.” Dean smiled. “Sam’s always been better than me at communicating, so he’ll probably have this knocked in no time.”
“It does, yes.” Mia looked back at the page. “You say here that you ‘see now how stand-offish Dad always was to me, so getting an actual hug? Being told that he didn’t want us to be hurt, and that of course he worried about us? It felt fucking amazing. But where was the concern all the times he got drunk and left it to me to raise Sammy? Where was the worry when he left us alone for weeks on end? Yup, I’m still angry, still conflicted.’ But then, at the end, you say that you think that ‘Dad actually did love both of you. I think he tried his best, but his best sometimes just wasn’t enough. So, I think you, then, and I, now, need to try to remember that he did try, and just let all of the other crap go. His neglect shaped me, but it didn’t break me.’ Which doesn’t sound very conflicted, at all, Dean. It sounds like you’re starting to forgive John. Are you?”
“You say here that you can’t be fixed. Do you
“It’s fine. Water over the bridge, under the dam, whatever.”
“Oh? Who?”
“That’s good, Dean. Communication is essential to a good relationship, so if you have time, and you can think out and write down what you want to say, it helps you to communicate. Just remember,  you have to actually say the words, too.” Mia smiled.
“So, basically, Amara is an immortal, omnipotent being, who, by accident, put two archangels into your brother’s brain, and you met with her -”
Dean called over to Sam, “Hey, Sammy! C’mere a minute, wouldya?”
“Well?”
“No.” Dean swallowed hard.
. Could he?”
“Did you?”
Dean blushed again, but he was concentrating on something else. “So, when I tell Cas that I don’t want him haring off on his own, and he stops doing that, and seeks consensus before moving with a plan… that’s part of this, too, isn’t it?”
is one more thing you have to think about when you make a decision about whether to drink or not, or whether to pick up some random chick and say skeevy things to her. And maybe my worry will tip the balance in the right direction.”
Mia smiled. “Yes you do, Dean. You wrote it down, even. You said that you
for your behavior the night before. That was really good. Yes, you spiraled, but you didn’t spiral about
“And then there’s a second letter to Amelia?”
“That’s lovely, Dean.” Mia smiled, as well. “And that gets us up to this morning!”
“Ah, good to know, good to know.” Dean made a note.
“And then you started a letter to Kevin, but after two sentences, it stops, and you wrote a journal entry, instead. Tell me about that, Dean.”
“When you say Cas
“C’mon, Claire, one more game. You need to even the score, doncha?” Dean looked at her hopefully, in an approximation of Sam’s puppy-dog look.
“He was a Yellow-Eyed Demon, one of the four Princes of Hell, created by Lucifer. He fed demon blood to certain children to awaken dormant psychic powers in them to find a leader for a demon army. He wanted Sammy to be that leader. Of course, we didn’t know any of that then. We found it all out much, much later.”
. And he
Let's just pretend that diabetics actually had it this easy in the days of curricles and carriages, okay? ;) I'm making it hard enough on them without Anna's diabetes actually being fatal because they can't do anything about it.
“Hmm? Oh, yes, absolutely, Dean. Don’t worry.” She handed the notebook back to Dean.
“Charlie was a hacker, she helped us take down Dick Roman – you might remember him, big corporate guy, thought he might run for president at some point? – she was like a little sister to Sam and I. She died soon after I got the Mark of Cain. I used it to kill the family that killed her, the Stynes.”
“Okay, okay. Fine.” He opened the refrigerator and got another beer. Claire took it from him.
“Yeah, there’s a lot going on, Mia, don’t know if you’d noticed, and I don’t know what I’m supposed to do about it, but everyone keeps looking to me for answers, and I don’t have any!” Dean suddenly sputtered to a stop, breathing heavily.
Dean grinned, thinking of the surprise he had for Castiel.
Ruby provides food for the 3 of them, then they all fall asleep. Dean wakes, thinks, and starts to plan. Cas wakes to discover that Anna is ill.
“Hmmm, verrry interesting,” he said, making a note.
“Good. I’m proud of you, Dean.” Sam left it at that.
, Dean.”
“No. I’ve never discussed it with Sam. He’s thanked me, a few times, for raising him, it’s not like he’s unaware of what I had to do. But no, I’ve never made it clear to him what it meant to me to have to do it, or how scared I was that I would fail.”
“Very good, Dean. Now it’s later that evening. How are you feeling? What did you do next?” Mia asked, calmly.
Dean laughed as well. “I don’t know what else to call it.”
, eventually.”
“So, it seems that maybe you have some issues with your sexuality, here, Dean. How do you identify yourself, as a sexual being, Dean?” Mia asked.
"And I said,
Mia nodded. “And then you write, ‘I had so much anger inside of me, for so long. I lashed out so often, so much, for all the wrong reasons, and at all the wrong people, especially Cas. I see now how much damage that anger did, not only to me, but to all those around me, everyone I love, and I’m so sorry for it, but I’m not going to wallow any longer in the misery and shame that regret and remorse could engender. I refuse to drag myself back down into that morass of bad feelings. I see it, I acknowledge it, and now, I’m going to let it go. Because that’s the healthy thing to do. I could tell Cas that I’ll be different going forward, but he’ll have to see me actually being different, every time, not just once, in order to believe it. There’s no point in saying the words, when consistent action will speak more loudly anyway. The only words that are important now are the positive happy words like, “I love you,” “I want you,” and “I need you.” Oh, and “so, do you want to drive?” Because letting Cas drive makes Cas happy, and making my angel happy makes me happy. I like being happy. I think I forgot that, somewhere along the way.’ And I think that all sounds pretty good, Dean. But is it simply
“Okay, so Saturday seems to have been a busy day for you, Dean. You wanna walk me through some of this?” Mia asked, gently.
“You say here at the end that you can’t breathe; I assume that was the start of the panic attack?”
“How do I do that, Mia?”
“It’s like a glow beneath my skin, like… like I was out in the sun a little too long, and now I’ll have a good sunburn; just a dim but constant glow. It’s noticeable, if you’re looking for it, but otherwise, to most people, I’m sure it’s not obvious at all. Why? What do
“How did that make you feel, Dean?” Mia wanted to know.
. So Amara only knew about the Cage
Mia gave it another second, before returning to reading the journal. “All right.
me, Dean.” Cas’ voice broke at the end.
“Well, he flew back. It made worrying about losing him at some point in the vague far off future seem ridiculous.”
? Don’ girls jus’ wanna have fun? Isn’t that the song?”
?” Cas demanded.
Mia nodded. “I told you when you were here last, Dean, that your anger could become a problem. Tell me if I’m wrong, Dean, but I think you tend to push your feelings down, bury them, rather than deal with them; is that right?”
Dean. “You’re soaked.”
Mia made another note. “Why did your father stop laughing, Dean?”
on me and Sam, and would call us ‘Dad’ as well. But now he seems to just be calling Cas ‘Dad’. Because he has a human soul as well as Archangel grace, Jack is extremely powerful, but he’s had problems in the past with his grace, and with his soul. Cas says that at the moment, both are fully charged, and he has so much energy, he practically bounces.”
Anna and Alfie were in the next curricle; their bags were being unloaded now. Soon it would be time to get down from the vehicles and board the train, finding some space in the narrow cars to find their own for the next several days, as their journey would take nearly a week.
“Now, think back, let yourself remember. You’re in a motel. You’re with your father, and Sam. Your father is giving you instructions. What is he saying, Dean?”
“Anyway, I apologized to Claire, and to Jody, and I told Jody that I just can’t be trusted around alcohol. And I wanted to tell you, too, and ask you to do me a favor.”
“So everyone headed off to bed, or at least their own rooms, and you and Cas went back to your room, and Cas started in again to read the rest of your journal, and you write that ‘when I started to write this entry this morning, I found a note from him: “Dean, I read the whole thing from start to finish, and I am honored that you trust me with so much of yourself. I am so proud of you and the progress you’ve made so far, my heart. Thank you for loving me so much, and for finally being willing to take a chance. I love you. Always, Cas.” It made me smile. And that’s everything, except for today’s assignment - my letter to future me.’ That’s it? ‘It made me smile’?”
And sometimes he came back before the money ran out, but sometimes he
Dean considered it. “Maybe. I really didn’t know what to write to myself in the future. It’s hard, because for so long I kind of assumed the future was the one thing I wouldn’t have to worry about, y’know? I mean, Mia, I died at 29. I thought it was forever, when I went down. Cas pulled me out after four months, but if not for that, it would have been forever. The future wasn’t something I ever really thought about.” Dean shrugged.
“Well, no.” Dean looked puzzled, as if he couldn’t see where Mia was going with the question.
“But the fact that the pattern included Claire this time only amplifies my anger. You’re just damned lucky I have Claire on my radar, so to speak. Or is that why you chose to ‘be stupid’ with
“Yes, D, that’s the song, but I’m tired now, and so are you. C’mon, now.”
“Because that was the night that my mom died. The night Azazel killed her, fed demon blood to Sammy, and burned down our house.”
And Dad said,
Gad looked up at that. “It’s not
Dean closed his eyes and thought. Could he remember back before the fire? Maybe…just…just before….
Dean startled at that. “What? No way.” He pulled out his cell phone, and, sure enough, he’d arrived at noon, and it was just before 3:00. “I told Cas I’d pick him up in an
consider us friends?” Dean smiled.
That afternoon, he had a meeting with Pam and Benny about a couple of patients they wanted him to work with, mostly with hydrotherapy in the pool. Pam’s patient needed to work the muscles in her legs, injured from never being allowed to walk (she’d been limited to kneeling and crawling only) during her five years of slavery, and Benny’s patient needed to get over a severe fear of water; apparently, he’d been kept in a basement that periodically flooded, and had nearly drowned a few times. The second patient would be taken much more slowly than the first, as the first already loved to swim, just needed to regain the strength and confidence to stand upright and walk.
see?”
Mia continued to read. “And here’s a letter to someone named Jo. Tell me about Jo, Dean.”
“Well, yeah, kinda. Cas. Not in the same way, obviously; Cas would never… but yeah, I think I belong to Cas. And Cas belongs to me.”
to get past that, Mia. Because I want to enjoy whatever Cas and I decide to do. I have, so far, and I want to continue. I don’t want to be afraid of being with him in
“Okay. Well, think about that, too, then.” Mia smiled.
He headed in the direction of NRR’s campus, but made a stop at a deli for lunch - pastrami on rye with melted muenster, onions, mayo, and brown mustard, and a diet Coke - along the way. While at the deli, he ducked into the bathroom with his duffle, and changed into his usual t-shirt and sweatpants. He wasn’t sure why he didn’t let his more formal side out at NRR, but he was always careful to change before going there, after being at the hospital.
“Well, let me ask you this, Dean. When you and Sam were growing up, why did you take what John dished out - assuming, for the sake of argument here, for the moment, that all of your memories, including the ones we know to have been implanted and false, were real - why did you never stand up to your father and just say, ‘no’, Dean?”
.' That’s a good motivation to keep snuggling, and not be drinking, isn’t it?”
“Nicely said, Dean. You write here that explaining yourself to others is going to hurt, and you don’t want to hurt, but you think maybe you
“Dean, do you believe that you still belong to Alastair?” Mia asked.
“Very. So, you told Claire about the engagement, and that went well, it seems?”
“So, you’ll come home?”
“I’m glad that you see now the difference between lust and affection, on the one hand, and true, real love, on the other.”
that, the day after Cas left. I have a beer now and then, but not enough to care about not stocking it. If I want one, I can go out,” Sam told him.
. I’m not seeing anyone but you on Tuesday afternoons for the time being. I’m only charging for the first hour, but you’ve clearly needed more time.”
“Sammy was sitting at the kitchen table. The room wasn’t like a regular motel room, it was almost an apartment, but it still had kind of a skeevy feel to it, ‘cause it was so run down and kinda grimy. But it had a separate bedroom, and a kitchen with a stove and a full-sized refrigerator, and a real table with chairs to eat at, and that was kinda nice.
“That said, it seems you got it under control fairly quickly. By late afternoon, you were talking about taking care of Cas. Nice recovery, Dean.”
“Ah, of course. Nurse Blanchett. What were you saying to Miss Wills about making noise?” he asked politely.
“So, what did you want to talk to me about?” he prodded.
“Cas’ vessel.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“But not in an
“Ah, and here, you say you did stand up to John, for once, and that there are four memories that you have of how he reacted to what you said to him. You told him that he couldn’t be gone for that long, couldn’t leave you with inadequate funds and food, and if he wanted you to keep Sam safe, he had to give you the means to do so. All reasonable, Dean. Absolutely minimum standard, I agree. But it appears John may not have.
“I guess.”
Dean looked blankly at her. “I… um… honestly, I have no clue.”
Mia smiled kindly as Dean blushed, and continued to read. “And here’s where you talk about the day of the proposal, going shopping with Cas, getting the rings, going to dinner… and you note here the beverage choices, specifically - that you had coffee, despite the restaurant having many fine whiskeys available - and you say here that ‘It wasn’t even a difficult choice. I don’t need to feel numb any more.’ Tell me about that, Dean.”
“Well, this first paragraph on Thursday is promising, Dean. You say here: ‘A lot’s happened since I wrote my last entry, yesterday. Hard to believe how much, actually. I feel like I’ve had walls up forever, that are now just crumbling to dust at the merest touch. I talked to Claire and admitted that I had messed up with Cas. I told Jody that I love her. I told Donna that she’s one of my favorite people and makes my life brighter by existing. And I told Sam that I don’t give him enough credit, and that I don’t want to shut him out any more.’ Now, I know who Sam is, obviously. Who is Donna?”
Dean shrugged. “Just what it says. For a really long time, I hated my life. I hated myself. I didn’t have anything I wanted and didn’t know how to change things, and the only way I could cope with the horror of what I’d been through was to drown my sorrows - drink until I was numb and couldn’t feel anything any more. I needed to feel numb, I needed not to feel. And I don’t need that, now. A large part of that is Cas, but it’s me, too.

“I’m having some trouble with…well, with remembering certain things clearly. Things from when we were growing up, up through when I went to Hell. Hell, and after, that’s all clear as a bell. But before that, I have these odd…memory shifts, where I think I remember something, but if I try to focus on it, the memory changes slightly. Certain things stand out, but those are a little few and far between. Everything just kind of blurs together in my head, and I’m having trouble sorting through memories and figuring out what’s real and solid, on the one hand, and what’s shifty and changing, on the other.

“Hello, Dean. Come in, please,” Mia stepped back to allow Dean to enter her office. He stepped in, and offered her his journal. She took it, saying, “Please, have a seat.”
“I was kneeling on the floor, not because he’d demanded it of me; I’d just slid down to my knees once he’d taken me off the rack, too tired to stand any more. And he put his hand down and cupped my cheek gently, so softly, and he smiled sweetly at me, and he offered to help me up, and I couldn’t resist it and nuzzled his hand with my nose. And it surprised him, and he huffed out a soft laugh, and he leaned down and got his hands under my arms and hoisted me up, and he got me into a comfortable chair and brought me a soft blanket.
“Yeah. And he was, too. Really supportive.”
“I’m sorry, too, Dean.”
“Yeah. That’s the journal entry where I spiraled down again.” Dean looked uncomfortable.

“You write here that ‘While it meant losing Bobby twice, being haunted by him also meant that you got something from him that you never got from John - closure.’”
“Sounds like you’re stressed out, and trying not to show it. Dean, do you think that you bear personal responsibility for fixing the problems you just listed?”
“And you found that.”
“Well, Bobby thought that I had to be either a shapeshifter, or a revenant. So, I cut my arm with his silver blade, which proved I was neither of those. Oh. Um. Sorry, Mia.”
Thursday morning, Gad woke before his alarm clock went off, and lay there staring at the neon digital numbers in the dark. He didn’t want to go to work. He knew the scent of his shame would still be tinging the air around him, and it would make his omega patients uneasy and tense - the worst frame of mind for the type of therapy he did, where he needed them to be relaxed and loose, in order to work the muscles to best effect.
“Thank you, Pam.”

Cas watched Dean’s face, and saw the second Dean did, in fact, start to let go of the guilt and shame that had burdened him for so long – as again, the light in his soul began to flare. The glow was so strong, so bright, the Cas couldn’t understand how the nearly 20 humans nearby in the parking lot didn’t notice it. And it was sustained, growing slowly stronger, rather than fading out or dimming quickly, as the recent flares had done. “Dean? Can you see….”
“How’re you feeling?”
He’s too old to be sleeping in his car, now, and it should help him sleep easier - a shower, and a bed, and mindless TV - but it doesn’t. There’s too much space. It shouldn’t be possible for one bedroom to feel as vast and empty as the bunker, but here he is.
“Cas, please.”
“I need you.”
They look at each other, and it’s one of those looks Dean knows so well; the ones that said everything they both needed to before either of them got the courage to say it out loud.

Dean knows how this goes.
Cas always comes back to him. Cas has always come back. Whether it takes minutes, or weeks, or months -
He wasn’t one of them any more.
There’s this feeling that’s settled itself in Dean, not just in his chest but deep in every part of him. And it’s not happiness, though he
Cas laughs, and Dean squeezes his hand to let him know that was what he’d wanted all along.
It feels like time is catching up with him, and he doesn’t know how long he has left.
Except, now that he thinks about it, he thinks maybe it’s been gone a little longer than that.

Something makes him hesitate as he pulls in towards the garage. No, not just hesitate - it stops him in his tracks. It’s enough to make him stop, and turn around, and drive instead to the main entrance. He’s not sure what it is, but he’s glad he listens, because there, over by the door -
They watch TV. They go for drives. They read, and they clean, and they walk. Not always together - in fact most often apart - but nearby. And it’s boring, but Dean doesn’t know what else to do. It’s boring, but he’s not ready for anything else. He’s not ready to think about -

He can’t get up, can’t keep on fighting, can’t go through this all again,
He never seems to stop aching. His back, his arms, neck, feet – everywhere. His right knee has been giving trouble for years now, since a vampire hunt in ‘13. He pulled his left knee climbing out of a grave a few years later, and the same ankle in the fall right after. His right wrist complains whenever he picks up a knife, his left when he drives, and both have an annoying habit of clicking when they move. Every night in bed his feet throb from hours hunting, or his ass is numb from sitting researching or driving.
“We've got plenty of time, my love.”
He’s still alone.
“Cas,” Dean says, not quite a question but something close to it, tentative and a little uneasy. His voice is quiet enough that it doesn’t compete with the tranquility of the morning but rather blends in seamlessly with it.
But Cas hasn’t come back. How much longer is supposed to wait? Minutes? Months? How long is he supposed to live like this, like there’s nothing else that matters except the space beside him where Cas should be?
All this time Dean thought he’d die bloody. That all this would end with one final,

And he brings Castiel home.
Behind the door to the bunker the rain is still deafening, but at least it’s dry. The two of them shiver in the stairwell, soaking and freezing as they head underground. They should shower and change into dry clothes, but all at once they stop in the war room and don’t make any effort to carry on.

It begins, and that should be the hardest part. But it’s not.
And this right here is home, and it’s freedom, and it’s the only future he wants.
It’s a life for younger men.
It’s time to go home.
And boy, if that hasn’t snuck up on them. It had been an unreasonably gloomy spring so far, far too much rain and unexpectedly late cold-snaps, but it seems as though summer may finally be on its way. There’s a breeze ruffling the grass, but for the first time since last autumn it’s not raising goosebumps. Instead, it’s already starting to get warm, the sun beginning to break through the trees at the edge of the garden. In a few hours it’ll probably be too hot to even sit out in direct sunlight, something that is an exciting novelty now but will get old very fast. Unlike the flies already starting to buzz around his head or settle in little black spots on the windowsill, which got old the second they appeared.
The artist hardly talks to him at all, and Dean’s not inclined to break the silence himself.
This is hallowed ground. Just like in Maine, just like the reservoir in Kansas, just like a dozen other terrible spots scattered across the country. Hallowed just for him, perhaps, but holy all the same.
The sun is high in the sky when he finally crawls back to the Impala. She’s warm from sitting so long in the sun, but he’s so cold that it doesn’t even matter.
“Look after yourself, okay?”
“I love you too.”
He remembers a bloody hand on his bloody cheek in the cold stone of a crypt. A sword stabbed into wood. Churches and forests and bedsides made holy only by his prayer. His back against the wall in an alley in the rain. Tears in newly-human eyes. Stolen glances, fleeting touches, and hugs that would never be tight enough. A hunter’s pyre and scorched wings and the condemning stillness of a lake. He thinks
house), a small, secluded building that Dean would love to call a cabin but is actually definitely a cottage, that could be any other hunter’s retreat in rural middle America, except that it isn’t.
Later still, he prays to them both. That makes the least sense of all, but by then he’s even more drunk and doesn’t care at all. They’re not listening, anyway. And when will that ever stop him?
He’d give anything to skip to the ending, to be safe and secure in a home of his own, Castiel by his side – Castiel, by his side, always. To know that it’s all been worth it, that he’s been worth it, that maybe, just once, they can have a happy ending.
“Jack,” Cas says, smile like a proud father, which Dean guesses he is. He must see the look on Dean’s face, though, because he continues. “It took him a little while to figure out, is all.”
“We have things to do.”
“Please come back.”
Sam’s phone calls to Eileen get longer and longer. Dean knows what it means, but he’s not ready to believe it.

before Dad was, and that always makes Dean smirk), but also she wasn't nearly as much of an asshole.
He keeps thinking he’s going to stop, but he doesn’t. He leaves New York for Vermont, and Vermont for New Hampshire, and he keeps driving. There’s something drawing him on, though he doesn’t know what, not as concrete as Sam or the barn but inescapable all the same.
Dean kisses him. It’s not the hungry, frantic kiss Cas had been half expecting, but deep and gentle and slow. It makes his heart jump anyway, like it always does.
He pulls over just before sunrise in a small town outside of Davenport. It’s not that he’s tired, exactly, just that he can’t go on. Can’t cross the state line into Illinois. Not now, when the darkness is just beginning to fracture with the dawn. Not now, when the weight of those miles seems so great, when he can’t quite bring himself to acknowledge the magnitude of so short a drive.
“No, Sam. I’m okay.” Dean takes a deep breath, wills the tears in his eyes to just
Dean wonders if it’s worth it. To see him again to lose him again. He wonders if he’s strong enough for that.
More than anything he wonders how far he is from the spot. Not that he’d ever find it, not that he’d ever look. But it’s around here somewhere, the spot that purgatory spat him out, in the middle of the woods in the middle of the night. It’s around here somewhere, and the whole forest aches with loss. The loss that became synonymous with love.
The letter writing and journaling continue. Dean's having bad dreams with some nasty side effects, so he asks Cas for help in trying to figure out what his subconscious is trying to tell him, and the relevant parts of those conversations are included here.
“That’s excellent.” Mia smiled.
Dean looked up at Mia, a tear streaking down his cheek, as he took in her words.
been able to concentrate, that you might have been seen to be just as bright as Sam?”
“And you say here that Cas said he wanted to go to Wyoming to get his stuff, so he could come home to you. That’s lovely, Dean.”
“That’s fair. But remember, we talked last week about making plans, right? Well, this is part of that. You can’t plan ahead if you have no dreams or goals for the future, Dean. So, your homework for this week, I think, is for you to sit down with Cas, and maybe Sam and Gabe as well, and think about what the whole bunch of you want for your futures. Where do you want to be in ten years? Twenty? Forty? And then sit down with Cas, and make a plan for, say, the next five years? Is that do-able, Dean?”
“Yes. Heaven wanted me out of Hell because I was destined to be the ‘true vessel’ of the Archangel Michael. And Sam was destined to be the ‘true vessel’ of another Archangel – Lucifer. And the angels wanted them to use us to fight each other, and cause the Apocalypse. So they sent Cas into Hell to rescue me. Azazel was working with other demons to free Lucifer from the Cage in which God had confined him. They managed it, and we can talk about how at some point, but the important thing is that for an angel to possess a human, they have to have the human’s consent. You have to say ‘yes.’ I
“I should’ve stood up to Dad, and I didn’t. And I didn’t see Sam again for just over two years. And I’m sure he thought that I hated him during that time. I didn’t, but I didn’t do enough to support him. And I’m ashamed of that, now. But, honestly, I don’t know if then I could have done anything differently from what I did do then. I was still Dad’s obedient little soldier, then. And it wasn’t like I actively supported Dad’s side of the argument, either. I just… played Switzerland.”

“Reading the letter to Claire, I think you understand yourself pretty well, Dean. You understand why you do the things you do, why you react as you do. And honestly, that makes my job much easier. It means you can then focus on taking the steps you need to take to change your own motivations. And that’s good.”
“I see.
“Um, hold on, lemme see. Um…” Sam dug into his pockets. “Yeah, I’ve got, lessee, thirty ducats. Why, what do you need cash for, Dean?”
. Your subconscious mind has been conditioned - trained, over decades of abuse from your father, and Alastair, and at least that one incident with Sam - to believe that you are property, Dean. Alastair staked a claim on you. You needed him to have that claim, in order to cope in Hell, because you needed to believe that there would be someone who might treat you well. And I don’t think your subconscious mind has ever let that go.”
This gets us up to Monday evening, the day before the next session with Mia.
"But then Sam gave me his puppy-dog-eye look, which he knows always gets me to give in, and so I sighed, dumped the pasta in the trash, and put the cereal box on the table. And then, because Sammy was really a good kid, he goes and gets the prize out of the box, and offers it to me, saying,

As Dean looked at all the red ink, he could see where he had, indeed, changed details, sometimes small, sometimes large, but each entry was, in fact, different in some way from every other entry.
“Under a bush out in front of the Millers’ house. He - or she (we should probably check, huh?) - looked cold, and wasn’t wearing a collar or anything. Maybe there’s a microchip, we can take it to the vet later, and see. But I wanted to get it warm and dry and fed as the first priority.”
Dean shrugged, thinking carefully. “Really, I can’t think of anything that I do differently, Mia. I mean, before Cas, I would never have admitted that I was bisexual, but I know that I always was.”
Cas’ eyes grew large, and at first he looked like he wasn’t appreciating the comparison, but at the end, he melted, as Dean had known he would, and reached out, to let the kitten sniff, and to pet its head gently.
“Why not, Dean?”
Mia nodded. “And you write here that that ‘just encapsulates your relationship’ with Bobby. That ‘he trusts you and believes in you, absolutely.’ That must have felt good, Dean.”
Mia nodded. “And here’s your letter to Bobby. Much shorter. Do you think you said everything you needed to, Dean?”

“No, sweetheart. You said that you and Cas talked, and resolved some things between you. Is this letter still
Dean shook his head. He continued to hold Castiel’s hand, but avoided his gaze, keeping his eyes down and on the table between them. “No, Cas. You’re forgetting. That’s not all that I agreed to. If all I had done was agree to be Alastair’s sex slave, his pet to torture, I’d agree with you that I was blameless. But I also agreed to torture others. I did torture others. And I enjoyed it, Cas. I was good at it. Every now and then, there’d be a quiet moment when I had time to think and I’d realize anew what I was doing, and I’d regret it, be sorry for it, for them. But Cas, those moments were few and far between. Maybe Alastair screwed with my wiring, or maybe I was always messed up – but I came out of Hell hardwired as a sadist, Cas.
Cas’ voice was low, but vicious in its intensity.

. And every day, at some point in the day, I got killed. For about 120 days. Sammy finally figured it out, and got Gabe to knock it off. And now, with all of that behind us, it’s funnier than it was then, so now it’s kind of a joke that I put it in there. Gabe’ll get it. Sending that one.” Dean grinned.
Dean opened the notebook to the correct page, and slid it over to Cas’ side of the table. “You have an open invitation, Cas, to read any or all of my journal at any time; but for right now, I’d like you to start with what I wrote in the car this afternoon, which is this page and the next two.”
“Sure.” Cas rose, took the plates into the kitchen, and returned with just Dean’s plate, with a second helping. He set it in front of Dean, and couldn’t resist.
“Apparently, the Cosmic Entity isn’t in the Empty anymore, he’s down in Hell, terrorizing Rowena (who is, by the way, Queen of Hell, we’ve confirmed, now), and we don’t know what he wants, why he’s there, or what he’ll do next.
“I feel pretty good, thanks. Things are going pretty well with Cas, Sam and Gabe seem to be doing okay, Jack had been away at a friend’s house, visiting, but he came home today, Shann seems to be working out well for Sam, so, yeah. I mean, there were odd things that happened this last week, but over all, yeah, I’d say I’m feeling pretty good.” Dean smiled.

“Well, unfortunately, Dean, I don’t know that I have answers to any of those questions. We might be able to find some of them under hypnosis, but this is something that I don’t think I’d feel comfortable doing without Cas being present, in case something happened and you needed help. If you got sucked into Hell, for example, even under hypnosis, I might not be able to bring you out of it. So, maybe we could look into those questions during a session where Cas comes with you? Does that sound like a good idea to you, Dean?”
“You didn’t want him to miss out,

“Well, he hadn’t been able to find me in the cabin, and he knew I hadn’t been planning on going outside. As far as he could tell, Gabe, Hannah, and Balthazar were all gone, too, when he got done talking to Amara. And then Billie showed up, and they got to talking, and they decided it would be a good idea to try to talk to the Cosmic Entity, which meant going to the Empty, so, just as I took a turn in the cabin that put me back in the same universe with them, I saw them - from behind them, so they didn’t see me - disappearing. And then, while they were gone, they found the other Lucifer, and decided he should come back with them to the Bunker; then when they got there, they found that the Bunker was heavily over-warded, and they needed Lucifer’s powers to strip some of the spells so they could get inside, and in order to make that possible, Lucifer needed a vessel. Billie, as she’s Death, literally couldn’t be a vessel if she wanted to be one, so that left Cas, and he agreed to share his vessel with Lucifer. Now, obviously, I wasn’t around to consult with on any of this, so far as Cas knew. So, he didn’t. But he had agreed not to just go haring off, and so he was concerned, and Balthazar told him that he was right to be, that I would be upset with him for it. So, he apologized, and then, when I wasn’t upset, and told him that he’d acted reasonably and properly under the circumstances, I think it maybe blew his mind a bit.”
Mia laughed. “Mmhmm. He doesn’t seem to have been upset, though.”
“Maybe not.”
“You say here that he resisted the Mark. Tell me about that.”
“I din’t cheat. Don’ gotta. I’m jus’ that good, Claire-Bear.” Dean winked at her.
“I don’t think it had really crossed his mind. I missed so much school, they had to hold me back. I knew Sammy was smart, he started reading on his own, and then I worked on it with him so he’d get better at it. I didn’t want him to miss out.”
“N-no. He….”
“No, he

“Where’d you find the kitten?” Cas called from the pantry to ask.
Cas sat down, suddenly exhausted and feeling frail.
So I took it, because it was a peace offering, even though I really didn’t care about the stupid prize.”
“I do.” Dean nodded. “It really helps to write things out. I know after I wrote that journal entry, when I talked to Cas, it helped, because I already knew what I wanted to say – it was like the entry was my script, and I could ‘read’ from it, even though I didn’t have it with me.”

Cas looked horrified for a second, then got the joke and gave a full-blown belly laugh. After a moment, Dean joined in. They both laughed until their sides ached from it.
your therapist about your drinking, yet?”
“Okay, Dean, you understand what we’re doing. You’re under hypnosis. You’re relaxed, and calm, and you’ll stay that way. Now listen to my voice, Dean. You’ll hear me, no matter what else is going on. Okay?
Dean nodded. “Yeah. He wasn’t upset that we’d run out of food, or that I’d tried to steal some. He was pissed that I got caught.”
through shit, too. No, I get it, you’re right, Claire. Thanks.”
for yourself? For the people who care about you?”
the equal of Cas in your relationship with him. He doesn’t try to put you in a subservient position to him, or, if he does, you stand up to him and tell him that he’s wrong to do so. We talked about an example of that just earlier today, Dean.”
Mia continued to read, and flushed a little; he knew she’d gotten to the part where he’d said that he trusted her not to judge him for what he chose to write about, and he smiled. She glanced up and saw the smile. “Thank you, Dean.”
“See, Dean, you don’t need me at all.” Mia winked at him.
And then suddenly that exact same freedom was terrifying. They were royals, all of them. Anyone could take them, use them as hostages, hold them for ransom. What had the grownups been thinking, not providing even a single guard? Did they
slavery was getting trained and educated by the Army?”
Clair rolled a four, and moved out of the Hall and three more squares; her turn ended.
“You say here that Lucifer wants to stop being the bad guy, now that’s he’s no longer bears the Mark of Cain; that he had it even while Cain and you had it, but now it’s gone and it’s no longer corrupting him. You had the Mark of Cain, Dean? Tell me about that.”
Jack makes a small noise in the back of his throat, and for a split second, Dean wonders if he said that out loud. He knows he didn't, though, so he just stares back, his own eyes just as wide as Jack’s. “You… what?” Jack asks, confused. “What? No. You wouldn’t do that, Dean, I know you. Castiel is… he’s
Cas doesn’t think he can take staring into Dean’s eyes for much longer, so he turns around in the bath to press his back to Dean’s chest once more. Dean’s hands rub up and down his arms, soothing him with invisible kisses below his ear, across his neck, along the top of his shoulder. “Relax,” he says softly, and his hands start to creep down to Castiel’s inner thighs. “Just let me take care of this for you.”
Definitely not Sam. Dean sits straight up in bed, curses under his breath, and runs a hand through his hair. He’s sure he looks like a complete mess. “Oh. Okay, uh, Come in, Cas!” Dean calls. He’s only just realized he’s not wearing a shirt.
“A… buddy,” Sam says, skeptical. “A buddy that hunts? Dad doesn’t like us working with outsiders. How’d you convince him to let you do that?”
you,” Dean gasps, and Cas has given up on keeping Dean’s eyes trained on him. It’s much more fun to watch the way his face contorts every time Cas curls his fingers a certain way, or pushes them as far inside as they’ll go.
Everyone else piles into the kitchen, Garth first. He wraps his arms around Dean and Charlie, his head leaning on both of theirs. “Happy Birthday, Dean,” he says softly. Benny comes up to screw up his hair, the bastard, but it makes him grin anyway. He’s wished a happy birthday by all of his friends, minus Anna. It makes him ache a little — he misses her. He knows though, that somewhere she’s sitting probably just as sad as he is that she’s missing out. He’ll give her a call when he gets home, just to see if she picks up.
“I could call the cops, you know. I was there, Mary. I saw what you did, I know where you buried it,” his dad says. He’s slurring his words, which Dean knows means that he’s gonna be meaner than normal.
he feel about Cas? Well, no. Let's start with something easier. How does he feel about men in general? Well, that's easy. They're hot, just like women are. Even when Dean's Gay Thoughts were shoved deep into the darkest corners of his mind, he still wasn't blind. There were a few times over the years where he got too drunk to care, and he allowed himself to flirt with men. Shamelessly. He had flirted his way into countless free drinks at countless bars all over the country. And he would always tell himself,
“Oh, I was,” Dean chuckles, and he slides down the wall of the bathroom to sit with his knees to his chest. “I mean, I was
He hopes that someday, he can give Cas whatever it was he didn’t want to leave behind in the Djinn dream.
Dean presses one last kiss to his nipple before he settles between Castiel’s thighs, their hips pressed flush together. He brushes a strand of hair from Castiel’s forehead with the softest, most loving smile Castiel has ever seen him with. Dean’s fingers trail down the curve of his cheekbone, and his hand finally settles on his jaw as they lock eyes. “Hi,” Dean says quietly, sweetly. Castiel’s not sure how he packed so much love and adoration into a two letter word, but he managed to do it. Castiel feels it down to his bones, Dean’s adoration for him. He wonders how he missed it for so long, when it’s so clearly scrawled into his features right now.
The last few days, Dean’s had to fight Cas to eat anything of actual substance. He just wants the sweet stuff — doesn’t matter what it is, as long as it’s sugary. It’s why Dean had downright begged Brooke to pick up some damn fruit on her grocery trip, hoping that he could get Cas to eat something that’s actually healthy. So far, his plan has worked perfectly.
Once they've made it to the garage, Dean turns on the radio and it plays through the speaker system he'd rigged up a few weeks ago. Led Zeppelin starts playing over the speaker system, and Dean's face lights right up. Having feelings sucked, but it wasn't anything some good music and a clean car couldn't fix. At least for a little while.
He held that tiny kid in his arms, and decided then that he would never drink again. He decided that the way he raised Jack would not at all reflect the way John had raised him and Sam. Which meant no more alcohol. It was a small thing to give up in order to give his son a good life.
“Who wouldn’t trust an angel?” Dean interrupts again, and Cas lets out a soft laugh.
"Okay... Cas, that was fuckin' fantastic," Dean says, dropping a kiss to his shoulder. Cas hears the familiar pop of a bottle opening, then he feels fingers digging into his scalp where Dean has begun to wash his hair.
What he finds hard to remember is just the little things, really. He doesn't remember exactly how their first kiss went, or their first time together, the first time they shared a room. He can't quite remember when exactly he moved into Dean's room, but it's fine. It just feels like everything has always been this way. That's good enough for him, at the moment. It's good enough for him forever.
Cas. You’re a good person,” he says.
that, but she’s so beautiful like this.
Jesus Christ. “My God, Cas. Orders? Your family military or something?” he asks, because he really can’t think of any other good explanation for the way Cas just worded that. It would make a lot of sense, Cas’ family having a military background. It could explain the sudden change in schooling, but even if his parents moved around, that doesn’t necessarily mean Cas would have to. Especially not in college, but if his parents are really as strict as he says they are, it definitely makes sense that they’d make him pack up and transfer schools to be closer.
Dean’s hands continue his ministrations as Castiel searches for the words. He’s sure that Dean won’t cross this line unless given explicit permission. Castiel knows that Dean understands the weight of consent in these situations. Souls are made up of something that humans can’t comprehend, yes, but memories of the human the soul belongs to are threaded into the framework. Even if everything else is stripped away by Hellfire, the memories remain. They’re what Castiel had used to rebuild the rest of the framework, all those years ago. He knows what Dean has been through. He knows that Dean won’t touch him, not there, not without a clear — and most likely verbal — affirmation.
"Yeah, I guess so, huh? Let's go to your bed for the night, hm?" Dean asks, and pries himself away from Cas with more difficulty than he'd like to admit.
Dean sinks his teeth into the meat of Castiel’s thigh. It’s not hard enough to draw blood or even leave a mark, Castiel doesn’t think, but he feels the scrape of teeth against the sensitive flesh and it makes him keen. “I do,” Dean says quietly, and Castiel allows himself to crack his eyes open for a peek.
Castiel revels in it. His whole body aches, he thinks the fever is starting to creep up on him again, and he could really go for some more of that tea, right about now. Regardless, kissing Dean takes his mind off of all of it, even though he can’t make it go away entirely. That’s okay. He can make it go away for a few seconds, and Castiel will take every last one of them and drown himself in them.
is the perfect time to keep secrets. Yeah, this is great! Fantastic, even!
Today, though,
“Get your asses out here!” Someone says. Dean’s still half asleep, so he’s not sure if it’s Brooke or Anna. It could even be Charlie or Ellen, he’s not sure. It’s still early enough that the sun isn’t entirely up, and there’s a hazy blue light coming in through the windows, the only signal to Dean that it isn’t the dead of night.
Cas just stares like he can't believe what he's hearing. He slides his hands under Dean's hoodie and maintains eye contact. He wraps his hands around to rest on Dean's hips, pushing them flush with the closet door. Dean is pretty sure his heart stops. He makes a noise that comes from the back of his throat, throwing his head back.
drunk?” Dean asks, poking him right in the center of the chest. “It’s like—“ he hiccups, “—you don’t even get drunk. Do you even get drunk?” he asks. Stupid question. Of course Cas gets drunk.
The worst doesn't come, though. Cas doesn't fall, and Dean doesn't have to fling his eyes open and see Cas fully naked in order to help him. Cas just sighs under the water, so Dean relaxes.
but suddenly he doesn’t really care all that much.
Dean kinda feels like a dick all of the sudden — what if Cas has issues with food or something? He swallows his own bite and clears his throat. “Can I ask you something?” he asks.
“You need… to drive? Where do you need to go?”
“Please what, angel?” Dean asks, untucking his head from Cas’ neck to pull him in for a kiss. As he does, he gets a hand around Cas and starts stroking him at an agonizingly slow pace.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right, sorry! Sorry. He was hit with a spell. Memory loss. Fucking witches,” Sam mutters the last sentence under his breath, and his heart skips a beat when he hears Dean’s voice—quieter than Sam’s—”Witches are
“Maybe she rode with Garth,” Cas suggests, moving to stand in front of Dean. He lays part of his hair down, adjusts the collar of his jacket, and rests his hands on Dean’s chest. “Happy Birthday, Dean,” he says once more, pulling him down by his jacket to kiss him.
“It took a lot of restraint not to give you what you asked for. I never want to deny you,” Cas admits, tilting Dean’s chin up to kiss his mouth again. “I’m still glad I didn’t, though.”
"We already watched that last week, Dean," Cas complains, but he's standing up to pop the DVD in anyways.
“So, what? They beamed upstairs and you… what? He couldn’t fly here, not without his grace, so how are you here?” he asks.
“Of course, man. You’re like, my best friend. I’m not letting you spend Christmas by yourself,” Dean repeats for the hundredth time, smiling sweetly. “C’mon. Come sit with me while I pack,” he says.
“Nope,” Charlie says, and she pops the ‘p’. “We’re already like, halfway there. Only a few more hours and we’ll be right on your doorstep. Mary gave Bobby the address when they left in case anything happened to her. We know right where you are, and we’ll be there in less than ten hours.”
“No. Dean, listen to me. Let me see if Garth will drive you home. Please, just let me ask,” Cas begs, and his grip loosens on Dean’s wrist.
Dean huffs. “Suit yourself, man.” He walks up to the counter, stands back a bit to mull over the menu before he gets in the way of anyone else that might walk in while he’s trying to decide what to order.
as always i’d love to know what you thought 🥺
“Lying to psychics will get you nowhere,” Missouri tells him. “So I’ll ask again —
“You’re insufferable,” Cas tells him, and he uses his body to pin Dean against the wall of the shower. He uses one hand to cover Dean’s mouth, and the other hand wraps around his cock. “Don’t make a
Tears are stinging at the corners of his eyes as he cradles Cas in his arms in the backseat of the Impala. He pets his hair and quietly repeats his mantra until he feels the car come to a stop. He lifts his head and he's sure there are tear tracks cutting through the dirt on his face, but he doesn't care. He just needs to get Cas inside, lay him on the bed, and get inside his head. That's all that was left to do.
Dean nods. He gets that. “Me either,” he says quietly.
Dean rolls his eyes and forces his limbs to work again as he leans forward to spin it. It lands on a girl named Cassie. She’s the only person that Dean’s had sex with more then once since getting to college. They’d hooked up in his sophomore year, and then again last year. It never went anywhere, obviously, but they remained friendly. He wouldn’t call her a
"I love it because it makes you happy when we watch it. I love it because I love
"I'm fine," Cas huffs, and he struggles to push himself up into a sitting position. Dean lets one of his hands leave Cas’ face in order to place it on his back, right between his shoulder blades. He nudges Cas forward and upward into a sitting position. He drops his hand from Cas’ face finally, but rubs slow circles into his back.
Dean curses, “I don’t have lube here.” He whines as he grinds his hips down into Cas once more, slipping his hands under his shirt to just
“Thank you, Sam,” Cas says, and Dean, at the same time, says “Hell yeah!”

im not exactly sure how much or how little i'll work on this or add stuff to it, but i'm kinda just letting this take me wherever it wants to. i've never really written a lot of smut so this chapter is sorta my way of feeling through that and seeing how well i can do it lol. its not all porn by any means but a good chunk of it is. anywayssss happy reading! <3
Dean leans in close, and they're sharing the same air now. "Well, are you gonna kiss me goodnight or do I have to do everything myself?" he teases.
tech-savvy at
The angle of his legs isn’t doing him any favors, either. He’s not going to be able to get his boxers off in this position, but he’s tired of being confined. He pulls himself out of the boxers and gasps as he gets a hand around himself.
Why in the
Dean’s fingers curl around his thigh. They apply pressure there, but only to provide comfort, never to hurt him. Not now, not like this. “Isn’t it easier if we don’t?” he asks.

Dean hadn’t noticed ‘til she asked, but his eyes sting a little, and he feels like he might cry. This is so
part of it, and honestly, Dean doesn’t blame him.
Now though,
doing it. The barbed wire around his heart digs a little deeper. It’ll never mean to Dean what it means to him. He just has to learn to be okay with it.
Jack shuffles closer then, and he sits down on Dean’s bed. He’s stiff in the exact same way that Cas always was. Not in the way that makes him look uncomfortable, but just in the way that he’s not quite sure what to do with his body, how to operate it. Dean figures that being a newborn and instantly having the body of someone in their early twenties might be a little bit of a difficult adjustment, even after close to four years.
but she just shakes her head and throws her hands up in a gesture of
Dean does.
Dean feels when it happens, feels it down his throat as Cas' hips still while his dick is buried inside Dean's mouth. He's whining and moaning and cursing, and Dean is so blissed out that he doesn't catch Cas muttering "I love you, I love you, I love you," over and over.
It’s working, too, if the noises that Dean is making for him indicate anything. He’s doing a good job, he’s providing pleasure, he’s making himself useful in the only way he knows how. He deepens the kiss, gets downright filthy with it, just the way Dean used to want it.
you need me to blow up the air mattress? I can lie and say we don’t have one so you can share your bed,” she says, poking the bear.
Anna slowly looks up to meet Dean’s eyes, pain playing on her face as clear as day.
Dean stands from the ledge of the tub then, and he walks across the room to grab a washcloth. Castiel let’s his eyes follow Dean’s form around the bathroom, until he’s coming back to the tub and dunking the washcloth into the water. He takes more soap, squeezes it onto the washcloth, and kneels behind Castiel, on the other side of the tub. “Let me help,” he says quietly, gently. Castiel is sure he’s never heard Dean use this tone of voice with him. With frightened children, maybe. Spooked spouses of victims to the supernatural. Never with him, though, and it makes him feel impossibly weaker. Dean has to lower himself for Castiel while he’s like this. He has to talk down to him, in a hushed voice, as if he’s a scared animal.
He seems to be doing a lot of crying these days.
The only way he let me come was by making myself undetectable with a spell. So I snuck around, got her grace back, tucked tail, and ran.”
Dean has just dried up his tears when he hears a soft knock at his door. He rolls his eyes. "Go away, Sammy. I'm not hungry." He grumbles. Sam has been trying to get him to eat all damn
“What was it like?” Dean whispers, “I didn’t hurt you, right?”
The next morning, he’d woken up to Jack crying. It was a new day, Cas was still dead, and he’d still had this damn kid to care for. No matter what, he was gonna get the kid through this. Even if it damn near killed him.
He curls up in his bed and falls asleep thinking about Cas’ lips against his own, and how he wishes more than anything in the world that the damn bottle had landed on him tonight instead of Meg.
It doesn't take much longer for either of them. Cas comes first with a strangled cry, which causes Dean to reach up and cover his mouth. It's the hottest thing Cas has ever experienced.
Cas darts his eyes away from Dean. “I’m sorry,” he says. “When I told you I was leaving, we had just secured it. It was supposed to be a safe flight home, but somebody must have seen me. Must have tipped off the angels. They intercepted me,” he admits.
“Yeah,” Dean croaks, and he nods.
Castiel thinks. He’ll most likely have better access and range of motion if he does. On the other hand, “The water. It’s dirty.”
for Dean. He wonders if his father ever would've warmed up to gay people, had he lived longer.
Sam humors him. “Of course not. I’m just happy for you.”
He hears… well, he hears nothing, so he pops the microwave open and dumps both bags of popcorn into a bowl. Sure enough, half the kernels aren’t popped, but he’s sure Cas will be happy. That’s what matters, anyways. He makes a beeline for the Dean Cave, smiling when he sees Cas sitting in the middle of the couch. They’d swapped out the two recliners for a couch about a month after Cas had moved in permanently. They got tired of dragging chairs from the library in there, and just splurged on a big, comfy couch.
They silently hold on to one another for an amount of time that Castiel can’t quite decipher, because any time spent with Dean feels like no time at all. Eventually, Dean’s just sniffling against his neck, and Castiel looks around. On the nightstand closest to him, there’s a small box of tissues. Without disturbing Dean too much, he’s able to reach one arm up and over to the box and pull a few of them out. He taps Dean on his shoulder and smiles as he holds out the tissues, and Dean
“So why’d you let him?” Dean snaps, and he immediately regrets it. Brooke is
Cas shrugs and picks up his sandwich, biting into it. "I swear I'm fine, Dean." He turns his attention back to the TV.
but that’s not exactly something he could tell the school board, is it? Nah. So he told them he’d had some family issues, they let him take the rest of the semester off, and come back to finish his classes next winter.
Slowly, Jack shuffles backward on his knees. He looks up at Dean with sad eyes, nearly identical to the pair he looked straight into as Cas begged him to stop, begged him just to get out of that place. Jack blinks up at him, slowly. “So tell me,” he says. “Tell me what happened.”
Dean’s already halfway to sleep when he shuffles backwards into Cas a little more, clutches Cas’ hand to his own chest, and drifts off.
“I don’t doubt it,” Cas says, and Dean spares a glance at him to see that he’s smiling again. “Are you and Anna…?” he trails off, the end of the sentence going unsaid.
“Is it really you?” Dean asks, because he has to.
“I got you guys lunch, just some sandwiches from that place on Main Street. Extra bacon for Dean,” Sam tosses one bag at them, “And no tomatoes for Cas.” He tosses the other.
His mother still hasn’t called him. He hasn’t heard from Sammy in weeks. He feels like he’s going out of his mind a little.
Cas nods, flipping his jeans open and pulling them about halfway down his thighs. He nuzzles his cheek against Dean’s cock, still trapped in his boxers, and he shuffles the jeans down to Dean’s knees so he can kick them the rest of the way off.
Dean can tell when he gets close. His thighs start to shake a little, his breathing picks up and gets stuck in his throat every few seconds, so Dean abandons his own dick in order to give Cas the attention he deserves. “Good,” he breathes into Cas’ ear. “C’mon, baby. That’s it. Love you so much, sweetheart,” and that’s all it takes to have Cas spilling over his knuckles.
As he stands over Dean, he notices the gentle rise and fall of his chest, which should probably be calming him down a hell of a lot more than it is. He thought he was saved, thought they were in the clear. Had they been too late?
“Unclear. Castiel isn’t sure, he’s never been able to tell. He knows that Dean loves him like family, at the very least. He knows that Dean would die for him, that Dean would do nearly anything for him. And that only makes him love Dean even more. But he doesn’t know. He’s never known how Dean feels about him,” Cas answers, giving Dean a squeeze.
Dean smiles even wider. “I’d sure hope so, we’ve already got a kid together,” he jokes, settling so that his head is resting on Cas’ chest. He’d never been sure, before, if Cas’ heart actually beat inside his body. The guy’s an angel, so Dean hadn’t been sure if he really
“Did we… you know…” Dean trails off and Cas feels his own face heat up at the same rate he watches Dean’s. He feels a little bit guilty. He wishes he had waited, and he knows it isn’t his fault that he didn’t, but he still wishes he had. He still wishes that their first time would get to be both of their first times.
“Okay,” Dean says, and that’s all. He turns the radio up a little and sings along under his breath to Black Dog. He doesn’t really feel like thinking too hard.
And it’s just that — just them, for the next few minutes. Dean doesn’t even know how long. He doesn’t care, either, not when he can feel Cas’ skin right below his hands like some sort of goddamn
right now, but he’s got an image to maintain, and if he’s seen in Starbucks sipping something pink with another dude sitting across from him, he knows what ideas other people might get. He’s
mom,” she teases, but she pours him a shot when she pulls away. Dean pours one for Cas and hands it over and they all down them at the same time.
Dean thinks.
— there’s nothing like it.
Dean nods, “Yeah, I know. And I know it’s not the gay thing, she’s always been fine with that. I have no
standing there with his fist raised, looking like he was debating on knocking again or just walking away.
Dean had grabbed her hand before she could walk out of the room. “Mom,” he’d said. “They’re just fireworks. It’s the Fourth.”
Dean bites into his toast, and he feels bile rise up in the back of his throat. His only family is
He nods his head, lets his fingers curl up so he can squeeze Cas’ wrist right back. “Okay. Just let me know when you want me to take you home, okay?”
The never-ending predictability of driving through the midwest puts Dean at ease. Cornfield after cornfield, passing mile markers on the interstates and the flashes of headlights from other drivers. All of it feels so familiar, it's easy to let himself get lost in it. The purr of Baby's engine as he coasts her down the freeway makes it feel a little easier to breathe. Dean lets Sam and Cas take turns choosing which tape to throw on. (Maybe he's gotten a little soft, he doesn't mind letting Sam and Cas pick the music as much anymore. They're all from his own collection, anyways.)
And that’s just it. The other young hunters dotted around the country, ‘
like no one else, too. Knows him, inside and out, because - soul or not - Dean watched him create himself. Day by day, year by year. He watched the faltering decisions and the first feelings and he watched those feelings turn into love. He
For a minute or so, Cas just looks at him, but in the end he smiles. It’s the kind of smile that most people wouldn’t pick up on, the barest twitch of lips and narrowing of the eyes, but Dean is fluent in Cas and answers in kind.
happy, because this is something new. There’s a word, he’s sure of it, but it’s just out of his reach.
, he said. Well Dean must be broken, because happiness couldn’t be further away without Castiel by his side. He’s spent too damn long without Castiel by his side.
He wonders, idly, how many times the two of them have said ‘I love you’ without ever
Dean doesn’t know who he is on his own. He’s never had to. Even when he was alone before, all those years ago, he had the job. Now he has nothing, just himself, and this isn’t how it was supposed to go.
And he can’t really ask for more than that.
But Dean’s not an idiot. He knows there’s more to it than that. Because he knows how this goes.
“Okay,” Cas says, as if he’d been convinced, as if he ever really needed convincing.
Cas nods. “We’re meeting for dinner on Friday.”
“You could’ve had me, Cas. This whole damn time.”
“How?” He asks eventually, when the silence starts to get too heavy. There’s so much more he wants to ask, so much more he wants to say, but he can’t yet find the courage. Right now, this is all he needs to know.
And they do. The rest of their damn lives.
“I guess we are.”
If there’s one good thing about the wet spring they’ve had, though, it’s that now the garden is thriving. A late frost killed off a few plants, which Cas discovered on a morning that was probably worse for Dean’s health than the plants, but that’s long forgotten. The grass has sprung up overnight, suddenly desperately in need of a cut, the trees are full and vibrant green, and the little vegetable garden outside the kitchen is looking anything but little. Cas has been talking about expanding it all winter, and after running out of space for the spring crops Dean thinks he’s probably right that they need a bit more room. There’s plenty of outside space, it just comes down to someone (read: Dean) putting aside some time to construct the new planters, and another trip into town for seeds. If they’re lucky, they might be able to plant out a few crops before summer gets fully underway, and will be able to enjoy fresh produce well into late autumn.
Dean wants to go to him. He’s never wanted anything more. But he stops himself, keeps himself rooted to the spot because he can’t - not with Lucifer’s face so fresh in his mind, grinning while Dean’s heart shatters
Not that he won’t be there to help - as long as he’s still breathing he’ll be there to help when they need him - but for the most part he thinks his job is done.
even, though the thought may be blasphemous. He used to be an angel, used to smite demons and monsters with a glance or a snap of his fingers. Now, he’s this: human, ageing, fragile as the rest of them.
But this
In fact, their first case since buying the house had come halfway through moving in, and they’d left rooms full of cardboard boxes and plies of clothes / crockery / amateur beekeeping equipment / books, fiction / books, occult / assorted gardening and mechanic’s tools / guns, machetes, stakes of various holy wood, ritual knives and the herbs to accompany them (delete where appropriate) scattered around the house. It ended up a standard salt-and-burn, except this time ending with a concussion, some bruised ribs, a swollen ankle, a couple bloody noses, and a fractured clavicle between them. This was due, depending on who you asked, to the spirit being particularly aggressive (Dean), a run of impressively improbable bad luck (Cas), or the brittle bones and slow reflexes associated with Dean and Cas’ advanced age (Sam, Claire, and - perhaps most hurtfully - Jody). No matter who was right (Dean), it put them out of commission for more than a few weeks. And then after that they took another few weeks to well and truly settle into their new house before they finally took on their next case.
. And here he is, in a bunker underground the same as he has been for years, only now he’s on his own. No family, no friends, and no Cas.
“Dean…” is all Sam says, softly, like Dean might break. Which is fair, although it’s far too late for that.
“I need to water the plants.”
He hasn’t been back here in 12 years. If he’s honest with himself, he’d hardly believed it would still be here, all these years later. Not when it was derelict even back then, and not when the years have been so unkind. But here it is. And here he is.
- he gets Cas back.
“Is it really you?”
and he’s -
Even if there’s nothing we can do. Even if nothing can make this better. Even if he never comes back.
Sam calls, not long after Dean finds his way back to the car. He pulls over on a quiet coastal road, and picks up the phone.
There are so few places left that he hasn’t been, so many memories scattered across the country, and so few of them good. Hunts and fights, last stands and losses, an apocalypse here and a funeral pyre there. There’s barely anywhere left he can drive without facing some reminder of everything he’s done, and everything he’s lost.
“Cas?”
And now it’s… Not.
All because he fell.
At first he thinks he’s driving to Sam.
“So what now?”
Huh. Who’d’ve thought.
“Oh, I have no fucking idea.”
“Jack,
And there must be something in his voice, because Sam just says, “Okay.”
He knows the bunker may not be his home for much longer, can already feel his attachment waning, but right now it’s all he has. It’s kept him safe, all these years, and right now he needs to feel safe. No matter that it’s too big a home for just him. No matter that the halls echo with loss. No matter that there’s nothing there for him there any more. No family and no friends and no Cas.
And he’s seen that grin often enough to know what it looks like without having to turn his head now. It’s the grin Sam likes to call his ‘honestly, officer, it wasn’t me’ look, which has a success rate of approximately 3% but he still insists on trying every time. It’s the same look as when someone sets up his joke perfectly without meaning to, or when he gets handed the perfect circumstances to quote his favourite movies, or a case related excuse to dress himself (or Cas) up as a cowboy.
“Yeah, I will,” Sam says, instead of ‘goodbye.’
He thinks
It was never supposed to be just him.
At first, he prays to Jack. After all, that makes more sense. At least Jack is still alive.
, telling himself that he needs to feel it before he can move on, that in time it’ll pass and it won’t hurt so much - but it never works. It consumes him until there’s nothing else but agony and anguish and still no angel by his side.
Sam doesn’t know what to say to that, so he doesn’t. Dean is tired, he’s so tired. He’s tired of being alone, and he’s tired of wanting, and more than anything he’s tired of not being able to fix this.
- for each other.
. And yet, after everything, after all the horrors he’s seen, he can’t face an extra space in a motel room.
He’s not just happy. He’s
He turns, and Dean is lost. Just like in the dungeon, just like a dozen times before, with his heart in his throat and his stomach churning and
Sam isn’t coming back.
It almost sounds stupid, that someone who not two days ago faced Lucifer and Michael and God himself would be afraid of something so small. But Dean gets it. Lucifer and Michael and God - that’s nothing. They’ve faced shit like that a dozen times over. Dean doubts there’s a monster or an apocalypse that could scare either of them, now, but the future - a real,
He knows, one day, that the texts will peter out. He knows it doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Their dependence on each other, the attachment bordering on obsession, is beginning to fade away. And it doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Though there’s that niggling feeling of abandonment that might never go away, Sam is still his brother. They will always be there for each other, although maybe not always
Where they’re not scarred, his hands are rough, years of misuse wearing away at what was once soft skin. Delicate, even, but his hands haven’t been delicate for decades. The years have hardened him; not just his hands, not just his joints. He remembers, once, he was full of youthful optimism, naive hope that he could make the world better. He wonders when that man perished. How many tragedies and losses it took for him to die his bloody death.
“Hey, Sam.”
death. He was certain of it, though he’d hoped through it all for a happier ending. Dreamed of falling in love and settling down, and having the kind of life that other people have. But he never really believed it. No, it would end with his body going cold, that’s what he’d always thought.
But even the flies aren’t enough to dampen his mood. Just this time last week the day passed without even a glimpse of the sun, and now here they are squinting against the light and preparing for the heat. It’s come as a bit of a surprise - Dean having just about convinced himself summer wouldn't come this year - but a welcome change.
They took longer breaks than they ever used to, sure. But they had still been hunting.
for the first time. And nothing else matters.
Cas feels Dean smile against his head. No, not smile. He feels him
Dean must sleep at some point, because he wakes to sunlight breaking through the rusted holes in corrugated metal and water dripping on his face. It takes him a moment to remember where he is, and when he does he wishes it had taken longer.
but up there in the big leagues with
for Christ’s sake. They were out there, and they were kicking ass, and he wasn’t one of them any more.
He used to be able to take this all in his stride. Now, it seems, it’s his stride that’s the damn problem. He can hardly move without hurting himself, can’t allow himself the time to heal, so the injuries linger. They fester, cause new problems and new weaknesses with every passing month.
The rain starts when he’s only a few miles away. It seems to skip the beginning, the first few tentative drops, and skips straight to the part where the hammering of water is deafening and Dean can hardly see through the windshield. He expects it, then, when the lighting strikes and the thunder follows. Tonight, he doesn’t try to fight the thoughts he knows will come; thoughts of a derelict barn (somehow still standing), flying sparks (literally), and Cas, and Cas, and
, you
. Just like all those years ago, with Sam far away at Stanford and no one else to call.
It’s almost painful to watch. Sam is so
“He always comes back, Sammy. I need him to come back.”
Now, though - now, he hasn’t even

And Sam, like always, seems to know exactly what he’s thinking.
they say it. It sometimes gets to be a problem with other people, used to a slightly faster pace of conversation, but here - just the two of them, in their home - it’s just normal. Dean isn’t sure how he feels, needs a moment to think about it, and Cas will happily wait until he figures it out.
Sam texts him little things, like what he had for lunch, or what he and Eileen have got up to that day, or sometimes just
“No, Sam,” Dean hardly recognises his own voice. It’s raw and it’s broken, but it’s okay. “This is a good thing.”
researching and theorising and plotting ever more elaborate attempts at revenge on Dick Roman. All in-between getting caught up on his favourite telenovelas, of course, but at the end of the day even doctor-prescribed-Sammy-enforced bedrest could only go so far.
As it turns out, neither of them really know how to live a normal life. It’s hardly surprising, because they’ve never really had the chance, but Dean thought between the two of them they’d dreamed about it enough to have at least
“I know you miss him too.”
Sam sighs, sympathy rather than annoyance, because there’s nothing he can do to make this better. There’s nothing any of them can do. It’s not the kind of sigh that should make Dean feel like a burden, but it does anyway. Suddenly, it’s all too much, the phone call and the car and
“I can’t do this without you. I don’t
“We should go and see Sam,” Dean says, while they’re still sitting there wondering where they’ll go. “Tell him you’re back.”
, it’s been
him home.
“Why Maine?” he asks, delicate like Dean might spook. Which is fair, because he does.
The needle stings, just like he remembered, but it feels good. He watches the blood beading up through the skin and the ink settling in beneath. It feels good. Eventually the pain fades away and he feels numb again, but that’s okay.
It hurts, but he doesn’t change his course. He drives along the edge of the lake for as long as he can, and thinks about Cas - and it hurts, and it hurts, and that’s okay, because it’s what he deserves.
“Why not?” It comes out more aggressive than he meant. He takes a breath, wills himself to calm down, but doesn’t trust himself to speak again.
Dean keeps driving.
“You’re going to make me a new planter?”
“I think we’re retired.”
He’d be angry, that’s for sure. Disappointed, too, but angry first. Always angry first. Dean winces against an imagined blow. Enough of that.
From then he drives slower still, over hallowed ground.
Dean waits a few hours more anyway. And then a little longer. And then a little longer.
Dean doesn’t know how this is supposed to go, but he’s done being afraid. He’s done holding the truth at the back of his throat and choking through the days. He’s done hiding, he’s done pretending, and he’s done grieving for all the time they’ve lost to fear. Because there will never be a right time, but there will always be a
Between them they’ve just about got the whole next year planned out ahead of them, and that’s not even taking into account their plans for the house itself. A whole year on this little patch of land. A whole other year in this house.
“I don’t want him to save my life. I want him here.”
He’s always kind of hated being here alone, and that was with the knowledge that someone would be coming home soon. Now, there’s no one coming home. There’s no one out on a hunt, or at the store, or driving across the country just to be here. It’s just him.
He makes his way to the edge of the cliff and sits as close to the edge as he dares (which is very close, as someone who has faced God and won. As someone who has lost more than he could ever stand to lose. As someone with so little left to care about.)
“Yeah. Let’s do it then.”
Cas rolls his eyes. Dean is nothing if not charmingly predictable.
They go back to the bunker, because of course they do. Dean has nowhere else, and Sam - well. Sam does have somewhere else if he wants, but he’s scared.
The doors open less gracefully for him than they did for Cas. They open less gracefully even than they had for him and Bobby, even more rusted and stiff than they had been before. But it doesn’t matter. Grace is overrated, and the doors open all the same.
he’d end up here.
And this time, he knows what he’s looking for. It’s not a lake or a barn or a hundred miles of wilderness calling him. It’s a neon sign above a glass-fronted shop.
After that, things slowed down even more. It was three months before their next case. Five until the one after that. The year after that passed with only three cases and Dean was only realising
“They’ve had three months of rain, Cas. They’ll live.”
He knows why he’s here, always knew he’d wind up here in the end, even if he knows it doesn’t make sense. Just because Cas came to him here once before, doesn’t mean he will again. But this is
At first he thinks it must mean trouble. A stranger in the rain always means trouble. But then he gets closer and he’s not so sure. And Dean doesn’t quite believe it, but he knows that coat, and that hair, and those shoulders hunched against the rain. He knows because he’s been here a dozen times before, with his heart in his throat and his stomach churning and
Then it was a ghost (slipped disk, bruised ego, two months off), a coven of amateur witches getting ideas above their station (more bruised ribs, a sprained ankle, 5 weeks off), a minor deity (concussion, broken wrist, strained groin (don’t ask), 9 weeks off), salt-and-burn (no major injuries, 3 weeks off), and then, in what Dean thinks might have been the beginning of the end, a town caught in the crossfire between a gang of demons and a few rogue angels that, apparently, hadn’t gotten the memo that all their generals had thrown in the towel years ago after a bad case of Winchesteritus.
“You need to go to the store to get more food for your dog.”
There’s a bottle of whiskey in the car, because he made sure there would be, and then there’s a bottle of whiskey in his hand, because that’s where he needs it to be.
He watches the sunrise from the driver's seat of his car, like he has so many times. Halfway between his brother and an abandoned barn, with the sun breaking through the clouds and shattering against the windshield.
“Hello, Dean.”
. Started to want the thing he could never have.
So he prays.
“Where are you, Dean? I could come-“
Part of him wishes there was a hunt. Something to be chasing, something to
“I miss him, Sam.”
(But has he ever really been strong enough? Hasn’t it destroyed him, every time he’s lost Cas? Isn’t it destroying him now? But hasn’t he survived it, every time, even when he didn’t want to?)
So he keeps going. He keeps driving. Let’s the road call him on even without knowing where it leads.
choking back any words that might come to mind. All he can do is stand there, and stare, those blue eyes staring back and everything just a little blurry from the rain or tears or both.
And Dean can’t be angry about it, because they’ve ended up
He sleeps for a few hours, not because he’s tired, exactly, just that he can’t go on. He sleeps for a few hours, until the sun has come up and the road is just a road again, and then he crosses into Illinois.
He doesn’t say where he is, or where he’s going, and Sam doesn’t ask. He doesn’t say ‘I miss you’, and Sam doesn’t ask. He doesn’t say much of anything, but he doesn’t have to. Sam understands.
In a house of their own, sitting on the porch as the sun rises gently over the trees, as safe and untroubled as Dean has ever been.
“After that?”
He doesn’t bother looking for the exact spot. It would be pointless. It’s been 8 years since he’s been here, but time can’t erase a memory that was barely there to begin with. It’s been 8 years since purgatory spat him out in these woods in the middle of the night, and he barely remembers it at all. It blurs in with the whole year - hunger and exhaustion and brutality and fear - but for one difference. On top of it all, it was a night of yet another loss.
“I know. I know you do,” Sam sighs, in sympathy rather than annoyance. It helps, somehow, to hear the pain there that Dean is feeling. “I do, too - I know it’s not the same, but I do. I miss him too.”
He’d dreamed of a happy ending, and dreaded a bad one, but he doesn’t know what to do with this. This sort of in-between, mediocre ending. He supposes it’s more realistic. Life isn’t about happy endings or bad endings, not
. It’s not
. And if there’s a part of him that hates that this is the first time, it’s dwarfed by the part of him that is just happy they got here at last. Cas is with him, and he loves him, and for the first time in a long time belonging doesn’t feel like such a burden.
It’s a delicate, fragile thing, pink-white ink and just the barest suggestion of a handprint. And it’s perfect. It’s burden, and it’s belonging, and it’s
Dead doesn’t mean gone. Not always. Especially not for them.
It’s been a week. In one way the days have flown by, but in another they’ve dragged on endlessly. It doesn’t make sense, but it doesn’t have to, because there’s only him and Sam left and they both know how it feels.
Because there’s a whole new generation of hunters out there, and they were kicking ass, and he wasn’t one of them any more.

The child nodded, and he saw tear tracks. He handed her a tissue, but said nothing. She wiped her eyes, and looked away, embarrassed.
monster. And he dragged me and Sam along on the road. By the age of eight, I knew how to shoot and to field-strip several kinds of guns. I knew how to make box mac’n’cheese, or heat up canned pasta. I knew how to budget, and could really stretch a dollar. I knew how to salt the windows and doors of our motel room. And Dad would leave us in a motel room, alone, for two or three days at a time, while he was off hunting. It was my job to keep Sammy fed, and safe.”
“Do we have any canned tuna?” Dean asked.
“So, Dean, how was this week?”
“So, when you begged for pain, you weren’t actually asking for pain,
“Dean? Are you okay?” Claire peered up at him.
“What did she use for your DNA?” Mia inquired.
“Cassie Robinson. She was my first-ever real, long-term relationship. I thought I loved her, I really did. She was in college, and she was amazing. So, I told her the truth. I wasn’t just going around the country with Dad, working construction. We were hunters of supernatural creatures, trying to get revenge on the thing that had killed my mother. And she thought I was

Mia quirked a brow at Dean, but said nothing more about the background information he’d provided. “You say here that Cas never mentioned a problem with

one. I think she might be, realistically, your only choice for a therapist.
“Well, let me read on, here, then, since you say you wrote about the dream.” Mia continued to read. “This bit here is a little disturbing, Dean. You write that Alastair had you on the rack, and he told you that he’s dead, so the only way he can affect you is when you come to him in your dreams, and then he intimates that you’ve done so, previously. You write that he told you that ‘You want the pain, Dean. You crave it. You need it. I put that need in you, and it has never diminished. Oh, you can resist it, for a while. And when you start to actively seek it out, Castiel tries to shepherd you away from it. And he succeeds, for a while. But you always end up back here, eventually. Of course, he soothes you, wipes away the memory of the ‘bad dream,’ sometimes even before you awaken. But you always come back, Dean.’ Have you had dreams of Alastair before, Dean, that you can remember? Did you ask Castiel if he had been preventing such dreams, or removing the memories of them?”
“I absolutely will scream with you. C’mon, let’s do it. Right now.” He looked her right in the eye, and bellowed.
One of them, a little girl named Andrea Wills, had lost her left leg, from just below the knee down, to cancer. She had multiple myeloma, and was going through radiation and chemotherapy, hoping not to need any further surgery, and desperately trying to keep up her stamina and muscle mass. If she lost too much muscle mass, walking with the prosthetic might prove too difficult, and Andrea was determined not to be in a wheel chair one second longer than she absolutely had to be. That was a goal Gadreel could get behind, and he wanted her parents’ permission to work with her more than once a week. They weren’t sure insurance would cover the cost, and he was tempted to tell them he’d do the work for free. It would be worth it to him when Andrea was walking again.
“Of course, Dean.”
“Sure. I trust Cas. I trust you, for that matter, but I get what you’re saying, Mia.” Dean smiled at her, and she felt like maybe he was coming back out of the odd funk he’d sunk into so rapidly for a bit there. She smiled back.
“And Ellen?”
“Oh, that’s very sweet, Dean. And then the last thing here, or so it appears, is a letter to Zachariah. Who’s that, Dean?”
? And not quite three weeks later, you drank nine bottles of beer?” Cas’ anger was all the more powerful for being extremely controlled. He wasn’t even raising his voice, but Dean knew exactly how far across the line he’d gone.
“Dean, you’re the best friend I’ve ever had. The best friend I never expected to have. I lived for eons, and I had family, brothers and sisters, but I never had a friend, much less a best friend. And now I have you, and Sam, and Claire, and Jody, and Donna, and Alex, and … the person I’ve been speaking with since I left the bunker, I think she’s a friend, now, too. But you, you’re right, Dean, you mean more to me than the others do. Nothing against them, of course, it’s just that what you and I have is…
An omega, owning land. Not absolutely unheard of, sure, but one with Dean’s background and history? Pfft. Not to be thought of. But Cas….
“Good job, Dean. I’m going to count backward from ten, and you’re going to wake up, and feel very relaxed and calm, okay? Ten…nine…eight…seven…six…five…four…three…two…one.”
mean to discount her feelings. I wasn’t trying to hurt her. I was saying no to what I felt was an overly generous offer because I thought she should keep her money for herself because she deserves to have good things happen to her. Cas told her a little bit of what I’ve been through, and why I generally don’t like to take things from people, and after that, she and I talked, and we made up.”
“Jody offered me a beer. I turned it down the first time, asked for a glass of water. But I finished that off, and she offered again, and….”
He went to answer it, and peered through the spyhole. He sighed and opened the door, and waved Pam inside.
Dean's therapy session continues.
Pam sighed softly. “I’m sorry, Gad.”
“No.” Dean blushed. “But I still could’ve made a better effort, regarding realizing what Cas wanted and needed. That was my point, there. Not that he would’ve been happy with a flimsy substitute.”

The other ways might take more time – there’s always a justification, an excuse, for the choice; but it is the choice I make, Cas. And yes, I feel guilty for it – later – but during? There’s nothing like it, Cas. The power, the rush. It’s addicting. It… it scares me how much I like it.

“Well, that this is a
“Okay. Now, you write here that Cas asked to speak with Amara alone after the meeting, so you all cleared out to give them some privacy, and the rest of you went around painting over the wards. And then you realized that their after-meeting meeting was taking too long, so you went in to interrupt, and found that they were gone. And around that same time, you write here, that Gabe realized that Sam could be in danger, because ‘Amara’s reason for giving Lucifer the choice of the Empty or the Cage in the first place had been to have the option of keeping the power of an Archangel in the universe, without having to recreate it, which only God knew how to do. That meant that Lucifer and Michael both retained all of their power as Archangels, and they weren’t merely ‘memories with intent’ as Lucifer had been insisting. If Lucifer was lying about that, he could have been lying about everything, about the Mark, about being on your side, about Michael’s sanity – for if Lucifer had his powers, he could certainly make it appear that Michael was sane, when, in fact, he was still loony, and no real reason had ever been given for Michael’s supposed return to mental health.’”
“Oh, yeah. It’s raining. Caught me just as I was trying to get the front door open.”
“No. If anything, I... I might be a sadist. I’ve tortured people - not in a fun sexy way, I don’t do it for the sexual rush or anything like that - but I’ve done it, and I’ve enjoyed it. That’s discussed later, as well. But wanting pain? No.
that you said that?” Cas growled.
“Stanford.”
“When I said that when he wasn’t listening to me, I pointed it out, and made him listen, about the suggestion of looking for Joshua. Yeah. I see what you’re saying, Mia.”
Despite the caffeine, he found himself nodding off, and yawning widely, after about thirty minutes of paperwork. He set an alarm on his phone for 8:00, and laid down on the couch in his office, facing the back of the couch. He fell asleep almost instantly.
Dean left the garage a little late that night. It was on the cool side, and he was regretting having left the house that morning without hat or gloves or scarf, but it wasn’t far to go to get home, so rather than call and disturb Cas (who was probably making their dinner) for a ride, he was just hoofin’ it as fast as he could.
Dean weakly sat back down on the couch. “Huh.”
Dean scrubbed his hand slowly over his face. “Yeah. I get it.”

“If I push you away, at least when you leave, it’s not because you
Mia laughed. “And then you pointed out to Cas that he was going to be a Winchester, and he hadn’t realized, and you say that ‘he looked so happy, so excited, and I realized a last name was something I could have given him years ago, just by making him a fake ID. I felt horrible that I’d never grasped before how important something like that might be to him. I swear, I’m going to spend the rest of forever making it up to him.’ Dean, do you really think that giving Cas a fake ID with the name ‘Castiel Winchester’ on it would have made Cas anywhere near as happy as getting that name by marrying you does?”
“Another demon. But Meg was different. She was one of Azazel’s, too, but I think he maybe pulled her out of the Pit too soon, because she retained a lot of her humanity – unlike most demons, she could still remember back to when she’d been alive, being human and what it was like. Like I say in the letter, she redeemed herself.”
“Did he hit you before the fire, Dean?”
“Thanks, Mia.” He seated himself on the couch, and handed over his journal. Mia thumbed through to the page where they’d last left off the week before.
“She died again. Jack killed her. It was an accident. He’s got so much power, and really he’s only about three years old, he doesn’t always have the best judgment regarding how to use it. Mom was pestering him – she does that when she thinks someone she loves isn’t taking care of themselves; she worries, and she pesters and pokes – and he couldn’t handle it, and he told her to go away and leave him alone, and he killed her with a thought. Cas has confirmed that Mom and Dad are both in Heaven, together and happy – I think I mentioned that in my letter to Dad.”

He thinks about Sam and Eileen and him. He thinks about
And Castiel looks at him, with that fond look in his eyes, and says; “Hello, Dean.”
. It was days and it was weeks and it
Dean is tired, and he wants to go home. Even though Cas won’t be there, and even though he knows he’ll be just as lonely there as he is on the road, he’s also too tired to fight it any more. At least he can be lonely in his own bed.
When they moved in they were still hunting, at least semi-regularly. Dean isn’t as young as he used to be and even Cas, though being older than literally the entire human race has of course never bothered him, was more troubled by his recent humanity than he really liked to let on in what passed, for them, as polite company. Neither of them had the young hunter’s life left in them, any more; the all-nighters researching, the all-day recon that sometimes lasted upwards of a week, another all-nighter chasing after the ghost or monster or occasional god-or-god-adjacent-entity (and then another all-nighter, when it turned out their research and/or recon had been slightly off all along, and they had to chase down the
Some nights, when the pain in his neck and his back and his knees and -
Cas hums in reply, and Dean can feel it in his shoulder where Cas’ head rests. It’s a nice feeling - not quite as nice as when Dean lies with his head on Cas’ chest and listens to him talk late at night or first thing in the morning, but it’s close enough. It’s the rare kind of feeling that gives him the courage to say something he’s afraid to, so he does.
’, and Dean didn’t even think to offer. Sam and Eileen were closer, he thought, and so were Jody and Donna and the rest of the girls, not to mention any one of the other young hunters dotted around the country these days.
And it’s that, hearing the confirmation - even though he knew, and even though he said it - that nearly sends him over the edge. Cas, knowing as usual before it even happens, places a hand on Dean’s knee and that’s just about enough to hold him together.
He remembers, last time he left Maine behind him, he still saw Cas. His imagination, a hallucination on the side of the road. A product of guilt and loss and -
And Dean’s angry, because it wasn’t
‘I love you.’ He wonders, laboriously, how many times the two of them might have said ‘I love you’ if they had more time. If they weren’t cowards.
Just him, and the road, and a dozen other lonely people driving alone in the dark.
It begins with the miles vanishing under the wheels of the Impala, with open roads, with clear skies and the sun beating down. It begins with music played too loud, or not loud enough, and laughing just because they were together. With a stop for burgers at a run-down diner. With bickering giving way to the companionable sort of silence. With beers cracked on the hood of the car as the sun set and the stars came out.
Dean feels guilty he hasn’t called, but at the same time how could he? It’s not the kind of news to give over the phone. And they’ve been busy, making up for lost time. Sam will understand.
Though that’s not to say they’ll never hunt again. Dean knows that’s not how this goes, remembers with a stab of guilt how many times Bobby got dragged out on a hunt, or Rufus, or any of the other hunters who would probably have much rather stayed at home. But things are different now. There’s been no pending apocalypse for a few years - no last-night(s)-on-Earth, no this-is-it-so-say-goodbye-while-you-can - and though Dean knows it’s only a matter of time before there is, he also thinks maybe that’s not his problem any more. Because there’s that new generation of hunters out there coming into their own; kicking ass, ganking ghouls, more than capable of handling whatever the world throws at them next.
Cas kisses him again, fleeting, a promise of more to come.
He’s retired. He tries the words out again in his head.
“The second one.”
lake where he lost Cas so close to the bunker where he’s lived all these years, but now’s not the time for him to start pretending he understands what goes on in his head.
There’s a pause on the other end, and Dean can practically see Sam’s eyebrows furrow as he tries to figure it out. Evidentially, he doesn’t manage it.
The bunker begins to feel like a home again. It begins to feel
“I love you,” Cas says, just like before, his lips brushing against the side of Dean’s head in what is so very nearly a kiss. Dean smiles, and holds tighter.
- scorched on him. He thinks of how selfish Cas is, for claiming him once again without asking for permission, and then leaving him. Again. He thinks that, despite it all, that claim is the best gift Cas ever gave him, and that not even giving him a chance to claim him back is the worst. He thinks about how that was the last place Cas touched him. Might be the last place Cas ever touched him.

It sounds far too sappy to say out loud in the daylight, even just to Cas, and besides he probably doesn’t have to say it anyway. Instead, he just says;
“I’m going to make you a new planter,” Dean says, and Cas’ smile spreads to the rest of his face. It’s one of those almost-gummy smiles that used to be rare, but nowadays aren’t nearly as uncommon. It makes Dean’s heart do things too sappy to discuss in the daylight, something that is also apparently far less rare than it used to be. “Now come back to bed with me.”
(But it hurts, and it hurts, and it-)
“He knew, Dean.”
It’s the kind of question Dean used to brush off, but he doesn’t do that so much any more. Cas only asks because he cares enough to hear an honest answer, so that’s what Dean tries to give him.
A little better, but still weird. It probably would’ve been easier if he’d known he was retiring before he did it, rather than six months after the fact.
“Race you,” he says, and though sometimes they do still race to bed, he doesn’t move now and neither does Cas.
Dean is happy for him. That’s the side of it he shows. That’s the side of it Sam needs to see.
“Hey, Dean.”
With both of them behind him, Des Moines and Pontiac and everything Dean can’t stand to think about, he can breathe a little easier.
He’d give anything to be back in that god-forsaken barn, broken and bloody from the horrors he’d seen, unprepared for the horrors yet to come. To meet Castiel for the first time, to fall in love again. To make different choices, better choices, save them all the time they’ve lost between hesitance and fear. To give himself fully to the man he –
He remembers the days when a handprint on his shoulder was an embarrassment, a weight of a different kind. Burden rather than belonging. Something he hid and that Sam teased him about and that he’d have given anything to be rid of. He doesn’t remember when that changed, can’t remember a moment he
. And it’s not a bad thing.
The bunker is quiet. It’s always been quiet, out of the way and buried underground, but now it’s
. But he remembers what it felt like after. To realise Cas isn’t really there. Again. He’s not so certain he could cope with that.
The bunker feels like a home again, but it’s not perfect. It doesn’t feel like a home he wants to spend forever in. Though he has so many memories here, and many of them happy, he thinks maybe it’s time he started making new memories. He thinks maybe it’s time he and Cas started making new memories together, somewhere else.
Castiel didn’t come. And he isn’t coming.
And Sam, like always, seems to know exactly what he’s thinking.
And there are still moments of noticeable joy, like lazy mornings in bed with Cas, or dinners with the extended family. Or when Cas drags him out to look at the latest flower in their garden, or Miracle jumps on his lap in the morning for his cuddle and ear scratch (shut up Sam). But when the moments are over, there’s no stepping back into the shit. There’s no crushing despair when his mood slips back to the baseline.
But then again... Dean figures, in for a penny and all that -  what would Mom think?
She’d likely understand it, having tried to leave the life before Dean even was born - or rather, Dean was born
Cas flipped the script. He was always good at that, right from the start, and for a while there Dean thought he was used to it. But now here he is, collapsed on the floor with a bloody handprint on his shoulder and he
He finds his way back to Chicago, eventually. This time, instead of passing through, he parks up and gets out of the car. After so long alone on the road, he expects the sheer number of people to be overwhelming - like last time he came to a city after Maine, fresh out of purgatory and so afraid of everyone that wasn’t him or Cas or Benny - but it’s not. This time, he doesn’t feel anything.
Dean takes his hand. And it’s home, and it’s freedom, and it’s the only future he wants. It’s the kind of belonging that could never feel like a burden.
