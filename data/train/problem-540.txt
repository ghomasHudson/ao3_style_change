“All taken care of, for a bit at least.  I’ve got Thompson getting her to Albus and Scorpius right now.”
John chuckled and nodded.  “Right then, no bikes.  Are you still a fan of that pig show?  Maybe you can ask for something from that?”
“If you’re the one to say it,” John replied before he could stop himself.  He mentally cringed as Harry spun to face him, her dead eyes now lit with fury and sorrow.
“My brother will make sure to expedite our results and send them to you before the first performance,” Sherlock reassured him as he headed toward the door. “I’ll need you to send me all information you have on customers who have attended more than one week’s performance. John will be in contact with you tomorrow to get whatever information is necessary prior to next week.” Just as he was about to leave, he turned back to the two women. “If you’d like, I can arrange for police surveillance on your home and jobs until we catch the culprit.”
“That should keep things cosy and hopefully nuisance free,” he said.  He spotted John and Sherlock and his free arm swung out in welcome.  “John!  It’s good to see you looking fit and well!  Is this the Sherlock we keep hearing so much about?”
“We’re even now then.” Sherlock simply nodded and they began the process of untangling themselves from each other. When Sherlock rose to his feet, John couldn’t help but burst into giggles, falling back on the pillow. Sherlock’s brows furrowed as he looked over himself and realised what was so amusing – a hand print, roughly the size of John’s palm, was dripping a slow line of come down one of Sherlock’s thighs. Looking back up at John, Sherlock raised a single questioning eyebrow down at John.
!” John shouted, dashing forward and letting the shield fall to examine him.  “Jesus, Sherlock, when I tell you to stay down, you fucking need to
By the time John finished reading the final message, the mobile began buzzing in his hand with a call, Sherlock’s picture popping up in the middle of the screen.  Grinning to himself, John swiped to answer.
“Don’t you worry about it, I’ve got it all settled,” John interrupted as they reached the front of the library.  He grabbed their coats from where he left them on an empty table and helped Sherlock into his.  “All you’ve got to do tonight is enjoy.”
“Shh, baby girl, it’s fine, you’re fine,” John said as he stroked her hair.  She shifted around so that she could cry against John’s front instead, one of each of her fists clutched desperately in both of their jackets.  John placed a soft kiss against her forehead before doing the same to Sherlock.  He met Sherlock’s eyes, which also glittered with barely contained tears.  “He’s gone, he can’t come back.  You’re safe now, both of you.”
“Next week’s performers definitely won’t show now,” Niall muttered, running a hand through his hair. “Honestly, I don’t blame them. We might have to cancel until we figure out what’s going on.”
“We found another note,” John explained. “There was a possible semen sample on it, so he ran off to see if he could get anything out of it.”
John would have loved a lie in and to enjoy a lazy morning with Sherlock, but unfortunately they had a baby living in the flat.  Exactly as always, Cecelia started to make noises over the monitor to indicate that she was stirring just as the sun had reached a point to peak through the curtains.  John blinked his eyes open and stared over at it on Sherlock’s side table.  At some point in the night, they had shifted around so that Sherlock was draped across John.  His halo of curls sprawled haphazardly across John’s chest, a line of drool trailing where his heart lay, and he grasped John tight around the middle while one leg lay thrown over his thighs.  Though the position was a bit warmer than John preferred, the knowledge that Sherlock automatically gravitated to him in his sleep made it worthwhile.
“Right, of course,” Neville said, motioning for the two to follow him.  “I’ll get you to where we’ve got you staying – it’s a bit small, particularly since I didn’t know you’d be bringing a baby along, but hopefully it’ll do.”
“I wrote him again, attempting to right the wrong I had done, but again received no reply.  I had attempted to protect you from those who might harm you, when I had done far worse than they ever could.  I instantly blamed myself when your letter never came and vowed that, although you would not learn magic, I would teach you myself all I knew.  By reinforcing that caring wasn’t an advantage, I hoped that you would not be hurt in the same ways that I was and would be better for that.  While you seemed to have taken to my advice, I promised myself that I would protect you from everything I could, including myself.  It wasn’t enough to truly make up for the mistake I had made, but it was the only way I could hope to illustrate my regret for what I had done.
“So…seems like it’s been a bit since you went to the library,” he began, his voice falsely casual.  “Did Pince finally banish you?”
John chuckled.  “Sorry you’re so disappointed in your potential drugging.  I’m surprised you’re latching on to that theory rather than asking me more questions though.”
“Ah, the princess awakes,” Mary said with a chuckle, drawing away from John to draw on her dressing gown and approach the crib’s side.  “Morning, Cecelia Watson.  Are you ready for another day of being spoiled rotten?”
Sighing, John buried his face into Sherlock’s shoulder.  “They might.  If they react the way you did, I don’t think we’d be too badly off.  I’d rather not have to be in any small skirmishes to reveal I’ve got magic, though.”
“That’s because her father’s having an affair with his male business partner and she knows about it.  She’s a clever girl; she’s aware that her father is the better of her two parents, despite the infidelity.”
Jolting around, John could hardly do more than gape up at Sherlock while the man at the bar said, “Oh, pardon there, sir.  I’ll just be with you in a mo.”
“Not from appearance, at least.  Ollivander’s nephew is working on the wand, attempting to determine where and by whom it was produced, but we do know for certain that it was not one of their pieces.”
Teddy leapt forward to shake Mrs. Hudson’s hand, shooting John a questioningly raised eyebrow as he did.  John gave him an almost unnoticeable shake of his head, correctly interpreting Teddy’s unasked inquiry of ‘witch?’  Teddy’s beaming smile never faltered during the exchange.  “Edward Lupin, ma’am, a pleasure to meet you.  I’m sorry I didn’t stop by to say a hello on my way up; I didn’t want to bother you.  I’m a friend of John’s.”
Licking his lips, John handed him another piece. “Make sure you’ve got that settled correctly before you tighten this.” John’s voice had grown deeper in his arousal and he was surprised to see Sherlock shiver slightly in response. Silently he slipped into the second piece,
“So this was what you were doing on Oxford Street the other day,” he said, passing it to Sherlock.  “Made another stop at Lush, did you?”
"Yeah, and a fat lot of good that did me. Even your supposed truths were a lie. Even if I thought I could trust you again, this is the final straw. I couldn't trust you if I needed to in order to live."
"You don't fully stand behind what he did, then," Sherlock prodded when he sense John was too incensed to reply. "You knew he was evil, yet followed his orders regardless."
“I’ve never heard of any ways to check other than just asking a person,” John replied thoughtfully.  “I mean, it’s rare enough that you don’t exactly go out of your way to ask every witch or wizard you meet if they’re a metamorphmagus.  It just sort of came up with Tonks – one day she went to bed with short brown hair and came down the next morning with long blue hair.  Naturally we were all a bit confused, and she just told us what she was upfront.”
Shoving the bag away from him, he reached for his mobile and pulled up Sherlock’s name.  Before he could think better of it, he typed out,
“Black I’ve heard of,” Sherlock agreed.  “They’re a rather prominent name.  Principally a pureblood family, the majority of the members inclined towards the Dark Arts.  Rich, overly confident, influential.  Your basic overrated and overpowered gentry who suffer the consequences of their arrogance.”
Mycroft blinked a single time before nodding his acknowledgement.  Though he didn’t say anything, his lips quivered in suppressed emotion and eventually he broke out into a smile.
With a nod, Sherlock rose to his feet and led them back to the road, where he instantly brought a cab forward to wait for their approach.  As they situated themselves and Sherlock told the cabbie their destination, John stared unseeing out the window, planning out what he would say to both Mrs. Hudson and Cecelia when they returned.
The trip may have been quicker that way, but that didn’t make it any easier.  John was moderately talented at Apparating back when they took their tests, but unfortunately seventeen was farther away at this point in his life than it was close.  They landed with a dull thump in front of the statue honoring James and Lily, a spot where John knew there were anti-Muggle charms in place.  Instantly he let go of Sherlock to check on him and Cecelia, wary of any potential splinching from the sudden and unexpected form of transport.  Both seemed fine, if slightly shaken, and John could finally take in his own state.
As he got dressed into the outfit he chose for the first evening, John considered a quick wank to take the edge off, but was interrupted before he could do more than unzip his flies by Sherlock’s return to the flat. He stormed in shouting for John to hurry before they were late, forcing John to hastily throw on his clothes and stumble down the stairs. Sherlock stood impatiently waiting, already in his long coat and texting on his mobile. Without looking at John, he tossed him his jacket and marched down to the waiting cab.
“Sorry, you two, but maybe being around while I’m trying to teach isn’t the best idea.  I’ve got a free period after lunch if you’d like to come down then instead.  I’d be able to give you my full attention for whatever it is you’d like to know…”
Swallowing around the lump in his throat, John nodded his thanks back. “You too, but to be honest, not much would look bad on you.” He missed Sherlock blinking in surprise as he brushed past him toward the stairs. “Should we go up?” Without answering, Sherlock trekked up the stairs behind him.
“It’s not your fault.”  He tilted his head up, allowing John’s mouth to move along to his jaw.  “Was, ah, there something else you wished to discuss?”
“John!  Sherlock!”  Harry set his glass aside to come shake their hands.  The woman stood at Harry’s exclamation, Ron’s hand trailing down her back as she moved.
Roughly a week later, John paced back and forth in front of the fireplace, desperately fighting the urge to run his hand through his hair and ruin it.  Greg and Molly were due any moment and Mycroft had just texted to say they too were on their way.  One bottle of wine sat open and resting beside the waiting food on the kitchen table, another chilling in the fridge.  John itched to go pour himself a glass, but he knew Sherlock would scold him for worrying too much if he saw.  As soon as he heard Sherlock and Cecelia’s footsteps coming down from her room, he froze and threw himself into his chair in an attempt at casual indifference.
Rubbing at his forehead, John sighed.  “Just trust me, okay?  Magic doesn’t come from the wand – it’s like it’s the transport that helps transfer it from you to whatever needs to be done, just like how you separate your body from your mind.  But you have to relax and let it happen, you see?  You’re trying too hard and tensing up, it’s freaking your mind out and making you focus too much on all of it.  Just let it happen and see how it goes, eh?”
Sherlock popped up in the sitting room doorway.  “Molly.  I just finished clearing up my things in the kitchen, John.  Just give me a moment to change and I’ll be ready to go.”
“What would you know of it?” Sherlock snapped, untangling his long limbs and rising to his feet.  “What could this possibly be about for John to discuss it with you and not me?”
Sherlock went willingly where John led him, sitting at the edge of the loveseat in the room with only a slight wince. John untied the bonds with calm efficiency, studying Sherlock’s skin underneath for any serious damage. Once the rope was completely removed and Sherlock’s pants adjusted to give him a semblance of dignity, John dug around in his jacket and pulled out a tube of ointment that he applied liberally across Sherlock’s chest and back.
Rolling his eyes, Mycroft pulled the door closed behind him.  They waited for the idling car roar to life and drive away before John nuzzled into Sherlock’s hair.  “Want to talk about what you found out?”
Sherlock’s head shot around to gape at him, but John entered balancing three mugs of tea before he could comment.  He set his own on the small table beside his chair, passing Mycroft one and holding Sherlock’s out to him.  When Sherlock didn’t move to take it, John placed it on the floor beside his chair instead.
“The same goes for you, John,” Sherlock said with an intense gleam to his eyes. “You may be fairly sexually comfortable with women, but you don’t have to force yourself to do anything with me if you’d rather not.”
Sherlock watched as John headed to the bar, fighting to contain his smile and failing miserably.  He danced his fingers against his half full glass as he gazed absentmindedly across the nearly empty pub.  His thoughts returned, as they often did recently, to his suspicion that John would propose soon, wondering if this evening was meant to be more than just an anniversary meal.  Before he could grow too engrossed in his thoughts, a shadow at his side caused him to freeze and turn.
In response, Sherlock surged down and crushed their lips together. John clutched at his shoulders and moved with him, coming up occasionally for ineffective gasps of air. When he started to get dizzy, John carefully guided them apart, though only far enough to breathe in each other’s air. Sherlock’s mouth was a mess, the lipstick smeared across his chin and parts of his cheek, and John suspected he was in a similar state. With an amused grin, he gripped Sherlock’s hands and walked with him backwards towards the bathroom. Sherlock followed willingly, seemingly in a daze and transfixed on John’s face.
“Not to worry.  So we’ve got Peppa Pig and we’ve got legos…what else do you want to ask Santa to get you for Christmas?”
“Your friend was correct, then,” she commented smoothly, a lilt of amusement in her voice.  “You’ve done well for yourself, Dr. Watson.  Who is this, then?”
Sherlock grunted again, somehow managing to shrink his lanky body into the chair even further than it already was.  “Out of town.  Went to visit relatives or something or other.”
Dumbledore glanced over Sherlock’s shoulder at Mycroft.  “We had every indication that the letter was delivered, hence no additional response.  Our owls are trained not to give up without successfully giving the recipient its message.  It returned without its letter and did not give the typical signs that we should attempt the deliver again.”
Doyle grinned, his hands shoved casually into his pockets as he rested his back against the wall.  His shoulders shoved back into the stone, thrusting his waist out suggestively while his hands bulged out his trouser pockets.  “Hmm, I suppose not.  A shame.  What are you doing?”
John tried to chuckle along with Mary, but his focus could only be distracted for so long before it meandered back to Sherlock’s text.  He considered half a dozen possible replies to it, ranging from
“It’s an oyster, John, they aren’t particularly difficult to spot.”  John chuckled at his remarks and followed Sherlock’s demands, stealing glances at the merman between searching through the seaweed.  When Sherlock caught him watching, he blinked and cocked his head once more in question.  John shot him a wink and enjoyed the brief, peachy flush that turned his cheeks almost human before they returned to their searching and chatting.
“Shh.”  The sound was more of a feeling across John’s skin than an actual sound.  “You are the connection, John.  It’s obvious.  She is running on the emotions of her heart.  Where can we deduce that will take her next?”  Sherlock fell silent to give John the chance to reply, but all he received was a tickling sensation when John’s eyebrows furrowed.  “You know her best, John.  You are the only one of us to know best where she might go.  Think, John.  I know you can do this.”  Sherlock let his nose nudge against John’s in what was unmistakably an intimate fashion.  John’s reaction was to instantly jolt away, but from the way he gripped suddenly at Sherlock’s elbows and the excitement in his eyes, Sherlock could tell the motion came from revelation rather than disgust.
John’s other hand came up to cradle Sherlock’s face. “Open your eyes.” Sherlock’s face scrunched in momentary struggle before he finally forced them open again. “I enjoyed it too. Being close to you, holding you, touching you…it’s all I’ve wanted since the moment I saw you. It was the only way I could show you how much I adore you without being able to tell you. I thought you’d never want that with me, but here, in this…I could finally have the thing I thought I’d never be allowed to have.”
“Not so psychosomatic, is it?” John replied with a slight grin.  “It was from a shot during the Battle at Hogwarts.  I got caught between a few Death Eaters and got hit on the shin from a stray curse.  I only had the time to do a quick Healing of it at the time and it tends to act up when I’m stressed.”
“Is their problem, not yours.  Jesus, Greg, you’re a bloody amazing officer and a more than decent friend.  The fact that you’ve turned out so well growing up around all of that is proof of how amazing
“Me too.”  He took a step away from Sherlock, trailing a hand down his arm and squeezing his fingers.  He pulled at the knot attaching the wrap against his neck and tossed it into his chair.  “
“You’re too good to me, John Watson,” Sherlock sighed, leaning forward to place a small kiss on his lips.  “What can I do to repay you?”
Having come to his decision, he shot John a small smile and squeezed his hand.  Their conversation turned to lighter topics until Rosmerta brought over their food.  John dug into his pie while Sherlock picked at his fish, taking tiny bites in between tearing it into smaller pieces.  Sherlock felt John trying to meet his eyes but focused on his food, unwilling to continue their previous discussion despite how much he could tell John wanted to pry further.  He felt a fissure of guilt settle in his stomach at having apparently ruined their pleasant evening and sought something to lift the atmosphere.  Just as he decided to give it a shot, John jumped and dug around in his pocket.
They both fell silent, each ruminating on his own thoughts.  The only sounds in the flat came from the fire and faint noises of Mrs. Hudson moving in her flat below.  Sherlock drummed his fingers on his knees thoughtfully, curving mouth pinched into a frown.  “There’s still something I don’t understand.  Why are you here?  Why would you be sitting on the couch of 221b if you’re a wizard?”
The garden was small, hardly more than a few flowerbeds and a sprinkling of vegetable plants.  Ever since the baby arrived, neither John nor Mary had had the time to properly care for it, but some of the plants had flourished on their own regardless.  One bush in particular, a rose John had insisted upon adding and caring for himself, sat directly below the window.  It had taken more work than John had originally cared to admit, but it was flourishing now, a few of the flower heads reaching high enough to be seen at the very edge of the windowsill.“That, my darling, is an osiria, a crossbreed,” John explained with a tiny grin, rocking her forward slightly so her curious face could take the plants in.  “They’re the only kind of rose to have those two shades, red blending into white.  They were my mum’s favourite, the only kind she’d grow when I was young.”
"Not disappointed by what you see?” John asked, trying to mask his spike of insecurity in a teasing tone. Sherlock’s eyes blinked open and he shook his head in shock.
The pair made their way up the stairs, the visitor’s heels clacking along with the creaks of wood as they climbed.  The sounds of Sherlock’s violin grew louder as they approached, drifting in a downward spiral from door Mrs. Hudson had left open when she left minutes before.  Though their approach could obviously be heard from his spot standing before one of the windows, he ignored them, back facing away from the rest of the room as he continued to play.
“Oh love, I’m so sorry.”  John set aside his wine to run his hand through Sherlock’s hair.  “But Mycroft’s right, you know.  You’re obviously talented, now that you’ve figured out how to get past the mental block.  So it takes a bit more for you to get it to work; it just makes it that much more impressive when you do.”
“The petals have stopped.”  John glanced at the ground as well, finding nothing but rocks without a shot of burgundy or pearl standing out among them.  Sherlock held out the last petal he found and John took it, rubbing a thumb over the silky middle.  “Maybe they Apparated away.”
When John went up to bed that night, Sherlock was still sat in the middle of the sitting room floor surrounded by papers. His attempts at sleep were interrupted by the continuation of the images that distracted him throughout the day, culminating in a reluctant wank in the hopes of calming himself down. Even that only worked for so long, as thoughts of Sherlock’s hands being the ones on his skin in little more than forty eight hours seemed to increase his desire. After tossing and turning for hours, he finally succeeded in falling asleep, although the day’s images simply followed him into sleep.
The constant, dull bustle of London was a surprise after the relatively peaceful quiet of the Burrow’s countryside.  They huddled close as they emerged from the alley and made their way across the street.  When they unlocked the door and headed up the stairs, they heard voices from the sitting room.  The two of them glanced at each other briefly before running the rest of the way up.
“You’ve only been finished with your last one two days ago,” came the scolding sounds of Mrs. Hudson.  She stood in the doorway to the kitchen behind him, a tray containing tea and a handful of biscuits clasped in her hands.  “You’d think you’d be ready for a break, what with all of that Moriarty business finally at an end.”
Sherlock had sprung to his feet when McGonagall had, and now that she was leaving, he raced to catch up.  “No!” he cried as he slid past her and blocked the way, the pair of them halfway down the stairs.  “What is Hogwarts?  What is a Floo?”
"I want to see you," John suddenly said, eyes darting up from her arm to her face. "The real you, not this picture you've painted of the Mary I thought I knew."
?” Sherlock muttered, head twisting in every direction in search of an answer.  “Even the healthiest of individuals feel the limitations of the human body eventually, and the position of teacher hardly leaves one in the ripe physical state for
Sherlock shot him a tiny smile as their attention was brought abruptly back to their audience by an employee directing everyone back downstairs. Wiping his hands on his already ruined trousers, John wobbled to his feet and reached out to help Sherlock to his. As much of a state John was in, with his messy bottom half and shirt gaping open, Sherlock looked like a disheveled disaster. His limp cock still hung from his opened trousers, the band most likely uncomfortable and chaffing at the delicate skin of his still hidden balls. He at least still had his shirt on, albeit untucked and with his waistcoat nearly ripped in half with a least one button gone. His cravat dangled open around his neck, nearly falling off one shoulder, and his hair stood up in nearly every direction. John spared a brief moment wondering how they’d manage to get a cab to take them home later if they were in this state before pulling Sherlock, his expression caught in dazed confusion, back to the meeting room.
Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes.  “Very well.  I suppose Jeannette wouldn’t appreciate a slide of decomposing plant life as much as we do.”
The meeting room was decorated in a similar manner, with the same layered rugs covering the floors and draped fabrics along the walls. Rather than having a single ceiling light, however, short side tables held Victorian style oil lamps that cast long shadows across the walls and illuminated the room in a faint glow. Along one wall stood a long table meant for refreshments and mismatched stools and worn chairs were dotted around the perimeter. The room gave off a comfortable intimacy that welcomed them in, but the light created just enough of a feeling of mystery to make walking around in it feel like exploring a house with years of rumours of witches and hauntings.
When he’d been informed that he was going to be given leave for the Christmas holidays, John did everything in his power to get out of it.  The only family he had left to possibly visit was Harry, who would most likely spend the majority of the time he was around drunk and incoherent, and it would have been more worthwhile to have some of the others who had significant others and children to have the opportunity to go home before he did.  Besides, he would much rather spend Christmas with his men and…well, okay, yes, he was hoping it would be an opportunity to get closer to Sholto.  They only really had a chance to chat for a few minutes every few days when their regiments happened to be paired up, but with the holiday he might get the chance to actually speak with him rather than just the usual small talk or army chatter.  Regardless, he didn’t manage to get out of his leave and here he was, back in London staying in a cheap hotel with no plans beyond staring at his ceiling all day and trips to whatever pub struck his fancy every night.
“Already ordered us a cab?  I’m honoured, John.”  They settled in close, John placing a hand comfortably on Sherlock’s thigh as he nodded for the cabbie to go.
Sherlock gave a muffled sound of agreement as he squatted down on one knee on the floor, eyes narrowing as he studied Teddy’s arm.  In reaction, Teddy snatched his arm away and scrubbed at it as though that would remove the bizarre sensation of being at the heart of Sherlock’s focus.  “Right, you weren’t exaggerating, Uncle John.  But this is getting kinda creepy.”
“Oh love,” John muttered, placing his cup on the floor and rising to come to Sherlock’s side.  He pulled him to his feet and into a hug.  Instantly Sherlock folded himself around John, his arms wrapped tightly around John’s waist and his face buried in John’s shoulder.  John stroked his back in wide, sweeping circles, attempting to comfort him.  “I didn’t mean it that way.  I’m sorry.  We’re both pretty frustrated by all this, aren’t we?  It was bound to get let out at some point.”
“I’ll get her,” Sherlock muttered as they broke apart, his voice thick and vaguely quivering.  John nodded and took his wand, watching Sherlock head up the stairs.  By the time he returned with Cecelia, his face was more composed and John had made them both more tea.
“It appears that you have purchased the last eggnog latte,” he stated, his voice growling with barely suppressed anger.  John’s brows rose in disbelief as he glanced between the barista and the man, but she was busy making John’s drink and attempting to ignore the confrontation in her shop.  He let his duffle slide from his shoulder to the ground and leaned an elbow against the counter.
A figure paused at the top of the street, shoulders hunched into its jacket.  Its head slowly shifted from one side to the other, considering options, before setting off straight ahead.  As it passed a single narrow alleyway, its shadow darted high and threatening over it, leading it toward a destination before shifting to follow behind.  Before long, the figure paused, hooded face lifting toward the building opposite.
Sherlock snatched up his wand and moved into the middle of the room, glancing around him with a frown.  Spotting a book on the coffee table, he cleared his throat and raised his wand.  He closed his eyes and breathed in deeply, letting the air out slowly.  He felt more than heard John move to his side, placing a hand with light fingers on his waist.
“Such a fine coat,” Doyle remarked, stroking his thumb along the red buttonhole at the top.  “How many cases must you have worked to save enough for such an extravagance?”
“No apologies needed.”  John shifted his grip so that he cradled Sherlock’s face in his hands.  He rubbed his thumbs along Sherlock’s cheekbones, making his eyes fall shut in contentment.  “You know, there might be a way for us to be here and you to be on cases at the same time.”
He heard a muffled buzz from somewhere deeper in the flat and cocked his head in confusion.  Reaching into his sleeve, he slipped out his wand and snuck towards Sherlock’s room, where he suspected the noise came from originally.  The door stood somewhat ajar and John nudged it with his foot to peer inside.
“I simply dislike Doyle, that’s all,” he said with a sigh.  He rubbed the bridge of his nose fiercely.  “He’s…unsettling.  There’s too much of Moriarty in him and it’s disconcerting.”
“Whoops,” John said, Sherlock’s come covered hand squashed between them.  Sherlock burst into low chuckles and he rested his forehead on John’s shoulder.  John dug around in his pocket for a tissue and wiped up his mess, scrubbing futilely at the spots on Sherlock’s jeans.  “We’ll have to wash these, it’s already set.  At least they’re jeans and not proper leather riding trousers.”
“Mr. Holmes,” he remarked when he reached the counter.  Sherlock spared a quick glance at John before nodding his acknowledgement.  The man cocked his head to the side in thought before opening the box to inspect its contents.  “Minerva told me to expect you.  And that you may be a…special case.”
He ignored her for the moment and dug around in his pajama bottoms for his own mobile, soon finding it in one of the pockets.  He thumbed through his texts until he reached Lestrade’s name, hovering over the conversation with momentary uncertainty.  Huffing out a determined breath, he brought up the messages and started a new one.
“Of course I do, but it will do you little good,” Sherlock replied, hand ruffling absentmindedly through his hair.  “He’s gone, out of town for the weekend.  You’re only here in London briefly.  By the time he comes back, you’ll be long gone.”
“Believe me, I receive more than enough attention from my boyfriend.”  Sherlock made sure to emphasize the last two words as a reminder to Doyle that he had no need of him.  “In fact, when we are home, often enough it is me who neglects him.”
“Damn smart like her papa,” Sherlock said and John was forced to pull his head down and plant a kiss on his lips.  He felt Sherlock smiling around it and began to laugh into it, finally ducking his head down and shaking his head.
!”  Cecelia interrupted his perusal of the room, jumping up from the round black rug at the foot of her bed to show him what she was creating.
Sherlock’s hand came down to settle on John’s waist.  He let his head fall back and John’s lips settled on his jaw.  “There may be a few…suggestions in our bedroom.”
He shifted around enough to glance up at John.  Trails of dried tears shone along his face, barely visible in the dim light.  John’s chest tightened at the sight, as though he had been locked into a too small room that was shrinking in on him.  He’d never seen such a vulnerable expression on Sherlock and hoped this would be the only time.
Snape shook his head and John nearly broke Sherlock’s fingers from how tightly he held on.  “I’m afraid I do not know, John.  I was here at Hogwarts at the time and only had the chance to communicate with the Dark Lord occasionally.  If she was, it was nothing he saw fit to tell me.”
Harry blinked open mouthed at Sherlock, stunned momentarily into silence, before breaking out in a grin.  “I’m not even going to ask how you do that,” he said as he reached into the noted pocket to pull out a small vial.  “I have a feeling I don’t want to know.”
John took his hand again and squeezed.  “You ready?”  Sherlock’s only response was to nod, and John guided him to their destination.
John only left Sherlock alone long enough to get Cecelia and arrange for some food to be brought directly to their rooms.  Though he was feeling better, the last thing Sherlock wanted to do was sit in a full great hall amongst the whispers of curious students.  When John returned, Cecelia instantly crawled up onto the sofa and into Sherlock’s lap.  She curled herself around him without asking any questions and Sherlock’s heart clenched in love and gratitude.  The three of them spent the rest of their evening close to one another, not leaving the sofa for more than a few minutes at a time if necessary.  Though they did their best to make sure Cecelia slept in her own bed most nights, John easily relented that night and they continued to remain close to one another even as they slept.
She nodded against his chest and looked up at him with large eyes.  “I’ll stay away from him for you, Papa.”
Mrs. Hudson answered almost instantly, wearing an apron and wiping her hands on a tea towel.  “John!  Come in, dear, I’ve just finished up with a batch of chocolate scones.  I know how your two loves adore anything sweet.”
“Has it occurred to you that perfect, at least your version of it, might not be what I really need?”  John’s question back was nearly as quiet.  “Have you ever thought that what we had, the cases, the running, even the body parts in the fridge, were exactly what I’d been hoping for?”  Sherlock neither looked up nor replied.  John let out a soft sigh and stood, carefully walking over to take Cecelia from Sherlock’s arms.  The motion finally forced him to meet John’s eyes, their color a golden hazel from the firelight.  He watched the wrinkles form around John’s eyes as he smiled.  “Get to bed soon.  I don’t care if it’s just transport; we’ve got research to do in the morning.”
“I was wondering when you’d ask, you git.”  John smirked at him as he picked the wand up and shoved it into Sherlock’s hand.  “Go on, then.  Can’t cause much harm if you haven’t got the skill.”
Sherlock allowed John’s words to wash over him and felt himself succumbing to sleep in the warmth and safety of his arms.
Glancing down at his two loves in his arms, John looked back up at Harry and smiled weakly.  “Yeah, we’re fine.  Better than I expected when this all started, at least.”
“There’s no way,” Sherlock scoffed.  John could tell his frustration was growing and wished he could hold both him and Cecelia to reassure them that everything would be okay.  “If you had been around often enough, I would have known.  Even if I had been stupid enough to delete your face after seeing it more than once, one of my network would have pointed you out to me if you showed up too often.”
“And he informed you that I was not actually on a case, I’m sure.”  Sherlock thunked his head back against the headboard and turned to look at John.  “You actually aren’t a complete idiot, you know.”
“Anybody who’s a ginger is Molly and Arthur’s,” John explained.  He glanced up and down the table.  “Actually, we’re missing one.  Charlie’s probably not able to get away – he works with dragons and usually doesn’t like leaving them to anyone else unless it’s absolutely necessary.  I was at Hogwarts with him the longest, along with Bill, the oldest, Percy, and briefly with George and his twin Fred.  Ron started the fall after I finished and Ginny was the year after that.”  As he mentioned everyone’s names, he gestured at where they sat at the table and Sherlock followed his motions, studying everyone briefly.
“Should I…”  John gestured at his groin, eyebrows knitted in concern.  “I don’t know if you want me to use a condom or anything.”
John snorted and nodded Sherlock to his chair.  “I knew there was a reason I didn’t like her.  At least her daughter’s the complete opposite.”
“We’d be staying right at Hogwarts, then?” Sherlock asked excitedly, lifting his head just enough to meet John’s eyes.
“We were told your magic wasn’t strong enough to attend Hogwarts,” Violet muttered, shaking her head in disbelief.  “Your magic shouldn’t be any stronger than mine.”
“Jesus, Sherlock, are you okay?  Baby, look at me.”  He waited for Sherlock to lift his own face without John touching him.  His forehead knitted in concern as he studied the scratches caused by the uneven stone and lifted a tentative hand to his brow.  Sherlock pushed against John’s touch to encourage John to continue.  John ran his hand through Sherlock’s hair, partly in search of any unseen injuries and partly to comfort them both.
“If that means using this bloody amazing bed, there’s no need for incentive.  I plan on thoroughly debauching it as soon as humanly possible.”
By the time John came back up, the living room was empty and muffled noises came from behind Sherlock’s closed bedroom door. He emerged seconds later in a worn t-shirt and sleeping trousers, his blue dressing gown draped over his shoulders. He immediately made for his chair and slouched down into it, taking out his mobile and tapping away at it.
“I’ll get her settled into bed,” Sherlock said.  “Thank you for your help this evening, Molly.  It was much appreciated.”  Without waiting for a reply, he trotted up the stairs to Cecelia’s room.  Lestrade chuckled and led Molly towards the stairs leading to the front door.
Hermione beamed and pulled away to look John over.  “It helps when two of the three are constantly around each other at work and two of them are married to each other.  I keep Harry in line during the day and move on to Ron at home – it doesn’t give us much of a choice but to stay close.”
Sherlock hummed in pleasure at the word and rubbed his hand down to push his palm against one of John’s nipples. “Perhaps we can…collaborate, then. On our individual platforms. I know my followers would be intrigued by something new.”
Sherlock rubbed at one of the spots and shrugged.  “I suspected this would happen.  Besides, I haven’t tried my only pair of leather trousers on in ages; I expect that after years of being fed by you, they’ll be even tighter than they were before.”
“Love, part of the reason why we’re here is to make you a part of this world.  Coming back is exciting, sure, but it’s only because of you that I’m even here right now.  You’re making it worthwhile by doing it with me.”  Sherlock seemed unable to respond, blinking widely down at John.  John grinned and pulled him down into a proper kiss, though he kept it short.  “Sorry to steal him away, Molly,” he called out to her as he pulled Sherlock along behind him when he started to leave the room.
Niall fidgeted, his eyes darting down to stare at the floor. “It started small – we’d be cleaning up at the end of the night, collecting clothes to wash before the next show, organizing the accessories, that sort of thing, when we’d notice a handful of items missing. It didn’t matter how careful we were to watch when customers were in the room, we inevitably lost at least three or four small items each night. We might have been fine if that was all, but then there were notes. Started with fairly innocuous comments, remarks about the actors that could be construed as a bit forward in the right light, but then they got…uncomfortable. Threatening. We’ve reached the point where some of our hired couples are too scared to finish out the week and quit partway through. The performance art scene is small enough that word travels fast, and add in the nature of what we’re doing and we’re having problems even getting people to apply to perform. The weird thing is, we’ve got people and cameras constantly going in every area where the problems are taking place but haven’t seen any sign of who’s doing it. I’m afraid that it’s an employee, but I’ve interviewed them all personally and can’t imagine any of them jeopardising it all like this. At this rate, we’ll be done within the next two weeks if it doesn’t stop.”
“She may be dead, but Cecelia is still her child,” Sherlock said grimly as he kept his eyes unblinkingly on Doyle.  “No matter what has happened to her, Cecelia is still her blood child.”
“Guilt is something I certainly have experience with,” James mumbled, his eyes never leaving Mycroft’s.  “Though the fact that you seem to have done so much to attempt to fix it is more than I’ve ever done in my situation.”
“So I just have to speak the name of where I’m going?” Sherlock said, leaning down to peer into the fireplace.
“She’s killed you once by Muggle means and I’m not going to give her the chance to do it again!” John roared, bringing Sherlock to a stunned halt.  He approached Sherlock as he yelled, only stopping when they were so close that the tips of their shoes touched.  John pulled in a ragged breath that fluttered across Sherlock’s cheek when he released it, causing Sherlock to instinctively shudder.  When he spoke, it was barely loud enough for even Sherlock to hear.  “She will never be allowed to hurt you again.  As long as I’m alive and breathing, she will never hurt us again.”
A scrambling came from the other room and seconds later a disheveled Sherlock appeared at the entrance to the kitchen.  The open book dangled from his fierce grip and his face was a combination of stunned and thrilled.  He came to John’s side, waving the book in John’s face.  “My mother.”
“Not your fault, love,” John replied.  They laid in silence for several long minutes simply clutching each other close, until Cecelia started to stir over the monitor.  John pulled them both into a sitting position and kissed Sherlock briefly.  “No lie-ins for the weary, it seems.”
They made it as far as the edge of the Forbidden Forest before Sherlock pulled them to a stop.  They stood panting just where the trees met the open grass of the grounds, Sherlock squinting to try and see into the growing darkness.  Once John caught his breath, he placed a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder to get his attention.
“Ready?” John asked, rubbing his thumbs lightly over the backs of Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock squeezed his fingers in reply.
“It’s definitely not stupid if that’s how you feel.”  John held Sherlock by the shoulders, breaking their tight grip so that he could say what he needed while looking Sherlock in the eyes.  “You and Cecelia will always be my biggest priorities, even during the times when I’m shite about showing it.  This job is amazing, but honestly?  I miss spending all of my days with you.  My favourite part of the day is when I can close up my office and come sit with you to do nothing but be together.  Even if Minerva asks me to stay on for more than the year, I don’t think I ever could.  Going on cases with you, chasing after you through the streets of London, living with you at Baker Street…if nothing else, this year at Hogwarts has shown me that living that life, being with
“Sherlock.”  They watched Jane colour and hum to herself for a few minutes before Sherlock huffed out a breath.  He shoved his glasses back up his face and waved a hand at his trolley.  “I should probably get back to work.  I’m sorry again for all of that.”
“I suppose that’s just something you’ll have to wait and see on,” John relented.  He took a thoughtful sip of his tea, free arm slung over the back of the couch just barely out of reach of the nape of Sherlock’s neck.  “Does it feel the same as Baskervilles?  Or, you know…before.”
"It shouldn't have mattered!" John screamed, going to leap at her but held back by Sherlock's firm grip on his arms. "These were lives, human lives, who were part of a family! It shouldn't have fucking
“Oi, that’s your brother-in-law and one of my best mates you’re talking about.  Besides, you know we’d need to see them at some point before we leave, not to mention that we’re hardly any better than them.  We’re better off just taking care of everything in one go rather than having to drag out the explanations over multiple discussions.”
“Most likely something along the lines of what you just said,” Sherlock replied, a single finger dragging across the violin’s strings.  His eyes, currently a light blue in the sunlight filtering in from the window to his left, bore unblinking over his visitor’s face, watching carefully for her reactions.  She said nothing as he studied her, hardly moving as she studied him right back.  The faintest of smiles, hardly more than a soft crinkle at the edge of one side of her mouth, was the only sign that she had even heard him speak.  “Now then, what can I do for you, Doctor?”
“You were jealous, weren’t you?” John spoke for the first time since their exchange began.  “Sherlock was already the younger child, given more attention because of that alone, and then when he had the magic…they would have been excited and focused on him, for the most part.  Definitely more than they were already.”
“This isn’t the only scar I need to worship,” he murmured, situating Sherlock so that he sat between his legs with his back to John’s front.  For a long and quiet moment, John simply stared down at him, taking in the massacred skin.  He had seen the jagged marks a handful of times since Sherlock’s return, but this was the first time he focused on them.  They never talked about how they happened, for both of their preferences, yet John wanted to turn their memories into something more pleasant like what Sherlock had done with his own scar.  He leaned forward to rest his forehead against the back of Sherlock’s neck, his face just close enough for the nape hairs to tickle, and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist tightly.  Sherlock raised his arms to rest over John’s, his hands settling on top of his.
“God, Sherlock, I’m so sorry.”  Sherlock realised that John had gone from checking him over for injuries to whispering into his hair without him even noticing.  He cradled Sherlock differently than usual, holding him close as always but with a softer touch that made Sherlock feel as though he was broken.  “I knew I should have done something sooner, I could tell something wasn’t right after Hogsmeade.  This is all my fault; I should have noticed, I should have stopped this long ago – “
“John!” he shouted, the sound lost in the bed sheets.  Minutes passed without a response.  Sighing the sigh of the severely tried, he shifted his face enough to free his mouth and called out again.  “
“It is, and it will be.”  When Sherlock continued to stare down at the floor, John came to his side and wrapped an arm around him, reaching up to kiss him below his ear.  “You’ll get there.  You’ve barely done any spells before, Sherlock, and I just asked you to do a NEWT level one.  You can’t be expected to master all of it right away.  That’s why we’re going to work on it together, yeah?”
Sherlock took in a shaking breath and said a small, “Lumos.”  The tip of the wand sputtered a bit in reply, but did nothing.
“We’ll take it out of Niall’s bill,” he eventually breathed out, stroking the silk of Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock smiled as he glanced up at John and moved up to wrap his lips around one of John’s nipples. John’s grip tightened and he glanced away, hoping to calm himself from the sensations by looking away from him. The mirror worked against his plan, however, but John wasn’t entirely sure he minded. Sherlock’s striped and ruffled arse bobbed in the air as he moved, the split sides of his shirt parting just right to reveal his socks. As he moved from one nipple to the other, his calves shifted under them and John saw the muscles strain. Half of him wished he could reach more than Sherlock’s head, but the other knew having more access would distract him from what Sherlock was doing with his tongue.
“Anything mechanical is acceptable,” Sherlock said as he fiddled with his trousers, shifting them down just enough to show a hint of his hipbones and the hair leading to his groin. Both John and Niall forced their eyes off of him, Niall shooting John an apologetic smile. With a bit more haste than usual, he headed off for the public dressing room and left them alone. John fastened the dildo back in place and managed to shove his hands into his back pockets to keep them from fidgeting.
“Effected by sudden, unexpected actions, triggered by emotional stimuli.”  Sherlock marched back into Teddy’s personal space, but this time it was expected.  His hair remained unchanged for the moment, but his eyes soon shifted to mimic Sherlock’s, a misty green that day.  “I suspect it takes a fairly long time to learn how to control the changes.”
“We didn’t want you to miss out on anything,” Sherlock explained, his voice tentative.  “I knew we said we’d have our afternoon with her another day, but…well, I just wanted to give her something for the day, even if it wasn’t what we originally planned.  I hope that’s okay.”
“We just found out about her today, John, there’s no way we can know more than you at the moment.”  Harry sighed and patted John’s hand.  “You’ll know as much as we do, I promise.  Hell, what you already know may be the best we’ve got on her.  We’ll do everything we can to put this right.”
“There has to be some way to make it click together,” John mumbled.  “It’s obvious that your magic is trying to communicate with you, and you’re definitely trying to get it to do what you want, but it just isn’t coming as naturally as it should.”
,” John said while leaning in to kiss her forehead.  She grumbled and fussed away from John’s lips, causing John to cluck his tongue at her.  “Someone’s grumpy.  Maybe a snack and we’ll see if your papa’s ready to give his wand work another try?”  John grinned up at Sherlock to see his reaction to the new title.  He wasn’t disappointed when he spotted Sherlock’s softened expression, a small smile at the corner of his mouth as he looked down at Cecelia.  John snagged a banana and knife from the kitchen and dragged the highchair out to the sitting room.  Once Cecelia was settled in and happily being fed small pieces of fruit, John raised a brow at Sherlock.
When he managed to focus again, John waved his arm lazily in the now lukewarm water, enjoying the swirls of purple that still surrounded them.  Sherlock sighed and placed a small kiss on John’s jaw, causing him to sigh in contentment.  Soon they both were shivering and John pushed them into a proper sitting positing to dislodge the plug and pull them to their feet.  They gingerly stepped onto the freezing tile, careful not to slip on the waterlogged floor, and grabbed towels before throwing themselves onto the bed.  While John sprawled himself out on his back, Sherlock lay on his side, resting his head on his bent elbow.  Suddenly, a snort of laughter disrupted the contented silence of the room and John turned a raised eyebrow on Sherlock.
“No, just on my lunch and thought I’d stop by.  I was kind of hoping to join you two for a bit.  But if you’re busy, I can head out on my own, maybe see if Mrs. Hudson’s free for a bite.  I wouldn’t want to bother you if you’re on a case.”
“Me too.”  He looked down at Cecelia, who had returned to her perusal out the window.  “We both are.  It’s time for us to come back.”  The van started to slow and John turned to glance out his own window.  “In fact, we’ve just arrived.
“Why do you keep calling me that?” Sherlock asked abruptly, turning to face John.  The movement dislodged John’s hand and John blinked down at him.  “You keep calling me ‘love.’  Why?”
“Ah…I am, yeah,” John eventually replied, silently reassuring Sherlock with a soft thumb stroking the seam of his trousers.  “Sherlock’s a bit more…complicated.”
“Sounds good, and I’ll be fine.”  John glanced up at Sherlock, who was watching him intently.  “All set?  Hopefully this trip will go a bit more steadily than the last.”  Sherlock’s only response was to grip John’s arm tighter against his side.  John gave him a quick nod and the three Apparated away.
"You’ve got a wand,” he murmured, smiling up at him.  The box lay jammed between the two of them, still held tightly enough in Sherlock’s grip that his knuckles turned white.  Sherlock stared at the box, his hand trapped with it in the heat between their bodies.  A corner of his mouth ticked up in a small smile when he raised his eyes to John’s.
John sent him a half grin as he rose to his feet and snatched up his wand.  “I suppose it doesn’t matter much now that you know.  What would you like to see?”
“She’s a thoughtful little lass already,” McGonagall commented in a low voice, studying Cecelia as Cecelia studied her.  “She takes after that friend of yours in that regard.”
Swallowing back a sob, Sherlock ran up the final steps to the school, throwing open the door and leaning back against it once he was inside.  He gulped in breaths, attempting to calm himself down, and discovered that he was shaking violently.  Rubbing his arms, he bent his head and marched down toward the dungeons, intent on fetching Cecelia to reassure himself that she was okay.  Luckily he didn’t meet anyone on the walk down, giving himself the chance to calm down and regain his composure.  By the time he knocked on the Slytherin common room’s door, his shaking had stopped and his expression was neutral.
“Oh yes, because perfect little Johnny was the selfless one, going off to that fucking school and learning all his wizarding shit while Harry sat at home and drank herself stupid when she wasn’t getting fired from yet another job.  How was it being the ideal child, John?  Not only talented in the usual sorts of ways but a bloody wizard to top it all off?”
“Ah, of course.  I should have known.”  He kissed her head and grabbed one of Sherlock’s hands to squeeze it.  “And how is Papa Smaug feeling?”
“We’ll be on our way,” Sherlock continued, seemingly indifferent to Ian and Niall’s silent conversation. “Research to do for tomorrow, investigations, all that.”
John shrugged to himself and returned to his reading, but he shifted himself around so that his shoulders were against the window instead, allowing him to subtly examine the other man under the disguise of stretching out his legs.  The man’s scowl at the headrest in front of him remained even as his mobile continued to randomly buzz.  Eventually he growled under his breath and flipped the edge of his coat up dramatically, digging around near his arse for what John assumed was his trouser pocket.  John hunched down to better peer through the slit between his seats and study what the man would do next.
“No shit you found magic.  I meant something a little more specific, maybe along the lines of Mary and her past?”
Sherlock and John finally get the opportunity to become intimate and they take advantage.  Thoroughly.
“Yes, I suppose you did.”  Downstairs, another ring at the front door followed by Mrs. Hudson’s voice told them that Cecelia was home early.  “So much for that alone time Mrs. H suggested.  You ready to tell our daughter the news?”
Sherlock’s timer went off and he snatched up a colander, straining the Valerian root pieces in the beaker out of the water.  Using an eye dropper, he collected the water and counted out seven drops into the cauldron.   With his free hand, he picked up his wand and used it to stir, watching the potion turn lightly purple in colour.  “The Burrow?”
Harry stepped between them, placing a hand on each of their shoulders.  “All right, enough.  I think we’re missing the real point here.  This is neither of your faults – this is Doyle abusing his position and attempting harm on someone else.  If you’re going to be angry, be angry at the person who actually deserves it, not each other.”
They spent the afternoon in their pajamas in the sitting room, working on Sherlock’s casting and spellwork.  Despite the fact that he had his own wand now, the magic still fought to work properly and Sherlock found himself growing frustrated quickly.
“John.”  Sherlock attempted to keep his voice indifferent, but John noticed the faint quiver of uncertainty in it.  “Have you been through the cupboard recently?”
John left Sherlock to poke about at the costumes left for customers and decided to explore the second room. With the full light, he was able to spot a doorway close to the refreshment table. He found a tight hallway beyond it, leading to a closet sized kitchenette, a bathroom, and a third locked door. He did a quick search of both open rooms, but didn’t find anything out of the ordinary. When he returned to the main room, it was to find Sherlock guiding two large men into it from the opposite direction.
Frowning, John sat next to Sherlock and placed his hand on Sherlock’s thigh.  “I don’t understand.  Who’s J?  And what does it mean, one out of two?”
“I hope you don’t mind that Greg came over after he was done working,” Molly said.  Her cheeks glowed with happiness as she settled in close to Lestrade’s side.
“Oh is there?”  John shifted so that he held Sherlock’s face close to his with one hand, the other drifting down to pull him into John by his arse.  “Why don’t you show me, then?”
“Molly, please, dear.  Come in, both of you – I felt you Apparate in through the shields and everyone’s thrilled to see you both.”  She released his hands after patting them in a motherly manner and headed inside.  John stepped up behind Sherlock and placed his hand on the small of his back, both to reassure Sherlock and himself.
Niall gave them both a cursory glance and shot a quick nod at them, a tiny smirk breaking out on his lips. “Well done, both of you. I worried that you’d have trouble with the outfits, particularly from what I remembered of John’s usual style from back at school.”
“DULL!” he shouted to no one in particular, proceeding to thunk his forehead against the table repeatedly.  “I need a case!”
“Sherlock?  Do you want to pick up your puzzle for me?” she asked, her voice falsely sweet.  He hated when she asked if he would like to do anything.  They both knew he didn’t, but she always made it a point to phrase it in that particular way in the hopes that this time would be different and he’d comply easily.  Unfortunately for her, neither of them would be getting what they wanted.
“You’re Harry Potter’s wife,” he stated before she could begin.  “Obviously a Weasley.  I remember from what I’ve read that you’re the first female born into the family in quite a few generations.  The descriptions of your hair do not exaggerate.”  His focus settled on John, who had slumped so far into his chair that it threatened to pull him into its depths.  “Please tell me you are not corrupting these children with your ridiculous reenactments of our cases and simplifying them down to mere ‘robber stories.’”
He stopped in to say hello to Mrs. Hudson before continuing up to the flat, determinately denying to himself that it was a tactic to delay the inevitable.  She asked after the baby and he happily replied until even she could tell that he was stalling.  Sending him away with the promising message of Sherlock acting anxious ever since that strange woman had visited while he’d been away, John was forced up the stairs to face the madness.
“No need to apologise,” John replied, continuing his loose rubbing and flexing.  “It’s been a lot, completely picking up and moving somewhere new.  You haven’t said anything, but I know it’s had to be rough on you.  I appreciate you doing this for me, but that doesn’t make it any easier.”
“Not now, Cecelia, the feast’s about to start,” John said in a stern voice.  He relented slightly when her shoulders slumped and wrapped his arm around her.  “We’ll try to find all of them after, okay?”
The man’s eyes narrowed, but he sent John a tight nod.  John replied with a nod of his own before glancing at the empty seat behind him.  Before he could think better of it, John hopped out of his row and into the one across the aisle from the man, settling himself on the very edge of the seat with most of his body leaning out in the walkway.  The man frowned but uncurled himself from the tight ball he’d mashed himself into in the corner and turned himself slightly toward John.  Taking it as a good sign, John waved a hand at the pocket where the man’s mobile lay.
“It’s all basic scientific development at its core, John,” Sherlock replied, pulling John out of his thoughts.  “When children are at this age, their needs are very straightforward.  It’s simply a matter of breaking the barrier of language difficulties and they’re quite easy to understand.”  He shoved toast into his mouth with one hand while the other carefully guided a piece of apple into Cecelia’s mouth.  She giggled at him before taking it, her mostly toothless gums chomping away happily.
Amidst their drama with Mycroft, Sherlock and John attempt to further their relationship.  When discussions of magic leads to an argument, a revelation pushes Sherlock closer to accepting his magic.
“John,” Sherlock whispered, his eyes wide and his voice nearly gone.  He stared out beyond John’s shoulder, causing John to bolt around and gasp.
“Well isn’t this a lucky coincidence,” a low voice purred into his ear.  Sherlock felt his skin prickle as his sense of dread cemented into certainty.  Doyle drew his wand tip slowly up Sherlock’s spine, pausing when he felt each notch through his suit jacket.  Gritting his teeth, Sherlock straightened his back and kept as still as possible.  He hoped Doyle wouldn’t be foolish enough to try and curse him while they were standing out in the open where any student or professor could appear, but given the fact that he already had his wand out, Sherlock decided it was a chance he’d rather not take.
Sherlock nodded and moved back to rest in the position John put him in originally.  John nuzzled his face a final time before shifting down again, focusing in on the scar.  He settled his hands on Sherlock’s hips and leaned in to run his tongue in a circle around the mark.  At Sherlock’s full body shudder, he latched his lips around the former hole and sucked, layering wet kisses over it.  Sherlock tried to arch up into the kisses, but John’s hands kept him still.  John continued to lave at the skin, until he had Sherlock trembling in his grip.  Whining deep in his chest, Sherlock squirmed and clutched a hand at one of John’s shoulders, pushing and pulling John where he wanted him to go.
“I’ll see you tomorrow, Niall,” John interrupted with a wave. Hurrying to leave before Niall could question him further, John nearly ran down the stairs and out the door.
“I’m available until mid-afternoon,” Mycroft cut in.  At their questioning silence, he shifted uncomfortably.  “I made sure to free part of my day in order to speak with you.  I also may have set aside a bit of extra should it not go well in order to spend some time with James.”
“Oh, but you two have surely been together for ages now, with the way you act together.” Michael’s face lit up at the chance to discuss their private lives, probably hoping John would be convinced to share some interesting information. The combination of having nothing to tell and refusing to fall into the trap Michael set for him made it easy for John to literally shrug the comment off.
John grinned mischievously at Molly’s mention of Lestrade.  “Things are going well, then?  You and Greg?”
John and Sherlock start to settle into their new domesticity, but when they try to give magic a try, things don't go exactly the way either of them expected.
Before Sherlock realized John’s intentions, he descended on Sherlock’s cock, taking the tip he had been rubbing seconds before into his mouth.  He took a moment to run the ridges of his taste buds along his glans, rotating between sudden hard movements and barely there brushes that ended in soft suction.  Sherlock let out a strangled noise and scrambled around for a better grip.  The foot that had been resting on the exhaust pipe hitched up around John’s waist and attempted to shuffle him closer.  When John refused to take his suggestion, Sherlock lifted his arms up behind him, hoping to find a way to thrust up against him.  His plan backfired, however, when one of his hands landed on the handles and squeezed.  The bike revved suddenly, causing a delightful vibration to run through the machine and therefore along Sherlock’s body.  Sherlock let out a strangled shout, shivering as the vibrations died away and he settled quaking limbs back down across the bike.
The sheets below were a deep purple that was almost black, complete with matching pillows.  Her toys waited in a wooden chest below a window that should have been impossible.  John soon recognized it as a similar design to the ones in the lower levels of the Ministry that were meant to copy the weather outside.
“Who are you really?” Sherlock asked quietly.  Doyle lowered Cecelia slightly to properly blink across at him.  “You’ve revealed your great plot, but this is about more than all of that.  You know more about Cecelia and our lives than any old Death Eater who once knew Mary.  Surely we have met before.”
Before anyone could reply, the doors opened to reveal a slightly chaotic office.  Desks were ordered into a seemingly consistent pattern, but it looked as though the various papers and materials sitting across them were strewn about carelessly, allowing them to be easily shared amongst workers.  Chatter echoed through the long room, occasionally broken up by a random shout or laughter.  The three visitors were mostly ignored as Mycroft led them through a path between desks, earning the occasional glance but passed over for whatever task was more important.  John nearly had to drag Sherlock away from the desks they passed, his interest constantly distracted by the potential magical cases.  The office, besides the occasional burst of magic, reminded John of New Scotland Yard, causing a rolling sense of comfortable purpose to settle in his shoulders.  With a hand firmly pressed into the small of Sherlock’s back, he shoved the man forward until they reached Harry’s office.
Sherlock nearly told John some of the suggestive things Doyle had said, but as he considered John’s words, he decided against it.  In the end, John was right; Doyle was not Moriarty, regardless of how much he reminded Sherlock of him, and his words were simply empty threats by a man who thought himself more important than he was.  Sherlock had John, who treated and loved him as a good and decent person would, and for that he could ignore the hollow words of an unsettling coworker.
“Are you okay?” he asked, laying his hand gently on Sherlock’s bare arm. Sherlock blinked down at him and nodded before apparently remembering his state of undress. Flushing a becoming shade of rose, he hastened to finally fix his trousers without meeting John’s eye. John grinned at his sudden bashfulness, finding it ridiculously adorable. “C’mon, let’s go try and get ourselves cleaned up. Did you learn anything useful tonight?”
“You have magic, then?”  Sherlock’s head shot up when he asked.  “The name in the book really was yours?”
“I mean, they’ve learned things about the personal lives of others who performed so that makes sense. And it isn’t as though either of us is very difficult to find online once you start looking anymore. Do you think they’ll suspect that we’re investigating them?”
Mycroft rushed to catch up, a sour expression on his face as he took over leading them.  “Of course she is, Sherlock, how well off would I be in any sort of situation without at least one witch or wizard close at hand?  Now, if you would kindly let me – “
Sherlock’s forehead furrowed in thought.  John knew the instant he realised from how round his mouth became.  “The 29
“You can’t deduce it?” John asked, attempting a weak smile at his failed attempt to joke.  When Sherlock’s only reply was to continue to stare at him unblinkingly, John huffed and crossed his arms.  “Right, yes, she got away, are you happy?  By the time I got back, they’d managed to get Teddy and Mrs. Hudson safely out – Teddy did a fantastic job, by the way, managed to dodge and deflect every curse Mary sent at him – but she was going mad up there, yelling and shooting spells at anything she could find.  The place is a mess - not that it wasn’t already - but they finally managed to get the wand from her.  She didn’t change once through the whole thing except for her eyes.  They switched from color to color faster than you could keep track.”
“I suspected from the start. I knew on Tuesday.” Sherlock swallowed and finally looked up at John. When all he saw was the open expression on John’s face, he continued. “I spoke privately to Ian when we first took the case. While he seemed just as enthusiastic to meet us as Niall, I could tell he was unusually nervous. When I researched both of them over the weekend, I discovered that Ian came from a long line of family members in the military, which didn’t seem particularly relevant at the time. Though he did a decent job of hiding it, I could tell from our conversations that he was resentful of the amount of time Niall devoted to the project and how little recognition he was receiving for his small part in it. He clearly expected it to fail at the start and grew more angry the longer it succeeded. When he left the pin and note, I recognised the handwriting from paperwork in the office and the pin from his family history. I was able to hack into the security system the next day and have a copy sent to me before Ian had the chance to alter it. To be perfectly honest, his editing skills are exceptional and truly were wasted helping Niall.”
“Hmm.”  John rubbed one of the lights in his fingers thoughtfully.  “There must be something we can use these for instead.”  Glancing around the room, he spotted a jar of firefly dust they used a few days previously to touch up the glittering stars on Cecelia’s ceiling.  Curious, John took one of the lights and dipped it into the dust, sending a spray of sparkles across the floor when he shook off the excess.  When he pulled the light fully out, it gave off a soft glow.
It took several one sided conversations as they did their own work or got ready for bed at night for Sherlock to finally engage with him. Sherlock’s voice was as tempting as the rest of him, velvety smooth and posher than anyone John had ever met, and John grew addicted to hearing it as often as possible. Once Sherlock realised that John genuinely wanted to get to know him, he thankfully spoke constantly, nearly to the point of annoyance for John if he was anyone else. For some reason, however, when it was Sherlock talking as John tried to fall asleep, he couldn’t find it in him to make him stop.
“Where are we?” he asked, glancing around for a street marker.  None stood nearby, and the park itself appeared to have no obvious sign giving it a name.  John stared into the bleak trees as his feeling of unease grew.
Sherlock sat hunched over the kitchen table, broad shoulders bent forward awkwardly with his elbows raised in a high, unnatural position above his head.  Before him lay four flasks, each partially filled with a smoky white liquid.  With painstaking precision, he let loose a single drop from the dropper grasped in his left hand, immediately following it with two drops from the one in his opposite hand.  The liquid fizzled slightly, letting off the somewhat sticky smell of burnt toffee, and Sherlock’s head slammed forward to hit the table.  The glasses rattled precariously as Sherlock groaned, maneuvering the goggles over his eyes between the table’s wooden edge and his face.  Eventually one came free from the other, causing him to throw the goggles across the room until their progress was halted by the back of John’s armchair.  He sat like that for a few moments, silently fuming, before his drama required a vocal outlet.
John buried his blush in Sherlock’s neck, peppering kisses where he could reach. Once he felt composed, he shuffled back down Sherlock’s body, nudging his legs apart so that he could settle between them. He felt Sherlock’s thighs quivering in anticipation and gently massaged the inside of one of them, heedless of the fact that he was covering Sherlock in lube. Sherlock pushed up into the movement and John left that hand where it was as he trailed the other up to the tempting shadow of Sherlock’s hole.
Aaaaand we're finally back.  Sorry, y'all, my beta slash former flatmate finally got a full time job (YEAH YOU ADULT) so the process was slowed a bit so that she could move and get herself situated.  BUT next chapter is the last which means it's time to finally wrap some shit up.
John watched them both carefully when he was around, Sherlock in particular.  Sherlock knew it was out of worry, but that didn’t stop him from feeling as though he was an animal on display at a zoo.  Hoping it sprouted mostly from worry, he made sure to tell John where he was going any time they were apart to ease his uncertainty.  Gradually they both grew more comfortable in the castle again, until Sherlock was able to venture out into its corridors alone without his head shouting at him in panic at every noise.
I haven't done this in a while, so hey!  If you wanna chat and fangirl over shit with me, come find me at futureofthemasses on Tumblr!  Also, in exactly two weeks I will be attending 221b con in Atlanta for the first time ever and I AM SO STOKED.  Come say hi, particularly at the potterlock panel which I will be co-leading!
“Answer mine and I’ll answer yours,” John replied, keeping his eyes fixed on the book he wasn’t actually reading.  Sherlock sighed again and moved to stand before John and his chair.  Though he kept his head lowered, John glanced up at Sherlock through his lashes.
“Sherlock,” John breathed, stepping forward to pull him into the room.  The three of them stood at the centre of it in silence for a moment, merely taking it in.  “It’s bloody beautiful.  Did you do this all yourself?”
Sherlock sat in his chair, his violin sprawled over his lap.  He plucked at the strings as he watched John and Mycroft enter, his eyes narrowing at his brother.  As soon as he had confirmation that the revealing charm was only set off by Mycroft, he set aside his violin and dug his wand out of the cushions where he’d obviously shoved it away in haste.
McGonagall pulled John into a hug before doing the same to a startled Sherlock.  Before releasing him, she pulled his ear down to whisper into it with a stern yet warm tone.  “You take care of our John, Mr. Holmes.  And don’t let him slip away from us this time.”
John marched into the room to check on him and his mouth fell open in shock.  The three of them had opted for the currently stylish robe that sat more like a long jacket, hoping they would all be more comfortable wearing them.  Sherlock currently wore a deep violet one with a high collar, a tightly belted waist, and sleeves that flowed out at the elbows slightly.  From his slim hips, two sides flowed open out to his knees, a row of tiny buttons decorating the deep v shape that split his left from his right side.  He completed the outfit with his usual black trousers and a black button up shirt underneath.  He pulled at the fabric around his neck uncomfortably, waiting for John to say something.
Sherlock nodded and headed for the street, arm poised to call a cab.  “Let me know as soon as you have that warrant.  I want to be there when you search the flat.”  His eyes fell on John as the cab pulled up.  “You aren’t coming.”
With a sly grin, John crawled into the bed from the bottom, climbing under the golden duvet and tucking it back in to keep the warmth inside.  In the darkness of both the half morning light and the lowered duvet, he could only feel around for Sherlock’s legs to find his way.  Sherlock shivered when John’s fingers followed the opposite direction of the hair on his legs as he made his way up to his thighs.  His breathing still felt deep and steady when John snuck his hand up to rest against Sherlock’s chest.  While his body continued its journey up towards Sherlock’s head, John left one of his hands resting just to the side of Sherlock’s half interested cock.
John's on his way out of town on a train headed to his sister's.  Guess who throws himself into the same carriage.
“Good choice,” he remarked, gesturing up at the hat. John nodded his thanks and looked over the other accessories.
Greg shot a cocky grin over his shoulder as he started yanking on his warmest clothes.  “You’re just upset I don’t let you get any of this.”  He made it a point to waggle his bum in John’s direction when he bent to tie up his boots.  John rolled his eyes and finally pushed himself out of bed.
John swung his legs over the side of the bed and rose to his feet, stopping on Sherlock’s side to plant a final kiss on his lips before he left.  “Needed to be up to something to begin with for a cock to be blocked, wouldn’t you agree?”  He shot him a wink before heading up to check on Cecelia.
“You’ll come when I say so, beautiful,” John muttered in his ear, starting a brutal pace on Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock let out a series of jagged whines half lost in his panting and John felt his stomach clenching below his wrists in his attempt to hold off his orgasm. Without needing John’s encouragement, he worked on John’s cock simultaneously, tightening his hold as John thrust into them and rubbing his thumb along the slit every time they came in contact.
“Sherlock?”  John turned to stare at him with knitted brows.  Sherlock’s face stared down at the craggy ground, his shoulders slumped as his gaze darted around desperately.
“You’ve always been more inclined toward that particular flower,” Sherlock noted as he came forward to stand at John’s side and stroke one of the petals.
Sherlock shrugged and leaned into John, staring off out the window.  “I assumed you would prefer I didn’t.  I am attempting to humour you.”
“’LIVIA YOUR DAD’S HEREEEEE!” he screeched into the room, jolting both of them to attention.  Sherlock rolled his eyes, but when he turned to the boy his face was warm and friendly.
“Some of it.”  Sherlock nudged the skull, causing it to turn slightly to the left and right at the direction of his fingertips.  “Why did you apologize?”
“I’ve organized for her to stay the night with Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said while crossing his arms over his chest.  John slowly approached him, bracketing him back against the door with his hands on either side of his head.
With a solemn nod, Cecelia rushed into the kitchen and returned with their bag of owl treats.  The bird watched on, intrigued, from where it had landed on top of the dresser and eventually glided down to the floor, tentatively hopping along towards Cecelia.  She held out a treat with a flat and steady palm, ready to be taken once the owl decided she wasn’t a threat, and waited breathlessly for its approach.  It reached out its beak slowly and snatched up the treat to nibble on as it and Cecelia eyed each other.  Within seconds it hopped closer, allowing Cecelia to stroke its back.
“It’s fine, I’m fine,” John muttered, laughing at himself.  “Just.”  He ran a hand carefully up and down Sherlock’s back, starting at the base of his spine and ending at his neck.  “Sentiment.  I’m fine.”
Wiggling his hips to settle further into the mattress, John became abruptly aware of his erection jutting into Sherlock’s hip.  Grinning to himself, he slid his hand down to fully rest on the swell of Sherlock’s arse, messaging the muscle carefully.  Sherlock squirmed and rolled his hips into the mattress just below John’s groin.  He groaned, blowing a hot breath over the nipple closest to his mouth, and John moaned in reply.
John grumbled under his breath, something that sounded a bit to Sherlock like, “It’s too early for this,” before shouting back to the living room.  “You’re the detective, deduce it!”
“As much as I hate to admit it, it’s the truth.”  Sherlock sighed.  “It feels wrong, not doing anything.  I feel…useless.”
“Right, thanks.” John traded the folder of paperwork for the bag, hiding his surprise at how heavy it was. “It starts at six, yeah?”
He decided to make a list of all possible acts he’d be willing to perform with Sherlock, going through it a second time to scratch out any that he wasn’t comfortable sharing in front of a group. Even he felt a shock of surprise at how long the list was, but he shrugged and passed it over for Sherlock to eliminate whatever he disagreed with as well. Sherlock’s face remained blank as he browsed through it and quickly passed it back, agreeing with each and letting John complete the final selections to give to Niall. Reluctantly John kept it fairly straightforward, although he couldn’t help but selfishly add a few particular kinks of his own to fulfill a few of his fantasies. He doubted he’d ever have any other chance to try them with Sherlock, so he couldn’t fault himself for taking the fullest advantage of the situation, as long as Sherlock was ready and willing.
John hummed and wrapped an arm around his shoulders.  He took the quiet moment to observe the rest of the room.  One wall was made up entirely of windows, giving them a view of one side of the hospital wing and a portion of the forest and hills surrounding the castle.  The fabric that currently hung at the corners of the bed waiting to be pulled closed for the evening were a somewhat gauzy black with a tiny design etched into it that was too small for John to make out properly.  When he reached out to pull it closer and inspect it, he let out a bark of laughter that jolted Sherlock from his position.  He lifted his head from John’s chest to glare down at him and John guided the fabric closer so he could look at it too.
“Get out.”  Sherlock’s voice was low enough that it could hardly be heard and quivered with anger.  When Mycroft didn’t move, he forced himself into his face, lips curled into a sneer.  “I said,
Sherlock nodded.  “It’s understandable.  Regardless, her life as we all knew it was over, whether it was through death or a life sentence in Azkaban.  It was unfortunate that those were our only options.”
Sherlock sensed his weakness immediately, guiding John down to sit on the edge of the mattress. He sunk down to his knees before him in a single smooth movement, using his hands on John’s thighs to push them wide apart. He quickly settled between John’s legs and returned to his neck, licking up the length of the opposite side as before. John sighed and leaned on his palms back against the mattress, letting his eyes flutter open. He met his own gaze in the mirrors on the ceiling and his mouth fell open on a groan as he watched Sherlock’s curly head bob as he moved along his neck. Sherlock glanced up at him and followed his eyes to the sight on the ceiling. John felt as well as saw Sherlock grin against his skin in response and lifted a hand to pinch his side playfully. Sherlock chuckled, his breath hot and damp, and John nearly whined in want.
His leg seared with pain once he had enough focus to attend to it.  The curse he’d taken there during the final battle nearly always hurt after he Apparated, whether from the spell itself or from the rough landing.  It gave out on him suddenly now, causing Sherlock to shoot out a free arm to help steady him to the ground.  John leaned back against the base of the statue to stretch his leg out, cringing as the pull of rough muscles sent spasms of pain through his leg.
After digging around a bit, he pulled out a medium length object by its handle and passed it over to John. On first inspection, John thought it was simply a fancier version of the fake guns Niall provided for them. When he properly studied it, he had to swallow his gasp. The handle was designed to look realistic to an antique style hand gun, with a bronze handle and four rows of decorative gold rings leading to an intricate, lace-like design between them. Rather than the usual barrel and muzzle, however, it had a long, slender dildo, completely clear and nestled comfortably into the cylinder. John wrapped his fingers around the impressive base of the dildo, guiding his hand slowly along the various ridges down to the slightly bulbous tip.
Lifting his head from Cecelia’s, John turned back to face McGonagall fully.  “I’ll take care of it.  He should know about our case anyway, particularly if only our authorities are involved.”  He shifted Cecelia to one arm in order to extend his hand to McGonagall.  “It’s been a pleasure to see you again, Professor, even with the topics we had to discuss.”
“Would you just bloody relax for half a second and let me explain?” John snapped with a chuckle and a grin.  Sherlock sent him a scathing glare but remained quiet.  “First off, no, not Harry my sister, Harry my friend.  This one’s actually a bloke and he’s in charge of the Aurors, a sort of a wizard police force.  They have the two men I stunned in custody, but we weren’t able to catch the one who ran – probably Apparated the second he had the chance, he could be anywhere by now.  And we will not be informing Lestrade because a) this isn’t his case and b) I really don’t feel like explaining everything to him as well as to you, at least not right now.  You’ll make it difficult enough on your own, thanks very much.”
Cecelia giggled and handed him her bag.  “You’re very strong, Papa.  You wouldn’t be able to catch the bad guys if you weren’t.”
(P.S. One of my favorite, favorite, FAVORITE Sherlock fanartists, Kelly or anotherwellkeptsecret on Tumblr, opened up commissions recently.  In order to get myself motivated to finish this, I asked for her to do a scene from this story, the bit in chapter seven where Sherlock first tries John's wand.  It came out absolutely magnificent.  Please please please check it out and rave over how fantastic Kelley's skills are here: http://anotherwellkeptsecret.tumblr.com/post/124038351044/greyscale-lineart-commission-for# )
“What’s that phrase you always use?  Something about eliminating the impossible and what’s left is the truth?  Care to test out that theory here?”
“Interesting theory, but I suspect it’s merely silk,” Sherlock replied, lazily opening an eye to look up at John.  “Regardless, this bed is
As John looked down at the construction paper creation, he couldn’t help but start giggling.  Cecelia had formed hearts out of the paper, complete with laced edging and covered in stickers.  In the middle, a picture of the three of them when Cecelia was still a baby waved up at them, obviously developed to be made into a moving wizarding photograph despite the image having been taken on a mobile.  The design of Sherlock’s was nearly identical, the main differences coming from the colours and the picture itself.  While John recognized that the image on his came from Sherlock’s mobile, the one on Sherlock’s came from John’s.  When John glanced over at Sherlock, he was barely hiding a smirk.
“I know, but the sooner this is finished, the sooner she’ll be safe.”  He twisted his hand to rest over the top of Sherlock’s on his opposite arm.  “Once this is done, things can be right again.”
Sherlock sighed, but he took the tea.  “More talking?  How often does this usually happen in relationships?”
Sherlock pulled him fully into a hug, tucking John’s head under his chin.  “If they’re anything like Harry or Ron, I’m certain that everything will be fine.  I’ll be here with you the entire time regardless.”
John grasped Sherlock’s hand tightly and waited for Harry and Mycroft to Apparate.  Once they had, he met Sherlock’s fierce gaze once before taking a deep breath and following.
Cecelia whooped and ran to John, wrapping her arms around his leg.  Sherlock wiped off the knee of his trouser leg as he stood and followed at a slower pace.  They continued their journey through the castle, eventually making their way to the closed doors of the hospital wing.  Rather than leading them directly into the hospital, McGonagall produced a key and guided them to a room at their right.  Once unlocked, she passed the key over to John and waved them inside.
John leaned forward, naturally gravitating further into Sherlock’s space.  “You mean you’ve been doing that before you even knew we’d be coming back?  Just, I dunno, for when we came over to visit?  Before…everything?”
Ten bucks and a high five to whoever manages to dump glitter on Ben's head so we can all appreciate that great visual.
!”  Greg punched the air and began an awkward, shuffling sort of dance across the carpet, humming to himself as he went.  John rolled his eyes and flopped back down into bed, scattering some of his papers onto the floor.
to see them…”  John tapped his spoon against the lip of his mug and frowned.  “I haven’t since after the Battle of Hogwarts.  I’m a bit afraid it would be…weird.”
John let the fond smile he’d been holding back finally fall onto his lips. He lifted a hand to cup Sherlock’s cheek, rubbing his cheekbone with a thumb. “You couldn’t figure it out yourself?”
The next few weeks went by in a similar fashion to those before.  Sherlock took Cecelia down to visit Slughorn and practice potions at least once a week.  Occasionally they would arrive in the midst of a class, but whatever potion they were working on, they would be invited in with a smile and a wave.  Cecelia seemed just as skilled at ‘magic chemistry,’ as she preferred to call it, as Sherlock was.  Somehow, unlike the other classes, they managed to not get kicked out, most likely because they behaved themselves and didn’t attempt to cause trouble for a change.  Slughorn’s need to add Sherlock to his collection of successful acquaintances didn’t hurt either.
John smiled up at him and shook his head.  “Alright, enough of this.  Neither of us is going to sabotage this, yeah?  We’re finally figuring it out and we’re doing it together.”
"Oh no," John seethed, taking a single step forward. "No more guessing games. I've been tossed about by you more times than I know and for once I'd like some fucking answers! I swear to God, Mary, if I have to force Veritaserum down your throat to get the truth, I will do it!"
“Maybe not traditionally romantic, but we aren’t exactly traditional, are we?”  John’s smile grew as he tugged Sherlock along, eventually stopping him at the entrance.  The normally automatic doors were closed, the café to their left dark, and only a few employees stood about preparing to close for the day.  One of them spotted the pair and approached, John pulling him aside to explain.  The employee’s face brightened, his eyes darting toward Sherlock with an amused grin, and he soon led them inside.  Sherlock watched John rather than their surroundings, far more interested in studying him as they made their way down two sets of stairs.  At the bottom, they were greeted with an older style Met car behind an empty podium.  Sherlock gaped between it and John for a moment, John smirking up at him in excitement.
knew?” John asked the room.  Nearly everyone shifted uncomfortably in their seats.  “Why didn’t anyone
Stephen finally reappeared, a bag in one of his hands.  “Found it.  Hopefully your little one hasn’t grown too much in the last few months, John.”  He added the bag to Violet’s contribution, planting a hand on John’s shoulder to squeeze it and smile at Sherlock.  Sherlock’s lips twitched into a small grin and John let him pull away this time when he moved.  Rather than stepping too far away, he snatched up the bag and immediately crowded back into John’s space.
“Do you like it?” he asked quietly, resting his chin on John’s shoulder.  John let out an incredulous laugh and shifted around so that he could look at Sherlock properly.
Sherlock reemerged from the bedroom, dressed all in sleek black, and finished settling his suit jacket around his shoulders.  He held his hands out to his sides, showing himself off for approval, when he realized John was watching him.  From the smug smirk at his lips, he was fully aware of how good he looked, but John was more than happy to indulge him a bit.  He whistled his appreciation and Sherlock rolled his eyes, but his cheeks turned a dusty pink at the compliment.
John rolled his neck, scratching at the back of it. “Well, that’s…yeah, that both a bit flattering and a lot creepy. How’d they manage to write it and be at the show at the same time?”
“Well, that certainly cleaned it, albeit a bit more than I expected.”  Molly eyed him and put the spoon away.  Sherlock shuffled under the scrutiny, but he kept eye contact with her.  “How long have you been working on your magic?”
Niall’s rented studio sat between a cosy tea shop and an art gallery, unassuming fronts for the curiosities in between. The bottom floor held a small reception area and a few offices with a short staircase that led to the performance areas. They met Ian at the front desk going through the forms for that night’s guests. His face lit up at the sight of Sherlock, practically ignoring Niall’s introduction of him and John to gush to the detective and guide him through a brief survey of the office areas. He looked to be close to Niall and John’s ages, with short cropped mousey brown hair and the slightly stocky build of someone who worked out just enough to boast about it. While Sherlock explored the desks and drawers, John caught up properly with Niall, the two of them sharing stories of their lives after graduation. Apparently Niall had been delighted to find John’s blog, both he and Ian becoming huge fans of their escapades. While having problems at the exhibit wasn’t ideal, Niall admitted that it gave him the perfect opportunity to finally reach out to John.
“Not even I can see everything, as my darling older brother loves to point out,” Sherlock scowled, impatience rising.  “What are you refusing to tell me, Professor McGonagall?”
“Remember what we talked about, kid?  Inside voices go double in the library.  We don’t want to bother the other people who are here reading, right?”
James nodded with a soft smile and kissed Mycroft’s cheek in reply.  Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned fully to John, a look of utmost disgust on his face.  Greg, meanwhile, drained the last of his wine and shot Mycroft a look.  “Should have guessed he was part of the wizarding government as well as the Muggle one.  Are you a wizard too?”
Sherlock shivered at John’s breath at his neck, but when his words made it through his distracted thoughts, he blinked in confusion.  “This is a date?”
“That depends entirely on how the next part of the show goes, don’t you think?” Sherlock winked and John’s grin turned hungry as they headed up the stairs, the two of them moving into their appropriate positions easily.
A small voice clearing its throat interrupted them, causing them both to turn back to the rest of the room.  Albus’ blonde friend stood on the opposite side of the table, his hands clenched into flexing fists as he shifted from one foot to the other.  Before he could even work up the courage to open his mouth, Sherlock interrupted him.
“No, it’s fine.  I’ll have both you and Cecelia if it gets to be too much.”  Sherlock’s mouth ticked up into a sly grin.  “I’ll even do my best to keep my deductions to myself if I’m given the right incentive toward a future reward.”
"Be good, bee, and have Jeannette’s mum message me if you spot anything suspicious!”  Cecelia’s giggle followed him as he shut the door, a broad smile on his face.
“He can’t possibly expect me to just sit by while my parents’ murderers go offing more Muggles!” John replied with an incredulous laugh.  “The man Harry knew may have been a hell of a lot younger, Professor, but in spirit he’s not much changed.  I’m a soldier as much as he, if not more so, and inaction is not my usual method.”
“I love you, God, I love you.  I’ve loved you strong enough to make me erupt with it.  I’ve loved you when I was supposed to love someone else, when I thought I had lost you, when I expected to never feel love again.  I loved you at the start and I’ll love you into the end, beyond it, enough that they’d write stories and sing songs about it if they could comprehend just how much I love you.  I love you so much that I thought you had to understand, to realize from how strongly it felt like it needed to come out and make sure you knew.”
“I’m fully aware of how busy you both are, particularly now with this development between you two and your magic, but don’t you dare take that as an excuse not to come by more often,” she scolded as she pulled back.  “I’ll not have you both living only a few hours away and never stopping around!  And for goodness’ sake, bring Cecelia next time.  We haven’t seen that darling child nearly enough since she’s been born and that is simply unacceptable.”
John rolled his eyes and linked an arm through his elbow.  “He means thank you.  And to think, you were doing so well.  Pleasant, even.”
Mycroft looked down at Thor, a tiny smile on his face.  “Though I appreciate the thought, I’m not entirely sure what good it will do.  This may be the final error in regard to my brother that finally destroys whatever bond we might have had.”
John couldn’t help but watch Sherlock’s swaying hips as he ascended the stairs and guided them to the bed. Once beside it, Sherlock turned back around until they faced each other again, keeping their hands lightly clasped. John desperately wanted to kiss him, but he’d purposefully avoided it from the start. Kissing was intimate, done between people who loved each other, and he didn’t want their first one to be for a case. Sherlock deserved as many kisses as John could bestow, but only when they both truly meant it and not just for show.
As he headed up the stairs, he heard Sherlock pop in downstairs to talk to Mrs. Hudson.  He could just hear her exclamations of delight at spotting Cecelia before he entered the sitting room.  Once inside, he let the bags in his hands slide to the floor and stood simply taking it in.  He had visited Sherlock countless times since his return, obviously, but visiting and actually coming back to live there were two extremely different circumstances.  The sensation was contentment that settled in his blood, a feeling he hadn’t felt since the last time he’d walked into this same room with the same intention of living here with this man.
Niall waited in the meeting room for them with another employee, discussing a few papers the other man held. He spotted John and Sherlock and shooed him away, approaching them with a pair of raised eyebrows. “Another Western night?” he asked, looking between the two of them. John glanced at Sherlock and shrugged a shoulder.
Letting out a slow breath, Sherlock tilted her chin so she was looking him in the eye.  “Listen to me very carefully, bee – I don’t want you to be alone with Mr. Doyle, okay?”
“What happened?” she asked sharply.  As John explained as much as he knew, her face grew both sympathetic and horrified in turn.  Once he was finished, she glared down at Doyle with newfound disgust and dismay.
“Well,” John muttered as he came to Sherlock’s side. “This is it.” Sherlock merely nodded and in a few moments, the same employee called out to them and they ascended the stairs.
Turning to John once they reached the bed, Sherlock carefully took his hat and placed it on the floor. They simply stared at each other for a moment, John holding his breath as he waited for Sherlock to begin. Sherlock eventually raised a graceful arm, lifting a single finger to run slowly down the length of John’s bare arm. Shivering at the too faint touch, John felt his eyes flutter closed. The positive reaction seemed to have the right effect on Sherlock as he quickly leaned forward to attach his mouth to the side of John’s neck.
Before John had the chance to respond, Sherlock was off in the direction of their room, closing the door behind him with a solid click.  John blinked after him in stunned silence, shooting concerned looks between his wand and the bedroom door.  Within minutes, Sherlock emerged, impeccably dressed.  He briefly searched the sitting room for his mobile, spotting it on his chair, and clambered around John’s fortress to snatch it up.  Calling out a prompt goodbye, he rushed down the stairs and was out the door.
“Don’t, John.”  When John looked up, Sherlock’s eyes were fixed intensely on him.  “This is not your fault.  You cannot blame yourself for the fact that you seem drawn to the dangerous sort.”
When they left that morning, John gave them a single condition to their adventures in finding a welcoming classroom: nothing dangerous, including chemicals or creatures.  While Sherlock trusted himself to watch over her properly should they find themselves down in Slughorn’s potions lab, he couldn’t say the same when it came to Care of Magical Creatures.
anything.  Magic’s something you’re born with, and the Ministry knows if you’re a wizard whether you’ve got a background in it or not.  They send out the letters to anyone with the proper skill, regardless of whether the kids know it or not.  Otherwise you’d never have any Muggleborns.”
In a few moments, they were sprawled on the floor with their glasses of dark wine, John leaning against his chair and Sherlock resting against his chest between John’s legs.  John took up Sherlock’s free hand in his own and linked them together, palm to smooth back.  He twiddled his thumb against Sherlock’s, rubbing circles against it, and sighed in deep contentment.
John finally found his voice and managed to call out, “Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, that’s great.”  He heard her step away and huffed out a breath.  “Just great.”  He raised his head and glanced down at Sherlock down by his feet.  He watched John over the tops of his bent knees and huffed out a sigh, his arms wrapped tightly around his legs.  “Hey, it’s okay.  You alright?”  Sherlock nodded and John held a hand out for him.  “C’mere.”
Both of the Aurors were shaking their heads in the negative, but a gravelly voice from the cell on the left caused them to freeze.  “Of course they wouldn’t tell you if they noticed anything, not when it was one of them that did the thing.”
“It will be fine,” he muttered into John’s ear, rubbing his nose against it.  John slowly blew out the breath he’d been holding and shifted to rest his temple against Sherlock’s cheek.  “They are our friends, by some mad chance, and they have experienced far worse from us than this.  At least no one has died this time.”
Sherlock groaned and his head briefly fell down to rest against the handles.  John shifted his hands back up around Sherlock’s chest, the trail they made as they went slow and deliberate.  By the end of their journey John’s right hand settled at Sherlock’s opposite shoulder while his left spread fingers wide against his stomach.  Meanwhile, his hips kept a solid, seductive pattern of thrusting along Sherlock’s arse.  John wasn’t entirely sure how welcome his distractions were until Sherlock rolled his hips into him, arching his back into a deep curve that thrust his arse further against John as he dropped his head against John’s shoulder.
Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered at the term of endearment, but he was nodding vigorously before John could even finish speaking.  “I must.  I have to at least try, if there’s the chance…I need this, John.  But you don’t have to – “
“Well, most of them are dead or in Azkaban, so it’s fairly easy.  I’m not sure what’s been done to the ones who managed to escape, but I imagine they have to be on record somewhere so we know what they’re up to.”
The trail of shells he decided to follow led him closer to the water’s edge.  He squatted down on his toes to untangle a particularly knotted group of seaweed, his tongue sticking out of the corner of his mouth in concentration.  Letting out a cry of triumph, he managed to break through and uncover a dark rock underneath it.  He lifted it to eyelevel to study it closer and instantly became distracted by a large shape staring back at him.  Yelping and tumbling to fall with a wet squelch into the sand, he gaped at the creature in disbelief.
“It’s Valentine’s Day, kiddo, that means I get to kiss your papa all I want,” John told her when they pulled apart.
When John came downstairs from his room on Monday morning, it was to an empty flat and a missing bag. He hoped that meant Sherlock was working on his clothes for the night rather than just focusing on possible suspects. As it grew closer to the time when they needed to be at the exhibit, John felt his nerves jolting in a harsh reminder of what he and Sherlock would be doing shortly. In his distress over performing sexual acts with him, John had managed to completely forget that they would be doing so in front of a crowd. He never thought of himself as much of an exhibitionist, and thinking about sharing those moments with Sherlock for the first time in front of a bunch of strangers made him sick to his stomach. The only advantage, he attempted to remind himself, was that the audience would help him keep in mind that the acts would only be for the sake of the case.
John moved to help the driver with the last of their bags, thanking him and sending him on his way with his payment.  Soon he and Sherlock stood alone on the fairly quiet midmorning street surrounded by luggage.  Sherlock rocked Cecelia absentmindedly and glanced around at the bags, his expression somewhat overwhelmed.
It wasn’t until nearly a week after they first arrived at Hogwarts that John heard anything from Harry.  As soon as the owl arrived, he rushed out to find Sherlock on the grounds.  He’d gained a further interest in studying Potions during his nightly discussions with Snape and had gone down to the greenhouses to speak with Neville about plants often used as ingredients.  John encouraged him to go and bring Cecelia with him, hoping some time out in the fresh air would do them both well.  Since they arrived at Hogwarts, Sherlock had been acting a bit off, and John wasn’t sure if it was some sort of illness or an after effect of everything that had happened.  Regardless, John knew getting away from the dusty library and immersing himself into a subject he was passionate about would certainly help.
Sherlock’s expression remained doubtful, but he nodded.  John stepped to his side and Sherlock raised the wand once more, his posture remaining stiff.  Instantly John approached and began lowering his shoulders and wand arm, attempting to pull him into a more natural position.  Sherlock let him move him around without protest.  Once he was finished, John stepped back and waved him on in encouragement.  Sherlock’s eyes darted between John and the kettle before he took a breath and performed the spell.
“Stop dithering about worrying if it’s too soon, for God’s sake.  You’ve been friends since she was born and seeing one another since she began attending Hogwarts roughly five years ago, give or take a few months.  You already know she’ll say yes; what’s the point in getting yourself all irritable by waiting?”
“No,” John replied too quickly.  Sherlock’s grin widened and John rolled his eyes.  “Just get on with what you were saying.”
“It’s gone well, really well,” John added.  “He’s brilliant at everything else, so I knew once he set out to do it he’d be amazing, but he’s still surprised me.  You’d think the wand was part of his hand with how well he performs magic.”
“I suppose.”  Sherlock arched his neck in obvious invitation and John was happy to oblige, trailing a line of kisses down it toward his collar.  “James deserves someone, although Mycroft wouldn’t necessarily be the one I’d think of first.”
“Well, good morning, my lass,” John commented to her, stopping as he passed to plant a quick peck on her head.  He smiled at her happy murmurings in reply and passed Sherlock his tea.  He downed nearly half of it in a single gulp, ignoring or indifferent to how scalding hot it still was.  John munched his own piece of toast thoughtfully while watching Sherlock inhale his, somehow managing not to shower crumbs on Cecelia’s head.  Without a word, John stood to prepare her morning bottle, handing it over to Sherlock in a manner that felt far more natural than it ever did with Mary.  Sherlock deftly rearranged her to create better access between bottle and baby.  “Now, you hollered something when we got here?  Something about metamorphmagi?”
“It isn’t just the one thing, though, lad.  She’s tried to kill Sherlock before and damn near succeeded.”  John’s voice went deadly quiet, so that not even Teddy could hear him.  “I nearly lost him twice before, I’ll be damned if I let someone take him from me again.”  Taking a last calming breath, he plastered what he hoped was a genuine-looking smile on his face and walked into the kitchen.
“God, you’re beautiful,” John groaned, launching himself forward to hold Sherlock by the hips.  “It’s a good thing you don’t want to wear these things all the time because it just might kill me.”
The link in the fic is to the corset that inspired Sherlock's look. Also a big old shout out to this website https://www.theduchy.com/karada/ for information on bondage - it is super fascinating and very informative with good descriptions and visuals for learning about all of this stuff. I have gained so much knowledge I didn't expect from writing this fic (I tried to make that an actual link and failed I'M SORRY just copy and paste)
Charming and caring to a fault, with a smile that made Sherlock’s stomach flip in a way that both alarmed and fascinated him, John instantly welcomed him in. No matter how much he reprimanded himself for caving so easily, Sherlock couldn’t find it in him to purposefully push him away. Even letting John babble into the silence without ever responding did nothing; if anything, it encouraged John to try harder to get him to open up. Finally Sherlock couldn’t help himself, and easier than he ever would have expected, he felt himself falling fast and hard for John. It was the first time someone seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with him, laughing at his comments and encouraging him out of his mind when he grew too focused on his thoughts. John was his first real friend, however, and he hated the idea of screwing it up with feelings, of all things.
Neville met them in the entrance hall, Cecelia happily bouncing in his arms and all of their things packed neatly in their bags at his feet.  At the sight of John and Sherlock, she squealed in delight, her tiny fists grasping out for them while she leaned forward in Neville’s grasp.  With a bright laugh, John snatched her up in a hug and allowed her to curl into his chest.  When she saw Sherlock standing back slightly from them, she reached out a hand to encourage him forward, her opposite thumb firmly fixed into her mouth.  The small smile the gesture put on Sherlock’s face caused John to pull him forward himself to bring their lips together again.  They were encouraged to part at the sound of McGonagall clearing her throat.
Once home, Sherlock rushed up to the flat, leaving John behind in the cab as usual. John had come to a decision during the short trip, however, and was determined to stop him before he could lock himself away in his room. He followed close on Sherlock’s heels, managing to grab his arm as he hurried into the sitting room. Sherlock made a brief attempt at escaping his coat, but soon realised it was futile. His shoulders slumped and he stared at the floor as John came around to stand in front of him.
After Cecelia was bathed and put in her bed for the night, John dragged Sherlock to the sofa.  They tangled themselves together on it, John leaning against the arm with Sherlock stretched on his back between his legs.  While John toyed with the fine hairs at the nape of Sherlock’s neck, Sherlock held his wand before his face, alternating between squirming in John’s grip and inspecting it.
He tried not to think about it much as he emerged out of Paddington Station, blinking up at the grey sky.  Immediately across the street sat a decent sized pub, but even on Afghanistan time, it was a bit too early for that kind of drink.  The last he knew, there was a Costa a few shops down on the left, so he hoisted his duffle higher up on his shoulder and made his way across the street.  At least he arrived at the ideal time between the busy hours, still early enough that the workers down at St. Mary’s Hospital wouldn’t be out seeking their mid-morning pickup yet and everyone on their way to their jobs had already been and gone.
John felt his orgasm creeping up on him and brought his hand up to wrap it firmly around Sherlock’s cock. As he dragged his hand up it and rubbed his thumb roughly over the head, Sherlock encouraged him with an almost constant litany of John’s name. It morphed into a wordless shout as John obviously found Sherlock’s prostate again and he swiveled his hips to get as much sensation out of him as possible. Before he even had the chance to warn John, Sherlock clenched down impossibly tighter on his cock and came, his mouth open in a soundless scream. Sherlock just started to twitch with sensitivity as John came as well, his knees giving out on him and making him slump down against Sherlock’s chest. He shivered through the aftershocks, Sherlock running a gentle hand through his hair keeping him centred on the moment. He finished with a sigh and snuffled against Sherlock’s chest, shimmying his arms under him to wrap around him and keep him in place.
“That’s all it takes, isn’t it?”  Sherlock’s smirk widened and John came to stand at his side.  “Alright, enough playing around.  You wanna learn more spells or what?”  At Sherlock’s nod, he glanced around and spotted a book on the coffee table.  “Okay, so this is a pretty standard spell we all learn in first year, so unlike yesterday, you’ll hopefully have less trouble with it.  You’ve probably come across the levitation charm during all of your readings, right?”
John raised an eyebrow, glancing from the bag to Sherlock’s profile as he looked out the window. “You just so happened to have a collection of steampunk style items hanging around?”
“I’m sure we both understand quite well what you meant,” John interrupted in a clipped voice.  “I’m done here for the day, but I plan on bringing Mary and the baby round tomorrow afternoon before we head back to London.  Do me the favour of being gone by then, if nothing else.”  He continued to make his way back to the car, the shouts of Harry calling his name carrying across the cemetery long after he was gone.
”  Doyle turned to Cecelia, taking in her terrified expression and attempting to rock her as though she was a baby again.  “I’ve never cared about you, either of you, but whatever I could do to distract you from my main goal was the perfect advantage.”
Still uncertain, Cecelia picked up her fork and tentatively brought a small bite to her mouth.  Her eyes widened and she dug in, inhaling the rest of it within seconds.  When Sherlock didn’t immediately try his own food, she tried to pass him her fork.  “Papa, try it!  It’s
“That’s what we have you for, John,” Sherlock replied, letting the waffle ball fly towards the lower cupboards.  Cecelia shrieked and clapped her amusement while Sherlock turned a grinning face on John.  “You’re the responsible one, remember?”
“That’s even if I can get magic to work properly for me to begin with.”  As they entered the apothecary, Sherlock ran a hand through his hair in agitation.  John pulled him aside and put a hand on his upper arm, rubbing his thumb into the muscle with soothing circles.
Keeping a hand on Sherlock’s waist to reassure him that he wasn’t going far, John clamoured around to Sherlock’s back, intent on repeating the movements there. He suspected they were giving tonight’s audience quite the show, and surprisingly John felt a shot of pride at how well Sherlock was responding. In a moment of inspiration, John snatched up the tube of lube and squirted some between Sherlock’s clasped hands. He unbuttoned his trousers with shaking hands and pulled out his own cock, guiding it into the small space between Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock caught on quickly and adjusted his grip until John’s cock could comfortably thrust in his still closed grip.
“No, I noticed.”  John stood and clicked the kettle back on before starting to pull out the necessary materials for breakfast.  “Thanks.  So what was that about me not mucking it up?”
“Christ, John, it’s fine, we’re fine, just.”  Sherlock griped his arse and attempted to pull him in by force.  “Would you please, for the love of God, just fuck me?!”
The next day, Sherlock refused to mention what had happened with Mycroft.  He attempted to go about his usual business as normal, but John could sense that something was off.  His normal exuberance was dulled, as though the knowledge from yesterday had taken the joy from what he had been accomplishing.  A case, normally less than what he would have gone out of the way to take, popped up in the afternoon, and John begged off from it with Cecelia as an excuse.  As soon as Sherlock was off to the Yard, however, John snatched up his mobile to make a call, the plan he had been contemplating set to begin.
“You live to wound me.”  Doyle sighed, his breath rustling Sherlock’s hair.  Guiding him forward with a hand clenched bruisingly tight on Sherlock’s hip and the wand still at the base of his neck, Doyle forced Sherlock against the stone wall.  With the combination of the darkened spot of the hall and Doyle’s black robes shielding their bodies, they were almost completely camouflaged.  Using his hips, Doyle shoved Sherlock fully against the wall until his entire front was forced to either push against it or Doyle.  Choosing the lesser of two evils, Sherlock plastered himself against the rough stone, feeling it rub uncomfortably against the skin below his shirt.
He was able to keep the threat of a blush down to nothing more than a slight pink twinge high on his cheeks, but John felt certain McGonagall noticed it regardless.  “Oh no, no need to apologize,” he continued quickly.  “I’m sure he would have figured it out eventually – honestly, I’m surprised it took this long.  Actually, it was more something that happened today…I take it you know I help him consult on criminal cases?”
John’s eyes widened.  Three creatures stood in the clearing, their outlines somewhat skeletal in shape.  He watched as one ruffled its scaly wings, giving a shake of his head not unlike a horse.  He let his hand slowly fall down from Sherlock’s shoulder, dragging his fingers lightly down his sleeve.  He noticed the shiver it caused to roll down Sherlock’s spine and shot him a mischievous grin as he passed.  When Sherlock didn’t follow, John snatched up his hand and pulled him along.
“One more?” Sherlock whispered into John’s neck, wiggling the two fingers inside him. John swallowed and shook his head, fighting to find his voice as he grabbed at Sherlock’s shoulders.
Sherlock turned his face to bury it in the side of John’s neck. “Please –“ he whispered, his breath hot, and John yelped as his orgasm hit him suddenly, splattering come across Sherlock’s back and the ropes. Sherlock gentled his touch as John twitched and panted through it, letting out a sigh of contentment as John grew soft in his hands. John turned his face enough to nudge noses with Sherlock, licking his lips and almost Sherlock’s as well, they were so close.
“And let the murderers get away from right in front of us?  Come now, John.”  Sherlock’s voice left little room for argument, but it made John even more uneasy.  His attention returned to the three men just as the second was finishing explaining where they dumped the bodies.
John watched the surprise in Sherlock’s eyes meld into a pleased warmth.  His lips formed into a tentative smile that John couldn’t help but return.  They watched each other silently for a few moments before Sherlock broke their contact to clear his throat and study his bare feet.  “Thank you, John.  Despite everything, you still manage to find the best in me.”  He gained back a bit more of his natural confidence by the time he continued.  “I need to get in contact with Mycroft, as loathe as I am to admit it.  I need to find out more about the Holmes those men mentioned last night.  You contacted Harry Potter after I passed out, I’m to assume?”
“Well, if all of this sentimental idiocy is over, don’t you have a job to go to, Mycroft?” Sherlock stated.  He was attempting to keep his eyes averted from the two of them standing together at the bottom of the stairs, but John caught the smile fighting its way out.  “Governments to run, plans to deploy, hell to raise?”
John shot to his feet with the rope clenched in both hands. “Right! Yeah. Good idea. I’ll just…see what sort of theme we might be able to use for tonight.” Before Sherlock could respond, John was out the door and up the stairs to his room.
“John?” Sherlock asked tentatively, his voice small.  John pulled them into a stop and stared up at Sherlock.  His expression glowed with determination as he watched John.  “We’ll find her.  I promise you we’ll find her.”
John set about preparing them both cups of tea, making sure Sherlock actually took a sip of his before setting about building up a fire.  By the time he finished, Sherlock was looking significantly less terrified, though he had brought his knees up to his chest to rest his teacup on them.  John sat back down beside him on the couch and took a few sips of his own tea before finally asking, “Right.  Better?”
“Not just the wand, John,” Sherlock interrupted, his eyes brightening in excitement.  “I want to stop in to Flourish and Blotts to see what books they may have that you don’t and the apothecary wouldn’t be remiss either.  I’ve barely had the chance to try my hand at potions but your materials are practically ancient.”
“Perhaps we could continue this at a later time, John,” he said quietly, speaking down at the papers below the wand.  “I really must get to Lestrade, and Molly has a set of lungs I’ve been meaning to look at.”
“Rose, excellent,” John said as he stepped out of Sherlock’s arms and in front of him.  In a sudden panic, Sherlock grabbed at him to pull him back within reach.  Without thinking twice, John shifted so that he could pull Sherlock back in against his side.  “Will you go get Professor McGonagall for me, please?  Have her come right down here, I don’t want to move Doyle on my own.”
Cecelia climbed up between them and Sherlock placed the album carefully on her lap.  Albus and Scorpius followed her, each of them sitting on one of the arms of the sofa so that they could see as well.  Cecelia flipped through the pages without too much interest until she found the images of John when he was older and looked more like himself.  Her eyes widened and she pointed at one of them with enthusiasm.
John walked to his side and hauled him to his feet, pulling him down with a hand cupped around his neck so that their faces met.  Their foreheads bumped together, Sherlock’s breath fast where it blew into John’s mouth, and he felt the edges of John’s smile against his cheeks.  “Your curiosity is insatiable and I’ve only just stepped in the door.  I’ll answer all your questions, you bloody madman, but first we’re making tea and working on unpacking while I do.”
Inside were various necessities for a night of pleasure, all of it still in the original packaging. “Normally we encourage our couples to bring whatever personal items they’d like to use in order to make the experience as natural and comfortable for them as possible, but seeing as you two aren’t actually together, I just bought some of the usual for now. Anything in particular you’d like, just let me know beforehand, or if you find something you want you can bring it in and we’ll refund you whatever it cost. Whatever’s left after the week’s out, you’re welcome to take.” Niall shot them both a glance, his eyebrow raised suggestively. John rolled his eyes before reaching inside to grab a container of lube to study it.
When Sherlock Holmes woke up sometime after lunch had passed on the afternoon of Sunday, the fourteenth of February, it was to a bed that held one fewer body than typically required.  As he snuffled his face deeper into his pillow, his arm groped out towards the opposite side, fist grasping into the cooled sheets with an irritated mumble.  He rubbed his cheek into the fabric and opened a single eye, glaring across the bedroom.  Finding it distinctly Johnless, he let out a deep groan and buried himself back under the covers.
“Papa LOOK!” she cried as she jumped into the doorway.  Her robes were a light aqua, with a white floral printed dress and shiny silver tights underneath.  Sherlock easily assumed that John let her pick out her own outfit from the bright and abundant colours.  She twirled in a circle, making the skirt and robes spin, and beamed up at them.  “I LOVE robes!”
Adjusting his hat and sticking the room key in his pocket, he made his way out to the meeting room. Sherlock was already there, speaking to Niall who couldn’t help but stare in shocked appreciation at Sherlock’s chosen outfit. When John approached, Niall gave him a once over as well and broke out into an enormous grin.
“No, we’ll just come early tomorrow and dress here,” John replied, nodding his thanks as he tied the shirt around his waist. It didn’t cover all of the damage, but in the darkness of the evening John hoped no one would notice. “Thanks, Niall. We’ll see you then, yeah?” Shooting them a distracted nod, Niall saw them out into the night.
“Yeah, I know,” John sighed, digging through one of the suitcases for a pair of jeans.  His head shot up with a frown from where he knelt, lines of wrinkles forming between his eyes.  “Actually, Mary, I hate to ask it, but…you think I could head out on my own today?  Just today, I promise.  We’ll stop by with Cecy tomorrow, but I think I’d rather be on my own this time round.”
John chuckled. “Well, Niall never said anything about getting some action after the fact. How’d you get all of this info out of them?”
Sherlock regained his composure shockingly quickly, rising to his feet and snatching up his corset and heels. “Lestrade. Yes. I assume you caught him in the act?”
“This has to be magic, that’s the only explanation,” Sherlock said as he shifted to snuggle up against John’s side.  “No Muggle could create such perfection.”
” Sherlock exploded, pushing off from the counter and stalking past John into the sitting room.  He started to pace the length of the room, his hands clenched into fists.  “I know I can’t expect to get it immediately, but I should be able to do
He twirled the stem of his glass before taking a sip.  “Okay, but really, how long did that room take you?  If you did it all on your own?”
“Harry helped me find it,” Sherlock said suddenly from a chair nearby, causing John to jump.  “It’s an aromatherapy rice pack.  Normally one would warm it in a microwave, but Harry talked me through a fairly basic heating charm.  I’ve had to reset it a few times since you fell asleep, but it seems to be holding the heat fairly well now.”
John hid his grunts in Sherlock’s ear, letting his breathy noises and muttered expletives fall where he could hear.  The only other sound in the room was the slapping of skin against skin.  As he felt himself getting close, john skirted his hand up Sherlock’s side, and down the arm Sherlock had thrown above his head, pulling it down to lace their hands together.  Sherlock’s grip was almost painfully tight and he flexed to silently ask for more when John’s other hand wrapped around Sherlock’s cock.  Sherlock kept him close by bringing his other leg up to lock his ankles at the small of John’s back.  John’s whines increased in pitch at the move and his pace faltered slightly as he felt molten heat radiating between all of the places their bodies touched, centring in at his groin.
Once Sherlock had removed John’s holster, trousers, and pants, he clamoured off of him and grabbed the lube. With his other hand, he fumbled for the dildo, clicking the lube open and squeezing a line of it down the clear glass. He tossed it on John’s other side and focused on covering his hands in lube as he situated both of them to his taste. John found himself with his legs spread wide and Sherlock between them, his cock hanging half hard under the low slung holster he still wore. Glancing up at John for confirmation, he lowered his hands towards John’s midsection.
John flinched when he said the word, all of the confirmation on the men’s identities solidified more than enough for him.  He pulled at Sherlock’s collar to bring his ear close to John’s lips, allowing him to hardly even breathe to be heard.  “Out.  Now.  The both of us.  We’ve seen enough.”  Sherlock pulled out of John’s hold and waved him away, eagerly moving forward to continue listening.  As he did, a few curls snagged in the branch directly in front of his face, causing an echoing crack that sounded like a bomb in the near quiet.  The three men in the clearing jumped to their feet in a rush, the unmistakable shape of wands pointing in their direction.
John felt Sherlock stiffen from the tension in the small space between their palms.  “You would have stopped my fall, given the opportunity.”
“I know how to read people’s feelings,” John replied simply, physically turning both himself and Sherlock to engage in different conversations. Michael thankfully didn’t press him further, though John saw the obvious disappointment in his slumped shoulders as he returned his limited attention to Kit. Despite no longer needing to remain so close, John kept his arm around Sherlock’s waist, guiding him silently through the meeting time. It wasn’t until the audience was called up for the performance that he finally let him go.
For a long moment, they lay tangled together trying to catch their breaths, sweat drying on their skin and thoughts buzzing from sensation. John’s cock slid free of its own accord and Sherlock groaned quietly at the loss. Rubbing his messy stomach, John kissed whatever bit of Sherlock he could reach before carefully rolling off him. He only moved enough to bring their faces up to the same level, and they both moved to their sides to face each other.
*whispers* I actually really like this chapter a lot and I think a solid part of that is because I really enjoy steampunk circus themes
“No, she’s fine,” John muttered, staring down at his phone with a blank expression.  The glow of the screen had long since gone dark.  “Just…thinking.”
Chuckling, John shook his head with a grin.  “Honestly, I couldn’t say.  The first time I saw him with a kid was at my wedding, and it’s bloody amazing how he interacts with them.  At least part of it is how he treats them, I suspect – he talks to them instead of at them, just like he talks to an adult.  He told us right off when we found out that Mary was pregnant – well, when
And here we are at the end! Thanks to everyone who joined me on this little journey. And an extra special shout out to Ashlee, the best and funniest beta ever. See you next fic!
“My partner’s the reason we’re here, actually.”  He interrupted the avid discussion between Sherlock and Snape by clearing his throat.  “Sorry to bother you, lads, but I actually need to talk to Severus.  We’ve got a bit of a situation and I hoped you’d be able to help.”
Harry Watson was technically two years older than her brother, but life and alcohol had aged her enough that she looked to be nearly ten years more than that.  Though the curls on her head still had a touch of their old crazed life to them, John’s memory of their madness from their youth helped him to realize just how dull, lifeless, and thin the strands had become.  Wrinkles lined her eyes and mouth, her skin even paler than it was naturally, and her clothes looked as though they barely held together enough to stay on her limp and once curvy frame.  The only jewelry she wore was her former wedding ring, though it looked cheap and paltry with the jewel missing from the center.  The lines at the corners of her eyes, lines that ought to have been a result of laughter and joy, became even more pronounced when they narrowed at the approaching man.
“It’s certainly possible, though I doubt it.  Tom himself checks the charms daily, I know for a fact, but obviously he is getting on in years, not unlike myself, and his sharpness may be leaving him.  I’ll pay him a call to see what he thinks before I return to Hogwarts as well as stop by to discuss the matter with Hannah Longbottom.”
