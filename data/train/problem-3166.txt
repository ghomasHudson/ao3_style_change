“Man, I think stargazing is my new favorite way to spend my evenings.”
For once, his brother is awake before him, and Dean can hear him coming out from the bathroom. Pretending to still be sleeping, Dean waits for Sam to leave to get breakfast before he leaves the bed to take shower. A cold one.
«What is it, Sammy?» Dean asks concerned.
“Hey, Cas. You’re okay. It’s okay. You’re safe.” He gently whispers in return.
«I´m just…»
When they went into the grocery store to get food, and Cas leaned over and kissed Dean on the cheek as he saw how Dean smiled at the freshly baked pie, no one knew who they were and no one looked at them as they shared a private moment. When they had gone into town to get Cas some new clothes, walking hand in hand, no one even looked at them, because to the others in town, they were just a couple who sometimes dropped by, like for example to buy new clothes. No one really knew them there, so the world consisted of only the two of them when they were together.
But sleep gets him before he can finish the thought. He’s finally gotten away from the empty.
And still, nothing can compare.
Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
Just as Dean´s heart beats for Cas.
“This is not how I was gonna do this.” A heavy sight comes from Dean and when Cas looks at him he has his face hidden in his hands.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read / commented / left kudoss! :)
“That one of those boring Norse dudes you and Sam were nerding out about?”
The Shadow also tells Cas how much he hates him. It stings, hearing those words from someone that looks so much like Dean. It tells Cas that he isn’t loved. Or wanted. It hurts.
Dean looked so peaceful and calm behind the wheel of his car, watching as the world passes by outside the window. Cas can’t help but smile at the light in his eyes, the way he too loves nights like these.
As Dean watched one of his favorite movies, Cas was reading a book, his hand played with Dean's hair. Still not saying a word to each other.
«Dean.» His name is only a faint whisper on his lips.
Careful.
Again, I apologize for any typos/grammar mistake, English is not my first language, and I haven't really had the energy to proofread the last chapters.
“We’re good, little brother. We’re good.” Dean pulls back from the hug but sitting there on the floor close to each other, his eyes never leave Cas. A hand cups his face as they stare at each other.
«Sure. Of course. You don’t have to worry about me, Sammy! Go have some fun with your girlfriend.» At that Sam gives him a skeptical and knowing look. Sam knows how Dean handles losing people he loves. It's not pretty. Especially not when he loses
A spark of electricity inside Cas matches the spark in his eyes as he leans into the kiss. Neither of them notices when the lamp beside their closet flicker two times as the small grain of grace acts on its own, Cas too lost in their kiss to notice.
Cas can feel his eyes tearing up and as he reaches his hand to lay it atop Dean against his face, Dean leans in closer, his eyes moving between Cas’s eyes and lips.
Dean has seen beauty before. Seen the world showing off its best side. But, standing there, atop the cliff together with Cas, Dean cannot think of anything more beautiful than Cas standing beneath the stars, leaning against Dean. His lips warm against his face, moving from his jaw, his cheeks, his neck before they once more find Dean's lips.
«Me neither.» Dean breathes, not daring to say the words he actually wants to say. The words that have been taking shape over the last couple of weeks. They terrify him. But, in a good way, maybe.
“‘Bravery is half the victory.’”
«I think that would be nice,» he gives his brother a tired smile, but this time his smile actually reaches his eyes too. «I know you have wanted to organize and help hunters for a long time, and I think you and Eileen will do a great job with ´em.» Sam smiles at that.
The words have been forming in his mind each night since that night when Dean finally found some courage to kiss the angel. He has yet to push them past his lips, but they are there. Always. Every night, they are the last thought Dean thinks before falling asleep beside his best friend, his lover.
He smiles that beautiful smile of his. The smile that countless times has melted him. That smile on anyone else other than the real Dean is a cruel evil. His green eyes going from his lips to his eyes, and then back at his lips, Dean slowly leans closer.
«Shut your pie-hole, Samuel.»
But at what cost?
He´d never heard such beautiful words before.
“I mean it, I’ll come back again, and again, and again. I’ll make sure you never sleep again in your miserable existence. I’ll come back to torture you while keeping you awake. Until you give me my angel back.”
«I’m not going anywhere, Sam. Im not going hunting. I’m getting Cas back. And I might not go hunting after that either.» He shocks even himself with the words, but as Dean studies his brother, he can see that Sam both understands, but also has been expecting his next words. «I think it’s great what you are doing with the young hunters. And I really want you to keep on going, I admire everything you and Eileen are doing. But I think I’m done. I think I want to take a step back. Watch you shine. Watch you save the family business. But I’m done.»
He wakes sometime later to the sound of Cas restlessly sleeping, turning over in Dean's bed, seeming to not find any peace. Dean moves to his side, sitting down at the edge of the bed, gently waking the angel.
Although the rain keeps pouring down all day, making it a slow but quiet day on the road. They don’t talk much while driving, just enjoying each other's company. Eileen enjoys watching the world go by outside the windows, almost getting lost between the trees of the big forest they keep passing through. Sam tries to keep up the good mood from this morning, but worry for his brother keeps distracting him. Eileen, of course, catches up on it right away but says nothing until they stop at a diner for dinner.
With a small flick of his writs, Dean makes a shallow cut at Cas’s throat.
Sam and Eileen's two daughters, arrive at their parent's house hours later to mourn their two uncles. Claire and Kaia join them just moments later. Jack and Claire sharing a long hug, staying close together the whole day, the embraces speaking the words they cannot say.
«I don't want to see how everyone goes crazy if they find you here. It was bad enough when we were going to bed, especially your brother.»
One of many.
Dean draws in a shaky breath.
Just to wrap itself around Dean's body.
Since Christmas is right around the corner, I probably won´t have the time to update in a few days... I got one more chapter in my drafts, but I´m not happy with it atm, but I´ll try to update this weekend.
And the others can’t stop themselves from smiling too.
«Nope.» Cas reaches over, pulling Dean's hand into his lap, holding on to it gently as he strokes the back of his hand.
It doesn’t last long, but it doesn’t have to, because now they both know. Dean reluctantly pulls away from Cas´s lips, their noses gently stroking against each other. Dean rests his head in the crook of Cas’s neck, the former angel holding him all through the night.
They had been on the road for two days now and had already visited four hunters on the way. They all took the invitation to move to the bunker with such joy that Sam knew he was doing the right thing, gathering and establishing a new hunter community. Their joy would be worth all the hard work he knew it would be.
he won’t be able to handle it. But Sam, luckily knows his brother too well when it comes to how Dean handles these things. Sam learned a long time ago there was no point in forcing Dean to talk about
And of course, Dean. Dean filled his spare time with Cas, and Cas filled his spare time with Dean. They had talked about Cas also finding some kind of job, and he wanted to, sometime in the future maybe. But right now? Right now Cas just wanted to
«Your phone. Someone was calling you. And then you got a text.»
«I love you, Dean.»
Dean doesn’t even turn to look at them, only moving closer to the black hole in the wall. He stops in front of it, lingering at the edge of the emptiness ahead.
«Hey, kid.» Dean walks over to them and as Jack stands back up, Dean embraces them. Pulling Jack close and holding them for a long moment. When he pulls away he smiles sadly down at the kid, ruffling their hair. «You have nothing to apologize to. If anyone should apologize, it's me. I know I haven’t been good to you lately, and I really am sorry for all of it. No, don’t try apologizing for me… I know we were just creatures in a sick play, written by God, but I can’t blame Chuck for everything.»
. Everyone else was tied to strings, but the two of you were only tied to
Dean, you fucking coward, he thinks to himself as he studies Cas.
To know the shape of his lips with more than just his eyes.
Then the room explodes in bright blinding light.
The darkness of the garage blinds him after having spent hours in the late afternoon sun, driving around with nowhere as a goal. Dean parks Baby on her usual spot, the main spot at the center, of the bunkers first level where all the cars are kept. His eyes fall to the far corner where the light is even dimmer than where he sits in the impala, where a car is hidden behind some tool cabinets. The gold-colored 1978 Lincoln Continental Mark V was covered up with a white sheet years ago. The car hadn’t been used for a long time, and Dean doesn’t even know if anyone else knows it’s there. After Cas was freed from Lucifer, he made no effort to recover the car, but Dean had brought it home anyway, without anyone knowing. Cas had eventually replaced it by using other trucks, some stolen, some from the bunker's garage.
«You better let me get you back so I can tell you, or I’m going to kill you.»
His heart beating, for Dean.
“Ha! And where would the fun be in that?”
“Ah! Found it!” Cas pushes himself from the wall and hurries further down the hall when he can hear Dean walking towards the door. Rounding a corner just in time as Dean comes out of the storage room, Cas is just able to hear Dean before he hangs up. “I’d love to go for a drive! I could probably be there by tomorrow night. Awesome! I’ll be expecting pie though.”
«Hey Dean?!”» Sam calls after him as he catches up with him in the hall, as Dean is about to enter his bedroom, «I… I need to talk to you about something.»
“Why?” It’s only a whisper from Dean’s lips as he gently squeezes Cas’s hand.
And now...
“Keep it safe for me, Dean.” Cas closes his hand over Dean's. Hiding away the glass ball in the closed palm of his hand. Dean only nods at that, his cheeks blushing slightly.
“Hey, I was gonna ask you about that one. I can’t figure out the language or translation to that book, do you know it?”
Everything.
«You want
At the sound of the other man’s voice, they both collapse in relief. Exhaustion hitting both of them hard. But neither of them can stop smiling.
Sam takes her hand in his as they head for the room they booked earlier. It's a quiet and charming old town and the fresh air tastes of forest and rain. They say you can smell it in the air, right before it starts to rain. Especially in places like this, far away from the big cities, the area surrounding by huge forests and beautiful nature. Looking up at the sky before they head through the door, Sam can see clouds passing by, each one heavier than the next.
Such as now.
“Wait. Seriously?” Aiko had come closer from her spot at the bookshelf.
, he gives him an annoyed look and rolls his eyes, quickly standing up to get himself something for breakfast.
“Didn’t think you were the salad-type.”
Cas smiles up at him, watching how his green eyes shine in the dark, a smile spread wide across his face.
Cas leaves the bunker and doesn’t return until the dark sets in, walking past their living room with a quick “good night” before locking himself in his room.
Only being able to hear one side of the conversation made Cas even more curious.
As Cas walks into the kitchen the next morning, the brothers go silent as they watch him sit down at the table.
Back in the bunker, everything is the same as before, but after they have all gone to bed that night, Dean can’t sleep, as his room no longer brings him peaceful nights.
Dean and Cas.
«It's no fun when you do that, angel.» The shadow circles him, Cas following the motion to keep his eye on the black Shadow. «It is, however, funny how you think I would just let you sleep peacefully when you keep waking me up all the time.»
. So you keep it safe. My heart. My love. My grace. It's all yours anyway. It always has been.»
“You were gone for four and a half-day, Dean. We were worried sick.”
«What?»
Soft.
He loves how happy Eileen looks when they are deep in conversation like this. And he loves how happy Dean is, watching his angel.
Dean.
“Can I ask you something?”
When he couldn’t breathe anymore, Dean pulled away, only to bury his head against his neck. He hugged him so close, so tight, that Cas stumbled another step backward, crashing into the wall behind him. Dean didn’t care if they’d fell down the stairs.
Dean turns back to Cas, to his husband, and gripping his green tie, Dean pulls him in for another kiss. He will never get enough of those lips.
Dean had to hide his bright smile when Sam, a week later, got a call from a fellow hunter asking them for help. Dean said yes right away.
«We wasted so many years, didn’t we?» Dean chuckles against Cas´s lips, tears running down his cheeks as he kisses his angel once more.
«Don´t call me cute. I’m not cute.» Dean says as he pretends to look annoyed, hating the word, even though he kind of loves it. As long as it's Cas saying it.
“What makes think I can’t just have that if I want to? I can just throw you out, lock the door, never to hear from you again.”
Thank you so much for reading!<3
So he can handle the times the Shadow has Dean hate him.
The eyes are wrong.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I never thought you would be able to see that, least of all survive it. You should’ve turned away, Dean.”
As the Shadow throws them out of the void, Dean and Cas are thrown away from each other as they crash to the floor of the bunker. They land almost on the exact spot where Cas stood as he was taken by the empty. The room is shaking as if an earthquake had hit the bunker, but it quickly dies down as the black hole in the wall closes up, leaving nothing.
“Cas, what happened to your throat?” Sam asks after pulling away from the hug. Cas places his hand on his throat finding a cut, still bleeding.
«Really?»
“Then it's a good thing I’m planning on staying here in your arms for as long as I draw breaths.”
Doesn’t turn to look back.
Standing there at the side of the road, in the middle of nowhere, Cas is kissed by Dean for the first time. And second. And third...
“Dean...” Cas’s voice is weak as he rests his head against Dean's shoulder, his forehead fitting perfectly against the crook of Dean's neck.
Words of love are whispered in the dark as their bodies find their purpose together. Sweet words who have lived on their lips for so many years, but never escaped. Words only meant for each other.
His hand gripped the back of his tan trench coat. He needed him closer.
Cas died before Dean could tell him that he loved him back. He almost said it on several occasions, but he was always too much of a coward to speak the words out loud. Cas had died without anyone telling him they loved him.
«Are you going to tell me where we are going?»
Cas will never recover from that.
He quickly gets out of bed, almost tripping on his slippers beside his bed. Still, in his pajamas, he sprints down the hallway to his brother's room. The bunker is dead quiet.
Gasping for air, Dean takes a few moments before he has the strength to stand on his two feet again. Raising himself from the floor, his eyes search out the source of the light.
«I just... I had to get him back first, Sammy. I had to tell him. I know I have a family here, I know I have you. But I don’t think I would be able to live without
“Come on, we should get you all some food.” Eileen smiles as she takes Sam's hand and leads then towards the door.
. And only you.»
«Cas, was that you?»
let anyone drive the
“Don’t ever leave me again, you dumb son of a bitch.” The words would have sounded rough coming from anyone else. But Cas can hear the softness of his voice. If Cas didn’t know better, he’d say it almost sounded like it was filled with love.
he thinks to himself as he studies Cas. He’d promised himself that he would tell the angel how he felt. Tell him as soon as he got the opportunity, finally say the words he’s been holding back all these years. The words he could finally say, and had been needing to say out loud for the last two months. He´d wanted Cas to be the first to hear them, so he hadn’t said them out loud to anyone.
Slightly tightening his grip on Cas´s hand, Dean smiles at the quiet room. Their hands intertwined, rested above his heart.
Eileen's free arm embraces Sam as she bows down to place a kiss in his hair. Whispering words for him to hear as he leans into her touch. Eileen reaches over and takes Jack's hand, raising their hands to place a gentle kiss on the back of their hand.
Dean cups his face, leaning their foreheads together. Actually enjoying the silence, he closes his eyes and gently brushes his lips against the other man’s. His other hand grabs his arm, but as he brushes against his elbow, Cas faintly groans as if in pain.
Because he could have had all the things he had never dared to even wish for. He could have had it all. Had he not been such a coward. Never being brave enough to face his deepest fears, Dean would forever live in regret, knowing he never had to fear them at all. And now Cas was gone. Cas had told Dean everything he had ever wanted, needed, to hear. And then he was gone.
«I'll be in my room,» He turns and looks at the couple before heading for the kitchen to find some snack, «let me know when you leave.»
But he won’t leave until Cas is with him.
«About Dean?» Of course, she knows. Although they haven’t known each other for more than a couple of years, she knows him better than most people.
Knitting their fingers together, their intertwined hands rest on the seat between them all the way home.
Stopping in front of the closed door, he draws a shaky breath as he slowly opens the bedroom-door. A sleeping figure is sprawled across the bed, half covered in a blanket. Dean sleeps heavily in his double-sized bed. At the sight of his brother, Sam lets out a relieved breath closing his eyes, leaning his forehead against the bed.
“I love you?”
“Morning, little sis.” Dean smiles at her before once again stealing Cas’s fork to fill his mouth with too much food. Sam can’t help but smile at his brother. It’s even in the way they eat their breakfast.
His kisses are going to kill him.
His lips.
“Dean, shut up.”
It shone stronger now, glowing more brightly, that light that had always been there. Never dark, only ever shining stronger and stronger.
He had told his brother that the time alone and the silence would do him good. Told him that he didn’t have to worry about him, Dean was fine. He hadn’t really talked to him at all after everything that had happened, he’d been too focused on finding a way to get Cas back. Sam didn’t know what Cas had told him that night. Hadn’t told him how Dean's regret was slowly killing him. He couldn’t say it out loud. If he told his brother what Cas had told him, he would break. Dean would break. So he had welcomed the silence, as Sam and Eileen left him to his own thoughts. But it only made everything worse. This silence was an unbearable silence that filled the absence of the one thing he never was able to let go of. The silence left by him.
Their days are always spent together, and often together with the other residents of the bunker. Sam has just started digitalizing the library and Dean and Cas have helped where they can. But Dean suspected they weren’t much help as neither of the two really knew anything about technology.
“You’re beautiful.”
It's sad, and heartbreaking (I kinda cried writing this), but I also kinda find such endings beautiful, because Dean and Cas, and everyone else got to live a happy and long life.
Cas was watching some movie on the tv, but his eyelids got heavier and heavier. Studying his beautiful face, Dean smiled as he just sat there and observed how the angel was slowly falling asleep. He didn’t know anyone could get this much happiness from watching another slowly falling asleep. But he did. And he couldn't stop smiling, feeling his own eyelids slowly wandering downwards.
And when he came back, without him, not having been able to save Cas, all Dean wanted to do was give up. He no longer had something to live for. He had a reason in Sam to stay alive, but it was Cas who had given him a reason to live. When Cas finally returned to Dean, he knew the answer. He knew he loved Cas in a way that scared him more than anything because he knew he would always be alone in feeling that way. Except, the angel had felt the same way.
“Okay, come on angel. Let's get you some rest.” Dean says as he leads him down the hall towards the bedroom he’s been assigned, but never really used. But then Dean passes Cas’s room, leading him into his own.
«I´m no angel anymore, but you can have them all. They’re all yours, and yours only.»
His hands keep turning pages of books, his eyes keep searching the words, but not his mind. His mind is on the many memories of the past twelve years, that he never thought he would need to hold on to, to be able to continue on. The memories of all the years he spent in hell, were blurry and distant in his mind. What he remembered were those eyes. And then the voice that spoke to him.
“I like it.” Cas can feel Dean smile against his lips, making him smile too.
“Sure, Dean.”
Removing his hand from Cas´s bare skin is met with an almost disappointed look from the angel, but is quickly replaced by a pleased smile as Dean leans closer. But instead of closing the distance between them, Dean pushed them both off the hood of the car, before taking a step back, pulling Cas with him by outstretched arms. As he turns, walking back towards the side of the car, Dean leads his lips back to Cas´s, their warmth burning away the cold of the night. With easy steps, Dean moves towards the impala again, pressing his back against the chevy door, dragging Cas against him. Crashing into his chest, Cas deepens the kiss.
Awake before Sam and Cas, Dean leaves to get breakfast the next day, but before he leaves their bed, he gently presses his lips against Cas´s. The angel doesn’t wake, but Dean thinks he can see a small smile on his lips as he pulls away, reluctantly leaving the warmth of their embrace. He’s smiling all day. In a better mood than he has been in for a long time. A smile spreads across Cas’s lips too, each time their eyes meet.
The words are written in an old-fashioned beautiful handwriting, the kind only old people use these days. The sight of those two words makes him freeze, and when the turns to the next page after a long moment the two words there makes him drop the book:
When Dean, still kissing him, leans closer, his arms going to his waist, the lightbulb directly over them explodes with a loud snap. Dean rapidly pulls back from the kiss, but gather his arms protectively around the angel and pulls him even closer to his chest. Sparks rains down all around them, before the spot they are standing in turns slightly darker in the absence of the light. A moment passes and Dean slowly looks to the angel's face who is blushing and trying not to meet his gaze. A small but almost embarrassed smile plays on his lips.
He remembers the year in purgatory, how he spent a whole year fighting monsters and whatever else he faced there. The memory of longing for his best friend, having to find him and keep him safe. He was an angel, and still, Dean was determined to protect him with his life. It was sometime during that year in purgatory, that Dean started to really think about what his feelings for the angel meant. He spent a year looking for the angel, but also for an answer that had always been right in front of him.
“Cas.” It was only a broken whisper on his lips as he released a breath against the angel's neck.
Dark.
«I´m full after that huge burger, but thanks. Maybe tomorrow.» Dean can see how tired Cas is, his eyes sleepy as they smile at him. Dean hurry to finish his pie, dragging the former angel with him back to the motel, only stopping shorty by the store.
When Jack leaves, Cas is too tired to do or say anything and gladly collapses on the bed.
Joining Sam and Eileen at the table, Jack appears from the opposite hallway and takes a seat too.
Dean leans in close, lips hovering over the other man’s lips for a few moments before he can’t take the lack of touch anymore and closes the distance between them again.
When he opens them again, Dean is so close that Cas forgets to breathe. And then Dean's hands slowly move from his face to his throat. Holding Cas by his throat. Still staring at his lips, as close as possible without touching, a wicked grin spreads across Dean's face.
Standing in the middle of the dark hallway, Cas’s body goes still as he leans against the wall. He can feel his face falling from a bright smiling expression to a sad one.
«Good night, Dean.»
«I never did doubt it, Dean. You were the one who did.» Jack smiles a sad smile at him as they scratch the fluffy dog that sits beside him. «Cas has been my father since before I was born, but you too have been my father, ever since I was born. And I never doubted your love, even when you tried to hide it, your love bled through. Yes, I tried hard to make you show it sometimes. But just because you didn’t show it, doesn’t mean I didn’t know it was there.»
“I’m glad I didn’t. If I did I would’ve never gotten to witness the most beautiful being in the entire universe.”
“Seriously?” Aiko half whispers to the bookshelf.
So, he did the one thing he knew he could do. He walked to the kitchen, pulling out another bottle of beer, sat down on the floor, and started drinking.
Sitting down Dean turns his eyes away from Jack to hide the tortured look he knows is shining in his eyes. After a moment of hesitation, Dean once again asks Jack about the one thing that has been on his mind since that night. «Do you think we can get him back?»
«The dungeon.» She only nods as they both turn to sprint down the hallway, not getting there fast enough.
«You sure you don’t want any pie?» Dean leans over to Cas, sitting beside him. «It’s amazing.»
“Chuck. He came to get Lucifer out, so when he was fighting with the Shadow, I snuck out.”
Cas had once said Dean wouldn’t be able to see his true form, nor hear his true voice, but this time he does.
«Listen, Sam. I know I haven’t talked much about stuff, and I’m sorry if…» He hated how hard it was to talk about this. Even with his
«Was... did…» Sam is struggling to push the words past his lips. His heart was heavy. Eyes clouded. Throat closing up.
“Wait... why weren’t you asleep? Why were you awake?” Sam frowns at the angel sitting on the bed in front of him.
Cas buries his head in the space between Dean's neck and shoulder, drawing in a trembling breath. For just a moment he wants to know what it feels like to hold Dean like this. Being held by Dean like this. He wants to forget the world and just get lost in this moment.
«I can’t sleep without you.» Cas gives him a look telling him he doesn’t believe him, since they both know Dean has the ability to fall asleep anywhere and anytime, without problems. Chuckling quietly he brushes their lips together again. «Fine. I don’t want to sleep without you. You know I don’t believe in that bullshit.»
“Dean. Am I... Are we...” half-awake, Cas looks around, eyes are not really focused, mind not really awake.
This was supposed to just be a destiel fic, but Sam and Eileen deserved so much better too. So, there will be some chapters with a SAM pov, to have some cute Saileen, but mostly to see Dean and Cas from the other´s perspective (we all know how blind the two of them are, and how everyone else can see them...).
Cas cups Dean's face with his free hand, gently kissing him, and as he pulls back he simply says, «Look up.»
«I found it one day when I was out walking, maybe a week ago, and I’ve come here a couple of times. It’s so peaceful. I don’t think a lot of people come here, I don’t know if anyone even knows of the place. The dirt road hasn’t been used for so long I’m surprised it’s not overgrown yet...»
This chapter turned out a little short, I didn´t plan on including this, but I just had to get 15x20 out of the way... So yeah, that awful hunt was just a bad dream! Everything is okay! Dean, (everyone) is alive! (Cas will of course come back too)
“Yeah?” Looking up, Cas watches as Dean finishes his burger. They’re parked just outside town, sitting against the hood of the impala and enjoying the late summer sun.
(don't worry, Dean will have his Cas back soon, I promise. I'm not c*w)
Hello, Dean.
«I love you, Eileen» he whispers, nearly moving his lips, but she sees as reaches over to hold his hand. Smiling as he watches the world go by outside the window, Sam realizes he’s finally happy. Finally living. They’d made a home, together. They defeated Chuck, free to write their own story. He’s
(See the end of the chapter for
«Why didn’t you tell me?» He says in a low voice after a too-long silence.
He can see Cas perfectly.
“Hello, Dean.”
«I still regret some of the things I said.»
Friends and family are told that same night. The news spread fast throughout the hunter’s network, now reaching across the country and even beyond the borders. Each hunter who has heard their names will grieve them, but smile for them with the knowledge that they made it. Dean and Cas lived.
“I’m...”
Simply, because the two of them wanted to figure each other out. Learn each other. Before everyone else wanted to figure them out and learn them. Dean and Cas had known each other for over a decade, and still, he found new things to learn about Cas each day.
Dean has never felt so alive before.
“Cas. It’s me. I’ve come to being you home. I’m not leaving you here.”
“Don’t worry. I don’t wanna see you either. Ever again. Now send us back.”
“I seriously thought they were married...” Alex has opened her book again, but he can see her unfocused eyes trying to figure it all out.
It lasts forever.
«Dean´s been watching me all my life, living for
They had been on the road all day, heading north to help a fellow hunter with a vampire nest. They didn’t know how long they would be on the road, maybe a couple of days, but it wasn’t like they had anything they had to return to. Well, Sam would probably want to go back to Eileen before too much time passed, but not Dean.
“I don’t know why... he’s probably going to use him against you, us, somehow.” He lets out a heavy sigh as he watches Jack. His son.
The road that Dean has driven all his life was suddenly running through heaven. Cas crashed into his life, and blessed this broken road that Dean had been on all his life.»
Cas is met with empty darkness as he opens his eyes. But he’s not alone.
“Are you saying...”
,» Eileen whispers as she slides from the hood of the car and moves towards him, pulling her arms around his waist, resting in his arm hook, her back against the car.
“Maybe I’m still working on that bravery thing.”
But… these words are a good place to start.
Standing in front of him.
Breaths too slow.
«Oh, Dean…» Eileen looks up at Sam, who is still standing at the bottom of the stairs. Not able to say anything. She reaches out and touches his hand, unfreezing him.
“I’ve never seen anything like that. Anything that beautiful. You’re beautiful, Castiel. I love you.” Seeing the tears escaping his eyes, Dean leans closer, brushing his lips gently against Cas’s. Smiling, Cas chases his lips in a sweet kiss, his hand gripping Dean tighter.
All of him.
good at hiding your feelings. Just not for
Half an hour later, Miracle follows him closely as Dean walks into the kitchen, smiling at the smell of bacon filling the room. His brother is already seated at the table, waiting for him. At the sight of Dean and Miracle, Sam smiles before pouring a cup of coffee and placing it by Dean´s seat. Then he places a plate of food by his feet and Miracle happily leaps across the floor to devour the food.
“Dean...”
, ‘the circle of the world’. It’s the Old Norse kings’ sagas. Could be useful to know if you were to deal with some ancient Norse kings. Scandinavians can be tricky people.”
“Is it a question?”
Seriously, Sam. I'll be okay.»
Happy New Year everyone! 2020 has been a shitshow I never thought could exist, but we got canon Destiel (and two new ts albums - where one clearly confirms heller!Taylor) - something I never thought I would live to see.
“You just fucking stole my moment and I don’t know if it makes me angry or just even more in love with you than I was already. Although I didn’t think that was possible.”
It’s the greatest love story ever told.
Dean is standing in the middle of the room, one hand closed around one of his jackets. A green one with some kind of dried blood stain, fresh blood beside it. Dean's other hand hangs loosely by his side, blood dripping to the floor.
Thank you so much for reading! :)
Dean is left with a feeling of emptiness when the strings disappear.
“No. No, don’t apologize.”
His body hitting Cas like a sinking ship as he embraces him.
«I´ll be back when he’s with me.» If it hadn’t been for the dead quiet of the room, Sam would never have caught Dean's words. He almost doesn’t hear them, even in the quiet.
Dean also helped to teach and show the other hunters, especially the youngest, some tricks he’d learned over the years. Taught them what Dean knew about whatever it was they wanted to know. Cas also helped some with the angelic- and cosmic-themes, but Cas seemed to like better to listen to Dean. Sometimes contributing with information, but for the most part, just listening and observing Dean, which Dean found kinda cute.
Eileen and Jack greet them with huge smiles, and everyone gives Cas a hug after he raises from the floor. Jack´s hug lasting longer than the others. Jack melts into the embrace as Cas holds his son tight. Dean keeps close to him all the time.
Dean is the first to move. Crawling. Towards Cas.
“Okay.”
A hand rested in the other's lap. A head rested on a shoulder. Foot rested across a lap. Arm rested around a shoulder. A head rested in the crock of the neck. Hands intertwined. A thumb gently stroking the back of a hand. Feet tangled together on the couch.
Up the stairs.
They had been on the road for about a week now and only had two more nights until they were back at the bunker. Dean was in no hurry to get back, and he had to admit he wouldn’t mind a couple of more nights in some shitty motels. The bunker might be the place they called home, but for Dean, it wasn’t about the place. It was about who he was with. His brother had always been home, and over the years Cas had become home too. Dean had never felt more at home as he did in the arms of his angel.
And if Dean thought their first kiss was the best thing he has ever experienced, then Cas’s kisses will for sure kill him slowly. Kiss by kiss..
Getting up in the mornings were the hardest part of the day. He usually woke with a calm and peaceful feeling, but that was quickly replaced by a much darker mood as he remembered. Remembered everything that had happened recently.
«Good night, angel.»
«Hey, what are you thinking about?» Eileen interrupts his thoughts, Sam turning to smile at her.
«Would you like a couple more of those?» Cas says shyly as his thumb lightly rests against the freckles on his cheeks.
“I didn’t mean to, I’m sorry. But it’s okay Dean, I understand you’ve found someone you’ve developed feelings for? That’s great.”
For a long time, Dean just stands there, not able to move. Mir is staring up at him, expectantly waiting for Dean to do something.
They only pull apart when Dean gets a message, their phones long-forgotten bringing them back to the world. Quickly typing out a reply, Dean steps close to Cas again.
At one point, Dean is so tired from walking that he just wants to lay down and sleep. Or at least sit down and rest for a while. But he don’t. He keeps walking. Keeps searching the quiet.
Sam was still worried about the lack of contact from his brother today, but he had to smile at the thought of what they were going to do. He and Eileen had been talking a lot on the road about what they wanted to do. And he couldn’t wait to get started on forming this community, to make life easier for future generations of hunters.
“If you don’t mind me asking, Sam. How long have Dean and Cas been married?” Surprise clear on his face, Sam started laughing at Alex, who shared confused looks with Taylor, Aiko, and Zane.
“I never thought I’d ever be brave enough to tell you.” The wind rustles the threes at the side of the road, sending a chill down Cas’s back as it reaches them. He’s not sure if it’s the wind or Dean that makes him shiver, but he welcomes it anyway.
His cheek.
“Who said we ever got home last night?” Dean winks at his brother as he takes the fork from Cas, overloading it and bringing it to his mouth.
At first, Cas is too shocked by the action that he freezes, but when it’s clear that Dean isn’t pulling away, Cas finally leans into the kiss, melting against him. He reaches up to hold on to the hand Dean is resting against Cas’s face.
«You are way too wise for your age, kid.»
In the blink of an eye.
“I’m listening.”
quietly to each other, he has to smile too. Although not interested in how they spend their nights, he’s still happy for his brother. Happy for them both, his brother and his best friends.
Mostly, Cas stayed asleep.
“What is it?” Sam asks as he takes the book Cas is handing him.
. But they never did. Dean couldn’t stand it anymore, the silence in the library. The weight on his shoulders pressing him down. The knowledge of how this was all his fault and he couldn’t do anything about it.
Eyes blinded by the darkness.
Dean answers Cas´s sweet laughs with kisses behind his right ear. Dean had pretty quickly found that small area to be Cas´s most sensitive spot, and he absolutely exploited that tiny bit of information to the fullest. The small and quiet giggles escaping him as he melts against him gives Dean the upper hand. Standing up, still in Cas´s arms, he turns them around so that Dean has him trapped this time.
«I always found the road to be a comfort in itself, but then… then I met you, and Dean. And you showed me what a real home is. I haven’t had a family since I was 14, and you showed me, reminded me what family is. I love you, Sam.»
“What is she making?” Dean gives his brother a bright smile at the mention of food.
The demons are long gone, destroyed by the heavenly light. So Dean takes a step towards his angel. Cas reacts with fear, pulling further away from Dean in fear of hurting him. But Dean reaches out a hand and moves closer with careful steps, eyes wide.
Dean places the glass ball close to the wound and watches as the angels grace leaves Cas, absorbed into the small ball of glass, which starts to faintly glow a bright light. As Dean looks up he can see that the Shadow has transformed into its true form. A black shadow. Red eyes glowing in anger.
through the small gestures. How they showed their feelings in something as simple as a touch on the shoulder, a touch at the elbow, a hand on the other back. How instead of standing in front of everyone, kissing, they would sit in a room full of people and only have eyes for each other. How they always were drawn to each other. If placed in a dark room full of people, they would know at once where the other was, finding each other right away.
«Baby better not get dirty.» At that Cas laughs quietly as he watches Dean drive down the bumpy dirt road. The impala's headlight lights up only what is right in front of the car, the forest around them hiding whatever is between the trees.
«The best, with you by my side.»
«Your signing is getting better.» She says before she smiles even wider, and then signs
“How long have I been asleep?” His eyes wander from Dean to their hands, resting above his heart. He doesn't say anything about it, but Dean notices the way his lips carefully smiles at them.
“Oh God, guys, please... I haven’t even had my coffee yet.” Standing with his back against them, Sam can still hear it when Dean leans over to give Cas a big and noisy kiss. When Sam hears them both
All of it. Gone.
It’s dead quiet.
“Always.”
Sometimes they would talk in quiet whispers to each other for hours. Sometimes Dean was eager to show Cas one of his favorite movies, having them sitting or laying closely beside each other either in the living room or in Dean's own ‘cave’. Hands always somehow touching the other.
Castiel usually spent his days in the bunker helping the others, or Sam. He’d been working on translating a section of books in Enochian, and some others that were written in such old languages that it was impossible for anyone else to translate. He seemed to really enjoy it, the reading and the writing. Some days he would disappear from the bunker for hours. He’d told Sam that he enjoyed the peace he found in nature, so he was often drawn to the forests close to the mountains.
“It’s more about what you didn’t do.”
. His human heart beating against his chest.
Dean is almost running now. He screams his name inside his head. He won’t speak until he has him in his arms. He can’t risk waking the Shadow just yet. But he screams Cas’s name as a prayer.
“Me?” Cas is so shocked he feels like he’s paralyzed, not able to move a single cell in his body.
“Yeah, you, dumbass.”
Brought him back. Brought him home.
«Dean.» His name is only a faint whisper on his lips.
The characters should have gotten to chose their ending, not the writers who don't even know their own characters... we all know, whether you like the ending or not, that the end wasn't the character's choice, it was rather their worst nightmare come true, and that will forever haunt me.
Cas blushes deeper at Dean's words and the look he gives him, makes Dean's stomach flip a thousand times. The stupid butterflies in his stomach attack him everywhere every time Cas gives him that loving look. He hates those stupid butterflies. But he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“So what does that say?”
“No plans.” Cas doesn’t really need food, but he’s come to enjoy it, even managing to taste it, so when Dean silently offers him a sandwich from his plate, he takes it while giving Dean a small smile.
It’s the last thought Dean remembers, before falling into a deep sleep in the embrace of an angel.
«What? Did you say anything?»
The light of his life.
«Dean? Are you… are you
«Hey. How you feeling?» Sam asks sipping at his coffee.
Moments pass by as cars pass them, heading down the main street. It stopped raining an hour ago, but it still lingers in the air. Eileen patiently waits for Sam to continue, when he feels like it. It’s one of the many things he loves about her, how she understands him, and what he needs in moments like this. How kind she is, and caring.
«Dean, don’t apologize for that. I knew there was something you weren’t telling me, but it wasn’t my place to make you tell me. With everything that has happened, no one blames you for anything. You’re my brother, and I will love you no matter what, even when you shut me out or don’t feel like talking. I’m glad you told me though, and I’m glad to finally see you get what you deserve. Being loved the way you deserve to be loved. Besides, it's not like I didn’t know about the two of you.» Sam was watching him with glassy eyes, a careful smile on his lips.
Sat down on the floor and started drinking again.
“You better keep your promise, Winchester.” And then the Shadow is gone.
“What about you Sammy?” Dean looks over at his brother, waiting for an answer. Sam looks between Dean and Cas for a moment before shaking his head.
Cas moves to follow the others from the room, but as he starts moving, the exhaustion takes over and he sways on his feet, falling into Dean who was walking behind him.
They don’t talk, but as Dean looks back to see his brother sleeping in the backseat, he smiles to himself, and without meeting his eyes, Dean reaches his hand over to grab Cas´s.
“Dean! Oh my... Cas!” Sam exhales loudly, clearly relieved at the sight of them. “Are you okay?”
At the look his brother gives him, he adds, a little too harsh «I don’t wanna talk about it so stop looking at me like that.»
«You don’t seriously believe that…»
They have all the time in the world to make a life together, and Cas could not think of anything that he wanted more than that. At the thought of them together and the joy it brought him, something seemed to spark inside him, sending electric waves through his body. He’d felt it before. That little spark. The small portion of grace that remained inside this,
«Sam. Get in the back.»
Except, the angel had felt the same way.
“Dean Winchester himself. Losing himself in the void of darkness, only to get his hands on one insignificant trench-coat-wearing angel.”
The true shape of the soul he loves.
«I´ll see you tonight, sleepyhead.» Turning around in between Dean's arms, Cas smiles up at him as he gently lays a hand against Dean's neck.
to him. But he took a step back. «It’s better if you just let me sleep for an eternity. That way we could both have peace.»
Onto an unknown road.
“Dean...?” His voice is only a small and hoarse whisper in the darkness. At the sound of his voice, Dean can’t hold himself back anymore and throws his arm around the angel, embracing him for a long moment. He doesn’t want to let go of the angel, but they aren’t safe yet.
«What do you mean?»
«Uhm… 203! It´s this one.»
As he reads his vows, tears stream down Dean´s face, and they are joined by even more as Cas reads his. The world around them is so quiet, so peaceful that Dean isn’t sure if its even real.
«Cuuute and in looooove.» Dragging out the words again, he walks towards the door, only turning back to Dean when he reaches the hallway. «I’m happy for you, Dean.»
Happy Birthday, Dean!<3 you deserved the world.
Dean lay awake for a long time before he finally fell asleep. Cas had fallen asleep almost right away, his face turned towards Dean, breathing softly. They lay close, but not touching, although Dean wouldn't have minded if they did. He looked at Cas for a long time, memorizing every inch of his face, tempted to move closer, but not brave enough to actually close the small distance between them. He finally fell asleep to the sound of the man beside him, breathing softly, warmth radiating from his body.
Cas I’ve been telling you about!”
«Just... when we are gone... If there is a case about vampires, or a wierd case with kids missing and stuff... don’t go.» Sam looks to the floor, no wanting to meet his brothers eyes.
«Yeah. Would you be okay though, staying here all alone for a while?»
That makes Dean realize what’s been happening to the angel.
And then he was running.
«Cas.» Two green sleepy, only half awake, eyes look up at him, a smile spreading across his face as he sees Cas is already awake.
“For years, I’ve known that I’ve wanted you. And for years I’ve believed you didn’t experience feelings the same way I do, not wanting me like that. Cas, I’ve been in love with you for years.” He smiles as he closes his eyes, resting their foreheads together. “The moment you told me you loved me was the best moment in my entire miserable life. The moment you said you wanted me the way I’ve wanted you for so long, I’ve never been happier. But losing you, again, is the worst moment in existence, I don't ever want to lose you again. I’ve spent the two longest months of my life looking for a way to get you back. And now that I’ve finally got you here with me, I need you to know this. I might have been too much of a coward to never voice my feelings for you, but they have always been there.”
And yet, when Dean finally had the chance to say it all, his whole brain went numb. Not a single word forming as he sat there in the dungeon, staring at the other man. He couldn’t tear his eyes off the angel, and yet, not a single word left him.
«Cas, don't be stupid. Of course, I want you to stay here. If you want to of course.»
Carefully taking a step towards Dean, Cas’s knees gives out under him, not able to carry the weight of his body. Dean runs forward and has gathered the angel in his arm before he hit the floor. Gently lowering them the rest of the way to the ground, Dean wraps his arms tighter around Cas, pulling him close to support him.
«I sometimes used to count these,» Cas cups his face as he gently strokes his thumb lightly underneath Dean's eye. «But I never did find out the exact number of freckles on your beautiful face. Still, each time I sat by your bed, I tried counting them.»
“Send us back, awake, together. And I’ll let you go back to sleep.”
Sam and Eileen have already headed for the kitchen to get some food for them. Jack follows Dean and Cas, and after making sure they are both alright, having studied them both inside and out to make sure. When they are happy with Dean and Cas being alright, Jack tells them about the things he has to go take care of. Cas suspects they’ll close of any entry to the void, so that the Shadow has no way of reaching them, no matter what. Cas says nothing, only smiles exhausted as Jack hugs him once more. Jack had been in the bunker for a few days, so there were other things to take care of too, as the new and improved ‘God’ they’re responsible for a lot. But Jack promises they’d be back as soon as they could.
The second day, the loneliness took hold of him and it just got harder and harder to concentrate on the reading. His thoughts went to Cas, and his words. To Cas being alone in the empty, probably not even awake, just… there. He’d been trapped there for almost seven weeks now. 47 days, and 15 hours to be precise. The though sends shivers through him. The thought of Cas not being Cas, of Cas not being alive. Cas, alone. It might be the worst pain Dean had felt in a really, really long time.
“Hey, Dean,” Sam says in a low voice. “I was starting to wonder if any of you were ever going to wake up. You’ve been sleeping for almost 72 hours now...”
It's everything he’s ever wanted. And so much more.
“I think you need to do that again.”
When Cas places a gentle hand against his face, Dean leans into the touch, his eyes fluttering close as Cas leans even closer.
, body. It acted on its own. Surprising Cas each time he felt it, as he keeps forgetting. But it’s still there sometimes. That little spark, his little piece of angel grace. And it was always Dean who made it spark.
“Cas... I’m sorry I didn’t come for you, I tried. I tried. I should’ve followed you. I’m sorry I didn’t answer you that night. I just didn’t know how.”
All he did was lay there. Lay there in the empty darkness. Regret and grief clouding his mind. And it was then that the torture occurred. When the angry Shadow kept him awake in the cruelest way possible.
“What’s that even supposed to mean?”
Dean doesn’t know how long he’s been walking, but it already feels like forever. His watch stopped working. His phone just as dead. So he just keeps walking.
Finally safe.
It might just look like an ordinary living room, but this particular one was the Winchester’s private sanctuary. The other hunters who lived in the bunker sometimes joined them, yes, but they kept mostly to one of the two other living rooms they had renovated at the other end of the bunker. But this one. This one was theirs. With the other hunters roaming the halls of the bunker, they all shared a kitchen, library and the biggest living room was used as some sort of common room for everyone. But some nights, nights like these, the Winchesters would retreat to their own private living room, the one close to the hallway of bedrooms.
but he somehow manages to wrap all of
Cas laughs as he raises his eyes to Dean, a bright smile across his face.
Also, the new hunters introduced in this chapter are original characters, that I made up at 3 am last night. They won't be very important to the story, but I wanted to add some more hunters because this is how I feel the show should have ended.
Their bodies pulled close, treasured as if the other´s are a temple to worship at.
I´ve been obsessed with the idea of Cas not being able to control his grace when kissing Dean so I just had to write a short chapter with it. Thank you so much for reading!!<3
Thank you so much for reading!
“You’re probably right, I’m just worried. I haven’t been able to reach him since yesterday morning.” Sam looks away, putting his phone back in his pocket. Sam and Eileen had been driving all day and although they were only a couple of hours away from home, they decided to stay the night at a cozy inn. «Let´s get some sleep, and then drive back home».
“Absolutely.”
Using their intertwined hands to pull Cas closer, reaching out with his other hand to cup his face, Dean leans towards Cas and silences him by crashing their lips together in a long-awaited kiss. Sometimes the action is easier than the words. The soft feel of his lips. The way their faces fall together perfectly like pieces of a puzzle. It's everything he has ever dreamed of.
And still. It was Dean standing there. Even if the Shadow didn’t get everything right. It was still him.
“You better pray that this is the last time I ever lay eyes on you or that angel again.”
His forehead.
When he stood to get another beer, he found Sam standing in the doorway, staring at him with a sad look. He opened his mouth to say something, but Dean held up his hand to stop him. Dean turned his back to his brother and pulled out another bottle of beer, but when he sat down on the stairs by the door, Sam got himself a bottle too and joined him by the door.
It’s dark, and well past midnight when Sam and Eileen finally arrive in the small remote town by the mountains. She pulls the car into the motel parking lot, filling the comfortable silence of the car with a tired sigh, to which Sam answers with a tired but blissful smile.
«Ehm… what do you mean? We’re good. Why?» It probably wasn’t hard to see that there was something more between Cas and Dean. And after his brother, and Jack had told him how he and Cas acted around each other, he had started paying attention to it himself. And holy hell... how had Cas not seen it on Dean, and how had Dean not seen it on Cas?
It also uses his last words against him. Telling Cas, as Dean, how he can never love him. How Dean could never love someone like him. Never love such an awful creature. That his feelings for Cas are only hatred and anger. Never love. It hurts.
«When... Before the empty took Cas.» Dean started, sitting at the edge of the desk behind him, his hands nervously shaking. «When Bille trapped us, he... Cas had made a deal with the empty to save Jack, and when we were trapped there, he summoned the empty.»
His jaw.
“Cas.”
«I do.» Never taking his eyes off of Dean, Cas´s eyes are filled with tears, which finally escapes when it's his turn to say the words. The ring fits perfectly.
“No, you go. I’ll stay here. Eileen is coming over tomorrow.” Watching Dean and Sam speak, Cas thinks he can see a look of relief on Dean's face as Sam says no to his invitation.
“We were
«Me neither. Come here.» Getting rid of his own shirt, Dean leans back in as Cas cups his face and drags them towards the bed. Gently pushing Dean onto the bed, Cas follows, their lips never leaving each other.
“Please don’t elaborate.”
“Not the freckles either.”
(See the end of the chapter for
«Yeah, come on, before I change my mind.» Dean just chuckles at the look Cas gives him.
that could help him. Spent his days drinking when he gave up after coming up with nothing.
Oh my… Even the way they say that phrase sounds like him. Jack is so much like Cas that one wouldn’t believe anyone claiming him to not being his kid. Although Cas isn’t the one who sired Jack, he is more of a father to Jack than anyone else. Cas is, and always has been, more of a father to Jack than John ever was a father to Dean.
A love that never can and never will die.
«They... they are gone, right?» At his words, Jack looks at Sam, tears already streaming down his old and wrinkled face.
beds, having left on a small bedside lamp to bathe the room in a faint glow. Dean stopped short as he realized the room didn’t have an extra room. Only a small bathroom. No sofa bed either.
«I meant it when I said I wanted to grow old with you, Dean. We’ve known each other for so many years now, and I have loved you for every single one of them. This…» Cas points between them, before he takes a step closer to Dean, tucking the glass ball back underneath Dean's hoodie, hidden from sight, «may be new, for both of us, but my love for you is not. I want to live too, to grow old. To stay
«Jerk.» He continues down the hall, and as Dean is about to follow he hears Sam saying hello to someone else.
It takes another half an hour before they finally fall asleep, their soft kisses and burning touches distracting them in the dark.
«I think maybe, the love between the two of you, is such a huge part of you that you don’t recognize it for what it really is. Not even God could come between you. The God who was writing everything could never control you two. He never managed to control Castiel after he broke free, and through him, you were free too. You freed him, without knowing it, and he freed you, without seeing it. You were, the two of you, you simply were. Everyone else was tied to strings, but the two of you were only tied to each other.»
“Hello, Dean.” he felt, rather than heard the words whispered against his own neck.
They were both their fathers.
Nothing can compare to the love, the joy, the beauty of Dean Winchester. Nothing.
When he rounds the corner, he sees Cas departing from Dean's room, or now it was really their bedroom. Miracle is close by Cas’s feet, always staying close to his new favorite family member. Mir had fallen completely in love with Cas the moment they had met, and sometimes it almost made Dean a little jealous. As Mir sees Dean she runs over excepting to be greeted by a hug, as Dean always gives him. Dressed in one of Dean's slightly oversized hoodies, Cas turns his face down the hallway where he finally spots Dean coming towards him.
«I feel safe when you hold me.»
«Dean?» Cas knows him all too well, in fact, there is no human or creature or being in the whole universe who knows him better than Cas. So of course Cas can read him. «What are you going to do?»
«Sam.» He turns to face her, her eyes just as scared and worried as his. «Cas, where he lost Cas.»
«We should do this again, freckles.»
Slowly, Cas’s eyes becomes clearer as he becomes more aware. Turning his body so that it’s facing Dean, their eyes are leveled and Cas seem to actually see Dean for the first time.
“Of course, angel. I’ll be back in a second.”
«He´ll be fine, Sam. Dean will be fine. And so will Cas. And you, and me. We all will, we just need a moment to figure out how to get there. But we will.»
Slamming open the door, Sam is both relieved by the sight that meets him and scared as hell.
«I´d like that, yeah.» Ah, that smile again.
“Wh...”
Now he was halfway through another shelf. He still haven’t found anything.
A movement in front of him steals his attention away from Dean, and as Cas turns he can see the Shadow standing in front of them. But... it’s slowly dissolving.
«This is my last case, at least for a while. I’m getting my... I’m getting Cas back. And after that... I don’t know what he wants to do, hell I don’t even know if he’ll stay. But if he wants me to, I’ll follow him anywhere. But the hunting? I think I’m done. I wanna live. I wanna love... I wanna start loving my life» Dean almost can’t believe how honest he is. How he pours his heart out as if his feelings were a water escaping from a dam that just broke. «Of course I’ll stay here, this is our home. But I wanna get a job, maybe some time in the future when this place is crawling with hunters, I might get my own place. Maybe I’ll join you on a ghost hunt, a god old fashioned salt-and-burn. But you are the hunter, you are the one who wants to grow this community, and I’ll stay beside you and Eileen for as long as you need me, but the hunting? I’m gonna leave that to you.»
Dean wished he could just stay here forever. In this little hallway, in Cas’s embrace, the world forgotten, but eventually his brother breaks the silence by clearing his throat. Reluctantly turning away from Cas’s lips, he shoots his brother an annoyed look. Raising his hands as if in surrender, Sam takes a step back from the door and heads down the stairs. When Dean turns back to watch Cas, he’s met with glassy eyes, and a small smile across his lips.
“That’s good because I love you so much I’m afraid it’s gonna knock me off my feet.”
He didn’t know how to say the words.
«Hello, Dean.»
Finally safe.
He felt like he had lost everything.
“How was your drive...”
The demon is holding Dean down, his hands closing around his throat, stopping air from reaching his lungs. He can hear Cas screaming his name somewhere to his left in the abandoned warehouse bathed in darkness. Dean can’t see anything, yet his eyes instinctively search for Cas in the dark, but he’s nowhere to be seen.
, Dean. It’s real.
«It’s adorable.» He smiles into the kiss, raising his hands to run it through his beautiful black hair. «It's part of you. It will always be a part of who you are, even if you’d remove it all. But it’s part of you, and…» he gently kisses him again, pulling them even closer.
“Please don’t ask. You don’t wanna know.” At Sam's words, she looks between the two smiling men sitting across the table. She seems to catch up way faster than Sam and shakes her head at them as she smiles.
“Maybe.”
Dean stretches his neck towards Cas, his lips hovering over Cas’s, teasingly. But he never closes the distance between them. Instead, he leans towards Cas’s neck, placing a gentle kiss on the middle of his neck. The one place where Cas gets lost each time Dean kisses him. Dean's lips linger on his scar, making Cas go weak on his knees, a chill going through his whole body. When Dean kissed him there, Cas could feel that little drop of grace left in his body, spark more intensely than usual. One night, when Cas asked him, Dean had whispered in his ear, his fingers gently running over the scar, how kissing him there made him feel like he was kissing his grace, the closest he would come to Cas in his true form, one he could never see. Never see, but feel, when his lips lingered there. Cas had been left speechless for a long moment after his words. And each time his lips found their way to that scar, Cas couldn’t help but feel like he was flying. Levitating. Dissolving.
«Thanks, Sammy.» It's a whisper, but the words reach him anyway, and Sam answers with a bright and loving smile.
Raising his eyes from where they were just studying his hands, his mouth falls slightly open as he meets two blue eyes. Glassy from the tears that are forming.
He’s seen pain, anger, hate, war, evil.
“Cas!”
«Your phone.»
«I love you.»
Dean loved him.
The eyes are wrong.
«No, it doesn’t seem like I am.» Nervously rambling, he looks up at the lamp hanging from the ceiling, now dark and empty. «If you’re bothered by it, I can just remove it all. It’s such a small part that, yes I am fully human, but there's still is a little grace left, like the size of a grain of sand. If you don’t…» Cas doesn’t finish as Dean closes the distance between them to silence him.
“Why do you ask?”
Dean closes his eyes, shutting out the world and retrieving into the shell he has become. He can still hear his voice in times like this. In the quiet. In the dark.
in the small gestures with them. Now that he has seen it once, he can’t help but see it in everything they do. No one lives with such love in the smallest thing as they do. Sam is convinced that even their every breath is a declaration of love to the other man.
Cas is already sound asleep.
Until…
Jack and Sam tried too, tried to find
“Cas.” Dean needs him to believe it’s real, or he don’t know if he’ll be able to get them out of there.
“Morning, boys.” She smiles brightly, her hand gently running through his hair as she sits beside him.
«I know you will. I don’t know how, but I know you will bring him back to you.» Jack doesn’t look up from Miracle, still smiling at the dog as they continue, «you’ve never given up on him before, and you won’t do that this time either. Now that you are free from Chuck, there is nothing stopping you from having him. Having your happiness. And I wish for nothing else, you know, then for my two dads to live a life of free will and free love.»
“It’s called
“I...” Cas turned his head towards Dean, watching him for a moment so long that Sam uncomfortable shifts on the bed as he clears his throat, snapping them out of their haze. “It couldn’t put me to sleep.”
Cas seems to be speechless as Dean leans in for a quick kiss. As he sits back against the passenger seat again, he watches Cas fondly as he starts the car, pulling her towards the road.
Again, thank you so much to everyone who has read this, to everyone whos commented and left kudos! I love you guys!!<3
He couldn’t look Jack in the eyes.
But, sometimes he would wake.
His touches are going to heal him.
The lack of oxygen is slowly weakening Dean, his vision turning cloudy.
“Goodnight, love.”
That’s all he had wanted to do since he got him back. Hold him close. Never letting go. He’d finally said the words that had been eating him up the past months, but it all still felt so new and raw. This thing between them. They had to learn each other all over again, figure out what this was.
A figure.
«No.» Cupping his face, Cas pulls him back into the kiss. «You know I don’t want to sleep alone either. But you have to leave before the other wakes.»
Sams words both calm him and make him even more nervous. «He deserves better. I’m not worth all of that.»
“I’m sorry about that. I wasn’t actually expecting to have to deal with it. I didn’t think you want to save me aft...”
Dean's hand lingers by his face, gently stroking it before he takes some of the food from his plate.
Happiness.
Eileen had been beaming with joy and admiration as she studied every single one of them.
Making sure he’s okay, he sits down beside Cas on the bed in the infirmary. Sam and Jack sits on the opposite bed, facing them, eager to ask Cas questions, but patiently waiting for Dean to make sure nothing is wrong, before daring to break the sparkling silence between the hunter and the angel.
“What do you mean?” Clearly taken aback by the question and sudden change of topic, Sam sits back in his chair studying Cas. “Like romantically?”
«You’ll always be my angel, Cas.»
Dean had been just standing in the middle of the room, frozen, eyes flying over each and every picture that Jack had made. Eyes lingering on the ones of him and Cas, until it finally rested on the one that showed them kissing. It wasn’t until Cas walked over from where he stood beside Sam, that Dean had moved. Cas put his arm around Dean´s waist, gently kissing away the tear that had fallen from Dean's eye. And then Dean had hidden his face in the space between the former angel's neck and shoulder, while Cas rested a hand in Dean's hair, gently stroking it.
His love.
Sam smiles through the tears, his hand gripping Jacks tight. They sit there in silence as the birds in the trees welcome a new day with cheerful tones. A light breeze sweeping through the neighborhood. After a while, an old and gray-haired woman steps out on the porch. Eileen moves close to her husband, resting a loving hand on his shoulder, giving Jack a questioning look when she discovers that her husband's face is wet from tears. Sam lays a hand on top of hers, and Jack smiles a sad smile at her as they nod slowly.
Dean has seen and felt his grace. Loved his grace.
Once Dean had been scolding the angel for watching him sleep, but Dean grew used to Cas peacefully resting beside him as Dean slept. He even wished for it most days. Wished for the feeling of safety he got whenever he woke to feel that presence. He had lost count of how many times Dean had dreamed or imagined a certain angel laying beside him in the bed, on the side of the bed that Dean always left empty, as he slept peacefully. Cas never did though.
. He should tell him.
«Morning, angel.» His voice low and hoarse as his first words of the day escapes his lips. With his free hand, Dean mirrors Cas’s movements with light and soft touches, caressing Cas’s beautiful face. He could stay like this forever.
“I haven’t said anything about it to anyone else. Because, you know I’m not good with feelings and all of that, although I’m trying my best to get better. I just... lately all I’ve wanted to do is tell them and... but whenever I try to tell them I like them, maybe even love them... it just seems like my brain shuts off completely and I never manage to say anything.”
Too caught up in each other, eyes and ears only for the other man, the world around them disappears for Dean and Cas the moment their lips find each other. They don’t hear the faint flutter of quiet wings in the hallway beside them. They don’t see the figure appearing behind them, Jack with their light and messy hair, dressed in a faded red and black plaid shirt, grinning at them with a goofy smile as they kiss each other softly, leaning against the wall.
The world didn’t matter to Dean that night, and it still doesn’t. The world was literally dying in front of them. But that didn’t matter to Dean, because his whole world had already died that night. Dean lost his big win. Lost his best friend. Lost his happiness, a happiness he didn’t even know he could have. He watched his greatest love get taken from him right in front of his eyes, and he could do nothing about it. He had lost his angel.
«I love you.» It´s only a whisper on his breath, and Dean isn’t even sure he actually said them out loud before he locks eyes with Cas, finding his blue eyes shining with tears.
“No, I don’t think I do.” Dean laughs at her fondly before turning all his attention back to the food.
Over his coffee, Dean grins at his brother. Cas has moved to the fridge, taking out the leftovers from last night's dinner that they never showed up to. Sitting down close to Dean they share the plate. A grin is spreading on Cas’s lips too. It’s
It takes a couple of tries before Dean finally gets a reaction. A human-Cas seems to be a heavy sleeper. Cute, too.
“Okay... I take it you and Cas had a good time yesterday?” Sam moves to sit down opposite his brother, and just a second after he sits by the table, Cas walks in, a shy smile on his lips as his eyes meet Deans. He’s wearing one of Dean's black hoodies, his hair also newly showered. They stare at each other for a long moment, just like they always do, making everyone present almost uncomfortable because of the
Cas was gone.
Their nights are always spent together, in each other's arms. Dean has never slept as well as he does when he sleeps in the angel's arms. The safety he feels in Cas´s presence. The love he can feel in his touches. The happiness he knows is clouding his every word.
Dean has to look away, turn away from the way his brother looks at him. The memories of mourning Cas, the memories of Cas leaving him alone. He couldn’t think about that. Didn’t want to.
«Merry Christmas, Dean.»
He was there.
“Cas?! Are you okay?” He can feel himself getting weaker and weaker. Only wanting to lay down and rest. If it hadn’t been for Dean holding him, he would already have fallen to the floor.
Together in every way possible. No force in the universe is able to separate them ever again. Not once their body is given to the other, souls merging together, never able to be apart again.
Dean can’t stop thinking about him. Every moment of every day, he has been thinking about Cas. Thinking about how his touches send sparks throughout his whole body. Thinking about how his body feels pressed against his own. Thinking about the warmth he feels every time he looks at him with those beautiful eyes, smiling that beautiful smile.
The last of the masked creature falls to the ground. Sam smiles at his brother, proud of having won another hunt, saving those boys. Dean is leaning against a beam at the other end of the barn, but he’s not smiling. «Sammy.»
to live. But with Cas, he started to live
Eyes still closed, something warm pressed against his chest, he slowly rose to consciousness. As he opened his eyes, his heart started racing, eyes growing wide as he stared at the back of Cas´s head, his nose buried in his hair. His hand resting conformably around his waist. He stopped breathing as his body froze, carefully trying to remove his hand from Cas, who was gently holding on to it.
“I’ll come back.”
«Yeah, I hope so. After you and I talked about hunting and Eileen moving here, I asked her if she would like to move here, since she’s already here so often, and she was over the moon with joy. And then we started talking about visiting the other young hunters, inviting them to move here. The bunker is way too big for just the fiv… ehm… three of us.» Although he quickly hides the words, Dean´s heart stings as Sam slips up. They were supposed to be five. They were supposed to have Cas here. They were supposed to have Jack here. But in the end, it was just the two brothers and Eileen.
The eyes are wrong.
«You’ve already said that like seven times this morning.»
Without thinking, without waiting for another second, Dean threw himself at the angel. His arms locking around his neck, pulling the bloodied angel close.
wedding, gave us away a long time ago.» Dean's hands find their way underneath Cas´s shirt, gently brushing over the warm naked skin.
At their gentle whispers, Cas reaches out and takes his hand, pulling him with him as he closes the door, heading towards the bed. In each other’s arms, they fall asleep right away to the rhythm of their breaths in the silent night.
Dean was so lost.
Unfortunately, no one really gets what they wish for deep in their hearts. Their silence is broken by quick footsteps in the hallway coming towards them. Cas starts to pull away from the embrace, but Dean only holds him tighter.
«Never thought I’d see the day the greatest hunter, the Dean Winchester, would retire.» Sam gives him a bright smile. «But you deserve all of that, you know that, everyone knows that. You’ve saved the world so many times and it’s time for you to get to live in it. I’m looking forward to seeing you live. To be happy. To love. And I know you’ll get him back, and I know he will follow you anywhere, too.»

Dean´s love.
“How... how long was I gone?” Dean turns to his brother. Pulling the chain over his head again, the glass ball resting against his chest.
“Come on, angel. Let’s go. You look like you need some rest. There’s a motel five minutes from here.”
«Huh, well that’s almost a little funny you know? How you saw it long before
One having lived only one life, the other many.
But this silence.
The third time he saw it the moment Dean got close enough. The eyes. They were the wrong shade of green. And they did not shift in the same way the real Dean´s eyes did.
This is going to break him.
“Seriously?” He whispers back.
«You seem happy, happier.»
«You know, Dean. We could just let him sleep in here with us.» Cas smiles down at the dog on his lap.
As he opens his eyes, Cas places both of his hands firmly on Dean's chest. And pushes him away. Except, this time, Dean holds firmly on to Cas and they both stumble to the ground. Or what would be a ground, if there were such things in the Empty.
«Yeah.» His lips pull up in half a smile, half a pained grimace.
«Only a breath, a heartbeat, apart. Not even a whole minute.»
One day Eileen takes Cas with her into town for some errands. Leaving him and Sam together in a storage room deep in the bunker. Dean knew the bunker had lots of storage rooms, but he didn’t know that so many held so many books. He thought the library and the main storage room held all their books, but there were books
“The back...”
And how to get out.
Since Cas came home, they had spent as much time as possible together. Just being with each other. Figuring out the two of them. Yes, the simple way to put it was that Cas loved Dean, and Dean loved Cas. But, to Cas, it felt so much bigger than that. No one knew Cas better than Dean, and they had been family for so many years. But his was something else. Something Cas had hidden for so long. Something Dean had hidden for so long. And now that they didn’t have to hide anything ever again, they were learning and getting to know each other in another way than before.
Dean hadn’t realized why, before now, the angel had stopped him.
, Jack, he was certain that the Empty could ever come for him. Since the one thing that would make Cas happy, the one thing that would make Cas that happy was Dean. Dean loving him.
A kiss to make up for a decade of silence.
«You know, there’s this saying that freckles are really kisses from angels…» Dean has to chuckle as he watches Cas blush at his words. His blue eyes shining brightly.
«You sure?»
«Nice hoodie.» Dean winks at Cas, a smile appeared on his lips too.
He almost felt a little sad when they returned to the bunker the next day, and as he went to bed that night the longing for Cas to lay beside him was almost unbearable. He found himself really looking forward to their next long hunting trip as his nights alone in his bedroom always left him waking several times during the night.
“Jody... do you remember that thing I told you about?” A screeching sound came from inside as Dean opened or closed one of the steel cabinets. “Yeah. That.”
This is going to break him.
«Hello, Dean. How was your ride?» Eileen asks smiling up at her boyfriend's big brother.
Somehow, all their clothes quickly find new resting places somewhere in the car. Lips moving against each other, never leaving the other for longer than a short moment. Hands trailing all over, leaving hot streams of fire wherever they touch. Skin to skin they set fire to themselves, moving against each other as one. Moving together as if this was what they were made to do. This was their purpose.
But... there’s also seem to be a thread of fear present. So he takes hold of it, gathers it in his hands, and follows it deeper into the light. As he touches the fear, follows the thread, he can feel it slowly turning from fear to love.
The angel’s smile matches his for the rest of the day, and each time when their eyes meet again, although it’s not really possible, their smiles widen even more.
His mind screaming out the words he hadn’t said. Screaming them out in prayers.
Dean heads in the other direction, taking the stairs leading to the garage.
«I love you, Cas.»
«It's just Sam. Nothing important.» He turned off his phone, putting it back in his pocket. Turning back to finish his half-eaten burger.
At that, the Shadow disappears and Cas collapses into a restless sleep.
He never got to tell Cas that he had always been his. He had loved Cas for such a long time now, that he can’t remember the feeling of not loving him. For so long he had believed that his feelings were unrequited. Dean had believed for so long that angels couldn't feel the same way humans did, he didn’t think they were capable of such emotion. Oh, how stupid he was. So much time wasted. He could have had Cas all this time, had he only had the courage to tell the angel how he felt.
At that Dean looks up again, seeing that even Jack´s eyes are glassy at the thought of
The three single beds are lined up against the wall, the light from the bathroom lights up the room so that Dean can see his brother sleeping peacefully in the bed in the middle. Two empty single beds on each side. His eyes move to the bathroom and a wicked smile spreads across his face.
The Empty.
The bunker library is dark, only a small table lamp lights up the table closest to the hallway, which is also dark. Heading down the stairs Eileen turns on the lights, showcasing the mess of the library. Sam just stares.
“I... I don’t really know how to say this and I suck at talking about feelings and stuff, but I kinda wanna tell you. Sooner rather than later.”
to drive?» Cas asks doubtfully as he moves to the driver´s seat, pulling his hoodie over his head.
Cas dying before Dean could tell him that he loved him back.
«I love you, Dean»
Dean had always believed his life would only consist of hunting, and being a big brother. But lately, he had started to imagine what his life could be like if he started living it, instead of just watching it. The thought had been slowly creeping up on his for the past year, and the more he imagined a peaceful life, a life where he could just simply be. Simply live. He realized he wanted that more than anything.
A real, and loving family.
And so he listens, as the love of his life does not breathe again.
Walking up to the room, Dean is wondering if his brother has finally given up, or what he’s done this time. Opening the door, Cas laughs as he turns back to Dean, opening the door wider so he can step past him. As Cas closes the door behind him, Dean looks at his brother with almost angry eyes.
Day after day, Dean wakes in the angel's arms.
«You know Dean, I will always be here, and you don’t have to say anything until you feel ready to talk to me. And if you don’t want to say anything at all, that’s okay too. I know you and Cas have each other, and that’s all I need to know. That you are happy. So take your time. I know how it is, me and Eileen, we took our time too. So, find each other, learn each other. I’m here, always.»
And so he watches, as the love of his life slowly draws a last breath.
And the stars.
And his hands squeeze tight.
The times he was awake was worse than the time he spent asleep. He remembers everything from the last time he was stuck here, but this time seemed to be even worse. The Shadow was angry now. Angrier than before. The Shadow claimed that Cas was the reason he couldn’t go back to sleep. But Cas has no idea how it could be his fault.
The Shadow. The Shadow had been appearing as Dean for Cas.
Dean.
A tear betrays him as it falls from Cas´s closed eyes. For just a moment longer, he wants to pretend it's actually Dean. But it's not.
Pushing against him, Dean moves them both from where they stand, leading Cas against the rearmost chevy door. Dancing around each other, Cas opens the door, before pushing them both inside, laying Dean underneath him in the back seat. His eyes seem to glow in the dark, the blue of his irises lit up by sparks of electricity coming from inside him. Unbuttoning each other's jackets, the November chill is long forgotten, their flannel jackets are thrown over the seat, landing somewhere out of sight as they move together.
A light in the dark.
“Hello, Cas.”
One hand still in his soft and dark hair, the other cups his angelic face. Cas's own hands find their way to Dean's waist, holding him close. His eyes full of love and emotion studies the blue eyes currently staring at Dean's lips. The blue eyes raise to meet his green, and with a deadly quiet, they hold each other's gaze for a long moment. Dean could spend the rest of his life like this. Holding the angel, kissing him freely as often as he wants, needs. Staring at him, the angel with eyes like the sky.
He curses his brother for always making sure the room only has two beds,
Sometimes, some days, he tried to get past his armor that he hid his feelings behind, and it did feel good to show his feelings in small gestures. But not at home. He still felt weird about showing his feelings in front of his people. He didn’t like being vulnerable. And he was very, very protective over Cas. That might be why he found it easier to show his emotions in front of strangers.
Or at least, it had been.

Cas moves closer, his free hand taking Dean's face, a thumb gently stroking the space under his eyes.
«I could leave if you want me to.» Dean teases as he pushes Cas towards the bed, his arms holding him tight against his own body.
Sam left Dean and Cas at the bar the moment he’d finished his meal. For someone who enjoyed staying up late, he’d been going to bed pretty early these last couple of nights…
Cas took a step back, defying every instinct in his body that told him to move
Low music is filling the car with a peaceful silence between Cas and Dean as they head down the road. They haven’t talked much, so Cas has mostly been lost in his own thoughts. Only when they stop to get gas and something to eat, does Cas return to reality, but his thoughts still half distract him.
“Dean. Is it really you?” Resting his back against Dean's body, Cas half sits on the ground.
«Cas...» looking up at the starry night sky, Dean is speechless. So they just stand there, for a long moment, looking at the stars. Cas sits against the car as he leans against Dean's side, head on his shoulder. Dean turns slightly towards him to place his arm around Cas’s shoulder, holding him close. At that moment it’s just the two of them. The two of them all alone in the world, the only ones left. «It’s beautiful, Cas.»
The day they left he had been comfortable in the silence. He’d read more books these past four weeks than he ever had before in his life. He had gone through every book in the six bookshelves in the far corner of the library. And he hadn’t found anything.
«What is it, Dean?» Cas says as he meets his eyes.
“If this is a dream, please wake me up before something happens that I won’t be able to let go of.”
“They aren’t.” The confused looks he got in return had made him laugh even more.
It’s what he, they, had always wanted.
you were his happiness. The same way he is yours.»
«I know. I know, Dean.» He smiles sadly at his big brother. He knows too well the pain of loosing someone you love. Dean just isn’t sure about what kind of love Sam thinks he has lost. With a whisper his brother adds under his breath, «I’ve always known.»
(See the end of the chapter for
As the world stops, everyone else in the room disappears and he and Cas are the only ones left in the universe. He’s not nervous anymore. He’s not scared of anything anymore. The ceremony goes by too fast, but also too slow. Dean can’t take his eyes of Cas, whose eyes never leave Dean´s either.
“Yeah. Dean and Cas... Well, let’s just say that the both of them are so emotionally constipated and blind that they have been pining after each other for like twelve years.”
Dean had loved the angel for so long he couldn’t remember when or how it happened. But he’d always loved him from afar. Loved him in silence. And that had always been enough for him. He knew he could never have him, and he had learned to be okay with that. Just the fact that he was allowed to love him at all, keep him close, be his family. It was enough for Dean.
And then everything goes dark again.
At the sound of his name, Cas fully opens his eyes as he sits up. Confused and wild, the blue eyes searches the void around them, before they finally lands on him. Locking their gazes, Deans face breaks into a bright smile, as tears start streaming down his face.
Down by the water, two men are standing close together in a sweet embrace. The slightly taller one leans back a little, bringing their lips together before they move to sit down on the grass. Still close together. The black-haired one throws his arm around the other's shoulder. Resting their heads together, they watch as the sun rises above the forest painting the sky a beautiful red and orange.
How Dean had ever found those words hard to say, he didn’t understand. So much time spent alone, lonely with his feelings, because he could not say those words. They had been the hardest words Dean had ever known, and now, he could not stop saying them.
His touches are going to kill him.
«Morning, angel.» Dean smiles into the kiss, before resting his head on the pillow close to Cas’s face.
«Hello, Dean.» Jack smiles as they meet his eyes, before sitting down on the steps to hug Miracle, «I heard your prayer. I’m sorry I haven’t been able to come to visit. But I wanted to. I’ve missed you too.»
