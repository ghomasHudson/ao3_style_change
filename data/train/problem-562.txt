John bristled, settling back into his seat with a little huff of, ‘Bloody hell. You two never let anything be simple, do you?’ He measured his breathing for a moment, and Sherlock wondered if John was sufficiently annoyed by the conversation to drop it now and take it up with Mycroft at a later date. They had about ten volumes apiece of artwork and pathological narcissism to read.
), he felt a stinging reminder of John’s tongue on his neck. Certainly the immediate interaction had been… gratifying. For both of them, it seemed too, even beyond the mere physiological reactions of male tissues and hormones to general stimuli.
None of the people, settings, or mind-bogglingly farcical dialogue was familiar, but he had not been paying as much attention to the films they’d been watching as to John’s expressive face while Sherlock hurled occasional insults at the production value and believability. (They’d both been on their phones, anyway, so surely it wasn’t quite the sacrosanct ritual along the lines of a funeral or marriage that barred his (logical) interruptions.)
Then at last — and Sherlock’s breathing went mottled again — John leaned over and embraced him, held him with such
A bell tolled somewhere in the distance — seven o’clock — and, rather than wait for Sherlock to push him away, he drew slowly apart. Sherlock cringed.
His tone suggested that he found this client’s preference highly dubious to the point of eccentricity, but — for hierarchical reasons, most likely — incontestable.
‘It’s all well and clever having a Mind Palace, but you’ve only fifteen seconds, maximum, of full consciousness left to use it. So, come on – what’s going to kill you first?’
), the nervous bloke wiggled awkwardly from behind the counter to squint at a surprisingly short businessman in braces and a too-tight pinstripe suit. Eventually, with a sigh of relief, another hotel employee descended and led them both in the direction of… whatever they needed.
It was reflexive. That was it. He hadn’t actually forgotten — he was still in that lingering good mood, the one that had prevented him from wanting to punch the soup git, from — what had happened this morning. What he’d been fantasising about only minutes ago. What he was hoping to get up to when he got home.
‘I knowed it,’ she reasons, arm dropping again and seeming immediately unfazed by the experience. ‘I made it better with my mind.’
Miserable grey eyes looked up at him from Ryder’s greasy fringe (the man had apparently neither slept nor washed since the affair had begun only the soggy day previous). ‘C-Cathy – Catherine Cusack,’ he stammered.
When finally John interrupted the tainted silence of the room, he tried to draw on every comforting experience and every ounce of faith in Sherlock and Mycroft, the whole bloody Met, his own Sig if necessary, to get through to her. ‘Suze. We are going to find this
‘Let me see that,’ he frowns. Putting to one side her blue Paddington coat and rolling up the sleeve of her knit jumper, he examines the proffered section of forearm. It looks much as it ever does: tiny, still downy-skinned, but unblemished. ‘Hmm. Looks fine to me.’
Though he refused to take another step back, his eventual sigh felt like a retreat. ‘I have work in the morning.’
As Sherlock stopped and peered around the corner of Swandam Street, John took a second to catch his breath. His back hit the bricks, his shoulder brushing the dark wool of the detective’s coat, while he actively tried to stop himself thinking about where his feet were currently planted.
‘Sorry, I’m so sorry! Really, Freddie, get down! I’m so sorry about this!’ (She hadn’t sounded overly repentant, nor had she exhibited signs of preparing a stern lecture for… Freddie… when they arrived home, now that she had regained his lead.)
He blustered out some reply, the things he told himself when he lay awake wondering what was wrong with him. When he’d got like this. If he was better off with his gun and no one else.
‘What?!’ He couldn’t help it, even though it was too loud for the hour and for the sleep of certain people nearby — positively lost it and kept going, wiping his eyes and just imagining Molly having to explain to the assistants and the doctors and the family what she’d found, asking whether it was relevant, whether anyone had noticed it before.
‘Sh-Sherlock, I don’t think – I –’ he stammered, aware that his dusky pink cock was jutting insistently between them and possibly leaking against Sherlock’s silken pyjama bottoms which were instantly his favourite and least favourite garment on the entire planet. ‘You, it’s not –
— and so it sat, on the mantle, with their other assorted objects. For a week, every time John had gone to sit in his chair, his eyes had traced a particular constellation from the rock, to grate (even when empty, which it usually was), to the headphoned bison, to Sherlock’s chair (to Sherlock). Even when, in the months since, cases had proved disappointing or John's surgery work had upset him (or the singular difficulty of combining their wardrobes into what had formerly been Sherlock's room), all of which brought them both to the edges of their tempers, their rows were less vicious, less fraught, and their (often wordless) apologies somehow knitted from a skein of trust brought home from Scotland.
is the trill/riff/leitmotif Sherlock -- and therefore Capt. Flint -- plays. To appreciate the bird-brained (oh man am I sorry), though, you have to see
‘Good,’ John muttered admiringly down at him, while somewhere either miles or centimetres away John’s toes were rubbing the wrong way up the hairs above Sherlock’s ankle.
, and her mud-caked leggings, and of course her stuffed Peppa, she babbles about pigs and goats and unicorns and tigers, and at some point as John is momentarily out of the room to get her a glass of water, she falls asleep. He sets the cup on the end table near her head, then carefully pulls aside the short caps of her sleeves and double-checks, but it’s as he thought. Nothing.
‘Exactly, dear,’ she chimed, already moved on to collecting the tea towels for laundering. Few people appreciated Sherlock’s own tendency to move on from inane conversation as Mrs Hudson (who, paradoxically, was herself a keen and consummate fellow practitioner of tuning people out). Before she left, he ducked upstairs and returned promptly to hand her the offending garments: ever observant (his methods found at least one natural student), she tutted about stains whilst her laughter-creased eyes gave him a warm, knowing look. She kissed him on the cheek and patted his arm on her way out.
‘Okay, well. That must be fine then.’ His throat felt sore, the same knife-edged panic scuttling around inside him, never entirely quelled, rising. ‘In that case, I guess I just have to be glad the universe bends to the will of the great Sherlock Holmes.’
John snuck a glance at Sherlock in his peripheral vision, half-seeing him pace in thought. Flint was also watching him curiously from her perch (apparently now settled, despite the fact that John had
As he worked, he tried not to think about what was going to happen if Harry kept down this same road, a road she was apparently inhabiting at that very moment, hence her ignoring his many calls telling her she was running out of time to make her peace with the old man who’d made both their lives a mess since the beginning. He didn’t expect her to ring back, and wasn’t disappointed.
‘I simply mean,’ Sherlock goaded, drawing himself up to his proper height because if John couldn’t forgive this, couldn’t move past it, then he had damn well better tell Sherlock now, in his brusque, plain words, and let Sherlock begin to sort out a life without him, ‘that you were apparently quite able to keep yourself
Echoing down the corridor as he walked away, John heard, ‘If we’re going to steal Gruener’s scrapbook or files or whatever they are, we ought to do so as soon as possible. And we need a way to be assured that we truly have enough irrefutable evidence for Mycroft to counterbalance the repercussions for all those involved.’
The fact that a man curled in half on a settee, at half past eleven in the day, still in his dressing gown, could so orchestrate my actions provoked a flicker of rancour in me, matched only by my rising sense of self-righteousness. I had indeed been reading Morris’s long-since delivered address, having stumbled upon an old issue of the thing while tidying my side of bookshelf in our front room. Nor had I ever been in the habit of going to such idiotic subterfuges as to replace one cover for another. In the past, whenever I had wanted to avoid Holmes knowing — or, since that often was a hopeless aim, to avoid at least his jibing — I simply waited until he was out, or until I was alone in my rooms. But it had been years since I hidden anything from him at all; the teasing was taken in stride; and my appetite for reading, certainly of a companionable afternoon, tended now towards the philosophical, rather than the melodramatic.
, Sergeant,’ he snarled, eyes not on the jewel dazzling in her hand, but rather on the exiting figure of John, who had choked out a harsh, impatient laugh that made Sherlock’s hair stand metaphorically on end, before he marched his retreat in the direction of the bathroom.
He ascended the thick concrete stairs, John taking his time after him as acrid fumes wafted up from the closed basement below.
’If it’ll help you take your meds,’ John replied flatly, in a lowered voice. Sherlock usually didn’t need it to take pills (a fact John refused to consider too closely until the case was over), but he hadn’t exactly been getting the doctor-recommended fluid intake today. ‘All the evening and dinner-time ones: actually. We have to keep on the schedule, like we discussed. And, as a matter of fact, you might as well go while the shower’s free —’
out of reach. He could string this out for ages, feeling the hum of winding frustration mounting in Sherlock, almost sweeter than the admittedly excellent symphony still reeling in his ears. Teasing, tipping his head to one side and inhaling only to pull back as the hint of his lips ghosted across Sherlock’s, then changing his feet and tilting his nose the other way, maddening and intoxicating and highly effective — Sherlock, he knew fervently, was an impatient sod, particularly when the air between them was charged and John was essentially holding him on the brink without having to do more than caress his wrist back and forth with a single finger.
The down-turn of finality at the end of his sentence seemed to get across: she flickered a fleeting look of disappointment, then nodded, deflating a bit. ‘Ah well, no worries. I don’t normally…’ She nodded again, just once, then took the pen back. ‘Anyway — have a good one.’
‘ howled Suze, tears streaming down her face – a face he saw reflected in a glass display case as he crept ever closer to the fray. He just needed to get to Gruener before she made her move, ruining not just her own future freedom but everything they had risked, all the information they needed, from coming tonight.
‘They’ll be triangulated through the car itself,’ Sherlock nodded, ‘and a… satellite. You, on the other hand, will not be able to hear me.’ He wasn’t entirely certain he grasped or, for that matter, cared about the finer technological details of the earpieces: they were, his midnight communiqués from his brother had assured him, fit for this purpose. That was all that was relevant at present.
Bit… atmospheric? He liked it, sort of, but not enough to withstand the inevitable piss getting taken out of him when a certain drama queen decided to wax critical about increasing the stupidity of one’s readers by style alone…
‘Oh, ta, that’s lovely of you,’ he thanked the woman, when she opened up her purse, as new people ducked around her grumbling, and produced one of those stain-remover pens.
. ‘Fuck,’ he repeated, his nails biting into his own palms through the sheets he was now gripping to keep from touching himself.
Meanwhile Sir James was blinking in apparent amazement that Sherlock was not a complete neophyte. ‘My word, Mr. Holmes. Your brother did say you were the sharp sort but… this is extraordinary. Quite extraordinary. But, Gruener has never entered a criminal courtroom?’
blog the year before, in an attempt to attract any clients whatsoever. But that was work, not… celebrity-mongering!)
, would they? Not with the way you fall into step behind him, spend every bloody moment with him — honestly, it’s kind of amazing how much time you spend with him. Even after everything he put you through… So when’d she leave, then? Got tired just after you moved back in with the mad scientist, I’ll bet.’
‘Oh—’ He turned round and grabbed his phone off the worktop, with fingers still damp from the shower — if he hurried he might just be on time to get to the surgery — and saw that he had one unread text (Harry, with the details of their ill-advised lunch tomorrow) and two emails: one from the publisher, Billie Wilder, who (he skimmed) was ‘
Sherlock had explained, in his somehow simultaneously blunt and roundabout way, the basics of the plan, and John had mentioned (because, he felt, it was irresponsible not to) the probable toll this would have on her — and them all, to some extent — down the line.
important a function,’ she corrected cheerily, picking daintily at her food. ‘I was… I had not felt entirely myself yesterday, and it seemed rather the greater faux pas to present several eminent peers with the evidence of my feeling.’ Her gold earrings fluttered as she shook her head, sending pale-yellow reflections along her toffee-brown skin. ‘And certainly Lord Morcar stayed on to, as it were, keep up the side.’
; Sherlock was at least 65% certain), and Sherlock had come back before things were irreversible. Before his return, however, he could only imagine… A blonde, objectively attractive woman’s body curling around John’s in their sleep, giggling with him at their clinic, lacing her pale feminine hands in his blunter, darker ones, keeping him in danger even when (especially when) he didn’t know it. All the while Sherlock himself had been in hotel rooms and mountain forests and snowy alleys thinking of
‘Is it entirely necessary at the moment?’ Sherlock stressed primly, getting to his feet. By the sound of it, their hired car had just pulled up downstairs.
Months afterward, in an asphalt car parked, seedy motel south of Miami, shivering with the come-down of a cheap but sufficiently potent batch of cocaine, Sherlock reflected on the monk’s logic. Everything was transience. This high, like all the highs that had come before — that feeling of being nineteen, unplagued by the demands of his body, assured with every glance that people saw him, knew the brilliance of his mind and admired it, wanted to be in his company because he was interesting and witty and fun and capable and liberated from the confines of behaving by the standards so briskly touted by the college dons — the soaring, sated glow slid steadily downwards as it wore off… Everything wore off. He’d never loved anyone for more than ten minutes. A perfect piece of music thrilled in the air until the only thing tethering it to reality was wishful remembrance. John had moved out of Baker Street. Moriarty, even! Moriarty was dead and yet his puny, deadly empire was eroding whatever qualities in Sherlock that people like Molly Hooper and Lestrade and John considered valuable beyond his intellect… Everything was transience, even — especially! — sentiment, so the cocaine didn’t matter, the cigarettes didn’t matter, Redbeard didn't matter, his sickeningly idyllic childhood didn't matter, the cases he would never solve didn’t matter, the body in the warehouse was already decomposing into mere matter that didn’t, and Sherlock shivered, chuckling at his own joke, thinking bitterly of painted sand.
A moment later, John’s face had broken into an expression of mingled guilt and fear, as he had released him, apologising, ‘Shit, I – Sherlock, I’m – I’m…’
Sherlock rose. (Like cats watching a laser pointer, both of them: heads following him up but neither of them readying to move from their seats.) ‘I’m sorry, Sir James, but I cannot take your case.’ (He wasn’t especially sorry.)
The germ of the problem lay in the obscurity of John’s motivation(s) for emailing Mary Morstan — an alias (although John was unaware of this) — in the first place. The subject-line of the email allowed for any number of possibilities: was he seeking her out simply to maintain his self-image as the ‘good bloke’ who remained friends with his exes? (Unlikely: he was not friends with any of his other former partners, excepting Sarah, a friendship borne of necessity (working together) not of any especial fondness (that Sherlock could tell); and Major Sholto (though the details of that relationship were scarce).) Even more unlikely, however, was the notion that John had attempted to get in touch with ‘AGRA’ to… attain ‘closure’: did people do that? reach out only to say goodbye? Nevertheless it was a possibility.
For an instant, Mycroft’s critical gaze passed over both John and himself, then met his eye with an almost imperceptible flicker of warning. (His brother, unlike John,
A threat? Agreement? Resignation? Wonderment? A challenge? (The false note by one of the trumpets in Act 3 —)
‘I get it. I do. She told me it was pretty. And you pulled her out of the way and you told her off, which honestly Sherlock? That’s what you should do. Kids are a constant danger to themselves, that’s our job.’
,’ he added, as Sherlock’s flippers slid under his own normal ones, ‘feet are freezing, you wanker.’
Thankfully, John laughed, and Sherlock loved him so distractedly he shut his eyes and was glad there wasn’t an afterlife, since they would not have gone to the same place, and in any event there was nothing better than John’s touch and his forgiveness (however temporary) and his wish to be with him for no reason other than wanting it.
actually antique. We could get a dog. We’d have a bit of a shout when I’m fed up with doing all the dishes again or when one of us gets shot at because we’re both shite at this sort of thing. We could move, both of us or all of us, whoever we are, to the country when you decide it’s time to write your full memoirs, to fix whatever second-rate romantic thrillers I’ve peddled to the masses. You could keep bees or cross-breed poisonous plants and take me up to the opera whenever the sound of the ocean and the seedy underbelly of Cornwall or the Outer Hebrides or wherever isn’t dangerous enough to keep you from going spare. We would be there to take care of each other if we get sick, or when we're too old to get up the stairs or even to the toilet. And we would continue to get into trouble and worry and hate it and resent it and fight about it, and we would wake up in the same bed, and tell anyone who suggested we find a “healthier relationship” to go fuck themselves.’
The soft warm liquid electric reverberation — John’s lips and hard palate tasted of peat, fire, malt. Like smoked cherries and stream water. The strangeness — two skulls clacking together; two fleshy, porous cases around rattling skeletons that sweated and stank and rippled and peeled back, curdled meat, when applied with fire or water or air or metal instruments, to reveal only skeletons that couldn’t hold themselves together once the tendons were gone — Sherlock shoved past it,
it to them voluntarily (as such people were ridiculously wont to do). Or, best of all, to distract him while the other of them (viz., John) scoured the house, clothes, display cabinets, desk, and any
John nodded, feeling gently her at lymph nodes, and prompting her to open her mouth so he could look: yes, red, inflamed. Ill. ‘Maybe you should reschedule, just for one day – no reason to get yourself stuck in a downpour. Lemsip and an early night? Then maybe –’
Brows drawn, Sherlock stood up, looming as he oh-so-enjoyed doing. ‘I was always intending to come back.’
he was meant to be off-duty) and sat with John in the receiving area outside the operating theatres. He’d handed John a coffee — the coffee he’d been craving at the lunch with Harry that he hadn’t eaten — and hadn’t spoken again, just squeezed John’s shoulder once, until hours and hours later they told John he ‘could go into to sit with him’. Greg breathed, ‘
But Harry didn’t need to know any of that, least of all about the row he and Sherlock had had about Mary (or the rest of it) only last night. ‘And she didn’t leave, we just… went separate our ways, is all.’ He cleared his throat and straightened his serviette. ‘It hadn’t been working out for a while.’
(Probably one of his therapists had spun it out at some point: that trust was a leap of faith, that love was essentially giving someone else the most vulnerable part of yourself, and trusting that they wouldn’t shatter it into a thousand pieces. Just now, it felt as though Sherlock didn’t even recognise the simple, ugly truth — that he was holding all the cards.)
John chuckled. Christ, yeah, he did — fuck, it was going to be a long day, now complete with a white-tie disguise bait-and-switch, apparently.
About an hour later he was buzzing the high-tech video intercom for Violet’s flat, having already shown his ID to the front desk man (a very friendly, fatherly-looking bloke who seemed as though he hadn’t had anyone here actually speak to him like a human being in about ten years) and been directed to 6C.
. This boded well both for the night’s rest and tomorrow’s post-case 221b weather forecast. He rinsed the knife, flicked off the light, and mounted the stairs, resisting the urge to whistle.
Had Sherlock been standing beside him, he would have had to stifle his smile. Here in the shadows, a foot at a time, Sherlock clung to the margins of the room moving away from him instead of towards; listened to Suze’s fragmented, unimpeded mutterings (possibly high, prepared for anything – unpromising) as he neared his destination, the dais where Gruener (based on Suze’s outstretch gun’s indication) was standing –
His nostrils flared as he attempted to gather enough air into his stinging lungs without the humiliation of gasping like a drowned rat in his own living room. Too much –
Sherlock wanted to shout, as though he were watching John stride into a funeral pyre meant for himself. What kind of life was that?
The nurse at the desk swished a hand in acknowledgement, continuing her consult on the phone, as he walked through the receiving area of patients (doctor’s badge carefully hidden in his coat, lest anyone want to jump the queue) and out onto the high street.
Sherlock is instead curled up on his side in the semi-dark bedroom, on John’s side, away from the door.
she ever decides she wants to be closer to her sister – boring, you’ll say, but, you’ll do it for sentiment, as usual. We could borrow your arsehole of a brother’s credit cards and take ourselves on holiday to Italy or Australia or someplace where you’d rush down before dawn to inspect all the best deck chairs and at night you’d run after some smuggler and we’d eat and shag and sleep with the window open and dance to slow music, because you love to dance. You could teach me. We’d ignore your brother’s calls asking how the hell we spent a hundred quid on an old-fashioned magnifying glass that
Sherlock wished, for an instant, that Sgt. Challa would simply leave the matter (quite literally) in his hands, so that he could go back to finding a way to solve the challenge of connecting the two cases while reserving enough brainspace to catalogue every cell of John Watson’s skin as it come into contact with his.
Settling into the mattress, he muttered, as he caught a whiff of the scent of Sherlock’s skin only centimetres away, ‘Was right about the birthmark, though.’
the morphine (and opiates generally) and onto a long-term regimen of non-narcotic pain relievers as soon as it was safe to do so — John went to look out the window. Sure enough, several storeys down on the pavement, a gaggle of reporters and camerapeople were chatting and smoking merrily, lenses and booms fixed in his general direction.
During Sherlock’s time away, John had in fact only dated — and for one absolutely insane week considered proposing to — Mary. It had begun as a whirlwind (how John, not-so-subconsciously, best liked to do things). She’d chatted him up in January, just after a shift as he went to lock up his things, and on pure impulse — defying the prospect of yet another night with surely too much whisky for a man alone on his sofa — he’d flirted back. They’d gone to the pub and, still flushed with the spirit of a fresh year of opportunities and turning new leaves, gotten spectacularly, painfully drunk, made it back to hers for what under any other circumstances would have been a quick, rough, and terrible shag, without even folding down her embroidered, button-ornamented duvet. In the morning he’d been hungover and embarrassed, unsure which of those was a more shameful way to wake up (and two days before the anniversary of Sherlock’s death, to boot). But then at work the day after, she’d smiled brightly rather than ignoring him or nodding briskly, and asked if he was interested in getting together that weekend. He’d been floored. He’d considered how he’d spent this time last year:
heard a canine being shushed into the flat earlier that day, but that she had been too preoccupied with ‘baking’ (aka Mr Rosenthal, her new gentleman-friend) to find out more.
options) were rapidly narrowing. John, hand still outstretched, palm up in placation, no doubt – indeed the narrowing of his eyes proved – was having the same thought, if along slightly different lines considering he knew of one fewer person that was currently present. But John, reflexes notwithstanding, could hardly prevent Suze from harming Gruener while simultaneously fending off Mary
‘Oh, take yourself off, then, and enjoy your “piece of reasoning”!’ He shuffled up, drawing himself completely away from any bodily contact with me, and huddling in a space I fancy even smaller than that which he had previously occupied on the cushion, stubbornly pretending to resume reading his own article.
. With men, though, it was all about skin, and muscle — about pushing and feeling the other person push back; the otherwise illicit feeling of one long bare arm or leg wrapped around you, yours around him, unimpeded by fabric or fear; sweat across undulating ripples of smooth, taut muscle over bone, all escalating pressure and tension; how they defied your sense of inside/outside, soft/hard, pain/pleasure, hot/cold,
‘What do you need from her?’ John asked, picking up that thread of conversation. ‘Bradstreet might have told her not to talk to us. And she’ll be difficult to get a hold of anyway,’ he added, for practicality’s sake. Sherlock tended to forget the details like opening hours and entrance fees and rush-hour traffic.
John took the young man’s large pink hand, which shook his entire muppet-like arm with ridiculous ease. Baker’s entire appearance was more of a Wallace and Gromit figure than an Oxford prof, but, John supposed, the two were not mutually exclusive.
‘See?’ Mr Ramani said angrily, watching the proceedings. ‘There is nothing there. The police already took their pictures and left.’
John shouted inwardly. His eyes took in Sherlock’s face, his hands, his rising and falling and rising chest.
For a moment he loses his words. Again, for a sharp and staggering flash, his mind seizes with the call Sherlock would have had to make—
so John paid the driver, distractedly assuming that he probably looked like exactly what he was: a bloke off to get lucky after a posh night out (more specifically, a man to shag the living daylights out of the man he jumped after).
After a while, their joints were seizing up, the rocks holding no warmth whatever but indeed seeping it from them greedily. Why anyone lived in the North after the Ice Age was, frankly, a mystery. They came down the mountain silently, the same, but somehow restored — old and new, a philosophical conundrum of bodies, minds, time…

’No,’ John had replied, a bit surprised that the idea had occurred to Sherlock when it had very much gone from his own mind. ‘No, we definitely are not.’
’We need you for this operation to be successful, Molly. More than anything, more than any information we might be able to pack into John’s or, realistically, your head in the next twenty-four hours’ (John rolled his eyes) ‘will be far less important than the
Sherlock had blurted out in the hospital, and then he’d looked at John as though he was furious, desperately clinging to him, with a face morphing into thunder when John had said it back.
‘ He was shouting now, to plough over John’s words which were shaking and livid, hurled across the room. And Sherlock, as John would’ve bet, saw a fight and hurtled into it, no holds barred. ‘I
John whipped around this time without remembering to guard his expression. Sherlock’s eyes, woozy rather than sharp, met his in an immediate conversation.
‘No, no, up you get, you daft scarecrow,’ he insisted, shifting to sit up and poking at Sherlock’s sides. ‘I’m not having you wake me up with your stomach grumbling in an hour just because you’re too lazy to eat now.’
He had, under the influence of the last round of narcotics, suggested to John his dream-inspired consideration that Gruener in fact carried some sort of digestible, unappetising though it sounded.
[I have many and various *strong* feelings about Molly's role in series 4 vs. in series 3. Even had I not reacted so strongly (and contradictorily), though, I think she's an absolutely brilliant character and thus... prepare to revel in her glory in the next chapter(s).]
When the case was over, perhaps he could find something appropriate to play for John. He — they both, if the truth were out — struggled to get anywhere in the mire of

‘We’ll get this right, y’know,’ John eventually reassured him, on the belief, if nothing else, that saying it out loud might help them get there faster.
John resisted the urge to kick him. ‘And so, what's the plan? Because rushing in when you have no idea where he keeps his records or, for that matter,
Molly shrugged nervously, as though in self-defence, so John gave an eye roll in Sherlock’s direction, then went back to trying, for the fourth time, to figure out the difference between engraving and etching.
‘Dr. Watson? Suze Winter,’ volunteered the (very, very petite, in very loud outfit) woman on their sofa, rising immediately (to, at most, five foot tall) and extending a hand, bracelets jangling.
Another long moment (in which Sherlock tried fiercely not to fidget), John nodded once more. ‘Well. That’s not exactly the explanation I was hoping for, but,’ he looked up at Sherlock still poised in the very centre of the room, ‘I guess it means I can delete her from my contacts list.’
Sherlock looked her over. This uncomfortably astute observation bore none of the obvious traces (posture, facial expression, breathing, proximity of nearest eavesdropper) of malice. ‘No,’ he agreed at last. No, he hadn’t been.

No one, in his entire life, had ever fundamentally, unwaveringly believed in him the way Sherlock did. The way Sherlock
Waking in a cold sweat at approximately half-past three in the morning (absurd to refer to such an hour as ‘morning’: it was unequivocally, if disorientatingly, night), he’d abandoned his allocated bed roll and gone in search of fresh air (though not hard to find here) and (more difficult) something besides the terrors behind his eyelids to look at.
‘Why don’t you—oh, sodding hell,’ he mutters, as Sherlock disappears into the bathroom and answers only, a second later, with the sound of the taps springing into gear.
was, though he would never admit it, the real reason he called Baker Street home, had worked for just under 800 days to get back to it: because John thought he could do anything.
He put the bow through its paces, springing indiscriminately from Shostakovich to Paganini to Chopin without stopping to acknowledge rests, line-breaks, or key changes.
Based on his movements (or lack thereof), John was standing one storey above, much as Sherlock was doing now (i.e., still), though presumably not in precisely a spot tested to be invisible from any exterior angle even in daylight. A moment later, John’s floorboard whined, his door creaked, and then John’s footsteps were trampling down the stairs, across the kitchen (past Sherlock’s room, past his open door) and into the bathroom. A quick echoing yelp: ah, John’s eyes – well, all human eyes, for that matter – took roughly ten to fifteen minutes to adjust from darkness to illumination, based on the completeness of either environment. A guttural belch from the pipes downstairs signalled two seconds before the water sprayed the tile basin of the shower; another seventeen seconds before John (presumably stripped bare) stepped in.
… My sister, she – help me, god, please!’ He buried his face in his hands again and sobbed, shuddering and loud. The pitiful sound grated on Sherlock’s skin, crawling along his upper spine and lower ribs and forehead.
. Worked that out, then. He wiggled his toes, hoping Sherlock would be right, that they could both drop into a deep, dreamless sleep for at least a solid, indulgent eight hours – they’d switched off their phones – uninterrupted. Wake up together.
Scooping up milk and sloshing it over her cereal bits, Molly nodded. ’But hopefully they at least let you read when you liked?’
‘And yet you were not so “confused” as to fail to wreck the hotel room and frame John Horner for a crime you committed.’
Sherlock was scowling, studying him, but John didn’t want to be read for clues. He couldn’t even begin to have this row that forced him to doubt himself, to doubt what he knew to be fact in Sherlock. This was a frightening emotional reality, probably, for the maestro of high, mighty, calculating reason. But John didn’t feel up to convincing Sherlock how much they… they cared about each other, wanted each other; how different this was to all the other times with every other person he’d ever been with — especially not when his insides were already churning at how fucking quickly things had gone from heated to — cool, in the worst possible way.
led to the infamous pieces of legistlation to which the even more infamous Labouchere Amendment was added -- this, aka 'the blackmailer's charter', was to become the legal grounds of 'gross indecency' on which Oscar Wilde was convicted in 1895. And thus the 'great slamming shut of the closet door' (to which Watson, maaaaaaaaaybe is referring in the honest-to-god ACD canon story 'The Adventures of the Three Students' (pub. 1904), when he
‘Oh, not really,’ said Violet indifferently. ‘My father always kept a place in town, though I’m sure you know that. I said I needed a place to have friends round when everyone comes up, and he thought this would suit. But it was my fiancé who surprised me by completely redecorating it: he has excellent taste.’ She sipped her tea, awaiting his disapproval.
Several moments went by, and it was not until Sherlock had evidently felt the ebb of smarting discomfort that John dared squeezed his hand questioningly. Sherlock loosened his grip slightly and allowed his thumb to stroke the arch of John’s palm.
He contemplated the chicken option for a moment longer, then set it down and met Harry’s critical stare evenly. Her grey-blue eyes dared him to lie. ‘I wouldn’t know,’ he replied honestly, feeling a tiny twist of guilt in his stomach. ‘We… split up.’
Staring ahead as he walked, he saw a school group assemble on the grass as they listened in wrapt attention to a tall gangly man in a navy jumper, gesticulating energetically with his clipboard. Two boys at the back, though, were visibly not listening. One, taller, chubbier, was smirking and directing with a composer’s sweeping grandeur his short, fair, curly-haired friend, who was bounding in great loops around him, his own arms flapping as he raced and spun, clearly (in the spirit of child’s play the world over) trying evade as many raindrops as possible.
‘I’m really not bothered when those kinds of people come knocking at my door, or convinced just because they offer to pay to get things sorted their way. But I know a bad man when I see one, Violet — a dangerous man. And when the cleverest person I know thinks someone is bad news, I try to listen. So… just keep that in mind, yeah?’
the bird hobbling in the street... So was that merely a coincidence? Was it the Alpha Pet Club itself that was the key, a thieves’ front for passing goods – but again, they would hardly have sold Flint to an outsider if the entire object was transport of items; and in any event, Flint had been hand-reared, and cared for as well as taught a variety of polyglot phrases – no, the shop was not the key either…
‘You had sex with me only yesterday,’ Sherlock reasoned, feigning objectivity. (He did have standards to maintain, even if they were both entirely aware it was a front.)
She loosed another cruel snicker, one that again made their neighbour eye them gloweringly, but he was too furious to let this slide as a tiny sibling spat, no matter how public it got.
They’d stayed folded on the dresser, sandwiched between another of John’s shirts and a grey pair of Sherlock’s pants.
‘Hmm,’ is all Sherlock rumblingly retorts, so John expects Rosie will be refusing to eat her fish fingers by next week.
, of all the damned work he’s put in to raising this little human and getting her to eat greens and sleep through the night and not talk too much about blood and dead people around the families they meet in the park. (His given up trying to get Sherlock to learn all three.) But the thought is really more than he can wrap his head around, and he emphatically doesn’t want to. He sets it aside as best he can.
‘You’re here because I asked Shinwell to send me anyone with information that they had not shared with the police about Baron Heinrich Gruener.’
at this noise, at the unbelievable hypocrisy of what he was hearing, of what she was laying at his door, now of all fucking times – ‘but, second, yeah, I’m with Sherlock, I’m not announcing myself as leader for the Gay Pride Parade.’
,’ Sherlock ordered, forcing John to clamber over him giddily and spread Sherlock’s limbs beneath his (stretched, exposed) in an excruciatingly careful, languid punishment. Sherlock, in turn, rolled his hips and made sure that John felt very, very sorry for putting his clothes back on before going to bed and for
As he moved the car into park, his eyes flicked up automatically to consider John and Molly in the rear-view mirror. What was something of a surprise, however, was to find John’s eyes instantly lock with his in their reflections.
‘Anything else?’ John’s hands were still holding his, thumb brushing over the site where the IV entered his body, and the odd comforting/uncomfortable sensation was distracting enough from the rising tide of adrenalin that he felt lurking in the wings of his consciousness.
‘Christ,’ Christopher muttered on a laugh, watching John slide onto his back. ‘You’re — that was fucking amazing.’
The fact that John, who had always considered (misguidedly) his duty to ‘family’ to be among his most fundamental responsibilities, would accept, even with a jesting tone, the suggestion that he
– explosion, resounding, breaking glass, a shout – anger and light and sounds of Molly shrieking quietly and almost certainly ducking down, another body folding and sinking to the floor with a groan (a man’s voice) – Sherlock’s viscera froze in terror – Molly’s jagged breaths as loud in Sherlock’s feed as John’s grunted, ‘
John shut off the tap, dried his hands. ‘You were outside, according to the plan, apparently prepared to
During his months beyond the pale, he had longed, viscerally, for the idiotic muddle of the little unimportant gestures that, he discovered once deprived, had somehow become just as essential to him as to the other billion fools the world over. He had sworn, on his last cigarette while nursing four broken ribs in Jakarta, that if he ever found himself blissfully, undeservedly lucky enough to stand in 221b again, he would commit himself, mind and body, to patient study and application of such small kindnesses, useless though they were scientifically.
As John had hoped, Christopher melted at this and made quick, messy work of getting them both up the stairs, losing their clothes along the way.
. ‘I don’t have to follow their rules! You said it – it’s all just details! Lady Morcar has her stone back, Horner will be released, Nora Oakshott will
– careful!’ – but of course John knew what to do, grabbed Ryder before his knees hit the floor and managed to lift the apparently invertebrate man entirely undignifiedly into Sherlock’s chair. The rattle and
It was true and infuriatingly false — he hadn’t touch anything since his half-finished buttery toast this morning, the remembrance of which made him feel distinctly sick.
‘Yes, John, you know the type: blonde hair and kevlar body suit and a silencer even you would envy.’
John waited for the end to that thought. When none was forthcoming, he allowed himself to breathe a little easier. ‘Our invite get lost in the post?’
It was all true, plainly written in her every movement and unconscious gesture, but John was positive — almost as positive as Sherlock would be — that she hadn’t yet actually told them what had happened to her. Yet in the back of his mind reverberated the words Sherlock had confided in him last night.
fact, but he could tell himself that Mrs Hudson probably had tidied before they’d come home) ‘and John or I will be perfectly prepared to sleep on the sofa, as needed.’
‘Mmm,’ Sherlock responded. John supposed he shouldn’t be too surprised not to get a snarky reply, as he was currently kissing Sherlock slowly, deeply, holding nearly all his weight up against the top of the stairs outside the kitchen. At the back of his mind, he was curious. Did Sherlock deliberately plant himself in positions that almost invariably led to him being plastered against the wall? — Was it was because of their difference in heights, or Sherlock’s almost-overcome anxiety about the scars on his back, or (most hopefully) did he just liked the feeling of John holding him, crowding him, close and hot and sharp, against whatever vertical surface presented itself?
,’ Sherlock had said, and John didn’t want to be that man, wanted to be good and strong and honest and faithful and… well, yes, brave. But he hadn’t told Sherlock about the woman at lunch, despite being furious with Sherlock for lying to him. Was that all he was, then — doomed by his genetics to be an addict, doomed by his rebellion from his family to fail forever at anything like a stable relationship?
When Sherlock had entered the room, Mycroft had met their guest with a handshake, but now Sir James’s hands were tucked, with (his pockets and rear coat flaps attested) a lifetime’s habit of placing them promptly out of the way. He stood to attention, but his posture was relaxed, even elegant. More to the point, the fact that Mycroft, who usually radiated coolness, had stood board-straight when Damery entered and then had immediately excused himself and
‘You two were seeing each other, weren’t you? Last spring or so?’ Beth made a sympathetic frown. ‘I know…’ She considered him for a moment, then went on, ‘Well, it’s none of my business, is it? But I did think you seemed like a nice couple. “Looked well together”, my mum says. And blondes have more fun — as you know too, I bet!’
‘If it helps,’ Sherlock offered, inclining his head slightly to one of the less hearing-damaged of Billy’s saucer-sized ears as nonchalantly as possible, ‘my present client is attempting to bring
around the place, we’re all bored out of our skulls with all these new “impact initiatives” and extra training and pay cuts… it’s a nightmare sometimes, I can tell you. Not even sure I’m interested in staying.’
‘Right,’ Suze said, evidently still unsure. ‘Well.. Obviously you’re… busy. But d’you fancy a sandwich? Pasty? Saw a Greggs just up the road.’
‘Wouldn’t have put you down for mountain climbing,’ John admitted, sipping from the thermos of tea gratefully.
Footsteps again – Sherlock peeked over the edge of a refracted-glass shelf – Suze’s whole self was now glowing like the Byzantine icons in the recessed corridor, but with the modern amendment of a gun rather than a lily or lamb outstretched, while her other, gloved hand grasped something (too tight a grip to be a button for a bomb? dear god, he hoped it wasn’t an actual bomb, but only the very limited object his deductions concluded it would be), arm as it had been when she’d been at Baker Street, wrapped self-protectively across her chest.

He heard more than saw Sherlock come to sit close beside him on the settee, a rustle of fabric as he pulled up the cloth at his knees. Sherlock had never understood personal space.
He felt ridiculous still, somehow childish, in the face of such obscenity, of taking someone else's genitalia into his clumsy-eager mouth, a caveman chasing an evolutionary dead-end, relishing the primal cues of arousal and blood and sour pubic hair so close to his nostrils, along his tongue. He tried not picture himself as though from the outside, ever-failing (he failed more often than he succeeded: such was John’s magic that anyone believed otherwise); tried to focus on John’s marquee-lit display of
quality glass, made smaller with low-end brick, plastered over, giving it the appearance of advanced grubbiness that most of the houses around the corner worked perpetually to stave off. (The fittings were new, as was the overly-innocuous CCTV camera, which rather gave it away if you were not a moron.)
Even obscured by the dusky orange-blue light pouring in from Baker Street, the mere silhouette of him calmed John. At last the dizzy, wrong-footed feeling that had been sitting on him all day ebbed into nothing. He inhaled deeply.
She placed her napkin over her plate and smiled, which was, it seemed, their cue to go. Sherlock was already getting to his feet, and, with a nod of thanks, made his way directly for the lift. A little annoyed, John quickly shook Lady Morcar’s hand (her eyes were full of enjoyment at Sherlock’s rather tactless getaway) and said goodbye.
.’ John thought of the gods of destiny and luck and Sherlock’s artichoke-coloured worn-soft rumpled dirty sheets, and didn’t know if he thanked them or damned them all to hell.
Sherlock’s real laugh, though, was deep and a tiny bit stupid, wrinkling his face as his chest rumbled with genuine mirth. When he laughed, Sherlock sounded drunk, more so than when he was actually past his alcohol tolerance. And somehow his laugh itself was intoxicating. For the full silent half-hour or so after Mycroft’s hurried exit, John had attempted to sift through newspaper notices, while largely just staring at Sherlock, whose laughter echoed in his ears. And Sherlock’s prolonged inattentiveness had the reverse impact of holding John’s attention hostage. Even amidst her honking, singing, and one-sided conversing, Flint had seemed just as interested, nipping at Sherlock’s hair and collar (grating once along his bruise and making Sherlock hiss) until he gave in and scratched her chin. (John had to remind himself, absurdly, not to be jealous of a
He found himself staring at the refrigerator contents, hand on the open door, with little memory of having brought himself there.
’ he shouted, unable to swallow it; felt his shoulders tense impossibly tighter, hands already balled into fists.
thought about that for a brief second, smirking at the idea of a royal commission and wondering if Sherlock had been hoping instead for John to come home and find him wrapped in a sheet, to fuck him on the carpet, like he’d just about ended up doing the other day.
‘And that is precisely the brilliance of the point: it is a common experience,’ I added. ‘And then to conclude his speech about — well, you did not read the initial paragraph’ (he scowled) ‘but there was a great deal about spacing between letters and margins and letter design and that sort of thing: he is a designer and craftsman, as you will recall. But to conclude a piece which had begun with such workmanlike precision with such soaring notions about beautifying the very clay and pap of the world around us, of making even the most mundane volume of pages and words into something almost magical in its ability to arrest and consume the attention, to consume the senses from within with enjoyment, appreciation — ‘
'Men love to tell me that I don't want to be "one of those girls". Then they congratulate me that in fact "I'm not like other girls" — because I am not. I am not some rash, naive schoolgirl. And I neither wish nor require some man who's just come in off the street to patronise me and tell me he knows better than I do how to run my life.'
For several minutes, Sherlock stood, taking in all the data – shoe pile disturbed, medical journals rigorously re-stacked, light switched on and back off (drops of misty rain on the plastic), cooler air in the flat (John left his window upstairs open throughout most of the summer) – to ground himself in the reality. John wasn’t here, but he had been. His things were still here. He was planning – eventually – to return. In which case, Sherlock would wait.
2. That last quotation which the Earl of Morcar told Lady Ayenat is SHAMEFULLY lifted from George Eliot's
, Sherlock had said; with a shiver, John imagined simply cornering Sherlock against the living room door and kissing him into a withering mess who confessed to everything, including how wonderful it had been and how great it would be to give a second go…
When he resurfaced, John had risen to his feet (almost imperceptible on such a good mattress, unlike on John’s appallingly cheap one) and — the rustle of fabric-against-fabric, -against-skin, -against-metal and -leather — undressing. Not for the first time in his career, he wished he couldn’t picture the events he’d heard described in such visceral detail; his stomach clenched, and he exhaled through his nose. More than anything, he dreaded his own reaction if John should attempt to touch him.
He exhaled slowly, and tried to make his body stop shaking. Slowly, as he sat there, rationalising the panic away with the dewy breeze of the rain chilling his back, he remembered how to breathe.
Once he’d finished, he saved it to his ‘Drafts’ folder to look over later, not sure what else he needed, or if it sounded stiff or absurd. He felt like his focus was elsewhere.
, Sherlock. I work long hours so that I have time to myself, to — to do what I like. Obviously I want to help you — I’m
Ducking his head, a grimace of something like regret spilled into the lines around John’s eyes, and Sherlock couldn’t think of anything past the blinding rush in his ears of John whispering his name with such fervour as they lay beside one another putting off the rush of the morning, newly remade in the impresses of each other’s bodies, awkward and malodorous and yet drawn to each other across continents and years and all statistical probability, so he could’t help himself enunciating the grounding fact of his life’s experience thus far:
) over the kitchen door. (There would be a minute scrape near the top panel where the hook was now digging into the paint.)
Sherlock apparently was thinking more clearly than John. ‘The second bedroom is upstairs — only room on that floor. Loo is down here but I trust you can find that in the night, if you need it?’
– all at once John needed to be closer to him, pressing his mouth into Sherlock’s mouth as his left hand confidently unfastened Sherlock’s buckle and the first clasp of his trousers as he crowded him back with his entire body to stretch across the length of the sofa. Sherlock licked up into John’s mouth with humming approval and shifted his knees to pin them around John’s sides, lifting his hips forward. John’s breath caught; his jeans would very soon be either completely superfluous or ruined. He didn’t much care.
John’s gaze had regained its natural self-possessed, unshakeable demeanour, meaning he looked at Sherlock now like it was his birthday and Sherlock was the candle he was intent on blowing out.
and jumps of systole and diastole until they were burned into his retinas, the harsh light of the screen blaring plenty loud in the near-darkness. (Hospital rooms were never completely dark, of course. He was long since resigned to that.) He hadn’t wanted to look at his face, so he’d watched the monitor, only interrupted when various people came to check his vitals, all on schedule (it was a good hospital), and he was forced to stand up and move away and release his hand. Once they were gone, John smartened the terrible knit blanket (it was a good hospital, it wasn’t the Savoy) and stowed himself in the mass-produced faded blue leather-and-metal chair by the bed. If he spoke to anyone, he couldn’t remember having done it later.
talking about it. He appreciated the sleep and, more importantly, the space to let himself adjust to… whatever new version of them (and Sherlock, and himself) had come into being.
on his staff, all his dependents. But that means he’s sure to have ruffled some feathers, even among those who’ve elected to stay in his employ. Plus he didn’t kill all three of those people himself.’
(Who had guarded him, when he was away? And before that? Who protected him while he slept, defenceless and angular and snoring?)
The reverberation of John’s voice suggested he was facing the door — still sitting up, looking away —
. In any event, you also got an impressive array of magazines and newspapers, including several that you usually deem not only morally suspect but also wildly overpriced. Your salary nor your hours have increased at the clinic, and we did not make any substantial commission from the nonexistent million-pound reward from Mr Evans. Feeling generous, then, which is to say feeling extravagant beyond just general good spirits. Though you are a gambler by nature, you evidently felt it justified based on the expectation of soon-to-be attained earnings. There are also the various old files, the recent case documents and your notes, and the
who let such feelings get muddled up in the work –, Horner’s obvious innocence (though exactly where the carbuncle had got to, he was still working out), and John’s flirting with a botoxed divorcée in his peripheral vision… It had not been an auspicious first day of their relationship.
(Had the world any justice, Mycroft would not be familiar with the workings of miniaturised photographic novelty items, and Sherlock would have the very muted pleasure of explaining it to him.)
For a plan, then. John had been adamant about not simply charging in — a frustrating double-standard, since most of the time this was just the sort of breaking-and-entering that got John’s blood up and whose ends always (nearly) justified the means — but, if he was going to be insistent, Sherlock could work around it. Two alternatives seemed most promising:
John would almost certainly be describing him as looking like an old turtle in a waistcoat. (He wouldn’t be wrong.)
After a moment, John stepped around him. ‘Right, then.’ He kept his tone in check, but his strained patience was almost palpable. (Thai: even with their contacts/favours, it was hardly the cheapest meal for a non-occasional dinner. And out of the way from the flat, hence his delayed return time.) ‘Well, I’m starved, so don’t mind me if I don’t pretend to be above human food.’ He moved around the kitchen with his usual ease, shoulders more tense than a single minute before, almost certainly rethinking his remarks about voluntary celibacy, but thoroughly determined not to show his disappointment as he gathered a plate — no, two plates,
John leaned forward enough to plant a steadying, heavy kiss on Sherlock’s shoulderblade, a hair’s breadth away from his birthmark at the base of his neck, ignoring the scars, then — as he knelt and pushed wider Sherlock’s splayed legs and petted the silk-prickly hairs on the back of thigh with his dry hand — reminded himself that it was his job to take the lead here, including in all matters of tone.
Only once John was down to a shabby shirt (procured from the stack of clean laundry on the dresser) and pants did he resume his seat.
, even the unknown Henry Baker and the falsely accused John Horner, whose spectre seemed to loom at the corners of Sherlock’s consciousness repeating, ‘Innocent, innocent,
‘Oh, god,’ John groaned, messaging his temples: that was the last thing he needed, Sherlock getting sucked into a vortex of internet trolls. ‘Maybe later, love, when we’re not busy planning to corner a murderer.’
‘Neither of them was Gruener, of that I’m certain,’ Sherlock added, because it had been excruciatingly obvious even in his inhibited state that every time the Austrian’s name had come up for the first day or so after Sherlock regained consciousness that John believed him personally, unreservedly responsible for the assault. Part of him had been braced to learn in the morning's newspaper that Gruener had been mysteriously shot through an open window in the middle of the night, to scent the powder burns on John's finger tips when he helped prop up Sherlock's pillow.
But Harry was on a roll now: ‘Brilliant of you to wait, though, ‘til mum and dad had died, I guess,’ she sneered, her face drawn into a look he’d seen on her before, both sober and drunk, always vicious. ‘How horrible for them to have one queer in the family, but
’ — and it clicked, while suddenly, if distantly, it occurred to him that John was going to be livid —
‘Yes, yes, obviously you would have to be so entirely sensible to stimulation as to make daily life impossible, if that were going to get your blood up! Move along, please.’
‘Fuck, Sherlock, oh fuck,’ he chanted mindlessly, his hands coming to rest on the outsides of Sherlock’s arms and gripping tightly. ‘
’Sherlock,’ says John’s voice, hardy and full of pride, calling now from above the tracks, above the waterfall, out of sight. ‘My love, you’re going to have to climb.’
Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘Three-and-a-half pints and a third of a basket of chips makes you talk nonsense.’
Standing now, Sherlock shook his head minutely, words careful as though he thought John was going to break, or shout. ‘John, you are addicted to a certain… lifestyle.’
. This is not some bloody autopsy, I’m not dragging this all out into the open just so you can dissect it and avoid what we were actually trying to get at.’
He doubled back the direction he had just come, sliding along the obscured edge of the hall back towards the main entrance where – by the sounds of it – a
John reached down, looked at the screen, and silenced the call before tucking the phone quietly in his pocket and immediately busying himself with the television remote.
As far as Sherlock was concerned, they had all narrowly avoided being shot, burned, stabbed (again) or assaulted, and he wished to deal with these facts (and the ensuing adrenaline crash, post-traumatic episodes, and/or whatever lurking, banked, fury was still smouldering in the corners of John’s eyes) in the privacy of their own home. (If it still was theirs.
— he had sat, shaking beside the toilet in his flat, biting his hand so hard to keep back the sobs he had to wear a brace the next day to cover it up — even then he couldn’t picture how shockingly, glaringly
‘C’mere.’ (John was reduced to contractions and what he could steal back of his own oxygen. A fact about which Sherlock did not felt even remotely contrite.)
In the intervening weeks, John’s gaze had lingered on every dog they passed on the street; his browsing history showed him searching for and bookmarking (‘dog-earring,’ John might have written for his blog) pages on how to keep a dog ‘In The City?’ and the proper food and the best breeds. Once, Sherlock had come home from offering his opinion on a corpse to Molly, and instantly deduced that an actual dog had been in the flat — hair on the stairs; odour still wafting. John had acted as though he had no idea what Sherlock was talking about, and asking Mrs Hudson meant Sherlock was treated to a long and scone-filled conversation in which she speculated that she
Crossing the road dredged up a stale, almost forgotten memory of the previous contender for the title of ‘best he’d ever had’. With it came the prickle of long-dulled shame, grief, and — because even amidst such an unfortunate cocktail of emotions, some part of him still relished it — a tiny swoop of pleasure in his gut.
The remaining warmth in John’s chest vanished like smoke on a breeze. Mrs. Hudson was probably wondering what all the rowing was about lately. John hoped to heaven she was out at her book club tonight.
‘As if there weren’t already an overwhelming majority of incentives on the criminal side,’ he remarked.
taste across Sherlock’s palate, even through this remaining layer, was nearly eclipsed by the wonder of John’s skin, surprising for being at all surprising once exposed: he was beautiful, solid and heavy— almost immovable and yet taunting at Sherlock to try —, hot beyond belief, delectable. Sherlock tongued at the jut of him through the fabric and dug his fingers sharply behind John’s knees, memorising everything all over again.)
‘I’m sorry,’ John told him, which was so ludicrously irrelevant that Sherlock couldn’t help but wince.
, with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. ‘“Famous Doctor Deaths, and How You Can Too”: required right before you start seeing patients as a junior doctor for the first time.’
Sherlock’s mind zinged like the scrape of metal pins as the perfectly fitted facts slotted themselves into place: two years, Ayenat Braithwaite had said; Catherine Cusack, glamorous but attainable, flirtatious but clearly (to the objective observer) indifferent to his attentions; savings wasted on attempts at a private online business (failed), new wardrobe, and demonstrative gifts, all entirely unnoticed; delusional heist fantasy born of too many late night action film screenings, and a poor schoolboy’s idolatry of Robin Hood; and, judging from Sherlock’s last visit, a sense that, when his sister inevitably died within the next six months, he would have no family, no skills, and nothing left to lose.
And Christopher managed, gone though he was, to give him a run for his money, held John there on the threshold of his climax for an
John allowed himself to roll his eyes at the ceiling. He’d waited more than three weeks since he’d found the dark bottle on his dressed one morning, stopping him in his brisk routine. It wasn’t that the cologne didn’t smell good. It smelt fantastic, of course —firewood, like the smoke from a crisp, cold forest camping fire, combined with the familiar whiff of Earl Grey — posh as hell and, damn the man, in keeping with what John (if
Then, after another moment of flickering images: ‘D’you want to see them?’ John’s light tone betrayed his excitement — ah:
She walked — evidently balancing on the balls of her feet, maybe to avoid unwanted noise — and made the most subdued bowl of Weetabix he’d ever witnessed being made in his life.
Except after a moment John impulsively dragged Sherlock’s fingers to his lips and firmly, reverently, kissed his left knuckles. Then his right. Hugging them with his whole hand around Sherlock’s, gentle around the intravenous lines.
‘Mr Ramani, we may not be the police, but our investigation is taking us to Bow Street, where I’m sure Inspector Bradstreet would be keen to hear about you weekend in Dundee with your employer. So let me advise you again, take us upstairs.’
His breathing had settled during the brain-dulling tedium of ‘paperwork’, but he marched homeward attempting to pretend to himself that he was not at all nervous that John had left. Hedging his bets, he diverted three streets and picked up their dry cleaning and some batteries (John’s old electric razor was nearly dead) before resuming his route. His step felt uneven the whole way.
‘Got anything to drink?’ he called, ignoring the state of his erection and tottering back to the bedroom.
Somewhere between John’s lungs he still felt the bruise of that, of the continuous ache of more than two years without him. Which, he supposed, answered his question.
. ‘She smiled because she was a little iffy about it, and then she stabbed you anyway. Terrific. More psychopaths.’
John peered to where Sherlock’s head was resting, nose along his shoulder. ‘What, oranges? I didn’t get any — they weren’t on the list.’
‘We sent two lads round there only an hour later!’ Hopkins wailed pleadingly. ‘There wasn’t anything. We got crime scene photos, of course, and the CCTV round the corner, but SOCO found no trace of a knife —’
‘So I gather,’ oozed the great and pointless oaf behind him, a knowing pitch to his voice that grated in Sherlock’s veins exactly unlike a needle. No reason to turn around, not to see his bespoke periphrastic self-important
John was sitting in his chair, unconsciously at work in his mission to wear the fabric beneath his thumbs away at a rate disproportionate to the rest of the upholstery. He was also regarding Sherlock watchfully.
He had halfway given in to the reflex to lean forward and kiss Sherlock before he realized, with a pang, that Molly could see them and stopped himself.
in the corner of her mouth, despite (because of?) the sudden increase in people-to-gun ratio in the room. A woman who had been in John’s life (in his bed), who had come so close to standing beside him in another church to make such different pronouncements (promises indeed) – every resemblance to that dangerous figure, and none.
Then he rolled his hips, carefully, and Sherlock breathed John’s name, as though to prove he was still paying attention.
Just as he was about to switch subjects, however, John looked at him with narrowed eyes. ‘What aren’t you telling me?’
: 'It was in the year ‘95 that a combination of events, into which I need not enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some weeks in one of our great University towns…'). FACTS!
The man was an idiot, that was also true. Sherlock had bought a second parrot simply because he thought Henry Baker couldn’t afford a
He opened his eyes: Challa was still talking, somehow, but John was watching him closely with a slightly altered expression.
‘You make me happy by existing,’ John returned, hands clinging tight to the nape of Sherlock’s neck, where the beautiful rough callus from his violin was already a little fainter than just a month ago. ‘Even when I’m also furious, you make me happier every day than I have ever been anywhere else –
Bradstreet led them to the wide main staircase and down toward the holding cells. As he descended the first step, Sherlock stopped, leaned back, and pushed a finger between his heel and the leather of his lace-ups. John was there in an instant, there to balance Sherlock or prevent him tripping down the stairs. ‘What’s wrong with your shoe?’
‘Ovid isn’t for us, John, he is for Henry Baker.’ Sherlock set the new cage down on the partner’s desk, and unveiled the second parrot of the day to its temporary residence. He let drop the training treats and other various items he had impulsively bought in order to make the sale and get back to the flat with some shred of his sanity.
Now that he was home, it was vital to recommence the plan. Being stabbed, it transpired, was extraordinarily inconvenient. Among its other inconveniences, the incident had set them back

‘Precisely,’ Sherlock agreed, disappointment replaced with conspiratorial amusement. (John never got tired of that tone.) ‘Not to mention the fact that he is an article collector. What better place to house a collection of nonconsensual pornographic material than in a gallery devoted to pornography? Added to which, he has, based on these testimonies, forced his conquests to

These kisses were languid, long deliberate slides of lips that sent a cascade of heat through John’s body. When eventually Sherlock’s hand found the back of his neck again, he couldn’t help his tongue darting out to press a heavy line along Sherlock’s bottom lip in appreciation. Sherlock groaned.
‘I…’ Challa seemed to consider John’s insinuation of absurdity. ‘You’re right. I suppose I saw how you handled everything with the St Clair case yesterday and for some reason I just…’ (Sherlock felt John’s tension lessen minutely at this flattery; little did Challa appreciate how John warmed considerably to any expression of the value of their work.) She frowned and stroked the parrot’s head softly. ‘I love animals,’ she concluded, by way of explanation.
in my life determined to lie to me? It wasn’t enough to face Moriarty, for you to throw yourself off a building? Had to go and pull another trick?’
‘A Stanhope,’ Sherlock pronounced solemnly. Mycroft extended his palm and took the items, eyes swivelling now to his brother.
He shoved these illogical fears aside. Effect of the medication, no doubt: lowered inhibitions, compromised affective responses.
, in the most sentimental way, to have been present for something so unabashedly beautiful. ‘We, er… we don’t usually, as it happens,’ John replied eventually, aiming for diplomatic.
‘John,’ Sherlock grunted, his own hand groping John’s backside. John shivered, and planted his lips back on Sherlock’s as his hand began to stroke clumsily, restlessly, along Sherlock’s prick. Before long Sherlock was leaking onto his palm, slicking each stroke while he whined into John’s ear.
‘Yeah, sorry, just…’ An unwelcome idea was burrowing into his brain, shifting his guilt over the last three mad minutes and instead prodding memories in what had seemed to be separate areas until they were forming a mildly infuriating conclusion. He fished out his wallet and grabbed the takeaway bag with his food.
The Baron (challenging even Mycroft’s standards for bespoke tailoring) came round the desk and, with a quirked head, considered him. His somewhat wiry, muddy brown (the worn-through earth tone of the unrefurbished fabric on the Bakerloo line; unhelpful association) hair included a high widow’s peak that seemed to draw up and back his skull away from his long, bearded chin (well groomed, of course). (Alec had had a similar air of magnetic prowess; but Gruener carried none of Alec’s penchant for the boyish pleasure of behaving badly… and roping others into joining him.)
‘I’m not working today. You just solved a case. I’ve got a book deal. And, it’s Friday. We both deserve a day off.’
Instead, with a Cheshire grin, John offered him the bottle, as though they were teenagers drunk on their first trip to the off-license. But that way madness lay. Instead, John reminded him, hands returning to tiptoe across Christopher’s hypersensitive skin, ‘You haven’t had to beg yet.’
St Clair seemed to prune with fear, shrivelling into himself and looking, with his wet hair, raw cheek, bleeding lip, and nauseating vagrant attire, every inch as despicable as Sherlock found him.
, he thought to himself. It was obviously possible that she’d changed emails since they’d dated in the spring, but — well, he wished he’d managed to remember her sooner. Send her some kind of closure email at the very least. He sincerely hoped nothing bad had happened, though, if he was honest with himself, what would he really have done? They’d cared about each other, sure, got on better than pretty much any of his other girlfriends, suited each other with an appreciation of dark humour and an agreement not to dig too deep into each other’s pasts just for some tit-for-tat ‘get to know you’ game. Even Paris, in retrospect, hadn’t been
Also, amusingly, there was a comic going around tumblr this week, featuring (of all things!) an African Grey parrot as Sherlock and John's pet:
, the whole reason anyone bothered to come to them rather than the idiot, clock-on-clock-off, workday hours morons at the Yard or, worse, the Kevlar-happy fools at the Security Services. Gruener’s wedding was only four days away. More to the point, if he was honest with himself, he was hardly back up to fully functional (though nowhere near as fragile as John seemed determined to diagnose him). (Which related to several of the contemptible conditions of his release, namely that he was not to exercise any ‘sudden or strenuous movement’ for — John had gripped his hand like a vice, not out of comfort, but to catch and hold his attention (surely violating his ethical code in the process! Sherlock was sure he had bruises! thankfully it wasn’t his bow hand) — for
The sight of Sherlock’s lips rounding around his cock was, he knew with absolute conviction, the second hottest thing he had experienced in living memory, second only to the
And there had been so many of those lately. Swings of enormous extremes, a ship heaving and crashing on hurricane-force swells.
And that was the crux of the problem: Sherlock adored John. He wanted him, desperately (he had, he was forced to admit, with the taste of John’s skin full in his mouth, for far more than 800 days). But he was not safe. Bergen, Miami, Belgrade: he had been beaten to a pulp in all three of those places, in addition to other activities about which he did not want John ever to know. He had been without John all that time, wanting him, but the idea that John wanted to follow him – intoxicating as it was – could only bring John to harm.
A minute of fiddling with the television landed on — oh, lord. The corner of the screen (the strain on his eyes, another unwelcome consequence of the drugs and this absurd fiasco generally) proclaimed another terrible James Bond film was playing — good grief, were the masses so anxious about imperilled masculinity that they sought, in every way, to idolise a constantly-renewingly virile monolith of heterosexual promiscuity and poor gun handling? The damned films didn’t even have the decency to make logical sense! And they seemed to be broadcast on some channel or other
, John. In any event, all the relevant details will be printed on the tickets, including the date and time: in this case, today, half past four. Must get dressed — the curtain will not wait! You are going to love this one,’ he grinned gleefully, then shot up and dashed away, a ridiculous blur of naked energy.
At just before the appointed time, Sherlock, stomach coiling in hot distracting undulations, put Ovid back in his cage. ‘We should at least teach him one of the original phrases.’
‘Mycroft’s people, I think. Probably got him to go through a special high-res CCTV security gate at the Grand National or something, scanned everything they could without him noticing.’ Sherlock had mentioned something like this toward the beginning, when the possibility of digital or even imaginary records was striking John as more and more likely.
John’s exhale contained a laugh as he moved to sit in his armchair, and Sherlock’s mouth twitched in satisfaction. John was impressed. Excellent.
'Sherlock glared; he was not discussing recent escalations with Mycroft, no matter what extremes of torture his brother meted out.'
Remembering suddenly, he cleared his throat to tell her about the publishing contract — the meeting he supposed he’d find time for next week — when she sniffed,
The leftovers from Mrs. Hudson’s fantastic stew heated up just fine (Sherlock would almost certainly be a brat about the grease) so he settled with his laptop in the kitchen and finally composed his response to the editor.
‘Sherlock, you have to understand. I’m not proud of those things. My gun, or how I treated all the girlfriends you helped me chase out of here, or the gambling, or wanting to go punch Gruener’s bloody lights out.  I’ve not always been as good a man as I could have been. Should have been. And now you’re telling me “it’s what I’m like”? That’s… ’
Naturally Sherlock had expected that the book would be dedicated in some form to him (well, either him, or John’s mother, but since John’s mother had featured prominently in the Acknowledgements section, balance of probability left
Sherlock could not – would not – allow this woman, whose mere ghost had been the bane of their existence, haunting their every move, for months, for almost a year, since before Sherlock had known he would survive to see John Watson’s face again, to have any more of their lives. He moved around the corner, finally arriving at the end of what would have been the pews, and stayed low as he now found himself behind even AGRA, the last man before the door, before any of them could leave…
John kissed him, sighing and sucking Sherlock’s lips with his sun-burn-hot lips shoving and embracing and pulling his body so hard against Sherlock’s that it hurt in a way that dreams couldn’t achieve.
Sherlock’s long, painterly fingers were tapping out something on his phone before slowing and slipping the mobile back into his coat.
, riding out their near-simultaneous orgasms with a moan, fingers biting so hard he was sure they drew blood.
She looked up at him, mouth full, and started to speak, but he broke in in an undertone, ‘No, go on, it’s — it’s just us for dinner, apparently. He’s…’ — for some reason the word caught momentarily in his throat, but he pushed past it and sat on his usual chair opposite the bench — ‘he’s sleeping.’
when only the sugar, the formaldehyde, and the lens cleaner were in labelled tubes — in this madness, Molly had apparently
Wiping her cheeks one last time and then rubbing her hands on her thighs as if to warm herself, Suze got to her feet — she was shorter than either of them — and came round to stand by the door. They both went to shake her hand, neither of them (John knew) giving a damn if it was clammy or flakey or covered in thick mascara.
‘Gruener keeps a converted abbey in Kingston — the symbolism is appallingly tedious — while Violet has a flat in Covent Garden. Her own property, or, well, her family’s, but same thing, essentially. Trust fund.’
As ever, remaining mistakes have nothing to do with my beta and everything to do with changes I insist on making after she'd seen it. Comments and feedback incredibly appreciated.
‘Gruener keeps a book. It involves personal anecdotes of his assignations with underaged young women — girls, ages approximately thirteen to sixteen. When one of his employees procures a new “worker” who meets Gruener’s approval, Gruener reserves the right to “break her in” to her new career.
(How, after several confrontational and highly emotional conversations, could he believe Sherlock at all ambivalent? Could he be so blind? Sherlock thought his feelings about John were almost certainly visible — dangerously so — to strangers on the pavement, to Mycroft and Sir James, to the bloody delicious-smelling long-dead cow cooling in a soup on the tabletop.)
,’ Suze was seething in a raised voice even over the noise of his breathing and the thunder of his fears as he raced, as quietly yet quickly as possible, through the bowels of the house up the long-neglected narrow stone staircase, scrabbling with hands on both walls as he climbed, ‘
John had not stayed in Baker Street during their time apart. Though he had no interest in seeing the no doubt ghastly closet John had been inhabiting without him two-and-a-half miles north of his home, Sherlock had been obsessively curious (obviously, his mind was unstoppable that way) to know the details of John’s continued daily life while Sherlock himself was in France, Norway, Serbia, Indonesia, Florida, Venezuela, and finally England again. First he had absorbed clues from Molly, who (romantic) supplied nervous updates on John at Sherlock’s first hint. Then, after having to go without electronic contact for nearly three months, he resurfaced to find a communiqué from (and he despised how unsurprised he was) Mycroft. From then on, his irregular exchanges with various informants through official and deeply unofficial channels had sated his need for reassurance. John was alive; everything else was irrelevant.
, considering when they’d begun this exchange, break over), he set his phone down and began mapping out the circuit he and Suze would take for today’s walkabout: around the Market, Camberwell, then down along the Brixton Road (pausing for side streets with relevant visibility:privacy:traffic:aesthetic ratios)…
Billy was successfully not selling his charity newspapers (already met his quota; required to stand outside for another eleven minutes; recently had his hair cut short (though still greasy), by a short woman with long black hair, his girlfriend then, left-handed and — pregnant) outside the Tesco Express.
A few minutes later, untucking the trapped collar of his jacket, he looked at the pair of them, quietly retreated already into their own worlds — Molly with her feet tucked under her, a notepad on her lap and two large books sprawled open around her; Sherlock, eyes shut and mouth thin, hands steepled in front of him as though deep into his Mind Palace. Except…
John had attempted to kiss him earlier, which had been euphoric and positive, but Sherlock couldn’t work properly to secure John Horner’s liberty and catch James Ryder while imagining, with leaping, nauseated thoughts, how painful it would be when John told him he was too much.
‘I didn’t go into the army to get a fix: I went into the army because there was a hard job to do. One that most people would wet themselves even to imagine. And I just thought that, if I could handle it without losing my shit, there might just be a place for me there — people that really needed help and work that I could do… maybe even do well, without letting people down. Not that I always succeeded, even though I
‘That’s good!’ Molly mumbled encouragingly — or as encouragingly as one could with a mouth full of curry.
‘Right, yeah,’ John echoed, trying not to give away that this was as startling news as it was. ‘Been a while.’
Sherlock swivelled, striding down the narrow tiled corridor to stand definitively before the last and only shut door.
He grabbed the Wiltshire sliced ham and cheddar from the drawer (disinfected of his experiment with saliva, no matter what John or Mrs Hudson bemoaned). With silent efficiency he assembled a sandwich.
John smiled at her, more warmly, he hoped, than Sherlock had managed. ‘But, really, Molly, it’s… it’s not nice stuff. Pretty bloody awful, even when it isn’t a surprise.’
Momentarily John’s face creased with scepticism, before, after evidently making sense of Sherlock’s point, he swallowed. Then — infinitesimally — his shoulders unclenched. Sherlock felt his face burning, but refused to fidget or otherwise betray the enormity of this admission.
John jumped straight into waking to discover several things: first, that it was dawn; second, that (miraculously) Sherlock was still in bed with him, tucked forcefully into John’s armpit; and third, that the light in the loo was on, while faintly the sound of someone brushing their teeth
Well, he supposed that answered his questions. And, really, despite a ripple of resentment, he couldn’t actually blame her: this was, objectively, a foolish thing they were trying to do. It was just as likely to succeed as blow up in their faces. And Molly didn’t
want to? Did he want anything more than to drink in the multi-sensory wonder that was John Watson gone spent with pleasure? Sherlock declined with a too-long shake of his head, eyes bouncing back and forth over John, unable to keep still under the lamplight of John’s gaze (he appreciated the irony).
