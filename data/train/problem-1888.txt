John hated it, hid from it for most of his life but sometimes, especially in the dead silence of night when he could hear the whispers the droplets made when they hit the ground. Sherlock had weaseled his way into John’s mind just as much as he was inside the Detective’s. It wasn’t right, John knew this and told himself this every single day,
However, thoughts of his mates sleeping in the cold, starving, just as he had done to avoid situations like this started to return, making the food churn in his stomach. He would rather starve than be hand fed delicious food,
If the way he reacted to Archie was anything to go by, his John was becoming the man Sherlock had tried to create those many years ago. John cast out the darkness in Sherlock’s mind, but in turn, he also fed the monster with every time he moaned or called out Sherlock’s name. They were two broken pieces, but now that they were together, they were whole.
But, the thing was, John was happy he had met Sherlock. Happy that he had been kidnapped. Happy that he was bathing Sherlock right now.
Finally, the GPS popped up and told John exactly where he needed to go. “Haha! Yes!” John shouted, bouncing a little in his seat in his excitement. One of his master plans finally worked. “It’s about bloody time!”
“Sir, it’s-“ he held up his hand, silencing her to read his texts from Sherlock.
A big thanks to TPurr for her beta skills on this chapter. I did change a few things after I sent it to her, so all mistakes are mine.
“Don’t!” he shouted, his face red as he shoved Sherlock away. He stood up, wobbling a bit on his bad leg, “I bet that’s ex-exactly what you told him, too!” John pointed at the screen, his face contorted into a sick and horrifying version of its normal beauty.
After a moment of making sure both parties were enjoying themselves and John was not being harmed, but rather participating, Mycroft had enough. “William Sherlock Holmes!” The banging stopped and what he saw next would forever hold a place on the mantel piece in Sherlock’s room of his mind palace.
It took John another hour to finish up all his homework, then he showered, kissed his mum goodnight, and crashed on his bed. He tried to fall asleep but for some reason he couldn’t get Sherlock’s praise and the photo he had sent to him out of his head. He loved the fact that he didn’t even have to ask for the photo, either, Sherlock just offered it up, because that’s what friends do. John convinced himself, but it was strange and to be honest a little scary that a bloke he hadn’t even met was taking up so much of his head space. The teen rolled over a couple of times, finally shaking off his confusion at his feelings and falling to sleep.
He could tell John was already in distress just from seeing the boy, causing Sherlock to bask in his own brilliance for just a moment.
Sherlock sighed, going over to stand in front of the stairs just in case the man tried to play one of his games and get to John before he could. “I’m sure he is aware of the situation, however, he has not decided to grace me with his presence.”
“Yeah,” John answered with a nod. He remembered how Greg had lowered his gun at the hospital when he saw how terrified John was.
Thanks for all the great support for this fic. Sorry the chapters have been a bit short. I'm still trying to figure out where I'm going to go with this fic. I'm thinking a darker route, but I'm not sure yet.
Without thinking, Sherlock dropped the laptop, which he would burn later, and sprinted up after the wayward teenager. Hopefully, he would be able to talk some since into him and salvage a month’s worth of hard work. “John!” he shouted when he saw the skinnier leg give way under the force of the boy’s running. In one swift movement, with both John’s safety and knowing this was the best way to rebuild trust on his mind, Sherlock leapt up three steps and caught the falling boy in his arms. His back hit the wall but their descent had been halted and now John continued to struggle in the make shift bear hug he’d used to catch him.
“You bastard,” the boy mumbled under his breath, his hands clenching into fists at being called ‘ill’ and the thought of Subs being put down like rabid dogs.
“Ha, are you kidding me? I’m great but well tired now, thanks for that.” The boy said laughing again as Sherlock watched him get up to change his clothes. The detective was quiet while he watched the oblivious boy strip out of his soiled clothes, searching for a fresh pair long enough for the man to get a good view of the tight cheeks that would be his soon enough.
Greg continued to twitch and struggle weakly, pressing at John’s shoulders and trying to kick the vampire off. “I’m trying to help, hunter,” John growled, letting his anger at the situation get the better of him. The terrified look in those wide brown eyes below him, made the old vampire soften. He’d forgotten what it was like to fear death; to worry if the breath that escaped one’s lunges would be the last.
“This is for your own good, John,” Sherlock said as he positioned himself behind the Sub. He started with the two wrist restraints, clicking them into place. Then, he used the chain linking the leather together to position the second pair of leather cuffs just above John’s elbows, ensuring the teens arms stayed motionless behind his back. Finally, he snapped the chest harness in place, connecting it to the leather and delicate chains.
“Understood. Now, please, we need to hurry. Once the shift happens, he’ll be a danger to everyone.”
“Oh, of course, it was your first time, how could I be so unobservant. I’m sure your arse is unbelievably sore, yeah? I’m sorry I hurt you, John, but that’s how it always feels after the first time.” Sherlock gave an odd sympathetic smile, reaching up to plant a soft kiss just on the teenager’s nose. John couldn’t stop the smile or the warm rush of heat coursing through his body when those silver eyes gazed down at him, lust and love in their depths. “However, my John, you are quite a lucky lad. Do you know why?” The older man began crawling down the small body with a predatory grin plastered over his features. If the teenager was honest with himself, the look terrified him, but made his cock twitch, which in itself was confusing as hell.
“You know,” Sherlock smiled, which was not the reaction John was hoping for. He pulled out an alcohol wipe and dabbed his gently onto the Sub’s bleeding knuckles. “For someone who was shaking in fear not ten minutes ago because he thought I was going to rape him, you make a lot of sexual references.”
“What?” John asked, his memory slowly coming back to how he carried Jim and Sherlock out on his back.
If you have been to WestQuay in Southampton I do apologize for the inaccuracy in my portrayal of the layout. I based my facts off of their website and Google Maps and tweaked it a tiny bit to fit the story, so I'm sorry if it was confusing.
“Alright, roll up your sleeves, Mycroft,” John said. Thankfully, the man didn’t argue and took off his suit jacket and did as John asked. “I’m going to wake him up now. Is everyone ready?”
Mycroft’s eyes grew wide and his anger boiled over at the thought of his baby brother being turned by some heathen. John Watson was supposed to be an easy take down, hell, the vampire didn’t even kill his meals. But no, his stupid brother had to go and get a pet vampire. Now, if what the vampire said was true, Sherlock would become what Mycroft had created an entire organization to kill.
“Good, now let’s go and remember, stay safe and if you see anyone, run as far away from them as possible, yeah?” He let go of his sister as they finally arrived at the house.
Sherlock's POV. A fellow hunter comes for a visit. It doesn't go as well as Sherlock would've hoped.
“Sherlock, fuck,” John voice, breathless as his come was sucked greedily from him. As his legs got back their strength, John went on auto pilot and got down on his knees when Sherlock stood up. It didn’t matter if he didn’t have enough time. All John knew was that Sherlock had pleasured him and now he wanted to do the same.
Molly held Greg’s hand as they walked into the house. She liked holding his hand, especially after spending the day at the scary hospital. John had looked so sick and scared, even Greg seemed worried. “Is John going to be okay?” she asked, looking up at the tall man.
“I think it’s time for you to leave,” the detective stood up, looming over the Irishman.
and then pulled the duvet all the way up to his neck. “S-Sherlock?” John stuttered, his eyes flicking between the men, looking for reassurance from his keeper.
“It was John. John killed Moriarty, not Sherlock.”
wrist, Sherlock moved down to the right ankle, pushing around on the skin, realizing this too was only slightly torn ligaments. He caressed the tanned ankle, cringing when the ghosts of John’s cries echoed through his mind. The small whimpers, which had come from the boy when Sherlock carried him back upstairs, threatened to start a brutal hurricane in the detectives mind. John could not take care for himself, that was evident now, and Sherlock would do everything in his power to make sure his boy stayed safe and well protected from both the teen’s rebellious nature and the dangers the world had to offer. If the last twenty minutes had proven anything to the detective, it was that he would certainly die or be consumed by his own madness if John was not by his side for eternity.
because the thought of where this cock had been last night would have been disgusting to put into his mouth. The warm throbbing was calming and he continued to suck as far down as he could, without pushing too far down into his throat. Once, he got a bit too far down when Sherlock accidentally thrust his hips up, causing him to gag slightly and tears to form in his eyes. He remembered he’d done the same thing earlier, so John wasn’t mad but he did wish he was strong enough to hold them down like Sherlock was able to do to him.
When John heard the car pull away, he let Sherlock’s hands go, but he kept his full weight on him, forbidding the young vampire to rise. He slowly put his hands on Sherlock’s cheeks to hold his face still while John looked into black eyes that were slowly fading back into a light silvery blue. Leaning down and keeping constant eye contact, John let his lips touch Sherlock’s. It was brief, but as John pulled away, he let his tongue flick Sherlock’s bottom lip.
“Come,” Sherlock motioned for John to stand up and then placed a warm hand on the Subs neck possessively. Instead of shrugging it off though, John left it there as it helped clear his mind so he could think of a way to escape. However, his thoughts could only seem to dwell on the hand resting at his nape and any thoughts of escape were far away and pointless.
“You did promise him, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, lifting his arm up and around John’s back, tucking the Sub close.
After two more days, John and Sherlock were both discharged. John was excited to go home until he realized their home had been blown up by the Resistance. “Where are we going to go?” he asked, as Mycroft signed release papers.
“I’m not me. I’m not…” John paused, unsure of how to answer the question. When he thought about it, sometimes it was hard to remember why he didn’t want the bliss Sherlock gave him. “It’s scary,” he finally admitted, because it was the scariest thing on the planet to be taken down to a place where he was completely dependent on a Dom.
“Well thank goodness you’re above all that,” John said without thinking. His tongue always seemed to get the better of him in dangerous situations, which was not always the best survival strategy.
“These second generation collars, they help Subs feel bliss, right? If all those Subs in the kennels are fitted with one, then they won’t have to be put down. It will save thousands of Subs around the world.” John couldn’t help the smile on his face. He just knew how important these collars were. All he had to do was look at Jim, who begged and pleaded to have it left on.
“Of course,” she said, pulling out a few pieces of paper from the folder and sliding it over to everyone at the table.
With one last look at the intertwined forms, Mycroft turned around with the tray in hand. Before he closed the door, he whispered. “Goodnight, my boys.”
“I’m only a few blocks down the street, get in,” Sherlock commanded, pulling the last string to make the boy’s foot get into the car, and he was rewarded with watching the smiling boy’s head disappear under his eye line of the top of the car and into the front seat. It took five minutes to get to the flat, but they sang ‘Another Brick in the Wall,’ from one of the CDs all the way there.
It actually wasn’t too bad, John considered for a moment as the sweet grape burst in his mouth. There was a constant hand on his head, which was still pressed gently against Mycroft’s thigh while he chewed. As if knowing how hungry John actually was, Mycroft lowered a piece of ham and cheese to the boy’s lips. “That’s it,” the praise seemed to make the food taste even better as it was popped into his mouth. It was strange letting his hands hang to his side, or perhaps even more strange the fact that he didn’t even want to move them to whip his mouth off. It would be nice, John though, if the gnawing thoughts in the back of his head would just leave him alone and let him bask in the calmness of oblivion.
Molly grabbed the chocolate ice cream out of Sherlock’s hand and ran forward to sit down next to John. She crossed her legs and handed John his, which seemed to be Rocky Road. “I…umm,” John stuttered. Although he had tricked the nurse easily, John found it hard, if not impossible, to lie to the tall Dom before him.
While Sherlock kneeled half way on the bed, John threw his tray against the wall, letting the hungry beast inside him break free. His eyes turned black and his teeth dropped in under a second, as he grabbed Sherlock by the collar of his shirt and threw him down on the bed. John straddled the taller man’s hips, pinning his hands above his head with one of his own.
“Very good,” John stood up, pointed at Jim to let him know he was in charge of holding on to Molly during their ‘adventure.’ “Mike, I want you to be look out for any cops or IBAD patrols, yeah?”
“Okay,” was all he could manage, still confused but would accept it if that was what Sherlock wanted. After all, Sherlock was a zillion times smarter than everyone so he must have a plan, John realized, smiling a bit to himself at the thought.
“I don’t…please, don’t,” John stuttered out, looking up to meat Sherlock’s eyes. Strangely enough, his pupils weren’t dilated, but more clinical than anything.
“That is enough!” John heard Mycroft yell from the kitchen. The man did not appear around the corner though, which John was ever grateful for as he counted up the amount of curse words he’d used. “Both of you, in here, now,” Mycroft basically growled out the command. Not only was John surprised at how quickly his own feet moved to follow the order, but also how Sherlock followed directly behind him without question. It was out of character for the younger brother, or any Dom for that matter, to follow such a strong dominate command on principle alone.
“You position here is terminated, Dr. Magnussen, and I will see you are brought up on charges. Security will escort you out,” Mycroft growled, walking the Doctor outside the room.
Also, now that we are only one chapter away from the end I hope most of you like the type of ending I've chosen to go with. As you can imagine there are probably a hundred different ways this story could have gone. I know a lot of you have become emotionally invested in this story, so I do apologize if you've read this far and it did not take the turn you were hoping for. I know how that feels, LoL, so that's why 'I'm sorry if it didn't end like you expected but I hope you enjoyed this one and the rest of the story.' (:
Strangely, John heard a familiar gasp from the man next to him.
The vampire growled deeply, blood dripping down his chin as he strained against the ghost twine. Something primal was triggered in Sherlock, an urge to protect his sire so great he felt his whole body ache with fear and anger. If this human hurt his sire, Sherlock would…
“Oh,” John said dumbly, as he started to brew the kettle. “Are you sure you’re feeling okay? I’ve never seen what happens to the people I drink from. Any type of withdrawal symptoms?”
Greg just glared at John and, well, the vampire really couldn’t blame him.
He zipped up the bag, grabbed the scones and milk, then headed up the stairs contemplating what he was going to do about John’s failure from earlier. When he stepped into the room, he stopped dead, eyes going wide but doing his best to stay calm. It wouldn’t do to frighten the boy who was sitting on the floor aiming a pistol right at the detective’s chest. “John?” Sherlock kept his voice soft but inside he was kicking himself for underestimating John’s mobility with the casts and leaving the stupid gun in his drawer, just in case.
“I like…I like eating from Sherlock’s hand,” John heard himself say, his most private desire thrown out to hundreds of people carelessly.
He didn’t even realize he was violently shaking until Sherlock put his hand back, bringing a calming sensation over John like he had stepped into a warm bath.
“But I wanted to,” Sherlock groaned, grinding his hips up to meet John. A hardness pressed against his own, and that’s when John knew he no longer had control of his actions.
For once in his life, John truly wished his Doms were there to tell him what to do.
“So they tried to remove Jim’s collar, but you stopped them?”
“John, look at me,” the boy did, staring into the dark eyes of the Inspector, “I need you to be honest with us, okay? It is very important that we get the real story of what happened between you and Sherlock. We want to help you both, John.”
He couldn’t move quick enough, and the next thing he knew Sebastian was lying dead on the floor and John was motionless in front of him. “John!” Sherlock screamed, his voice reaching a pitch he didn’t know was possible as he felt his entire soul shatter. He ran over and knelt by John, picking him up in his arms to examine the gushing wound on his shoulder. The bullet had gone clean through on the opposite side of the ‘SH.’
“Come on,” the red headed man said. He helped John stand up and follow Jim out the back of the van. The younger Sub looked terrified out of his mind and continued to wring his hands together nervously.
John woke up with a warm pressure on his chest and a throbbing pain in his arse. Warm breath ghosted over his throat, causing goose bumps to rise over his arms and chest. Suddenly, as if the Devil himself had rushed into his mind and turned on the light, John remembered everything that happened last night. How Sherlock had lied to him about his age, how he loved kissing Sherlock, the way Sherlock had gently washed him, told him he was beautiful and special, how Sherlock hadn’t stopped when John was crying out for him to pull out.
Hello, hello, everyone!
Shaking the memories away, John turned his attention back to Greg, who was gulping down the last sip of orange juice. “I reopened his turning bite. Since I’m his sire, my DNA is already a part of him, so when my saliva reenters his system it sort of…shuts him down until I close up the wound. I’m not really sure why it works, but it is only a power given to a sire for his or her progeny. I suppose it’s a way to help control a newly formed vampire.”
This chapter is Sherlock's POV, describing how he plans to keep John. This chapter took me a bit longer than normal because I did a lot of research on UK ID papers. I'm sure there are going to be a few loop holes or something I missed, so if it is a very important detail I would appreciate any and all corrections you can offer and I will fix it. However, if it is just a tiny nitpick I would still like to hear it but I can't promise I will fix it quickly(:
At those words, John knew exactly who he was and what he wanted to do. No more self-conscious kid stuff, no more kidding around, no more being scared, he wanted this, no he needed this. “Hey Sherlock?”
“Ahhhh!” He screamed when the pain started all over again, this time a bit lower than the first.
“Hey, John come on, we’re gonna be late,” John looked up from his phone to realize he had walked all the way to school while texting.
“I’m alright, My,” the hunter said, smiling a little when Mycroft caressed his cheek.
Chapter 9 – Light it Up
The small touches as Sherlock gently pulled a shirt over John’s head made the Sub shiver and short pulses of blood go straight to his cock. Thankfully, Sherlock either didn’t notice or had the grace not to mention it and just continued to pick John’s feet up one by one, pulling pants and then trousers over his semi-hard length. “Much better,” he said, as if completing a beautiful painting.
“Well, that depends on what he’s charged with but…well, that’s not really a question I can answer right now. You’re going to be fine though, John, Sherlock already told us that you weren’t involved in the death of Jim Moriarty. He said you were hiding under the covers the whole time,” Greg whispered back to him, squeezing him tighter.
Chapter 10 – I Got Mine
“Shhh, relax John, you want this, you told me,” Sherlock cooed stroking the now flaccid cock in his hand. The boy’s mouth shot open in a silent scream when he felt his mate was eight inches deep inside him, taking his virginity.
“I don’t see why you’re so bashful. I’ve already seen you naked,” Sherlock said, as if they were talking about a football game.
Licking his lips, he checked the man’s pulse, making sure he hadn’t taken too much. “Thank you,” John said, patting the man’s cheek, which almost knocked him over. “Let’s see where you live, shall we.” He supported the man with one arm easily and reached into his back pocket, pulling out his wallet. Save for a couple of quid and ID, there wasn’t much in the wallet. It was enough though, and John quickly found an address.
“Jim,” a frustrated voice whispered from the doorway. Greg appeared, shutting the door behind him. “It’s three in the morning, and you’re supposed to be in bed, not bothering John.”
John balked, angry at the man for not even letting him speak. He glared at Mycroft, who glared right back at him, except the latter’s was much, much more terrifying. The Sub’s teenage stubbornness decided to kick in, so John dug his feet in, ready for whatever Mycroft was about to do to him.
“No…no, I don’t believe that,” John said, stopping and looking pensively at the medicine in the coat. It was strange, but at the time, he hadn’t realized how everything they needed was sitting right there in the medicine cabinet.
Hey all! Sorry about the delay! This chapter was suppose to be a lot longer, but I wanted to post something. Hopefully, I will get part 2 up before the end of this coming week. I'm condo hunting right now, so every time I get on my laptop I go to Zillow instead of writing. Damn living is expensive!
“She…she,” John thought back to his meeting with the strange woman and realized that Sherlock was right, she didn’t offer him anything.
With a final glare, which John concluded could melt ice, towards the Sub on the floor, Mycroft left the room holding his hand to his chest. John smiled to himself pleasantly, enjoying the freedom his mind and body felt when he wasn’t touching Sherlock or Mycroft. The ground was cold, as was his body, but it was nice to be his own man. “Well, that was quite unexpected,” Sherlock broke the bliss John was trying to create for himself. “Though I must say, I was surprised you didn’t do more than bite. Come on, up you go,” he said, grunting as he hauled John up to his feet with a hand under his arm.
Jim couldn’t help the small smile that came to his face. Everything was going to be okay, now that Greg was coming to get him, it was all going to be okay. There was an empty chair against the wall that Jim plopped down in, waiting for his Dom. He kicked his heels against the wall until Ms. Jameson gave him a displeased look.
“It’s worth it, I think,” he scratched his head, but still didn’t make eye contact with John.
Quickly, John lowered his head, pressing his chin to his chest to avoid any eye contact and portray the epitome of submission. “Yes, sir,” he whispered, making his voice meek. Inside though, the teenager was jumping up and down, patting himself on the back for figuring out his next plan of action to get away. The celebration was over the moment it began though and John was screaming, his knees hitting the floor with a loud thud as the collar produced another wave of electricity throughout his nervous system.
John looked back at his Doms, then back out to the crowd. He knew he was supposed to promote the collar, and he also knew the collar was a good thing for Subs. Taking a deep breath, John admitted what wasn’t necessarily a lie, but also not necessarily the truth. He loved Sherlock, of course he did, hell, he even cared about Mycroft to some extent, but it wasn’t the collar that did that.
John sat up, “no, I brought some. I’ll go change,” he stood up and walked slowly towards the hall. When the air hit the wet spots on his clothes it seemed to start a chain reaction of coldness shooting through his body. Now he wanted the warmness Sherlock had to offer.
The man took a sip of his coffee, “oh, I don’t mind. It’s up to you though, what would you like to do John? We can stay here and finish up or if you’d like we can go back to my flat and finish up there. I think I have some food there if you’re hungry or there’s a Chinese restaurant down the street we can order from.”
“I saw her go into your hospital room. She’s a well-known member of the SR and you live with two men who are pursuing ground breaking work in helping Subs with RDD. Not too complicated, John.” Sherlock, in fresh clothes, brought some in for John to wear.
Hey everyone!
“Sir, here are some documents for you to sign. They are the contracts going out to the Palace in the morning.” Anthea said, placing the papers and a gold plated pen on Mycroft’s desk. He looked them over briefly, knowing his apt assistant would inform him of any problems or changes. As he handed her the signed papers, he saw how she twisted her fingers together nervously.
“Uh-uh, no way am I letting her go. She’s the only thing standing between me and the shot!” John shouted at him. He knew what they did to violent Subs, hell, they did it to any Sub who caused too many problems. They’d stick him in a kennel for a couple of days, and tie him down to some bed, and then inject him with some sort of poison made just for Subs. He knew, oh did he know! And that, friends and neighbors, was why John Watson wasn’t letting go of his hostage.
John jumped out of bed, the sounds of footsteps coming up the stairs making him panic.
However, it wasn’t only the way Sherlock’s movements had become more fluid instead of sharp or his eyes stayed on him instead of dart around, looking for threats or God knows what, no, it was his voice and the different tone he used when he talked about John that convinced Mycroft the boy might be better off at Baker Street. If John was the teddy bear then anyone who tried to hurt him would get a sucker punch to the stomach or most likely worse now that Sherlock had access to guns.
“Cool,” was all he got from the sleepy youth before he saw the blue irises disappear below closed eyelids.
It took no time at all to retrieve the cameras he’d placed in John’s old room,
“Of course he’s not feeling alright,” Harry said, grabbing John’s bicep. “Those arseholes brainwashed him and now he’s not our John anymore! It’s going to be okay though, isn’t it Jim?”
Okay, so this is it guys. John's POV of his first sexual encounter with Sherlock. It is not as bad as I originally thought it was going to be, but by the end it is gets pretty intense. So please, PLEASE, look at the updated tags and know that this is dub-con verging on rape because John is a minor and unsure. If you are easily triggered by these things, DO NOT READ. I do not wish to upset or trigger somebody inadvertently, so just be aware of what you are getting into.
“Five years.”
John followed after Mycroft stepped out of the car, keeping his head hung low but his eyes up to see where they were taking him. It was a giant brick building, unassuming and plain, however; every Sub in the world knew this was not a place to take lightly. Mycroft attached a lead to the cuffs keeping John’s arms bound behind him and tugged. The Sub gave a loud grunt, glaring up at the man whose icy gaze and threatening finger on the button in his pocket forced John to lower his gaze and accept that he was to be walked around like a dog. “Come along,” Mycroft said, straightening his posture a bit as they walked into the building. “Let me do the talking.”
“Is there something else, Anthea?” He questioned, not looking up from the papers on his desk.
“Yeah? And where is that?” John asked, scooting closer to the door. He prepared himself to jump out when suddenly, the locks shot down into the door where John couldn’t reach it.
“Ah, John, Sherlock, good of you to join me,” Mycroft said. He was sitting in his chair behind a wooden desk, and had a glass of what appeared to be scotch in his hand. “John,” he set his glass down and leaned forward to brace one elbow on the desk. “What you did today was dangerous and juvenile, not to mention disobedient. You ran from your Doms. That is your first offence. Secondly, you took someone hostage-”
“But, but I…I need,” yes, he did want to do it now. It was already there, in his grasp, why not take it and be done?
“Like what?!” Lestrade yelled back, but the mysterious man was already getting into a cab. The DI scratched his head in confusion but knew Sherlock was always right, so he had the knife sent off for printing.
John visits Jim. Things do not go as Sherlock planned. There is something Mycroft isn't telling us.
John growled. He wanted to just take, and now Sherlock was stopping him. It took everything he had to fight off his predatory need, and be patient with the human who had already made his way to the center of the spider web. “Why’s that, love?” John purred, keeping his finger circling Sherlock’s hole while he kissed along the man’s back.
“Sherlock,” he broke away from the deepening kiss, “what happened? Wh-why am I here and not in a hospital? Where is my mum?” John watched the man’s eyes carefully, trying and failing not to lower his gaze and watch the swollen lips that had sucked him off the night before.
“I see,” Sherlock said, “well Mycroft will be able to go home in a couple of days, and then we will discuss what will happen with the collar program.”
“Please, I’m not lying. I’m sure you’ve seen how much pain Sherlock is in right now without me. It will only get worse if you don’t let me see him.”
“Yes, John,” the little girl said, ducking deeper into her coat to stay warm.
When John stepped out he realized where they were. “Sherlock, no!” John’s voice was shaking as he pulled on the lead with both hands. There was no way he was going into the kennels, no fucking way!
“Let’s go,” Sherlock said, tugging slightly on the lead and stepping out of the car.
“Because I know where those steps lead to,” John retorted. He continued washing himself until he realized he cock wanted to come out and play.
“I protected him, Mycroft, and don’t-“
“Thank you Anthea, please alert Tech that Sherlock’s most likely rewired his phone and laptop so they will need to get out there and re-bug 221B as soon as possible.”
John sat there, content that no one could hurt him while Mycroft answered questions about the new collar. Most of them were technical specifications, but John’s ears perked up when they were about him.
“Okay,” John whispered, making all the lights in Sherlock’s mind glow with a light brighter than the sun.
Finally thinking straight, John sat up, his stomach muscles straining, and was able to get his feet under him. “There we go,” Sherlock said almost proudly. “Now are you ready to listen?” The Dom asked, grabbing hold of John’s shoulders to keep him from fidgeting, or possibly even running. Although John knew running would be stupid and pointless…kicking on the other hand, seemed like a grand idea to get his point across.
“Don’t tell me how to take care of my Sub, Lestrade,” Sherlock said, but John had stopped paying attention a while ago and was trying to focus on what was happening to his eyes.
Molly watched the two men looking at each other with little smiles on their faces. It made her happy that Mycroft came over, not just for the chocolate, but because Greg always seemed to be happier when the red haired man was around. Molly smiled along with them as she ate her delicious sandwich, in a warm home, with comfy pajamas, and a kind new family.
Slowly, he turned his head to look out the window. They had made a wrong turn.
“Are you alright there, sweetheart?” She stopped and looked John over.
Sherlock’s heart was beating so fast, something deep inside John telling him to rip it out and feast upon the human. But John didn’t, instead he moved his hips, earning a groan from Sherlock. John wrapped one hand around Sherlock’s chest and began plowing into him, desperation and a darkness fueling his need.
I hope you enjoy the update(:
“Yes, of course everything is alright, don’t be obtuse,” Sherlock rolled his eyes, but let his fellow hunter in to the flat.
“You’re alright,” he reassured him, and began unbuttoning John’s shirt until a golden defined chest was exposed. With more care than given to a baby, Sherlock eased the shirt off, careful to not make John move his arm. “There,” he said. At that moment, Sherlock couldn’t help himself. He placed his hand on John’s nape and leaned in to kiss lax moist lips.
Sherlock had bought poppy seed bagels, John’s favorite, for the week. He toasted one up, spread a good amount of jam on the bread and began to eat as his laptop, also a gift from Sherlock, booted up. John took a swig of orange juice as he typed in his password and began working on his school assignments. It only took two hours before he was done and had the documents submitted for ‘inspection’ by one of Mycroft’s men.
Though he was mildly intrigued by this new turn of events, Sherlock had his own plans to draft and he was sure even the poor excuses for computer forensic scientists at the Yard would be able to find the common thread eventually. For now, though, he knew just how to use the situation to pull John all the way back into his arms for good. By the time John awoke for the day to come, Sherlock had two solid plans to ensure John would be at peace and finally accept his place by Sherlock’s side.
“I said I wouldn’t, so I won’t. At least not for a week,” Greg said, heading towards the exit. “Be careful here, Sherlock. You don’t know what a hungry animal is capable of.”
“Their hearts are different. John was alone, now he has me and I have him. We love each other.” Sherlock countered, knowing full well the Irishman had printed out their text messages, instant messages, and most likely hacked into the cameras he’d placed into John’s old house. It made his blood boil but they had already been down that road many times before and Sherlock had learned the hard way it was pointless to keep something from this man. Jim was like a virus, every time a cure was discovered to get rid of him, the disease had already adapted and was ten times more deadly. “But I wouldn’t expect you to understand something like that. Oh, yes, how is your mindless plaything? What was his name…oh, yes Sebastian. How is the young chap, almost seventeen now, correct?”
When the young vampire finally came back to reality, he was being held around the waist by John and Greg was pressed back against the door like he’d just seen a ghost. Sherlock was breathing hard and he could feel that his fangs had dropped.
“John, focus on your receptor,” she said while the other man was still working on getting the restraints off.
“So…”
“But-” John tried again, looking at Mycroft with pleading eyes.
“He’ll like that, I think. Well, like I said, I’ll drive you three to the Dom/Sub Affairs Center while Donovan heads the Subs transport.”
“Mycroft,” Sherlock growled, feeling himself ready to pounce if he didn’t get the answers he’d waited for for so long.
“Someday you’ll realize why Mycroft and I do what we do, John. I don’t expect you to understand it now, you’re just a child.”
I hope you all enjoyed! Only two more chapters to go(:
“Sherlock-“ he was cut off as he inhaled sharply when he felt a finger brush over the muscle of his hole. He wanted to push away, to stop, but that would be childish.
“Of course not,” Mycroft confirmed, “he’s been taken care of. Are you quite done with young Archibald?”
John followed Mycroft, who insisted the boy walk in front of him with a simple nod and fake smile. Perhaps given the chance, John might have tried to jump the Dom while his back was turned, even though he was a good head shorter and fifty pounds lighter, that had never stopped the Sub before when taking down threats to his gang.
“What’s wrong, John,” the boy sighed when he felt a warm hand on his shoulder, applying enough pressure for him to roll over on his back again. “Did I do something? Is your arm okay?”
There was no way Greg was going to get Mycroft out of here without bringing Sherlock. Greg knew how guilty Mycroft felt about his brother’s actions, even if Sherlock was a grown man who made his own decisions. His love for the other man wouldn’t allow Greg to put Mycroft in that sort of position.
“It’s not right!” Magnussen shouted. “That collar is disgraceful, Holmes, and a waste of time. That boy should be put down, just like the rest of those abominations! Get your hands off me!” Was the last thing John heard before the man was silenced.
“What are you doing?” John asked, keeping his eye on the needle. If Sherlock though he was going to stab that in his eye, he had another thing coming.
Sherlock still tasted like fire. Like smoke and burning cedar, but his lips were something akin to cinnamon. John sighed a little, letting his hand rest on Sherlock’s pale chest. Then, going against all his survival instincts had ever taught him, John let his Dom in. He opened his mouth slightly, letting Sherlock’s tongue in to explore his mouth. The man was gentle, oh was he gentle, as he caressed the back of John’s head and moved his tongue slowly against the roof of the Sub’s mouth.
“You League really are an ignorant lot, aren’t you?” John said, walking into the kitchen to pour another glass of orange juice. With a full glass, the vampire walked over to kneel by Mycroft’s head. “Sherlock released a chemical into Mycroft’s blood stream; much like a leech uses enzymes to numb the skin it is preparing to puncture. This chemical, however, acts like a drug, making our prey complacent and even-” John looked over at the tight material at Mycroft’s crotch “-appreciative.”
“As I said, John is still very confused and trying to unravel the knots you tied so intricately around his mind.”
As they walked up the stairs that was when Sherlock decided to mention Moriarty’s presence and visit to Baker Street. This was all he needed, not only did he have tremendous amounts of paper work to do to protect Britain and make sure his little brother’s actions were covered from every angle, but now he had to deal with that plague of a man, too.
The little nudge worked like magic and soon, John was washing the older man’s entire upper body. They even laughed like old lovers when the soap made a squish noise while the warm hand was massaging his pale bicep. More hesitation when the teen realized he would now have to follow in Sherlock’s footsteps and wash the much larger cock. He couldn’t have been prouder of his boy though, who tried desperately to hide his fear and took Sherlock’s full member in his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
John flinched at Sherlock and Mycroft being called a bastard, but tried to stay calm against the barrage of questions. “That’s…umm, a funny story too, I guess.”
John looked over at Sherlock, who was still looking down at the ground, his face contorted in anger.
John, sated and content, headed home. As he walked though, there was a strange sense of being watched. Every time he turned around, or looked in the bushes across the street, there was no one there. He sniffed around, smelling only a few humans, which were the people who lived in his building.
It was always hard on Greg. Though he was a phenomenal hunter, the man just seemed to abhor killing in general. Sherlock remembered on Greg’s first kill, the man had thrown up something awful. His heart was growing harder against the begging and pleading of their prey, but it obviously still took a toll on him.
Please enjoy and I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments!
Then, he felt his face being pulled into warm cloth and a soft thumping filled his ears. Sherlock had scooted closer, pulling John’s head to his chest to let the sorrowful tears soak into the gray sleep shirt. “I will never abandon you,” he heard the words come from above him but also in the vibrations from the man’s chest onto his tear stained cheek. For better or for worse, John believed him.
Sherlock watched as his eyes slowly turned black, an eclipse taking place over a deep blue ocean. John put a hand on Sherlock’s belly and one on his knee, then slowly moved his head to the cut. Sherlock didn’t miss the way John continued to sniff and fight not to nuzzle Sherlock’s hardening cock.
I hope you enjoy!
When Sherlock turned the computer around and saw the news article, everything became clear.
“Hey!” John shouted, or at least tried to shout. He was fighting a losing battle of staying away and listening to the conversation.
John learns the difference between Sherlock and Mycroft's style when it comes to retrieving information from a Sub. He's not sure which is worse.
“Huh,” was all John could say at the new development.
His hypothesis was correct. The blood was completely dead, no plasma, no white blood cells, nothing. His blood was nothing but a liquid to keep his body from falling over.
“John? John, are you okay in there?” That deep voice that sent shivers down his spine called from outside the bathroom door.
“I know,” he whispered and forced his way past the only resistance keeping him away from what was his.
“Tell him I am getting ready to leave to go on a case and you want him to come and talk,” Sherlock said, rubbing his hands on his knees in anticipation right before the snare trap released.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft started, after assuring the boy was asleep. “Sherlock, you know what happened back there can’t happen at the conference.”
“Sh-Sherlock,” he heard John whimper as he played with the foreskin, wondering briefly how John liked to wank himself. Yes, he’d seen the video, but the stupid technology wouldn’t allow him to see exactly how his boy liked to pleasure himself. It was no matter though, because John was an open book when it came to these new sensations Sherlock was giving him, and it was evident what the boy liked and didn’t like. And John definitely liked this part. After a few minutes though, he could feel the boy tensing, approaching orgasm, so he pulled away, making the boy yearn for more of what only Sherlock could provide.
He went to the kitchen, double checking that Sherlock was still passed out on the ground, and filled a glass full of sugary orange juice. “Drink,” John told him, shoving the glass into the man’s hands. While the hunter gulped it down, John ran his fingers over the healed wounds on Greg’s neck. Luckily, there was no scaring even though Sherlock went at the man’s neck like a rabid wolf.
“Do you remember what happened?” He continued stroking over the teen’s smooth stomach slowly, as to not attract his conscious attention but to covertly fill the boy’s hormone addled brain with endorphins.
John tried to bring up images of Sherlock domming him, but during a fight it was hard to focus on anything other than being tackled. David grabbed John around the stomach and lifted him high into the air to land on the taller Sub’s shoulder.
Hey everyone!
“I will, however, win him back. Do you really think this barista stands a chance for John’s heart now that I’m back? Really, Mycroft? No, I will simply go to his flat and wait for him to fall into my arms, like he’s meant to do.”
“Yes,” John answered, trying desperately to remember Mycroft’s number. He’d memorized it just in case he ever needed to use another phone other than his mobile.
Sherlock huffed, sitting up on the couch and running his hands over his robe to smooth it down from their struggle. He winced in pain, causing John to soften his approach and revert back to what he learned from his week working with kids in the pediatric department at Bart’s. “I’m sorry I was so rough with you, love, I’m just worried about you that’s all. I love you and when you don’t take care of yourself, it upsets me.” Acting as non-threatening as possible, he stood up and sat on the couch as far away from Sherlock, who was now rubbing his ear and looking at the ground.
“You-you pulled me out of that house, John. I would’ve been a goner-”
“Ahh,” he heard Sherlock gasp, but John wrapped his hand around the vampire’s sleeve and tugged him towards the cottage.
“That is for the best. I will have Devon prepare some food for you when you wake up. We will need to change your bandage tonight, as well.”
Jim looked up at the older boy, then at Irene, hopefully. The woman’s smile broadened. “I like him,” she said to Daniel. “Okay, John, we will return Jim to his Doms. We have no use for a Sub who wants to stay chained.”
“Umm, no, not yet,” John stuttered out, grabbing a hand full of soap and taking himself in hand. He held his breath, not wanting Sherlock to notice his rapid breathing as his climax neared. Moving his hand faster and faster, John replayed Sherlock’s words over and over again in his head. ‘You have no idea what would happen if you decided to give in to your instinct. Don’t you want to know, John? Don’t you want to just try it? To just give in?’
Chapter 6 – I’m Your Puppet
“Ahhh, early as I expected, you must be eager indeed John,” he chuckled.
John got more confident with kissing the older man so much that the hands that had been lying limp at his side decided to reach up and cradle Sherlock’s ribs. The heat radiating from the core to his palms was incredible, so while keeping one hand still, he moved the other up to the man’s chest to feel how fast his heart was beating. Sherlock broke their kiss with a smile, placing the hand that was by John’s head over to the small panting chest below him. The boy grinned because he knew his heart was beating just as fast Sherlock’s and once again, he was not alone in his excitement.
The problem was, John didn’t think he was okay, he thought he was dying.
“I am,” Sherlock said, easily pushing John away after pressing the plunger into his arm. The vampire landed with a loud thud as he tried to take the needle out of his bicep.
“No, you’re not dead.”
“Don’t reach back again,” Sherlock warned, but halted the spanking for the time being.
When he was done, John pulled away and licked his wrist. As John sat on the bed, waiting for Sherlock to change, his teeth drew back up and his eyes became blue again. He looked down at the man on the bed, seeing the dried blood around his mouth.
“I love you too,” John whispered over the water noise and he meant it too. His arse hurt yes, he was still pissed and hurt that Sherlock didn’t stop, but other than that he didn’t feel any different and it did feel nice to his over sensitive skin being held. “Ah,” he yelp when Sherlock slowly slid out, giving him a sympathetic smile.
“Oh God,” he squeezed his eyes together as he felt pressure and warmth envelope thousands of his most sensitive nerves. When Sherlock was fully seated, John felt the hollows of his pelvic bone hold and caress the man’s cheeks perfectly. Surprisingly, the tall fully grown man didn’t seem that heavy. “Sherlock,” he sounded breathless, he felt breathless too, as he was held so tightly and securely under someone who loved him.
It was a good night, Sherlock told himself as he opened up the door, only to find it was unlocked. Immediately, he pulled out his crossbow and aimed it inside his flat. With silent feet, he made his way inside to find his brother sitting with his legs crossed and a cup of tea in his hands. “Good evening, dear brother,” Mycroft said, taking a sip of his tea.
“Well he’s not going to be happy with you, Mr. Holmes the younger,” Jim lowered his tone even more, standing up and hunching his back to mock…well Sherlock didn’t really get the reference. “I don’t think he’s going to cover for you again, Sherlock. I’d be careful if I were you. You can’t have your cake and eat it to, darling,” he strutted over to the taller man, pulling out a piece of paper from the inner pocket of his suit jacket. “Here’s my new number, have fun with the toys in the bag. Call it my…John warming gift.” Jim smiled, hit Sherlock’s chest to slip the piece of paper into the robe pocket, and left the flat with a wink.
John planted a kiss on Sherlock’s head and nuzzled his temple lightly. He tried to fight the sleep, he really did, but with his sire so close, a full belly, and the soft purring noise John was emitting lulled Sherlock into a deep sleep. The pressure from the twine loosened and the next thing Sherlock felt was someone carrying him. By the time his head hit something soft, Sherlock was asleep and completely reliant on his sire and two humans for his protection.
“But you have to!” Sherlock shouted, his eyes crazy. “I need it!”
“I’m sorry,” John said, his voice almost a whisper.
“She was purchased and then freed. There is nothing more to say.” Mycroft actually turned up his nose, lifting his chin, to avoid eye contact with John.
Sherlock motioned for John to sit on the edge of the tub while he retrieved a white box full of medical supplies. “Hold your hand out,” again, strangely, not a command.
“Shhh,” Sherlock cooed behind him, petting through his hair and offering a piece of ham dipped in some sort of cranberry sauce. To John’s horror, after he took the pork in his mouth, Sherlock kept his fingers pressed against his tongue to encourage the Sub to lick off the sauce. As quickly as the questions of what to do and how to escape entered his mind, they were gone as John slowly licked the tart liquid from his Dom’s fingers. John gave a soft sigh as the digits were removed and his body, no his subconscious, seemed to drop marginally until he found his head falling back to rest on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Indeed,” Mycroft agreed quietly, staring at John with icy blue eyes. “John, the doctors said you are ready to be discharged. Here are some clothes I had Devon bring for you as the others were, well, unwearable.”
“Fine,” he said dismissively. The sooner he got the formalities out of the way, the sooner he could go back to John so they could start their life together in peace. “Do you have the papers?”
“Good boy,” the silver eyes smiled down at him, warming every part of his body from the inside out. “Now,” Sherlock’s tone became stern but John saw a hint of mischief in the man’s eyes as they looked down at him. “John, I think you owe me an apology for trying to hit me in the head with my own laptop…my own laptop!” he emphasized, and a wicked grin came over his face when he rolled off the teenager and fell onto his back.
“Shhh,” he chuckled darkly and took his fingers out. Thinking a moment of how he wanted him, Sherlock grabbed John’s shoulders and pulled him up so he was flush against his chest. Giving a few pumps with his hips and rubbing his cock along the curve of John’s ass, Sherlock lined himself up and pressed into John.
“I know, I know, but I need you to do something for me, okay? It’s very important. I want you to slow down your breathing, but make sure you keep inhaling and exhaling. Don’t stop, okay, just don’t stop breathing. Damn it, you morons, can’t you move any faster?” John heard Sherlock yell at someone, but by this time, he wasn’t even sure what was real. His head hurt so much but he had to keep breathing, he had to keep his eyes open and keep breathing, just like his Dom said.
“You took a nurse hostage, John, what did you expect would happen?”
Either way though, whether Sherlock took him hard or soft, John would come with him and then he would feel the anal plug being worked in to keep the man’s seed inside him. He didn’t like it at first, obviously having something shoved up your bum constantly was a problem when you wanted to sit down or go to the bathroom but Sherlock insisted upon it and sucked him off until he stopped complaining.
“John,” he moaned, realizing the breathlessness he felt was due to the teenager sprawled out over him. “I think you’re crushing my lungs,” he tried to laugh, tried to regain some form of stability and bring them both back to the here and now.
“You took a quick nap there for a moment, yeah? Are you feeling okay?” Sherlock asked, forcing John to pull himself a little bit closer back to the surface in order to answer the question. He reached up to rub the sleep from his eyes to realize one arm felt lethargic from his sleep while the other just felt heavy.
“Sherlock, wait-”
“What the fuck?” Was all the boy could say, rubbing his pruney hands through his now clean hair.
“Oh,” the boy sounded crushed, giving the older man ample time and opportunity to swoop in and pick up the pieces.
“I’m not mad, John,” he stroked over the boy’s blonde hair. “Here you go,” he whispered, breaking off a piece of scone and holding it up to the quivering lips. Where his mother had taken away, Sherlock would be there to give. He felt the soft lips brush against his fingers as John ate like a baby bird, giggling when the man acted like he was going to give it to him then threw it up into his own mouth. It was good to hear him laugh, much better than crying, Sherlock agreed to himself while the boy licked his fingers clean of crumbs. “Does your wrist or leg hurt?”
“I know, sweetheart,” Sherlock smiled kindly and helped John lay down. When John was in the prone position, Sherlock took off his own clothes, leaving him in only black pants. Then, he set out to disrobe John even more. The trousers were much easier than the shirt, which Sherlock was forever grateful for, as he didn’t want to cause John any more pain than absolutely necessary. Sherlock hooked his fingers on the waistband of John’s pants and gently tugged them down until they were completely off.
“What?!” John snapped, looking over to stare the man right in the eye. His deep blue eyes tried to pierce those silver orbs, tried to find what they hid in their depths, just like what Sherlock did to him.
With one swift move, Sherlock slid open the door and John leapt. The human landed on ground with John growling on top of him. His teeth had dropped, but his eyes now had a thin ring of blue circling his blown pupils. “You shouldn’t have come up here,” John purred, rubbing his face against the side of Sherlock’s. The warm smooth flesh made John buck his hips down into Sherlock’s.
“No way, Sherlock,” John said, knitting his brow. “I nearly killed you this time. I can’t take any more blood, at least not today.”
“No, not rubbish at all my dear John, beautiful,” Sherlock could feel is cock swell, whether from the new picture of his John or because he knew he had him.
After a minute, John felt the warmth slowly fading from his limbs and his ears were picking up something strange on the other side of the door.
“Is that so?” She asked, skeptical. For a moment, John’s heart rose in his chest.
“Good boy,” John said again, wiping his lips and putting Sherlock back in his pants. “Now finish up your meal before Greg gets here.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tears began to weld up in his eyes from disgust in himself.
The door closed and John let out a sigh of relief. He had to think of a way out of this, a way that didn’t end with him getting shot or Joann getting hurt. “Let me go,” the woman tried to assert her dominance over him, shoving out a weak wave of bliss. He felt bad for the girl, he really did, but John knew he wasn’t going to hurt her. However, he had to make it look like he was willing to do anything if they were going to take him seriously.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Leave me alone, Sherlock! I want to call Mycroft, he said I could call him whenever I wanted. Now get off of me!” John thrashed as Sherlock carried him up to their bed, easily controlling and dodging the swinging limbs. It might be best to call his brother but first, he wanted to see if being in their bed would calm the boy enough so Sherlock could work out the true origin of this outburst.
“Wow, did you really find a cure?” he heard Greg ask, but John didn’t understand, nor did he care what the Dom meant. John just wanted to listen and then discuss details. “John, can you hear me?”
Sherlock let a small smile fill his face for only a moment. He could just picture his John telling those rebels to ‘go fuck themselves.’ John didn’t back down, which was what Sherlock loved about him, but also made him fear for John’s life. Not everyone is as forgiving as Mycroft, and John was still too bullheaded to realize that.
“Because…because…it’s just not right!”
A slight growl emanated from the right corner of the room. Mycroft turned his focus there and saw a pale threatening figure standing in the shadows. “Leave,” the figure said.
Greg looked at his phone and hoped it wasn’t John, but that sick feeling gnawing at his stomach told him differently.
“What the hell kind of question is that? Of course I’m ready John, I’ve=” The doctor began slowly penetrating the tight hole with his finger, bringing a surprised yelp and then a deep moan from his lover. They had done this countless times and John knew just the right angle to make Sherlock writhe under him. All it took was a sharp gasp from the man, who was now starting to thrust his hips into the mattress below him, to know he had found Sherlock’s prostate.
would be the winner. He had watched how Sherlock had gone from calm and docile to panicked, angry, and belligerent at the drop of a hat. The same process repeated again and again as Sherlock cursed at the solicitors and officers who tried to question him but would answer all the questions when it came to telling them that he was the one who shot Moriarty, not John.
This was important to Sherlock, he could tell, and in his mind he knew it would be amazing to have the man wash him. There was still a little piece of self-consciousness and doubt in Sherlock that gave him pause, but when the man’s words of how much he loved him for his beauty and maturity, John made his decision.
“Excuse me, Sir, you made a wrong turn back there. I need to go to-”
“The metal dust under your fingernails and the salty stench in your hair when you first arrived here indicates you lived in the pipes for at least a couple of months now, possibly a year. Your older sister, Harry, is a Sub who you convinced to run away with you, which is why you feel responsible for her. Mike and Jim are both runaways you found, though you know little about either you protect them with your life. Your parents, nor those of the other Subs, know where you are and the fact that none of you, including Molly, show up with a missing person’s report I’m assuming they do not care. Thus, leaving you with nowhere to run and nowhere to hide,” Sherlock said in one breath, “not even in here,” the Dom released John’s hand and poked him in the forehead.
“Yeah, yeah okay, ummm, are you a…you know?”
John rolled his eyes. If the rumors were true, there was nothing that could stand in Mycroft’s way if he wanted something badly enough.
The next thing he knew, John was on solid ground, staring at Greg fussing over Mycroft. “Damn it John,” Sherlock said, pulling the Sub up into his arms. “You’re so stupid, so stupid,” he kept repeating as he rubbed his hands up and down John chest and stomach, trying to create warmth.
“I meant every word I ever said to you. Let me show you how much I care for you, how much I love you John. Please, let me make it up to you for being a stupid git, I misjudged how mature your were and I…well I was just so scared of losing you.” Sherlock brought the small tan hand up to his lips and kissed the soft knuckles, watching in pleasure at how the boy’s cheeks turned pink.
“Thank you Gregory, I do not need to be mothered,” Mycroft said.
“Sh’lock…”Mycroft rasped, trying to sit up. Both Greg and John put a hand on the man’s chest, pushing him gently back down to the couch.
IMPORTANT PLEASE READ
“So?”
“I’m glad you’re okay,” he said, not opening his eyes to see the look on Sherlock’s face. He couldn’t say what his entire body and soul was telling him to reveal. John didn’t know if he could handle Sherlock rejecting him, as a Dom, or as a person who cared for him.
He sobered quickly though as Irene’s stern gaze fell upon him. “Sorry,” he apologized, though he still thought himself a cool secret agent.
“I see. So what happened when you went into the flat?”
John could feel his cock pressed up against the man’s warm thigh and in turn he could feel Sherlock’s pressed up against his stomach. He tried not to focus on the size difference, knowing his doctor had told him he would get longer in the next year, but still it was proof of his stupid youth. Sherlock finally pulled away, holding him out at arm’s length, gazing at his smaller body like he wanted to devour him. Those eyes both terrified the boy and made his cock twitch a bit towards the owner of said eyes. “May I wash you?” How could he say no, however, the words wouldn’t come out so he just nodded meekly.
and began slowing his ministrations, lying like a rag doll on the bed. When the man saw the effect he had on his sensitive boy, he shot off harder than he’d ever done before, a loud shout coming from his throat. They both lie motionless together on their respective surfaces, laughing with each other like lovers would in their post orgasmic bliss. “Are you okay?”
“Whatever,” John mumbled in between bites of the heavenly meal. “I didn’t know you had a girlfriend,” John smiled, changing the subject. He wondered if this Anthea was the subordinate Irene had mentioned.
John bit his lip, wanting to push the subject of whether or not he could use his own bliss, but deciding it could wait. With Sherlock’s unnecessary assistance, John stood up and placed his crutch under his arm. When he tried to jerk away from the long fingers holding his hips, John almost fell over and bumped his ankle against the coffee table. He hissed and squeezed his eyes together, but all he got was a ‘why can’t you just behave,’ look from Mycroft.
“Do you love him, John?” Greg asked, furrowing his brown in way that made John feel pitied. He hated it, not only because there was no reason for him to be pitied but also
“Well I-” John started, but was cut off by Mycroft holding up a newspaper.
“Yes, yes, fine,” Sherlock dismissed him, lying back down on the couch and propping his fingers under his chin to begin planning his attack. If he timed everything perfectly, it would take exactly five years for him to expose the network, never giving the detective a moment to rest and think about his John. It would be like a in a cryogenic chamber of sorts, sustaining his mind on ice until he was back to what really mattered. Then, he would go straight from the high of tracking into the beautiful bliss of John’s arms. It was perfect.
“Ay, ay, Captain Watson,” Harry laughed and both her and Mike mock saluted him. John only rolled his eyes but smiled nonetheless as they began walking towards the house.
“Hmm,” the answer rumbled through his cheek.
The teen sighed and braced his hands on the counter.
He played with the crumbs on his plate for a moment, trying to form the question in his mind. She already knew he didn’t care much for girls but they had never talked about boyfriends or any sex other than with a girl because she didn’t want him ‘knocking someone up’ as she so gracefully put it. “Well, there’s this guy that I like, really like, and it’s kind of freaking me out because all I can think about is him and nothing else. Is that bad?” The words just spewed out of the teen’s mouth before they could even pass through a filter.
“Of course,” Sherlock said, tapping his finger to his lips. “They have no use for a Sub cured of their RDD.”
Chapter 8 – So He Won’t Break
Sherlock's POV before and during their time at the crime scene.
John took a moment before he answered, remembering how he had already threatened Sherlock, accused him of horrible things, and insulted him by trying to call his stupid mum. That man had been more patient than anyone he’d ever met and he’d even pointed a gun at him. So no, John decided right then and there he would stop acting childish and ungrateful to the man who had called him an angel. Hell, how can you be pissed at someone who holds you and hand feeds you scones after you threaten to shoot them and breakdown like a little baby? “Yes, much better. My arm still hurts a bit but I’m okay,” he whispered, craning his neck to try and see who Sherlock was texting.
“Fuck,” Greg shouted. “What the bloody fuck did you do, vampire?!” The human stood up, his tranquilizer gun in hand and pointed directly at Sherlock’s sire. Greg looked a bit unsteady, but Sherlock could smell the adrenaline pouring off the man in waves.
John’s hand really hurt but, he supposed, that was rather the point of shoving it through the wall. The constant throbbing grounded him, made his senses more acute and his mind more aware of what was going on around him. However, the warm hand at the middle of his back, guiding him downstairs, seemed to test every ounce of will John had not to sigh and go to his knees in submission. It was his nature, he told himself, and those fucking Holmes’ were taking advantage of it just like every other Dom he’d met.
“I’m sorry,” John apologized, but he didn’t really know why.
With a loud yelp, John arched his back, presenting Sherlock with a better angle for deeper penetration. Sherlock rubbed his hand up and down John’s back slowly, encouraging the moans as he entered a third finger. “Sherlock, please,” John begged him, his boy falling right into a lustful headspace.
Chapter 13 – Apologize
When Sherlock bent the boy’s front down slightly, thrusting in deeper, John felt the cock hit his prostate repentantly. “Come on, show me you love me John, show me,” Sherlock was thrusting so fast, the teen could have sworn his spine would snap in half at any moment. But soon, the combination of the wanking, continued stimulation to his prostate, and the dulling burn inside him, John shouted as he came all over the wall. He panted, watching his white come and pink water wash down towards the drain.
Thanks again to everyone who has either commented or left kudos. They really make my day. Also, I apologize for the evil cliffhanger in advance :(
“How are you? I hope you didn’t have to wait too long, John?” Sherlock started right in on mild conversation, making sure to act completely calm, indicating that he thought everything was fine.
Bliss exploded through his veins like a nuclear bomb. It blinded him for a moment as heat permeated throughout his skin and deep into the marrow of his bones. It felt amazing. It felt like defeat.
Then, the thought dawned on him, realizing Sherlock was still trying to show how worthwhile he was to him. As John was about to profess his acceptance of both himself and the way Sherlock felt about him, a voice shouted from downstairs.
Angry, Sherlock thrust his whole middle finger into the tight hole, eliciting a breathy whimper from the boy. He moved his finger in and out rapidly, scrunching his face in frustration. It wasn’t working like it was supposed to, but he knew what would. If it wouldn’t be given to him, the darkness thought, then it would be taken.
“No, but-”
It was much harder than he’d expected, manipulating John’s emotions when the situation absolutely called for it, such as getting him away from his mother and Mary, but right now Sherlock wasn’t 100 percent sure this was necessary. All it might have taken was for John to see his erection and let the blocks tumble as his own mind did the work for the Detective. This was his job though, Sherlock told himself, so he took a deep breath of the blonde’s hair and steeled himself for the time being.
Okay, so this is it guys. Sherlock's POV of his first sexual encounter with John. It is not as bad as I originally thought it was going to be, but by the end it is gets pretty intense. So please, PLEASE, look at the updated tags and know that this is dub-con verging on rape because John is a minor and unsure. If you are easily triggered by these things, DO NOT READ. I do not wish to upset or trigger somebody inadvertently, so just be aware of what you are getting into.
After a few moments of just staring at how beautiful the creature he had tamed was, Sherlock dismounted and laid his long body alongside John’s.  He rolled over on his side and placed a possessive hand on John’s stomach.
“That is because you and the rest of those morons who call themselves ‘scientists’ are around Subs who already behave like mindless robots because that’s how they were raised before they even get to you. Your facts are based off of Subs brainwashed by propaganda, educational films, and decades of one sided data, Mycroft, I’ve told you this countless of times and now you have proof sitting before you,” Sherlock finished his speech, which left John even more confused as to who these people were and why he was sitting in their kitchen.
Mycroft sighed, defeated by Sherlock’s logic and his own beliefs of what was best for the child. Although he did not agree with his younger brother’s methods of obtaining John, that much was obvious, there was no denying when looking at the situation objectively that Sherlock would be able give John a better life. He knew how the detective worked, he had seen it all his life, and the look on his little brother’s face told him he would protect John until his dying breath. “Yes, where is he?”
“Please pullout it hurts,” John tried to move his hand, but when they were held fast he tried to buck against the man to get him off, but only succeeded in causing more pain to his hyperextended ring of muscle.
“You…you son of a bitch,” John whispered, looking at Sherlock, wide eyed. “You’ve been domming me all this time! Making me think what I was doing was actually…oh my God, I turned Harry and Mike over to you guys. I thought…”
When they were both clean, dry, and dressed in baggy pajama clothes, well Sherlock was fully dressed but he always insisted John was too gorgeous to be covered up so only gave him pants he’d bought for him, which were similar to the ones John had bought at the sports store so many years…
“Most likely,” Sherlock said, drinking his juice. “But, I’ll make sure he can’t get to you.”
John knew the Doms had heard the bang he created with his fist meeting, and punching through, the wall when the arguing stopped. His hand was bright red, a few lacerations at the apex of his middle two knuckles, tears were starting to fall at their own accord, and there was a giant hole in the bedroom wall.
His new plan was already set up perfectly in his head as Sherlock jumped out of the tub, dried off quickly and threw on a pair of black trousers and button up. He combed his hair, brushed his teeth, placed his mobile in his pocket, and picked up a black bag full of surveillance equipment he had nicked off the yard, heading to find a cab to take him to Southampton.
“But I’m so bored! These nurses are conspiring to kill me with their ignorance and stupidity.”
“Who?” John asked, taking a large whiff to scent the perimeter. Before Greg could answer, the vampire realized exactly ‘who’ was coming.
“I picked out clothes for you, here,” he held out a blue striped shirt and khaki trousers.
“As long as you wash your hands before you start cooking. The tomato soup smelled like formaldehyde yesterday,” John laughed then squealed when Sherlock abruptly picked him up and walked him over to the sofa. When he set the boy down, he bent forward taking John into a deep dominating kiss until the teen sat breathless.
It felt good, it felt right to have his arms tied behind his back so he didn’t have to worry about doing anything. It felt right to have his face pressed up against his Dom. It just felt right. With a smile on his face, John closed his eyes and breathed in clean scent of Sherlock’s clothes.
“Stay with me,” Sherlock said, wrapping his arm around John’s tired body. It wasn’t a question, but John’s response almost made him grow hard again.
Well, there it is...I hope you enjoyed and the next chapter will be parallel to this one but from Sherlock's POV. So it will be the same scene and dialog, however, Sherlock hears some things that aren't necessarily accurate and you'll find out a little more about his plans for his John.
It was hard going down the stairs, especially when they cracked and creaked with every move. He finally made it to the bottom though, and limped through the front door. Throwing Sherlock’s body onto the snowy grass, John lowered himself to his knees and hovered over Sherlock. He patted the man’s cheek. “Come on, Sherlock. Wake up now, we’re safe.”
“No, no, I didn’t mean that, it’s just that you’ve never done anything with a guy before have you? No, so it’s kind of hard to explain to someone who is inexperienced.”
“No Sir, he’s still at level one, but the case Dom’s last report thinks he’s getting closer,” she answered, checking the information on her computer.
“Thanks, John. The pints on the house.”
He didn’t realize how hard he was digging his fingers into John’s chest until the most horrible noise filled the room. The boy shrieked in pain and Sherlock could feel something kicking and clawing at his arms and legs, and it wasn’t John. His skin was ripping apart and something underneath was coming out, something dark and horrible that always waited patiently just under the surface. “Sherlock, you’re hurting me,” he heard John cry, giving him the strength to push the black tar back inside before it reached for the small throat. “I love you Sherlock, please stop it, you’re scaring me!”
“I wanted to,” John told him, standing up and running upstairs.
The boy had never even thought about being washed by another person before. It was a shower, you got in, you got out, that was it but knowing how gentle Sherlock’s hands would be with washing his body sent chills through him and down to his spent groin. “No, I mean, yeah, I mean, sure I would like that.”
“I’m okay, John,” Molly said, sounding years older than her small body should’ve allowed. “I like Greg, he’s nice to me. But I miss you and J-“
“You were having a horrible nightmare early this morning and when I woke you up you were already in a panicked state. I tried to calm you down but I imagine that dream was a pretty nasty one because you tried to crush my bullocks and then ran out of the room.” Sherlock wiped his thumb over a few tears, smiling when he could see the apology wanting to escape the trembling lips. “It’s okay, you were just scared, you didn’t hurt me,” he assured the boy even though his groin still ached like a bastard. “I’m afraid you hurt yourself quite traumatically though, sweetheart. In your panic you fell down the stairs, oh God John I was so worried when you tripped.”
The detective had never been this panicked or confused before in his entire life and that scared the living piss out of him, causing his mind to wage an all-out nuclear war within the lobes and cortexes. The calm and beautiful John he depended on was no longer in his own sanity to sign the peace treaties and calm the waves in his mind.
Poor John. Poor Mycroft's hand. Damn Sherlock.
He caressed John’s cheek, watching as the boy stirred slightly, then snuggled deeper into the pillow. This boy was his, and he would do anything to keep him safe, even if it meant protecting him from himself.
“John, you must realize that this is going to help you. If you misbehave in front of all those people, I will be forced to punish you. This way,” he motioned to the brown leather hanging from Sherlock’s hands, “we won’t have to worry about that.”
“It’s alright, you’re alright,” Sherlock kept repeating, though John thought it might have been more to himself then to the teen. “The bleeding’s not stopping. We need to get him down to medical, and fast.”
“You-you’re the only reason I’m okay,” he moaned, feeling a third finger, knowing this morning was going to be one of the gently ones, as Sherlock put his hands under John’s armpits and turned him around so the boy was straddling his hips. That beautiful blue fog entered his mind, ensuring everything was okay and safe while he was in his lover’s arms.
I hope you enjoy and I would love to hear your comments on the latest update!
“Can you have Jim taken down to medical? Tell them we have a generation two on our hands.”
“What is it?” another familiar voice asked. Jim appeared from a blue tent, his face slightly more gaunt than John remembered. “John!” he shouted and ran up to give him a hug. The younger boy was bony and chilled, but his actions didn’t seem to match his appearance. “They let you go? I told you that note would work, didn’t I Mike?”
“Well?” Mycroft asked, though John could tell they all already knew the answer.
He briefly thought about coming on the boy to let John see just how far he’d gone, but when he heard the front door open, Sherlock closed his eyes and waited. He held his breath and forced back a smile when he heard John at the door. The small inhale of breath from John’s lush lips caused blood to rush to Sherlock’s flaccid cock. The small form below him, unaware of everything going on, continued to sleep while John assumed the worst.
“Watch your tone, boy,” Mycroft told him, narrowing his eyes. John subconsciously moved sideways, farther into Sherlock’s side.
With that, Sherlock hung up, placing his phone in his pocket and turning his attention to his microscope. He grabbed a small piece of plastic and used a pipette to drop some of John’s blood onto it. With the blood in place, Sherlock set it under the scope and ginned at what he saw.
“I think the sight is extremely painful, though that was not the purpose of my questioning,” Sherlock said as they walked into the hallway.
“We will go back to the estate, regroup, and then act, Sherlock. We cannot go off halfcocked in this situation.”
Patience and control equals pleasure. Sherlock could play along, play by the vampire who played doctor and tried to blend in with the humans rules. He had always wondered what it would be like to become like the animals that he killed. Now that he was one, Sherlock realized what vampires truly were; the apex predator. He could see things now, hear things, that showed him exactly how he needed to strike in order to conquer his prey.
“Be sure that you do brother. I do not need to remind you what will happen if he lashes out while on stage.”
Out of nowhere, John reached out and grabbed the collar of Sherlock’s shirt. “Maybe I should just kill you. Save us both a lot of trouble, eh?”
It turned out that something he could hit Greg with, was a car. It came out of the blue, but Greg felt the impact immediately when a black SUV hit his passenger side head on, and caused him to smash his head against the window.
John looked at the bite mark as it closed up, his eyes in a daze. “This can’t happen again, Sherlock. I could have-”
“Yes, sure, sure, we’re leaving now. You need to be quiet, Molly,” John said, picking the girl up in his arms and pressing her face into his chest so she wouldn’t alert anyone to their presence.
“Fuck,” John cursed when he was picked up slightly and floated back down onto the cock from both gravity and the firm pressure on his hips.
“Money is not everything, Mr. Holmes,” Greg spat, not aware that he had already placed his foot in the trap.
“That sounds great,” John said with a smile.
“Of course it’s not your fault, Gregory,” Mycroft sighed. “My brother has been this way for a very long time. I’m afraid even if you would have told me sooner, the results would have been the same. I will take care of this. He is still my brother.”
“John, I’m going to-I’m going to,” Sherlock whined, so John wrapped his hand around the base and continued jerking rapidly, while keeping his mouth and tongue over the head to stimulate and swallow his release. After a few strokes, Sherlock was coming into the hot moist heat with a grunt, suspending his hips off the bed. Although John didn’t particularly like the taste of the bitter liquid in his mouth, he always swallowed it because it was the result of the pleasure he had just given his husband. Sherlock always did the same to him, but, would add commentary about how the flavor changed based on what John had eaten that day.
The thought was brief, although John filed it away for later when he wasn’t being threatened with electric shock. “Come.”
“Do not tell me my business, vampire,” Mycroft said, angry that he let John frazzle him.
“That’s not good enough!” Sherlock shouted, slamming his hand down on the seat cushion.
He reluctantly let her go and gave Greg a look a father would give to a boyfriend.
A quick smile came to Sherlock’s face, but it disappeared just as quickly. “Yes, that does sound like our John.”
“I just don’t like things in my ear. It’s like…I just don’t like it,” a shiver ran through the man.
There was a long moment of silence and John could sense all eyes on him, but that didn’t matter now. His Dom was hurt and John was supposed to help fix it.
“On a lead?! There is no fucking-”
”Me,” he whispered.
“You really think that will work?” Mike asked, licking his palms to get the last of his breakfast in his stomach. “What if we all get caught, John, those guys seem like they knew we were coming in the first place. This time it’s pretty obvious we’re going to be coming now that we have a reason.”
Sherlock sighed, gaining a tighter grip on John’s good hip as he added the new information Donovan had just texted him.
John narrowed his eyes. Of course he was hungry, he was almost always hungry, but that didn’t mean he was going to bite this guy just for some experiment. “I’m fine,” John said, keeping his eyes on the table full of needles and vials.
Chapter 10 – Unintended
The audience chuckled at John’s response and Mycroft patted the boy’s knee.
None to gracefully, the student grabbed his stuff, carrying it in front of him to cover his arousal and ran into the bathroom panting and sweating.
“He’s in room 237, just down that hall.” She pointed down the adjacent hallway. “You need me to walk you down there?”
John's POV directly after chapter four.
“What?” John groaned, not even looking at Sherlock. Yes, John was fading quickly, and it would only be a matter of time before he took the plunge and bit Sherlock. Sherlock couldn’t wait to be bitten. He had so many ideas of what it might feel like, what he would see, hear. It was an unopened door, and Sherlock was about to take a battering ram to the barrier.
Without hesitation, Greg spoke up. “I can help,” he said, his voice confident and unwavering. John smiled, but inside he knew the risks of what the hunter was proposing. If he couldn’t control Sherlock, if the young vampire went into a frenzy, John wouldn’t be able to stop him.
“Open up for me, John, my beautiful John. I need in, let me in,” Sherlock finally got all three fingers into the squirming boy. John barley heard the words in his ears but was confused when Sherlock said ‘I need in.’ He shrugged it off though when he felt the pleasure shoot through him again when one of the fingers hit that beautiful prostate. This time however, it only dampened the pain he felt, but the boy took deep breathes accepting that this was sex and what he was supposed to be feeling.
“Greg said, if I do well at the conference and all my levels are good, he’ll take me in so I can be with Molly. Isn’t that great?!”
Sherlock lifted his hand to cover John’s, which lay motionless on his cheekbone. “If-if you want to leave me too…I-I’ll understand, John. I just want you to be happy,” he whispered, having no intention of letting the boy go but he knew given the choice, John would never leave, not now.
I hope you enjoy the chapter!
Mycroft surprised him though. “John is a strong boy. He can handle himself until we find him.”
and Sherlock made his way to the spare room to grab the extra towel he had prepared for this evening. Once he located the materials they would need, he listened for John to turn on the tap and get in. It was obvious the teen was self-conscious and it wouldn’t do to scare him from taking off his clothes and getting into the shower. Yes, it would be much easier for now to let John undress in private and wait until he is caged in the shower waiting for Sherlock to come and take him. The detective calmed his mind with the promise there would be plenty of time for examining the gorgeous young body later.
“I mean, we need to get a base reading again before you start shocking him. Who knows what kind of affect the trauma had on his receptor.” Sherlock said, moving his hands up to cup under John’s arms. The Sub was lifted up from his kneeling position to quickly, causing John to sway slightly until Sherlock grabbed ahold of him.
“It’s alright,” John said, putting one hand around Sherlock’s neck while the other pinned both the vampire’s arms to his side. “Remember, Sherlock, patience,” he whispered seductively, licking a strip up the young vampire’s neck.
When he looked at John splayed out on Sherlock’s chest, he saw that teddy bear so long ago being suffocated by his brother’s relentless hold. Mycroft knew events were unpredictable, even more so when dealing with Sherlock, so he took it upon himself to give John a steady platform to jump onto if things went south. “I will leave my number in your mobile in case you ever need to get in touch with me, yes? Sherlock, walk me out,” he said, nodding once to the boy and leaving him to his fate.
Also, I started a new job on Friday, but I'm going to do my best to stick with the schedule of updating every Sunday. The chapters might become a tad shorter, though. But who knows, maybe I'll become a speed writer and a 9-5 won't effect my stories at all! Fingers crossed!
“I know you won’t, my sweet brave boy,” Sherlock praised and pulled the boy in closer, cherishing his victory of John’s heart, mind, and no to mention Moriarty’s challenge. Sherlock had won.
John, who sat in the kitchen with a cup of tea and an old copy of ‘Oliver Twist,’ was attempting to condition Sherlock like a dog. And Sherlock, who might be a blood sucking vampire, was not a mindless dog. Every meal time John would bring out a bag of blood and let Sherlock drink half. Usually, Sherlock would hand it back, but sometimes the young vampire would try to drink it all before John could grab it away from him. John would hiss and Sherlock would relent, feeling an odd twinge on his neck where his sire had bitten him.
It had been a month, a month since he’d shot Moriarty, a month since he’d seen Sherlock or Mycroft or Baker Street, a month had passed and now he would find out his lover’s fate. It was Greg who called and his mother who answered but by her gleeful reaction, John saw a large chunk fall off, his head thumped and rolled to the ground, lifeless and alone. “Only ten years?... Detective Inspector, you know that God awful man should get at least thirty…. No, I don’t care who he’s related to or how many connections he has, do you know what he’s done to my family? Reports outside every day, do you even know what kind of appearances we have to keep up?...Yes, well, we’ll see about that…No, no, I’ll tell him. Yes, thank you Inspector, bye bye now.”
Well, You Said you Didn’t Want it in Your Ears
“One step at a time, Sherlock,” he told himself, knowing that in time, John would come to him and beg for his blood. Sherlock knew what drugs did to people, and he knew his blood was a drug to John. So yes, there was no doubt in the hunter’s mind that John would be chomping at the bit when Sherlock came around.
Moving faster than any human alive, key word…alive, John kneeled down on the bed next to the thrashing vampire. He put his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders and pulled him onto his side. Pressing himself close to Sherlock’s body, John pressed his lips to curly matted hair and wrapped his arms around a pale bony chest.
He didn’t know if it was the friction Sherlock was creating or the conviction with which the man whispered those praises into John’s ear, but the boy’s hips stuttered and then stilled as he came in his jeans. Without thinking he tried to push away from Sherlock, horrified at his lack of control. “Oh my God, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to-“the boy spat out, but couldn’t get up with two large hands on his shoulders. Sherlock’s smile was kind and hungry and went in for a deep kiss that confused and shocked the teenager.
“Because your master, killed my master,” his voice turned dark at the mention of ‘masters.’
“Sorry,” John apologized before he could stop the words from coming out of his mouth. John realized he had been doing that a lot lately, but had no idea why he was losing control of his words and actions. He had been lowering his head, saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you,’ or ‘sorry’ way too much.
Sherlock’s eyes grew wide and then he smiled even wider than before. “You did it,” he said, sitting up and crossing his arms over his chest.
They were face to face now, John hovering over Sherlock, who now matched his husband’s grin, knowing exactly where this was going. “If I can get your body hotter however, the capsule should melt in no time at all,” he licked over the detective’s lips and then began heading south again.  “How do you think we can raise your body’s temperature?” He smiled, rubbing his lips lightly over the hard cock against the detective’s belly.
It was the environment, Sherlock told himself, this chat room that provided a ground to observe, deduce, and experiment until he got want he wanted, that was what made the darkness seep through.
“I have a present for you down stairs and after a little nap I’ll bring it up so you can see. How does that sound?”
“Don’t put yourself through too much, Mycroft. It might have been a through and through, but you were still shot.”
“I would open you up so slowly and make you beg for me. I would hold you tight and kiss you until you fell asleep in my arms. I want to taste your cock and your come in my mouth, oh I wish I could see how hard you are now for me John.” The man moaned, causing John to almost lose control.
“Erm, thanks,” John murmured, a blush staining his cheeks pink.
“I’m not,” he wasn’t overtly laughing, but on the inside…well, on the inside he was rolling on the floor with a bright red face laughing.
“Y-Yes, sir,” John said, not meeting the old man’s gaze. His body was a giant bundle of nerves, making his entire body shake
“Definitely! Thank for being cool Sherlock, with me being a…you know.  Well, good night ‘old man,’” the boy joked, not realizing that the young man he thought was a college student was actually a thirty-three year old adult.
This chapter is un-beta'd so please forgive the mistakes :)
“What?” John asked, feeling uncomfortable. He put his hand down to cover himself, feeling too exposed.
“John, I believe we have some things to discuss,” Mycroft said, no doubt talking about Greg. Sherlock knew his brother had a tap on John’s phone, though he didn’t know if there was one on the former DI’s.
“I’ll have my men come pick him up. I take it your half-baked plan did not turn out to your liking, brother dear,” Mycroft’s tone seemed a little too pleased for Sherlock’s liking.
“I’m sorry, I just-“
“Uhhh, yeah, it’s nice,” John said turning his back to the door, ensuring that the first thing Sherlock wouldn’t see was his much smaller package. He didn’t care too much for having his arse being the first thing either, but it was much better than his cock and bullocks. His heart stopped when he heard the door behind him open, then two splashes as he stepped in and shut the door.
“Are you okay, John?” Sherlock asked as he stepped out of the car. John hadn’t even noticed they arrived. He nodded, smiling to reassure him, and then stepped out of the car to see tons of police officers and caution tape spread around a building. “Stay close to me, okay,” he was told and obeyed without thinking, his mind setting to default in an intense situation.
Mycroft focused his complete attention on John’s movements, his eyes, the twitch in his fingers, everything as to not make the wrong decision, the most important decision of his life possibly. He could obviously put the two back together but he wouldn’t make the same mistake twice, unlike Sherlock, he was not insane. If John was able to realize how important it was to stand on his own and not become dependent on Sherlock and Mycroft had a nice long conversation with his brother of the same, then perhaps it would be best to let his brother be happy.
John sat down and surprisingly, Sherlock sat down next to him, while the other Doms sat on the couch opposite them. “How is your neck feeling, John?” Greg asked first, a look of concern on his face.
“Well when your neck is butchered it’s-“ John started but was cut off by a very angry glare from Mycroft.
“You really want to stay a contracted Liberator for the rest of your life? Honestly Sherlock, what would Mummy say?”
“Oh,” John said, surprised. He hadn’t seen any men come take the boy, but then again he wasn’t in a position to be aware of his surroundings. “Good, that’s good. Damn it,” he looked down at his body and reached back to feel his sore behind, “I can’t go out like this.”
He sat on his couch, his knees pulled up to his chest, shivering as his body metabolized the drugs. Sweat made his forehead shine and his palms slippery as he wringed them together. Sherlock needed John, needed the man to drink from him while they…
“Yes, yes, you do,” Mycroft told him. “It is important for you to appear as any bought Sub would.”
John sighed dramatically, rolling his eyes at the smirk Sherlock gave him. “I meant, do you mind giving me some privacy?”
“I promise.”
“What is on your shirt?” Greg asked, reaching out to touch the drying white liquid. “Is that…oh my God!” he shouted, rubbing his finger back on Sherlock when he realized he had someone’s come on his finger.
“What?!” John shouted, sitting up in his reclined hospital bed.
I hope you enjoy the update!
“Loyalty? To you?” John asked, confused.
John lowered himself down to a squat, and quietly made his way over to the door. He placed the side of his face against the wood and was pleasantly surprised when he could faintly hear people talking.
“Where is it now? What did you do with it?”
“Oh…okay,” was all John could get out as the blood in his brain rushed to tend to the stirring in his lower body.
Nobody noticed or nobody cared as he walked with bloody tar covered hands into 221 Baker Street. As he entered their flat, a shrill scream echoed through his ears attempting to crack the barriers he had to put up when he killed those useless guards. “SHERLOCK!” Sherlock ran up the stairs as fast as he could to see Jim in nothing but a white undershirt and jeans, hovering over John. The boy thrashed and kicked, his eyes bubbling over with tears but his screams were cut off by a slicked hand over his mouth.
Sherlock removed his teeth, looking questioningly up at his sire. At first, he was confused, but soon he realized the human standing next to John, his own brother, was the problem here. Mycroft must have threatened John in some way to get Sherlock to stop. Well Sherlock could make him stop!
John fisted the hem of his shirt, darting his eyes back and forth between Mycroft and Sherlock. He didn’t want to do this, but also really, really didn’t want to be shocked again. There was no way out of this mess and now it was time to pay the piper
Hello again!
Greg wanted to jump from his bed and strangle the man who seemed abnormally calm. He hated Mycroft; he had ruined his life and shown him the worst parts of himself. Now, he was lying in a bed, hooked up to wires, and he couldn’t get away from him even if he wanted to. “Why?” Was all he could ask, his voice raspy and broken.
A familiar knock at the front door had Sherlock handing John his crutch, and walking out the door. “Ah, much better,” Mycroft said on his way to the door, sniffing at John slightly. “Now you can be around other people without offending them.”
“They wanted to take mine, but John stopped them.” Jim stroked the metal collar around his neck, making sure it was still there and nobody had actually taken it.
“That’s not why he did it, Sherlock,” Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose, frustration, concern, and uncertainty broadcasted from his movements. “Do you not even realize how much your tampering with his mind affected the poor boy? John thinks you are in jail and he actually blames himself. Now tell me, Sherlock, use that brilliant brain of yours and deduce what kind of mind set someone has to have to think like that? To blame themselves even when it is blatantly obvious they had nothing to do with the outcome? My God, Sherlock, look at the evidence of what you’ve done,” Mycroft shook his head, a shocked smile on his face that meant John’s actions had even awed him.
