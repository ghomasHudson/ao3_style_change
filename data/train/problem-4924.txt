“Steve, you know I love you, but you’re practically married to your job. It’s not healthy. And yes,” she added when he opened his mouth, “I know that what you’re doing is important, but it’s time for you to get a life,” there was amusement it her eyes. “And it sounds like you really care about this guy. So just go for it.”
Natasha grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around so that he was facing the bar. It didn't really help because there was a mirror behind the bar (of course there was...) and Steve could still see Tony's easy smile directed at the other man. “Okay, you really need to stop with the glaring, people will notice,” Natasha told him, her voice stern but sympathetic.
“Tony, your suit was down. You would have only been a liability on the field,” Cap tried to reason with him but it only made it worse.
An EPM arrow. Tony had installed special sensors to pick up on anything that could damage or shut down his suit, so that he would always be able to block it. This time however Tony was carrying a freaking car and was just able to throw it as far away from civilians as possible but had no time to block the arrow so it hit him straight in the chest (well, close. Tony did managed to shift in a way so it wouldn't be a direct hit to the arc reactor).
Which was why, after a while, he slid closer to Tony and said, “The view here isn’t anything special. Would you rather see the one from my bedroom?”
“Steve,” Tony started, as if he couldn't help himself, trying to find another way as to why this was not a good idea. “Are you sure you want this?”
He hoped everything would go smoothly for once, but no such luck. It was only after a couple of minutes that he heard Clint say, “Cap, we’ve got a problem.”
After making sure everyone was okay and uninjured, Steve sat down in the corner and pulled up data from the fight that Bruce had put together.
“Well if you think of something else to call them...” his sentence was left unfinished as the sound of more fighting came through.
After what felt like forever but was definitely not enough, they both parted to breathe. Steve could feel Tony's breath against his mouth and see his dilated pupils just inches from his own and he never wanted to let this moment go.
“Fine,” Tony said with all the calm he could muster then stood up and left the room before anyone could stop him.
Steve was about to protest but Tony’s moan at the first sip of his coffee made his brain short-circuit.
The movie was nearing its end, when Tony feel asleep. He liked to comment on the movie, little sarcastic comments or pointing out the inaccuracies. But he was silent then, and Steve closed his eyes as well, unwilling to move.
The thing was… Tony trusted him. Since the beginning, he was nothing but open with Steve. And for some bizarre reason, Steve wanted to confide in Tony. If he couldn’t tell him he was the Captain, at least he could tell him this. This story that used to control Steve’s life, and is still influencing his decisions. This story that’s the reason for everything that’s going on in his life.
Which wasn't like him at all. He was always happy and supportive of his friends when they found someone.
“Because I love you, dammit!” Steve said, and the word love wasn't even hard to say. It was as easy saying it, as it was hearing it from Natasha.
Tony shook his head. “I haven't seen anything like it either. But...” he walked to where the bomb seemed to be fused with the wall, numbers displaying 4 more minutes until detonation.
And on one hand, he was so much more in love with him, knowing Tony went out there, fighting the same battles Steve did.
He looked up at Tony, and he could almost feel his heart skip a beat at the look on his face. Steve put his hand down, but Tony didn’t stop looking at his mouth, eyes dark, mouth slightly open. The look made Steve dizzy more than the whole bottle of bourbon would have.
It did not help. A thought crossed his mind that he could go to the gym, work some of the frustration out, as he so often had in the past. But the battle left his muscles sore and numb, and he was in no state to exhaust himself even further. So instead he went to the common living room, comforting and warm and full of life. Except the battle has left everyone tired and only Natasha was curled up on the couch, hot mug in hand.
Steve just nodded and watched a little helplessly as Stark sat down across from him, casually, as if they were old friends meeting up for coffee.
And then there was a click. And the ropes fell on the floor and Tony’s hands were in front of him. And on one of them there was a gauntlet. Steve knew that design, those colors. He knew them very well. Tony was wearing an Iron Man gauntlet.
Steve opened his mouth to retort but before he could Iron Man disconnected the video feed and left them with a blank screen.
He’s been here often enough, though, that no one even gave him a second glance anymore. It was a problem at the beginning, people being outraged at a civilian walking down some of the most classified hallways in the world. But having friends at high places had its perks.
Sure, Stark seemed like he would be one of the worst ones. But Steve knew how much the media could warp the stories, tell things in a way that would insure them the most amount of views. It was more than once that some news site portrayed Steve’s organization as criminals, going after the rich because they wanted the power to themselves, not because the rich in question were corrupted.
Steve almost stopped breathing. It seemed impossible, him in the lobby of Stark Tower. Looking at a picture he painted, right there on the display, for all to see.
After a couple of moments of staring at the place where she disappeared, Natasha cleared her throat. “So, how exactly are you going to prove Tony’s innocent?”
It was only when the pressure eased, and the guy slid from Steve's grasp, that Steve realized he was shot in the head by Tony's repulsor gauntlet.
The thing was... nobody was supposed to know about their arrival. It was top secret and everyone involved in welcoming them worked for the Japanese government and were thereby sworn to secrecy.
But Steve knew him well enough to recognize when Tony was hiding behind his public persona. He was always impressed with Tony’s ability to turn on the charm when the situation called for it.
Steve and Tony looked at each other. Steve felt amazed that even with the faceplate he could tell what Tony was thinking. He nodded.
“Let me put this in a way that you understand Stark. Either you agree to my terms or you don't go at all,” Fury said in his best I'm-completely-serious-and-you-have-to-listen-to-me voice. Tony wasn't buying it (okay, maybe a little bit... Fury was scary).
He did not notice the moment he decided to move, did not notice the movement. One second he was standing, a single thought of want frozen in time. And the next second his lips were sealed to Tony's, too much, too fast. Not enough.
It was all so obvious now. Steve's disapproving but actually worried face, his inability to let Tony go into any kind of danger without the suit.
With Iron Man it was like all his control just snapped. He didn’t understand why he evoked such strong feelings in him or why he couldn’t hold it together when faced with the man.
Steve blinked. He wasn’t sure. “I was in the neighborhood. And I like the view,” he said, nodding towards Stark Tower.
“What do we do?” he asked. As a leader, he hated having to ask, but he was out of his element in this situation.
Fingers touched his shoulder. Red, metallic ones, no human hands with red nails. The difference was startling. He knew now why the red nails seemed so wrong, despite being the right color.
“Cap, I'm fine,” Tony said, trying but failing to remove the hand on his shoulder which only tightened again.
Tony’s face didn’t give much away. His poker face was almost as good as Natasha’s. But Steve could tell that this news surprised him. Tony didn’t know the Mandarin had his weapons.
He was left staring at the name for a few minutes longer, not believing. It was then that his phone went off. Without thinking much about it, he picked it up and read the message.
Steve tensed at the use of his last name but stood his ground. “You know I didn't mean it that way Tony.”
The ceiling was white, spotless. Not a hint of red on it. Steve stared and was confused as to why he had been expecting red. Tony's walls have always been pristine, the kind of white you only see in newly bought marble that does not last longer than a day.
“Jeez, Cap, tone it down, will you?” said Tony because he was starting to have some serious headache and this was one of the few times Steve's voice wasn't helping.
It all started with a fight with Doctor Doom. The guy was brilliant if mad and Tony had to respect at least that. Didn't mean he didn't want to bring him down though.
Steve met Clint outside the door and together they entered the room. The first thing Steve noticed were the two guards laying on the ground, stunned. The second thing were the boxes. Piles and piles of boxes.
“Well, you can wait for SHIELD to come get you. They should be here soon enough,” he turned to look at Steve. It was a striking visual, Tony in the suit. Like two pieces of puzzle you couldn’t imagine fit together until you tried to place them next to each other, and then you couldn’t believe you didn’t see it sooner. “Or,” Tony continued, voice hopeful, “I can give you a ride.”
“W… Wait a second,” Tony was still chuckling, still looking at Steve like he was an impossible piece of a physics equation.
“Okay, but not here,” Steve looked around. There was not a lot of people around, but he would still have liked to do it in private.
“Well, I’d like to date you,” Steve said bluntly. “We can take it as slow as you want. I’m patient.”
“I guess it makes sense,” Bruce said thoughtfully. “There are not a lot of people who could invent something like the Iron Man armor. Stark’s area of expertise fit it perfectly.”
“Come on, then,” Tony said. He took his hand and pulled, and Steve followed, knowing he would follow this man to the end of the world and not minding one bit.
There was a beat of silence before he looked back up at her. She had a small, surprised smile on her face. “Honestly, I was starting to think I’d never live to see the day,” she said when she caught him looking. At his confused frown, she elaborated, “You having feelings for someone.”
Tony knew he had a silly grin on his face, but Steve was so adorable, he couldn’t help it. “Good morning,” Tony said lightly, then frowned at the way his voice sounded, raspy and unused.
Steve crossed his arms and waited for Iron Man to leave, without saying a word. He knew it was petty, but he didn’t care at the moment.
wanted to be mad. Did Steve really thought Tony couldn't deal with Loki? It was Loki, for god's sake, it's not like they haven't dealt with him before.
Steve nodded. He stood there for a second, his body tense, his face was a blank expression. It was easy in that moment to keep a cold face. He wondered if it was this easy for Tony.
Because he did understand. He knew that Tony had Pepper now. Pepper, who loved him and who didn’t deserve what had almost happened. Steve felt guilty, thinking about her, but he couldn’t regret the moment.
“Maybe if Cap had actually let me fight, I would've been able to help,” replayed Tony. He knew he sounded bitter and any other time it would have made him wince that it was directed at Steve but he couldn't help himself.
The thought made Steve so angry that he had to force himself not to think about it. “So what you're saying is... Tony doesn't know I have… a crush...” and saying crush was a big understatement, but Steve wasn't ready to say anything more aloud “...on him, because...”
After a brief summery from Bruce about the new shipment received yesterday, of the new equipment he ordered, and Clint’s overview of another target he was following, they were ready to call it a day.
“I know, but I guess Howard never really got over your disappearance. You were... a perfect success, and I guess Tony... at least to Howard... wasn't.”
Tony turned back to the TV. Not for the first time, Steve wanted to know what he was thinking about.
They all looked at each other, thinking of the possibilities with dread. Almost suddenly, they simultaneously started walking toward the building.
But then Tony shifted and Steve realized he wasn’t asleep, just thinking. Then he said, “You’re the only good thing in my life.”
"Talking is overrated," said Steve, his eyes on a beautiful distraction that were Tony's bitten red lips.
They didn’t say anything as Tony got up. He pocketed his phone, but left the bottle of bourbon and the almost empty glass on the table. He moved toward the door, but in the last second turned around.
He rebooted it manually but the arrow caused some serious damage and it would take a while to reboot. Meanwhile the stupidbots (okay so maybe the name was not the best but Tony didn't really have the time to think of a new one) were closing in on him. At least the civilians ran away. Small mercies and all that.
“Yeah,” Tony whispered. His eyes were soft, vulnerable. Steve could see in that moment, as clear as day, that Tony would do anything to protect her. Then he shut the phone down and set it aside. “Wanna watch a movie?”
Tony was looking at him again, like he was trying to figure him out. “I barely know you. Why do I feel like I can trust you already?”
Outside was cold and damp from the earlier rain. Not many people were around but Tony was nowhere in sight. Steve decided to check the garage where Tony's car was (he didn't want to drive in the limo with the rest of them, said he preferred to drive himself so that he can leave whenever he wanted. And Steve wasn't stupid enough not to hear 'so that I can take someone back with me' behind the words) but someone's voice stopped him.
“I have a story myself,” Tony murmured into Steve’s neck, then raised his head to look him in the eyes. “But I think it’s for some other time.”
It drove Steve up the wall. And Iron Man seemed to also disagree with his own method of doing things (“uptight” as he would call it), so it was obvious why the two of them didn’t get along.
And so they became sort of infamous, the Captain and his crew, taking down evil corporations and the treats in this city.
Steve felt a pang of sympathy for Tony. He would hate being used like that, especially since he didn’t want to make weapons anymore anyway. But whoever was doing it must be found out. And to do that, they needed Tony. He was the only one who could find out what’s really going on.
, Tony thought as the armor assembled around him, watching as Captain America engaged Loki in a fight not unlike the one in Germany, when they all first met each other. Full circle and all that.
"For those 3 months, I was in an Afghanistan cave, being tortured and blackmailed to make weapons," before Steve could react, he carried on. "Instead, I made the first Iron Man suit. I got out.
Steve couldn’t help himself, he had to lean down and kiss Tony. They didn’t really do PDA, mostly because of the paparazzi, but they were pretty secluded in their space between Tony’s car and the bushes behind. It was worth it for the way Tony melted into the kiss. They kept it pretty chaste, with a promise for more. And suddenly, Steve couldn’t wait for them to get to his apartment.
' which would make Tony even more pissed off. Steve must have read it in his face because he just squeezed his shoulder in warning and left Tony hiding behind the conference table while he went out there to fight.
10 minutes later he was awoken from unconsciousness by a very pissed off Captain America, after being knocked out by a single blow to the head.
“What? I'm not going to just stand here and watch Loki destroy New York City property,” Tony said indignantly.
“I know that.” Steve interrupted her. “But what does that have to do with this?” In all honesty, Steve didn't like to think about Tony thinking he's not good enough. It made Steve's chest hurt even more than jealousy did.
Natasha looked surprised for a second, as if she didn’t really think Steve would believe her over Tony. But Steve and Natasha went way back. He knew she was the best at reading people. He will always trust her judgment, and he knew that she wouldn’t accuse Tony of anything unless she was absolutely certain of it.
“I actually suspected it for a while,” Tony said. When Steve looked at him in surprise, he shrugged. “Just some things didn’t add up. But I wasn’t sure, not until today.”
“Is this about your little group?” she asked, growing serious. They never explicitly talked about it at SHIELD. Too many prying eyes, too many walls having ears.
Inside was warm. Steve hadn't even noticed the wind outside getting colder, the night getting rid of the last traces of the lingering sunny day. Tony stepped out of the armor. It closed behind him, an inanimate red, colder without its occupant. Instead Tony was there, warm and alive, so alive. They needed to talk but instead they kissed, slow and fast and gentle and messy. Steve's knees hit the couch and he sat down, dragging Tony with him. He was in heaven, Tony in his lap, his kisses a searing heat down his throat.
he hissed and only then realized how much he actually confessed, but it didn't look as if Natasha was surprised by any of it.
Steve shook his head, “He is the most frustrating man I have ever met.” He pulled back his cowl and sat down. He was getting tired of all the fighting. “Call the meeting in the briefing room. We have a plan to make.”
“Okay, then,” Tony said quietly, then mirrored Steve’s position by laying his head on the back of the couch. Steve was distracted momentarily by Tony’s eyes looking directly at him.
Tony just blinked at him for a few second. Then shook his head. “I’m sorry, can I record you saying that? Because I don’t think Pepper will believe me.”
It became torture, the waiting. Steve didn’t want the time to come. But the waiting was killing him.
Tony bit his lip. He knew JARVIS was waiting for his instructions but he didn’t know what else he could possibly say to Steve.
But Steve was right, he knew he was. Tony would never sell weapons to a terrorist. He was planning to shut the weapons manufacturing division down. It didn’t make sense.
Steve huffed. “That’s what you think,” he said, just to be defiant. He glared at Natasha because she was the one who must have told Clint and Thor about his accidental coffee meeting with Tony. She shrugged. He knew she meant well, but he really wished she had kept that information to herself. “How about you stop speculating who I’m sleeping with, and concentrate on the issue at hand?” he asked sternly.
He didn’t really expect anything to come of it. Tony had to be a busy person, running one of the biggest companies in the country, if not the world. It was just Steve’s luck that he managed to get on his radar at all.
Still, the Avengers had everything under control. Cap was even shouting orders less frequently than usual, given that the fight was going so smoothly.
The realization was what finally got Steve to move, stepping over the face tattoo guy, and following Tony out of the room.
They waited in the shadows next to their van, when the first SHIELD vehicles rolled up, strike teams at the ready. True to her word, Peggy delivered them in record speed. If anyone were to ask questions, she would have told them that it was an anonymous tipper that made the call. But everyone would know that it was the Captain and his organization. This wasn’t the first time.
As he was making plans, trying to figure out the best way to get Tony to talk to the Captain, they arrived at Tony’s car. Steve didn’t even notice Tony was leading him there.
He was talking about his company, about his inventions, about Pepper. Steve realized that once Tony started talking, there wasn’t much that could stop him. Steve’s occasional ‘oh’s and ‘mhmm’s were enough for him to keep going. It was endearing, and Steve was grateful to just be able to sit back and listen.
Walking into the base felt surreal after the day he had. It felt like that sometimes when he was Steve Rogers for too long, going back to being the Captain, being in control.
When the first henchmen barged into the room, Steve took care of them pretty quickly. But he knew they had been discovered. More were coming, and he had to be prepared if he was going to buy Tony more time.
“More than ever,” Steve said, without hesitation. “And I know it’s not going to be easy. And we’re both going to fall into old habits. And it’s going to take some time to understand each other completely. But I’ve never wanted to try something more in my life. Tony, these last few months have been the happiest I’ve ever been. And I like to think I made you happy as well. And I want to continue doing that, for as long as you want me.”
Steve was nervous for the whole three days since they send the message and got the confirmation. He didn’t like that his two lives were mixing up. It felt like he was at a crossroad, and whatever decision he made today will affect his life going forward.
“Yeah, well, traffic was terrible this morning,” Steve said, having practiced that excuse in his head before coming here.
Tony locked himself down in his workshop, thinking back on the night before. It seemed surreal now, in the bright artificial light of the lab.
Natasha shook her head. “No way. You could never be meaningless to him.” Steve smiled at her gratefully but she wasn't done. “Listen, whether he realized it or not, Tony does have feelings for you. You just have to help him get his head out of his ass and accept it as inevitable that you two belong together.”
“Tony, I'm sorry. I'm sorry it took me so long to tell you, sorry I was a jackass who couldn't see past his own jealousy. Sorry it took me so long to talk to you, to tell you everything I wanted to tell you for so long.”
Under normal circumstances he would have been annoyed. He wanted to be, even now, but he couldn't. Not when he could still feel the cave around him, Steve's face just a blur.
And it was dangerous as well. Steve’s night job was always going to be a priority. And keeping it a secret from someone like Stark would not be in any way easy.
“Not anymore,” Tony said, quietly enough for only Steve to hear and suddenly serious. And it was something they touched upon, Tony’s stunt with palladium poisoning, but it was still a heavy topic. But Steve was glad to hear that, as Tony had helped him come to terms with both sides of his identity, he had helped Tony as well, and that meant more to Steve than he could ever express to him.
Steve smiled. He could hear it in Tony’s voice as well, all that regret and unused opportunities. The fact that they could have been together, if only they had been less stupid.
“Sure you are,” agreed Fury and Tony was instantly on alert. Fury wouldn't just agree with him unless... “You're also the most likely one to screw it up. By bringing a weaponized suit of armor for example.”
“Uh, nothing. I didn’t mean… Not like that,” Steve said in a strained voice. But it was too late, there was already a grin appearing on Tony’s face.
Steve directed him to the table they brought to the hangar specifically for this. Tony sat down and Steve, Nat and Clint sat on the opposite side of the table. It felt like they were about to interrogate him. Which, to be honest, they were.
The 40s seemed to him both familiar and strange, like a childhood home where parents still lived but the child moved on, only returning for brief stretches of time. He felt homesickness, a deep yearning for something he had and lost. But also a sense of wrongness. This was a home he had left behind. This was not where he was supposed to be.
He was glad Steve could not hear him or see him behind the one-way mirror. It was bad enough having to look at Steve, still with mussed hair and impatient look in his eyes. He could not have a conversation with him right now, especially the one he knew was coming.
“Steve,” Tony said, when there was a lull in the conversation. “You said you like the view, didn’t you?”
“Oh. Okay,” Stark said and Steve thought he could see something like disappointment cross his face. “Well Mr. Rogers,” the amusement was back. “I guess I’ll see you around.”
“You must be wondering why we called you,” she said. Steve let her speak. She was good at it and he didn’t trust himself not to mess it up.
“Flirt with him. We all know he’s weak for a pretty face,” Steve could hear amusement in Clint’s voice and was about to retort, when he saw Stark, elegant as ever, about to pass by him.
When they got back to the Tower, Tony didn’t lead Steve to the penthouse. Instead, he took him to a place Steve had never been in before, a place he knew meant more to Tony than any other. His workshop.
Fortunately, some businessman with grays in his hair approached them. He turned toward Stark and seemed to be completely ignoring Steve. “Mr. Stark, here you are. My business partner and I were wondering if you had a few minutes to spare, we’ve had this wonderful idea about…” the man’s voice blurred in Steve’s head as he caught Stark’s exasperated but amused gaze.
After some time has passed, they heard rustling in the dark trees. Steve felt all of them tense up next to him, before a voice called out.
"Then I met you," Tony repeated, like the sentence didn't reverberate in Steve's head already like an echo. "And at first I just thought you were really hot," Tony said, and Steve fought a blush. "But you were also so different, and earnest and innocent. You stood out. You made me want to know you. I looked at you, and that voice in my head that told me I shouldn’t trust anybody went quiet."
Once they both had steaming cups in their hands, they went outside and started walking in a mindless direction. They preferred walking and talking to sitting down, partly because of the nice day and partly because you never knew who could be near, eavesdropping.
Once he was done he put the brush gently down. It was time. He was going to look at the canvas. He was going to answer the question he hadn't even known he had asked.
"What now?" Steve asked, still on the edge. They might have got rid of the main guy, but there were still plenty of henchmen around the compound.
“So, I’m gonna need you to focus, okay? I’ll explain everything once we get out, but until then, just follow my lead.”
Steve remembered that day. What they were saying on the news. How Obadiah Stane died in an accident. Plane crash, if he remembered correctly.
There was a moment of pause after those words. Sam looked like he stepped inside an alternate reality, while others looked mildly amused.
Tony noticed. He pulled away, breathing harshly. "We should... I should... I need to get out of this armor. And we should talk." He was nodding along with his words, a confirmation to himself. "We should definitely talk."
It made sense, in hindsight. If anyone were to create an Iron Man armor, it would be Tony. It was exactly like him, to make something brilliant and use it to help people, without taking any of the credit. And the way Tony talked about Iron Man, like it was something bigger than him, even when Steve didn’t know they were one and the same. The painting he bought from Steve and placed it right in the middle of his entry hall.
So without thinking, without all his usual planning and calculating, he slammed his elbow to what he hoped was the guy's stomach and when the pressure on his head disappeared Tony turned and fired from the gun he was still holding (huh? He didn't even realize he still had it). The aim was at the guy's shoulder and it would have been a perfect shot but for the one small fact of Tony not having any ammo left.
The leader took another chair and placed it right in front of Steve. And then they sat Tony down on it and tied him up.
And then, there was the other problem. They will tell Tony about him. They’ll probably do it right here, in front of him. And Steve will have to watch, unable to do anything to stop it. It was one thing when Steve had to imagine Tony finding out on the TV in his Tower. That would have been bad enough. But this was worse. Much worse.
“Was?” Steve asked. As far as he knew, Stark Industries was still selling weapons. They did expand in the last year or so, in the green energy mostly, as Tony himself was just talking about. But still, the weapon manufacturing was their primary income, always has been.
Steve realized he was staring and Stark was looking more amused by the minute so Steve blurted out the first thing that came to mind, “What are you doing here?”
“This time. What if next time I won't be there? What if I won't make it in time?” Steve turned to face the wall opposite him so Tony couldn't see his expression.
It was Steve and there was determination in his eyes now and Tony knew he wouldn't like whatever he was about to say. “Tony,” Steve swallowed and looked away briefly, as if he knew Tony was going to fight him over this but he had to say it anyway. “Does your suit work?”
Tony closed his eyes. It hurt. Everything his dad said to him, about him being weak and useless, everything was coming back to him, flashing before his eyes. He knew Steve didn't mean it like that. Knew that Steve considered him valuable, had even said so. His stupid mind just couldn't break the connection, even if it was a connection he never wanted to make. Steve Rogers was the furthest thing away from Howard Stark but maybe they were both right about Tony.
“So... in what universe is stupidbots better than Hydrabots?” asked Clint. It was a stupid way to break the silence but it still made Tony laugh.
Steve was suddenly next to him, eyes looking all over him, looking for injuries. When he noticed Tony clutching his bicep, he pried the fingers off to inspect the injury and upon seeing it was just a graze he relaxed and it was only then that Tony noticed how tense he had been. Tony felt bad for making him worry and knew that as soon as Steve stops worrying, stops looking over him again and again, as if having to convince himself Tony was really okay, checking the injury, as if afraid it will turn out to be worse if he just averts his eyes off of it for just a second, that when he finally realizes Tony is here and not dead on the floor, he is going to be
And then it occurred to him. He didn’t have to prove that Tony’s innocent. Tony can do that by himself. He was the only one who could explain everything. He must know how those weapons got to the Mandarin, and if he doesn’t, he could find out. Maybe he has a leak in his company that he doesn’t even know about. Tony would be appalled by that. But he would also want to know, so that he could fire that person, and possibly lock them up in jail. It all made sense. Maybe they even found out about the weapon’s shut down and were now trying to sell as much as they could without Tony finding out about it.
“Great,” said Stark, but Wright didn’t seemed to catch the sarcasm as he smiled and wandered off at the direction of the bar.
“Hell’s Kitchen?” asked Clint. “I’m almost impressed, didn’t think Hammer had enough balls for that place.”
“If you're looking for Mr. Stark, he went that way.” The man pointed toward the other side, where the road stretched god knows where. Steve was suddenly grateful that they were so recognizable, as he thanked the man and started running in the right direction.
Tony laughed. “Yeah, I can imagine.” He laid back in his chair, fiddling with his by now empty cup, and continued looking at Steve like he was a mystery. “Poor Hank, he couldn’t have been too happy about Jan taking you to the gala.”
He also knew he’ll need to be as clear headed as possible if he wanted to escape later. And that meant no more injuries. So he slowed down. He missed a few punches. And he let them grab his arms and pull them behind him. Then one of the bigger guys came forward. He was bald, with face tattoos. He smirked as he raised his gun and hit Steve in the head with the back of it.
“Tony,” Steve said again, desperate. “I know this is a lot to take in. But, please, if you would just let me explain…”
“Guys, you have to come here right now,” Natasha whispered in the coms then gave them directions. It led right to the basement. Of course.
Steve pulled away. “Was that okay?” he asked and it was such a Steve thing to do that Tony could have laughed. But he was too tired to do much of anything so he just nodded and laid his head back on Steve's chest. Steve's arms came around him instantly and Tony again felt that safety, warmth and... love?
When the guy realized Tony didn’t have any more bullets he raised his own gun quickly and two things happened at once. The gun fired and a red, blue and white shield collided with it, knocking it off course.
Steve could tell that Tony was tense. He seemed to appear in control but he didn’t really know what was waiting for him. He didn’t know what was going to happen once they took the bag off.
“It’s not just that,” Steve promised Tony he wasn’t going to tell anyone about the division shut down. And besides, they would just think it was his word against the pile of evidence. “Please, you have to believe me.”
“Of course. Just sleep. I'm here,” Steve said and kissed his hair. It made Tony's chest tighten and he smiled slightly as he fell asleep, feeling safer than ever before.
“Unfortunately, we have extracted all possible information out of our prisoners.” Natasha was saying. “And even if they had more locations, the Mandarin is smart enough to relocate them after last time.”
He watched in shocked silence as Tony untied them with brutal efficiency. He moved to the door, to check the hallway and it took Steve a few slow seconds to join him.
“It’s nothing that can’t wait,” said Tony, before ushering him to the living room. It made Steve feel special, the way Tony choose him over work, wanting to rather spend his time with him.
Steve was about to go on a rant about privacy, when Natasha interrupted him, “So, wait, does that mean you like
Tony suspected the fight wouldn't take longer than a couple of minutes. Waste of his precious time really.
He opened his eyes slowly to survey his environment. He was in a huge room, probably the basement. He was sitting on a chair, his hands tied behind his back, his legs tied to the chair. The room was bare, except for the far end, where there was a desk and some chairs and some guards around it. Among them was the face tattoo guy. He was Steve’s least favorite.
Steve stared at Tony in surprise. “Really? We can, but… It’s not a penthouse,” he said with a laugh. His crappy apartment was the size of Tony’s bedroom, it wasn’t exactly something Steve wanted to show off.
"When I came back, all I wanted to do was shut down the weapons division at SI. But Obbie told me not to. He told me to wait, at least until things settled down. I decided to listen to him, at least until I had the solid grasp at what was happening in my company. I knew someone had to have sold my weapons illegally. I wanted to know who it was."
He looked up at Steve who was sitting on the bed (and one glance around the room confirmed it was Steve's SHIELD room), his arms still around Tony but loose now, as if giving Tony the chance to pull away. Tony didn't.
Tony looked up at him. “No. You’re the one thing I have that’s not tainted. I want it to stay that way for as long as possible.”
And as intriguing and funny as Tony was, Steve knew that that would have been a better outcome. He has spent the last few days just thinking about how dangerous involving himself with Tony would be.
Granted, there were a lot of things to be jealous of when it came to Tony Stark. His wealth, his genius, his good looks... To name a few. Steve was never jealous over any of those.
But they didn’t need to worry. “Yes,” Steve said simply, taking Tony’s hand in his. “Guys, I know this is not how I planned to it, but meet Tony Stark. My boyfriend. You might also know him as Iron Man.”
“I thought you guys briefed him?” Steve asked. He didn’t feel like going over the missions again, but if Sam was out of the loop, they would have to.
“Because Stark, you are going into foreign territory to negotiate peace and bringing your high-tech weapon of mass destruction may not send the message we're trying to convey,” said Fury in his nicest voice. It wasn't really all that nice. “Besides, as I said, you will have Rogers and Romanoff at your side at all times.”
“You almost died Tony,” Steve shook his head as if not believing he had to spell this out to him. “You almost died and now you want to act as if nothing happened? As if everything went perfectly according to plan?“ he sounded broken somehow, tension in his shoulders visible, and Tony could only imagine how much Steve probably wanted to shake his shoulders and maybe even lock him in his room for the rest of his life. Because Steve was a team mum apparently.
Most of their co-operations ended with more fighting between the two of them than fighting bad guys, so they decided to mostly stick apart, except for the occasional information exchange (which Steve will admit, have been very useful at times).
“We would analyze the data and hopefully help him track down the location,” said Bruce. He already had a tablet in his hands and Steve saw a map displayed. They were probably discussing the places Iron Man should hit first.
And he was entering an unfamiliar and dangerous situation with minimal amount of knowledge as to why they called him here. He was at a disadvantage. But you would never think that by looking at him.
Clint cursed under his breath. Steve was still staring at the boxes. There were almost as many of them as they were from Hammer.
He was there with Natasha, Clint, Sam and Bruce. Thor was back in his home country, where he had to go to deal with his brother, which was why he wasn’t around much lately.
There was also that thing in his hand that somehow kept him grounded, kept him from freaking out even when his chest felt like something really heavy dropped on it. Something like a building perhaps.
But Tony shook his head. He seemed like he wanted to say something, but changed his mind in the last second. He turned his head back to look at the TV but his body was still angled toward Steve.
“But it's useless until it reboots,” Tony protested. He managed to drag himself over to a fallen police car and slump against it in a sitting position.
And it made Steve ache, more than it should have. Because that was still Tony, a man that he cared about, the man that made him more alive than he felt in a very long time. But it hurt, because how could that be Tony, when Tony was this, arrogant and flippant and uncaring. When Tony was Iron Man, and Iron Man was everything Steve disliked in a person.
Steve just knocked down another one when he made eye contact with Tony. His eyes widened at seeing Tony standing there and not hiding as he was supposed to. His eyes narrowed when he noticed the gun Tony was holding and Tony had a flash of apprehension for the backlash he'll receive for disobeying orders again.
Natasha's words got Tony thinking though. Doom wasn't even putting on much of a fight and seemed to engage Tony simply because Tony was in his way. He even tried to leave, leaving Tony with the armor and all. It was only when Tony threw that missile at him that Doom got annoyed enough to do something about him. “You're right Tasha,” Tony murmured. “It doesn't add up. He was...” he was trying to leave.
Steve forgot about the dream. He didn't even know there was something to remember. The nagging feeling in his gut told him there was something he was missing, but he could not tell what that something was so he ignored it.
The outside was sunny and warm, so unlike Steve's mood. He didn't recognize the landscape, but he knew they had to still be in New York.
His relationship with Pepper? That crashed and burned faster than the Titanic. Sure it was nobody's fault. Tony blamed karma. You had to blame something.
“Have you ever met him?” Steve asked. Despite his dislike for the man inside the armor, he could see why Tony would like the idea of him, an armored vigilante, using tech to save the world.
Steve could tell Tony didn’t really believe it. They all hoped, sure, but there was also doubt in all of them. There were so many variables, and Tony knew, more than anyone else, how any one of them could go wrong in multiple ways. No wonder he couldn’t sleep.
“You’re all of that,” Steve said, after a moment. “And you’re so much more than that. You’re the smartest person I know. You care about others and you fight for what’s right. You’re fast and brilliant, and sometimes I can’t keep up with you, and I always think you’re going to realize how much I can’t compare. You saw something in me when you thought I was just a small-time artist from Brooklyn. You saw me when I didn’t even see myself. When I thought all I was, all I could ever be was the Captain, you showed me that Steve Rogers was someone as well, a person worth your attention.” Steve was steadily getting closer to Tony, until there was almost no space between them at all.
He felt it, sometimes, before the serum. Watching the boys play outside while he was stuck in bed, weak and sickly. He wanted to be more like them. ‘Jealousy,’ his mum would say, getting him away from the window, where he sat for hours watching other kids play, ‘is not a good look on you.’
And then, without warning, a knife appeared at the other guy's hand, and it was all Steve could do to block it from plunging into his ribs. But then the second knife was in the other hand, going toward his side, and Steve braced himself for the pain.
“Fine,” Tony muttered, hanging up. He instructed JARVIS to deploy the suit and fly it next to the Avengers' quinjet (even if the suit could actually be there much, much sooner).
But they were there for a reason and his name was Richard Johnson, an acclaimed advocate of many wealthy businessmen and their companies, including Hammer Technologies. Steve and his crew have been tracing Hammer for a while, trying to find any kind of evidence that he was dealing under the table, selling to terrorists.
Tony pulled Steve to him and Steve went willingly as Tony closed the distance between them. His lips closed around Steve’s own and his hands winded around his neck, his fingers going through soft, blond hair. Steve’s own hands came to rest on his waist but the pressure was almost nonexistent, as was Steve’s weight on Tony. Tony wanted to sigh in annoyance but he knew Steve needed to be careful with him, for his own benefit as much as Tony’s. He would probably never forgive himself if he hurt Tony, intentionally or otherwise.
But as he stood to leave and looked at Steve, again with that apologetic smile, Steve could only see Tony, who was magnetic and interesting and who he definitely wanted to know better.
“What he always does,” said Steve, a little more bitterly than he should have, perhaps. “He wouldn’t have waited for an explanation, that’s for sure. He’d probably destroy Stark Industries because he’d think you’re dealing under the table.”
“Excuse me, sir?” the voice said, and Steve flinched so hard he would have fallen down if Tony’s legs didn’t keep him in place. He looked around, but there was no one there, and the doors to the workshop remained closed.
“Too visible. Steve. You can’t let your feeling get in the way of work,” Natasha voiced his own thoughts. It wasn’t any easier to accept it.
But before he got to jump, the dream changed. Arms held him across the waist, but he was not mid-air. He was standing in the middle of a blurry street, as though his eyesight betrayed him - although he knew full well he had never needed eyeglasses. The arms seemed wrong to him too, though he could not immediately discern why. They were feminine hands, elegant fingers, long, red nails. Delicate yet strong, power held in them unassuming and subtle. As soon as he recognized them the streets sharpened, every shape and color coming into sharp detail.
Tony exhaled then hugged Steve. His hands were clutching at Steve’s shirt, his face buried in the crook of Steve’s neck.
He was walking down the hallway, about to gather his team, when his phone started pinging. Steve fished it out and on it was a big, red warning sign saying ‘Iron Man In The House’.
Steve was next to Tony in a second (and any other time Tony would marvel at the speed in which Steve crossed the room to get to him) giving him his jacket to breathe through.
Tony's mouth twisted. "Still, while you might have been an exception, the Captain and his crew were not. It was easier to put you guys at a distance. It was easy to put the Captain at a distance. We were just so different. And I knew that if he didn't want me around, the others would back him up. Back you up."
“Yes, well, I still thought it was funny. Frustrating, but funny,” Tony said, turning back to the monitors.
Steve shook his head. His hair was still ruffled and Tony resisted the urge to smooth it down. “Natasha has a theory.”
She nodded but did not linger, letting Steve think on his own. And think he did, somewhat unwillingly. He knew she had been right. All that thinking was getting him nowhere.
Seems not. Tony just smiled knowingly. “He should really devote more time to her. He’s not gonna find anyone who can tolerate him the way she can.”
Steve looked at Tony. He seemed so relaxed, like he rarely let himself be, especially in public. Steve thought that maybe he was responsible for that, at least a little bit. The thought made him feel warm inside.
He glanced around, like he was only mildly curious. He had one hand in his pocket and the other was holding a big, silver briefcase. He looked like he had just walked out of a very satisfying meeting.
Then, without warning, the small doors at the back of the room opened and Tony Stark walked inside, like he owned the building. He wore a three piece suit and sunglasses that probably cost more than Steve’s rent. He looked good. Nobody could deny that.
It was only later, alone in his lab, that Tony remembered what Steve was responding to and what that response might've meant.
By the time he manually opened the armor and stepped out of it, Doom was gone and Tony wondered for a brief moment why he didn't just kill him (it's not like villains have morality code or anything, at least the ones like Doom). Then he saw his team coming toward him, all in their righteous post battle glory and maybe Doom decided it wasn't worth it?
, and somebody could have hurt you. Or worse.” Steve was breathing hard, and even from his position kneeling next to Tony on the floor, his whole presence felt like it could melt gold just by looking at it.
The one from Peggy showed all the bases SHIELD has managed to hit up in the last half an hour. Tony looked impressed and Steve smiled. Peggy always
“But nothing. If Tony really did sell those weapons, I’ll lock him in a prison cell myself. But I don’t believe he did, Pegs. I really, really don’t. This is not just a hunch,” he glanced at Natasha.
But for today he could forget all about Iron Man. Natasha would contact him and they would arrange a meeting, but for now Steve could relax and silently celebrate today’s successful work.
Tony shook his head. "There are easier ways to do that," his voice was soft now, almost sad. "You accuse me of doing everything alone, but you do it just as much Steve. Captain."
It didn’t matter now anyway, so Tony dismissed the thought. All that mattered was Steve. Steve who was here and who was
When he did, he almost groaned. He hated hospitals and the white, sterile room he was in was definitely a hospital room. There was even that distinct hospital smell and that more than anything helped calm his racing heart and pull him from the edges of memories of Afghanistan.
Steve gritted his teeth. It’s been a while since he saw Iron Man and he was starting to forget how annoying the man could be. Good thing he showed up to remind him.
In hindsight, it probably wasn't his best idea to shoot a missile at the angry supervillain's back but he was getting rather desperate. Doom, on the other hand, didn't even flinch, not even when everything in his vicinity caught on fire, but he did seem more aggravated by the action, enough to turn around and do his magic mumbo jumbo and then Tony's suit was shutting down, and everything went black, and
Steve turned around and stared at Tony incredulously. The henchmen that managed to slip past Steve were on the floor, unconscious. Tony himself was standing among them, unharmed.
“Right,” Steve said. It didn’t really explain how the elevator knew to start moving but he wasn’t going to risk asking another, potentially embarrassing, question.
“What the fuck?” Clint exclaimed, eyes wide. He looked at Natasha, who of course looked as composed as ever. “Did you know about this?”
She shook her head, as if she couldn’t believe what was happening to him, and even the others looked puzzled. Steve was known for his concentration and ability to focus, so him spacing out was a new and weird thing to witness.
There was also the fact that, when they did decide to work together (for efficiency purposes) Iron Man never listened to him. Even Clint and Natasha listened to his orders when on the field. He was the Captain. Strategizing and making plans was his job, and Iron Man seemed to disregard every decision Steve made, in favor of his own, more reckless ones.
And then Stark. He was supposed to be the worst of them. And yet, here he was, sitting down with a man he met only once before, basically a stranger, in casual wear, looking tired, and talking like they did this every day. Complimenting Steve’s art.
But there was no point in dwelling on it. Tony was gone, and Steve was left, once again, wondering if he was ever going to see him again.
“So we’re back at square one?” asked Clint. He sounded resigned and Steve could sympathize. They’ve been going after Hammer for far too long.
“Mr. Stark,” he said, unable to keep the surprise out of his voice. He didn’t really expect to see the man again, especially so soon and so randomly. It was more than a little surprising.
Seriously, where the hell did the robots find an EMP arrow? Did they stole it from Hawkeye? (Tony hoped not, because that would be the arrows he designed and those could do some serious damage.)
But on the other, he was so furious, because how could Tony be that person, the person Steve so passionately disliked.
Almost two hours later, Tony brought them down in the hangar area. It was weird coming in from this side, especially when he had spent so long looking up to see Iron Man coming and going from that exact spot.
' as Cap so eloquently put it, they all found themselves situated at various places at the gala, where the intel exchange was supposed to happen. Tony and Steve, being the two most recognizable and thus obvious members of the team had to stay and patrol just outside, hidden in the shadows. Bruce waited in the van, nobody wanting to risk his stress level rising if the mission went awry (in a room full of people no less). Thor was with him, as he was the one with zero stealth capability (he would just break into the gala and demand that the intel be given to him).
Steve didn’t ask why. He trusted Tony to know what he’s doing. But he needed to keep his mind off of the obvious.
Steve came closer and wrapped his hands around Tony’s neck. “I do,” he repeated his earlier words and hoped that Tony could hear everything else he wanted to say in them. Steve was in this, despite everything. He was ready, finally, for the long overdue, honest conversation.
Something painful crossed Steve's face but it was gone in a second, so Tony refused to acknowledge it. “You should. There was just nothing you could have done in that particular fight and you know it. I was trying to protect you.”
“Because this elevator only goes to one floor,” at Steve’s questioning look he added, “The penthouse.”
Steve smiled and the grin made Tony dizzy, like a possibility of a future. It made him believe a little bit more.
Tony looked like he knew Steve was only asking for the lack of anything else to say, but indulged him anyway.
Natasha once again, took the initiative to speak first. “Do you know who the Mandarin is?” Her voice was clipped and to the point. It was always effective.
“You're the Captain, you know best,” Tony said. He wanted to make it light, make it a joke but instead it sounded resigned.
“Not in time,” said Tony. “I can't... I don't know... This is nothing like I've ever seen and we've only got 3 more minutes,” he was starting to get slightly hysterical but someone grabbed his arm and turned him around.
His blond hair was messy, and his clothes were rumpled, and he seemed as if hadn’t moved from his chair for a while.
’) threw a car (a freaking car) at a spot where at least a dozen civilians were huddled together and Tony had only a couple of seconds to lift the car before it killed everyone below (and he did it, because he was Tony Stark,
Tony looked right into her eyes, unflinching. He didn’t repeat the official story that the public was told about Stane’s death. Instead, he repeated Natasha’s own words back to her. “That is irrelevant.”
A fact that did kind of put him in his current predicament, true, but he was also pretty sure it saved a whole city and millions of people so Tony was not going to complain.
“Well, we can’t hit up all the bases ourselves,” said Tony dryly. “And it was your idea to include SHIELD anyway. You know, instead of calling Iron Man.” He looked over his shoulder and raised an eyebrow.
He saw Natasha standing at the end of the hallway, being checked on as well (as were everyone else affected by the gas even when it was established the effects would wear of slowly) and Tony knew she hated it, would always nurse her injuries by herself (or in some rare cases, have Bruce do it) but he also knew she couldn't just run away, here in this foreign country, with people who would probably take it the wrong way. Still, she seemed fine, and even gave him a slight smile which was highly unusual for her but he realized that she was probably worried for him as well. Scared that he was going to die. It was nice to know she cared.
Steve frowned in confusion. There was no way they could know who he was. He was just a small time artist. Apart from their tattoos, they didn’t look like big art people.
Tony himself was pushing some buttons, as if he wanted to appear busy, but Steve could see that he was almost nervous, expectant. The armor that brought them here was standing beside him, the light in its chest dark.
The next few weeks went by in a daze. Steve saw Tony every other day and they only got closer as the time passed by. Steve even met the famous Pepper Potts, despite Tony’s protests, and they really hit it off. She reminded him of Peggy.
“Wait,” she threw out her hand. They stopped. Whatever it was she was looking at, she didn’t want them to see it. But she knew they had to. So she slowly lowered her hand and looked at Steve with regret.
“Were you listening to our conversation?” Steve asked. He couldn’t believe he’d forgotten to turn off his coms.
Steve looked at Natasha for help, but she just looked amused. “The thing is… We didn’t want Iron Man to accuse you of something before we gave you a chance to explain.”
Things on the Iron Man front were quiet for once, and Steve was grateful. He was in a too good mood only to have it ruined by the other man.
For once, Steve wasn’t thinking about the next mission, the next bad guy to take down. He wasn’t waiting for something to go wrong or for a new lead to show up. He was happy in the moment. For maybe the first time ever since coming from the army, Steve was able to relax.
Steve blinked, surprised. “Well…” he hesitated. “We didn’t want Iron Man to jump to the wrong conclusions.”
“Maybe if Tony hadn't decided to take a nap in the middle of the fight, that would have gone smoother,” said Clint. He was joking, Tony knew that, but it still made something ugly crawl at the pit of his stomach.
came. His tattoos seemed more sinister in the bright light of the computer screens, and the minions surrounded him like a flock of birds.
Tony knew it would hurt like hell, after everything was said and done, but he did it anyway, unable to deny Steve anything, accepting the one night he would get with him as a gift and a penance.
“But why would Tony need to...” And then he realized. “You mean to tell me that Howard measured Tony up to me? That's ridiculous.” The idea couldn't even form shape in Steve's mind. How could someone, least of all his own father, think that Tony was not as good as, or even better, than Steve.
“Eventually,” she nodded. “You would have to. I can’t imagine keeping something like that a secret, especially if it becomes serious.”
The face tattoo guy got impatient. He ripped the magazine out of the other guy’s hands and looked at the pages himself. Then he looked at Steve. Back at the pages. Then he laughed as well, that manic laugh you get when you can’t believe your own luck. “You’ve got to be shitting me.”
