Except for a small part of his parietal lobe, that small part which controlled the pain and the touch. But that for now only sensed the touch.
They fell silent once again. Sherlock looked down with a smile still drawing in his face (which he wished would remain hidden) and John looked around. Realization hit him and he smiled wider. “You say you’re better than all of these, huh?”
And now he was sitting on a waiting room, surrounded by people weeping and he kept asking himself if all of this was worth it. John had decided to move on with his life, to forget about him, to leave all they had went through behind.
He looked around and thought of how much he hated that flat. A bedroom, a living room and a tiny kitchen, and he felt trapped, trapped between the dark walls, the closed windows, the creaky bed, the empty space. It was all so... boring. The browning was still laying on his top drawer. It was reassuring to know it was there.
to know. "Because, I got to know you. And I realized the reason why I don't understand you is because you are completely different from every single person I've ever met. And it's different. And I love how everything is different with you.
So, this is it, the final chapter. I want to thank each and every single one of you for reading, commenting and sending your kudos, your support kept me going on despite all the ugly things we had to go through as a fandom, and despite the angst and the sadness. I hope you enjoy this epilogue and I hope you've enjoyed this ride. Your comments made my days and even though I know maybe this was too angsty, I hope in the end it was worth it, because you guys deserve all the beautiful and wonderful things in the world. Thank you and thank you. Enjoy!
He asked as if what he had just said was meaningless, as if it shouldn't matter that John was no longer in charge, as if Sherlock shouldn't worry about that fact that John saw him and left, that John abandoned this, abandoned him. He asked as if the earth was still moving, as if the very cores of it hadn't collided piece by piece, he asked as if life kept on, as if it was a minor happening and nothing else, as if the world was the same place it had been five seconds ago.
They broke the kiss, John with a smile plastered around his face. Sherlock couldn’t help but do the same.
John smiled slightly, feigning seriousness. "I meant to say that you were simply trying to help and I shouldn't have done what I did. I- regretted it as soon as I walked through the door and- that."
a hateful singsong he had grown accustomed to, yet not well enough. He turned and looked into those dark eyes, full of something he couldn't quite tell, something he hadn't been able to unveil yet. And the smile, that horrible, terrifying smile forming on his lips. He blinked.
"Sherlock, look" she said turning him back. "Two things: one, I really and truly am sorry for the pain I caused you, and two, even though I'm still very pissed at you for what you did, I think you have the right to get John's confidence back. He did look so happy when he was with you..."
"I also know that you drove to John Watson's house while drunk-" Mycroft said shaking his head. "How disappointing, Sherlock, you never learn."
Sherlock didn't reply for a while. Then he turned towards John. "Nothing. We are nothing at all." And he left walking.
Sherlock held him. What else was there for him to do? There were so many things he wanted to say, but it wasn't the right time. He wondered if he would ever get to say them at all. It seemed unlikely, and yet it seemed unlikely that John would ever kiss him again, and he just had.
Sherlock stood in the bed. "I'm fine". There was something about Sherlock's voice that didn't sound fine at all.
They were at Mycroft's office underground. It had been Sherlock's last resource. He seriously didn't want to ask his brother but deep inside he knew he would hold the answer. He had kept an eye on John all this time, after all. He took a deep breath but just about he was to reply, Mycroft raised his eyebrows as if reading him and smiled slightly.
"I don't like rock n' roll." John said shaking his head, still looking at Sherlock, this time right into his eyes.
"He started seeing some excitement within life again, the smile came back to his face, he started writing on his blog, he talked to me regularly. Things had changed. And I was so relieved, because Sherlock, I don't know what would have happened to John if he hadn't found you. So I want to thank you, thanks, for whatever you did. You changed it all, you changed John's life. You made it better, you gave it a meaning again."
no matter how many times John had said he wasn’t gay and Sherlock said he was married to his work) he felt the pang returning to his chest.
Harry's voice sounded distant even though she was in front of him. He was lost in thoughts, not paying attention to a word his sister was saying. What could Sherlock possibly be doing? Was he okay? Still working on the case? What if he was in danger? He really should stop thinking, but he simply couldn't.
face, in a more friendly one, something John still didn't understand. Another layer of Sherlock's façade. "What?" John said trying to sound as cool and as nonchalant as possible.
"John, let me explain." He heard himself saying. He turned and John was looking at him seriously, but differently. His gaze was ice cold, he was expressionless. He gave nothing away. The only thing his face showed was... hate. A deep and profound hate.
tried not to picture Sherlock and Victor, but he couldn't help it. He pictured a young Sherlock taking the pills, fucking Victor and driving away. And then his sister...
Except for those unusual impulses that appeared in his mind, out of nowhere, unbidden and uncontrolled. Sherlock wished he could stop them, but he didn’t really want to. It was…appealing, to say the least.
John shook his head. "Nothing. You're right. There's nothing weird about it. Just bringing a friend. Sure."
John passed by the corner and took a deep breath. Sherlock sat up straight, closed his book and looked at him, not smiling but not looking completely closed to a conversation. John didn't look at him, he walked past him, looking straight ahead, not blinking, clearly trying his best to ignore him as much as possible. Sherlock frowned and bit his lip, all he could see now was John's back, walking determined, hurriedly, towards the Chemistry lab, and he got lost in the crowd. Sherlock sighed and stood up to go to Hikes' classroom. This was going to be a long afternoon.
She came back in a hurry, and picked up her purse, looked at Sherlock and smiled, trying to hide her very evident concern. "I have to go, Mr. Holmes. Please don't talk about this nor about me to anybody, please. I trust in you."
"Fine. The most brilliant mind of the century." Melissa said, fighting the urge to roll her eyes, realizing that Holmes was just like Watson portrayed him.
"I... Should go... Unpack... And pack. To leave. Tomorrow." Harry went to John's room and John stayed at the living room, wondering what to say now. He needed to say something, to ask something, to do something.
“Now for the pupil”, Sherlock said, his voice growing more intense. “Draw the bigger circle in the middle and the smaller one. The light! Did you see how the light draws in your eye? I mean, in everyone’s eye. It shines. Leave that space in blank, the trace of the light.
John started giggling and Sherlock looked at him, frowning. The boy tried to stop laughing but he couldn't.
"Make me." Sherlock said looking at John defiantly and talking in that low, seductive tone the bastard knew how to pull so well.
... Look, like it or not, we have to work together and there's nothing I can do about it. So we better do it right."
John stood up immediately. He had enough. He was tired of it. Sherlock and his goddamned mood swings and his thousand personalities. Enough.
But he hated drawing figures, and that was what he had been focusing on practicing so far, because he really, really needed to practice them.
Sarah grinned at him as soon as she saw him, she looked different, she had a beautiful hairdo and a lovely dress, and it felt somehow different to see her outside of school, John grinned back. "I thought you wouldn't come! Come on in! Everyone's here already!"
John must have noticed with that artistic sixth sense of his, because as he sat on the couch he said, "try living on an army pension".
Sherlock walked just behind him. John never turned, not once, to check if Sherlock was there, he knew he was.
tried to pull a friendly face. It was the best thing he could do. Sherlock was incredibly focused, reading J.D. Salinger's
John looked away again, sometimes he felt like Sherlock knew more about him than he should. But he didn’t really care. It was good sometimes that Sherlock knew what he didn’t have the courage to say.
John had been a constellation of what ifs, and Sherlock couldn’t stop it. His mind raced over and over, creating a thousand different scenarios in which they could have worked, but not in this universe. It simply wasn’t meant to happen in this universe, in this lifetime.
that's exactly how you feel and that's exactly what you wanted to hear. And I'm saying it, I'm unveiling it."
As soon as the door of the flat closed, he slumped himself in the couch and looked at the tiny trace the drugs had left in his body.
Clara didn't live very far away from Sherlock's house, and in like ten minutes they were already there. The place was full of people, about to burst, yet they got in. Music was very loud and Sherlock felt he missed this, not dancing, not talking to people, he missed listening to music and looking at people come and go as he drank, it made him happy.
Sherlock's eyes widened but he didn't interrupt him. He sat next through him as John told him, one by one, each and every single thing he'd lived in Afghanistan. His face was expressionless, as if he was in some kind of trance. His voice never wavered. He never stopped to think, as if it was a tale he'd known by heart since he was a kid. Sherlock ached to reach out and take his hand, but he stood still, knowing quite well that John didn't want that at the moment.
Mycroft called Anthea and asked her to track all the recent information concerning John Watson. He then turned his attention back to his brother. “I’ll text you the details. The hairdresser just arrived. Please go back to your normal haircut, Sherlock. I can’t take you seriously when you look like that.”
John loosened the hold of Sherlock's hand. "Of course I have! He was my neighbor and he is dead! And he was tortured and he received seven gunshots and oh god, it was all happening right next to my house!"
She shrugged. “That’s what Dr. Watson said but I don’t believe much of it. You’ve seen patients come and go. Not a single one who didn’t have a romantic involvement.”
Eventually his fists unclenched their hold on John's shirt and he fell asleep, listening to John's reassuring voice, feeling the soft skin of his neck under his lips.
“Hm”, John said, noncommittally, and turned to walk away. Sherlock looked to the ground. John was really not pleased at all with Sherlock’s request.
"Yes dear, Mrs Hudson" she answered with a smile. "I brought you two your pies and some milk so you can take a proper break from working so hard."
Sherlock didn't answer, he just moved a little as John sat by his side. Then, as soon as he was seated, the greaser opened the book again and continued reading without paying any attention to John.
Sherlock's eyes widened and he stood up immediately. "I need to get the grease", he said rushing out of his bedroom.
After a long time of riding, John realized that the road didn't seem at all like the one he had taken to get to Sherlock's house. "Wait, wait ,wait. Sherlock! Where are we going?"
"No way, Clara, we need to clean up this mess and Jim is not here and Sebastian is so wasted he can't even hold a broom!"
He broke their gaze. "And you- you haven't forgotten much, you still remember the cases, the things we did together, you just don't remember me on them."
John kissed him again. "It's okay. It will hurt just a bit, if you want me to stop tell me and I will", he said as he poured some lube in his hand. His voice was gentle and he sounded completely in control, and Sherlock wondered how he managed to sound so calm, when Sherlock felt like his whole brain was about to explode into a zillion supernovas.
The last time he had felt anticipation, however, John hadn’t recognized him, so he didn’t hold onto that
He didn't say anything, he simply reached up and ran his fingers through John's forearm, feeling the muscles beneath. John turned to trace the path Sherlock's fingers had made and they simply stood like that, speechless.
Sherlock opened his eyes. John kept his eyes on the painting, a small, soft smiled drawing in his face.
"I don't know either, but we've got to figure something out, Sherlock. If he's alive, then he's coming, and he's coming to get what he couldn't last time. You."
"I'm fine, I just want to sleep a bit. Yes a bit of sleep. No, no, I'm not going anywhere, just a bit of sleep. That's all I need."
"Well, it torments Sherlock too." John said slowly, his eyes fixed on his sister as he asked himself why was he still defending Sherlock when he was supposed to do the opposite and not think about the greaser.
When it was time to go to the club, he found Sherlock in that chair he always used, reading again, incredibly focused, but he was now holding another book, it was Ray Bradbury's
John fell asleep almost immediately. Sherlock didn't want to, but he fell asleep as well, drowning in a thousand memories his mind often tried to forget, while John's smell penetrated his senses.
And John smiled, a very tiny lift of his lips, but that was enough for Sherlock, who froze there looking at him and finishing his coffee. As soon as he was done, he stood up shakily. "Well, I'd better be off." And he almost fell. Coffee didn't help, he was still very drunk.
Well, to be fair, Sherlock’s flat was devoid of color too, but with a huge, abysmal difference: it had Sherlock in it.
He simply had never felt such kind of proximity towards any other human being ever. He couldn’t understand how John had managed to break through his carefully constructed shields and reach to him, but he had, in such little time he had. He never thought he would find someone else to be that interesting, that complex, it just didn’t seem right, this was something Sherlock never did.
you? That boy who stood silent and quiet while I was being beaten and pushed against the lockers. Yes. That one
He looked up and saw her. She smiled at him. He didn't say anything. He didn't move, his expression didn't change. "Good evening, Mr. Holmes."
He knew Mycroft was staring at him, probably with an expression akin to wonder and amusement but right now he couldn't care less because
By the time Michael killed Alice, Melissa was dating him. She had manipulated him into killing her and then threatened him to not to say a word about her. It had worked. He didn’t.
John's eyes shone with excitement and Sherlock thought it was the most beautiful image he had ever seen.
"Yes, yes. Finally. It was our birthday present, for both me and Harry, but that day she escaped and left to a party and drank too much and... Well, she had a race and crashed our car with another one. I don't know what happened to the person she crashed with, I just remember a phone call and ambulances and Harry was fine but the other wasn't and now I'm the only one allowed to drive."
"Fine. But if Mycroft discovers you I'll say you forced me to leave the house and go to the damn party and I didn't want to but I had to." "I-
"I hadn't seen you in my life and now I'm supposedly your 'partner in crime-solving'? I don't even know what you are! What did you tell the press?"
He should stop thinking about John, he really should. He should stop creating all this fake scenarios and convince himself that it
“Because- I couldn’t sleep. And I had to talk to you. I didn’t wake you up, did I?”, John asked, the words coming out a bit slurred.
Sherlock stared at him, stunned. Without even thinking he leaned up and their lips met once again, softly, less desperate.
Victor raised an eyebrow, looking all of the sudden surprised. “Oh, so you’re here to see me. Good.”He smiled slightly.
John smiled into the kiss. He smiled as he pressed his lips harder against Sherlock’s. He wrapped his hands around the nape of his neck, dragging him in.
"... Talked to him in a long time, and every time he called we ended up fighting, he didn't come back in here, he was everywhere, looking for a place to stay..."
“It’s not trembling now”, Sherlock whispered. They were close enough that John could understand all of the words.
Sherlock closed his eyes. Why had John to find him like that? all the traces of life left off him, all the traces of what could have been? why did John got to see him tore into pieces? The last scrapes of who he was taken away from him?
And it was true. He couldn't distinguish the physical pain from the mental one, because it all fucking hurt, from the tips of his toes to his fingertips, from his knees to his scalp, it all hurt, as if all the places John Watson had seen, had touched, had kissed were now suffering the withdrawal.
John dragged a deep breath. He closed his eyes. “We- were running away. We were holding hands, I don’t- I don’t know why. We just were.”
John shook his head, uncertain if he should be boiling with anger or laughing. He stood up impulsively, telling himself it was the best choice.
Sherlock allowed himself to be guided. John broke their kiss and stared at him. Sherlock palmed John's cock. John's eyes grew closed. His breathing was ragged, but for completely different reasons.
John pulled Sherlock's pants down and they were both finally naked. John stepped back for a moment and simply looked at him, without even blinking. Sherlock swallowed, feeling self-conscious all of a sudden, he realized then that John had never seen him naked, not like this before. The scars, the bullet, the track marks, they were all there, in plain sight. Sherlock  was exposing his most intimate side to John Watson, and he felt incredibly grateful to be able to do so.
John shrugged and fixed his eyes to the floor, as if it was going to fall if he stopped staring at it. “Yes. He’s gone. I’m just cutting all the links I had left of him.”
“See, the problem is that, no matter how hard I try, I think I won’t ever achieve what I achieved before Afghanistan. I’ll never be the same artist, I’ll never have the same talent, the same spirit. It terrifies me that I might not be who I used to be.”
"Sure, John. At least now I can look at you without wanting to kick your nuts off, so that's a good sign."
Sherlock felt relief at Lestrade's reply, Lestrade couldn't know. He didn't want him to listen to John's voice, he didn't want him to realise that it was all Sherlock's fault, he didn't want to see the hate in Lestrade's eyes as he listened to John's testimony.
Sherlock looked at him with an expression John couldn't quite understand. It was like a mix of anger with pain. He didn't say anything for a while. Then he was expressionless again and looked so... Greaser-like. "We can't finish something that never had a start." He said sharply.
It wasn’t a possibility now, it wasn’t a question. It was simply a universal truth: something that was never meant to happen and never would.
But he felt his arm being grabbed and he was forced to face the greaser again. His face flinched as he felt pain in his back. "Sorry, but you have to listen to me, John."
John tried to ignore the thoughts that were invading his head while he was holding the greaser's hand, who as soon as walked by some guys looking at the LPs let go of it. John missed the touch instantly and turned to look at Sherlock, who now seemed a little uncomfortable.
John smiled weakly. "Yes, that's right. Over..." He looked up to the ceiling, thoughtfully. "A year was it?"
No. That was stupid. He had his own style and he was happy with it. He had learned to love it. He had explored it and analyzed it and over analyzed it. He studied the paintings from the absolute best, and he loved their need to resemble reality.
John was angry, but not surprised, this was what Sherlock always did. He thought it was useless to argue, and he couldn't deny he loved solving crimes with his best friend.
“Oh, I think it does.”Victor said possessively, hunger hiding behind his voice tone. “See, I can’t picture you and that nerd boy you brought with you yesterday together. But you and I, we just…
He found Sherlock. He was stepping over Sherlock's blood and he couldn't breathe. He desperately reached down to touch his wrist, but as fast as he appeared he vanished. And John stood alone in the ground of St. Bart's, the blood beneath his feet as the only memory of the detective, the people had disappeared and now it was just him, looking up and seeing the rain falling and washing up the blood and he didn't dare to look down because he couldn't stand the fact Sherlock wouldn't be there now...
Finally, John broke the silence that had settled. "So yeah, I'm fine." He said as if he had never stopped talking.
John realized she might have gotten it the wrong way. "No, no, no!" He said moving his hands in the air. "That's not what I meant to say! We are not
Sherlock sped up, moving on mere instinct as John wrapped his hand over his cock and started tugging the foreskin.
"No, Sherlock, that's not what I want! What I want is to make you feel conscious of the mistakes you've made! I thought that damn accident would end it all, but you're still the same stupid little boy you've always been. What a disappointment."
"Dr. Watson? Why don't we start from the end, so we can identify the root of the problem in your brain?"
"I've tried, Harry. But he won't talk to me. And that is fine too, I understand it. He wants to stay as far as possible. But that we're no longer... John and Sherlock doesn't mean that I don't care about him anymore."
After staying silent for a moment, Sherlock turned to look at John and placed his hand on his cheek and suddenly John shuddered and forgot what he was angry about and never wanted to let go of that hand. "I am sorry, John."
“I am not. I simply don’t see why we’re wasting so much time we could be using teaching me how not to be an absolute and complete failure”, he snarled.
John dropped his Chinese sticks, moved his chair with all the strength he could gather and stood up.
Sherlock couldn’t turn to look at John, he focused on the painting and stared at it, taking in every single detail, it was beautiful.
"No. I do believe you. Maybe I'm the only person who you have opened yourself to, and I love that. But I simply feel like I know nothing about you, and the more time I spend with you, the more I see you like a mystery. And I hate that."
Sherlock sighed and looked at the Greasers standing behind them, at a fair distance. He rolled his eyes at them and they laughed. John felt incredibly uncomfortable, and then the boy turned to face him, still looking irritated, as if talking to John was the most unfortunate thing in the world. "I think you know exactly where."
He had been discharged minutes later, and he couldn't look at John one last time to make sure that he was aware of their unspoken promise. It had been 72 hours since then.
"Great!" John lied with a nod. Molly seemed pleased enough with the answer and didn't push the matter any longer. John sat and tried to make conversation. "So... what are you talking about?"
John didn’t reply. He simply tossed the paper back on his bag and left, terrified his voice might give him away. He walked out of the classroom and closed his eyes, taking deep breaths, feeling his legs weak. He told himself he wasn’t going to cry but couldn’t help it. The tears started streaming down his face and there was nothing he could do to stop them. He left the hall as fast as he could, unaware of the fact Sherlock had stood up, taken his bag and was standing behind him as soon as he started crying.
"WATSON, WHAT IS YOUR DAMN PROBLEM! SHIT I'M TIRED OF WAITING!" Sherlock entered to the chemistry club classroom, opening the door abruptly and interrupting Molly, who was talking to John and blushed immediately. He looked at Sherlock surprised.
Deep profound complex beautiful. John felt he could saw a thousand different oceans drawing themselves in Sherlock’s eyes.
John couldn’t do so at first. He didn’t get the curve of the lashes right, and he’d take over and over the eraser, with an annoyed expression on his face. He was deeply focused on his task, his tongue sticking out the corner of his mouth and with a frown. He looked adorable.
Then he listened to a massive gasp from the people holding the cameras and shoving the microphones, and a voice screaming through the crowd. “Let me come through! Jesus Christ would you just let me walk?”
John coughed, loud enough to wake Sherlock up. Sherlock blinked and turned to look at him with a small twitch of his lips drawing on his face.
Melissa rolled her eyes. “I’ve followed his blog for a while. Something didn’t quite fit into your death. I knew you were alive. I was simply expecting your return.”
Greg took him and pushed him slowly back to his seat. "No way, you're staying Sherlock. Find me the criminal and I shall leave you in peace."
He couldn’t put them into paper. No matter how he tried, they were too abstract, as if they were dangling in the air, but too far from Sherlock’s reach. His head was roaming everywhere, but his hand couldn’t work it out, couldn’t make his mind speak.
It took less effort to John in order to find his voice. He looked down and then looked up to Sherlock, and started breathing hard before asking, "who are you?"
John shook his head, "not terribly. The hardest thing to control was the headache by the overexposure to memories, but it was only temporary. My head's still a bit sore, though."
"...but then you came back, and things got better. I don't know what you did or how you did it, Sherlock, but he couldn't resist, he just couldn't, he missed it so much, he loved being back on the track again. He missed you. You changed him, and even though a part of me hates you for making him go through that hell during those two years, now you're back and my brother is happy and we talk again and it's all because of you."
The tick tock of the clock was endless, painful. Every passing second was like a drum hitting on his brain, and how could he not keep count when
John remembered the conversation he had with Greg and smiled. "I missed you today. Don't skip class ever again."
Almost desperately, he reached for the next pill and put it inside his mouth until it dissolved. Nothing. Except...
So yes, Harry's laughter only raised Mr Watson's suspicions and by the end of the dinner he was clearly considering the implications of his daughter dating a greaser. Sherlock saw that and started giggling. John nudged him and he shut up and said "Sorry."
Sherlock leaned against the headboard and stood over the covers, looking at John intently, who wouldn't take his eyes off him. Finally John broke the spell and moved the covers a bit, as he moved aside as well. "Come here", was all he said.
As soon as they were in the room again, Sherlock turned on the record player and rock n' roll started playing louder than before. John turned to look at Sherlock with a frown. The greaser rolled his eyes. "Mycroft
"Don't", was all John replied, taking deep breaths and doing his best to try to calm down, his hands were shaking, why were they shaking. "Please, Sherlock, don't say anything."
And standing in a narrow hallway, with dim light and dark walls, Sherlock couldn't help but think no one would ever relate this to an artist.
to my house to take Harry, remember? Why did you do that? You were drunk! Something could have happened!"
"Thank you John, thank you so much. Mm... Would you please tell him that if he is going to call he does it at about five or six, before my dad arrives home."
Sherlock had to admit that the brushstrokes were actually impressive. He never saw that kind of statements in classicists.
He had felt lost. It was the only way he could put it. While he was growing up he constantly dreamt of that magical moment when one of his paintings would be unveiled at a museum, when the newspapers talked about the new artist that was defying all the previous avant-gardes, when all the artists around him admired him and loved his work.
"Really?" Mycroft asked skeptically. He was silent for a moment and smiled once again. "Even John Watson?"
It felt like it had been ages. Sherlock missed John with raw intensity. He placed his hands in John's hips, softly. John kept kissing him over and over and over. It was different from all the other times they had kissed, it was tainted with despair, tainted with pain, but also brightened with hope, or perhaps Sherlock was just imagining that.
“Nothing. Sit, watch and enjoy. I want to see the look in your eyes”, she walked towards him, “and then, if you’re too sad, I can erase him from your mind too.”
Although he had to admit his... Friends made good deals. They got him the latest album of Bill Haley & His Comets at a very good price, not to say illegal, but that wasn't important. He got up, took his record player, and
“You’ve been painting”, John said as he walked towards them and inspected them closely. They were beautiful. Incomplete and far too…academic for John’s liking but they showed all the genius inside of Sherlock.
Mr Watson looked at him suspiciously but nodded. "Dinner's ready. Grab a seat." He turned towards the dining room.
be angry, Sherlock had just brought out all of his insecurities and splayed them right in the open air, and he had been sharp and slightly offensive, but John’s main thought wasn’t any of those, his main thought was
Sherlock gasped in surprise. John held him with the same determination and care he had done last night. “Thank you”, John whispered against Sherlock’s neck, “thank you for last night. I hate having to leave but I’ve got to. I’ll see you later tonight okay? As soon as I’m done I’ll come back here, if that’s fine for you.”
Sherlock laughed, "Well, John, you always run that risk. I promise that I won't be too harsh on you this time."
Sherlock looked up in surprise, Lestrade was staring at him with a fearful expression, mixed with a bit of disappointment and Sherlock could tell that Lestrade knew exactly what was going through his mind. Sherlock raised and enquiring eyebrow and Lestrade turned to look at Sherlock's arm. Sherlock's eyes followed his gaze and he realised he had been scratching his left arm, just above the wrist, and the need had become so unbearable that he had drawn blood out of it. He pulled his shirt sleeve back down, he didn't remember having pulling it up in the first place. He cleared his throat, but didn't know what to say.
"Because I do!, I just do! now please, tell everyone from security, and all the people you know who were involved with her. We have to be very careful."
"I love who?" John replied immediately without second thoughts, after considering it for a moment, he remembered. "Oh...
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’ve told you how I see the human body, it is merely a musical composition, an artistic piece to be admired. Whenever a human body appears in my brain it’s like when there’s a song you’re caught up on and whose lyrics and melody you can’t let go.”
“Dying as a failure was never an option, but after that coming back wasn’t one either. Coming back as a broken, idiotic man? A man who didn’t trust his senses nor his brain anymore? The only thing that pushed me to come back was, well, it was you.”
John's gaze turned towards Sarah, a brunette girl with a pretty, pink lace dress and a nice hair up-do, who smiled at John and nodded, raising her eyebrows towards him. John had seen her before, she used to pick Molly up after chemistry club, but didn't see any subject with her. He smiled back, then the words settled on his mind:
He could hear John’s intake of breath before their lips joined. John kissed him back. It was a sweet, soft touch of their lips.
Before Mycroft could answer, Sherlock's phone sounded again. They both directed their looks to the object lying in the table. Sherlock sat in John's chair without saying a word. Mycroft smirked: "What an interesting sound Sherlock! I hadn't heard it in
He saw Sherlock outside the house, smoking a damn cigarette. John put on his sweater and went out. The greaser looked so good.
Lestrade frowned, turning to look at Sherlock, who had his eyes fixed on the duvet that covered him. "Who?", he asked, confused, "John? Of course he is, he's filling the forms to leave."
No way back, no trace left. No blog, no adventures, it might have never happened. He might have never been saved, he might have never saved John's life. Nothing. Nothing to be remembered about.
Sherlock looked around, they were not inside the hotel room anymore but on the hallway, just outside. How long had he blacked out for? He couldn’t quite remember. In all honesty, he couldn’t remember much before he blacked out.
Of course they had, of course, things had been left crystal clear, yet John didn't want to assume that truth just yet, he didn't want to think about it. Even though it was stupid and pretty obvious they were done he didn't want to
. I don't want to keep trying to turn my back to this and pretend that nothing's happening because we both know that we're dying inside. I can see it," he pointed at John's left eye. "Right there, your eyes say it all. So I needed to say it. Because I don't want to see you suffer and hell knows I've suffered enough. But not with you. I don't know how you do it but I'm not scared of loving you. Because I do. And I'm certain of it, more than I have ever been in my life."
John stood up and closed his eyes once again, shutting them off forcefully, his face forming a grimace of pain, a pain so intense he had to bite his lip to resist the urge to groan. Before he could stop himself, Sherlock reached for his arm and touched it. "Are you sure you're feeling fine?"
Sherlock nodded, his jaw caressing John's hair. "I am now." He gathered enough strength to smile at John widely. John simply looked at him with a deep softness in his eyes.
Harry frowned, but kept smiling. "Fine, you can take booze out of me, doesn't make it less obvious."
I'm really sorry for taking so long to update, I've just kind of been stuck on a writer's block, but hopefully everything will fall back into place once again. Promise the next update will be up soon, thank you so much for your comments and kudos, they mean the world to me.
Sherlock snorted and rolled his eyes. "My brother, my parents are almost never home so he feels like the king of the house."
He arrived early and looked around, no sign of the greaser nor of his brainless friends. He took his English book out of the locker and went to the classroom with a sigh.
Mrs Hudson kept smiling widely. John returned the smile and said "Well, we have a project to do, so..."
Sherlock took his hand and examined it carefully. “It hasn’t trembled at all”, he whispered, as he ran his fingertips over John’s knuckles.
Sherlock! After the incident of that morning he had only one thought in his mind: to get away from him as much as possible, to remain only as work partners, because they were
Sherlock hated admitting it, but he felt relieved. Mycroft promised to keep all his minions aware of Baker Street and its surroundings, even more so than usual. His brother's voice sounded somewhat amused since he picked up the phone, somehow as if he knew everything that had happened between John and Sherlock the night before just from listening to his little brother's voice.
"Here it says. He's messenger at Lacuna. The one in charge of sending the cards and the records. Started working there a month before Alice's death."
"That's all? We hadn't known anything about her for three years and all she has to say is 'Good Morning'?"
John cleared his throat and looked down. “Not yet, but I’m almost on my way. I have a shift at the clinic.”
Raising an eyebrow in surprise, Sherlock examined the tape, it didn't have any title or anything, and the tape hadn't been so used. He took a small tape recorder he had stolen from Lestrade some years ago, and curiously pressed play, sitting on his chair and wondering what could be so important that Mycroft's minions had kept a record of.
"A topic in which we are going to base all our semester of work in History! So yes! It's a damn big responsibility."
"Don't be silly John, you can stay at my room tonight if you want to" -Sherlock looked at him with a small smile in his face, he couldn't say no, he simply couldn't.
"No. I don't think that me not being with him would depress him. I think that having an alcoholic sister, parents who only care about his grades, an abusive father and an unhappy mother would." As soon as he closed his mouth he realized he had crossed the line.
He arrived to the corner of the building where teachers rarely passed by when he found Jim, Sebastian and Greg. Both Jim and Sebastian were laughing while Greg just rolled his eyes at them and smoked silently. Sherlock felt the anger rising to his head and he wanted to kick Jim's ass. Because this was all his freaking fault. Now everything was ruined.
"Shut up, Holmes." He said, smiling shyly. His head was burning and, without a single doubt, he was blushing.
“And then you licked your lips. I should have known. I should have known but I didn’t and I told you I was married to my work. And that was it.”
As soon as he saw the police taking the tape off he felt a bit disappointed, because this was the only way John had to still catch the last glimpses of that mysterious Sherlock, whose brain worked unstoppable, who
Sherlock smiled and ordered the coffees, and as soon as they were delivered, they left. John could tell by the greaser's expression that he wanted to stay there, and he was tempted to leave him there, but he wanted to spend as much time with Sherlock as possible.
And he felt lonely, more than ever. He had Mike and he was a nice friend and accepted him no matter what, but he really didn't trust him, he started feeling like he really needed to find someone to talk to, someone to express all his frustrations to, someone who would understand, someone who would accept. But he didn't have that. Not even his sister Harry would listen to him, she was too busy thinking about Clara for that. He really felt the need to find a friend. But how?, who?
"Did you need anesthesia?" Sherlock asked, hoping the answer would be yes. He raised his chain defiantly, he couldn't allow his facade to fall, he had to remain cold and stoic, now was not the time to pay attention to his emotions.
The brushes were filled with dust and his palette needed a change but it didn’t matter right now. As soon as he opened the yellow paint the smell invaded his senses.
"No, John", Sherlock said pushing him back towards the bed. "You'll stay here. Your leg needs healing."
Sherlock nodded, a small smile in his face. “West London? I’m in Central London, so it’s on its way”, he said walking already to the doors.
Sherlock walked towards his room and found John smiling at him through half-lidded eyes. "Hey", John said with a smile.
He dragged a deep breath as Sherlock pulled his trousers down, caressing his skin over the fabric of his pants.
John took a deep breath while he was standing in front of the door of the house of the crime scene. Sherlock turned to look at him, worry drawing in his expression. "Are you sure you want to enter, John?"
He put down the violin and didn't look at John, just stared at the window. "Why did you call my brother?"- he sounded so angry, he couldn't even pretend he wasn't, John felt the tone of his voice and felt alarmed. He really thought he was helping Sherlock by calling Mycroft. Apparently, it hadn't been his best choice.
Sherlock pretended he didn't hear John, turned his back against the boy and started typing. "We should start fast, it's getting late." He said seriously, changing the topic completely.
Without looking at him, and focused on his cigarette, Sherlock answered seriously. "Unless it's the history project, I'm not interested." He threw the cigarette to the floor, then he glanced at John, shook his head and moved to walk towards the crime scene.
"I'm still a little hungover, John. I really want to sleep."- they had just finished eating and Harry, well, she looked terrible, she looked very tired and her eyes were lost. Still, it was very, very unusual from her to go to sleep so early.
by Robert Traver. He was dying to read this book. He looked at John, who had his eyes fixed on him, expectantly. Sherlock grinned. "Wow John, thank you. This is... Thank you."
"You", he replied without hesitation. He looked at Sherlock intently and seriously, his gaze fixed on Sherlock's eyes.
"You will leave, John. It won't work out, you'll meet someone else, or maybe I will. This will never,
Sherlock went to the living room and looked at John with surprise, he had his eyes closed, but didn't seem to be sleeping, so he came closer, bent and whispered: "John?"
Sherlock turned to look at John for a moment. "Yes", he looked up again. "Yes, it is." A distant memory popped into his head.
John looked down and stared at their hands for a moment. Sherlock did so too. They fitted perfectly, somehow. Sherlock wanted to draw them, right there and then.
Sherlock stared at the painting for another while, detailing the heavy brushstrokes surrounding the landscape, as if they were a statement, as if this John Watson needed to scream something he couldn't say aloud.
The greaser widened his eyes and turn to look at John, who in response shook his head and rolled his eyes. "WHAT?". Sherlock turned to look at the teacher again. "Sir, I enjoy working on my own, actually I hate working with somebody, anybody, so please, let me do this on my own."
Greg went to the back as well and turned to place a confused stare towards Sherlock, who remained still and silent. Suddenly, rock n' roll started to fill the environment, really,
He went through the posts before that and after an hour of memories, he simply broke down. How could he ever write something that could compare to those text posts? He had lost Sherlock, and with him had gone all the adventures and the experiences and the laughter and the crimes and maybe he should go with him as well...
“You had a nightmare”, Sherlock said, staring fixedly at him. John had moved away so they weren’t that close, but still, the tension was quite palpable.
"But I have to pee!", John said walking towards the bathroom. "Be right back. Don't worry, I won't escape."
He climbed under the covers and moved closer to Sherlock, a need to feel the warmth of his skin, the scent of his hair.
He didn’t notice when John had shifted closer in the couch, just slightly. Or perhaps he had, but his brain hadn’t processed it.
Sherlock smiled, it seemed as if he had a naked model in front of him, but he really wasn’t painting anyone in particular. He didn’t need models for his paintings. He grew up reading Greek myths and marveling on the image of their gods, he knew exactly which were the perfect proportions for a man’s body, and so he spent his whole career trying to reproduce that perfection, trying to find it in his drawings. He never found it. Hadn’t found it yet. That was the problem with growing up reading Greek myths, it set unrealistic expectations of the world: the world wasn’t so interesting. The real world was…disappointing, boring, predictable.
He widened his eyes and turned to look at John, scribbling down on a piece of paper the message. John looked at him curiously with a frown. “What if the threats are not for them but for us?”
He knew Mike was a fine photographer. They had gone to art school together and had been friends back then. Mike didn’t find success as fast as John did, but now he was starting to gain recognition. The collection was about the artists and their studios, and it wanted to show that, just as romance made people unromantic, it seemed like an artists’ studio made artists so unartistic. People were captivated by the gallery.
Sherlock stood still for a moment, trying to understand what Lestrade had told him, then he pushed his feelings aside and forced himself to act normal. "Oh, I thought you... you know, went for pints once in a while or something, chat up and laughed. Don't know why, always pictured it that way."
Sherlock finally turned to look at John, his expression unreadable. “Congratulations”, he replied, “you have your first painting to be featured at the gallery”.
can you believe it? She said she has to think things through but she needs space. I lost her." She said, losing control of her tears as they rolled down her face.
John leaned closer and before Sherlock could even process it, placed a kiss on Sherlock’s forehead. It lasted less than a second, but Sherlock felt as if time had stopped completely altogether.
John threw him a quick smile and entered the house, the greaser yelled. "John! This way!" So the boy went upstairs.
Sherlock cleared his throat. John hadn't realized yet where he was trying to steer the conversation to. "Erm- I was thinking, actually I was merely considering, for a moment, not that I've been spending a big amount of time on it, or, but-"
"A woman was found dead in the Thames Dock, no signs of contusion. We couldn't find other trace of DNA, no fingerprints, anything. We don't have a clue. We talked to her family, she didn't have any known enemies. Oh, and there was a message written on his abdomen."
"What the hell did you tell him, Mycroft?!" Sherlock yelled from the kitchen, moving his hands in the air and looking at his brother who was on the front door, lifting his eyebrow and looking as calm as always.
John closed his eyes and looked down, trying to ignore the increasing pain in his right leg and the tremor in his left hand. Damn it, if he kept like this, he'd have to go back to the cane.
Sherlock pushed past her and ran towards office 512. The elevator was too slow. Why was everything so slow today? The door was closed and Sherlock could tell just from looking at the windows of the entrance that it was all dark, the curtains closed, blocking the light of the sun.
John swallowed, feeling goosebumps all over his body at the contact. Sherlock was looking fixedly at his hand.
He shook the thoughts away from his brain violently, told himself he wasn’t that fucking 14-year old boy anymore and he should just get over with it.
"I don't think that's actually his fault, I think you left this very very clear for him in the exact moment you started to play the back seat bingo with Irene Adler! So don't come to talk to me as if you were the victim! You have been a huge asshole Sherlock!"
His first class of the day was World History. He entered to the building and left out a deep breath. "First day in prison."
John smiled but then covered his smile because he was supposed to be mad at Sherlock. "Sherlock..." He said, trying to come up with something to say, but the greaser interrupted him.
Greg waited for a couple minutes more before he left Sherlock's bedroom. When he came back to the living room and looked at John sitting on his chair he looked at Sherlock with a smile, raising his thumbs up. Sherlock dragged a deep breath and shook his head slightly, Greg's face falling.
"So? What did Watson want?" Jim said looking at his cigarette and twisting it in his fingers as soon as they arrived to a small corner in the back of the building, right next to the grass. Teachers barely passed down there and Sherlock had to accept it was a very good place to smoke. Finally his...friends turned useful for something, even if that meant having to smoke and interact with them.
"Truth is", John said against his chest, "I desperately want to be in this gallery. But I know I'll never be good enough. It will never say enough. I want you to help me. But on my own time, please", he spoke softly, as if the darkness and the wetness and the warmth of the night had allowed his deepest secrets to filter through.
Among many other things, Harry had told John that if the party was supposed to be at seven, people would arrive an hour or so later, but he dismissed it. Honestly, the people Harry went to parties with was quite different from the kind of people who would attend this party, so at 7:15 he was already knocking on Sarah's door.
"That", she said pointing to the brightest part of the painting, "is light". Her fingers moved through the air as if she could touch the painting by doing it so, "and that is darkness."
John started clenching his left hand into a fist, fighting against the tears that were threatening to drown him.
She touched Sherlock's leg and placed her hand there. She whispered to his ear, "You know I could help you with that don't you? Do you want to make him jealous? Do you want to see how much he cares about you?"
Although to be fair, it wouldn’t be the first time that a fan of their blog would develop a psychopathic obsession towards them.
Sherlock asked him to pass him the salt and when John did their fingers brushed. They didn’t comment on it, but the warmth of John’s fingers slowly dragging away from Sherlock’s were enough to send shivers down his spine.
Mycroft raised his gaze from the pile of papers laying on the desk. He stared intently on his assistant. “Yes?”
Sherlock sat, knowing if they had asked him to grab a seat was because he would need to sit down after listening to what they had to say.
"No, I really don't." John said honestly, shaking his head, because he had to admit it was true. Maybe of all people in school, he was the one who had gotten to know the greaser the most, but he didn't know him well enough, he barely knew the tip of the iceberg. There was so much of Sherlock, so much mystery to uncover, and John wanted to know it, and it was frustrating not being able to do so.
"Who the hell do you think you are to tell me what to do and what not to do?" Sherlock said angrily.
He shut his eyes closed and the sounds stopped for a moment. He opened them again, he wasn't buried under the remnants of his car. He was kneeling over the grass. He looked up and the sky grew darker and darker.
He took a deep breath and thought of knocking on the door, but stopped himself and thought it was better not making a scandal. He picked a small rock from the garden and pointed to the window at the right, in the second floor. "Harry, this better be the right window because if your father shows up I swear I'll say you forced me to come in here." Harry didn't react.
“Think about it”, Mike said, looking anything but surprised, perhaps he’d foreseen this outcome. “Just- think about it. You have two months to present your portfolio.”
This world was lonely and sad. And yet surprisingly magnetic. Dragging Sherlock in. Giving him that desperate itch to pain, to discover, to dig further.
"Good." John said and then turned and kept walking. It was his payback. Sherlock had done that before.
She waved her hands in the air. "John! Where the hell were you? My mom has called the whole neighborhood! She even called that friend of yours! The chubby one!"
"From her. She hurt you so much the last time. And you saved her. And you care about her, and you love her. And she loves you and you'll get married and have children. And I'll stay here alone."
John looked at her with a frown. He was used to that, to his sister being that way, so he didn't feel offended, he just knew that was how Harry was. "Oh come on Harry, don't get started with that. "
Sherlock supposed that was perfectly normal, he hadn't taken them in a while, his body was trying to assimilate them. He looked down and blinked, the grass' color seemed more intense than usual. Good, they were working.
"I don't like it down there", John said, not looking at Sherlock either. "Plus, the view is way better from up here."
John nodded and leant down to kiss Sherlock's jaw. Sherlock closed his eyes and held him tight towards him, not caring about the mess they had just made. Eventually, John stood up and brought a tower and cleaned Sherlock thoroughly. He tucked himself into bed, as close to Sherlock as he could manage, wrapping an arm around his torso.
Futurism be damned. This was nothing like it. This was John Watson’s style, pure and complete and unusual and novel and brilliant.
He stood up immediately and considered whether to open the door or not, but whatever it was, it meant that there was something that needed to be addressed urgently, and so he opened it to-
John started to get a feeling as to where this conversation was going and he thought he didn't want to go there. "Mm yes."
Sometimes, memories were associated with smells, with sensations and with sounds rather than with images.
It was stupid, he wasn’t good at drawing figures, he already knew that, and after one class he wouldn’t end up being a Sherlock Holmes or a Da Vinci, but he expected at least
Sherlock stood there, unable to do anything else but stare at John in shock, he still couldn't wrap his mind around what had happened, still couldn't bring himself to believe that John now knew. He closed his eyes. "I'm sorry", Sherlock whispered, "I'm sorry."
"I think I made myself quite clear", Sherlock said, managing to keep the air of superiority in his voice despite the panting.
Sherlock clenched and unclenched the hand which had held John's hand a few seconds ago, hoping the warmth of John's touch wouldn't leave him.
He looked at every single word carefully, stared at it fixedly, constantly wondering whether he had lost his mind and had started hallucinating or something of the sorts.
Her mother sighed. "Don't let it happen again, John. You are a brilliant student. This boy doesn't seem like a good influence in you."
Sherlock had little to no patience, and when three days had passed and John hadn’t attempted any other conversation (and Sherlock wouldn’t attempt for a while either), he started to wonder if he had read too much into that single word.
Harry sighed noisily. "Oh come on Johnny! The guy can take care of himself, he doesn't need a nanny to look after him! I'll be leaving tomorrow and I want a plan for just the two of us!"
"Oh yes! Lestrade just called, there's been a murder. We have to be at Scotland Yard in twenty minutes" -Sherlock grabbed his coat and went towards the door.
(see, not imagine), his face, looking at him closely, taking every detail of John Watson's face his mind palace had forgotten before, tossing the thought away and discarding it for not being relevant enough. Sherlock wouldn't make that mistake again. So he looked, kept looking and storing every blink of John's eyes, every crease and line his face had gained, his puffiness...
colors everywhere, as if he was seeing Van Gogh’s spirals painting themselves by sheer force of love -and lust- alone.
. Harry's smile vanished. "Sorry, wrong time. Don't worry, nothing will happen. We'll spy them from here
"Don't worry, we just came for the coffee. As soon as they give it to us, we'll leave." Sherlock told John as soon as he saw his face.
"Shut up. This isn't helping you, Sherlock. Now, let's try to organise a bit of this mess, we don't want Hawthorne to suspect anything once he comes back", Lestrade said, offering a hand for Sherlock to stand up.
Slowly, Sherlock turned to look at his book, ignoring John. There were so many things John wanted to say, but he didn't say them. After a moment, he realized his presence was no longer desired and he nodded, saying "Right." He stood up to leave, but he realized the greaser's hand still hadn't lost his grip on his wrist. "What the?"
No. Impossible. He hated that. He hated that psychedelic, drug induced, surrealist portrait of reality. Colors didn’t do any good to a painting that wanted to stay true to reality.
He looked at Sherlock, feeling confused. Sherlock was absorbed in what he was drawing, not even realizing that John was staring at him.
Mycroft didn't look amused. He simply replied: "Did he? I never really read it. Quite popular it became."
“Yes. Contrast. Look at the point where your pupil and your iris touch. Look at the contrast there. It’s a soft, yet notable contrast between dark blue and black. See?”
"No it's not, you're thinking where you are going to sleep at. You had a terrible night. I told you so, John, you were going to freeze in the couch. Why didn't you stay at my room? It was perfectly okay with me."
Sherlock looked at him. Finally. But he was reluctant. Awkward. Different. "Johnny Adams and the nightcats."
"You're not", Sherlock recovered his voice as the door was closing, wondering internally why was it that every time the door closed he felt forced to speak up.
He pressed his forehead against John's chest, feeling his rise and fall. His rise and fall. His rise. His fall.
“That’s not an excuse, you didn’t buy new ones since we started our class. You don’t trust in your own ability and therefore would rather not spending money on something you won’t use after we’re done, am I wrong?”
Sherlock chuckled weakly and turned to look at his brother. Mycroft kept his eyes fixed on him as they sat. "Hello, brother."
Her voice startled both John and Sherlock who almost jumped in surprise. Her brother simply shook his head while he replied, "hello to you, Harriet."
He’d have to act but he would have to wait until she was far away from John, enough to assure that she probably wouldn’t hit the target when she aimed, based on her (possible) inexperience on handling a handgun.
"So, I guess I'll see you later, Mr. Holmes." John said with a nod, taking his cane and moving towards the door.
"Yes. Can I help you with something?" Oh right, so now Sherlock didn't know him, of course he didn't, now he was acting as if they never met, and what now? Did John have to pretend like he didn't know Sherlock either? As if he wasn't the new popular boy who had made his week a complete hell?
Sherlock smiled. So John had remembered their conversation as well. Memories of John’s blog and the solar system and their first fight at 221B came flooding to his mind. He also remembered the worry in John’s eyes when he arrived to a blown-up flat the next morning and smiled at it.
John placed a peck under his jaw before pulling away. He stared at Sherlock for a long time, the smile fixed into place.
John turned and Sherlock was behind him, eyes fixed on him. Not smiling, but not exactly serious, a bit less defensive, more open. "...Yes?"
Sherlock nodded as he closed his eyes. He turned and kissed John, John kissed him back eagerly, desperately seeking for the magic and the vivacity and the color of Sherlock’s lips.
As soon as they arrived to the flat, John breathed hard. He turned to look at Sherlock. "Could you explain to me what the
Sherlock started walking to follow her into John's house when John held him by the forearm and pulled him back. "Wait, wait, wait! What do you think you're doing?"
Sherlock woke up to find himself alone. He felt his right side strangely warm, and when the mist of that state between sleeping and awake faded away, he looked at the couch and saw the little dip of the leather fabric and remembered: John had slept there, next to him, nestled against him the whole night.
John opened his eyes as soon as he heard her. Then he closed them down again, trying to swallow the knot on his throat. "Mmm... Yes."
That was definitely not how Sherlock would react. John sighed. He was making one fatal mistake: he was idolizing Sherlock Holmes, he was putting him in a pedestal and never letting him go, admiring him and thinking far too much of him when the truth is that Sherlock is only human. Only flesh and blood, as perishable as anyone else and looking for some kind of redemption, some kind of immortality through his paintings. Didn’t they all look for the same?
John turned to look at nurse Stephens looking at them, her arms crossed. "You're not supposed to be here, Doctor Watson", she said firmly but good-naturedly.
The man tapped on the glass of the window and Sherlock rolled his eyes. Then he put the glass down and the man smiled sarcastically, trying to hide the anger growing in him. If Sherlock hadn't talked about his brother, he would have never imagined it was him. Because that man standing perfectly dressed in a suit at two in the morning looked like the complete opposite from the greaser who was right next to him. "Hello, am I interrupting?"
John went into the hall taking a deep breath and trying to calm himself. His mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, worries and images. He feared for his mother, who was at home with his sister, who last night arrived so late and so wasted she didn't even remember her name. He heard his mother shouting and the click of the door as his father got home, later than his sister.
There was a thin line between art and life. And he had to learn to separate them. Or it could cause him trouble. It could cause them trouble.
"I just... I have to think. I... Can't do this. I just can't, Holmes." John said looking down, not daring to face Sherlock.
The door of room 219 was closed. Sherlock stood in front of it and took a moment to regain his composure.
Greg smiled at John, staring at him for longer than he should, John looked different. Skinnier, paler, shriveled. Then he remembered John had just said his name and frowned, confused. How the hell could John remember him and not remember Sherlock? There was something extremely odd about all of this. "Good evening, John. I was in the neighborhood and I decided to come over and see how you were."
Lestrade faced the detective again. "There wasn't much to talk about anymore. I brought him some cases a few days after, you know, but he said he didn't want to get involved in them anymore. He said it would be best if I left him on his own for a while, but I knew it was definite, he wanted to have nothing to link him back to you, he wanted to leave behind all of it, including us. So, I didn't insist.
Sherlock couldn't do anything but hold onto John's shirt and pull him towards him. He wasn't quite sure about what was a dream and what was a reality. John allowed himself to be pulled. Sherlock placed his face on the crook of John's neck, breathing him in as he felt himself calming down.
On the cab there was some awkward silence, Sherlock was thinking and John was still too angry to say anything.
"Goodnight Sherlock!"- she said very loud, Sherlock was sitting in the sofa, hands together below his chin. Thinking, as always. He didn't answer. She waved her hand at John and went into his room. He felt a little nervous. What to say now?
to see John. Finally he nodded, "just, promise me that you'll let me know as soon as the files arrive."
Sherlock was progressively losing the hope he had gained a few moments ago. "Please, John. Just let me talk to you."
Clara came from the backyard (and no signs of Harry) running and yelling "STOP THE MUSIC NOW AND SHUT THE FUCK UP!"
Harry and John laughed when a sound cut the happiness of the moment. Harry opened her eyes and looked at Sherlock.
Tom came back from the kitchen and took a seat next to Molly, holding her hand. "Looking good, John."
“I know that feeling, John. I got bored and I ran away too, I found shelter in something easier to acquire than a recruitment to Afghanistan, though.”
"Oh!" She said, surprised. "I see!" And Sherlock felt a bit scared and regretted opening his mouth. "So,
"...because I don't remember quite well what happened. But it's nothing criminal or anything, so don't worry."
Sherlock smiled widely and spent the rest of the class teaching John about new artists and songs and LPs, and John decided he had never enjoyed a History class as much as he enjoyed this.
“Of course it is, John. And you’re perfectly capable of doing it. You’ve proved yourself better than you thought you were in these classes, haven’t you?”
was never in his vocabulary, well, it still wasn't, but he used to handle so much more. And he was bored, lots of girls had sat right next to him and asked him to have a dance but he shook his head and kept drinking. He felt sad and didn't know why.
After that dreadful conversation, he just sprawled on the couch and closed himself from the outer world, until the phone got him out of his daze.
Did John pass by? Did he see him in here? Connected to the oxygen and probably receiving an equally high dosage of Naloxone in order to control the overdose? Or did he simply leave him here and decided to be apart from him? How did he find him? Why did he find him? Did Sherlock say anything to him? Did he look at him, with his low blood pressure and his slow breaths and thought he'd die? Did it hurt to see him like that? Does he hate him right now? Will he come back to check on him?
The view was incredibly sad. A woman was lying on the studio, with a gunshot in her forehead. There was blood everywhere and her head had landed over the typewriter.
He felt lost and could feel the PTSD dragging him back in. He breathed deeply, as he identified the first symptoms of a panic attack approaching. He dug his nails into the palms of his hands and walked towards the only place he knew, the only place he could think of, the only place his mudded brain could remember: 221B Baker Street.
He bent down in a rush and picked up the bag. He took it in his hands, examined it and opened it. The purple one would do. Just one. Only one little pill.
Sherlock looked at him enquiringly once again. His face and his lips were deliciously blushed and John smiled without even realizing he was, because he looked absolutely stunning. He raised an eyebrow, staring at John, and John nodded. As soon as he did, Sherlock pulled his pants down.
Sherlock really had to resist the temptation to roll his eyes. He should have gone out with Lestrade. He tried to come up with an excuse but his mind was dozing off. Well, that was a first.
He put a fist on his mouth, closing his eyes and trying to gather some strength to carry on with the recording.
Standing in front of the door, Greg wondered if Sherlock had already talked to John, perhaps he would see them again, sitting on their chairs, chatting while having tea. He really hoped he could see them again like that. He was curious to know John's reaction, for him if had been the biggest shock of his life. He couldn't even begin to imagine how John Watson would feel after seeing the detective alive.
Jim turned to face Sherlock and looked at him up and down, before replying. "I don't understand what you're fighting about. You were the one who drove the boy into our path."
Sherlock shook his head and stood up, this time looking at him with that scary gaze the greaser knew to pull well so much. "We're not here to talk about me, are we?"
? So Sherlock Holmes prefers doing homework than catching up with his buddies! What a party pooper!"
“That was going to be my last stop before London”, Sherlock said in a tone as low as John’s. “I had worked so hard and I had done so well up until then and I was so close to home and then I was simply close to death.”
If someone were to ask Sherlock how he would have imagined  John's quarters to look like, he would have replied that they could be messy and a bit disheveled, but they would be
"Yes. I'll be there in a moment, I'll just go and put these books in the locker and I'll see you at the restaurant, okay?"
Harry decided to change the subject, the opportunity was given, she was going to take it. "So, Sherlock, you slept with John last night..." She realized the best thing she could do was going straight to the point. Sherlock nodded, looking confused. "...What happened?"
"Excuse me?" John said, clearly confused, that same face he once did when Sherlock asked him if Afghanistan or Iraq.
damn problem, Holmes?" John said rising his voice and coming closer to Sherlock, who was standing next to the door. The rest of the classroom looked a the greaser, stunned by having one of those guys at their classroom.
Melissa looked up as she saw Sherlock approaching. She had just hung up the phone and was wearing a smile on her face, which vanished as soon as he faced him. Sherlock softly smiled at her as a salute.
After hearing the police’s investigation and how much they appreciated his help and another endless banter he was too busy ignoring, he found himself alone, on the small suite he had rented in Brussels.
Sherlock went to the window and stared at it for a long time. Last time he had looked through it, he had found three red letters painted with graffiti on the windows:
John stopped laughing and covered his mouth. “Yes, of course you are. Sorry”, he said bending over and placing a chaste kiss on Sherlock’s lips, a kiss which actually rendered him speechless.
"I was taken other two times to rehab, but it never worked, it didn't. It was agony, I had to face the same four walls, I felt trapped, my brain was draining and all I had was rock and roll music. And it healed me somehow, well temporarily at least. It's always temporary, isn't it?" His face suddenly lit up a bit, recalling an experience. "Until I met Scotland Yard."
John laughed. “Of course you’re not, you posh git. Still you would have made a perfect Baroque composition, you know? The moment when you reached the climax of the song, that would have been the perfect moment of drama for Baroque artists. I could almost see the chiaroscuro drawing around you.”
John opened his eyes at the touch and yanked his arm away from Sherlock. Even though the story seemed quite plausible, there was something which seemed completely off about the whole case. "Yes, I'm fine. What did you OD with?"
"We could also look at her scar. Ask her if she remembers something about the procedure, or the reason why she ended up working here", Sherlock continued, his brain working at a hundred miles per hour.
The greaser sat (more like sprawled)  right next to John in the sofa and closed his eyes, smiling. John looked at him and couldn't help but smile too, that until the song started playing. The guitar solo of the beginning gave John the first clue that a. This wasn't better than Mozart and b. He wasn't going to like this. But he never thought he would dislike it that much until he heard the lyrics. It was Chuck Berry's
As he left just after Hikes he realized Sherlock was nowhere near to be seen. He frowned. He had no idea why, but he was expecting to see the greaser waiting for him by the lockers. He felt a little disappointed.
He didn’t catch any sleep at night, focused on how to solve that conundrum. It was not possible that two hands so seemingly alike could at the same time say so many different things. He stared at them for hours, and erased them and drew them again and yet they still looked like they did on the very first try.
He didn't want to look at the window, but once his eyes settled on it he realised it had been cleared, which was a huge relief, because he thought he wouldn't be able to face that sight again.
She approached Sherlock and placed a hand on his shoulder. "Oh dear, I'm so sorry. You-" she trailed off, her voice quivering. "No." She said, shaking his head. "How could have he forgotten about you? That's not possible!"
"Really? Why?" She looked at him suspiciously. How the hell did she manage to sort things out so easily? This girl was smart!
John didn't know how to answer that. He was still a bit shocked, but he guessed it made sense, Harry and Sherlock had been laughing at each other the whole dinner. "Um.. I...Well... Do you?" Was all John managed to say.
Sherlock imagined he was…different. He imagined him older, crazier perhaps? He imagined him leading a tormented existence that he could only reproduce in his paintings. But no, this John Watson looked quite young, and he looked surprisingly happy, surprisingly calm.
And so he held him, he held him, he held him, until the sobbing subsided. Until John stopped shaking and panting, until he seemed like he had gained all the composure he had lost.
What else could he paint about? The idea of painting London had simply come from the atmosphere of 221B, for it carried the essence of what London was, of what it represented: the mix of the old and the new, the classical and the modern, the scent of tea mixed with oils and turpentine, the light rain crashing against the window. Sherlock. Sherlock painting the human body. It felt like
John didn't reply, he just looked at her in disbelief. It was so hard believing in her, how could she love someone like Sherlock Holmes? He didn't have a good feeling about it.
A familiar voice saluted him over the phone. He widened his eyes in surprise as he heard it. "What is it now?"
John knew better than that, he didn't believe a word of what he said. Not one. "You saved her life..."
matched Alice’s. No one else’s. We confiscated and inspected every knife we found in his apartment and found none in his office. Sherlock, he didn’t kill all those people.”
And Sherlock smiled, a quick rise of his mouth, and John could see it, and he realized that was the first time he saw the greaser smiling for real, not faking it. This one was genuine, he tried to smile back but he couldn't so they just stood silent for a moment. An awkward moment.
Greg rubbed his forehead. They had reached the cafeteria. He looked at Sherlock for a moment and the sight helped him make a decision. "I'll see what I can do. You stay here." He said, pointing at him with his finger, enunciating an unspoken menace.
"Look, I was feeling confused and annoyed. I think it's no secret for you that Irene's message took me by surprise. But, of course you are my best friend, John, I think it's obvious"
him, for God’s sake!, he thought he was doing the right thing, wasn’t that what he was supposed to do? He wanted to help John, to save him, to rescue him from himself and the memories that haunted him.
John got inside the bed. It was so warm, and he could smell Sherlock's cologne. It smelled delicious. It smelled like him. He was barely aware of the fact that he was sharing the bed with Sherlock. The detective, on the other hand, moved further from him, keeping his distance. John hated that, he wanted to be closer and closer. He felt so far away from him.
"Did someone say that to you?" Sherlock's voice tone raised, and he looked clearly nervous and uncomfortable.
Sherlock frowned. "Oh? He is? Well, if I had to tell you about the boy I have to work with, he is a real pain in the ass."
John touched his forearm, just the softest of touches, to bring a bit of comfort through the misty cloud of pain and sedatives, before saying, "I have got to go."
Sherlock seemed to realize the way John looked at him and smiled smugly at him. "Better?", he asked in that seductive, deep voice John found so irresistible.
John looked at him. Sherlock had opened his mouth and somehow his brain had taken over it, he didn’t know what he was saying, he didn’t know if he was saying all of what he thought or just what John should know, he didn’t know because the mental picture was too big, was clouding his mind palace.
The tickles stopped and John realized he missed the touch of Sherlock's fingers in his body, also they were standing so close John could feel the warmth of Sherlock's jacket. "You take
John sighed. "Why, why of all places here?" He thought it would be too stupid not to get in there, anyway it's not like he had brilliant memories of this place. He stood in front of the door, thinking if it was a good idea. Finally, he entered and took the seat by the window, he liked the view of it.
John shook his head. "I'm bloody exhausted of staying here, doing nothing, feeling like a fucking creep-!"
Sherlock closed his eyes at the information, not knowing what to do now. Hawthorne and Melissa exchanged worried glances, since Sherlock didn't mutter a single word, didn't say anything else.
He stood up and left. John felt confused, he knew Sherlock was a drama queen, but this was different, he wasn't faking it, Irene's message caught him off guard and brought him back to reality. Something wasn't right. Sherlock knew how to hide his feelings perfectly. But that message seemed to change something within him, John didn't know what, but that wasn't the Sherlock Holmes he used to know. This was some kind of hurt, shocked, surprised Sherlock Holmes.
There is no comeback for him. He knew it. It was not meant to happen. He lost it, he lost it all. Sherlock could bring the spark back into his life, his illusions and hopes and ideas and inspiration, but he certainly could not bring his talent back. Society had too many expectations set on him, and after the painting that made it to the Tate came…nothing. Nothing at all. It’s been ten years and still…nothing. Death and pain and loss but no new paintings. He was ethereal, instantaneous, removable, disposable, forgettable. And it hurts him and it kills him to think about it. When he was young he used to think it’d be nice if humanity would remember him, or if at least one decent human being would remember his legacy, but now he knows he’s condemned to be forgotten, to die, to rot in the past, in the shining of greater times, of the time that never was. We all live and we all die. It was unbearable to think that he’d die in everyone’s memories as well.
Irene winked at him. "Ask Sherlock for it". Harry smiled and turned her face to John who was looking at her with a frown that could only possibly mean
But it was a lie, because there were a thousand unspoken words in his mouth, ready to be acknowledged, but no, not now. Now was not the right time.
When he was staring at a dead body laying on the ground. When he was seeing said body being pulled into a gurney, being pulled away from him, feeling all his breath leaving him.
Hawthorne said sitting up straight. "Well, these gentlemen were quite the pair, weren't they? An odd match, certainly, but seemed to work fantastically well together. That Holmes seemed like a proper genius, it's a shame he met that fate, but Dr. Watson certainly had to endure a very difficult loss. It's understandable, although I still have my doubts about the nature of their friendship. This is a wonderful blog, and I'm sorry but we have to delete it", Hawthorne remained quiet for a while but frowned, turning back to Melissa, "who on earth hasn't watched a Bond movie?"
She shrugged. “He is not a celebrity. He just used to have a very popular blog in which he wrote cases he lived with Sherlock Holmes.”
He then shook the thought away. John didn't have his number. Plus, why would he expect John to do that? He was a fool.
Later they finally decided to go back to the apartment, where Harry was expecting them. She was holding a glass of wine in her hand. She looked positively drunk. Sherlock entered to the living room while John locked the door.
“Ever since I remember, I always liked it”, Sherlock replied and then he turned his attention towards his phone.
Sherlock kept thinking about how much the environment in the house had changed in the moment Mr Watson had walked in. With one glance he could see he was conservative, strict and tried to hide his alcoholism unsuccessfully. John had himself told him a few things about that, but it was completely different standing in front of him. He was an intimidating man, and although small, seemed very strong and very authoritarian. Mrs Watson must be really afraid of him, he thought.
He had acted on impulses most of the time when it came to John, he simply couldn’t help it. Ever since he looked at that masterpiece at the Tate Modern, he realized that life in such a way was nothing but a lie. Sometimes impulses were as necessary as pure logic.
They stopped at the fifth floor. Lestrade stepped out and just as Sherlock was about to step out he noticed John turning to look at his hands and blinking as if waking up from a daze and immediately letting it go while he looked everywhere but at Sherlock and he rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly.
It would look 20 years older, wearing a dark expression, filled with dismay, with pain, but most of all, with fright. It was only bound to get worse, it was only bound to look older and darker and grimier.
John was staring at him, a soft smile in his face, a smile which turned into a frown of worry as Sherlock grimaced in pain. "You okay?", he asked softly.
"That's because you are a little crazy. And addicted to danger. And you know him better than everyone else. But, which sane person would?"
John didn't smile, thought, he started eating -it was his favorite Chinese dish after all- and remained silent. Sherlock had served some from him as well, but had eaten nothing of it.
John looked down, breathing hard. He stood like that for a while, with his eyes closed and trying to not lose control. Finally, he looked up. "How long?", he asked. "For how long were 'you'
He raised from bed, he was still wearing the clothes from last night and they were rumpled but he couldn’t care less.
John stood still for a moment, just smiling, when he caught up on the fact that Sherlock was gone and so he blinked and followed him.
John smiled at him, grabbing his hand as they left Sherlock's room. "You wouldn't have me any other way", he replied.
"Don't mind me, I can handle this. I don't need help." One of the bags fell. Sherlock turned to look at the window again, Harry frowned and stood up to help his brother. They went into the kitchen.
Somehow those last sentences had darkened the mood and the air around them felt heavy all of the sudden. Sherlock wouldn’t mention the topic. Talking about the fall was never easy, it would never be.
John tried not to flush, which was impossible, but he hid his smile and nodded at his mom, who just sighed and shrugged. "Well, what can I do to stop you? Just be careful, would you?"
Melissa laughed. “Honestly, I’m impressed. I never expected you to react in such a way because of John Watson. John Watson of all people. Simple and ordinary John Watson.”
It didn’t make sense at all. Sherlock was everything John didn’t like about art: tradition, classicism, academy. He had disliked it ever since he could remember, he disliked the way they only aimed to be realistic and aesthetic and never said anything about the world or about society, except for a few cases. And there was Sherlock, the embodiment of tradition and Ancient Greece and John…
"Mr Holmes." She said taking a deep breath, hell, if Watson's stories were true, then she was screwed because this man would probably end up shouting deductions at her face and walking away before she could even talk him out of this idea.
They started talking in whispers, and really, Irene was such a good actress, anybody who passed by could swear these two were absolutely mad for each other. Sherlock tried his best to look natural and smiled, forcing himself not to turn his back and look at John, who was approaching them.
“No, not anything, no. I can’t paint the face of that soldier when he threw his last breath as a bullet graced him through the heart. I can try, but it’ll never convey all the pain behind it. It’ll never convey the death behind it. Life imitates art and so I can’t express death through art.”
But then it all went backwards. Literally backwards. The image was vivid too. John getting shot and blood in Sherlock's hands. John in the rooftop of St. Barts looking at the stars. John's headaches. John asking him about the newspaper. John looking at him and being unable to recognise him. Ignoring him. Then his hand shaking. Then his coffee on the floor. Then something about John had changed. Then he was wearing a cast on his leg and holding a cane and wearing the same clothes he had worn the night before while he kissed Sherlock and moaned his name. But the same confused, unaware expression was there. He couldn't recognise Sherlock. After the kiss, after the... After all that, after sleeping together he looked at him like the first time they met after that year and a half Sherlock had been away. Like he hadn't ever seen him, as if he had no idea-
There were some unbearable times, when Serbia came crushing back to him, when Moriarty's voice creeped into his mind, when John's unknowing look drew itself in his mind palace, looking far too real, and Sherlock just wanted to run away. In those moments, he would simply scream, he would scream until the tears rolled down from his eyes, until his voice was sore and until the huge effort left him as a trembling mess. And the seconds tickled by in his head. Tick tock. Tick tock.
Somebody opened the door. John looked at it. He opened his mouth and let out a gasp. It was her. Irene Adler was standing in front of them.
In that moment Sherlock took a step ahead and John looked at him worriedly, but let him talk. "Um, excuse me, Mrs. Watson, but let me tell you, your son was fantastic, and he found a very important clue for the police, so I'd say yes, he can solve the murder."
He sighed and leaned his forehead against the desk. He’d never come back. What he used to be, who he used to be, he would never get it back. And he wasn’t sure if he wanted it, but anything was better than this, than this constant feeling that it had all been a dream, an illusion.
He moved his hand around, drawing softly and thinking about the way Sherlock’s hands reflected the light, about the parts he would darken, about the dimension. How had he called them? Texture.
"Sherlock?" John asked in disbelief, because the whole situation was absurd. When he finally started to understand what was going on, he realized Sherlock was already walking through the front door and getting out of the house.
Hawthorne looked startled for a moment. “He was the jumper of St. Bart’s? Wow. I did catch the news on that. Lot of coverage from the press for days.”
John looked at his hand and looked back at Sherlock, his expression turning into rage. "Who the hell do you think you are to tell me what to do and what not to do?" He said, raising his voice.
It looked like such an empty place to live. There was nothing. Nothing that could bring inspiration, no colors, no light, only shadows, only dark. Try as he might, Sherlock found nothing in there that could bring John Watson back to life.
“So it never even began. We were never together. I was married to my work and you spent the rest of the time reminding everyone you were not gay and that was all there was.”
Sherlock sat on the chair in front of the sofa and stared at John, who simply cleared his throat and said... "well?"
Somehow, that thought made him even more anxious and he started looking around, trying to find the way out as the flashes flashed and while he desperately attempted to control his own breathing.
Sherlock remembered in that moment that Greg didn't know the whole story, and he believed they were still... whatever they were. He didn't clarify it though, he just stopped for a second and considered it. It seemed like a tempting idea. John would be there anyway.
A warm hand placed on his shoulder. A warmth that was capable of breaking all of the coldness from that terrible basement he’d been kept in. He knew back then that he was really back at home.
John smiled, the woman could send him all the messages she wanted to, but tonight he was sharing the bed with him. Something she had never had before with the detective. Had she? No. Definitely not. "Good. Thanks. I'll go put on my pjs."
That was all they were, illusions. He had acted illogically by allowing those illusions into his brain and by nurturing them.
No matter how much he tried, John couldn’t come up with a solution to this mess he had created. He knew Sherlock wouldn’t talk about it, lest of all with him, he wasn’t that important in his life and it would only make things more uncomfortable and difficult. No matter how much he tried, he couldn’t see himself going to Baker Street the next Tuesday looking for a class and pretending as if nothing had happened. He knew he wouldn’t be able to keep the pretense for long enough.
In that moment Clara came running to them shaking her head. "DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE! YOU ARE CLEANING THIS FUCKING MESS!"
Sherlock smiled softly at him, John could see from the corner of his eye, and he couldn’t help but smile back, just the barest twitch from his lips.
But he couldn’t save him anymore and John wasn’t strong enough to save himself, so Lacuna was saving him. And that was fine. It was all fine.
This one shot had sounded just like that one. His first instinct was to look at his shoulder, to assess the wound. There was heat and sand and pain and death.
It was as if the Starry Night had suddenly portrayed itself in his bedroom. Spirals and color and so much yellow and a source of light which looked like the moon but also like the sun and it was too much, too much.
When John arrived to 221B, he stopped dead in his tracks. He looked around, closed his eyes and sighed. He look defeated, disappointed, or something in between. Sherlock put his hands behind his back, without noticing he had been moving them nervously ever since John walked in.
"-And came in to find you in the floor, unconscious, a syringe right next to you. Hardly a difficult deduction."
He stood silent. "Well, I don't know either. So it's better not to have friends and not mess up, right?"
“I used to think it was. But it wasn’t. Sherlock I got so bored of my own life that I took that radical decision. I romanticize it now but back then, I was about to lose my mind. I never asked for that kind of life”.
John smiled, but that kind of smile which does not come out when he was happy, it was a smile of utter and absolute anger. "His
"Sorry, but I'm not hungry and we have a lot of work to do. Plus, Mycroft will have more to eat, so everybody wins."
From Sherlock's reaction, he realized it probably wasn't the brightest idea ever. The greaser widened his eyes, and with an alerted expression said, loudly and blunt. "WHAT?"
Still, he didn't want to face him, because it would have been too much to handle. He didn't know what to say. He had hurt him, he had broken his heart, he had
Sebastian moved his arms and relaxed his expression, still gasping under the greaser's hold, which didn't seem to loose but to tighten. "Wow bird, cool it! It was just a joke!"
Take a listen to the lyrics Johnny boy, the girl of the song lives way more than you do. You should learn from her
But of course, Sherlock noticed him. As soon as the greaser saw the boy walking down the now empty hall, he stood up and closed his book silently, just before John could turn around the corner, he felt a hand grabbing his elbow and pulling him back.
They tucked into bed. He was exhausted. He felt as if he had been placed into that moment when the body and the mind want to unplug themselves from the rest of the universe. The world was quiet. He used to hate it, used to hate the stagnation, but with John by his side quietness was a gift.
"There is no us, is there? You have made that very clear!" Sherlock was starting to lose his temple.
"I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think I ever will." John said, shaking his head, frowning and speaking louder because the jukebox was incredibly loud.
Sherlock smiled with relief. John would see him once again, he would finally get to explain all of it.
The pain was unspeakable. It was impossible to express it with words, nor he wanted to, lest of all to Mycroft, so he simply groaned.
“Van Gogh was slowly losing his strength, slowly losing his light, feeling lost and lonely and trying constantly to cope with depression. And he did
When he got home, the street was filled with police cars, agents and detectives, working on solving the case. He let out a sigh. It was unbelievable that something like that could have even happened. It seemed more like a nightmare than reality.
Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to lie to John, not when John was talking to him so amiably and was at such ease, they had just laughed like the old times! He simply couldn’t lie to him, it would destroy all of it. “Yes. He needs me there.”
Irene was fucking right as usual and Sherlock hated that. They couldn't keep working together, but Sherlock did want to be John's friend, he felt he couldn't just cut him out of his life, but at the same time that was exactly what he wanted, but it wasn't easy, he couldn't just pretend nothing happened because he didn't know how to do that. "I hate this, Irene."
There was blood everywhere. Absolutely everywhere. John closed his eyes and sighed for a moment at the sight in front of him.
John looked up and smiled at him, his breathing was fast and ragged, he looked just as eager as Sherlock felt. His hands skimmed up until they landed over Sherlock's pants and he pulled them down, Sherlock gasped at the sensation and at the intimacy of this.
But John didn't ask him to. John beat him and kissed him and cried against him. So he wasn't ready to give up just yet. Not yet.
He matched all the criteria: being the messenger at Lacuna, he was close enough to know the patients' records and so he'd be able to choose his victims. Most of them had been found dead either in their apartments or their working places, and the records had exactly that kind of information.
In that moment, they heard a noise outside of the house. John broke the eye contract to turn and look through the bedroom window. "Oh, God."
Six months had passed since Sherlock's death when Lestrade received her case. She had been killed in her own room. The crime scene had been messy, far too messy, which was perhaps one of the reasons why Lestrade still remembered her name one year later. She had been stabbed with fury, yet they couldn't find the weapon nor the perpetrator, for the family couldn't think of anyone they could count as a suspect.
John nodded. He didn't want to have that conversation either. "Sure. I'll call mom, tell her I'm here before she freaks out."
"Well, that's exactly what I need to be honest". And he was being honest, he never got along well with his sister and sometimes she just left and arrived drunk next morning, he loved his mother, but even though she had the perfect suburban life, with a loving husband and children to take care of, he could absolutely tell she wasn't happy, she was never happy. He didn't enjoy being at home, so being at school seemed like the only logical solution.
He had approximately twenty minutes before Sherlock died of blood loss. He'd have to find a way out, look for a cab or something and get him to a hospital. But if he did he would be unable to keep pressing on the entrance wound and it would bleed faster. He didn't know what to do.
”, he said softly, emphasizing on the ‘little bit’, “of light gray to the white, to texturize it more.”
John stepped back and looked scared. "You must be confusing me with someone else. Some other... John." He said widening his eyes.
"I saw you getting out of a cab and rushing towards the entrance. Did they call the police? Did they think I was going to throw myself or...?"
"Yes, I am, and you have to trust my words, please. It was my mistake as much as it was yours, so both of our jobs are in danger."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "This isn't about you, Mycroft, no matter how much you desire to be the center of attention."
"God, John! When I'm drunk you seem to drive slower. If that's even possible." Sherlock said with a sigh.
"Because I know what you're planning on doing, Sherlock. I know you will want to run away and leave him alone, because you think that'll save him. But it hasn't. It won't. It's not your choice to make."
Warm, it was warm, warmer. Sherlock opened his eyes to see out of the corner of his eye a black and white wallpaper that he could relate with nothing but home. It was dark and he was sitting, not standing. He wasn’t chained, he wasn’t tied to the chair, he was just…sitting. His torso was bare, but it felt…different somehow.
Sherlock dragged a deep breath, feeling frustrated. He shook his head, looked down, looked up, then simply replied. "Your voice is the one there, not mine. You know better."
"I am. Tell me what is this game, because I'm not following it. I'm risking too much just by talking to you, but I felt the need of doing it. And now we're having lunch, and now you're not hungry. I don't want to lose again, so tell me once and for all what is it that you want, just tell me and I shall do as you say, just... What do you want from me?"
pattern, not the constant one. Right. Isabella. Isabella had been killed in a hotel room, disrupting everything. Isabella had been killed in a place that held emotional value for her -it was her usual room and in which she had lived with her husband for a while before divorcing him-
“Da Vinci always focused on two things: light and expression”, he said, leaning closer to John, as if he was telling him a secret. “He used the way light reflected on the hands to be able to draw them, but more importantly, he felt that hands could tell stories. And so, expression is fundamental. Hands must be positioned so they can become stories. Play with them. Use the lights. Highlight the knuckles, the veins, the bones. Think of the person you’re drawing in a broader context, does he or she works a lot with their hands?”
Her face expressions changed as son as Sherlock replied, she threw a smile at him and said "So, would you like a cup of coffee?"
But Sherlock was right. If he wanted to draw a body, he couldn’t get all metaphysical and start enunciating whatever made the person who they were. He had to observe the composure of his body, the structure of it, the bags under the eyes, the wrinkles, the posture, the height, the weight.
It was almost 8:30 and Greg hadn't arrived yet and Sherlock wanted to leave as far as possible because his brother would arrive soon and he would find out and not allow him to go, of course. He was pacing up and down in his bedroom, when a beep sounded. He looked through the window and Sebastian, Jim and Greg were looking up to him while waiting. "I'll be down."
John rubbed his forehead. He knew that if he tried to use a brush he would only end up depressed and disappointed in himself. Who knew? Perhaps all the knowledge he had in color had vanished from his hands when he first pulled a trigger in Afghanistan.
John snorted. "Oh please, knowing you, we would have ended in a field, having a smoke while you listened to Buddy Holly."
It's been only six months since he came back and he's done so many things for me that a book would never be enough to cover it, and I owe him what I am now, who I am now, because he's saved me. And so, if I believe all the wondrous, crazy, hilarious stories I've been told, I know for sure that Sherlock Holmes has saved my life too many times.
He actually felt like he knew Sherlock Holmes. He believed in him, he trusted him, he loved him, he…
Jim groaned but finally stood up, feeling a little dizzy after last night's events. Moran went out the door hurriedly, Jim following him.
"...and so we started. And he was good. He was better than drugs. But just for a while. He got new friends and he changed, but he was still my Victor, or so I thought." Sherlock said with a shrug. "But then I got bored again and I needed something,
"Well, it's true." John nodded up and down, up and down, trying to convince himself, and it wasn't working, and Sherlock knew that, of course. Sherlock always knew everything. Bastard.
Sherlock was wrong. Sherlock was completely wrong. He turned and looked at the so-called-painting and hated it and despised it and thought it was the most meaningless and stupid thing he’d ever seen. He wanted to destroy it. It was the worst thing he’d ever done.
