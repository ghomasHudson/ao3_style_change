Sherlock lowered his violin after a particularly nice part that had been rather more upbeat than the music he usually played.
It was stupid and dangerous to more people than just himself. He might lose control again, the PTSD destroying all rational thought. And if by some miracle it didn't and he stayed in control of himself, he would still be endangering Sherlock, subjecting him to the Psy Council's scrutiny. The Councillors, so rarely seen and so very powerful, were the dark spectres looming over their lives. Before meeting Sherlock, John had never expected to end up subjected to their laws.
And then he stepped into the bathroom, still out of breath from his mad dash up the stairs. "Shit. Sherlock? Can you hear me?"
"Best not," Sherlock agreed, finally pulling up his trousers fully and grimacing as he tried to adjust himself in his pants before pulling up the zip and doing up the button. John wordlessly handed him his shirt, his heart still beating at twice its normal rate and desire still curling in his core.
It was different, this new life he had carved out for himself. Quieter, sometimes almost unbearably so. It was peaceful in a way his life never used to be, and entirely free of crime.
His flatmate followed him, opening the door and looking down at him with a look of curiosity "You've been in here before, John, it's still the same room."
By noon that day, Sally has moved into 221c Baker Street and the ridiculousness of the entire situation has become clear to her. A little over two years ago, she would have rather eaten live moths than set foot into this place. Now she's friends with the landlady and just moved in.
It was because of her presence that Sherlock didn't dare mention who had really smelled the powder but he was sure even Lestrade was smart enough to figure that one out for himself.
Sherlock wondered if they had realised that he hadn't actually said anything at all on the progress of the case but decided not to draw their attention to that. Instead, he put on his best fake smile. "My pleasure. No, don't get up, I can find my own way out. Goodbye."
He buried his face in his hands. "You ... Sherlock, we've been over that, too. You can't just make your own drugs. Or take someone else's, for that matter! How often have we had this discussion?"
"She won't be alone," Emily said quietly, drawing Sherlock's attention back to her. "That was my nephew up there."
Here, Sherlock's train of thought derailed as he recalled the particulars about those trousers and the way they had looked on John's body last night.
They reached the Crags after about an hour’s casual stroll and found a flat rock to sit on and enjoy the view of the city with the sea stretching away to the east and the Pentland Hills rising up in the northwest.
Sherlock squinted at the video and played it again. "One of her hands is always hidden, it's impossible to tell if she's got it."
He hung his head, unable to look at John any longer. All of a sudden, he needed distance and quiet and a chance to rebuild all the carefully structured walls he had so carelessly allowed to fall at dinner.
"Something I didn't mention about this token," he murmured against Sherlock's mouth. "The interest rates are extremely steep."
"If things had been different, chances are I'd be dead for real," Sherlock replied softly. "We're alive. We're here. I'm sure between the two of us we can figure out the rest."
He opened the bathroom door and walked into the warm wall of humidity John’s showers always generated.
He ignored the heads that turned in their direction as he and John exited the lift and marched to Lestrade's office - Perkins was scowling at his desk, clearly still miffed that John had not taken any orders from him. Sherlock considered giving John another treat for that one.
It is becoming increasingly obvious to John that he is even more oblivious than Sherlock always claims he is.
There was a rustle at the other end of the line and then his mother was back. "All right, Sherlock, give me the numbers you want to run."
"Looks good from here," Lestrade informed him, having bent forward to get a better view of John's legs.
He kept talking and John kept breathing and eventually, his heart rate calmed down and his breaths turned into something that couldn't be described as hyperventilation and his body slowly stopped shaking.
The only furniture that seemed to have mainly his or Sherlock's scent clinging to it were their respective armchairs. The sofa which, if asked, he would have claimed was Sherlock's space, actually smelled strongly of them both, bearing testimony to the fact that John spent more time on it than he had been aware of.
It took a moment or two for their changed positions to register and then John bolted upright, narrowly avoiding hitting Sherlock's chin with his head.
But no, he mustn't get ahead of himself. Perhaps he had read it all wrong and was jumping to conclusions. Just because Sherlock had basically stated he loved him, that didn't necessarily have to mean anything more than the 'I love yous' exchanged by friends and family. And up to now, there had never been any indication that he wanted ... wanted ... that he
he thinks, even as he presses their mouths together, taking advantage of the fact that Sherlock's is still half-open, caught mid-word as he has been.
The idea seemed to horrify Lestrade, though Sherlock strongly suspected not half as much as it horrified him. "You think that's possible?"
"So I wonder ... what could have happened in between you kissing me senseless in a hallway before running away and you returning an hour later, with dust in places it really couldn't have gotten unless you had at least partially undressed?"
Sherlock tried to take a breath but it turned into a strangled sob halfway through and he shuddered in her arms, wrapping his own around her waist and pressing his face to her stomach in a useless attempt to hide his tears. He was so done with pretending it didn't hurt.
She took one look at Sherlock, shouted "Pa!" and launched herself right at him. By the time she reached him, Sherlock had already slid off the sofa and was on his knees on the floor, arms open.
It took him a minute or two to notice that the sheets were shredded. No doubt his claws had pushed their way through his skin during his nightmare.
John stared at him, feeling the cold horror wash through his entire being. He had been right in his rant about the dissonance. The PsyCouncil truly had enslaved an entire race and sentenced them to a choice between compliance with Silence and death.
And as he heard John hum to himself in the bathroom, happy as can be, he felt a burning envy. What he wouldn't give to forget.
He hadn't paid much attention to what she had looked like then. But now ... she looked happy. So perhaps she had really wanted to marry him. Or she was just that good an actress.
"I said 'Sit', you stupid dog!" Perkins snapped, trying to inflict his voice with the sound of authority.
John shook his head, a light finally dawning. "I think I have a pretty good idea," he retorted. "Such a lucky coincidence because I can't help but want the same thing."
Sally, having risen and now standing uncertainly in the kitchen, notices there is not a hint of bitterness in Mrs Holmes' voice. If anything, she sounds pleased.
Too many nights spent looking after Harry had made John fear and despise the effects of alcohol more than studying medicine had ever done. To see Sherlock, who was always so frighteningly in control of every little thing he said and did, was even worse than having to watch his own sister's already erratic behaviour spiral out of control.
John didn't really need those hints, not with the scent of cold steel in the air that even the blood couldn't hide completely. "He's Psy."
Sherlock gave a half-hearted shrug. "It really was just because I didn't have anything in the flat. I might have made it all the way through the flat but certainly not out of the house and towards the nearest dealer. Quite lucky, too. I'm honestly not sure I wouldn't have gotten the dose wrong."
Mixed in with the horror was something else, though. Something fierce and furious, a bright, burning, roaring monster of a thing.
Sherlock sighed again - this was precisely why he hated sentiment. It only served to mess everything up.
Sherlock stood in his room, his gaze darting back and forth between the door and the box of tissues in his hand, and felt utterly speechless.
"Fine," Sherlock sighed. "He's eating fine, he's drinking enough water, I take him for walks at least twice a day, he still bullies me into eating and sleeping and I know Mrs Hudson has been sneaking him treats behind my back. He seems happy enough, but he would obviously prefer being himself again."
Sherlock looked away first, sitting up and saying as nonchalantly as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened at all: “I’m having a shower and then I’m going back to Barts. Molly made me go home before we were done with all our experiments but she promised we could continue today.”
"I told you to stay outside!" the Psy called. "Hired muscle these days isn't worth half the money they demand. You stay right there, Sherlock. Wouldn't want to stop our fun, would we? I promise you'll have all my attention again in just a moment."
Sherlock stepped out of the way of one of the fists flying towards his face and deflected the other with his arm. However, the move left him open for his first opponent's second swing. He managed to turn his head away to avoid most of the impact but still suffered a glancing blow across the cheek.
He could do two more hours, Sherlock decided. Draw out the anticipation a bit, make himself really look forward to the simple pleasure of having a moment that was
John had been planning on starting out slowly, on kissing him gently, softly, warmly, until Sherlock was well and truly snogged into oblivion, but of course Sherlock had to be so responsive, had to react to every movement with a sigh or a soft moan. His eyes had slipped closed already and John promptly found himself deepening the kiss far sooner than he had intended to do so, pulling Sherlock closer with a hand on his back.
"Can't really argue with that," Lestrade sighed. "Divorces are shitty, no matter what, and yours would have been even worse, given the circumstances. Well, come along then."
Sherlock stayed away for hours and John told himself firmly not to worry. They had been cooped up together for days on end and while their outing yesterday had been nice, it had still involved the two of them sticking to one another. Sherlock was entitled to some alone time. Belatedly, it occurred to John that Sherlock probably hadn’t spent this much time with another human being in several years. Even before his ‘death’ they had not spent every waking moment together and had slept in separate rooms. It was hardly surprising that Sherlock would need some time to himself every once in a while.
Sherlock stared at him in disbelief, then managed a jerky nod. "Of course, John." He swallowed. "You're welcome."
"To get it back," Sherlock corrected. "I think whoever stashed the money here - if it was money instead of something of similar worth - realised he had found it and killed him either for revenge or to get it back. Probably both, once they realised he had already spent most of it."
Sherlock blinked. “That’s in an account in France. I don’t think I’ve even looked at a statement about it in the past fifteen years or so.”
"Fine," he said, snatching in a breath. "Just ... thinking about the wedding, is all. I can't believe it's less than a month away."
John turned his head to shoot him a glance and found he couldn't look away. God, how had he never noticed just how beautiful Sherlock's eyes were? And, come to think of that, how expressive? The quiet sadness was there, too.
John was glad he couldn't speak. He had no idea what to say in response, so he just whined quietly and turned to look at Sherlock.
That, at least, seemed to filter through the shock in Sherlock's brain. He didn't need to be told twice.
"I'm still sorry it happened," John told him. "I don't think I've ever been so scared as I was when I found you on the floor and saw the blood. Well, until you flat-lined, that is."
"We all need memories we can treasure," John said. "And winding up your brother is just too much fun to not do it."
Sherlock had gone quiet and when John twisted his head around to find out why, he discovered that Sherlock was looking at him with a peculiar expression on his face.
And this ... this was what John had been waiting for. This closeness, Sherlock's surrender clearly telegraphed by every line of his body as he sagged against the wall, blindly seeking out John's mouth and kissing him back.
Sherlock Holmes was a Psy and he was Silent. These were the facts and they made sure people didn't forget.
Thank you so much for joining me on this adventure and for trusting me on this ride despite my refusal to indicate how many chapters this would have until the end.
"I bet Mary will love you in a tux," John added, apparently thinking out loud. "She's been wondering if you own anything other than your suits."
This was new information to John and he took in the constables milling around the crime scene with new eyes. It was true that people were giving Sherlock a wide berth and that everyone was being very careful not to pass too closely behind his back. Donovan was rather obviously hovering diagonally across from him with her arms crossed, sending warning looks at anyone who came too close.
There were the usual noises of Mrs Hudson busying herself in the kitchen, hunting for a clean mug, accidentally doing half the dishes to find one, tutting at the chemical stains on the kitchen table and the kettle boiling. Finally, a hand holding a large cup of tea appeared in Sherlock’s vision. He reached out to take it from her, murmuring another thank you, just to be on the safe side. Mrs Hudson was looking distressingly fragile tonight. He made a mental note to keep in mind that she wasn’t as young as she had been when he first met her and that these things were taking their toll on her.
Then, Mrs Hudson tittered. "Oh, you! After all the things you have done, do you really think turning your partner into a dog is going to send me into hysterics?"
"You're mad," Lestrade said, shaking his head as the car inched through traffic. "Absolutely barking. Sally, back me up here."
"It's you or nobody," John told him firmly. "Now please, come here and kiss me so I can stop making silly mistakes right this second."
“Remember you’ll have to carry that around with you if you buy it,” John said, grinning when Sherlock jumped. “I’m sure people aren’t that desperate for whatever this is, so it will probably still be there if we come back at a later time.”
"He seems perfectly okay with strangers," Donovan pointed out, bending down to scratch John behind his ears, which earned her a furiously wagging tail and a rough tongue licking along her hand. "Oi!"
Still, there were other experiments being conducted here, genetic improvements and augmentations of medicine, vaccinations, drugs, ... the list was endless. He had noticed that some of the animals appeared to have been tampered with in ways that went far beyond luminosity and he would be quite interested to take a closer look at some of the reports on these experiments.
John shoved all thoughts of that particular decoration out of his mind and refocused on the punch bowl. "Alright then. Care to share a glass?"
How had he ended up in this situation anyway? He carefully opened his eyes but closed them immediately as the blinding light stabbed at his retinas. Ouch.
Sally found it very relaxing to be ambling along aimlessly, the dog beside her and the sun warming her back. "And to think I'm getting paid for this," she commented, grinning. "I'm starting to think the freak should never give you away, Johnny. Though the real John probably won't thank you if he has to clean up after Holmes
She kissed him and he smiled, delighted by her joy. "Yes, really. Come on, get your laptop. Let's have another look."
"Good," Lestrade said firmly. "You should not be. You were protecting your mate. There is nothing anyone would ever say against that."
He didn't need to hear the warning in his voice - even now there was still enough awareness in his brain to let him know that he had about ten seconds to pull off if he wanted to.
He looked up and then remembered that Molly was there, looking after Rosie. Right. Molly had come, of course she had. Sherlock was probably on his way, too. He had been whisked away by Mycroft's people and there had been no chance to talk, none at all. Probably so they could give their statements separately or something. John barely remembered what his had been.
Sherlock let out a shuddering breath and held John tighter, still in disbelief that he was allowed to do this now, right here in the middle of their sitting room. "And you're really sure about this?"
“I’ll show you tomorrow,” Sherlock promised. “And the employees there can tell you the story themselves, along with some rather amusing analyses of the paintings he does own.”
Sally takes in the way Mrs Hudson beams at Sherlock and decides that letting her have this dinner will be worth the risk of an upset stomach.
"Ah. Well, in that case, I hope you'll let me get on with it, sir. I know how we medical professionals can get when our loved ones are ill - my wife laughs at me every time for it - but I assure you, I'm perfectly qualified to do my job."
"You're hardly an idiot yourself," Sherlock told him firmly. "Don't sell yourself short. I really can't be seen with a mate who isn't utterly aware of how bloody fantastic he is. What on earth would people think of me?"
“Mm-hmm. Wouldn’t have thought it possible but he did it. Of course it all came back down. It was disgusting and we haven’t let him live it down.”
"Can we go home now and come back at a civilised hour?" Sherlock asked as John came to a halt in front of him.
In late March, the situation gets a new sense of urgency: John and Mary send out wedding invitations.
"Nothing much so far, I'm afraid," Sherlock replied. "I'm sure John has been keeping you up to date as far as the rules regarding ongoing investigations will allow."
John snorted. "I thought you were dead, Sherlock. Excuse me for not expecting you to show up in a fancy restaurant with a drawn-on mustache and a terrible French accent."
"Of course," John said. He had no intention of going home anytime soon when Mary was angry and hadn't had time to cool down yet. And, well, Sherlock might need him. "I'll call you if there's any change."
But even as he spoke, he could see the way Anderson was eyeing John - wary, faintly disgusted, but mostly afraid. Scared of dogs, then. Hardly a surprise. Sherlock imagined that many animals took offense to the likes of Anderson, keener senses immediately picking up on his true nature as a disgusting human being. What was that saying again? 'A person not liked by animals and small children is not to be trusted.' Clever man, that Carl Hilty. He made a mental note to orchestrate a run-in between Anderson and a two-year-old to test this theory.
She didn't seem too put out, though, because a moment later her fingers found his right ear in the most delicious scratch. He leaned his head into her hand and wagged his tail, closing his eyes in abject pleasure. Ohhh, this felt
Sherlock felt the words more than he heard them, shivering down his spine and rattling his bones with how much he wanted them to be true.
Before his rational human mind could scramble forward and suggest helping her pick up the mess (something Sherlock would never do), his nose and rumbling stomach swiftly overruled  it and John pounced, going straight for the shortbread which smelled utterly divine.
His friend shrugged. "Lestrade labours under the belief that being able to express yourself through touch may help your mental stability and make you feel less stressed about your situation. Do you concur?"
"I think about it all the time, John," Sherlock repeated. Now that the words were out there, it was ridiculously easy to say them again. He rather thought he could just talk and talk and talk and never shut up and still find new things to say on the matter.
He groaned shakily in response and John's other hand found his balls, further proof that he was keeping Sherlock trapped with his body and sheer presence alone.
"I have my driver waiting downstairs," Mycroft announced. "He can take you to the hospital. Both of you," he added rather pointedly before Sherlock could open his mouth to protest.
John and Sherlock are both there for the trial, sitting side by side, both stone-faced. Sally isn't surprised by this. Neither of them is going to give a statement, though.
One of them, his head at an unnatural angle, was clearly beyond help. The metallic stink of Psy and blood washed across Lestrade's senses and he wrinkled his nose, turning away to focus on the other Psy.
, to see the person she will become. Have you never wondered why Mrs Hudson has a smartphone now? I made sure Mycroft provided her with one. She and I set up regular video calls. I've been talking to Rosie at least three times a week for the past two-and-a-half years, approximately. Ever since she started to learn how to speak."
John knew he would not have a lot of time until the man reached the outer door and discovered his two henchmen.
Just as they had hoped, Edinburgh wasn’t quite as sweltering as London. The sun shone and there was a lovely mild breeze.
John eyed the bowl warily but couldn't detect anything that suggested his madman of a flatmate had tampered with it. Of course that didn't mean he hadn't done anything. Sherlock was very good at making something look completely innocent only to have it later turn out to be potentially dangerous and definitely unsanitary.
Happy with himself and the world in general, John entered the kitchen just in time to catch Sherlock with his hand in the cookie jar. Literally.
"Poor Sherlock seemed a bit tense today," Mrs Hudson said. "I could hear him pacing from my flat. Is everything all right? I noticed his brother came by shortly before you came to visit me, and we all know how much they rile each other up, but Sherlock was pacing all morning."
"Well before any of the current officers were with the force, or even born, then," Sherlock said. "Just between ourselves, how likely do you think they are to catch anyone?"
He tried to imagine John being gone, tried to erase his presence from the flat and watched the mental picture fall apart immediately.
For now at least he had John's company, but if John ever realised how much it meant to him, how much Sherlock needed him, all that they had rebuilt so painstakingly might be torn from him in one fell swoop. He could not risk it.
They returned home and John paused in the hallway for a moment, listening for any suspicious noises. Everything seemed quiet, so he waited for Mrs Hudson to unleash him and then carried the lead back upstairs.
How on earth had his race ever chosen to give this up? How had anyone who had ever kissed someone they loved made the decision to nip all emotion in the bud? It seemed incomprehensible to him. He couldn't imagine anything that could possibly convince him to not kiss John every day for the rest of his life.
John sighed again. Clearly this worry stemmed from lingering fear of Sherlock dying. Part of him had not forgotten what that had felt like, after all, and he wasn't keen on a repetition. Losing him once had been bad enough, thank you very much.
Bleary eyes zeroed in on his face once more and John nodded to himself. "Yep. Definitely getting you home now. Come on, up you get." He turned to the barkeeper. "How much does he owe you?"
He stops being grateful after dinner, when there is more mingling and a man in an expensive suit engages Sherlock in conversation while undressing him with his eyes.
"Of course not," John grumbled. "So what was the point of getting drunk in the first place? Experiment?"
"We're not going in," Emily announced, halting about fifty yards away from the building and the playground that had been set up in the trees next to it. A couple of young ocelots could be seen playing in the trees, practising their climbing skills and playfully swiping at one another with their paws. A handful of adults stood guard around them, eyeing the intruders warily.
his mind screamed. He stood, chair squeaking across the linoleum of their kitchen floor. “I need to go to the lab.”
"Of course, John," he makes himself say, forcing the words out past the sudden lump in his throat as his chest constricts. "Have fun."
Sighing, he put the letter away again, carefully tugging it into his breast pocket. This at least he could keep close to his heart. Kind words. John's words.
Mary, she thinks, is like a piece of marble destined to be a statue. You have to chip away all the things you can see to reveal the actual figure underneath. Sally wonders how much more chipping she will have to do before the person in front of her starts to take shape.
Sherlock nodded. "Yes. There is nothing that can be done about it. I cannot disable the dissonance triggers without risking my Tk slipping the leash if I lose control."
What was more, Sherlock seemed to do so almost automatically sometimes, like that moment in the cab earlier today. A warm hand stroking over his head, fingers curling in his fur ... he wished Sherlock would do that more often.
"You've come into contact with one of the experiments during your fall just now," Sherlock told him, thus clearing up the question of their location. Still Baskerville, then. "Some of it has entered your bloodstream. The effects are quite... remarkable. I need you to remain calm while we try to figure out what to do. Can you do that?"
"Wasn't planning to," Sherlock said, ignoring the biting sarcasm on purpose. "I'm going to solve this case instead, if that's all right with you."
He opened his mouth to say as much to John before remembering that John wasn't there to hear him. Well, hear him he probably did, but a reply would not be forthcoming.
Before he knew it, his plate was empty and John was piling dishes next to the sink and running hot water to do the washing up.
And where did that leave them now, with John petitioning for a divorce? It wasn't as if he wanted to get away from Sherlock - not anymore. But, well, he couldn't marry Mary if he was already married to someone else. The government frowned on polygamy.
"Of course." Molly relaxes a bit, clearly relieved at the opportunity to get out of Sherlock's presence.
The intense humidity was wreaking havoc on his friend’s hair, the once carefully tamed strands now a veritable riot of messy curls that made John’s fingers itch to touch. Sherlock seemed utterly oblivious to both the state of his hair and John’s reaction to it, which was probably for the best.
Sherlock smiled a crooked smile. "I would do it all over again, John. If it kept you alive... if it kept you safe... I would endure it all over again and worse."
John looked at him, eyes tearing up from the smell. “Yeah, I don’t care about your experiments. We’re definitely not getting a sample of that in our flat. I think even Mrs Hudson would draw the line here.”
There was only so much torture he was willing to put himself through and wishing for things that could never be was definitely not on the list.
They slowed down once they got into the more populated areas where people were just returning home after evening mass. No one spared them a second glance as they casually melted into the crowd, ambling along like just another pair of churchgoers. John couldn't deny that worship was definitely on his mind, though not in any way the Church would have approved of.
"Sorry," Sherlock murmured and moved his hand a safe distance away. John huffed a deep breath and thanked the heavens for his water-logged long fur and all the foam. God, as if this entire thing wasn't embarrassing enough already!
John rolled his eyes back to give him an incredulous look. Sherlock wondered if he was being fanciful if he interpreted it to mean '
"Night stand, top drawer," Sherlock murmured, mouth latching on to the warm skin of John's shoulder.
He found a hole in the fence that was large enough to accommodate him and squeezed through, slowing down to assess his surroundings.
He only realised he had shown his distress when he felt Sally pull him back by his lead. He hadn't even noticed he was straining against it, trying to follow Sherlock despite his order to stay put.
After a moment's contemplation, Sherlock reached into the box Mycroft's people had brought and pulled out something large and brown that smelled utterly divine to John's canine nose.
"Figured you'd want some time to conquer the urge to punch me in the nose and then take a nap," Sherlock said, shrugging.
Sherlock frowned down at the tiles. "Interesting. While you were in the park with Donovan the other day, Lestrade called to tell me they found a suspicious white substance in the son's flat. I wonder if the tests on that have already come back."
And then he had been hopeless, once he had confronted the fact that he would never be allowed an outlet for his anger or any other sentiment strong enough to make it through the Silence and reach his consciousness.
Sherlock, being Sherlock, was trying to explain and giving all the wrong explanations about the methodology and none whatsoever on his reasoning and John had enough of that very quickly.
John sighed and ran a hand across his face. Sherlock allowed himself a moment to look at him and was hit by how tired John looked, standing in the middle of the room. Not just tired but bone-deep exhausted and wary. And written across all of that wariness was a terror that surpassed everything Sherlock had ever seen on his face, a fear so visceral it made him tremble in sympathetic response.
"There," Sherlock said, shoving open the attic door and pulling John inside before closing the door behind them. It wouldn't do to be overheard now. Several of the other guests had seen them barging into the building and watched Sherlock drag John up the stairs by the hand, obviously in a rush. It wasn't difficult to guess what they all thought they were up to, so they had bought themselves at least an hour of uninterrupted time before someone would come looking for them. Sherlock clearly didn't intend to need that long.
"There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms." Mrs Hudson's voice penetrated his concentration and he glanced up at her.
And so Sally finds herself visiting her parents and letting her mum shove several boxes of Christmas decorations into her arms.
In the end, Sherlock fell more onto the backseat than to actually sit down, causing Anthea to budge up until she was pressed against the other door, her glare intensifying as she continued tapping away on her blackberry. John shoved Sherlock's legs aside and got in as well, closing the door behind him. He doubted he had ever seen Anthea pissed off for any reason - or staring at anything but her phone.
Sherlock shook his head at himself. Of course they would. They were allowing touch now because John needed to know that he was allowed to be affectionate with Sherlock in the only way he could be right now. That was all there was to it. And once he had regained his human form, he would also regain his ability to speak, to physically drag Sherlock out of danger or stop him from running right into it.
"I am capable of friendliness, John," Sherlock pointed out, sounding annoyingly relaxed and reasonable for someone currently lying on his not very clean kitchen floor whilst being straddled by another man. "I just don't see the point of being nice when I can get what I want without it most of the time."
He finished his meal and dumped the used bowl and chopsticks in the sink to deal with at some undefined point in the future.
But John had also said 'no more' and Sherlock's inherent pessimism wouldn't allow him to believe that it really meant what he hoped it meant. No more what? No more denying that this was something John wanted? For how long? Just this once? Just for the duration of their stay?
“How do you feel about going to the pub tonight? We haven’t had a chance to go out in ages.” John sounded far more excited than an outing to the pub should cause, but Sherlock supposed that having been stuck indoors at 221b for the better part of three weeks made everything seem exciting in comparison.
"Yeah, he arrived at the hospital barely five minutes after we did. Stayed for almost three hours, hardly even looked at his phone the entire time."
"Not for me attacking you," John said immediately. "That ... that is on me and I will never be able to express how sorry I am."
"Cooey!" Mrs Hudson called as she cleared the final step up to 221b some two weeks later. "Are you boys decent?"
“Only if you want it to be,” John promised happily, mouth trailing back up Sherlock’s spine and making sure their bodies slid together the further up he moved.
“You let me sleep,” Sherlock noted. He tried not to sound accusing but he thought it might have come out that way anyways.
John made a sound like a snort at that. Sherlock pretended not to hear him. "The injury is annoying, but we can keep ourselves entertained well enough. There are a ton of non-intrusive experiments I can run that don't require John to move about much. As soon as he's back on his paws, we'll stop by the Yard for an update on the case."
She was washing the dishes, her sleeves shoved up to her elbows in that sloppy way of hers. The left one was already sliding back down to her wrist.
John moaned, arching into Sherlock’s touch. This slow teasing was so far from what he needed and yet somehow exactly what he wanted and he could do nothing but stare back at Sherlock and let his words wash over him.
John deserved someone like him, someone human or changeling, who didn't come with a murderous Council on his back and a lack of emotional anything. He deserved someone who could touch him without getting a brain haemorrhage
He put the sheets in order and started reading. No salutation, just as John had said. It simply started:
"Oh," another blink and Sherlock returned back to the real world from wherever he had gone in his mind. "I was hoping to observe their interactions and just let them tell us whatever they want. We can question them by playing the concerned guests and making some suggestions of our own."
He caught the bartender's eye, ordered a pint and leaned against the bar, casually pursuing the crowd.
"If you say so." John grinned at him. "So, the twins had a falling out over the investment banker. What does he think of that?"
John glanced between the two and then disappeared down the hall. He returned a minute later in jeans and a t-shirt, his feet still bare.
For one surprised second, John could do nothing at all as his mind tried to catch up with this most unexpected turn of events. He knew how easy it was to let your thoughts wander, to end up hard and wanting at the mental image the word "blowjob" represented, no matter how unspoken it remained, but what you did in such a situation was to either turn your thoughts in another direction or get some peace and quiet and have a wank. You certainly didn't press the person closest to you against a door and proceed to tongue-fuck their mouth.
Sherlock nodded back. "Clever of you to spend some time here each year, creating the myth of a ghost haunting the attic to keep people away. It must have come as quite the shock to arrive here, ready to regain at least some of your wealth, only to find that poor Freddy had discovered your hiding place when he was replacing some old wires in the attic. As a general tip to anyone wishing to hide something of value: don't leave it in a place that may be accessed for maintenance work unless you can be certain you will have time to remove it beforehand. You accepted your bad luck and were ready to move on with your life."
He would have grinned if he had the ability to do so. Instead, he shuffled closer and carefully ate out of her hand.
"You would have done your best and still excelled," Sherlock insisted. "You're a natural caregiver, John, and you certainly know how to mother me. Even as a dog you still managed to make me eat and sleep at regular intervals."
Even the drive home had been quiet and filled with an odd tension John knew he wasn't the only one aware of. Every now and then, he had stolen a glance or two in Sherlock's direction only to find him looking very serious. Once or twice, he thought he caught a flash of dread in those iridescent eyes when Sherlock didn't manage to look away in time.
"Lost interest," John echoed, clearly having more difficulty accepting this concept than the fact that Sherlock had not only admitted to having been sexually active once upon a time but also implied that such activities had involved men.
Lestrade took a deep breath. "Sounds good to me. You heard the expert, boys!" he shouted to some of the Constables, who hurried over immediately. "As soon as the evidence crew is ready, I want this body taken to the morgue, care of Dr Molly Hooper. Understood? Off you pop. John, can I have a word?"
John smiled, gently nudging Sherlock's shoulder with his. "Do you know, if we hadn't figured it out by now, I think this picture right here would have made me kiss you."
He stood abruptly, the letter held carefully in his hands, unwilling to allow so much as a single additional crease on the paper, and moved to pace about the kitchen, trying to get his bearings, to collect his thoughts, his very self. Finally, he braced his hands on the kitchen counter once more, the letter laid out between them.
home rather than his. Almost 10 months had passed since his return and yet the thought of John living anywhere but 221b Baker Street was still incomprehensible, catching him off-guard each and every time the topic arose, like reaching the end of a stairwell and expecting one more step that just wasn't there.
It seemed like only a minute had passed when he heard his name being called and opened his eyes, but Sherlock was freshly showered and dressed to go out. John hadn't expected that - usually, Sherlock couldn't be bothered to even get dressed, let alone leave the flat unless there was a case. As far as John knew, there was no case. He certainly would have heard it had a mobile gone off.
Before Sherlock could come up with any sort of response to that, to voice his disbelief, John added: "I found the letter. The right one. I brought it so you can finally read it. So you'll know that it's true and always has been."
Perhaps, he mused, this was because he had never before woken up with someone else in his bed. With John in his bed. It sent a delicious shiver through him, feeling somehow strangely intimate for how chaste they were with each other. Well, he had rather thrown a wench in that last night, hadn't he? He had never intended to come home and just kiss John like that. He had never intended to kiss John at all. Well, that was a lie. He hadn't intended to do it until they were safe.
“See this?” John asked Lestrade and the assembled officers, who were watching him with expressions ranging from surprise to interest. He nodded towards Sherlock’s neck. “The angle of the towel perfectly matches the ligature marks on the victim’s skin. I’d say the killer surprised him from behind and attempted to strangle him but when that failed he bashed his head against the corner of the kitchen table here.”
"The guy jumped head-first into the fire, tore it apart screaming his lungs out," one of the Bobbies says. "Heard it from my mate who was on patrol near the scene. He pulled an unconscious guy out, said he'd been abducted by someone. Who the fuck does that?"
The cab ride passed in silence, their driver one of the less chatty cabbies. John was glad for it - he had vivid memories of what happened when a talkative cab driver got on Sherlock's nerves and wasn't keen on an encore while he was unable to soothe ruffled feathers.
John turned to stare at him, surprised to find Sherlock putting on his shoes. "Where are you going?"
She glanced at her mate and then at the other people in the room with Sherlock. "This is not your pack," she said softly, her eyes landing on John. "You are not part of WhiteSpot."
Needless to say, John was not impressed. While the ingenuity of the manufacturers of the kong was admirable, he was hungry and this required him to work for his food, which didn't quite fit in with the relaxation he had had planned for the day. The part of his brain that was unmistakeably canine, on the other hand, was ecstatic.
John kissed him again, slow but deep, until they were both breathless and Sherlock had climbed onto John's armchair to straddle his legs.
He was already denying himself the simple yet complex joy of shifting, of being himself. Now he would also have to deny himself the one thing he and his cat both wanted - a Psy who had been given the choice between ending in fire or ice and had chosen ice.
John wished he was human just so he could bury his face in his hands to avoid having to witness the carnage that was sure to follow.
"That's what made it so hard for me to move on," John admitted. "I never expected to love anyone as much as you and then I lost you before I ever got around to admitting it, to doing something about it. All I wanted to do was dig you up and scream it in your face. But of course I couldn't. So I found something - someone - to distract me, to keep me afloat. And I didn't question where she came from or why she would possibly be interested in me, so long as I didn't have to think about losing you."
The ocean settles, becomes still and quiet, glinting silver in the light of the sun. Sherlock stares and stares and stares and doesn't breathe.
"I get that it's super useful for sharing information quickly and so on, but surely at this point the risk outweighs the advantages."
John, distracted by the elegant sight of that slender body in a well-tailored suit, blinked in surprise. "Sorry?"
The curtains fluttered in a soft breeze and although the windows were open, he could not hear any noise from outside. No, that was wrong. He heard birds singing outside. Well, that was not entirely unusual for the suburbs, but it still caught him off-guard sometimes.
Just then, Sergeant Donovan poked her head out from the tent they had set up over the body. "Is that a
"Hello," she says, forcing herself to smile at John's fiancée. "We met in early November. I'm Sally D-"
"The victim's accountant sent over the files I requested. I've started going over the numbers last night but-"
Sherlock's breath brushes against the shell of John's ear and John shivers. He can't help it and he knows Sherlock can feel it, the full-body shudder that runs through him.
He looks so small on that sofa, shivering under his blankets, and John feels another flutter of warmth at the sight of Sherlock looking so human.
"Murder, embezzlement, another murder ... oh, this is shaping up to be very interesting indeed!" he exclaimed.
His head hurt and he felt mildly dizzy. Dark spots danced before his eyes as he sat up with a groan.
"Morning Greg," John said pleasantly. Sherlock grunted a greeting but didn't look up from his microscope.
"Impressive," Sally says, leaning against one of the desks in the sitting room and crossing her arms in front of her chest. "John has been gone for what, two hours? And I bet you haven't moved since he went to work."
“In the vestry on the other end of the building, helping Mary with her preparations just as I was helping John with his.”
He shook his head and walked back to the door, then turned and whined, jerking his head towards the door.
The next morning, right after their walk, Sherlock deposited John with Mrs Hudson and instructions not to feed him anything for at least two hours. Naturally, the door to her flat had barely closed behind him before Mrs Hudson gave John a biscuit from the new batch she had made the day before.
They would be entirely undisturbed. Just the two of them. That would give John ample opportunity to stare. And then who knew what might happen if Sherlock tilted his head in a certain way or met his gaze for too long.
"Sherlock," John says, sounding rather breathless even to his own ears as he tries to process what the hell just happened. Oh right. The Christmas goose has just exploded.
The thought had only just occurred to him when Sherlock stilled and then quite suddenly backed away as if burned. John opened his eyes and found Sherlock two paces away, breathing heavily and looking rather shell-shocked, as if he had not expected his own behaviour.
Just a year or two ago, he would have considered getting a live pig and blasting it with telepathy to see how much energy it took to kill it, but somehow he found himself balking at the thought. He tried to reason that animals not of the changeling variety didn't have the same level of mental shielding as changelings did, which would nullify the whole experiment, but deep down he knew it was merely an excuse. A good, solid excuse, yes. But an excuse nonetheless.
"... utterly unacceptable behaviour. I'll do something about it, just you wait and see! What are bins even for if people don't use them? What are people's brains good for if they can't even grasp the straightforward concept of trash disposal?!"
There had been no deadline given by either of them, perhaps consciously so. Neither wanted to put any more pressure on their friendship. The strain was already too much for them to bear easily. The last thing either of them wanted was to put them on a timeline.
Lestrade nodded. "Right. Anyway, we don't want to get between a newly mated pair. John might tear us apart."
Even now, Sherlock had already half turned away from him and was staring down the hallway in the direction the waiter had gone with the trolley. Dear god, someone had seen them. Whatever had caused this moment of madness, someone had seen them.
Well, on the stairs. They're wedged onto the narrow steps next to each other, still in their coats, giggling and clearly utterly drunk. They seem to be having a conversation about reputations. From what Sally can make out, Holmes doesn't remember what his is for. It makes her grin.
The victim got on the train, the train moved and stopped at several stations, the victim developed a nosebleed and dropped dead. Panic in the carriage, everyone left, the police arrived.
Even as he had said that he would have let John get married, his arms had tightened by the tiniest fraction and John was sure he hadn’t imagined the slight waver in Sherlock’s voice as he’d said
- made his fingers itch like this, the constant urge to reach out and pat his head, stroke his back, scratch that spot behind his ears he knew perfectly well dogs loved having scratched. He even had evidence that this was also true for John-the-dog, thanks to Sally Donovan.
Sherlock twitched in his sleep and shifted, turning onto his side and flinging out his arm until his hand came to rest on John's back before lying still again. John could sense him slipping into a deeper sleep and wished with all his heart that Mycroft's scientists would find a cure soon. He didn't know how much longer he could take being this close and yet so far away.
"Sherlock," he muttered, mind spinning and rational thought spiralling away from him. "This isn't right. We need to stop."
John merely grinned at him. “Yes,” he said. “Just like the good old days. Sherlock, do you want to go to the Yard as well?”
"There was a treasure here," Sherlock said, pointing at the hotel. "Our victim found it. That's how he got the money, how he was able to suddenly afford an expensive watch and an engagement ring. He found a treasure."
They continued eating and John finally gave up on any attempts to get more of the wonderful pasta and mince, returning to his own bowl to eat the remnants of his dinner. He pointedly licked the bowl clean before hopping onto the sofa and curling up there.
He knew he could follow Sherlock - it didn't need a consulting detective to find the kitchen, after all - but Sherlock clearly wanted to get some distance between them, probably in the hopes that John would forget all about it and not mention the topic again.
The BBC news were the usual collection of international and national affairs, politicians being either idiots or arseholes or both, bizarre events, and finally the weather.
"Mr Holmes," Mrs Munkeld said, clearly caught by surprise when he entered. "I didn't expect you to come by. How did you get in here?"
He handed it to Sherlock, who stared at the bag for a couple of seconds as if John had just performed an incomprehensible magic trick before snatching it from John's hand and upending the contents into his hand. He carefully put on his watch and then slid the ring back onto his finger, staring down at it with an unreadable expression. "How?"
"Remember that time when you got stabbed by a rival for a nice mattress and John Watson stitched you back up and made sure you wouldn't die of an infection?"
John raised his head and looked at him, pondering the question. Chasing a criminal through London's streets on four legs instead of two? It sounded like fun!
"There they are," Lestrade said, being the first to notice the three people headed their way. They emerged from underneath the trees and approached quickly - two males and one female.
Sherlock crouched down in front of him and ruffled his fur one last time. "See you in a couple of minutes, John. If it helps, you have been a very good dog."
Distantly, he was aware of the uneven house wall pressing into his back, of the slowly setting sun shining against his closed right eye that would make him momentary blind later.
The DI nodded. "I don't intend to let her slip away now we've got her." He sighed. "And I still have to inform Mrs Forsythe of her grandson. Perhaps at least one good thing will come out of this."
He must have been knocked out, probably by hitting his head somewhere. He supposed there was a chance that he had come into contact with some kind of chemical.
They are, as far as she can tell, a perfectly ordinary elderly couple. Upon closer inspection, though, she can't help but find traces of Sherlock in them. His mother's eyes, cheekbones and mouth, his father's statue.
All he knew was the memory of Sherlock, freshly back from the dead and staring at John with eyes too big for his face as he begged for forgiveness in a tube car rigged with exlosives and the way his voice had broken when he had pointed out that John would still have a life with Mary if Sherlock hadn't come back at all.
Earlier, it had seemed hard to believe that his race had ever given up kissing. But now, with the aftershocks of his orgasm still lingering in his system, the thought that they had given up sex was utterly incomprehensible. He'd rather give up anything but this.
"I have no idea what on earth you are talking about," John informed him, wondering if maybe he should record this whole conversation on his phone to preserve it for generations to come - and for Lestrade, who would have the time of his life listening to it.
"So how do you know there was one, apart from the smell?" Donovan asked. "Baby powder can be used for all sorts of other things, not to mention adults with very sensitive skin."
He rolled his hips before Sherlock could open his mouth and let his rational mind ruin the moment for them and Sherlock's head dropped back, a sharp moan spilling from those lips. "Oh, oh god, John!"
He wouldn’t have dared say any such thing even half an hour ago. But half an hour ago John hadn’t yet made it perfectly clear that he intended to pursue whatever was between them. It was an odd concept to try and wrap his head around, like being told that Father Christmas was real after all and that you were on the
John shoved the thought away and was surprised to find that his body had betrayed him - his hand was hovering over Sherlock's face, just a moment away from touching him after all.
The paper had been folded up several times and felt soft in the way paper did when it had been handled often. It unfolded easily in John's hand, almost falling open on its own accord. It had probably been unfolded and refolded many times over. He felt his heart sink - if the paper was old, it was unlikely that it contained any information relevant to finding Rosie. But he had to know.
He pulls another pack out of the bag. "A thermometer? We have at least three in that drawer over there."
“I’ll hold you to that,” Sherlock replied and there was a smile in his voice. “But I need you to know that I’ll forgive you even if it happens again. I’m afraid you can’t get rid of me that easily. That ship has sailed, John.”
"Just ... tell him I don't want to see him just now, all right? I just ... I can't do it right now. I think I could face anyone but him."
"There's nothing for me to gain," Sherlock added before John could get precisely the right idea about his reasoning. "It's been four months and these papers are the only reason you came to speak to me at all. Perhaps it is that easy for you to discard all that we had for the sake of a sulk, but I refuse to engage. I have given you time, I have kept my distance. I waited for you to come to me so we could talk. The moment I sign these papers, you'll be out the door and I won't see you again."
“I love how responsive you are,” he murmured in Sherlock’s ear after a couple of minutes of this. “And I’ve barely touched you yet. What do you think will happen when I start taking you apart with my hands and mouth?”
Before she reaches it, there's the sound of the front door opening and closing and steps going up the stairs.
Hardly any of the light made it all the way to their hiding place. None of the guards had considered patrolling here, either. Sherlock merely grumbled something about incompetence, as though his crazy plan didn't hinge on them staying undetected until it was time to catch the vandals in the act.
He sat down in the grass, then stretched out on his back next to Sherlock, leaving a good half metre between them. No need to get overly familiar when Sherlock so clearly couldn't even compute his presence here. That was all right. He had nothing but time.
John laughed. "Hm, yes, wouldn't have pegged him to be your type, to be honest. Then again, up until recently, I didn't know you had a type at all."
"How safe is the process?" Sherlock demanded. "John is a dog, not a guinea pig. I will not have him treated as such."
He had somehow managed to get John out of the flat so he could have a proper breakdown and then he had gone deep into his mind palace, thrown open the vault carrying his every memory of John, and had added a second vault, even deeper down, even more secure, only for his goddaughter.
"Oh, for heaven's sake!" With a huff, Sherlock moved forward and grabbed a hold of John's head, making sure to keep his grip gentle. "Now be a good boy and don't move," he ordered.
He finally found him after squeezing past two people who might be investment bankers; he was standing at the edge of the room and talking animatedly to a handsome man about his own age. At first, John thought he was subtly interrogating the man and so he hung back, not wanting to interrupt the conversation in case Sherlock was steering it in a particular direction.
Sherlock has always been there, following him around or standing by his side, a lanky shadow with a barely concealed smile on his lips and hope in his eyes.
"Certainly. If they smelled any stronger of one another, I'd have trouble distinguishing them with my eyes closed. Anyway, I will be going over there in the morning to take John's statement, see if we can make sense of all this while Sherlock is still out."
"Unless you decide it smells interesting or want to analyse the different flavours or can't be arsed to unwrap a nutrition bar," John grumbled.
It felt like no time at all since his discharge, but at the same time he couldn't believe it hadn't been in an entirely different life.
Sherlock clamped down tight on any hint of sentiment. It seemed to come so much more easily to him these days. He used to have to fight to feel anything, used to have to think about every notion inside of him to figure out if it might be labelled 'feeling'. Now, emotions rushed at him, springing readily to hand. He rarely knew what they were but he was getting better at figuring it out, at making connections between his thoughts and the resulting sentiment.
Sally gaped at him. Objectively speaking and when he kept his mouth shut, Sherlock Holmes was an attractive man in an expensive coat with an adorable dog. And he really had no idea why women kept talking to him? Oh boy.
Sherlock had huffed and puffed and complained about John's weight and John had been able to hear the strain in his voice and increased heart rate, but the stubborn man had refused to let him down.
John's coat was slung over the back of his chair and his bag rested next to it. Time to test a theory, then.
Since it was still before noon on a workday and most people were in fact at work, the Sainsburys was mostly empty, which gave them an advantage. They made it almost all the way to the till before an employee noticed them.
"You went to war and came back injured, of course you have a therapist. Standard procedure. Shoulder, was it?"
The mere thought of the other Psy sent a shiver down John's back. He hadn't needed to see his light-specked black eyes to know that the man was a Cardinal. Power radiated off of him like heat off asphalt in the sun. John wasn't up to date on current politics but if Mycroft Holmes wasn't either a Councillor or just about to become one, he would eat his own tail.
Getting his hands on Sherlock’s body seemed essential in a way he couldn’t quite keep buried and this was the best solution he had been able to come up with - a combination of satisfying his need to touch and doing something nice for Sherlock, something that would actually make him feel better. And John had to admit it made him feel better, too, to be able to do something against these scars, to at least help with the healing if he hadn’t been there to patch them up or prevent them from ever being caused in the first place.
can let go. I hardly know anything anymore, John. All I know is you're getting married in a month and I can't let go." He gasped for breath in between the rush of words, tried to get enough air in his lungs to continue. "I thought... before I died I thought if I just gave you more time to get used to the idea, you might ... and we could ... but time ran out too soon and there was nothing I could do and I spent two years clinging to that thought, telling myself that if only I made it back home alive ..."
Sherlock made a non-committal hum to indicate that he was vaguely listening but mostly immersed in his mind. That was easy enough, and John bought it without question.
Emily grinned. "Yep. And we're proud of it, too. Just imagine, when I'm senior healer, I can actually overrule my alpha if I think he's endangering his or anyone else's health."
"I'll cope, eventually. I've survived so far, it's bound to-to fade sometime, isn't it? All this sentiment. It'll go away, after a while. God knows where it came from, it'll be gone before I know it, I'm sure. And in the meantime, since you're apparently not even going to talk to me, kindly leave me alone."
He was close to drifting off when John finally spoke again. “I can’t fault you for that,” he said, voice quiet and oddly pained. “And I don’t know how I ever managed to give you that impression when all I ever wanted was to have you here with me. Sometimes I think I don’t know myself very well.”
“Please sit down, Dr Watson,” the officer urged, reaching for his shoulder to press him back into his chair. “Mr Holmes is currently being interviewed by one of my colleagues. You can see him when we are done.”
"Not really," Sherlock said. "We'll have to wait and see what Molly has to say about the body. If John is right, there is a chance our killer will either have wiped himself out and be too tired for another attempt for at least a day or two, or ..."
“No dogs in the bedroom,” he found himself saying. “And I mean it this time. I’ve already got everything I want in there.”
John gave a low, confirming bark and nodded his head. Sherlock's scent was a comforting background detail, integral to his peace of mind but not actually something that overwhelmed his senses to the extent of drowning out everything else. He knew his scent intimately and it was therefore just a matter of separating Sherlock's scent from all the strange smells the flat had to offer.
"So they can kill us all in our beds, probably," Patricia said and the others, while laughing at her drama, nevertheless looked a bit worried.
"-your dissonance, I want you to tell me immediately. Understood?" He put on his best Captain Watson voice, knowing that his doctor voice was not going to be enough in this case - Sherlock frequently ignored what was best for his body in the pursuit of knowledge. Then again, he also wasn't big on taking orders.
Molly laughes a little and blushes. "No, uh, I was ... actually I was wondering if I should get Sherlock something."
"What did you see?" John asked, making everyone turn to him. He looked more composed now, the mask of composure firmly back in place. "You've seen something. What is it?"
“We’ve been going through all our cases to create a list of people who uttered threats against either or both of us or who might have reason to wish John harm. I’ve been logging everything in an Excel sheet. Give us another couple of days and I’ll e-mail you the entire thing, including name, case specifics and the type of threat uttered - ad verbatim where possible.”
John responded gladly, moaning softly as their kiss deepened again, and let the hunger another inch off its leash.
Unable to talk as he was, John had no other option than to accept this and keep pace as Sherlock turned back the way they had come.
He managed to raise his head and give her a weak smile. "Thank you, Mrs Hudson. I really don't know what I'd do without you sometimes."
“Doubtful,” Sherlock said, tilting his head. “It would have to be an extremely inept murderer to confuse Major Sholto in parade uniform with Mary in a wedding dress.”
"... we could get some fresh air out on the balcony," the young man says, everything about him suggesting that fresh air is not what he's after.
. And she died. But he came back. And so maybe she can... he’ll know. He’ll ...” He broke off, another thought occurring to him. “I didn’t even check her pulse.”
She's on patrol, something that doesn't usually fall into her job description but as she told Mrs Hudson, beggars can't be choosers and it's all hands on deck for larger events in the city.
He remembered how Sherlock had clung to him back at the hospital all those weeks ago when John had hugged him, how tightly Sherlock had held on to him. The devastation on his face when he had thought someone had stolen his wedding band. His joy on their outing to the museum, the light in his eyes whenever he had looked at John. God, how could he have been so blind? Looking back, it had been obvious.
He ended the call soon afterwards and stretched indulgently before staring up at the ceiling with a sigh. What to do with the information he had gotten? Clearly Psy were capable of emotion just like everybody else. Equally clearly, most of them either didn't want to be or were absolutely terrified of it. He, too, would be terrified if someone was threatening him with what the Psy called 'rehabilitation' and what John considered an act of violence.
John lay down on the sitting room floor and watched as Sherlock unpacked the groceries for the sheer novelty of the sight. He honestly couldn't recall a single time where Sherlock had voluntarily gone shopping, except for that one time when he had left without a word and came back three hours later with two dozen bananas. John had never found out what that particular experiment had been about. Somehow, it had never seemed important. Just another incident in living with the nutball that was Sherlock.
"An outsider wouldn't have known that," Sherlock pointed out. "I only know because it says so in the brochure in our room."
He traced the scent up the stairs and to a closed door that most likely led into Benjamin Forsythe's childhood room. No doubt he had still made use of it when coming over to visit his parents. The scent did not grow stronger, though, leading John to conclude that whatever had caused it could not be found inside the room.
"Well done," Sherlock told him, moving forward and crouching down to ruffle the side of his neck and his head with both hands. "Good boy."
He clicked forward through the other pictures. He and Sherlock had been in the vestry from just before Mary arrived at the church until after she got shot, so most of the pictures were of scenes he hadn't gotten to see: the guests mingling, Mrs Hudson in a massive hat, Molly looking beautiful in her dress and, surprisingly, Lestrade staring at her with a slightly dumbstruck expression on his face. John smirked at that and heard Sherlock snicker beside him.
"Oh yes. Taught himself code and programmed an app to track their alcohol consumption." Molly glances towards the door. "Clearly it didn't work well."
"You never said," John croaked, shaking his head. "All these years, all those people making comments and you never said a word. Not once."
He stepped forward, the soldier never once leaving his side and staying so close to him they were almost touching. A personal bodyguard?
He will never forget the look on John's face as he asks, the surprise and the confusion and the precise moment where John realises that this has been coming for a long time. He will never forget the tiny flare of warmth in John's gaze for as long as he lives.
