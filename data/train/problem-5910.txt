“Just rumors, I guess. Stuff you hear.  That sort of thing,” Fury replied with a low shrug, dangling that out there for Steve to reach.
His words, his thoughts, his feelings, these were the only weapons left to him at the moment, and Steve knew that he had wielded them to hurt Tony. Because he was angry, because he wanted Tony to taste a little of the powerlessness that crawled over him like a second skin, burrowed down into him until giving up seemed like a choice he wanted to make instead of something that only happened when there was no choice at all.
Steve tried to ignore DUM-E for a moment, but the little robot just nudged him again, so he sighed in resignation and bent to take whatever it was from DUM-E’s claw, intending to throw it to the other side of the workshop so he’d have a chance to finish his talk with Tony while the bot searched for his toy. As he took the wad from DUM-E, he happened to look askance at Tony, only to find the other man staring at him with what could only be described as wide-eyed horror.  Steve started to ask what the matter was when he looked at the paper in his hand and caught the familiar red, white and blue color scheme.  He frowned, starting to peel the paper apart and spread it out, and sure enough, there was his poster, the one from marketing, and he tried not to be hurt by this, that Tony had destroyed it like this, using it as some kind of wastepaper toy for his bots, because really, it was just a mock-up, there would be thousands more, so it wasn’t like it was special or anything.  It was just…well, thinking about his careful sketches of Tony and what those had meant to him, what he’d been trying to convey with them, wanting the world to see Tony and not just Iron Man…yeah, it hurt that Tony hadn’t thought of his poster as anything but trash.  It was even a bit sticky in places and covered with the splatter of something caked on it, and he couldn’t pretend that didn’t sting just a---wait.
“I’ve heard,” Steve replied flatly.  At that, Tony barked out a warm laugh, seeming to surprise both of them.
“Sure, I--why not?” Steve replied.  A frisson of unease wound down his spine, but he couldn’t find any reason for it.  True, Brock’s friends were loud and often pretty coarse, especially when they drank, but they weren’t terrible people or anything.  Rollins had even given Steve a job after he got fired from his last one.  And they
He did eat then, though not much.  The boy was right, after all.  When they finished, they sat in silence for a few minutes, which seemed to be the expiration of how long Cam could sit still, because the boy was up and moving around the room before Steve could admonish him against it.
to do more,” Tony corrected, throwing his hands wide, then clapping them together with a grimace.   “I can.  I can do more.  And because I can, I have to.  There’s so much,” he stopped, shaking his head.  “There’s so much wrong in the world.  So
“We have a number of very deviants from all over, my Lord—halfings, those who are at once both male and female, deformities and grotesques for all manner of tastes, should you—“ Rumlow began.
“Yeah,” Steve acknowledged.  He reached for a finer-bristled brush and started working some earth tones on the shape of Kirk’s figure where it reclined indolently on the vague lines of the bench, almost as if he was floating, then pulled back and looked at the image with a frown.  At least the talk of his parents was enough to banish most of his less than pure thoughts regarding Kirk.  Well, he amended, peering around the canvas at Kirk’s abashed face pulled into a frown of apology, most of his impure thoughts, anyway.
“I did not truly think so,” Cam replied, sounding somewhat relieved.  “Our carriage is very beautiful, is it not?” Cam observed, reaching out to run a hand over the silk-lined interior.  “The finest in the whole world, I think.”
methods.  But, we need you.  The world needs you.  Now, it’s damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap.  You want Stark and your little cabin or whatever? Fine. The world’s going to give you that, because we need you.  You get my drift?”
Silences had never been his best moments, Tony thought, as the car drove through the gate and past the guard house.  Coulson was reading something on his tablet, and their driver, a short, stocky man impossibly named Happy, occasionally pointed out various points of interest, which, in this area, largely amounted to restaurants where you could get a great burger, the junior food store with a beer cave, and a tackle store that had crickets by the hundred, which Tony assumed was so you could fish for Megalodon or something.
Shellhead stilled, then slowly pulled back, his eyes bright on Steve.  His face was tight and filled with something that looked a lot like despair, though the expression was gone so quickly that Steve thought he might have mistaken it in the low moonlight.  Shellhead sank back down in the water a bit and laid his head on the edge of the Marvel, watching Steve with his usual interest, though there was something different about it tonight, like some pall clung to him that Steve didn’t understand, because shouldn’t Shellhead be happy they were going back, Steve thought, his brow furrowing into a frown, though he reclined back again, curling himself into the curve of the boat’s stern.
With a small groan, Tony pushed himself up and out of bed, nearly tripping over his shoes where he had toed them off the night before after retreating to his room.  When he opened his bedroom door and peeked out, the hallway was clear.  He darted to the bathroom and took care of his bladder, then washed his hands and stared at the figure in the mirror.
Tony just shook his head.  “I could’ve pressed, Steve.  Or just found out on my own.  Obie did.  The truth is, I didn’t want to know because I knew whatever it was, this would have to stop if I knew, and I’m just that selfish when it comes down to it.  I’m a fixer, Steve.  That’s what I do.  Make things better, take something and improve it.  But I knew if I fixed you, you could leave me.  And I’m that much of a son-of-a-bitch.”  Tony was still resolutely studying the food truck, refusing to look at Steve, which was driving Steve crazy.
His mouth tasted like sand, making him want to spit, but he couldn’t quite get enough saliva to form to do anything, so he settled for licking his tongue over cracked lips and trying to push himself up on his elbows.
Somewhere to his right, a bird cawed loudly and another responded in kind, probably hoping for a handout, since Steve often brought seeds with him when he visited.  He sighed and stood up, walking slowly back down the path towards the gate.  His mind was so full of disquiet, he nearly ran into the woman before drawing himself up short.  It was so unexpected that it took him a span of heartbeats to let his mind catch up to what his eyes were seeing.
Stepping out of the shower and turning off the water, Steve swiped a hand over the fogged-up mirror, staring at his reflection.  This had to stop.  Whether Tony suspected or not, something was clearly driving a wedge between them, something Tony seemed unwilling to talk about, which really, that left precious few things.  Emotions and feelings being top of that list.  So, it seemed likely that Tony had some inkling of how Steve felt about him and it was making him wildly uncomfortable.  Steve knew he couldn’t compartmentalize this part of his attraction to Tony from the emotional part. The only solution was to stop all of it.  Not that he thought he could simply turn it off like a…well, like a faucet, but he could certainly train himself to stop making it an issue.  That started with leaving these…these fantasies behind and letting that part of it go.  He could do that.  He could definitely do that.
Calhoun was trying to nod.  Or, at least, Steve felt his head jerk spasmodically where Steve’s hand was clamped around his throat. He thought it might have been a nod.  Probably, Calhoun was sorry.  Probably he was really, really sorry. Steve didn’t much care.  Sorry didn’t erase those things he said about Tony.  The things he thought about Tony.  Steve found he didn’t like the idea of Calhoun--or any of them, really--thinking about Tony.  He didn’t like it at all. They shouldn’t be doing that.  Tony was his. They needed to understand that.
Steve stared down into the liquid pools of Tony’s eyes, tracing their edges lightly with his finger.  He gently brushed against one crease, a smile starting to crinkle around Tony’s eyes, and moved his charcoal pencil back into position to refine the image a bit.  He could never quite get the expression on Tony’s face just right.  It probably had something to do with the fact that Tony was movement given form, whatever his expression was one moment, the next emotion was already bleeding into it, leaving it impossible to truly capture on the page.  Didn’t stop Steve from trying though.  Again, and again, and again, he thought with a sigh.  Glancing up from his position on the sofa in Tony’s workshop, he realized Tony was still talking to him.  Or at him.  It was hard to tell sometimes.  Generally, a response from Steve wasn’t required, though he knew Tony enjoyed the company more than he’d admit.  Or maybe he just liked an audience.  Again, Steve was left with shifting sands under his feet, never quite able to find any sense of solid ground with Tony.
“Seems unlikely, but you never know.  You know anything about cyber-stalking?  No?  Good.  Don’t bother looking into it.  Nothing on the Internet about it, anyway.  I, uh—I might need to kind of keep an eye on things,” Tony replied, lifting his head to look back up at Steve.  “Just, you know, to be sure everything’s okay.”
“A normal gift.  Like, I don’t know, a board game?” Steve suggested as he sunk down onto his sofa and leaned back, a smile fighting to form.
Tony’s gaze dropped down to where Steve slept in the bow of his arms, as at peace as Tony had ever seen him.  For a moment, the need to protect, to stop everything in its tracks, to keep what was coming for them at bay, to keep Steve like this, to give him
“So,” Steve said, then hissed as Tony’s hand found his nipple and squeezed.  “Tony,” he warned in a low huff.
Steve sighed and held his hands up in a placating gesture.  “Give me the damn bread,” he grumbled, knowing when he was beaten.  Cam, much like Steve’s own mother, and probably just about anyone who had gone hungry too many times to count, held tight to the certainty that food could fix most of what ailed anyone.
“One cannot live by the same fruit forever, Your Majesty, no matter how delectable such fruit may be,” the Ul said, nodding towards Steve with a false sort of appraising deference that made the hairs on the back of Steve’s neck stand up. “I am sending you my son and two of my most treasured concubines. Why not cement the strength of our bond and the trust between us by sharing what you value most, eh? We have heard, even down here, how much the King favors his Prize.” His eyes flicked over to Steve. “What is one night when you will be so well entertained by my own gifts?” he asked, reaching out a hand to cup the woman’s naked bottom, kneading the supple flesh in his hand.
Next to him, Steve could feel the shock and discomfort seeping off of Tony in waves, though his expression betrayed none of this, and the Ul seemed blissfully unaware.
“Big black hole. Gotcha,” Steve chuckled, then turned serious.  “You should be very proud of yourself, Tony. Really.  I don’t know how you got that out of all those numbers, but everyone was so impressed.  I could tell,” Steve replied. Tony almost took a wrong step at that and lost his footing as he took the last couple of steps down to the parking area, but Steve reached out a hand to steady him.  “They, ah. They thought you were fantastic.  Brilliant and…they were just really—ah, they were really happy to have you.”
“Don’t be alarmed, Captain Rogers,” a lilting voice announced from overhead. Steve jumped and looked up.
“Of course, of course, I understand,” Maria said, glancing quickly at Tony.  “Your job must be very important, I’m sure.”
“You’re prettier when you’re quiet,” the King remarked, almost idly, then leaned back over the table and picked up the quill.  “The arch is too low for the crossbowman.  Need to keep the weight down so the damn thing rolls,
Tony had already noticed that his own phone wasn’t in his pocket any longer, and when he chanced a side-eyed look towards the men, he noticed one of them—the younger one, he thought—had it in his hand and was staring down at the lock screen with a vaguely sick look on his face. Tony and Steve smiled back at the pale-faced man from one of their wedding photos, the one where Steve had just leaned down and whispered something in Tony’s ear about the photographer being more of a drill sergeant than his actual drill sergeant. Which was saying something considering Phillips.
“What can I say?” Steve asked, running the rough pad of his thumb back and forth along the line of exposed skin as his hands lowered to cup Tony’s ass.  “It’s the most wonderful time of the year.”
“I didn't—I didn't think you would think—I mean, Coulson handled everything for you, and I left my passcode on the computer. I thought you'd be... pleased? Or, maybe not pleased, that's not, I mean, of course, not that I don't hope you're pleased, but, I guess, maybe relieved is more...damn, I'm not,” Steve stammered, a crease forming between his brow as his mouth flattened into a thin, tight line. It occurred to Tony for the first time that Steve's longer than expected absence may have been deliberately designed to give Tony some time to himself, time to get used to his new situation before his Alpha showed up.
If he opened the cabinet above the coffee maker, he would find his mug and the Captain America mug that Steve grudgingly used because it made Tony smile.   His equation was still written across the front of the refrigerator, buttressed by Steve’s rocket and a note with a grocery list from their last visit affixed by a magnet with a picture of a beaver wearing an MIT shirt.
“I like his dumb jokes,” Tony blurted out, raising his eyes to hers.  “And how much of a complete troll he can be, like some kind of an asshole version of Gomer Pyle because it just doesn’t compute when he’s so—so—you know about everything, and how he does this thing where he listens and notices and cares.  I mean, yes, that’s ridiculously annoying at times, goes without saying,” Tony added, slashing his hand through the air in front of him, before biting his lip and looking out at the vista glittering in front of him.  “It’s just…I like him.  He’s smart and funny and good and--I like him, and my weapons killed his friends, who were, let’s recap, all pinned down in that shithole because they were looking for me.  And somehow, this whole thing—the stripping, the crappy phone, the fucking
They would see the same substance again, much later, on ships that next time, and Steve would end up in the sea with what was left of the Valkyrie and the rest of Schmidt’s fleet, but they had stopped it from reaching the city harbor, where Schmidt’s massive cannons could have launched a devastating assault.  He remembered Schmidt, the man’s face horribly disfigured, raving about power, and all around him, the smell of a kind of fire that had never known the taste of wood, but burned on its own, wild and free, wherever it went, on rocks and stone, melting steel, even on water, like some demon’s blood from the old tales.  Everything burned.  Everything, except his shield, which kept him alive long enough to wake up wanting to die.  It was likely in its own watery grave now, Steve supposed.  Waiting for him.
“Rhodey’s Humvee was pretty severely hit, but everyone except the driver survived,” Steve told him, answering the rest by not mentioning it.
was the opposite of what I said?  Look, whatever it is that you’re holding back on, I’m going to find out, I am, because that’s what I do, and I think you know that, so you’re dropping these little breadcrumbs so that when I do, you can say, ‘ah-ha! I told you about that!’ Except, you didn’t, not really, and, hey,” Tony blustered, giving Steve a little shake.  ““Whatever it is, whatever happened that got you here, I don’t care? You really think I’m going to judge you?” Tony demanded with a groan of exasperation.  “Come on, you just heard me bare my soul over how much I’ve screwed the pooch in life, and if you want to go toe to toe on that column, I’ll see you a narcissistic personality disorder, volatility, self-obsession, a few too many daddy issues…stop me whenever you want, by the way.”
Tony sighed and tightened his hold. Steve could feel the fisted knuckles of Tony’s hand digging into his back, up and down the bones, kneading over stripes of mottled, unyielding flesh. He wondered if Tony was even conscious of the motion. It was strangely soothing, like he was being molded back together, shaped and reforged.
“Alright…thin mints…frozen or out of the box.  Wait,” Tony interrupted before Steve could answer, slicing his hand through the air and shaking his head.  “Trick question. Both are one-hundred percent amazing.  Um…who’d win in a fight, Captain America or Superman?”
“I know,” Tony agreed in a voice laced with regret. He looked down and glanced away, staring off into the distance at the mountains for a long moment. “I really must get back to Ross and the rest of them,” Tony sighed, glancing back over at Steve.
“Does it matter?” Tony asked harshly.  The nearly empty bottle of water folded in his hands, making a grating, crinkling noise as he released it.  “Look, either you want to do this or you don’t.  I’m sure How—my father already told you about me, so.”  So, get on with it.  Get it over with, whatever this is, please God, Tony silently begged.   Just get it over with.
Tony moved between Steve’s thighs and put one hand on Steve’s right knee, pushing it up so it bent next to Steve’s chest.  He repeated the motion with the other, until Steve was spread wide before him.  This should be horrifying, Steve thought, but it carried no force or sense of shame with it.  Tony would take care of him.  He had promised.
“They’re quite smart.  They train them to speak.  Some speak hundreds of words, and they can live as long as a man. The Atilan court keeps seven, as tradition, since their rulers take a vow of silence.  One of the birds only speaks insults, I’m told. I think I’d like that one best,” Tony grinned.
“Hi Anthony, I’m Steve.”  Too casual. Overly familiar. Presumed too much. They hadn’t even been officially introduced.
A black shape formed in the sky, low over the line of trees that formed a barrier to the road.  The helicopter turned on its lights once it reached the property, sending a bright, white beam over the entire scene.
Nah, that was silly. Everyone loved Tesla. Guy claimed to have actually built a death beam, for Christ’s sake. What’s not to love?  A grin slipped out at that thought, and Steve returned it, almost in surprise, though Tony noticed his shoulders loosen and settle a bit.
Tony stared down at where Steve sat, shoulders hunched as he prodded at the small structure he’d cobbled together.  “Fine, well,” Tony said with a sigh, and knocked one hand out, sending the parts skittering across the tabletop.  “You’re going to need to start with a good foundation for support.”
“Okay,” Tony said after a long moment of silence, during which Steve could swear he could hear both their hearts pounding.
And lately…lately, there had been other looks.  From the Alphas who sometimes came by the house to visit his parents.  Looks he couldn’t quite categorize, but they made him uncomfortable.  Disturbed in some way he couldn’t put his finger on, because they didn’t seem like bad looks. There were smiles and rapt glances, but they were
“I can’t…I can’t just go talk to this guy, Steve.  I can’t,” Tony objected, hunkering down against the leather car seat and clutching at his seatbelt.  “I’m not—I mean, I haven’t even.  I did some school, the basics, you know, but…nothing like this, Steve.  Nothing remotely like this.  I can’t…they’re going to think I’m…”  Ridiculous, his mind supplied, but he couldn’t quite say it.
“Well. I saw you knock yourself into the ceiling,” Steve said, tilting his head and looking skyward for a moment.
“Are you always like this?” Steve asked, shaking his head and biting his lip as he looked up at Stark.
“Our sommelier will have your wine out in a moment, Mr. Stark. The ’47 Petrus, was it?” the maitre’d asked. Tony shrugged and nodded.   Another waiter came by and filled their water glasses, while someone else spun in and dropped a basket of bread on the table, all with practiced grace.  “Excellent choice, Sir.”
“Don’t worry, Tony, just stay with me,” Steve urged, his voice strong and firm.  It was an order, Tony recognized, and the thought somehow made him almost giddy with happiness. Technically, that was probably the lack of oxygen, but whatever. Steve was alive, and Steve was
“We’re not seriously going to the Grand Canyon,” Steve protested as he watched the otherwise seemingly inexplicable helicopter approach.
“You’re fired.  He’s fired,” Tony said, turning to Steve, mouth pursed and eyes sharp with glee.  “No respect, I tell you.  Let’s go,” Tony urged as Hogan got out to open the door.  Steve crawled out after Tony, grabbed the hand that Tony extended and followed him inside the Forum Shops at Caesar’s Palace.  Meant to be a study in opulence, they were, in a word, gaudy as hell, Steve thought, with its columns and Romanesque statutes, even a replica of the Trevi fountain.  Instead of elegant and refined, the interior looked like the Olive Garden threw up on it, with nearly every surface that would stand still detailed with some color or edifice.
The thing with Steve was, he could question Tony’s decisions and somehow manage not to make Tony question himself, which was a God-damn Christmas miracle when you got right down to it.   And if they sometimes did their talking over a Lord of the Rings marathon, while Steve shouted at Aragorn to form a shield wall on the high ground in front of the Black Gate and then got so frustrated when they just let Sauron’s army completely surround them that the bowl of popcorn in his lap ended up all over the floor when he stood up to apparently make his point more thoroughly by yelling at the screen, well, all the better as far as Tony was concerned.
He did.  Sure, it took a bit. The graduate students and the few postdocs who were working that evening had clearly been gathered at the Professor’s behest thinking they were putting on some kind of show for some bigwig’s Omega who wanted to play scientist.
She didn’t so much as blink, Steve saw, stomach churning. Behind him, he heard a small sound from Cam, and turned to see the boy biting his lip, eyes wide.
“Hello,” Jarvis said, sounding a bit out of breath.  “Tony? Are you there?” Jarvis asked after a moment of silence.
“An opinionated young man, bit older than you, who followed me around and generally ignored my requests and did what he wanted. So,” Steve laughed, shaking his head.  “I guess you’re pretty much like not exactly a squire, then.”
Steve was quiet for a moment, and Tony could practically see the wheels turning while Steve decided what he wanted to say, and God-dammit, he just wanted to shake him.  Shake him and ask him why, why was it so easy to move on?  What had Tony done that made Steve want to end it in the first place?  Had Steve met this person and felt a connection, something he wanted to pursue, but being the upstanding guy he was when he wasn’t fucking Tony into oblivion, decided to break it off first?  What was it about her—this random no one who wasn’t---she wasn’t—she’s not me, Tony thought dully.  Why her and not me, wasn’t that really the question?  Did he honestly want an answer or did he just need to hear one?
Cam walked over to where the King sat and stood with his eyes on the floor, shuffling a bit back and forth on his feet.
“You flatter me. Finally. Cam would be proud,” Tony snorted.  “Keep going.  I like it, as any member of my Court can attest.  Little pleases me more than hearing a listing of my more admirable qualities by someone who is about to ask me for something.  Or we can just be done with this mummer’s farce and skip to the part where you tell me what you want.  Put that mouth to better use than fine words,” Tony suggested, taking another drink.
“Hey, everything okay in here?  I came by to get the samples and thought I heard a—you know, what, nevermind.  I’ll just come back, you know, never,” Bruce said from the doorway, backing away slowly while Steve and Tony turned to mutually stare at him.
Point being, at least he’d drunk-dialed his ex’s work number at 2 a.m. and not actually called Steve, who would probably do something obnoxiously dumb like…answer.  And then be understanding and helpful, the way he always had been, and maybe insist on coming to get Tony and taking him home, tucking him in bed and maybe staying for a while because he was concerned and wanted to make sure Tony was okay.  That would have obviously been terrible, Tony snorted, blinking as his eyes started to sting. Damnit Flopsy, this is all your fucking fault, Tony thought, giving a stern glare to the dark space under the nightstand.
“I don’t think Coulson really has a form,” Tony sighed and let his head thump against the wall again, next to where someone had scratched an anatomically impossible drawing of the MIT Beaver and Porky the Pig.
Rumlow was cruel, though, and exalted in the power he held.  Perhaps this Lord Hammer was not.  Perhaps it would not be so bad, Steve told himself, and for a moment, his belly filled with a rush a heat as his mind replayed the way the King’s hands had felt as they stroked Steve’s cock while the King teased and tormented Steve with his words.  He shifted uncomfortably on the pallet and felt his cock twitch at the memory. Shame licked a fire through his gut and coiled low and deep behind the ache and soreness, and he felt himself harden even more.  Rumlow had said he would like it, that he was made for it, and Steve had spat in his face, yet here he was, getting hard just thinking about what had happened with the King.
“Yeah,” Steve replied as he folded the clothes and set them on the back of the sofa in Tony’s bedroom.  “I, uh, didn’t really have anything clean to wear, so,” Steve said with a shrug, then looked up at Tony, who was still watching him, though his teasing, playful expression of a moment before was gone, and there was something dark and drawn that tightened his features for a moment before it slipped off.
“I’ll sign the damn cards,” Steve replied with a put-upon sigh, hands going to his hips and that little furor forming on his brow as he frowned.  Someone was getting the Disapproving Face, Tony thought somewhat smugly to himself.
“I—” Steve started, then broke off, grinding down the words.  The truth was, he didn’t know what he was doing. Going forward.  Head down, shoulders back. That was it. Momentum. That was all there was some days.  “I never liked bullies. Didn’t much matter what flag they hid behind. All I ever wanted to do was protect people who needed it.  I like to think I’m doing that here. Sir.”
“He’s an idiot,” Skinny Steve said, then bent his head sucked the length of Tony’s cock down his throat and moaned, giving Tony’s balls a hard tug for good measure.
“Did Tony tell you he’s going to be doing some work for SHIELD,” Steve told Jarvis, sounding, if Tony wasn’t mistaken, somewhat proud of the idea. Though, that made sense, given Steve’s interest in expanding the company, Tony supposed, but it still made a warm pleasure fill his chest and stomach.
Small talk, mostly some kind of one-upmanship between Tony’s boarding school and MIT days and Steve’s lack of self-preservation both growing up and in boot camp, got them safely through the rest of the meal, which was, Steve could admit, incredibly delicious, even if he didn’t know what half of the food he was eating was, even after the waiter explained the courses.  Dessert, it turned out, would be waiting for them on the High Roller, something that Steve was fairly sure was a bit of an off-the-menu accommodation, but Tony was Tony, so of course, one of the best restaurants in the country delivered to a giant Ferris wheel.  Why not?
He wondered how long Steve had studied it before catching sight of Tony’s little bit of rebellion. He wondered how often Steve took the picture out, held it up and looked at the image, what he thought about when he did, if he did.  What he saw there that Tony still couldn’t quite see.  He saw coltish angles and uncooperative hair.  A terrible suit and more eye make-up than he needed unless he was trying out for the role of the Black Swan.  An expression that hugged the border between mutinous and terrified.
“You missed a hell of an after-party, gorgeous!” Hammer continued as he walked to what was presumably his car.  “I’d say ‘Maybe next time,’ but I’m a bit more particular than Stark there.  Don’t much care for someone else’s leavings, myself,” Hammer crowed delightedly.
Steve craned his neck up and captured Tony’s mouth in a searing kiss that left Tony dizzy and lightheaded.  He smiled, then blinked down at Steve. That was Steve’s signal. Except, Tony had no idea what to do now. Steve had said it was supposed to be different, but Tony didn’t know if that meant maybe he was supposed to assume some other position or do something else entirely.  He bit his lip and looked up at Steve from under his lashes.
Tony heard the click of the cup as Steve put it down on the table, then the bed sank down next to his shoulder.  He felt the lightest of touches across his chest, enough to make the shadows move, like a campfire game.  What shape will he make of me?
Steve nodded and dropped his hand.  He left Tony to his task and walked out the chamber door, which one of the guards held open for him.  No one waited on the other side.  He was free to roam the King’s personal rooms and come and go from his own quarters to the King’s as he wished.
“Technically,  I didn’t cheat,” Steve argued with a small smile playing on his lips as he sipped his champagne.
Steve had been away at some conference with Sam at the time, though Tony had been able to get through to him eventually.  He must have seen the show on TV because he got all testy about the whole thing, truth be told.  Don’t go to the apartment, Tony.   Stay off the roads, Tony. Wait for Clint, Tony.  Lots of orders, that day.  Orders, orders, orders, Tony thought with a fond sigh. Steve did like his orders.  Sometimes, that could be a boon for Tony, admittedly, but that had not been one of those times, which sucked because watching the whole thing go down on TV had been, um, stimulating, Tony recalled.  Still, Tony had obligingly followed Steve’s very strident suggestions, at least that time, if only because Steve did truly sound panicked.  Tony had complained about it a lot after Steve finally got back from his conference, though.  Two weeks at Clint’s farm?  No one deserved that.
“Steve, don’t encourage him,” Ms. Potts ordered, one hand over the phone’s speaker.  She held a finger up in the air to shush whatever Tony was going to say to that and went back to her phone conversation.  Tony shot Steve a shit-eating grin and went back to pushing his food around on his plate.
“Accidentally?” Steve asked, cocking his head in a questioning gesture. “Nevermind. Its fine, Tony. Forget it. So, you, what? Want to...” Steve let the words trail off with a quick shake of his head. He looked down at the counter, hands going to his hips in the Steve-is-deciding-something pose that Tony remembered so well, then dragged his eyes back up to Tony. “There's a coffee shop down the street. Want to get something?”
“Fine.  Give it here,” Tony said with a sigh, downing the damn thing in a couple of bites.  “See?  All gone. Oh, that figures,” Tony huffed out a laugh as Steve clapped his hands together in obvious delight.  “I do what you say and get applause, huh?”
“You want to learn to drive,” Steve repeated.  Tony nodded, then looked down at the bottom of his yogurt cup, scraping the spoon along the sides, mostly for something to do.  “Help me understand why.”
“Don’t talk like that,” Steve objected, too loudly, he knew, and winced at his tone, more accusatory than he’d meant.  “You’re not bleeding out.”
“He did not know, Cam.  He would never allow you to be harmed,” Steve assured the boy. Tony could not have known.  Steve refused to believe it.  Tony had assumed Cam was Steve’s attendant from the beginning.  Tony would never countenance such a thing as Stane’s perversion. Even for someone he held in such high regard.  He wouldn’t.  Steve had to believe that, even as some traitorous voice in the back of his mind kept demanding to know how such a thing could have gone unnoticed for so long.  And yet, had Hydra not grown right under Fury’s ever-watchful eye?  Had not Steve himself spilled blood alongside several of Schmidt’s own?
“Yes, hmmm,” the Lord said and made a sort of tsking sound, as if Steve were a naughty child.  “I see what our good overseer here meant.  Well.  We can’t have that, now can we?” the man asked while Steve glared up at him.  Maybe they would kill him.  He had stopped caring about making out of this alive a long time ago.  Now, he just wanted out.
“Not you,” Kirk said, sitting up more and holding Steve’s eye.  “You’re not, are you?  You’re like…what’s the word I’m looking for…nice,” he finally settled on, pursing his lips around the word as if it tasted bad.  “Ugh, you are.  You’re all,” Kirk waved a hand at Steve.  “Nice and good and shit.”
“Anytime. Actually, every time.  I have a bus pass, remember,” Tony replied, standing up to move towards the door and managing to almost trip over the wheel of a stroller sticking out into the aisle, though Steve shot out a hand to grab his arm before he unironically face-planted into the Watch Your Step sign.  “It’s public transportation, Steve.  I’m the public,” Tony pointed out, when he regained his footing.
of time. I can’t—I can’t deal with all of this right now.  It’s too much.  I just, I can't right now.  If I try, I'm going to fall apart.  Last night, and then this, and--I thought I put all that behind me, you know?  And now…you just have to give me time. And probably a lot of therapy.  Let’s face it, that’s not entirely unneeded,” Tony snorted, giving Steve a quick glance before lowering his eyes again.
Tony cleared his throat and chanced a look over at Steve.  “It’s the oldest one we know of. It was probably here long before my people even thought of leaving the Ehrmon. The Iron Mountains,” he translated at Steve’s questioning look.  “People still come up here, sometimes. Ask the favor of the stone gods. Seek their blessing in return for an offering,” he added, pulling a small, wrapped bundle out of the breast of his tunic. Steve was about to ask what was in it when a thought occurred to him.
Steve wasn’t sure what he had been expecting, but it wasn’t this.  This was…wow. It was a lot to take in, if he were honest with himself.  Tony had been right about the scarring. It spider-webbed out from the center of his chest in long, jagged lines.  It was what was in the center that was so disconcerting. A large, ridged metal circle glowed with a soft, blue light that looked vaguely unnatural. Whatever the device was, it seemed to be embedded deep into Tony’s chest and thrummed with some kind of energy.
All that brilliance, all that energy, all that loudness, Tony could finally let it out, if he ever learned to trust Steve enough to do it.  Steve thought he might like that. He might like that a lot, he thought, as a punch landed hard enough to send the bag flying.  One down, he grinned, casting a quick look over his shoulder at Natasha, who raised a hand in a small wave of acknowledgment.
A million dollars.  A million. It kept repeating through Steve’s head like it was a needle skipping over the groove on a record.  A
“I’m just saying, this is par for the course for me as far as the Board and the press are concerned. Not totally without reason, admittedly,” Tony said.  “But, I mean, someone definitely had ‘drunkenly marries a stripper’ on their Tony Stark Relationship Bingo.”
“You had your legions spread out to defend the keeps along the road, here, here and here, but the wings were too tightly grouped to pull a flanking maneuver if an assault comes from the west,” Steve pointed out.  “The main attack would likely come through here, not across the bridge and straight through towards the city gates.  It’s not as direct, but it would avoid the bulk of your mortars and if they blew the bridge, they could cut off or slow the advance of the forces and wagons you have spread out along this line.  Supporting attacks would come from here and here, with a tertiary attack from the sea, if they have ships.  Your defenses were largely relying on encirclement from your cavalry and infantry divisions, but that’s presuming a slow-moving attack on one or two main fronts, and this way, with your wings here and here and the mortar cannons here on…on tracks, like this, see?  You could meet the secondary attack before it converged with the main assault.”
“Anyway, Barnes is hurt during the whole Gulmira thing.  Pretty badly, too, it seems.  I don’t have the medical records, but he was posted back stateside for medical treatment after a stint in Ramstein,” Rhodey said.  “Then, and here’s where things get murky…”
“Of course, I do not wish to intrude on such a new bond. I will happily give you the space your comfort requires, my friends,” Thor said amiably, wheeling his chair back what Tony considered an acceptable distance.
But hospitals were a whole other issue.  Hospitals smelled of death and disinfectant, sickly sweet to hide what was underneath.  He hated that smell, always had.  Too many visits when he was sick, then watching his mom go back time and time again, never seeming to get better, wondering if this was the last time as she shuffled down the hall to wait her turn behind a curtain with a quietly murmured lie, “Wait here, Stevie, I’ll be fine.” He found himself shivering against cold that wasn’t there.
“I am supposed to be reading through that stack of ledgers Rhodey has been haranguing me about,” Tony told him, nodding a bit towards the desk, which held all manner of books and parchments.  His voice was rough and worn sounding, but even then, Steve could hear the happiness in it.  “But, you are far more interesting than army requisition reports.”
Steve let out a long sigh, and crossed his arms over his chest again, hunching his shoulders forward like he was trying to make himself smaller, and maybe he was, which was somehow the the thing that sent fissures of horrified worry up and down Tony's spine.
Rhodey went quiet, though Tony could feel the weight of the other man’s presence through the phone.  Tony’s chest tightened.  He had to resist the urge to rub the heel of his hand into the reactor, where it thrummed between his ribs.  His stomach rolled, clenched.  His eyes prickled at the corners, so he rubbed at them, then blinked up at the ceiling.
“Steve,” Tony started, as gently as he could, because he was an utter asshole who hadn’t even thought, hadn’t even considered this, but he wasn’t quite that big of an asshole.  He should have thought of this, he knew.  Of course, he should have.  For Steve, the Forties were, what, a month ago?
Tony was beautiful like this, almost too beautiful, without any adornment except the thing that connected them, the metal that kept them both safe, Steve thought, somewhat dazedly, his mouth going dry with a familiar want. It was suddenly too warm in the room, though the fire burned low in the hearth. A bead of sweat dripped down his back, the skin prickling with heat. He was still in the clothes he’d worn for the trip home, but he made no move to remove them, just nudged Tony backwards onto the wide expanse of bed. Tony went without objection, sliding his arms around Steve to pull him to follow as he shimmied up the bed, all wiry muscle and taut, tanned skin, except where it puckered white around the shining metal disc in the center of his chest.
, all I’m saying is, fucking ballsy as hell, just putting it out there like that.  They probably do that. Rich guys.  Pay for no-strings-attached sex with those, what do you call them?  Escorts,” Brock recalled the word, snapping his fingers for emphasis. “Fancy.  Bet there’s an app for that,” he added with a laugh.  “We should call the Enquirer or something. Bet one of those tabloid rags would be all over this. Tony Stark Offers One Million For Night of Sex! God, if he did, people’d be lining up like it’s a God-damned free beer night at Yankee stadium.”
They didn’t, but it wasn’t long before Steve thought they regretted the choice.  When it was over, he stood among them, breathing heavily, the shield at his feet where the men were in strewn various states of discomfort and looked up at Tony, who was staring at him, mouth agape, like he had just sucked in a breath, eyes wide and darkened, though they gleamed with a fierce sort of avarice Steve had rarely seen cross Tony’s face.  A tremor ran through Steve’s body.  He looked down at the shield, lifted his foot and slammed it down on the edge, catching it with one hand as it leapt into the air, then looked up at Tony again.
“Tony, I can’t just let you mop up our mess.   You know Ross is just looking for a reason—“ Steve started.
Something rattled around Tony’s  brain, something he’d read ages ago, maybe during one of those special classes they made Alphas take during middle school, the ones they’d all snickered through.  Something some pseudo-intellectual Alpha, who probably couldn’t possibly actually attract an Omega if he'd had a Dirk Diggler-sized dick, had written about how an Omega preferred to climax once the Alpha had knotted, which was total Alpha propaganda bullshit, except now Tony was going to have to write up some incredibly stellar review for the asshole on Goodreads or something because as soon as Tony released his grip on Steve’s cock,  Steve kicked his pants the rest of the way off, and, in one swift motion, turned away from Tony. Steve fell forward, going down to all fours, and bowed his head to the ground, spreading his knees apart on the cushion and presenting himself to Tony, his hole already stretched wide and glistening bright with slick.
“Too late?” Tony replied, walking over towards where Steve was still straddling the now useless pieces of Doombot.  “No, I know.  I do.  I know.  I’m not—I’m really not.  I mean it.  I’m not going to do anything.  He’d hate it if we left a mission and someone got hurt.  I know that.”
“I feel like you’re picturing Von Trapping through the Alps, and I’m seeing something more like hot chocolate in front of a fireplace,” Tony said with a slight frown, making Steve let out a low chuckle.
Steve brought his hand up and wrapped it around Tony’s cock, still hard and red against the slight curve of Tony’s belly.  He started stroking, long and slow, then faster, giving the head a twist of his wrist, thumb tracing over the slit, back and forth as he pumped his hips harder and harder.  At some point, Tony released his hand and Steve lifted Tony’s hips again, finding the angle he needed, canting his hips faster in sharp, jabbing thrusts that hit home each time.
Steve heard Tony’s sharp intake of breath, his own chest tightening as if pulled by the sound.  Tony was watching him, eyes sharp, body poised off the doorframe like he was suspended halfway through a motion. They’d been here before, Steve thought, the memory of standing in the living room while Tony looked at him flashing through his mind again, though it felt vastly different this time.  This time, it was him asking Tony, though he wasn’t sure what he was asking for, just that Tony would give it, and that was enough.
“Sorry, got caught up.  Habit,” Daniel said hurriedly and the camera dropped in a rush, showing the floor, with its homey faux wood and lines of cables and wires.  “I’ll edit it later.”
“Sounds fake, but okay," Tony said. The alien tilted his head curiously at Tony, a small smile playing on his lips.  "And I’m really cured?  Completely, I mean. No reactor, no shrapnel, no palladium, nothing?” Tony pressed.
“Good, Steve, so good for me, just beautiful, my darling, so perfect for me.  I like this, you know.  Waking up next to you, taking care of you, watching you come on my mouth or my hand or my fingers,” Tony was murmuring, almost chanting, the way Wanda would chant sometimes, and you could feel it in the way your blood pounded with the words.  “I would see you like this every day, all soft and pliant and happy and know that I made you this way.”
“Sorry, it’s…” Steve started, waving a hand over the space on the dock under their feet.  “Here, I’ll just--I’ll get the blanket, hang on.”
“I don’t think that means what you think it means,” Steve replied, taking one of the bench seats and maneuvering his backpack to his lap so Tony could take the seat next to him.  He pulled the Yoo-hoo out of the bag, unzipped his backpack, and took out a blue lunchbox with S. Rogers written across the top in black sharpie.  It was so wonderfully Steve, that Tony wanted to grab it and clutch it to his chest.  If he opened it up, it would have all of Steve’s lunch items carefully separated into baggies or containers, all probably labeled with S. Rogers.
“Good eve, Your Highness,” Cam said, standing up to bow low and formal, as was his wont, mostly for the thrill of the show, in Steve’s opinion.
“Just checking.  You never know,” Stark said, then huffed out a laugh and wiped it away with his hand as he regarded Steve.  “I looked at your portfolio.  You’re not half bad.  The Avengers Tower one?  Were you in midtown when the attack happened?  Amazing eye for detail, really.  I’d forgotten about the S landing on the hot dog cart, but you can’t say that isn’t art.  That, ah.  That Iron Man one.  That’s good.  Really good, in fact.  The way you depicted him—well.  I liked it. I’m something of a collector, you could say,” he said with a grin.  “You have like a gallery space or something? I might be interested in a couple of the pieces.  I’m not technically supposed to buy art myself.  I mean, it’s my money, but I was told that buying and selling pieces my Eggsec—okay, it does sound like egg sack.  Anyway, Pepper says I have no taste.  No reflection on you,” Stark stopped, holding up a placating hand and finally taking a breath.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, bending down to clap Rhodes on the shoulder. Rhodes nodded, looking askance at him.  “Well fought, General.”
“That’s…ah…Dubhe.  Part of the Big Dipper,” Tony added, looking askance at where Stone’s sleeve brushed the top of his shoulder.  It was fine.  He was just showing Tony what he was trying to ask about.  It was
“I want to,” Tony said.  He did.  Mostly.  There was still a part of his brain, a smaller part now, maybe, but still there, squirming in the back of his mind, that was insisting he should get out of here, go to the sanctuary of his room and close the door, because Steve was wired, that much was clear. That was different and different was a minefield of things that could blow up in Tony’s face, but this minefield had a path, and Steve was on the other side.  Somewhere, somehow, Tony had started to want to get across.
“How do you ask someone to love you?  By loving them, of course. Love is always a question, waiting for answer. That’s the beauty of it. You get to answer it every day,” Jarvis told him with a small, sad smile.  “I see his answer over and over again, all around you.  In how he treats you.  In how he puts your happiness above what the world would give him, if he wanted to take it.  How he looks at you when you give him something in return that says he has brought this happiness to you.  How he listens and notices so much of what you try to hide from everyone.  How he sees you, all of you, and doesn’t ask you to change, but instead, demands the world change for you.”
“Well…I was wondering if, you know, one of these days, you might—maybe—I don’t know, be thinking about something like that.  An arrangement like that,” Tony said.  He dropped his gaze and looked out the window for a moment.  A semi-truck sped past them, its mud flaps sporting a large, silver O that Tony remembered thinking was pretty when he was younger, before he understood the implication.
“Don’t make a big deal about the hand thing.  Or the back.  He’s real sensitive about his limitations, you know?” Barnes said.
He was slick.  He could feel it, wet and slightly sticky against his boxers.  Shame, bright and hot, flared behind his eyes. It was just biology, he told himself.  Practically an automatic response.  Like breathing.  Which…he needed to do.  Breathe.  In and out, don’t—don’t think about it.  Just breathe.  He sucked in a gulp of air, and let it out again, the sick feeling in his stomach expanding as he felt the slick seep down between his legs.  Don’t think. Just breathe.
“Then let them come,” Tony’s voice cut in sharply, a bright line through the darkness that clouded Steve’s mind. “Let them come and try.  He is mine. God or fate or whatever force you feel pressing on the wheel has decreed it. Perhaps I cannot have what I would want.  That is not entirely new to me, you know?  But, I can give him what I have, if he will have it of me.  I am…I am told that those things may be just as good.  If they are truly meant.”
Finally, Tony pulled out of him.  The emptiness was sudden and wrong in some deep, awful way that Steve couldn’t name, but it made his throat tighten until the need to breathe became a struggle.
“Just so I’m clear, you called us all here this morning because you kissed your husband,” Matt asked.
“I can’t even say I wish that I could,” Tony told him, voice breaking a bit as he tried, tried, to explain it, when it was all too much to put in words.  “I don’t.  I’m a selfish bastard, and I want this more than I’ve ever wanted anything.  You…this…it’s pure.  And true. And right, so fucking right, and nothing else in my life has ever been those things, Steve, and I can’t, I just can’t, and so help me God, and if anyone so much as tries to undo this somehow, I will lay waste to them, Steve, don’t think I won’t, so it would really be a service to mankind if you would just, by all that is Holy and good, never, ever speak of options again, because God-damn it, now I’ve called the armor.  JARVIS!  Please override that thing before it knocks down the door and, I don’t know, hugs Steve until he sees reason,” Tony called out, throwing his hands in the air in frustration.
The other changes to the cabin were barely noticeable.  The caretakers kept it tidy and saw to repairs.  A fresh coat of paint on the outside, though the same color.  New shingles on the roof.  One of the deck railings had started to rot and warp, so that was new, though stained to match so well you couldn’t tell which one, unless you knew.
“Okay, so, I shouldn’t have opened my big mouth with the guys,” Brock cut in with a twisted grimace.  “Is that what you want to hear?  I told you, this whole thing has got my head all fucked up, you know,” he threw his hands in the air and let them slap back down atop his thighs.  “I think about you and Stark, and I get all weirded out or something.  Then, the other night, you didn’t want to fuck, and
“Right.  Obie takes the junk specs to Pierce.  Pierce turns it over to the obviously bad guys, and boom!  We’ve got them straight up sharing tech with a terrorist organization.  Steve here and I have a very amicable ‘divorce,’” Tony said, flashing air-quotes with his fingers.  “Simple.”
“And then wait for Hot Roof Guy to come out for some nude sunbathing, then bam! I hit him with my adorable and very enticing engineering prowess,” Tony continued as if Rhodey hadn’t spoken.
!” Howard shouted, pointing stridently at his head, nearly digging his fingers into his temple. “There are no vita rays!  Not anymore! He’s fish food at the bottom of the God-damned ocean, for Christ’s sake,” Howard shouted.  Steve flinched, swallowed, tasted cold and forced himself to breathe, though he took in too much air, stretching his chest until the tightness nearly hurt.
--up here, which doesn’t make sense, alright, but, I get you to myself, no SHIELD, no Nat dropping literally dropping in—still not over the parachute on the roof thing, by the way—but, then, there are all these memories, and I think about how much has changed since we were first here, and--“
He was up in Steve’s face now, crowding him.  Steve could see the bead of sweat on Brock’s temple, the little flecks of spittle on his lip, the way his eyes got sharp and his nostrils flared, spoiling for a fight.
be my Omega,” Rogers said, blue eyes dark and soft with something like sadness.  “Looks like we’re compatible, after all.”
The creature snorted and pursed its lips, raising one eyebrow in such an oddly human look of disdain that Steve was taken aback for a moment.  He grinned and shook his head, clucking his tongue against his teeth. “You’re really going to be judging me for thinking maybe there’s maybe something to those stories, are ya then?  You?” Steve teased. “Go on, go on, give me that look you like to give me when you think I can’t be trusted to put my boots on the right foot. Ah, there it is. That’s the look.”
“Hey, how about all of you shut the fuck up!” Hoskins shouted over the cellblock’s intercom.  “Lights out.  You can thank Stark for your extra beauty rest.”  A general chorus of grumbling ensured, but the lights clicked off a moment later and it died down.  The glow from the guard station and the muted hallway lights illuminated the cell.  It was never truly dark here, the idea of lights out being something of a euphemism in a prison where darkness meant risk.
He kept up the steady pounding of his hips, relishing each long slide into and out of Steve’s body, the way it wrapped around him each time, like it wanted to hold on. Sooner than he would have liked, he felt his rhythm falter, his movements become more erratic, until his hips were snapping shallow, stuttering thrusts. He let go of Steve’s thighs and fell forward, bracing one hand on each side of Steve and pulled out, then rammed all the way in again, coming so hard his vision went black for a moment. He felt Steve rocking his hips against him as he drew out the last of Tony’s orgasm while riding out his own, long streams of fluid decorating the front of the armor and Steve’s chest as Steve came without being touched.
“What’s he even doing here, Steve?  Those damn papers?  What the hell does he want from you now?” Barnes demanded as he shoved past Tony into the room.  “Come to get your pound of flesh, too?”
“There,” Tony said, nodding in the direction of the stairs that led up to the entrance to the High Roller.  A black-suited man waiting at the top spotted them, waved, and headed down the steps to meet them.
“You know how when your foot falls asleep, you don’t really feel it until you start moving it around?” Steve asked.  He took a drink of the beer, and Tony watched him as he tilted his head back and swallowed, seemingly in no hurry for Tony’s answer.  “I’m exhausted.  Today.  Dealing with you.”
A noise from somewhere to his left shook Steve from his reverie, and he turned to see Tony standing in the opening between his bedroom and workshop, wearing a tunic with the sleeves shorn near the shoulders, simple breeches, bare feet and streaks of soot or dust of some kind covering his thighs, stomach and arms.  It was such a contrast to the man who appeared in Steve’s room, dripping in jewels and gold-threaded silks, and yet, Tony seemed somehow more like this, though Steve could not find the understanding of why that would be so.
Tony wretched his shoulder away, surprising Stone enough that Tony felt only the slight sting of a reflexively tightened grip before Stone’s hand dropped from Tony’s back (neck).
“Aye, of course,” Steve nodded, a frown tugging at his face.  “A very good life.  That’s about all we can ask for, isn’t it?”
“You don’t give up, do you?” Steve asked with a sigh.  He drew in a breath and let it out again.  He didn’t know why he was fighting Tony so hard on this.  He could find common ground with the man and deny the existence of the same within the space of a dinner, and he didn’t know why, except that admitting how hard it was to Tony felt like admitting defeat.  It’s not failing to ask for help, Sam’s voice echoed in his head.
“Yeah, not much of a chance of that.  Steve?  Can you open the door?” Tony implored.  He didn’t try the knob, but his hand hovered over it, waiting.  He wasn’t sure he wanted to know if it was locked, though the why of it, the worry that was coursing down his spine and spinning its way through his gut, he didn’t want to put a name to, not yet.  “Steve?  Come on, you’re…I’m kind of freaking out a bit here.  Just…open the door, would you?  Please?”
Tony tossed the keys to Happy and circled around the front of the car to where Steve stood, staring up at the massive stone entrance of the museum.  “I remember coming here to see the Matisse,” Steve remarked quietly.  “The Met was the first to put one on public display, you know?”  Tony could hear the wonder lurking there, the memory of it anyway.  He probably had a Matisse in storage somewhere.  He should give it to—giant bunny, giant bunny, giant bunny, Pepper’s voice sounded in his head.
He just had no idea what to say.  He’d spent so much time on the ‘should I or shouldn’t I’ decision that the after part hadn’t really been considered.  He should have a list.  Make a nice, neat list like he used to do for his art school projects.  Sexual Things I Am Not Ok With by Steve Rogers.  He felt a bit of hysterical laughter threaten to bubble up and just ended up blurting out the first thing that came to his mind.
The drawbridge shook lightly as he tromped across, and he had a moment to notice the chain was rusted over from disuse, yet it was down now. For him.  A welcome. An invitation.  To what, he didn’t know, but the compulsion to find out was all but irresistible.  The drawbridge emptied him into a small bailey.  Off to one side, he finally heard a noise that caught his attention.  Water gurgled out of the mouth of a fountain in the shape of an ancient, bearded troll and into a basin and down a drain.  Probably siphoned from the snowmelt, Steve assumed.  In the center of the bailey stood the large keep, it’s massive  towers jutting up into the mountain itself, as if it was holding up the peak on its shoulders.  Huge, studded doors arched together at the front, one slightly ajar, as if the wind had caught it, though no wind moved and he knew of no wind powerful enough to push open a door that heavy.
“Nothing that fancy,” Steve said with a scraping husk of a laugh.  He brought a hand up and scrubbed it over his face, grimaced, and let it drop to hover over his chest, just above the bandage.  For a moment, his eyes clouded and darkened as lines of pain etched themselves across his forehead.  Pain from the surgery or something else, Tony wasn’t sure. “The Valkyrie, the plane I was on, it was headed for New York.   Went down somewhere in the Arctic ocean.  I don’t know where, exactly.  All the instruments were damaged in the—there was a kind of an explosion, I guess you’d call it.  They found me.  SHIELD. In the ice.  About six months before…before you,” Steve rasped out, raising his eyes to Tony’s.  His voice sounded funny. Shredded somehow.  Like the letters were all separate, falling out of a bag into words.  Probably the effects of an intubation tube at some point.  Probably, Tony told himself without really believing it.
“I’ll do that,” Peggy said on the screen, though there was a note of surprise in her voice, and Steve saw her cast a searching look in the direction of Howard’s voice.
“I wonder if you aren’t, perhaps, unable to see things quite as clearly as you believe you do,” Jarvis suggested mildly, peering down at his hands as if examining his fingernails.
He reared his hand back and brought the paddle down again, harder this time, earning another muffled sound. He pulled the paddle away and held it a moment, letting the man’s muscles tighten up with expectation of the blow before he actually landed one to the right side of his ass. He followed up quickly with another, lighter blow, then a harder one on its heels before the man could catch his breath, enjoying the way the man’s flesh bloomed bright red.
Steve leaned forward and breathed out a huff of air again, feeling Tony shiver even as his skin heated, glowing slick with sweat.  He darted out his tongue, flicking it over the ridged rim, then flattened it out, licking a long, wet stripe from just behind Tony’s balls up and over his hole.  Above him, Tony shouted a broken-off curse, his head falling forward to lull against the glass, cock hard and purpling where it pressed across the mirror.  Steve repeated the motion again, pressing harder against the soft, velvety flesh and continuing the motion until he reached the base of Tony’s spine, mouthing a kiss over the knob of bone there.
“He’s…the doctors are with him. I just wanted you to know.  I’ll keep you updated,” Coulson promised.  In the background, Tony could hear voices, some loud, and a steady beeping that sounded like a machine.
Everything that had been building since he got Steve’s message, building for days, really, ever since Steve left, it all slammed into him at once.  His body went taut, hips jerking wildly, making Steve’s fingers lose their rhythm before Steve got a hand on Tony’s hip, holding him steady as streams of come coated the front of Steve’s uniform.  Red, white and blue-balled no more, Tony thought, somewhat hysterically.  Spots danced in his vision.  Another rush of slick gushed out, wetting Steve’s hand and leaking down the crease of Tony’s ass onto the bed.
“That’s true.  I had no idea I would be getting someone like this when we Bonded,” Steve said back to him, though the way he said it, all soft and husky, like the words were pulled from deep inside, torn and broken a bit on their way out.  “Tony, look at me.  Please?” he asked, thumb tracing a line back and forth over Tony’s cheekbone.
“I know how much you used to enjoy my skill with my lance,” Stone said.  Okay, well, Steve understood
He finally finished, and slowly pulled his cock out. A long, thin line of cum momentarily connected them before it broke and fell away, slapping lightly against the man’s ass. Steve reached out and caught it on his thumb, meaning to wipe it away, but rubbing it into the crease of the man’s ass instead, right over the delicate sheaf of skin over his prostate. He heard a low, stuttering moan from behind the wall and smiled. Yeah, you like that, Steve thought, flushing with deep-seated pleasure.
,” Steve silently responded.  He kept his eyes on the ridge of mountains in front of him.  At night, out here, away from the city lights, it looked a bit to Steve like if you walked up to the top of that farthest mountain, you could reach up and touch one of the low-hanging stars.  Not really, of course. That was impossible. It was one of those other things Steve liked to think about that weren’t real, though.
“Sure.  Um. Yeah, I just—hang on,” Tony spluttered, tossing the yogurt cup into the garbage and heading for the waiting car.
is not a defensive strategy that we should consider pursuing,” Tony said, suppressing a grin with some effort as his eyes flicked over to Steve, “how fares our system of beacons at the outer borders?” Tony asked brightly with a lilt in his voice that was almost a laugh.  Steve ducked his head, the strands of metal swaying from the veil and smiled into the cup he raised to his lips.
Anto had looked down at the Stranger and felt a strange sense of certainty settle over him.  He was a healer. He could not leave this man. No matter what Tyber said. He had been banished before, and survived.  If that was his fate again, then so be it.
“Are you sure?  Kind of sounded like it,” Tony argued, then shrugged and waggled his eyebrows.  Steve rolled his eyes and grinned down at Tony, and then, without thinking, leaned down and kissed him, quick and light.  Next to him, he felt Tony’s body stiffen and he slowed, blinked up at Steve with wide, startled eyes.  Steve looked up and caught their reflection in the doors just before the doors swooshed open.   For all the world, they were the picture of a happy couple, out for a night on the town, too wrapped up in each other to notice the flash of cameras around them that brightened the glass, the pointed fingers, the stares, the way heads turned and eyes widened.
Gingerly, with one hand clutching the towel at his waist and as much dignity as someone wearing only a towel, dog tags and toilet paper could muster, he pulled open the door.
“Let us hope the Chitauri know how terrified they are of us,” Tony muttered, half into the cup of wine he took a swig from, glancing down at Steve.
“Indeed,” Zola agreed.  “I do miss Lord Stone’s patronage, though replacing my inventory so quickly was becoming a challenge.”
. That’s what Pepper had yelled at him as she stormed out.  Yeah, they’d both probably known, or at least suspected. Not that Tony had been exactly subtle.  Giving the company to Pepper, giving Rhodey the War Machine suit, being an absolute dick at his birthday party...yeah, so.  They had probably known.
“You think that was the real guy or just some poor schmuck the government found to do the dog-and-pony circuit?” Tony asked, trying to break whatever tension was slowly squeezing the air out of his lungs.
“Seven years! That’s such bullshit,” Brock spat out.  “It just frustrates me, you know,” he continued, voice softening, “‘cause I wanna take care of my guy, see?  This great guy, who should have all these amazing things and be able to go to school and do whatever he wants.  That’s what getting the company going is all about, Steve. You know that, right?”
Cam nodded as he chewed on an apple, clearly delighted by their change in circumstances. Not that Steve could blame the boy. To say these were far nicer accommodations was something of an understatement.
“So, should I just bend over as soon as we walk in or wait until after we introduce ourselves?” Tony rasped out.  He could feel panic snaking its way up his spine, making him jittery, his heart racing, thumping loudly in his hears until it started to down out everything else.
“Do not try your solution to problem neighbors,” Steve implored with a laugh, tossing Tony a half-smile over his shoulder as he pushed the door to the coffee shop open, making the bell hanging over it jingle merrily above the hum of conversation clanking of cups.
, even if they were far more serviceable than what Steve remembered from the postcards Dernier flashed around during the War.  Pretty Omegas all dolled up in lace and satin, their cheeks rouged and lips painted, eyes drawn dark and sultry with coal.  Even now, standing in front of a wall of soap, Steve could feel his face heating. Not so much because of the images in his head, so much as how they were somehow...adjacent to Tony.  Occupying the same space in Steve’s mind, even if just for a moment.
“Not—not really.  Though, now I’m kind of thinking fruitcake,” Steve answered, brow furrowing into a slight frown as he gestured a hand up and down the flag-themed pajama onesie he was wearing.  Blue with stars on one side, red-striped on the other, with a deep V that opened in the front.  “When you said you wanted to take some holiday pictures, this wasn’t exactly what came to mind.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, of course it isn’t, and you know it,” Tony shot back, then flattened his mouth and ran a hand through his hair, leaving it in tufts.  “Steve...all I’m saying is that sex is a part of life, and one that has been traded in one way or another since time immemorial. For food, protection, security, money, status, whatever the case may be. Your only experience with the harem was a poor one, I’ll grant you, but you’ll find that, while yes, some are sold or captives from war, many people choose to enter the training houses as a way out of a life that offers very little.  And even in the other cases, it might be a more preferable fate that any other. Maybe none of this is ideal to you, but is trading your lot for a soldier’s truly life so much better?”
“But, you got married instead.  Happens,” Tony replied, trying for a laugh, but Steve just looked at him, face tight with tension.
“Okay, JARVIS, there is one part of secure communications line that you are really treating as a bit more of a guideline than a rule here,” Tony yelled to the ceiling as the incoming call from an unknown caller flashed onto the display in front of him.
. The thought flashed, bright and clear, across Steve’s mind.  Tony, dressed not in his usual fine attire, but in the plain wear of a servant, curled up in the cot that passed for a bed in Steve’s quarters, sun-bronzed skin glowing in the light of the small fire that burned in the hearth.  All angles and limbs under watery eyes, face flushed red and stinking of drink.  Don’t send me away.  God, how those words had haunted him over the years. Don’t send me away.
The thing with the radio.  Why did he keep coming back to that?  Because he’d hurt Steve.  That made sense, but…he forced his mind to draw away from its usual need to relieve whatever guiltapolooza was available and think back to what had led to the whole craptastic exchange to begin with. Steve had been pissed. The thing with the comms.  Tony hadn’t followed protocol or…something.  He tried to remember, letting his mind drift back, past the actual radio-gift-debacle.
Nothing about that was an explanation Steve wanted to give, so he kept silent under Fury’s steady gaze.  Something about the way Fury asked the question made Steve bristle, though. The feigned nonchalance of it, maybe, Steve thought.  As if everything since he’d woken up wasn’t some kind of orchestrated maneuver.
Bruce studied him for a long moment, something sad, almost barren passing over his face, and Tony knew the answer before he spoke it. “No,” Bruce replied. “Nothing in what few notes survived,” Bruce said carefully. Tony had known that, of course. He’d spent weeks scouring everything he could get on Project Rebirth. But, if he’d missed something, anything, then Bruce…Bruce would have found it. Tony sucked in a breath, and it went in too cold and too much and he found himself coughing, trying to make his body respond right again, like it had forgotten how to breathe.
He wondered what Tony was doing tonight.  If Tony could hear the sounds way up there in his fancy Tower.  If he was thinking of Steve.  Which, of course, he wasn’t.  Why would he be?
He was quick about it.  Round dots of blood welled up where he cut the knots out, but the skin held together.  When he was done, the man let out a long, shaky breath, then reached down to examine the gashes.
Couple of things that might be of interest only to me:  Rhodey's background in this is loosely (very loosely) based on Robert Smalls, who is quite interesting and was, in fact, one of the first African-American Navy Captains.  The orphan trains that are mentioned in regards to Peter leaving New York were a real thing, as was the idea that you lost your kid if you couldn't pay for their upkeep at a boarding house type situation.  The living conditions mentioned were actually worse in reality.  Pigs in the street in New York City was a legit thing!  Irish kids not being afforded a formal education was also true. The song Steve sings was, in fact, an Army marching song during the Civil War.  I found it in the Congressional archives.  There are a lot of little details like that in here. I found the 19th century history to be pretty interesting for Steve's background.   As for Tony, William Hale was a British inventor working on rocketry around that time, so it seemed like something that could be good for Tony to be involved in.  Underwater mines were stationary, unlike our torpedoes of today (though they were called torpedoes, but for consistency's sake, I didn't  use that term).  Submersibles existed, though were in limited use, but I'm sure Tony would have improved on everything. I can't think of everything, but suffice to say, I do a lot of research for fics, even when they are an excuse to write tentacle porn!
“That’s—no.  No,  you’re having one over on me, Tony,” Steve wheezed out between laughs.  “Tell me that Thor did not really use you as a…as a blunt instrument?”
Drops of red on snow.  His lip stung. It was bleeding.  Footsteps behind him--oh, he had better run!  Iron Man handing him the shield.
“Indulge me,” Tony replied softly, from where he sat perched on the edge of the bed, a shadow in the blue-dark dimness of the room.
Of course, Steve didn't want to hear about his ideas for revolutionizing the world's energy consumption and potable water issues over coffee.
“Of course not,” Stark said, a small, annoyingly-knowing smile playing on his lips.  “Then, as we aren’t likely to see each other again, I wish you both all the happiness you deserve.” It sounded sincere enough, but it rankled Steve for some reason, nonetheless.
By the time they got inside, the crowd was pouring into the hall, where the dance floor was flanked by a small orchestra and long, white-clothed tables laden with an array of food surrounding various patriotic themed ice sculptures that glowed red, white and blue.  Tasteful, Tony snorted, noting the pattern of stars lighting the light wood-paneled floor.
“Tony!” Rhodey shouted as a particularly loud boom echoed through the chamber.  “Get back from the—“
“Good.  Almost done, my love.  A few more, and it will all be over,” Tony promised soothingly.  “Now, spread yourself apart for me. Let me see you,” Tony said.  “There you go,” he urged when Steve finally started to move.
In his fist, the cool, flat surface of the rock was oddly settling. Steve focused on that. There were minute imperfections in the rock that suddenly seemed monumental. The pain in his nipple and ache in his cock seemed to fade as he scraped his thumb back and forth over the rock, feeling the slight pitting in the grain.
Steve knew Tony wasn’t particularly discriminating about his partners, at least before Ms. Potts.  Early on, when Steve was first out of the ice, someone at SHIELD made sure Steve saw the videos, though he had clicked away as soon as he realized what he was seeing.  It had felt intrusive. Tony was Howard’s son, after all, a possible teammate, someone who had already done his fair share to keep the world safe, and—well, Steve hadn’t liked it.  But it had told him enough to know that Tony wasn’t what they called straight these days, not that Tony ever tried to hide anything, really. He seemed to prefer to shove it in people’s faces first, like some kind of preemptive strike.  Steve wondered, now, seeing him like this, if that’s exactly what it had been.
“I know.  It’s okay.  Really, it’s okay.  I’m not asking for the big Hamptons wedding thing,” Tony rushed out, waving a placating hand in the air.  “Well, I mean, I am, but not right now. Right now, I just want to ride to work with you.  Talk a bit.  Get to know you.  You get to know me again.  Maybe we have lunch one day.  Maybe we go sit up on the roof and barbeque this weekend.”
“So…last night,” Steve began, glancing quickly over at Tony before looking down.  “Pepper said that was good.  Not the—well, that, but…I mean, that the, ah.  The photos and all. That it was good.  With the…us. What we…ah.  Did.”
By the time he made it back to the tiny apartment that sat several blocks off Shankill Road, next to a long defunct bowling alley and a once-bright mural that had since given way to the combined efforts of graffiti, playbills, weather and time, his neck and back were still with tension and his stomach kept clenching and roiling while he tried to figure out why, why of all the things Peggy could leave him, why
Steve looked over at Bucky, who grimaced, then shrugged and sat down.  Steve, Tony and Rhodey joined them, though Tony seemed content to pick food off Steve and Rhodey’s plates.
Laughter. That was the first sound he heard.  A loud, boisterous burst of it from off to one side. The camera jerked that direction, and Peggy came into view, sitting in an overstuffed chair with a glass of creamy liquid in her hand.   There was a streak of grey in her hair that hadn’t been there before.  A few more lines. A bit of softness to her frame.  She was smiling, though, and waved at the camera.
“Alright, you two, that’s enough. Mr. Murdock, see that your client provides us with a copy of his marriage license, would you?” Thing One requested smugly.   “I’m sure you have such a precious document commemorating your wedded bliss on hand. Isn’t that right, Mr. Stark?” Tony saw Steve’s eyes go wide in panic and lock on Tony’s immediately. Whoever he was, Tony thought, he was someone used to playing a role, but not outright lying, that much was clear, Tony thought bemusedly.
Tony grabbed his clothes and sauntered off, closing the door behind him with a soft snick as Steve stared at it.  Of course, Tony was leaving.  What else would he do?  It was awkward now.  Wasn’t it?  Tony had probably spent way more time here than he’d planned, with the painting and the…other thing.  What was he going to do?  It wasn’t like he was going to hang out with Steve and chat.  He’d gotten his money, had a good time, or seemed to, and now, the night was over.  Time to move on.  That was one of the things Tony said he liked about this whole gig, right?  No strings attached?
“And JARVIS is working on scrubbing the files from the Internet.  It won’t get everything, but it will hit the big sites,” Tony told him.  “Right, JARVIS?”
.  Goats.  My mother sold me,” Nyma said, matter-of-factly.  “After papa died.  I was the eldest.  We were barely scraping by, and she had my brother and sister to feed.  I worked in a merchant’s house, watching his children, until the merchant’s wife saw how he was looking at me.  She sold me to one of the pleasure houses, and then Zola bought me.   I was scared at first, but it was a good choice, I think. No more going to bed with an empty belly.  Mama was able to keep part of the land and buy a few slaves to work it for her.  She lives with my sister and her family in the city now.  They visit sometimes.  I give my nephews and nieces
“Steve,” Tony sighed, curling closer to him and continuing to weave his hand through Steve’s hair.  “You hail from a vastly different culture. You were captured and abused, and the idea that you suffered so pains me more than I can say.  Then, you found yourself here, your first time sent to serve me with absolutely no training. Can you imagine how worried Zola was that you would do something that would reflect poorly on him?  He was likely attempting to…impress upon you the seriousness of the occasion,” Tony suggested with a small shrug and dip of his brow.  “Zola has ushered the finest concubines in the world into his harem since before I was born.  It is not only where he derives his status and wealth, but it is his pride and reputation on the line, as well.  He has long striven to curry favor with me having, let us say, somewhat less success than he sought. My father always enjoyed a variety of concubines, and I think Zola was a little spoiled with his own influence.  He believes I am disappointed in his choices.  Maybe I was,” Tony shrugged.  “They were…uninteresting.  He did not know what he had with you.  How special you are. The poor man was probably terrified you would displease me somehow and he would be called to answer for why he sent one such as you to me.”
Would he even notice when the check cleared his account?  Probably not.  Probably someone like Tony didn’t exactly keep a carefully annotated checkbook ledger accounting for every penny, the way Steve did.  This money meant nothing to Tony.  None of this meant anything to Tony.  It was Steve who couldn’t seem to--to--
Steve turned, took a step, then realized to his surprise that he hadn’t even asked the man’s name, which was rude, true, but also, a desire to know what it was burned white hot inside his mind for a moment, like a match being struck.  He turned, the question already forming on his lips, then dropped his mouth open in surprise.
“For your lawyers. I've got my ledger. If you need it,” Steve explained, a muscle jumping in his cheek as he stood there, something too tired to be sadness moving across his face. As Tony watched, Steve brought a hand up and ran it over his mouth, eyes clouding before they settled on Tony again, stone-faced and shuttered, something gone that Tony hadn't even known was there until it was missing.
“Hmm,” Coulson replied noncommittally.  “This is us,” he said, as the elevator pinged and came to a stop on their floor.
“So, yeah.  Um.  Catch you later, big guy,” Tony said as he flipped the faceplate back down again to hide his grimace of pain.  Armor really rubbed against a giant erection.  That and the fucking icing problem were obviously the two issues that he had neglected during the initial design phase.  You’d have really thought at least the erection thing would’ve occurred to him.  All things considered.
“You’ll be the first to know,” Coulson promised.  “I’m sure he’s fine, Tony.  They have to go dark for any number of reasons.  There are protocols for this.  It isn’t something to worry about.  Captain Rogers can take care of himself. I promise.”
“Boss said you two were going to tour the site for the new reactor project, so I’m to take you there,” Happy informed him.  Steve just sighed, shaking his head at Tony’s machinations. He thought about the long kiss this morning as he was leaving, Tony reminding him to think of it when he was on his way home.
“The thing?” Tony repeated with a slight frown.  “Oh, you mean the taking down the bad guys thing.  Right.  Um, no.  That is taking a tiny bit longer than expected, but, don’t worry,” Tony said quickly.  “It won’t be long.  Cross my heart, such as it is.  Sorry.  I know this isn’t exactly how you planned to spend your week.”
“Are  you…did you come with someone tonight?” the man asked, his voice sounding somewhat strained, but it could just be trying to hear him over the din of the band playing and hum of conversation.
As soon as his arms were free, Steve’s knees buckled, his whole body screaming with pain as thousands of needles pricked his skin from the inside.  He hit the ground.  Hard.  Panting, he lay there for a moment before the guards untethered the chain that bound his feet from the ring in the floor and hooked their arms under his and heaved him to something resembling a stand.  His wrists were chained behind his back again, this time with a shorter length, pulling at the tendons in his shoulders.  One of the other slaves who materialized from some other part of the building darted forward and wrapped a loincloth around his hips, knotting it in front.  The guards half dragged him toward the door as he shuffled and stumbled forward, nearly tripping over the chain between the shackles on his ankles.
“I—yeah. But, I mean, like I said. No big deal.  It all went away.  No harm, no foul, all that,” Tony replied weakly.
“Ah,” Steve said with a smile that looked somehow relieved.  “I could take it to SHIELD. See if there’s any interest.  If there is, might help grease the wheels at SI.”
Doubt. That's what it was. Sickening and stomach-churning, doubt creeping in at the edges the way fog bleeds across a road so slowly that its always almost a surprise when you really you suddenly can't see where you're going. Nothing was right about this, not him, not Steve, not any of them.
The bed dipped next to him, and Tony leaned over him, tracing a finger down Steve’s cheek.  “So good for me,” Tony said.  Steve blinked, let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding, and then startled a bit as he felt cold metal wrap around his wrists.  A grating snap, and the manacles locked into place.  Above him, Tony fixed the chain through some part of the bed that Steve hadn’t noticed or thought to question, but now made a terrible sort of sense.
As a thread went, it wasn’t much, but Steve was willing to take what hope he could get.  It took two days of hovering in the cold on a nearly empty MIT campus and shoving a photo of Tony’s face from the painting at the few students and faculty still around before someone recognized him.  Tony Stark.  The name rang enough of a bell in Steve’s head that he googled it, which popped up a number of articles, though most were focused not on Tony, but on Howard, Tony’s father, founder of Stark Industries, and currently awaiting trial on various money laundering, tax evasion and RICO violations.  Assets seized, accounts frozen, stock plummeting, contracts canceled, company foundering, divorce.  And Tony?  Barely a footnote mentioning that he was currently a graduate student at MIT.
“That’s—I do. I do, Tony.  At least, I think I do. It’s easier to believe when I’m with you.  Does that make sense?” Steve asked, looking down at his lap.
Steve closed his eyes and drew in a shaky breath, then opened them again and stared up at the canopy above the bed with its vines and birds forever caught in mid-flight.  “If it was possible to lay all of this down for anyone, I would do it for you. Please believe that,” Steve said. Tony sighed deeply, looking up at Steve with recognition of his own words in his eyes.
Steve turned and headed for the door labeled 3C, with its paint peeling and the C slightly off-center, where one of the nails had come out and not been replaced.  He knocked and waited, then knocked again, louder this time.
“What was this, Tony?” Steve demanded, jaw clenching so hard it was a wonder Tony didn’t hear his teeth grinding.  “Was this just some kind of game to you?”
Anto had never mentioned the counting sticks again, though he sometimes thought about them in his head as he gathered the grasses, plants and bark that he needed to keep his medicine bag supplied.  Anto hadn’t told anyone about his cave, either, not until he had to. For the Stranger. Anto had known what would happen if Tyber ever found out that Anto had kept his cave a secret, but he had kept it to himself anyway, at least until now.  It almost felt like he had completed some task without ever realizing he had been in the middle of doing so until he was done.
“Working on it,” Tony argued in a smooth, placating whisper.  “Wow.  Double date with Nat and Barnes….and Rhodey.  Just like old times.”
“Ah, kid’s just excited, Howard, come on,” Stane scoffed easily.  “Lots to see here, right?  Besides, network might like a shot or two of Tony and Maria.  You know, help sell the Expo as a family affair kind of thing.”
“Don’t you fucking sit there and lie to—“ Tony began, anger and frustration and maybe some unwarranted guilt warring for dominance.
“Wow, Pep.  First, of course I did not “give” her that promotion.  She earned it. What kind of feminist are y—okay, okay, ow, don’t throw things!” Tony pleaded, ducking behind a stack of files on Pepper’s desk as she tossed a pad of post-its at his head.
Thank you again for reading!  I expect there will be one more chapter and then an epilogue, if anyone is wondering.  So, basically, not much more before everything works itself out.
“Really, what is one more keep to you?  We are a small holding, and have little of value anyway, as I told you.  The harvests have not been kind to us these past years,” Obie was saying.  Because you demanded too much of a share and made them overwork the land, Tony thought, though he kept his mouth shut.   “Omegas are hard to come by, even here, and even if you have others, you can’t have too many, now can you?”  Obie smirked, like he was sharing some kind of secret with the man.  The man’s face remained unchanged, but he did tilt his head, as if considering Obie’s words.  “He is beautiful, is he not?” Obie asked, sweeping his hand out as making a presentation.  “I would wager you do not see many like him.”
“Few other places that you might be interested in,” Coulson continued without pausing.  “Of course, Happy will take you wherever you want to go.  This, is your bankcard,” he said, handing Tony a bright green card with Steve’s name emblazoned on it.  “And your SHIELD ID, in case you need to come to the base for anything.”  This one had Tony’s full name and social security number with a –O at the end to indicate his status, just above where it said, Rogers, Steven G., Capt.—A(X).
The air punched out of Steve’s chest and a low, keening wail filled his ears that he only realized belatedly was coming from him.
Flashbulbs, not flash grenades, he told himself firmly, though he could feel the way his muscles bunched and heaved, adrenaline spiking through his veins until he could taste the coppery bitterness in the back of his throat.  Count by sevens. He could do this. He had to do this. For Tony.
“Um-hmm,” Tony nodded. “And ones on sharks, dysentery, yellow fever, jellyfish, all water-based or water-powered supervillians, which, good news, surprisingly short list, given how much of the planet is covered in water,” Tony assured him. “And, well, a few other things,” Tony said as he handed Steve the stack of cards. “To be fair, I think Clint put the suggestion about sand fleas in as a joke, but, they can cause skin irritation and—well, it’s all on the card. Anyway, I think we have everything we need, so let’s get on the jet.”
“Well. That’s up to you,” Steve said quickly, giving Tony a look before going back to watching the road pass by outside the limo’s darkened window.  “There will be dancing.  I don’t really dance, but, ah. I could try. If you wanted.”
“She would not be offended. She has taken the name as her own, in fact,” Steve assured him.  “You should have seen the Hydra soldiers scatter when she stepped onto the battlefield dressed all in red as bright as blood.  The Scarlet Witch, they called her,” Steve told him. “It was a sight to behold.”
“He let me talk about my self-insert painting for just over three minutes,” Steve replied.  Tony let out a shocked bark of laughter before burying his face against Steve’s arm to cover his laughter.
Steve stopped, ducking into an alley that smelled vaguely of garbage and urine, and pulled out his phone.  It rang once before Bucky answered.
“It’s fine, Tony, really. We won’t be here too much longer.  I think we can make do,” Steve said, but he was probably just being polite because Steve was very polite.  Most likely, he didn’t want to hurt Fury’s feelings by telling him that his quarters were boring and sterile and unartistic and decidedly lacking in red.
“Eat your donut, please,” Jarvis interrupted.  Tony shot him an apologetic grin and reached for one of the pastries.
Tony was as good as his word, Steve had to admit.  In the privacy of their chambers, he listened to Steve, more than Steve had ever dared to hope.  Treated him as an equal.  Tony was almost zealous in his interest in improving the lot of the Realm’s slaves, making Steve wonder if each new proclamation or charitable gesture was meant as an appeasement as much for Steve as for anyone else wearing a collar, as if Tony sought to use good deeds to grind down his conscious like a millstone.  He will change, Steve told himself.  Already, Tony was different, after all. Even Rhodes said as much.   In time, Steve told himself.  In time, Tony would be able to see.
“Sorry,” Tony murmured to Preston Carrington Taylor Howell III and…Dan.  He was just…really, really tired. “Not good company r’now.”
“I don’t know. I didn’t, not like this. But, this…I mean, God. Just--what if…”Bruce started. “Bear with me here, but…if you were meant to be together, all of this with Steve and the serum and the ice…maybe…maybe the Bond formed, but you weren’t born yet, so there’s no mark to give Steve, and since he doesn’t have one, you can’t, so…I don’t—I mean, it’s
“And you always follow orders, right? Like the time we found Stark’s supposed weapons maker in the middle of exactly where he shouldn’t be and took him right to Pierce. Oh, wait,” Bucky continued over Steve’s words. “You could’ve talked to him.   Sure, he was a stubborn ass about it, but, Steve, you didn’t see him after we thought you were dead. He blamed himself, rightly or not, so he pushed you away, and you? You let him. Went right along with it, until you found something else you could actually fight. Then, when we got back to the Castle, you went off to fight Hydra the first time he didn’t do something exactly right, and you’d have kept on at it until it killed you, except Tony showed up, and he’s the one thing in all of this that’s been able to pull you away from it. This time it’s the Ten Rings. What’s it going to be next time?” Bucky demanded. “Damn it, Steve, it’s gone. Our lives. Our families. Our friends. They’re gone. It’s all gone! But we’re not, and that isn’t fucking fair, but we’ve got to stop punishing ourselves for living. It’s got to mean something. You’ve got to let it mean something!”
“I’m—I do.  I have an Alpha. Steve Rogers. Captain Rogers.  He’s—he’s right inside.  Probably—probably looking for me,” Tony stammered.  “I should go.”  He shifted around Stone, who didn’t budge, and took a step towards the door before he felt the weight of an arm across his shoulders, turning him back towards the balcony railing.
Thank you to everyone who has been so supportive of this story.  I really appreciate it.  Hope you enjoy this chapter.
“That’ll be Steve,” Tony announced, too loudly.  He was sure Jarvis could hear the way his voice tremored.  With a quick, ruefully apologetic look at Jarvis, Tony walked over and bent down enough to check his reflection in the car’s side-mirror, pushing his hair down as best he could.
“Its JARVIS,” the voice corrected.  “If you like, I will take the liberty of running Mr. Stark’s usual settings.”
He wasn’t going to Bond, though.  Obviously.  The last thing he needed was an Omega, and the last thing any Omega would want was someone like him.  The whole idea was crazy.
Tony pocketed the phone. He tapped a finger at his lip, worrying the edge with his teeth, as he watched Steve move around the suite while Barnes sat on the couch watching what appeared to be a telenovela.  Checking his email and reading through a few of the more salacious takes on his and Steve’s evening of wedded bliss passed the time until he realized Shaggy, Daphne and Fred were probably waiting downstairs for him. Pushing himself up, Tony walked to the French doors that led inside, hesitated a moment, watching the two of them as a smile spread over Steve’s face at something Barnes had said, then went inside.
“Of course!” Allen replied.  Steve thought he seemed relieved. “I’ll just wait out in the car.  You take your time.”
As always, thank you so much for reading, commenting and supporting this story and 'verse.  You are all so wonderful.  I'm really thrilled so many people seemed to have enjoyed this fic.
“Uh, so, anyway.  Glad you found me.  I was looking for you, actually, and stumbled out here into Mr. Stark’s attempt at privacy, I think,” Steve interrupted, turning to Brock, who had a dazed sort of frown on his face.  “Sorry, again,” Steve added, shooting an apologetic look back at Stark.
Tony closed his eyes.  His throat bobbed once.  When he opened them, they held something Steve couldn’t look at or he thought it would doom them both.  Tony moved forward on his knees and positioned himself between Steve’s legs, taking his cock in hand and guiding it towards Steve.
“Is it okay? Ms. Potts sent up a tuxedo, too, just in case,” Steve told him.  “I could change, if you think—"
“I knew that was going to come up,” Steve sighed in exasperated acceptance, while Tony snorted out a huff of laughter against his chest, sending prickles of gooseflesh up and down his arms.
“Yeah, I know about the stock.  Thing is, you knew about the stock hit last night. There was a graph.  None of that was new information.  But, you meet with Stane, and suddenly, there’s no way this project can work?  What’d he say to you?” Steve asked.  If he didn’t know Steve, Tony would have thought Steve was just mildly curious, but he did know Steve, and this was Steve’s dog-with-a-bone tone, and either he had to cut it off now or there was no getting it out of Steve’s teeth, the damn, stubborn man.
“My life,” Steve announced with a self-deprecating shrug. “I should just re-up and be done with it, but I told myself I’d give it six months. I did get some space at one of those Soho galleries, so it’s a start, I guess.  i share it with a couple of other artists on a rotating basis.  Maybe I’ll sell a piece or two,” he shrugged noncommittally, but there was an intense look he got when he talked about his artwork, and Tony could tell the effort to appear not to care too much was entirely calculated. He wants this to work, probably for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that he doesn’t want to go back to what he had been because he couldn’t succeed at who he wants to be, and wasn’t that just the damnedest thing?
“There was a…miscommunication with the agency.  Don’t worry, I took care of it,” Tony replied hurriedly.  “My fault.  It won’t happen again. I know it’s late, and if you want me to send Happy, I will, but weren’t you supposed to spend time with your mom today?” Tony asked softly.
Steve took a moment to allow his eyes to roam over Tony as well, his stomach dropping at what he saw. Tony was dressed casually by his standards, a smudge of something dark on his neck, as if he had reached up to scratch there, hair curling and damp, sure signs that he had been in his workshop when he received word that Steve was returning. There were dark circles framing Tony’s eyes, and his skin was too tight on his bones, like he had been when Steve and the Avengers first found him, a toll that Steve’s absence had exacted, a cost he had failed to consider, but now seemed far too high.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m definitely still picturing him in an orange jumpsuit eating the Thursday Special from a metal tray, but surprisingly
“I missed you,” Steve repeated, harder, more insistently than before, stepping forward as he did, pushing Tony back the few paces so he was pressed against the office wall, one of those inspirational posters quoting some pithy phrase about leadership while an eagle soared over mountains framed next to his head.  A gift from Tony, Steve recalled, then wondered that he’d kept it, let alone moved it to the new facility, except that there really wasn’t anything to wonder about.
“Bullshit,” Tony snorted.  “Because I kissed you? Newsflash, we call that selfish and manipulative, two vital pieces of the Tony Stark oeuvre, trust me. Don’t you need to go? Smart to—to duck out while you can.”
Tony woke to a panicked, disoriented startle, finding himself in his own bed, the room pitch dark, save for the glow of the numbers on his clock, which told him it was a little after two in the morning.  He was still in his suit.  His shoes were gone, though, and the covers were thrown over his legs.
When Anto looked up, Steve was watching him with his mouth slightly open, his jaw slack, his eyes wide and bright.   He said something that Anto didn’t understand, then, to Anto’s complete shock, knelt down in front of him and took Anto’s hand that was clutching the bone-lion into his own.
Tony looked down at where his hands curled in his lap, then sat forward and tipped his chin down, meeting Barnes’ calculating look with one of his own.
Tony let out a sharp hiss at the movement, only to have the expression replaced with wide-eyed horror as he stared up at Steve.
“You said you won’t break our Bond,” Tony said carefully, drawing Steve’s surprised gaze to his face.
Steve watched the man leave.  When he opened the door, Rumlow stepped into Steve’s line of vision, as if he knew.  Maybe he did. Steve thought he might never have hated anyone more in that moment.   Rumlow clapped his hands together, twice, and guards came in from one of the back rooms.
“Oh God, that’s amazing!”  Cam blurted out, grinning.  His smile faltered as quickly as it had appeared.  “I’m going to mess up. Break something. Get sent to the mines.  They make you wear birds on your head, you know.”
“Tony?  Shut up,” Steve said.  He smiled and shook his head, giving Tony an exasperated, but not unaffectionate look.  “I love you. And you were just almost
“Okay,” Stark began, turning to look at Steve with a slight wince. “I’m going to pretend you didn’t just use the term ‘Pollyanna’.  No, wait, it’s kind of on brand and...weirdly adorable.  Anyway, point being, Steve says I can’t just buy anything and everything, some things are beyond money. I say, it’s just about finding the right price, like that old joke, whether you believe Churchill actually said it or not.” Stark’s eyes flicked over to Steve. “Ultimately, everyone’s for sale.”
“I have never seen a real tourney before,” Cam announced.  “What events will they have? What will you award the winner?  Do you think someone will die?”
He closed his eyes and thought of… well, things he had no business thinking of, if he was honest with himself, he thought with a grimace, but his cock didn’t care. He was getting hard again. He thrust shallowly a few times, and yeah, that was the ticket. This time didn’t last long, either, but it was nice and easy, and he liked the feel of his cock swimming in his own cum inside the man’s body, squelching obscenely as he thrust. The tight channel clenched hard around him, milking him, and God, yeah, that felt amazing.
The alien wasn’t wearing anything that Tony could see, anyway.  It occurred to Tony that maybe the alien didn’t wear clothes, maybe that was why Tony’s spacesuit was gone.  Perhaps it hadn’t known what clothes were for? It (he?) was looking down at Tony with an intense look that almost seemed...concerned?  Worried? Confused? Hard to say, exactly, though the alien’s face seemed expressive in the way that most human faces were. At least from what Tony could tell over the all-consuming panic.
No shit, Neil, Tony thought, snapping the faceplate down and stepping out onto the gravel driveway as the HUD activated in front of him. Steve turned as Tony approached, the HUD zooming in on his expression.  Eyes bright, soft, crinkled at the edges, the way Tony liked.  A smile tugging at his lips.  Hands at his waist, head tilted back.  Captain America pose, Tony thought with a surge of pride.  He activated the repulsors and went airborne, just high enough to soar above Steve for a moment before dropping back down to the deck with a practiced thud.
Maybe his sudden awareness was because Steve had clearly gone to some trouble.  He was wearing slate gray slacks that fit him like he’d made a deal with the Devil, and a dark indigo shirt and matching tie that made his eyes seem an impossible shade of blue.
Tony sucked hard, drawing the dark pink skin up into his mouth and letting his tongue swirl in circles around the areola before releasing it.  Steve was making gasping, needy little groans that were going straight to Tony’s cock.  He took in a deep breath, then slowly let the air out of his lungs, and reached down to pinch the head of his own cock, because, unlike Steve, he really had one shot at this and if Steve kept looking and sounding like that, it was going to turn into a somewhat less eventful evening than he had in mind.
Three large, black cases sat in the middle of the garage, locked with a biometric mechanism of his own design.  He walked over and nudged at one of the cases with his toe.  Why had he even brought the armor? The garage wasn’t equipped to work on something as sophisticated as the armor.  It was all but done, anyway.  Admittedly, the last test had not quite as expected, though U had taken an unholy amount of delight in finally getting to use the extinguisher.  Still.  It was ready.
Tony’s mind decided to spend the rest of the drive replaying each of the day’s fuck-ups, just in case he needed extra incentive to be on his best behavior.
Cam looked at him for a long time, as if he was considering Steve’s words, then nodded and looked squarely at Steve.
“Say my name,” the King ordered, looking down at Steve with a strangely fierce expression.  “I want to hear my name on your lips when I take you.”
He wasn’t sure if it was the disappointment or the embarrassment that hurt the most.  Maybe it was just too hard to bother trying to separate the two now.
It was like being punched in the gut when the realization hit.  The world slanted, grew hazy, voices dulling to a distant echo, and there was a darkness creeping into the edges of his vision.   He tried to suck in a breath, but it was like his body had forgotten the process for doing so.  How could he breathe when Steve wasn’t?  When Steve wasn’t breathing?
“You still have to talk to Steve.  This—this thing you’re doing—you know I have your back, right, but this isn’t actual communication,” Rhodey pointed out.  “You can’t just run up and push Steve over on the playground and hope that he understands that means you like him.”
Except that he wanted nothing more right now than to shove one of those $10,000 chips in Steve’s hand, get on his knees and show Steve exactly what a mouth could do.  It wasn’t exactly news that he wanted Steve.  Hell, he’d spent the night after his and Rhodey’s foray into Vegas sightseeing of the decidedly less family-friendly kind jerking off to thoughts of the guy, but now he wanted
“You’re really bonded? Wow, that’s…I mean, that’s great, obviously.  I just never thought…but, wow.  Just wow, Tony.  I’m…happy for you.  Both of you.  We’ll have a proper ceremony and everything once you’re home,” Pepper said, sounding genuinely pleased.  Pepper was really very smart and thoughtful.  He didn’t give her the credit she deserved.  Brilliant, perceptive, wonderful Pepper.
“It doesn’t seem very different,” Clint grumbled, but he put down the plate of pancakes, so Tony decided to let that go and reached over to slide the plate of toast closer to Steve, just in case.  “Except he’s trying to feed him instead of fu—“
“Who’s panicking?  I’m not panicking.  This is me, definitely not panicking.  Just pointing out that our team leader is making snot bubbles at the moment, but, nope, not panicking,” Tony replied. Stoically, he thought.   Definitely, almost stoically.  Very close.  Four out of five Avengers would go with stoically.
“For you,” Tony replied and let his eyes fall shut for a moment.  Another breath. His hand curled tighter around the tags.  He wanted Steve to touch him.  He wanted Steve to keep looking at him like this.  He didn’t know what he wanted.
He couldn’t even say what he had expected to find in Steve’s room.  Answers.  Insight.  Some kind of a clue.  Something. Or, so he’d told himself when he walked past it after his shower and realized that he had never actually been inside Steve’s room. At which point, Steve’s room became the mental equivalent of a big, red button under a Do Not Touch sign.
He was big. Tony knew that from when he had cared for Steve’s injured leg, though he had tried not to look. That would have been impolite. Still, he’d had to help Steve make his water at first, and so he knew Steve was big.  Bigger than Tyber. But, Tony was so empty, like a wide, open vessel, and there was this deep, unceasing ache inside him. Whatever fear he had was gone, faded to dust and left behind, along with everything else. He was Tony now, and Tony loved Steve, and Steve shared Pleasures with Tony, and it was good.  Tony knew it would be good.
“He ordered me to go, you know that. He’s the King, I couldn’t just ignore him,“ Steve ground out, feeling a flash of anger surge through him, tensing his muscles and pounding through his chest, though he wasn’t sure if it was because of the memory or because he knew Bucky was right, and he hated himself more than a little for how he had reacted then, when he didn’t believe in himself enough to believe that Tony could.
“Do you need the records?” Steve asked gruffly, shooting Tony an annoyed—no, scratch that, pissed--look. “Or, do you want to just repeat it some more? I know the concept of paying things off over time is probably a bit new for you, so take all the time you need. Please. I'm really starting to enjoy our little conversations.”
The address turned out to be another nondescript industrial building sided by corrugated metal and concrete that was about as close to the outskirts of the city as you could get and still claim a New York City zip code. Steve tapped the code into the security panel next to the door, which unlocked as soon as he hit the last number. Instead of a hallway this time, the interior of the building was wide open, with tracks of lights hanging overhead, flickering listlessly.
Christmas, and I think he’s been pretty good. Bit of fairly amazing and slightly illegal, definitely won’t be doing it again, computer business aside, of course.  Here,” Stane said, holding it out again.  Tony looked at it for a moment, then over at Howard, who pulled a face and rolled his eyes a bit, but nodded.
“Why?” Tony blurted out.  “Why…me? I’m…I’m no one. I’m--” he trailed off, dropping his gaze to the floor and feeling it pulled like a magnet to the shield.  “You’re Captain America.  I had your action figure and your…bubble bath, for Christ’s sake.  And I’m…I’m just
“That the King calls for you nearly every night.  That you spend many of your days in his chambers.  That he favors you with extravagant gifts,” Kadina listed off with a trilling sort of songlike quality to her voice.  She paused and regarded him, one delicate eyebrow rising to a perfect arch.  “That he does not know you spent an evening with Lord Hammer.”
Steve was watching him, considering, like he was one of those drawings that could be two things at once and Steve was trying to puzzle out if he was the old crone or the young lady.  Something seemed to click into place for him, though Tony didn’t know what or even how he knew, except Steve’s eyes gleamed and his posture relaxed.
“Your scintillating company, of course,” Tony replied.  “Nothing about that, by the way,” Tony said, nodding at the flowers in Bruce’s outstretched hand, “suggests that I am in any way incorrect in my characterization of this outing.  Not that I am complaining, mind you. Steve enjoys the fresh air and is under the mistaken impression that it is good for me, as well. Plus, if I had to listen to Ellis drone on about his horses again, I might entertain the idea of a public execution.  Of Ellis or myself, doesn’t matter. I’ve already lost poor Cam to the madness. Can’t get him out of the stables, though he is too afraid to ride. I’ll have to have Happy find him a gentle mare when we get back, get him some lessons. Anyway, Bruce, since your interest is in healing properties, you should study Steve. I told you about his, ah, special abilities, shall we say, and you had little in the way of useful information for me.”
Steve staggered backwards, the sound that tore from his lips echoing into the gaping chasm below.  His shoulders dug into the craggy rocks of the mountainside at his back as his feet scrambled for purchase on the gravelly path, and he grabbed wildly for anything to hold onto, coming away with only the scrape of rock under his nails.  Stilling himself, he looked around him in horrified confusion. Where was he?  What was happening?  How had he gotten to this place?
“That’s not what I—that’s not what this is. I told you. I couldn’t let them—they hurt him, Bucky! You really think I’m going to just—“ Steve heard himself shouting and tried to force his breathing to calm against the flow of words, lest they carry outside the tent. “We had a mission here. It was the right thing to do. I said we were going back, what more do you—“
“Oh, no, don’t pull me into this...whatever it is,” Bruce protested, holding his hands up in front of him.  “I’m just here to stock my medicine cabinet, Tony, not argue the innate nature of mankind with you. Steve, for what it’s worth, Tony’s not nearly as cynical as he likes people to think he is, okay?  He has a soft heart under all that prickly exterior, and he only argues with people he likes and thinks might be,
“And if things were different--in this perfect world of yours where things are different--would we have this?” Tony asked quietly, a strangely dispassionate tone in his voice.
The cabin actually wasn’t as terrible as he’d first thought, and there were, in fact, plenty of supplies, courtesy of Coulson.  Someone had furnished it, probably Coulson again by the utilitarian nature of the choices, Tony guessed.  Still, it was functional, and…empty.  There was that.
“Tweety has a girl?  Good on him,” Tony replied.  “Still, he was supposed to…” Tony continued, waving in the direction of where Steve stood, nodding along with whatever it was the tanned piece of jerky in a muumuu was trying to tell him.
Tony got up with a tired sigh and walked the short distance down the hall.  “You know,” he said quietly,  “I used to have all kinds of fantasies about that beautiful man back there.  Now?  Now, I just imagine sleeping.  Seriously, it’s all I think about.  And do you know why?” he asked, bending down.  “You.  It’s totally your fault.  You’re pretty selfish that way, you know.”  Peter stared up at him with round, wide-awake eyes.  “If you don’t sleep, we don’t sleep.  And if you’re not careful, your Dad, who is trying very hard to finish your mural, is going to end up painting something closer to
“I did not want this life,” Steve began, voice cracking a bit on the last.  He dropped his eyes for a moment, then raised his gaze back to Tony’s face.  A plea, maybe.  He wasn’t sure.
“Not even you can change the way the world works, just to make things easier on your Omega,” Fury said in a tired-sounding voice.
“Alright, ante up, everyone,” Natasha said, tossing a few chips into the center of the table.  Everyone placed their bets, then Natasha immediately raised, of course.  Her face card was a six of diamonds, and he had the seven, so she was probably bluffing, but it was impossible to tell.
It wasn’t as if someone like Tony Stark would understand anything about him or his relationship.  The man was a billionaire hundreds of times over.  One of the most famous people in the world.  He had a different supermodel on his arm--and other places, if the pictures that circulated were any indication--nearly every night.  He had houses, cars, planes, that big, ugly tower in downtown Manhattan--heck, the man had his own island.  He had everything he could possibly want.  Sure, there was that whole kidnapping plot in Afghanistan, but Stark had been found and come out of it hailed a hero, with his face plastered all over every news report around the globe.
“Behind you!” Steve shouted, and Tony turned to repulsor another bot, but an explosive arrow got there first.
“Tony, what…tell me,” Steve implored. He reached out and tugged at Tony’s arm until he felt Tony’s body go slack and fall back onto the bed next to him.
an evil.  That should never be forgotten,” Tony said, voice going quiet.  “Not all men wish to wield power for their own sake’s, though, you know.  It is a…terrible privilege to have that kind of responsibility for the lives of others.”
“Tony, did I do something wrong, or say something, because you seem—“ Steve tried, a frown tugging at the corners of his mouth.
Obie was in there, too, at his father’s side like always, pushing for every inch they could get out of the deal.  That was what Obie was good at.  Closing the deal, the particulars, the details.  Dotting the I’s and crossing the T’s.  Or, more specifically, making sure the company, God forbid, didn’t get screwed in whatever deal it was Tony’s father hatched. Howard had come home from one of his business trips practically frothing at the mouth over this guy, and Obie probably worried he’d sign over half the company to get an Alpha like that to take Tony.
“The righteous indignation act is a tad overblown,” Tony pointed out, deliberately turning his back on Barnes as he reached for the door.  “You can save it for the courtroom, if that’s the way you want to go, but you aren’t getting a God-damned cent out of me.  You think your life sucks now?  Try me,” he tossed over his shoulder.  “You have no idea what I’m capable of.”
Tony heard a low, rumbling noise and realized it was coming from him. He placed a hand lightly, but firmly on Steve’s hip where it rutted against him, and Steve immediately stilled, looking up at Tony once more, briefly, before dropping his eyes again, but it was enough. This, Tony thought. This is what the other thing is, why he felt so centered this morning, so sure. The way Steve looked at him---he couldn’t put it into words what it was, not exactly. Trust and love and devotion and all those things, but like they had been strained and distilled to their purest form where nothing else could touch them.
“Put them in the van.  I’ll deal with them later,” Steve announced sternly.  That sounded properly menacing, Tony thought, though he was probably one of the few people on Earth who knew Steve well enough to differentiate between the annoyed kind of fear and anger that laced his voice now and the deep, frightening wash of rage that came from something very different.  Tony had heard that voice once.  In a cave, with his heart clutched to his chest. He shivered at the memory.
“You locked Pepper out? She’s worried, Tones,” Rhodey groused. “What happens when Pepper worries about you?”
Tony looked back down at the broken lance laying in the dirt. Steve couldn’t quite tell if he was angry or something else.  Steve had, admittedly, overstepped. He knew that. The thought that Tony might punish him washed over him, tying his stomach in knots and sending a pulse of need down his cock, pooling heat and pressure there with a steady drumbeat.  Finally, Tony looked back up at Steve, then just nodded and walked slowly off the dais and back into the castle. Steve had no choice but to follow. The guards and Cam trailed behind, though as soon as they reached the chamber Tony was using, he waved them off.
, the children would sing-song before falling into peals of laughter.  Steve shivered, his eyes going to the mountains, where nothing moved tonight except the clouds.
“None taken. You don’t have a record, though,” Murdock said with the certainty of someone who had checked.
“Flatheads? You mean those--ah,” Tor broke off, looking between Steve and Nasha in confusion before understanding dawned. “I did not know they knew healing.” His face softened as he looked at Tony. “We must thank you for saving our Steven, then, Omega Tony. Our healer, Brus, will be excited to meet one with such skill.”
“Right,” Steve agreed.  “This never happened.”  Steve started for the open door, stopped halfway there and looked over at Tony, a questioning expression on his face that was gone before it ever really settled there.  “Thanks, Tony.  For—for whatever this was.  You took care of me, and I honestly do appreciate that.  So, thank you.  Sorry about the, uh, peeing thing.”
“I know what you mean,” Tony interrupted, holding up a hand.  “You are special to me, Steve.  I would have it…known.  That you are—that you—” he stopped and looked down and away, wiping a hand over his mouth.  “There are many things I would have where you are concerned,” he said after a pause, dragging his eyes up to Steve, his gaze raking up and down over Steve’s face, as if searching for something.  “Some things…some things not even I can bring to pass, but…” he huffed out a frustrated sounding sigh.  “There could be a—a close approximation, if you will. It is good for the people to see you.  To know you, to see your kindness, how much you care.  I saw what you did, with the foodstuffs.  It was good.
Liquid, pain-filled blue eyes turned to look at Tony from over a clear plastic oxygen mask that covered Steve’s nose and mouth.  Steve’s hand reached out, fingers grasping at the air next to the operating table.
“I do try,” Tony said after a long pause in which Steve thought he had fallen asleep.  “It’s just never enough.  Or not the right kind of enough.”
“Hard to imagine.  Corporal, this is my Omega, Tony Stark. Tony, this is Corporal Ellers,” Steve told him, turning to nod at Tony.
It was a heady thought. In here, he couldn’t do anything wrong. He couldn’t fail. He couldn’t screw up. This was here for him to do with it whatever he wanted, and that—fuck, that was
“That’s probably good advice,” Steve said. “About taking it slow.  Keeping it with just SHIELD.”  Tony’s head snapped to look at Steve in surprise, a pang of shocked hurt drumming through his chest with a familiar beat.
“We need to talk,” Tony managed to get out. “Please,” he finished, when he couldn't help it, in what he hoped was a conciliatory tone, a gesture, rather than outright begging.
“You can’t just do this, Tony.  We were done.  Over,” Steve insisted, and okay, yeah, that hurt, Tony admitted, trying to find enough saliva to wet his suddenly dry throat.
That was the thing that was off, Tony realized with a start, watching as Howard looked at Steve with a searching, numb expression.  For the first time in God only knew how long, Tony wasn’t the one struggling to figure out what the right thing to say, the right expression to hold, the right way deal with events that were out of his control.
They retired to their respective chambers to change.  Steve took some time to wash where he could using the basin and perfumed water that filled it.  Cam delivered the box with the Ridge’s gift for Steve, along with the robes he was to wear for the tourney, deep, wine-colored silks with gold embroidery fanning out from the waist.  He refused Cam’s offer of assistance to dress, and instead, held the gold-chained shirt up in front of himself, trying to get a feel for how it looked in the chamber’s small looking glass.  With a slight roll of his eyes, he put it on, feeling the cold chains glide over his skin. It hung down the front of his chest, just below his collar, all the way to his upper thighs, just low enough so that he would feel the chains rub against every sensitive spot as he walked or moved.
“Wait, no.  Don’t you do that, Steve.   I’m not settling for anything!  You really think that?  Don’t answer,” Tony cut in quickly, when Steve opened his mouth.  “Truth is, I always thought you were the one getting the short end of the stick.  I got this amazing guy, who was smart and funny and kind and everyone liked him, and I somehow convinced him I was good for him.  Like, no one tell him!  For God’s sake, don’t pull back the curtain,” Tony said with a grimace, slashing his hand through the air in front of him.  “I kept thinking you’d figure it out, and then, it seemed like you did, and I just…I guess I accepted it.  I’d been waiting for it, after all.  The shoe finally dropped.”
“So… let me just see if I have this--and don’t get me wrong, I’m thrilled you are finally seeing the light, but--someone literally fucked some sense into you?” Bucky asked, pulling a frown and blinking at Steve while his frown slowly spread into a delighted grin.
Sometime later, after Tony fixed Clint’s bow, he was just finishing his lunch when Steve came over and reached for him, tugging him up to a stand and all but dragging him along behind him, talking animatedly, though Tony only caught a couple of now-familiar words.  “What are you–where are we going?” Tony asked when he realized they were actually walking away from the tent they shared.
Probably sending him off for reinforcements in case things went south, Steve figured.  There were other people at the fringes of his sightline now, drawn by the commotion.  People who had been in the showers or just coming in to change. They weren’t intervening, not yet.  This was Strike Team business, or so they probably assumed.  They weren’t going to get in the middle of it, anyway.
“No kidding, you had a good time.  I’m going to sound like a two-pack-a-day smoking grandma for a few days.  Worth it, don’t worry,” Tony said with a tilt of his head and a rough-sounding laugh that wasn’t really a laugh.  He looked at Steve, grimaced and swiped his hand over his mouth, glancing away for a long moment.  “Sorry.  Sorry, I told you, I’m a dick sometimes.  Forget it.  Good times and orgasms had all around.  No worries, okay?  You’re a…you’re a good guy.  I told you,” Tony said, voice going soft and almost sad.  “Five stars.”
Tony gave Steve a hard, inquiring stare.  Steve nodded, and dropped his eyes back down to the railing.  He could still feel Tony’s hand on his back, rubbing lightly now.  His breathing calmed and steadied. His heartbeat returned to something akin to normal.  It had all happened so fast, and now, it seemed to pass just as quickly.
He dressed carefully for the night, black slacks and the deep blue shirt that he knew Tony liked.  Walking out to the living room, he found Bucky sitting on the sofa eating a slice of cold pizza and holding a bottle of beer.  He felt Bucky’s disapproval wash over him.
“He’s still kind of ticked about the press conference,” Tony explained with a grimace.  “I should’ve told him.  Before I did that, I mean.  Not like I don’t get where he’s coming from.  He’s SI’s Air Force liaison.  Kind of a big deal if we cut off production in the middle of contracts, not to mention what’s in the pipeline.  He says the lawyers already called him, told him not to talk to me.”
“You like that all I can think about is you,” Tony accused with nothing short of delight. He rubbed his thumb over the small mark at the curve of Steve’s neck, feeling the indentations his teeth had left in Steve’s skin that morning. It was…pleasing. He wasn’t sure why, exactly, but it seemed to take some of the jittery energy away, just to feel it, to know that Steve was his, that everyone knew that, and here was the proof, because only Tony got to do that, to claim him, mark him as his.
Tony stared across the table at Steve for a moment, the slice of pizza dangling from one hand.  It was sort of sweet, in a Smokey the Bear kind of way, the idea that Tony had been sitting in the garage explaining why we don’t play with fire to his robots.  Completely inaccurate, but, well, yeah.
“Tony, it’s fine.  Really.  It’s fine,” Steve cut in.  He reached a hand across the table and, before Tony could react, just gripped Tony’s wrist for a flash of a moment, his thumb tracing over the jumping pulse-point on the underside before he let go and slid both his hands back under the table.  Tony stared across the table at Steve for a beat.
“You want me to take care of you first?” Tony offered.  Steve just shook his head again and bit his lip, and fuck it all if that wasn’t just the hottest thing Tony had ever seen.
“Jarvis, if this happens again.  Ever.  If this ever happens again.  So much as one more time,” Peggy began, the words seeming to grind their way out of her mouth.  “You will call me immediately.  We will deal with Ana’s care, I promise.  Maria.  Obadiah.  You should understand very clearly that your future comfort, this life to which you are so very accustomed, depends quite greatly on Howard’s future choices where Tony is concerned.  I expect you will act accordingly.”
“He’s going to be staying at the cabin,” Rogers told Coulson.   “I’ve got a few things up there already, but haven’t really moved in.  He’ll need his things from his parents’ house, too.  And…carbon fiber reinforced polymer?” Rogers recalled, looking to Tony who gave him a jerky, little nod to cover his shock that Rogers had actually followed through and not just made a show of it.  “Probably some other things.  Let me know what I need to sign off on.”
.  Tony…look, God, I’m not saying what I--I’m not expecting you to feel…I don’t mean to put pressure on you, Tony.  I wouldn’t do that.  I told you that I wouldn’t, and I meant it.  I don’t mind waiting.  You’re worth waiting for, Tony.  You’re worth…all of this. That’s what I’m trying to tell you.  Look at me,” Steve urged, tugging lightly on the tags.  Tony
“God, you’re gorgeous.  Look at you,” Tony said before claiming Steve’s mouth again, gentler this time, as if seeking some kind of balance with what his hands were doing to Steve’s chest.
They finally broke apart, Steve with his head still swimming from the incredible kiss.  “Tony,” he began, burying his face against the curve of Tony’s neck.  “I want…”
“Huh?  Oh, yeah, sure,” Tony said, taking the ring and slowly sliding it onto Steve’s finger.  He squeezed the sides, and the capsule closed on the tiny bot.
Don’t waste it. Don’t waste your life, Tony reminded himself.  I’m trying, he thought, but God, does it always have to hurt so much? He lifted his eyes to Steve, trying to convey something of how sorry he was, how much he regretted everything that had happened, but Steve wasn’t even looking at him.  His eyes were darting around the room, looking at anything that wasn’t Tony. His jaw was working, like he was grinding down on whatever he wanted to say, gnashing the words between his teeth.
“What kind of place?” Steve asked, reaching out to take the proffered card. It was black, with raised black letters on it, making it almost unreadable unless you were looking right at it. There wasn’t a name, just a number.
Tony felt like his body was on fire, burning from the inside out.  He was liquid, boneless, heat and pressure coiling low in his belly.  His cock was hard against his thigh, twitching for contact, his hips juddering against Steve’s leg.
“You are most decidedly late, but I think you can be forgiven that oversight this once,” Peggy smiled softly up at him.  “Come now, let’s go make our entrance. You always did like that part.” Steve returned her smile, then twisted his head, scowling at the man who was approaching them as they reached the front doors.
“They’ll try to bait you. Don’t let them,” Pepper warned.  “Stick to your cards. Let Tony do the rest.”
“It is truly extraordinary, my Lord.  I thank you,” Tony replied, hefting the scepter in his hands and testing the weight before settling it back in the box.
When he first saw Tony’s file, he’d imagined Tony growing up being somewhat spoiled by doting parents, every whim catered to, every interest indulged, as it should be for someone like Tony, but he supposed there were different kinds of prisons, weren’t there? He looked around the cabin, eyes falling on the clock on the mantle where it kept a steady beat under the noise of the movie.  While he was being honest, he wouldn’t have imagined an Omega being interested in the things Tony was interested in or as smart as Tony apparently was, and he wondered, if
“Yeah,” Tony replied, thinking of the suit hanging in his closet.  It had to have come from Jarvis, considering that it didn’t look like something Siegfried and Roy rejected for looking too much like a walking Lite-Brite. “I have something.”
“Yeah.  He’s booked up ‘til May, but I got on the waitlist,” Steve responded, giving Wilson a brief glance before going back to building his rice mountain.
“Look, yes, okay,” Rhodey cut in.  “He’s definitely that was-that-one-time-in-boot-camp-really-just-because-of-the-whiskey kind of questioning yourself hot, but it isn’t like you haven’t been around good-looking people before, Tones, so what’s with the whole red alert thing this morning?” Rhodey asked.
Tony popped the pill into his mouth and cupped his hand under the faucet to chase it down with a swallow of water before the devil on his shoulder started playing his favorite tune.
In the tank, over his shoulder, the little diver pumped air, and the fish avoided it, and the water ran, swishing and burbling and
,” Tony corrected. “But, they will one day.  I suppose then we’ll see if your system is truly any more arbitrary than ours.”
“So, you’re saying, if we found something like that, we would eventually have to…take her out for a spin, so to speak,” Steve added.
“Hey, hey, what the hell are you insinuating? That I got myself kidnapped by terrorists for shits and grins?” Tony demanded.  He pressed his hand over the microphone in front of him to mute it and leaned over to Steve. “You okay?”
Tony wasn’t sure why, wasn’t really thinking anything beyond lizard brain functions at the moment, but he shifted his stance slightly, lowering his hips and angling upward, using his knees to nudge Steve’s legs further apart as he did.  A second after he did, his body understood perfectly as the knot swelled, filling Steve even more, and attached, linking them together and keeping his seed in place.  He felt another wave of moist heat engulf his cock as it did, and heard himself emit a long, low moan of absolute pleasure, the feeling of being tethered like this, in some unspeakable, unbreakable way was overwhelming, almost too much to bear.  He was matched by Steve’s low, keening wail, building to some crescendo that only Steve could see.
Tony pushed himself off the sofa and stood, turning towards the hallway.  “Um.  There’s two more. After this.  Two more movies. I mean, technically, there are--basically two more. We could maybe watch those next,” Tony offered.
Steve was standing on the deck, both hands on the railing as he stared out at the starlit sky.  It was so similar to that first night Steve was home that for a fraction of a second, Tony thought he was seeing things.  He stopped, halfway across the driveway to the cabin, frozen in place while he waited to see if Steve had noticed him.
STOP READING!!!!  There is a Bonus Chapter in my Thank You Fics that is intended to fit between chapter 5 and chapter 6.  I almost just added it, but then didn't want to be all George Lucas about changing things, so feel free to read this as originally posted or stop now and go read the bonus chapter. I think it adds a lot to their dynamic, but that is totally up to you.  Thanks for reading, however you choose to read it!
Tony was nodding.  “I get that.  For me, particularly after Afghanistan, it’s control.  The need to be in control.  People think it’s because I think I’m so much better or smarter or whatever, and yeah, okay, I’m not exactly the poster child for a lack of ego, but the truth is, I’m mostly just terrified that something is going to go wrong, and that’s going to be on me.  I won’t be good enough.  I’ll miss something.  I’ll miss something, and people will die.  Because that’s what happened, and that’s on me.  So, this?  All of this with Batroc and Obadiah and the rest of them?  Hell, even you.  It’s—I’ve got to do it.  Me.  Matt wanted me to go to the authorities, and I—I couldn’t.  I told myself, it was because I couldn’t trust that they weren’t compromised, not as high as this goes, and that’s true enough, but it’s not all there was to it.  I wanted to do it my way, where I’m the one with my hand on all the moving parts because I can’t let something go wrong again.  I can’t.  So, if we’re doing this, you should know that about me.”
“Yeah.  Yeah, I know, Tony.  Me, too,” Steve said, smiling softly at him, eyes crinkling at the corners.  “It’s…” he trailed off, blowing out a puff of air and turning to stare through the windshield while the car idled in the driveway.
The drawing, still not quite finished despite feverishly working on it through the morning while Tony slept, was stowed in an empty drawer in the chest in his room.  The space socks currently sitting atop a bag of potatoes in his cart would probably join the drawing in his nearly empty drawer.  He didn’t want to give them to Tony until he knew they weren’t wrong in some unfathomable way.  He didn’t want Tony to look at him like that again, like he had with the Jetsons, with that strange kind of surprise, that knowing sense of wrongness, that people got when Steve messed up.
“You could reuse the one that’s in there,” Tony replied after a pause, trying to keep the distaste out of his voice and clearly not succeeding by the apologetic look Steve shot him.
“This…this is me happy,” Tony whispered, an aching, wet sound that he didn’t mean to let out coming on the heels of his words.   “Are you…happy?”
Steve looked down at the tableau.  Tony’s thighs had clamped down on the other Steve’s head, holding him there while he licked and sucked at Tony’s rim.  The smaller version of himself curled half-on Tony’s chest and leaned down to take the head of Tony’s cock into his mouth as his other self stroked lightly up and down.
“Hey, there you are!  I was wondering when you’d drag back in,” Brock said brightly, walking towards where Steve stood with their bags lined up on the end of the bed.  “Well?  Come on, let me see it!” he added, making a gimme gesture with his hands.
But Tony ignored him and continued on, seemingly talking to the park at large.  “I thought I was above that.  A better person than those other people that would just use you.  But the truth is…I knew from that first night that you wouldn’t be doing this without being absolutely desperate.  Maybe some people could and just enjoy the money, but not you.  I knew that, but I let myself keep on with it anyway.  Told myself whatever it was, I was helping, after all, right?  Making it easier, right?  God, what a crock of shit.  Never let it be said I can’t thoroughly delude myself when I really want to.”
“Probably,” Tony admitted, but made no move to do so.  He heard Steve sigh, then felt himself pulled against the solid bulk of Steve’s chest.  One of Steve’s hands was carding through his hair, over and over, in a soothing motion, while the other stayed low on his back.  Tony folded his arms between them and gripped the front of Steve’s shirt with his hands.  The shaking was subsiding as the surge of adrenaline wore off.  It was still all too surreal to really begin to process, Tony decided somewhat hazily as he melted into Steve’s warmth.  His car was at the bottom of a mountain.  It was impossible, sure, but almost seemed like it wasn’t even the most impossible thing that had happened in the last fifteen minutes, so dealing with that could just fuck off until he had time to wrap his head around Steve’s words.
Tony reached out an armored hand to grab Steve’s shoulder, bringing Steve’s head around to look at him in question.  “It says ‘Stark’ on the side,” Tony mumbled.  “That’s…that’s where you should go.  To meet.  Me.  Meet me. Later.  When you’re done.  Are you tired?  I’m tired.  Big battle and all that.  We could sleep.  I could sleep.  You should sleep,” Tony offered desperately.
He clapped his hands together, then let the smile fall away, his face settling into what Bucky called his ‘thinking look.’ Stevie’s thinking again, everyone take cover.  Steve smiled a bit at the memory of Bucky’s voice sounding in his head, a bittersweet pang making his breath hitch.
“No act.  I really am this clueless,” Steve said intending to come across as affronted and indignant, but must not have managed it because Tony just burst out laughing.  And then Steve couldn’t help but join in because the whole situation as just about as ridiculous as it could get and laughing seemed like a better release than an anxiety attack, after all.
“Take off your robe and lie on the bed for me,” Tony ordered, making a shiver run down Steve’s spine and coil, hot and liquid, in his gut.  There was always something in Tony’s voice when he spoke to Steve like this. Some cadence, almost like a certain note vibrating that went straight to some deep, dark part of Steve’s mind.  It sounded, if he had to put a name to it, like a softer version of the noise that erupted from Tony’s hammer when he was at the forge back at the Castle. A quaking, hard, metallic sound that echoed into Steve’s bones and shaped him into something transformed, as surely as Tony’s strong, clever hands worked the metal that he reformed.
“It was not your fault,” Steve whispered, his words blowing through Tony’s hair.  A sob wracked Tony’s body, then a high, keening wail.  Steve held him.  Tony’s head shook back and forth, grinding into Steve’s chest.  “It was not, Tony.  It is the fault of those who carried it out and used your trust to protect themselves.”
“Well.   You know what else helps you deal with the bad memories?” Tony asked, scooting down the bed again to curl himself around Steve, slinging a leg over Steve’s hip and finding his hand again.  “Making good ones,” Tony breathed out, warm into the curve of Steve’s neck, almost a laugh, like he couldn’t quite believe it.
“Interesting,” Stark said, tilting his head to the side in a way that made Steve feel a bit like one of those bugs pinned to a board.
“Don’t mock George. He does his best,” Barnes protested from the doorway.  “Those are way overdone,” the Hamburger Police said, coming to peer over Tony’s shoulder.
After a long moment, Howard nodded, a quick jerk of his head, but the pressure in the room seemed to release with the movement.
“Good. That is…all that matters,” Tony said.  “You should rest tonight.  Enjoy an evening to yourself.  There will be food and a bath waiting for you when you return to your rooms.  And a…a token.  Of my affection.”
Captain Rogers wanted to see Tony by himself, so, apparently, that was what was going to happen, and Howard could just take a fucking seat.  Tony would be gleeful if he wasn’t currently going with Option B, terrified.
“I never really imagined I would like children all that much, but having him around has… well, made me reconsider things a bit,” Tony nodded, the words coming out clipped and under his breath.   “Were you to...to know a child from early on in their life, I think...I think you would come to care for them quite deeply,” Tony said, eyes narrowing a bit as his head cocked to the side, his gaze assessing.
me,” Tony mocked in a harsh, brittle voice.  Steve drew back, dropped his eyes and sucked in a breath.  It hurt.  The dismissal. The cavalier manner of it. The way it made Steve feel less real in some way, just a thing to be used.  Even with the truth behind it, it hurt.  Perhaps more so because there was truth behind it, and Steve knew it.  They both knew it. And yet…not since the beginning had Tony truly treated him as anything less than someone to be cared for like some priceless gift.
“The golden-coated one who kept trying to kick the stable door down and bite my hand when I offered it sugar cubes,” Tony replied, giving a pointed look at Steve while Cam did little to hide a laugh.
“Tony…Tony…Tony,” Steve chanted.  “Please.   Please, God, please.”  Tony grinned at the desperation in his voice, the thrill of having done this to his Omega, brought him to this state, was nearly enough to undo him right then and there.  He breathed in a long, steadying breath before dipping his head and wrapping his mouth over the head of Steve’s cock.  Steve was making harsh, guttural noises as Tony applied suction, hollowing his cheeks and using his tongue to work the delicate slit.  He felt another spurt of pre-come leak into his throat as he flattened his tongue and drew more of Steve’s length into his mouth.  He brought his hands to Steve’s hips to guide him in the short, small thrusts that worked Steve’s cock to the back of Tony’s throat.  Tony hollowed his cheeks again, sucking harder as he drew his teeth down the sensitive skin until just the head was in his mouth.  He jabbed his tongue at the slit, then swirled it around the head of Steve’s shaft in wide circles, letting out a low hum that vibrated up Steve’s length.  Saliva pooled in his mouth and he swallowed once around Steve’s cock, causing Steve’s hips to twitch sharply under his hands and a soft cry to fall from his lips.
“Bet sugar daddy could get you out with a phone call,” Brock muttered, stretching back in his seat so his knees bumped the seat in front of him.  “Hear he’s pretty tight with the Mayor.  And the Governor.  And the President, come to think of it.” Steve swallowed uncomfortably, and frowned over at Brock, who gave him a sharp look.  “What?  Just sayin’, man.”
Tony emailed back and forth with Professor Thorne and some of the grad students.  He was still half-convinced they only listened to him because of Steve, and were probably laughing at him behind his back, but none of that changed the fact that they were often wrong about things.  Honestly, these were the best and brightest?  It almost caused physical pain.
“Stay back! I know what you are,” Steve shouted, making the sign of the cross as much out of habit as any belief that it might help.
He stared up at the imposing façade, with its eagle symbol and cordon of concrete posts that protected the entrance.  It wasn’t that long ago that he’d walked through the doors with his parents in tow, wearing a wrinkled suit and a layer of anxiety that vibrated through him until he thought he would come apart.  Not all at once.  Just a piece here and a piece there, until someone finally noticed there wasn’t anything left of him.
