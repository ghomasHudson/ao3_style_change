Sherlock shivered and arched his head back, giving John more access, “
"I- that's..." Sherlock shook his head, looking stunned and confused, adorable with his hair mussed and eyes wide. He glanced shyly at the table then back at John, his cheeks slowly reddening with color.
The smaller man gave his new sleeping partner a shove, too rough to be playful, but not hard enough to hurt him. "One condition. Tell me what possessed you to come sneak into my bed. Which, I'd like to add, is barely big enough for the two of us."
Sherlock's face dropped into a disbelieving visage which would have been funny if it weren't for the gravity of the situation. John knew him so well- always did…and he was losing him- wasn't he?
"Undress me. Want you to see what you'll be dealing with," the businessman instructed, eyelids heavy and body anticipating.
John was totally unprepared for the sudden and shockingly hefty weight of Sherlock launching himself from his rickety chair and tackling John onto the grubby kitchen floor. Rather violently and, as John's back landed against the floor with a jarring
time." Sherlock started to defend himself, but John laughed and snogged him, effectively silencing him.
"Ta, Sherlock." John replied sarcastically, pulling himself out with relief and giving himself a few quick strokes.
"That thought hasn't even crossed my mind." Sherlock whispered. "How could you ever think I would harbor that idea of you? I..I l-" He bit his lip to keep the word inside, not knowing if he would be rejected now or not. John flinched, oblivious to the unspoken words, as Sherlock's dexterous fingers stroked along the back of his hand, mapping veins and bones and tiny scars in the tenderest topography. John sucked in another shaky, wet breath, and Sherlock continued quietly. “I loathe that you think that. Truly. What do you take me for? Apart from an arrogant, rude, sociopathic arse," He joked feebly. John chuckled wetly, turning his hand over and clasping Sherlock's.
Sherlock paused for a split-second, considering. "It would be financially beneficial for both of us. And certain relevant laws and clauses are only applicable to legally-partnered couples."
"Christ." He gritted his teeth, the tendons in his neck standing out as he tried to hold himself back.
"Can I try something," John murmured, beckoning the brunette to lay beside him, which he did with a relieved grunt. "Turn away from me."
"You feel...fucking amazing...do you want my tongue in you?" Shaun slurred, giving a playful, sharp thrust.
"You do?" Sherlock asked suspiciously, hope blooming in his chest.
John grinned. "It's just...too much." He glanced between Sherlock's thighs where he was half hard, cock red. "Want me to...do anything?"
He turned his attention away from the attacker in front of him and glanced around-
"Sorry," he murmured, in a deep, guttural voice.
"If that's what you want." John said, breaking into his scattered thoughts. "It's fine, Sherlock. Whatever you want…it's fine. If you don't like this as much as you think you will...tell me. I won't be disappointed. We can do something else."
There came a loud, unhappy noise of disgruntlement, before Sherlock squeezed his hand back with reluctant fondness. He followed him into the hot, rowdy atmosphere of the pub, inundated with after-hours office workers gossiping loudly over mid-priced pints, single older men who had clearly been making this their nightly routine for the last twenty years, and a few misplaced female, over-dressed teens who had underestimated the attention they would receive in this small, cheap establishment.
"We need to be closer." John tugged Sherlock against him, wedging his cock between them. "To ensure maximum heat transfer."
For tonight, at least.
"I intend to."
"You're breath-taking. All you have to do is look at me and I get hard."
John accepted his self-conscious silence with a knowing grin, before settling back onto the bed with a languid, happy groan. "Oh," he suddenly uttered, propping himself up slightly. "Get me something to wear while you're at it. I'm coming with you."
!" Falling to all fours and pulling open the door of the cupboard under the sink, Why hadn't he thought of this earlier? He'd hidden here just last month when the gang leader and his thugs Lestrade had been trying to nab had stormed into the flat with guns waving. Sherlock had secreted himself here and waited for the perfect opportunity to ambush them. It'd worked a treat and Sherlock was confident he wouldn't be found this time either as he tossed out the mop and cleaning materials. He took a deep breath and folded his long, lean body into the dark space, closing the door upon himself. "I'm not here." he added in a smothered deep voice.
He was being laughed at. By John.
,” Sherlock complained, pushing his mouth to John’s jaw and neck, stroking and then awkwardly patting John’s bare shoulder.
to do with my cock, ok?" John snapped. It was 5:42 am, he'd had a bad dream, he was sleepy and soaked and not in the mood. "Our roof has a leak."
"Look, I was surprised- fucking stunned, actually- when I got your message but...You don't exactly see me having a crisis, do you?"
Exactly eighty seconds of ostensibly placid quiet later, and John spoke up. “I don’t know what you want. Stop looking at me.”
"Why don't we...try something else? Ok? I don't want to hurt you. Not...not when I can pleasure you instead." John offered, awkwardly. "That is, if the 'uninspiring' murders of this particular venue haven't killed your mood entirely."
“Ugh, details. Fine, burn your carbohydrates if you’re so fussy. It won’t do you any good.”
That was it.
Sherlock surged up and shoved John backwards onto the bed, stopping their kiss as he leaned over him, falling to his elbows as they clumsily bumped against one another. There was a brief pause where Sherlock seemed to stare into John’s eyes, incredibly close and trembling, and then he cupped John’s jaw in both hands and reconnected their lips with a moist, hot, and shaky breath.
Narrowing his eyes in playful disdain at being ordered around, John took his sweet time in fetching the lube from the bedside table, regardless of his own impatient arousal. Plucking the slightly-sticky bottle from its gooey harbour beside the lamp, he rotated his hips thoughtfully as he slowly popped open the lid, swirling the slick liquid in the transparent bottle raptly.
"Can I put my finger in...inside you?" Sherlock asked, after a few minutes of silently watching John. He crouched naked on the bed, dark curls tumbling over his forehead, face streaked with drying come, eyes uncertain and hopeful at the same time. His right hand hovered over John’s thigh, waiting for permission. John had never seen him look so beautiful. He had to try twice before he was able to force the words out of his arousal-clogged throat.
"By an inappropriate hard-on? You're right. Not at all disconcerting," John mumbled with as much sarcasm as he could muster. "...It won't go away on its own, not with you hovering over me, so you'll have to let me up soon."
John was by now giggling steadily. “Get on with it, you berk,” he said fondly.
"...Are you expecting something in return now?"  John smirked, sliding under the heavy covers with a gratified sigh. "Because I will get you something," he promised, rolling to face the middle of the bed.
"I...I thought we were friends. And that...you were...fond of me. Beyond that...I...wasn't sure."
"G-go as slow as you want. Just. Start. Please." He spread his legs even further, offering himself to John. John hesitated but slid his fingers from Sherlock's arse, using them to spread lube on his cock.
"...How long since you figured it out?" John mumbled against Sherlock's warm, worn-soft T-shirt.
John flinched abruptly as Sherlock was reading the ingredient list on the back of the bottle with clinical interest, and the taller man looked down inquisitively.
"Whoever she's recently had sex with, obviously. She's the sort of person who would delight in informing everybody she knows the moment she confirmed that her uterus was occupied with a foetus. It must have been relatively recent. She's intelligent enough to realise that a missed period is a warning sign, and of course she's qualified in the medical field. Within the last two months, then. Who's she been going out with? That......" There was a long, furrow-browed pause. "…...Craig?"
Then came a minute change of angle, and the detective coughed out what would have been a protracted wail of pleasure, if the increasingly powerful thrusts weren't practically knocking the breath from his lungs.
huffed as he was gently but firmly manhandled onto a soft mattress. Sherlock stared up at John with wide eyes, licking his lips nervously and John took the inadvertent movement as an invitation and kissed him, licking at Sherlock's lips and tracing them with his tongue, provoking a low moan from Sherlock.
"Tell me both."
"Greg...Greg...he might be...what's going on?" he asked quizzically, though worry imbued each and every word.
Sherlock felt inexplicably drained, despite having many hours of sleep, and it wasn't until he rolled over and tried to sit up that the muscles of his upper arms and abdomen twinged in resistance, and the previous night's epic orgasms came back to him. He groaned in smug satisfaction and sat up, feeling a bit dizzy, and grinned in utter delight at the memory.
He kept his eyes closed as John rinsed his hair, then started gently scrubbing his body, ridding it of the scent of the man's cologne and the residual glitter of his street walker attire.
Sherlock acceded even further, widening his legs and removing his fingers from his pink, damp opening, feeling highly bashful at such exposure, but convinced that such a visceral image would totally shut down any last excuses John might be thinking of making.
He licked his lips, moaning. "S'good...really good...wish it was you…Oh…John, kiss me. With tongues, please," came the shuddery order. John awkwardly crawled to the side, keeping the fleshjack firmly in place, and leaned forward to give Sherlock the kiss he wanted, licking into his mouth and groaning in surprise when Sherlock sucked eagerly on his tongue. Sherlock growled into the kiss before pulling away with a sweet smack of lips. He grinned up at John.
"Trust me," John murmured, placing his hand over Sherlock's flickering eyelids, eliciting a soft, yet not entirely-disagreeing noise.
Totally blinkered, his senses reduced to scent, taste, touch and sound, Sherlock nibbled his bottom lip, titling his head back and absorbing everything he could. "...Your fingers...you're using a new handwash...I know you don't like using mine because you think it's too posh for you...but they're softer than usual...your breath...I can tell you're using the same mouthwash and toothpaste as usual even though…I can smell the beer from the pub earlier. A microbrew you're rather fond of...your voice...you've b-been spending time with a new employee at work who smokes...you pretend you smoke just to get the ten minute break."
Sherlock knew. "...It's amazing. Thanks," he said honestly, placing it reverently to one side and stood up, going to hug Sherlock, and then awkwardly losing steam, patting his upper arms instead.
John felt him softening a little, and grunted a little in retaliation and determination. A few seconds later, Sherlock let out an unseemly
Oh- Sherlock had
"Ah...shit...hang on," John laughed, his voice sweet and breathy. "Two seconds. Up," he instructed, getting onto his knees in the dark and cursing again as he knocked into the bedside table, hearing something small roll off of it and clatter to the hardwood floor.
Sherlock was obviously in a bad mood, but John thought that had more to do with the fact that they'd had to leave the flat, post-shag, the semen barely cooling on their bodies, to solve a case. Well, maybe he could make it worthwhile, he thought.
At this remark, the pretty, dark-haired woman in the corner busied herself with her tea, adding unnecessary amounts of sugar and picking cucumber out of her salmon sandwiches with the intense concentration of someone disarming a bomb.
Sherlock sighed. "If you really want me there....though I'm not sure why."
John tried to take a breath but was enamoured with the sight of Sherlock fucking himself. It wasn't a new sight - maybe on the couch in broad daylight was new - but it never ceased to amaze him. He felt his mouth water at the sight, filling with enough liquid to give him the idea of what he wanted to do. Dropping his coat on the floor, the doctor cleared the space in a few quick strides, getting to his knees and moaning as he watched Sherlock's greedy body suck at his fingers.
'You know?'
"God, just look at you." John breathed as Sherlock's shirt dropped soundlessly to the floor. Sherlock made a faint moue of disagreement but did nothing to stop John when he, kissing at Sherlock's neck and sucking what Sherlock hoped would be another livid bruise against his skin, used both his hands to tug at and undo Sherlock's belt.
Sherlock's hips bucked up, pushing his cock into John's mouth, but he didn't take his eyes away from the screen. "Lestrade. He's...the suspect was caught on camera..."
"Do that again." John commanded breathlessly, and Sherlock swirled his tongue around the head of his cock, licking at the bead of moisture collected there. John blundered a hand into Sherlock's heavenly, dark curls, and gulped, his breaths starting to present a struggle as he fought his rapidly-rising orgasm. A few faint, closed-mouth moans and sobs, accompanying his tightly-closed eyes, betrayed his imminent climax.
John swallowed with barely-restrained arousal, his eyes flickering tellingly as he glanced over his partner's shivering body, which was a glorious study in absolute want. "Christ, Sherlock...you...need something inside you?" He asked, even though Sherlock had pretty much already made this fact clear.
No. - JW.
Um…yeah, I don’t even. Though I got the requested ‘coming untouched’ in there ;)
"Let me clean you up first, sweetheart," John murmured soothingly, raising his voice enough to be heard over the furious rainfall battering the bedroom window.
“Sherlock, your back.” John breath deeply, “tell me what the issue is, what’s going on?” John was always attentive to his needs, always feeding him, forcing him to drink and sleep and keeping him well. But he had no answer. He didn’t know why this happened, he couldn’t piece together the information, maybe John could?
“I’m not quite sure, it’s like he passed out, but it didn’t look like one. I just know he hit the deck hard and this is the aftermath.” John said to the landlady, still primarily focused on Sherlock rather than his conversation.
“Sherlock?” John questioned, starting to worry a little. It was like he had misplaced his voice box. Still no response came, but now that John was focusing, he realised how much the detective was shaking. And not the type from being outside in the winters breeze, but the intense -freezing borderline hypothermia- shaking. But he was also sweating copious amounts.
“John.” He breathed before collapsing forward into the floor boards beneath, feeling the collision with the ground before he let himself be taken by the dark edges that had been vignetting his vision.
“I feel lost, my mind is a shamble. I can’t differentiate between emotions, yet I feel all of them. I can’t figure out what I want, but I know what I want. I ca-can’t… John… I can’t.” Sherlock looked into his friends’ eyes. Hoping he could slot the jigsaw together that he couldn’t.
So, he laid on his side, staring into the eyes of John, as his mind collapsed around him.
His face felt heavy from tears but had a body light enough to float away. Everything was disproportionate, and he couldn’t place why. He felt his body began to sway, sway to the vertigo that had started to become second nature to his form. There was only one word, one thought that could be pulled from the disarray of his current life.
“Hey.” John said, smiling down at his friend.
Lestrade had called with a 9, but it was more of a 6 when he got there. He solved the case in just under 30 minutes before leaving. He had heard muffled remarks of ‘freak’ and ‘psychopath’ as he left the scene. But instead of going home, he walked. Walked for what felt like forever. He left the crime scene 8:20am and didn’t return home until 6pm. He spent nearly 10 hours walking the streets of London. It took him 5 hours to walk home from the crime scene. But he had spent an extra 5 hours walking the streets, talking to his homeless network, trying to deduce his surroundings. Something must have happened at the crime scene, because his mind was a wreck. He couldn’t concentrate. He remembered distinctly nearly getting hit 6 times by various moving vehicles. It was like coming down from a drug fuelled rampage, yet he hadn’t touched drugs since, well a long time.
He can feel wetness fill his eyes, a steady stream beginning to pour from them for no reason. What was happening? His cheeks felt warm, but his body was cold like ice. He felt shaky, yet stiff as a stone; cold but his head was burning and dirty but the cleanest ever. He was overrun by feelings, yet his mind had stopped. He was no longer the detective that could deduce everything from a single sneeze, no longer the cold reptile like being who could detach himself from life, no longer the unemotional man who didn’t care. He was an empty shell, but there was no reason for it.
“Sherlock? Can you hear me? Open your eyes if you can hear me.” There was no response which wasn’t good but very much expected considering the height of the fall and the fact that he didn’t stop himself as he collided with the ground. John ran his hands over his friend, carefully rolling him over onto his side, taking in the very noticeable head laceration on the right temple, that had started to pool down the centre of his face and not only leak into the closed eyes but combine with the heavy blood receding out of his nose. John felt a little guilty for what happened but pushed it sharply out of his mind as he attempted to take care of his patient. He gave Sherlock’s collar bone a hard squeeze gaging for response to pain, but Sherlock continued to loll into the ground oblivious to the world as it spun around him.
“There is nothing wrong, but there is.” Sherlock’s voice cut cleanly through John’s thought’s. John was startled by the strangled quiet voice that was his friend. The baritone grumble that was usually present was nowhere to be found and the shakiness, though no longer noticeable in his body was evident in his voice.
“Sherlock can you hear me?” It was almost like a whisper. But he could tell it had been loud, as the lip movements of his friend were very pronounced. He tried to speak, but no words came out. He tried to nod, but his body was unresponsive. He couldn’t do anything, so he looked into his friends’ eyes and blinked, blinked the newly formed tears as they mixed with drying blood and leaked down his face.
John spent a solid five minutes, assessing Sherlock’s body for injuries as well as all the usual basic vital signs, even though he had a decent idea that this had nothing to do with a medical condition. After all his vitals came back within normal ranges he went over a head-to-toe and sent a text to Lestrade to ask anything about the case that may have impacted Sherlock’s condition. At this point, he could start to feel the detective resisting his hands, at one-point Sherlock had tried to roll on to his stomach so he could get up. John carefully pushed Sherlock back onto the ground preserving the recovery position so any draining blood that was still slowly leaking from his nose and head avoided making him choke. A disorientated Sherlock was one think, a choking and panicking one was an entirely different handbook. Sherlock’s eyes were starting to open, John was still padding done the blood that was pooling in his eyes. He could imagine that he wouldn’t be able to see much through the red haze.
“John.” The word was choked by the emotion it emitted, it was full of confusion, desperation and an elegance that Sherlock often led with. But it was a word uttered under the intense pressure of fear, the need for help. Distracted by this John stood and watched as his best friend face planted into the floor. He heard bones crack and saw blood start to seep. He was out cold.
“Sherlock, come on mate, calm down. Your safe.” Sherlock had gone stiff still noticeably fearful, his sympathetic system working on overdrive. Sherlock’s eyes were blinking rapidly.
“What have you done Sherlock?” John muttered more to himself than the detective.
A few minutes after his request, Mrs Hudson returned with a bulking medic bag with army camouflage, technically the same one he had on tour, but topped up with his own supplies and laid out in a fashion that was easily recognisable for him in emergencies.
“Sherlock, can you hear me?” And within a second, he could see the change. Sherlock’s eyes began to relax, his heart rate slowing along with his respiratory rate. And even though he didn’t answer he blinked, and John watched as his friend blinked excitingly like it was the first time he had ever heard a voice before. John pretended not to notice the dampening of the detective’s eyes as they mixed with the now dried blood.
"Probably." Sherlock said bluntly, brushing past Molly and making his way upstairs as if he owned the place. He dumped his Belstaff on the landing and promptly peered into every room in the flat, eyes flicking about and taking in details that may be important.
"All your things will be ruined if you don't move them downstairs, John." She said. "You can put them in Sherlock's room until we get the roof fixed."
John's fists tightened and clenched at his sides, nails digging reassuringly into his palms until he exhaled, pushing out as much of the raising irritableness as he could. Glaring daggers at Sherlock, he called back to him as he made his way to the living room again. "What are you writing?"
John's hands smoothed down his legs, eyes dark and hot against his skin. "Y-yeah. That's perfect, Sherlock." He murmured, throat bobbing as he swallowed. "Perfect. Is it...is this alright for you? I didn't ask...I just assumed you wouldn't care-"
, are you all right?" John asked again, stressing his name overzealously. "You didn't seem like you enjoyed the joke."
"Text from Molly. Apparently she's...with child."
"I just had the best sex ever," he whispered loudly to their pet, then giggled at the happy absurdity of it. He stretched luxuriously in the balmy, still air of the flat, before mussing his own sweat-damp and ruined hair, cringing a little.
By the time John was dressed and ready to go to the crime scene, Sherlock had his plan - and his defences - ready. He was going to win.
John's spine went rigid but Sherlock kept walking, pretending not to hear. Taking his cue from Sherlock, John carried on walking too, though he was obviously braced for action. Sherlock heard the tell-tale sound of a bottle smashing against the bench they had just vacated, and in his mind's eye, could see razor-sharp, unclean glass clenched as a weapon in a strong hand. His eyes darted over the ground, looking for a weapon of his own, wishing they'd thought to bring John's gun. How stupid of them not to have done.
"I'm very aroused." Sherlock admitted out of the blue, swallowing thickly and flexing his hips unconsciously, almost rubbing his testicles on John's forehead.
John sobbed, his drunken consciousness reluctant to believe such sweet talk. Generally, Shaun spouted enticing filth and made a lot of delicious noises. "...Hurts a bit." He managed, peering dizzily at the man above him, his own face crinkled in discomfort.
John licked his bottom lip, eyes raking over Sherlock's body as he patted the bed. "Come lie down?"
"Mm. Years ago. Not since I was in my twenties." John stretched out beside Sherlock, content to let his arousal simmer for a while, pleased he'd been able to reduce Sherlock to the semi-boneless state he was currently in. As far as that went, he could take care of himself. If Sherlock was too tired...
somehow,” Sherlock asked his landlady, fixing her with a piercing, challenging glare.
John eyed the reddened, hard cock between Sherlock's legs, fluid dripping copiously from the tip, and his tongue snaked out, clenched between his teeth. "Get yourself off." He instructed, groping for Sherlock's hand and placing it on the throbbing erection.
?" John asked and, when Sherlock nodded, curls bobbing in the dark of the room, John bit out a soft curse. He crossed the room in three quick strides, tugging Sherlock's head down with one hand and sealing their lips together, and with the other one easily sliding the buttons of Sherlock's shirt apart. There was a faint, choked noise that could have been misconstrued as discomfort if Sherlock's erection hadn't been nudging politely against John's stomach.
The crunch of Shaun's nose breaking under Sherlock's fist was loud in the alleyway. "
With every press, Sherlock shakily returned it with a rolling, taut rutting of his own, and made a low sound of avid approval each time. He seemed both boneless and tensed with desire, and began to knead, stroke, caress and grope at John’s arms, shoulders, back and sides, seeking out every inch of his torso with friskily scratching fingertips. John had never seen Sherlock look so wild, so zealous, desperate and lost to sensation before, and he only seemed to get more overwhelmed and ravenous for more.
"To see you come," John elaborated bluntly. "To watch your
Lestrade blinked a few times before nodding. "Ah, so it's about that then."
," John huffed with open fascination, barely pumping his numb wrist inside the other man, clinically amazed by the sight which was virginal to him, the easy stretch of pink outer flesh, the adaptation of internal organs around a glorious intruder...
“John doesn’t know anything
Sherlock felt a stab of irritation. He was feeling none of those things. Couldn't John
...Definitely Lestrade. They could share domestic sob stories.
...not...anymore." Sherlock thrashed, begging for all he was worth as the pleasure morphed into pain, afraid John would force him to orgasm again. Shaking with the lingering aftershocks of his orgasm, Sherlock never wanted to come again.
Rolling off of the detective, he sighed indulgently, radiating damp heat.
Sherlock's eyes snapped open, pinning John with a heartbreakingly open, incredulous look. "What?"
John sighed and sat up in bed, smearing the back of his hand across one sore eye, and then the inside of his wrist across the other, drying them cursorily. He hated that he still suffered. It wasn’t daily, there was no routine to it, no schedule, he either suffered through the harrowing nightmares or he didn’t. At first he thought adventure and adrenaline helped to prevent them, but there had been times, many times, where a case had actually given him stronger nightmares.
He panted, the slide and raw constriction of Sherlock's arse around his cock threatening to rob him of all control. To give himself something else to concentrate on, John grabbed Sherlock's cock, giving it a stroke which made Sherlock clamp tighter around him, moaning.
"I said penis!" came the sudden, but tellingly-urgent baritone complaint.
He shook his head. "Still in the freezer. That there is Derek. The little twink from London. The one in the leathers."
Sherlock nodded slowly, swallowing thickly. "I'll just…start then?"
"Sherlock...whatever you want." John huffed with a perfect, honest laugh, his deep-blue eyes darkened even more by his heavily-dilated pupils. His tongue snaked out and ran over his lips, and Sherlock wanted nothing more than to move up his doctors' body and snag it in a kiss, but he relented, reluctantly, turning his attention to between John's legs.
Something John had missed?
"Until next time, John." he promised, eyes twinkling, pulling on his clothes and standing up with surprising and enviable decorum. He strode out and left John alone in the tent.
“What do you think I’ve been doing? Guess, John. Look at the evidence.” Sherlock knew he was teasing, but he felt justified. For once, he hadn’t actually done anything wrong. Well, not wrong in the sense that John was suggesting.
“…So…you don’t think I would indulge in something like that purely for my own pleasure?”
John gritted his teeth as unhelpful memories of wild, rampant encounters with his ex-boyfriend swamped his treacherous mind. What Sherlock was doing to him- now teasingly running his hand along John's cock- was nothing compared to what his ex had done, what John had delighted in with him...and that was fine, John sternly told himself, ridding himself of the memories and focusing on Sherlock, whose head was cocked to the side, studying John, giving him the creepy idea that Sherlock could read minds.
"Right, come on," he announced in a no-nonsense fashion, scooping his arms under Sherlock and, bracing them under Sherlock's considerable weight, managed to lift him with a small grunt and take a few steps, depositing the squirming brunette on the rug beside the bed.
"Is there a problem between you and John, dear? I've heard some awful bickering between the two of you lately. All that thumping around."
After a few wonderful minutes of gentle, questing smooching, John pulled back, slightly breathless, giggling soundlessly as Sherlock frowned and tried to follow him with a kiss-bitten mouth.
"Go on. It's
John pressed his lips into a thin line, biting his bottom lip as he propped himself up further, rubbing shoulders with Sherlock against the headboard, as he reluctantly watched the new video.
"I'll take that as a favourable response," he chuckled, hugging the overwhelmed detective to himself.
"Bedroom," John uttered simply, easing himself off Sherlock and casually wandering in the direction of their bedroom, slowly undoing his belt along the way.
"I used to have one as a kid-"
," Sherlock groaned, as John's fingers delicately but knowledgeably slid between his legs.
"What are you going to do?" John's hand sped up, jacking Sherlock ruthlessly. "Are you going to come, Sherlock? Come with people less than ten yards from us? You can hear them, can't you? Talking, laughing...not aware that we're here..."
John was being decidedly slow - unforgivably slow, and Sherlock, with a damp brow, and wheezing noisily, made his opinion known.
John's body went rigid and he hissed, hands spasming at his sides. "
John choked back a laugh, almost gagging on his own pineapple at the sight of Sherlock's stunned, wide-eyed reaction.
off, that doesn't mean
“About what?” The doctor asked, extending a warm hand to tentatively cradle the mound of Sherlock’s high cheekbone.
He also didn't mention that the idea of Sherlock taking control made his cock
“Wow. Lovely,” John deadpanned.
let me come. Please." Sherlock babbled in a delirium of need, still jerking at his restraints as if he would be able to free himself.
John's head went back, teeth gritted hard enough to hurt his jaw, and he yowled, coughing out high-pitched sobs, and fucking into Sherlock hard enough to bruise both of them while he blessedly, finally climaxed.
"I love you when you're being stroppy and rude because you don't have a case, bashing around the flat and snapping at me every time I clear my throat." He eased one lubricated finger into Sherlock's still-stretched from earlier body. "I love you when you're sulking and won't talk to me. I love you when you're happy, when your eyes light up and you're laughing. I love to hear you laugh, Sherlock." John murmured, kissing the base of Sherlock's cock before taking it in his mouth as he eased another finger in alongside the first and began a slow, rocking rhythm, keeping his movements slow and unhurried. He loved having rough sex with Sherlock…but that didn't mean he didn't equally adore making love to the consulting detective when given the chance.
“Not particularly. As long as you haven’t been out shooting up somewhere, I don’t care.”
A month later, the med tent was deserted- thankfully- after a long, tiring day of seeing patients. John and Shaun were using the calm and quiet to their advantage. The heat was intense, heavy, and dense, and both were sticky before they'd even started snogging. The sun was just disappearing over a sweltering horizon as John dragged down Shaun's fatigues gracelessly. He gnawed at the poorly-executed tattoo on his left buttock, obtained illegally when he was sixteen.
"Can I see?" John whispered and Sherlock opened his eyes, blinking a few times to bring John into focus. "Please, Sherlock? Can I see you?"
Greg, choosing not to encourage Sherlock's obvious sulk, swiftly changed the subject. "I'll get this round. Pint okay for you, John? ...Sherlock, you want anything?"
"I'm doing it now, with you." John replied, giving his stokes a little twist at the end, swirling over the head of Sherlock's prick, using the wetness to his advantage. "Christ...you're like a broken faucet."
Sherlock's phone pinged beside him on the bed and he whined, groping in the unmade sheets for the device.  He fumbled at it, concentration slipping as John took his cock almost down his throat- but eventually managed to swipe the screen and read the message. Lestrade, about the case. Sherlock's vision sharpened as he scanned the new evidence and his cock, still in John's mouth, began to lag.
"Sherlock," His voice was calm, yet impeccably threatening. "It's just you and me now. Yeah?"
With all these thoughts entering his head, John snogged Shaun harder than he'd meant, desperately, and Shaun responded, moaning, already pressing his erection against him.
"And you'd let me take it off you afterward?" John asked, grinning. A couple (who looked as if they probably had at least two Rolls Royce's in the garage) walked past, glancing at him as they overhead his comment. Sherlock seemed completely unconcerned with passers-by.
Sherlock held him close and between his long, lean legs, hooking one of them across John’s back clumsily, “Prefer…sex?” he asked gauchely, voice vibrating against John’s lips.
," John murmured in concentration, while he probed very tenderly in the right direction, hooking his finger to graze the man's untouched prostate.
"Yeah...we were. – And…
"Used to what?" John mumbled against Sherlock's shoulder, his lips tickling and the sensation was so odd and arousing Sherlock filed it away for exploration later.
"If it's something you obviously love..." Sherlock murmured, sighing. "I want you to enjoy yourself...with me."
"John."
“…And now you’re interested in me?”
John laughed, pressing another kiss to Sherlock's sweaty temple before rolling off the bed and getting to his feet. "I'm sure you'll let me know eventually, love. Think you can manage enough to get in the shower with me?"
“I – yes. It’s not
Those few words almost did John in. He felt the frustratingly redundant throb of arousal between his own legs, his cock too spent to get hard again so soon, and groaned. "Sherlock, I want to be inside you," he admitted deliriously, before depressing the button on the toy and rubbing it shakily over Sherlock's tumescent shaft.
As soon as John turned around, Sherlock leaned down and kissed him.
It was surprising, really, how strong such a tender old lady could be. Sherlock was introduced to this strength, and the force that was Mrs Hudson in a huff. There was a rush of arms, splutters and robes before the detective was stumbling into the main hallway and the door to Mrs Hudson's flat left a residual echo in his ears as it was slammed shut.
John laughed heartily. "Still...frozen chick...you might've been able to make popsicles. Get something out of it. And hey, you can snowball with a bit of frigidity," he chuckled dirtily, hand clutched loosely on his pint glass, as a deafening roar consisting of simultaneous victorious yells and despondent groans as a result of a goal, sounded from the drunken inhabitants, making their ears ring.
"Let's not worry about that." Sherlock finally said. "You need to rest."
"Hmm? Oh, there was nothing on TV and I was bored. I didn't want to wake you so I thought I'd..." Sherlock trailed off, his eyes still fixed on the screen of the laptop, and John turned his head, wondering what held Sherlock's attention so much.
"Oh." Sherlock paused, audibly swallowed, then... "No. I- I quite like just...this."
was the one pushing people up against walls and grinding my cock against them
The door to John's bedroom softly swung open and a tall, wraith-like figure slipped inside, shutting the door behind it with a barely discernible click. On the bed, John made a sleepy sound of distress, throwing one arm outside his covers. The dark figure froze, its entire body stiffening. It silently watched John thrash on the bed before he settled, dropping back to sleep again.
Sherlock clambered inelegantly over his doctor to flop heavily at John's left side, and snuggled, cat-like, against John's damaged shoulder, placing a lengthy, wet smooch on the keloid scar there. "What are they saying?" he asked, his hand smoothing possessively over John's pectorals, fingertips twitching unconsciously against every fine hair and subcutaneous hard muscle.
John snickered, remembering the topic of conversation that had dropped moments before. He tried to pick up the last few strings of his sentence but the words failed him.
"Sherlock, don't be a dick. When have I ever given you that impression? I adore you- you of all people must realise that. Everybody else seems to realise it, and that was, let's see...barely 24 hours after we first met. So stop being ridiculous and realize that this-" John gestured agitatedly between them. "-isn't like anything else. I'm committed to you- for as long as you'll have me- and this is honestly the most important thing to me." He sighed, getting off the bed and flopping down onto the lilo, throwing his arm over his face and honestly, just ready to go to sleep.
"Thanks, Sherlock." He said. "I'll pay you back when I can, yeah?" He watched, curiously, as Sherlock pulled forth a large handful of goods from the bag, as unassumingly-small as Mary Poppins'.
The intensity of Sherlock's pale gaze, his sweet breath and his plump-firm lips were enough to make John groan, a lump in his throat and a stammer in his heartbeat. Forcing himself through it, he twisted Sherlock easily, manipulating his greater weight to the side, and then onto his back, kissing him ferociously hard as he mounted him.
Greg chuckled. "Says me. This isn't the first time we've done a case where Sherlock got himself all...well, you know." He gestured across the street and John looked at his boyfriend. Skin tight pants, a barely-there mesh top, his hair artfully tousled and a come-hither smile that had already had more than one car stopping to proposition him.
"Come on, love. Want to see you come. Come on, Sherlock."
Muffled footsteps, and a tentative knock on his door.
"Good. Don't." John said, reaching over to the bedside table and extracting the lube, handing it to Sherlock and biting his lip to keep from smiling at the way the taller man's hands shook slightly as he took it from him. Nervousness or arousal? John knew it was both. Sherlock taking John was rare- it was usually the other way round- and it was new and fascinating enough that Sherlock was still hesitant about it. "Get me ready." John said, unconcerned, lying back and propping his hands behind his head.
. Sherlock began to feel uncertain as his imagination offered him images of Shaun hearing the exact same phrases from John, receiving the exact same treatment. His own insecurities were, however, battling with the carnal, animalistic need to get off soon…and get off
“Untrue,” Sherlock replied, his feet touching John’s leg again as he shifted and yawned noisily. “I ask for things. Occasionally.”
They both jumped as the voices abruptly sounded closer, accompanied by animalistic, drunken laughs and yells:
"I want to see."
“You weren’t irritating me before now.”
He heard the mobile ding down the hall and waited impatiently for Molly's reply.
Sherlock bit his lip, mentally sighing.
John stopped squinting at the monitor which readout Sherlock's heart rate and glanced at him.
People passed by he and John on the busy sidewalk, not even glancing at them- for which Sherlock was thankful. He clutched the weighty shopping bag tightly- and prudently- in front of his crotch, hoping no one noticed the bulge in the front of his tailored trousers and wondering how he felt about it if they did.
"I'm only human," John shrugged, kneading them firmly, smoothing his palms up and around them, squeezing spontaneously. "The most
"I said nothing at all. I said he should get checked out. If he wants to jump to the worst conclusions, that's his problem. Besides, he deserves it for being a dick," Sherlock finished succinctly, shrugging calmly before leaning down and pecking John on the lips. John kissed him back, grinning from ear to ear.
idea what it was like today? For me? Do you even
"I know, I know." John breathed, eyes shutting at the much-needed pressure. "It's okay. Just...put lube on your cock. All right?"
"What're you talking about?" John asked, following after Sherlock, the invitation still clutched in his hand. "This?" He brandished the card. "Because you're right- I can't help but be amused at the thought of you in a roomful of stuffy, arrogant, overbred people, deducing everyone to within an inch of their lives and making them all uncomfortable."
"...Hepatocytes...remarkably intact...extraordinary density and ..."
"Beautiful." John breathed, scooting closer to Sherlock and bending his head, pressing a sucking kiss to the center of his chest.
“Ah ah, I’ve told you before,” the detective reprimanded breathlessly, batting John’s damp left hand away from his untouched shaft, and pushing it back against the sheets by John’s head, mirroring its partner. He gave it a brief, affectionate squeeze, rolling his thumb over the ring on his finger.
John blew out a long breath, and was distantly tickled to see the skin of Sherlock's back twitch and goosebump in response, "Right...
"Nnh…"
Sherlock's eyes squeezed shut and his teeth bared, his head thrown back once more as he seethed out a deep, sticky moan.
John felt his heart begin to palpitate, skipping beats, just as it sank like a rock to the bottom of his stomach It couldn't be. No. It couldn't be. Please. Trembling, he stuttered to explain, praying, hoping against hope. "He's...he's tall...He's...where is he?"
John took one very long, deep, fortifying breath, exhaling slowly. "...We're...all out of batteries...fuck, why am I having this conversation," he murmured, releasing a familiar long-suffering sigh.
He let John freely roam over his body, hands skimming lightly over his skin, mouth following right after. He gasped, spine arching, when John brushed a finger over his nipple, pleasure fizzing through his body.
"No..it was...fine," he said, body jittery as it came down from his orgasm and John's teasing. "As long as you enjoyed it," The detective heaved, his pale chest punishing itself with gasping breaths, the milk-white skin covering his troubled lungs jewelled with warm sweat.
When John quirked his eyebrow questioningly, Sherlock hastened to elaborate.
been holding out on us," he grinned, very gently nestling a few fingers in the warm auburn curls between his legs.
to understand what's happening here," John tried, hoping he didn't sound as condescending as he thought he did.
- can't control yourself." He loosened his grip, his thumb brushing possessively over the soft ridge of Sherlock's cock through the fabric. "Do you think I'm inadequate when you make me come?"
“O-oh,” came the feeble, wide-eyed response.
." Sherlock twisted even more frantically against the bed. "I need to come."
Slowly, as the aftershocks of his orgasm faded, leaving his body a bit weak-kneed and trembly, John let out one long, shaky, satisfied sigh and opened his eyes. He started to wash away the evidence of his morning wank- only to suddenly become aware of the extra person in the room and start violently, his heart lurching in his chest.
"Please?" John asked, a competing thrill of amusement and admiration in his dark-blue eyes. "Tell me more. You're doing well so far," he rewarded, reaching down and giving Sherlock a few languid, strong strokes.
"There." John's hands trickled up Sherlock's sides, tickling, a barely-there caress that made Sherlock shiver.
John sighed at the sound of the door banging shut and shrugged on a slightly crumpled dark blue shirt and black jeans. He crouched to look in the fingerprinted mirror on the dresser and ran his fingers through his hair which was drying into short spikes. He gave it a cursory judgement, shaking his head. It'd have to do for now. Grabbing his wallet and phone, he leaned against the wall outside the bathroom, and waited.
"It's ok, Sherlock. I'm never going anywhere...I'll always be right here. I promise. I love you."
"Ugh, I'm tired of contesting this with you," Sherlock muttered acidly. He was fed up of discussing the issue with someone who knew
!’” he added in a sarcastic, simpering voice.
, Sherlock - calm down and shut up for a second," John tutted, though he acquiesced and eased off Sherlock's lap to sit beside him, one hand on his warm thigh. "
Sherlock stared at John through his eyelashes, his delicate but strong hands still fingering his violin.
It didn't seem possible, what John had done. And yet…there was the proof, incontrovertible, in front of his very eyes.
The resulting, stuttered noise was a pleasure to hear, as was the sumptuous sight of the grind of Shaun's hips. The brunette braced himself strongly against the slightly gritty floor, his palms and knees burning with the sheer effort of holding his weight against the onslaught, as John roughly added another finger.
It took John a few seconds to compute, and then he smiled foolishly as he unpicked the buttons of his maroon shirt, soon easing it from his shoulders, subtly angling himself in such a way to prevent Sherlock getting an eyeful of the raised, white-pink scar on his left side.
person. Like...in the movies."
Jason blinked rapidly, visibly angry and stunned his face suffused with colour, lips thinned down and white. When he spoke, it was through tightly gritted teeth. "You...you fucking...you fucking don't know
"Mm...well, thanks for
"The roof?" Mrs. Hudson gasped when she took in the state of John's room, tsking over the mess and peering up at the ceiling, through which the stormy clouds over the city could be seen.
"I'm not leaving you." John promised, kissing Sherlock a bit sloppily as they were both panting, far gone and dazed with pleasure. "I'm not leaving you. I wouldn't leave you...Haven't you been listening to me? I- Christ...I love you so much." John reached down between them and fisted Sherlock's cock, thrusting shallowly into his body, urging him to come, his own orgasm not far off. "I won't leave you. Ever. I won't…I love you...just you. Just as you are. Even when you're being a dick and we're fighting- actually fighting and angry at each other- even then, I love you with all my heart."
He listened to John pause in the front room and irritably turn the TV off. Sometimes Sherlock liked to have it on in the background, just for the white noise in the flat. When John had noticed the habit, he had said something confusing about lonely puppies, and moaned about the electricity bill, but hadn’t told him to stop doing it.
"Only if it's
"It's '
Perhaps he'd pushed John too far this time, Sherlock thought as he took a deep breath, glancing up at John's stony face, before licking his lips again and leaning forward, taking the tip of John's cock in his mouth.
Sherlock was studiously ignoring Mrs.Hudson as she chided him somewhere in the distance with her predictable, motherly mix of weary irritation and secret adoration.
"I'm-" John swallowed thickly and tried to form words again, his warm, damp mouth smearing Sherlock's cheekbone as he whispered harshly. "I'm going to make this the last thing I say for now - do you want to see this through? I can stop if you want. I promise."
"...Sorry?" John parroted woozily, both his hands anchoring him to Sherlock in the pitch blackness, thumbing repeatedly at the corners of his plump mouth, across his eyebrows, and into his warm hairline. "Why?"
“Quite sure,” Sherlock replied with a condescending, fleeting smile, and swatted it aside roughly before glancing at the time on his phone, grimacing as another firework went off. He stood fluidly and paced before the fireplace. He was like a distressed animal, his hackles raised and his eyes narrowed.
"Nothing you need to worry about." He said dismissively, reaching for Sherlock's trousers. "Take those off. If you're a very, very good boy, I'll jerk you off while I'm fucking you."
“Marry me.”
Sherlock leaned up with a small chuckle and there was a moment of stillness before the room was bathed in the light from his lamp again, highlighting and illuminating Sherlock’s flushed face and wet mouth. He arched his eyebrow at John questioningly and ran his eager gaze down John’s body, lifting from him to get a full view of everything. With Sherlock pulled away, John was able to see the blotchy blush of arousal that painted Sherlock’s face, neck and chest, as well as the bunching and flexing of his abdominal muscles, shaking arms, and the obvious, protruding bulge of his confined erection.
He grinned at his wrecked and trembling detective. "How often do you use this? And…" John paused to clear his throat and his distracted thoughts, highly aroused and wishing he could get hard again. "…do you…always use it in bed?" John couldn't help his imagination furnishing him with delicious, vibrant pictures of Sherlock fucking himself all over the flat when desperation seized him.
"Everything alright?" he asked after watched Greg's face crease in concentration as he tapped something out on his sleek device.
“I know you well enough. I know you don’t mind.”
"S'okay...carry on," Sherlock uttered in a consoling, if distant, tone, back arching as the tip of John's finger slipped into his body, wincing. He writhed, body burning at the intrusion, trying to relax.
Sherlock frowned, groaning deep and resonating, too lost to the sensations to hear anything outside his own clawing want for pleasure and release. It was only when Mrs Hudson began happily humming a festive melody, as she opened up her own flat, that Sherlock heard her, and he froze in place, clamping around John with a firm, twitching heat.
“Oh, could have fooled me.”
Lestrade starts with the flutes, which Sherlock hates. They sound thin and screechy, but at least there aren't any piccolos today. They also hear two struggling oboists and Sherlock hates them even more.
Their walk to the doctor’s lounge is silent, and they stay silent until Stamford presses a dingy mug of tea into John’s hand.
Sherlock’s gut twists. That was an old legend. There was no scientific proof, surely? Even partial colour blindness was a medical condition and had nothing to do with one’s soulmate. That would be the worst. To be saddled with the person meant for you and not even receive the benefit of full colour vision. Horrid.
John’s rhythm falters and grows erratic. He’s close. Sherlock can feel it even though he’s never seen anything like this before. He keeps pressing forward, moving his hand up and down John’s length and using the pad of his thumb to rub against the underside of the head of his cock on each stroke.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow but did as he was told. He grasped the stone railing and bent to present his arse as a prize.
It’s not quite a question but not quite a statement either. It is as uncertain as Sherlock feels.
His flat on Montague Street is dingy and dark but he can pay the rent with his private clients and that’s all that matters. He’s given up the drugs but he does still suck back cigarettes a few packs at a time. Lestrade only seems to mind that during the few days a month when he himself tries to quit smoking.
“John, is this a date night?”
“I did.” Sherlock pulls on his giant coat and seems unfazed by the coolness in John’s voice. “Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn’t that difficult a leap.”
“No. No, this is fine.” Sherlock’s voice cracks a bit but he licks his lips and keeps going. His hands come up to grasp at John’s forearms but not to pull him away. “We don’t need to go slower. I’ll be quiet.”
Sherlock is so happy he barely hears John’s “Soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out.” It’s the breathy “oh” at the end that catches his attention. He replays the last few seconds in his mind and what John is saying becomes clear.
The first section rehearsal goes shockingly well. It’s just the violins in the morning, then they get to take a few hours off while the violas and cellos rehearse on their own. They come together in the afternoon, along with the contrabass.
“She settled for you fast enough.” There’s no censure or shame in John’s voice. Just awe.
His arms were outstretched when he stepped off the edge and he didn’t feel afraid. Not until he lost sight of John. Those scant seconds when Sherlock could no longer see John, face twisted in sorrow and rage, but before he hit the airbag and the plan carried on were the most terrifying of his life. He was adrift with no one to anchor him. Then that panic passed and everything was a rush of well-timed, frantic movement.
“Come on, Dr. Watson. The game is on!”
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, doesn’t bring it to the attention of his medical staff, until Mycroft appears. It’s too good a jab to keep to himself. Mycroft had found his soulmate just after uni. Claire is strong and fierce and, on the whole, Sherlock likes her much better than he likes Mycroft. They make a good team but Sherlock can tell they each feel burdened, weighed down, by the other. Like they value what they have built together but wonder what they could have done on their own.
“Here.” John slides a warm cup of tea into Sherlock’s hand. Something dark and strong and much prefered to the untouched chamomile from the night before. Rosie sits on John’s hip, shoving a handful of sticky cereal bits into her mouth.
“That’s settled then?” John asked.
They sit quietly for a few moments and Sherlock finds ‘John’s’ presence infinitely less boring than being alone. But quiet contemplating, even with excellent company, isn’t what he came here for.
“We’ve gone slowly enough.” He pumps his hips, letting his body do what it has wanted to do since he and John took of their clothes together and got into bed.
Mycroft is silent for several minutes but the ride to Montague Street is not a long one and Sherlock did not expect him to remain silent for the duration.
It’s darker up here and the steam hangs around their heads. Sherlock insinuates himself next to the man. ‘John’ is taking up the corner, his shoulders each resting on a different wall. Sherlock’s hip presses against ‘John’s’ thigh.
The subtle crunch of gravel under the saloon car’s tyres shakes Sherlock from his thoughts. They’ve arrived at Montague Street and Sherlock pulls himself from the car without a look or word to Mycroft sitting next to him.
“There is nothing wrong, but there is.” Sherlock spoke for the first time since muttering ‘John’. John looked up from the remainder of the sutures he had used to stitch up his head. He looked relieved, but also concerned or angry. Sherlock still couldn’t tell the difference between the two emotions.
John had had an uneventful day. Eight hours at the practice dealing with a combination of the sniffles, a broken arm and a few bouts of gastro. He had picked up milk, bread and tea bags on his way home from Tesco, because to be honest that’s all that Sherlock ate. He had just settled into his chair with a hot cup of tea when the flat door opened.
“No, I don’t think that it would be wise given the situation.” John really had no idea what had happened, but he had a niggling sensation that told him that this was nothing to do with blood glucose levels, heart, oxygen or any other medical variants.
“What is all that banging? Has Sherlo-” her voice cut out looking between the body slumped on the floor and John’s face, clearly processing what she was looking at.
“Should I call an ambulance?”
Thanks for reading this piece. Sorry for the delay again, please leave kudos if you enjoyed it and comments on improvements or anything you wish. I may write an epilogue but I'm really happy with how it's finished.
“Good case?” John asked not even turning around. Sherlock had spoke this morning of a ‘9’ before bounding out the flat at half-six. He had been full of life and ready to catch a killer. A good half a minute passed and there was no response. John turned his head, taking in the site of Sherlock. He looked weird, he was as pale as always, dressed the same way he left this morning. Everything looked right, except it didn’t. His hands were fidgeting, which happens only when he is frustrated with a challengeor the lack of a case. But he looked calm, well not calm, but almost scary relaxed. The only major issue that he could tell was the fact he wasn’t talking.
It still took John a moment to notice the consequences of letting his friend fall to the ground so quickly. Completely taken aback by the word his friend had muttered he watched his friend lie on the ground, still and knocked out. If Mrs Hudson hadn’t come into the room, he probably would have continued to stare long after.
It felt like an eternity, before suddenly things began to return to normal. Sherlock looked up, finding his voice and now understanding exactly what had happened, yet still not knowing why. The physicality’s of the situation has sunk in and he knew there was nothing physically wrong. Nothing to suggest sickness or injury apart from the obvious implications of the fall.
John approached Sherlock carefully, noting the pooling blood leaving his head and nose. His jacket had cascaded around his body and his feet were angling outwards, with his left knee slightly inclined. It did not look comfortable and John knew the first thing he should do is to check for response. So, he carefully crouched down next to his friend, checking for any sign that his friend would return to consciousness. John’s hands moved over Sherlock as he spoke.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey, Sherlock? You okay?” John questioned hoping this was a cruel prank, and not something serious. But the shaking and sweat continued, along with the fidgeting which had developed into complicated finger movements almost like he was plucking the strings on a violin. John stood up and at this point was looking to Sherlock's face. They were glistening, pools of water had started to form and stream from his blue eyes. John didn’t know what to do.
“There is so many emotions, I feel run down, but nothing happened today. Everything just stopped and won’t start. I don’t even know why I’m CRYING!” Sherlock’s voice had quickly turned from shaky and jittery and scared, to scared and angry. He didn’t know what was happening. He couldn’t place any of it. His raw emotions were ripping at the seems and he had no placement for it. A hand was in his hair, John’s can caressing and calming. His eyes were solemn, wondering, asking for him to speak. Sherlock wanted to give answers, but he didn’t know what to do.
“Come on Sherlock, up you get.” John spoke again, the voice increasing only slightly in volume. It was torturous, like someone slowly connecting the sound cable and he was only getting distortions of it. Arms were linked under his body, and he was slowly dragged down the hallway to his bed. A combination of strength and very careful movement slowly got Sherlock onto his bed. A pillow under his head, and a duvet surrounding his body, the shaking was starting to decrease. There was no reason for this. No reason at all, yet it was happening. John continued to clean and talk, some things entering his brain others cutting out. The very lopsided conversation had been mostly about injuries. Asking him how he was feeling. What he gathered was he had broken his nose on impact, had a possible concussion and somehow had split his head. It was small but deep which is why there was a lot of blood.
Sherlock attempted to roll onto his stomach, so he could push himself off the ground. But warm calloused hands pushed him back on his side. Warm hands had reminded him how cold he was, yet his face was still flushed with a heat like the Sahara Desert. Sherlock attempted to open his eyes, there was red liquid pooling in the dip near where his left tear duct met his nose. The redness distorted the image, but he could see a doctor, his doctor staring down. He looked worried, or angry and he was talking, but there was so sound. It was like someone had rearranged the wires and chosen to plug the video cable in only. Barely an image, with no sound. He wanted to hear the words that his friend was muttering, but he couldn’t hear anything. He was scared, scared and fearful and angry and emotional. “Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock” Mycroft echoed in his mind, this wasn’t caring was it? His body was shutting down and all he could think about was Mycroft.
“They called you a freak again, didn’t they?” John said, seeking answers with his face. And it all clicked.
“What did you do to him????” Her voice had gone high pitched, annoyed and angry, she sounded very angry. John was still slightly taken aback about what had happened that he nearly didn’t answer.
“They called you a freak again, didn’t they?” John spoke softly. And almost immediately a choked cry and sob could be heard from the detective.
John’s mind was wondering as he tended to his friend. Wondering how this happened and why. And at that moment he received a text from Greg. A text that pieced together everything for him. It wasn’t often that John picked up and was able to deduce something, but Sherlock’s wellbeing was one of his specialities and it all made sense.
Okay so this might actually be a bit longer than I thought., I'm really enjoying writing this.
“I feel lost, my mind is a shamble. I can’t differentiate between emotions, yet I feel all of them. I can’t figure out what I want, but I know what I want. I ca-can’t… John… I can’t.” John for once felt he had a good idea of what was happening, why his friend had shut down. He had only seen it once before, but a lot milder. John could tell Sherlock was trying to use the right words but couldn’t grasp his usual on distinct grasp of dialogue.
“I-I-I didn’t do anything.” John completed and by finally speaking he was kicked into gear.
“Sherlock snap out of it. What's going on?” John went to walk forward but stopped, he could see the body in front of him start to sway. He knew what was coming next, but didn’t have time to act, when one word caught him off guard.
His head was banging, he could feel a pool of liquid drenching his face and black curls. He was on his side and could feel sickness deep in his stomach begin to rise. His body was still shaking, was he sick? His nose was pained, and his forehead felt like a bowling ball. What had happened? Excessive questioning without being able to deduce was a worrying sign of his own bodies failings. Had his transport just given up? Usually he could tell before it was close to throwing in the towel. But this felt different, very different.
“I don’t know. I feel…” Sherlock started, John could see him struggle for words.
“Sherlock, can you hear me?” Still no response came, but his eyes were dilating. He could see the rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest increase along with the heart rate.
“I don’t know. I feel…” Sherlock didn’t like sharing, never did, but he needed help. He didn’t know how to fix this.
He stood shaking, unknown to the fear, sadness and emotion that coursed through his body. He didn’t understand it. What was this? Why did everything feel bad? Why was he suddenly more disconnected from life than usual? Why had this happened? He couldn’t process it. His mind a shamble. So he stood in the doorway to his flat, their flat and shook, feeling lightheaded and dizzy to his surroundings, everything was a blur. But none of it made sense. Why did he feel so lost? Why had his brain gone numb and how does he fix it?
Sorry for the delay in the final chapter, I'm a full time uni student and I'm supposed to be writing 1500 words on the pathophysiology of a motorcycle accident not 1500 words on Sherlock and John's friendship. Oh well. This chapter is basically the size of the last 3 chapters, but a good amount fun to write.
It soothes John though. “Good. That’s good. Maybe she’ll sleep now.”
Before Sherlock can answer, a quiet, almost mousey woman comes into the lab to bring him coffee. Sherlock is unbearably rude to her and ordinarily John would be appalled by his manners. But, just this once, John rejoices in it. There’s a steady beat of
John moans as Sherlock’s thumb rolls over the tip of John’s cock. He plays there for a moment, rubbing his fingertips through the slick leaking from John’s slit. He might get a bit lost there for a few moments because John rocks his hips to encourage Sherlock to stroke again.
Sherlock looks back to the ground, pavement again now, and heaves. He spits to clear the taste of imaginary bile from his mouth. When he looks back, Lestrade is no longer talking but he looks concerned. Very concerned. Even Donovan has stopped whatever it is she does at these things to lean over him with a sour look on her face.
John’s breathing settles. Sherlock listens to it grow deeper, more even. There’s something that has been niggling at the back of Sherlock’s mind since Eurus and Musgrave. It was a seed that, once germinated, could not be ignored.
“I can feel it too.”
There’s a short back and forth between Mike and Sherlock. John’s concentrating all his ability on not staring at this man. He feels like a voyeur - suddenly confronted with the life he might have had and watching it greedily from the sidelines.
John thrust hard and then stopped. He sat, fully seated in Sherlock’s arse, and held Sherlock’s hips to keep him still. “Come on now, put that brilliant brain to use.” He ground his hips forward and Sherlock moaned. “Beg me better.”
There’s a hint of dull grey light coming through the curtains. It’s near dawn and John will be awake soon. He can wait until then. Their mugs of chamomile sit untouched on the coffee table in front of him.
He washes, careful to keep his sleeves dry but still scrub all the way up to his elbows. John comes to stand behind him and wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist and rests his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. They stand for a quiet moment and Sherlock is struck by his own future, stretched out before him as obvious to him as a criminal’s bloody footprints tracking across London.
, he thinks and starts a mental list of things he wants to do.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathes out. He arches into John’s hands. “This is good.”
Sherlock launched himself at John’s half undone flies. His mouth met the tempting strip of skin just above John’s waistband where his shirt had ridden up, where it always rides up. He pressed hot, wet lips and tongue there until his shaking hands pulled John’s cock free.
“You are a child.” Mycroft’s voice is hard when he finally breaks the chilly silence. “You have no idea what you’re talking about. You think you prefer to be alone simply because you’ve had no other option presented to you. But now you have the option. Even if you don’t know who it is, you will long for him. You will want to call out to him, to find him, and you will be unable to do so. It will drive you mad.”
“It’s Anderson.”
“Afghanistan. Sorry, do you know…?” John lets that question trail off.
“We really should stop.”
John leans back a fraction of an inch as Sherlock sways forward. “Are you off the drugs then?”
He’s angry. He can’t help but be angry. This was not the future John had envisioned for himself. He saw someone nice, someone sweet, or no one at all. But never a disaster. Even if it was a gorgeous disaster he felt the pull of even before their skin had touched.
The hospital staff, nurses and at least one doctor, come and go but no one seems to acknowledge the change in Sherlock. Maybe it wasn’t here. Maybe it was in the squat, or in the street before he was picked up by the paramedics.
“You look at me like you can see me. See the details present in colour.”
“What about the colours?” The anger seems to have left John entirely and he gazes up at Sherlock in...admiration? It seems such a foreign concept that Sherlock shakes it off immediately.
How Sherlock knew those things about him seemed much less important than the unanswered question hanging thickly in the air between them.
John eased open the door. The hinges were so well oiled they didn’t so much as squeak. The staircase beyond was dark and covered in cobwebs. He pushed his way through them as he ascended. John went higher and higher until he was able to step to the side onto a small ledge adjacent to the tightly twisting stairs.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up. “Oh good, you’ll have plenty of time to recover after I do whatever I want to you for my birthday. It’s your gift to me, you know.”
“Yes, yes. That’s all fine.”
The DS recovers rather more quickly than Sherlock would have guessed. “We’re here to talk about your transgressions, not mine.”
“She likes to hear you talk.”
It’s disorienting that when it all comes bubbling to the surface it’s in the middle of the morning and he’s in front of Lestrade’s team at a crime scene.
Sherlock leaps from the couch, sloshing hot tea across his wrist. A thought from the night before strikes him. “We need to switch bedrooms.”
“Be careful.”
John’s mouth, on the other hand, is doing quite a lot. It’s searing kisses across Sherlock’s shoulders, up the side of his neck, all the way to the hinge of his jaw and the shell of his ear. John starts slow but those kisses quickly escalate until Sherlock is panting and pressing his back and ass tight against John’s body.
“I won’t sleep tonight anyway.”
“I know you’re an Army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him, possibly because he’s an alcoholic. More likely because he recently walked out on his soulmate. And I know your therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic. Quite correctly, I’m afraid.”
“The power, Captain. You like seeing people with power stripped of it. And you like seeing what the weak do when they have that power for themselves. You like the game of turning things on their heads.”
John can easily believe that. Just this tiny glimpse of Sherlock as he is now convinces him of that.
Lestrade pointedly clears his throat and John lets go, but the slow slide of his fingertips through Sherlock’s curls feels like a promise. It makes Sherlock shiver.
It’s stark and lonely and makes John feel small. It’s his penance for leaving Sherlock alone in a hospital in London, where he looked lonely and small against the stark white of the bed linens. John uses his nighttime patrols to think about what could have been, if Sherlock hadn’t been a junkie. Or if John had stayed. If he had stayed, what would they have become?
Their shared chemistry lecture is long over and Victor is preparing to graduate and move on. He’s doing the washing up after convincing Sherlock to eat just a little bit of his grandmother’s famous curry chicken (
Lestrade texts Sherlock multiple times leading up to the woodwind auditions on Friday. The man barely lets Sherlock out of his sight even though it’s been ages since Sherlock’s had a relapse. If Lestrade really wanted to make sure Sherlock was kept occupied, he’d make sure the orchestra played something more complicated than their current line up. Music occupied his mind and his mind was best when occupied.
John gets all that from Holmes’s chart. That’s all the information he generally wants or needs about a patient. But he wants to know what makes Sherlock laugh, what his favorite food is, if he’s ever seen
John pushed in and stopped just short of hitting the back of Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock closed his eyes and relaxed as John fucked his mouth. He curled one hand around John’s denim-clad thigh and pressed the flat of his other hand against his own erection. John thrust deep, using both his own hips and his grip on Sherlock’s hair to bring them together. The rough edges of John’s open flies dragged across Sherlock’s cheeks and Sherlock’s cock throbbed.
Waiting the rest of the week does not go well. Inactivity grates at Sherlock’s nerves with the tenacity of a terrier. It grows to a point where he can’t escape it even with music. Not with the drech he’ll be playing for the Christmas gala or the pieces he’s been working on on his own. Not even with composing.
“What do you want?”
John’s never had a friend like that. He has fun with the rugby lads and chats with girls who sit behind him in biology but he doesn’t have a single friend closer than any other. He doesn’t mind. He prefers it that way really. John likes having people around, people who like him, but no one that gets close enough to hurt him. His heart is big and kind, but he’s not foolish. Even the smallest hurts wound him deeper than they do his peers. He protects himself not by growing bitter but by keeping space between himself and others.
Auditions did not occupy his mind; they bored him. Lestrade’s orchestra was third rate at best and barely paid its musicians a living wage. They attracted the talent one would expect with that reputation. Unless Lestrade found a talented junkie, like Sherlock, or a moderately-talented but self-conscious musician, like Molly, auditions were likely to be excruciating.
“Yes, if you want me to. I’ll stay.”
Now that they’re looking at each other, the darkness doesn’t hide a lot.
“You can’t have serial suicides.”
“My name really is John, though.”
The vestibule was dark and cold. January was terrible time for a festival but that was probably why the ruling class let undesirables have this time as their own. He made his way down a long aisle to a side chapel to light a candle at the altar of Saint Sebastian. The wan winter light shone through the rose window, casting prisms of colour across the floor.
John stepped back. Sherlock looked a mess. His breeches were come stained, but at least he hadn’t dirtied his boots this year, his face was flushed, and his hair stood nearly on end. John smiled with all the fondness he felt spark to life in his chest.
Instead, John reaches out and rests his fingertips just above the waistband of Sherlock’s boxer briefs. “Do you touch yourself, Sherlock?”
“You asked the questions.”
There had been times when Sherlock was sure they were moving this direction, before Mary and after. Sometimes that surety is met with joy, other times with fear. This is never how he imagined it. In Sherlock’s imagined scenarios, it is never a slow, warm realization in a domestic moment. It’s fueled by adrenaline or the threat of loss. Never by comfort and affection.
John’s rhythm is slow and steady. Sherlock is probably breathing faster than John is moving his forearm back and forth. John curls his fingers as he slides deep and Sherlock’s hips jerk. John doesn’t try to stop him. He just lets Sherlock’s straining cock fuck the air.
“Yes.”
He’s been on so many cases without John. There were cases before John, adventures while Sherlock was “dead”, and cases taken while John was on the other side of London. But it gets harder and harder to leave him behind.
“Did this happen here?”
John watches him for a moment, maybe considering extending his own hand but thinking better of it.
“Well, after a suitable probationary period, I should think so.”
John pulls back, but just his enough to free his mouth from Sherlock’s. “We should probably take this slow.”
Their necks are twisted at an odd angle, and Rosie is still asleep on Sherlock’s chest, so he can’t turn to kiss John more fully.
John did drift off to sleep them. In that three-quarters-asleep phase right before going over the edge, John straightened his arm so that Sherlock’s hand cupped his elbow and John’s palm rested against Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock flops back down on the bed. “Hm, no.”
Sherlock is right. John rousts just a few moments later. Sherlock had held himself as still as possible, not wanting John to pull away.
It’s not late, not compared to some of their previous investigations, but the work is slow going. The hazardous materials and dangerous bits have been cleared away. All that’s left is to  pick their way through the detritus of Baker Street piece by piece. Sherlock had pictured the clean up as a tedious but necessary step in getting his home, his office, his haven back in working order. He hadn’t foreseen the need to evaluate every item of mismatched Bohemian decor he’d surrounded himself with. He has to weigh the damage against future utility one trinket at a time.
“You know him. You knew who he was.”
The answer pings back almost instantly.
Sherlock didn’t realize it until he’d said it, but it’s definitely a “he”. Sherlock can feel it in his gut and in his heart as true as the laws of physics. He musters as much dignity as he can. “Just a feeling.” He can’t help but snort as he says it.
“How are you holding up?”
Mike plants his hands on the lab table in front of him and his smile finally fades. “I knew. And I know why you ran, John. Really, I understand it. But he’s not that man anymore. He’s… well, he’s extraordinary.”
It happens slowly. So slowly that Sherlock has enough time to record everything so he can replay every millisecond of it exactly in his mind palace forever. He knows the exact moment when John’s eyes slip shut. He can savor the sight of the slow drag of John’s tongue across his own lips before their mouths come together. He can feel the miniscule increases in pressure as John’s fingers squeeze his thigh.
“Four serial suicides.”
Until he notices the reflection of police lights in the sitting room windows. He presses a quick kiss to John’s forehead and retreats to the window.
Sherlock steps forward and gently takes Rosie from John’s arm. “Here. Take a break.”
After eight months of splitting their time between John’s flat share and Jeanette’s cramped place in Shoreditch, they moved in together. John was slow to unpack and Jeanette teased him about planning to move right back out again. He was just busy and he’d rather spend his time cooking dinner with Jeanette, making love to Jeanette, or exploring their new neighborhood with Jeanette than unpacking dusty paperback crime novels he couldn’t quite bring himself to get rid of. He wanted to do everything with Jeanette and a thorough unpacking wasn’t high on his list of couple’s activities. He thought he had plenty of time to sort his things and settle in.
***************
John’s giggle bubbles out as they leave the darkened auditorium and it sounds like music.
Sherlock wasn’t inhibited by it. He could work just fine with that burned out section of his vision still in place. They’d chalked it up to some traumas never leaving a man completely and gone on as they were.
“Bit of trouble too, I bet.”
Sherlock leaned forward so that his lips barely brushed John’s ear. “You like to fuck your fellow soldiers. You like to fuck your commanding officers and be fucked by your infantrymen. You give power to those who do not have it over you, and you take it from the men who do.” His teeth caught John’s skin. “You turn things topsy turvy when you fuck them.”
When he comes back to himself, John is covering him and rutting against him. He breathes heavily in Sherlock’s ear with great sobs and moans. Sherlock is oversensitive and it feels like too much, but he’s not going to let John go now. He manages to wrap his arms around John to bring them closer together. The sweat and come between them ease the way and John thrusts and grinds against the still quivering muscles of Sherlock’s stomach.
No, not blank out. Not like the tunnel vision that comes before passing out, or the sudden darkness that happens when you’re knocked out. His vision is going grey. It starts around the edges. The blue of the London sky fades to a washed out shade of grey. Lestrade’s salt-and-pepper hair blends into the background. The greyness creeps ever closer to the center of Sherlock’s vision until he thinks he will pass out. Not from any physical cause but from the panic clawing up his throat. He can’t lose his colour vision. He’ll have nothing. No career as a consulting detective, no soulmate, nothing.
Panic wells in Sherlock’s chest. This is overwhelming. John must see it in his eyes, or feel just as overwhelmed and unready for that conversation, because he lets the truth of their bond pass without comment. “Have you seen a doctor?”
“Make me come.”
Sherlock blocked out the splashing and the groaning, along with the unimaginative composition back on his music stand in Baker Street. His mind played over Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto in D major instead. Something technically interesting but that he had mastered long ago. It was as relaxing to his mind as the water was to his body. His fingers tapped out the fingerings against the side of the pool.
Sherlock tucks back into the bathroom to change into pajama pants and a tee shirt, new ones that Mycroft had sent over, while John strips down to his shorts and vest. He hasn’t had time to pick up a new dressing gown but wishes he had one to wrap around himself like armour.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice cracked. “You’re everything.”
“You’ve come to look down on the city?”
But the time Lestrade calls for the clarinets, Sherlock would kill a man for a cigarette.
“Stop this Sherlock.”
Mike chimes back in before Sherlock can reach John. “It’s an old friend of mine, John Watson.”
“She still asleep?”
For the first time, Sherlock considers that maybe John is as affected by this as he is. He had assumed that he would be the one more likely to lose control, to be lost in sensation. The basis for his assumption is sound: John has more experience with physical relationships. And it’s very likely, Sherlock fears, that his feelings for John outweigh John’s for him. Surely the lack of exposure to physical stimulus of a sexual nature with another person combined with the depth of Sherlock’s feelings would have made him the weaker party?
Sherlock grins and hates himself for how quickly he vascilates between anger and hurt to wanting John’s approval and affection. It’s that pulling sensation in his chest again, and it feels entirely beyond his control. “What did you think?”
Rosie has been sick for days and John is about to snap. Sherlock can see it in the lines on his brow and the tension in his shoulders.
She has fallen asleep, Sherlock realizes. It’s not a deep or restful sleep. She’s not making any of the small huffing noises she does when she’s truly out for the night, but she’s definitely unconscious. She can rest now. It’s enough to make Sherlock giddy.
It’s as close to an apology as he will get. Or that he wants, really.
His laugh was deep and rumbled through John all the way to his cock. John almost forgot what not being a priest but living in the cathedral must mean.
“Okay, look up. I’m on the rooftop.”
Sherlock likes that more than he’d ever admit.
It only takes one long, sweeping look over Mycroft to find the source of his unusual irritation: trimmed nails, slight stain on his shirt cuff, tie crooked, slight stubble on his chin.
“How do you feel about the violin?” Sherlock directs that question to John as John watches the woman slink out of the room in embarrassment.
Lord, he was beautiful. Skin so pale it must never see the sun, a halo of dark curls atop his head that blew in the wind, and a fine and delicate profile.
There’s a pang of hurt in John’s gut at that but swiftly followed by
He can’t breath. It feels as if his ribs have been ripped away from his sternum, like he’s bleeding out into the sand- no, it’s concrete. It’s the pavement on the London street - not sand. But that’s what he sees when he looks down. And the ground is not nearly as far away as he thought it should be.
It’s not long before ‘John’ stiffens. Come shoots out across Sherlock’s knuckles on his last upstroke and his glides back down to the root of ‘John’s’ cock, spreading the mess with him. He’s reluctant to let go, but loosens his fingers so the softening weight of ‘John’s’ cock rests in his hand.
John flounders a bit. “So this is all…”
“Seen a lot of injuries then, violent deaths.” He’s turned into John’s personal space so they are standing toe-to-toe now, Lestrade’s presence fading from their minds.
Victor graduates with a first and leaves. Sherlock doesn’t bother to remember where he goes or keep in touch. After Victor is gone, that dark, empty space in his chest grows and grows until it feels like he’s nothing but the void itself. There’s plenty of skin-to-skin contact after that, mostly the slide of one palm across another as he buys drugs on street corners, but none of that matters. He’s alone and always will be.
, John thinks, as Sherlock’s blue eyes float before his vision. All of a sudden he mourns the time he didn’t have with his soulmate. It’s not even about dying. It’s about dying without knowing.
Even through the phone, it was heartbreaking. Sherlock pushed on because he had no other choice. His tongue was heavy and the lies fell from it like lead balls.
“Well, you have to play it. We’ve already announced it as debuting at our Christmas gala.” Lestrade hoisted himself from the chair and stood in front of the cold hearth.
“Come on, love. You can do it.” John’s fingers move faster but not fast enough. Sherlock wants it hard and fast but he also wants it deep and still and he’s torn. He grinds down on John’s hand as best he can on each thrust, and John lets him hang there for just a moment before pulling back. But it needs to be faster too. He can’t have it both ways but he still wants.
Sherlock doesn’t respond. There’s no need to.
Sherlock’s brain stalled at that. Rosie never stayed without them, unless she wanted to stay with Mrs. Hudson which hardly counted or they were overnighting somewhere for a case. There wasn’t an urgent case, just some background research with the pig, unless Hopkins or Dimmock had contacted John directly. But, no, if it were a case John would be hustling him out the door. John wasn’t experiencing a spike of adrenaline or anticipating danger. He was relaxed.
John cracks a smile at that. “Yeah, well, I’ll give you time to rethink that if you like.”
The impact is harder than he thought it would be. Sherlock saw it coming, was braced for it, but John still managed to catch him a bit by surprise. As John always has.
“Is that it?” Sherlock looks back at John’s question and at least he’s gotten Sherlock to pause before leaving.
John straightened at that. Sherlock’s feigned ignorance had made him angry. Good. Anger was an emotion they were both familiar with, both comfortable with. John’s fists clenched at his sides, his thumbs rubbing dangerous lines along his index finger.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Yes, obviously.” They were just something to do to pass the time anyway. And now that time has passed.
“Giving orders already?”
“Sherlock, please.” There’s some comfort in the structure of formalities, some safety there. Sherlock doesn’t offer his hand to shake, however. Touching flesh to flesh is definitely not safe for the two of them.
beats John’s heart as Sherlock walks closer to him. He’s tall and imposing now and so, so far from the too-pale, too-scrawny kid in a hospital bed from so many years ago. John is starstruck by him.
She comes to him willingly, burying her face in the side of his neck. She’s hot. Very hot. But John would have noticed if she were dangerously so. Sherlock’s stomach gives that treacherous knot-and-twist feeling again anyway.
“None of the other orchestras will take me!” Sherlock bellows.
“I thought I might find you in here.”
“A few weeks, at most.” It was never enough time but it was the time they had.
That quiet question makes Sherlock’s stomach drop to his feet. Victor doesn’t need to clarify or explain his meaning. He wants his skin on Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock wants it too. He’s so sure.
The expression John shoots him makes Sherlock’s stomach twist. He doesn’t like it. “You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb.”
Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut. John is trying to give him a way out but he can’t take it. Not now. Not knowing that everything he’s become is based on this defining moment of his early life.
It feels as if John only makes it part way back over to his side of the bed. Sherlock feels John’s warm weight settle across his back and side. He’s certainly not going to complain about that.
It’s a ridiculous question that doesn’t require an answer. John knows it doesn’t require an answer since he’s obviously already made himself comfortable and will very soon fall asleep. Instead of a verbal response, either an affirmative one or a sarcastic one, Sherlock takes John’s hand and uses it to pull his arm more firmly around Sherlock’s waist.
“They’re a morbid bunch, nurses.” Stamford laughs but John can’t quite join him yet.
The conversation is not over, Sherlock knows that. It’s just temporarily stalled. If he’s honest with himself, what was said in the car today is just a continuation of the conversation at his hospital bedside from years before.
It’s a joke, and Sherlock has never heard ‘pig guts’ be growled out in a way that makes his toes curl before, but he steps back anyway. He’ll wash up, John will take him to dinner, and then they’ll come home and pretend to watch some boring movie before heading to bed.
Sherlock is very careful not to touch John’s hand when he takes the phone. He’s not wearing gloves but a lot of adults don’t, even if they never found their soulmate. Maybe John was right all those years ago. Maybe Sherlock was his soulmate but he’s not Sherlock’s. There’s relief and pain in that.
Just as Sherlock is weighing the benefits of one type of kissing over another, John sucks on the flesh at the juncture of his neck and shoulder. He worries it with the blunt edge of his teeth and soothes it with his tongue. A moan escapes Sherlock, loud enough to crack the sound barrier they had implicitly agreed upon.
John stays home from school that day and his Mum buys him a pair of soft and breathable cotton gloves to cover his hands. Once children lose their colours, it’s a much more intimate thing to touch skin to skin. He’s the first one in his year at school that has to wear them. He’s only 12, he thought he’d have a few more years before he lost his colours, but John doesn’t grieve their loss for long. He’ll get them back as soon as he meets his soulmate. Someone with a heart as big as John Watson’s won’t have to wait long.
Sherlock Holmes. Aged 21. And a drug addict who nearly died tonight from a mixture of cocaine and heroin.
That voice makes his sit straight up and lock eyes with the stage.
“Your mind isn’t ugly.” John’s defense sprang to his lips automatically. He was enraptured with Sherlock’s eyes, the way he ran his tongue across his lips.
“You could.”
Sherlock’s not sure how long he’s been carefully pulling bits of shattered bone and broken glass from the pig carcass laid out on the table. His head jerks up and his hand slips so that he ends up with a bit of the mess that’s left of the pig’s entrails on his knuckles. He needs to know the time. He has to have the more disturbing or hazardous parts of his research cleaned up and put away before Rosie gets home from school. It’s the long standing agreement he and John have had for more than five years now. He’s managed to only go against it a few times in the early days when he wasn’t quite sure of their operating definitions of “disturbing” and “hazardous”. He knows better now.
Sherlock’s gut twists when Rosie turns her red, blotchy face to him. Not being able to comfort your own daughter would be even more difficult than sending strangers away uncured.
“Technically, you hadn’t entered the crime scene yet.”
Maybe Sherlock can convince him to skip the pretense of a movie altogether.
“Ah, is…” Sherlock looks to the ceiling, hands still wrist deep in pig carcass.
Sherlock grinds down against those irritatingly still fingers. “You. I want you on top of me, fucking me.”
‘John’ giggles, actually
John laid his head against Sherlock’s sweaty back to rest. He was panting and his vision had gone black around the edges. Sherlock’s head rested against the balustrade and he too breathed heavily in the cold air.
John spends so much time around the hiss and beep of medical machines that normally he doesn’t even notice them. Tonight, they ring out in the otherwise silent and dark hospital room where John has planted himself.
He stays stretched out, sweat and come and steam sliding down his chest and belly, for a few long moments. This is the most relaxed Sherlock has felt in ages. He wipes the wet mess from his skin, drops his towel to the floor, and strides past the stranger entirely naked.
“...not in the picture.” Sherlock just about regains his composure, but there’s a tension in his neck and a hitch in his voice that John can’t ignore. Sherlock spins away and finishes buttoning up that ridiculously long and swishy coat. “I think that’s enough to be going on with for now, don’t you think?”
John was familiar with witches. He’d seen things in the field and on the march he could not explain. Some evil, but most benign. That still did not mean he shouldn’t be cautious. He rested his palm over his sword hilt.
John laughs. “This is all you need. You can do it. You just need to let go.”
‘John’ smiles a bit and Sherlock watches the spread of his lips more than he watches the slight thickening of his cock. “I’ll try to remember that.”
Mycroft doesn’t deny it. He simply inclines his head.
John doesn’t have to look up to know Stamford, always a believer in happily ever after, is frowning at him. “You don’t even know him.”
Sherlock took his hand and made it nearly to the balcony door before he cried out. “Oh! We can’t go home yet. There’s a confessional I’ve been planning to commit sacrilege in.”
John curls his fingers and presses. He’s not really moving faster, and Sherlock knows that, but Sherlock suddenly feels so much more. His back arches, lifts from the bed, and John has to clamp a hand to his hip to keep him steady.
“My… Victor, my friend. I think I loved him, John.”
“She obviously possesses above average intelligence.” Sherlock lays her down and pulls the blanket over her. Rosie barely stirs.
And John wants to be a good person, a model father even if he knows that’s an unattainable social construct. Being upset and frustrated pushes that unrealised self-image even farther away.
***************
A log popped in the fireplace and Sherlock wished he had his violin to use as a distraction. Or as a shield.
“Hire this one. He’s loyal. You won’t lose him to another orchestra or a better paying day job. He’s pulling an Army pension so he can survive on what you’ll pay him.”
His hand closes around the phone in his back pocket before he can think about it. “Er, here. Use mine.”
“You would know, if you had been here.” Sherlock can’t quite resist that jab. As much as part of him wants John to stay, to fall into a comfortable domesticity with the man, he can’t give up without a fight.
“Usually there’s no talking in a place like this.”
Never is a bit of an overstatement. He does try once, in his first year at uni. Victor Trevor is short and broad and the contrast between the sleek darkness of his skin and the blinding white of his smile is mesmerizing. Sherlock wants to tuck his chin against the close cropped hair on top of Victor’s head and just breathe him in, but Sherlock’s afraid of what will happen. Either outcome of skin-on-skin contact is terrifying to him.
John’s hand is still warm around his wrist. Not pulling or insisting, but just sitting there. Waiting. “I’m glad it stayed an ‘adequate substitute’ and the novelty didn’t wear off then.”
He stretches his long legs out in front of himself, and his toes bump against another man’s ankle. Sherlock nearly pulls back, not wanting to invite outside attention tonight, but then he looks.
Sherlock waves a hand. “Fine, Lestrade, whatever. The important part of this conversation is that I have a proposition for you.”
He must be stalling. John’s trying to shuffle him out the door. Sherlock spins toward the kitchen, his coat swirling about his legs. John’s gun is in a lock box in the cupboard above the refrigerator - another concession to living with a toddler. Sherlock has it tucked into the back of his waist band before he makes a move toward the door.
“So the police think, but now they’re here to ask for my help, so who do you think is right, hm? There’s been a fourth and there’s something different this time.” Sherlock can feel it, the thrill of the case, the promise of an impossible puzzle. It cracks his face into a wide grin. Oh, the things he can show John. He can show John what he can do, what he’s capable of and why John never should have left in the first place. He can show him what he was able to become without him, and make him proud.
That had been easier than anticipated.
“No.”
His hands are shaking now and it has nothing to do with cocaine. It’s been years since he’s touched it and Lestrade knows it. But Lestrade only knows it because he was the only conductor in London that would give a newly-clean Sherlock a chance.
“Faster. John!”
“Goodbye, John.”
“Come here often then?”
There’s nothing else to say so Sherlock steps forward, cups the back of Rosie’s head in his palm, and presses a soft kiss to her forehead. It’s a ritual for them now. Sherlock always brushes his lips against her hair or her cheek before he leaves. She often leaves sticky kisses on his face when Mrs. Hudson or Molly take her out of 221b for an afternoon.
“You play the oboe. Often, and fairly well.”
The cold water in the flat is working, but not the hot yet, but they wash up with some borrowed towels from Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock goes first, shutting the bathroom door even though there’s a hole ripped in the wood so it barely matters. While John wipes away the sweat and grime of the day, Sherlock balances Rosie against his chest and folds up the cot to move it into his bedroom. John will want her close.
Sherlock does get a few bits and pieces though.
Now he does stop long enough to take his first deep breath since leaving the lab and to hail a cab. Mrs. Hudson said he could start moving his things into Baker Street while he looked for a flatmate. He’ll use the rest of the day to pack and move boxes. Maybe some manual labor will calm his thoughts.
‘John’ huffs a laugh and Sherlock simultaneously tries to push his neck into ‘John’s’ mouth and thrust his cock through ‘John’s’ hand. It ends with Sherlock half sprawled across ‘John’s’ lap with his legs thrown out at odd angles and come cooling on his belly. ‘John’s’ hand lies across his thigh and even in the dim lighting Sherlock can see the contrast of his skin tones.
He stroked Sherlock’s cock again and picked up a slow rhythm of shallow thrusts. “I think you’re here, with me, so you can get fucked over all of Paris. You can flaunt your unnatural nature to the entire population without them even knowing.”
That’s when Sherlock sees it. Possibilities laid out in front of him, now that he has full use of his senses.
“This one did. Will you come?”
John stands a little straighter, almost at parade rest if it weren’t for the slight lean into his cane. “Yes.”
Mycroft had known for years and hadn’t told him. Sherlock could exist for years more, forever even, in ignorance. Blissful ignorance. Except for that excruciating, raw-around-the-edges hole in his chest. But that hole would have been there, has been there, regardless of Mycroft’s meddling. It’s just changed in the substance of its pain, not the amount. Much like greys turned to blues, and greens, and reds, and golds.
“Damnit, Sherlock, that’s not what I meant and you- Look, I’m sorry I left you, it was a selfish thing to do. You should have had the opportunity to decide. We should have talked about this then, but I made the decision for us and I’m sorry about that. But it doesn’t look like you’ve suffered too badly because of the separation so just remember that, yeah?”
He gives John until the count of ten in his mind to regain his composure before Sherlock thrusts his hips to remind John of what he should be doing. His grip had slackened over the past few minutes, which was fine, Sherlock had other things to concentrate on then anyway. He tightens his fist again reflexively when Sherlock moves his cock between them.
“No, I mean, is there anything special about the date? It’s not the anniversary of the day you got shot, or of when Mike brought you to Bart’s, or anything like that?”
“Well, you’re the second person to say that to me today.”
) he is running from. In the desert there’s nowhere to look but endless horizon during the day and endless sky at night.
It’s instantaneous, the change that happens right before John’s eyes. Where the world was muted grey, it’s now bursting with colour. Shades John has never seen before; so vibrant and rich it makes his head spin. His stomach lurches and his blood rushes in his ears.

The quiet feels like it’s for him alone. It makes him feel safe. If they don’t raise their voices, this interlude is some otherworldly event just between them. The darkness helps with that illusion too.
