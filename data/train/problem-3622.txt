“I mean weed. You know, when you asked me out-”
You know I always say shit about my fics, because usually by the time I post them they seem bad, but usually I kinda like them anyway - but I can honestly say that I hate this one and I have no idea why I wrote it and I wanted to rewrite it before posting but never got around to that hah so here it is, idc
“Don’t be a smartass.” Dean said into Cas’ lips, as he kissed him for the first time. He would never say it out loud, but he could literally see and hear fireworks as their lips touched. And maybe he could? Who knew how Heaven worked, right? He immediately knew that this, kissing Cas, would forever be his favorite thing.
“I’m not.” Dean said. “But whatever. We can go there.” not like the guy’s gonna be there anyway. It was middle of the night and Dean saw him there only during days. And he knew for a fact that it’s open 24/7. He’s there quite a lot, especially on weekends, when the guy works.
“Yeah, like to be punctual. For the important things.” Dean chuckled. “Fuck, you’re cute.” he said without thinking, looking at Castiel’s smile. Cas blushed and gave him a sheepish smile.
He loved when he was driving with Cas in the front seat. He would steal glances at the angel, and he could swear he felt his heart doing flips every time their eyes met.
“Yes, you did.” Cas laughed. “You really were that high, huh?”
He obviously didn’t need sleep, so while Sam and Dean went to bed, exhausted, he was still there. Digging through books in the library, desperately trying to find a solution to bring his son back. That’s where Dean found him.
“Are there any places with ice-cream even open right now?” Sam, of course, was the voice of reason.
tbh I kinda like it tho haha
Dean and Cas exchanged glanced and little smiles. They're still not gonna kiss or hold hands in front of Sam. They weren't ashamed or anything. But they both weren't big on public display of affection.
When they were finished with the food, they spent a bit more time there, just sitting and talking. Then they paid and left. They started walking back towards Dean’s apartment, Benny and Charlie deep in conversation about some sci-fi movie they both watched and now they were discussing and freaking out over the end of the world. Sam was to them listening with amusement, and Dean was deep in thought. Then suddenly he stopped.
“Good luck, Dean.” Cas smiled and wanted to pull away, but Dean didn’t want to let go.
“Yeah, you did good” Dean started walking to the door. Cas was confused. Dean was confusing him, which wasn’t really anything new. One minute Winchester was basically an assbutt, the next he was quite nice. The angel wasn’t complaining about it, tho. He wanted them to finally go back to normal, without Dean’s weird mood swings, if it can be called that.
“You know what you wanna get?” Dean asked, his menu raised a bit, to avoid Sam’s teasing about drooling over Cas. Who was just... there. And that was making Dean giddy. And
He was really nervous for the rest of the day, and the next day. Normally, when he or his friends were feeling stressed, they would smoke a bit, just enough to relax. But he promised Cas he would be sober. Besides, he wanted to remember everything exactly.
Oh my God, this is it - the last chapter 😢
“I just wanna say, you gotta relax a bit. It’s nothing.” Sam was clearly amused, while Cas just looked between them with a frown.
Hello! Almost forgot about posting today because my sister was visiting me and we were watching The Good Place until 1am (and I usually post around midnight lol)
They all placed their orders and Cas went away, with Dean observing him. Cas was in a really well-fitting pair of black jeans, and a white polo shirt that they were supposed to wear in the diner, and a red apron. And he looked good. Like always. His dark hair all messy. But the thing about him Dean liked the most, in appearance, were his eyes. So blue and bright and… deep and nice and Dean was so in love with those eyes. He also loved Castiel’s sense of humor and the way he got confused when he didn’t understand a joke or a reference. Or how smart he was and he seemed to know every fact there is about everything. And he was so nice and helpful to people. They talked quite a lot. But not long, because Cas was always working. And Dean never had the guts to ask him out, even as friends. And when they weren’t talking and Dean was in the diner, he liked to observe him. He knew all his cutest smiles and expressions. And he was a little creeped out by himself, but he didn’t care.
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
Idk if it counts as “as encouragement” but this is what came to my mind so here it is lol
“Never had the chance.” Cas shrugged.
“What?” Dean asked, pulling a little bit away and looking into those beautiful eyes.
“Who gives a shit? We’re in love.” Dean grinned, and at that, a similar grin appeared on Cas’ face too. Damn, he looked gorgeous. And it was so good to say that, too.
Cas and Dean are arguing. (no idea what about, can be whatever you imagine haha)
“Can never be too careful.” Dean shrugged. “But you got a gun too, right?” he added, glancing at Cas.
Anyway, again thank you so so so much ❤️ Love you all ❤️ And hopefully see you in my other works haha❤️
this seemed cuter in my head hahaha
And Dean got lost in those blue eyes. And all he wanted to do was kiss Cas’ lips. But... Keep in mind that he was intoxicated, when he mindlessly said, or maybe even muttered “I could really eat somethin’.”
Dean pulled away from Cas once he was sure Sam left.
Idk, I wrote it such a long time ago, it's probably bad and dumb, but whatever hah
But I actually like this one, so whatever :D
Dean sat down with them and after the box of ice-cream was empty, they all went to sleep.
“Thanks, little bro.” he closed the door again. “Sorry ‘bout that.” he said to the phone. “It’s just that my brother’s visiting and, you know.” he shrugged, although Cas obviously couldn’t see him.
"You don't have to do that, Dean." Cas said but Dean just shot him a look. A look that said: shut up and drink your water, I'm happy to do this for you.
Anyway,
“I miss Eileen.” Sam murmured, as his girlfriend was on her own hunt and was going to meet up with them later. “I’ll go outside and call her.” he sighed, still sounding amused, and Dean could almost hear the eyeroll.
this didn't turn out exactly how I'd planned, but I think I still like it hah
“What kind of life would it be without you?” Dean asked softly, and looked into his blue eyes and saw something he’d never seen there before. Pure happiness. And he felt proud that he was the cause of that.
“I know.” Sam sighed. “And he likes you too, don’t worry. I honestly don’t know any person, who isn’t a teacher, who didn’t like you.” he said, because, yeah, Dean wasn’t so popular with the teachers. He was doing good at school, but his attitude wasn’t always the best. He was kind of a smart-ass.
“Me too.” he admitted, slowly getting up, immediately feeling Castiel’s hands on his shoulders, helping him.
“Right on time.” Cas grinned.
Now Dean was above Cas. Well, his legs were next to Cas', but his head was above Castiel's head and his hands on each side of Castiel's head.
Enjoy ♥
“But you do, huh?” Dean smirked, now feeling stupid for not realizing it earlier. “Because you’re no ordinary angel.” Cas shrugged, with a helpless little smile. Dean took another few steps closer. “You’re a Winchester. And we never play by the book.” at that, Castiel’s smile grew wider and his expression softened even more. “Cas, every time you leave me, I- I can’t function. I can’t breathe without you. So even though I’m dead now, I’m happy, because you’re here and nothing can tear us apart now.” he grabbed Castiel by the lapel of his coat. “And just to be clear, because you’re a dumbass, I love you, too.” his voice shook a little at those last words. Ironically, he felt like he was going to die in that moment. His heart was racing, as if it was about to jump out of his chest, and he felt dizzy.
Enjoy ❤️
But anyway, I wrote this one a loooong time ago for number 11 before I realized that it fits more here, idk, and thanks to that I wrote a new one for number 11 which is one of my faves haha
the bitchface on Sam’s face.
Enjoy♥
“Yes, I want-” but before he could finish, Dean interrupted him.
"Jerk." Sam muttered back.
also sorry if it’s kinda chaotic, I deleted and added stuff so many times I just don’t know if it makes sense anymore lol but who cares haha
“Yeah, he can be worried.” Cas agreed.
Enjoy ♥
“Sure.” Dean said, already forgetting about his friends. “But this will not count as the first date.” he added.
Actually I wrote it just a few days ago, because the one I had written for chapter 11 seemed to fit better later on, so I just moved it lol
And that actually was the case. Sam was sick of the way they acted. Especially his brother who was too stubborn to quit it. They needed to be forced to be together in the car for a long time. That should do it. So he came up with some lame ass excuses as to why he needed to stay and neither Dean or Cas believed him but they eventually just let it go. Sam found it kinda ironic how easily that came for Dean, when it was so hard for him to talk to Cas now.
“We both know that's not true.” Dean didn't see Cas, but he was sure that the angel just rolled his eyes. “There's few more hours left. Either we stop somewhere so you can sleep, or I'm driving. Don't start again.” he added when he saw Dean opening his mouth to argue that he's not that tired. Dean shoot him a glare.
Opposite to Charlie, and to Dean’s right there was his other best friend, Benny Lafitte, on an ottoman, holding the joint at the moment and taking a drag on it. He was also Dean and Charlie’s friend. They all met at the same time in elementary school and were inseparable since. Benny too went to college with Dean and even used to live with him for a while, before they decided that living together was not good for their friendship. They drove each other crazy.
“You sure you don’t want actual food first?” Sam asked, probably ready to start lecturing Jack on how to eat healthy and that you can’t just eat desserts for every meal.
human.
“Anyone wanna tell me how this happened? And when?” Sam asked, motioning between Cas and Dean. “Who finally had the guts to make the first move?” he was really curious, but he said it in rather teasing tone. And, who was he kidding, Dean was not gonna tell him anything.
It was late. It was almost 11am. And they were still in bed, despite waking up about an hour ago. Normally, they were busy, hunting monsters or saving the world, the usual. But that day, there was nothing urgent waiting for them, they didn’t feel too hungry, and they really didn’t feel like getting out of bed for other reasons than to go to the bathroom.
“I guess.” Winchester looked at Castiel. He was smiling softly and looked so relaxed. It was a rare sight. He glanced at Dean and his smile widened a bit. Blue eyes met green ones for about two seconds, and something happened. Something clicked in Dean’s mind.
“I’ll try.” Cas said, not wanting to make promises he can’t keep. He was overwhelmed too. Dean just kissed him. It was unreal. And when they met, it wouldn’t even cross his mind. Of course, there were feelings. But he never fully understood them until he spent more time here. And when he was human, he started to understand a little bit more. He still was confused about many things, but there was one thing he knew for certain. That the things he felt for Dean were definitely mutual. At least that’s what he concluded from this situation. He hoped he’s not wrong.
“Getting comfortable. This is gonna be a long drive” Cas shrugged. Dean’s eyebrows raised. So he’s always in that trench coat. Always, no matter the situation. Fucking always. And now, when Dean’s stuck in the car with him, all alone, he decides to take it off and look hotter than usual? Wow, that was so not fair.
He would see Cas sitting in the library and reading, and that warm feeling would come back. He started paying too much attention to the way Cas frowns, when he’s confused or when he’s concentrating. And the way his fingers would play with the pages of the book absentmindedly.
Cas didn't say anything. He just laid in bed on the other side and covered himself with half of the blanket.
When they finally pulled away, they were both out of breath. Which was a reminded of Cas being human again, who needed air to live.
Dean exchanged a few more kisses with Cas that night, out in public, in a bar, in front of all those strangers and his family. Doing that made him feel free and happy. Not having to hide his love, his feelings. And, of course, they exchanged even more kisses later, in their motel room, but that’s a longer story…
“Of course.” Castiel smiled widely.
“Yeah.” Sam nodded, also standing up. “So we’re going out?”
Idk if it fits the prompt or if it even makes much sense, but I like it hahaha
“What?” Dean was caught off guard, as they were just talking about the fact that they like the same books.
He couldn’t sleep, he was worried about Cas, and about Jack, and he couldn’t let himself grieve or else he would lose it. And he felt guilty, for being so against Jack at the beginning, among other things. After all, bad things were always in some way his fault, right? At least that’s what he believed.
“As always, Dean.” Cas rolled his eyes. “Have I ever asked you if you have your gun?”
As soon as he did that, he wanted to pull away, feeling stupid. But then he felt Castiel's hand on the back of his neck, and the other one in his hair, holding him there and not letting him pull away. So he deepened the kiss, also putting his leg on the other side of Cas, so now he was directly on top of him. It was awesome. He never was that close to Castiel. And now their bodies were literally touching and he felt like he was on fire, but in a good way.
“Oh, wait.”  Winchester suddenly remembered that his brother is staying with him for another few days. He opened the door and called “Yo, Sammy, you gonna be okay if I leave you here alone tomorrow night for a couple hours?”
“Cas helped.”
“About what?”
Anyway,
“How does that whole sleeping thing work? I mean, do you dream? How can you just fall asleep?” Dean asked, eyes not leaving the road. Cas looked too adorable after waking up. His hair a little ruffled, his expression softer than usual… blue eyes almost glowing, but that’s usual too. It was getting dark outside and they were on the road in the middle of nowhere, where there weren’t even any cars.
Then Dean showed up with pie and beer and they all sat down and talked. Dean told Sam about the case and Sam told them about the small vampire case in town he went on while they were away. And Sam haven't noticed a thing, because Cas and Dean acted like they always did. But he knew that something was definitely off, when his older brother and the angel stared at each other for a while too long, like always, but that stare was different. Not so much with sexual tension, as with fondness and something else that Sam couldn't quite pick up.
“Enjoy your meal.” Cas smiled, a little abashed, and then was gone.
Enjoy ♥
Luckily, they found a motel. Cas booked a room while Dean was parking the car.
“Don’t you dare dying again.” he said, his tone full of anger and worry and sorrow. “Don’t you friggin dare, Cas” he added sounding way too desperate. But he didn’t care. He closed his eyes. “We need you.
“I need a break.” Dean said, shutting the book he’s been trying to read for the past hour - he did not get past one paragraph - and leaned back in his chair.
If you celebrate: Happy Easter, if you don't: have a nice Sunday 🤷🏻♀️😅
“Dude, we just ordered. Be patient.” Benny rolled his eyes, smiling.
“We're not hiding.” Dean rolled his eyes, finally standing in front of Sam. “We're just private. And don't need to overshare.”
“Wait.” Dean’s eyes widened. “You’re tellin’ me you never smoked weed?”
And then Dean got a little distracted, looking at Cas, who was focused on reading the menu, squinting and frowning, and he was so adorable. He put the menu higher, right in front of his face, and Dean had trouble resisting the urge to tell him that he needs glasses, again, thus starting another one of their bickering sessions (
“Yeah, you’ve been talking about it before Dean suggested food.” Sam said. He was still the sober one.
“Yeah, m’fine.” he had his eyes closed, and he felt a bit dizzy, but he wasn’t sure if that’s because he hit his head, or because he kissed Cas. Maybe both. “I just need a sec.”
Enjoy ❤️
And it's around 12 hours later than usual because I usually post around midnight but last night I wasn't in the state to post it hahaha
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know” Cas repeated, earning a chuckle from Dean. After that Dean fell asleep, feeling Cas’ warm body against his. Cas’ body. Cause even in Cas’ opinion, it stopped being just a vessel a long time ago. It's him now.
“I needed to summon the Empty. Sorry if the timing was inconvenient for you.” Cas rolled his eyes, and that almost made Dean smile.
“Dean…” Cas started, but then Dean pulled away and looked Cas straight in the eyes, his hands on Cas’ neck.
"No." Dean shook his head. "Sit down." he pointed at the chair by the table. Cas did as told, he didn't see why not. "Now, let's get you your water." Dean walked to the cupboard, took a glass, poured some water and gave it to Cas. "And I'm gonna clean this up." with that words, he started cleaning shattered glass and water from the floor.
“I know” Cas cut in, and Dean relaxed, just now noticing that all his muscles got tense and he was holding his breath. Maybe it was stupid, but he just wasn't ready to say those words. He was expressing his love for the angel in other words and other ways.
Dean woke up at the sound of footsteps in the hallway. They were quiet, discreet, like someone didn't want to be heard. And they definitely weren't Sam's. His first instinct was getting his gun that was usually on his nightstand while he slept nowadays. He took the gun and stood up, already fully awake at the thought of an intruder in the bunker.
That night, Cas didn't feel the need to fall asleep. To run away from reality and worries. His reality now was laying in bed with Dean Winchester. And when he looked at Dean's calm, beautiful face, all his worries disappeared for a moment. That night he made a promise to himself. He decided to stop doing reckless and stupid things, or things Dean would consider reckless and stupid, that endangered his life. He won't dare to die again, as Dean told him to. After all, around here nobody dies permanently. So if he came back again, Dean would be so pissed. So yeah, Cas will try really hard not to die again. For Dean.
They all went out of the building and started walking down the street. They were all talking and laughing. Charlie and Dean were walking hand in hand. Benny and Sam were right next to them. It was around 2am. There weren’t many people out.
It was Friday night. Actually, it was already Saturday. Four teenagers were sitting in a circle at the round table. They were all in great moods. It was probably mostly due to the joint they were sharing. They were finishing another one and they were quite high at this point. But let’s introduce them first.
The kiss was getting more and more heated and desperate, hands were everywhere, exploring new territories. Neither of them noticed that Cas started leaning more and more towards Dean, which caused the latter to lean back, which resulted in… the chair falling back and them landing on the floor.
Almost forgot to post it haha (doing it a few hours later anyway XD) because the end of the semester is near and I'm swamped lol
“Dean, are you listening?” Sam asked, as Dean looked at him over the table. He realized he’s just spent a good few minutes looking at Cas, who sat next to Sam, while leaning his chin on his hand. Damn. That was just embarrassing.
Also, one more thing: a few days ago I wrote the final 50th drabble and I'm thinking of posting the remaining ones maybe twice a week? On one hand, it'd end more quickly 😢, but on the other, I've been posting only once a week because I didn't wanna run out of chapters that I had written ahead, and since there's no more to write... idk, can't decide - so for now just know that there's a chance I'll post a new one on Wednesday or something
“Because it was so nice, just being here with you.” he admitted, not looking at Dean.
Enjoy ❤️
I kinda love this one, idc haha (though it could use some minor stylistic corrections, but I'm too tired for that)
“You got your angel blade?” Dean asked, as they were walking to the garage.
"Sure, why not.” Cas chuckled. “I’ll text you the address.”
personality is what Castiel admired the most about the human. So, like, basically everything.
We're at 30! Omg it seems like it's going so fast, even though I literally post one drabble a week hahaha
Then one night, he was lying in bed, on his back, observing Cas, who was sitting back against the headboard, and reading a book. And suddenly he made a decision. Which surprised him, because he was not even aware he was seriously contemplating it. It was just a thought he didn’t really take into consideration. Or so he thought.
Dean and Cas were laying in Dean's bed. Just that. Laying next to each other, enjoying each other's company. With smiles on their faces. Dean pulled Cas closer to cuddle with him. Turns out, Dean's a cuddler. He kissed Cas’ forehead, closing his eyes.
And he found another thing he loved about Cas - his lips and his kisses. His lips were chapped, but soft and hot, and they felt so good against Dean’s. And it made Dean’s heart flutter, and the butterflies he felt every time he looked at Cas went crazy and he felt them in every part of his body.
He found his way to the war room. That's when he heard something from the kitchen, like shattering glass. Dean walked over there, quickly but quietly. He stopped before going into the kitchen, getting ready to shoot whatever was there. Then he walked in and…
“I can’t lose hope. I can’t…
. The one that wrapped Dean around his finger not even trying.”
“Of course, Dean.” Cas’ smile was bright and happy. Happier than Dean’s ever seen him. And he realized that maybe up until now Cas was still doubting Dean’s feelings. Maybe he hadn’t thought that Dean would want to stay with him forever. Which was a stupid thing to think, because who wouldn’t want that? It was Cas. “Let’s get our own home.”
“Really?” Cas said in doubtful tone. He was really about to snap. Just say something. Dean was mocking him all day and now he said that it was ‘cool’? This time he wanted to be the one who’s mocking. But he decided not to be petty. One of them has to let go. If Cas engage in their pseudo-fight, it simply won’t stop till one of them dies again.
“Hey, Sammy. Just checking in. Miss us yet?” he asked, driving with one hand on the wheel.
Dean took a deep breath, but his heart was racing. He turned his head in the direction opposite to where he was looking at Bobby. And he saw him, just standing there and looking at him.
“Of course you do.” Sam muttered quietly, closing yet another book he’s looked through. They’ve been stuck in the library doing research for too long for their liking.
“I was reading. It's nice to see you two finally got your shit together” he added, still smiling like an idiot. Dean and Cas made their way down the stairs, still silent. “You don't have to hide that from me, you know. If it means anything, I approve” it did mean much, but Dean wasn't gonna admit it.
To Dean’s left was his best friend, Charlie Bradburry, sitting in the middle of the couch, talking passionately about something. They’ve been friends forever and now they were going to the same university. Her beautiful red hair was up in a ponytail, with few strands of hair and her fringe loose all around her face. She was wearing Dean’s t-shirt, because she spilled coke all over hers, being her clumsy self.
When Dean was done with cleaning and Cas with water, they both stood up and for a while just looked at each other. Finally, Cas broke the silence.
” Dean scoffed. “You didn’t know shit.” he said a little aggressively. “Just like you think that you couldn’t have what you wanted. You’re an idiot.” Cas opened his mouth to answer, but Dean quickly started talking again. “But I guess I am, too. I’m not good at this shit, Cas. This will not be as good as what you said. But I need to tell you. You know, when you showed up in my life, you turned it upside down. And it wasn’t just the angel thing or the Apocalypse, and all that shit. It was you.” he couldn’t help the small smile. “I started questioning everything. About me, about my life… You changed me, too, Cas. Completely. But I tried to repress all the feelings. I hid them as deep as I could. Until Purgatory.” he looked Cas in the eyes and saw the moment Cas understood where he was going with this. “Purgatory was when I realized. But then there was another problem. I thought...” he chuckled. “I was never sure if angels can, uh, feel the way humans do. I knew there was something there. But-”
“Well, do you wanna?” Winchester asked, not really thinking.
“Maybe they’re tied to something” Cas noticed, as there were many hunts when things like that happened.
But Cas’ expression was not what Dean expected, not after what happened just before Cas died. There was some kind of fondness in his eyes, but mostly he just seemed annoyed.
“So let’s get to work.” Cas got in the car, not even looking at Dean. He got that Dean was pissed, but he was starting to get sick of Dean being a sarcastic douche. More than usual. And more towards Cas. Castiel really tried. He was making an effort. He wanted to be as useful on a hunt as he could. But Dean was acting like offended little shit and was constantly mocking him and not really letting him help. And all that just because Cas almost died.
“I think Imma go make something to eat.” Dean said, choosing to ignore his younger brother. “Cas, you coming with me?”
“Hey Cas.” Dean cleared his throat, looking away from him. “I’ll have the usual.”
When he realised what exactly was happening, he laid down again with quiet groan and covering his face with his hands. What the fuck was happening to him? He released shaky breath and looked at the clock. They need to get going. He slept six hours, which is more that he needed. He got up.
The truth is, Dean was terrified. Not of ghosts, of course. He was terrified, because of all the feelings and emotions he had when Cas was around. And when he wasn't. Especially when Cas died. Of course, his previous deaths were horrible and Dean hated them. But this time something in him changed. This time he started thinking. And realised some things that he tried to block out of his mind. And another thing: he was terrified of losing Cas again. So he wasn't mad at him. But he acted that way so he doesn't do something he might regret, like… na-ah, he isn't even thinking that.
So they stayed there until Sam started wondering what was taking them so long. Keep in mind, he did not know about Dean and Cas’ relationship yet. And Dean was in no hurry to change that. In fact, he kind of liked the secrecy. Not only having this relationship and this happiness all to himself, keeping it between him and Cas, but he also liked even the simple excitement of the possibility of getting caught, like right then. Sam called out to them and when they didn’t answer, he made his way to where he last saw them, between the shelves. Before he got to where they were, they made their way towards him, laughing, in great moods, with red cheeks, messy hair, and swollen lips.
“That waitress was trying to flirt with you and Dean was jealous. Hence the kiss, to show her that you’re taken and she has no chance.”
“We know.” Charlie spoke up. “We’ve known you for quite some time.”
At first he tried to deny it. Whenever he would feel that way, or catch himself thinking something he shouldn’t, he would force himself to focus on something else. And usually he could, with the world constantly ending. He had something to occupy his mind. But then it was finally peaceful, at least for a while, and his feelings just grew and got more intense. And he couldn’t pretend like they don’t exist anymore.
“We are.” Cas said, his voice barely a whisper, before capturing Dean’s lips again, this time just for a second. “We can continue that later. We should go before Sam steals your car and leaves us here.”
After a while, when they were out of breath, they pulled away, resting their foreheads together.
Also, I have no idea why in all of these so far Sam has no idea Dean and Cas are together but whatever XD
“Wait.” Benny thought about something intensively. “Yeah, I think I’ve heard it already tonight.”
"You know… uh." he started. "If you need anything at all, you know where to find me." he said finally, kinda nervously, letting go of Castiel's hand.
“Uh, Cas? You okay?” Dean added, when the angel didn’t say anything. Then, Cas sighed.
“Fine” he mumbled, noticing a sign ahead of them. “Look, about half an hour and there will be a city. We'll find some motel. Happy now?” he asked gruffly.
“So, what now? Do we get back home or do we look for another case?” Jack asked eagerly. He was on enough hunts that he knew how it worked, but he still could get really into it and wouldn’t want to stop helping people.
“Wha-what are you doing?” he asked, cursing himself for stuttering.
this is kinda (very) cliche lol
“You always do.” Charlie laughed, rolling her eyes. “Anyway...  what was I talking about?” she asked, furrowing her eyebrows and trying to remember.
And as they looked into each other's eyes, for longer than necessary, as they tended to do, Cas realized why Dean was getting more open about them in public, even if still discreet. He was happy. And he really didn’t want to hide his happiness. And then Dean took his hand and intertwined their fingers. They weren’t at the stage of showing off their relationship, and maybe they never would be. But in time, their kisses and hand holding won’t be hidden, discreet, and secretive. And now they had all the time in the world to really figure everything out.
Again, this is based on
“You’re pretty.” Charlie said to Dean and chuckled.
Enjoy ❤️
“Cas, listen to me. You can cry and still have hope, okay? But we will get him back.” Dean’s other hand gripped Castiel’s cheek and moved his head in his direction, and Cas looked at Dean, surprised. “You have no idea... “ he trailed off. “Every time I lost you, I was a mess. I couldn’t cope with that. But then every time you came back, even when I really lost all hope.
“I know.” Dean sighed, putting his forehead against Cas’. “Be careful. Call me as often as you can.”
“Shut up.” Dean snapped.
, while there’s a chance...” Cas closed his eyes. “But-”
When Sam woke up, the whole bunker was quiet. Nothing unusual. He made breakfast, although normally Dean would be already up and usually he was the one making breakfast. But then it was really late and Sam had no idea where his brother and their friend were. So he went to Dean's room to see if he was even there and to wake him up and… he smiled seeing them cuddled up in bed, still asleep.
Enjoy ♥
"Cas." he whispered. "Cas, c'mon." he pulled on the blanket again. It was maybe ten minutes of that, not wanting to wake his friend up. "Well, fuck it." he said to himself.
“We will. Later.” Dean said, smirking, and scooting his chair closer to Cas’. Sam made a disgusted face, followed by a laugh and shaking his head.
Also, was gonna post twice a week now, but I forgot haha, next week, maybe 😂
“Don’t think so” Dean shrugged. “So we can go home now?”
He and Cas were driving in silence. That is, before Dean noticed that the angel is taking off his trench coat.
He glanced at the angel for a second, smile forcing itself on his lips. Dean fought back that smile, tightening his grip on the wheel and blinking a few times. He needs to focus. Because if he's supposed to be mad at Cas, there's no way in hell that he's letting him drive his Baby.
“Dean’s right.” Sam said, sitting next to him. “Only Dean calls me ‘Sammy’, which I still hate by the way.” he said with his famous annoyed expression and Dean laughed.
It was the little things.
It's not my favorite, but I don't really hate it so 🤷
I was supposed to rewrite that because it's bad, but then I didn't 🤷
“Dean.” Cas rolled his eyes, but there was a fond smile on his face. “You know I’m not interested in anyone but you.”
“Thanks, Sammy.” she grinned and stuck out her tongue when he rolled his eyes. “You know you’re stuck with ‘Sammy’, right?”
They all got out of the car and went inside the diner, sitting at the table, Dean and Cas on one side, Jack and Sam on the other. They ordered coffee first, and then looked at their menus.
“Maybe a little louder, would ya?” Dean said, trying to appear annoyed. But he wasn’t really capable of being annoyed right now, thanks to the weed. He was too relaxed. He pulled Charlie towards the nearest free table. It wasn’t hard, just two others were occupied. “And to you he’s Sam.” he added, knowing that the kid’s gonna say it anyway.
“Now?” in answer Cas just nodded.
“What are you doing here, Dean?” he sounded even more annoyed than he looked.
and I'm pretty sure it's connected to the previous "prompt", like it's about the other person running out of time - this drabble is not related to the previous one tho idk
Enjoy  ♥
They made it to the bunker late evening. Dean told Sam they’re gonna be later, but didn’t say why. When Sam saw them walk in, he knew something changed. Dean wasn’t mad anymore. He sighed with relief. Finally. But other than that, everything was like usual. Their longing stares full of love and fond smiles when the other wasn’t looking. Nothing new. Sam got used to it. He just wished they did something about it.
"Sleep here. If you can't fall asleep and want to talk or something, just wake me." Dean said, going back to bed. And despite the fact that he wanted to sleep. If Cas needed him, he wanted to he there for him.
But he understood all that just about a month later and he was so shocked that he hadn't noticed that before…
Cas just smiled and went to his room. Soon after that Dean followed, but went to his own room, put the gun in its place, and went to sleep. Or tried to.
Enjoy ❤️
He was lying there, not able to not think about Cas, for almost an hour. Then the tiredness won and he started to drift off… and that's when he heard a quiet knock on the door. He groaned into his pillow, got up, and went to open the door, already knowing who is on the other side.
But then as she brought their bill, she slipped Cas her phone number, as if Cas had shown any interest in her at all. And that’s when he felt a little petty, and, even though he wasn’t that big on PDA, especially as he was still getting comfortable being with a man (or at least an angel in a male body - it stopped being a vessel long ago), he made sure the waitress was looking at them and chose that moment to gently grab Cas’ chin, turn his head towards himself, and leave a soft kiss on his lips. Before he broke the kiss though, he shot a look at the girl, who was now looking away, blushing, clearly embarrassed. Dean smirked, as he pulled away.
“What about?” Cas put a bookmark in his book, then put it on the bedside table.
“Well, you’re here now.” Dean attempted a smile. “And if it makes you feel any better, it was not a glorious, guns blazing death. It was rather pathetic.” he chuckled. “And it’s not like I wanted to die, so don’t give me shit for that. You chose to be stupid and sacrifice yourself for me.” now he was getting irritated, because that was what his relationship with Cas usually looked like and he secretly loved it. All the irritation and bickering.
“I was getting bored.” Cas smiled innocently when he was done, his face close to Dean’s again. Yeah, apparently laying in bed and doing nothing was not something Cas could do for a long period of time. Dean learned about it a while ago, and normally he would be like that too, it was just so great to be able to do this with Cas.
“Guys, I’m starving.” Dean said again, in a kind of whiny tone. “Let’s go out.”
“Yeah, it does.” Dean was listening carefully, trying to remember. He wanted to know as much as he could about his angel. “Do you do this often?”
Almost forgot about posting this week lmao
But recently, Dean started wondering, and noticing stuff.
Somehow they ended up in the backseat. Dean shirtless, his pants already unzipped. Cas with his shirt unbuttoned, which took Dean a lot not to just rip it off of Cas. Meanwhile Dean asked Cas about a million times if Cas is really sure about that and assuring him that they don’t have do this tonight or even at all. The angel was just rolling his eyes and shutting him up. This was Dean WInchester. And who knows, there may not be any other opportunity. What if they die tomorrow, which for them is really likely? He wanted to experience everything, when it comes to Dean. And it’s not that it’s rushed. There has been sexual tension between them for the last couple of years. If not since the moment they first saw each other.
(though I love next week's drabble, can't wait to post that😏)
So they started reading. And if Dean noticed that Cas secretly used his grace to heal his headache, he wasn’t going to mention it. They both just hoped that soon, they won’t have to grieve, because they’ll get Jack back.
“But you thought I can never feel exactly how you do, because I’m not human.” Cas interrupted. Dean nodded, lowering his gaze to the ground. “In a sense you were right. Normally, angels don’t feel human emotions.”
“Thanks, Cas.” Charlie grinned at him.
“Yes, Cas, I’m sure. Let’s just buy coffee and some food and I’m good to go.” Cas was still looking at him with doubt and worry. “If I’m tired, I’ll let you drive this time, okay?” he said finally, getting into the car. Cas’ mouth formed into small smile. Dean said he’d let him drive. That means he’s not mad anymore. At least, not as much as he was before.
“C’mon.” Benny rolled his eyes, sitting down opposite to him and Charlie.
Ten minutes later they were in the car, driving towards their destination.
Idk, this is basically the first draft of the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the word 'discreetly' (reminder that it's based on a post that is linked in the notes at the very beginning - in the first chapter lol) and I'm not sure if I like it, but anyway
Enjoy ❤️
He loved when they watched movies together, and they sat close and their hands would meet in a bowl of popcorn, sending shivers through Dean every time their skin would touch. And he loved that Cas would actually eat the popcorn, despite not being able to really taste it. Things like that made him appear a little bit more human.
“Yeah, I’ll try. I might need a little kiss for good luck, though.” he added with a smirk, and Cas rolled his eyes, but was happy to oblige, and kissed him deeply again, this time for a shorter time.
“You go with Sam, as we planned. My case seems much easier and simpler than yours. I’ll call you all the time, and we’ll be back together soon.” he reassured. He let go of Dean’s hand and moved it to his cheek, because his other hand was occupied with his duffel bag. “And stop worrying so much. It’s actually kind of offensive.” he said with a teasing smile, because he had been an angel and he could fight just fine, and Dean knew that, but death seemed to follow all of them anyway, and Cas was more vulnerable now. Not that Dean didn’t trust his abilities as a human, or anything. He did. He just didn’t want to lose Cas again.
But he didn’t even know where to take him or what to wear.
“Mind your own business, bitch” Dean said to Sam and dragged Cas away, presumably to his room.
“What are you talking about?”
I started to write this mostly because I wanted to practice my writing and I saw this one post on tumblr (
If Sam hadn’t suspected anything before, he sure was starting to now.
25th! We’re halfway through! (I’m also almost done writing all of them, maybe I’ll post more when I’m finished idk)
“What?” they were all confused.
But anyway, I'm posting it a day early, and there will be no new drabble next week because I'm going on vacation to Croatia and I'm not bringing my laptop (and I don't like posting or writing on my phone hah) So see you in two weeks hahaha
“I think I want chocolate cake.” Jack said, but Dean didn’t pay much attention.
“We should probably get up soon.” Cas said, raising his head to look at the clock on the bedside table. “It’s late.”
He was half asleep, when he heard Cas’ deep voice, a little hushed.
, but it looks more like a first draft or a rough idea of a story hahah (not gonna rewrite it tho, need to keep writing the next ones haha)
“Then you’re screwed.” Sam joked and got a pair of socks thrown at his head. “I’m kidding! Jerk.” he scoffed, getting up to take a beer out of the fridge. He loved being at Dean’s place, because he could do whatever he wanted, like drink beer that his brother would buy him.
“Why aren't you sleeping?” was the first thing Dean said after he shook off his surprise at seeing his little brother. Dean's tone was offensive and even accusing.
But he didn’t hear an answer. Next thing he knew, Cas was kissing him harder and more passionate than ever before, shifting so that now he was lying on top of Dean. It was a long, hot, incredible kiss. When Cas pulled away, they were both out of breath.
“I thought this was your home.”
Enjoy (I guess) ♥
(I'll ramble some more in the end note sns haha)
It’s been a while since they saved the world. They kept hunting, although less and less, leaving the dirty work for other hunters, while they stayed in the bunker and did research and tried to help as much as they could.
“Hey, Cas.” he said, immediately getting his attention. “I’ve been thinking.”
They stopped for coffee and food and hit the road again. In the car Dean called Sam.
Cas smoked for the first time and it wasn’t that bad. At first he didn’t feel anything. Then he  started to feel kinda funny. And he was laughing and didn’t even know why.
“But cake
“Maybe.” Dean answered, shrugging and earning a side eye and a long sigh from Sam. “Cas?” he turned to him, waiting on an answer.
Just felt like writing some steamy make-out session but i’m super bad at it lol so idk how it turned out
I liked it when I first wrote it, now I'm not so sure... but it's written, so posting it without ovethinking haha (It's not that easy, I overthink a lot)
Enjoy♥
They talked before and they agreed not to tell Sam, or anyone for that matter. This was theirs and they wanted to keep it that way for now. If Sam catches them kissing one day, that's okay. But they’re not gonna announce it, at least not yet, while it's still fresh and… what exactly was that? It’s not like they’re ‘boyfriends’ now. Okay, they both are not gonna sleep with other people or date other people. But screw labels. They haven’t said it and maybe they don’t realize it yet, but they love each other. So they’re together and exclusive and in love. But that won’t change anything in their lives, except for the fact, that now they can kiss or have sex or talk to each other about things they couldn't before. And understand each other better. But it doesn’t change the fact that they’re best friends. And they hunt together. This won’t change much. It will just give them those rare moments of happiness.
“Was that necessary?” Sam asked, an eyebrow raised.
So yeah, they both wanted it. They were naked real soon. Neither of them was with a guy before. Dean was with a lot of women, and Cas was with one woman. So it was kinda awkward. Especially, since they’re best friends. But it wasn’t bad. If Dean had to be honest, it was probably the best, or one of the best, sex he’s ever had. Maybe that’s because it was with the person he cares about. Person he… yeah.
Anyway,
It was great. Living all together, in their home… but was it really a home? It felt like that before, after living in motels their whole lives. Maybe it used to be their home, and he loved it, it was the first permanent home he had since he was four.
“So tomorrow around six?”
“Okay.” Jack said with his signature cute, innocent smile.
“Wow, that’s nice.” Sam said to her, while other guys were still talking.
“I’m so sorry, Dean.” Cas said, eyes wide, getting off of Dean. “Are you okay?”
They all started bickering, when someone approached the table.
And maybe it was the time, around 5am. Or maybe it was being so close to Cas. Or probably the fact that Dean wasn't conscious enough to think. But he lowered his head and his lips met Cas'. Which is what he wanted to do probably since they met.
Enjoy ♥
Dean woke up freezing. Well, maybe not freezing, but certainly cold. At first he didn't know what was going on. Then he saw Cas next to him. Well, he saw just the blanket in which Castiel was literally wrapped, laying on his stomach with blanket on top and under him. But he was asleep.
“That’s not true, shut up.” Dean took a bite of his food. “If you go out with him, we’re not friends anymore.”
“Even our parents are not allowed to call him that.”
“We should get going.” Dean said, but still not letting Cas go, leaving soft pecks on his lips from time to time.
“Hey.” he said, walking over to him.
“Dean, about a month ago.” Cas answered, surprising them both. Before he could say anything else, Dean grabbed his hand.
“Hello?” Cas answered and Dean felt this familiar warm feeling he got every time he heard Cas’ voice.
And now it was Cas’ time to observe Dean. He did it quite a lot. And it was probably one of his favorite activities, however creepy and weird it may sound. Dean Winchester was, without any doubt, the most beautiful human Cas has ever seen. And it's not just about the way he looks physically. It's also about his soul. And his need to protect everyone. And goodness and kindness. Of course, he has flaws, like everyone. For example, his inability to deal with feelings and shifting everything to anger and taking it out on everyone around. But for some reason, all his flaws were just making him more attractive. Adding all that to his looks… damn. Cas enjoyed looking at Dean. He was just… perfect. Ideal green eyes in which Cas could just lose himself. Cheekbones, jawline, lips… ah, those lips. So eye-catching. So yeah, Dean’s appearance
And he loved that Cas would even agree to watch movies with him, even if it’s something they’d seen together before.
Just then Cas came over with a tray full of their food. He put everything on the table.
"Cas, c'mon. You just have to get used to living like all of us humans. And I know you will. Besides, you don't need to be an angel to be awesome." he added a little quieter.
“The case, Dean.” Cas said, tilting his head, as if trying to figure out why Dean was staring at him dreamily for several minutes. Dean almost smiled, seeing the familiar gesture. But he managed not to.
“No, that’s cool. I mean, that’s even better.” Dean assured. “Honestly I wanted to ask you even about tonight, but I didn’t wanna be too, um, pushy, I guess. But I’ve been wanting to ask you out for so long that the sooner the better.”
It was hours later when they all decided to take a break. And this time Dean suggested that he can put back the books they didn’t need anymore. Of course with that Cas agreed to help. But once they were far enough from Sam, who was trying not to fall asleep at the table, Dean put his books on the floor and dragged Cas behind a shelf.
“What’s wrong?” Cas looked at him with those piercing blue eyes. Dean physically felt his stare on his face. He glanced at those eyes for a moment, noticing, again, how beautiful they are.
“Just watch the road.” Cas was so annoyed with him already.
Cas still looked confused, especially since Dean never kissed him in the presence of other people. But Sam was quick to explain before Cas even formed a question.
died and got stuck in the Empty for you, so that you could live, and then immediately after that you just went and died?” he raised his eyebrows. Now Dean felt bad. He didn’t even think about it that way.
Just then Charlie said seriously “If you’re not gonna ask him out, I will.”
“Look, this should be good.” and he used that as an excuse to raise his menu even higher and come closer to Cas, so that their menus were now shielding them from Sam’s and Jack’s gazes. Cas turned his head to look at him in confusion. And then Dean left a soft, gentle kiss on Cas’ lips. “Couldn’t help myself.” he murmured, pulling away with a grin.
“What was that for?” Cas asked.
“Sure.” he knew Sam rolled his eyes. “I have to make a food run anyway. Well, drive safely. See you, jerk”
mad.” after those words he kissed Cas again. “Don’t” he started saying between kisses. “do that” another kiss. “ever” and another “again.”
Thank you all so much for reading and leaving kudos and comments ♥
Few hours later Dean woke up from a nightmare. It was happening a lot more since Cas’ death. And that's what he dreamed about most often. Losing him.
The case was going smooth. Cas was really getting a hang of hunting, although there still were a few his typical angel-moments (as Dean called it) when he was saying something not appropriate or when he didn’t understand something.
"Dean?" Cas said with his sleepy, deep voice and Dean just couldn't bear it. He loved the way Cas was saying his name.
“Oh.” that's a new information. Dean felt his eyes close and he wasn't even in bed yet. He took his jacket and shoes and off and collapsed onto bed, falling asleep almost immediately, on top of the sheets.
Just fyi, this and the next few chapters were written months ago hah
Cas put his coat in the backseat. Dean glanced at him and damn. He had just his white shirt with loose blue tie underneath that coat. Dean thought back to their hunt. And the way Cas looked when he was fighting. He was always observing Cas in situations like that. And every damn time he found himself attracted to the angel more and more. There was just something about how badass he was. And hot. And now he was sitting in Dean’s car, next to him, without his cute stupid trench coat that was always covering his awesome body. I mean, he knew it was just a vessel, but to him, this was Cas. Awesome, handsome, hot, badass, powerful, strong, beautiful, kind, sometimes stupid and stubborn and thinking he’s always right and then doing something wrong, but always with good intentions… his Cas.
Then they walked into the garage and into their respective cars. They both knew Dean was going to call not even five minutes into the drive, and talk to Cas on speakerphone for as long as he would be able to, to Sam’s annoyance and amusement.
Anyway, they talked to people, did some research, found the ghost… and that’s when it went downside. Because it wasn't a single ghost. There were ghosts. Plural. Very very mad vengeful spirits.
“Yeah, that’d be great. Should I pick you up?”
This one is probably really similar to drabble number 9 (in public) but they are all kind of repetetive so who cares lol
“Dean, I…” Cas started, breaking comfortable silence.
“I guess I prefer ladies anyway.” Charlie shrugged.
“You’re no help.” Dean scoffed and FaceTimed Charlie, asking the same question. She was at some party, getting drunk and high again.
“I know that.” he said almost defensively. “It’s just- You’re human now.” he linked their fingers and looked down. “And I can’t help it if I’m a little worried.” he murmured, his face now flushed.
They ended up going to the dinner, then to the movies, and then finally ended up in a bar, drinking beer and talking. Turns out, once they got past the awkwardness, they couldn’t stop talking about basically everything.
Can you believe there's just one more drabble left?! 😭 I was just halfway, where did the time go? 😅
Thank you all for reading, commenting, leaving kudos - it really motivated me to keep writing hah ❤️
So in this one Dean still has the handprint idk
Haha, I'm kind of trying to find more time to write, every night I try to sit down to it, or at least once a week, and I have so many ideas :D
“You’re ridiculous.” Cas shook his head, but then leaned in to kiss him sweetly once more. “But I’m kind of flattered.”
“Okay.” Cas said, surprising them both. “Let’s go.”
Wanted to post something at the beginning of new year, before I get back into studying and have less time for writing again haha
Enjoy ♥
Hi! This week I remembered to post in the middle of the week too yaay! (okay, I updated my calendar, whatever haha)
“Gimme a minute.” Dean grumbled, leaving Cas’ lips for just a moment. Sam huffed and walked past them, murmuring something about them being obnoxious and always all over each other, and sickeningly in love. Which was a huge exaggeration, in Dean’s opinion.
He parked the car in front of some diner. It was getting dark and they were all tired and hungry, and they’ve been driving for a while.
Enjoy♥
“I take it as a yes?” Dean smirked.
The angel was sitting at the library table, books all around, on the table, on the chairs, on the floor. And Cas had his face hid in his hands, and it seemed that he was… crying.
He was constantly finding new things about Cas that made him feel that weird feeling. It was enough for Cas to look at him, which was happening a lot, and he felt butterflies in his stomach. Cas’ eyes were the most beautiful thing in the world, and his smile lit up the room. And Dean was fucked.
“I don’t dance, Cas…” His legs betray him, following Castiel into the fray. Vodka making his protests toothless. Vodka and Castiel.
Unfortunately, waiting on the other side, were
of you play nice?”
Which, if he gave the reaction any thought, was an appropriate reaction. Dean may have admitted to casual dope use in his past, Cas knows he’s unprepared for anything harder. There’s no guessing how he might react. He could blow their cover, or worse,
therapy is because we lost someone very close to us.” Dean visibly tensed, clawing at the chair’s arms with enough pressure Sam feared he might rip it. Distracted, Sam faltered halfway through his spiel. He recovered enough in his next breath to finish it. “Our mom… she passed.” Hearing about their mom caused Dean to relax considerably, into a familiar apprehension. Sam’s confusion, in response, deepened.
“Something like that,” Cas admits with a casual shrug, “Following a lead, seeing how it pans out… I’m sure you’ve heard the same spiel from Dean.”
He shakes from his shock, finding three pairs of eyes looking at him in worry, pupils striking and fully focused on him. Like he was a lighthouse fixed on the shore. The sight of their troubled expressions has him shaking off the comparisons. He meets each stare with a smile. "Yes," he says, "I am."
“I might have!” Sam rose, shouting, “He was… he treated me well, and I liked hanging around him.”
And it was
“House is empty.”
“Humans are cruel creatures, Castiel,” Charles says, “Liars. Whatever he told you was untrue!”
“If anyone’s the traitor, it’s you, Buddy,” Mia said, “breaking my heart. Making me think you were some kind of good guy and not the scuzz you really were.”
What'd you think?
“Uh, yeah,” Cas says, rubbing his chin. Sighing, he reaches for him, “Dean –“
He opens the door, one leg thrown outside. “I have to pick up my niece.”
Dean follows his stare, and then jumps back. Tumbling out of his seat and onto the grass with an curse. “Sorry,” he says, standing. Brushing off dust and dirt. “Sorry, I – I didn’t mean to…” Dean slaps his legs, twice, and turns his head. A patch of blotchy redness creeps up past his collar along his neck. “We should probably get going.”
He loves him. He loves him. He loves him.
They snicker, returning to a more normal pace to reach Dean. Castiel lays out the blanket while Sam hands the food off to Dean for him to distribute. Working together as a team - like a
“Maybe that’s it…”
. Not like Sam’s pointed questions and giant thumbs hid his intentions. Even his terrible acting (“Eileen? What are the odds of you being here?”) couldn’t throw him off. Dean played along, however, letting them think he was in the dark. Knew exactly
“Maybe you should make something then?” Jack suggests, “An omelet? Cereal… fruit salad –“
Cas smiles with a weighty huff. “She’s like a dragon isn’t she?” Tracy answers with a twitch of her lips. “Okay, I understand. Thank you… and I’m sorry.”
“No,” she says, “Lamar had finished sharing his story with us. So, if you would like…?”
” Charles bellows, glaring between him and Dean. “Castiel, what in Poseidon’s name convinced you to journey so far away from your home.”
Following the bend of the curb, half a muscle car rests. Its other half hidden behind the flower shop situated there. Tucked behind the lush color of cut stems and verdant foliage, a person could easily spy on the ‘abandoned building’ if it wanted. Cas figures it must have rolled in sometime during his watch, knowing that if it were there when he first arrived Cas’s attention would have been divided between the case and whoever owned that beautiful ride. “If they look as good as their car…”
Another Thursday. Another Chapter.
Cas beats a rapid rhythm into his worn briefcase, fingers tapping one after the other in a wave-like patter while he waits. Interrupting only when reminded of his tightly buttoned collar and he needs to tug on it for air. He shifts in the seat, uncrossing and refolding his itchy legs. Stares at the scratch on his left shoe that follows the point at the end, squeezing his toes. At least he wore socks this time, better prepared than yesterday for his disguise.
find me annoying!”
From there any doubt about the day’s plans fly out the open window as the Impala speeds down the highway. Jack lets the waves of music and conversation roll over him, setting his body at peace. The lingering emptiness from his battle with Michael all but nearly vanishes as the warmth from his family fills him fully. Each time Dean and Sam snipe at each other in brotherly affection, or Castiel lays a hand on Dean’s shoulder when his eyes stay off the road longer than they should; even when Jack wins ‘I Spy’ by picking the tiniest object imaginable and gets three sets of grumbled congratulations reminds him that even if it might be tiny, a fraction of his soul grows from the speck left. It might not ever return to its full glory, still he will cling to that string of humanity with all his strength.
Cas collects a flower from a well-cared for bed of them, twirling its stem between his fingers. The yellow petals flutter and encourage a smile from him. Out of all the houses on her block, only she had flowers. Added a spark of originality to the otherwise cookie-cutter neighborhood. Where each house is a clone of the other, a suburban promise. Each home alike in values and pain. Protesting individuality with white-picket fences, keeping the very notion from disturbing their manicured appearances. But, always, a few weeds sneak through.
“Uriel, Balthazar, Anna, Hannah, Metatron – even
Cas sprints from the balcony, pushing away every distraction that blocks him from his goal. Whether external, like the listless partygoers holding empty cups, or internal, such as the heart-shaped lump camping in Cas’s throat.
Pinching the space between his brows, Dean sighs. “I’d rather you tell me why you were jumping the fence over at the Kline residence.”
“That’s what the wedding is for.”
Dean giggles, overcome by an intoxicating rush of getting to choose without any real consequence. No judgement, no threats, no guilt. If Dean told Castiel that kiss meant nothing and then bolted out of the bar, he would never have to deal with these conflicting thoughts, actions, and feelings. Never need to see Castiel again.
“Not sure,” he said, “But that won’t stop me.”
“…The moon?”
“Told you.” Dean hefts him up, throwing Castiel’s arm over his shoulders. “Now come on, we should get you some clothes before someone finds us.”
Sam’s expression softens. In turn, Dean’s skin crawls. “Thank you.”
present, safely tucked inside his drawers. And, if well received, his outfit will help perfectly transition into a holiday tradition Dean hopes last
Dean stiffened; gaze drawn to a whorl in the table’s finish. His thumb pressed hard at its center. He snorted, but it sounded more like an engine backfiring. “Supportive huh?” he asked, smile wide and mocking, “You want me to be
“Sammy…” Sighing, Dean sets his phone down on the nightstand closest to his side. “Think you’d take even the
Cas snorts, at both the cartoon and her story. “Kind enough to let you spend the night, but I draw the line at a ride home?”
Dean shifts, more upright than before. “Whaddya mean? I’m not sober right now?”
Rolling his eyes, Castiel waves his fins above the water at Dean. He chuckles when he notices the color drain from Dean’s face, the marking much more obvious now then they were before. “All my life,” Castiel says, “Because I’m a merman, like you are.”
His uninvited guest splutters, blushing. He drops his gaze towards Cas’s crotch, and then a hand waves in front while he averts his eyes. Although the splayed fingers terribly hide it from him, and Cas notices how the other man’s stare returns through the slats. “Seriously,” he growls, “I didn’t take you for one of those types, Cas.”
“Before you go, Kaia…” he addresses the other girl. “This place that the –“ his tongue trips, Dean’s aura pricking at his senses, “the tall man took you to. Do you remember where it is?”
“’Bout to ask you the same thing,” Dean starts, gesturing to him and Cas, “because see me and Cas here were talking on the way back and not a lot made sense this morning… look, if you wanted to start another prank war –“
Jimmy drags his decision longer than it should, but thankfully relents. He calls for Claire, warning Cas that if he’s lying there’ll be swift consequences. “Yeah, yeah,” he rolls his eyes, “since I have you, is ol’ Ishy still his
. Imperfect, flawed…”
Castiel frowns. “These fish do not have names, Dean. None that we know.”
Dean glances behind him to Castiel, smiling. “I wouldn’t have if I didn’t have any help.”
This detective hurries up and away from Cas, “I’ll go get him, then.”
happy… Is this what hobbies are all about? I should probably ask Castiel.”
calling it quits now.”
“That wasn’t his fault.” Sam rested his hand over Dean’s where it rested on the refrigerator door, pleading for Dean to look at him by touch alone. Dean relented, darting his eyes for a fleeting glance. Sam’s brows were drawn in like a steep hill, and he appeared absolutely ghastly because of the refrigerator’s light. Dean fell back to his mission. “Lucifer… he set this in motion, and we’ve dealt with him.”
“Right,” Castiel nods, leading him back to the path, “It shouldn’t be long now.”
safety. From people like you, and… and
When Dean forced him from the area, Cas couldn’t shake the idea of returning. From sunset to sunrise he turned over the immaculate study and the food wrappings, not even a midnight toke could settle his mind. It chanted a mantra loud enough, the only way he could quiet it was by listening. So, he listened. Drove up the next day and paid closer attention to his former makeshift toilet.
, on the other hand –
“I don’t think it matters,” Dean told him, “Grey hairs can strike at any time. I once worked with a hunter who rocked the salt-n-pepper, she was twenty-five. Said her parents got ‘em early, too. Maybe that’s the case with Jimmy?”
Something taps on his window. Cas scowls and glances behind him, seeing a younger, blonde girl waiting. He rolls the window down, “What?”
“Least I can do,” Dean shrugs, tasting sock once more, “it’s not like I’ll need’ta do more. Kid’s straight as a… straight thing.”
.” It’s said with so much scandal infused in the word, like Dean were a schoolboy and not a grown man.
own attraction to… to men, especially one man in particular…” Dean’s head felt like it might erupt, magma-like blood swelling his brain to dangerous sizes. “Cas.”
“How is that –“ Dean’s lips curl, “You can fuck women, and you
“What was that Jack?”
“It wasn’t all me,” Jack tells him, “at least I don't think it was. I
He sighs, crushing Castiel in a hug. “You’ve always been the most like me Castiel,” he admits, “Stubborn, a servant to your heart… but with a good head on your shoulders. If this is what you want to do…”
“Thanks.”
He meant what he said, though. He does not dance. Men don’t dance. Real men.
Seconds later, someone knocks at the door. “Dean?” Cas asks, voice muffled, “Is it okay for me to come in?”
“So, you love her?”
” Castiel panics, reaching out for Dean, “You need to get in the water! You’re suffocating!” Dean bats his hands away at first, still choking. Castiel growls, “Don’t fight me on this, who’s the more experienced merman here?” There’s a moment of slight hesitation before Dean accepts his touch. Slipping his hand into Castiel’s, he lets the other tug him into the water. Dean falls in with a splash, flipping around wildly.
“This time they’re not even willing to stand in the same room,” Sam confesses, “Ever since they found out about your meddling…”
Sam cursed, bolting upright from his seat. “If he’s not there,” he mumbled, pacing, “then where is he?”
“Only in the physical sense,” he tells Dean, “your body can be here, but
Jack wasn’t. He struggled, pushing Cas back, a whine pitched in his throat. Dean and Cas shared a look, Cas accepting Jack into his arms again. “We’re only kidding Jack. We’ll be in town soon, and then you can collect your candy and show off how wonderful you look as… as…” Cas stumbled. “Dean, who’s he supposed to be again?”
“Your best is better than a lot of people’s…” Castiel knocks his shoulder into Dean’s, Dean chasing after it. “My brothers’ idea of kindness is the occasional birthday e-mail, when the mood strikes them that is.”
Cas waits for the sound of doors closing, assured he and Dean were finally alone. Glancing at the dozing officer, Cas squeezes his shoulder. “Hey,” he says, shaking him, “Dean, wake up.”
He weakly bats Lucifer off him, “You don’t know anything…”
“Yes! No… fuck, Dean,” He pulls on the ends of his hair, scrounging for
Richard ‘Dick’ Roman. In his early forties now, but at the time of his most recent arrest he was thirty-seven. Given the list of offenses, though, he seemed to have a long history with the law since he was twenty-three way back in 1954. Small skirmishes here and there, egged on by the drink if ‘Drunk & Disorderly’ were to be believed. At least twelve of these offenses were listed, along with their status. There had even been an accidental manslaughter charge brought against him in 1962. While Dick had been charged for all of these, he never was convicted. Cas scowls as he finds Dick’s employment history. “I thought the name sounded familiar…”
“Give me a few,” she told Dean, “I won’t be long.”
filled the air, without the horrid bite of
“Keep my son’s name out of your hole you air breather,” Charles hisses, “I don’t know what kind of damnable magic you’ve enchanted my boy with but I will not have you carry him off to your world for whatever foul tricks you have planned.”
“Thanks, man. It’s a talent.”
There’s another half-formed defense waiting in Sam’s arsenal, but his ringing phone reminded Sam where his priorities should be. He answered, “What?”
Cas decides a change in plans might help. He leaves his car and strides into
“Fuck no, I just told him that so he’d put you on. I’m working a case and it looks like there’s rumblings in your neck of the woods. Wanted to see if you can spare some information for your coolest uncle?”
“It seems like you might be experiencing a...
of stories about California before moving here, so I wasn’t totally unprepared. But this wasn’t your average meeting. At its core, though, they did talk about giving things up to a higher power… but it ran a bit
The remark causes Castiel to bend his brow at a curious angle. “Magic has always existed in this world. Has humanity not been alerted to its presence? Do they…” his voice grows smaller, “Do they not even know of us?”
Nick sighed, moving around his desk. “Kelly, I didn’t… don’t say things you don’t mean –“
Dean didn’t explain further, instead shoving at Castiel and lazily swimming away. Castiel follows him, watching in amusement. However it slowly shifts as he spots something hidden behind a ridge.
“He looks happy,” Jack observes, Dean and Cas disappearing behind the hallway’s bend.
“You just… you make me so mad! Castiel, you gotta – you gotta understand, I mean…” Chuck wipes at his cheek, palm lingering there while their gazes meet. “You’re an angel. A – uh… a simple
“King Hall?”
What?
His acquisition, on its own, seems like a case separate from Jack. Why would a British man have access to records like this, with sensitive information and details? If he has Dick Roman’s file – what others were inside that briefcase? If there
Cas scans the immaculate living space and cannot match its tidiness with the man he knew. Jack, a boy who walked around with stains on his shirt and, more than once, left even Cas’s office messier than when he arrived. Now, though, nothing is strewn about the shag carpeting and his bed looks neater than a hotel’s. He scowls, blame already placed in his mind.
Castiel,” he mocks, arms spread wide and head tilted backwards. Laughing, “I’m
Dean coughs and folds his arms over chest, scowling. “Why don’t you tell me what you’re doing here, first?”
“What’s right?” Charles asks, “Leading some unfounded crusade through our domain towards human territory? Castiel I know you have some sick fascination with these creatures but leave those fantasies behind! Come home –“
He rolls his eyes, breaking Castiel’s hold on him. “Not for too long…”
The pirate ignored his pleas, it couldn’t answer him. And Chuck, apparently,
“Trevor?”
Meg stretches, bones cracking nearby. He feels his trench coat shift, and watches Meg slide it over her shoulders. She stands and leaves him alone. Disappears into another room.
Cas brushes his thumb over Dean’s heart, hand still on his chest. “Which is?”
“But I’m not,” Dean hisses, “I’m a – I
“Bastard Time,” he grumbles, “every year it’s always another part o’me…” Briefly, a thought flits across his mind that he needn’t lie on a floor with a perfectly empty bed nearby. But this thinking unearths a buried memory that has him rushing to his feet.
“You mean he go crazy?” Cas frowns and fiddles with the clasp on his briefcase, “From dealing with numbers all day? Is this common occurrence with American financial system?”
“Well if you took a look at my –“ his hand slaps at his tail, jaw dropping in horror, “My dick! My dick’s gone, too?”
Castiel nods. “It’s okay… at least now we know the transformation wasn’t superficial. The magic you’re playing with is much more serious than a simple glamour.”
“You don’t know the half of it.”
Adam’s hand rests on his shoulder, fingers curling over a spot that doesn’t belong to him. When other people touched it, his skin crawled. Itched like fire ants crawled and bit. It’s the opposite feeling, with Adam’s hand. As if Dean’s soul breached through the shadows and filled him with so much light, he could overpower the sun. But only one other person has ever made him feel like that…
Cas moans when Calvin doubles his pace, biting a healthy bruise onto his neck. He claws at Calvin’s scalp while watching the beads of precome leak out of his cockhead. Calvin rolls his palm on it, gliding across Cas’s shaft now.
before.
to be a monster, once he’s old enough?”
Dean will rise. Gather what little he, Sam, and Jack have and rush at Chuck until there truly is nothing left. Of this world. Or of them. But that’s later.
“You are experiencing feelings as well?”
“Institute for Conscious Repair of the Human Soul? Ring any bells?” He taps some of his ash onto the floor, jabbing the air with his cigarette. “You seriously didn’t catch on in the first few minutes what their whole operation was really about? How stupid
On a past post-it note, Cas recalls reading about ‘Operation Carnation’. Cas shuffles backwards while dragging the box from its hiding spot, flipping the lid off.
Cas blinked, “Me? No… but I am due for some cash.”
Mia, however, accepted that.
“Cas, man, if there were don’t you think we’d be smoking it already?”
demise I wrote myself into another problem – again, because of you!”
Claire was the easier of the two to track. He finds her on a balcony, chatting with another girl. Her braided hair interspersed with flowers, plainly dressed in a white t-shirt and ragged jeans. “Claire,” he says, leaning through the entryway, “Claire, we need to go.”
“It’s nothing,” he says, looking out the window, “just… you better be there when I finally come to tomorrow, s’all. Claire, keep an eye on her.”
“They are, are they?” he asks, “Do you love me?”
“Not me.”
until a familiar cough startles him from his shock. Cas crushes the book, spinning on his heel. Dean catching him red-handed. “Um…”
present away for your birthday.” Expression schooled into strenuous thought, he continues, “When
Dean eyes him, staring as if he searches for something to scrutinize. Castiel hopes he doesn’t find the cracks in his mask. Unable to find anything, Dean shrugs and casts his gaze elsewhere. “Well, um,” he says, “Land?”
“How can you be better in such a broken system.”
“I’ll be careful with her.”
been attending a shit-ton of meetings, for research.
“Dean –“
In the next instant, walls reform. Frighteningly more sophisticated than the ones Cas has experience butting up against. Dean snatches the flyer from his grasp, despite Cas’s protests. “This is nothing,” he says, tearing into the paper with reckless precision. Not stopping until the shreds littered their feet. “Just hippie mumbo jumbo. I figured your brain hadn’t rotted enough that you’d fall for cheap tricks like this.”
“About five stories.”
Sergei wakes from his trance, shifting his stance so his feet are spaced a few inches further apart. “Cas,” he hums, Russian accent thick as he is, “always to the point with you, eh? Wonder if you square masquerading as hippie…”
would be helpful?”
He snaps the file closed, and then presses the edge of it against his lips. Sighing, Castiel retakes his seat. Bones creaking when he sinks into it. “I’m sorry,” Cas says, “but I don’t do missing persons. Too messy –“
Cas ignores the little flip of his stomach, brushing off Dean’s muttered response. “God, I wish I had a camera…”
“At least there’s something rattling around in that head of yours…” Cas folded his arms and waited for a more helpful comment. Crowley ran his hands across his face before taking a fresh joint and lighting it. “You need an appointment, Castiel. An appointment which… I could get you, if I knew where it is you were going?”
Ted chuckles, “Very much horse behind the plow.” He looks at the door again, playing with the files. “It was so weird seeing him… I knew it was going downhill – not just with his job but with his family, too. And those… those freaks saw it as an opportunity to turn his thinking inside out. Ruined his life. I mean now he’s like any of those kids you can find loitering and being burdens on all of us!”
“…Let me check what I’ve got on tap.”
“You’d never believe me if I told you how you acted once you sobered.”
Crowley, in his dirty, wrecked suit, sullenly poked the kindling with a knife Bobby must have given him. He hadn’t moved since Mary closed her eyes; however, he appeared more disgruntled than she remembered. An agonized expression carved into his soot-covered face. She might hazard a guess on what caused it, attention flitting from him to the last member of their party.
“Nonsense, Dean,” Castiel hushes him, “Stop joking and get the car started or I’ll eat all the pie myself.”
“No you have not.”
Her eyes dart from him to Dean, bouncing like a beach ball over a net. Spiked, it landed on Cas. “It wasn’t me,” she tells him, “I… they always said it was a necessary part of the ritual, but even when I believed I… it never seemed right.”
Mia sighed. Those hinges called for her. They warned that someone might take advantage of her open front door to come do harm.
Dean refused to comment on Sam’s teasing, sinking into his seat again while his mind processed this new information. Cas joined him, continually rubbing soothing circles into his back. Sam sat next to Jack, across from them. Jack, sullenly tracing the cracks Dean made in his phone screen, asked, “Does this mean I’m not banned from TikTok?”
“Shit…” Dean hisses, rubbing his throbbing head, willing its silence so he can think. He gets one minutes. He uses it wisely, handing Baby’s keys to Sam. “Take ‘em.”
“Well, you didn’t give me any…”
the party would be?”
This time, it’s rewarded. “I was a teenager, y’know,” Dean scoffs, “with too much shit on my shoulders. If I wanted to not think about it all for a while I… I’d bum a special ciggie every now and then, when I could, from passing beatniks. Didn’t make a habit out of it.”
“Don’t you have a family?” Dean asks, “A home? Wouldn’t your time be better spent with them instead of me – a
But they weren’t talking about Steve. Why did he think of Steve? “Trevor?” Dean repeated, still unsure what Sam’s flailing meant.
“That’s… really sad,” Dean tells him, “I couldn’t even imagine… at least when my ma was alive she and dad were the real deal. I always knew that if I were going to get married that I’d want it to be with someone I love.”
They don’t talk during the short trip from the front of the building, past the row of garbage cans and the dumpster reeking of two-day old milk, and while climbing the worn side steps and into his office.
That’s the most intimate he’s ever been with another man.
?” Lucifer savors the taste of his brother’s name, drenched in sadness. Ripped from Dean’s heart in a barely controlled sob.
On the amulet that he wears. Stolen from
“Nah, nah… ours is just called God. Well, my family called him that... or her. Other people have different names for them.”
It’s everything Dean wanted. Except he couldn’t handle it.
Cas swallows the immediate thoughts that emerge. Those traitorous voices expressing similar sentiment, nasally and grating like
“At least we died fighting, then.”
, he can leave if he wants.” Dean glances at Cas, surprising him with the softness in his gaze, “Is that what you want?”
Closing the fridge, Dean saunters over to Castiel. His hand hovers near the crook of his elbow, fingers twitching like they do when he holds his gun.“Why did you need to ‘
She sticks her hand inside, flower stem clutched tight within her fist. Her eyes dully bore into his, like nothing sparks under their shallow surface. “Flower?” she asks.
“Relax Dean,” Adam croons, lighting one of the many candles that surrounds the room. Interspersed with crystals, totems, and an incense stick that suspiciously smells like a VW van at a concert. “This is going to be a
“We did?”
“And you’ve had girlfriends,” Dean reminded him, “Hell, you and Jess only broke up about a month ago! Did
“I wouldn’t say that,” Castiel starts, hands lain flat against the table, “It is worrisome, yes, given we don’t know what a nephilim without a soul can do. But since we’re aware that this is a possibility we can monitor appropriately and handle it.”
“I had no idea the market for low-cost meal options was that large over in Europe,” Ted says, pitched so far forward in his seat Cas wonders how he stays upright, “In nothing I’ve read could any expert have predicted this.”
!” he adds, stealing Cas’s first retort from him.
“From how Gordon put it, those were reserved for the most
Soon enough, Dean can swim without aid. Castiel lets go, Dean’s arms shooting out to the side almost immediately. It’s a strange sight, but Castiel shrugs at his choice. Whatever helps him stay upright.
Jack agreed with him, and after writing a short little piece where Castiel decorates his room he and his father went on a shopping trip that ended with two dripping ice cream cones and a packed trunk.
“Yeah,” Nick snarls, “What? Was that your friend?”
“Paying for pictures?” Dean asked, nose scrunched in distaste, “Like… dirty pictures?”
“Never mind, let’s get up.” Dean pushes Castiel off of him, standing once more. He offers his hand to Castiel, helping him up. Wobbling on his new legs, Castiel manages to stay upright for a beat before falling into Dean’s waiting arms.
Bristling, Dean shifts as if to raise his head again. Adam shoves at Dean, keeping him there. Adds an ounce of pressure that should stoke his anger. However, Dean responds with no retaliation. Stills, and when Adam removes his hand, continues talking. “I made these decisions,” Dean tells Adam, “I… there were a lot of expectations, being me. People I couldn’t disappoint. If they knew I went to get… massages, by
,” he tells Cas, poking him again. “So, please? For me?”
– no homosexuality intended.” Standing, Sam moves over towards the fridge and opens it. He finds the package of bacon easily, Jack moving it to the center. Ripping it open, Sam grabs a pan and slaps a few strips onto it.
Scrubbing his hands down his face, Jack collapses onto his bed with a sigh. “Why couldn’t there have been more tips on how to do this?”
Castiel can tell Dean considers his meal very carefully, bubbles practically spilling out from his ears. A gurgle interrupts his contemplation, and Castiel knows what his decision will be. “Well,” Dean sighs, “guess sushi ain’t the
“…your parents, they’re the ones who are forcing all this, dig?...”
“And I didn’t think you were the type of man who approaches other men in dark alley ways, Dean,” Cas tells him, “so I guess we’re both trying new things today.”
“Night, Cas.”
“I may have asked Serafina to give me a jumpstart while we were there,” he admits. “Not too much though, I want to see for myself, sit with it. Decide which length I like it at.” His eyes glow, calm expression breaking into something more joyful. “Dude, I almost forgot – Cas! Hey, Cas!”
“If I were any braver I would go out and find myself a girl to have the sex with,” Sam sighs, “But I am a lowly moose… not as good-looking or charming as you, Jack.”
, I will be exercising my rights to not have my afternoon fucked up because of regular police incompetence. I hope
for. A hero’s sacrifice, staying behind in Purgatory? For penance? You don’t decide your fate –
The door opens, and suddenly the voices louden; target coming into sight. Dean barely glances up from his notepad, an air of stiff boredom hanging around him. Expression masked with the same coating that hides the pigs behind their special fencing. “Cas-tee-el Novak…” Dean drawls, finally deigning Cas with his attention, “Your parents knew you’d end up a hippie freak and helped the process along or did you come up with this name after a bad trip?”
If he keeps winning arguments in their relationship, he might need newer hats. Already the straw fedora he wore seemed tighter than yesterday, a small migraine forming at the base of his skull from an expanded ego. Intensified as Dean steps out, too, slamming the door behind him.
“Know him?” he scoffs, folding himself into a lotus position on his seat, “I
than Barbie’s boy toy. In the end, of all his fantasies, he never pegged Dean as a suburbanite. It seemed too…
He pauses, squeezing the back of the chair for strength. Pulling from the script of an old memory, Jack asks Castiel, “Are
“They were my patients,” she said, “They’re
Sam finds him there, exasperated and tired. He collapses on the chair across from him.
His heart lurches. “Can’t really go anywhere, now can I?”
“Dean, I made sure that Sam made sandwiches for you.”
“Sounds like a fucking scam job,” Victor says, drawing Cas’s focus, “if you ask me.”
“It’s improper,” he explains.
Strategically avoiding the front door, Cas navigates the Kline household until he is at the sliding back door again. He leaps across the threshold, rushing towards the fence. Cas presses himself against it, listening to the other side.
“I mean, I’ve only just met the man,” Claire says, “seems like a fucking stickler, but Cas brought him on… that’s gotta count for something.” She nudges the other girl, chuckling. “Besides, my uncle’s got him wrapped around his little pinky. All bark, but there’s no sharp teeth waiting.”
She nodded, hauling herself off the fallen log she slept against. Bobby dropped in response, taking her station. “I’ll wake you when it’s time to head out. Sweet dreams.”
Cas soaks up her reserved fury. Shown only through clenched teeth and a hardened stare. The wounds Dick caused, though years-old, never healed. And Cas flayed them open with his callous stumbling. He knows the window on their meeting closes faster with each passing second.
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
He reaches the sofa, pressing a sloppy kiss at her knee. “Yes,” he says, slipping into Emmanuel’s voice.
“I will,” Adam promises, drifting closer, “Along with your sides… your back… anywhere I believe you might need.” He brushes featherlight fingers across his chin, a scant distance from actually touching it. Lips stretched in a lazy smile. “If it’ll make you more comfortable, though, I’ll look away while you get settled.”
“This
“You really want your coworkers seeing you dressed like this? Explain to them
“Yes, I…” He flustered, glancing away, “I missed him.”
It’s not like Dean’s opinion on his lifestyle meant much. Hearing those words – choosing him – doesn’t diminish the overall effect.
“Whatever,” he says, “I’m not mad.” He was
Dean sighed, pinching Jack’s cheek. “He’s dressed as Harrison’s Ford’s character from Working Girl.” His costume took the longest to sew, suits – especially baby suits – being difficult and above Dean’s skill level. It looked halfway decent, however. Even if Dean spent the past week on alterations.
“Then you certainly aren’t straight.”
“Um… good? I guess? Like any other massage.”
Castiel waits for the former human to answer with what he hopes is a non-threatening smile. His expression doesn’t seem to aid in easing the new merman into their body. As the silence drags on Castiel notices the other’s tail flap ever more erratically.
“So we’re getting dinner now, too?” Cas asked, smiling too much for there to be any skepticism left, “You think Sam won’t be curious why we’re gone for so long?”
“I would’ve waited,” Dean reveals, helping Cas with his clothes as Cas guides Dean’s legs out of his slacks. “Everyone knows how long I’ve waited to tell you I love you… I would’ve waited, even if we died and we had to get married in heaven.” Dean pecks Cas’s lips, divesting him of both jackets and his button-down shirt. “I’m glad we didn’t have to, though.”
wanted to, but I… I kept telling myself I was holding out for the perfect girl. One like my ma… basically chasing ghosts like my dad, avoiding the truth.”
Cas thought Jack finally got bored. Realized hanging around an old hippie like him became bothersome. That he found better options for how he spent his time…
In the reflection of his rearview mirror, the black car inches out of its space.
Cas scoffs, sitting on his haunches. “Not what I was here for but also not shocked how that’s the first thing you thought of.” He digs for the slide in his pocket, “I actually wanted some info about a woman you were acquainted with years ago. Does the name Kelly Kline ring any bells?” Flashing the slide close enough Nick’s eyes go cross-eyed staring at it, Cas studies him for a sign. Hearing Kelly’s name makes his Adam’s apple throb with a heavy swallow.
Cas raises a brow. “I want to light a fucking joint and get so fucking stoned I forget any of this fuckery ever happened.” Andy agrees wholeheartedly, both men climbing into Andy’s van to access their stash. Roll a few papers, light a flame under the stub, and Cas is off.
“Then I
“So,” Cas prompts, placing a now empty glass on the counter, “who fired the first shot?”
“Don’t need to give me nothing, man,” Calvin squeezes his cock, grinning when Cas stutters on a moan, “relax, and let me
Jack clears his throat, interrupting them. “I… I can explain.”
plans for the future at my office,” Cas says, “about not going to college or getting a job.”
Whether Dean followed him there or it was the universe shooting him the middle finger, Cas will not entertain any further thoughts of the case for now. Otherwise he might fully succumb to its horrifying tides.
. Almost broke my bobby picking this lock…” Claire taps her chin, thinking. “You could try the bathrooms?”
Since then Cas swung by when necessary, continually collecting on that favor.
“You’re right, I wasn’t,” Cas continues, “but you were. And I’m sure that the angle you can provide will better contextualize the story and – ultimately – decide how the world will view Dick Roman.”
Dean opens one eye, and all the staunched apprehension attacks, swallowing him whole. He steadies, bashfully staring at the floor. Overthinking every flick of his wrist and step. The smile on Cas’s face falls, seeing how those nasty flies buzz around Dean’s head. Biting, waking him from his dream-like state. “We…” Dean starts, clearing his throat, “we should probably get to it… shouldn’t we?”
you have?”
“Probably don’t make enough to qualify for ‘em…
Cas raises an expectant brow, a tiny ache bubbling inside his head. “Really? Nothing at all?”
Nick sighs, pinching his nose. “Look, I didn’t know he was…” He glosses over the word, reigniting Cas’s rage once more. “Did he send you here, then? Revenge? Get the full story?”
“Please…” Dean says, hiding his face behind his knees. Arms circled around his legs, curled into a ball. “Stop talking.”
“…Cas?” Dean’s voice sounded scratchy, raw, like a needle ripped through a spinning record. He blinked back his tears, embarrassed, because Cas might wake soon and see him break, see him not be strong enough. His gaze broke from Cas’s bluing lips, staring at the starless sky above. He saw night begin its transition to early morning, a sun sliver dipping into the horizon, and wondered how long Cas will play with him like this. How long will Cas pretend to lie there? How long will Cas insist that he’s –
She giggles, flipping her hair off her shoulder. “Like I didn’t already know that?” Claire reaches for the doorknob, stopping only because Cas grabs her wrist. “What?”
“Really?” Jack says, “Then those pictures of him at conventions… I expected God to be quite taller.”

“Come from a large family?”
“The same man who, on his birthday, said,” Cas drifts closer, helping Dean unbutton his shirt, “and I quote, ‘
“Because…” It’s a bad idea. He recognizes how bad an idea this is. However, recognition and action are completely separate. And while he succeeds in the former, he fails spectacularly with the latter. “I’m not gay.” Then, slurring, he whisper-shouts, “I’m
answer calls?”
Dean places a hand on his shoulder. “My mom died young, too,” he tells him, “a little after Sammy… it’s been just him and me, and my dad… plus Uncle Bobby.”
Desk unattended, Cas learns why his visit was interrupted. “If he thinks I’ll blow him after this…”
He stuffs the envelope in the pillow and leaves it. Kicks the pooling mess of Jack’s things back into the closet, Panavue included. Cas scurries out of Jack’s room and closes the door behind him.
this is.
“Cram it philosophy major,” Dean says, turning the key, “We’re here.”
While unappreciative of his tone, Kelly does as asked. Leans on his desk, her eyes closed in thought. As he waits, Cas picks up the dried toilet paper ball of blood. Walks it to his toilet and flushes it away. Over the sound of flushes, he hears her gasp, “He mentioned something.”
is sounding the alarm you’re blocked.”
“Oh it would,” she tells him, “but it wasn’t exactly what he fed me and everyone else.” Kaia dips her head, close enough Cas can hear her whispering through grit teeth. “It must’ve been fate. I didn’t mean to, but I found myself in his secret meditation room, I… he preaches to us, about how we need to let go of all Earthly tethers. Connect with the infinite, to prepare for when he would ask of his children to make great sacrifices. We hardly slept, and when we did it was on hardwood floors – one blanket between five people. Days either filled with tasks or meditation, barely any time for food. And no modern conveniences because they led us astray from the pure path. And we did all that, without asking any questions. But we should have. Like why the fuck did he have a telephone in his private chambers? A safe, and a box with rabbit ears poking out the top? Not what you’d expect to aid with centering yourself in the universe…”
The word
“Do you want me to stay here?” he asks, face blank in practiced seriousness, “Wait for nightfall, then scamper my way back to my pad, preserving this air of conformity you’ve mastered over the years?”
“Coincidences…” he whispers, “More and more coincidences…”
Sam surrendered without a fight here, too. He chose his battles and could see how meaningless it’d be to press now. He filed this away, though, to use for a later date.
Mia’s lips thinned in response, the only cue she gave for Dean to keep talking.
Claire leans forward, grinning, “Can I have some -?”
“There’s always adoption.” Dean stops, nervously glancing over at Castiel. “I… I should have asked, first. Is there like… anything
“If he is, it’s not like he can chase us down.”
“I do?”
Jack groaned, scrubbing his face with twitching fingers. “They
Sam chuckles from the backseat. “Sure you can follow through on that promise, Dean?”
“Stop, stop,” Castiel says, “Are humans lazy?”
“I was thinking about what you said during our… session,” he mumbled, “about
“The feelings, I…” Dean struggles, “It’s crazy, I shouldn’t… I don’t know why –“
Andy leans into the empty space Cas abandoned, yelling, “She’s hot, man! Nice score!”
Hope y'all enjoy!!
“I…” He can be, if he says so. Unfortunately, Dean forgets those little magic words. Trapped in limbo, the space between truths. “I’m not… I don’t know.”
Dean… day by day.” Cas kneels, pressing a thumb against his chin. “You’re right, I can’t be certain about the future. None of us can, not anymore. But, before Chuck, all I saw was bleakness. Now that he’s gone… after every hardship we’ve been through, the clouds have parted. It finally looks bright. And we could have a thousand more days or one more day, but in this moment Dean I want to experience
? They already have, before he walked onto the dance floor.
“Wow, playing up the paranoid hippie act aren’t you?” She sighed, rolling her eyes. “Fine, you can always call my boss at the paper. He can vouch for me.”
Dean crosses his arms, not meeting Cas’s eyes. “I
“I wish,” Dean says, “but Sammy was so whammied by that cult, he didn’t
Sam nods, returning to his porn. A loud rumble disrupts his reading, and he frowns at his stomach. “I am hungry,” he announces, slapping the magazine open on the table.
Cas leans across the table, resting his chin on his knuckles. Blinks innocently up at Dean while an imaginary tail curls around his midsection. “Really? You never…” He darts his gaze quickly behind Dean, cheeks straining from the wideness of his smile. “You can be honest with me, Dean.
Dean follows, saving his protests for when they reach Cas’s bug. “Rainbow?” he asks, shoving, “That the best you could come up with?”
were the ones who fought the most, at it almost every night until Sam moved out. There were other things he and I didn’t agree on… but we kind of let it drift, better to not speak about it than bring it up and ruin a day. Although maybe that’s why we haven’t been talking for awhile…” Dean looks lost, unsure of what to say next. He already seemed surprised to have shared as much as he did.
Suddenly his hand dips when it reaches the end, the paper pavement stopping short. Grazing a foreign object, Cas wraps his hands around the thin object and pulls it up.
“Listen,” she hisses, facing him. A hand curled around his shirt, tugging him closer. “I’m not interested. And if you’re smart, you’ll vanish –
Castiel drifts over to the anemone, gesturing to it. “This is our bed.”
Cas smiled, places a feather-light kiss against her chin. “I dig. Even if we never have sex again, I enjoy being your friend.” He did, and still does. Because Meg has a special talent understanding his scattered thoughts better than he ever could.
about you being a loser, but I never really meant it…”
“Hey,” he grumbles, “What do you think you’re doing?”
Dean smiles, tapping at his temple with his free hand. Communicating as best he could his final wish. Castiel understands easily.
Dumping those, he scrubs tiredly at his cheeks before gathering the remaining few. Thankfully, the next slide tells him more.
“A new path?” Cas asks, tilting his head to the side, “He move onto new business? How that possible when this has his name?”
… things might not have been the same.”
“Am I supposed to feel anything

gave him just to get him out of our hairs. We sure were glad when the last check went out.”
“This whole patch of land belongs to this kook named Creaser,” she explains as the last house on the block ends, miles of greenery stretching far on either side, “and in the center, is where the party’s at.”
Charles makes his trident flash, stunning Castiel’s attempts. “Castiel, let the boy speak!”
“I’m gonna be grounded for the next month,” Claire spits through a mouthful of corn puffs, “you still owe
Castiel nods.
It’s been too long since he and Cas touched like that. Circling, never committing. Losing before the game starts.
know that?”
Dean chuckles, shoving at Castiel’s shoulder. “Dean’s already short enough…” He glances at him from out the corner of his eye. “So we’re not going to talk about where you just went?”
“Who? Cole?” Eve laughs, staring at Cole with hunger in her eyes. She licks her lips, red paint undisturbed. “He’s not company – he’s my gardener.”
“Nope! No wife,” Dean cuts in too quickly, blushing, “I mean – I wouldn’t… wives and me don’t mix. Kinda not interested in their whole… deal…”
“What’s he like?”
Dean allows a brief show of vulnerability, burdening Cas’s rejection. Then he squares his shoulders, usual mask slipping over the shards of his expression. “Figure you’d at least ask me to be better than what I was.”
First, he searches for Jack. The younger boy leans across from Dean, waiting. Curious.
“Come on, Cas,” Dean mumbled, pushing hair behind his ears with twitching fingers, “you gonna say something or what?”
either…”
Dean snorts, and then hides his amusement behind some light coughing when the envoys from the capital among capitals turn their ire towards him.
Even being unknowingly helpful, Dean makes Cas’s search difficult. “Couldn’t have written directions? Or be more specific?” He stops when he reaches the section for misdemeanors, only possible destination that ‘
“Like, security?”
all these people?”
Enjoy!
“Timeout there,” Lucifer smirks, eyes glowing red. Reflection of Dean’s entire face, blood rapidly swelling his cheeks. “Don’t want to do anything you’ll regret…” He holds Dean there, frozen, waits until the other man seems calm. Dips his head, tries catching Dean’s gaze. “If I let you go, will you behave?” Dean remains silent, yet Lucifer hears him. Tunes into his frequency, actively sifting through his frenzied emotions. “Seriously,” he lets Dean go, hunter falling on his ass, “how are we supposed to work as a team if you’re not willing to cooperate?”
if you think I’m going to some school on the
“Nostalgia? Sentimentality? A reminder that it wasn’t all too bad,” she says, smiling, “It was the month before the fall semester, and I invited him to my parents’ property out there for the week. Being there… that was where I started thinking we were serious. One night we laid a blanket on the ground and spent the night counting constellations, and then we…” Blushing, she stutters over the implication. “It was part of a bunch of stuff of mine my parents kept tucked away in their attic. And I only got access to
“So what?” Dean chimed in, “This was some cosmic joke, then? Have her kick up some dust long enough we form a connection with her, fill in a few blanks, and then poof? She’s no longer needed?”
But that spiral won’t get him anywhere fast.
“We schedule another time then.” Cas stands, gathering his things. “Secretary call secretary and set things up.”
Sam entered the kitchen, Cas at his side with a tome held open in his hands. Their conversation withered as they took in the scene they walked in on. “Hey,” Sam said, shuffling his way to them, “what’s going on?”
Saving his work, Jack puts off the idea of posting his story to find his father. Last he saw of Castiel - which was days ago - he was in the library. He starts there. Jack jumps from his room to the library, calling for his angelic father. While Castiel was somewhere else, it wasn't empty. Sam stood at one of the shelves in a weird daze, fingers trailing along the spines of a row of books.
Dean and Cas share a silent conversation. He grins from that, knowing he can tilt his head or flutter his lashes and be understood completely. “Okay,” Dean answers, “it’s not like there’s anything else we
Roman Ventures competed with hippies for fair use of real estate, rolling over art with their cookie cutter advertising. Spouting off about their excellent team of investors guided in a mission to help clients hoard their money smartly, spearheaded by a stock market guru who capitalism spit from her womb like he was Venus emerging from the shell.
“And here I was just starting to enjoy it.” Cas mocks, spraying sand with a lazy kick, “Well? Got any remedies for it, then? A crystal, a chant… more drugs?”
Dean and Sam stiffen at the word, glancing between each other. Sam frowns at him, “We have… how do you know about it?”
Whatever she wanted he’d give her, no problem. One day she brings in this band, asking if they can stay in this old guest house they have. Bats her eyes, teases her skirt… of course Creaser gives the okay. After that, a whole bunch of those artist types started cycling through. He becomes some sort of
Sighing, Dean turns his head. “This is a pretty swanky neighborhood,” he says, looking out the window, “you sure they’d let your kind throw a party here?”
? Then I’m having this baby, whether you want it or not.”
Cas looks out the window, spies inside
Scintillating conversation with as much weight as the smoke billowing up from the joints being passed around. Sweet grass smell wafts everywhere, amplifying the traces already clinging to his clothes. His fingers twitch for another joint, but he stays focused. If he lit up now, the glassy eyes that were ignoring him would dart in his direction. Annoying him, asking for a hit. Cas preferred them as they were. Their lazy defiance of the status quo familiar and ordinary.
. A few days later, the first death happened…” She sucked on the cigarette a final time, discarding it into the soot-covered fireplace beside her. “Since then it’s been the same thing over and over. I leave, find somewhere new to practice, he somehow finds me, then finds out who my patients are, and kills them until I start this fucked-up process over again.”
Anyone who settled here long ago cut the string on that carrot. Half of the buildings in the area are filled with squatters who don’t pay for rent on top of everything else, letting the vacationers who use the rooms two weeks out of the year cover it. In Cas’s apartment complex, he is a rare species of tenent who rents and actually uses the space all-year round. A pity for management when they sweep up the trash every so often and find that they cannot legally kick him to the curb like a few
Meg printed her story. Front page, like she knew it would. And because of the story the company that she assassinated settled with the environmental group by firing the heads responsible for breaking the law. Cas read all this in her article, including the little section thanking Clarence Harris for his help in breaking the story.
“No, but she’s got the address… and she’d only tell me if I let her come.” He leaves, ducking so they were at eye-level. “Now it shouldn’t take too long. Just don’t say anything unprompted and we’ll be there for barely a second.”
That’s… a
“Fine,” he decided, standing, too, “you want supportive? Then I’m coming with you.”
“Not exactly… may I come inside?”
“You don’t know how happy I am to hear you say that,” Dean sighs, kissing him. “God, Cas, I love you so much.”
, okay? But I’m trying. Remember that bi flag pin I wore during that hunt one time? That was me…
“A cop?” Claire asks. Her glare doubles, scorching a hole into Dean’s headrest. “You’ve got a cop watching your back? What’s to say he won’t turn on you?”
“Me?” He laughed, a nicer sound than all the others, “No, given how they acted a little steam is justified. We can keep this between you and me.”
“Actually, experience.”
“It’s okay,” Cas shrugs, producing his own lighter, “I can do my own.” She flicks the flame off and grabs the feather duster again.
… get them?”
“Maybe,” she shrugs, barely an inch of space between their noses, “but I have no control over that. Smells are upper management concerns. My job is making pretty with the prudish squares who stop by and sell them junk that’ll give ‘em a taste other than vanilla.”
“Cali…fornia?”
“I will take your word for it,” he tells Andy, keeping a critical gaze on Cas. Skin crawling from the intense focus, like it’s being flayed by untampered thought. “I do not see him enough to pass judgment on what is his ‘normal’. But then again – what is normal? Can there truly be an agreed-upon definition for the word? Or are we all doing what we can to live by our own ‘normal’?”
There’s still some fight left in him. “Why should I?”
almost like I wasn’t there. Like I’d never been there. Nothing I did mattered… and I was just a
Charles clears his throat, turning to Dean. “You, human –“
What did you think? I'd love to hear - especially about who Mia shifted into. I think that would have been a better way to bring JDM back then the Lebanon episode, at least it would have made more sense lol.
“Not much,” Sam shrugs, “There is a stack more of these waiting for me –“ he waves the magazine – “and I might go watch a few videos, too, so I can jerk it.”
Dean roots around his jacket pocket, uncovering the mixtape he made Cas. He pocketed it, refusing to let it burn with the rest of his angel. However, holding it in his hands then, Dean knew he could never listen to it, nor any of those songs contained within, anymore. He saved the mixtape for this moment. Dean digs a small grave for his ‘Top Traxx’, placing it inside and covering his work with a sweep of his hands.
scammed bigoted jerks for all they had? Scamming definitely feels like something that’s for gays only.”
“So’s most of the things I do. I stopped counting after a while…” He softens somewhat, tide of his indignation ebbing. “If it makes you feel better, I also fuck women.”
He pulls the curtains back, reverting to his previous form. Delights in how Dean senses the change, peeking with one eye as Castiel’s face vanishes. The other man violently hurls himself to the side, gaping at him. “Why Dean,” Lucifer grins, awkwardness heavy in his tone, “if I had known that’s how you felt about
“Really? What for?”
Dean glances at the file, then at Kaia. Cracks forming on the file from how tight his grip is. He doesn’t open it. Cas, distracted by his discovery, rounds on Kaia. “Your foster mother said you left a message for her the day of your disappearance, but the cops chalked most of what you said as some bad trip.”
As Cas stands under the doorway, silent save for the rhythmic crinkling of a note in his fist, he’s hit with a sudden, rare thought.
Feeling satisfied with his filled search bar, Jack hits enter and stumbles down a rabbit hole of his own design.
“Oh, so you’re against mating rituals,” Castiel surmises, “I happen to agree with you. They’re so ancient… having your spouse picked out for you based on breeding and class, being told who to spend your life with –“
he hears a knock on the door. “Come in!”
Dean dropped his cigarette, startled by the command. He looked from the older policeman, and then to Cas. “I… I have to go.”
“Well then why don’t you three pick up the pace already!”
Nick falls into deathly silence, hand cupped around his nose slacking and falling to the side. “W-what?”
He shrugs, scowling. “Nah, detectives are too stuck up. M’more like a private eye meets investigator, and sometimes I do freelance photography on the side. But they wouldn’t let me put all of that on a business card, and I hate business cards…” Cas leaves again. This time he hears her a few paces behind him.
Before they gathered themselves and decided to hit the road again, the sun was about to rise. Dean fell asleep for a while and Cas hasn’t had the heart to wake him.
“Are you hurt?” Castiel asked, eyeing Dean.
All of them took it pretty hard. But Cas… Cas was Jack’s father. Jack’s relationship with him was different, stronger, than with the brothers. And so Cas couldn’t let it go, even for a second. He needed to find a way.
“Nothing.” Dean said with a pointed glare in his brother’s direction. Then he put a hand around Cas’ shoulders, and Sam snickered. It was a little ridiculous, he had to admit. He had literally no reason to be jealous. After everything they've been through, it was quite obvious. Still, you can't control your emotions all that much. Besides, he had a right to be a little jealous, right? He hadn’t been in an actual relationship for so long he almost forgot what that’s like.
He went back to the diner and saw Cas wiping tables.
“Just… stuff.” Dean shrugged, averting his eyes. He felt Cas shift and lie on the pillow next to him. “And… I think we should move.” he said so quickly he wasn’t sure even he heard himself correctly. There was silence, so he peeked at Cas, who was looking back at him. “Cas?”
Enjoy ❤️
Dean and Cas started acting like a married couple, even more than they already were. And they would never really talk about it, but they knew that they were together and that they're gonna sleep in one bed from now on. And it wouldn’t really change their lives or affect their hunts. As human Cas would learn to believe when Dean would say that he needs him. He would start to feel important and necessary and like he matters. Because of Dean. Because he did matter to Dean.
Anyway, we're at 20 o.o And I have a lot more already written and I am so surprised I stuck to this lmao (I think once I write all of them I'll try posting more often than once a week, but there's still a long way haha)
“I don’t think it was stupid. It was worth it.” Cas said, quieter. “You should know that you were worth it, Dean."
Cas, of course, kissed Dean back, and when they pulled away, both of them were smiling, although Cas was a little confused. That was the first time ever that Dean kissed him in public.
Those words echoed through his head. He didn’t understand… Cas was dead, wasn’t he? Did Jack bring him back? What was going on?
“Well, duh.” she said, laughing again. “Gimme” she took the spliff from his hand, smoking it instantly.
Benny and Charlie were already out the door, with shoes and jackets on. They were laughing about something on the staircase.
“Yeah, ‘course.” Dean laughed. “I’ll give you a call.”
"I asked Cas out." he said to himself. He pulled the number out of his pocket, as he didn't change before sleep, and just stared at it for some time. "And he said yes. Fuck me.” he covered his face with his hand, still not believing that it actually happened. But he knew it did. He didn’t remember much of last night, but he definitely remembered his talk with Cas.
Then the waitress came to take their orders, and apparently as Dean was staring adoringly at Cas, Jack and Sam also decided what they wanted to eat. As they were waiting for the food, talking a bit, Dean sat closer to Cas, their knees touching.
“I thought so too. But this… this is a bunker. For hunters, and research, and books about monsters, and all that stuff. And I think I want to spend the rest of my life peacefully, you know? No hunting.” he admitted, both to Cas, and to himself. He wanted to retire. More than he thought he did. “And Sam seems to enjoy running this whole hunter network or whatever he calls it. And he has Eileen. So we’re not really… needed. Here.” he bit his lip nervously, while Cas seemed surprised.
It was so fun to write it all, and each kudos and comment really motivated me, even when I was running out of ideas or had a writer's block hah
“Dude, are you giving me a hickey?” now he just laughed, feeling Cas suck on his skin. It wasn’t an unpleasant or unknown feeling, but it also wasn’t exactly what they usually did, so he was surprised.
All four of them were sitting around a table, in a bar, dressed in suits. Dean and Cas on one side of the table, Jack and Sam opposite them. They were holding bottles of beer, and seemed very relaxed and happy, which was quite unusual for them. For once, there was no threat of the world ending, and they could just do what they normally did. Hunt things and save people.
For Cas it was amazing. He’s less experienced than Dean when it comes to sexual relations, so he was more shy and awkward. But Dean was gentle and he was always making sure that Cas is okay. Maybe a car wasn’t the most romantic scenery, but they both couldn’t imagine better one. It's the Impala, Dean's Baby. Of course it was the best place for their first kiss and first time.
“And all kinds of bullets? Iron, silver, all that stuff? And salt? And-?” he felt himself start to ramble, because while his Baby’s trunk was full of useful weapons, Cas used to rely almost fully on his angel blade and his powers, that he didn’t have anymore, so he tried to equip him as well as he could.
“Like he would even dare to try.” Dean scoffed, but pulled out his wallet to settle the bill, and, just to be safe, looked out the window to make sure his car was still there. Cas just smiled at him, intertwining their fingers as they were leaving. On their way, Dean smiled at the waitress, who immediately looked away. And his humor was much better again. Who knew that all he needed to be truly happy was Cas?
Enjoy♥
So, again, thank you all soooo much ❤️
"Sorry, buddy, but I had to wake you." Dean said quietly, more amused than anything else. "I'm cold and you were hogging the blanket and I'm too lazy to get out of bed."
Cas just looked at him for a moment, and then, without a warning, he smashed his lips into Dean’s. It was unexpected. And aggressive. And Dean hesitated for a second, but then he was kissing Cas back. Dean figured, he needed some kind of comfort, and if this was the way to give it to him, he really wasn’t complaining. Although that was not exactly how either of them imagined doing this.
“Yeah. Duh. Did you think I want to live with my brother for the rest of my life?” Dean chuckled. Cas shrugged. “So. What do you think? We can find some small, old, run-down house. And renovate it together. And make it truly our home.” he took Cas’ hand into his. “Do you wanna get a house and spend the rest of our lives with me there?” he added a little shyly, his tone half teasing. Because it sounded ridiculous. Dean Winchester and a former angel of the Lord playing house together? His life was insane.
So Dean decided to check on Cas.
Enjoy ❤️
He left a soft kiss on Dean's perfect lips and watched the hunter sleep the whole night. And again, maybe that was creepy, but he had the right to do it now. To watch over
It was also cold. But not like ‘low temperature’ cold, more like the atmosphere just wasn’t what a home should be. It was empty. Even though he was there with his family, sometimes he would feel lonely just because of how… unwelcoming the bunker seemed now. It wasn’t homey or cosy or warm, like a home should be. It was not supposed to be a home, after all.
Lately, Dean’s been happy. Almost giddy. For once, everything was going fine, they stopped the end of the world, again, they got Cas back, they kept hunting and helping people, at least for now… it was great. Dean found himself smiling almost constantly. He and Cas more or less talked everything out, though they were still working on it, and Dean knew he would have to try really hard not to lose him. He was fine with that, he just wanted Cas to stay with him.
This one is…. Unnecessary, lol. I didn’t really have an idea but I started writing whatever, and this happened. There’s barely any dialogue or anything actually happening, no idea why it’s so long, but whatever XD (also, the amount of times I used the word ‘control’ is ridiculous - like, bitch, you don’t NEED to use the word in the prompt at all, let alone this much lmao
“I want to kiss you.” Dean’s lips hovered over Cas’.
So Dean leaned in and kissed Cas. Taking everyone by surprise. Of course, Sam and Jack knew that they were together. But Dean wasn’t big on public displays of affection. He was keeping it for when he and Cas were alone.
Enjoy ♥
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel said. “I’m glad you called.”
Haven't posted (or written) anything in a long while, so here is another short drabble :D
“I’m calling about that date… because I did ask you out on a date, right?” he added, suddenly doubting himself.
Cas followed Dean out of the house to the Impala.
“I think I’d like that.” Cas smiled, turning and leaving one more quick, casual kiss on Dean’s lips, then getting out of bed.
“Just felt like kissing you.” Dean answered and leaned in closely, so that his mouth was next to Cas’ ear - the one the guys didn’t see when he was turned to Dean. “I’m just really happy. Here, with you.” he whispered. He felt weird saing mushy things like that but he felt dizzy. Maybe that was because he had a few beers too many, or maybe he hit his head a bit too hard, but either way, he felt happier than ever.
Dean smiled and tried to get a little bit of blanket to cover himself. He didn't want to get up to get another blanket, he was too tired. So he tried to pull the blanket from under Cas and failed. Well, he did it gently to not wake him up. But then he tried again, harder. This time he succeeded, but Cas, still asleep, pulled the blanket back. Dean looked at him with disbelief. Who knew that he was a blanket hogger?
“Okay, guys, c’mon, I’m still here.” Sam said. “I feel like a third wheel, can you please not?”
“I mean, when I’m very stressed, or when I’m with my friends and we’re bored... “ he bit his lip. “Maybe quite often.” he shrugged. But then he thought that maybe Cas asked because he doesn’t want to be with a person who gets baked all the time. “But not that much, I mean, it’s not like we do it every day. And weed is not that bad-”
“In love, huh?” Sam asked teasingly. That he was not aware of, and he was undoubtedly the person that knew literally everything about Dean.
“You good, Sammy?” Dean asked his younger brother, of course thinking it was his first time smoking. It wasn’t. And he wasn’t
“Yes!” Charlie clapped.
He pressed one more chaste kiss to Castiel’s lips before grabbing his hand and walking towards their motel room.
Soon enough, Cas moved to straddle Dean’s lap, both men clutching each other and putting into the kiss not only their love and years of pining, and relief to finally do that, but also all the sadness, despair, and grief, and everything in between.
“Yeah, not tired at all” he heard Cas say with irony, before he completely drifted away. But he was, indeed, tired. Too tired to respond. Before Castiel laid down, what he was going to do, since there wasn't really much more to do, he covered Dean with blanket. “Goodnight, Dean” he whispered before he turned the light off and went to bed. He managed to fall asleep and let his mind rest. He didn’t need to sleep and he wasn’t doing in often, but he liked it. He let his mind drift away from all the concerns.
“Yes.” Cas kept walking, looking straight ahead.
"Hey, angel, what do you say we go to sleep now?" Dean panted, his forehead against Castiel's. There was a little smile on his face, and he couldn't help it. He finally kissed Cas. He spent so much time denying those feelings and cursing himself for always focusing on Cas' lips when they were talking. And now here they were.
“Hi guys. Had fun?” he asked with too big grin, when Dean looked at him with wide eyes. Cas just looked a little bit flustered.
I remember that I was struggling with coming up with the idea for this one, hopefully it counts as 'comfort' hah
Sam was amazed at how quickly their moods and topics were changing, basically this whole night. He knew how weed worked, but still, he never saw his big brother like that, so it was weird.
“It’s nothing.” she chuckled. “You’re cute.” she added, looking up at him, and before she said anything else that might be stupid or about Dean, Dean nudged her with his elbow, maybe a little too hard. “Oh wow, I’m hungry.” and she dug in her food, already forgetting what she said.. They
“This coke is the best!” said Benny, sipping the drink he ordered.
“You're the best” Dean whispered, closing his eyes again.
“I couldn’t sleep. Cas, we’ll find a way.” he added, bringing a chair closer to Cas, throwing books off of it, and sitting down, not taking his hand away from Castiel’s shoulder.
“Oh.” she said, and it seemed like she was suddenly deep in thought. “I would eat some ice-cream.”
Enjoy ♥
“Good. I was only asking, because I never did it, so-”
They were just laying there, Dean’s hands wrapped tightly around Cas, bringing him as close as possible, while Cas’s hands were wandering over Dean’s body, wherever they could reach in their position. Dean felt… blissful. He’d never thought it would be possible for him, but here he was. Having a lazy morning in bed with a person he loves, feeling extremely, unbelievably happy.
never wrote the pretend to date for a case stuff so sorry for that
“We’re being annoying.” Cas observed with a small chuckle.
Enjoy ♥
“Fucking hell.” Dean hissed, as he hit his head pretty hard.
at Cas as she brought their order. It was fine. He didn’t care.
A day later they finally figured out what was keeping the ghosts there. Of course it had to be in the house so freeing the spirits couldn't happen without a fight. Dean tried to focus, but he was constantly catching himself on observing Cas with the corner of his eye. The angel in a fight… damn, he looked good.
“Yeah.” Charlie nodded and then started laughing. Then she got all serious. “Guys!” she exclaimed. “What if we all got magic powers, like, like wizards- Like, what if we were supposed to go to Hogwarts but we never got out letters?!” she seemed really concerned about this, which was really funny to the rest of the group.
). Now that Cas was human, he was experiencing all the things humans do, as they get older. Like his eyesight getting worse. Which he refused to acknowledge for now.
“So what?” Dean found himself not really caring if Cas notices. But that lasted a moment, after which he came back to reality. “I’m hungry.” he said again.
“Yeah, of course. What are we talking about?” he asked, trying to shrug it off, while Sam’s and Cas’ piercing gazes were on him.
Enjoy ♥
“Dean, what are you doing?” Cas asked, smiling, his face inches from Dean’s. His back was against a shelf and Dean stood right in front of him.
“When there’s nothing of a world-ending importance that needs my undivided attention.” he admitted.
“Yeah, well, you said your peace back then. So now it’s my turn.” Dean said before Cas had a chance to repeat his speech or whatever he was about to say. “That was so unfair.” he started, taking a step towards Cas. “You can’t just say all those stuff just to die afterwards! I barely had time to process what was happening.”
I had a lot of trouble just coming up with an idea for this one, and honestly I’m not too happy with what it turned out to be haha But whatever (also, could those sentences BE any choppier? Why do I do this lmao) + I don’t remember anything from this episode aside from Cas dying and the diner scene and I have no idea what it was all about and felt too lazy to check lmao
“How about this diner around the corner?” Benny said. “You know, the one where the guy you’re in love with works.” he said and Dean was surprised that his tone wasn’t even teasing like always. He just said that so casually, like it was the most common fact.
Enjoy♥
“You’re prettier.” he answered with a wink, then taking a drag of the joint.
“Talk to me, I’m bored.” he explained himself. Cas tilted his head, confused. Dean was quiet, not wanting to talk for last few hours and now he wants to talk? But then again, maybe he’s just tired and trying to stay awake.
Enjoy ♥
I liked the idea but then I started writing and it turned out bad, but I'm posting anyway because who cares hahaha
am attracted to him.” she said, a little bit jokingly, but the rest of them couldn’t be sure. “I was never even attracted to you, and according to every girl in high school, that was impossible.” she pointed out.
Hope you like it, idk
Finally one in which it’s Cas who kisses Dean, lmao I really have no idea why I always write it the other way haha
“Suckers.” he laughed. “I just had ice-cream with Cas. And I got a date. Sorry, Charlie, he’s mine.” Dean grinned and his friends were in shock.
Finally, Dean managed to find and burn the object souls there tied to. Then they just kinda stood there, catching a breath.
“You’re hurt.” Cas replied. “At least let me heal you.”
“Yeah, but still. I have no clue- ah, shit!” he exclaimed after he hit his foot against the couch. “I really want this to work out. It has to.” he added, running back to his room. “What t-shirt did Charlie wear yesterday? You know, the one she took from my closet?”
We all know the finale did not happen, but because this came to my mind, why not (ignore the fact that I wrote a fix-it fic to that before and it’s kinda similar lol - titled "You didn't know shit" if I wanna check it out hah)
They sat down in separate chairs, and Dean looked around at all the books. His headache wasn’t getting any better. Despite that, he asked:
When they finally parted, they were both panting and smiling, and Dean wanted nothing more than just to kiss Cas again, and again, and again, and again. But for now, he needed to breathe. He was happy, really happy, for the first time in a long while. And he felt lighter after getting all those emotions out, even if just in the form of a kiss. He would get to the talking part later. There was no rush. And in that moment, they didn’t need any words.
"Sorry." Cas muttered. "I couldn't sleep." He left out the part that he couldn't sleep since he lost his powers. But of course now he needed to sleep. And when he did sleep, he was usually having nightmares. "I wanted a glass of water, but…" he pointed at the glass on the floor. "Can't do even that now." he whispered.
As they drove, holding hands, filling each other up on what happened to each of them since they were separated, Dean was content and happy. And in love, which was weird to finally admit. And the rest of eternity seemed promising and blissful, now that Cas was with him. Cas was all he needed.
Hello and Happy New Year!
“Cas is here?” he asked, cursing himself for the hope in his voice. Bobby smiled, taking a sip of his beer. “How? Where is he?” just then he heard a rustling of wings behind him. And Dean knew it was him. It had to be.
Enjoy ♥
“I’m sure he will, but shut up.” Charlie groaned next to him, turning her back to him and taking more of the covers with her. She wasn’t a morning person. Well, neither was Dean, but he was too nervous about his date. They were sleeping in his bed, Sam was on the couch in the living room, and Benny on the floor in living room.
“Okay, great.” Dean could swear he heard Cas smiling. “Tomorrow night, then.”
Enjoy ♥
For sure I'll keep writing destiel, though currently I'm hyperfixated on sambucky (I'm writing a new fic with them if anyone's interested!) but I'll definitely write more destiel 😂 I was thinking of maybe doing prompts, too? Like, if you want me to write something specific, my inbox on my fanfic blog on tumblr is always open - I can't promise I'll write it quickly (especially because I'm starting my 3rd year of uni and I'll have to work on my BA thesis hah) but I will definitely get to it hah (idk if anyone would even want me to write anything but if you do, feel free to send me asks on tumblr)
“We have ice-cream.” Cas said. “We can share.” he smirked.
Enjoy ♥
And then, they were on a case, and Dean couldn’t stop fearing for Cas’ life, even though he was an angel, and it was not likely for him to die because of a ghost. He just felt like, if Cas died again, he would regret not saying anything, not doing anything. So when they were back at the motel and got out of the car, Sam had gone to their room, and Dean stayed back, grabbing Castiel’s wrist. And he kissed Cas eagerly, as if his life depended on it. As if that kiss was what he needed to live. And he felt as if his insides completely melted, and he felt nervous and relieved. Relieved, because Castiel answered with the same passion and desperation. As if that moment, and that kiss, was the only thing that mattered. They kept kissing so desperately, as if they would die once their lips parted. Dean actually felt like that might happen. He finally got to kiss Cas, and he never wanted to stop. He poured all the years of longing and pining and denial and grief and love into that kiss. He continued kissing Cas even when he felt like he was going to pass out because of the lack of air.
, crossed Dean’s mind and he had to laugh quietly. Cas just smiled shyly. Oh, his angel.
“No.” Dean said, kissing Cas again, this time just to spite his brother.
“Does this mean you’re not mad at me anymore?” Cas whispered. Dean
“I’m gonna be right back.” he pulled the keys out and gave them to Sam. And then he just turned around and walked away.
I seem to post those ficlets every couple months but whatever, I'm gonna finish it one day lol
“Like I said, same as always.” Sam rolled his eyes.
“C’mon, kid.” Dean rolled his eyes, leaning back in his chair and putting his free hand behind Castiel’s chair. “Let’s leave that for tomorrow morning. For now, we drink and relax.” he took another sip of his beer and sighed.
He even loved arguing, because Cas was hot, and pretty cute, when he was all sassy and angry.
“Yeah, unfortunately.” he sighed, but he had a little smile. They were like family. “But it’s okay, as long as it’s just you three.” he knew he would not win with them. With Dean. To Dean he will always be his little brother Sammy and he had to come to terms with it.
“Seriously?” Sam asked, raising his eyebrows.
They were close. Cas moved a little bit closer, because he didn't want to take the blanket from Dean. They didn't touch but Cas could feel the warmth coming from Dean's body and it was strangely comforting. Dean fell asleep quickly, he must've been tired. And for a while Castiel just looked at him. And maybe it was seeing the hunter next to him, or maybe just knowing that he's so close, just few centimeters… but Cas felt good and safe and for a moment he forgot about being a powerless human and slowly, really slowly, but finally he too fell asleep. By Dean's side. With smile on the face.
“Bitch.” Dean responded. After few minutes he walked out of his room in blue jeans, black t-shirt with unbuttoned, red, plaid shirt over it. “Be honest, how do I look?”
Enjoy♥
need you. So don’t leave me again.” in answer he felt Cas’ lips against his.
“Dean.” Cas said quietly and smiled. Dean glanced at his Baby, just standing there, then back at Cas.
, it’s rather kind of... switching off my mind. It’s like falling asleep, but not quite, because I can do it immediately, whenever I want to let my mind rest. And to answer your other question, no, I do not dream. It’s rather… nothingness. A place where I can have no concerns for a little while. But also my body is alert and if someone’s saying my name or trying to wake me up, this also happens right away.” he finished, thinking if he should explain more clearly. “I hope this answers your questions.”
“Hey Cas. It’s Dean.” he said and went to his room, to be alone and so Sam, who was sitting in the living room watching tv, would not hear his conversation.
was weird and scary, but he was fine with it. He got used to feeling that way around him.
“So…” Sam started. “Did anything interesting happen?” he watched Cas closely. He wanted them to finally stop acting as if they didn't know about their feelings for each other. This sometimes got too awkward for Sam, when they were all in one room. All that staring and tension and eye-fucking was killing him.
"Go back to sleep, Dean. I'll be fine." Cas said. He sounded tired. He was tired. Not only because he couldn't sleep. He was tired of being powerless. And unnecessary. He couldn't understand why Winchester brothers still claimed that they needed him. What could he give them now? Maybe just knowledge. But maybe not even that. He just felt like he didn't matter.
Because we got over 100 kudos here (which may not be a lot, but it is to me idk), I'm posting an additional drabble this week ☺ Next one normally on Sunday ☺
“So do you smoke often?” Cas asked, taking a sip of his beer.
“Dude, if looks could kill-”
Enjoy ♥
“Jerk” Sam said and Dean smiled. His brother had no problem with him being with Cas. This made him happier than he already was. And he was really happy. He couldn't remember last time he felt like this. Of course he knew that Sammy might tease him about it, but to be fair, they teased each other about everything.
Enjoy ♥
“No shit” Dean rolled his eyes. “That’s kinda obvious, genius” he scoffed in such an offensive tone, that Cas got annoyed again. “We need to ask more about this house.” he pointed at building they just went out of. It was an old, abandoned house that someone recently bought with intention to renovate, but got mysteriously murdered. Why were people so stupid to buy houses where dozens of people were killed? Dean could never understand it.
“Cas?” Dean approached him, cautiously putting a hand on his shoulder. He wasn’t sure if Cas wanted to be alone or not.
“Oh, yeah, right.” Dean interrupted him with a little chuckle. “Yeah, I was pretty stoned. But not too much, okay? I know when to stop, unlike one of my best friends.” he added.
“I think I’ll stay. We have more books to read.” Cas said, pointing to the pile of books on the table. Dean pouted as Cas looked him straight in the eyes, with an expression that told Dean that Cas knew that getting a snack was not the only thing he had in mind.
So half an hour later, they were sitting on Dean’s couch, and Dean was lighting up a joint. Meanwhile, Sam was in Dean’s room, where Dean told him to go, reading a book.
“I could really eat something.” at that they both burst out laughing. So they decided to ask Sam to make them some sandwiches. He wasn’t happy about it, but he did it anyway. It was Dean’s big date, he didn't want to be the one ruining something, even by not making a fucking sandwich.
got himself killed again. And that's when their argument began. Older of the Winchester brothers was just scared to lose Castiel again, and getting angry was the only way he knew to deal with all that.
He found himself staring at Cas’ amazing, kissable lips. So he quickly shifted his attention to something else. But he couldn't bring himself to stop looking at Cas. Dean admired his high cheekbones and black hair and peaceful smile and muscular arms, that were shown because he was just in friggin undershirt… he admired basically everything about him. And missing only awesome blue eyes that were closed in that moment. Basically he was staring. At sleeping Cas. And it was kinda creepy.
But anyway, I hope it's not too bad hahaha
“Okay. You could've said something, but okay.” Sam wasn't mad or hurt that they didn't tell him. He knew his brother better than anyone. He wasn't surprised he tried to hide his relationship. But he wanted to let Dean know, that he's gonna support him no matter what. “Well, if you're both happy, then I am too” truth is, he was more than happy. His brother deserved something good in his life. More than anyone, in Sam's opinion.
“Five more minutes.” was Dean’s response, which he was repeating for the past hour. “I don’t wanna move.” he sighed contentedly. He really could just stay like that forever. It was like his personal Heaven on Earth.
“Ugh, get a room.” Sam said more teasingly than anything else, which earned him a kick under the table.
“You died.” Cas interrupted whatever Dean was going to ask. “You died.” he repeated, exasperated. “
“Hello, what can I get you?” they all looked at the waiter. Dean swallowed loudly. It was him. No amount of weed would make him relaxed enough to not be a little bit nervous around his crush.
“Are you sure you don’t want to rest before that?”
“Shoot, I didn’t think of that.” Charlie said, looking like she’s about to cry.
“Yeah, we gonna eat.” Dean grinned. He couldn’t help it.
Anyway, idk, I kinda like this one hah
“Son of a bitch.” Dean whispered, when he realised where his thoughts are going. No. No, no, no. This ain’t happening.
they can bring him back. They’ll try. And if they fail, they’ll try again. And again. And again. Until they’re literally out of options. No one in their little family dies for good, ever. And the first one certainly won’t be a kid.
“I know, sorry.” Dean smiled back, and then leaned in for a kiss. What was supposed to be a quick peck, turned into a deep, passionate make-out session, with lots of teeth and tongue.
Omg we're at 40 😱 ten more to go (and I have just two more to write and I've been putting it off because I kinda don't wanna finish this series hahaha)
“That’s fine by me.” Dean smiled, leaning in. He was too chilled out to be stressing about it. When their lips met, he felt ten times higher than he was. It was so amazing and new and exciting. And they both couldn’t stop smiling during the kiss. After they broke the kiss, they just looked at each other.
This one's really short, but whatever hah - actually the plan was to write the drabbles more or less this length, but you know, things happen :D
He parked his car in front of the building Cas lived in. He got out of the car and that’s when he saw the door opening and Cas was walking towards him, wearing a light blue shirt and black jeans, with unzipped jacket over his shoulders.
) and I wanted to see if I could write short drabbles (apparently I can't because a lot of those were much longer than I wanted them to be haha)
“I could really eat somethin’.” Dean said, interrupting Charlie’s rant about something he wasn’t listening to.
“Yeah, but this is Cas.” Dean had to go out in twenty minutes if he wanted to be on time. “I really, really like him, Sammy.” he stopped in the door to his room and looked at his brother.
When they got to the room with two beds, Dean looked at Cas, a little confused. Cas was going towards one of the beds.
food.” Dean could hear the frown on Jack’s face more than see it, because his gaze was still on Cas. Then he tuned out the conversation, focusing entirely on Cas.
also, finally something from Cas' pov lol
It was hot, but gentle. Awkward, but perfect. It was like they were made for each other, like they completed each other. And it was a moment of happiness and forgetting about the whole world. Their moment. The one that should’ve happened sooner, what of course crossed their minds. They both haven’t felt so carefree and happy in a long time.
“Fine.” Dean got up and went to the kitchen all by himself.
“We were supposed to get ice-cream!” Charlie remembered.
“It’s okay to cry, man.” Dean didn’t even realize when he moved his hand to Cas’ back and started moving it in soothing circles.
He sat up and glanced at the other bed, where Cas was asleep. Dean couldn't recall ever seeing him like that. Maybe that's because he never did. Cad looked so peaceful. This time Winchester allowed himself to smile fondly at the sight. He forgot about his nightmare right away. Cas was right here.
Haven't posted anything in a while, but here's another chapter, lol
When Jack died, they didn’t give themselves time to grieve properly. Because
And he knew that the fact that he found his angel best friend in a male body hot and cute meant that he was not, as he previously thought, straight.
“I honestly have no fuckin’ idea.” Benny said,
The next day, when the weed wore off and Dean was sober, he woke up and started panicking.
The bunker was huge, and it was just emphasized when it was just the four of them there, Dean, Cas, Sam, and Eileen.
“Dean.” Cas pulled his hands away from his face, looked at Dean, and tried to act as if everything’s fine. “What are you doing here?”
Sam laughed at that and Dean just hung up. It was about making good impression, not...ugh. Well, Cas knew him for over a year now and still wanted to go out with him, so maybe he didn’t have to panic as much. And he kinda ruined the ‘first’ impression when he asked him out while high… All that is left is not making a fool out of himself on the date.
“Of course. You should be careful, too.”
smoking right now anyway. Dean stood up and put out the joint.
“Cas.” Dean said, standing up, and his lips immediately formed a smile. He was relieved to see him again. He thought he would never have a chance to see him, talk to him… and here he was.
And I think it got sadder than I intended it to, it was supposed to be an angry argument but oh well haha - I was trying very hard to keep that theme of anger and it probably ruined it a lil bit but whatever, I still like it
“Our first kiss? Yeah, me neither.” Cas chuckled. “But I’m glad it happened. Although I wish the circumstances were different.” he added, a little shyly. Dean visibly relaxed, now that he knew it wasn’t just a one-time thing. Or so he hoped.
After they greeted each other, Sam said “You hungry? I bought some food, yes, including your pie.” he rolled his eyes, as he saw his older brother opening his mouth to ask.
This is probably one of my least fav things I've ever written - I have no idea what is even going on here lmao (I almost don't wanna post it at all, geez XD)
“You look awesome!” she yelled, through the music. “I’m sure you gonna get some tonight!”
Dean and Cas were out. Sam had no idea where they went, but they haven't been back till late night. Sam wasn't asleep, he was reading a book in the war room, when his brother and friend walked in, laughing about something. They haven't noticed him. They were still on top of the stairs, when Dean pulled Cas closer and kissed him. Dean kissed Cas. On the mouth. And that kiss was getting too heated for Sam to watch this. So he cleared his throat, letting them know about his presence.
“Oh. You meant you and I should move.” he said, as if just now realizing it.
“Mhm” Cas mumbled, his eyes closed and hands in Dean’s hair. He expected Dean to pull away this final time and start the car again, but he didn’t.
“Really?” she was confused.
"About damn time." he thought, closing the door and letting them sleep a little longer. They didn't have anything urgent to do right now.
But anyway, I'm gonna ramble about it in the next (last!) one hah
As the girl was walking away with their orders, Dean’s gaze following her, he felt a kick under the table. He looked up at his brother, who sat opposite him and Cas.
“I mean, I want to have a home. A real home. Whatever that means.” he scoffed, realizing that he actually does not know. Because when he had a real home, he was young and he could barely remember it. But he could figure it out, right? With Cas.
“Not on me, but I got a stash at my place. We could go even now. I mean, if you want to. And my brother’s there, but he’s cool.”
