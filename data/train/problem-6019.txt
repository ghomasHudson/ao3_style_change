He trudges up the stairs and stops just outside Steve’s bedroom.  He puts his hand on the knob, turning it gently, but then second guesses himself and lets it spring back.  The door stays closed.
“We should make popcorn.  You want popcorn?”  Tony doesn’t wait for an answer, just clambers up and heads to the kitchen.  Steve watches him go, the title credits to the movie beginning to play.  The music is loud.
It’s nice, having a full house. After a meal and a few drinks everyone laughs easy, smiles more. Bucky and Natasha melt toward each other in that way they always do, and Jan has relaxed enough that she’s stopped trying so hard to be outrageous. It’s comfortable, and cozy, and Perry Como croons from the kitchen radio. Steve catches himself wondering if this is how it could just
sounds too Harlequin even in his own mind, but there’s no other word for how big and thick Steve is, the rush of blood turning the thin skin nearly purple and the fat head pearling with liquid.  Tony’s never seen someone leak like this, wet and messy and gorgeous. He gathers the moisture on his tongue, rolls it over a few times and swallows.  Steve doesn’t even taste bad. Figures.
“No way in hell, Rogers.  This,” Tony runs a hand over his immaculately shaped and trimmed Van Dyck.  “Takes a fair amount of care and attention.  It’s not to be trifled with.”
“Hey, you beat everyone else here?” Steve asks as Tony grabs the bottom hem of his hoodie and pulls him forward hips first, before reaching up to tuck his other hand into the navy blue scarf looped loosely around Steve’s neck.  Steve goes easily, leaning in to Tony’s kiss.  He tastes like clove cigarettes, a habit Steve has pleaded with him to break.  Steve opts not to say anything about it now.
His distress must show itself plainly on his face, because something in Bucky’s stance relents, his own expression softening. He sits down next to Steve on the bed, mattress springs squeaking.
”  He states simply, then reaches for Natasha.  She ducks under his arm and off the train.  He shakes his head, chuckling.
. Don’t do that.” He whirls at Tony, and whatever expression is on his face must startle Tony enough that he stumbles back. It vaguely registers, somewhere in his peripheral vision, that Steve finally notices them both together outside. He sits up straight, suddenly alert and staring out at them, his pencil coming to rest against paper.
Tony clears the floor, finding no one left alive, and moves upward.  It’s eerily quiet.  The place is a jagged maze of broken glass, torn wires, and heavy debris.  Sprinklers have come on and since turned off, water dripping everywhere and pooling under his feet.
“You really are a mess.  I can only imagine what you looked like when Ross brought you in.  I’m glad I wasn’t there to see it.”  Disentangling herself from his embrace, she turns and walks back down the hall.  Steve follows her slowly.  At his slower pace, she’s already in the living room and opening up one of the oak cabinets by the time he catches up.
Clint and Sam are scrambling up the fence, attempting to balance their pumpkins atop the stone pillars that frame the iron gate.  Clint crows in triumph when he balances his first.
one.  Bet in your wildest dreams you never saw that coming.”  He forgets what he was going to say next as he realizes that he and Steve have walked right out of the gym and have somehow found themselves waiting for the elevator.  He even unthinkingly pushed the up button whilst they were talking.  Steve is unwrapping the tape from his hands.   He almost asks Steve how they got here and where they’re going but then remembers they’re going to go eat and it was his idea.
He’s wearing those tight, faded red jeans that Steve loves, even if from this view he can’t see the way they hug the curve of Tony’s perfect ass.  A charcoal grey vest over a blue and white plaid shirt makes Tony look slimmer and leaner than ever, and Steve smiles at the pink bow tie.  It’d been a Christmas gift from him the year before and Tony tends to wear it on days when he’s secretly in a good mood.
“What are the chances I can figure out how to work the shower?” There is an elaborate panel with buttons and knobs and multiple settings in place of a standard tap. He can't even determine which one is the
“How much do you really want to know?” Steve inquires softly, reaching up to run his hand through Tony’s messy hair. Steve likes it like this, when it’s a bit out of control and long enough to tousle. Tony being anything less than picture-perfect and camera ready has always felt like an exchange of intimacy between them.  This is
“Yeah, but Steve’s in charge and Steve knows what I can do.  I’ll follow his lead.  Tell her, Steve.”
“It’s temporary,” Tony states, unable to come up with a witty response.  Of course the place doesn’t seem like him, he hasn’t set foot here in over twenty-five years.  “That ‘big ugly building’ is more my speed, we’ll be back up there scraping the sky in no time.”
“This is because I won’t be a kept man?” Steve asks, confusion further deepening the furrow in his brow and his voice rising. “Because it’d be easier to stash me away up here like some illicit mistress?”
It’s three in the morning when Tony blearily gives up working on his latest project.  He’s sure if he sleeps, the nightmares will come, but he physically can’t keep his eyelids from drooping.  In his younger days he might have done a line of coke and gone back to work, but he’s beyond that kind of stupid shit now.  These days, it’s just caffeine and at this point, coffee is just making him twitchy and uncomfortable.
“Apparently not.” Steve mumbles back, unable to hide his displeasure at this turn of events. Wanda plasters on a smile and leans over, tapping Tony on the shoulder and greeting him with over-played warmth, her accent growing broader as she fake-enthuses over her producer and his new paramour.
“Bucky?”  Tony asks, a little reluctantly, and Steve nods, managing a smile to let Tony know it’s all right.  “He teach you anything else?”
“His intel has been vital on these missions concerning Zola.  He’s been cleared for duty for two weeks now.”
“Well, I’m sure your mother was a wonderful woman.” Pepper looks at him strangely, narrowing her eyes as if she’s puzzling something out.  It occurs to Steve that maybe that was the wrong thing to say; he knows nothing about Pepper’s parents or her relationship with them.  “Oh, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have presumed to say anything-“
“Talking about yourself?” Clint’s voice interrupts, slinging one of his tattooed arms over Tony’s shoulders, the other over Steve’s.   Despite wearing a slouchy knit hat and red plaid scarf to fight off the fall chill, Clint’s wearing jean shorts and he isn’t donning his usual black members only jacket over his faded Joy Division t-shirt.  The slightly tinny sound of the newest Savages album is coming from the beat up pair of headphones which Clint is still half wearing, one side pulled away so he can theoretically take part in their conversation.
“I hope you’re right.” Bucky says softly, like a prayer. Tony closes his eyes for a moment, letting the words echo in his mind.
“Call it.” Tony mouths to Steve, mimicking a phone with his hand, and then turns to greet Pepper. By the time he’s done smoothing ruffled feathers, Steve is long gone.
“That’s right, you like your Cusack.  For someone who likes very little, Nat, your penchant for certain celebrities bewilders me.”
Steve releases his hold on Tony’s hair immediately and Bucky quickly reaches over, metal hand flat on Steve’s stomach to pin him down. Tony draws off Steve with a strangled gasp for air.
“I’d ask for an explanation, but I don’t think I want one,” Steve shakes his head, hoping that no one thinks it necessary to reveal exactly how far into the encounter Dugan got before the realization struck.
“Um…sure.”  Steve stares at Tony, realizing a beat too late that Tony is finally talking to him and not at him.  “Thanks, Tony.  This is all very nice.”
“What are you saying? You—do you think this was a mistake?” Steve stands up, fully cognizant of his nakedness and the way his whole body shows evidence of their lovemaking. It suddenly feels shameful rather than wonderful, unexpected and shocking like a bucket of ice water doused over his head.
“Hmph,” Tony grunts.  “You guys have had, what, three calls since the Battle of New York?”  Steve nods.  “And you never once thought to yourself that things would be easier if Iron Man were around?”
“Why would that be?” Steve inquires. “Did you want to apologize for all of the insinuations about Miss Van Dyne and myself?”
It’s not the question he expected.  Tony shifts, folding his arms protectively over his chest.  He turns back to the window, not so much to look at Steve now but more to
“I think you’re being hard on yourself,” Jane shrugs. “Bucky wasn’t helping, and Darcy can be a bit overwhelming. Perhaps Natasha and I should have given you a
“We do have all night.” Tony drops the tie carelessly to the floor and starts working on his own. “Please feel free to come over here and try and top it.”
“You telling me I look less than dashing, Hogan?  That what you’re implying?”  Tony turns to look at his warped reflection on the elevator wall, brushing a hand through his hair, then ducks his head to sniff his shirt.  “Ok, so, you might have a point.”
Is it always this easy to get lost in someone else’s arms?  He feels like he’s drifting, Tony’s embrace the only thing keeping him from floating away.
“Stark.  SHIELD has been breached; the New York headquarters is under attack.  I don’t care where you are, get Rogers and get the hell back here now.  They’re here for Barnes.  They’re here for-“ She looks off to her right and shouts something unintelligible.  There’s an explosion and she disappears into a cloud of smoke and debris.
that’s a physiological impossibility.   He wants to hold Steve’s earnest gaze on the principle that that look is making him jumpy and nervous.  He doesn’t like it therefore he must defeat it.
Steve glowers as Tony tries to sober up, bending down and offering Steve a hand.  It’s petty, but Steve grabs it quickly and pulls forward before he has time to think about what he’s doing.  Tony tumbles into the pond beside him.  The splash is gratifying.
“Hey, Cap.” Clint is fighting back a smile, struggling to keep it in check, but he loses the battle.  Beaming, he claps a hand to Steve’s shoulder.  “Damn, it’s good to see you, man.”
“For the record, falling asleep while I’m revealing my inner most thoughts and deepest secrets earns you nothing but demerits, demerits, demerits.”  Tony points an accusatory finger.  “I have it on good authority – Pepper’s authority – that sleeping with your eyes open does not equal listening, even if it gives the
doesn’t know he’s had these dreams before.  He’s steadfastly pretended he hasn’t, never spoken a word about it to anyone.  He’ll never admit one of his earliest sexual experiences was pumping himself empty all over a photo of Steve – Steve as
Steve sends an entreating glance in Bucky’s direction, desperate for a rescue. Usually, he and Bucky are constantly in some kind of contact throughout an evening. Even if they aren’t by each other’s side, he’s always aware of where Bucky is and how he’s faring, while Bucky is silently watching out for him. Natasha refers to it as an unbreakable rubber band, only allowing one to stretch so far before snapping back within reaching distance.
He finds Steve bundled on the living room couch, barely visible under multiple layers of blankets. Thankfully his congestion must have subsided enough to allow him to sleep, and Steve looks peaceful despite his fever-pink cheeks and irritation-red nose. Tissues have made their way from their brand new boxes to the wastebasket beside the couch; it’s near overflowing with evidence of Steve’s illness.
“Excuse me?”  Steve hastens back, trying to keep his voice level even though his first instinct is panic, quickly followed by anger.  “That’s –” He stops, words and footsteps slowing as the man turns and Steve recognizes that familiar face.   “ – mine.  Tony?  What are you…?”
“That’s exactly it, Tony.  It’s not about you.  Do you think Steve needs that extra baggage right now?”
“It’s okay, Bruce.  We ordered your usual for you, hope that’s okay.”  Steve breaks away from Tony’s gaze, turning to offer their friend a sympathetic smile.  Tony knows it’s rude, but he begrudges Bruce that smile.  He’d
“Tony.  Do you really want to do this?”  Steve seems almost resigned, a frown already creasing his face.  “Because I don’t think I can manage it if you change your mind again.”
“Well, Tony, unless you’ve been holding out on me, no one has of yet invented teleportation.  So yes.  A few hours.”  She hangs up on him this time, but it’s not worrying.  He’d worry if she’d refused to come.
Steve turns around quickly.  Tony is leaning in the open doorway, beer in one hand and his phone in the other.  He clicks something on the screen and then shoves it away into his pocket.
I was going to be here?” Darcy points to Natasha and Bucky, who are standing at the record player, enviably comfortable in one another’s space. Steve knows they’ve heard every word exchanged, despite the fact that they’ve carefully engaged Thor in a separate conversation for the past five minutes.
As soon as Tony’s inside, Bucky slams their bodies close, reaches for Steve’s shoulders and pulls Steve back so he’s kneeling, his back pressed to Tony’s front. Bucky’s plastered against Tony’s back, holding him effortlessly between his body and Steve’s.
“Tony, you’re…” Steve starts, a bit surprised that Tony is already prepared for this, like he’d expected it despite coming into the bathroom under the pretense of concern. He’s not sure he really cares about the presumption.
“Oh, Sue, god, no.” Tony shakes his head then winces, the movement sending his brain thudding against both sides of his skull. “She was just looking to make Richards jealous. I guess he took another role ‘on the New York Stage’ without talking to her about being a whole country apart.” Tony makes Reed sound as pompous as he is. He fights back his bedspread and sheets, struggling to get his legs to cooperate. “She wanted a little payback and you know me, I live to serve.”
His answering nod is stiff, and his walk from the room is stilted. Steve’s not quite sure how to do this, this whole…morning after thing. He’s pretty damn positive that waking up shaking from a nightmare isn’t a good way to start off, but from there on he has no idea. Is he supposed to stay for breakfast or was Tony just being polite, counting on him to play his part, to know better than to take the invitation at face value? Should he shower and slip out with a quick good-bye, or should he try and make this last longer? Should he ask Tony if they could see each other again?
“Natasha, hey!”  Steve cuts Clint off as he spots Clint’s best friend approaching.  Her blazing red hair, pulled back by a wide green headband, glints in the late morning sunlight, as warm and fiery as the brightly changing autumn leaves still stubbornly clinging to the few trees dotted along the sidewalk.   He’s grateful for Natasha’s arrival, as Tony bristles whenever Clint goes all proletariat, inevitably drawing a line between Tony and Thor, who had both grown up across the river in the lap of luxury, and the rest of their group, none of whom grew up in Manhattan or had it remotely easy.  Clint had it the worst off of all of them.
Steve’s very existence might actually drive him crazy.  All the shit he’s been through in his life, the terror and the betrayal and the heartache he has
Tony downs most of his drink in one gulp.  Pepper is watching him calmly, waiting for him to wind down.
“So glad you were here to provide. How much will this run me?” Tony's tone is tired and disaffected, and Steve bites his bottom lip sharply to keep from physically wincing. But his whole body tenses up just the same and Jan must feel it as she runs her hands over his shoulders.
“Look, you better go get someone.”  Bucky warns, and jangles the handcuffs loudly.  “What can I possibly do like
The grass is damp under his bare feet and he can see Tony slipping and sliding, bobbing in and out of view beside him as the man struggles to keep up.  Tony falls behind as he toddles awkwardly, the blanket he has wrapped around himself restricting his pace.
“Currently he’s in a meeting with some folks he’s got working on this damn Stark Resilient project of his, but he’s requested that you two, along with Barton, meet him at the old Stark Mansion in half an hour.  Banner’s already there.”
any of my Great Aunts, couldn't pick 'em out of a lineup if I tried.  The connection between Peggy and Sharon is just close enough to make for a nice story and far enough to keep it from being creepy."
It’s a definite come on, and from anyone else’s lips, Steve might have had to roll his eyes. It’s blatant and not even all that clever. But from Tony…
Steve nods again.   He’d rather not go out at all, but considering Tony spent the last few hours sitting in a dark hotel room while Steve snored the evening away, he can’t imagine saying so.  He’ll do whatever Tony wants.
“I think I’ll walk.” He announces, and Natasha angles herself back outside the car to eye him critically.
“One of these days,” he promises.  He’s still busy staring up at Steve and wondering when his luck is going to run out when Coulson and his new band of lackeys show up, ready to do the investigating now that they’ve finished up the battling.
Steve grabs Tony’s hips in return and shoves them back close together, sending a jolt of desire right up Tony’s spine.
“Who can blame her,” Tony mutters back.  He studies Barnes’ face, trying to discern something, anything at all.  His eyes are icy blue, slightly vacant and crazed like he’s staring at a ghost no one else can see.  He’s as pale as a man who hasn’t seen the sun for years.
“Have I done something wrong?”  Steve asks, smiling nervously, his pulse picking up.  Fury points to the empty chair beside Natasha.
Captain America hasn’t changed that.  Steve Rogers is still the person that no one wants to get to know.  Almost no one.  He seeks Tony out, needing to get eyes on him, and finds him sitting on one of those overstuffed white couches and in animated conversation with a pretty brunette he recognizes from magazine covers at the newsstand.  Her perfectly manicured, elegant hand is resting on Tony’s forearm as they share a laugh.
“But I don’t want to make him choose. I don’t want to do that to him. I want him to be happy. I want him to have
“Well I don’t know about that,” Tony mumbles underneath the beeping of settings being adjusted.  The belt slowly starts to move under Tony’s feet and Steve rolls his eyes.  So many of these newfangled machines are ridiculous.  The point of running is to get somewhere, or at the very least
After returning from Bucky’s a few hours ago, Steve had showered and stumbled into bed, exhausted, not bothering to dress. He’d fallen asleep the second he hit their flannel sheets, the comfortable set that Tony had purchased to help keep him warm after the loss of the serum left him shivering at night. His bare skin cools now as Tony tugs the bed sheet down to his waist, exposing his body to the air-conditioned chill of the bedroom, but he quickly begins to warm up again underneath Tony’s touch.
“Yeah.  Well.  We’ll have to reset those parameters then, won’t we.”  He puts some space between Steve and himself, straightening up his workspace.  It’s something he hasn’t done in months and some of this stuff he doesn’t even remember using.  “Oh, that’s where it went.  Totally forgot about that.”  He comments as he finds a blueprint for a new car engine that he’d folded up and set aside over six months ago.  It’d had some fundamental problems, but maybe it’s worth re-visiting.  He unfolds it and tacks it to the nearest board.  “And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I should never start anything on paper.”
“I appreciate your concern, and I’m sorrier than I can say that I didn’t call, but one night out doesn’t mean I’m suddenly a different person.”
He’s walking in out of the sunlight and Tony swears for a moment that he’s witnessing the visitation of an angel. This man is so beautiful that he makes Tony doubt both his sanity and his religion.
“Not that your hours don’t.  Balls, that’s not what I meant.”  He waves his hands furiously like he’s wiping an imaginary chalkboard of a faulty equation.  “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, he has no idea what he’s doing.  What I
Tony stands, lifting Steve onto the countertop. He pushes up Steve’s shirt and presses Steve back until he lays flat, then strips off Steve's sweatpants in an undignified rush. His lips and left hand map Steve’s chest, touching and rubbing and caressing, as his right slips between Steve’s legs and starts working him open.
They’d done a couple of the newer, faster rides, including this Boardwalk Flight thing that honestly paled in comparison to taking to the sky with Iron Man, but it’d been a thrill to ride the Cyclone again.  He clutched Tony’s hand as they crested the first hill, the same way he’d once clutched Bucky’s, and Tony held on tightly until the ride ended.
“Well this guest will have it on the rocks, then.”  He retreats to the living room and sits down on the arm of the loveseat, watching from a distance as Steve clinks cubes into the glass, uncaps the bottle and pours.  The apartment falls near silent.  Tony can hear the subway rattling somewhere close by.   It makes the floor vibrate.
“Arriving at SHIELD with Tony.  Not much after that – just bits and pieces here and there.  I think I remember a woman saving me.”
“It's fine. I'm fine.” Tony pushes back the piano bench with an unintentional screech on the hardwood. “Tonight is a celebration, not a dirge. Let me get changed and I'll treat you to dinner at Le Pavillion.”
Steve lies back, head propped up against the pillows but the rest of his body stretching out flat over the expanse of their king size bed. The sprawl makes him seem bigger and broader than Tony remembers him to be. His large hands hold Bucky’s ass, his long, thick fingers grabbing and pressing and groping. Bucky’s pale skin flushes pink underneath Steve’s firm touch.
“So…no then.”  Steve sighs, disappointed despite himself.  He’d figured on a denial, but he’s tired of quippy blow-offs.  It’s as if he’s standing still while Tony does figure 8s around him at high speed.
Now, Tony downs the last bite of his dog and crumples up the remaining trash.  He prompts a loud belch by bumping the center of his chest with a fist.  The gesture makes Steve think of the arc reactor, makes him wonder if Tony ever misses it.  It’s a crazy thought, because the RT was a reminder of a great deal of painful experiences in Tony’s life, not to mention being actually, physically painful to have in his body, but sometimes feelings aren’t logical.
“My brother, I fear not.  I know not which way they flew.  However, I will gladly scour the skies for any sign of their whereabouts.”
“Oh, god no,” Tony laughs.  “I don’t make Pepper cook.  She’d kill me.  And frankly, it wouldn’t be worth it, cause she’s absolutely terrible at it.  She’s ordering in from somewhere.  Just come down at seven.”
It hardly seems to matter that Bucky came down firmly on the side of liking ladies and has been letting Natasha dance him around like a puppet for
While he waits, he thinks back on Bruce’s statement, wondering if he really had wanted Steve from word go.  Way back when Steve was studying graphic design at Pratt and Tony was getting a computer science degree to keep his earlier mechanical engineering degree from MIT company.  Steve, who was best of best friends with Barnes, who studied drama at NYU and dated Natasha, who was pals with Clint, who partied with Thor, who roomed with Bruce, who took class with Tony…
“Sometimes, I…” Steve starts, and then hesitates. Tony rubs his arm soothingly, presses a kiss to his neck to reassure him.
He curls his hand around the edge of the sliding door to steady himself, fingertips digging uselessly into the hard metal frame.
“Hill mentioned Barnes – is that what this is about?” Tony asks as they move.  He should be out front but he doesn’t know his way around this place like Clint and Natasha do.  He stays between them, weapons at the ready.
Tony scratches his eyebrow with his thumb, and bites his lip with annoyance as he considers the truth of Steve’s words.
“Director Fury – this all isn’t making any sense to me,” Bruce shakes his head, puzzled, evidently too caught up in sorting through the logic to start a rampage.  “If Barnes’ mission were to grab Steve, why did they send him into SHIELD headquarters, which would make such a mission ten times more difficult?  It’d surely be easier to let Barnes be spotted somewhere,
Watching the man fall, he’d found himself letting go of the ship, plummeting after him into the icy water of the river.  The man was sinking, slipping into unconsciousness.  Somewhere between the helicarrier and the water, he’d let go.  Maybe even before that, when he lay there and let his face be pummeled by angry fists.
“So I buried him. That Steve from before. He was gone. And I…I told myself I didn’t feel the same way about Steve after he changed. I let him go, Stark.” Bucky moves away from the railing, toward the windows, toward Steve. “But now he’s here. He’s right here.
“My room is soundproofed, Barton.  Don’t be a dipshit.  You’re not embarrassing me – you’re embarrassing Steve.”  Tony walks across the room like he’s merely going to grab the pumpkin for Bucky but it’s obvious he really does so in order to whack Clint upside the head.  He tempers his real annoyance with a joke, taking the edge off the honest warning.  “Embarrassing Captain America makes the angels cry.”
“Maybe hit Other Music afterward?”  Bruce suggests, talking over Natasha.  “I’m desperate for something experimental, electronic.”
“I’ll have my guy Happy come ‘round sometime and give you a run down on all the dos and don’ts.  They’re all very simple, really, but he knows all the ins and outs and quirks better than I do.”   He looks around the room again, catches sight of Steve in the mirrored wall, and makes a mental note to get Steve some workout clothes that aren’t army issue slacks and thin t-shirts painted on his body.  Maybe a pair of loose-fitting basketball shorts and an XXL tee.  That’d be so much easier to deal with.
“And it’s lasagna...tell me, did you go veggie or meat?” Natasha lifts one eyebrow as Tony evidently decides continuing on this tack is worth the gamble.  “I never would’ve figured you for a Giada, Nat.  How exactly
Steve tries to adjust a falling tendril of hair curling over Alice’s shoulder, but he can’t get the feel of it right.  His whole drawing is too clunky and too tight.  If the sculptor could somehow make the metal flow and come alive, he should be able to create the illusion with pencil on paper far more easily.
“I like what you’re doing.  Kinda reminds me of fire.” Tony lifts his chin toward Steve’s work but then goes back to his own, moving something on the diagram suspended in front of him.
Steve turns and finds his former conversation partner is long gone, evidently giving up; Pepper now stands beside him, a glass of champagne held out in offer.  Steve gingerly takes the delicate flute, trying to handle the exchange with as much grace as possible.  But Pepper isn’t watching him; she’s looking at Tony too, with a wry, knowing smile on her face.
“Yes, dear, be desperately jealous.” Jane deadpans back, and opens the double French doors leading to the patio and the backyard.
Instead of making his way to the training level, Tony seeks out Bruce in R&D.  They’ve been working on a global sweep and alert system that will notify Bruce of any Tesseract-like changes in the earth’s gamma output.  The glowing blue death cube and its endless energy should be safely ensconced in the Asgardian treasure chamber, but after the havoc the thing has wreaked, neither of them want to take any chances of missing an unexpected return.
Tony knows an invitation when he sees one and follows him over, pausing to gather lube and condoms from the drawer.  There’s a note alongside the packages and he opens the folded paper.
This part of the shipyard is empty this time of night and there are plenty of metal barrels suitable for disposal purposes.  He won’t even have to drag the body far from where the Captain currently stands.
“You’re making it sound so tawdry.” Steve turns from where he’s digging through his chest of drawers for a clean undershirt.
“I think I liked you much better when you weren’t officially part of the team,” Tony comments.  “Give you an inch, you take a mile.”
“I’m very sorry,” He says again to Wanda, now that he doesn’t have to whisper. “Is your arm all right?”
The Winter Soldier could have made these evil men vanish, bloodlessly and without fanfare. They could have been whispered away in the night with nary a trace, a mysterious disappearance never to be solved. He could have wiped HYDRA from the map swiftly and silently. Yet he had not. He had done all of this violently and explosively, knowing that he would not avoid attention.
He’s still dressed as he had been on the backlot, and his white t-shirt is soaked through, clinging to his biceps and chest like a second skin. Tony blinks and Steve is already across the room and at his side. He’s slightly out of breath and his cheeks are flushed with varying shades of pink, his lips tinged red as if they’ve been bitten, or maybe kissed. His bare arms are covered in gooseflesh, and so pale that Tony can see the blue-green of his veins running underneath the thin, delicate skin. His blue eyes are dark in the dimness of the café, and even his eyelashes – black despite his fair hair and so impossibly long – are damp. Water drips from his body onto the floor, and Tony watches as the pool of liquid seeps from around Steve’s feet to creep toward his.
He follows the Red Car line back to West Hollywood, the streets considerably more lively as the early birds start going out for breakfast, begin heading in to work. All the nightclubs and restaurants on Sunset look sad in the morning, however, drab without their lights dazzling, and their sidewalks dirty from revels the night before.
“You should probably know right now that my father and I didn’t exactly see eye-to-eye, to put it lightly. I really want no part of whatever he did here in Hollywood before.”
He doesn’t bother turning it off. The image is black and white but it’s crisp, and the sound is clear. Steve is on his back, Tony thrusting deep inside of him. Steve is beautiful and if he’s honest, so is Tony, made gorgeous by virtue of how clearly and thoroughly he cares for the man laid bare underneath him. They’re so wrapped up in each other, he probably could have walked right into the room and neither of them would have noticed.
“Hmm-hmm.” Steve lifts his head and tilts back just enough from the pillow to meet Tony’s kiss as Tony bends across his body and dips his lips to Steve’s.
The person standing above him is backlit by the sun and it makes it hard for him to make out anything more than his shape, and perhaps the light glinting off a pair of sunglasses.
“It’s all yours.” There’s no good reason for him to ask for its return if he’s never going to call the man. He shouldn’t have held onto it this long, and he should probably be glad the decision of whether or not to keep it is not really in his hands any longer.
“You’re the one who designed her, I’m only the pilot. A faulty landing mechanism would be all on you.”
Tony waits until he’s sure they’ve gone before letting out a long exhale, trying to will some of the stress from his body.  He leaves the dirty dishes on the counter and makes his way into the living room, collapsing onto his back on the couch.
“Look, Stark.  I truly appreciate your interest in the situation.   It can’t be easy listening to me complain.”
“You should get undressed if you’re gonna stay.”  Bucky mumbles almost distractedly, not lifting his own gaze from Steve’s body.  Steve looks downward and Tony follows suit, realizing his unflagging erection is still on open display between the unzipped flaps of his jeans, the rest of his clothes perfectly in order.  He must make a pretty stupid picture.
“Clearly that’s it.”  Tony is skeptical.  He takes a small, wary step away from her.  Doing so gives him a better look at what she’s wearing, and he has to laugh at the t-shirt she has on under her bedazzled denim crop jacket.  “I still cannot believe you went to that show.”
But now her smile implies that his distraction had something to do with the handsome mug onscreen, and it truly doesn’t. Not even a little.
“Steve.” Bucky sounds somewhere between touched and troubled, but Steve doesn’t let the moment hang.  His need for Bucky’s friendship is not an opinion to be argued and the place Bucky holds in his heart is not up for debate.  No matter what Bucky seems to think.
Tony has given him a confidence in this body that he never felt before, but he still blushes under the intensity of Bucky’s heated gaze. Bucky’s eyes drift down and then back up, his breath hitching as he takes in just how hard Steve already is for him. His mouth hangs open for a second, and then he licks his lips and swallows hard.
“The thought never crossed my mind.” Bucky lowers his voice to a tight hiss that slowly climbs back up to full volume as he continues on. “Really, Nat, that never occurred to me. I’m just the one who spent his entire childhood perpetually terrified that every little cough, every damned fever, would be the death of him. It’s not like I was up at 3 a.m. calling every hospital in the city or anything.”
“I’m shit with hugs, Cap, give me something to work with here.”  She mumbles against his chest and he has to smile a little, he has no choice.  Tentatively, he lets his arms fall down around her.
“Natasha has a habit of doing this.” Steve shrugs slightly. He’s not happy about the turn the evening has taken, but he’s grown to expect it every now and again from his friends. Honestly, he
“He knows you’re here.”  Clint states, apropos of nothing, as the elevator doors smoothly open and he leads the way inside.  He swipes a card, punches in a security code and grabs Steve’s hand, pressing his thumb to a small scanner.  Then Clint hits the button for floor fifty-eight.   “He’s in the lab with Banner and Dr. Ross.  They’ve been working with some of the top neuroscientists to try and defrag your friend’s mind.  That’s a hell of a thing.”
Tony reaches over, cradles Steve’s face against his palm and guides Steve to look at him.  Steve is surprised enough to let him this time. He’s even more surprised by the unguarded look of fondness in Tony’s eyes, the softness of his expression.
“I want you inside me.” Tony is already undoing Steve’s belt when the elevator slows to a stop. His stomach swoops low at the cessation of movement. Despite the obvious need to restore themselves to some level of decorum before entering the hallway, Tony slips a hand down the front of Steve’s pants anyway, stroking down his full length over the thin cotton of his underwear.
“Forget I said that. Just...what happened.” Bucky asks flatly, since Steve's disgruntled tone made it so obvious that something did. “And why the hell do your clothes smell like coconut.”
Natasha pushes him out onto the busy street, Clint following at much more leisurely pace.  Steve straightens out his red and white-checkered shirt, adjusting the buttons and the collar, and now that his world is steady and he’s not being shoved down a flight of stairs, he stops and takes Clint and Natasha in.
Steve’s sitting at the edge of the pool, body bathed in refracted light as the reflection of rippling water shimmers over his skin.  He’s been quiet since they left Vegas, but not quiet in the way he’d been before.
Somehow, Natasha’s admission still catches him off guard.  Maybe she falls asleep, maybe she’s just done talking, but she doesn’t say anything more.  This vulnerability she’s been offering him is her way of apologizing.  Tomorrow it’ll all be different.
Tony shakes himself from his thoughts, realizing he’s been silent for a good couple of minutes, his hand still covering the glass he’d placed between Steve’s fingers and his vacant gaze still seemingly trained on Steve’s face.
“That's not...it.” Tony's words catch as Steve ducks back out from behind the dressing screen, still buttoning his untucked shirt over his undershirt. He hasn't put on his shoes or suit coat either, and Tony seems taken aback. His sideways glance at Jan suggests his surprise at Steve's uncharacteristic lack of adherence to decorum in front of a woman.
He’s glad to see her and he lets himself feel it, tired of being angry about things that aren’t really her fault.  Nat can’t help that Bucky remembers kissing her, holding her, loving
It’s been days since they’ve had a moment to themselves, and as threadbare an excuse that Tony has concocted, Steve almost doesn’t care that it’s dangerously transparent.
“Uh-huh,” Tony agrees simply, smiling down at the top of Steve’s head and patting his hair in a patronizing way. Bucky knows it’s in jest but it somehow makes him hate Tony all the more. The privilege of poking fun at Steve and getting away with it used to be his and his alone. “JARVIS has loaded up the queue with all the old Katharine Hepburn movies he could get his figurative hands on, and I have a stack of crosswords and Sudoku and all that junk for you. I probably killed a whole forest because you won’t use the damn tablet.”
“Tasha.”  Tony smiles to himself, shaking his head.  “Never heard anyone dare call her that before.”
The mood shifts as the train trundles into the 42nd Street station, and he’s honestly not sure if it’s Tony that’s apprehensive or if it’s him.  Their car had been getting progressively more congested since Queensboro Plaza, but that’s nothing compared to the teeming platform that awaits them at Times Square.
Tony puts his hands on Steve’s hips and puts everything into kissing Steve as deeply and as thoroughly as he can.  There aren’t enough words to tell Steve everything he feels.  Steve sinks into the kiss, softening and slowing it down.  His hands come up to cradle Tony’s face, those broad palms and long, strong fingers so careful as they touch.
“Well I’m hardly earning any Michelin Stars, but I can manage the basics. Bucky and I can’t survive on cold cuts alone.” He gives Tony’s hands a squeeze. “Think about what you’d like and let me know.”
“I don’t even know where the shot came from.  But three bullets hit our Jolly Green Giant right in the kisser and exploded on impact, letting out some kind of super concentrated gas.  Enough to knock out several herds of elephants.  Scientifically speaking, of course.”
“What stays between us?” He’s honestly not sure what he just witnessed, his brain still processing the fact that Mr. Stark and Captain America, who until three weeks ago were not even
As he walks out, Tony pretends not to see Steve smile.  It feels too much like exactly what Tony really wanted.
“Not about my side of things.” Bucky lets it go, finally, saying it aloud for the first time in his entire life. “I’ve always been crazy about him.” He smiles brokenly to himself. Only about seventy years too late.
Tony’s the two steps it takes to get to the door before he turns back, plucking a plastic ID card from the back pocket of his jeans.   He slips it into the front breast pocket of Steve’s seriously outdated pajamas and pats his hand over it against Steve’s chest.
But there is no message from Tony. Steve thinks back on their conversation from that afternoon, wondering if he’d maybe misunderstood, or is misremembering their plan. He’s pretty sure he’s correct.
Tony kisses him. He can hear Bucky’s voice in the back of his head, his low words of warning thundering like a scream, but it’s quickly drowned out by the racing of his heart and the pounding of blood through his veins.
“She wouldn’t do that,” Steve retorts quickly and Tony doesn’t doubt for a second that Steve believes it.   He’s about to ask Steve when he saw Nat when Steve presses on, still answering the list of questions that Tony has already forgotten he asked.  “And the radio…well, the radio is comforting.”
Tony backs away quickly, signaling to Pepper that he’s not here, definitely not available to take Phil’s call. Pepper nods, barely stopping herself from rolling her eyes.
Tony helps Maria free of the rubble and despite Tony’s warning not to move, she hobbles over to Fury’s side and reaches out a hand to shake his shoulder.
“Can I get you a drink before we talk business?” Tony holds himself carefully back from reaching out and touching Steve as he moves past him and into the house. The smell of him – his cologne and his soap and something that’s just
“Okay. Why don’t you check in with Dernier about getting the grips to set the overhead rigging and then touch base with Lang and make sure we’re on track with the electricians on that count as well.”
“Because she thought Howard was in love with him.  Okay?”  Tony’s never told anyone that before, but in admitting it aloud he suddenly knows it’s not true.
,” Tony retorts.  Steve opens his mouth to say something unkind and barely manages to stop himself.  He’s not playing this game.  Tony sighs, tries a different angle.  “I meant the art studio as a gift, Steve.”
Steve levels him with a flat look, clearly not game for whatever Tony’s about to do.  Tony ignores him.  He sets his hands firmly on Steve’s shoulders, meeting his glare straight on.
poster, afraid to make eye contact with anyone and encourage further speculation as to their identities.
“I’m going to be poaching talent all over town, Pep. That’s the way this works. We’re gonna have to get used to a few ruffled feathers now and again.” Tony shrugs to himself. Ross could thunder until he's red in the face, it makes not the slightest difference to him. He gets the sense that not many people actually like the cigar-chomping blowhard anyway, and the last two pictures he produced wildly underperformed. There are worse people to upset.
The next night is Céline Dion, who is apparently some big time singer from Canada.  She’s got a great voice and puts on a heck of a show.  When he leans over to Tony midway through her first set, ready to tell Tony so, Tony speaks before he does.
Clint reluctantly digs into his wallet and hands over a bill.  Darcy rolls it up and tucks it into her leopard-print bra.  That’s when Tony notices the small metal circle tag clasped to the center of the plunging v-neckline of her teal t-shirt, the purple clip-on button decorated with an ivy-twined white M.
“Very…luxurious?”  He’s not quite sure if that’s the right word to use, but it will have to do.  He can’t get over the size of the place; he’d known people lived like this, but in the abstract, not as a reality.  He tries to imagine a child running around these halls and can’t picture it.  “Must’ve been something, growing up here.”
“I'm not trying to court you, Tony, I was just trying to tell you something nice about yourself." Considering the slightly romantic bent of his thoughts over the past few minutes, the conversation is becoming uncomfortable.  Steve looks at the windows of the townhouses lining the opposite side of the street, focusing on the hundreds-year-old architecture just to still his racing thoughts.
Sighing, Steve steps away from the sink and climbs into the shower. The water is scalding on his skin and even though the pain is bright and sharp, he doesn’t move from the spray. He closes his eyes and ducks his head under the steady stream of water.
“Tony,” he says again, in an entirely different register. Lust shoots through Tony’s veins like a drug.
“Your bed’s fine too,” Steve stands up, trailing a hand through Tony’s hair.  Tony leans into his touch.  The Quinjet jolts and rocks as Clint sets it down, the landing less graceful than usual.
“What Steve needs is a distraction.  I’m distracting.  And I’ll keep distracting him until he’s ready to come back to New York and face the fact that life has thrown him yet
“So.” He starts, nudging Steve’s mug back to him and then taking a sip of his own coffee, staring at Steve over the rim.
“Yes, don’t sound so surprised.” Tony frowns. “Just some kid who came to me begging for a job last week. Claims to be a genius, though I have yet to see evidence of it. Bit of a wiseass.”
“All we need now are some pigeons and the stink of the subway and it will be as if I never left home.”
When he finally goes home, he stops half a block from his building and watches for a few minutes.  No one seems to be waiting for him.  He had expected Natasha or Fury or some low-ranking SHIELD official whose thankless job it would be to drag him back in, but there’s no one.   It doesn’t matter, really.  He should be grateful.  He doesn’t want to go back there, and he doesn’t want to go to the tower.
“Man, seems not that long ago we were in this neck of the woods to send Hannibal Lecter back home to Asgard without his dinner.”  Steve is able to surmise that he means Loki so he doesn’t ask for further explanation.  Probably just another pop culture reference for him to maybe someday understand.
Then again, he made and subsequently ignored that exact same argument before. That’s how Steve wound up here tonight in the first place.
“It looks like those who were critically injured are going to make it, and Fury already has leads on the group that planted the bomb on the tanker.  It may even be corporate espionage, not political terrorism.  Not that that makes what happened any better, but there will be fewer global repercussions if that’s the case.”
“One of these days you’re going to listen to me.” Steve murmurs, and something like relief washes over Tony.  He reaches up and pats Steve’s dirty cheek.
“I don’t miss bustin’ my ass like that.” Sam looks down and flexes his fingers like he’s grateful he has piano player’s hands. “Though at least Nick pays us decent here.”
restoration at Film Forum that night.” Tony says quietly, surreptitiously reaching to tug on the end of Steve’s scarf and get his full attention.  “Or, you know,
“Well, let’s be fair, Pep – we can’t be down on everyone who’s not as brilliant as we are.  Wouldn’t leave many people for us to talk to.  Or sleep with.”
Pepper gets up and stands over him, crossing her arms over her chest and looking down at him with disappointment like a scornful schoolteacher would a misbehaving student.
“You just got him back in your life, Bucky.” She steps closer to him, the hard edge of her voice softening slightly. “I don’t know what’s going on, but if you keep acting like this when he needs you most –”
” Tony is obstinate. “I know this may not seem rational to you, but this thing between Steve and Bucky is bigger than Steve and me. It just is. That’s facts, and my denying that is not going to change a damn thing. These are circumstances that no one else in the world could possibly understand. They grew up during a time when they couldn’t admit how they felt, and then this frankly crazy shit with the serum and the war and their supposed deaths and both of them coming back all these years later and then all this shit with Bucky's memory...” Tony pauses to take a deep breath. “There’s no playbook for this. This situation has literally never happened before to anyone else in the history of all recorded time.”
“I didn't mean you, darling.” To prove her point, she lifts up onto her tiptoes to place a feather-light kiss to Steve's cheek. “Pop down from there, lovely, you should go get changed back into your street clothes. Wouldn't want to wear this beautiful piece out and spoil the surprise before the big night, would we?”
“Public.” Steve corrects, fixing his underwear to cover his erection.  “Rather not have someone walk in on us.”
“I live nearby, so it was no trouble,” Steve replies, his conversation with Happy coming back into mind. “Thank you for sending Happy. The Delahaye is a beautiful automobile.”
“Crosswords should be on newspaper, you need paper,” Steve mutters drowsily. Tony nods knowingly, like he’s heard this all before.
It’s time to bring on some serious action and get this shit done before any more of old New York is smashed before his eyes.  The last thing he needs is Banner setting to work on the Empire State Building; Steve would never recover.  Tony arms the missiles in his shoulder panels, Extremis working with JARVIS to ensure accuracy.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve greets him in a soft and low mumble.  Tony lets his hand slip higher, fingers brushing Steve’s calf underneath the loose leg of his jeans.  The muscles shift beneath his touch, Steve stretching a little.
He shifts down the bed, running his hands over Steve’s body, just feeling him react.  He’s never felt so powerful and powerless at the same time.  He touches and touches, flat of his palms moving over Steve’s skin, trying to follow Steve’s cues and not push him too far too fast.
The film cuts back to the office, where Steve re-enters and stops short at the door upon finding the room empty. The film ends on a lingering long shot of the street as that black car drives off into the distance and disappears over the crest of the horizon.
Steve sighs as Tony reaches the top of the stairs, now close enough to touch if he dared. Steve smells a little like booze and garlic, but underneath it’s mostly like him, like citrus and cedarwood.
“We’ll have to wait and see, but this may mean that Barnes has turned a corner of some kind.  If that’s in fact the case, how would you feel about eventually offering him a home at Stark Mansion?”
“I don’t know where to go…” Steve says, sounding lost, and Tony wants to slap him.  Man with a plan, what the hell.  Dude can take on Red Skull and Loki and Chitauri and he’s cowed by the prospect of finding a suite with the Stark name slapped on the door?
“Should be towels, soap, all the amenities, even fancy fluffy bathrobes with my initials on them.  Feel ‘em, they’re nice.”  Tony lifts up the sleeve of the one that’s hanging on the hook but doesn’t wait for Steve to touch it before dropping it and moving on.   “Shower or bath, for whatever suits your fancy.  Sure beats sleeping on the side of the road, doesn’t it?”
“You’re givin’ me flashbacks here, Rogers.  Haven’t had to be your damn nursemaid in a real long time.”  Bucky sets the cup aside.  “Have to say, haven’t really missed seeing you in a sickbed.  Thought I’d seen the last a’ this when you Capped up.”
Steve gets the distinct feeling that he’s being sold on something, and he wonders if he’s been as obvious about his unease with Tony as he was about being chauffeured. He smiles at Happy and nods, hoping it will pass for tacit agreement.
He’s found over the years that it’s all well and good to be designing and building the sets, but when it comes to dressing them, he’s better off keeping his opinions to himself. He hasn’t come across a team yet that doesn’t resent his two cents.
“Cap.  Really. Have I ever been someone to toe the company line?  Fury wants you back, Hill or one of his other flunkies are going to have to do the dirty work and drag you in kicking and screaming.  I’m just…I’m here, is what I am.” He looks around the tiny, podunk town and shrugs.  “Wherever here is.”
“Hey.”  Steve gets his attention back, leaning down and placing another gentle kiss to his lips.  He smiles brightly when he pulls away, and Tony forgets absolutely everything except the man standing in front of him.
“Let’s walk.” Tony thumbs over his shoulder, already three steps down the path.  “I’m getting unpleasantly moist out here in the wide open.” Raindrops are sending ripples pitter-patter over the surface of the conservatory water now.  Steve hadn’t really noticed but now he sees that Tony’s gray suit coat and pale purple shirt are spotted, his artfully styled hair damp.
“It has been nice getting to see you more these past two weeks, all of us being in the city. Carol and I are headed back to the West Coast soon, though. Next week, maybe.”
“That man’s idea of acceptable risk is ludicrous.” Tony is dumbfounded by the lack of reason in this whole situation.  “Is Steve going to be okay?  Tell me he’s all right.”
?  And what the hell were they trying to teach you?  That it’s still a no-no to solicit gay sex in public rest rooms?”
Tony stumbles into their kitchen around 10am, blinking sleep from his blurry eyes. He hadn’t meant to sleep in, but apparently he’d been more strung out last night than he realized. He supposes the anxiety of his and Steve’s situation had taken its toll. It’s not every night he talks to his boyfriend about being in love with someone else.
." Steve throws Tony a look as he settles his collar straight. "She might actually want to see you." Tony rubs his chin, tilting his head and smiling wryly.
“I think we’re over that.  We both got each other wrong.  Bygones.  I mean, if you need to hug it out, guess we can.  But we don’t need to.”
After that misadventure, Tony destroyed all variations of his Iron Man armor, removed the power source from inside his chest, and officially retired.  Fury almost seemed peeved about that, as if he’d finally gotten used to trusting Stark at the very moment Stark decided to give the whole thing up.
“I’m impatient.”   He picks up the sugar from the table and pours a large amount into his cup.  “This coffee is awful.”
“Natasha.”  Her name is as far as he gets.  He hasn’t had much time to sort through the mix of conflicting emotions that surround her.
“Pshh, I’m rewarding them handsomely for their patience, they all don’t mind.”  He waves off her concern, but this is the first time Steve’s heard a word of them overstaying their welcome.  He glances around the room, instantly ashamed.
“You actually mentioned something like that last night over dinner.” Steve sounds sheepish about it, like he should have known better and taken Tony's behavior in stride. “And also, you may have been right. A little bit. About my being scared,” Steve concedes, too kind to even let Tony shoulder all the blame for this whole debacle. Tony’s not having it.
“Talking about you, actually,” Tony shoots back.  Clint glances at the paper clutched in Steve’s hand and then shoots Steve a look of horror.
“Did he suck you?” Tony murmurs before flicking his tongue out to lick the tip of Steve’s cock, then carefully trace a line around the head.
An old song is playing on the stereo.  It echoes across the alleyway and finds him on his rooftop.  It distracts him momentarily from his mission, sending a jolt of
type of relationship.  He’d nearly melted down when they finally moved in together, even after Steve had waited for Tony to suggest the idea on his own.
“What’s going on?”  Steve’s not sure his words actually come out the way he means them.  Or if they come out at all.  It sounds more like an unintelligible croak.  “Who are you?”  As he comes back into himself, he starts to remember what was happening when he was grabbed.
Condensation quickly obscures their reflections, however, and Steve wants to see him, wants Tony face-to-face. He pulls out and spins Tony around, lifts him up onto the edge of the sink.
“Leave it,” Steve mumbles into his mouth, following Tony’s lead toward their bedroom.  He ends up colliding with the wall at the foot of the stairs, both of them chuckling breathlessly as their hands work at each other’s pants, Steve tugging at his belt eagerly.  Tony gets Steve’s jeans open, shoves them down over the sharp cut of his hips.
A kiss cuts him off, Tony’s lips quite an effective silencer.  As other people load into other cars, their own car ticks upward slowly.
“You were saying Stark’s MIA?” Sam tries again, and Steve snorts to himself. That’s one way of putting it. The last time he’d seen Tony, they’d fucked on his bedroom floor, unable to control themselves, and then…that was it. Radio silence. Tony had said he’d call him from New York City and that he’d only be gone a few days, but there had been no call. As far as he knew, the man was still all the way across the country.
“Hi, Steve.  We’re so sorry to drop by unannounced, but we were in the neighborhood.  I hope you’ll forgive our intrusion?”
“And then one night Steve kissed you and you realized you were wrong.” Bucky mumbles, knowing that part of the story. Steve had told him the day after, grinning like a fool and his head up in the clouds, and Bucky honestly, truly, barely felt a twinge. His feelings for Steve were locked up so tightly in a small little box marked
“Stevie.”  Tony repeats to himself, chuckling a little.  He can’t even imagine calling Steve that as anything but a tease.  Bucky says it naturally and with genuine affection.
“Have I ever steered you wrong before, Dum Dum?” Steve points out, forcing a smile to lighten the mood.
“There’s still breakfast,” Tony comments, nodding his head back over his shoulder down the hallway toward the kitchen.
All Tony can do is nod, relaxing as all his body readings start sinking back to normal.  He stares at Steve – at Steve’s
"Courting?” Tony starts, slapping Steve’s elbow.  “Cap, I will pay good money to witness you courting
Away from the hubbub, the backlot is strangely empty. It’s odd to go from a bustling hive of action to desolate sidewalks, but it’s a good kind of odd, a soothing kind of odd. It makes him feel a world away. The architecture is turning from the Upper West Side into Brooklyn when Tony stumbles across someone else who must have also been seeking the solitude.
“Booze goes on the table, baked goods in the kitchen.” Natasha commands flatly.  She gestures in each direction with the knife and, apparently done with Tony, goes to finish with the bread.
The common room is only six floors from the top platform of the tower.  Steve slowly crosses to the floor-to-ceiling glass windows that allow him a bird’s eye view of the city, looking south down the length of Manhattan.  It’s a breathtakingly beautiful sight, even now, maybe even more so.  He can mark off 42nd Street, 34th Street, 23rd Street, even Union Square these days, just by the skyline; it’s reassuring.  On the nights when Bucky’s attempts at double dates inevitably turned into Steve wandering off on his own, he’d go to the base of the Brooklyn Bridge and stare at Manhattan as the sun went down and the buildings slowly lit up, bright windows climbing pitter patter toward the sky.  The city was such a short walk away but it seemed so far, then.  It made him feel small and unimportant.
“And like I said, I tinker myself. I mean, granted, it used to be weapons, war machinery, things of that nature, but I’ve re-oriented. Looking to explore new areas and apply my talents elsewhere.”
He gives Steve everything he’s got but the angle is difficult with one hand smothering Steve’s cries of pleasure, so eventually he gives up, plants both hands on Steve’s chest for leverage and starts nailing Steve’s prostate on every thrust.
“It’s not what you think.” Steve starts to explain, re-buckling his belt, but Tony just shakes his head in refusal.
“Aren’t like, 75% of American movies set in New York?  People outside the U.S. probably think this city is all there is, the way we play it up.”  Steve is surprised he understood a word of what Clint said around the new fistful of popcorn stuffed in his mouth, but deciphering garbled statements must be a new skill he’s picked up from living with the archer these past six months.  “You ever think, if Hollywood stopped doing that, crazy supervillains would stop attacking it so much?  It’s practically painting a bulls-eye.  I mean…we deal with an absurd amount of nonsensical bullshit here, you gotta admit.”
“Did I promote you? Is this your job?” Tony grumbles from beneath the down pillow, willing it to come to life and smother him.
“Yeah, all that clean living,” Steve laughs, the sound of it tinged sardonic as Tony rubs his cock filthily against his lips, sloppy and wet. He runs his mouth up and down the sides of Steve’s length a few times before swallowing him again. He can only take Steve down two-thirds of the way before Steve’s near hitting the back of his throat, so Tony concentrates a lot of attention on the head, using his hands instead to touch the full length of his cock and to caress over and behind the sensitive skin of Steve’s sac. Steve sighs so heavenly whenever Tony slips a finger farther back to brush over his hole.
New York doesn’t look the same.  From the sky or from the streets, the shape of the city has shifted.
“I’ve seen how you move in the field, Cap, I really don’t think you need to be told what to do,” Tony says.  Steve opens his mouth to counter that opinion but Tony cuts him off.  “We can take on the waltz next time.  This time out, just do what feels natural.”
“I’ll go with you if you want, Thor,” Steve offers, even though he’s admittedly tired of both Fleet Foxes and Misty.  Thor responds with an incredibly pleased smile.
“We should maybe go back in, watch the ball drop with everyone?”  Steve suggests, rubbing his hands over Tony’s arms and back to heat him up.
“Think I’m more of a Lou Gehrig type,” Scott counters. “That’s beside the point. Which is – you’re supposed to be mentoring this kid, not me. I thought this was a gig, not a fucking episode of
They’re all lonely today, no children scampering around, climbing up on the mushrooms to peer more closely at Alice’s face.  There are no model boats on the nearby water and even most of the birds seem to have nestled away elsewhere.  The park is eerily quiet.
“We don’t have another minute, Tony.” He lifts his arm to look at his own watch, frowning. “Someone will come knocking any second now.”
“Something’s off with the shutter speed, I’m trying to figure out what it is without gutting the entire thing and rebuilding it.”
“I’ll let Fury know as soon as I work something up.”  Tony promises softly, the words choking in his throat.
So even if Pepper had all the facts, she probably wouldn’t have been able to stop this anyway.  When Captain Steven G. Rogers opened his eyes on the year 2012, Tony falling in love with him was a foregone conclusion.
“Excuse me,” the waitress states, reaching between them to set down their plates.  Steve’s cheeks are flushed, color high.  Tony smiles up at their server, murmuring a thank you.
As Thor begins to demonstrate his method to Clint, the sound of a text message arriving echoes around the small group.  Everyone immediately pats their pockets, pulls out their phones.
“Tony?”  Steve rolls his neck, slightly stiff from sleeping.  “What’re you doin’, sittin’ alone in the dark?”
“Steve Rogers for you, boss,” Happy announces. By the time Tony gets up the nerve to turn around, Happy is gone. It’s only Steve.
.”  Steve clues Tony into what Bucky’s getting at. Tony repositions himself accordingly. Steve cries out and nearly sits up when Tony closes his mouth over his hole, sucking and kissing before thrusting his tongue inside.
“I think the last time I gave you a bath, you were at death’s door with a bad case of pneumonia,” Bucky says, wrapping a strong hand around Steve’s thin wrist. “I wouldn’t mind having a nicer memory to replace that one.”
The marquee and façade for the Paramount still exist, but that’s all they are.  He’d been disappointed to find out that the theater had long since been replaced with offices or apartments or something, leaving the historical landmark of the Paramount logo on the edifice.
Stepping up onto the sidewalk, he adjusts the worn strap of his messenger bag, which at this point seems held together more by the music and film festival wristbands he has wrapped around it than by actual fabric and thread.  It takes him a moment to lean over and unhook the portable radio he’d snapped to the bars of the bike, but he eventually gets it loose.  He turns off NPR and tucks the radio away in his bag beside the bundle of photography books he’d bought early that morning at Strand.
Tony’s knees bump the edge of the mattress as he stops by Steve’s feet.  He wants to touch, reach out and at the very least close a hand around Steve’s ankle, run his palm up Steve’s muscled calf.  He puts a hand against the cool fabric of the comforter instead, noticing for the first time that Steve and Bucky hadn’t even bothered to unmake their bed.
Bucky mistakes Steve’s steady gaze as implied derision, as if Steve means to wordlessly question his stance on the subject.
He watches as Steve drags the razor down his cheek, the swath of shaving cream disappearing to reveal smooth skin underneath.  His hand is steady and sure, his movements careful but efficient.  Steve catches his gaze in the mirror again as he rinses the razor clean.  Tony doesn’t look away, finds he doesn’t want to.
?  He’s in love with Natasha?  That’s what’s been…” Tony slides down from the counter, his face twisting in puzzlement.  “Hold up.  Can we…yeah, lose this.” He reaches over and takes Steve’s mug from his hands, sets it aside.  “There we go.”
“Yeah,” Steve mumbles, letting Clint go.  He probably has other things to do, and Steve wouldn’t know what to say anyway.
“I have his old agent’s number…a Miss Peggy Carter. We’ve already been in touch with her regarding the
“I know what seatbelts –“ Steve stops, deciding it’s not worth the argument.  He yanks the belt across his shoulder and his midsection and snaps it into place.  “Will you at least tell me where we’re going, please?”
“Does that really matter?”  Pepper remains silent but she doesn’t move away.  It’s her way of not backing down so he supposes yes, it does matter.  “My mother wanted Howard to stop looking for him.  All those trips he would take to the Artic…he’d be gone too often, it took too much money, and every time he failed he just got that much angrier.  It was all for nothing, Cap’s body was never going to be found, and she wanted to put an end to it.”
Nick tosses the towel over his shoulder, and then reaches over and pulls Steve’s tumbler from his loose grasp. Steve sputters and Nick briefly mimics his gaping before snapping at him.
“I thought you two were madly in love with each other. I kept bracing myself for the day you finally told us all the truth and then rode off into the sunset.”
“I can handle all that,” Steve replies.  There’s not much there.  The furniture came with the place; he’s got some clothes, a few photos, maybe a couple of books and his laptop computer.  He can barely remember what the apartment looks like, considering he has spent the last few months in various hotels, safe houses, and SHIELD bases, living out of a duffel and sleeping on narrow cots, if sleeping at all.
“For the good of the team, huh?”  Steve asks with a slight wheeze, looking up at her as she towers above him, smirking just a little.  She grabs his hand and helps him up.
“As is…all this?” Tony gestures toward the table covered in schematics. He clears off the litter of screws and bolts and other mess from the top of the pile of papers, and studies the camera design laid out in front of him. “You are clearly a man of many talents, Banner.”
“Tony?” Steve stutters out, faintly surprised and already a little breathless. Tony wraps his fingers around Steve’s cock; he’s already half-hard too. Tony’s hips hitch against Steve’s backside involuntarily.
time?”  This question is rhetorical and JARVIS knows enough to remain silent.  “My standing invitation has been repeatedly stood up.  Next time, announce it, kay?”
is a big deal but doesn’t want to get into it.  Steve obliges him by letting it go, because he knows Tony actually divulges more when allowed to do it on his own terms.
.” He stares at Tony, wanting him to understand. He doesn’t want to come between Steve and Tony, he doesn't want them to break up, but he just never expected that Tony would be the one to get what Bucky always wanted. To see Tony as the one to hold Steve’s thin, delicate body in his arms, to see that slight difference in how he smiled and laughed, or even the way his hair was a little softer and wispier as it fell over his forehead, his fingers so long and elegant when he brushed the wayward strands back.  Those had been his memories, and now Tony has them too.
“Sure.”  It doesn’t sound like Tony believes him.  “This doesn’t bother you at all.”  Tony doesn’t say anything more, perhaps waiting to see if he’ll answer the implied question.
”   Natasha recites this with such lack of emotion that it takes Tony a moment to fully process its importance.
“Eh, it’s short-term, so don’t get too excited.  Goes like this: fix your bike, find me a bike, and then find you a razor.  That’s as far as it goes.”
Pepper gives Steve a kiss too, brief and sweet, then brushes her thumb over his cheek like she’s wiping away the lipstick she left behind.  She looks at Tony.
“Yes, well, I suppose all things considered, I do have the better end of that stick.”  He grabs a bottle of mineral water from the doublewide refrigerator and cracks it open.  By the time the heavy stainless steel door falls closed, Natasha has disappeared from the room.
“I really thought I might never see you again,” Tony murmurs, tilting his face upward, unconsciously drifting toward Steve’s mouth.  Steve’s forehead presses against his and they hold each other like they did during that moment by the pond in Aspen, that instant when Tony had realized he was in way over his head with this man.
“You’ve followed me this far,” Tony whispers back. Tony’s hand caresses his hip, innocent enough to be passed off as an accidental touch if anyone had been paying attention. They break away from each other as they approach a narrow back staircase that necessitates them to wind their way down in single file. It’s four flights before they come to a heavy oak door with an elaborate lock.
for this man.  He reaches up and grabs Steve by both sides of his head, pulling him down to plant a sloppy smack of a kiss to his forehead.  He lets him go with flourish.
Sure enough, he feels Steve’s heartbeat pick up immediately, like a frantic bird trying to escape an unwanted cage. Steve sucks in a sharp breath but pauses before replying, evidently trying to do what Tony asked, and not jump to any conclusions about where Tony’s going with this.
“And that rates me the cold shoulder.”  It’s not a question, because a question would mean concern, disbelief, perhaps reveal emotional injury and personal investment, and Natasha’s above all that.  It’s just a cool observation, delivered like a sit rep or a comment on the weather.
“Really.” Natasha drums her fingers on the tabletop, bright yellow painted nails tapping a steady rhythm against the worn wood.
Bucky’s alive.  That’s why…yeah, that’s why he and Tony came back to New York.  Because Bucky was in danger.  You have to be alive to be in danger.  That’s only logical, right?  It’s through sheer force of will that Steve manages to open his eyes and look at the man at his bedside.
Even so, some mornings when Steve wakes up and Tony’s sleeping beside him, beautiful in the early morning light, he so badly wants to know it will last forever.
He sighs, wishing not for the first time that he had more control over these projects. But if he’d wanted control, he should’ve stuck to painting or drawing or sculpting, any other art form that allowed him to work entirely on his own.
“We’re going to SHIELD HQ.  Fury’s called us in.  The rest of the gang’s already there, they’re waitin’ on us.  I oh-so-luckily got the task of corralling the wayward Cap.”  Tony glances at Steve finally, looking him up and down.  His nose wrinkles.  “You smell, by the way.”
“I’m sure they have much more important things to worry about, Buck.”  He glances at his own monitors, not really knowing what any of the lines and beeps and strange numbers mean, but sure that if anything was really wrong everything wouldn’t seem so steady.  When he looks back to his friend, Steve finds him staring.  “What is it?”
than a kiss. It’s already leading somewhere, promising something. They tilt and shift to get deeper, mouths open, tongues sliding. Steve’s feeling too warm, his heart thudding out of time in his chest.
“I’m gonna come, Steve, come with me, oh god, please…” Bucky pleads, as if Steve would for a moment deny him. Steve nods helplessly, their kiss once again turning into shared gasps, mouths brushing as they struggle to breathe.
“He’s not going to let you within arm’s reach of Sergeant Barnes, you have to know that.”  Pepper is evidently closer behind him than he thought.  “Last time-“
It only takes two floors before Steve moves his gaze from the numbered lights above the doors to sneak a sideways glance at Tony.
“If you’re sure,” Loki says, leaning slightly back. He waits a moment for Steve to recant, and Steve bites his tongue. Loki shrugs. “Then I suppose our business is concluded. You should really get back to your seat…people might begin to wonder where you are. I wouldn’t want your last night of fame to be ruined. Or your last night of freedom, truly – I mean, they
- one of the few television shows worth anyone’s time – and even then, Tony started to re-consider the sci-fi drama’s merits.  After all, the stuff with Kara, at the end…?
Steve looks up and down Surf Avenue, feeling content as Tony rambles on beside him. They turn down Stillwell to make their way toward  the boardwalk and Steeplechase Pier, where there's a cool breeze coming off the ocean to provide brief respite from the summer heat.
A sharp laugh escapes him – Steve can’t help it. Leave it to Tony to say something so outrageous at a time like this. The laugh unexpectedly turns into a choked off sob, one emotion shaking another loose.
“Rogers, wait a second.” Sam’s hand lands firmly on his shoulder, and Steve begrudgingly stops and turns around. “Steve, seriously – you all right? 'Cause you don’t look all right.”
He doesn’t want to deal but it’s there, and it’s all shouting at him incessantly, a cacophony impossible to ignore.
He pushes open the door, and, after taking a split second to look up and down the hallway, grabs Steve’s tie. Tony winds him in close and backs him inside.
They go straight back to work as soon as they reach the tower.  Pepper is waiting for them in the lab.  She already has a new file from SHIELD up on the holo.
Steve nods again, lips dancing across Bucky’s as he does, and Bucky makes a small, pained sound and captures Steve’s mouth with his. He starts gentle, like he’s giving Steve time to back out, so Steve pulls Bucky closer to him, insistent. Bucky groans just a little and gives into it completely.
“I honestly didn't mean to be insulting. Bucky and Natasha are good at what they do, that's all—I only wanted to help.”
In the distance Steve can hear the music from the carousel, light and airy, drifting down the boardwalk.  Tony’s gaze ticks down to Steve’s lips, and for some reason that’s all it takes.
Tony pulls off gently, lips wrapped around the sensitive tip of Steve’s leaking cock, the taste of him gathering on the flat of his tongue.  Steve’s eyes flutter open and Tony stares up at him as he wraps his fingers around the impressive girth and pumps slowly, finally looking at the full length of him and letting the visual sink in.  He memorizes it, the weight and heat in his hand, tracing the thick vein as blood surges downward to swell Steve’s dick impossibly larger in his grasp.
“Better for now if you stay safe and out of sight, Dr. Ross.  Last thing we need is for Hulk to think you’re in any kind of danger.  Natasha and I will head up and try to engage.  We can’t have him leaving the premises and if we need to take some hits to do that, so be it.”
“I am a nimble one,” Loki leans in confidingly, like it’s a well-kept secret. “When good old Tony ran off to New York like a scared little child, why, I thought I had missed my golden opportunity.” He pauses as if expecting Steve to interject, but Steve can’t find his voice. Loki clucks his tongue and continues. “I’ve had my suspicions about you two since I heard murmurings of private on-set meetings inside your trailer, mind you, but I never could come up with the goods.”
sent here to New York with every intention of making Steve come to him.  Our working theory is that on some level, Barnes knew what he’d been sent here to do, and resisted his programming.  Turned himself in to protect the Cap.”
“In New Mexico with Jane.”  Clint heads for the stairwell, yanking one of his arrows from the body of an enemy soldier that is strewn across the floor.  The dead man’s uniform is non-descript and Tony doesn’t recognize anything familiar about his face or anything particularly special about his weaponry.  “We couldn’t get through to him, I don’t know if Hill managed before communications were cut off.”
He can feel the weight of Pepper’s gaze resting on the side of his face, unrelenting.  He hates that she can read him so well.  Usually she lets him slide when he’s holding something back, says something to let him off the hook, but this time she doesn’t.
“Dunno, I kinda like it,” Steve replies, moving toward the house as Pepper reappears in the doorway, holding up two oversized towels.  Tony falls in step beside him.
“Unfortunately there were two fatalities, but it seems the men were killed instantly when the bomb exploded.  There was nothing we could have done.  We managed to get everyone else to safety.  It might have been easier if Thor was back on planet in order to quickly airlift more of the injured clear of the fire, but Sam is useful in that regard.  As it was, we managed fine.”
impressive. They’ve even added bums for authenticity,” Tony quips loudly when the man doesn’t stir. The joke does the trick, the man snapping to like he’s been slapped awake.
Once his skin is cleaned of come, now only sticky and shining from Tony’s spit, Steve tries to bring Tony up to kiss him properly. Tony demurs, ducking his head to sear a path down Steve’s neck to his sharp collarbone.
Bucky purses his lips, his gaze still judgmental. He doesn’t say anything to dispel the tension, instead waiting for Steve to continue.
“Pepper, I’ll be right back.” Tony informs her distractedly, moving toward the door like a man in a trance.
.” The last word pushes out on a puff of air as Steve dips his index finger inside. Steve’s so big; the time it would take to properly prepare just isn’t really time they’ve got.
“Acts his age.  He’s been through a lot, yes, but not like Steve.  Sam’s a twenty-nine year old in a twenty-nine year old’s body.  Steve’s ninety and twenty-six at the same time.”
Steve smells like rain and tastes like mint, fresh and clean from the shower, still damp enough to feel cool against his skin when Steve bends to press kisses along his neck.  Tony sets down his coffee in order to twine his fingers in Steve’s hair, urging him on.
“I resent the implication.” He doesn’t really. It’s probably true enough, although his love life has been remarkably uneventful since he and Pepper decided to keep things professional and friendly rather than romantic. Well, since Pepper decided. Tony had nodded at some point in that conversation, just to make it mutual. “Just once I’d like to see you turn that frown upside down, Miss Potts.”
“JARVIS can take care of the fiery inferno part, I just came down here to survey the damage.”  Tony looks around the perfectly pristine and not-at-all singed room and sighs.  “We’ve been Parent Trapped.”
“I’m sorry, did we not share the same childhood?”  Bucky pretends confusion.  “Sister Mary Constance was in league with the devil.”
The gauntleted hand Iron Man places on the Captain's hip is intimate but his tone is sly, joking. The Captain steps back, muttering something about how Pepper must think he’s downright hilarious.
“I shall now go contact her using the Skype, for I think she would like to see what I have created as an act of devotion.”  Thor cradles his pumpkin rather carelessly under one arm, like he doesn’t understand how easily he could crush it, and wanders off toward the library to use the computer.
Tony shudders inside Steve as Steve brings Tony's hand up to his lips and licks his own release from Tony’s fingers.
To keep the undesirables from bothering me and all. Sorting through the riff-raff.” Tony waves his hand.
“Of course you would have your own theater.” Steve shakes his head. There was a time when Tony would’ve been sure such a statement would have been delivered with a mixture of awe and amusement, but now it’s shot through with contempt.
“Shit.”  The swear comes in two voices and Steve drops his hand, turning his head to find both Bucky and Natasha leaning out the window, evidently having taken Tony’s rushed exit as a cause for alarm.
“Well.” Bucky crosses his arms over his chest, and for a moment Steve thinks he’s actually angry at this lie of omission. “Guess you’re caught out, pal - you owe me a dollar.” Steve’s brow furrows, it taking him a moment to remember the wager from so long ago. Bucky shakes his head, scoffing at Steve’s incorrect prediction. “You said we’d never even meet the man, and here you are with an engraved personal invitation to his office.”
Even so, Steve suspects the slightest noise will still wake her in alarm, so he moves carefully when he folds himself into the seat beside Bucky.
Bucky winces slightly as the head slips through the last ring of muscle, leaving him empty and open. Tony unconsciously licks his lips at the sight of Steve’s come trickling down the backs of Bucky’s muscular thighs. He can’t stop himself from stepping toward the bed as Bucky relaxes down beside Steve, stretching out and resting his flesh-and-blood hand on Steve’s flat stomach.
Tony’s hands latch onto his collar, his brown eyes finding Steve’s and holding his gaze. They smile at one another faintly as the numbers trip off their lips.
“I know.”  Bucky shoves hard to push Steve flat against the bed and then, in a graceful yet frighteningly sudden movement, straddles Steve’s neck.  Tony can’t see what’s going on with Bucky’s body in the way, and despite the view of Bucky’s perfect ass, his first horrible thought is that Bucky’s strangling Steve with his thighs in some twisted erotic asphyxiation type of scenario.  He quickly realizes it’s nothing quite that kinky.
The overhead lights are garishly bright and despite overall attempts at elegance, he can still smell the tinge of bleach in the air. Despite that, Steve breathes easy for the first time in what feels like hours, standing at the bank of white porcelain sinks and staring at his reflection in the bank of beveled mirrors until his face comes back into focus.
He turns in Steve’s embrace, the sudden movement jarring Steve into momentary confusion. Tony tilts Steve’s chin up and pulls him into a deep kiss. Steve reacts by urging him back against the wall, pinning him there with his own impressive weight.
He throbs inside Steve, coming almost violently, and Steve’s body milks him for all he’s worth, clenching tight and hot around Tony’s cock as he pulses again and again. Steve’s moans echo his own, urging him on; with his own orgasm subsided, Steve must be clear-headed enough to register every move Tony makes inside of him and against him, his body over-sensitive but willing.
Is he James Buchanan Barnes?  Is that his name, his identity, his past?  If it’s true – he’d just saved Steve Rogers, why else would he do that? – then he needs to understand, needs to find out on his own how he came to be nothing but this shell, this empty nothing that only annihilates everything in his path.
Bucky’s never wanted to hit someone more. He holds back the slew of angry words threatening to spew forth, glaring at Tony before remembering to remind himself that this is about Steve, not him.
Bucky looks through him now as if he’s not even here.  It’s odd to feel both impossibly huge and invisible at the same time.
“Great, I love being Hulk bait.” Tony mutters, nonetheless taking off through one of the broken windows and heading upward.
“Où est-ce qu'il va?” Steve hears Dernier ask Gabe. Steve’s picked up enough French over the years to know what’s being said. The question is about him, but not directed at him, so he chooses not to answer it.
He takes Steve to all the great places he knows, but the restaurant he chooses, the club he picks, even the luxury hotel he checks them into, don’t seem to do the trick.  Steve’s smiling, Steve’s polite, but it’s not the right kind of smile, and they should be passed polite.  Tony plainly doesn’t know Steve well enough to give him a good time, but he does know him well enough to see through the act.
When Steve doesn’t reply, Tony’s attitude sobers quickly. Free of all the packages, he pauses to take stock of the room. Bucky pulls his hand away from Steve’s back, untangles his fingers from Steve’s hair. The fact that he hadn’t thought to do so until Tony is
Captain America marches onscreen, followed by his band of merry soldiers. Tony snorts at the sight of the men that make up his so-called unit. The very idea that so many different races and ethnicities would be integrated in one company is lofty but ludicrous. He wonders exactly who the OWI thought they’d be fooling with that one.
Steve supposes he should be happy; he’d wanted Bucky and Natasha to get back together, and maybe that’s what's happening. He shouldn’t complain. But even as he makes up excuses for Bucky’s behavior, he knows they’re just that—excuses.
be staying here, right?”  She’s not really asking.  Tony arches an eyebrow at her.  Surprisingly, she has the decency to look the smallest bit apologetic.  “Things are…things are a bit…” He doesn’t miss the way her gaze flicks guiltily toward Cap.  “
Steve feels a bit like a puppy lagging after his master as they are led through to the restaurant on the top floor. Frequently people look up from the dinner and drinks and nod hello to Tony; a few even get up and stop him to speak for a moment. Steve stands silently as Howard Hughes briefly pays his regards, mentioning something about his days tinkering alongside Tony’s father.
, just go undo whatever it is you did.” The question is implied, and Tony decides he should probably just confess the entire mess. It may feel better to acknowledge it aloud.
?”  Tony stares at him like he’s just asked after his vacation on Mars.  Steve doesn’t see why the question is ludicrous but Tony’s smile is bitter and disbelieving.  “You’re serious.”
Tony looks at him then with a strange expression on his face, and Steve thinks he maybe shouldn’t have asked.  In a paradoxical way, Tony’s the most private public person he’s ever met.   All the details in the press paint a picture of who Tony Stark is, but it’s
“I was just taking a break. I should probably be getting back.” Tall, blond and beautiful looks down to his wrist, then pats his pockets. He sighs with resignation, apparently realizing he’s left his watch somewhere else.
“Stark?” Steve doesn’t bother to mask his surprise or his distaste.  They’d been embedded deep in battles of their own when Tony’s fireworks with the Mandarin went off, but after the briefing he’d received upon his return to SHIELD headquarters, he’s surprised to hear Stark’s name coming up again so soon.  From what he’d gathered, the man blundered in headstrong and foolish against a mad man and almost got himself and his girlfriend – not to mention the President of the United States – killed in the process.
“I just remembered.  I have to be anywhere but here.” Clint bolts, knocking over his empties as he goes.  One of the bottles rolls until it hits the remnants of the coffee table.
He spends the whole of the next day clearing out one of the basement levels, putting Happy to work moving all the classic cars to a different storage area and sending SI interns on runs down to Canal to pick up all kinds of art supplies from Pearl.  One of the clerks at the store calls the financial office around midday to check and make sure that some NYU kids haven’t stolen his credit card to fund their school year’s worth of projects.
Tony repeats in his head, hating the sound of it.  Two separate things.  You.  And the Team.  “You’re clearly unhappy in New York anyway, it might be best to move on.”
This time Bucky doesn’t trust himself to crack wise. Part of him is thrilled by Tony’s admission, glad to know that Tony once hurt the same as he’s hurting now, but the other part, the better part, recognizes that feeling as childish and cruel.
“We stand around here jabbering any longer, we’re not going to have time for anything,” Bucky cuts in curtly, his voice sharp.  Steve laughs a little, the sound of it tinged nervous.  Tony doesn’t miss that Bucky’s tense attitude sets Steve ill at ease.
He knocks his knee against Steve’s, trying to lighten the mood, but Steve doesn’t smile. Tony sits up, abandoning the casual pretense, and cups Steve’s face to tilt it toward his.
“Thank you, Nigel. This is much appreciated.” Tony hands the man a bill as well, and Nigel simply bows and excuses himself, leaving Steve alone with Tony and a nearly dark, arched stone hallway that apparently leads back to the hotel.
Sometimes, they’re big pieces. The first time Bucky met Steve. He can practically smell the summer heat baking the trash in the alley as he heaves the small boy up from the ground. His delicate face is beaten bloody by the bullies Bucky had just scared away, and he’s actually shocked dumb by how beautifully blue the boy’s eyes still are as he glares up at him and declares he hadn’t needed the help.
“But potent as that shit was, it woulda worn off by now.  This does, however, lead to an important question I’ve been meaning to investigate – I know you can’t really get drunk.  Can Captain America get high?”
“It should be easy for me to do, I just gotta get a better set of tools, maybe a new tube if the old one’s leaking, pop off the-“
Bucky doesn’t know everything about him, after all, so it’s rather arrogant to assume he understands Bucky so completely.
Tony presses his finger inside Steve’s body – not a lot, just barely the tip – and Steve’s hips snap forward. Tony had expected it enough to be ready to take it, but Steve pulls back quickly with a rushed apology, drawing out of Tony’s mouth entirely.
“Relax, Rogers,” she says dryly, not looking up from her reading as she sets her coffee cup back down on its saucer. “We were out late and I missed the last train back home, I opted to stay here rather than pay for a cab." She turns the page. "And I can assure you, James was a perfect gentleman.”
Natasha stands just past the edge of the light that’s cast from the house, actually smiling gently over Clint’s antics.  She looks back over her shoulder as he and Tony walk out, her small smile steady.
Steve sets down his spoon and gives Bucky a warning look, but his friend isn’t paying him any attention. He and Jan are smirking at each other, apparently both very entertained by their exchange.
“I was really enjoying this,” Tony gestures between himself and Steve, upset that some strange villain and his army of robots have disrupted their idyllic morning.  “Do you suppose it’s too late for us to turn in our superhero cards and run away to some tropical paradise?  Pretty sure I own an island or two, somewhere.”
“So don’t fuck it up.” Pepper replies.  Like it’s that simple.  Pepper puts her hand on his arm, pulls him to look at her.  “You have to at least try, Tony.”
Positive reinforcement like Steve whispering his name and pushing in from behind, his slow upward thrust lifting Tony onto the tips of his toes.  He braces himself against the counter, hands flat against the smooth granite.  The cool surface warms quickly underneath his palms.
“JARVIS?”  Steve asks quietly.  He sets a hand on the grand piano at his side and just as quickly lifts it, afraid to touch anything.
“Um, I think Pepper left that out of the tour of contemporary art.” He’s grateful, because the whole thing sounds rather horrifying.  He shakes the can of spray paint he’s been using, noticing that the label reads
“You’re on.” Bucky sets his half-finished beer on the small table beside Steve’s drawing board, evidently meaning for Steve to drink the rest.  “I’m gonna go meet Nat, Clint and Sam down at The Shield for a nightcap, you wanna come?”
“Can we…I can’t do this in here.” Tony glances toward the bed. “Your friends are probably outside listening and I have things I need to say –” He lowers his voice to a near whisper and closes the space between them again. “ – and all I can think about is spreading you over that mattress and kissing my way up your body.”
Pepper’s phone rings, then, the factory-default tone of an unknown number, and Tony immediately gets a sinking feeling in his stomach. Pepper taps accept and tosses her long hair over her shoulder as she brings the phone up to her ear.
“I think she just wanted to hit me again.”  Barnes murmurs.  He sounds a little like Steve, that sometimes-accent of his curling faintly around the edges of Barnes’ words.  Tony doesn’t like it, doesn’t like hearing Steve in this stranger’s voice.
Pepper leaves him be after that, lingering for a few more moments before heading out into the New York City night.
“You’ve never been weak.”  Tony snaps his gaze up to Steve’s face.  Steve’s staring back at him, and Tony doesn’t find sadness or regret there.  Just acceptance.  “And he’s a fool.”
“So?” Tony fails to see the significance, but from the look on Natasha’s face, maybe he should.  “Don’t tell me I’m supposed to get him a gift.” He acts dismayed, clutching imaginary pearls at his neck and fanning his face.  “What does one get for an amnesiac assassin who has everything?  And by everything, of course, I mean absolutely nothing.”
There’s a physics textbook on the coffee table that piques his interest; it’s spread open and there’s writing along the margins, a cramped scrawl that he recognizes as Bruce’s.  There’s also a notebook next to it and the perfectly elegant old-fashioned handwriting on its pages is very much Steve’s.
“I’ll take that as a compliment on my svelte form and not a comment on how easy I am to miss.” She slyly kids, adjusting her mink stole around her shoulders.
“Sir, there appears to be no one at the residence except for the custodial staff on the public floors of the tower.”
“I know you might not right now,” Pepper’s voice softens. “But if I do dare to say, as one of your oldest friends, I think you will come to regret that later. I understand you are upset, but leaving for New York right now would undermine all that you’ve done to make this picture your calling card.”
Steve glares at him harshly enough that Tony nearly backs off.  But he’s nothing if not well versed in willfully ignoring other people’s anger, so he continues.
“I’m telling you right now, one day we’re all going to find out that these things are awful for us.” Jane holds her finger up in warning. Darcy attempts to counter yet again, but Jane brings it back to her main argument. “And it’s
Tony tries to stay focused on Steve and Steve alone as he comes untouched, balls drawing up tight and the base of his long, beautiful cock visibly pulsating as Steve pushes out thick ropes of come all over his chest and stomach.
He gives a little at a time, drawing back and then easing in further. Steve’s just on the right side of too tight, his body giving just enough with each of Tony’s nudges forward. Steve exhales slowly as Tony slips deeper, whimpering when Tony finally seats himself all the way inside, his balls nestled close against Steve’s ass.
Wanda groans and rests her forehead against his chest, her hands clawing at the sleeves of his suit coat.
“Do I need a reason to stop by, see a pal?”  His tone is as jovial and casual as Steve’s had been soft and serious.
“Good,” Natasha thumps him on the shoulder when she’s back on two feet.   “And you barely looked guilty at all that time.”
Steve looks over his shoulder at the pile of glass, the shards still too big for his purposes.  He’s going to need to break them down even further with a hammer.  He gives Tony what’s become his standard explanation for anything he does down here.
“Surely you have to be suspicious?  It’s not a coincidence that this alleged Sergeant Barnes shows up right after Captain America re-emerges,” Dr. Banner cuts in before Tony gets to.
She takes a deep breath and straightens her shoulders, smoothes her hair, plasters on a bright smile.
“Céline Dion.  He has a sense of humor,” Steve comments and Tony rolls his eyes, pulls Steve closer.
Tony reaches out to grab his elbow and nearly falls as Steve jerks away.  Tony opts for being steady over being warm and throws the blanket off his shoulders as they reach the patio.  The flannel falls to the steps as he follows Steve up onto the smooth, polished rocks.
“Currently Barnes is cooperating under the provision that he does not have any direct contact with you.”
“You know what I mean, Rogers.”  Tony actually sounds a little peeved.  Steve would never say it aloud, but he’s a little relieved that he’s not the only one who prefers it when it’s just the two of them, lazing on the couch side by side for hours while Tony guides him through seventy years of cinematic history.
“You know how these things go. Unexpected business, the call of duty, etcetera, etcetera, what have you.” Tony waves Jan off, tipping his head back over the arm of the couch and making vague gestures at the ceiling.
“My feelings for Tony aren’t going to change,” Steve says as firmly as he can, his voice slipping a little into Captain mode in a way it hasn’t for weeks. This is the one thing he absolutely needs to be crystal clear about, going in.
you see someone you know.  Standing on a street corner or sitting at the window of a café as you pass by.  You catch a glimpse of them out of the corner of your eye but then when you turn to look, it’s not at all who you thought…  It’s just a stranger.  That’s…everyday for me now.”
“I thought I did, but that Tony disappeared into thin air. Now there’s just whatever…” He gestures up and down Tony’s body like he’s some kind of weird pod person, “
He knocks on Steve’s door around seven o’clock, having missed dinner again but sure Steve’s probably still in the building.
have to pick what is likely to be the hottest day of the year to walk around outside for hours. Though…he hadn’t picked it – Pepper had, so he supposes that she’s to blame for the way he’s sweating through one of his most expensive suits.
of that was her fault; she was an innocent bystander.  But that doesn’t change the fact that she knows all the research, all the data, backward and forward.  She’s one of the few people outside SHIELD who has any fundamental understanding of how, theoretically, the super serum is supposed to work, and how gamma radiation functions.”
Pepper phones after that, though she doesn’t ask what he’s doing or why.  She just reminds him to return all the interns in one piece and to not go overboard on whatever he’s doing for Steve this time.  She knows him much too well.
“It would mean we’re all in a relationship with each other, rather than each of us being in a relationship with just you.”
Tony has no doubt at all that Barnes means it.  The rest of the room remains silent as Tony’s gaze sweeps over the other man’s face, the tic of his jaw tightening as he steps back, leans against the opposite side of the doorway.  He’s thinking now of what Steve told him about Bucky turning his back on him for the very first time.
When Steve gets angry, he stews and he broods. When he lets that anger loose, he puffs up, body raring for a fight and his tongue turning unexpectedly sharp. Someone once told Steve that his anger makes other people feel badly, shrinking under the weight of his disappointment.
to start calling me Pepper.  I’d hate to have to start yelling at you.”  She reaches up, taps him on the chin.  “I was in Denver to meet with someone about a contract; Tony called and told me you were nearby.  I thought I’d come see how my boys were doing on their cross-country adventure.  Hope you don’t mind.”
He hadn't even said good-bye. No promised phone call. No explanation. No kind parting words to soften the blow. Tony knew if he saw Steve's beautiful smile, heard Steve's rich, lovely voice, or let those strong arms wrap around him one more time, he wouldn't be able to do it. The only option was to cut Steve off. Cut him out.
In ’45 when Steve got back from the war, this place was already shifting from a local cop bar for the L.A. County Sheriffs to a hangout for less important players in the Hollywood game. It was near empty on weekdays, and on Friday and Saturday nights the clientele was strictly below the line. But with Tom Breneman’s turning monster business just a stone's throw away on Vine near Sunset, over the years the faces of this crowd have slowly shifted as people wandered further on down the road.
“Sure.  Fine.”  He mumbles, looking off down the street at nothing in particular.  “So what happens now?”
“Anyway, forget the Shins, we’ve gotta plan on the New Order show.  Right, Stevie?”  He ruffles a hand through Steve’s immaculately combed hair.
“Tony, you could make someone up for all I know, I don’t think it matters.”  He looks at Tony through their reflections in the mirror as he lathers his face.
“I could make that shot too, is all I’m saying.  I don’t see why Fury needed to bring Barnes in with some secret plan when he’s got a perfectly good-“
Bucky hangs up without another word and Steve watches his dark figure dart across the rooftop.  He palms Natasha’s cell phone and turns his attention back to the still-unconscious Bruce.
His skin stings as she slaps him; the woman’s hand hits his face repeatedly, short blasts of contact that are more like taps than blows.  Whoever she is, she huffs in frustration, and then he can’t see her anymore.  Pressure loosens around his wrists.  Then around his waist, then his feet.
“Spaghetti,” Steve replies. Bucky walks into the kitchen and comes up behind him, clapping a hand to his shoulder.
That Tony brought him here says a lot about how he feels, as whenever Tony’s uncertain or scared, he tends to shut people out, not shut people
“Not so much complicated as delicate,” Bruce replies, his attention still locked on his work. He’s wearing a pair of magnifying glasses and holding back a little lever, tightening something behind it with a very, very small screwdriver. He winces and glances up at Tony. “You’re…you’re sorta in my light, man.”
He breaks the surface fast, spitting water and gasping for air.  He rubs water from his eyes and pushes back his drenched hair from his forehead, struggling to see.
Bucky slowly looks from Tony to Steve, registering the tension that has exploded in the room, messy and sudden.  He and Bucky always could read each other’s faces like statements, holding silent conversations through lifting eyebrows and small quirks of their mouths, and Bucky’s trying to decipher him now.  He schools his face into the blankest expression he can muster.
“Merlot is wonderful,” Steve assures her, pulling out a chair at the kitchen table for her to sit. “I’m sorry this place isn’t much.” He says as she sits down, looking entirely out of place in the small, barebones kitchen.
Steve curls his hand around the back of Bucky’s neck and brings him back down for another kiss. He’s not going to last, not like this.
Steve squints into the bright sunlight, taking a cautious moment to survey the back lot before moving. The alleys between studio spaces can be as hazardous as a city street when production is in full swing, but today, at least in this corner of the Paramount stages, is low key. It seems their film is not the only one in the process of ramping up.
“What she means, Cap, is if you’re willing to kick a guy in the balls, you gotta be ready to kick a gal there too.  Even if Momma told you not to.”
“Comrades!”  Thor’s booming voice cuts through Steve’s thoughts on Natasha being a Blockhead.  A moment later Thor’s huge hand claps him on the shoulder, hard enough to make him wince.
“Thanks for the lesson in splitting hairs,” Bucky snorts, rolling his eyes. There’s blood welling up from the cut he made in the pad of his finger, a perfectly round drop growing slowly bigger even as he looks at it. He wipes it on the edge of his black t-shirt before it can break form and streak across his palm.
“They told me about your…” Steve taps his own temple.  “That you basically have a computer in your head now.”
“So if Bucky doesn’t want to see me now…he really doesn’t want to see me.  And I can’t say as I blame him.”
Tony sighs. The lukewarm reaction is not confidence-inspiring, but he isn’t sure if the film is to blame or if Steve is merely determined to be unhelpful.
“That would be lovely.”  Pepper shoots a departing look over her shoulder, one that tells Tony she knows exactly what he’s up to and that she’ll play along for now, but he’ll surely pay for it later.
“Hey.”  Tony catches his arm as Steve steps onto the platform, pulling him back slightly.  His brown eyes are wide and questioning.  “You okay?”
“It certainly ain’t happy.” Steve replies sardonically. “So I suppose it’s more realistic that way. Not a lot of actual happy endings out there to be had.”
Bucky chucks Steve gently on the shoulder with his fist and gets up, putting some space back between them.
That’s not the case with Tony at all.  Tony can catch him off guard because Tony’s quickly becoming his blind spot.  That’s not a thought Steve enjoys.
That was the only warning Steve received before Natasha was grabbing his leather coat from the hook and shoving him out his front door.
. Not that Tony didn’t already suspect it, but now he knows why Bucky seems to be doing this damn near all the time. It’s like a fuse blows inside his brain and he can’t think; he just
was different.” Bruce looks at him cautiously, like he doesn’t know how much is safe for him to say, and Tony tries to nod in a way that says he understands. “I have some anger issues. Some…episodes. It can be dangerous and I didn’t want to put her through that.”
“Behind you.” Clint gestures and Tony turns, finds Natasha standing there as if she’d been there all along.  Her red hair is wet, matted down, and there’s a gash in her leather suit, deep across her thigh.  If she’s in pain she doesn’t show it.
“You may, sir, but I do feel compelled to inform you that Master Stark has skeleton codes for the entire building.  He can override any code you create.”
Steve reluctantly pulls back long after the kiss, singular, has becomes kisses, plural, and they’re both out of breath and a bit dizzy.  His pulse is racing and he feels a vague sense of shock, maybe better put as stunned disbelief.
“Yes, yes it will.” Steve peels off his workman’s gloves and tucks them under the band of his tool belt. He scratches his eyebrow with his thumb as he studies the room, wondering if it’s not too late to put in a big picture window and cut down on the actual amount of available surface to paint. But then they’d have to project some outdoor scene for the illusion of a view, and that can be just as dicey.
“What?  Donuts are a great bereavement food.  There’s that big gaping hole in the middle.  It’s damn near poetic.  You don’t agree?”
As opening lines go, it’s not a great one. Belatedly it occurs to him that he’s insulted this utter perfection before him, but he’d gone with it and now it’s too late to take it back. So he commits.
“And here I thought your job was, you know, pointing this at stuff and making it look nice and pretty.”
“What do you want?”  Tony keeps his voice soft, needing it all but not wanting to assume.  Steve lifts his head from the pillow, looking down the length of his body as Tony continues to learn the lines and planes of his muscles.
“I drew,” Steve spits out, stopping Tony’s guesses from growing ever more ludicrous.  “I mean…I draw.  S’pose it’s merely a hobby now.  But before…it was my job.”
He’s distracted from his disappointment by Steve taking him by the hips and shifting their positions, rolling Tony underneath him. He kisses down Tony’s chest, tongue and lips tracing the jagged lines of his scars in that special way Steve has that Tony doesn't even mind. It feels reverent and loving, and it doesn’t make him self-conscious or ashamed.
“Bucky…he could’ve had an easy life.  Sure, he was an orphan, like me, but he was different, Tony.  He was something else.  He had the looks, the smarts, the charm – he coulda had anything he wanted and he gave it all up, time ‘n time again, to be best friends with an annoying runt like me.  I dunno why he did it." Steve shakes his head, smiling sadly.  His wet hair is dripping into his eyes again and he pushes it back, and then sets his hands firmly back on his knees.
Despite Pepper’s obvious frustration, there’s an easy camaraderie evident between Tony and his girlfriend and his driver that only serves to make Steve feel out of place.  He contributes nothing to the conversation and no one seems to notice his silence.
“You think she knows Fitzgerald died in that apartment?” Bucky startles him. Steve turns as his friend steps out of the doorway, letting the screen door bounce shut as he joins Steve in leaning on the railing. He’s already dressed for work, on his way out.
“What?  Gone after the assholes?  Yeah.  You must’ve knocked your head harder than we thought if you would even consider that we wouldn't,” he snaps.  “I just thank god Betts got some goddamned gumption in the end and got you the fuck away from Lukin, that’s all I have to say.  If he or any of his goons ever try this bullshit again…” Tony doesn’t finish his thought.  Steve already looks perturbed, eyeing Tony like he’s worried about what he’s going to do next.  Tony coughs, unclenching his fist and laying his palm flat against the table.  “Anyway.”
“In the morning, he always screams your name,” Bucky says a bit louder, letting Steve hear him now. “Big, huge loads of come everywhere and it’s
Tony nods; stepping clear as Thor swings his hammer and then takes off.  He watches until the god is indistinguishable from the dark sky.  Fury commands their attention.
He stands there just outside the doorway, as if already one step from leaving. His face is stoic, and his usually expressive eyes are shielded behind a dark pair of aviator sunglasses. The line of his body is ramrod straight, broad shoulders stiff and his hands in the pockets of his dark brown plaid trousers. The thin cashmere fabric of his light brown sweater clings to chest in such a sinful way that for a moment Tony thinks he must have dressed this way precisely to remind Tony of what he is missing.
“Crowded. Grand Army looks different, but the Plaza Hotel looks pretty much the same, even if it’s far more…” Steve pauses, “Uh,
“Sir, Captain Rogers left early this morning to attend a charity baseball game at the Long Meadow fields in Prospect Park, after which I believe he is scheduled to appear at a luncheon fundraiser for The Children’s Aid Society.  After these functions I believe the Captain’s schedule is clear, although Agent Hill has placed a request for his assistance with some matters pertaining to a new training program at SHIELD and Agents Barton, Romanoff and Barnes have demanded his presence at dinner.”
He thinks of sitting in his favorite coffee shop, warmth of a cup of coffee cradled between his hands fighting off the damp chill seeping into his bones. In his imagination, the bell above the door chimes, and, along with a gust of cold air and rain, Steve enters.
“It means that Natasha’s not wrong.  She’s never wrong.  Not about things like this.”  Tony steps down off the treadmill and pushes past Steve, his mood shifting from acerbic and annoyed to downright stormy.
“I tried calling you a few times.”  Steve’s words are surprisingly and tellingly soft, considering the company they’re in.  Tony barely glances at him, cursing himself for being so attuned to the man that even a fleeting look is enough to register the vulnerability plainly written all over Steve’s face.  He doesn’t miss the suspicious glare that Bucky shoots his way either.
Tony is standing a few paces from the restaurant.  His noise cancelling headphones are looped, unused, around his neck, but he’s still just as oblivious to the people loitering around him as he fiddles with his smart phone.  Steve ambles toward him, taking the moment to just appreciate his boyfriend.
.    He exits into the lobby first despite it being ungentlemanly, but he can’t stop himself from holding the door open for Natasha as they head outside.
?” He looks at Clint skeptically for some reason, which Steve has no doubt would be evident if he had the slightest idea who “Babs” was.  Or is.
dance with her guy, Tony.”  Steve comes to stand behind him, gently pushes him at the backs of his shoulders and gets him to stand up.  “Thank you for the invitation, Pepper, but I guarantee your feet will be all the much better for it if Tony does the honors.”
The door opens and Steve and Bucky draw the same breath, trying to get a hold of themselves before the doctor interrupts.  Bucky rises up as much as he can, given his restraints, and kisses Steve on the forehead, ruffling his hair.  He sits back down and smiles crookedly, wiping tears from his face.
“Not always about who packs the most punch when it comes to a fight,” Steve replies a bit sheepishly.  “Gotta be quick on your feet and outthink your opponent.  I’m sure I have as much to learn from you or Natasha as I would from Thor or Dr. Banner.”
As soon as the door is closed and locked, they disrobe each other quickly, clothes hitting the ground in haphazard, crumpled piles. Steve tries to guide him to the bed but Tony shakes his head no, pulling Steve down to the hardwood floor in the small space between Steve’s bed and the closet.
“You’re an actor, pretend that there is.” Tony retorts, gesturing for Steve to lead the way. Steve sighs, torn between two very distinct types of frustration. Tony’s so impossible, and then Tony is so
The next time he’s jolted from sleep, a howling pain is surging through every inch of his body.  His muscles are wrenched tight and it feels like his skin is on fire.  He lifts his head and there’s blood, blood everywhere.  His blood?  He thinks it is.  The coppery smell invades his nose, overpowering.  He can’t make sense of anything.  There’s someone else in the room.  Many someones.  Strong, rough hands are on his shoulders to force him back down.
In the pause, Tony tries to get ahold of himself and say something reasonable, like how they should clearly stop. His hands are on Steve’s ass, and he slowly draws his palms up and over the sharp cut of his hips, pressing Steve back a little to put space between them.
“I understand the rabbit hole reference?” Steve offers helpfully.  Tony laughs and drags him over to roulette, telling Steve to pick his number.
“Hate to argue, but it is a theme, and you’re missing some classic opportunities here.”  Clint holds up his fingers to start counting them off.  “Tom Hanks night-“
who he is at all, not really.  If he lets you get to know him even a little, that much becomes painfully obvious.
…” There is the sound of metal creaking; Steve’s right hand has left Tony’s hair and grabbed Bucky’s arm hard enough to dent it, steel molding like clay underneath the pressure of Steve’s fingers.  Bucky shakes his arm when Steve lets go, metal panels re-aligning with a mechanical whir.
happen, and frankly Greenpoint is toxic – literally – and who lives on the G, really?  Who does that?  But Long Island City, Astoria…I could handle that without becoming suicidal.”
Tony Stark sits in his new chair as director of SHIELD. One look tells him there’s near nothing left of the man that Steve loved.
“Coulson, you can put the rights to the character and his library up for sale. I don’t want this hanging around my neck.” Tony tugs at his tie, suddenly uncomfortable and feeling it too tightly at his throat.
Tony’s head snaps up from his phone, where he had just declined call #5 from Barnes. Pepper stares at him from across the cabin of the plane. Her eyes are narrowed in suspicion and, if he’s not mistaken, pre-loaded with judgment.
He reaches out, fumbling for the feeling of Bucky beside him. Expecting to find a shoulder, an arm, instead he finds the other man’s thigh.
Regardless, it’s not good sense to dwell on it now. There’s no going back, no do-overs. That much has been made overwhelmingly clear to him, if nothing else.
He has to admit he feels a little dumb for not realizing this sooner, he could’ve found Steve days ago if he’d been thinking along the right lines.  Instead, he’d been hoping to trace Steve’s cell signal or that his SHIELD-issued credit card would ping.  He’s lucky that Steve crossed a toll bridge with a cam and the facial recognition program Tony had piggybacked onto the government database picked it up.  Thank god Big Brother’s good for something.
Now that he’s able to focus more clearly, Steve stops and takes in the rest of Tony for the first time that morning. He’s already combed his dark hair, though it’s still slightly damp and he hasn’t used any pomade to style it into place. Soft strands are curling loose over his forehead. He smells fresh and clean, like luxury soap and expensive cologne, and suddenly Steve feels entirely self-conscious.
It’s stupid and it’s dangerous and he’s probably going to screw it all up. They both have to be insane to think it will ever work.
“So don’t you knock my mama’s cooking.” Sam says triumphantly, seeing from the look on Steve’s face that Steve knows he’s right.
“How many times did he come inside you?” Tony asks it so straightforwardly, like asking about the weather. He sits back for a moment, undoes his belt and unzips his own trousers. He lets out a small sigh of relief as some of the pressure on his groin is released.
Tony bunches his fingers in the bottom of Steve’s shirt, tugging.  Steve breaks just long enough to pull the tank over his head, reaching immediately to get Tony’s clothes off.  His hands move quickly but ineffectually, shoving Tony’s suit coat off his shoulders and then pulling his tie loose, then starting to unbutton his shirt without finishing either earlier task.  Tony helps him follow it all through, scrambling to get undressed even as Steve’s mouth drives him to distraction.
“Except it kind of is, Steve, but you’re programmed never to admit it.” Tony states. “But you know I’ve never had any compunctions about saying improper, scandalous things, so I’ll tell you what we’re going to do here.”
Their friends fall back into pleasant chatter as Tony forgets his breakfast, content to lose himself in Steve’s maple syrup-tinged kiss.
One of her legs is folded in close, foot up on the seat of her chair. Her leg is startlingly bare, skin ivory pale and silky smooth. The artist in him feels a pull at its beauty, but it’s not anything more than that. Steve attempts to train his gaze respectfully on her face, but the slinky way she moves makes that difficult.
“Even the old lady across the hall.  She’s actually only sixty or so, give or take, but she’s had a hard knock life, man.  You should hear the stories.”
Now, however, Tony picks up the remote from the coffee table and switches the program off.  Steve stirs, the cessation of background noise enough to disturb his light slumber.  A ridiculous feeling of warmth spreads throughout Tony’s chest as he looks down at Steve, stretched out on the couch with a tattered copy of some Jonathan Lethem book open and resting on his stomach.  Fiorello is curled up on Steve’s legs, a purring ball of gray fur perfectly content to use Steve as his pillow.  The cat has the right idea.
“To be honest, I'm slightly terrified that you’ve managed this for so long without FRIDAY noticing.” Natasha focuses on the screen, head tilting as if she’s curious. She makes a small, impressed noise as Tony presses Steve’s legs near over his head. “I almost can’t blame you for this, James.”
As he and Fury move into the hallway, Agent 13 passes by with Agents Hill and May, evidently on their way back from a session at the gym.  She murmurs hello and offers him a pleasant smile, but Steve is too preoccupied to engage her in anything more than a brief greeting.  Fury waits until she has rounded the corner before turning his attention back to Steve.
“It’s to sic the Star Spangled Man with a Plan on some international crisis.  No, I have no damsels in distress in need of saving, I simply wanted to check in.”
It should have been obvious that taking Thor to see Shakespeare in the Park at the Delacorte would end in some kind of disaster.  That the performance was
“Tony,” Steve admonishes, nevertheless sliding a hand down the front of Tony’s boxer briefs, steadily rubbing over his thickening cock.  Tony hums in pleasure, still in thrall to how easy this has been.  He should never have fought it this long.
“Cross her off the list.” Tony doesn’t look back at his casting director, knowing full well that she will hear his every word.
“He did? He didn’t…he didn’t happen to leave a message for me, did he?” Steve shouldn’t ask, but he wants to make sure. Chase shakes his head.
“I honestly thought it more likely that you had gotten in an accident or a fight or, god knows, been rushed to the hospital with some illness like you used to before, than that you’d been partying all night with some rich playboy.”
“Thor, you like everything,” Clint disregards him entirely.  “Bruce, I’m going to St. Mark’s tomorrow, gonna do some digging for vinyl-“
“Oh, is that what he drove?” Tony asks with a practiced nonchalance. “I was wondering which one he’d choose to take out today.”
He’d often seen it as a switch clicking from off to on, a change of heart due to the mind-blowingly amazing sex, but it really wasn’t.  Nothing had changed except his willingness to admit the truth.
“There’s a ‘we’ in ten years?”  Steve catches, trying not to sound hopeful but not entirely succeeding.  As overtly affectionate and demonstrative as Tony can be, he usually shies away from any concrete talk of commitment.  Especially since marriage became an actual, legal option for them.  He knows Tony loves him, but he also knows Tony’s a restless kind of person.  He’s definitely into the physical, and he’s into big romantic gestures and the overall idea of having someone, but the day-to-day details tend to bore him.
“Captain Rogers has been cleared to use the facilities for over two weeks, sir; I was not aware that his presence need be announced.”
“It is the sister food of the Pop Tart and it is most glorious,” Thor announces, and then squeezes five packets of frosting onto the single pastry on his plate.
did?” Tony assumes that’s what’s sitting, most likely untouched, inside the white Apple store bag on the viciously ugly pale yellow linoleum counter.  He eyes it suspiciously and lowers his voice, using his hand to shield his mouth from direct sight of the bag.  He’s not even sure if he’s kidding around in doing so.  “She is probably listening to us right now.  Just so you know.”
“I did tell Miss Carter that I was perfectly fine to get there on my own, but apparently Mr. Stark insisted…” Steve easily could have walked the short distance from their apartment to the hotel, though he’s slightly glad he wouldn’t be showing up to the meeting in a sweat-stained suit. He’s already positive that he’s going to look underdressed and out of style when sitting beside Tony Stark. “I’ll make sure to tell him that I was impressed, though. You sure don’t see a car like this everyday.” Steve runs a hand along the chrome detailing on the inside of the bright red door.
,” Jane suddenly admonishes, capturing everyone’s attention.  Thor is serving himself up a monstrous plate of lasagna, the piece covering the entire plate edge to edge.  Half the pan is left empty.  He already has a forkful in his mouth, making happy noises as he chews and swallows.
“This is not a game for me, Bucky, I assure you.” Tony tries to sound as sincere as he can, which can be hard when people automatically tend to read sarcasm or facetiousness into everything he says. Being a glib and snarky asshole most of his life has its cost.
“Burn those.”  He hands it to Cynthia.  Sliding his sunglasses back on, fixing the collar of his lovely new black button down, he then gives Steve another once over.  “Now that we’re fit for public consumption…time to paint the town red and gold, buddy boy.”
“Get it, girl,” Tony sassily calls after them.  Steve doesn’t have to look to know that when she extends her hand behind him, the gesture she flicks in Tony’s direction is less than friendly.
It would have been risky to do too often, but surely Steve spending the night every now and again could have escaped notice or been made excuses for. They could have had some semblance of a life together, even if it wasn’t everything they really wanted it to be.
“I’m touched you think I’m some kind of hot shot, Thor,” Bucky smirks as he clinks fresh ice cubes into his glass. He gestures to Steve with the tongs before dropping them back into the ice bucket. “Steve, however, he did some work with Howard Stark, once upon a time. Darcy, you may be too young to remember –”
“You make it sound like I’m ashamed of the Captain, Nat. I’m not, not really. I just…I don’t want to go back.” Steve rests his weight against the wooden railing of the patio and looks out over the yard. It’s dark out now and getting darker, but in every direction Steve can see the warm, glowing lights in the windows of neighbors’ homes.
With one swift downward motion he tugs Steve’s tie free of his collar, the sound of fabric whipping against fabric making a pleasant swish in the quiet of the living room. Steve reaches up, perhaps thinking to undress him as well, but Tony takes a step back and ducks under Steve’s arms.  Steve drops his hands from the door and turns around, going stock-still but for his eyes tracking Tony’s languorous motion as he saunters backward down the long hallway toward the bedroom.
Of course, this doesn’t really feel like home. It smells all wrong and it sounds all wrong, but there’s enough here in the familiar architecture to be vaguely comforting.
, it’s like seeing someone you used to know, then going over to say hey and having them ignore you like a complete asshole.”
“I’m here.”  Bucky shifts his seat closer and tightens his grip on Steve’s hand to the point where it almost hurts.  He bends his head, presses his lips to Steve’s cracked knuckles, and then presses his other hand over their combined grasp.  “I’m so sorry, Steve.  I can’t even tell you, I don’t know how…”
“What was that about mindless sycophants?  How did they get such a bad rap?” Tony decides against lighting the cigar now; he takes out his sunglasses and stows the cigar in its place. He’ll need it and a good glass of scotch in order to wind down after the development meeting; his budget man, Coulson, is intent on shooting down all of his grand plans purely on the basis of monetary concerns.
“So…happy birthday.”  Barnes inches closer.  He extends his hand and Steve shakes it, and Tony feels like he’s witnessing the most awkward exchange of all time.  He’s not even sure what exactly is making it so terrible because there are just too many reasons to choose from.  Barnes’ look darts toward Tony again, and there’s jealousy there, suspicion, maybe disappointment.  “Didn’t realize I’d be interrupting your date.  I’m sorry.”
Tony sighs, not wanting to get into it, but Pepper is looking at him expectantly and he knows she won’t let this go.
This is how he knows that sending him after Steven Grant Rogers is a decision that has cost Pierce some favor amongst the upper echelons of HYDRA.
“Stark.”  Steve snaps at him warningly, his face warming in embarrassment.  The man’s being crass for the sake of being crass.  That has a time and a place and it’s not here.
"I'm sure some place in the city has gotta be showing old Rogers/Astaire flicks sometime, we should keep an eye out.  We could make a night of it."
For a minute all Tony can hear is the sound of the waves rolling to shore and the steady rhythm of Steve’s breathing. He should leave the silence be, but there’s so much he wants to say. If only he had the right words. It’s so unlike him not to have the right words.
Steve thinks he’s gotten away without comment, Bucky walking down two stairs toward the street, when Bucky pauses and looks up at him.
“I wish I had too.” Tony replies, caught off guard by the surprising ache that fills his chest.  Barnes sounds as destroyed as he feels.  “But have you ever tried keeping that guy away from a fight?”
“Is my seeing you dependent on my taking this part?” Steve asks, doubt growing even more insistent. He pulls back a little, and Tony stares up at him like he’s considering.
“Bruce told me he invited you.  You’re not crashing.”  It’s not exactly the best icebreaker, but there’s nothing else to say.
On the other hand, this thing with Steve and Bucky has been going on for decades, and now Bucky has finally said it out loud, brought the subtext to the surface where it can no longer be ignored. He frankly isn't sure what to do with that. But not doing anything isn't going to work.
and…” Bucky wraps his arms tightly around himself. His whole body is starting to hurt, all over, his limbs aching and his stomach twisting, and he realizes tears are threatening to spill. He doesn’t want Tony to see this. He may love Steve and because of that he deserves some answers, but he doesn’t have the right to Bucky’s pain.
He can see pieces of their past dwelling in the shadows between the shiny, modern, new buildings if he looks hard enough.  When he tries to hold on, it all slips through his fingers, but he knows it’s all there, somewhere.  Hiding.  Waiting.
“Well, uh…” Steve drops his hands to the collar of Tony’s button-down shirt, Tony having gotten into bed without even bothering to undress or change. The fabric is silky soft between his fingers. “He called me up after you and he talked, and he filled me in on your letter.” Steve coughs, throwing Tony a look that says
He reaches back blindly and his fingers brush Steve’s. The touch is light, almost enough to be passed off as accidental.
“Buck.” Steve calls out softly, and his door is immediately thrown all the way open. Bucky is livid, his cheeks ashen and his pupils so constricted that his eyes seem only a pale, icy blue.
Steve smiles softly, this look in his eyes like maybe he actually hadn’t known that, like maybe he thought there had really been a time when Tony hadn’t adored every inch of his being.
“I highly approve of this.”  Tony runs a finger over one of the lines, imagining how it will look all lit up against the darkness.  Steve likes the pleased expression on Tony’s face, not a hint of insincerity there.
Tony feels it again now as he stands in the darkness of his empty bedroom. He puts his hand over his heart; he can feel it racing out of time as something like panic trips through his veins.
“To Steve?”  Bruce shakes his head, then shrugs and nods a little.  “I was in the middle of something and I got the sense he didn’t want to interrupt.  We exchanged pleasantries, that was about it.”
“I should go...Bucky – my roommate – he’s probably worried about me. I don’t usually stay out all night.” Steve finishes buttoning up his shirt and glances at Tony. Tony shrugs, and his nonchalance causes Steve to hesitate. It’s not like he wanted Tony to beg him to stay, but maybe he’d hoped the man would at least want him to.
He must fall asleep because the next thing he knows, he’s being gently shaken awake.  Clint’s hand is on his shoulder and his smile is genuine as he holds out a mug full of fresh coffee.
“You’re serious.”  Steve turns around, looking again at all the surrounding buildings, at the curving wall of the sports center.  “This…Penn Station used to be here.  Right here.”
.”  Clint suddenly vaults over the back of the couch, landing on the empty couch cushion between him and Tony.  Steve barely manages not to yelp in surprise.
But he knows if he looks into Steve’s beautiful blue eyes, he’ll lose his courage and he won’t be able to do this.
Tony fixes himself up as best he can, tucking his still sensitive cock back into his pants and zipping up, then smoothing down his clothes, straightening his tie. He runs a hand through his hair and then stands up, surprised to find his legs are still shaky underneath him.
“Steve doesn't know Loki either, far as I know, not that that's much. Pretty sure he knows his brother, though. Pretty good special effects guy—different last name—but he’s got some Norse first name too, I think. Thor?”
gonna help me save Captain America, god only knows, but it’ll sure help if I ever decide to take remedial geography at BMCC!”
The thought of a computer having to handle the shower for him is too ridiculous.  He doesn’t know how this became his life.  He still remembers growing up when functioning indoor plumbing with hot water was a downright coup.
“Hey, I gave you your own floor, Barnes, you can eat there,” Tony retorts, grimacing as Steve pulls out and bends to pick up his towel.  He resituates Tony’s underwear on his hips, covering him up.  He’s blushing bright, bright red as he grabs the dishtowel from by the sink and throws it over the come-streaked countertop.  “And have you ever heard of knocking?”
Tony doesn’t mean to watch.  What he meant to do was come down here, hustle and bustle his way through a meet and greet with the Cap and then be on his way.  He has things to do, surely – Pepper always insists he does – and Rogers wouldn’t be expecting an
“Might have gotten a little excited during my shower too,” Tony admits, rolling his hips backward to urge Steve on. He guides one of Steve’s hands to his groin. “Considering that was less than an hour ago, take
“Do you want to go home?  I’m sure seeing Pepper would go a long way to making you feel better right now.”
He clings to Bucky and Bucky clings to him.  Everything begins to fall away, some of that unbearable weight lifting from his shoulders.  He hadn’t quite realized how much he’d been carrying until he finally acknowledges the burden, slowly starts putting it down.
“Seems like it,” Tony replies tightly, grimacing. He lifts his head to look up at Steve, his expression unchanging. “Having a party, are we?”
“Hey-“ Steve starts, surprised at finding his hand now empty, Tony having lifted his glass.  Tony grins, eyeing him as he downs the rest of Steve’s drink.   He puts it back in Steve’s palm as soon as he polishes it off, and then turns back to Pepper.
as it can get.   Steve nods, though he’s not entirely sure if that’s what he wants or if that’s just the first thing that came to mind that would throw Tony for a loop.  Tony tugs Steve’s suit coat to sit straight on his shoulders and then steps away.  “Your first time in Sin City and you really want to go out and get…grilled cheese.”
“I stopped by his workshop after wrap today, and I only meant to stay a minute, really. But he had all these fantastic camera designs to show me, and we got caught up in the theoreticals, and then we started building something…” Tony runs his fingers through his hair, feeling anxious. “I didn’t realize the time until it was far too late.”
Steve follows him quietly into the diner and Tony watches as he returns the tools to the man at the register.  Leave it to Steve to break down in genuine Small Town America where a stranger can just walk in and borrow anyone’s tools because he’s just that honest and they’re just that trusting.
the evil.  In the last frame, Clint is pressing a sloppy kiss to the side of Natasha’s face; she’s rolling her eyes but smiling at the same time.  Bucky has fallen half out of the shot but Tony can see Steve, caught mid-laugh and gorgeously happy.
“Not quite up for that yet.”  Bucky takes a long pull from his bottle.  “She does have nice gams though.”  Bucky winks at Steve and he can’t help blushing.  It’s an old habit – Bucky making lewd comments about ladies embarrasses him, and Bucky knows it.  He smiles apologetically at Jane but she doesn’t seem at all bothered by Bucky’s comment.
He wants to twine his life together with Steve’s, to feel his heartbeat and his breath as surely as if they were his own.
“I appreciate your position.”   He does.  In all honesty, if he were faced with a similar situation, he probably would’ve dealt with it in the same way.  It doesn’t change the fact that Natasha knew all along that Bucky might be alive and who he had become, and she’d kept it to herself.  “I’m not…”
“A whole…fifteen…minutes…” Tony looks down at his expensive wristwatch, tapping its glass face with one finger, considering. “Whatever shall I do…”
“I don’t know how to dance, Tony.”  Steve looks at his hands as he speaks, too many memories rushing forward.  The doors ding open but Tony remains where he is.  Steve forces himself to lift his gaze.  “Peggy said she was going to teach me.”
Seeing Tony with Pepper has left Peggy on his mind.  Not for the first time, he doubts his decision to let Peggy be, to let her live out her final days in Winchester without him abruptly walking back into her life, seventy years too late.   Doing that would have been horribly selfish.  Not seeing her is the right choice, but he can’t lie – it’s also safer.  What if he had gone to see her and she’d refused, the way Bucky’s refused now?  He doesn’t know if he could’ve taken it.
“I mean, I’m okay with the ride but I don’t understand why…all this had to be right now.”  He gestures around them, trying to encompass all of Tony’s strange behavior of the past few minutes with one motion.  Tony relaxes a little then, leading Steve to wonder what Tony thought he’d meant.
“I don’t rate some of that patented Steve Rogers stubborn determination?” Bucky nudges him with his elbow, joking but not.
"You never said you lived across the street from Jan." Steve's put off by the non-sequitur. "Janet Van Dyne?" Tony gestures over his shoulder in the general direction of the apartments across the street. "Saw her leaving when I arrived."
“Course I do.  We all had to sleep two or three to a bed in the other dormitory until it was fixed.”
“Don’t seem so shocked,” Tony sarcastically snipes. He turns from the plane, getting a few paces away before turning back and pointing at Rhodey accusatorily. “It could have been something
“I’m drawing.” Steve replies simply, not missing a beat and not looking up.  If Tony’s tone bothers him, he doesn’t show it. “I do that, you know.”
She doesn’t say anything more.  For the first time in days, Tony sees something beyond Steve’s abduction and realizes that that moment he feared, the moment where he would break Pepper’s heart, might have already happened and he hadn’t been paying attention.
“Hey.  I love that movie.”  Natasha pipes up, brandishing the tiny, flimsy carving blade at Tony.  She manages to make it seem incredibly threatening.
“Oh.”  Tony bringing up Howard, bringing up the past, stops Steve short.  “I…yeah, I suppose I was.”
“Steve.”  Bucky breathes his name like a prayer; Steve can hear the relief and gratitude there and he’s grateful for it himself.  He’s not all that sure what happened, but he’s glad to be back and even more glad that Bucky’s here, solid and real and
He doesn’t know who has been following Tony for days, whose finger has twitched on the trigger of his handgun or around the handle of his knife, ready to kill him just because Tony’s smiling at Steve over a cup of afternoon coffee at their favorite café or because Tony’s hand is on the small of Steve’s back as they sweep their way down a red carpet at a charity ball.
“Because I said so.” Steve turns on his heel and walks in the opposite direction from Tony, around the corner of the house toward the back patio.
“I hate this,” Steve murmurs brokenly, and Tony wraps an arm around his shoulders, pulls him close, and presses a kiss to his temple.
sitting near a pretty resistant strain of Ebola.” Bruce nods to a culture dish a few inches from Tony’s hand.  Tony instinctively moves in the other direction but then stops, knowing better.
“We don’t have to.” Steve retorts, but Bucky shakes his head again, more decidedly, and sits up straight. Steve hesitates a moment, then sits up too, his brow furrowing in concern. “Buck?”
One of the production assistants comes around the corner, carrying a stack of scripts and balancing three coffees, and looking harried.
Tony can’t bring himself to say so.   Steve’s usually so polite and conscientious that he thinks maybe he won’t have to, but Steve stays put where he is.
“I can’t separate it out like that,” Steve refuses the question entirely, stepping away and out of Tony’s reach.  “And I can’t do anything about it.  It makes sense – their relationship is more recent.  She knew him as the Winter Soldier.  It has to be far less…traumatic to recall her than me.”  Steve looks at the floor, hopelessly forlorn.  “It’s easier.”
Sam’s said that to him many times, now, and Steve knows it’s true. But he’s seen Bucky wince and seize with cramps from a phantom limb, seen him punch and break things in frustration, and scream out in anger. He’s seen Bucky when his eyes grow hollow and empty and he’s seen him when he collapses underneath the weight of it all and just needs Steve to pick him up and carry him through until he can stand it again. He’s held Bucky when he cried and stood there and taken it when Bucky needed someone to spew vitriol at just so it would have somewhere to go besides inward.
It got too hard to watch Barnes there so he’d buried himself in work all day – work which would bring Bucky fully and completely home to Steve, which is an irony that’s like a knife to the gut – and he snuck back in at night when no one else was there.  He had the appropriate clearance; it was only a matter of making nice with the on duty nurse so she wouldn’t report his unorthodox visiting times.  After the second or third night spent at Steve’s bedside, sleeping twisted forward with his head against Steve’s stomach, the nurse hadn’t bothered him much.
When Steve picks up the menu, Tony promptly takes it from his hands and sets it aside.  Even though he’s feeling hungry for the first time all day, Tony orders them nothing but drinks – two for him to every one for Tony – and demands that he down them as soon as they arrive at the table.
He latches the door and clicks the feeble lock. He’s one step inside when Tony grabs him by the waist and pushes him down onto the squeaky couch, springs protesting the sudden weight. Tony is straddling his lap before Steve even realizes what’s happening.
There is silence in the screening room, as if no one is really sure he means what he says. He waves a hand onward.
"Are you saying I look old otherwise?" Tony asks and Steve rolls his eyes, giving Tony a small shove as they continue their meandering walk through and around the square.
"She doesn't actually live there." Steve mumbles, wondering why Tony's shown up unannounced and is talking about the neighborhood, of all things.
He shivers.  He’s wearing a pair of loose dark grey cotton pajama pants and the navy blue official Team USA Olympics tank Tony gleefully gave him with more amusement than is probably normal, and maybe he should’ve grabbed one of Tony’s much lauded bathrobes because he’s suddenly chilled.
“You said I would be able to see him?”  Steve prompts Fury, who nods once and pulls a remote out of the inside pocket of his black coat.  He presses a button and a video feed starts streaming over the center of the table, the rundown of Bucky’s information and vital stats running along the right side of the camera link to his cell.
“Fuck,” Tony breathes, wishing again that he could drag this out, tease Steve until he's begging for it. Instead, he slides inside Steve in one long, protracted push, not stopping until he bottoms out, snug against Steve’s body. “Fuck, you feel good,” he can’t hold back, but luckily he remembers to whisper.
“We’re going there.” Off Tony’s displeased look, Pepper gives him one of her own.  “Face facts, Tony, you don’t have a name here. If you were making weapons and we were in Washington, then yeah, everyone would come to you. But you’re nothing more than a dollar sign out here, especially if you’re not willing to trade on your family’s history with the
Once in his bedroom, he shuts the heavy door behind him and leans against the solid wood, catching the breath he wasn't aware he'd lost. Though he doesn't want to think on it, his last night in L.A. comes rushing back.
Instead of waiting for Steve to reply, Tony allows his desire to win out.  He dips down and takes Steve’s mouth, eager and insistent.  Steve gives himself over to it with no protest.  He lets Tony’s tongue slide along his, a small whimper escaping that tells Tony that Steve’s more than willing.
Tony folds his hands on Steve’s chest and rests his chin on them, gazing at Steve’s face with blatant admiration.
After he starts the projector and switches off the lights, he carefully allows two seats of space between himself and Steve, contenting himself with the fact that they’ll at least be in the same room together for the next 120 minutes.
“Natasha was wrong about you.  When she concluded that Iron Man would be a valuable addition to the team, but Tony Stark wouldn’t?  She was wrong.”
“Be there with bells on, Banner.” Tony winks and clicks his tongue, throwing a two-gun salute as he ambles toward the exit.  “Try to get some sleep.”
“It’s nice to finally meet you, Steve Rogers,” she replies.  Her handshake is surprisingly firm, reminding him she’s a businesswoman and probably accustomed to glad-handing as a matter of course.  Peggy shook hands like that.
“All those nights when he would hold you like this, Steve, like we are now…you really never thought it was more than that?” Steve doesn’t reply, which in itself says a lot. “Steve.”
“Yeah but I gotta rest these babies sometime!” Sam wiggles his fingers with a grin. Then he picks up his drink. “Bucky, though. Have you tried pressing Natasha for details?”
It’s also not every night that he gets off on that kind of conversation either. It’s not like he’s never had a threesome or shared partners or dabbled in polyamory before, but he’s never loved anyone the way he loves Steve. He didn’t think he was going to be
, if we slept in the same bed.”  Even though he’s not sure about sharing a bedroom with Steve just yet, Tony always finds himself asking anyway.  Whenever the thought of falling asleep and waking up next to Steve crosses his mind, it always seems like a
His cigarette is half-burned through, and when he stands up straight, Bucky’s face pinches sharply in discomfort as if he’s been lazing on the porch for quite awhile and his muscles have grown stiff. His pupils constrict as he moves out of the darkness to where the moonlight and streetlight can find him, making his eyes look so much sharper and colder.
“It even happens to me sometimes, Ms. Potts, he wears on us all.”  Steve glances at Tony again, knowing the fond smile that claims his face when he locks eyes on the man must give him away.  “And I wouldn’t change him for the world.”
For the next five hours, Steve is audience to Natasha and Clint swapping stories and trading shots.  It’s easy, and it’s clear they’re meaning to entertain, not pressing him to talk.   The tales they tell are simpler versions of tangled messes.  Highlight reels of the good stuff they care to remember while leaving the rest of it carefully untouched in the dark.  He can recognize a whitewash when he sees one.  He’s done it often enough himself.
He remembers the cold nights in their tiny place in Vinegar Hill, when the radiator would clatter and sputter as it strained to spit out even the barest traces of heat, and he and Steve would huddle together in bed under layers and layers of blankets. Bucky would always give Steve the hot water bottle, and his best, thickest pair of wool socks that didn’t have any holes in them, and hold Steve close in his embrace. Those were the nights he could almost believe that Steve secretly loved him back and they both were too scared and too smart to say it aloud.
“I have returned, darling!” She announces, flourishing two bottles of red wine. She’s also changed her outfit, her red dress exchanged for an airy, summery sundress in pastel blue. “I hope you like merlot because it is all I had. I had to leave the good stuff with Hank.”
Steve is ignored by nearly everyone who looks Tony’s way, and he would feel out of place if not for the way in which Tony seems to subtly touch him at all times, checking in and making eye contact even when ostensibly conversing with someone else.
“Sort of. Sometimes.” She shrugs. “Technically, I do have a husband. I’m sure you’ve seen the gossip rags.”
“Until she figured a way to get you out.”  Bucky raises his voice a little sharply.  “Which she did.  And I think maybe you should rest for a while now, Steve.  Stark, why don’t you go see what’s holding up the doctor.  Just get Banner or Ross over here if SHIELD isn’t going to get their people’s asses moving.”
It’s past eleven by the time Steve carries them both out onto the sidewalk, Natasha leaning on his left, Clint on his right.  He considers packing them both into a cab and sending them home on their own, but it doesn’t feel right to leave them unguarded with their defenses weakened.  There’s a guy leaning in a doorway half a block down, and while it’s probably nothing, he can’t shake the feeling that they’re being watched.  He glances over his shoulder one last time and slides in beside Clint.
“Steve will never forgive you if you hurt Barnes in order to bring him back.” Bruce shouts over the roar of the engines and the wind as they step out onto the helicarrier deck.  Tony activates his wristlets, calling his armor to him, and waits until it’s all locked into place before he responds.
He grins to himself as he spots Tony’s fixed gear bike locked haphazardly to a lamp post, despite the fact that there’s a fully functional bike rack not twenty feet away in front of the restaurant.  One day Tony’s not going to slide by with a mere ticket and he’s going to come back to find his lock cut and his bike impounded.
“Ok, wow, it’s later than I thought. Let’s forget the break and just call it a day. We can start with the men tomorrow – hopefully they’re a better lot than this sorry bunch.”
“Sorry about that, Sleeping Beauty,” someone says as the bedroom door opens. Steve snaps his head up toward the sound, panicked. “I ordered breakfast, but the floor just ate half of it. You’d think I’d be less clumsy – and you’d be right – but apparently this morning my motor functions are impaired. I think maybe you fucked the dexterity right out of me – Steve?”
in general – for so long that he’d forgotten what it’s like to be caught in a rising tide of moving bodies, pinned in at all sides.  It’s claustrophobic, and it’s noisy, and all he wants to do is shove people away from him and bolt for the nearest exit.
There is a chorus of agreement and Natasha nods, and is about to say something when a look of annoyance tightens over her face.  She swears in Russian.
“Okay, so…good.  If you’re cool, I can arrange for my guys to pick up the stuff from your place in Brooklyn.”
Steve laughs at that, an unhinged kind of guffaw that doesn’t sound at all right coming from him.  He rubs his palms over his knees, agitated.
Fury stares at her, his mouth settling into a firm line.  Hill squares her shoulders, unapologetic and even a bit accusatory.
He stays quiet, watching as Steve brings a trembling hand to his face, fingers rubbing at his temples.
Steve’s grin has a metric ton of all the best intentions without an ounce of actual happiness to back it up.
“You know I always will, right?” Tony asks, coming closer. He’s bundled up against the wintry breeze, dark pea coat and bright red scarf. He shoves his bare hands in his pockets. He looks warm. Bucky isn’t even wearing a jacket, only a black hoodie. “If he stays like this, without the serum…nothing changes. Not the way I feel about him, anyway.”
Tony leans back on his heels, tuning Thomas out and tilting his head to look at the high sheet metal ceiling, buttressed by wood rafters. Pretty solid construction. Humming lightly to himself, he lets his gaze wander aimlessly around the rest of the warehouse.
Tony’s house in Aspen is too huge to rightly be called a house.  It’s a version of the tower horizontally adjusted for a mountain setting.  As Tony and Pepper set about their business, catching up on phone calls and paperwork and getting all settled, Steve stands in the great room alone.
But even with an empty seat between them now, the long ride passes by as if a mere moment.  Steve doesn’t want the night to end, and Tony gamely suggests that it doesn’t have to.  Steve doesn’t ask where they’re going, trusting Tony to decide.
The way the man moves is somehow familiar – an impossible grace and control as he quickly loads up a cart with supplies, heavy items giving him not the slightest trouble. When he stops to pull a list from his back pocket, he pulls off his right work glove with his teeth and grabs the pencil from above his ear, checking off items with an intense concentration that brings a furrow to his brow.
“So?  They’re New Order.  Who cares if the new stuff is lame.”  He leans on Steve casually, his fedora sitting at a jaunty angle that matches the mischievous slant of his mouth.  The sweater he’s wearing looks like it may have been stolen from the closet of Cliff Huxtable and it appears he forgot to pull off the handwritten price sticker from Salvies.  Steve tugs it loose, taking some lint with it.  Bucky winks in thanks.
Steve carefully sets him down on the ground, disentangling their bodies.  Tony meets his eyes briefly and finds apprehension there.  It’s unsettling.
Not strong enough, however, to stop him from making scrambled eggs and serving them up like he’s Steve’s personal June Cleaver.  He says as much to Steve as he’s plating everything and gets a blank look in return.
When he and Bruce had finally paused in their work and he’d taken a peek at the clock, his stomach had dropped right to his feet. It hasn’t come back up, and his heart is racing like he ran over here rather than drove.
Steve starts shooting down Tony’s throat, the feel of it so tight and hot as Tony swallows around him, but then Tony pulls back. He floods Tony’s mouth, Tony groaning wantonly as he tastes it. Steve’s orgasm is long and drawn out. He’s lightheaded, dizzy with it, but he still feels the shock of cold air on his length as Tony abruptly pulls off, and the wet, hot streaks of come hitting his skin as Tony finally takes out his own cock and jacks himself between Steve’s legs. Steve’s sight is blurry, but he can hear Tony groan and gasp his name as he finishes.
Tony pauses, frowning, and abandons the landing gear once more. He leaves Rhodey and walks toward the nose, switching his focus to the engine. He’d dropped in his own version of a Wasp Jr., something Pratt & Whitney had tried to bother him about once upon a time. Since he’d built the engine with his own two hands without seeing nary a blueprint from P&W, and his own alterations made it so distinct, they really hadn’t a leg to stand on. The fact he only used the engine for Rhodey’s plane and his own, instead of marketing it to the public, meant their complaints eventually went away of their own volition.
“If that’s true, then what are you doing here, showing me?” Steve counters. “Go make your money.” Loki puts a hand on the sink on either side of Steve’s body, trapping him against the counter. He tips his face at a coy angle and looks up at Steve plaintively.
“You say something, Buck?” Steve blinks his eyes open. He’s so pale and delicate like this, he’s almost
“Firstly – it boggles my mind that you know who Lady Gaga is; secondly, who gave you an iPod if not me; and thirdly, why the radio at all then?”
Bruce looks up from his reading as Tony enters, peering up at the group over the top of his glasses.  He closes his book, sticking a finger inside to keep his page, and rises from the wingback armchair.  He smiles tentatively, eyes flicking back and forth between everyone approaching.
The patio door opens and they stop mid-fight.  Pepper stands there with her hand on her hip, backlit by the warm light from inside the house.
“Did I miss something?” Tony asks, pointing between Steve and Natasha.  Steve doesn’t bother with a reply.
“The old family abode, la Casa de Stark, le Maison du Mssrs Moneybags of generations past…Fury says the rest of our wayward compatriots are finally back stateside after their super top secret hush-hush government-sanctioned gallivanting around the globe.  Since this tower is pretty much still an empty husk above floor fifty, I’ve offered the mansion up as a temporary crash pad.  You’re welcome to be anti-social and stay here, but just know that if that’s what you choose, I will text you incessantly with minute-by-minute updates of all the incredibly tense and/or thoroughly awkward ‘fun’ that living with both Widow and Cap will surely provide.”
“Last time, I didn’t have the Hulk as back up.” Tony points out, jabbing the up button on the elevator repeatedly.  “You think Fury will refuse me again if Banner’s glaring at him over my shoulder, turning green?”
Steve stands there stupidly as Tony casually cleans them both off, first Steve’s cock and then between his own legs. He tosses the towel to the ground with Steve’s forgotten bed sheet when he’s done, and then reaches for Steve again.
Tony eyes the damage, hand going to the back of his head where Steve had just been checking for injury.
The metal bar hangs from the wall now, torn loose at one end and the plaster crumbling. Dazed, he manages to keep Tony from teetering while getting his left hand to the back of Tony’s head. He’d broken the mirror, yes, but despite splintering out from the point of impact, the whole thing had stayed together. No shards have come loose to catch in Tony’s hair or cut his scalp, though he might have a bit of a bump there tomorrow just from hitting his skull so hard. Steve runs his fingers over the spot gently and tips Tony’s face up toward his.
“We’re not on our way home just yet, pal.”  It’d been a joint operation, chasing after whisperings of Arnim Zola somewhere deep in Austria.  Government involvement outside of SHIELD made Tony uneasy despite the fact that it meant Rhodey could join the team.  If SHIELD is shady, other branches of the government are living under a fucking eclipse.
“What brought you down here?”  Steve asks instead, crossing the mat to where Tony sits at the edge.  “If you were looking to train for awhile, we can get out of your hair.”
.” His hand runs almost absent-mindedly through Steve’s hair as he talks, thin strands slipping through his fingers. “How did you and Bucky leave things?”
“Nice try, you minx, but no.” Tony won’t let himself be distracted. Steve’s not usually the type to sidestep the hard conversations, and he also doesn’t use sex as an avoidance tactic. Those used to be Tony’s go-to moves, however, so he can spot them all too easily with others. The fact that Steve would try this now only makes Tony all the more sure he needs to force this conversation before it builds into something more, something else.
“Okay.  Yeah.  We can do that.”  Tony steps out into the street, flags down a cab with crisp efficiency.
Tony swallows around him, taking him deeper, and Steve groans out Tony’s name for the very first time. It’s the most arousing sound in the world.
The door drifts closed, the bright light from the hallway sweeping in and sweeping out, leaving Tony in the relative darkness of the theater.
There are memories, memories that might be his own and might not.  They don’t involve the man on the bridge, and somehow they
They all power down their tools hurriedly, however, perhaps realizing their hungry stomachs haven’t forgotten the hour. He watches idly, not that hungry himself, as everyone heads outdoors, eager to get some fresh air.
