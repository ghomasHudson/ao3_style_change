Magnus shook his head.
“It doesn’t seem like a very good reason to dislike a whole race of beings.”
“I don’t know yet. I want someone magical because Libby is a magical baby, no doubt about it.”
“And you never asked why you collapsed in the Landmark. Why Sherlock?”
“Well, for the sake of improvement...”
“Ollie? It’s good to see you.”
"I'm having none of that,
Sherlock placed his hand on top of his childhood's friend one, her face filled with quiet joy and amusement, certainly what you would expect of someone like Luna Lovegood while seeing a long lost friend for the very first time in years.
John was starting to see what Sherlock saw in his friends. They were very talented, and also loyal. He would have loved to meet them in different circumstances.
It was barely a hiss. “Yes.”
Victoria kissed her goddaughter on the forehead and John took a picture with his mobile. Finally, things started to look good for him; he had a future and a big extended family for his daughter. He and Sherlock still needed to sort things out, and he still wasn’t sure if he wanted to continue his life as a muggle or join the magical community with his daughter and partner. The nurse told them visiting hours were almost over, and Sherlock used his full charm mode to negotiate twenty more minutes. John practically had to wrestle his daughter out of Victoria’s arms, and the lights flickered as they said their goodbyes, causing Victoria to go back to the cradle and whisper things to the baby, which seemed to work.
“Well, we screwed up apparently. The TARDIS did. Our Sherlock knows the Doctor, he is a friend, and he could clearly find the Doctor if he was trying to hide from us.”
“Stop trying to be funny, old man, it doesn’t suit you. Also, another thing that doesn’t suit you.”
? Hocus pocus and all that nonsense?"
“Well, see you all at the Ministry then. Thank you for the late breakfast, Holmes. Alissa.”
“Jack of all trades, you might call me.”
And that was the understatement of the century. Sherlock looked like one of those Hollywood big names in those robes, not that you could see wizarding robes in award ceremonies. Victor and him, or more likely Victoria and him, would make a lovely red carpet couple. He sighed, wishing somehow they would be a little more even in the looks department.
He nodded the dismissal and walked to the fireplace, took some green powder of the mantlepiece and stuck his head in it. John and Sherlock stepped out of Mycroft's office, and they found themselves in the hallway, right outside the lift.
“Thank you, darling, that would be all.”
"I invented them myself. When I left Beauxbatons, I was seventeen, on my way back to England, without a single friend, better yet, without acquaintances in the magical world. I enroled at Uni and went for Chemistry, trying to achieve a better knowledge of potions by mixing muggle science and my magic."
“And if something comes to really threaten my pack, I’ll consider it, but right now you got a dead Shadowhunter and a dead fairy. It’s none of your business either Harry, you should look the other way this once.”
"By we, you mean Sherlock and you then? I'm not letting you run around with your addict best friend after a skilled killer without me."
“You called me.”
“A memory of you and me, right?”
“Nice to see you Doctor Watson, as you can see, your wife is being cared for.”
"I'll promise I'll never tell anyone you did something nice for your brother."
“We need a plan now. If Moran didn’t already know we are here; I would say retreat and come back with backup.”
“Yes, I’m rude, and evil, and you are an overgrown child.”
"The first look at Diagon Alley, my mum passed out. The Professor placed her in a chair, smelling salts and all like a Victorian Lady, and when she came to her senses, she looked terrified. She looked at me, at the Professor, and, the look on her face, Sherlock. Fear. She looked at her son with fear. She asked McGonagall if she could take me to get my books and supplies for school. She'd rather trust her son to a complete stranger, a woman she only saw once in her life before, than face the unknown."
“Think, Sherlock. It must be stored away somewhere in that sodding mind palace of yours!”
Mycroft gave his answer in the usual condescending tone John knew he reserved to woo political adversaries in the muggle world. Fake, but effective. Roman couldn’t contain his admiration. God, he was a fan, John could see before, but the look on his face. Priceless.
“Don’t even bother. We need a specific antidote for this, honey.”
Dinner? Oh, he had forgotten entirely about Sherlock’s birthday. Sherlock’s birthday, which he now shared with his daughter. It seemed fitting, somehow, two essential pieces of his life brought into the world on the same day.
Oh, God, he hadn’t told Sherlock. That he was immortal. That was it. That was the breaking point between warlocks and mundanes, and if the detective hadn’t run from him before, he will now.
“Well, I was in the middle of a Dalek attack and stuff happened. Also, Ianto is not my friend, we’ve just met.”
He had been in love only once in his long life. He fell in love with another warlock, a warlock with a dark sense of humor, and frankly a better moral compass than John himself had. He wanted to change things, he wanted rights for his kind. He even decided to teach the children of the Shadowhunters who always diminished Downworlders. They had a passionate and difficult relationship, spanning through many years and continents, on and off, mostly off, to be frank.
"Kingsley's current term is rumoured to be his last."
“It seems. But I don’t feel magic here.”
John started to worry about his possible reaction to the memory. It wasn't like Sherlock to confess any weakness or mistake whatsoever. Then, today he had been more open with Sherlock than in the past five years, and he had reciprocated, giving information, expressing 'sentiment.'
“So, this is it then?”
John did as Sherlock told him, and the tapestry moved forward and split into two curtains, revealing a silver bowl, glowing with bright silver light. John had seen a Pensieve once before, in the office of the Head Healer at St. Mungo's. He never needed to use one, so he waited patiently as Sherlock circled the bowl and poured the golden liquid inside. Then, without looking up, he grabbed John's hand, pulling him, so he faced the magical container that was right next to him.
“I can’t believe he let the wall have that,” Alissa said.
Victor tried, nothing happened.
“Perish the thought. Gregory Lestrade is the alfa and packmaster of the London Werewolf pack. And the current head of the Praetor Lupus.”
He looked lost for words. Molly decided to take matters into her own hands, quite literally, by holding Greg's hand and speaking up.
“Even in the Shadow World, you would have to be something else, something special. John Watson, you always surprise me. So, pray, tell me, what kind of warlock are you?”
Just then, Mycroft emerged from the room, and Greg glanced his way, rolling his eyes as Mycroft roamed in the kitchen like he owned it, getting some really dirty looks from Sally and Molly, taking two Scotch glasses from the top counter and grabbing a bottle from one of the drawers. He poured one for himself and brought one back to Greg, who took it without any comment.
Great. Evening plans with Victor Trevor. This day was getting better and better.
"So he is going to be Minister anyway?"
“We will use Legilimency, of course.”
The gesture John made to Sherlock wasn’t cleared for polite audiences.
Sherlock seemed interested in Oliver's point of focus. John could see he kept looking a Victoria like he was trying to say something and changed his mind.
“I don’t appreciate your tone, Gideon.”
She had a British accent, unlike Rory and Ianto, who had a characteristic Scottish one.
John Captain? John turned to look at him, something was troubling him, but he then seemed determined.
"Yes, two Firewhiskeys. Thank you, Mr Smith."
“Even your damned cells are bloody brilliant.”
“Yes, you should be sorry. I don’t want to be held responsible, but if he comes near me and threatens me or any member of my pack again, I don’t care if he is the sodding prince of whatever, I’m going to impale him in the nearest iron fence I can find.”
“That is a little more complicated. When I stop using magic, I age. I age slower than humans, but I start aging. When you were away, I had to use my magic again. There was a war in the Shadow World, and I had to fight.”
The fire kept creeping closer; John could almost see the eyes of the snake flames taunting them.
Sherlock was unusually quiet, intrigued by the piece of obviously alien and really advanced technology in front of him, and John could feel his desire to touch.
His eyes trailed, and he made a sour face like he remembered some particularly unpleasant memory.
“We were thinking,
“Come on, tell me.”
“Oliver, I insist.”
“I’m not very fond of vampires either. I have to deal with Raphael a lot, since I’m packmaster in New York.”
“Some vampires are all right. A friend of mine used to be close to a vampire, also my brother seems to like the vampires from his territory. But not me. I’ve never trusted a vampire. The only one I liked a little is not a vampire anymore.”
“Victor?”
Which the man maybe did, who knew?
“Whatever happens tonight,
“The one who breathes and recites. The one and only fairy prince.”
“Contained.”
“Stop fantasising about my partner.”
Sherlock almost spat the words his way.
“You must remember,
“Texas. Close to the Mexican border.”
tie me up like the last time.
Victor gave him a wink and a flirty grin and John couldn’t help but roll his eyes. They went to the room now shared by both him and Sherlock, and Victor looked around while John searched for the book. When he found it, he took off his shirt and vest, picking up his wand. Victor gave his chest a longing look. John laughed.
“Sherlock, Victor, this is an old friend of mine, Roman Hudson, who is now the Head Healer here at St. Mungo’s. We were checking on Mycroft before, who, if he gets his way, is getting a discharge to the manor house. Roman, this is my partner, Sherlock Holmes, and my good friend Victor Trevor.”
charm, which only made it burn brighter and look menacing.
“All the strongest wolves of the werewolf pack live in this building. Greg’s flat is on the fifth floor.”
“Her body?”
“Magnus? Sounds theatrical.”
John paled and sat down on the bed Mary had vacated. It was still warm.
“I thought we already had Moran.”
“The baby is in the NICU, as a precaution,
“The last time I tried to call him father he went all out, eyebrows lashing at me and everything.”
“Nonsense Miff, I told you, that was one of your presents. I need to pick up the other one today, so I was going to Diagon Alley anyway. And I had something made for my goddaughter also. It’s her birthday too.”
"This is worse than laughing at a crime scene. I heard Percy was a little better nowadays, though."
“The reason you look younger?”
"This hurts me, that you kept me out of the loop like that. I would have done something."
She looked at Mycroft with puppy dog eyes, and the man himself looked back at Greg, asking for permission without voicing his thoughts.
John sighed.
Just the thought of it made him feel a little dizzy.
Again, Sherlock looked at John, and they switched.
“That I gracefully declined, if you remember. I didn’t want to go down in history as the one who ridiculed the Unseelie Prince.”
- Sorry about all the medical babble, I couldn't help it.
“Did you have a code?”-Sherlock looked stunned and didn’t answer right away- “A code, Sherlock. Did you?”
“We still have a couple of minutes.”
“No, but maybe our friendly neighbourhood potion master has one of those saved in one the multiple pockets of that coat.”
"You make a mean cuppa, Johnny," said Victor in a mock British accent.
“You know, you’d be a widower right now if Sebby had not pulled the trigger on that one. Though you might regret it later that he did.”
"Those days until September the first were hard. My parents tiptoed around me, murmuring to themselves when they thought I was not looking. The only one who was excited and elated for me was Harry, go figure. My sister told me she knew I was something special from the first time she saw me, mind, the girl was only two, but Harry was supportive and loving to me, and she, being a pre-teen with a lot of anguish about her sexual orientation, made that even more incredible. She made me tell her everything about the Alley, made me show her my books and was adamant to see me off to King's Cross when term started. My parent's left me before we even got to the wall between the platforms. Harry took me to the wall and waited till a wizarding family with two kids was standing next to us. The mother smiled, and Harry took her cue and told her she was waiting for someone to take her little brother to Platform 9 and three quarters. She kissed my head (she was taller than me at the moment) and waved as the nice witch lady helped both her sons and me through the wall. At that moment I made my first wizarding friends, Luke and Oliver Wood, Oliver was starting Hogwarts that year, and his older brother Luke was a third year Hufflepuff. We got into the Scarlet Engine, and my first journey to Hogwarts began."
John could see the compulsion spell working on Sherlock. When he handed his wand back to Mycroft, his eyes were out of focus. Mycroft pulled his wand out, and soon it was back in whatever secret compartment of Mycroft's existed in the void. As his eyes went back into focus, Sherlock grabbed the old alchemy book and started looking through the rest of the texts. He took a second book, a small blue one, and placed it in his robes. Then he set the old alchemy book into Alissa's hands.
"He is one of Mycroft's only friends; I hate the obnoxious twat."
The wall didn’t move an inch. Not good enough then? He didn’t think he ever had a great idea, to begin with, and he didn’t want to lose a skill that might help him in the future. So a memory, it had to mean something, but he didn’t want to forfeit a special one, because, let’s face it, most of his best memories were things he had shared with Sherlock Holmes. But it had to be meaningful, because if not the wall wouldn’t let them pass.
"Perce. It's been ages."
“I believe it’s called parenthood, and it happened almost two days ago.”
“Good. So this is what we are going to do.”
to find me? Clearly my family is made up completely of morons.”
"Yes, I was shocked to see that the kind lady who treated me like a son was someone so important. She lead us into the Great Hall, and I believe she looked kind of smug when the Hat declared I was Gryffindor material like she knew that would happen all along." He chuckled happily at the memory. "She found a way for me to write home without causing distress to my parents, she took my letters herself to a nearby muggle post office every time and picked up any letters I might have. Only Harry wrote to me, though."
Mary scoffed at the last comment and fixed her gaze on Sherlock now. He remained eerily silent through the whole exchange.
"Let me guess, she still giving you the stink eye? Merlin's beard, I wish she grew up. And Harry too, for all that counts."
John felt just a little deflated at that statement. Of course, Mycroft loved Victor Trevor, and hated John Watson, apparently.
“But the vampire said that he saw the quarrel as he was leaving the revels, well inside of Fairie.”
"Well, if she catches them snogging like teenagers it serves them well."
“God, and we haven’t even started with the flat.”
She opened the side of the incubator, and John placed his fingers over his baby’s chest. He could feel her heartbeat, fast and steady.
“Dibs? What the hell Victor? How old are you? Five?”
“I’d love to meet him sometime. Tell him how his mum and dad saved my life back then.”
"My wife is just learning about the magical world right now. Is it indispensable to remove her to Cornwall right now?"
“Yes, two boys and a girl. My eldest just started this past September.”
“I added some pages.”
And he grabbed her arm and disapparated on the spot.
“Touché. But is John your real name?”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m just really worried about the Doctor.”
"I will have to say I'm not, Mr Scamander. I'm a healer by trade. And it's John, please."
Now the look on Victor’s face was priceless.
“And Shadowhunters are not that bad either, brother.”
“Hell yes! I’m going too!”
John felt there was something familiar about him, he already knew who he was, or at least supposed he was Harry's godson, Teddy Lupin. He saw a little bit of his father and mother in him, and a lot of individuality, which was also good. Seeing him interact with Ginny he noticed some of his mannerisms were hers. So godfather had taken a lot of involvement in his godson's life. That is what they were supposed to do, at least. The man with the ponytail approached Harry again, and John had a vague sense of recognition once more.
Glowing again.
Victor beamed at him before adding,
“Bad form, Johnny.”
“You think so?”
“So what if I am?”
“John. Trust you found your wife well.”
They went inside without another word.
John smirked back at him, that awful mustache obscuring his beautiful face as he leaned closer to Sherlock. The taller man found himself leaning to John, feeling gravity or some unseen force pulling them closer. He was sure John was about to kiss him when the cab stopped. The cabbie told them they had reached their destination and Sherlock cursed London traffic for not been heavier that day. The moment had clearly passed, but the detective grabbed John’s wrist before exiting the cab.
John tried to process all the new information he had. They slipped into a comfortable silence for a while. Sherlock drank, making a face each time the whiskey touched his lips.
Magnus addressed Sherlock then.
It was John’s turn to look surprised and then snicker.
"And enjoying every second. Do you think I finally fulfilled your requirements in regards to this gathering."
“Race of aliens from planet Gallifrey. They are the guardians of time. Ianto is one of them, just out of the Time Academy. He and his brother, sorry, sister, are helping his parents fight a race of aliens in a planet called Agora.”
Sherlock groaned, loudly.
He had stopped blogging after Sherlock left. He got ready for dinner with Harry, wearing his fancy clothes, the only ones he still owned. He reached the restaurant early, and he stood up when he saw his sister, wearing a beautiful blue dress that brought up the blue in his eyes.
“Well, at least you get to keep it.”
“I wanted to come too, but I’m going to need to buy some new clothes for the party.”
Once again the image changed. This was fourth year John Watson, panting, Oliver Wood beside him, after a close call in the Forbidden Forest.
"Please tell me this is not the muggle, Mac. Please tell me this is not who I think it is. Please tell me I am dead and condemned to my version of hell."
"Good."
“Yes, Teddy was so disappointed he didn't get a Puff mate.”
"Got your message, Lissa, this will be temporary, yes? I have to go through Hermione if you plan on making this one a permanent part of the network. You could also use Mrs Hudson's fireplace, you know, hers has always been properly linked."
“Well, most Shadowhunters are uptight and rigid. Yes, the toddler in question is mine, and Alec’s. Want to see a pic?”
“Sherlock. You didn’t have to.”
“I can’t imagine His Royal Stiffness hanging around Shadowhunters. He’s always been so, well, so all honor and the wonders of Fairie. And the members of the Unseelie court have always been so unwelcoming of outsiders.”
"Well, if I must."
“But Greg, you can’t seriously mean you want him to come back here. Do you even like him? Do you even know him?”
She moved to kiss both John and Victor on the cheek, Victor offering her both cheeks. When they were alone, John looked at Victor and said,
“Wandlore is a complicated brand of magic John. I’m not much of a connoisseur. But I know one thing, people who favor elder wands feel attraction and affinity to those chosen by rowan wands.”
John picked it up and dialled 62442. An eerie sounding magical voice said
"Well, Tum Tum, you did complicate matters a lot this time."
, and the two paws that surrounded it. James and Adrienne’s paws.
“But I’ve seen those eyes before.”
“I wasn’t planning on leaving the Manor today, darling.”
He stood up and held his hand in the ceremonious manner that characterised him.
"I know. Mycroft misses nothing. Which is the reason I don't tolerate a lack of informing on his part because he does it deliberately. The man never just 'forgets' to do something. He only makes calculated decisions."
“Well, I don’t need to tell you the gravity of this situation. We need to solve this before the Clave starts a war here in London against the fairies. I spoke to the Head of the Shadowhunter Institute. I don’t think you’ve met him. He is the one who took over after Imogen Herondale left to become inquisitor. He was their ward, and also Stephen’s parabatai.”
One of the DIs called them in with an interesting case, more like a 6, but, really, cases were really light those weeks. He usually hated working with anyone beside Lestrade, not that he would tell the man that, and now with the former DI’s promotion he found that he had to tolerate the other teams more often than not.
“Sure,
“Tie you up?”
“Sherlock. We need to wait.”
“It doesn’t matter. I was just wondering. When you flirted with Victor, was it only because Victor is what he is?”
Julie Beauvale and Beatriz Mendoza
. His little brother would be proud of him. Sherlock didn’t know he was extremely hard to kill, and incredibly easy to anger. He was going to find Moriarty and tear him apart limb by limb, quite literally.
They were back in Alissa’s office in a blink of an eye, Moran’s beaker taking almost all the available space.
“Magnus, is that Seraphina Sun? How did you get her to come here?”
“Ask what you want to ask, stop dancing around it, Sherlock.”
“Out with it, what do you want?”
“Oh, I dug around a little to see if you had any wizarding ancestors. I was able to find that your father’s mother was the daughter of Septimus Malfoy. It seems that when he was younger, he had an affair with a Muggle teenager. Your grandmother was the result. You are a descendant of one of the oldest pure-blood families in England. She was not a witch, as you know. So magic manifested in the third generation, in you.”
“So, are we leaving soon?”
“Emotional turmoil.”
And soon enough, the TARDIS was making the same sound, which John thought announced that they were landing.
“We’ll be getting there soon.”
"No, you are. You are a total dickhead. You are going to be 35 years old in two days. You might not live to be 36 if you continue to walk your convoluted path. So just let me have this. Just dinner, with Mummy and Daddy, Mac and Griz. Hell, even John if he wants to come. He can bring his wife too."
“Yes. Good to finally meet you, Magnus Bane. You come with great references from the lovely Theresa Gray. Or Theresa Carstairs, as she goes by now. You are John’s brother too? Because the warlock mark...”
"You saw your benefactor as soon as you got to the entrance in front of the Great Hall I presume?"
“Shit. So sorry, John, sorry, I thought we were bringing you from a place in time when you already knew I was alive. But I guess this had to happen sometime. I do get an invitation to your wedding sometime in the future, and that could only be true if you knew I’m still flesh and blood somewhere.”
“So warlocks and Shadowhunters can get married?”
"Nobody is breaking our family, Mary. If anything, we are trying to protect it. And our best chance is to hide while we sort this."
"You, my friend, are the quintessential Gryffindor, you could be a poster boy for the house values if Harry Potter weren't the most famous wizard from this century that house produced."
“John?”
"Sebastian Moran."
Sherlock lifted his head to the man now, seemed satisfied and gave him a chaste peck on the lips. The man started again with his unholy pouting. John wanted the earth to open and swallow him whole from the moment their exchange began. Alissa seemed to read his mind, because she locked her arm around his elbow again, which managed to stop him from returning where he came from through the fireplace.
“Oh, you found me. Wait, you brought
“Yes, Mummy loves to prune them, a little early for it, I think.”
"She's not my real aunt. She's Victor's aunt from his mother's side, but I've called her auntie since I was a little child. Her sister is my mother's best friend."
“You don’t know what you are asking for. Trust me, I, know him. And Johann knows him too. She is ruthless because it’s in her blood.”
"That was good. Now, mine is a little less complicated."
"Obviously. I even managed to make a friend. My only magical friend in Britain, by the way, we lost touch after I transferred, but I heard she made quite a name for herself. She was part of Dumbledore's Army, and is now one of Harry Potter's closest friends."
“And who are you to talk? Do not pretend you’ve not been hiding with this one in your flat, trying and failing to be a mundane. Don’t try to make me think you care about what happens in the Downworld at all, John Watson, it doesn’t suit you. I have my priorities sorted, I will take care of my pack, my family, I’m not poking a stick into this shithole.”
“I don’t know the first thing about babies, but you know how fast I learn. You could take my room downstairs, and with some modifications, it can be both bedroom and nursery. I’ll take the room upstairs, and as soon as the baby gets her discharge, everything will be ready for her, and we’ll take her home to Baker Street.”
"I'll talk to her today. I won't be risking our baby. If she is reluctant to leave, I will apply for the license, and I will tell her the truth about me."
"Deduction is not magic; it is science, it is observation, as you know John because you at least are experienced in one of them."
“Always the knight in shining armor, Johann my darling. Put me down this instant, I’m not 1000 years old anymore.”
“No. Too dangerous.”
He needed to remember. Did he delete the moment in a flash of panic?
“Always the gentleman. So how is life this days?”
His phone beeped again.
John had missed an entire conversation between Sherlock and the head nurse. Apparently, their little girl was ready to join the rest of their family. John couldn’t help releasing a breath he didn’t know he was holding and kiss his daughter’s forehead. Home, maybe soon they could both be going home to 221B. Back home, with Sherlock. He was waiting for the dream to be over, to wake up again in the suburbs with Mary. But it seemed he finally got some good coming his way.
John took his drink and felt the heat going down his throat. His first Firewhiskey in 18 years.
"Ta, Sherlock. My house did produce a fair share of war heroes in this century. I was in the same class as one of your Weasley cousins."
“Add a phoenix tail to the mix, and we have the perfect wand for the most unusual man in the world.”
“But they haven’t seen you, right?”
“Noted.”
“See? Made you laugh.”
John's face lit with outrage, and he started shaking in anger.
With that, he touched his wand to his robes, at the same time that he transformed into the petite blond woman John knew as Victoria Vertro. She blew a kiss to Sherlock, and stopped to kiss John on both cheeks. John let her do it, neutral look on his face. She walked out of the door, and they soon heard noises downstairs, a happy shout of ‘
“Come on, Arthur, we can see the entrance to the Seelie court from Regent's Park. Don’t you want to come too?”
“Too dangerous, we would be exposed.”
"Apparate him at once to St. Mungo’s, and we might still have the annoying git for a couple of years until he eats himself to death.”
Sherlock shook her hand and remained silent.
“Temperature controlled fire. Excellent for brewing potions.”
He was soon back in London. He checked his cell phone. Still not a word from Sherlock.
Preparations for the birthday party begin. John's final gift is revealed and Victor lends a "hand".
He glanced at Sherlock before nodding to John and Victor.
, Sherlock.”
“So it seems. He can control more than one body, but he cannot infuse much of his living energy on them, so the decomposition process is not slowed down, like in the main body he inhabits. I doubt those bodies could perform magic. In fact, I told my brother that I assume he needs wizards’ bodies to perform magic with them. By the look of these bodies, he managed to decimate the rankings of one of the cartels that roam in the nearby Ciudad Juarez. They also supplied the weaponry. Which is unfortunate, we prepared for magic, not warfare.”
He could picture Mycroft’s eyebrow rising on the other side of the telephone.
“Victoria, remember I need you this afternoon, preferably before the party starts.”
“Ta, mate. Now, make it appear again. I’m getting the hang of it.”
"Dear friends and family, welcome to our home. Let us rejoice in celebrating a new year in the life of my little brother, Sherlock, now joined by his partner, Healer John Watson. Today, we celebrate both his birthday and the arrival of their daughter Olivia Watson-Holmes. Tonight, we celebrate not one, but two members of our family. I'd like to propose a toast, for Sherlock and Olivia."
“You need to get your two aurors back.”
The girl seemed distracted and unhappy, and John wanted to know what was troubling her so much.
“Room filled with acromantulas. I happen to have a history with them. Call me the acromantula whisperer.”
“Unscathed. Well, I made a compromise.
“Just that, that I was not gay.”
Nothing.
“Do you even know what that word means?”
“What the hell Victor? What the fuck are those?”
“Yes. When Miff was 19, Griz moved in with him. He started to turn a new leaf; he even got clean for a while. Griz pleaded with Mac, and he finally let her become his handler. That means, the compulsion spell Mac placed on him, he passed it on to her. That way he could have his wand back, and she would remove it from him if he crossed the line, that is if he used again. Then someone mentioned that damned twin and shit hit the fan, allegorically speaking. That blasted someone was me. So I ruined everything.”
"I'm going to tell Lissa you said that. She will have you begging for mercy in no time. She was lenient with you that day because of the...circumstances. And now you have what you always wanted, you know, Lissa is your family, your beloved sister, as you call her now."
“Yes, Sherry, someone left us out in the cold.”
“Yes.”
“You.
“Head Boy. Remus and Tonks would be proud.”
"John, tap this circles in the tapestry with your wand, first the one on the left, then the one on the top and in the end tap the second snake in the fourth row. Be careful to tap exactly what I told you to tap. This tapestry has over a thousand combinations and most of them, well, not good."
“You look younger. Like years younger.”
Mycroft nodded, and left. Sherlock braced himself for all of John’s anger. Instead he got a hug. He winced a little, his wounds were still open. Unfortunately, it was enough for John to catch it.
“This one still works?”
Mycroft paled at this, and John, Harry and Magnus exchanged looks between them.
“I need to leave, John. Today. I need to dismantle Moriarty’s network. It might take me some time to get back here.”
"Mmm. Mycroft spoke to me about a safe house for us the other day. I told him he was ridiculous. You can take care of yourself, and I have proved countless times that I can do the same."
“Look, Myc, look at the pretty lady.”
Nothing.
He lost his focus, and the silvery figure disappeared before his eyes. Sherlock’s face was closed, and John thought he could see the gears in his brain at work. He then walked out of the kitchen into the living room. John followed and sat on his chair.
“Gregory, it was the only way, someone called the mundane police on this, and instead of rerouting it through the appropriate channels the thing wound up in DI Hopkins’s desk. Surely you can see your involvement was necessary to ensure that he would retire from the crime scene, no questions asked.”
“My fault. I should have known. Ianto, from where exactly did you pick this guys?”
Leigh seachad. Basically stop it.
“Ford, please, our Father.”
“It’s not a love potion, Victor. Grow up.”
“My seventeenth birthday party.”
“Mimicking your movements with my wand.”
“Four of us, Harry and Gabrielle make six. Prewett and Creevey are still out of commission; I don’t want more people involved in this case than necessary. What do you think,
“Ow, careful old man, you’ll ruin the hair.”
. Mrs Watson is through this door, but they sedated her. She has a blood pressure monitor on. You can go in.”
"Maybe you could sort this one out if you saw the right books."
“I was not the first or last man who ever lost his parabatai.”
“Nah, we do compete for the most insufferable man in the world, though.”
But after Sherlock finishes destroying the spider's web, he wants to come back. Will he be able to get John back?
Simon Lovelace is a former vampire now turned Shadowhunter who is the current boyfriend of Alec Lightwood's sister Isabelle, both of them are members of the New York Enclave (more about them in chapters to come)
“Myc, try not to go against your wife’s wishes the next time. Because…” he paused and swallowed, as if the words were stuck in his throat, “your loss would break my heart.”
“Better?”
Harry nodded toward the rest of them and stepped into the fireplace, now alight with green flames.
“I’m three quarters Time Lord, and after I trained I suppose I could be counted as a full one. When Time Lords pass away, we are granted a certain number of chances, we can continue on, but on a different body. This is my second regeneration, my second body. My first body was female, and I met Jack with that body.”
Victor chuckled softly.
Sherlock pulled out his wand, and as he looked at John, he produced a silver fox out of the tip. The fox started circling the dragons, but it only seemed to slow down the inferno. John had to look at the fox twice before registering the shape. Of course, the man had a fox as his Patronus. John pulled his wand, and soon his fox hound joined the fox, trying to stall the flames from reaching his master.
“Well, well, aren’t you the ickle firstie!! Well, not a firstie anymore? Looking so big now in your Quidditch robes!”
"Nothing settled yet, we still have a lot of ground to cover today. I want to see Elle's memory of the incident in Paris."
“Missing? How? Why?”
Both men did as she said. John couldn't help to notice Victor's muscular arms as he grabbed him, and could feel his magic passing on to Victor.
“Mmmm, you’ll owe me one. In fact, I’ll do it if you name the baby Victoria.”
The nurse smiled at them.
ale. He even had a five o clock shadow now. Mmm, he probably didn't have any time to shave.
“Pretty darn good, that is.”
“I know you don’t believe me. But today I was there with you, and I could see the bodies. DI Hopkins and his team couldn’t see them. And surely you noticed how Mycroft and his team were examining them, clearly they could see them. So did Greg and his team, for that matter.”
He received a visit from Magnus, and some of his new friends. He really liked the little red haired girl, he couldn’t really believe she was Valentine’s daughter and the sister of the monster who murdered his friend. He also liked the funny vamp who hanged around her, the one they called Daylighter. They wanted advice, he gave it, they left. Just another day in the life of John Watson.
“I was trying to prove a point, sorry, Tum.”
"You went to that Cup? The one with all the Death Eater activity?"
(See the end of the chapter for
. A beautiful woman, the spitting image of Jackie Harkness, was coming out of the TARDIS that was parked in front of them. She raised her eyebrows, and John could see she was thinking of pulling a gun, a gun she clearly had somewhere around her thighs.
“The Doctor is missing. We are here to ask for your advice in finding him.”
I've always loved the many theories surrounding the patronus charm you can find everywhere on the web. There is a blog on Tumblr I love,
"What are the odds, two former wizards, one traumatised, one banished, finding one another in London?"
“One of mine too.”
“My brother serves the Queen, John. He
"You trust him with it?"
," he said.
“Can you both explain? Not everybody has a direct line into both your brains, you idiots.”
Mycroft proceeded to respond with sarcasm, as always. Anthea handed Sherlock a folder, with pictures of John. John was wearing a hideous mustache. He touched the picture, a look of almost longing on his face.
“Does staring at me help with the case?”
“Try the otters. Now, if you two can excuse me.”
Oliver seemed to find everything Victoria said hilarious or fascinating, a pattern John had seen before in his multiple conquests. He felt strangely protective of them both, which made him feel torn. Sure, Oliver was a good man, but John had not seen him in ages, he didn't know if his behaviour with partners had deviated patterns from his usual chivalrous self. For all he knew, that man could be a Lotario now. And Victoria. Victoria was flirty, Victor was mischievous, but in the end, they were lonely. He told John that he would give his life for someone to kiss him like John did when he pretended it was Sherlock who he was kissing. He was also a brat and had kinks that one could classify as unsafe. John wasn't sure if introducing them had been a good idea, but since there was no turning time around, with all the time turners in the Ministry destroyed in the last war that is, he guessed he should let it go.
“I’m going to try the healing spell on myself before I offer to do it for Sherlock. I want you there in case I do it wrong and end bleeding to death or something like that.”
“I’m sorry to interrupt the trip down memory lane again, but we have pressing matters to attend to. As High Warlock of London, it’s my business to involve myself with matters of the Downworld. One of the high ranking knights of the Seelie court was murdered today. The Seelie Queen is still in hiding and the Unseelie King suspects a Shadowhunter murdered the knight. We don’t know if the Shadowhunter had a cause to attack, but the King seems to think the quarrel came unprovoked. Apparently a vampire was witness to the attack, and said the boy leapt at the fairy with for no reason at all.”
"Goodnight John, we'll see you tomorrow, and
John opened the curtain, stark naked and dripping wet. Sherlock took him all in before handing him a towel from the rack. John dried himself a little before wrapping the towel around his waist.
Sherlock’s charm seemed to part the flames, but I wasn’t strong enough to handle the amount of fire they were dealing with. There was no door at the end of the small tunnel of flames. The fire seemed to get brighter, bigger and closer to them. John started sweating, the heat and the smoke almost too much for him now.
"Witches and wizards are living in hiding all over the world. We have our laws, our governments. High ranking officials in the regular government know about us and keep the secret. We are only allowed to tell our significant other when we marry someone who is not from our world, someone not magical. We call non-magical folks muggles."
"That's Victor mother. Her only sister. And the niece, that's Victor. Metamorphmagus, if you didn't know already."
“No, never, I preferred to watch. You?”
"What do you suggest?"
"Should we be having this conversation in front of the Head of Magical transportation? Since we all know this is a classified matter of Magical Law enforcement."
“Roman! God, you look like hell.”
for Merlin’s sake! But one look at Sherlock’s trusting gaze was the only thing he needed. His posture changed, parade rest, and he looked at the wall before him.
Sherlock opened the book and read the dedication on the inside.
“So you are Deputy Head of the Auror office?”
“Guess again.”
“You know exactly how old I am, and I know exactly how old you are, and it is time that you start forgiving and forgetting before you wither away. You are 1863 years old, and you still have a lot of life ahead of you. So please, get out of that shell, push your prejudices aside and help your sister with this mess.”
“I already texted Anthea, telling her you are not going in today, and any pressing matter she can bring here personally. You are done for the day, Mycroft Holmes.”
"We'll see both of them. Any news on Paris? Gabrielle promised she would send a file as well."
“She’s in London now? She must be coming back soon; Raphael has his panties in a twist these days. And she knows we don’t talk.”
“God, we are never going to have Miff’s party, don’t we?”
And John extended his hand for him to shake. Victor reached with his right hand, but John shook his head.
“Don’t be daft, of course, we will get out, he’s not expecting us.”
“I will definitely keep that in mind for later, John.”
“Rubbish team. They had a decent keeper a couple of years ago, though. He played for England as well, I think. I’ve always rooted for team USA in the cup.”
John was patient most of the times, but this whole thing with traps and riddles was getting on his nerves. Sherlock started talking, eyes never leaving the doors.
“The truth?”
He spent the rest of the morning trying as best he could to appease her, to no avail, and when Gabrielle asked the doctor to join them for lunch, he declined. He felt his wife needed space from him still, and he would try to give her at least that. John said his goodbyes, and as soon as he stepped out of the gate, he called Mycroft on his cell phone. He remembered the man preferred to talk, instead of texting.
“Making me look like I was dead?”
He went into the bathroom, and brought his medicine kit.
"Sorry?"
The teasing tone was there, but Sherlock still blushed, nonetheless. John walked to Victor’s wall, and leaned, still feeling dizzy. No one told him forgetting something could be such a sickening experience. Victor and Sherlock did look better than the rest of them. The wall was shielding them from whatever crept into the darkness.
“Let me fix that.”
"Yes, the real one, the complete one as a matter of fact. It was her life goal to find it. She spent years talking about it; I remember when
Sherlock smiled back at John, that smile that actually reached his eyes, the one that was only for him.
"Yes. But is more than that. There is a whole magical world right here, under our noses."
"Alissa."
“You two should get a room. The sexual tension in this room alone... But it will be hard to resolve it if you keep getting into a pissing contest all the time.”
“But if you interrupt my parents date at the Towers of Darillium I might not even exist.”
“They do. Trust me. It’s so funny. She is graceful; she won’t stumble. She is my only opportunity to open the door again without dying. Fuck, I don’t even know if I can open it again. Were you doing something when the thing opened?”
"Yes, we all needed to forget."
"We will probably end up eating with my brother."
“No, you don’t!”
Greg growled at Mycroft and stood, while Sally and Molly growled from their seats. Mycroft stood up and removed some invisible lint from his suit jacket.
She bowed and left, John already fully dressed by the minute she stepped out of the room. Sherlock grabbed John’s hand and kissed his knuckles.
“If she is like her mother, I’m afraid we won’t see eye to eye. Maryse and me, we’ve loathed each other for ages.”
John moved his robes, opened the shirt and lifted his vest. Just in his front, he saw at least ten bites.
"I'm not going anywhere, anywhere John, unless I know the full story."
“Doing fine, saw him yesterday when he went uptown to meet my daughter. My sister lives with him now.”
“Shit.”
Victor was smiling at him now.
So he did. He took a portal that same day to Idris, to meet his nephew and join a big party that included many Shadowhunters and even a distrustful vampire girl who kept giving him the evil eye. Keep your head low, John. He met the new Inquisitor, the man in charge of delivering justice to Shadowhunters, who also happened to be his brother’s father-in-law, and he was even asked to join the council, which he gracefully declined. Simon, the former Daylighter turned Shadowhunter hugged him, and he thought he saw some spark of recognition in the boy’s eyes. Catarina Loss was there, and Harry flirted shamelessly, clearly
“Being a werewolf doesn’t mean you are especially bright or even remotely intelligent, brother mine. That applies to the rest of Downworlders and Shadowhunters too, I’m afraid.”
“What do you want, Sherlock?”
He started laughing, a deep chuckle that startled John.
“UNIT. Now I know you are speaking the truth.”
around. Are you staying for a while? Daddy doesn’t say it, but he is usually happier when you are around. Why don’t you visit us like you used to? Are you mad with Daddy? Or is Daddy mad at you again?”
"No. I don't know. We need Madame's journal for that."
“It’s pointless, Sherlock.”
Gabrielle spoke with a beautiful voice, almost no accent at all.
“UNCLE MY!!!!!”
“And that’s when your intel is a day late. Emilio is no longer the leader of the London nest. The fangers have a new leader, and you are not going to like it. Marie, Myc. It’s strange she didn’t send a messenger for an audience with you.”
"Yes, and you would be in Azkaban for cruelty against muggles or Merlin knows what. So spare me the indignation, however rightful. My little brother puts himself in the line of danger too much these days, and I want to keep you both out of Azkaban or muggle prison for the time being."
No brit picking, no betaed, just me having fun. English is not my first language, so patience.
“William, apologise for that this instant. That man has risked his life for you countless of times.”
“Thunderbird?”
“But Anderson, My.”
At this, Sherlock released John and went to grab Victor instead.
“John. I’m not amused.”
"No. Madame Delglove's journal was in the pile of books. I'm going to read it, and I need to think, I'll probably require recalling every information I have about her, so my mind palace needs a proper sorting."
“Yes.”
“And now?”
“No deduction needed. Madame Delcourt recorded a detailed account of her findings in the journal. She also knew who was after her and why. My aunt left it for me, to safe keep. It won’t help us catch the man.”
“She is
She was beaming and holding her hand to her belly while she kept her other arm around John's elbow. This woman was all '
“And it is as valuable as yours, the idiot probably didn’t realise what he was holding, because no wand was ever as good in dark arts as a Beauvais wand. Alissa is a descendant.”
They arrived at the fireplace in the library, and soon Sherry was brushing ash out of their robes, fussing more with Victor, who was clearly a favourite of hers.
"And after that, you can walk out? Willingly?"
“So third floor? Your brother-in-law is in a private room, not in the ward.”
"I hope I'm at least getting a reward later. In bed."
“Did you find him?”
"Mary. We are talking about something completely different. Not your usual gun and cloak act. There is magic in the world; the world is full of it."
Sherlock gave him a real smile, a small and cautious one, but a real one.
“There is something else, Sherlock. Warlocks are immortal.”
“You know the way Myc. We’ll wait for you before we start.”
As they exited the building, Harry pulled John and Magnus aside, letting Mycroft and Sherlock take the lead.
"Your brother's boss is the Minister himself."
“I could say it was the other way around, my dear. See you both later.”
After a couple of minutes a fully dressed consulting detective was in his suit, that was more like a suit of armor than the man would really ever admit, and a retired army doctor was already in one comfortable jumper with a gun hidden in the back of his jeans.
“Nah, I know you excel in Transfiguration, and you are not a sloth in Charms either, but I have a hunch…”
“Try the spell, John.”
“Are we leaving soon?” Victor was back to being Victor, impeccably dressed in muggle clothes, green trousers and a black shirt.
, you know why. I would do anything in the world to spare him any more sorrow. I love this man enough to commit crimes against anything. So you have to do it to me too. But before that, I need to erase the memory from the room. Otherwise, I'll see it the next time I'm here. We need a powerful spell for that, and you need to give Victor back his wand. John, we are going to need you too. Victor, memory transfiguration. You lead."
“What do you mean by that, John? Clearly I saw them. I don’t know what’s wrong with New Scotland Yard these days, but the bodies were right there for them to see.”
But she stayed on her post on the chair, and Sherlock seemed to have tightened his hold on her hand.
He apparated on a safe spot he knew near Regent's Park, and he started walking. In the distance, he saw the tall man in a very posh suit and a Burberry coat with the checker pattern. He beamed at John and waved.
“Leave them be. It’s Sherry, anyway.”
“As much as it pains me to interrupt this flow of inane chatter, I think it would be wise if we started investigating the matter at hand. Or have you all forgotten the reason you abducted us from our sitting room?”
“Well, I’m calling you Tiger from now on.”
"Yes, everything is changing now. You are a naughty boy,
“Sherry, be a dear and bring some breakfast for the boys. Alissa is back to work, and Mycroft needed to tend to some matters. If you don’t plan to help, I hope you won’t make things difficult.”
“Otters?”
“And hello to you too, my shortcake. What’s the matter? I hope it’s very important because I was going to take Alexander to dinner and I was planning on getting lucky today.”
"I said no, Tum. I can't do what you want this time, or anytime for all that matters."
"Too much?"
“Victor, can you move this wall with us?”
“Mmm, I think something else. I can’t really put my finger on it, John.”
"Mind if I dance with the birthday boy for a second? That way you can gossip freely with this one. I can see you looking around, seriously Tiger, how can your eyes stray so much when you have this"- she said poking Sherlock- "right in front of you?"
“Keep it. You are not going with me.”
“Of with you boys now, rooms on the second floor.”
They waited a couple of minutes, and soon enough the fireplace started glowing green, and Percy's head appeared through it.
all around them. He found spells in the door handles and motioned both of his partners to stay clear of them. The detective touched the door experimentally, as John’s eyes went wide with apprehension, but nothing happened. He pushed the door, which didn’t budge an inch, before casting
He remembered those happy times before she started drinking and everything went to hell.
We are introduced to the London Shadowhunter Institute and their current leader, who recruits them for the case of the murdered Shadowhunter and Fairy. Sherlock's exceptional sight is finally explained as new secrets are revealed. They will try and solve the murders before the Clave gets involved, hopefully with the aid of the London Werewolf Pack.
"As accurate as ever. But our head of the Auror office relies too much on Alissa for the actual gathering of evidence, as he should. Potter is a man of action, Alissa is the brains of the operation. Her memory is the one I'm interested in. The conventional approach didn't yield much information, as you surely know. So we need her intake and her reconstruction of the scene."
“Yes, today while you slept I decided to brew a whole cauldron. That and three other easy potions.”
Mycroft looked amused and his wife positively furious. Sherlock grabbed Victor by the arm and made him stand in front of John, who was still wearing the muggle clothing he met Mary with. He looked at John, whose face was sour with ill-concealed displeasure, dismissed the look, and said to Victor instead of him,
“It would improve if you shower with me.”
"Department of Mysteries," said the lift's voice.
“We need to talk.”
“This is unacceptable. We’re not dying here today.”
"Yes, yes, I was sure you would see the similarities in the situations. I forgave you, because in my heart I wanted Oliver to forgive me that day, or someday. And I guess, even though you never fully explained until now, I knew you had your reasons, twisted and stupid as they might have been. I knew my own were idiotic when I wanted to leave my family out of my problem. I wanted them to be safe, as you wanted your extended family to be safe too. Merlin knows I failed my birth parents miserably; I couldn't even protect them by staying as far from them as I could. They died in the most horrible way possible for them, they feared magic and were killed by it. I overheard my father one day on my fourth-year summer break that I would be the death of them. I left that very day to Oliver's, feeling betrayed and furious. Who knew I would prove him right one day."
“But if you are here, you must be looking for your brother-in-law then? What did you guys use for the baby, a surrogate? Is your partner injured as well as his brother? I saw you barking orders to the trainee healers, you sure surprised them, you know, dressed like that and all.”
“I need to buy a potion.”
“I’m so sorry, Johnny. But I know I speak from everyone in this room, well except Elle perhaps, because she’s going to be so far away and she barely knows you, you can count on us, for anything. I happen to be an excellent babysitter.”
“So, it was horrible, what he did?”
John sighed as Victor chuckled, following his partner out of the room and up the stairs. The door to his room, their room now, was closed, and he opened it and entered quietly. The door to the ensuite was open, and Sherlock was removing his clothing, a vacant look on his face.
Sometimes he thought Mummy could see them too. One day, as he was playing with a grey skinned small man in the yard, he saw his mother running to him. Picking him up from the grass, he could have sworn she was glaring at the man, before turning her back on him and bringing him inside.
“Gregory, I’m so sorry.”
“So?”
Ah, so the news of Sherlock's recent indiscretion had reached the ears of one of the highest Ministry officials. Not good.
"It is Mycroft, she always thought of looking for it. She took years of leave, but she managed to get her hands on this. No wonder Moran was after her. He must know she had it. She was brilliant,
“You’ll introduce me, and I’m bringing Sherlock, so I’ll be the one who is breaking the Accords.”
"I would love to know her better. She is amazing."
Mycroft gave an exasperated sigh.
“John, I’ve waited years for this. I want
“So, where to now? I guess you want to drop that back at Baker Street.”
“Well, yes, woe to us all. We are forced to dealings with an angry dog.”
“And since Alissa is the best of us in that area unless you have a hidden talent we don’t know about Tiger, she is the one doing it.”
Sherlock looked lost behind them, kept staring at Harry through the window and throwing glances towards Oliver and John. John motioned at him to move next to him, and then he grabbed Sherlock’s arm, placing him in front of Oliver.
Magnus waved his fingers, and blue waves of magic, exactly like John and Harry’s, appeared.
Of course, Sherlock would notice he was listening. He probably heard the moment John stopped at the stairs. John cleared his throat, appearing before the pair. So, this is it, he thought. John wasn’t anything if not brave, so it was time to clear the air a little.
“I’m not letting you out of my sight! Griz would murder me slowly if I did, so I could definitely go shopping with you! We could go to Madam Malkin’s! Show her how your new robes fit! Maybe we could pick up another pair or so!”
“Shut up, Sherlock.”
"I trust him with my life."
“And your mood?”
“No, he became a hunter himself. A Shadowhunter. And they don’t really kill vampires anymore. They have a truce.”
“Well, most of them. For example, Dracula was based on a true story.”
“Potter has been kind enough to trust me with his image. I invented a charm a long time ago, the one I use with my left arm, to aid my metamorphmagus ability and going just a bit forward with transfiguration. I’m a perfect copy, down to the contents of his trousers.”
Two shop attendants separated them, and after being thrown out on the street, it was Sherlock who spoke again.
“John, send your Patronus to Harry. Mine seemed to have strayed; it went straight to Mycroft for help.”
"Preposterous. No, I'm afraid I lied to you, inadvertently I might add. I've never told you what happened to my other brother."
“Yes, we did.”
That night as he was changing and brushing his teeth in the bathroom, Sherlock caught a glimpse at his back. He could almost swear there was nothing there, not even one wound.
“I tell you what, if you manage to find some time to visit I’ll add both your names to the authorised visitor list at the hospital and you can sneak for a little while, both of you together.”
“This is all my fault. I remembered the last time we were here you greeted us both as old friends. I should have known a first meeting happened sometime! I just hoped it wasn’t this time, the Doctor isn’t even with me! Jack and Rory even went to your wedding!”
Mary didn't answer, and John stood holding her still as he managed introductions.
“Mr Holmes, congratulations on your baby girl! Your brother was telling me how disappointed he would be if you brought her home before he got his discharge.”
"So what happened on your sixth year?"
“Sorry?”
"I've heard of him. He was Moriarty's second. But he mostly stood out of the limelight. He was a very skilled killer, sent to eliminate threats on a regular basis."
John had barely managed to finish his breakfast. He stood up from the table, as Victor waved slowly at him, with a grin on his face that should have been illegal. The car was waiting for them at the door as promised, and they rode silently on the back of the vehicle, Sherlock grabbing John’s hand as soon as they sat comfortably in the car. One of the things John loved about being with Sherlock was that silence was rarely uncomfortable between them. They reached the hospital soon enough.
The spell bounced from the shield charm, and John took out his wand quickly. A bald man, with dark skin and grey eyes, was staring at them, and the trio started duelling without much preamble. John could see all the curses his opponent was sending them were killing curses.
“I was going to die for you, John.”
“Well, so that’s settled then. Let’s join Harry and the others and then we can visit our daughter at the hospital.”
They left the pub through the back and found a deserted alley near Charing Cross Road perfect for apparition. John had apparated to the door of the pub, and that was his first time apparating in a very long time, side along apparition even longer. But he was confident his skills could bring both Sherlock and him near the entrance to the Ministry without splinching. Sherlock locked his arm around John's elbow and smirked, and John felt himself relax and remembered the "3 Ds" chuckling a little to himself. The smirk changed into a confused look, and before they knew it, they were at the safe apparating point near the Ministry. The employee's entrance that masqueraded as public toilets were to their left, just a street away, however, they had to walk one more street to the old telephone box that hid the visitor's entrance. Nobody looked twice at them, even though they were two very well known London men in wizarding robes at noon in the middle of their city.
"Horcrux? I've never heard of such a thing."
“I’ll walk next door and tell Harry. He might want to add someone else.”
"A muggle actress?"
Sherlock was looking at him with something very much like affection on his face.
“The one you were having with my brother behind my back?”
“Touché. My mother is a genius.”
At this, Alissa walked to the fireplace, took the powder and disappeared.
Victor chuckled, and added,
“Sherlock! The table!”
John felt lighter than before. Sure, his wife left him, but now he had a more significant support network than ever. And it was because of Sherlock, all of them just bound to him just for having this madman in his life. His baby was minus a mother, but she had uncles and an aunt. And maybe even two grandma figures. Both Sherlock and Mycroft have asked him to move in with his baby. Well, Sherlock assumed, and Mycroft commanded. Could he do this? Could he grab his baby and go back to Baker Street?
Alissa raised her eyebrows, clearly saying with one gesture that the man will apparently wait for
John felt heartbroken just by trying to take his wand from him. Sherlock just walked to him and handed the rod back to John, not waiting for his command.
"Yes. Mycroft was, along with Severus Snape and precious few others, a spy for the Order of the Phoenix. He was never into hiding, keeping his place in the Ministry. But he revealed his cover the day of the Battle of Hogwarts. That was the day my older brother, who was a Death Eater, was sent to kill the Muggle Prime Minister and his twin had to stop him. Both of them were master duelers, and Mycroft managed to subdue him. But when he lost his wand, my brother killed himself with the muggle revolver the Prime Minister had pulled out to defend himself. Mycroft was never the same ever since."
“What did I mean when, Sherlock?”
“It’s on the way!”
"It's my passion. And it's nice to find someone who enjoys it, but that can also talk to me about different stuff."
Mycroft woke up, looking at them with surprise. One look at his wife and wonder changed into worry.
“Easy does it, Miff. We were bringing some stuff from John’s flat. No doubt Alissa already told you what happened today.”
"And after we finish the spellwork, and we obliviate you, John needs to do me. Just a punctual obliviate. I need to forget the name again."
“It won’t take us long to get there, don’t worry, but if finding my Grandfather takes more than a day I’m sure you would appreciate a place to sleep in. Agora at the time in history we are visiting is not the most welcoming planet in the universe.”
“You are alive, but how?”
"Even though John would've looked dashing with green robes, you only say that because you are still mad Victor made you kiss him."
“They don’t care!! You know the Dark Lord is a half-blood too? They only care that you have vision and want to work for the cause. We are almost 18 now! We will soon be adults, and we have to choose a side!”
They arrived at the atrium and got John's wand registered. The security wizard eyed Sherlock suspiciously when he told him he didn't have his wand with him.
"The Ministry?"
“VVT? Ragnor?”
“Well, short version… Not dead.”
. Anthea will be here with any pressing matter. I’ve to go and supervise
The book opened, revealing a blank page. Sherlock tapped the page with the wand. The page remained blank. Sherlock smiled, as he touched the page again, this time saying,
Sherlock approached his sister.
He produced a second vial, with violet liquid in it.
“Well,
"Nothing distasteful,
“It that a challenge? Bring it on sister!”
"It might take days. There's been a lot of fighting over her state from her surviving relatives. I've meant to tell you; she left you some old books in her will."
“Victor. Take down our wall,” Sherlock whispered.
He came back to reality, and gave the torturers a piece of his mind. The man didn’t seem to like his deductions one bit. The moment the one whipping him left, his brother chose to reveal himself. Soon they were out of there, the last remaining bit of the spider’s network finally gone.
“Oh, I will yell at you, just not when we have company. For once, you must know that I don’t appreciate to be called to clean up your dirty work. My team had no business dealing with a dead Shadowhunter and a fairy, ta for that by the way.”
has an excellent memory, and things are a little fresh still in her mind.”
John awoke in a sweat, as he took a minute to take in his surroundings. He was in his room at Baker Street, and it was already morning. The doctor took a moment to analyse his dream. Of course, he now knew he remembered Sherringford Holmes. How could a sweet boy like that end up a Death Eater? And the look on Mycroft’s face when he slapped his twin. Of course, he didn’t remember Mycroft from school, the Mycroft he knew had no real friends, was a real loner, before he knew about Alissa, that is. You couldn’t see red-haired Slytherin boy at school anywhere but the Quidditch pitch without his twin brother.
"Clearly. Come along, John."
"I thought Sherlock got rid of all of Moriarty's network. I thought Moran was dead."
“No.”
. See you soon.”
“It seems like a manageable affair. I will do the talking and John will stop your mother from murdering us both. Ianto and Bill can drive the TARDIS.”
“You used to bite people too, you know, and you were ten, and not three, if I remember correctly.”
"So what did you got us into this time, genius?"
“Stop it!!!”
“Are they...”
Victor was sobbing now, and John went to pat his back.
They chatted a little more about muggles in general. Rolf, growing up in a pureblood family as well as Luna, had little experience with muggle behaviour and found anything about them fascinating. Rolf admitted that he saw the name Sherlock Holmes on a muggle newspaper and told Luna, without knowing the details. He read that the man was a detective, and for him, it was a funny bedtime story for the twins that a muggle detective shared a name with his wife's imaginary friend. He congratulated John on their little girl, while Luna and Sherlock continued to talk, apparently so engrossed with each other that his partner lost track of Mycroft's movements.
“Is he in there then? Does he want to stop this? Because I know what the stories say. I know that this is supposed to be our last night together. If he wants to stop it, I will let him.”
“How many are we allowed to take?”
“We don’t even have a name for you yet, beautiful.”
“Six is enough.”
"Anyway, they were only there for a year and even though we kept in touch, my seventh year at Beauxbatons was the most miserable of all, because before I did not know what I was missing. I was already well in the way of becoming a Potions Master at the time, and well, I experimented a bit with mood enhancing potions."
Sherlock shook his head and uttered a derisive snort.
“Besides, he is my friend’s grandson. I trust him. And his parents. And his brother, sorry, his sister.”
“The otters, Grandma is brilliant!”
“Three cases and promised social interaction, Liss. And I had to give it a try at giving those fools their full memories back. Succeeded, obviously.”
“Thicker wall, now.”
“That’s John’s pet name for my ex-girlfriend. Victorian Vampire Trash. Ragnor Fell was a warlock… friend… yes, let’s go with friend again, well at least he was my friend. He passed away three years ago.”
Sherlock wasn't even surprised. John felt he ought to ask Lestrade for a pint more often.
Victor was running towards them now, the moment lost. His clothes had rips everywhere, and he was bleeding from multiple puncture wounds. Puncture wounds. Looking at them closer, John realised those were bites.
He heard the door opening, so the voice didn’t surprise him. What was Sherlock doing in here?
Greg Lestrade appeared, still wearing his shirt and tie, without a jacket, but clearly just home from work. He had a harder look than John remembered on him, and he was not surprised at seeing the rest of the group that joined Mycroft and Harry, unlike Molly had been. Clearly he had a little more information and background than his second.
Sherlock glanced to the kitchen, where Harry Watson, or whatever she called herself was standing. She was wearing a black leather jacket, and matching black leather trousers, with a pink cropped tank top. Clearly John didn’t share his siblings taste for clothes. He glanced back at the baggy oatmeal jumper and plain trousers he was currently wearing. Maybe he wore them to make the impression he was older, he suspected that was the reason for the mustache too. Harry went straight to Magnus and wrapped her arms around the taller man’s neck. She gave him a kiss on every cheek.
“Yes.”
Mycroft proceeded to shed his gloves, revealing the voyance rune on his right hand, followed his suit jacket and then he undid his expensive cufflinks and very posh shirt, revealing heavily marked skin underneath, filled with permanent marks and white scars where temporal marks had been drawn time after time.
looks, and the smirk vanished instantly.
“Holmes, stop staring at the old church. The rest of the group is leaving.”
"William. Relax. It worked, and she looked better when she was leaving.
“There’s a tunnel and light at the end of mine, Sherl.”
Harry looked at Sherlock then, trying to grasp what she missed before. She soon had a resigned look.
"I think this year could be our year; we have two new chasers that bring what the team was lacking."
John was upright now, looking straight into Sherlock’s eyes.
“Oh, yeah, can’t you see it? Mmmm, I bet you can’t. He looks lost. A lost Miff is a sad Miff. I could give you a ‘Miff expressions 101’ if you need it, hon.”
“I see that both Victor and you always refer to Mycroft when there’s something about the Dark Arts you don’t know.”
“I’m aware of the risks, John told me how they treat mundanes with the sight. I’m sure I can handle it. In fact, I’m sure the Shadowhunters are already bothering me day to day.”
“My agent. She thinks it’s funny when she threatens to use her abilities on me.”
Sherlock handed Victoria some eye drops.
“Yes. I was offered the post after Ron Weasley decided to leave to run the joke store with his brother. I’d been looking for a permanent post in London, so it was a good move career-wise. I was working at MACUSA and the CIA at the time. I had to obliviate people in the muggle world to disappear, though. MACUSA was not as hard to leave.”
“Yes. Of course. It’s your family we’re visiting, Sherlock.”
“That’s the spirit darling! Victoria is a beautiful name, you know. Fit for a queen.”
“Geez? What are you? 100 again?”
Aware of the dangers this time, they cast
The Lovelaces, Jessamine and George, are both Guardians of the London Institute. Jessamine perished in Victorian times, during the affair of the Infernal Devices and George didn't survive the Ascension process as he finished Shadowhunter Academy. In his honor, Simon Lewis adopts the last name Lovelace when he ascends as a Shadowhunter.
“Didn’t you want to talk earlier?”
Greg sighed.
"Yes Victor, John is a wizard, a trained healer, retired though."
“But by including you, it was done less suspiciously and the case remained in the Met’s jurisdiction. I thought you hated when I removed cases from your associates and reassigned them to my people.”
Sherlock was looking at him with intent, and yes, some fury.
“Wait for what, if you don’t mind explaining?”
“I know we needed him alive, I’m sorry, I just couldn’t…”
“God, we missed him again, didn’t we? We needed to catch the bastard alive.”
“Well, we just got past the terrible twos. Now we’re well into the tumultuous threes. He’s throwing sparks at Chairman Meow now.”
“Yes, they will be arriving soon I think. Don’t be alarmed, Sherlock.”
He took his umbrella and pulled the handle, revealing a beautifully carved dark wand, made from Elm from tip to handle. He looked at his wife intently, and he waved his wand, producing a silvery Falcon.
“So it seems.”
She touched the tip of her wand to her clothing and the dress transfigurated into wizarding robes. Sherlock, looking bored, raised from his chair to stand next to her after she gave him a 'better do it now' look, and as she touched her wand to his coat, it transformed into the grey robes he was wearing earlier.
They turned around and found a bushy-haired woman with intelligent eyes and a frown on her face. John recognised her immediately, and by the look on Sherlock's face, he wasn't the only one, only that he seemed the one happy to see her.
“Hey! I could have been me, you know.”
“Her known name is the Warrior, much to her father’s dismay. That’s what most people call him, and used to call her. Her mother called her Rory, and she kept her mother’s last name, since her father, being a Time Lord, doesn’t really use any. So, Rory Song. We have two kids, Jackie and Ianto, who use Harkness as a surname. But basically are called the Spear and the Thinker.”
"Victor. You are insufferable."
“Ummm…”
“I’ll leave it in Alissa’s office then; I don’t want to risk a curse into oblivion by trying to enter his office without him in it.”
The wait seemed eternal to John, but only a few seconds passed before Sherlock changed his resigned look into something else.
“She is an amazing fighter. I’ve read accounts of some battles she fought along with the Iron Sisters. My mother said once she is one of the greatest warriors she has ever met, and she never says that about someone that’s not Nephilim.”
“I just kept reminding him that I was an American officer, for crying out loud. Seriously, how could our dear Major Sholto even walk with that stick up his ass!”
Greg glanced at the group and offered the space in his sitting room.
"Well, apparently being an international assassin is better than being a wizard on her scale."
"You are going to eat, voluntarily, with someone?"
“Riegan? That brat? The same Riegan that I know?”
Harry grinned at him, glad to see the ball start rolling.
"I believe we still have a couple of friends in common. Well, in my case, family."
“It depends on how skilled an Oclumens the other wizard is. I think only Mac and Harry Potter himself could match Alissa as a Legilimens. I’m not worried, but this is taking them a little longer than usual, especially since both Miff and Griz are tackling his brain at the same time.”
“That was Harry at the Landmark.”
“Yes, we have.”
“Who sees something other than darkness?”
“We’ve spent several centuries without speaking to one another, young one.”
He found Victor looking at one of the pictures from his and Mary’s wedding, the one with the whole wedding party in it. Sherlock was in it, standing close to John.
"Your safety is my concern, Sherlock. You
“It’s Diagon Alley! Everything is on the way.”
He stroked the hand he was holding for what seemed like ages. Mary slept quietly, and he was lost in thought until he heard a soft knock on the door.
“It appears so, yes. Are you honestly so surprised?”
“Nice to meet you, sir.”
“Yes,
“I’ve never been very good at identifying wand woods, what is it made of? The core is dragon heartstring, I can feel it.”
Harry started speaking then.
“In your own time, Victor, surely you seem to be enjoying this cave so much. Do continue your useless poking. Care to try them all?”
"We might have to do it sooner rather than later. I'll talk to Holmes if you don't convince him, but I sincerely doubt it would be necessary, you manage the man as nobody else can."
“What life? I’ve been away.”
“I certainly did not. Your partner in debauchery thought it was prudent to listen to Cakecroft’s commands and why was I not informed that you two were back in London?”
Magnus Bane is the High Warlock of Brooklyn, and in this AU he is John and Harry's little brother. He is in relationship with a Shadowhunter from the New York Institute, whose name is Alec Lightwood. They adopted a warlock boy and live in domestic bliss. A gay canon couple is one of the things I adore from Cassandra Clare's books.
The grim face turned into anger, and his hand went to his wand as in a reflex. Harry grabbed the paper and gave it back to Sherlock.
“And don’t forget my mother only authorised this mission today. We need to make haste and finish this once and for all. Moran must be in custody and Azkaban today.”
“Raphael was a lying and manipulative piece of shit, even if you cared for him.”
John sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose again. Sherlock had never heard anyone address John like that, anyone but him, that is. Clearly, they were more like Mycroft and him than he thought before.
Sherlock cleared his throat once again, and Rory decided it was time to finally explain.
“No, your mother is working hard to give you a birthday party, and we are going. That’s the end of it.”
corridor, where, instead of opening the door to the central ward, Roman opened a side door to the left. The room was ample and well lit, but it still had that hospital feel, crisp and impersonal. Mycroft was sitting on the bed, sipping what looked like a very disgusting potion from a glass, at least that was what John could get from the look on his face. His suit looked wrinkled, and his tie was loose around his neck, but he looked otherwise unharmed. Alissa was holding his hand, her face had a couple of bruises, but John couldn’t see much more. She was apparently still angry at her husband.
“I’m sorry?”
He scoffed at this, and looked back at him with dampened eyes.
“Won’t know until we try it. I can make it thicker.”
“My apologies, darling.”
“I don’t recognise the wood.”
“You think you are so funny, old man. You can’t live without me.”
“I trust that you will find the Doctor, my friends, and until we meet again. Give Mycroft my best, Sherlock. Too bad he was taken when I made a move, as you can see I’m a sucker for gingers. I thought Greg was going to beat me senseless.”
“Yes, Johnny boy, experiment away.”
“You really have good taste in men, brother, I congratulate you.”
“Well, she is. She’s a mean killing machine, when she’s not dancing around with fairies. And this is the other half of the fighting duo. This is my brother, John Watson, formerly known as Johannes Sun. And I’m sure you know the other name he once held, and the reason I need to keep him away from the vampires.”
“Because I trust you now, and it can be useful.”
One of the things he appreciated more about Sherlock was that silence with him was pleasant, John should have realised a long time ago, one of the clues you were with the right person. No uncomfortable silences. John kept going over and over about the things he didn’t do this past few days for Libby, feeling all the guilt as it caught up with him.
They were back at Mycroft's office, the couple silently watching them and Victor was still leaning against the wall, fuming. John was holding Sherlock's hand when they emerged from the memory, and Victor eyed their joined hands, shooting daggers in their direction.
“Are you both insane?
“Sorry, mother.”
“Probably. You know I wouldn’t have rested until I got answers.”
“In this world, Gregory Lestrade is a very important man. If I want to keep peace between our allies in this city, I’ll do my best to avoid displeasing the leader of the London pack.”
Smith gave John a warm smile, and soon two drinks appeared in front of them.
His brother looked back at him, an icy, determined gaze that almost made Sherlock flinch.
“Sherlock, John, this is our daughter Jackie. She was trying to find her grandfather on my TARDIS before we decided on calling for your help.”
“Who?”
"I think she is acting a little closed about him right now. Not once did she mention anything. I don't know. You think she might be feeling I would judge her or him?"
"So I needed to forget then?"
“Keep your entrepreneurial ponderings outside of London, that was our agreement.”
“I’ll pretend I didn’t see you have an illegal charm on that coat of yours, Holmes.”
They talked Quidditch for a while, Victor seemed surprisingly knowable, and John had been out of the loop for so long that he enjoyed catching up. He reached the store he was looking for and bought the potion while Victor was distracted looking at potted Venomous Tentaculas. Then Victor demanded to know what he had bought, and John refused, so he pouted as John steered them all the way to Flourish and Blotts.
“Again, stating the obvious. How quaint.”
“I wanted to tell you. Personally. The warlocks have spoken. They want you or me to become High Warlock of London. I decided to run things over with you first, to see if I should just take it.”
“You’ve got to be shitting me. Seriously? Rowan?”
"Yes, and Beauxbatons alumni. She got decorated by the French Ministry too. Her sister Gabrielle was younger than me, she was in her first year when I was on my fifth, but after school, she became one of Alissa's close friends. She works for the French Ministry of Magic, and has done undercover work in collaboration with MACUSA more than once."
He felt sick as soon as he read the text.
“I don’t see them, Sherlock, but usually ghosts choose who they reveal themselves too. Or maybe your sight is just extraordinary, because they aren’t approaching you or anything, right?”
And just like that John was staring at himself.
Of course, Victor noticed, John didn’t understand a word he said, but surely he saw his reaction to the French. He was sitting across him from the table, and now the doctor blushed.
"Well, I'm not saying one more word before you, so either you observe something now or start telling your own story."
"Torture, I told you before. I was tortured for days in Serbia before Mycroft finally came to free me. He made it sound worse than it is, John."
“Fiendfyre.”
Magnus laughed at this.
“It’s not your fault, besides she is getting a discharge tomorrow. And Father and Mummy are going to spend the night with her, Father while the party is going on and Mummy will take over from him. They were waiting for your approval to take over.”
She approached Sherlock, touching his robes, which transformed into the Belstaff. She nodded at John and walked back through the flames. Sherlock looked at John, who started walking after him. After he saw John was following, he walked into the fire.
Her wand flew out of her hand and she had only a second to create a shield with a non-verbal Protego. Wandless magic could only work for so long, and as she felt her shield waver the last thing she saw were two cold grey eyes staring at her, head just appearing from an Invisibility Cloak.
“For what John? Clearly you can see the bodies, as well as I can.”
“But not even a text, or an email? After two years? He’s got on with his life.”
John almost jumped, a tiny female house-elf, clad in a beautiful linen towel with the monogram GM in gold.
"He is surely expecting you now, Deputy Head Granger-Weasley."
"I checked, and double checked the body. I swear I didn't found any use of metamorphic magic. Dark Arts are not my area, as you usually say, darling. Maybe if Mac here had a chance reviewing the body, or you. But I didn't think anything like that could be at play. He was supposed to be powerful, yes, but that meant a man that could hold his part in a magic duel, not a dark lord. Skilled in combat magic, that was all the information we had to work with."
“Yes. Tell me, how is my baby doing?”
“Sorry, John, do you know something I don’t?”
“He’s currently at your wife’s office. But surely even you need some rest after this night. I don’t think your healer is going to let you waltz into the Ministry. You were a walking corpse for a few minutes today.”
Harry looked back at her niece worried.
“John?”
Sherlock was staring at the man in his sitting room, hardly believing what he was seeing. It seemed John’s little brother was a very fit, young, tall, handsome and clearly gay Asian man. He had spiked tangerine hair, and his hands were filled with rings. He was wearing red leather trousers and a black leather vest with no shirt on. Clearly oblivious of London weather. And his eyes. His eyes were orange yellow, with a cat slit, just like Harry’s had been. He was also wearing some kind of eye makeup and glitter. Sherlock stood up and shook his hand, and Magnus was suddenly checking him up. Clearly pleased with what he saw, because he smiled back at Sherlock and then started ranting to John.
His French was terrible, but he understood that. He didn't know why she was saying that then, though.
The last straw for John was Afghanistan. This time, he was wounded, and by magical means nonetheless. His arm was almost useless after that. Before Afghanistan, John had stopped using magic. And what happened to a warlock when he stopped using magic? They withered away. And they started to age. John was starting to look well into his thirties when he came back, wounded and miserable, cramping himself into a bedsit, like a wounded soldier, not a glimpse of the wonderful being he really was. His sister was battling her own wars, her marriage to a mundane crumbling, and her old addiction to fairy fruit kicking in. She was going to get trapped in the fairy revels if she wasn’t careful.
Mycroft had an amused look on his face, and Alissa looked politely interested at the turn in the conversation. Time to cover everything up, it seemed.
Sherlock was reluctant to leave, especially as he saw one of Mycroft’s men hunch near one of the two bodies, one that Anderson was approaching.
He nodded to the other two in parting, and Victor blew him a kiss goodbye.
Flourish and Blotts was almost empty, as he expected on the first Monday of January. No kids buying magical textbooks, no parents fussing over parchment lists. He was standing on a corner, book in his hands, "
"Well, your question has an easy answer, Mycroft opened the entrance for me, then he disapparated back to work."
As John opened the door, the detective could see how tense the other man really was. His body was in his military stance, and he could see his hands shaking in anger? Anticipation? He didn’t know anymore. They reached their flat and John sat, collapsed really, on his chair.
“John.”
“Can’t be. It’s too soon.”
"Mr Holmes, a word please."
John wasn't even surprised that Mrs Hudson was a witch too. Her cooking was too good not to involve magic.
All of them opened, synchronised.
"Do what?"
“I’m so sorry.”
“For how long?”
“So? How are we doing this?”
John actually rolled his eyes at his phone.
“Well, no. Ta for that. I’m just a regular human, well regular if you take out that I’m the daughter of two UNIT agents.”
“You know I can’t you evil thing. But I trust you can bring me back something suitable? Madam Malkin’s my dear, nothing less.”
John frowned, remembering his only Shadowhunter friend, crossdressing, cheroot smoking Anna Lightwood. And he guessed he could add Alec, Clary and Simon to his list of Shadowhunter acquaintances. He fought along Jia Penhallow. He used to like James Herondale a long time ago, Ragnor’s little protégé.
is coming to dinner, whenever we have it. Also, I’ll be working three cases for them, whenever they request them.”
“Your baby is doing great. She will be staying in the NICU the rest of the week, and if she is still doing fine, which I don’t doubt, we’ll move her to Intermediate Care on Sunday.”
“Yes, exactly that, yes. We need something else. Do you carry those Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder things, Harry?”
Bill and Ianto were full of manic energy, playing with the levers as John and Sherlock leaned near one of the walls of the control room.
“Amazing.”
“Who are we talking about?”
“Oh, your Grandfather likes a bumpy ride?”
"Chamber opened. Your mum panicked and sent you to France. Many kids were taken out of Hogwarts that year. My parents never knew students were under attack, specially Muggleborns, or they would have pulled me out too."
Victor’s tone was almost a plea as if he wanted Harry to say something different as if he expected Alissa to appear suddenly behind them.
Sherlock went to whisper in Harry’s ear, and Harry nodded, looking back at his aurors and Gabrielle.
“Talk? People do little else. So you think I’m crazy?”
“It was my bloody fault anyway. Who knew I will come out of my first regeneration looking like this? Hello, my manners are terrible. I’m Jack Harkness Jr., but you can call me Jackie. We haven’t been introduced before, as I was not around for the last adventure you shared with my brother and grandfather. Too busy trying to get ahead of my grandfather’s nemesis, who has a personal vendetta against me now.”
“Ah, so my sister in law is coming to town. You are in for a treat.”
"She saw you and John at the Leaky Cauldron yesterday in a vision. We both decided not to act on it. She has also started having visions of William on a daily basis."
“Most of them do, in fact. My sister stopped aging when she was 21, in my case it varied, I usually look in my early thirties, but she looks younger. My brother, on the other hand…”
"Sherlock Holmes? Luna dear! Your imaginary friend is indeed the famous muggle detective!"
Mycroft shot a daring look their way, which disappeared as soon as he saw the look his wife was giving him.
“Magic? You mean real spells and magic?”
John hated Jim Moriarty from the start. His interest in Sherlock was unhealthy and his flatmate’s obsession with the criminal genius bordered on insanity. When he was strapped in Semtex on the side of that darkened pool, he considered using his magic and destroying the little man before him. He even considered drawing a summoning circle right there and calling his father for aid, something he had never done before.
“Being self-deprecating doesn’t suit you at all. Do try not to be obtuse, at least not today. I have to deal with all of Mycroft’s ghastly acquaintances, don’t make me bolt before we are even downstairs.”
“I’ve meant to tell you; my godson wants to meet you. He is one of the few metamorphmagi left in Britain, and he wants to meet another one, with experience, like yourself. You remember his mother?”
And with that, the detective took his friend's hand and placed it on his cheek, her smile could blind anyone. John, who watched from the sidelines the whole exchange, couldn't help but smile widely at the scene between his lover and his friend.
“Git.”
. Let’s all see her. Do you have a name for her yet?”
“For such a smart man, you can be so dense sometimes.”
"Open your eyes, John."
They had managed to gather all of Moran’s pieces before the aurors arrived.
“And for that, I’m sorry. I hope I can make amends someday, that is what I’m doing now. I’m a Downworlder now, not a Shadowhunter.”
They both turned to look at the new arrivals, and the woman's face lit up lit up like the sky. She smiled and stood from her spot on the desk and walked directly to meet Sherlock with open arms. She was petite but wearing heels, and she came almost to Sherlock's nose in height. She threw herself in his arms and Sherlock received her looking annoyed, but as she was going to kiss him on the lips, Sherlock reclaimed one of his arms and placed his hand in between both of their mouths. She pulled back with a look of betrayal on her face, as he told her,
“And that’s when your partner is not a murdering psychopath. She sends her regards, by the way.”
Sherlock's hand was still on John's back while they walked towards Mycroft, and John saw with the corner of his eye as Victoria grabbed Oliver's hand and moved them further away, before her group of admirers in waiting realised that the detective left their side. Mycroft gave Sherlock a pleased look, which only caused him to turn around, and he would have left the ballroom if John had not interlinked his arms with him. Alissa also gave him a 'don't you dare leave this room' look, so Sherlock had no other choice but to walk towards his brother, wearing his favourite fake smile for the benefit of the guests. His mother was beaming at both him and John, so this relieved the doctor of some of his guilt for torturing his partner in such a way. Sherry made a sound like bells ring around the ballroom, assuring that her beloved master got all the attention.
“Where’s he going to be tonight?”
"Yes, now you can see he is the same in both worlds. I guess he has my name in some magical red alert notification. We should have used a fake name for me. Well, we were going to see him anyway, but I would have preferred not to give him the advantage of preparing any strategy. Now he probably won't answer any questions, not that he would have answered them if we caught him by surprise."
“My bachelor party.”
“Can you keep the wall? Would it stand during an explosion?”
“So, your sister is a very powerful warlock. So are you, and you started using your magic again, so you have stopped aging. In fact, I see your aging process is actually reversing itself. Do warlocks age until certain age?”
“Oi! Children! Shut the fuck up!”
"That is good. I hope William looks like her, but knowing my luck, I'll get a chubby squib for a nephew."
Sherlock rose from his chair, turning on his charm as well. His incredible memory was at play now, surely working everything John told him about the man and making his deductions.
"Yes, like in the muggle government he is the Ministry, well, him and Granger. She was never happy with my brother's arrangement for me. When she took office, she wanted to interview me herself, and get rid of my wand, but Mycroft somehow changed her mind."
"That is more like it. See you later, John. Brother."
“Sherlock. You are sure of this?”
“Mr Hudson, it seems I got it from trying to resuscitate our other friend by muggle means.”
He almost self-combusted when the whole Richard Brook thing surfaced. He knew Sherlock, he couldn’t believe all the lies that man had created and that little bitch of a reporter started spreading. He despised Donovan and Anderson for putting doubt in Greg’s mind. And, as he saw Sherlock on the ledge of the roof of St. Bart’s, he knew he needed to use his magic.
“If you are really that bored, we could find other suitable ways to occupy your mind.”
Sherlock snorted, and John wore an apologetic face. Mummy pursed her lips and kissed Sherlock on the cheek, catching John by the arm and doing the same thing.
“A modification from the name both me and Harry chose once, we were called the Sun Twins. She liked Watson, she spent a lot of her time in Scotland, at least a couple of hundred years, as did I. In the Shadow World, the ones who still know me, they know me as John Sun or John Watson. The ones who used to know me and want to kill me still used to know me as Johannes Van Helsing or Johann Sun, the twin.”
“Nonsense sweetie pie, I’ve lots of work to do. Can’t think what these people would do without me. Probably get themselves killed. Morning everyone!”
with a piece of his soul concealed?"
Just on cue, Percy Weasley appeared at the fireplace, removing ashes from his coat and carrying a common fountain pen.
He was asking John now, how long before you leave me again? John could feel the unasked question pouring out of his friend’s mouth.
John could see Sherlock’s mind working; he could almost see the gears turning.
“Some of it. Not all of it.
"Terrific, John. Never meth though, cocaine was part of some of the mixtures. Naturally, the Ministry of Magic caught on with my work finally, and I barely avoided an Azkaban sentence. The wizarding community was just starting to pick the pieces after the downfall of Voldemort's regime, and I think that, and my meddling brother being a war hero and all, was the only explanation of how I managed to stay free. They released me into his guardianship, and he kept my wand instead of snapping it in half. He made me go through muggle rehab. He even threatened to lock me up in one of St. Mungo's closed wards. By then I was already on a downward spiral, but I kept with my coursework and finished my muggle degree. Alissa came to live with me in London at that time; she almost got me clean. But I resented her ability to continue walking in both worlds. I continued bouncing in and out of rehab, getting clean for a while and then relapsing. You see, the only way I can get back my wand is by being completely clean. Mycroft made a complex spell up, a charm that tells makes me tell him what and when I use, even if I don't want to reveal it."
"Two and a half. And what you just said."
"Yes, yes, the golden trio, I get that now. But then? I was miserable Sherlock, I mourned you, mourned my parents again and the life I lost before. Everything fell apart for the third time in my adult life. I don't know what I might have done without Mary at that time."
“They tend to recruit humans with the sight. For their service.”
One of the DIs in Scotland Yard has a new case for them, one case were they will bite more than they can chew.
“Simon was turned against his will, and he never indulged in drinking from humans, at least not by choice, only by accident. He was a good boy who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
Sherlock was about to tell him the exact number; John saw his scrunched face and predicted this was the case before he stopped him.
"Bullshit hon, I know you hated the whole thing. But Mummy and Daddy loved it, so it was worth the trouble."
Victor's face changed at his last comment, turning into a scowl and outrage.
“Do you still want to?”
“Again, been there, done that.”
“Happy Birthday Sherlock.”
“You are Tiger, the pirate cat, don’t argue.”
“You identify yourself as gay, right?”
“Wands at the ready.”
"I've never been completely clean in the past ten years, so naturally I've never had my wand back with me. Yours is the first wand I touch in a year."
"Eleven inches, and... Rowan?"
"EXPELLIARMUS!!!"
John started to get angry, and really, he has all the right to be angry. Two years, and not even an email to let him know he was still alive. Sherlock seems to finally catch up.
“We could use something like this for the Aurors. We tried the hats, but they only have like two or three good deflects on them, so the expense was more than the worth.”
"What type is it? Ollivander's?"
“I’m thrilled for you both, Tiger. You both deserve it.”
"You do, just by standing beside me. That is the fact that will always keep surprising me."
“She scared us a little; we were not expecting her for a couple of weeks more.”
even asking. They would have starting asking at a younger age, but we pretended that you had mental problems and didn’t have the sight, for your sake. I couldn’t come back to visit, you see. Even if the Herondales were a little more understanding than the rest of the Clave.”
“You should have offered that, I doubt you are any good at it.”
“So do you, Dr. Watson, so do you.”
“You can tell them apart when they sing, and Patronuses are usually silent unless they are conveying a message from the caster, and even if they take the form of a bird, you couldn’t tell the difference in this case without the singing. Since he fancies himself American, it’s a crow for him. I always thought it morphed into a raven because he finally had shown his real self.”
“My mum, yes.”
He turned to leave the room before Victor placed a hand on his shoulder. He turned around and saw the pleading eyes in the man’s face, begging him silently to stay. John stopped and looked at Sherlock. The detective was still glaring daggers at Victor and John, but after a few minutes, he seemed subdued. Diminished, even.
“You think?”
“I’m about to become a widow, aren’t I? You promised, Mycroft Holmes! I’m forced to raise our son alone because you broke that promise.”
“Well, I guess we can start talking now.”
John's eyes filled with terror.
"Lissa insisted if you must know. It is the only picture in which you are with both of us at the ceremony. Such a pity Victor is in it too."
"I will consider it if that clears your head."
Some violence and blood in this chapter, sorry for the late update for anyone who has kept reading this.
"Ollie. Glad you could make it. I imagined Mycroft invited you the minute I saw Clara and Harry arrive."
"Mary? Does Mary know?"
“Sorry. Magnus, I’m sorry, young one. I’m not used to the Shadow World anymore. I was happier when all I had to think about was the mundane crime going around in London.”
"I won't have you and Victor planning my future without consulting me, Mycroft."
John wasn’t sure how they could pass more than ten bites from a Venomous Tentacula as an accident, but he guessed that was their official story. Victor started making small talk in no time, and Roman looked enthralled, like a little girl meeting her first crush. Victor went as far as to invite him to Sherlock’s birthday dinner party, provided that he too could be discharged to John’s care. It seemed it was impossible to say no to the man, because soon enough Roman was signing Victor’s discharge papers, looking pleased with himself. Sherlock rose from his chair to join them as they went back to discharge Mycroft as well, walking next to his doctor and placing his hand on the small of John’s back.
John swallowed, his mouth suddenly dry, and he gulped more of his whiskey.
“John. Two ghosts over there.”
His phone beeped.
John wasn’t in the mood for eating, but he was hungry, having eaten only stale biscuits and tea since the day before. He ordered the first thing he saw on the menu and proceeded to stare at the man seating across him.
“NO YOU DON’T!”
He winked at John, and he could see both his eyes were blue, as he wore them at the wedding party. Also, he was smaller again. He was indeed a very handsome man, and he had a pleasant expression. John didn’t know how long he could manage to hate the man. He grabbed John’s arm with his right hand and steered away from the park into a cafe.
“Oh, you can call me Mummy too, dear, all of them do.”
John confronts Sherlock about the sight and starts explaining things about the Shadow World. Something is unfolding, something neither of them are really prepared to face. Introducing Sherlock to the Shadow World, and we get a little background on John's past.
“No, they are just right there, talking among themselves.”
. She loved you in
“Beautiful name for a beautiful child. I take it you and Miff have sorted things out?”
“Bill Nye. God, you British people. It doesn’t matter. Ok, so what is it?”
, if you want to see a nice patronus analysis. So a group of crows is called a murder sometimes, that's why my dear Victor, drama queen extraordinaire, thinks his life is in danger. I think I love him too much to kill him. I'm just a sucker for the magical history bits they keep adding on Pottermore, so the housing at Ilvermony was prompted by a leaked Pottermore secret code. The Wikia has been updated since and you can see the houses
“Thank you, Sherry. We will be joining them in a moment.”
“What’s wrong Sherlock?”
“Don’t you think it’s taking them too long?”
"You mean that? Magic,
Sherlock was silent then and motioned his hands as to tell John to go on.
“Please, John. I’m not some blushing damsel in distress that you need to protect. I want to meet your brother and sister properly. And I’m really interested if they will bring new information for the case.”
John pulled the thin wooden stick out of his robes and without a second thought placed it his friend's stretched palm.
“Venomous Tentacula, I presume?”
“Here, use this. You look like hell.”
"So he is basically an
“Liss, let me loan Victor my magic, and you can aid John in the healing process.”
Harry gasped, and Mycroft pressed the bridge of his nose.
“Time is of the essence here. We need to set things up for tonight. Alissa, Tum, I need you both. John, you can stay here as much as you want, and I suspect my brother would want to stay with you. I’ve also taken a liberty. It seems the baby has some visitors. I’m wondering if you would want them to go up.”
“Wait, wait. Do you think we’ll need more than one?”
“Yes, I agree with granting you one favour, nothing far-fetched, though.”
At this, John laughed, and Sherlock joined him, before stopping suddenly and in a low tone, a little menacing, he said,
“I do, yes.”
“Touché. I guess we’ll be going to Baker Street now? Aren’t you hungry? Can we stop to eat?”
He managed to place a lot of things in his head, mastering the art of saving useful information in a special place in his mind, and erasing useless facts, like the planets in the solar system. Soon drawers started to accumulate, and a simple desk wasn’t enough, he had a special room in his mind for all the facts. Then, when he started his time at the University, learning new things through experimenting every day, even a manor House, like the Holmes state, wasn’t enough. It became a bigger property, like the one his grandmother had in the south of France, where he had spent many summers in his youth. But even that wasn’t enough. Soon he had a Palace in his mind, a Palace as grand as Versailles itself. And in the tower of that palace, all those things only he ever saw, the creatures, the buildings, even something as large as a town he glimpsed once as he was exploring the borders of France. The strange boys with tattoos, which he sometimes saw catching the tube. Other things he saw just a night, strange creatures that seemed threatening even to him. He even saw a ghost once, in his old flat in Montague street.
can help now?”
"John, who is that woman? What does she have to do with all of this?"
They entered the study, were they found a whole party of aurors assembled. Harry Potter was there, studying the maps with Alissa and Sherlock, Mycroft was sitting in a chair talking on the phone. Gabrielle, Dennis Creevey and two other aurors John recognised from his house were talking among themselves. Sherlock didn’t lift his head from the maps to look at John as he approached their table. Victor crouched beside Mycroft, talking to the elder Holmes softly, no doubt proposing his idea and letting him know John was ok with his part in the plan. Mycroft shook his head, looking at both John and Sherlock, and Victor looked pissed. John thoughts broke, as Harry went to shake his hand.
"Sorry?"
"So you don't have a wand? How did you get into Diagon Alley?"
“You read Dracula? I thought you would have deleted it. Well, artistic liberty from Mr. Stoker, but the name existed. Dracula was a modification of a name. The name of the high priest of the cult who first introduced vampirism into the world. They made a deal with a demon, and got infected with the vampire virus. I was a doctor in the Netherlands at the time, and I was intrigued. Then I got mad. Then I killed a bunch of vampires. Some of them escaped, and their spawn hate me. So I’ve kept my head low for a couple of centuries. The last time a vampire nest got an inkling of my location it was a bit not good. For the vampires, I mean.”
“Ahhh, but I did, you see. I’m a married man now! A family man! This strapping young lad who came to get you and your detective is my eldest son, Ianto.”
“Yes, I figured that when it didn’t let me into the actual dressing room. I guess house rivalries get on fiercely during Quidditch season and the Gryffindor team wouldn’t want me putting firepowder in their pants.”
"No, I thought she would not remember me."
John knew there wasn’t a way out of it now, he wanted to do it in private, but evidently Roman wanted to see his celebrity patient now. Mycroft intervened before John could answer.
“Take care. Whoever did this, is going to die.”
“Well, remain stubborn for a while longer.”
"Oh. I see it now. Mycroft wants to be Minister."
"John, we are now going into my sister's memory. Her view of the world can be disturbing to one who is unused to the input. I have perused her memory many times, and so has my brother, and he still finds it somewhat disturbing sometimes. If you need to come out of it, just touch your wand to your temple, and we will come out. If needed I'll go back inside by myself. Don't feel ashamed if you need that. It sometimes works to close your eyes if the flood of information is too much. Also, some places feel charged with more spiritual energy than others. For example, when I saw a memory of our time at Beauxbatons, the whole spiritual energy within the school made me vomit. I can't imagine how she stands to visit the place."
“Just, wow.”
“And so humble, my angel.”
“Institutes?”
They walked silently for a couple of blocks before they managed to find a cab back home. This ride was uncomfortably silent, and Sherlock could barely remember their cab ride to the scene, with all the flirting and that kiss that never happened. John was brooding, his mind clearly somewhere else. John’s phone beeped, and Sherlock was staring at him as he looked at the screen and grabbed the bridge of his nose in annoyance.
“Leave it there. We’re in. No one comes near my territory without expecting retaliation.”
“John, try to apparate us out of here, now, fast John!”
John stopped to check on Victor, who seemed to be dozing off on his back.
, you must behave yourself today! Victor, this is John Watson."
“I’m a Junior Time Lord Billie!! I won’t get a TARDIS and missions for a long time, I was just allowed out of the academy to help my mum!”
“Sherlock,
“Maybe I’ll start leaking water instead of blood.”
She ran to the door and evaded Molly, jumping straight into Mycroft’s arms, who had them already extended as he lifted the little girl from the ground. Molly was now glaring at him, a murderous looked that rivaled the looks of surprise from the rest of the viewers, who clearly expected nothing like this.
“Mr. Holmes, I didn’t expect you here today.”
"Congratulations. I didn't know you were married, and least of all expecting a baby."
"Alissa, she is like a buffer between us. Well, she is a buffer between my meddlesome brother and me nowadays too."
Sherlock nodded. He trusted the man with his life, even if he was keeping secrets from him. He tried in vain to remember the restaurant. John went upstairs to his old room, and he came back with a jar. The jar had something sticky in it, and Sherlock couldn’t really see what it was. John applied the contents to his back, and soon the pain was gone. In fact, he felt much better, almost as if he didn’t have any wounds left at all. Now the only thing he actually felt were John’s strong hands working on his back.
“I think we broke him.”
“Good job. Grand-père.”
The wall moved, and John stepped in. He felt something missing instantly.
“Tell that to Ginny. She would have a laugh.”
"So are you both back living with each other? Your brother should have told me if that was the case, he needs to increase your surveillance from muggle to magical whenever you are living in close quarters with someone who has a wand, he knows that. I told your sister the same thing when she moved in with you. But I didn't know you knew Dr Watson here is a wizard. I will be having words with your brother, Mr Holmes. Lead the way."
“Sherlock, yes, well someday you are going to know how to drive this thing. Almost as good as the Doctor, he said it himself.”
“You played?”
“I’m flattered, but I need you to focus. See this scar here?”
"I don't think Victoria is quite ready for that. She said something about testing the waters first."
“Holmes! What happened? You were supposed to call for us!”
"Yes, Mummy, than you. You'd better go then; I think Father is going to be worried by now. He'd think you ran away with some wizard."
Percy looked outraged at that comment, and Mycroft finally acknowledged the rest of the party present.
"Hermione, I assure you, you will receive an alert for every new development, and I'll talk to you in regards to my brother's new situation this evening."
“Don’t think I’ll be needing it, thanks.”
Oliver’s eyes brightened at this, and he placed his other hand over the one already shaking Sherlock’s.
“I do, you know I can be of use to you in this. That way you won’t have to do the legwork yourself, dear brother. I guess you could ask your precious Shadowhunters to do the sleuthing. But they won’t be as good a me.”
“Move.”
John had vague memories of Percy’s jumpers and Christmas morning, the one time he stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas. Most of the time he spent Christmas at the Wood’s, his family.
“Shit! Ianto! It’s 2017! They are probably not even married yet! They clearly don’t know who I am, and they didn’t know you, just your parents! Shit, shit, shit! How are we supposed to find the Doctor without them? Your mum is going to kill us!”
Their movements were slower and intimate, not as methodical and poised as the hosts, but certainly not lacking technique, at least on Sherlock's side. John was barely avoiding stepping on his partner's toes, but he let him lead him across the ballroom. The detective looked ecstatic; John knew he knew how to dance, hell, he was the one who taught him how for his wedding. But he enjoyed it, it came naturally to him, and it seemed like right now, Sherlock was finally having some fun at his birthday party. John could see Alissa whispering in Mycroft's ear and smiling without missing a step.
“And Auntie would love the baby! When you go back to Baker Street, she will dote on her. Oooh, she already wanted to meet her. I have to send her some pictures. I just got her a new mobile phone.”
"So you know he is a serious threat."
His phone beeped.
John was strangely calm as he reached for his phone. His new robes didn’t help him feel the vibration, and the thing was in silent mode. 54 new texts. John read a couple of them, all along the lines of
Magnus kissed his brother’s temple.
John felt a pang of guilt, of course, Mummy Holmes would want to meet their daughter. She had been nothing but kind to John and seemed delighted with the new status of their relationship. Victoria entered the room, wearing a beautiful blue dress that highlighted her eyes. Mmm. He thought Victoria favoured green eyes. She kissed John on the cheek and walked over to receive her kiss from Mummy and kissed Sherlock, who swatted her away, like a little kid hiding from a big sibling.
“Now, don’t be difficult. Just for a second. Mac.”
"My, I forgot how envigorating Wizarding dances could be! Maybe Father can learn some new steps! Heaven knows we've done enough line dancing for a lifetime."
"That was good, what you said. Thanks."
“Don’t worry. We are warlock royalty, my dear brother. Everything will be fine.”
He could hear Harry and Alissa in the background, and he felt cold sweat trailing his forehead. He was starting to feel sick.
Mary is introduced to the magical side of 221B Baker Street. She is not enjoying it.
“Old man!”
Mycroft’s voice was calm and cold.
"Now the place is unplottable, and only those who you allow in can come."
“Task force, government. Mycroft is one of the higher ups, don’t really know their whole scope but I know it’s one of the agencies Mycroft directs from the background.”
Sherlock lifted one eyebrow, but John managed to keep his focus on his breakfast, ignoring the unspoken question.
“He has an interesting rivalry with Ginny and her team. He was a great captain. I never saw you play, mate.”
The lights flickered again at the sound of John’s voice. Watson, get a grip, he thought. Everyone was still waiting for him.
“She went into the warehouse alone, I know it. She had a vision, so I went ahead and grabbed the handle. I guess I don’t have to tell you where I wound up.”
John found himself holding his wife's arm in the sitting room of 221B. Sherlock was sitting in his chair, back in his muggle clothes, and Alissa Holmes, also in muggle attire, was holding his hand, perched on the arm of it. A mousy looking man with a big grin on his face was standing near the window, and a beautiful woman with platinum blond hair was next to him. Mary looked startled but managed to regain her composure as soon as she saw Sherlock. She stared directly at his hand in Alissa's an looked at John as searching for answers in his face. Alissa was the first to break the silence.
“John, you need to lock your hand in Sherlock’s and the other one in mine. Not my wand arm, please.”
“Don’t release the handle until I say so. Open now.”
"I always wanted to tell you though."
"I know you wept the first time you saw a memory of hers Mycroft, but I think John can handle himself."
"I knew you would."
John felt her tears on his clothing, and she placed his hands on her back. The orderlies that carried Sherlock left them alone, and John opened the bag, touched the detective and the man just sat upright, clearly alive. He looked at John in surprise.
“Tried, but the wall found none of the ones I offered an acceptable one. I wasn’t about to relinquish any memories I shared with you, so I decided I’d give it an idea instead.”
He took a sip of water, wondering where the hell was the waiter.
And he hung up.
They all stood up, and each placed a finger on the spoon, Sherlock still holding John, who looked paler every second, and almost like he was going to be sick. The spoon started glowing, and John felt like a hook was grasping him under his navel. God, he hated portkeys.
With that, he stepped into the fireplace and disappeared again. Sherlock started pacing the room, and John just decided to sit in the chair Victor vacated and watched his partner walk around. Sparks began shooting from his wand, so Sherlock removed the holder and gave it to John.
“I’m going to end up dead, aren’t I? I should have known something like that was up when my Patronus changed. After all, that’s how you call a group of crows. Well, as much as I enjoy present company, I shouldn’t spend my last days on this earth away from other people in my family. It’s time to pay auntie a visit.”
“Don’t let Victor near your godson, Harry. He corrupts everything he touches.”
They waited in silence; John worried sick about Sherlock’s possible fate in America. Then the man himself appeared, a smug look on his face.
John sighed and placed his fingers on the bridge of his nose.
“You don’t know where I’m going!”
All of those in attendance raised their glasses, and a few people walked towards Sherlock and John to congratulate them, some of them were discreetly trying to get a good look at them, the elusive duo who preferred the company of muggles than living among their people. John shook hands with some people he knew and some he didn't, Sherlock standing right beside him and giving nods and fake smiles all around. Some people he greeted sincerely, like Luna and Rolf, who came back with an invitation to the Old Scamander place for them and their baby as soon as they could travel by magical means. After the long line of greetings, a string trio booked by Mycroft started playing, and couples began moving to the centre of the room, now cleared for dancing. Mycroft and Alissa opened the floor, as hosts were expected to, swaying gracefully like any well-bred couple with ages of refined education under their belts. Victoria and Oliver seemed like they were having the time of their lives, laughter interrupting some pretty creative moves, which Luna and Rolf appeared to be scoring instead of dancing themselves. Kingsley was dancing with Mummy Holmes, and John felt Sherlock almost vibrating beside him.
Sherlock seemed indignant on his behalf, and that did wonders for John's current dark mood. He must enjoy this, his friendship with Sherlock, for whatever little time they had left.
“Well, Miff can’t see this bloody potion I need.”
“Potter and his wife will be attending tomorrow’s dinner party.”
John was sitting in his chair. This room always looked like 221B. Like home. Redbeard was curled in the rug, and John was petting his head. Oh, Redbeard. Was he dying now?
“You met Luke at Hogwarts Harry?”
“Careful, Alec, he is the oldest warlock in this room, you know.”
He smirked back at Sherlock, his teeth stained red.
"Well, you know I don't believe in coincidences. You thought I didn't believe in fate either, but after spending a lot of time with a real seer, I think there is something like fate. You and me against the world John, I meant it, and I know now that I was not wrong. But try to refrain from hitting me in the nose the next time."
"Not planning for the case, you moron," his American accent more pronounced each second. "For your birthday!"
Magnus had a worried look on his face.
“Say hello to your uncle John, Max.”
Mycroft looked from his chair at the term of endearment and started walking to the other room. Victor motioned for John to follow him, and as John left the room with Victor, he felt Sherlock move and position himself just behind him. Mycroft closed the door behind them, and then he talked directly to Sherlock.
“That DI couldn’t see them. And you are not supposed to be able to see them either.”
“Got a call from my dear step-father, rewarding as it is to help family in need, I’m actually being compensated for my efforts here. So just shut up and let me handle stuff.”
"Brilliant, if I must say it."
Victor threw a positively smug smirk Alissa’s way and strutted to the fireplace. Alissa just shook her head.
She walked to the fireplace and took some powder from the mantel place.
“I’ve known him for a long time, longer than you John. And you know what I see when he looks at you? Devotion. Hope. Things I haven’t seen on his face in a very long time.”
“Count on that. Though I’m rubbish at healing spells, in the worst case scenario, I will haul your ass straight to Saint Mungo’s.”
Sebastian kept smiling, just a Jim stepped into the light and proceeded to slap the now bleeding and unarmed man for good measure.
As they opened the cooler, John turned away, ta very much, and Alissa pointed her wand at the contents. Sherlock grabbed her arm, muttering to himself. He was in a trance, but probably he and Alissa were still able to communicate. Victor kept running his hands through his hair and changing its length, colour and type. John was fascinated with the sudden changes, from red to blond, then back to red again, from curly to straight, from long to short, then back to blond again.
“Fiendfyre, yes. Nothing can extinguish it; it needs to die on its own. Probably after turning us into matching piles of ashes. There’s a charm to eradicate it, but I’ve seemed to have misplaced the information.”
Oliver was trying very hard and failing to contain his laughter, while Victoria feigned mock indignation to John's words while at the same time hauling Sherlock to the dance floor. They seemed to be doing some serious talking while at the same time doing the traditional more complicated versions of the steps, throwing words at each other as easily as they moved through the dance floor. Oliver followed them with his gaze, apparently mesmerised by his former dance companion. John took this as an opportunity to talk to his friend once more.
This civility from Sherlock to Mycroft was starting to unnerve John a little. He preferred the banter the brothers usually had. And John suddenly remembered something.
John threw an annoyed look as Sherlock continued crawling over the floor of the warehouse. He pulled some tape from his robes and started gathering samples, a satisfied look on his face. Sherlock stared at the front vacantly, no doubt gathering all the info available on his mind palace. The detective touched the dust and placed a finger to his mouth, and then he leapt from the floor.
“Pleaaase, call me Magnus, Magnus the Magnificent.”
"So I guess dinner today is out of the question, then?"
He didn’t realise how tired he was until he reached the manor, Sherlock with a hand on the small of his back and Victoria’s voice as she talked to Sherry seemed so far away.
Pulling the thugs and arranging them near to the now scared mastermind, who was witnessing an army doctor bumping fists with a criminal overlord.
So that was how John got his ugly mustache.
“UNIT?”
“Everyone, touch the spoon. I needed, no, wanted, Percy’s blessing to set a Portkey for a Muggle Hospital. He made it himself. It’s going to activate in two minutes, so I suggest you all move. I hope Gabrielle has Mary’s room free of muggles.”
and why is it standing in the middle of our sitting room?”
“My son was having a bit of trouble with his grandfather’s old nemesis, which unfortunately resulted in him being thrown in a batch of poisonous gas and radiation to save a human girl. This triggered his first allowed regeneration. After which, he came out looking like this.”
“I know.”
Sherlock was fuming; John could sense it when he was walking away from his sister and her wife, who still looked startled after Sherlock gave her a piece of his mind.
“You seem to really dislike vampires, John. I wonder why.”
“Mycroft told me once he couldn’t see it, John.”
“I thought you would give it a memory.”
Sherlock moved close to him, and spoke low enough that he was sure only his brother could catch. Well, he didn’t think warlocks had enhanced hearing anyway.
“Glad to see you again, Sherlock.”
“Likewise, but call me Greg or Lestrade, everyone does. This are my second and third in command, Molly Hooper and Sally Donovan.”
“And what about John Watson?”
“Is it a love potion?”
They emerged into a busy Parisian street in the middle of the day, packed with shops. John watched as the beautiful blonde from the flat, which he now knew was Gabrielle Delacour, made her way amongst the unsuspecting crowd. They followed her in silence, John staying away from the people, as he felt uncomfortable when they walked through him like ghosts. John reminded himself once again that this was only a memory. He felt Sherlock watching him, as he continued to pursue Gabrielle through the streets. She stopped in front of a classic looking apartment building. Gabrielle tapped her wand twice in between two walls, and a door emerged. She knocked the door twice and waited. No answer. She placed the tip on the lock. Nothing happened. She muttered spells, and finally one managed to open it. Sherlock and John followed her into a richly decorated hallway, completely dark. Gabrielle lit her wand and walked the house as she knew the place. The end of the corridor took them into the living room, also dark, with beautiful classic furniture, probably all of them priceless antiques.
