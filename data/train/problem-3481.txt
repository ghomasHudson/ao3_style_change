Dean smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes and cas could tell he felt bad about it, and he couldn't hold a grudge, not when Dean's green eyes looked so dull.
Sunday morning began as normal, with one big difference though. Dean was awake before cas. This rarely happened as cas always woke up at the ass crack of dawn.
Sam rambled, Dean felt kinda bad, he was drunk and didn't really want to think about his brother, but Sam looked like he was going to either punch Dean or hug him.
(Smut would be here, but, idk how to write, if you want it, comment and i'll add it at the end of the fic. All that's really important is cas left hickeys, a lot.)
Shit. This made cas blush like a damn tomato. Why couldn't he have worn a turtle neck, dean had hidden hickeys before.
When dean returned from the date getting messages of cas saying he heard what sounded like meowing in a bush, dean couldn't help but laugh slightly as he told him not to go out unless he wants to be a guy who dies in the horror movie or attacked by a racoon.
Unbeknownst to him, dean had uploaded a new video, a short vlog type with no editing, right in the middle of his class.
Meg screeched, and looked at cas. He already knew what he was gonna ask so he already started putting the video on the board.
He ignored the texts. He didn't know if they were from Sam or cas, but he just wanted to live in ignorant bliss, even if it was just for afew hours.
He didn't want to be a dick to his brother, but right now, all he wanted was to sleep in his bed at bobbys, and just, not think.
Dean - you are NOT picking me up in that pimp mobile of a car, we're taking baby. I’ll pick you up :P
Not to mention, cas was a dude. Oddly enough, this wasn't the factor that made dean absolutely say no, honestly, he didn't really care that cas was a dude, but he knew his dad would.
Sam was right, that was Dean's regular routine, but Cas talked about a Bee documentary for 30 minutes straight and Dean couldn't break him with how bright his eyes got when he discussed how important they are.
“Is all the stuff that you said in the cooking collab with charlie true? Are you the top? Did you leave all the hickeys over Dean's neck? Is that why you were buying condoms on friday?”
Thankfully Deans slight panic was temporarily subdued with a goodnight text from cas with a sleeping bee.
After Sam and Dean were dragged off by their dad again, Dean became surprisingly closed off for a few weeks.
Cas said as he took a plate next to Dean on the counter, half the eggs already gone by the time he made it to the couch, dean in tow.
Cas woke up with his alarm blaring and his boyfriend wrapped around his waist. He loved the man but he clung to him like a koala when he was asleep, hell, even when he was awake. Cas didn't mind, but it did become a hassle when he was having to get ready to teach a bunch of snotty teenagers at 6 in the morning.
“Wow Sammy, I thought you were meant to be the one who was emotional and shit between the two of us.”
Instead of seeing two students kicking and punching, he instead saw his petrified boyfriend standing there taking pictures and signing homeworks with mechanical pencils and glitter pens.
Cas came through a minute later, dressed in deans clothes, and Dean tried his best to suppress the blush rising in his cheeks.
Of course Dean still loved to go out and get laid. He was a hrony twenty something year old, of course he was gonna go out to clubs.
He gave them to cas who was still sitting in the bathroom, handed them to him and told him to meet them in the kitchen area.
Sam noticed immediately, but Dean just said he missed having his own room at bobbys and smiled, and Sam didn't push. He knew Dean better than that.
Cas realized this was all of the cutscenes from previous videos. He was slightly concerned in case Dean showed one of the more heated cut scenes.
He never wanted to see his students outside of work, let alone his most intrusive student seeing him outside of school with a basket full of pie, cleaning supplies and condoms. Unfortunately he couldn't escape.
“I want an explanation, an actual explanation on why. I finally have a chance to get the truth, I’m not going to pass this up, and I'm not going to let you half ass an answer.”
‘Okay, well, i’ll get you some dry clothes and you can stay here for the night cause its late, i'm not driving in that and you're not walking home with a cat in that.’
Sam was about ten minutes away from tearing his eyeballs out if he and Dean went to a diner and Dean practically fucked the waitress with his eyes again.
After sam left, john wasnt around much after, he practically just told dean to fuck off and do whatever he pleased.
He couldn't do it, he couldn't tell sam. It was just too much to let out to his baby brother, he couldn't deal with the possibility that the kid he raised would look at him differently.
Dean giggled slightly at the last part. Unfortunately that little bit of happiness disappeared when he seemed to think the weight of the situation seemed to return.
“His name is castiel, and we've been together for almost 10 years. And now, it's gotten even better.”
It started with small things, always smiling when he heard cas’ name, barely noticeable butterflies when they would touch accidentally, and the sheer loneliness Dean felt when cas was gone.
And within a blink of an eye, Dean was running out the bathroom to his car, muttering the word sorry, over and over again trying not to cry.
The video began to play, but it wasn't dean, well it was, but it was an older video. The one where Dean was telling a story of Sam's trip to the ER after some superhero accidents. Though it was the cut scene.
Cas’ car was the last of the day, Rufus wouldn't care since Dean was finished, and cas had that look crossed between a pouting puppy and an angel about 0.5 seconds away from smiting him.
Dean wasn't scared of many things, but falling for someone, a guy no less! It was terrifying to him.
He still didn't like chick flick moments, they were too touchy feely and Dean especially didn't want to tell sam how he found out, cause he knew sam would ask, and he knew sam would hunt down cas and make them discuss like it was damn therapy.
Sam said, standing up. Dean and cas just looked at him, dean looking terrified, cas looking somewhere between concerned and hysterical laughter.
Cas walked through to the living room, where he saw a somewhat stressed dean scrolling through comments. Now Cas was worried, Dean loved his audience, and if he was stressed about the fans, then he was not doing well.
Dean called up Bobby, who said he had a friend who had a mechanic shop not too long away from a two bedroom apartment Sam was eyeing.
Meg kept pestering and pestering until the end of class. By that time cas had lost all of his patience.
If only he knew that Cas was sitting across from him as he ate his food, slowly falling for Dean more and more.
Dean said, beginning to head off to the school, until Dean grabbed his hand. Dean simply looked at him, confused as kids came pouring out of the school.
It wasn't until Dean turned his sleep deprived self to look at cas, did he realise the effect his words had.
So, a few gay bars, a few nights of stress relief and dean was confused and scared and just wanted to run away again.
Dean looked somewhat terrified, though he was somewhat shocked out of the small feeling of fear building up by cas laughing, not hysterically but still.
Due to the open layout, while Cas was sitting on the couch he could see into the kitchen and talk to Dean and Charlie easily without shouting.
Dean sighed. Cas only giggled and placed a cup of coffee on the bed side table and gave dean a peck on the cheek.
“Um, so, yeah, kinda. Ok. So we have been together for almost ten years. Since damn highschool. And i love you so goddamn much, i would die for you. And i want to stay with you, forever, so um…”
Cas had talked to dean during his lunch over the phone, they talked about meaningless stuff, but they also discussed what questions are probably gonna be asked during cas’ next classes.
Dean dragged cas into the bathroom and sat on the closed toilet while he reached to get the first aid kit.
“67 chevy impala, and don't ever get dean winchester started on his car, he’ll never shut up about it.”
‘Cause y’know, dad and shit. I know you say you don't care when it comes to like, your friends and shit, but what if it is different with me?’
Either way, hope the chapter okay and worth the wait (it isn't) and be sure to check the notes at the end.
“I understand,” Yann stammered. “I understand him perfectly. It’s terrible to have to be someone you don’t want to be.”
They doted and spoiled and groomed and dolled them until they were as delightful as four sisters could be, and everyone knew who they were, and everyone watched for them. There they were on Sunday mornings, filing into church one behind the other, their Sunday dresses and church hats on, their long chestnut hair glistening in the early morning sunshine and their voices soft as they chatted amongst themselves.
If Sugar was a sparrow, her husband was leggy as stork. He stood with one hand held in the pocket of his loose slacks, his fingers curled around the handle of a beaten violin case. He was a slight man with hair that was going silver at the temples prematurely; he looked distinguished. On his large palm was a star, same as his wife’s, and his fingers were long enough that they appeared to extend the rays of the star themselves when he chose to open his hand.
“Grab your honey and pull em’ close!” She smiled, all well-worn theatrics. “We’re gonna take a little walk, ain’t we Nate?”
“They were out of shape and we had to do double the work just to compensate,” Dean snapped, glancing at Cas’ swollen left knee cap, the Ace bandage bulging under his pants leg. His eyes flicked to the rear-view mirror where Sam was staring back at him.
Night was closing fast, coming swift, and chasing the sun in her golden chariot. It would drop soon, like a fallen handkerchief from God’s fingers, and with it the hush, and the time of lovers again, stretching on and on and on.
They kissed while the water drained and dried each other off, toweling at shins and waists and feet and necks and faces, the breeze cool on their skin. They tumbled back into bed and wrestled a moment, shoving and pushing, child-like and joking, before they collapsed, Cas’ body cat-like and stretched out over Dean’s, legs tangled.
For the first time since this trip had begun, they didn't consult Yann Olsson's binder of miracles; they'd been given no indication of where to go—only
, was he still thinking about her? Why did her face keep appearing every time he closed his eyes—Lily Francis staring out the window of her father's store, elbows on the counter, fingers padding at her lip, waiting?
“Feels fine, really,” Cas murmured, watching Dean's hands press expertly here and there, over his patella, prodding at the tendons, calloused fingers sweeping firmly and gently over the wounded area. “I'll be in running shape in a few days, I think.”
After winding a path to the back of the shed, he finally found it and hefted it—gasoline sloshed inside. Turning back, Dean's eyes roamed in the filmy light. Perhaps it was habit, but his gaze strayed to the rickety bookshelves and an old hutch desk pressed up against one of the walls. Interested, he set the gas tank down again near his feet and went towards them, seeing whatever there was to see.
Sam and Cas looked at her; Dean choked on his food, beating his fist against his chest. Celeste watched him, eyebrow raised.
Dean pulled him closer, arms winding around him, one hand slipping back up into his hair, and Cas let his weight settle over Dean’s chest.
“Now, I can’t talk about all that here – much too lecherous – but you come home with me, and I’ll fix Low Blood Sugar here a pan of somethin',” the woman said, jerking her thumb at Dean. She didn't seem to have noticed the way he'd gone so still, the way they'd all gone still; she was all business, all distraction and moving hands. “I’ll try to give you what I can, as long as it’s in the rules.”
She tilted her head at Sam, casting him a look as if he were crazy, confirming what they had come here for.
They wandered for an hour, out of the orchard and back to the fairgrounds, as the sun was falling below the horizon and someone somewhere powered up a generator. The Ferris wheel lit up, and strings of fairy lights hung between stalls and trees and back again blinked to life, like low-slung stars overhead. Dean bought them all cans of beer from a cooler and a funnel cake for Cas, who had never had one before.
Cas paused and got to his knees, reaching over Dean’s shoulder to pull the phone closer to his face.
“Okay, but what about this? People don't just up and stop having lycanthropy. The guy in Nebraska? Demons asking to be exorcised? And we've hardly had any good work in months. Bobby, come on, that's just not natural.”
He had loved him, this king, this man, this house, across realms and spans of existence. His slave, his master, his lover—there was no form he had not known him in, there was no face he had not seen him as, and all through this he had loved him, had wanted him, had been slain by his love and resurrected again in the hopes that this time he would finally pull him out of the mud and be asked that cherished question.
Mud drifted beneath his feet in the shallows of the river and he heard a small sound, the water breaking, and leaned forward, ducking his head down between his knees to see where it had come from.
Sam and Dean broke out of their reverie, suddenly, and moved perhaps a bit too hastily across the room to him. Dean took his shoulder, out of instinct more than anything else.
A kiss, first. Surprisingly hard, Cas thought, when they stumbled back against the door and he felt the peephole connect with the back of his head, and Dean's mouth wide and open against his, breathing, exchange of breath, and Cas tilted his skull the better to fit, felt his heart begin to race almost prematurely. Took Dean's face in his hands and kissed him deep. Spiking flare of adrenaline (arousal?) in his stomach—he wasn't accustomed to it, to the sudden hunger and need that was coursing through his vessel, shoulder-blades finding the grooves in the door, slotting in. Dean slotting in between his legs, thigh a firm pressure there, his hands beneath Castiel's shirt, touching, feeling, exploring. This was not a guest room in Illinois. This was not lantern-light and cotton sheets.
“Mmm.” Sugar leaned into her husband's touch; the three hunters backed slowly out of the drive and took the wide turn onto the rough country highway, creeping out of sight. “September, I think. Don't you?”
“Clever farming, I guess,” Dean replied, still watching the enormous wheel spin. “Or something to do with that book Bobby was talking about.”
“Well,” Sugar began, “I wouldn’t know a real answer for that. I suppose it could have happened anywhere, but like Nate said, when the floods didn’t come this season—” She cut herself off.
Sam decked out the window-seat, cramped and awkward as it was, with a blanket and some spare pillows for Yann, after he called home to tell his mother he was staying with friends. The lie tripped off his tongue so obviously that Sam was surprised she bought it at all.
He was glad, then, that they'd be sleeping across the room from him tonight. He hoped that, maybe, with a third party present, they wouldn't stew in their frustration with each other, and with the situation at hand. Everything had gone so dull and dreary after the summoning of the reaper and it seemed that none of them knew what to make of it, and it was pulling all of their moods down with it.
After a time they decided to go, find somewhere else to light for a while longer before turning in, and as they walked to the corner to cross the street towards the Impala, Sam went ahead, hands in his pockets. It was clear in the lines of his back that his thoughts were meandering.
“Slick in the drawer, I think,” he whispered, against the damp skin, and Castiel’s fingers fumbled as they rattled open the nightstand, blindly feeling for it. He passed it to Dean and his hand fell back over the pillow, clutching the fabric.
Dean breathed it in. His lungs felt fuzzy, like a chest cold, like when they were little and Sam would fall asleep halfway on top of him, heavy head resting right on his breastbone. He recalled one tired English class in some nameless town, the teacher waxing poetic on the author’s use of the senses. Some girl in the front had mentioned that memories were actually most accurately recalled by specific scents...
Dean drove them into the city for dinner, going on and on about the music scene and the bars and the whole feel of it. He’d been to Memphis before, plenty of times. It was a good midway city, and he liked it more every time he found himself back there.
“Any idea what that has to do with—whatever? You said she was a Riverlander, does it have anything to do with this miracle shit?”
about? You don’t – know me!” Dean shouted, his tear streaked face glaring before it crumpled into pieces again, washed in tears and agony. He folded his hands over his face, palms pressed hard over his eyes. Cas’ hands had pulled back from him and hung against his arm, unsure of where to go, unsure of what comfort he could offer.
“I am so sorry,” she said for the third time, staring at them with her round chocolate colored eyes. “I was taking my break and I didn’t hear you come in, please forgive me, I am not usually so thoughtless!”
“Are you sure there’s nothing here already? We’ve already been driving quite a while; your leg of highway 79 is shut down until Wednesday,” Cas insisted, and the man scratched his chin, his mouth a thin line. They watched and could almost tell the exact moment when a thought struck him before he quickly tamped it down again.
He imagined Sandra Eadie flinging herself from the edge, landing hard in the mud. She'd probably imagined drowning to be painless, but something this shallow would have killed her on impact. Flooded her open mouth with mud and silt until she sank into the mire and was glued there, the current too weak to wash her away, bones peeled of flesh and muscle until they turned black with age and sank like so many sticks and stones.
about!” Dean said, trying to twist out of her hands. Cas bristled beside him, his eyes darkening protectively, and Sam was already moving to stand, slipping out of the booth and coming closer, halting when Tomas came tearing out of the back, nearly knocking over a chair in the process of his sprint. His long skinny arms wrapped around Rosa’s middle and he pulled.
“Remember those primary works I mentioned? I found a few things, scattered all up and down—stuff from hunters. I guess wherever this guy went and preached his New Gospel or whatever, there was a pattern. Every-goddamn-thing paranormal high-tailed it out of there for at least two months in his wake. Like nothin' nobody'd ever seen. Not surprised they made note of it. 'Course, it all went back to normal after he died, but it happened. People noticed. Our kind of people.”
“You think Sammy’s okay?” Dean said, his arm slung around Cas’ shoulders, Cas’ around his back, hand tucked possessively into his back pocket.
“Y'all are late!” she said, smoothing down her skirt. Her breath was a little hoarse. “Real late – I was expectin’ you a week ago! Lord Almighty, I'm glad I caught you—”
“Listen to me!” Castiel continued, puffing his shoulders up. “Put it back, it doesn’t belong to you!”
The three hunters had climbed out of the truck bed and stood looking up at it - a naked frame swarming with people. The air whirred with the sound of machinery, the heavy slams of hammering, the wailing shriek of chop saws and the drone of generators and whines of screws.
The sound of a door hinge cut through the symphony of birdsong and five cuckoo clocks went off at once, spitting out their little charming rings and clanks. A shadow fell out of the door and a woman stepped out, beating feathers off of her apron as she came into the room. She was singing loudly, undeterred by the cacophony around her. Her curves swelled past the hems of her apron, a plump, soft, womanly shape clothed in a loud floral print dress underneath it.
They'd all gone their ways to their separate spaces soon after Corinthian had gone, unable to stand the uneasiness in Sam's room. None of them wanted to even imagine the morning. Dean had a feeling that no matter how bright and hot it rose it would feel cold on his skin.
“Did you smile?” Cas asked Dean jokingly, and Dean shrugged, wandering away from the photographer towards the dance floor, hands shoved in his pockets. He turned his back to Cas, waiting, and Marcus shook the picture out vigorously under the bright light, standing in front of the dark sheet, and then went to the wall to tack it up.
“Shugi-bokuro. You may open later, but the other—” He nodded at the wooden box, and Dean slid open the cover.
he thought, turning his own gaze out the window. Cas was acting like a twelve-year-old with scabbed knees, for Christ's sake. He wasn't going to indulge him.
Sam and Dean appeared again at half past five, carrying brown bags full of penny candy to share, sporting the content, easy expressions that came from long talks about good things.
“I have seen so much,” Cas mused, casual and airy, tapping Dean’s collarbone, dragging fingers over his chest. He adjusted a little against the soft warmth of Dean’s stomach. “The Okavango delta during the floods...sequoia trees when they were hardly more than seedlings...the heights of every mountain on this planet. I walked the flat earth where they would be before my Father pushed them up into existence.” His voice was soft and thoughtful. He picked up Dean’s hands, pushed them together, fingers steepling under his touch. He raised the cathedral of bone and skin to his lips and kissed.
“Soon,” Cas breathed, into Dean’s mouth, as Dean’s hands mapped his body over his clothes. He whimpered with want, he pulled Cas closer to him, kissed him, threaded his fingers through the silk of his hair, hungry.
“Man,” Dean said, shaking his head and looking off at the vintage advertisement on the wall opposite, “that journal had better have some damn good stuff in it.”
Cas looked at him for a moment before he obeyed, pulling off his wet tee-shirt and boxer briefs and tossing them into the bathtub. Dean followed suit, shivering with night cold on his skin, and draped a towel over Cas' head, gripping it and scrubbing, pushing it over his face and his neck and his shoulders, chest, arms, cleaning off the clinging water a little too roughly.
“Mighty fine wedding.” Nate’s voice lilted. “A wedding of all things. Earth and sky. Water and air. Everything coming together, beginning as one.”
Castiel spent the time holding things for the man he had been assigned to. The gentleman was kind enough to understand that Castiel would be of little help without being taught, and had mandated him as his assistant of sorts. He held the tape measure and pressed his weight down on wood to be cut so it would not snap and caught the split pieces, tossing them into the scrap pile.
It was dim and quiet inside. Cas paused beside the door and then dipped two fingers in the holy water cistern on the wall, unsure how necessary it was to cross himself. He was an angel, after all. Almost overqualified to be here.
For a long moment they froze there in tableau—Dean staring at the dark, Cas staring at him, at the soft curve of his jaw and the set of his mouth and the pallor of his face in the wake of what he'd said.
And now Sam knew, and to Dean's surprise not a single thing had shifted. Sure, they were drowning in crazy, as usual, but that one thing between them all hadn't changed. Still brothers, still friends, and with one less secret weighing down the air in the Impala.
Dean hadn't seen; he was busy looking through his wallet for the least-suspicious fake card he had, and Sam came back in, setting off the little bell at the front. He looked a little sad, but Cas said nothing as he slid back into the booth.
So it was quite unexpected, as a new sunrise broke, when Dean walked into the crowded hallway in front of the borrowed bedroom he and Cas were sharing to see Olivia hobbling to the room at the top of the house, carrying a basket covered by a thick linen cloth in her bony arms. Baby slithered along the baseboard, ducking and twisting around furniture, guarding her mistress as usual.
“What a strange little religion it is,” she said quietly, mostly to herself, looking around her shop and smiling. “You know, even before Amos Porter preached here they had stories. Old stories.
“It’ll heal up,” Dean said dryly. “I’m tough. We’re tough.” Dean hushed him, kissing the side of his neck. “We’ll try again. We’ll just try again and it’ll be fine.”
“Nope,” Dean said. His eyes dropped to where Castiel's hand lay on his leg for a moment, and he worked his jaw, as if unsure what to do about it, and then his gaze moved back to the road.
“You know, you don’t have to cook for us,” Dean said, breaking the silence with what they'd all been thinking to begin with, and she turned and looked at him over her blue-inked shoulder.
Yann quickly began using his own hand to apply pressure, a deep scarlet blush rising up his neck and his face, his eyes huge.
Lapping like a friendly dog at his feet, urging, pulling, tugging the hem of his trousers, the fabric going dark where it touched with its wet hold. It slipped up the banks, sliding out of the channel, reaching for him.
No more cold sky, seeking arms, no more wide and wailing loneliness, no. He thought of the trembling of the songs in the heavens, the percussion crash of falling, clouds of blue smoke, bolted doors. Two strong arms that enfolded him, lips on his cheek that murmured
Dean laughed, and Cas laughed as well, and with easy limbs they held one another for a moment, kissed, breathed; retrieved their trousers from the floor, the loose wedding things, and helped each other dress, if only partway, buttoning buttons and smoothing fabric. The suspenders Sam had so carefully fitted into the small of Cas' back still dangled from his hems.
A small bayou bordered her house. The place was tall but a little tilted, brown wood siding weathered to a dull greyish color. Cypress trees and willows adorned in clinging moss crowded the lawn. A long serpentine dirt drive wound its way up to the front, lined by messy clumps of reedy grass and wild brambles.
"You're the trouble," she sighed, and she did not kiss him, but patted his face gently before she grabbed his chin, yanking it down to look into her dark eyes. "You behave yourself and I’ll do what I can for you. You make trouble? I make trouble.”
happy, and the mood was infectious. For the second time in the last few days Dean found himself relaxing into his stride, making himself take the time to appreciate the sun sinking in the sky above the big white farmhouse, the smell of the peaches, the laughter of the people around him. Cas' body leaning into his just the slightest bit.
“Then let's get married in a week or two,” he said, lightly, tilting his head back up to Dean, and Dean couldn't resist smiling back. “Let's get married, because we're sure of it, and because we're happy. And no other deprecations. And no more reasons. Not because of any—book, or myth, or story. Just because.”
Her arm untangled from his as she moved to enter the tent, awkwardly twisting away from him. Without thinking, Sam caught her hand as she pulled back; she froze and nearly tripped over her feet once they’d stopped moving.
There was a slant-eyed goat tethered around one side of the house, eyeing them as they went by, chewing mindlessly and twitching its tail, ears wagging to ward off the flies. There was a dull cluck of chickens coming from somewhere, and a cock crowed.
He shook out his shirt, the dull green plaid one that Sam had given him several states and months ago, and was about to pull it on when he felt Dean's arms wrap around his waist from behind.
“Pity about the fog,” she said, lightly, and Cas hummed in agreement. He finished drying a plate and set it down in its place on the countertop—he liked the rhythm of it, the action. It felt like a good thing to do with the mist lying heavy on the ground outside the screen door, blocking out the trees and the flowers.
They sat against the tree, and Dean's half-eaten peach rolled out of his grasp into the grass. His hand came to hover uncertainly at Castiel's jaw, fingertips just lightly ghosting over the stubble there. He couldn't tell if Cas' eyes were open or closed, and realized he didn't care. There was no passion in it, but not to its detriment—rather there was contentment, and something like relief, like letting out a breath that had been held too long.
As they were driving back in the dark towards the distant towering clutch of Ferris wheel lights, Sam asked, “So—I just have a few more questions.”
Dean closed his eyes against the hum of the bathroom light and the scent of Cas' skin, the weight of him in his arms.
“I’m telling you that if you want to figure out what’s going on you’re going to have to do a lot of the footwork yourself. Amos Porter’s body and all the rest of his shit was in one piece – fool died of smoke inhalation when the fire broke out on his deck of the ship, but the water put it out before it could destroy his room. Wherever that book is, it’s intact, but I can’t tell you where it is or if it can even be found. I got a sinkin’ suspicion that this all ain’t some coincidence, though. I've been callin' people up, asking around. You look up and down that river all you’ll find are a bunch of happy folks. Not a whisper of trouble in months from our side of the veil or the other. It's taken a while, but people are starting to notice it.”
. With the same rush of triumph he'd felt pulling Sandra Eadie's bone from the riverbed, he felt his arms latch around the angel's skinny chest, and he yanked, knocking Cas off his feet and kicking back, scrabbling for hold on Cas' suddenly awake and flailing body. Cas sputtered and jerked, his head knocking back into Dean's nose, abrupt and hard, and Dean let out a noise of pain.
“Jesus Christ,” Dean murmured, letting his hand fall from the angel's shoulder. He leaned back on his haunches and stared at the corner of the mattress. “Jesus Christ.”
“Ask me.” The whispered reply hovering against his mouth, but not touching it, waiting. “Ask me, and I will give it to you.”
“I almost wish we were butterflies and liv'd but three summer days. Three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain.”
It was much the same in the other nightstand—a Bible with near-pristine pages, spare change, the sort of thin nonfiction books given by parents at birthdays.
swagger in his brother's step, or something like it from the angel, but instead he was greeted with averted eyes and what looked like a frankly miserable Dean, and an entirely miserable Castiel.
” Bobby said. Dean could hear the loud noises of books being closed and slammed and moved on the other end. “But it looks like what the kid said is legit. I don't know how anybody missed all this crap.”
“Hmm,” Dean mumbled, opening up the trunk and glancing around to see if anyone was watching. “Well, when you live in the middle of nowhere this must be a big thing.”
Dean slid from the chair. His knees bit into the edge of the rug where it met the floor and he bowed his head, took the slender hands in his own. He bent over Cas’ lap. He kissed the skin of his hands, adoring it, mouthed a spot on one of his knuckles.
before. She blinked up at him, brow furrowing. A strand of her hair had fallen out of her ponytail during the drive and was caught in the corner of her mouth and he wanted to reach out and brush it away. Her eyes searched his face, fingers tightening on the strap of her purse. He sized up her small frame, the way her shoulders pinched inwards, like she was cramped.
Dean sat on the edge of the bed and held his head in his hands, and tried to breathe, tried to shake off the feeling of foreboding.
“At the end of the story,” Dean said, near-stammering but holding his ground, “it says—the star and the catfish become human. They get—married.”
Castiel focused on peeling the wet shirt from Dean's arms, the skin damp and cool and smooth. His fingers ghosted over his collarbone, the rounds of his shoulders, his arms, till he had worked the shirt off of him and picked up the other Olivia had set out.
He let him go; Dean pulled off his jeans there in the corner and then crawled under the covers in his boxers and shirt, waited for Cas to lie down beside him. They were pressed together back-to-chest, Cas' chin in the divot of Dean's shoulder, and Dean stared at the thin rectangle of starlight, the window on the wall.
“I'd have to look it up,” Sam said, shrugging. “Not too deep, I don't think. Could probably wade across this part of it if you were careful.”
“Yes, he does!” Sam insisted. “He does, Dean. What would you do? What if Mom was in the same situation? You wouldn’t abandon her. You’d do exactly what he’s doing!”
Sam swiveled his head and glared at Dean, who had untucked his gun from the back of his jeans. Dean returned the look but obliged, snapping the safety back on and putting the gun on the motel dinette. He showed his empty hands to the kid and crossed his arms.
Hopefully this was worth the wait. And thank you for all the comments, kudos, hits and everything else to support this fic :) and if you do want that smut scene, comment and i'll add it at the end of the fic :))
He leaned against the sink, where Dean had been sitting previously, and pulled out his phone, texting dean.
So Dean explained, pretty poorly with jokes that were not the best. Explained that he was bi, that during their time together in high school, cas was the first guy that he had to face that he had a crush on romantically, not a celebrity who he write off that he admired, not an older guy he could say he just idolised, nothing to get him out of the feelings, and he was 16 and didn't know how to deal with that, so he ran.
Dean seemed to squeeze tighter around Cas’ waist. Cas only snickered and slowly made his way out of the bed.
Dean looked up and saw a giggling cas, and attempted to politely make his way to him, everyone of the kids confused but intrigued as to why their youtube icon was making his way towards a teacher.
He just wanted to help his friend. Did he find Dean incredibly attractive with fanfiction green eyes and freckles, and yes he may have been harbouring a small crush.
‘This horror thriller shows thing about these two brothers hunting monsters and stuff, it’s pretty good.’
One of them said before spitting on the kids shoes and walked off with the rest of the ass hole group.
Cas couldn't help but giggle. Dean had always loved his fans, and was a big brother to, well, everyone, but he could get easily overwhelmed.
Dean said smiling to cas as he handed cas a travel mug of coffee and a brown paper bag with his favourite, PB&J and a few pastries from dean's favourite bakery, as well as fruit because cas cares about his health.
By the time cas had finished his tale, Dean had wrapped up his arms and gave him a towel to dry off a bit.
Sam said smiling before his expression changed from upbeat to as though he got smacked in the face with a crutch.
He pulled out his phone, ignoring the other notifications on his phone and texted sam, ‘your gonna have to walk home’.
Hopefully this is good, since its been a while since i have updated. And thank you too everyone who has supported this dumb fic, whether through comments, bookmarks, kudos etc. it means a lot :))
Dean went up to the door, only to open it to a drenched cas, with scratches along his face, pajama bottoms and shirt, trenchcoat torn slightly, little bits of blood dried into the bottom of the sleeves of the trenchcoat and a shivering ball of fur held costly to his chest.
It was a surprisingly calm Sunday seeing as the terrifying world of the internet could figure things out about Dean he didn't want them to know, yet.
“Hey everybody! So i bet most of you are wondering about the person who interjected during the last video with charlie.”
He decided it was best to pull back, get the cas away for a few days, just so Dean can clear his head, sort out his feelings.
Each time cas would text dean, sam would ask if that was the ‘mystery girl’ and every time dean would just laugh a little.
Cas left to go and get some sponges and cleaning supplies, leaving a mug of coffee on the kitchen counter for Dean when he finally dragged himself out of their bed.
He carried on about privacy, and a little about cas without revealing anything important that could identify who he was dating, so Cas slowly zoned the video out, smiling to himself. Until he heard meg.
Three dudes were mocking and kicking this lump of clothes on the floor is what it looked like, but dean knew there was derinatley some poor kid under there, and he reached a whole new level of anger when the douche on the far left crouched down and fucking spat in this kids face.
After his little vlog, he realized he needed to get dressed in a hurry. Leaving basically everything he would normally get, like his coffee...and lunch.
Cas was half way out the door, yelling goodbyes to dean before he was stopped by dean as he yelled for cas to wait and walked up to him.
He was about 10 seconds away from chasing the fuckers down until he felt his flannel being tugged lightly.
Every Sunday when dean and cas went out on their now scheduled ‘date night’, sam would make a snarky comment about dean having an actual girlfriend and all that.
Some students he loved to have in his class, like Alfie, then there were some that just decided to dig into his life just to get out of work, mainly a girl in his sophomore class named meg. She was actually very good but just didn't like to apply herself and was willing to say anything to get out of work.
Cas asked dean. Dating a well-known youtuber meant knowing that if you come back to your boyfriend and best friend in wigs doing ddr and singing with blow up microphones, it was a calm day.
He told cas about his dad, both how he was a homophobic asshole and how he came to bobby's that day, telling him and Sam to pack up and leave, and he did.
Dean said, smile wide and bright. It's then that cas releases that Dean was filming his coming out video.
Cas turned around, unravelling the blankets to allow Dean under them before cuddling against Dean's chest.
Though this only led to a war between the class on whether the ship name should be destiel or DeanCas or Destiel.
Cas walked into his home, took off his shoes and trenchcoat and loosened his tie and flopped on the couch where Dean was sitting curled up, editing on his laptop.
Bobby had practically adopted the boys, hell taught dean more about cars than his dad did. Of course the downfall with going to bobby's meant that dean actually had to go to school.
Cas returned to his classroom, lunch in hand. It wasn't until he was halfway through his PB&J that he realized what had happened, and that next period would not be fun.
Dean was made to travel across the country, he was barely able to make friends, let alone keep a relationship, and a long distance one at that.
Dean asked, he was honestly curious why cas wasn't in class, he looked like a geek sorta kid, Dean thought he’d be like Sam, so eager to go to school.
The visits were always few and far between now that John decided that Dean and Sam could be left in a different state from him now. Though Bobby hated John doing that.
Cas just looked over to dean. He looked ready to kill a bitch, yet cas couldn't help but find it cute, he looked like a cartoon character, his face turning a slightly red shade.
He didn't know what was wrong, he didn't know if he was the cause, if Dean needed a hand or a shoulder. And it scared him knowing Dean was going through something and he couldn't help.
Grumpily, dean was walking down the halls, hearing as his feet thudded against the linoleum, not caring or noticing where he was or his surroundings until he heard whimpers and fucking near evil laughter.
Meg asked. Cas was slightly terrified and didn't know what to say. He didn't want to tell a bunch of kids he fucks their favourite youtuber, and he didn't want to out dean. Thankfully Charlie came to the rescue.
Dean couldn't help but smile as cas sleepily kissed his jaw before snuggling in and slowly falling fast asleep, snoring lightly like the kitten currently resting in the living room.
Meg asked if he could put it on the board as they finished up revision questions for a test which was highly opposed to.
“Deans not out online yet and...i'm camera shy. Anyway, don't forget your filming with Dean tomorrow.”
Then he heard Dean, screaming profanities, then the metal clanking of someone being pushed against the lockers.
Working at the auto shop was actually pretty fun. The dudes there were pretty chill, lightly homophobic, but, survivable.
“Don't worry. If it helps, my entire sophomore class supports you, a little more than whole heartedly.”
School became weird. Dean tried to avoid cas as much as possible, but they shared most of their classes and Dean began not to sit with cas at lunch.
He had stayed out and not come home until the next morning plenty of times, so it was just confusing for Dean why Sam was freaked out this time.
‘And dean, sorry for assuming cas was a chick and all and uh, remember to keep the noise down, thin walls.’
They had a short lesson since cas could not put up with this and just gave them questions to answer then free time when they were done.
Meg obviously said. This left cas desperately trying not to laugh hysterically. This was one hell of a class.
He was tired, uncaffeinated, having to hear about his boyfriend in conspiracy theories and to top it all off, he would have to eat the school food for lunch since he had forgotten his.
Sam even convinced Dean to take some engineering night classes, as well as a few mechanic night classes.
20 minutes later, Dean heard a car outside. He pulled himself off the bed, and saw his dad talking to bobby outside in the front yard.
Bobby trusted dean, but he also new the boy could be a dumb as a doornail, so of course he checked the note.
The sheer devilish smirk on meg's face, and the blush on cas’ was more than enough to answer those questions.
Dean wasn't sure why he wanted to hide the fact he saw Castiel again, he was sure Sam had forgotten entirely about cas, but he didn't want to integrate these two parts of his life.
It was actually quite fun for cas until a history book got thrown and a window was nearly smashed. Though that was the day he realized that Kevin has a good throw.
Well in all honesty, it wasn't that surprising, he was probably passed out on a couch or in a ditch.
Then cas simply told dean that they were going to a place where he could tell cas why he up and left because, ‘a pretty vague note wasn't enough of a reason’ according to cas, and dean understood, he did, but God almighty he didn't want to sit down with cas and talk about emotions and the past.
“Fuck sake dean, I know you were out, but you always send one of those ridiculous texts with a winky face that make me want to kill you beofre you leave whatever bar. Jesus. Next time don't freak me out like that.”
It didn't last more than ten seconds until Dean pulled away. His face turned from calm and enjoy, to pure and utter fear.
“I-I didn’t want to leave on bad terms...and i wanted to admit it to myself, i wanted to know i wasn't crazy, that it did happen. I wanted the comfort and content i thought i would get from it...it wasn't the most successful, heh.”
Sam and Dean decided to move in together because dorms are already bad, but Sam was always concerned about Dean, and he knew for a fact he was sleeping in his car.
“Well, thank you mr singer.” cas said, voice quiet, but before he could  leave booby yelled him back.
When it was just Sam and Dean, Dean would just drop Sam off then relax until time to pick Sam back up. Now at bobby's though, he had to go to high school. Bobby really was like their dad, which meant he was serious about ‘education’ and other stuff responsible parents care about.
They decided to head to a local bar which also served food because that is a necessity for Dean Winchester.
Cas loved his job, when he had a good class. As it turns out, kids would rather vandalise the desks and scream than do any actual work.
It was a lovely morning, birds singing, sun shining, flowers blooming and best of all, a handsome shirtless man wrapped around cas’ waist like an adorable koala.
Then he saw Dean, sitting down at the tiny dining table they never used with candles and even in a suit.
Cas returned home and heard the chaos in the kitchen. He set the bag of supplies by the door and took his shoes off at the door, going to sit on the couch in the living room as Dean and Charlie made a mess in the kitchen.
He got home from the night class at roughly 11 that night. He came into the apartment, text cas about how cas wanted to be a beekeeper one day, or maybe volunteer to help one. Dean couldn't help but smile slightly down at his phone as cas rambled about the environmental importance of bees.
Dean pouted as cas giggled and kissed Dean's cheek then hooked his finger at the front collar of his uni jumper to expose Dean's neck.
Cas went into work the next day, smiling so wide, charlie noticed and he obviously told her. How could he not?
‘Yeah! He’s pretty good now, he was more dirty, and didn’t have any injuries I could see, but we should take him to the vet in the morning.’
Monday was slightly more frantic. Dean was awake a little after Cas came out his shower, which meant a good, real breakfast and coffee in a real mug instead of a travel one, but also a both somewhat tired but energetic dean, and a cas trying to remember where he placed his marked papers.
Bobby was confused, but Dean didn't reply when he asked what he was doing home so early, only mumbling under his breath that he needed to go to bed.
Cas didn't even know if Dean wanted to be friends anymore, if maybe all the rumours and gossip about cas had finally gotten to him.
When cas yawned, dean told him to head to bed, cas initially declined, but dean just told him to head to his room and what door it was and cas left, dragging his legs across the floor before he shut deans door.
The bell had rang minutes earlier, and now everyone was seated in their classrooms, well, besides cas.
“We’re engaged. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with him and I couldn't be happier. So cas and cas’ class that i know are watching this, come outside.”
Dean understood why cas was so adamant to get Dean to answer, it's one of those scenarios that you fantasise about, being able to get answers from people you are likely never to see again.
Maybe he just couldn't be friends with the openly gay kid, maybe he couldn't deal with the gossip or having to constantly protect cas, or maybe cas was just annoying.
So, here Dean Winchester was, walking down empty hallways, late after dropping Sam off. Truly not caring. His dad would come along soon enough and drag him and Sam away again.
Cas was already standing outside the buildings, in more casual clothes but still with the trench coat on.
They all continued to watch in silence until Dean began talking about his amazing lack of speeding tickets, which Sam immediately called out as false.
After a few hours of talking, dean steering away from the relationship talk and cas and sam following, knowing this wasn't something they could push dean to talk about.
Dean didn't like the quiet, it never helped his brain, so he turned on the TV and went on his phone.
When Cas returned with damp hair and in a borrowed pair of deans fluffy plaid pj bottoms, he was greeted by the intoxicating scent of bacon, eggs and toast.
It was quite relaxing though the damn thing looked like a damn pimp mobile and sometimes Dean just couldn't help but giggle at it and wonder who the hell has this car.
That's it, the end. If anyone wants an epilogue, leave a comment and i'll write one. But thank you to everyone who has left a kudos, bookmarked or anything to support this little fic :)
He went to his room and got Cas some sweatpants and his led zeppelin shirt. It was his favourite, and he wouldn't admit it but, he wanted to see cas in his clothes.
Siblings, favourite movies, music, pets. You know, boring stuff. Until Dean got slightly concerned when he looked over at cas, purple, blotchy bruises becoming visible on his face, and Dean knew the kid's torso would be so much worse.
Cas looked up to see a smiling dean leaning over the passenger side, and talking to cas through the window.
On a whim he left the kitchen, and mounted the stairs, taking each one slow and one at a time. He remembered pausing on the landing when they'd stayed here on the long journey, stopping to kiss Dean, back when everything had still been tainted wrong, and their intimacy still off-kilter. All of that blissfully smeared away, now, in the wake of the wedding.
There was a light on the front porch, its round roof spangled with thick green ivy coiled around the support beams and a few of the banisters, creeping to the stairs. The rest of the house was square; even, neat lines – flat faced with large windows and honey colored light spilling from them. The round attic window glinted with the last rays of the sun, peering down like a moon over the lawn.
Cas sighed, leaning back on the bench and tilting his head up to look at the mottled water-stained ceiling. “I just don't see how it
Dean and Cas found themselves caught in the foyer, Sam and Mattie having disappeared for the moment into the kitchen.
“Oh yeah,” Lily said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. She laughed, a little anxiously. “If you ask a Riverlander they'll tell you that the whole reason our orchard even grows is because we irrigate with river water, straight from the Mississippi. That that's the reason we've got such
“Ah, well,” she laughed, and shyly offered him her hand, fingers extended to show off the full extent of her palm. “You can always tell one by their hand!”
“There's Yann's article, but get this—that preacher Bobby was talking about? I found a reference to him from ages back. Says he was from Greenacre originally. That's where he started out, and then he left on the riverboat Bobby mentioned.
“Sounds like those birds,” Dean said. “Kingfishers or whatever.” He got up and pulled back the window drapes. Neither of the others could see out the window, and neither was inclined to get up to see a few birds that they'd been seeing all day anyway. “My God, they're loud.”
“Hey!” came the call, and Sam groaned. Dean stifled his laughter in Cas’ shoulder as they hovered by the car.
Sam and Cas elected to ignore his cynicism for the moment. The sigil on the floor seemed to waver and undulate briefly before it settled into the carpet, and to look at it now felt solid, concrete.
Dean took a trembling breath and focused on the page. Pushed them out. Pulled himself into an island of the sunset through the shades, and the chair, and the impossible weight of the book in his hands.
They agreed that they would and left, pushing open the glass door, the chime sounding over their heads.
They parted ways on the town square, which was bustling with Saturday-morning crowds, and promised to regroup a little after noon for lunch and to see what they'd gathered. The library was a ways across town, and Cas stood on a square corner watching the Impala vanish down the road for a moment before he put his hands in his pockets, as Dean liked to do, and chose a direction at random to walk.
This was just cracking the lid. No harm done. They’d have to open it up eventually, so maybe the controlled delay, a more calculated approach, was all that they had needed. If you could predict frenzy you could adjust. There could be someone to drive the car if you saw the cliff coming.
“I’ve heard of him, yes,” Cas said softly from the passenger seat, squeezing Dean’s hand where it rested on the inside of his thigh, fingers curled to fit against the curve of his leg. “Considered the biggest threat to providence of the twentieth century, I believe.”
“You boys make sure you get your photo taken for the wall!” Nate reminded them, his strong tanned arm around Sugar’s shoulders.
"They need me to go down there and get some gas for one of the generators - just down there in that shed at the bottom of the hill."
“All our shit’s still in the car…” Dean breathed against his mouth, and Cas shook the haze off – he hadn’t realized they’d been kissing again, that Dean’s back was shoved into that scroll of the bannister. That their hands had wandered and snaked around jackets and wormed past the layers to skin.
"Love can do plenty," she said, after a minute. "Makes big peaches. Makes me miss you so desperate some days I think I'm drowning. It turned a catfish into a man, didn't it? If you're lookin' out for those stories." She laughed lightly.
Needed to be in and surrounding each other, indistinguishable. It was too cold to be apart, it seemed, even for a little. Magically, it seemed, every instance of their touch felt new.
“Look—it's not exactly a point of pride. People don't talk about it much because—well, the people who picked up what Porter was teaching, they took it
“Thank you for staying with us,” he said, his voice even and slow and deeper than one would have anticipated coming someone so willowy. “You’ve made my Sugar so happy,” he continued. His sweet hound-dog eyes lit on Cas. “She loves having guests in the house and waitin’ on em’ and all that.”
When asked if he would like to try himself, he declined, sanding down a rough corner on what would eventually take form as a windowsill instead. He was content to do the monotonous little task while the others milled around him. It was nice to feel useful in a small way. Unobtrusive.
“Sugar!” Someone called her name and she excused herself, trotting to the stage that was being assembled a few feet away. Nate glanced fondly at the three hunters in her absence, his kind eyes shifting over each of them in turn.
"What's happening?" Cas asked, concerned, appearing at his side. Sam was ducking in too, and Dean just gestured at the open pantry where the woman had gone, brandishing the broom like a weapon. His mouth was an open shape of confusion.
He hummed in agreement and thanked the coroner for his time, walking quickly out of the morgue and into the adjacent hallway. He leaned against the wall and rubbed his face tiredly, wincing and rubbing the bruise on his neck.
The harsh asphalt of the parking lot stung Dean's bare feet but he pounded across it anyway, the night chill on his arms; he heard Sam tumble out of the room after him and they ran toward the water, towards the faint dirt path that led down to the water from the top of the levee separating the parking lot from the current.
Breathing the first real fresh air he'd breathed in months, Chuck found an empty bench and took a seat, hands in his pockets. He wished he'd brought something to read so as not to look awkward, but the sun was high and cool, and he settled for watching birds fight over a few crumbs on the sidewalk, and squirrels dart from tree to tree a little ways off.
He didn’t understand why it kept falling apart. Why he was always left lying there, unsure of where it had gone wrong exactly and confused as to how it had ended up hurting so bad.
The Byrne place was a farmhouse, nestled in its own little copse of trees, small and cool-colored and inviting. Two trucks in the drive, one more weathered than the other, a screened-in porch. Not too far off in the distance Dean could see the Mississippi, a glittering silver snake under the sun of late afternoon. He wondered if the house was ever in any danger, when it flooded. He wondered vaguely if it would ever flood again in Galilee.
“But not for a while yet,” Sam said, “I hope.” He thought of the orchard in Wisconsin, for an instant.
“Yeah, unless she's some kind of—I don't know—bird demon thing,” Dean said, flailing aimlessly for an excuse. “Or some other monster.”
“Come on,” Dean said, interrupting Cas’ listening. Cas turned his head to him, but found Dean had stood and was holding out his hand. He waved it a little and Cas’ eyebrows crawled together.
"Catfish are mud animals," she said, so quietly he had to strain to hear. As if she were reading out of a textbook, her voice low and thin. "Dirty things. Bottom feeders, Sam. They eat the dead. They scavenge and pick off the bones at the bottom."
“I told you I've kept track,” he said, cradling it in his arm, opening it against the crook of his elbow. Sam and Dean took steps forward and Cas pulled himself upright again, leaning on his bad leg with a wince. They crowded around Yann as his skeletal fingers danced over the leaves of paper.
It came out as such a strange sound, caught between a whisper and a sob and something worse than that, if such a thing existed. Something worse. Something quiet.
“What can start you with? Drinks? We, well—it isn’t quite happy hour but I will give you those prices if you would like something like that? We have very good margaritas.” She paused, getting ahead of herself and let the pad rest against her thigh. “I’m Rosa, by the way, and I’m talking too fast again.”
They left Marlene's after an hour or two of conversation—steering often away from the actual topic of the evening and into the realms of inconsequentials—and then mutually agreed to head back to the festival to meet up with what Lily called Sam's “workplace liability.” She'd given him much more than he'd bargained for: what must have been the complete history of the orchard, and most of her own history as well. Sam thought that maybe she'd just needed an ear to vent to; as soon as she'd warmed up to him she'd spilled almost everything.
“Ready to head out, gents?” David asked, looking up at the others; in near-unison they nodded, Sam pushing his hand into the pocket with the receipt. They tipped their heads in inclination to Megan Sohre as they showed themselves out, and into the falling dusk, and the river babbling a little ways off.
“Sometimes we get some rabble rousers. Wanna come up and start trouble. Drunk kids too stupid to know better, but they’ve put some bad graffiti in the washroom a few times and one time they scared Peg pretty bad. Told her to go down to the river and drown herself in if she was so inclined...” He trailed away. “Anyway, just bad talk, and she don’t mean any harm really. Just protective.”
They spotted Cas hovering anxiously on a street corner on the square, watching for them, and he dawdled there a moment longer while Dean found a place to park. The angel had his hands in his pockets and kept glancing up at the sign over Byrne's Birdhouse.
He paused for a long time, biting the inside of his lip, acutely aware of Castiel's hand on him, the nearness of him.
“She had stars in her hands,” Cas whispered. His hand rose to hover over Dean's sternum, his fingers gently drifting down the plane of the hunter's chest, tracing the last of the water as it came down in droplets across his skin. “Promise.”
Construction on the highway had cleared up enough by the time they reached it, after the slow crawl down from the ridge, that they managed to be out of Elsbrook just as another storm was broiling on the horizon up ahead. The long stretch of asphalt was near-deserted in both directions, and Cas had rolled the back seat windows down, and cool electrified air was rippling in as they sped down through hills toward the clouds.
Cas marveled at the handiwork. "This is a masterpiece," he breathed, examining it in closer detail. "How long has this taken you?"
Dean flushed, and Cas lifted his chin slightly, giving him a sideways glance, appraising the very feature the sheriff had cited.
“It’s not what it looks like,” Dean said swiftly, stepping protectively in front of his younger brother.
A sizable portion of Mathilda's money made its way to Memphis, Tennessee, to arrive in the mail slot of one surnameless Celeste, along with the small and heavy Riverlands Hymnal, with the simple instructions:
That December the petals had never fallen. They froze, suspended in ice for weeks, but with the thaw they shook themselves out in all their splendor, the air fragrant with their scent, and the whole town had marveled.
Sam and Dean's first interaction with Sugar Byrne lasted approximately three minutes. They went inside, she bustled out to meet them, shook their hands—Sam caught sight of the star in her palm and fixed his eyes on it for the rest of the conversation—told them her address, which Dean jotted down in his phone after a moment of confusion, and then shooed them off, chirping about having to close up shop for the afternoon soon. They were hustled out of the store and found themselves right back on the sidewalk, Dean and Sam in something of a daze, Cas chewing on the inside of his lip.
“You’ll flood everything,” Rosa wept. “Don’t let your heart be so heavy! You’ll turn into a catfish all over again!”
Another nervous shuffle. Sam nodded, smiled faintly. Mattie ducked her head in agreement and gave them a little flutter of her hand, and hobbled off down the hallway into the dark.
“Are they tearing it up?” Dean asked, trying to see around an eighteen-wheeler attempting to merge. His younger brother nodded, making an exasperated sound. He could hear the distant whirr and clank of back hoes and rubbed his damp forehead, creeping along with the cars ahead and in front of him.
Her eyes were imploring and devoted, and they listened attentively, like children to a Sunday school minister, or siblings to a mother, and she met all their gazes in turn, all her excited demeanor gone. She was sincere, now. Sincere and strange at the table with them.
“You go, then,” Dean tells him. “They’re still your brothers and sisters. Sam and I will be alright, I promise.”
“A failure in my heart valves?” he asks, not able to put any other disease onto it other than maybe an infection.
Realization dawns in on Sam, and suddenly he feels like he’s running out of time. There’s only one way to open up that gate, and they lost it while trying to face off Lucifer for the first time.
“I still need a first name, though,” Michaels asks dryly while still typing words down. Dean licks his lips, considering ‘Cas’ to keep it simple. But right at the moment that he starts to talk, Castiel’s full name comes out of his lips. Michaels raises his eyebrows again, silently mocking the name. Dean glares at him, so the man just raises his hands lightly in surrender. He continues typing.
“And I suppose that is the problem right there; what we consider a healthy weight gain, people in your condition see as ‘getting fat again’. It’s not always outspoken, but it’s always there, and it’s not easy to let go of.”
“Hey, let me see that paper?” suddenly comes from next to him, and Dean looks up to find Sam reaching his hand to Kevin. The Prophet silently puts down the paper of today into the palm of his hand before returning to his drink and his conversation with Lauren.
They eat a quick breakfast before Dean announces that they’re leaving for the airport. The entire drive, both men remain quiet, instead just listening to one of Dean’s tapes currently playing on the Impala’s radio. Castiel simply stares outside the entire time, in his head going through all possible scenario’s in which this evening can get extremely out of hand.
“That’s a lot of people,” Dean repeats. There are a few skaters on the ice, getting warmed up. Dean has no idea what Cas would be wearing this time, so he wouldn’t know where to begin looking. He takes a deep breath while listening to the commentators talk on and on about the next few contestants.
“Uh,” is all that can escape Dean’s mouth and he drops the DVD’s back into the drawer. “I really need to get back to the hotel,” he says, because how can he stay here when he’s had fantasies about this woman well before they met?
Sam gets annoyed by the many amount of suits that Dean has made this last year. Dean can understand – it’s his way of coping with being alone again after a relationship that lasted one year and six months. That, of course along with the many random hookups he’s been having with some lovely ladies once or twice in a week.
“Dean? Did you go outside? I thought I heard the door close?” suddenly comes from the other room, and then Lauren emerges from the hallway already wearing her sleeping clothes. When she sees Claire standing there a little further away from Dean, her mouth drops open and her eyes go wide.
Dean once again nods, but Cas only frowns for a moment. He’s probably wondering how the computer will receive the waves in the first place.
In this universe, Castiel was supposed to be the Avatar. He's really strong and learned the elements very quickly, but in the end got overconfident and made a big mistake. With that, he decided to hide his identity and became a 'masked' Avatar. Years later, Dean got stuck into a dangerous criminal plot that he tries to solve on his own, but an accident from the past prevents him from bending his element, meaning that he's relieved from the Metalbending force. Due to the Avatar being too late on the scene back then, Dean resents him from it. He and Cas were supposed to start working together to find out what's wrong, but eventually Dean would realize who he really was and drama would ensue.
Cas seems to have realized that it mustn’t be too good. When he leans forward and grabs Dean’s cell out of his hands, Dean doesn’t protest, instead just punching Jimmy hard in the arm.
And skating with Jimmy or alone gives him confidence. Skating in front of the kids inspires him to show them how it's done - and if he didn't already have two jobs, he could have accepted the position as an instructor. But, the moment he's being judged by people qualified for it, a flip is switched. The whole reason why didn't want others to know about his dream to compete is exactly this; this is where Dean is at his weakest.
Dean takes a moment to get back into the car, hiding the knife from other people’s view. With hasty steps he gets back into the car, breathing out loudly the moment he sits down. He doesn’t speak, though, only shaking his head when Sam throws him a questioning look.
After that, the messages stop, and Sam finally looks up to find Lauren pointing her fork towards him, trying to get him to taste a piece of her pie. Without complaining about being fed like a baby, he opens his mouth and allows her to feed him.
“Talking about brothers, have you talked to yours already?” Dean asks. He catches Balthazar’s eyes go wide right before the Angel tries to hide it away again. Just for a few milliseconds, he seems to be frozen on the spot. “I suppose you haven’t?”
Castiel knows the piece; it’s a toccata by Bach, played by organ and usually used in amateur horror-movies. Every organ-player has played this song in their life, but hearing it on a Marimba was a whole other thing.
“What is the Prophecy?” he asks. He might as well get all the information he needs out of her. The Angel – damn, he really needs to find out her name – sighs loudly and drops herself in the chair in front of where Sam is sitting.
“Hi Cas,” Dean greets the other skater, taken aback when he suddenly has two strong arms wrapped around him in a strong hug. So Cas is the greet-and-hugging-type. Great to know.
“I don’t know, you seem pretty old,” Claire jokes. Dean loses his smile instantly and throws her one of his own bitch-face that even Sam’s can’t measure up to.
Tracy holds the keys of both rooms in the air, telling him that she still needs to check out. Sam reaches behind him in his back pocket, taking out his wallet in search for his fake credit card.
“We’ll find a way,” Castiel says when Dean turns around again. They press their foreheads together for a little while, for a moment seeking comfort and inspiration from each other.
“I, for one, think they’re good together,” Ellen says. “Even though I lost my best barman because of it, Castiel
Dean doesn’t even move when Cas leans his head forward. He doesn’t move when he feels Cas’ breath touching his skin. He doesn’t move when Cas’ lips gently pass over Dean’s, instead just opening his mouth automatically to start the actual kiss.
“Dean,” Jimmy then finally starts, but then he shuts his mouth again. He takes a few breaths while he seems to think things over. “What are your intentions towards my brother?”
When Dean wakes up again, it’s with Cas spooned up behind him, pressing soft kisses on the back of his neck. Dean puts his hand on the Angel’s cheek, and for a few minutes they just lazily make out. Nothing more comes out of it, but it isn’t necessary for them.
“It’s been a while, hasn’t it?” he asks, and there’s something in his voice Castiel can’t tell. It’s like he’s aware of something Castiel has no idea of. Carefully, he hums in agreement, slowly turning towards the direction of the check-out to indicate that he needs to leave. Or wants to leave. He doesn’t really care how Marv takes it; he’s never really liked that guy, after all.
Loud applause fills the room even more than before. Cas smiles widely, standing there where he’s dreamt of being for almost all of his life. Behind him, Dean can hear Jimmy shouting it out in happiness. It gives Dean another boost of reassurance.
In the end, the other man returned from where-ever he went, and before Dean can really pull back from Sam he, too, is holding her in another tight hug.
Dean is hovering on top of the Angel, ignoring the hands that try to push him away as he runs his tongue over every part of Castiel’s face. The best part is, by the lack of having a tail, Dean instead is swinging around his butt.
And then he’s back on earth, right in the kitchen of the Men of Letters headquarter, where Sam is sitting at the table eating breakfast. Crowley is sitting there as well, slowly sipping on a cup of tea. When he notices Castiel, though, he swallows his drink wrong and starts coughing in panic. Castiel ignores him, he’ll live.
“You see, she agreed to heal the family members, on the condition that the whole family would swear loyalty to our Father, and follow the Ten Commandments. She was, back then, the most successful of them all.
“I can’t ask that of you, Dean,” Castiel tells him, grabbing the hunter’s hand and lifting it up to his lips to press a soft kiss on it. “I love you, no matter what. You don’t need to do something you don’t want to.” And Castiel leaves it at that. There’s no need to bring up this conversation every time one of them feels a little sad about the lack of kids in their lives. He can see on Dean’s face that he, too, has given up on the subject.
When Lauren finds the person who spoke out to her, she’s surprised at what she finds; There’s a woman, about her age, with short light brown hair. The way the sun is shining over her, it seems like her hair has a soft golden glow on it.
“You can shut up, so I can ask the questions here,” Sam tells him dryly. Castiel can see him walk closer to him, suddenly kneeling down to, apparently, tightening the chain around him a little bit. “Your mission here is to provide information,” Sam adds.
“That sucks,” Dean mutters, sagging his shoulders a bit. He indicates for Cas that he can ask his two questions, and the other man seems to be thinking then. He leans back in his seat, puts a hand on his chin, and makes a pensive sound.
“Yeah, children are okay,” Jimmy said, a little bit distracted for a moment, looking at some picture on the wall. Dean followed his gaze, and saw a family portrait – or well, more a brother-portrait. Jimmy seemed a little bit sad, as if he were remembering something from the past.
Sam tries to collect all of his force to grab his shotgun again. He can’t find himself to stand up, so he has to crawl. Tracy makes struggling sounds, and Sam knows when she’s reached the branch. Especially from her screams getting louder.
because they’ve been able to do that perfectly with Cas around in the past. Sure, it sometimes makes Sam feel like a third wheel, but never have the two managed to make Sam completely uncomfortable on purpose…. Without the intention of teasing, of course, because Dean is still a little child sometimes.
“Don’t worry, babe, just teasing him,” Dean says. Underneath the table, he squeezes the Angel’s hand quickly before starting to eat. “It’s what big brother’s do, making the younger sibling feel uncomfortable.”
Eventually, because of Dean setting his phone to get local alerts, they are made aware that there has been another murder in a local gas’n’Sip. When they get there it’s quite a messed up sight, too. The officers explain them that the murderer – a man they’ve failed to identify so far – actually licked up his victim’s blood off the floor. So, this thirst is a real recurring theme they should really look at more closely.
Frank lightly waves at her, but doesn’t speak, instead choosing to look back down to the magazine. He probably just doesn’t want to get mixed up with Dean’s sudden appearance. How does she even get herself in these situations all the time?
“Yeah, this is Cas,” Dean offers as explanation, not really wanting to explain the whole Angel business just yet. He finds Castiel’s troubled expression over meeting someone new quite hilarious, but Sam seems to decide that he shouldn’t suffer for long.
When Dean drops Jimmy off at his house, Amelia helps him with bringing the guy back into the bedroom. She gives Dean a short kiss on his cheek and thanks him for bringing him back home safely. After that, only Cas remains, having dropped Don and Lucas earlier on their way to Jimmy’s.
It’s better not to say anything else. Dean gives Cas a long, apologizing look. Castil appreciates it, he really does, but it doesn’t help anything in this case. No words, no deed can every undo what pain Castiel has caused to the Novaks.
Castiel can’t seem to find his words. Something’s keeping him from talking, and he wonders if that thick feeling in his throat has something to do with it. He tries to swallow it away, but that doesn’t work. How is the best way to explain to this girl that her father is gone? For good?
Azrael frowns then, which looks strange on her stony face. She has her arms crossed over the desk while she leans forward a little bit.
“What’s the purpose of that?” he asks after finding nothing, except that the skin is reddening a little bit. It tingles a little bit as well, but it’s not unbearable.
The silence in the car is surprisingly pleasant. He shares a few looks with Jo, always smiling at her each time their eyes meet. He can slightly see Anna busy on her phone. The music playing in the background is old, but also kind of fitting for Bobby.
Castiel greets Ellen and Jo, brings his bike into the garage where he folds it back out, and then head to the kitchen to help out with dinner. Looks like it’s lasagna for tonight, which is alright for him.
But, Gabriel is involved in this as well, quite obviously the next one in charge about it. He has the power to bend reality at his will, so did he do something? What did he force upon them?
“C, we should head back, don’t you think?” Charlie asks. Castiel grunts, leaning his head against her shoulder. “Jesus, you smell like liquor! I can’t take you home like this!”
He reaches out for the black book after holding up the key next to it to compare the two. Yup, exactly the same. Dean doesn’t hesitate for any moment longer and reaches out for it. Maybe inside there might be a clue or anything that explains what that key is for.
Sam pushes his hair out of his face when he gets out of the car, which is probably why he only sees the black Impala neatly parked in front of his room right before he gets to the door. At first there’s confusion, because the Impala is supposed to still be in the bunker, which could only mean one thing. Sam just wishes he could dismiss that thought; surely Dean wouldn’t be foolish enough to actually drive here after they agreed he should stay back home, right?
“Sam!” someone calls out in the background. Sam knows that voice; that’s his brother! What is Dean doing there? Is he hallucinating? With trouble, Sam opens his eyes again everything seems blurry for a while. All he sees is a smudge of darkened beige, only lightened by the flashlight that coincidentally is still lying next to him.
