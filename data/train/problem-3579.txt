Dean froze, fear choking him. He knew what would happen next. He’d hurt Cas in every way possible, and now he was going to lose him. Again.
Cas could feel the blood trickle down his temple almost before he felt the insertion. He groaned as his head seared with pain.
“You let your fears rule you. You were so afraid I’d leave, that it was easier to make me!” Cas yelled. “I didn’t leave you, Dean! You left me.”
Cas grimaced, rubbing his forehead with both sets of fingers, trying to summon more. Was Rebecca there with him?
“It’s nothing. We just haven’t heard from him in a bit.” He couldn’t help the way his tone got sharper when he finished with “Usually means he’s up to something stupid.”
The silence chipped away at the thinning ground beneath them. Dean could feel Cas slipping before he even heard the words:
He battled the way he could feel himself slipping. He picked up the pen, screwing his eyes shut and holding a fist to his forehead as he dug deep, grasping for words.
“You do realize telling me not to worry pretty much guarantees I’m gonna worry? I started this conversation with two options: either you dreamjacked me, or the bottle of Jack I drank jacked my dream. Now I’m getting the feeling there’s some third, somehow more confusing option, so please, share with the class.”
He swallows visibly, sighs and groans at his own words. “But not tonight; there’s no point in that anymore. For now, I want you to to do this.” Castiel’s hands, the one resting over Dean’s, gently curls around it and pulls it away, turns it around in his grip and grasps into the gaps between his fingers, filling them with his own, palm to palm. Only then does he pulls their interlocked hands down towards their stomachs and between them, where their crotches meet.
Castiel’s breath is hot where it hits Dean’s shoulder, and it has Dean turning his head to look at him, and the sight he is treated to has him sucking in some air. Because Castiel is all ruffled and sweaty, his cheeks flushed and forehead shiny, shirt clinging to his skin and his almost unrecognizably dark eyes fixed on Dean, and Dean alone. It’s glorious to know that Dean is the one who put that wild look into Castiel’s eyes -- not for the first time, hopefully not for the last. And by doing nothing more than giving in to what both of them wanted to, by giving himself over into Castiel’s capable hands.
Dean swallows, and he’s sure that the sudden hotness he feels creeping up on him must be visible all over his skin.
Dean’s eyes flew open and he shot up in bed. He blinked rapidly, one hand fisting his shirt in front of his heart to calm the ripple of sharp breaths.
” he mouthed, not allowing himself to pray out loud. He breathed, his mind coming back to the same questions:
He cupped Dean's cheek, and for the first time, he could see Cas's unspoken words; Let me save you from yourself.
This whole thing could mean something, but he might just also be about to admit to Cas that, what? He’d started popping up in his dreams? Talk about creepy. If it wasn’t Cas reaching out, this could get really awkward.
Dean watched in horror, the man's screams tarring up his ears, drowning out Cas's reassuring voice and touch.
Dean’s heart beat faster. He looked from Cas to Naomi, letting Cas’s accusation sink in. Naomi’s hands twitched at her side. She squared her jaw and shoulders in turn.
His words ricocheted off the ceiling and echoed through the small space. The angles and cut of the room seemed slightly skewed, even if he couldn’t place how. Dean blinked. The floor swirled as if adrift on water and any misstep would send him floating.
Cas knew he was starting to lose himself, and it surprised him when at one point, even Crowley began to hesitate.
The air churned in measured pulses as he walked, thumping from somewhere deep and far away. Pebbles jammed themselves between his naked toes, the white clouds crawling away from him as he broke them apart.
Dean hesitated. The fire around him burned hot still, the memory fresh as if it were five minutes ago, not decades.
Colors swirled in the light, and he felt the comfort of Cas beside him, the kind of peace he’d never known before. It was as if the emotions were snatched from forgotten corners of his soul, things he didn't even know were there. Memories, sharp and bright, glowing in the emptiness like lit candles.
When Cas spoke it was soft and slow. Each new phrase was coded with emotional force. Dean’s dream delirium had slightly returned, and he struggled to process the words. They floated through him out of order and out of context, like broken puzzle pieces falling into his mind.
Cas’s chin fell, his eyes shut so tight as if to block out every bit of light inside the room behind tense folds.
He swam in thick black fog with little to orient himself; Cas wasn’t in the warehouse anymore, instead he was shrouded in nothingness. After a moment, the darkness started to clear. Out of it, a flash of red light grew in front of his eyes. Slowly, he saw other colors floating and coalescing like a melting watercolor painting.
Cas opened his eyes to the fog. It wrapped around him in humid tendrils so thick that his limbs disappeared beneath. He was in one of Dean’s shirts, bare feet against the cold, uneven ground. The clothes smelled heady and leather-- the faint whiff of whiskey.
His eyes remained closed but he could hear the groan of the forest around him against the wind. He’d just needed a quiet space to think, and the lonely Taiga had seemed like a good choice.
Dean could barely breathe. Cas was doing this to him. Again. He raised his hands in the air, anger growing, except once he’d captured Cas’s heavy stare he was hit with earnest, wordless pleading.
“I knew you’d need a reason to come back,” she said, voice neutral. “I’d seen it, I knew he’d never let you go unless it was for your own good. And you would never leave him, unless he made you. So do it.”
His toes dangled over the chasm, still. The waters raged below, and he felt the answer deep inside him:
Cas’s eyes were shut, his chest moving, but barely, as Dean unbuttoned his shirt, mincing the corner of his trenchcoat into the wound. He bit his lip with enough force to pierce the tender flesh.
Time was frozen around them, only their ethereal bodies movable in a dimension of stillness. Cas’s sleeping body looked tranquil. Peaceful. Then, Dean glanced at the phantom specter of Cas standing beside him. He watched their comatose forms, too, expression cold. Seething.
“Of course I came,” he said, the words rolling deep in his chest with a certainty he didn’t even know he possessed.
Rebecca’s breaths, ragged and disjoined above Dean began to slow into the pervasive tension that overtook the entire room: waiting.
Frustrated, Cas opened his eyes. He felt irritation growing within himself as Dean’s story replayed in his mind. He wasn't going to get anywhere like this.
He felt Cas’s hands slide away from him first, exposing him to the cool of the room, then found his eyes. They glanced only briefly at each other before looking away, Dean extracating himself from Cas’s chest.
Cas shook, trembling deep as the words claimed him, the sound of the angels becoming a distant buzz in the back of his mind.
“Look, I know it sounds insane, but this was more than just a dream.” Dean started talking with his hands, getting more animated. “It was, I dunno. . . real somehow. Whatever it is, it’s messed up. I just need someone to have a little faith in me when I say something is not right here.”
His voice, like still waters, the familiar warm tug of yearning specific to Dean, gripping him tight. Raising him.
Somewhere in the distance, Dean thought he heard the sound of water. Slowly, he let his forehead press against his--one last attempt to pull them together before the totality of space overtook them. His tears dripped down, sliding into the crease of Cas’s eyelids before escaping and becoming his own.
Dean waited, the floor starting to feel unsteady beneath him. He studied the way Cas’s fingers twitched and flexed like he was calculating. Crossing his arms, Dean pursed his lips while angling a cool eyebrow.
My betas mean everything to me. Thank you for the love and support thoughout this entire fic. A special shout out to Ana (sinnabonka) who has helped me raise this story like a co-parent with more love than I could have ever imagined. You are a queen.

For the first time, Cas began to glance in Dean’s direction, gaze landing on his shoes, as if that were the furthest he could go--the most of Dean he could acknowledge, stopping at the tips of his boots.
Cas accidentally hit the power button and everything went dark. Dean shook his head. “Give it here,” he said, rolling his eyes. He tapped on the screen quickly while Cas frowned.
Cas’s anger ripped up the edges of his words making them jagged. Dean opened his mouth to speak. Cas cut him off.
Unconscious, even Dean had to admit how fragile and small she seemed. Her face which was usually taught and creased with lines, lay smooth and soft; her chest rising and falling in shallow breaths. Her hair scattered around her head looking, ironically, like a carefree halo.
Crowley looped Cas’s head with the metal band and reached one hand up to a screw. Cas heard the slow screech as Crowely turned it closer towards his forehead. He held his breath in anticipation.
He glanced at his arm, noting the scar. His sleeve had fallen over it again, but he could see the imprint shining through the fabric, glowing brighter as they descended.
Cas felt his tears fall unbidden--salted wounds. His lungs gaped with scratchy breaths. He felt as if the sensations were an attempt to rip him apart from the inside. Dean’s voice above and inside him, the angels below. He stared deep into the water, understanding beginning to find him:
Turning back to the sentence, Dean reread the words, folding forward as he clutched his stomach. He pushed the paper to the top of the desk, hands searching for whiskey, lips sealing across the mouth of the bottle in desperation as he closed his eyes.
Not long after that trumpets sounded. The boxes for nobles were across the way, and all but the biggest of them in the center were filled. Now the curtains opened and members of the king’s guard marched out, followed by the king himself. The crowd roared its approval, and for minutes on end Metatron waved. As he did so, an entire line of Reapers—a whole dozen, a number unheard of in recent years—came in after him, and sat in a row, hooded in their black cloaks and looking like crows lined up on a wall. Then the king sat, and the applause died down.
The king barely spared a glance at Bobby; his focus was completely on the horse. After a moment of staring, he slowly walked around the stallion, hands behind his back, the silver and gold brocade of his doublet shining in the daylight. As he came around the far side of the horse, he passed very close to Sam and Dean without paying them any heed, his sharp light eyes roving sharply over every inch of the stallion’s form. In that look Dean finally saw a hint of the powerful mage he had to be to inherit the crown. A cloud of perfume pulled past their noses in his wake.
The Reaper studied them for a moment longer, still stroking her steed. “The both of you are fools,” she said at last, “and understand less of what’s going on that I do.”
“How can you be so sure?” Sam asked, giving voice to his fears in a rush now that the floodgate had opened. “He did something to me, I know he did. I didn’t imagine it and Dean agrees he put a spell on me. And yeah it was the worst night of my life, but I have these dreams…and they’re different from when I dream about my parents. They’re these horrible, vivid nightmares, and half the time I’m just watching but other times it’s like…I’m a part of them.” He stared at his hands, their calloused palms, and tried to forget what it felt like to crush a skull between them.
Gadreel did not come to Horsetown the day after the festival. It was just as well; Angel was allowed to get some real sleep, and he ate his fill whenever his eyes weren’t closed. Sam and Dean were mostly involved in the clean up and reacclimating everyone to their daily routine. Dean told no one of the king’s offer, and he had hope that it wouldn’t come up again. Surely the monarch had more important things to worry about than a lowly groom, and there was no way that Gadreel could so easily be cast aside.
“But fairness should not just be discussed when it comes to rewards,” the king continued. “It must also be present when discussing punishment. Bring forth Horsemaster Gadreel.”
Dean chose his own patch of grass nearby, close enough to be companionable but far enough that he wouldn’t accidentally get kicked as they slept. He plumped up his pack as best he could, wrapped an arm around it, then laid his head to rest. “Night, Cas,” he murmured, and fell asleep with the horse’s rumbling response in his ears.
Roaring again, he launched into a gallop and leapt into the air. He soared in an arc around the room, circling Metatron so he didn’t have anywhere to turn.
Still to the top of the butte the horse walked, through streets lined with great estates with high walls that wished to keep others out. Hired guards there were wary less of steed and his weaponless rider, than the swell of people who walked behind them. Carriages were forced to a standstill, and litters—newly brought into fashion by the current king—had to be set down entirely. But no one complained once their jeweled hands drew back the curtains shading them from the outside world. The noble residents of these great houses, whose views from Mt. Heaven onto the lower city and the surrounding lands were unsurpassed in scope, could not quite remember ever having seen a sight so strange and wondrous as a royal steed ridden by a boy as poor as he so clearly was, as if he had the right. Those who were knights, and knew of the strife between the groom, the horsemaster, and the king, ordered their conveyances to be turned, and they followed.
Sam broke off from Dean and Impala anyway as they passed it, and without any prompting Impala slowed her walk. The Banes and Bobby were the only people rich enough in Horsetown to have a personal book collection, and Sam shamelessly borrowed them whenever he could, though by now he'd probably read them all a hundred times apiece. Dean had read most of them a few time himself.
Bobby felt that pang in his heart all over again. “You must be used to taking care of yourself, and your brother,” he said, treading as lightly as he knew how.
"Now don't start the storytelling before I'm ready," Rowena called from the other side of the room, where she was bustling about, taking things from cupboards. One had jars of what looked distinctly like small, dead animals suspended in different colored liquids.
When Rowena and Crowley turned their interested gazes onto him, Dean kept his eyes trained on the horse. While Sam told their story, even his regard began to carry too much weight, so Dean turned back to his tea, and he ate. When his brother reached the point about the Lasso spell, he felt the latest scone turn to dust in his mouth. He ached for Impala. It wasn’t right that he was warm and fed and safe, and she was likely suffering the cold and cruel treatment of her captors.
So Sam and Dean skipped past the food stalls and other vendors, treating the day like business instead of pleasure. Dean still took the time to braid pretty orange and red ribbons into Impala’s mane and tail when they found her (or really, when she found them), and he smiled wide when they began their trick riding performance on the outskirts of the festival. They bowed, they flourished, they stood on Impala’s back as she cantered in a wide circle, and then again on their hands; they flipped and switched positions; they balanced on her spine and swung under her belly at full gallop. But not even his Baby could make Dean forget about Angel, and though they could do the routine several times without tiring, by mutual agreement the brothers stopped before midday.
“Tall, pale skin. Sandy hair. Light eyes, except for when he’s using his magic. Then they glow this bright…unnatural red. And when he hurts people, he smiles too.”
Castiel tossed his head and stamped his front hooves in angry denial. “That’s not what happened!” said Dean, scrambling back to his feet.
When winter melted into spring, and the Flower Festival had cleared out the stables of all people down to the last little stable girl, Metatron came to visit
—A major river of Michaeretz, though smaller than the Voda. It trickles down from the Micharim and passes not too far from Mt. Heaven, to which it supplies water, and travels across the country until emptying into the Eastern Marshes. It retains a vulgarized version of its ancient name, which would have been
Suddenly Dean couldn’t wait another second. He tugged lightly on Cas’s bicep, who obligingly turned over. Though he was mostly asleep still, his face lit up when he saw Dean, fully happy and without artifice.
The shock of it, on top of the grief over the death of his parents, a thousand knives in his heart, was simply too much.
He tore his eyes away from his beautiful, perfect horse, in time to see Bobby dismounting from a chestnut riding horse, though free of tack. “Bobby!” Dean grinned.
“Come along, Sam!” called Rowena, rounding the back of the cottage. Sam appeared a moment later looking tired, but hell, who wasn’t? Rowena halted next to Cas and put her hands on her hips. “What do you think, Fergus? Learn anything at that university of yours that could reverse the dear prince’s enchantment?”
Cas snorted, but accepted the offering, snatching it right from his hand and grinding it to a pulp in a few short chomps. Though Castiel seemed to trust him, Dean eyed the mage warily.
The ride back to Horsetown was uneventful at first. The farms were sparsely populated enough for them to pass through unrecognized, but as they trotted closer to the stables and the surrounding buildings Dean swallowed, heart pounding. Then a figure came galloping toward them through the outer ring of cottages, someone riding—no, just a horse.
It was sickening, seeing Castiel standing still, bearing the source of all his pain upon his scarred back, his abuser nearby. Dean’s hands shook. There was only so much longer he could carry on like this, only so much longer could he watch his friend suffer. But then, in the very moment of his despair, he felt: a flash of heat against his thigh. The stone!
“It’s more complicated than that,” said Crowley, swatting away an intrepid fly. “The spell is still active. We have to consider what he was intending in the attack, but also his more recent intent.”
“Tavern closed?” Bobby asked, as he and the boys did as instructed. Sam knocked a barrel over with enthusiasm and laughed, rolling it back at high speed like it was a new toy to play with. One of the cows grumbled its displeasure at the noise. Rumsfeld snorted.
But he grew complacent, established patterns for the seasons, where the grass was greener and a kind person might be near and willing to share an apple. Wranglers caught him at last, and dragged him back to Mt. Heaven, though he kicked and screamed the whole way. From the villages he had gleaned that Lucifer had retreated and Metatron had taken the throne, but for him, that was hardly better.
Dean felt like he’d been struck. “Maybe he’s theirs,” Dean said. “Maybe he belongs to Demons and that’s why Metatron wanted to break him…”
With nothing else to do, the Sam and Dean pocketed their meager earnings and wandered the labyrinth of vendors until they reached the Harvelles’ stand. Ellen, Jo, and Pam were tapping kegs and pouring all kinds of beers and ciders; there were also crates stuffed with straw protecting bottles of all kinds, holding liquors like the whiskey they’d gifted Rufus. A ledge wrapped around three sides of the stand, and the brothers squeezed in and planted their elbows on it, carving out a space. Pam was the first to notice them; she lifted her head and cocked an ear in their direction. “Is that the Winchesters?” she asked in her deep voice. She grinned so big the wrinkles deepened around her cloudy eyes.
At first he tried to join the little bands of mustangs whenever he came across them. They would maybe let him graze near them for a day, but eventually one of them would take umbrage and move their families along, or a stallion would charge toward him in challenge. No matter how hard he tried, he could not gain an understanding with them.
“Yep,” Ellen said. “Closed the bar and you three are the only guests for the night, so here we are.” She set Sam’s barrel upright, smiling her thanks, and set her basket down.
Rowena’s red lips split into a sardonic smile. “A lie, Sam. A false little idea that spread like Hellfire.”
“Hellfire,” Crowley confirmed. “It wasn’t a bad idea on his part. The warding in my study, where Castiel would also practice his magic, would have been strong enough to contain the worst of it. And the spell is the signature of Lucifer’s Demons. Few people would question it.”
Castiel gasped. He grabbed it and sat up; Dean let him and instead pressed against his side, tucking his chin over his shoulder. “Where did you get this? I thought they’d all been melted?”
, the Lady Billie had said, and now he knew what she meant, because he felt it now. Angel was special like Impala was. Impala so often seemed to understand exactly what he was trying to get across to her. Maybe he could treat Angel the same way.
Little Sammy shrunk closer to his companion. The older boy didn’t quite have the art to hide his confusion, but Bobby could see the gates slamming shut. The last thing he wanted was for these hurt, vulnerable boys to be driven off. Especially since their horse was sticking its face down between the two of them, for all the world like it was checking on them. As if it was taking no conscious thought, both boys brought a hand up to pat its nose.
“And the last living cousin I have cursed me, tortured me, and now sits in the dungeons. One of my uncles is slowly building an army to challenge the entire continent, and my aunt is being so reserved in her diplomacy it makes me suspect she might be just as willing to ally herself with Lucifer, if it means she can wrest half the kingdom from my rule, which she considers weak. My parents had perhaps more of a role in orchestrating the last war than previously thought, while every single one of them perpetuates the lie my grandfather wrought. Are all the apples on my family tree so rotten?”
As he strode past the open stall to get to his bag, he stopped. There, curled on top of a pile of hay and half-smothered in an old saddle blanket, Sam slept.
A trait like that could make a bag of dicks like Metatron double down like a it’s a challenge. But Sam was right that
Through the windows of the sun room, dim but still discernible was the shape of his sleeping little brother, giant form twisted across the two wicker chairs. Dean hauled himself to his feet and went up to a clear pane of the glass, cupping his face on either side to peer in. Sam was lying on his back, right arm trailing to the ground, but his left leg pulled his lower half to the side, up and over his right, and bent at an awkward angle. Castiel approached at his shoulder to see what he was looking at. Dean grinned at him and winked, knocking hard on the window.
Dean felt a horrific rage boil up inside him, shooting through his entire body before escaping it with a yell. He dropped the bow and tackled the Demon, or tried; the man easily turned and caught him by the throat. Dean gasped, his hands instinctively flying upward to pry the fingers from his neck. They may as well have been made of stone, for all they moved. Sam didn’t try to help, but was left sitting where the Demon left him, eyes hooded and body relaxed. He softly plucked the string of the bow that had fallen in his lap.
At this pronouncement Angel looked at Dean, somehow seeming small again. Dean reached out and stroked his cheekbone, and scritched behind the bolt of his jaw. The horse leaned into the contact.
He had noticed, he had, but something had kept him from leaving. Something having to do with Dean’s smile, and how the muted colors in his equine vision didn’t mute the bright apple green of his eyes at all.
It was the thing that stitched humans together in ways the angels could never fathom. Her mother’s soft kiss on her forehead. Holding her hand as she fell asleep each night.
“You saw it,” he said hesitantly, one last small internal battle, maybe for himself, maybe for Cas, even if he knew it was weak. “You saw what that shifter did to you. I watched you cry out to me, hours screaming my name. Mine, Cas. Like I’d done it to you myself, and you know what? In a way I did.”
Thomas glanced at her through the fire, all the angels’ eyes quickly drawn to the portal through the window.
The high pitched scream of angelic resonance pierced the air, peaking with the deafening shriek of shattering glass. The windows exploded, Sam raising an arm up quickly to shield his face from the blast. The angels each palmed their ears to stave off the splitting sound.  The ground shook, earth cracking and trembling. A detonation of light exploded through the portal in a tsunami-like wave.
He'd been in the same spot for an hour now, eyes closed, and body unmoving. Each second passed over him. His brain, unconnected with time, was stationed far away searching for an answer.
“No,” he said. He took his own phone out of his pocket, eyeing it like a foreign creature. He hammered at the icons with a thumb, scowl deepening. “Must be on silent again.”
Sam eyed him, curious. He should probably tell Sam. In fact, part of him wanted to. But, as Sam looked back at him with comically fluffy morning hair, he paused. He thought about Cas's breath on his ear, his shivers against his touch. Dean glanced at his hands, fiddling with the beer.
Dean rolled his pen across the flat of his desk with a palm, staring at the two small sentences on the page.
Cas looked, darkly. The walls in the room sparked, but time remained frozen, all three bodies still motionless below. Dean. Cas. Naomi.
“Did you. . . God, I can’t believe I’m saying this. Okay, here goes. Did you. . .  dreamcrash me last night?”
Dean stared at their unconscious forms, limbs tangled up in each other, Cas’s head resting on his chest. He felt their joined hands in the still room.
“Cas,” he choked, words barely there. “I hope you can hear me. That wherever you are, it’s not too late.”
From Dean’s vantage point, he could see Cas’s shoulder blades constrict, even through his trenchcoat, the lines of his rigid neck peeking out from under the collar.
“I knew what I was taking.” she said, “But, for what it’s worth, nothing managed to surprise me more then the lengths he’d go to end your suffering. Even if it put him in hell in the process.”
The frozen room accentuated his hesitation. He wished he had another answer. Lies popped into his head, things he could say to fix it, even if they’d both see right through the attempt.
Tremors like shocks before an earthquake. Building, growing. The light increased, radiating in swirls, bowing and rocking in chaotic jolts. Sarah grabbed Thomas’s hand, eyes wide.
Dean felt frozen in place, as if he were watching the events unfold on a movie screen, rather than right in front of him. Everything felt just out of reach.
“What other choice do we have? We can’t call Cas, and we need to know what this weird-as-hell dream riddle says.”
Dean laid the pen tip against his bottom lip, digging it in. He wrote, then crossed out a few attempts, ripping out and balling up the paper to throw on the floor. Sam frowned.
They breathed in tandem, their stares connecting their meanings far better than words had ever been able to.
Frustrated, Cas opened his eyes. He felt irritation growing within himself as Dean’s story replayed in his mind. He wasn't going to get anywhere like this.
“What are you trying to tell me?” Dean asked aloud after he felt more like himself. He was careful to avoid Cas's name, just in case it turned into a prayer. Dean pulled over and turned the car off as he closed his eyes, struggling to pull the memory of Cas's words from his mind.
“You're up,” Sam said, surprised. He pulled the chair out from under Dean’s feet, letting them crash to the ground. Dean lurched forward, barely regaining his balance and scowled.
Dean scrubbed his hand across his face, taking out his phone again. He’d scrolled to Cas’s name when he was interrupted.
True, human's dreamed of strange and curious things, most of them meaningless. It wasn't the dream itself that caused Cas anxiety, though. It was the timing.
The prince’s mouth quirked in a rueful smile. “Because of this?” he asked, touching a hand to his circlet.
It was loud enough to pierce the tavern’s chatter, but as it was likely in response to the men who’d left getting into some kind of fistfight outside, Bobby ignored it. So did the rest of the tavern, except for the boys. “Stay here, Sammy,” commanded the older boy, his voice sharp in the momentary quiet. He raced to the door, and the littler boy, Sammy, didn’t waste a moment to disobey, chasing right on his heels.
“It was the garden outside my study! Of course I was there!” he yelled, slamming his fist on the table. “I wasn’t on the battlefield because I was Castiel’s last line of defense!”
and now their theory about Angel was making Dean look almost well adjusted. “You guys are fucking crazy.”
As the sun rose, so the people in Horsetown multiplied. Children ran; dogs barked. Dancers twirled their bangles jangling, skirts and stashes whipping about them as fiddlers fiddled and drummers drummed. The smell of smoked meat and roasted vegetables wafted from the food stands, and a firebreather, tattoos of dragons snaking about his body, shot flame from his mouth in a wide circle to the delighted shrieks of the onlookers. Normally Dean would be enjoying it all, turkey leg in one hand and beer in the other, but his stomach soured at the thought of Angel coming out of his stupor in a small wooden chute, no room to move.
There were multiple ways to navigate a city as big and old as Mt. Heaven, but the main road with paved white stones wound round and round the edge of the butte before curling to the castle at the peak, a couple hours' journey if no haste was made. Still the splendid horse walked, carrying his plain rider up the incline with nary a complaint. His hooves rang loud in the pocket of silence that surrounded them, the people who a moment before had been rushing to leave the city now frozen in astonishment. Following the curve of the road, they passed through the lowest neighborhoods of Mt. Heaven, with its poorest people. Some residents wondered why someone with a horse so fine had bothered coming to their part of town, but many had been in the infantry during the Border War, and their hearts filled with both love and pain. They remembered Queen Hannah, who used to walk their streets in glittering crown, but had still
“Alright, everybody stop standing around and help get these barrels to the kitchens,” said Bobby loudly, cutting him off. “Sooner we do that the sooner this horse gets some rest,” he added, patting Beryl’s nose. The men and women milling about hopped to, and Sam slipped from the wagon to help. Dean sat for another moment, wondering at how the gruff stablemaster and the gruff innkeeper had finally,
A dry, curled leaf from the branch broke free and drifted onto Crowley’s shoulder. The traitor sighed and brushed it away. “Yes, that makes so much sense! Which is why I’m here, in this terrible little cottage in the middle of nowhere, with my
They all looked over at Angel, who'd finished drinking from his bucket. He blinked at them placidly.
“Don’t you get it, yet?” Dean said, ducking under Cas’s arm, who embraced him without thought. He sighed and closed his eyes, perfectly willing to stay in bed for the rest of the day. He thought they deserved that. “I’d rather have you, king or not.”
“Ah…” said Sam, looking at the dozen books, most with covers so old and faded their titles could no longer be discerned.
But all they could do was keep their promise. They waited with Angel, who still gnashed his teeth at anyone else who came near him, especially Gadreel, who’d come back to check on the stallion. He did not try to reach for the halter twice. “The king arrives soon,” he said simply, and stood by the mechanism that would open the gate of the chute.
Gods above, if he suggested that Impala deserved some time in Angel’s position next Dean was going to lose it. He opened his mouth, unsure how to phrase
“Yes, your majesty,” the horsemaster replied. Now that the man was standing at his full height, he practically dwarfed the king, who was almost a foot shorter.
Dean finished off the last of Cas’s mane and hurried after him. The outer room had saddles and halters, reins and bridles, all the equipment for every day riding or drafting. Armor belonging to the horses of particular knights were kept with that knights’ armor in storage in their own estates. But this inner room, which Dean had almost never been allowed into, held armor rarer by far. Some of it was of an older style, since fallen out of fashion, like armor made of glittering scales that would drape over a horse like a cloak, tightly woven mats of wicker, leather in a thickness that had long been made obsolete by the best archers. There were foreign pieces, like a chanfron with devil’s horns from Luciterra, ancient bronze armor from Rafaelia, and even a few prize chest plates from other lands across the oceans.
Dean kissed him, if only to smooth his brow and to calm his upset. “Wait here,” he said. He slipped out of bed and knelt next to his pack sitting unobtrusively in the corner. Sam had brought it for him, knowing they both slept better when all their most prized belongings were ready to pick up at a moment’s notice. He dug into a small, secret pocket and held the object he found there in his fist. When he turned around he saw Cas lying stretched out on the bed, propped up on his elbows to watch Dean, open and unashamed in the light of day. Dean grinned. Starting from the foot of the bed, he crawled over Castiel until he was sitting on his lap. “For you,” he said, and held up the double crown.
“For love of you, a foolish pauper with a heart of gold and his makeshift family risked everything and now here we are.”
“All of it,” said Sam, swinging himself onto the ladder and hopping down. Dean followed him, and noted that Impala’s stall was empty, as it often was since she rarely stayed in it for any length of time. Whether Angel knew how to get out of his stall was unclear, as Gadreel had commanded a chain and lock be put around it so that he couldn’t escape.
Rowena looked at him appraisingly, then smiled a wicked little smile. She leaned forward. “Ready for your first lesson in witchcraft, dearie?”
figured each other out. Several years in the making, this was, and Dean wanted to savor it before dismounting and helping out. He grinned down at Bobby until the man noticed and glared back. “You too, idjit,” he said.
The rider stopped their horse several feet away. Slowly, they lifted their gloved hands and pulled back their hood. It was the Lady Billie. “Nice night for it,” she said, in her deep, measured tone.
Dean stayed where he was, sitting on a large stone worn smooth by countless years of running water. At first, he thought of nothing. Then he saw a fish darting in the shallows near his feet, and thought idly of catching it. He didn’t move. It swam away downstream and he followed it with his gaze, staring east, wondering what it would be like to sail the river all the way to the ocean. What the ocean would even be like. Then he looked upstream, west, at the sinking sun, where the river curved back toward the mountains. Should they go east, to Rafaelia? West, to Lokiland? Did it matter?
“It is unlikely there is another answer,” Gadreel said sharply. “Commander behaves for him when he does not behave for anyone else. If you tried to mount him he would throw you in an instant, I’d stake my career on it.”
There was a singular, crystal moment in which the three travelers were as still as their surroundings.
, Devils Tower, and numerous other buttes of the Great Plains of the United States. Except, like several times bigger.
“She’s been worried sick,” said Sam. “We all have, but it was worse for her. She hates the city so much but she wouldn’t leave the castle grounds. I’ve been taking care of her all I can. The staff don’t like that I let her in here sometimes. Though Cas is nice about it, made sure you had a room on the ground floor.”
Sam watched Dean flee the cottage, and how Angel, rolling his eyes in equine panic, whinnied and backed up as quickly as he could, clearly aiming to go after his brother. He wasn’t always sure what upset Dean so much, since he still often kept things from Sam in typical big brother fashion, but he figured it was maybe feeling a little like he’d just lost another horse. But Sam didn’t see it that way. Having their suspicions confirmed, even in a way they didn’t expect, made something settle inside down to his bones. For once, he felt he was exactly where he needed to be.
That evening, after the chores were done, and all the horses safely in their stalls, the squires and pages off in their own barracks, many of the younger folk of Horsetown gathered behind the kitchens. The fire pit was lit, flames merrily blazing, and all held a mug of fresh cider or beer from a newly opened Harvelle barrel. After toasting Jo, everyone settled in to chat, many excited for the upcoming festival but mostly, that night, talking of the king.
The small piece of furniture looked ridiculous in the horsemaster’s large hands, but dutifully he stepped behind Dean and stooped to place the stool beneath the saddle. When it was settled Metatron shooed him away and used it first to get his left foot in the stirrup. Then, toes sinking into the stool’s red cushion, and draping both arms across Castiel’s back, the king heaved himself up and over. He moved obnoxiously in his seat, adjusting his robe and accidentally (or not) kicking Cas’s flank when trying to get his right foot into the other stirrup. Then he snapped his fingers at Dean, holding out his hand.
Thankfully Rufus had kept the metal in good shape, and nothing needed the forge to be fixed. Benny knocked out a few dents while Dean and Bobby finished the grooming, and Rufus picked out a lovely blue and gold cloth for under the saddle. Then, between Bobby and Rufus’s knowhow, they made quick work of assembling it on Castiel himself, all under Impala’s curious gaze.
“It really is best to get that beautiful horse out of sight. He’s big and mean but let’s not take chances, huh?”
The other buildings making up the stables were many and varied. There were barns to keep the ploughs, carriages, and other large equipment that might be attached to a horse. There was the smithy, where farriers and armorers worked to keep the horses safe in both work and battle. Pages and some squires slept in the barracks for just that purpose, working their way from the bottom up to knighthood. Next to that were the training grounds, where pages all the way up to Reapers would train with their horses, often under the watchful eye of Horsemaster Gadreel. Grooms and hands with their own families lived in cottages dotting the area between the stables and Mt. Heaven, as well as the farmers who tilled the nearby fields, mostly feed for the horses: oats and grasses to make hay for the winter. The kitchens were there to feed everyone else.
Her delivery was so straight it took the poor kid a moment, then his eyes widened. Laughter bubbled out of Dean, loud in the night. He slapped his hands over his mouth, but there was no taking it back. Sam started laughing too, then Jo was laughing, and Ellen and Bobby smiled to hear them.
“What’s the matter?” the Demon laughed, blood dripping from the bare teeth on the side of his mouth. “Don’t you know when you’ve lost?”
At first it was no big deal. Again Gadreel tried his usual methods of training, and again Angel blocked him at every approach. And every evening before dinner the horsemaster would have Dean summoned—or Sam, if he was more readily available—to take Angel away as he headed back up to the city. Dean didn’t like bringing Angel to and from Gadreel, but it was infinitely better than his using the spell powder, and this way Angel would have more time to eat and drink.
interesting,” said Metatron. “I can see it in your aura, yes, there it is!” He clasped his hands together and put an exaggerated frown on his face. “And he doesn’t even know you’re a person.” He shook his head in false sympathy.
That snapped the two back into motion. Crowley set down his scone and eyed the stallion, who was stretching his neck further into the house, shoulders bumping against the windowsill. “No, you may not have cream tea. I’ll find you a little treat later, Highness.”
Dean yelled again, but this time to protest his own weakness. He withdrew his sword from the man’s neck, flipped it, and knocked him out with the pommel. “Grab your things, Sammy,” he said.
For the rest of the night, the horses kept going. In the past, when Sam and Dean had needed a quick getaway, Impala could trot with both of them on her back for miles and miles, and it seemed the intervening years of plenty hadn’t changed that. But by the time the sun was just beginning to make itself known to their left, spreading rosy fingers across the vast sky, Angel could no longer keep up. His hide was soaked with sweat, and his chest heaved with massive breaths. Angel dropped to a walk, then stumbled to a stop.
The cottage door slammed shut, and the garden gate curled back into the hedge. Dean and Cas watched as the spidery tree legs lifted back out of the ground and propelled the property away, taking Sam and the witches with it. Dean shuddered. “Just not natural.”
The food was gone in no time—Bobby was certain Sam and Dean could have eaten three times as much—so Ellen unstoppered the jug and poured a generous amount in each cup. It turned out to be a kind of berry cordial, sweet but not too sweet, perfect to wash down the meal. She really was soft for these boys. “And one more thing,” she said. Reaching into her basket once more, she pulled out a large juicy carrot. “Do you think Impala would like a treat, too?” It was a treat in itself to see Dean’s face light up the way it did, like there was still some child left in him. He set the rest of his cordial down, forgotten, and went right over to his horse to feed her. She crunched down on it immediately, while Dean pet her in delight.
“King Michael’s horse wore this, the day he died,” Rufus said. “It should fit Angel with little issue. This what you need?”
A pageboy rushed off to do as bid, and a royal attendant stepped in front of Castiel, and ignored him in favor of his rider. “King Metatron will speak with you in the audience chamber. Please, follow me.” She waited, expecting for Dean to dismount. When he did not, and said nothing, she turned on her heel and led him across the hall.
Pondering a refill, he let his gaze wander around the little tavern. Ellen and her daughter Jo kept a good business. The little inn sat along the road to the capital, just about a day’s ride to the east, which was perfect for those looking for somewhere to rest on their journey. Mt. Heaven stood like a sentinel on the plains, a massive butte rising thousands of feet into the air, a chalky monolith against green ground and blue sky. If you were traveling west, it heralded the badlands that would appear in a few more miles, which bled into the foothills of the great Micharim Mountains, the western border of Michaeretz. From the Roadhouse you could just see the top of the highest towers of the castle, shining like a beacon on the western horizon. But Bobby was here to forget about all that.
Dean lowered his hands, and did his best to ignore how they trembled. “Were you—were you always a horse?”
He could hear his parents yelling, the clash of blade on blade, the gritty magic words the Demon spit out. The sounds faded as Impala hit the bottom of the hill and started making an arc around their village, where every house burned and people moved in silhouettes of dark shadow from flame to flame.
Dean pulled his arm back toward himself, and as soon as he stopped pushing toward the gate, the hedge let him go. He sheathed his knife and this time grabbed Sam with both hands.
Sure enough, there wasn’t enough room in the chute to fully kick, or even bend his forelegs to rear, but that wasn’t stopping Angel from moving in what ways he could, ramming himself into the fence and tossing his head in fear.
Bobby and Rufus—now standing in a united front at the center of the crescent that curved around the visitors—both snorted. “No one summons the king,” said Bobby. “He summons you. I’m the Royal Stablemaster. What’s your business?”
“No,” said Crowley, his upper class airs deflating into something almost genuine. “You’re not, are you?”
“You see,” said Metatron, picking him up by the shirt with one hand. Dean struggled, and got a punch in the stomach for his troubles, doubling him over. “You see, Castiel, I told you this was going to happen.” Metatron went over to where Gadreel’s sword had fallen, dragging Dean with him. “I told you” —he stomped on Dean’s hand when he tried to grab for the blade— “that if you didn’t follow the script that I would kill this wriggling little maggot.” He dragged Dean back over to where Castiel was frozen and forced him to kneel. The magic had paralyzed the prince, but his eyes were moving and his breath was coming quickly. “But it’s too late now! Offer’s off the table. Any last words you want to say before I send him to the big pasture in the sky? No?”
“I know a lot of things,” she said sharply. “I know none of you are quite what you seem to be. Not you, Dean, nor you, Sam, and not the horse you rode in on either. And now Angel, too.” She turned her gaze on each of them as she spoke, before settling on the stallion. “King Metatron wants him because of it. But what I don’t know is why.”
Then the day after that—that very morning—Gadreel himself decided to lead Angel. But Angel would not come with him. He’d snapped at Bobby to bring the horse along, and disappeared. Bobby had a stables to run, and thinking the day would be more of the same, he’d put Angel in the paddock and gotten back to his own work. By the time he’d found out where Gadreel had gone off to, it was too late.
When the mass moving toward them was close enough to resolve into individual people and horses—Gadreel was clearly visible riding to the right of the royal carriage—Bobby took the stallion’s halter from Dean. The Winchesters stepped back a few paces, and Bobby gently coaxed the horse to turn and stand directly in the middle of the large stone square, in profile to the approaching procession.
“But we’re a country made up of horse people!” Metatron interrupted, bright once again. “What could be an easier way to hold auditions than a bit of bronc riding? And
“Not even Im-Impala could outrun the snares. But Angel...” Sam drifted off. They watched as the horse in question sniffed a likely leaf and snorted. Sam took a deep, considering breath, and hesitated.
“He was blinded by his desires,” Crowley contradicted, “and enraged that I’d ruined his plans. When he couldn’t get past our shields, even Castiel’s, distraught though he was, Metatron started picking up every pouch and vial on the shelves and tossing them at us. But they were mine, you see,” he said. “So while much of it was magery, there were also plenty items more in line with witchcraft. And he got lucky. He threw several at once, which burst at the prince’s feet. The edge of the explosion knocked me out, but Castiel took the brunt of it. And when I awoke…” He sighed. “The prince was gone, the castle in disarray, Metatron was already setting himself in charge and soon every Reaper left alive was after my head. And since I prefer it to be attached to my neck, I was forced into hiding.”
Dean raised his eyebrows and looked to Sam, who frowned and shrugged. They looked to Jo, whose wink to them was hidden from Bobby by the floppy brim of her hat.
to believe that he’d tried to help Impala. Most of all Dean needed to believe that when Angel looked at him with his big, blue eyes, and attentively turned his ears in Dean’s direction, that he was listening. That he cared. That maybe, just maybe, it wasn’t just Sam and Dean against the world anymore.
Jo rolled her eyes. “No, I made a trade for half a deer carcass that some hunter was dragging up from the south.”
Dean hummed in response, closing his eyes. He liked Horsetown, and Bobby, and Rufus who looked after the tack and Benny over in the smithy and mostly, to be honest, all the horses themselves. But every now and then, even though they were so often too hot or too cold, so tired and hungry, Dean grew nostalgic for their years wandering the plains, the three of them. It was hard but never lonely, not with his brother and his horse at his side. They'd been beholden to no one but each other, and sometimes, when the wind was right, and Impala was restless, Dean considered picking up and leaving where they left off.
Dean felt the weight of the statement heavy on his shoulders, then abruptly shoved away from the table, toppling the jar of cream. He stomped out the front door of the cottage and stepped off the path into the garden, the opposite side from Angel where the chimney was chugging away. He stood amid the flowering trees and tall herbs swaying in the afternoon light, a pumpkin two feet tall at his knee.
“I don’t know, Dean,” she said, setting her hood back over her curls, blocking her face from the moonlight. “What chance
“John, it’s time,” said Mom, breathing hard. Her blond hair was falling out of her braid, several strands curling along her forehead and cheek, clinging to her face with blood. She clutched her bow in one hand, though her quiver was empty. In the other she held her sword aloft.
“Cas, no!” Dean grabbed his hand. “You haven’t done anything wrong. You’re perfect, and that’s the problem. You’re noble, and powerful, and handsome and you belong in this castle, and I’m just a groom, you know, a stable boy really. I don’t have the smarts like Sam, I’m going to be mucking stalls all my life and sleeping in a barn just like—”
Relying on the moonlight, Dean crept off the rocks and stepped through roots to reach his brother, and the horse. Angel awoke at the soft sounds and lifted his head. “Whoa,” said Dean, not wanting to wake Sam. Angel shifted his shoulders and forelegs so that he could raise his neck comfortably but, Dean noticed, he did not move the rest of his body, leaving Sam to his slumber. Carefully he sat near the horse, and looked at him. Angel blinked placidly, looking back.
Rumsfeld hung his head over his stall and watched her eat. He snorted and gave Bobby the stink-eye. Ellen laughed. “I didn’t forget you, you big lug.” She handed Bobby another carrot.
Castiel halted. Before Dean could decided what to say to the guards, the gates to the castle swung open without prompting to reveal the king himself.
Sam took a deep breath to gather himself. “Okay, so Rowena, Crowley, and I had made it into the crowd. It got really big, just like Crowley said it would, so we spread apart and activated the spell on the stones. It worked. Everything that was said between you in the castle, half the city could hear.”
“And then, you. A bouncing little blue-eyed baby. She felt tremendous pain when she gave birth, and tremendous joy when she held you. One day she was ice, and the next day she melted back into a human being. When she left the castle she recognized you in the arms of other parents, and soon she began to recognize herself.
He did as he was told, getting his hands in the other bucket between the kids splashing each other, thinking they were being sneaky about it. Ellen pulled a clean cloth from one of the baskets and started cleaning Dean’s face. Kid looked like he wanted to argue, but wisely kept his mouth shut. With his skin actually cleaning up a bit, it was a relief to see that his nose had stopped bleeding, and his lip nearly so. He was going to have one hell of a shiner, though. And yet he was barely flinching at Ellen’s touch, even when she grasped his chin to move his head around. Dean was used to pain, no mistake.
—The mountain range which separates Michaeretz from Lokiland (also simply referred to as the Micharim). Similar to Michaeretz itself, it is a pseudo-compound derived from the name Michael and (as far as I can tell without being able to decline in the language)
“So when Gadreel rushed up to the castle to tell me of this fine stallion he’d found, so perfect in form and such a great fighting spirit, he was convinced he’d stumbled across a Great Horse, just for me!” He laughed again, like it was a joke.
While that was not the practice here, Dean had seen it happen a couple of times, and walking into the city was almost an exercise in picking out the wagon nags and beasts of burden whose spirits were entirely gone. “What makes him special?” he dared ask.
But Impala stopped before they reached it, right at the edge of a smaller patch that was several feet across.
“Then you may return to the stables, under one condition: you will be lower than the lowest stable boy, with no chance for advancement. You will serve the horses whom you once thought were only good to serve you, until such time as your soul feels the penance is done.”
The middle section of the north end of the stables had a full second floor only. The ground floor was a colonnade of wide arches, allowing easy access from the butte to the inner courtyard of the stables. The road from Mt. Heaven proper was paved in stone, ending in an open piazza with room enough for people and horses to gather. Squires and pages were already squared away and standing in loose rows to one side, each dressed in the livery of the knight who was their sponsor. The last of the cobbles were being scrubbed, and chickens and goats were ushered back to the other side of the building.
“Of course not! A soldier is still a soldier, even in peacetime, and when Lucifer looked to challenge Michael the only way he knew how to respond was with force.”
Suddenly the horse’s eyelids blinked open, and Dean found himself reflected in one enormous blue eyeball. The stallion’s chest heaved and a bunch of air punched out of his throat, but only a very slight vocalization came though. This had his eyes growing wider, rolling up so the whites were visible, and his breaths became rapid. But his legs, neck, tail, and head did not move, almost as if they were disconnected from the rest of him.
Dean was sitting up with knife in hand before he was even awake. It took him another split second for the dark shadow kneeling over him to coalesce into a person with their own blade, glinting in the thin moonlight that seeped through the rafters. But that was just enough time for the woman to knock his weapon out of the way and stab down. “Sam!” he grunted, grabbing her wrist and taking the punch from her other hand.
“Whatever they talked about, the prince stayed missing, the other kids stayed missing, and as far as we can tell, the search stopped pretty quickly. Besides,” Rufus had added, “the man can barely tell the front end of a horse. Which is probably why he collects them instead of rides them.”
She chanted. With each word her voice grew deeper, more resonant. After a moment her eyes started glowing purple, and purple runes appeared in intricate patterns over the walls, the floor, the ceiling. Vibrations rumbled beneath their feet, then all at once the entire cottage shuddered and moved. Sam and Dean stumbled against the workbench while Cas whinnied in surprise. The brothers peeked out the window over the bench, and saw that the entire property, garden and all, was floating like an island above the forest. No, not floating—massive gnarled roots sprouted from beneath the garden but outside the fence, and angled down with joints that looked like tree knots. Then, as they watched, the roots moved. Like legs. Like giant, living, tree branch
“Oh, please,” she dismissed. If the sly look she was giving him was anything to go by, she was perfectly aware of his disapproval. “Stories of the gods may make them seem human, but by definition there’s something divine and ineffable about them we don’t quite understand. Soldiers reincarnated as horses, on the other hand? Humans have souls, and horses have souls, but they’re different. To anyone with strong enough magic, a human soul in a horse body would certainly draw attention. As for the prince…”
“Big and black and breathing fire,” said Sam, with no little wonder. “He had Metatron cornered. Billie stopped Cas from killing him, but Cas was just lost. He watched you die.” His voice broke on the last word. He took another breath. “He was twisting in the air like he was in pain, and then he got smaller and smaller…he was human again, but had wings, and then I saw you. I hadn’t been able to see you before, because he’d been so big and you were on his other side. I ran, but he got there first. He cried, and kept saying your name over and over again, kept saying—”
The Reaper tracked him but made no move in response. “You fled south,” she corrected, “because it’s your home, Sam and Dean
“If you mean in equipment or recruitment we have that well in hand. But Lucifer will have more than knights.”
“He was pale-skinned,” he said quietly. “Short, dark hair. Middle-aged, maybe. Yellow eyes. And his smile…”
“But my eyes and ears here weren’t lying. You’re sweet on Dean. He’s even let you off your leash a couple of times, and you didn’t run. I wonder if you even noticed?”
There had been some discussion, before parliament made their vote, about who would be given the honor of crowning the king. When they brought the issue to Castiel, it is said he could think of no honor greater than being surrounded by the friends who helped him in his time of need. And so behind him marched Sam Winchester, tall and proud in the garb of his region, plain pants and simple mail, a longbow slung over his shoulder. With him was Robert Singer, Royal Stablemaster under King Metatron and his second, Rufus Turner. There was the farrier, Benjamin Lafitte, wearing the same cap as the others hailing from his region; following them were a slew of young stable boys and girls, scrubbed within an inch of their lives. Behind them was the Lord Crowley and his mother Rowena who, rumor had it, was a real witch. They were dressed the finest of all the revenue, in purples and blacks. Bringing up the rear was Dean Winchester, who had hastily changed from his sun costume. He and his mare wore specially commissioned armor with the new crest of the king: a pegasus and a unicorn facing each other, rampant. When the crest was plastered up around the festival grounds the people had known at once the pegasus stood for the king, but it wasn’t until now they understood the unicorn: Impala’s chanfron bore a horn, wicked and sharp.
“The people!” Metatron grinned and spread his hands, turning as if to encompass the whole city. “When Michael and Hannah died the people were frightened little sheep looking for someone to lead them. They didn’t care who was on the throne as long as the war ended and they could go about their lives again. So I gave them a story to believe in! A lost prince to give them hope, boohoo, and in the meantime I would be there as hope faded, quietly waiting. I laid the seeds for my future, letting loose an illness here or there so I could cure a few people, calling up a storm to wipe out a village and go comfort the survivors…Whenever they’ve needed me, I’ve been there. And I will continue to be here, because I am who the people want.
dragging him away from Impala, how dare he?! Dean elbowed him, stomped on his foot, but the tenacious bastard just held tighter, pulling him behind a tree.
Gadreel looked down his nose at them from the other side of the fence, and strode around. “Go on,” he said to the mare, tapping her flank and encouraging her to go in Angel’s direction. She skipped away and trotted past Angel, turning her rump to him in dismissal. Gadreel looked at the Winchesters, his mouth in the habitual flat line of the past few days, and a subtle scowl twisting his face into something hawklike. “You should bring Impala. Commander seemed willing to listen to her when he first arrived here.”
None of this seemed to bother Sam. As he spoke of all the changes that had happened since Metatron was deposed, and magic revealed to be common, he would tease Cas, nudge him, encourage him to pick up parts of the story. Many people were very angry about this lie that Michael had perpetuated for so long, that they wanted the royal line abolished all together. If there was no real divine right as expressed through magic, what gave them the right to rule at all?
Josephine, a stable girl, raised her hand like she was in a classroom. “Do you think Commander is a Great Horse?” she asked. This was met with a cacophony of answers from the other stable kids, and the apprentices from the smithy and the kitchen, which soon devolved into shoving and yelling as the debate grew heated.
It just—it didn’t feel right. It was one thing to care for and coddle a horse, to groom him and feed him, to comfort him in his pain, and ride him for miles across the prairie, and whisper secrets to him in the dead of night. It was quite another to think of a person this way. To think of him as family and weep on his shoulder. It reeked of betrayal, but also something else. Something close to fear. How could Angel—Castiel—a
The Demon staggered, but did not disappear. The Hellfire that licked them grew monstrous in size and finally, finally caught the Demon too. The three of them seemed as one, now, as they collapsed in a heap. A single bonfire alone on the plain.
“Oh, so you do care about him!” Metatron exclaimed. “You see, I wasn’t sure whether or not the bumpkin and his overgrown brother were just tools for you.”
“Ah yes,” said Metatron. “Just a bit of renovation. But never mind that! To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?”
“The fuck,” said Dean, when he was done. Just a year ago Dean had had nothing more to worry about than how many stalls he had to muck out in the morning. A few months ago he just wanted to protect a horse that was getting hurt. A few days ago he was seriously worried about his job, and now? Magic was apparently more common than they were, his life and his brother’s were in danger from their king, the kingdom in turn was in danger from Lucifer without a strong leader to safeguard them, and their best hope to depose the king was a man who’d been turned into a horse as a boy and had no practical experience. Besides which, crowning him in this climate was as bad as throwing him to the wolves.
Then Angel sighed a great sigh, and seemed to grow smaller and lighter at once, as if a great weight had been lifted from him. Exhausted, his head hung low.
“It’s too late, Dean!” Sam manhandled him over to Angel, who now was still. Dean tried to stop him, tried to protest, but felt himself weak. Sam tossed him onto Angel’s back, a feat that would have impressed him any other day, but now it was all he could do to get his leg swung over. Leaping up behind him, Sam clicked his tongue before they were even settled. Then angel was off, cantering deep into the woods, until they became so thick he slowed to a trot.
The new king let it continue for awhile, but then raised a hand for silence. In his other he held a green stone. When he spoke, his voice seemed to come from the land itself, stretching all across the crowd, deep and resonant as thunder.
Sam shook his head and went to grab something actually edible. Dean shifted in his seat, rubbing at the underside of his chin.
“It should have worked,” Cas said through bared teeth, the admission feeling gritty in his mouth. “Why didn’t it work?”
Cas blinked first, rushing forward to close the gap like a burst rubber band. He locked their mouths together, hungry and fast. Gripping his fingers tightly in Dean’s hair, they moved together with desperation and abandon.
Sam came closer to get a clearer look, then picked up the notebook, eyes skimming over Dean's scribbles. He held the writing up to the light.
The walls dimmed as the whispering of the angels continued, no one daring to move, but everyone readied, blades drawn--a sea of silver, glinting and blinding.
He hammered bunched fingers into the dip in his chest as if to nail his own autonomy straight to the core of his heart.
Ribbons of bright blue light broke through the atmosphere. The mighty heads of great beasts. Blue eyes and a thousand swords, light ricocheting off them like an angry comet--some of the weapons being used to divert the lightning itself.
Cas turned away. “No,” he said curtly. “I’m just not sure any of this is worth it. Working with you.”
Dean tasted the gritty air in his mouth as they emerged and felt the crunch of ash and silt beneath his feet. His spine tingled and he greeted the inner darkness that clung to him, as if he'd never left.
Cas gently led him from the blaze, their hands firmly intertwined as if Dean were Abednego from The Bible himself, fireproof and unscathed.
“Stand up,” Cas ordered as soon as she’d fully regained consciousness. She did, slowly, staring at him the whole way.
The whiskey burned, but did little to warm him. He took another sip anyway, the sting trickling down his throat.
He could have hesitated. He could have deliberated. But he didn't. Instead, he took a deep breath, leaned forward--
He shouldn’t, but Dean wished Cas were angry still instead of this. It was easier than the way he looked betrayed, eyes open wide, uncertain and in pain.
Cas gripped him firmly, a small consolation, but he couldn't help the way his skin trembled and paled.
“You’re the snake,” said Naomi, voice catching. “Lifted high on Moses’ pole. The sickness, and the cure. Others can look to you when you’ve turned to bronze and avoid your wretched fate. Too bad you were more poisonous than I could
Even her tone took on the quality as she found the words that could cut Dean the deepest and animated them with sound: “He has to find his own way home.”
An angel and the rocks; two great powers hemorrhaging their life force together. And Cas suddenly wondered if he'd reached the pinnacle of his creation; to die for heaven.
It takes eight minutes for the Sun’s rays to reach the Earth, Cas thought, not for the first time. The day the sun stopped it would take eight minutes for the world to know it was dying.
He felt lost, starting to wonder if he was a reliable narrator. Like he’d created complicated language for himself when maybe what he needed was simplicity.
Dean blinked, delaying before he moved to the side to allow him access. He slowly walked to the center of the room, listening to the door close lightly before he was face to face with Dean. He anchored the part of him that had felt at sea in the safety of this space, his senses inundated with freckles, messy blonde hair and the familiar smell of leather and whiskey.
Blue-white translucent skin revealed vein-like spidery patterns across Castiel’s true form. Underneath, the grace pulsed visibly.
Cas breathed fast as the noise built, the sounds electrocuting his nerves. A light brushed his cheek, the emotional voltage of it coursing through him:
Cas held his hand. He didn't deserve it. Hadn't earned it. Here Cas was, though, begging him to let himself have it, anyway.
He hesitated, but the light called him, still. He caught it with tight fingers, clenching it in a fist.
Cas closed his eyes as the violent pressure increased, holding his breath against the current of reckless power.
He absently brushed aside a wet strand of hair, unable to keep himself from smiling at the sight in front of him. Dean stared, expression unreadable with a duffle bag slung over his shoulder, keys in hand.
The tension strung between them like a chord. Lightning pierced the room, chasing the shadows away, if only momentarily.
Cas sprung, taking a step forward and he brandished the blade against her throat, eyes hollow. Naomi stared at the silver glint.
Crowley huffed, but shook it off. “Fine, don’t divulge, but you and I both know you never would have come to me if you weren't desperate. Whatever worries you have must be worth the consequences, because you’re not walking away right now. You can’t. It may be a week, a century, but eventually you'll come back, and do you know why?”
He flipped over the remaining pictures one at a time--a final farewell. In the end, he was left with nothing but the white-canvassed backs creating a blank wall of white.
Above him, Rebecca, eyes blown wide as her hands fell limply to her sides, angel blade clattering to the floor with abandon.
Castiel’s hand, reaching. In one fluid motion, he wrapped his arm around Dean's chest, pulling him tightly to him. His palm gripped Dean's shoulder under the sleeve.
“Cas came to see me,” he continued. “He kept trying to give me some kind of message. It was all botched up, though. I couldn't really understand it, and now I realize why.” He said the last part pointing to the notebook as explanation.
“Cas. . .?” Dean started, carefully. He reached out and Cas tensed, hands running from Dean’s touch only to coil themselves around the back of his own neck like a noose.
