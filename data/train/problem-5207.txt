Dean’s hand fell to his side. “Concerning fucking
rounding any bases with Cas in this house.”
“Don’t mess around with it, alright. What if he’s trying to call right now?” The phone stays silent. Dean picks up his cereal bowl and dumps it in the sink. “He’ll call again.”
“Dean, are you -” Cas starts, but doesn't get to finish. Dean pulls Cas in, wiping the dirt from his cheeks with both hands, and kisses his grinning mouth. Cas’ hands flutter to his belt, then dig in tight, like he’s afraid Dean will fly away the moment he lets go.
Jack shows up as they’re eating breakfast, popping into the room with a rush of energy that makes the curtains swirl and sets the clock back three and a half minutes.
“Yeah, alright.” Dean’s eyes dart away, embarrassed. “If you say so.” He closes the negligible distance left between them, bumping his chilled nose gently against Castiel’s cheek in a wordless petition. Castiel draws back a little, so that Dean will follow him, so that he will make a tiny, pleading noise just before Castiel kisses him; barely a brush of lips until Dean’s fingers dig into the fabric of his coat, then gently deeper, so that Dean huffs in soft relief and his shoulders finally relax.
At the sensation of Cas’ fingers sliding over the skin behind his balls, Dean made a frantic sound he definitely wouldn’t have been proud of in any other situation. They were slick with something - spit, maybe soap; Dean honestly didn’t care. All he cared about was the way they didn’t tease, didn’t hesitate, just pushed inside him, almost like they could reach for that burning rock of need in his gut. They twisted inside him - not rough, but merciless; like Cas knew that Dean wouldn’t have the patience for anything else. When they pulled back, Dean groaned and pressed his forehead to the tile. Cas’ mouth pressed against the base of Dean’s neck, agonizingly soft, like an apology; and then the head of Cas’ cock pushed - blunt and hot - against him.
“Dunno.” Dean slurps back the last of his drink, letting the hollow rattle of the empty straw drag out for a good few seconds, just to make sure he got it all. “Now finish your fries.”
His niece looks up at him with the biggest, sweetest doe-eyes he’s ever seen, and announces, “I like broccoli.”
“I promised Jack we would go on the Ferris wheel tonight,” he says, and Dean knows he’s getting a kick out of it’ll - the bastard - because Dean would rather go toe to toe with Lucifer than consent to being up that high, in a teeny little basket. He’s been putting it off all week. “I’m sure the view will be wonderful.”
Dean slurps on his soda, emphatically, hoping Jack will take that and run with it. How do you help a phenomenal cosmic power with his self-esteem issues? Hell, Dean doesn’t even know how to deal with his entirely too human issues.
Lilly sighs, laying her head on Dean’s shoulder. The photo has been here her entire life, and Dean’s not sure she’s ever looked at it. Most of the time, he tries not to look at it. “He looks nice,” she says.
Wordlessly, with the towel draped mostly over his head, so that he wouldn’t be tempted to look up, Dean patted the tile next to him. When Cas sat, Dean stole a glance at him. He looked good, maybe a little stunned; his face flushed, dark hair plastered to his head.
“No,” she mumbles into his shirt, while Dean’s hand rubs little circles on her back. “Daddy said you didn’t feel good. And you were sad. Because you miss your friend.”
Cas feigned innocence, with little success. “How did you know?”
“Dean,” Eileen abandons the table setting and stretches up on her toes to loop her arms around his neck for a hug. “You made it.”
Maybe Sam was right to worry about him going out of his mind with this.
When he finishes, Dean’s arms still itch. In fact, nothing at all seems different.
He hadn’t decided on anything - hadn’t even broached the subject with Cas yet - but he’d been browsing, casually, listings in Lebanon and the surrounding area, just getting a feel for what was out there. He was even starting to warm up to the idea; he just wasn’t sure quite how to tell Sam, yet.
At some point, Cas glanced up from his drink and realized he did not know where Dean was.
Dean herds Cas into the shower, after. The place has decent water pressure, surprisingly, and a good hot water tank - or maybe they’re just the only ones using it. They spend a long time under the spray, sharing slow, water-logged kisses. Dean soaps up Cas’ hair into wild spikes with his fingers and laughs into his mouth. When they get out and towel off, Cas kisses away the droplets that catch on Dean’s eyelashes.
They’re not so different like that, Dean thinks. He’s never really believed he could have what he wanted either.
“How do you feel?” Cas asked.
Dean buried his face in the towel again. “Uh - okay. Yeah. Took the edge off.” Not all the way off, but he definitely felt better; back somewhere close to where he’d been five or six hours ago, when the curse first hit him and he thought he could handle it himself.
“Great,” Dean leans into Cas’ touch, shivering as Cas’ fingertips trail down his neck, over his shoulder, along the ridge of his shoulder blade. “I just needed a break. Told Sam we’d meet them down on the boardwalk for dinner.”
Dean resists the urge to point out that it’s impossible to be careful if he had no idea what he’s doing. Sam’s setup takes up the entire coffee table - the  final sigil, sketched out in a mixture of sand, salt, and ground lamb’s liver, doesn’t look like anything Dean has seen up close before. Sam might have made a damn good witch, if he wasn’t such a dyed-in-the-wool hunter. There’s an obvious spot where the sigil is incomplete - a tiny line disconnected. Dean dips his fingers into the sand-mix, only to pull them out again and wipe them on his pants. He pulls his cell phone out of his pocket and sets it on the table. It might not be a traditional method of communicating across the veil, but it’s the one that Cas has been using so far.
- he wants so much that sometimes he can’t even breathe through it. He wants Cas’ hands all over him now, and then he wants to go down to the boardwalk and eat a seafood platter pulled right from the ocean a few feet away, laugh at Jack when he gets butter all over his face, team up with Eileen and threaten Sam with a crab claw. Maybe he even kind of wants to go a million feet up in the air in a stupid tiny basket and see how big the ocean looks, spread out like an enormous blue blanket, butting up against the sky. Then, he wants to come back to the beach house so Cas can fuck him with the sweet ocean breeze coming in through the screen door, and afterwards he’ll lie awake in the dark, listening to the murmur of the water and feeling Cas breathe against his neck, and it might even be the best night of his life, just like last night was the best one before that.
“Shh.” He’s close enough to bump against Castiel now, arm sneaking out to hold Castiel’s hip, bracing rather than restraining. “You know - right? You know I didn’t mean that shit. I shouldn’t have said any of it.”
It makes sense in theory, but Dean can count on one hand all the time theory has actually panned out for them. “How the hell do we get a lock on Cas, though? Even God junior here can’t pull that off.”
Dean exhales into their joined hands again. “Yeah, well I wasn’t planning to stand around outside this long either.” His thumb skates over the bandage, delicate. “How’s the hand?”
Cas palmed the back of his neck, steady, solid. “I will do whatever I can to help you, Dean. I’m happy to do it.”
Cas smiles in that stupidly endearing way that wrinkles up the bridge of his nose. “I already said I would. Now I’m very curious about this Corn Palace.”
, Cas thought, idly. He still forgot sometimes that alcohol was meant to have this kind of intoxicating effect; it could catch him off guard if he wasn’t careful. Still, he made it down the hill, safely, to the bunker’s entrance, let himself in through the massive door...and there he found Dean, sitting perched on one edge of the war table in the semi-dark.
He can feel Cas’ hard-on bump and slide along the crease between his hip and groin, and he arches up so that his own dick rubs against Cas’ belly. Cas muffles a gasp against Dean’s shoulder, so Dean does it again, until Cas is panting - short, desperate breaths. He drags his mouth along Dean’s jaw, sucks on Dean’s lower lip. His hands trace over Dean’s body like he’s learning braille, like he doesn’t already know Dean down to his atoms. He drags the flat of his palm along the length of Dean’s cock where it lies, heavy, against his belly, and Dean groans, helplessly.
again, okay?” He finally pulled the towel away from his face. Cas was scowling at him.
There’s a missed call on his cell when he gets out of the shower, but it turns out to be a hang-up, from an unknown number. Probably a mistake. Dean packs up his gear, has two cups of coffee from the motel room coffee maker, which taste distinctly and familiarly of rust, and then hits the road.  It’s September, and kind of already too cold to be driving with all the windows down, but Dean does it anyway, music blaring, the ashy smell of early autumn filling up the Impala, chasing away the faint smell of grave dirt from last night’s hunt. His back aches a little, but in the satisfying way of a job well done, not in a way that reminds him that he’s getting old, and he drums his hands on the steering wheel to the beat of the music, half-singing along.
,” Dean’s voice cracked. He lifted his head, looking stricken, almost, though his mouth twisted in a fractured smile. “What have I told you about saying that kind of shit?”
“Come to bed, Dean.”  Cas takes his hand, though he doesn’t need to, helps boost him to his feet. Dean feels loose-limbed, warm, slides his arms around Cas, presses his nose not the soft part of Cas’ neck, where he smells sweet and familiar - a little bit of burnt ozone, something metallic, the sandalwood soap from the bathroom.
The chairs and tables were a much longer affair, though Claire and Kaia proved capable assistants, even when Jody appeared halfway through the effort and enlisted Kaia to help decorate the display behind the head table. When they had trouble getting the flowers to stay in the standing trellis, Jack was only too happy to provide his help as well - coaxing the flowers to sprout long spirals of vibrant green vines with a judicious application of grace.
Lilly, predictably, thinks Cas is the greatest person she’s ever met. She shows him all her favourite toys, her leaf collection, her rocks; makes him read her favourite book -
“Sorry,” Dean said almost immediately as Cas came down the stairs. “I was gonna come right back, but I - needed a break, I guess.”
Low, familiar silence settled around them. They watched each other, without speaking; patient, thoughtful. Dean’s hands relaxed and he rubbed his palms down the length of his thighs, measuring the course drag of new denim against his skin. Cas could have let the conversation end there - they might never speak of it again, or it might surface, sometime, on a quiet night while they shared a drink or watched a movie. Now that Dean had it in his mind, he would put it away for a while, but continue to work at it in secret, the way hands worked a ball of clay, into a shape he could recognize.
“Hey - you want a glass of milk and a cookie before you go back to bed?” Dean asks her.
Jack goes quiet after that, just eating his burger. It’s actually a nice day for eating outside, Dean thinks - maybe one of the last really nice days they’re going to get.
But even as he says it, there’s this tiny seed of doubt taking root in his chest. Dean is good at doubt, he always has been.
Cas was, politely, keeping his eyes turned slightly upwards, as if the join of the wall and the ceiling on the other side of the room was extremely interesting. “I’ve never had the opportunity to put it to this exact use, but...I expect it would exceed the endurance of a human partner.
It seemed a very long time before they broke apart, to allow the proper ending to the ceremony, leaving Dean leaning heavily on Cas’s side, tears hidden in Cas’ hair.
“My fist is going to see your face,” Dean grumbles. He’s been scrubbing at the plate in his hands with such ferocity that the towel has just about taken the finish off. “I am
. But no one here would do that; these were friends - his
He swears to himself that he’s just going to look - just going to make sure Cas is still there and that some fucking bizarre complication hasn’t snatched him back to the space between worlds; but when the stip of light falls across the bed, Cas’ eyes snap open.
It was getting bad, he realized. Worse than he thought it would be. It had all seemed like a joke at first - a lust spell? Big fucking deal.
“Don’t you dare.”
“Cas,” Dean’s voice escapes like a sob. He pulls the phone close, cradling it as if that might preserve the tenuous connection. “I’m here Cas. I’m here - where are you?”
“Uncle Dean!” Lilly slams into his legs like a bulldozer, almost knocking Dean on his ass. He drops his bag, gets his legs properly underneath him, and boosts her up into the sky, ignoring the twinge in his shoulder in favour of hearing her laugh before he pulls her in, and plants a smacking kiss on her rosy cheek.
That’s Cas’ answer to everything, lately -
Cas is just climbing back in the car as Dean steps outside. He glances over, bright and joyful, like Dean standing there, wind-ruffled with a crumpled receipt in his hand is the best thing he’s ever seen. Dean’s embarrassment evaporates like a bad dream.
“Honestly? Not very good, Cas.” He was sweating like a cornered nun, and his skin felt about two sizes too small. His balls ached, and where his dick was trapped behind his zipper, Dean could feel it throbbing, leaking into his shorts.
“Shit - yeah, sorry - I didn’t mean to wake you. I just wanted to make sure you were alright.”
He opens his eyes, just in time to see the head of his cock - dark, wet - emerge from the joined tangle of their fingers, and that’s it, Dean’s gone. He might even black out for a second, that’s how fast and hard it hits him. Cas works him through the whole thing, gradually loosening his grip, but never really letting go until Dean squirms and half-heartedly shoves at him, biting back a whine.
“I should let you go back to sleep.” Dean’s pretty exhausted himself. The last couple of days have been a roller coaster. His ears are still buzzing from the roar of Cas’ voice, and he’s still clearing the blood out of his nose.
“I know,” Dean fought against his chattering teeth. His feet were going numb. When he looked down at himself, the sight of his aching dick made him jerk his hips helplessly against nothing. “I know, Cas. I - fuck - you gotta
Sam rolls his eyes, affectionately. “You’re not
Abruptly, the otherwise still air shifted, like a pool disturbed by a falling stone. It was a sensation that Cas was still getting used to experiencing from the perspective of one who has their feet rooted to the earth. “Sorry,” Jack said, appearing just a few paces away near the slumped side of the canopy. “I don’t want to interrupt, but Donna says Sam is having a crisis.”
After a while, he heard Dean approach behind him - familiar footsteps, a huff of breath. An arm slipped around Cas’ waist, and Dean leaned into his shoulder.
Sam flashed him a smile that could be best described as
“Shit,” Dean mutters, and then the room turns sideways.
Dean blushes deep red, shifting awkwardly on his feet and tugs his jacket up. “He done out there yet?”
“And who taught you that, huh?”
.” Sam huffs, folding his arms. “Actually - Eileen and I went on a quick salt-and-burn a couple of weeks ago…”
Dean realizes he’s been staring a little too long, and pries his sticky tongue off the roof of his mouth. “What’re you waiting for, Cas?”
“Oh.” Of course he would.
“As someone who lives on the planet? Yeah, I think so.”
heard you. We’re gonna find you, wherever you are; you just gotta give us a sign. Anything at all, anything you can do so we know you’re there.”
Cas looks at him - furrowed brow, slight frown. Dean’s missed that look. “It seemed like a good idea at the time.”
Dean shrugs. What’s he supposed to say, that he misses the kid? Sam must know that he does. “I know he’s out there ‘finding himself’ and all - getting the hang of being G-O-D - but would it kill him to stop by for a Sunday dinner once and awhile?”
Dean finally conquers the stubborn knot in Cas’ drawstring, and shoves his trunks down. Cas steps out of them as they fall around his ankles and climbs into Dean’s lap, takes Dean’s face in both of his good, strong hands, and leans in to kiss him.
“I think you’re doing just fine.” Cas bumps his forehead against Dean’s temple, his mouth against the line of Dean’s jaw. “We do always seem to figure things out. Eventually.”
“I - I don’t know. It’s dark.” There’s a low, persistent hiss on the line, and Cas’ voice rises, falls, with the half-broken connection. There’s a fierce, distinct bolt of pain behind Dean’s left eye that he ignores.
“You know I didn’t mean it,” Dean prods, gently, emboldened now. “Or you know I shouldn’t have said it?”
.” Dean wraps his free hand around the slats in the headboard, slick palm slipping on cool metal. Droplets of sweat shine on the column of Cas’ neck, and moisture curls his sun-bleached hair. He drags his palm down the center of Dean’s chest, over his belly, smiling huge and beautiful, and that’s it - somehow that’s all Dean needs, not even a hand properly around his dick, just the unbridled joy on Cas’ flushed face to push him over the edge into shaking oblivion.
Dean laughed, pressing a kiss to his temple. “Okay. Cuz you know, Sam’s the one who’s supposed to have the jitters. He’s getting married.”
“I have faith in your stamina,” Cas says, unshakable.
Around noon, he’s lucky enough to find a busy truck stop - the place packed enough that the food has got to be decent - and picks up two burgers, each with a side of fries, stretching his legs in the parking lot while he waits for them to cook up the order. A young guy in a ball cap pauses on his way inside, flashes Dean a smile.
“Any good?”
it was Cas?”
as Dean called it still required effort - just effort of a different sort.
“No,” Lilly sighs dramatically, as if Jack’s absence weighs on her. “But Daddy says he’s very, very busy.”
Cas without his clothes on is - well, he’s a lot. Hell, even with his clothes on, he’s at least two-thirds of all the guilty fantasies that Dean’s ever had in his life. Suddenly, it feels like the room doesn’t have nearly enough oxygen in it. Dean’s head spins. The backs of his knees hit the edge of the bed before he realises he’s stepped backwards, and he sits down so fast that a surprised bark of laughter escapes his throat. Cas hesitates for a second, then grins - huge and glorious - and bears down on Dean like a hurricane.
- what -
They spend most of their time just relaxing, moving around each other like a complicated dance. They take Lilly to the park, run as many errands as Eileen and Sam will trust them with, go on long drives, and watch too much TV. Cas and Jack go on long walks, or spend hours sitting in the backyard, talking.
Which is rich, considering Dean has spent most of his life careening from one disaster to another.
“Yeah,” a slow, huge smile spread over Dean’s face. “It’s good though. It’s good. They’re happy. That’s what I always wanted for him, ya know?”
Dean waves him off. “Forget it, okay? And yeah - it was him. I’m sure it was.”
- the ones he’s started wearing since he decided he wanted to make a go of a real life on Earth, and Dean insisted he needed more than one pair of socks and underwear to go along with his new life. Without the trench coat constantly hanging off of him like a brown paper bag, it’s so much more obvious how broad his shoulders are compared to his waist, how much strength there is in his arms. Dean thinks about it a lot.
“You don’t have to explain yourself to me.”
Cas waved them off. “Please - continue. They’ll be fine.”
The sliding door opens behind him with a low whisper as it hisses along the track. Dean doesn’t bother to turn around - he knows it’s Cas, by the shift in the air, by the quiet footfalls, by the warmth against his arm as Cas comes to stand next to him at the rail.
“I heard your voice,” Cas says, quiet. Dean would be embarrassed about how it sounds, except he just wants to keep hearing Cas’ voice. He never wants to stop hearing it. He wishes his heart would stop pounding so damned hard so he could hear it better. “But I can’t see - I don’t know where I am.”
“Cas -
On the word
The night quickly came alive with laughter and music. Tables were moved to make way for a sort of impromptu dance floor in the grass, and people clustered together, talking, drinking. Cas lingered near the edge of the canopy, watching the scene, nursing a beer; enjoying the whole thing more by osmosis than participation.
Cas grumbles about it, but he forces himself to let Dean go.  Still, once they’re tucked in bed, he curls in as close to Dean as possible, presses himself against Dean’s back like he wants to crawl inside Dean’s skin; and yeah -
Dean’s heart skips two full beats. He has to stop and catch his breath, and Cas is left to finish undressing himself, but he doesn’t seem to mind.
The ocean goes on forever.
“I like hearing you say that,” he murmurs. He slips his fingers under Cas’ shirt at the back, up the divot of his spine, and Cas shivers against him. “You wanna go to bed with me, Cas?”
. This was fucking dangerous.
The way Cas gasps his name as he comes -
, I will haunt you
“Holy shit Cas…” This is about to be the shortest race he’s ever run - but the way Cas surges against him, licks into his panting mouth, drags blunt fingernails down Dean’s back, how the hell can he stop himself? He slides against the warm, perfect groove of Cas’ hip, gets a hand between them, around Cas’ cock, and lets himself fall apart.
Sam’s teeth click. He sighs. Dean watches his sock feet tap against the rug. It’s time, he figures, to make a tactical attempt to change the subject. He doesn’t want this to get to the point where he’s gotta bail; he promised to tuck Lilly in.
Sam laughs, “And? Eileen killed a ghoul when she was six months pregnant. Hell - if not for that wraith in El Paso, Lilly wouldn’t even exist.”
without meaning it, and drag himself along by his teeth. He pulled Cas closer, into an awkward, but enthusiastic half spin. Cas only barely managed not to step on his toes, laughing helplessly.
through the screen door. Lilly’s had him read it so many times that he must have it memorized by now.
Cas’ hands fold over his own. “With me you haven’t.”
“You used to think the same thing about us.”
“I know.”
“I’d like to create some more angels, but I have no idea how.”
Not that he doesn’t look good in Dean’s pants.
“Hello Lilly,” Jack says; then, to Dean. “Was it really him?”
Sam looks at him, silently for a moment. Dean knows exactly what he’s doing - weighing the pros and cons of pushing harder, trying to see if he can guess when Dean will crack. In the end, he backs down. This time. “Yeah - he stopped by a little while ago. Why?”
Dean watches his little brother lower himself into the battered recliner and braces himself for the inevitable. “So how is -”
“I would never say that.”
“Look, Cas - I’m a dragon!” Lilly plants her feet in the dry, crackling grass, and throws her head back in an exaggerated roar, exhaling a great cloud of silver-spun breath into the grey winter sky. “Try it!”
“Yeah?”
Cas is mostly under the blankets, his ridiculous bed head poking out like some kind of over-enthusiastic brush plant. “I do, a little,” he mumbles, his arm still tight across Dean’s chest, his breath warm against Dean’s shoulder.
But he doesn’t want to know the answer.
Sleep hits him like a ton of bricks, and Dean doesn’t wake up until the next morning, to the sound of Sam’s voice saying -
“You sure? Cuz you’re spaced out with a mallet in your hand and it’s kinda freaking me out right now.”
Dean buries his face in the pillow, and tries to sleep. The ambient noise of the house pushes through, every time he gets close to the edge of unconsciousness - pipes clicking, Sam snoring in the next room, the soft buzz of the alarm clock on the bedside table eating up electricity, the occasional creak of the house, settling on its foundations. Finally, he gives up, grabbing his phone of the charger, figuring he could scan through the news, or play a few rounds of Candy Crush to settle his brain; instead, he ends up with the phone in his hand, staring at the lit-up screen, thoughtlessly tapping through apps, knowing where he’s going to end up, but pretending it isn’t going to happen.
“Well then,” Dean gave the tie a final tug to straighten it, and clapped Sam twice on the chest. “Stop worrying so much about it. Right?”
Dean took a quick step sideways out of reach, swallowing the lump in his throat. “I’d better - ya know - get dressed.” He had his hand on the doorknob when Sam called his name. Cautiously, Dean turned back. “Yeah?”
when Jack adds another theme park to his increasingly long list of places they should visit; or - and this is probably Dean’s favourite, even if he won’t admit it -
“No,” Castiel laughs, “it’s an answer.”
“Hello?” Static. Dean sits up on instinct, as if the very slight change in altitude might improve his reception. “Hello?”
Dean bristles. “Well. She’s worth it.”
“Uh-huh.”
know. Which was exactly why he’d told Sam, at the beginning of this monumental screw up,
Jack still looks mostly like he did the last time Dean saw him - maybe six months ago at Lilly’s birthday party. In fact, he still looks mostly like he did five years ago - same shirt, same jacket, same jeans. Dean can’t judge - it’s not like his wardrobe is exactly bursting these days - but it reminds him how distinctly not human Jack is now; that he doesn’t need to shower, or change his clothes, or even really to eat, though he still does it, probably because he enjoys it.
Sam gets to the hospital as soon as he can and he finds Cas by Dean’s bed, holding his hand.
–He says with a smirk.
“Everyone?”
“Dean, since the moment he met you he’s done everything for you. He’s always been there for you. Why does it surprise you?”
He sees Dean suppressing a yawn and rearranges him so they are both lying down with their heads on the pillow.
"Not really, but there’s Dean. He was the most important thing to him. Do you think it will work with a person?"
Drink.
Dean:
Dean nuzzles his face in Cas’ neck and groans.
, he sobs, “
“Okay, yeah, but... How did they get here?”
After expending what felt like days talking to everyone and sharing stories, Cas took his hand and led him outside, where he showed him Baby parked on the driveway.
Cas and Sam are in Dean’s hospital room. They had to make sure that no one would interrupt them, so they had to wait until visiting hours were over.
Dean smiles and gets in.
Cas looks at him with a frown and turns back to the new guys.
The screen is frozen with Cas’ face in clear view.
The Empty looks at him and realizes what’s happening.
He disappears for a second just to come back with the necklace in his hand.
"But I’ve been awful to you."
"Dean, I do. I understand. You had feelings for him."
Dean is in the hallway again. He hates this place. He’s reliving his worst memories over and over again. He doesn’t think he can handle this for much longer. After the door to Hell... he thought he would finally break but then he heard Cas’ voice.
“That might take a while”
“I wish I had a version of you in my world”
He feels his eyes tearing up, but he can’t break down.
“I understand, Dean”
Dean comes back from the kitchen and he sees other Dean taking Cas’ hand in his.
Cas gasps and looks wide-eyed at him.
"Dean, let’s try this. It will just be a minute."
He throws an empty beer bottle to the wall.
“He did. He- Nevermind. He did”
“And I will spend my life making you understand how much I love you and that you deserve some happiness”
: * : * : * :
He stands up while letting out an anguished scream of Cas’ name and throws another bottle across the room.
Dean lets out a breath in relief and puts a hand on his shoulder.
“Cas, trust me. It will help”
“When you are done playing tonsil hockey, we think we found something”, tells them other Sam.
“In the barn, after Ramiel. I thought I was dying and I needed to tell you”
He tries to see what is the last thing he remembers but no luck, he's confused.
“I told you! I’m so happy for you!”
“Hell, no. You just said our universe is being destroyed. We are not going back”, complains other Dean.
“Well, yes. That was… It was… special, but that was years ago”
Cas looks at Sam, deep in thought.
Dean is shocked. He remembers that day. Dad had been gone for weeks and their only contact had been a few phone calls giving him orders, as usual. Bobby had took pity on him and took him to play to a playground; it was the first time he played baseball and the only time he played with a father figure like a normal kid.
"Dean."
, he says as he offers him his hand, “
“That’s kind of cute”, he whispers as he puts his arms around his neck, “I’ve been thinking about you too. When you said... when you told me you loved me, it made me rethink every moment we’ve had. Specially this last year. I- I’m so sorry about everything I’ve said or done”
"Cas? You know Cas? How?"
Eventually, sleep takes over, but it isn’t a peaceful sleep. His brain keeps replaying that moment over and over again, even in his sleep. Specially in his sleep.
Sam and Dean are doing research in the library when they hear a loud noise in the map room. When they get there they see a blue Fiat 500 and... is that Sam? and Dean? What the fuck?
He doesn’t think he will be able to get through more of this awful moments in his life.
. Hell, maybe that’s why he didn’t look for me the whole year I was in Purgatory.
, he hears Sam calling from the hallway.
“Please, Cas. It’s- it’s important”
Once Dean and Cas get back, they all get ready for the spell. Other Sam and Dean say goodbye to everyone
Sam takes the amulet from his pocket and holds it in between their hands as he pulls him in a hug.
"I could try, but it will take time. We can’t do it here."
“He- He’s gone”
“Cas?”
He goes back into the hallway, falls to his knees and starts sobbing.
“Dean”, Sam calls at his door, “I know you want to be alone, but I need to talk to you”
Once in the hallway, Dean starts to process what he has experienced in there.
: * : * : * :
“But the Empty-“
“He’s not here. He’s not here. He’s gone. You saw him. You saw that thing take him away. He’s gone. He’s gone...”
“Of course. If you’ll have me”
"I’m glad to finally meet you", he says as he hugs him.
He doesn’t drop his hand until they get to them and Sam crushes him into a hug.
“You’re not losing me, Cas. I’m still alive and kicking”
“Yes, a while ago we were stuck there for a year. So it was... hard. And it was even harder with how bad things were between us. But there’s something about that place, it kind of heightens your feelings but at least we talked. He blamed me for leaving and I blamed him for not stopping me. And then we got separated and”, he smiles, “he prayed to me. He’s not a fan of praying and it had been years since he had prayed to me, so it felt... I had missed his prayers. He said he was sorry and that he knew he should have stopped me and I know he meant it. He’s been really trying to keep his anger under control and he is starting to trust me again but...”, he sighs.
Dean:
“You’re infuriating, Dean. You’re so frustrating. You never say what you feel. Or what you really want. You’ve treated me like I mean nothing to you. You broke my heart. And you've hurt me. You've done things that still make me get angry at you”
“Okay, after we rescue Sammy”
Cas kisses him softly and leans away.
. Ever since he took him out of the fire that has been his reason for living.
Dean:
Cas takes them to the Impala and Dean drives until Cas tells him to stop.
Cas feels a wave of rage and he turns to look Dean in the eye. At his harsh stare, Dean takes a few steps back.
Dean looks up again and hugs him tight.
“Cas! How- I can’t believe it! You’re back!”
Jack smiles and offers his hand. The Empty scoffs and flick his hand before it turns around and leaves.
“Dean… I didn’t- You never told me”, Cas says in a quiet voice.
He leans away and lets Jack give him a hug.
“I didn’t confess my feelings! I just... I... Okay, fine. But I would’ve realize my feelings sooner or later”
He takes the box from Cas’ hands and opens it, giving it back to him. Cas looks inside and sees an id card.
“Castiel Win- Castiel Winchester”
Dean shoves him out the door while Sam struggles.
"I know, Sam. I will."
“Jack. He got me out and asked my help in restoring Heaven. We’ve created the Heaven you deserve, although I wasn’t expecting you to enjoy it so soon”
“Well, yes, but it’s our home. Our family and friends are there. We want to be with them”
Dean wakes up on the floor of a house he has never in before. He gets up and goes into a corridor with many doors.
. And then he said that you were the only being in all the universes he couldn’t control and I felt like a fucking dick. All the things I said... I’m so sorry, Cas”
“He doesn’t”, he scoffs, “until recently he hated me”
"I love you too, Dean."
He finds himself in a playing yard but how is it possible? He looks around and sees a little boy that reminds him of himself. A man wearing an old cap approaches the kid and, when he turns, Dean recognizes him.
“I don’t know”
“About time!”, sighs Sam.
“You didn’t. When?”
Dean still can’t believe he is gone. He can’t be. He always comes back. He just got him back and he already lost him. It’s like a sick joke. Every time he gets him back and thinks that everything is going to be okay, something or someone takes him away from him.
Drink.
“There’s more”
Dean reaches for his hand and they go in. Everything looks like that night all those years ago. Even the sigils are in place.
Cas kisses him one last time before standing up and offering his hand to him.
They look at each other and they burst out laughing.
Sam goes inside, looking for the Nephilim. He’s trying not to think about what just happened. He knows he should stay with Dean and comfort him, but he doesn’t have the strength at the moment. He goes into the master room and sees Kelly’s body on the bed; she looks so peaceful. He hears a noise coming from the corner of the room. He gets closer and sees a young man in his 20s sitting on the floor with his knees to his chest and his head on his knees. The boy senses him and looks up, his golden eyes staring with curiosity into Sam.
“I admit that our last moments together were rather... rushed. But I thought you could find closure in our conversation. That it would make it easier to keep on living”
Dean blushes in embarrassment, both for his behavior and for Jack bringing Cas back just for him.
“Cas, man. We need to talk about this. What I said… My prayer… I need to know you understand”
Dean is in his room. It’s been almost 5 hours now since his conversation with Sam. At first he was pissed but, eventually, his anger became guilt. He screwed up, again. He had gotten another friend dead, again. Why does this keep happening to him? He loses everyone he cares about, literally everyone. First was mum, then dad, Sammy, Ellen, Jo, Cas, Bobby, Kevin… The list goes on and on, and it never ends.
Dean looks up and his face must be a mess, ‘cause he can feel Sam worry even more. He’s about to try to explain everything that happened when he sees Jack enter the room.
Sam looks at his brother, but no words come out of his mouth. But he has to try again.
Drink.
“I just wish I had realized sooner”
“We don’t know”, tells them other Sam, “We were driving when suddenly we appeared here. What’s going on? Who’s Chuck? And what do you mean other universes?”
Cas' voice sounds broken as he speaks.
"I know you miss him, but we are going to bring him back. We’ll find a way. But right now, you need to be strong."
When they reach the kitchen, they are glad to find it empty and they move to prepare breakfast, Cas taking care of the coffee while Dean cooks some bacon and eggs. They sit in the table, side by side and Dean can’t stop smiling. He takes every chance he sees to steal a kiss from Cas. Afterwards, when they are doing the dishes, he hugs Cas from behind and places a kiss on his neck. Cas turns the water off and turns around, placing his arms around his neck and reaching up to kiss him.
The Empty looks at him full of rage, but it knows that there’s nothing it can do.
, he says with a huge smile, “
“Hello, Dean”
Drink.
“Hello! I’m Jack. How did you guys get here?”
“How couldn’t I? You’re-“
“Well, I had a great time. I really missed them. It felt good to see everyone again. Though I wished... well not really. But I missed Sam too”
With that, Sam turns to leave the hospital room but, before he leaves, he stops by the door to look at the laying form of his brother.
“Cas… All this time… You- You’ve been telling me, showing me, for years and I just… I was too much of a dumbass to understand”
"That’s fine. We have a bunker. We can go there."
Now is Sam’s turn to look wide eyed at his brother. He didn’t think that his brother would admit it. He thought he would have to convince him or something.
Sam nods in agreement.
Drink.
, Dean’s shoulders fall and any hope he felt is gone in a second.
“Hello, Dean. Sam”, Cas stops as he sees the other Sam and Dean, “Uh. Hello? What’s going on?”
“Wow, Cas. That was...”
Well, it seems like he isn’t getting any sleep tonight. He sits in the bed and looks at the nightstand. There’s the picture of his mother, but he can’t look at it. It hurts too much. He can’t stay here. Why would he? He thought this was his home, but without Kevin and with Sammy hating him, he doesn’t have a home anymore. He can’t stay in the bunker. Too many memories. Too many regrets. He decides to go downtown.
“Sam?”
Dean hears his brother and, even though he doesn’t want to talk to anybody, this is his little brother. And he needs him. He needs to be there for him. Slowly, he turns his head, his hands never leaving Cas’ face.
“Hey, now I know”
With this, he starts thinking of who can help him with this. Cas obviously can't, or won't, he'll stay with Dean until he wakes up, but perhaps there's someone else who can help him.
“That’s awesome, man. Last time I faced a djinn… I got trapped”, he takes a sip of his beer, “hm, what would you have dreamed if you’d gotten caught?”
. He lost count of how many times he’s tried already.
"Do you think you could bring Cas back?", he asks, finally feeling some kind of hope.
“I- I love you, Cas. But I don’t deserve you-”
Nobody's there but he can still hear the voice.
Dean is standing still, eyes watering, watching as his brother’s world crashes down. That was one of the worst feelings he’s ever experienced. The feeling of incapacity, of not being able to help his little brother.
“You heard me. Last night. Dean...”
Meanwhile, Cas sits in his bed and other Dean crouches at his feet.
“I don’t think you realise what you mean to me. I have no one, literally no one, besides you and Sam. Everyone I know is dead or I know through you. The only one I have is Claire and she still finds it awkward that I’m using his father as a vessel. So… if I lose you… I'm alone”
Dean lets out another sob and tries to speak.
There’s another knock and he gets up and opens the door to scream at his annoying little brother but, as soon as he opens the door, he falls to his knees and buries his face on his hands.
“Dean”, Cas tries to explain, but Dean interrupts him before he can say anything.
He looks in the kitchen, in the shooting range, in the garage and, finally, in his room. It seems empty. He looks around and finds that there’re a lot of things missing –clothes, weapons…–.
"I guess she is going to Heaven. She will be alright there. She’ll be at peace."
“And I know that you probably don’t feel the same and that you hate me right now just, please, don’t- don’t leave again. Let’s forget I said anything, we’ll just-”
. He puts a hand on his cheek and leans closer until he can feel Cas’ breath. Cas looks at him and puts a hand on his neck to pull him down for a kiss.
"Let’s try!
“I’ll take him off your hands”
He walks a few steps towards him before stopping again.
“Ehem. Well, we’ll figure out what to do”, states Sam.
He keeps hearing the same muffled noises from before but he doesn't know where they come from.
“He must be, for you to be his friend”
“Please, please, don’t leave again. I don’t- I’m not sure I can survive it. I’ll do anything. I’ll behave just, please, stay. Stay. Stay. Stay with me. Please. Please-”
“I’m sorry it took me so long. I’m sorry it took me this long to understand. I’m so sorry. I love you. I love you so m-”
Dean leans away to look at him, but stays in his arms.
Cas cleans the tears running down Dean’s cheeks with his thumbs and smiles.
"Dean?", he says as he enters the room, "Dean, how ar-"
“I will never, ever, push you away again. This is your home and we’re your family. I am your family. I need you”
Dean is still on the floor next to Cas, but now he is sitting with Cas’ head on his lap. He’s running his fingers through his hair and over his face, both of their faces wet from his tears.
The video keeps playing on repeat on the table but he doesn’t have the strength to turn it off.
–Sam looks down in guilt–
Sam finds himself in a long hallway full of doors.
"Jack?"
“Cas”, he groans, “I’m- I’m close”
Cas is seating by Dean's bed, holding his hand. He's been like this for three days, talking softly to Dean in hope that he's is able to hear him and wakes up. Sam has been visiting him every day but he can't stand staying long, every time he sees Dean laying there, in the bed, he feels too guilty, so he's trying to look for a way of waking him up.
anymore.
“Don’t open it yet. I need you to hear me first. Having the other... me here, it made me realize that... that I- fuck”, he stops and whispers, “
Dean:
“Hey!”
Dean kisses his forehead, his temple, his eyelids, his nose, his cheeks and when he reaches his lips he pulls away enough to look into his eyes.
Drink.
He presses play again but it doesn’t work.
Dean looks down. He hates that Cas won't talk to him. Not like he used to. He misses it, misses him.
“Well, first of, you’re gonna have to lose the manbun”
“Dean”
“He doesn’t love me”, he scoffs, “I’m just a tool to him. And now, without my powers, I’m of no use to him. Why would he keep me around? I’m broken”
He thinks of all the “moments” they’ve shared. So many moments that could have turned into something else if he wasn’t such a coward. If he didn’t choose to bury his feelings. Maybe Sammy was right and he should talk to Cas. Make him understand before it’s too late. With that in mind, he leaves his room and goes to Cas’ but, when he gets there, he hears voices inside. It’s Cas and other Dean.
“I’ll let you know when Jack gets back”
“Cas, I kno-”
They stay in silence for a few minutes, until Dean decides to bring up the elephant in the room.
“I was there when it happened”
“Dean, it’s okay. I’m okay. I’m here. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry”
Jack looks at Dean and he nods.
“Guys, stop. This must be Chuck”, says Sam looking at Dean, “didn’t Billy say that he was destroying all the other universes?”
Cas turns his head and kisses one of Dean’s hands. Dean gasps and he can’t wait anymore, so he launches forward and kisses him.
“I don’t think I can take it if he gets mad again. Seeing the hate in his eyes. It nearly broke me last time. I don’t-”, he starts tearing up again, “I don’t really have anyone else. Sam and Dean and Jack, they are my family, my only friends. If he- If Dean pushes me away I don’t have anywhere to go”
“Okay”, he sighs.
Dean smiles too and kisses him again.
“Dean. Dean! Breathe! Calm down. You’re hyperventilating. Breathe with me. In… out… in… out...”
This past week he hasn’t been able to get more than a few hours of sleep. Every time he closes his eyes he sees Kevin. The kid didn’t deserve to die. He shouldn’t have had to go through any of this. Just because of that ‘
"Who’s Cas?"
Dean looks at Cas in the eyes and, slowly, brushes their lips together. When he leans away, Cas puts a hand on his neck and pushes him in into another kiss. This time is deeper, desperate, trying to show how much they love each other.
He makes to get up but is stopped by a hand on his wrist.
“Cas, you need to let this out. You should talk to Dean”, he can see the panic in Cas’ face, “okay, I get it. Tell me, then. I’m basically him. I’ll listen”
Jack looks at him with worry.
–He runs his fingers through his hair and down his cheek–
“How can you… How can you doubt I feel the same? I told you. I told you I loved you, in the barn, remember?”
He hears a noise coming from the hallway. It’s probably Sammy and Jack, but he doesn’t even try to get up.
Sam leaves and Dean sees Jack approaching.
Cas stares at Dean, trying to analyze what is going on in his head. He sees that Dean is hurting, but it doesn't make sense.
“Go away, Sam!”
“We’ll explain everything later, but first we need to figure out why you’re here and how to send you back”
He looks at him for a few second, trying to figure out if it's a trick.
Cas stands there and they look at each other, both not daring to believe that this is real.
. He’s not so sure there’s an
He hears a loud laugh and sees Cas and himself coming out of the building.
“Dean…”
“Cas”, he says before rolling over and sitting on Cas’ lap.
"But we have to go to the bunker. So come on. Let’s go! I can help you carry the body-"
“Fine! Take him. Leave and let me sleep”
Dean leans up and kisses him. He intended for it to be a short peck, but when he feels Cas’ tongue on his lips he can’t help but lean in closer.
: * : * : * :
A door appears in front of him and he walks into the hallway. There, he falls to his knees and starts sobbing loudly.
Dean doesn’t even try to stop the tears this time, he just takes Cas’ face in his hands and smiles.
The other Sam and Dean gasp in horror and Sam laughs. Jack laughs too and Cas is smiling.
“You’re not broken. You’re amazing and he’s so lucky to have you. I wish I had someone like you”
“How- You-”
"She’s going to Heaven? How’s that poss-"
Dean:
They look at each other for a few seconds until they realise they have less than 2 minutes to get back. Cas turns and starts walking towards the portal. Dean stays behind for a second, regarding Cas with a puzzled look.
“I- I couldn’t… cope with your- with you being gone. Sam kept trying to help, being nice and letting me do all these things I do that I know annoy him so much. But it didn’t matter ‘cause you were gone. I was so angry, so fucking angry, and all I could do was try to drink my pain away. So, when I- Sam and I were on a case… some ghosts terrorising kids and we couldn’t find them so I… it was for the case, at least that’s what I told Sam… so I ki- killed myself”, Dean lowers his head in shame.
"I love you. I love you. So damn much. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry..."
At first, he can’t find anything but then, he finds the memory of the conversation Dean and Sam had in the kitchen. Now he understands why Dean thought he had to leave like that. He decides to confront Sam about it.
. He had intended for it to be sweet and short, but suddenly he finds himself laying on the floor with a lap full of Cas.
Cas lets go of Sam and gets out of his personal space.
Dean hears a knock at his door, but no one is calling his name.
He breaths deeply and continues.
"Don’t try to deny it, Dean. I know you. I saw how you two acted around each other. You cared about him. You liked him. You-"
Cas hugs him back and tries to calm him down.
After a few minutes he hears them call out for him. For him and Cas. He feels the tears fall down his cheeks again and he sobs. Sam must have heard him, ‘cause he opens the door and stops as soon as he sees him.
He goes back to his room and sits on the bed, staring at the floor. He can’t stop replaying Cas’ last words, over and over again.
“Why are we here?”
“Hey, kid”
“What do you want, Dean?”
"I don’t know. But I don’t want to sleep. I need to check on you. I need to know that you’re okay. That you...", he’s stopped by another yawn.
Cas sits by Dean’s bed holding his hand. It’s been two weeks and Dean hasn’t shown signs of waking up. He hasn’t left his side the whole time and he doesn’t plan to.
“Okay”
“Cas”, he repeats.
Drink.
Dean looks up and hugs him. Sam holds him and tries to calm him down.
"You- You do?"
“I can fly us there”
“Who the fuck are you?”, asks Dean.
I know this is outdated, but didn't like leaving this story unfinished so, here it is.
"I understand you, Dean. I know you never meant any of it. I’ve hurt you too."
He falls to his knees with a broken sob and stays silently crying for a few minutes.
“No, it’s okay. I get it. He’s perfect. I just- I hope he makes you happy. You deserve it”
He looks around looking for the person who said that.
He looks up and Cas is looking at him with a frown on his
“I will spend my whole life showering you with all the love and respect you deserve”
He sighs and looks away when he sees Sam’s bitchface.
"Shh... Sammy. Let it out. Let it all out."
“Right, because you weren’t about to burst and hit the other you”
"Relax. I’ll tell you anything you want. Just, try to relax."
"Lucifer’s my dad?! What? That can’t be possible."
Cas pulls him into a hug and flies them to a house similar to Bobby’s.
“No!”, says Dean.
“Why does it feel like he hates me? I’m him, kind of”
"I loved him, Sammy."
He doesn’t even try to stop the tears running down his face.
“I’m sure your life is better without me in it”
Dean finds himself in his room at Bobby’s. He looks around and sees a younger version of himself sitting in the bed, a bottle of whiskey on his hand and a piece of clothing on the other, but he can’t see what it is.
, asks Dean before they tell him about the plan.
"You saw the future? How- Never mind that. Lucifer, your father, he... he- he killed him. Just outside the house."
“Let me say this then. I love you, Dean Winchester. I never thought I would be able to say it out loud, but I do. I’ve felt his way for many years. You’re the most important person in the world and I will stay by your side, if you let me”
Sam opens it and it’s another girly toy.
“I’ll go with you”, says Dean.
Drink.
And then he leans in, sealing their lips together in a kiss full of love and emotion. He can’t stop the tears falling down his face. Cas wipes them out with his hand and leans his forehead against Dean’s.
: * : * : * :
Other Dean squeezes his hand, letting him know that he can continue and that he’s listening.
“I don’t… I don’t know what to say. You’re right. I know you are but… I mean, I have told you how important you are to me. I must have… I’m sure I… There’s no way I didn’t…”
"I know, Sammy. I know", he says with a broken voice.
“Thanks for opening up to me, Dean”
...”, he says as he flicks his fingers.
Cas' eyes seem about to cry but then, in a second, his stare hardens and any track of hurt is gone, a blank expression taking place.
“For now. But I know that what you really want is to go to sleep. So I’ll make you a deal. You let me take Cas back and we leave you alone. If you refuse, I’ll keep waking him up. For eternity. You’ll never sleep again. Your choice”
Dean looks up and the moment his eyes connect with Cas’ he puts his arms around his neck and buries his face on his shoulder.
With that, Sam turns to his book again. Cas decides to go looking for Dean.
“No, no. Who the fuck are you?”, answers other Dean.
Dean chuckles.
He sobs and tries to turn his head again to look at Cas, but Sam forces his face so he is looking at him again.
: * : * : * :
They are laying in bed, Dean sleeping with his head on Cas’ chest and his arm across his torso, when Cas feels it. Sam has arrived.
"I killed her? Where is she?"
“Don’t listen to Dean. We will help you”
“Come on, dude, you must know”
“I understand. You don’t need to worry. But we have to get back, there’s someone who really needs to see you”
“I didn’t tell anyone. No one knew”
Dean approaches him and puts his hand on his shoulder.
Cas tries to dry his tears but he can't stop crying, so he turns his face from Dean.
“So, Castiel, right?”, asks the other Dean.
: * : * : * :
The moment he hears Cas' voice, he launches himself onto Cas and pushes him onto the floor with the force of his embrace.
“It was the deal, right? He finally told you”, he asks with a sad look.
"No, Cas, no."
Sam gets to the bunker and sits in his favorite chair in the library. He covers his face with his hands and sighs.
Dean:
Tears start welling in his eyes again and he knows that if he keeps talking, his voice will break, so he turns his head.
“Can I look the inventory to see if there’s a spell that can help us?”
“He’ll be here when his time comes. But as I said, time is different here, so it won’t feel as long for you”
“Let’s go, then”
Drink.
face. Looking into his eyes, he gets the push he needs to keep (start) talking.
“I missed you so much”, he says as he hugs her again.
Sam gets a little bit nervous, as he’s not used to Cas’ stares, that’s more Dean’s thing.
Dean keeps crying and he doesn’t look at his brother.
“I know, Dean. But I feel like it was always in the middle of a world-ending crisis, never because you wanted to tell me. It was basically forced out of you. And you’ve pushed me away so many times…”
He cups Cas’ face and wipes away the tears that fall from his eyes.
"So I have powers?"
“Dean, what is this?”
Cas is now breathing heavily and Dean still doesn’t know what to say. He knows he fucked up big time.
. Instead, he goes to his room but, on his way there, he passes by Cas’ room. He enters and sees that it’s empty.
“Jack? What- What are you doing here?”
“I don’t want to talk about it”
“Then why does it seem like you’re still mad at me?”
Dean looks up and he launches himself at Cas.
“He didn’t. He told me... He said that what he knew he couldn’t have what he wanted”, he says as tears form in his eyes, “He thought that I didn’t...”
Dean looks at him in surprise.
He feels tears forming in his eyes and he moves his hand to caress his cheek.
Dean takes Cas’ hand over the table and just smiles.
He chooses a random door to open and goes in.
“No, it’s not! It’s not okay! You died, Cas. You died and I… I wanted to die with you. Hell, I basically did”
“It’s a surprise. You’ll see”
“Know what?”, Cas sighs.
"No, you don’t have to. We can manage on our own. But try to get some rest. You need it."
"No, it’s not! It’s not okay! You died, Cas. You died! You died and I couldn’t- I didn’t- Please, don’t do it again."
"Dean. Please, look at me. I need you to look at me. I- Please, I need to tell you something. It’s important. Don’t shut me down. I know you are feeling broken and you are hurting, but don’t shut me down. I need you here."
Cas tried to pull away from the hug, but Dean forced him back against his chest.
: * : * : * :
“What is your problem, Dean?”
He starts walking down the corridor and realizes that he can't see its end.
Sam gets up and heads to Dean’s room. He doesn’t know how he will find his brother.
“He loves you too”
“Don’t worry. It’s endearing”
“Come on, Cas. Come on”
"Come in", he says without taking his eyes from Cas.
A frown appears on the boy’s face when he hears his name.
“What the heck?”, say both Sams at once.
Dean buries his face in his neck and holds him tighter. After a while, he manages to control his tears and leans back so he can look at Cas.
Sam looks at Dean and they both get up and go to the hallway but, while Sam heads to the library, Dean stops at his room to check on Cas.
Once in the hallway, he tries to take control of his emotions but tears keep running down his cheeks. He takes a deep breath and dries his face with the sleeve of his flannel.
“Okay. I need to say this, Cas. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry about… everything. I took it all out on you, and it’s not fair. I know that. I just… This anger… I can’t control it. I don’t-”
“Here. I’ll stay here, give you some privacy”
“Purgatory?”
"I’ll need you to stay close but you can’t touch him."
He sees the both of them running down the hallway towards the dungeon and he swears he can still feel Cas’ arm on his shoulder, but when he looks to his right he’s alone. Just empty space beside him. When he gets to the part where they are trapped in the dungeon he feels the tears fall down his face again, although they never stopped, so he doesn’t even try to stop them now.
At this, Cas turns around and looks at Sam with a hard look.
Dean can’t hold it in any longer, and he lets out a loud sob and jumps on the bed to hug Cas.
Drink.
“No problem, angel”
Dean stares at his brother, who gets nervous.
"Dean... He’s gone..."
And with that, they leave Dean and Cas alone, closing the door behind them.
They look around for Cas but he’s not there. Before they can say anything, Jack turns towards the hallway.
“Then you know we have to beat him. And then, once he’s gone, we will bring Cas back. We’ll find a way”
“Where are we? It looks familiar”
”, asks Sam,
Cas reaches for his hand and holds it tight.
"Cas! It worked!", says Sam as he hugs him, "You’re really back!"
Cas puts his free hand on Dean’s cheek and leans forward until their lips touch. Then Dean pulls at his hand and they stand up.
Cas stares at him, taken by surprise and trying to figure out what he should tell him.
"Okay."
“And then, when I tried to talk to you one last time, you blamed me for basically everything that’s gone wrong in your life. And still, you dare to get mad because I left. What did you expect me to do? I couldn’t stand being your punching bag anymore!”
. He looks over at Cas and rans a hand over his cold cheek. He hears the crying sound again but this time it sounds familiar.
Drink.
“Cas? Cas, can I talk to you?”
Cas is taken aback by Dean’s blunt confession. He stares at him and can see he’s being honest.
He breaks down and stars sobbing, his knees trembling and, just when he's about to fall, Dean catches him and hugs him tightly.
They drive down a bumpy road until they reach an old barn.
Cas pulls a chair out for Dean.
By now Dean is practically sobbing and he can’t control it. Cas wipes the tears from his face and brings him in for a hug.
“No, Dean. I was telling you but I chickened out at the last moment”, he looks down in shame.
Just then, he hears a sob and sees tears running down his other self’s face while holding the clothing tighter.
“Well, now you know”
Sam doesn’t say a word. He has tears in his eyes.
Cas sits down next to the other Dean and they start talking. Dean can’t hear what they’re saying but they are laughing and he feels anger running through his veins. Sam takes his arm and pushes him to the hallway.
He sees himself looking at his watch and seeing that it’s not ticking.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to explode like that”
“We don’t lose anything by trying”, says other Dean.
“Dean, it’s okay. I told you time works different here. He’s lived a long and good life”
to know I loved you”, he sighs, “See? This is what I meant about only admitting our feelings when we’re about to die. There’re always misunderstandings. There’s never enough time to explain-”
Dean hears Cas but he doesn’t think he has it in him to fight anymore. But then, he feels something warm caress his cheek and pressure on his hand.
“Sorry. We can have breakfast now”
“Because. I’m not- I don’t deserve-“, he remembers what Cas told him and he knows he was right, he has low self-esteem, “Why... Why didn’t he tell me before? We didn’t have time. I didn’t have time. I couldn’t even tell him. He was gone before I could even process what had happened. He didn’t know...”
Cas doesn’t know what to say. He’s angry. How could Dean be so self-destructive? But, on the other hand, in some twisted way, it shows how much he cares about him, right?
Sam opens the door with anger.
Tears keep running down his cheeks.
Dean stays unresponsive.
Sam gets a package from his pocket and holds it out to Dean.
“Yeah, I just… I felt awful. I felt guilty about how I treated Jack. I couldn’t even look at him without getting angry. All I could see was you- you laying on the ground with… with your w- your- wings… your wings burnt on the floor”
“But you were dying… You just wanted us to know you cared about us”
"Of course I do. How could I not?"
“Okay, mysterious. I like it”
were real… What did you mean?”
“Thanks, Dean”
Cas' face falls and an expression of hurt and confusion takes place on his face. Dean remembers those restless nights when all he could see when closing his eyes was Cas' face.
He puts his head on his hands and continues to cry.
Dean finds himself in the bunker.
“Too much?”
He holds his face in his hands and leans in until their foreheads are touching.
Cas looks at him and sighs.
Dean gasps and leans back so he can look at him.
He recognizes the handwriting, but it’s not Cas’. He turns it over and realizes who gave it to him. It was Charlie. It was the day she met Cas, after the whole Book of the Damned deal. He remembers how she kept taking pictures of them. This one shows Dean and Cas sitting close to each other. Cas is saying something to his brother and Dean is looking at him with a face full of adoration, as if he was the only person in the world. They are both smiling.
Cas looks at them and can’t help the smile that shines on his face. He knows how much Dean blames himself for her death.
“Nothing. It’s nothing”
He seats in one of the tables and tries to think of a book he hasn't look yet but all he can think of is Dean.
He sees Dean resting his right cheek on his hand, the one that’s holding Cas’. Sam decides to let him rest.
“Dean, I’m here. Jack brought me back. I’m really here”
. He knows he is gone. He knows. He isn’t a stranger to this feeling. To his absence. But this time is different. This time it feels definitive. And he thought last time was tough!
"Tell me right now what do you know."
Crowley opens his mouth to make an annoying retort but, before he can say anything, Sam rolls his eyes and keeps going.
“Sam?”
Dean is sitting by Cas’ side, caressing his face and hair and talking nonsense, when he hears a knock on his door.
"Dean, I love you too."
“We’re both a couple of dumbasses”, he says while laughing, “I know I’ve never shown you how much you really mean to me, but believe me, I love you. I’ve loved you for a while now. I was just too afraid to admit it and I’m sorry”
“But you- You were telling all of us”
Dean still doesn’t say anything and Sam looks at him with worry in his eyes.
“Don’t worry. I didn’t make a deal. I just... I gave it what it wanted”
"I don’t-"
. He turns the car around and when he gets there, he runs upstairs just in time to see his little brother on the bed looking up at his girlfriend, who’s on fire.
"Okay, I’ll tell you. But try to keep your emotions in control. Your mother... Kelly, she... She died giving birth to you. I’m sorry. I-"
He jumps and turns, almost falling on his face before he leans on the car.
Sam is sitting by Dean's bed and he's holding his hand. Cas has gone out to let them a few minutes alone (after a little begging from Sam's part).
“I know I fucked up. And maybe it’s too late but I just… I felt like you needed to know. I wanted you to know”
Another vision, this time in a playground, his mother holding the man’s hand and he saving her from another woman.
“Yes, I heard you. I’m sorry, but it was an accident. I was going to talk to you when I heard you and-”
Cas puts a hand on his shoulder and squeezes.
“So apparently we just need to stand were we arrived and after you throw the potion, we say these words and we should get back home”
Cas sighs and hugs Jack.
Cas: I'm
Dean:
“Technically we met in Hell, but yes. This is where you summoned me”
It’s been two days already and Dean hasn’t woken up yet. Cas has been with him the whole time, not leaving his side. He needs to tell Sam. He’s sure he still cares, he just needs to make him realize it.
Dean takes his face on his hands and caresses his cheek.
“Maybe I was a little jealous”, he says as he leans back in.
Sam goes to the dungeons and prepares himself to deal with Crowley.
Dean manages to take him out of the house and, when they get to the driveway, the fireman and the police are already there.
Dean stops talking and looks at Cas with wide eyes, afraid of the rejection he’s sure is coming.
He sees himself as a teenager and an 8-year-old Sammy, alone in a motel room. He remembers this day. It was the day Sammy realized that John would never be around but Dean would. He had stolen some kid’s Christmas presents for him, so he wouldn’t think that John had forgotten about them.
Cas is
Castiel is here the way Jack is here. Every raindrop and blade of grass. In the extra pickles and melted cheese. Sure.
In life he’d become so attuned to Dean’s soul he could pick his words out of every voice on Earth and all the Celestial Host. There is no prayer of Dean he’s never heard. No thought. Not even that time in the library, County Falls, Iowa. Dean’s breath, Dean’s thoughts,
Death is not angry. Not happy either. Through the Empty and back again; there is only Death's task before him.
Cas drums his knuckles on the hood and says his name.
He laughs. He shoves it out and rolls up the window and drives deeper into the woods. Follows a crest into a great shock of light, blue on blue, and he remembers how scary these coastal mountain highways get when you break out of the trees right on a cliffside hairpin turn and some motherfucker has their brights on only there’s no one, no fear, the light softens for him and there is Castiel.
Hasn’t he always longed for this? Time and time again there’s only been one person capable of pulling him from the brink of suicide. The man he’d so thoroughly given up on he’d made his reckless deal. A challenge, almost. If Dean could ever love him like he needed to be loved, prove Castiel so thoroughly wrong about him, he’d gladly throw in the towel.
Somewhere out on the water a humpback breaches and part of Dean thinks holy shit, whale, he’s always wanted to see a whale, and another part of him rolls his eyes and says, really, Cas?
Death picks it up, feels the blade sing in reply to his touch, and Castiel knows: of course, he has one more job to do.
Fell hard and fast and even if Dean told him right now: you could’ve had it, Cas, anywhere anytime, any way you wanted it, you could’ve had it, we could've
now. Multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent. Glass-shattering earth-breaking fully-winged-and-glorious Angel of His Goddamn Son. As pure and perfect as the day he was made, a whole six point one friggin’ billion years ago until he ran into this little monkey and fell.
He wolfs down a wedge of caramel apple pie while Dr. Sexy confesses to Nurse Joy that he’s tired of being objectified just because of his name. His real name is Sixoloupolousia and his parents, fresh off the boat from Greece, shortened it to something cute and catchy, easy for the Americans to pronounce, and then Dean rolls off the counter and heads back to the Impala.
: * : * : * :
“I’m an angel”
He tries to push those feelings away.
“Cas!”
“Thank you”
Cas: Of
Sam frowns and looks at him.
Dean knows he’s right, but he really wants to fix things between them.
Cas sighs and goes back to the books.
“I tried to reach out to you for days. I apologised and you ignored me. You sent me to Hell with that… abomination, as if you couldn’t care less what could happen to me, only to get mad at me when I had to kill a demon wearing my son’s corpse”
Sam flinches when he sees how broken his brother really was. His face covered in tears and snot; his eyes red and full of tears; his face as pale as ghost; his expression one of heartbreak and pain.
Dean is driving away in the Impala. He looks so young.
“Cas!”, other Dean shouts, running after him.
Drink.
“Charlie!”, he screams as he lifts her off her feet.
"Dean. It’s okay. You can stay with him. I’ll let you know when we are ready, okay?"
He doesn’t notice two figures coming out of the house and standing a few feet away from him. Doesn’t see his little brother’s pained expression as he sees what the angel’s death is doing to his brother. And he doesn’t see Jack with a frown on his face, thinking hard about something.
Dean puts a hand on Jack’s shoulder and squeezes.
Dean:
Sam pulls back to look at his brother and sees that he is crying too. Damn it! He’s so broken. I shouldn’t have let him found me like this.
“I wish I could hate you”, he whispers, “I wish I didn’t care. I wish...”
“You telling me you loved me”
Sam, his pain-in-the-ass little brother who doesn’t need him anymore. He literally gave up everything for the kid. His one and only job:
"Look! I found a book about Nephilim!"
Sam watches as his brother breaks down over his angel’s body. He doesn’t think he can come back from this. This time he is truly broken. He needs to do something. Suddenly, he gets an idea.
Everyone looks at him.
“Dean, wake up”
Cas is getting worried. Dean should have called by now, or texted, but hasn’t done either. He decides to look in Sam’s mind to see if he can find why he left. He knows he promised to stop looking into their thoughts, but he needs to know.
“So, how did they get here? Where did you find them?”
"Sam! I found it! I know how to bring him back!"
“You need to know how…”, he sighs, “how I feel. How I feel about you”
“I wanted to... remember how it all started. I’ve been thinking a lot about you these last few days and when I was helping Jack I... accidentally created the barn”, he says with a blush.
But it's too late, the memories come with force and he remembers every time he has let Dean down. Ruby, leaving for Stanford, the demon blood, not telling him about the hallucinations, not looking for him in Purgatory... After thinking about everything they've been through together an idea comes to him.
“I can take you to him”
“You want a tour?”
“Let’s go. I’m tired”
“Dean, it’s okay. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you”
“No, Cas, it’s not okay. I’m sick of pushing down my feelings. You- You deserve to know”
Dean doesn’t listen, or doesn’t care. He doesn’t turn to look at his brother, he just keeps rocking Cas’s body.
He can see other Dean’s face fall.
“Turn left here”
Charlie leans away and punches Dean on the arm.
“That was the day you came back. Sam went off at me for killing myself like that and I told him that I just needed a win and… you were, you were my win”
It’s been... he doesn’t even know how long he’s been here. He hasn’t moved from the floor since he saw Cas disappear. His brain is still processing everything that has happened. Death trying to kill him, Cas saving him, Cas’ deal, Cas’ confession, Cas’...
“We don’t know. Can you help us?”
Cas smiles and...
"Cas... He is... He... He’s dead."
“Dean, I know”
Sam feels tears running down his face. He remembers that day. It had been one of their happiest moments in a while and they had ordered pizza for family dinner, enjoying each other’s company.
And so they tell him the plan.
“Cas-”
Cas wakes up and he feels disoriented. He looks around and there’s nothing around, only emptiness.
“Well”, says Dean, clapping his hands, “I for one am glad that all of this is dealt with”
"Cas, please. Don’t leave me again. I can’t- I don’t think I can survive it. It’s been less than a day and I’m already a mess. Please, please, please. I love you. I can’t- I need you. Please, please, don’t leave me."
“That’s a weird name”
All Dean can feel about is how hopeless he felt in Purgatory, when he thought he’d lost Cas. The moment he saw the clock indicating two minutes left to get to the portal he felt like his world was crushing down. He couldn’t abandon Cas in Purgatory… again! He needed to make him see how much he… how important he is to him.
"It’s okay to feel the way you do. You’ve lost so many people... But this time... This time is different. You’ve never lost someone like Cas. What you two had..."
“We will, I’ve done it before”, says Jack.
"I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Cas. I know lately I’ve been harsh on you but I hope you know that I- I cared about you. You have to know how important you are to me. I can’t bear to think that you thought I didn’t care about you."
“Well, duh”, sighs Dean, “I’m gonna get a beer or something”
“It’s too late now”
Cas gives him a serious look that shuts him up and they go to work.
"Dean. Dean, look at me."
Dean:
“Hey, Dean”
“Thanks, Dean”, he smiles.
Cas looks at him with guarded eyes, as if he is afraid of getting hurt again.
Dean looks at him with a puzzled look and Sam sighs.
Dean stops. Cas is looking at him with all his attention and he knows that he's about to hurt him pretty badly. His eyes starting to fill with tears.
Cas looks at Jack with pride in his eyes and squeezes his arm.
Cas sighs and gets up. Dean looks away when he sees he’s just in his boxers and a t-shirt, but he smiles when he realizes it’s one of his band t-shirts. They go to the Dean cave and they sit in the couch. They stay quiet for a few minutes, until Dean can’t stand it anymore and breaks the silence.
“So, we’ve been talking and, as we haven’t found anything that can help us...”, other Dean looks at Cas, “we could just all live here together”
"Cas, please, wake up!"
Tears keep falling down his cheeks and he can’t help it. He hasn’t allowed himself to think about Cas’ death until now, but he was his friend to.
“I didn’t even say goodbye to Sammy, I just… I gave him the kit and told him bring me back. And then I saw Billie, and she knew, she knew I didn’t want to come back, but she said it wasn’t my time, that we had work to do”
: * : * : * :
"Dean. Dean, this is Jack. He’s Kelly’s kid. He... He thinks he may be able to... He may be able to bring Cas back."
“Yes, I am. I’m sorry I-“
"Please, tell me you can do something."
He hears a muffled noise and thinking that it comes from one of the doors, goes in.
“Okay, I can do this. Cas, you deserve so much better. I know lately I’ve been treating you like... like I don’t care, but I do. I care and when you left it- it hurt. But I’m trying to be better. With everyone, but specially with you. Because you deserve everything you want and more. You’re the most amazing person I’ve ever known. You are family, I need you to know that. Even if I get mad sometimes, you’ll always be my family”
He doesn’t know if Dean can understand anything he’s saying as his voice is full of emotion. He tries shaking his shoulder, but Dean just keeps looking down, tears running down his cheeks.
He breaks down and stars sobbing loudly. Sam hugs him again, this time holding his brother tightly while he buries his face on his shoulder.
Cas can’t do this if he’s looking at Dean, so he looks down at a spot on the table.
Just as he is about to touch their lips, Cas stops him.
Sam is feeling hopeful.
Cas looks sad and worried.
“Hey, you’re not a tool. I need you for you. Because you’re family. Because I care. I need you because- because I love you, Cas”
"Okay, ready?"
Cas gets closer to them and looks at them, analyzing them.
“I love you, Cas. And I’m so sorry it took me this long to see it. That it took seeing my other self with you to realize it. I understand if you like him better. He’s nice. He treats you right. He has never done or said the awful things I have”, he looks down, “he’s better in every way and you deserve someone like him. I won’t get in your way if you want to be with h-”
“I’m sure he knew, Dean”
Cas looks at him and takes his hands in his, lacing their fingers.
“Dean-”
Cas pushes Sam against the wall and pulls his arm against his throat.
“Sorry to tell you, Dean, but everyone knew there was something between you two”
Cas doesn’t turn around or gives any sign of acknowledging his presence.
"He’s gone, Sammy. He’s gone. He’s gone. I can’t... He... I..."
“Yes. Well, Jack helped”
Dean blushes, but he doesn’t move away from Cas.
Cas looks at Sam with narrowed eyes. Why isn’t Sam worried about his brother? These boys have the most co-dependent relationship he has ever seen, so how can he be so okay with Dean leaving with no warning?
“You love him”
Dean kisses him and steps out of the car, walking down the bridge. He feels a presence on his right and smiles.
"Jack, I’m going to go check on my brother."
Dean starts to apologize again, but Cas cuts him off.
“Well, you are staying, aren’t you?”, he says suddenly feeling unsure.
With that he picks up his books and goes into his room. Cas decides he has to find Dean, so he tries calling him to his cellphone, but it goes straight to voicemail. He didn’t have a choice. He had to use his powers, even though they were nearly drained. He concentrates in Dean and he senses him in a motel downtown. He has to get there as soon as possible, thankfully, he had the car he used to get to Lawrence.
"Castiel is a wonderful man, sweetheart.  From what his parents have told us, he's extremely kind and very excited to meet you if you still want to.  He's a 24-year-old wolf who's endured all his ruts since presenting, can you imagine?  He must be a very strong wolf, much like his father.  And he's well-educated, I'm sure he'd love your spirit as much as we do."
He then kissed me hard, pulling me closer with his other hand on my lower back; taking my breath away and reminding me without words he couldn’t care less with what I looked like.
Dean held on to the tub at the onslaught of sensations.  He closed his eyes tight at the welcomed intrusion and laid his head back on Cas's shoulder.  Dean tried not to squirm too much as Cas entered him.  The pleasurable tremors that went through him felt so good and so right, he wanted to cry.  He wanted Castiel to make him come even more.
"Crowley may have deemed you fit enough to leave the infirmary, but you still seem to have lingering issues.  Fenrir, baby, what did that rogue do to you?"
I was not expecting Dean to be on his feet, obviously trying to leave the room.  Crowley was blocking his path, Eileen at my mate’s back trying to usher him to lie back down in bed.  The IV stand had fallen to the floor, most likely the source of the metallic noise I had heard in the halls.  I had to stop him before he hurt himself more.  I stood tall in the doorway, directing my alpha mate scent toward him to get his attention.
As the new Pack Alpha, Castiel was expected to find a mate as soon as possible.  An omega mate would balance the Pack Alpha's order, and as the Pack Omega, that mate would be expected to help him carry the burdens of being in charge.
"Cas?" I couldn't speak very loudly. My voice cracked and I was thirsty.  "Can I bite you now?"
Sam and Eileen sat with Claire in their arms in the library of their apartments.  I was so happy to see them happy.  Eileen handed Claire over to Sam before standing to embrace me tightly.  Castiel smiled at Eileen before heading over to Sam, clapping him on the shoulder.
Dean was still apprehensive the whole way to Cas, and the closer he got, the more he couldn't control his whining for help.
Feeling somewhat refreshed and cleaner, the scent of Castiel on my skin again, I let my mate help me stand.  I pushed all my hair back before getting out of bed, wishing I could pull it up or something.  My legs shook for a moment after being unused for a short time, but soon I straightened up while holding Castiel’s hands to kiss him.  He seemed surprised, like he wasn’t expecting physical affection at the moment.  I kissed him again and hugged him around the shoulders.
Dean sucked in fresh air a few times before placing his hands over Castiel's.
"Sweetheart?  Wha--?"  Then it clicked and the question died on my tongue.  He was praying.  Oh shit, he was praying I was pregnant.
Castiel let me go after a moment of realization and nodded without breaking the conversation with my brother.  Something inside me howled for that small contact to return.  My wolf seemed upset like it was missing the stranger's touch already.
Castiel pulled Dean up with him and manhandled Dean to straddle his thighs.  Dean kissed him hard and hungry; desperate for his mate to be inside.
"This sounds like a wonderful idea, sweetheart." Naomi said quietly.  "I think you should at least meet this Alpha, you can choose whatever you'd like at anytime.  No one can take that right from you, not even an Alpha."
“How are you feeling, Dean?” Gabriel looked him up and down, I wanted to playfully growl that he was mine and say how wonderfully he was doing.  I moved my hand from Dean’s back to his hip and leaned against him, kissing his temple.
"Um...guys?"
My head slumped forward, propelling Cas to somehow maneuver us onto our sides away from any wet spots without pulling away.  Not that he could really go anywhere.
I don't know how much time had passed when Crowley came to tell us Eileen was ready to push.  I stood up and straightened my clothes before going back to Eileen's side.  She was straining in pain, having refused any drugs. Sam was on the other side of her, saying encouraging words and kissing her forehead.
After gently prying my grip from the dresser, the Alpha continued talking softly to me.  I could now feel the heat from his body and the comforting rumbling in his chest on my back.  Cas's hands came up around me, helping tilt my head back onto his shoulder; resting a hand on the base of my throat and the other over my heart.  I still needed something to hold onto, gripping his wrists to ground me as air finally felt like it was returning.
