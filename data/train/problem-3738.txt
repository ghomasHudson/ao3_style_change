“Dean it’s okay,” Castiel says, stepping back toward the table. He swallows and firms himself up. “Bobby is right. I apologise for getting you into this mess. I did what I thought was right, but it’s true that I acted without enough thought to the consequence. For that I am truly sorry.”
“That’s not one of mine.” Dean steps forward, facing Cas with the island counter between them. “Where’d you get it?”
“Hmm,” Cas presses his lips together into a line, eyes drifting to the side as he blocks his wording carefully. “Well I suppose, also, I don’t really like wearing those shirts. Did you want breakfast?”
Jo had offered Dean the rest of the beers she’d grabbed since she didn’t want to be hungover when they met with Henrickson and Cas. She’s a smart girl— she’s already up and dressed and sitting on her bed inspecting all her knives for which need sharpening after their last outing. Like it matters since she’s probably going to sharpen them all anyway.
As the movie progresses, Eileen leans over to rest her head on Sam’s shoulder, and Dean instantly feels like he’s missing out. He can complain and complain, but the amount of physical contact he’s been treated to the last couple of days has been surprisingly comforting. Dean’s not been in a great number of relationships, but the one thing that he’s gleaned from the ones he’s had is that the physical contact was one of the best parts. It’s always been a way of keeping someone close and knowing that they’re still there.
Cas doesn't look up. He's holding a little travel bag with toothpaste and deodorant in it, looking for a good pocket to slip it into. "No, but you do need someone to look after you."
Dean continues tracing his freckles. He has a lot of them on his shoulder. "I was thinking about you, that's all. How different you are."
"I'm being serious. Why is this some big secret? It's not a big deal. So what, he's mad at you for a few days. I don't get it."
Castiel blinked sweat from his eyes, feeling goosebumps flare across his skin. It was a few degrees too cool in his cell, and despite having the window open earlier, the air was stale and still.
The offer of water was met with resigned compliance this time, and he managed to get a few capfuls of it into Dean before his hand was pushed away again. Setting it down on the floor next to them, he shifted Dean so that he wasn't leaning all of his weight into his neck. Castiel should just deposit him back onto the floor, but—holding Dean in his arms was not exactly a common occurrence, and while his selfishness filled him with shame, he did not move to correct it.
Man, how many times has Cas asked him that now? Is he really freaking out that often? "Why wouldn't I be?"
Really showed Cas with that comeback. His prize for winning such a titillating conversation is a dark room with a big television and a heartache that'd easily rival the bargain-bin chick shit Cas likes to read. Maybe if he broke one of the lamps he'd feel better, but then he'd just have to clean up another one of his own messes.
Cas' phone goes off behind them, vibrating like it's got places to be, and after a moment Cas puts an end to their erotic staring contest by sighing and standing up. Dean doesn't let go of his hand, and there's an instant where he thinks Cas is gonna come right back over and pick him bodily up from his chair, and Dean braces himself for it so he won't hurl, but instead Cas just tugs at his hand.
"What? No—no. Not her. You haven't—you don't know her. Anyways." He picks at the label on his bottle, faltering. "I don't know. Maybe… maybe this is different from what we're—you know, talking about, you and your—or this, even." He nods towards the apartment. "It's not…."
He did as Dean had asked him to do, replacing his ruined collared shirt and jacket with the undershirt and navy blue sweater set out for him. Struggling in and out of his own clothes took more effort than he anticipated, and he hated how weak it made him feel. Even here, he was exposed and vulnerable. It felt like the sky could slice him open if he stood under it long enough.
"So," Cas says with a sigh, defeated, "your brother needs me to translate some Enochian. He and Eileen are tracking a witch who conducts spellwork with it."
Charlie and Jody cajole him into the shade provided so helpfully by the nearby mausoleum, and he leans against the wall, closing his eyes and waiting for the world to stop spinning. The stone is cool at his back, and he focuses on that instead of his roiling stomach.
"You're no brother of mine." Theo reached up for his hands. His palm flared warmly on Castiel's forearm, and he felt the bones inside his wrists rearrange themselves, aligning back into their rightful place, the skin sealing back up. It was not done out of love; a broken wrist was easier to pull through a cuff. "When I need something from you, you'll know."
Dean watches her for a moment. Claire matches his slow, uneven pace, mouth tugged down into her typical flippant frown.
Dean pulled the collar of his jacket down, squinting from the sun, and saw Cas filling the doorway. The sight of him was a cold slap to the face; he looked exhausted, defeated.
He tosses the bottle into the trash can and stands up. It's hard to lace up his boots one-handed, but he manages, and then he grabs the keys where Charlie dropped them on the table. It's time to finish this fucking case.
Dean's eyes swivelled in his direction, accusatory. Castiel raised his hands in a shrug, just as annoyed as he was. Oren had apparently given up on cellphones entirely.
Then Dean let his hand fall away and put space between them, as if embarrassed Cas had seen him do it, and cleared his throat. "Yeah," he said roughly. "You, too."
Cas tilts his head, like the question deserved all the gravity of an angel's full consideration. "I hardly remember the food," he says after a moment, smiling faintly as he looks back at Dean. "This is much better."
To his surprise, Theo responded to him. "You seemed to have a good idea of what Jonah should know," he said lightly, clearly amused. "Enlighten me."
"Cas." Dean looked up at him, eyes wild. He was pressing a hand against Sam's abdomen, blood leaking through his fingers. Castiel knelt down next to Dean, and Sam's eyes, glassy with pain, swivelled his way.
Dean stands in the den by himself as he listens to Cas' retreating footsteps down the hall, rubbing a hand over his bruised sternum from when the ghoul slugged him, and swallows down the spiky sensation in his throat.
"Please don't misunderstand me," Cas interrupts him, tone shifting, softening out. "I'm not upset with you about this. I don't—I don't expect this from you, not if you aren't willing to give it. This entire… experience with you, it's been an adjustment for me. For so long I accepted that we would merely be friends, and now that we're together, I don't want to overstep my bounds with you. That you're even entertaining a relationship with me is… I'm very grateful, Dean." Cas offers him one of those sad Eeyore smiles. "I can't put it into words."
"About six weeks," he said with an apologetic twinge of his mouth. "We worked like hell to find you."
"I am calm!" He stares down at his plate, seeing nothing, trying to keep his breathing under control. "You're—what are you—"
Cas lingers for another moment, seemingly debating something, then invites himself in, closing the door behind him. "You and Sam need proper tupperware."
"Right," he repeats. The movie continues to play on screen as if nothing happened. Someone could fire off a gun in the room right now and he wouldn't notice.
she hisses, smacking his hand away when he reaches for a bottle, "provided that you tell me what's going on."
"Yes." He touched the unbroken expanse of pale skin along his ribs, now unblemished by stitches or injury. "I've fully healed. Thank you."
"Sorry," he says again. His eyes are so heavy, and he doesn't have any good reason to keep them open. He barely slept at all last night. He should've stayed in bed with Cas. "Sorry."
Dean stares down at the table. If he concentrates hard enough, maybe he can spontaneously die on the spot so he doesn't have to talk about this anymore. "It's going to sound stupid if I say it out loud."
Sam came back with the kit, and Dean forced Cas down onto the couch again. Further attempts to argue that he was fine were ignored, and he glared sullenly into the corner of the room as Dean held him still and Sam took out antiseptic wipes, bandages, and a sewing kit.
Dean is wise enough to recognise when questions are best left unanswered. He clears his throat again. "I, uh, owe you a pretty big apology."
Cas laughs at the same time he slips two fingers inside him, and Dean's entire body tenses up. He grabs a hold of Cas' arms, anchoring himself again. His fingers are cool from the lube, but only for a moment, his body heat quickly warming it, and Dean practically arches off the bed when the pad of Cas' fingers graze his prostate.
"Fuck." He leaned both arms on the truck bed, pressing his head against them, trying desperately to calm down—to not look like he'd just fucked Cas in the yard. It would take Sam and Bobby exactly two seconds to figure out what he'd been doing, and he was not about to have that conversation with them, now or ever.
"I'm gonna hit the hay," Charlie says beside him, passing a smile around to everyone. She fixes Dean with a significant look, then heads for the spare rooms. "Hi, bye, everyone."
It turns out he can't sleep, or even pretend to, so he stands outside instead, next to the Impala, and commits the cardinal sin of lighting a cigarette. He's cut back on them a fair amount, mostly because Cas is serious about him taking better care of himself, but kicking the habit altogether isn't in the cards for him. And if there's ever a time for one, it's now.
"Oh." He held up a finger as he took another sip of coffee, then set it down to dig around in his pocket. He produced the note, holding it up to his brother's face, and Sam leaned away to read it.
When breathing became an emergency, he pulled away, gasping, resting his nose against Cas' cheek. One of his hands found the back of his neck, curling into his hair. He needed an anchor, too, as it turned out.
"I know." He closed his eyes, drawing in deep breaths. Tessa was yelling; Jonah shifted restlessly beside him. He understood, too, what must be done.
Cas was a solid column of warmth against his body, and Dean clung to him as he sucked air into his lungs. It was dizzying, heady in a way he wasn't used to. He didn't normally enjoy making out with someone who wasn't experienced with it; didn't have the time to instruct or teach what should be a quick and painless transaction. But the eager and clumsy press of Cas' hips and hands and jaw against his own made him ache. He shouldn't be doing this here—not in a fucking scrapyard, not with Bobby and Sam in the house. Cas deserved more than that.
"Human beings have understood disease in many different ways," Castiel told him. "What you call disease changes across space and time, as does your response to it. Were you a hunter a few hundred years ago, you would likely be hunting homosexuals, or women diagnosed with hysteria."
Cas huffs out a bitter laugh. "Your bad," he mutters under his breath. He walks over to the workbench and leans down beside it, flipping open the lid of one of those fabric golf coolers. His hand emerges with two water bottles, one of which he passes to Dean, and Cas takes his time uncapping his own, drinking from it. Dean's losing his temper by this point, but Cas looks so fucking good standing in the sun that it's hard to remember why. He drinks a mouthful of his own water, willing himself to calm down.
Dean sighed. "Whatever. We aren't going to a hospital unless you wanna let him fingerpaint on the windows to keep other angels away. I'm sure the nurses will love that."
They set the vanity down when they get into the elevator, Dean huffing and puffing and Cas not doing much of anything besides seeming vaguely distracted. Dean keys the elevator for the third floor and leans against the wall, flexing his numbing fingers. Cas just stares at the doors, eyes a thousand miles away. Rain dews at the tips of his hair and spots across the shoulders of his long-sleeve shirt, and the cool air has made his cheeks all rosy.
Close to blasphemy, he hissed and pressed a hand to his ribs, and Dean pulled away again—exactly what he didn't want to happen.
But Dean isn't sure how much more of this he can take, so he slips a hand between them, wrapping it around Cas' dick, and is rewarded with the full-body shudder Cas gives. His hand stills between Dean's legs, and Dean grins as he runs a hand up the length of him.
"Hard to forget. Sam pulls that kinda shit all the time." Winchester House Rules for road games are pretty brutal, and Cas picked them up impressively quickly. He wonders how Eileen is faring.
Cas opened his eyes again, head rolling slowly on the pillow until he looked at Dean. "I'll live," he muttered, sounding somewhat disappointed at the prospect. "You applied the sigils?"
Dean's sweaty hair brushed his jaw as he slumped against him, pawing the jacket back to expose his arms. "It's hot in here."
"So you keep saying." Dean went to one of the drawers and pulled out a shirt and sweater. He figured angels didn't get cold, but it was still hammering snow outside, and he couldn't imagine Cas in just a t-shirt. That seemed far too scandalous.
Theo's hand plunged into his back, forcibly catching the wheeling might of Castiel's Grace in his hand and extracting it. He felt his wing flatten, curl inwards around itself, collapsing under the colossal pressure of being reduced to a three dimensional shadow and pulled through human tissue. Massive, marble feathers were slick with blood and mucus, brushing against his skin as it was pulled down from the foundations of Heaven, out into the brutal, stale air of his cell somewhere on Earth.
A few minutes later, he hears quiet footsteps on the wood, and pulls his head up to find Cas staring at him like he's deciding whether to be annoyed or concerned.
Dean! I left one of them alone with Claire because I thought it was you. What if something had happened to her? You know it went after her, right? Tried to kill her? Thank god Alex wasn't home, or it would've attacked her, too."
He swallows hard and listens to Cas' heart thud against his ear. Life cannot possibly be this good. "Uh, yeah, yes. Definitely."
"I don't know how to impress this upon you, but I am no longer an angel." He wrings the rag in his hands again. "If something happens to you, there's nothing I can do about it."
Nathan Fillion isn't currently on screen, however, so Dean glances down to her overnight bag. The mouth of it is wide open, and he can see the tip of some gaming console peeking out of the top.
There were some who had stronger convictions; those who were still bound to the constraints of taking orders, but better at managing their own conduct within a given set of parameters. The problem was a compound one—angels were bad at operating without orders, but they were also bad at giving them when they didn't come from above. And as Jonah continued their conversations, Castiel was beginning to suspect that Metatron's location was a secondary objective. What Bartholomew truly wanted from him was the methodology for producing free will in angels, oblivious to how impossible that request was. Naomi had apparently told her understudy far less than Castiel originally suspected.
Dean channel surfs in his room with his arm slung around a pillow, lights off, screen blaring way too bright, commercials too loud. He's always got a headache these days, and the chasm in his chest is deep enough to break bones. All he has to medicate himself with his painkillers and sleep, so he lives off those and the pizza in the fridge. He's not sulking, he tells himself, he's mending.
The breath stuttered out of him, back heaving beneath his rumpled shirt. Castiel could see the faint indentations of his spine, a sturdy column of bone that terminated at the collar of his t-shirt. Dean's throat bobbed.
"Castiel," Hannah breathed, and Oren looked up. The expression on his face was one of open relief—devotion and admiration radiated off him, and he clearly thought this was a victory.
"Thank you! Exactly my point." Dean's finger hovers over the green P on the fridge, trying to scrounge together a word. He's never been that good at scrabble.
"This isn't my first grave," Cas says, smiling. He keeps a firm grip on the handle of his shovel, and Dean realises he's not out of breath. He doesn't even look particularly sweaty, aside from the wilted t-shirt and small whorls of hair stuck to his temples and brow. There's an adorable smear of dirt on his cheek, as if placed there by a make-up artist. It's like he stepped out of a hunter's edition of a Men's Lifestyle magazine.
He tugs on his hand to get Cas' attention, and Cas looks at him. His brain stalls for a moment, hit with an intense rush of warmth over the fact that he's having a normal conversation with Cas again, but he can't let this go. "Hello? Explain?"
His breath is caught in his throat and still won't budge, and now his eyes are stinging. It's more than he could ever ask for, and for some reason it's still not enough for him. Even now he wants Cas to come back, lie down in bed with him and talk like that some more, like he's thinking out loud and Dean just happens to have the privilege of being within earshot when he does it. The cavity in his chest that's always been there never settles; it aches every time Cas leaves. That's what he does, he just asks for more. Can't be content with just saying thank you, can't just be grateful. He's always deep in the red.
"Jody, slow down." He gets up from his bed, closing his eyes as he waits for the spinning to stop. Maybe the edible last night wasn't such a good idea after all. Dean stumbles towards his door. "Just start from the beginning."
"Is that so?" Tessa crossed her arms, moving so that she stood in front of him. "You're going to lecture me on what is and is not permitted, Castiel?"
But he would wait, he thought, for a few moments more. He owed Dean the courtesy of a proper farewell, even if it would be easier and more efficient to simply slip away now, when he was still sleeping.
Tessa froze, and turned with Jonah to look at him in horror. Castiel clenched his teeth, exhaling through them.
"I'll ask Sam to come up with a chore duty roster," Dean says, voice squeaking at the end like he's some sort of fourteen year-old. "He loves making spreadsheets."
"And it's been on my mind for a while," Cas continues when Dean doesn't say anything, sounding nervous. "I was waiting until you were feeling better to speak to you about it, but—"
Castiel kissed him, and Dean kissed him back, again and again. He had imagined it a trillion different ways—fast and desperate, soft and chaste, rough and heady—and faced with the reality of it now, he understood how inadequate his imagination had been. Kissing Dean, here in his bedroom, was none of those things. It was more tender, more intense than any of that.
"Ugh," Sam muttered, and drew in a proper breath. "Cas—you okay?" His eyes travelled up and down Castiel, alarm spreading on his features. "You look… tired."
There's more talking that Dean doesn't register. Cas has a hand on his chest, warm and strong, like he needs to make sure Dean's heart is still ticking away properly. His hands are really big. Cas takes such good care of him. Better than anyone else in his life ever has.
"Yeah, I'm—" He cleared his throat. Face still in the hollow of Castiel's throat, his breath blew across his skin. "I'm trying to catch up here, Cas."
"Private," Dean clarified. "Sam included. I'm not—I'm not ashamed, or whatever, I'm just—I don't know, I guess I'm just—"
was the one who vanished into thin air the moment he got what he came for, without so much as a thank you, ma'am. But Dean wasn't about to offer the truth, so he offered angry silence instead. If Sam wanted to think that meant he had a point, then fine. He'd let him think that all the way into next Sunday.
"I understand," Castiel interrupted. "I'd prefer that, in fact. Hannah believes I'm too attached to you."
Thank you SO much for reading all the way to the end! I had an absolute blast writing this fic and I’m glad you stuck along for the ride. I’ve toyed with the idea of doing a few Cas POV snippets as a companion to this story, especially his lunch date with Rowena, so possibly watch out for that in the future.
"We had a plan," Jody explains carefully, like he's a particularly slow child. "We would've found the nest with the search party this morning."
Cas, recovering sluggishly from his petite mort, drags his head up to look at Dean. He wears the expression of a man who's found God, which is just funny enough for him to muster the energy to smile.
Cas is a lot less cautious now about pushing him, either because he's too out of his head with arousal or because Dean's actually done his job for once in his life and got his intentions across, because Cas doesn't ask him for any kind of reassurance this time. He rolls his hips again, and then again, and then doesn't stop. It's all Dean can do to hang on, soaring higher and higher with every stroke.
He's really starting to get tired of waking up in random places. It's not something that's happened to him in a while—even longer if he discounts the vamp attack in Virginia. And he is very much not in his twenties anymore. He doesn't bounce back from these situations so much as he claws his way out of them.
There's a secret third option, which is to drive until he hits a coastline, change his name, and live in a seaside shack somewhere for the rest of his life. That would take care of having to make any sort of decision, or worse, listen to Cas tell him he's fucking fed up with Dean for real this time, and he's gotta say, hightailing it out of here sounds like a pretty appealing prospect. It's his usual go-to fantasy whenever shit hits the fan, which for a Winchester is a daily occurrence. He'd make a good lighthouse keeper, he thinks, and he's decent at fishing. Plus he's always wanted to live by the sea. There's a lot of drawbacks to that plan though, and at the top of the list is never seeing Cas again. Huge bummer, that one.
It's not like he has a lot of other options. Sam's got ideas in his head again about being independent, and these days the most significant conversations he has with his brother are about the weather and what to eat for dinner. Charlie's still deciding whether or not it's worth it to be friends with him, and mostly sticks to curt hey, hellos when they pass each other in the hallway. Eileen's about the only person in the continental US of A who actually seems to think it's a good idea to initiate conversation with him, but talking to her always makes him feel like an idiot. He forgets to face her when he speaks, he doesn't know any sign language to save his life, and the kindness in her eyes that's so attractive to Sam just makes Dean want to curl up in a ball on the floor and weep about the sorry state of his life. And he knows he should know better, to not get all jumpy when she talks to him because he doesn't mean it to come across as ignorant or rude, and he can't even explain that to her without sounding like a massive whiney baby, so he mostly tries to avoid her without making it seem like he's avoiding her, because he doesn't actually
"Yeah, I'm—" Grease hissed as Sam pushed bacon around the skillet in front of him. "Trying to cook what's left in the fridge before it goes bad. This stuff is easy enough to reheat, anyway."
"Guess so," Sam says distractedly, tossing a shovel full of chunky dirt next to his feet. The clods break apart where they land on the ground. "She was the one I was betting on."
Cas takes a deep breath, and lets loose. He starts fucking Dean hard, deep and fast from the get go, snapping his hips with all his strength and using the hold on Dean’s sides to pull him down to meet each of his thrusts.
Clearly, that wasn’t the first time Dean’s made a mistake when Cas was involved. Or in general. Utterly
Novak just nods, too far gone for words, and Dean can only push his tongue between those parted lips, hungry for anything he can take from this man. He then hides his face against Novak’s neck, inhaling his scent, getting drunk on it, and focusing on the pleasure radiating from his groin. He’s about to speak again when Novak’s hand closes on their cocks too, helping Dean’s hand complete a perfect channel for their dicks to fuck into.
He tries not to think about how freaking unsanitary what they’re doing is, about all the faces and hands and torsos that have been shoved against this wall to be drilled like Dean he’s about to be drilled. He can only hope they got it as good as Dean’s about to get it.
Castiel could start by sharing this little piece of truth with Dean, couldn’t he? Be honest with both himself and the hunter and tell him that the reason why Castiel had embraced Maggie’s love of music while they were becoming friends was, in fact, Dean. He would have resolutely refused to admit that back then, considering thinking – or talking – about Dean was not an option. He would have probably claimed the reason was that he was embracing humanity in its most outstanding achievements. But that wouldn’t have been able to explain why the thirteen tracks on Dean’s mixtape were constantly among the most listened to songs on his phone. Maybe… maybe if things went well, Castiel could make Dean a mixtape with all the new music he had found that he particularly loved? Those two songs he had listened to on his car ride back would definitely go in there. Of course, he had no idea where to even begin, and Maggie was definitely too young to teach him. Perhaps, he could ask Sam for help? He’d think of something to tell him. Or maybe… he could ask Dean himself? Tell him the truth and ask for a “tutorial”, like Maggie would say. It was probably high time they stopped doing things for each other without telling each other. This small, yet so significant, thing could be a good place to start.
Or maybe not. That’s not the turn Dean was expecting this conversation to take, but he’s not gonna look a gift horse in the mouth.
“Mr. N-Novak. Hi,” the kid greets when he approaches their table to take their order, looking both awestruck at seeing Cas again and so uncomfortable he’d gladly be anywhere else right now.
cashing in several lifetimes worth of luck earned in some epic battle against the forces of evil for the salvation of humankind in a previous life. That’s what Dean Winchester was doing right now. There was no other rational explanation for the perfection of this moment. Cas was literally all of Dean’s filthiest dreams rolled into a single man.
“Cas, it won’t be like...some waltz or something, right? You know I can’t dance for shit. If that’s what you’re going for, you
Cas seems to agree, because he starts kissing back just as hungrily, and they start unbuttoning shirts and gripping hems and unbuckling belts and sliding zippers down while they’re still sitting, Dean on top of Cas. Until Cas has had enough and he stands up, forcing Dean to do the same and he starts walking Dean backward, toward their bedroom, still kissing him, still shedding clothes, and Dean finds it glorious whenever something they do causes for their ring or bracelet to be pressed against his skin and he just thinks ‘He’s gonna be mine forever’ every time.
Cas definitely enjoys Dean’s surprised expression when he looks at the glass of wine in his right hand, resting on the couch, as if he had forgotten it was there, as if he had forgotten he even
“Your wish is my command,” a smiling Castiel says before bowing a little and then walking away in the direction of the kitchen, which he only enters after tossing a
“Of course you can, because you’re being so good,” Castiel can’t help a little praise after all, it seems, “taking all of me so well.”
Dean is worried. But that’s not it. Castiel himself switched on the phone knowing that people would notice the messages weren’t going through and be worried about that. Not because of the lack of an answer, it’s Saturday after all. But because of the fact that his mobile was clearly still off, which isn’t typical. Not for him. So that’s not it. He expected people to be worried. Including Dean.
So he figured, with his degree in modern languages, which his parents had only allowed because “one of us able to speak some of our foreign partners’ language could be useful after all”, Gabe’s degree, and his best friend Meg’s experience at the front desk of a three star hotel during their college years, which made her perfectly suited to be in charge of both reception and booking, the idea of opening a small but nice hotel wasn’t that far-fetched.
Apparently, he’s made the right decision, considering what he’s seeing now. Dean knows that he should do what he always does when he realizes a right decision was made. He should smile to himself, take a moment to appreciate that at least one of the things he donated seems to be helping someone, wish them all the best and keep walking, going back to living his life without fanfare.
Ever since they left home to go to the retirement party of one of Cas’s colleagues he’s been going nuts with
Killed by Raphael and the Leviathan. Even though Dean hadn’t seen it happen those time and had barely had any time to mourn his passing the first time before God resurrected him. And they weren’t even as close as they’d become later on. The second time though. Castiel couldn’t even begin to imagine what Dean must have gone through, spending all those months torn between mourning him and processing his betrayal. Not even an eternity would suffice for Castiel to forget the expression on Dean’s face when he saw Castiel, on that porch, going by the name of Emmanuel. Just like it wouldn’t suffice for Castiel to forget how
Cas laughed a little, disbelieving laugh. “I don’t want anyone else touching me anyway. I... haven’t had anyone else touching me ever since this arrangement between us started. Well, much longer than that, in fact, as you know.”
“C’mere,” Dean says, because as amazing as what’s Cas doing is, Dean’s getting oversensitive and his dick needs a break. His mouth doesn’t need one, though. And it’s eager to taste Dean on Cas’s lips and tongue. Dean
Their Saturday afternoon running errands goes surprisingly smoothly, both children in a good mood and in good health – no teething going on at the moment, no tummy aches and the like – that they’re not fussy in the slightest. This allows their parents to tick all the items off their list and everyone who meets them to fall prey of the twins’ irresistible charm.
reasons to be guarded. And you did give me a second chance, a real one, and look at us now,” Dean said while pointedly using the hand that wasn’t busy keeping a secure hold around his husband’s waist to indicate the wedding reception around them. “I would have waited much much longer for you, Cas, if you’d needed me to.” Kissing his husband’s – his
Cas grabs one of the chocolates and slowly brings it to Dean’s lips, watching avidly as he opens his mouth to let the sweet goodness melt on his tongue. Cas couldn’t tear his eyes away if he wanted. “I have a Dean Winchester kink,” he replies. Always. ‘Especially when you wear green, my love,’ Cas thinks, not yet so far gone that he ends up confessing and handing  Dean this nuclear weapon. That is a form of control over him Cas isn’t sure Dean wouldn’t abuse. Cas has showed him often enough how to do just that, after all.
look. That’s Cas’s ‘I got caught’ look. The embarrassed one he has when the jig is up and he has no other choice but to confess to the ideas that have been swirling inside of that dangerously active brain of his.
The belief that the sexual dynamic between alphas and omegas is a one-way street is the root of all evil in their society, in his opinion. The notion that omegas are bitches in the bedroom constantly undermines the supposed ‘gender equality’ in all things non-sex related. Gender slurs are more common when directed to omegas than to alphas or betas. Omegas still have to work twice as hard to get to certain high-power or high-paid positions in the workplace, and are constantly put under a microscope as most people around them are constantly waiting – hoping – for them to fail for being ‘too emotional’.
“I get that, Cas,” the nickname leaves Dean’s lips without his permission. Crap, maybe Castiel doesn’t like it when someone is so forward-
“Well, don’t get me wrong, flirting is fun and makes you feel good. When you do it with someone you are actually interested in.” How Dean’s gaze can go from innocent to lascivious in a second is a mystery to Castiel. That doesn’t mean his cock hasn’t twitched interestingly. His body doesn’t seem to have as many qualms as his mind about responding to Dean’s flirting. Damn it.
opened up with Dean. They are getting to know each other, really getting to know each other. Dean cares for Cas. He really does. Regardless of the attraction he feels for him, which Dean is kinda resigned will never go away, he’s growing attached to the man. Not what’s outside. What’s
Dean’s shoulders shake while he rests his forehead against the tiled wall. Castiel doesn’t know whether he’s laughing or shivering. “Easy to be so smug when you’re not – shit – the one with,” Dean’s so pretty when he moans, “with a giant cock up your ass.”
attack Dean and rob him. But Dean could attack Jimmy too, and do far worse than robbing him. Surely the thought has crossed Jimmy’s mind, it would frankly be unreasonable if it hadn’t.
Please be gentle with your hearts and handle the overload of domesticity that's about to follow with care 🥰😊
“Immensely better. You have no idea. I-. Thank you, Dean. So, so much. I haven’t felt this...alive in so long.”
Cas also does half the chores around the house and insists on having a weekly planner on the fridge for them to be equally split between him and Dean. Dean doesn’t really think they need one – they could just decide as they go – but somehow that seems very important to Cas. He spends long minutes filling it in with a (‘totally cute’) concentrated frown at the end of every week, so Dean goes along with it, because of course he does. Saying no to Cas isn’t exactly the most refined of his talents.
They spent more than one hour talking about their day and sharing stories about the people in their lives who are somehow connected with their jobs. Dean was particularly interested in knowing how someone like Meg (aka the She-devil, according to Dean) and someone seemingly so calm and collected like Castiel could be best friends. Telling Dean about some of their adventures in college resulted in both Dean and Castiel having to wipe away tears of laughter from their faces.
“’t was cold at first, made me shiver, I loved it,” his precious boy replies, and Castiel notices how his words are starting to sound a bit slurred already. He feels
“I’m not leaving you be, Castiel, as much as you might want me to,” Dean says with a smile that somehow manages to be cocky and insecure at the same time. Castiel’s pretty sure his name has never sounded as beautiful as it did just now when Dean used it for the first time. “But, um, it doesn’t have to be like that. You could...stay? I’d be happy to put you up for some time, until you get back on your feet.”
Then his face turns serious, and Castiel knows Dean’s about to ask something he really wants but he’s not sure he should ask for.
“Yes, I would, Sir,” his beautiful, perfect sub replies. Of course he does. Dean loves his rewards. The part of him that aims at nothing but pleasing others, and Castiel more specifically, loves getting rewarded, as it’s the clearest sign that he’s been good, and has pleased his Dom.
“Yes!” He all but screams while laughing, before bringing his arms around Cas’s back to hold him close, trying to pour all his love and happiness in his hold and in the kisses he can’t help smiling into.
It works like a charm, because any sign of guilt disappears in an instant, to be replaced with wicked determination.
“Touch yourself, darling boy. Sir wants to see you stroke your perfect dick while he fucks your perfect hole.”
Cas’s smile, on his lips and in his eyes, is as fond as it can get, and the hand still cupping Dean’s face caresses it gently. “Oh, Dean.”
“I-, what?” Oh right! Mind out of the gutter, Winchester! “Yes! I mean, Sure. 5.30, your office. Of course I can. From there we’ll go to Central Park. And then, the rest. What you said. All of it.”
, get his prize out. He can’t stop staring at it. Dean’s literally panting, mouth open, forehead pressed against Novak’s, whose hands are groping Dean’s ass so hard he’s positive they’re leaving handprints on his cheeks, while his own hands cradle Novak’s dick as if it was the source of life. He’s big, long, warm, thick, hard, red, uncut, fucking
He hurries with grabbing the lube and a condom and can’t even be bothered to be annoyed when he hears Dean’s chuckling. He’s
He does go to bed soon after, feeling suddenly drained. The week is catching up to him, but Castiel suspects he’s not only tired because of work. This thing with Dean is constantly on his mind. He’s constantly analyzing everything. Everything Dean says and does, or doesn’t say and doesn’t do. Everything Castiel says and does, or doesn’t say or doesn’t do. His mind hasn’t had a minute of peace and quiet and
“Dean, baby, perfect-“ Cas babbles, between one love bite and the other, his hips madly grinding against Dean’s boneless body, which only prolongs Dean’s aftershocks and makes it even harder for him to catch his breath.
Clearly not a man to waste time or words, Castiel smirked wolfishly, grabbed Dean’s wrist and dragged him toward a table where a group of people were drinking, chatting and laughing. Not sparing a word or a glance for any of them, he grabbed a fucking tax accountant trench coat that was a size too big and in complete contrast with the fashionable and perfectly fitting jeans and t-shirt the man was wearing. Dean’s confusion must have been evident on his face because Castiel asked “Any problems?” with yet another arching of that damn brow, and Dean fucking
What they just did is one of the hottest things Dean's ever done and they didn't even remove a single article of clothing. Dean can't help the half surprised and half hysterical laugh that leaves his mouth. They were so desperate that they didn't even waste a second to get naked and just rutted against each other like a pair of beasts in heat.
Dean’s absolutely adored Times Square and has dropped more than one hint that he’d really like to go see a musical with Castiel at one of the theaters nearby. Castiel hasn’t committed to anything, but he must confess he’s intrigued. He’s never seen a musical, in spite of loving going to the theater and knowing that the productions in Broadway are superb. He’s afraid of doing something new with Dean for the first time though. Castiel has a weird tendency to remember every single detail of the first time he does something new for the rest of his life. Linking something that permanently to Dean doesn’t seem like the best of ideas right now. Not yet, anyway.
Can this place get any better? Dean doubts that, considering the whole thing has already exceeded his expectations, which were already quite high, for a small three-star hotel.
, as he won’t be able to resist getting inside of him for much longer. But he doesn’t go far in his journey towards the bedside table before Dean attaches his mouth to Castiel’s neck, keeping a strong grip on his shoulders. Castiel can only groan for a moment and close his eyes, reminding himself that just pushing inside of Dean already
He starts puttering around their living room, moving items – a centerpiece, a cloth, a book Castiel ‘forgot’ on top of it this morning before leaving for work – from the table to other pieces of furniture.
He takes a few deep breaths, trying to bring his heart rate back to normal and send the tears he feels pooling in his eyes back where they belong – in the rational part of his conscious mind where he’s known this was a possibility all along. That he’d open up to Cas completely and he’d be found lacking anyway. That what he had done in high school was unforgivable enough that it couldn’t warrant a second chance, in spite of his best efforts, but only humiliation and revenge.
So he plasters the fakest of smiles on his face, gets the big guns ready – you don’t get to occupy Castiel’s position if you don’t have a huge brain and an uncanny ability to beat into submission those who dare cross you, and aren’t afraid to use either, or both, when needed – and steels himself before addressing the slimy individual approaching him.
He could always eat and drink that stuff himself if he didn’t bump into Jimmy tonight (‘Bump into. Please. As if you aren’t on a mission to go look for the guy,’ his traitorous mind commented.) He wouldn’t eat the fruit salad though. He couldn’t give Sammy the satisfaction. Even though Sammy wouldn’t see him eating it, he would
It’s been years since Dean felt like he was under a microscope though, and now both families, including Naomi and Gabriel, are completely supportive. They are also completely wrapped around the twins’ pudgy little fingers and the number of their impromptu visits to New York has increased considerably ever since the babies joined the Winchester-Novak household.
“Yeah, for almost a year now,” he adds, smiling brightly at his boyfriend, whose answering smile is just as bright. “And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
The place Dean decided on eventually was Sarabeth’s, but only once Castiel replied he was OK with that choice. He confessed he had indeed chosen something fancy to try and impress him, but also that he had got the idea the day at Chelsea Market when Dean had noticed their bakery there and seen how mouthwatering their products looked. Looking at their menu online had confirmed that there were a lot of interesting options and that everything Castiel had listed could be found there.
“I am free on Sunday afternoon. How about you come pick me up at 4? That should give us plenty of time for the visit.”
He cleans up in record time and walks out of the bathroom with his heart thumping against his ribcage. He’s nervous, exhilarated, eager to-
But it had become less and less fun as the days passed, an unexpected urge to just jump Cas as soon he opened the door overpowering him instead.
“Now go bend over the table, precious boy,” he tells him, and the eagerness with which Dean complies is enough to make Castiel sure that any lingering disappointment is all but forgotten. What an adorable boy.
“I know myself, I can’t help getting attached,” he adds conversationally, while he’s comparing two socks with a cute squint and trying to decide which one is his and which is Dean’s, “especially when there’s already an attraction as strong as the one I feel for you,” he explains, as if that was a totally normal thing to say and he wasn’t making Dean gape like a fish.
out of my league. But it’s not every day that you can own up to your mistakes and make amends. I learned that makes you a better person, and might also help those you wronged.”
"God, you're perfect, baby," Dean says out loud, because he wants Novak to know that's how Dean sees him.
The eye roll Castiel gets in response reassures him that Dean has indeed taken his remark as the half-joke that it was meant to be.
savings now. Which, by definition, he had saved for moments like this. This was Dean. If there was one good reason to give
The sounds of their bodies crashing against each other and their moans and cries and grunts and their panting are music to Dean’s ear, and only spur him to thrust harder and deeper. He knows he’s hitting Cas’s pleasure spot constantly fucking him like this, his wails are all the confirmation Dean needs.
“Good.” Cas’s smile has turned pleased. And the idea that Cas might be pleased because he has pleased Dean is doing things to Dean he actively has to suppress.
“Just doing my social duty and educating the younger generation,” Dean replies with a perfect impersonation of the shrug emoji.
that I like the idea of helping others do it with a relaxing atmosphere, some good food and a healthy dose of strong coffee.”
How this man visibly tenses and just as visibly relaxes in a matter of seconds would be awe-inspiring, if Dean didn’t know that it is the consequence of living in the most precarious of conditions.
He caught himself in time to let some sense prevail on the haze in his brain and to realize that, True Mate or not, Dean had no right to behave like the stereotypical knothead and demand his omega present then and there. Dean was twenty-six and the omega seemed to be at least three or four years older than him. It stood to reason that he might not have sat around waiting for his True Mate to show up. Neither had Dean, for that matter. No one really does, considering how freaking low the chance is that you might actually meet the
His movements are erratic now, losing his rhythm. Dean wraps his arms around Cas, keeping him as close as possible, and tries to meet the uneven stutter of his hips with a few weak rolls of his own. His back is going to be so fucked tomorrow.
Dean stares at the screen as the movie begins, wondering what he's doing wrong. No shirt, no shoes, but apparently that means no service. Cas
Mary crosses her arms over her chest, fighting a shiver. She should be sleeping—they both should be sleeping. They need to be well-rested come tomorrow.
"No, yeah, um, you're good." Dean leans back against the cushions, staring at the floor, wondering which school assembly he must have missed. Quickly recognising that 'who else knows about this' is an insane question to ask, Dean falls back on a simple, strangled, "okay."
Mary sits next to Dean, chewing thoughtfully, settled comfortably in her chair. Their current line-up is the Indiana Jones movies—Sam said something about easing mom into the beauty of modern special effects—so she doesn't constantly lean over and ask him why everyone's laughing. He's happy that she seems relaxed for once, solidly at ease with the cultural references in a cheesy mid-80s action-adventure flick, but he misses answering all her questions. Dean makes a mental note to pick from the mid-2000s catalogue for next time.
very mild warning for the kinds of bi + homophobia you get when you google anything related to gay dating online.
"I don't want you to be unhappy," Cas says gravely. "And I don't want you to be with me because you believe you have to be, or because of some sense of obligation between us. You've been distant these past few months, and I don't want you to feel like you need to avoid me if this is a problem."
A relieved gasp came out of Sam by the time Castiel was knitting his skin back together. Sam dragged a hand over his face when Castiel pulled his hands away, swallowing hard. "Thanks," he whispered, voice shaky. "Thanks, Cas."
"Good." He folds the notebook closed and sets it on the bench beside him. "I got some machetes in the trunk, so—"
Castiel looked up from the basin. The water inside of it was muddied; its surface had an unpleasant film floating atop it. "Angels are not given access to all of Heaven's information."
"Yeah alright, smartass," he mutters, face flushing, though not from embarrassment. It's his own fault he taught an angel sarcasm, and he can live with that. But his earlier theory is proven correct; Cas does smell really good. Maybe if Dean really behaves himself, Cas will let him lick his back later.
Despite his frustration, Castiel found himself smiling. "The easiest way is through intercourse, as it happens."
"Of course." Cas grabs the rag hanging from his back pocket and wipes his hands, then his face and neck. There's a stripe of sweat down the middle of his t-shirt, and his hair is damp with it. God, his skin must smell amazing. Probably tastes good, too.
Castiel closed his eyes and listened, trying to find a less agonising way to stand. His wrists were broken again, and they had been for a while. The burden of his wings skewed his centre of gravity perpetually backwards, leaning towards the ground. The fact that his vessel hadn't crumbled under the strain yet was both a testament to Jimmy Novak's faith and to Theo's ability to keep him alive.
"My dad used to put this awful smelling shit on his shoulder and elbow after he got home from hunts," he tells Cas, and then gestures for him to bring up his other hand. Cas switches them out, slotting his hand into Dean's almost eagerly. Dean forces himself to keep talking. "I don't know where he got it, but it wasn't from a pharmacy. It didn't have any label on it or anything, it was just this plain white squeeze bottle. I think he got it from a witch. I had to help him put it on sometimes if he was in a real bad way. I don't know if it ever actually helped him with his joints; the smell usually just made my eyes water."
Castiel sat back on his haunches, his legs aching and his head pounding. He looked down at the blood on his hands—Jonah's, Dean's, Sam's, his own. He hurried to wipe it off on his pant legs, looking away.
"Not without you." Dean's jaw idly brushed the top of his head as he looked around the cell. "The other angels—Hannah, she's here, with your men. They can fix you up."
"No." Cas' eyes dance around his face, soft in the way Cas sometimes gets. Dean remembers a time in his life where he'd cough and move away and grab a beer, lest he be accused of being too obvious. It's unclear when he stopped doing that, but it's not his instinctive response anymore. It hasn't been for a long time.
"I know you're busy," Sam had said around a massive yawn, using the back of a chair to support his weight. "If you need to leave—"
"Did you hex your girlfriend or something?" Dean asks, holding his end of the fitted sheet. Sam frowns at him, and Dean jerks his head towards the laundry room door. "I just caught Eileen helping Cas with the kitchen."
Dean risks a glance in Cas' direction. The first part of the movie is lit a sallow green, and it makes his profile especially sharp in the darkness of the room, catching on the few days' worth of stubble dusting his jaw. Cas notices him staring almost immediately and turns to look at him.
"I was gonna take the coward's way out and leave you a voicemail," he confesses, smiling faintly. "So—um, I guess I'll just say my whole thing to you now, if that's cool."
He exhaled, pressing his face into his arm. The urge to rest weighed on his vessel so heavily that it was difficult to think around. "Nobody."
Castiel stood up. It brought them very close together, and Dean cleared his throat, though the lopsided grin on his face didn't go away.
The lump on the ground let out a muffled groan. "Hi," he rasped, weak and quiet. Taking that as permission to approach, Castiel knelt beside him and pressed a hand to his shoulder.
Dean woke after several minutes, groaning, breathing deeply. He shifted sluggishly on top of Cas, and the mattress by Castiel's right shoulder sunk down as Dean braced a hand against it.
"And I think you deserve some bright spots in your life," Jody continues, and he finally has the guts to look at her again. She's still smiling at him. "Live a little. Ask him out. Have fun. Do what you want to do."
"In truth, I'm stalling," he informed Sam, looking down at the hands he had clasped between his knees. The words came easily; Sam always found a way to understand him, even when he struggled with it himself. "My path forward is deeply unpleasant. I would like to remain here on Earth, but it is unwise to do so."
Castiel touched his jaw, forcing him to look at him. "Dean. Please don't berate yourself. I'm very happy."
Dean wanted to tell him it wasn't like that. He didn't get into any kind of argument with Cas, or tell him to fuck off—he didn't do jack shit. The opposite, in fact.
Part of it is definitely Charlie's edible, but he feels more of that same lightness in his chest, a balloon of warmth that's sure to make him levitate a few feet off the ground. Cas is due back in two days, and they both miss each other. He's giddy just thinking about it, about seeing him again. And his blessed release from sobriety tonight means that he doesn't have to stifle it, remind himself not to let the excitement go to his head, to not get his hopes up. Instead he basks in the glow of knowing that Cas misses him and he's coming back soon.
He looks up from the table, feeling very sorry for himself, and finds Charlie watching him with a look somewhere between pity and hysteria.
"We've been—I've known the guy for like a decade. Of course he knows." Dean frowns. Did he? It's not like Dean's ever pushed him away. He's even initiated sex a bunch of times. That's what people do when they enjoy having sex with another person. Easy-peasy.
lay—Dean can't imagine sacrificing his whole week helping someone forensically clean their own house.
It had been a while since he'd seen this many dead angels. Hannah's incursion had turned the tide against Bartholomew's men, but not soon enough to matter. As many of his own men littered the floor as Bartholomew's, and Castiel could feel the building sway around them from the damage. Debris settled thick as snow over the open office floor; the windows had all been blown out. Parts of the ceiling were gone completely, offering a view of one or even multiple floors above them. Chunks of the floor were also gone, and at the bottom lay bodies shouldering ashen wings. Outside, he could see damage to adjacent buildings from the conflict, and sensed the presence of reapers nearby. Human beings had died as a result of this battle. Sirens wailed below.
needs to stop looking at him all doey-eyed like that. "I've been through worse," he says dryly, as if Dean needs the reminder.
Cas pulls. It's a single, smooth motion, unbroken by effort or strain, and ends with Dean landing on his ass in the grass next to him, bewildered and slow to catch up.
There's one lead that comes up, but Eileen immediately calls dibs on it, and after hearing about the details of the case, Dean isn't in any hurry to protest.
Castiel held him steady as Dean sloughed off the weight of his own death. He should urge him to hurry, he thought. They needed to find Sam; they needed to aid the angels above them, still locked in battle. Instead he cradled Dean in his arms, watching the fine muscles in his face twitch and shift with renewed, vibrant life.
Charlie's staring at him again. He realises she muted the television, and Dean is not the least bit interested in having any type of conversation that requires the TV to be off.
Dean knots his fingers together in his lap, refocusing on the motion of Cas' hands. "Yeah, being a human comes with lots of joint pain."
"I'm sorry, man," he says earnestly, the words tumbling out of him, thick and rough. "I'm so sorry. I'm sorry you have to—to put up with me all the time. This should be easier than it is."
He came hard. Cas was practically curled around him, clinging desperately to his shoulder and hip, gasping into the collar of his jacket as he came all over Dean's hand. The noises he made, muffled into the fabric of Dean's coat, were almost enough to do his head in. He felt his cock throb inside his pants, aching for the same relief Cas was arching up into, and finally—finally, Dean felt him relax.
He folds laundry while he figures it out. The most obvious witness to call to the stand is helping him pair up the socks that had all piled up in the basket. Cas is quiet while they work, leaning against the table next to him and looking painfully good in a charcoal V-neck. It's a new one, from one of those Wal-Mart shirt packs, but he wears it with the same air of dignity and purpose as he'd worn his dress shirt and trenchcoat and fucked-up tie. He might be human now, but he still approaches every task with the holy zeal of an angel carrying out—or more accurately,
"Not really," Sam admitted, and then took it from him. The sound of him peeling it open filled the cab.
"Right here," Cas says, appearing out of thin air. How convenient that he could still teleport. The mattress sags as he sits on the edge, staring down at Dean with painfully blue eyes. They're glowing, they gotta be. Nobody has eyes that pretty by accident.
"No," he said impatiently. "Nobody has time for that. But she wanted to play a one-off game of Dungeons and Dragons and needed an extra person."
"I got you," Dean said with effort, arms quickly wrapping around his back, careful not to touch where the wings protruded from his shoulders. "I got you."
Cas is staring up at him, uncomprehending, because he still doesn't get it, he still doesn't see. Dean's shaking already, sick with himself, sick with how overwhelming all of this feels, that Cas would
"You gonna tell me what's going on?" Jody asks beside him, her nose buried in her phone as they walk the grounds. The cops had divided the cemetery into blocks on the map, marking off where disturbances had occurred. So far all they'd identified was the husband's overturned grave. Dean keeps his eyes forward, watching Charlie walk the rows of tombstones about fifty feet in front of them, her eyes pointedly turned away. Apparently grave markers make better company than he does.
It goes to voicemail after four rings, and Dean sighs as he listens to her tell him to leave his name and number and she'll get back to him as soon as she can. Probably for the best.
"She did, and Jody talked her back into doing it part-time." Cas steeples his fingers against his mug, a faraway look on his face. "She seems to be doing well. Jody is good to her."
Castiel opened his eyes. His brow creased involuntarily; he was too exhausted to hide his confusion. "Yes," he said slowly. "That was my understanding of how interrogations worked."
"That's par for the course, honestly," Sam offered when Castiel didn't respond. "Hunting is like that a lot."
"Well, you know where he lives. Make a house call." Charlie smacks his shoulder, and he flinches away from her. "Whatever you think it is, it's not that big of a deal. Say sorry to the guy, buy him flowers, whatever. He'll get over it. He like—dude, he's an
Castiel closed his eyes, pressing his face into his arm, and listened to the door screech on its hinges as it swung out into the hallway.
It also makes it a hell of a lot easier to be pissed at her. Was there something in the water? Is he the only goddamn person around who seems to actually give a shit that there are
"Fine," he conceded after a moment, and they began to move towards the stairwell. "But we work as before—you'll incapacitate whoever comes towards us, and I will kill them. Once you run out of bullets, you stay behind me."
It's early evening by the time he works up the courage to climb to the roof. It's August now, and the summer days are mellowing, getting shorter and cooler as autumn slowly approaches. The sky's lit a striking pink, and the clouds collecting around the low sun are a deep, bruised purple.
"Yeah, cuttin' it a little close there, man," Dean says as he straightens and dusts his hands on his jeans, though his stomach swoops in relief at the sight of Cas—and Eileen—in one piece. "You nearly seasoned me."
His head fell to Castiel's shoulder. His breath stuttered out of him, and he rocked faintly on the bed, as if the reality of this had just now hit him, sudden and all at once. It had not struck Castiel yet; he would surely collapse once it did.
"Because I was wrong!" He could feel his own Grace flickering now, restless beneath the warded cuffs that bound him. The anger took more out of him than any cut from Jonah's blade. "I wasn't being deceptive, I was being a fool. There's a difference."
"No," Cas says slowly, but something alights in his eyes, and Dean mentally kicks himself for giving that trick away. That's gonna bite him in the ass later. "I can give you a hint if you—"
"By forfeiting your duty to fight alongside your men to search for two humans," she snarled at him. "By lying to your second-in-command and retreating to a bunker."
"I had lunch with her on Wednesday," Cas says casually, like that's a normal thing to do, and Dean really thinks he should be given some kind of award for paying attention to this conversation instead of the fact that Cas is
"I'm always pushy." He holds his boot up with a hand on his ankle and puts the butt out on the tread, wincing when he drops his foot back on the ground. It's like some part of him is always hurting these days.
ruined her weekend, so it's not a huge stretch to think she's washed her hands of his bullshit. She's also tough as nails, so the likelihood of her getting jumped on a random stretch of road is slim—or at least, slimmer than the possibility of her saying to hell with him and fucking off. He's not sure he fully believes that, but the grim reality of losing Charlie as a friend is currently easier to deal with than the panic that she might be in danger and he's not around to help her.
He shoved away from the bed of the truck and touched Cas' shoulder. The contact made him flinch, though he didn't pull away, and Dean stepped closer, enough that he could feel the tension radiating off of his body.
Cas arches down to kiss him one more time, and then hooks Dean's leg over his waist. Dean pitches his hips up to meet him, and sees stars when he finally,
With a sigh he clicks out of the window and closes the laptop, then immediately opens it back up to double check that he's properly gotten rid of all the evidence and none of it will be in his browsing history. Not that anyone else uses this laptop besides him, but he doesn't need the reminder he ever attempted this.
"Claire taught me this trick," he says, passing Cas a can of beer hidden underneath the sleeve of a hollowed out Pepsi can. He'd smoothed the edges of it down with his knife earlier, but the aluminum was still sharp. "Careful."
He can hear Cas' breath stuttering as he pauses to suck in air, and his erection is pressing insistently against Dean's stomach, hot and heavy and hard. He commits the cardinal sin of letting go of Cas, but only so that he can grapple with his own belt, his button and his fly, trying to worm his way out of his pants as quickly as possible. Cas has barely even touched him yet, and he's so close already. If they last thirty seconds, he'll eat his hat.
"It's dangerous here, too," Jody points out. "I'm terrified, Dean, believe me, but I can't lock her in her room because of it. This is a good first step; she's close to home, and I'm a call away. Claire, too. They can't live their lives terrified of the monsters under their beds."
"Huh? No." He feels Cas' hand retreat and wants to beg him to come back. He doesn't, though, because Cas has spent the last few days in a dark room coaching him through drinking water and taking pills, and he deserves a break. He even offered to help Dean shower at one point, but that's off the table. There are some lines he's not going to cross, and giving over the responsibility for his own hygiene to another person is near the top of that list.
Cas grunts again, and for a moment Dean thinks that's all he's gonna get out of the guy, but then he drags his head up, sluggish and heavy, and looks down at Dean.
He didn't require further elaboration. The fact that it was Sam and not his brother praying to him was explanation enough. Castiel had offered just as brief a justification to Hannah moments before his departure:
He ends up making them PB&J, because he's fucking starving and doesn't want to stand at the stove again. They eat quietly, leaning against the counters, too tired to go sit at the table, and Dean watches Cas waste his hoity-toity table manners on a meal most commonly served to small children. He's really glad nobody else is in the bunker, because neither of them are eager to put on more clothes than necessary. The waistband of Cas' sweats hangs dangerously low over his hips.
Dean grins. "Like an orange." Or was it peach? He doesn't remember. Sam laughs again, so he probably gets the gist either way.
"Yeah," he says, a lot more convincingly this time, and rolls onto his back. "Yeah, Cas, I'm good. I—I wanna keep going."
She may as well have slapped him across the face. He can't help the flinch that rocks through him, and there's a sudden, inconvenient pressure behind his eyes.
"Get him up," Mary is saying, out of Dean's line of sight. All he can see is dead vamps littering the ground around him, and there's some sort of fog in the warehouse, like a cloud set up shop in their nest. "Nearest hospital's only ten minutes out."
Maybe he needs to ask a more specific question: how do I ask out my best friend of eight years (gay), who is also not technically human, without ruining our friendship if he says no? Or even worse, ruining our friendship because he says yes and something catastrophic happens, like Cas realises this isn't all it's cracked up to be and says "it's not you, it's me, we can still be friends, nothing will change between us, I promise," and then for the rest of Dean's life he'll know what it's like to hold Cas' hand and maybe even kiss him, and live with the fact that it will never, ever happen again. What if they don't even get to the sleeping together stage?
"No, taking notes." Cas reaches across the table and grabs a book, sliding it in Dean's direction. His head's calmed down, so he fully opens his eyes and reads the front.
A person ducks in through the doorway just as he gets himself settled against the wall, their features severe in the shitty lamplight as their eyes sweep the room before landing on him. It takes Dean a second to register that he's looking at himself, and a jolt goes through him that disturbs the wound in his calf.
There's another vicious shriek from the spirit, much closer now. A round of rock salt blasts dangerously close in their direction in response, and Dean even feels a few small chunks of the salt buckshot ping painfully off his shoulder. Both he and Sam duck their heads and crouch low to the ground, dropping their shovels and rolling out of the line of fire, hearts hammering as another round of rock salt goes off.
Dean reached over to the glovebox and fumbled with the clasp. He fished around inside until his fingers touched a granola bar wrapper, and he held it out in offering over the backrest.
Carefully, Dean rucked up his shirt far enough to expose the wound, and sucked in breath through his teeth. It was difficult to look at directly; not because it was grizzly, although it was, but because the mouth of the wound shimmered with a wavering incandescence that made Dean's head spin. It seemed to refract and move at random, as if glancing off the surface of a pearl, shifting under some unknowable light source.
"Your boyfriend turned down sex twice, once because you were concussed and your arm was broken, and once because he was about to drive out of state to help your brother," Charlie summarises, brutal and unrelenting. "And you think that, what? You can never ask him for sex again because of that?"
Castiel knelt beside him, pausing only long enough to mend his own broken wrists, before cupping the back of Dean's head and pulling him carefully up from the floor. He could hold him now, as he was meant to be held; reverently.
Dean slumps back down on the mattress so his hand is free, and reaches for Cas. Their fingers twine up immediately, and that anchors him a little. "You," he says, smiling up at Cas crookedly. "I've been, like, nonstop thinking about this for months. I'm trying not to have a panic attack."
Cas let out a slow breath, but after a moment, he nodded. "It's an incredibly selfish thing to want."
Neither of them have the energy for a frenzied make out session, but Dean prefers this slow, languid pace anyway. He circles his arms around Cas' back, one of his hands going up to his hair, and feels Cas settle his weight along his chest until it feels like every part of them is touching. It's hard to even tell where his hands are. All they've done all day is shit like this, lazing around, talking, kissing, and this, Dean thinks, is almost enough to sate him. Nothing less than Cas' full attention, the whole weight of his body bearing down on him, the sensation of his mouth covering his own. Now they just need to do this for fifty years straight, and maybe Dean will finally be able to stand them being in separate rooms without feeling like a chunk has been ripped out of his chest.
Cas' only response is a skeptical twitch of his brow. He sits back in the chair, rolling the joint of his wrist in his other hand and frowning down at it. There's dust in his hair, too, probably from shoving it back from his face while working. It would be so easy to reach over and brush it away.
The amount of time Dean spends massaging his hands is way past the point of plausible deniability. He could've just handed Cas some hot and cold gel and sent him on his way; doing this instead actually makes
"No." She puts a hand on his arm. "What I meant to say was—there's a lot of adjustments happening for all of us. It's okay to feel weird about it."
That answer is not at all reassuring, so Cas kisses him some more, slowly, his hand brushing down Dean's arm until it settles on the swell of his hip. There's no demand in it, no expectation. Dean could call this whole thing off right now and Cas wouldn't protest. He wouldn't even
"I'm not saying it's your fault, or anything," Sam was telling him from the passenger seat as they drove down the interstate, in the quick way he spoke when he anticipated being interrupted. "If you don't wanna talk about what you guys discussed, that's fine—"
A chorus of goodnights follow Charlie, and Dean is agonisingly aware of Cas pawing through his overnight bag on the table. Dean stands there in the middle of the library like an asshole, unsure of what the protocol is. In his own fucking house, too, Jesus. He wants to go to bed, but is he allowed to just do that? If Cas wanted to talk to him, he would've said something in the car, right?
Castiel can only nod and bite his lower lip to stifle a laugh when he sees Dean’s incredulity playing on his face. He doesn’t miss how Dean’s eyes zero on his mouth, before he lifts his gaze and lets out a clearly happy, “Man, I thought I had zero chances! Luckily I’m a dreamer and bought everything I need to cook a proper burger
"They warned me about you, you know," Jonah told him, pointing the knife at him. The blade trembled with accusation. "Bartholomew said I wasn't capable of this task. He told me that the angels you speak to, they all unravel. They go insane. It's what happened to Naomi, I'm sure of it. You should be in the Cage with Lucifer. It's where you belong. You're the reason so many of us are dead. You deceived all of us!"
"Cas, please." He groans as Cas' fingers brush against his prostate again, already sick with need, but it's just a brief, fleeting contact, not nearly enough. And Dean's tank is about as full as you can get, so he doesn't need much. "Cas, come on, fuck me—"
from WikiHow. Below it, offers a list of the 7 best ways to get a guy to go out with you. There's even a website detailing how to ask your crush out over text.
"I'm not condemning the work you and your brother do, Sam," Castiel said finally. "Or you, Charlie. You help people. You mean well. But I know you've encountered people who are monsters in name only. Ones who don't hurt anybody, who want to live their lives in peace despite their deviance."
The cuts Jonah had inflicted on him stung, but his shoulders were giving him the most grief. It had been several days since Jonah had last allowed him to rest on the floor, and it was beginning to wear on him. His vessel was not doing well. "Because I don't know the answers to your questions," Castiel replied, licking his lips and tasting blood.
"Cas," Dean murmured, voice rough with apology. He was close now; the warmth radiated off his body like a small sun. "I'm gonna get you down."
"Decide whether you wanna get yelled at here or back at Jody's," Charlie tells him, pulling out her phone. "I need to give him an address."
"You live here, Cas, just as much as the rest of us." Dean shifts on the bed, wishing he had something to do with his hands aside from clenching them around his knees. "Just as much as Eileen now, apparently."
"Wait." Sam frowned as he went to the sink, rinsing out the skillet. "What does D&D have to do with the LARPing fair?"
"Couldn't wait because you were worried Cas would find out? Or because you were worried about the body count?"
Mary nods, like none of this is a surprise. He supposes it isn't. "Well, there's a lot going on. We can start small, if you want. Why'd you come out here?"
They cleared four more rooms, all empty. The building hadn't been in use for a while—dust collected along the floors, and drop ceiling tiles hung haphazardly from their frames. The angel scouts had tracked footprints everywhere, making it difficult to tell if Sam had been on this floor.
"I think you know what you want to do," she whispers to him. "You just want someone to give you permission to do it." Her arms tighten around his back. "If you need it, this is it."
More weird, loaded silence follows. Dean sighs and sits back in his chair. "Something else you wanna say?"
Sam winced. "Few years ago. Long, bad story. He's in for a pretty rough couple of days after we get vamp blood into him." His eyes flicked to Castiel again. "You're sure there's no way you can fix him?"
"It worked before," Cas said, frowning. They were facing each other on the bed, tangled together, sweaty and breathless. The hand not wrapped around Dean's cock was pressed against his chest, palm flat. "In the scrapyard. I could feel it then."
"So that's normal," he says, sounding even more like an insane person, but that train's already left the station. "Not having sex?"
He comes-to in the Impala. His vision is filled with the back of the front bench, tilted sideways. He's lying down; something warm's beneath him. Dean concentrates very hard, figuring out which arm is his bad one—it's his left—and with his right he grabs Cas' knee. It's gotta be Cas he's lying on, and confirms that with a squeeze of his fingers. He'd recognise that knee anywhere.
Dean looks up with him. He wonders sometimes if the other angels watch them. Watch Cas, in particular. This was supposed to be his punishment, after all. Cut off from the Host, forced to live out his days doing shit like this. Dean's gotta applaud Cas' siblings for their lack of creativity; at least when God cast out Lucifer, he built him a Cage.
He kissed Cas, again and again. It wasn't frenzied, because he didn't want to overwhelm him, though already Dean could feel the ache to press deeper, move faster, grip tighter. Cas for his part was doing his best to keep up, moving on instinct rather than experience. He was clumsy, but earnest, holding fast to Dean's jacket like he was weathering some storm.
Dean sinks lower into his own pillow, listening to Cas breathing instead of paying attention to the movie. It's different from Sam's, which he's listened to his entire life. It's immovably measured and even, without hitch or strain. He could set his watch to how regular Cas' breathing is. It's one of the things that could tip someone off about him being not-quite-human; it's too good of an imitation. Life isn't set to such an even tempo.
"Were you injured?" There's a faint tinge of concern in Cas' voice for a brief moment. If Dean were feeling particularly assholish, he could play it up, drag Cas out of whatever icebox he's stuck in by falling dramatically to the floor. And Cas would do it; toss aside his anger and pick Dean up. Like he always does.
Fuck, well, no stopping now. He clears his throat again. "I'll spare you most of the details. I got this—this friend, um. Known her for a real long time."
"God, you guys aren't even kissing." Charlie's building a case in her head, he can see that now. It's not the right one—she's got it all twisted, and he can't sit here and let her think that this is—whatever the hell she thinks it is.
"Eight?" he repeats dumbly. Jesus, how long was he out? He goes to the window and pulls the curtains back with a finger, squinting outside. Even from here, he can see the heat lines radiating off the asphalt. At least it's no longer blinding out.
The reaction was immediate; Cas melted into him, his fingers finding purchase wherever they could—a hand on Dean's sleeve, a fistful of where his jacket met his hip. He made a low noise in the back of his throat that surprised the both of them, and Dean kissed him again, pressing closer, their chests touching now.
She spreads her hands. "Happy to be of service. You don't have to stick around if you don't want to. You guys have already been a huge help."
"Yes, I'm seeing that now." He pauses to chew, jaw working. Dean wonders where Cas got his manners from. Dean's not a slob by any stretch of the imagination, and neither is Sam, but there's a weird, restrained sensibility to the way Cas holds cutlery that Dean definitely didn't show him how to do.
"You command the forces of many. It's a useful skill. He'll even pardon you for the death of Naomi." The blade of Theo's knife was pearlescent in the sickly overhead light, tucked far too close to Dean's throat. Dean's eyes wheeled, searching, glancing down at the gun out of his reach, chest heaving.
When he heard Dean's answer, it wasn't offered aloud. It didn't even come out as words, not really. Instead, Castiel felt it in the air, a prayer so soft and quiet that it could easily be ignored, mistaken for the sigh of the air vent or the sound of the walls settling in for the night. It was an invitation that allowed for any rejection to be passed off as a simple failure to notice, as if Castiel was not attuned to every pulse and sigh and twitch of the man next to him.
"I'm sure she did." Cas heaves another sigh, and that finally seems to satisfy him. He deflates a little. "Good."
"It was the most effective distraction available to me at the time." The column of his throat moves in a swallow. "It was either that, or think about you."
"I've been working on the roof," Cas says quietly. He talks so softly all the time now. Dean feels like he's at a sleepover. Maybe they should start braiding each other's hair. "How are you feeling?"
Dean closes his eyes and kisses him again, fireworks alighting in the pit of his stomach. "We got lots of time to practice."
Half of Jonah was cast in sunlight, slanting across his features and cutting sharp shadows into the valley of his face. "You received revelation from the Michael Sword," he said with a triumphant smile.
to avoid her, he just really doesn't want to hurt Eileen's feelings or freak her out. It's something he knows he needs to get over, and fast; Sam doesn't behave this way around a girl unless he's head over heels for her. Eileen's not going anywhere anytime soon, and Dean needs to get his shit together and actually learn how to talk to her without making it awkward. But until then he's not gonna embarrass himself in front of Eileen or make her feel like she's not welcome by being weird about it.
"What's that?" Dean sighs as Cas begins to move. It's a slow pace, the roll of his hips languid. It surprises him, how almost casual Cas seems about this now. Even when they went slow before, he was still usually intense, perpetually on the precipice. But if Dean's proven anything today, it's that Cas has him now, unequivocally, and the frantic desperation is gone, or at least absent. All that's left is this slow, tender sort of lovemaking. Dean should be balking at the word, because his life is about as far from a romance novel as it could possibly get, but there's no other way to describe it.
"Yes." The word hums in Cas' throat, irritated and amused in equal measure. Dean could listen to it all day. "I'm realising that."
Castiel kept a firm grip on Dean's arms as he hurled expletives at his brother. He was a good deal stronger than usual—partly from the Mark, partly from the vampirism. It paled in comparison to the strength of an angel, but it would have been impossible for Charlie and Sam to move him safely on their own without knocking him unconscious.
hot, Dean can't really deny that, but it feels weird to just think that in front of another person and not suddenly worry about the nebulous but very severe threat of telepathy. He's still getting used to that, too, but Charlie's probably a good person to practice that on.
"It's not a big deal. Sam's doing the whole honeymooner thing with Eileen, which is really annoying and cheesy so I leave them alone, and Cas—" His mouth twists. "It's not a big deal."
“Uh...Thanks, I guess.” He pauses, feeling like the air is thick with something that's making this uncomfortable. Like there’s something that he should say but he doesn’t know what it is. “How’s the war effort going?”
Studying the room more closely, Cas comes further inside. Dean’s already shooting him excited grins while he pours himself a primer of old bourbon. As Cas sets an old barstool on four legs, he leans over the counter and Dean groans, clutching his stomach.
“Yeah, just some pathetic not-woman mourning the loss of her girl,” Dean says, shrugging out of his jacket.
“Cas, come on.” Dean pulls on one of his crossed arms. Again with the heartbreaker routine. And the angels think he’s not a pushover anymore. “I’m trying to make it up to you here. Why are you smiling?”
Dean’s mouth drops open, and he tugs on Cas’s elbow, still in his grip. With the corners of his mouth turning up in a smile, Cas twists out of his hold so he can take Dean’s hand.
Cas bursts out into the cold night air first, but Dean is hot on his heels. He grabs Cas to turn him around and shoves him back.
“I don’t...care about stuff, Cas, I was just trying to save Sam. Like usual,” he adds, rolling his eyes. So much damage from such a noble goal, he thinks. Good thing he gave up on God and benevolent forces a long time ago, because he doesn’t deserve points for trying. “It all just went...haywire.”
“That is three months that he spent rotting,” Dean says, and looks up with his eyes narrowed. “Thirty years in Hell. That I spent
Dean sits up, tossing his arm over his knee and breathing harder. His mind’s spinning, tumbling forward into all the things that just got added to his to-do list. He needs to get this ghoul out of here before Lisa and Ben get home. He needs to get his breath back and his back cracked. He needs a drink.
, or maybe the other way around—he’s surely the first to find out about this? And this, and this and this.
“Cas,” he says, and his hand spasms in his grip, a pleasant squeeze that Cas feels all the way up his arm in a way he’s not expecting, “you know when people usually do this, it means—well, you know.”
“Up north to see a friend,” Dean says, glancing at Cas. “Then we’re detouring over to Kansas. Just for a day—we’re actually planning to spend the weekend in Sioux Falls before heading on back. It’s just a few days round trip.”
Although the living room is just four walls connected and not even blocked off from the kitchen, Dean’s well aware that he needs bad cartoons to stay sane. He hooked a TV up in the middle of the room and just ran an extension cord from the closest outlet, and dragged in a couch that he found curbside a few streets away. Dean sprawls out in the middle of the ratty old thing, forcing Cas to crowd into a corner.
Dean pauses to ingest this before answering. His eyes are mysteriously wet, now. After a moment, he finds the strength to clear his throat.
When he gets back from the bathroom, Cas is sitting cross-legged by his pillow in a green t-shirt covered by one of Dean’s softer flannels.
“I miss him, Cas,” he admits. “I promised him that I wouldn’t go after him, but every second of every day I have to force myself not to.
“I guess...I didn’t think of that,” he says, frowning. Now that Dean says it, it does seem like the obvious answer. “I’m not used to needing help."
“Now if you don’t mind, I’d like to go back to my bar,” she says, all haughty and self-assured once more now that she’s on her feet and out from under Dean’s fury. “Perhaps it’s best if you collect your friend over there and go.”
. Is it really so incomprehensible that I would fall in love with you? Don’t insult me. It’s because of who you
“Look who can joke about it now,” Cas says, turning back around. “At the time I thought you were going to vomit.”
“Of course you can come,” Cas says, looking at him. “You’re welcome to join me in almost everything I do.”
Dean’s shampoo smells nice, his soap smells nicer. Mostly Cas is just glad that he’s clean at all and that he now has access to a toothbrush, but it’s the first perk he’s had since landing wingless on Earth. When he gets back to his bedroom—it’s very bare and depressing, and what Cas imagines jail is like based on what he’s seen on Sam’s cop shows—finds a plain white t-shirt and grey sweatpants folded neatly on the bed.
“Seafood medley in five,” Dean announces, swinging into the room without invitation. “Tell me you’re hungry, because I made a lot.”
is better up close where Cas can hear the quiet hitch in his breathing and revel in the way Dean doesn’t let him breathe, pressing in for more whenever he tries.
and he smiles indulgently and goes to fill another order out of earshot. He lets Dean cool down alone until one of the phones rings, and then Cas has to poke his head in the back, holding aloft the burner and wordlessly switching places with Dean to answer the call.
The morning is a pulsing, yellowy thing. Dean groans and turns away from the sunlight, burying his face into the warmth he can feel radiating right beside him.
At the same time, the ground starts shaking. Dean’s eyes shoot there, then to the roof as lightning crackles.
He cannot believe he let this guy live in his house without ever watching a wrestling match. He wants to take him to watch a real one someday, maybe when Gunner Lawless is back in the nearby circuits. Cas should only see the best of the best. But at least Dean can pop his cherry with some classic reruns.
“Yeah? And what if you weren’t here?” she says. “Dean, plates, a broken door—All of that can be replaced. But we can’t.”
Dean takes a step back, giving Cas space to think. Running his hand through his hair again, he examines the canvas.
It’s not fucking fair. Dean wouldn’t trade Cas’s life for anything, but if God can do him—Why not Sam? Dean’s stomach is hurting again, a dull and empty ache. He focuses on being the flashlight for awhile instead. They have to be getting close to the car now, right? He wonders when Cas will leave, thinking how he’d like to be alone but also very much that Cas’s familiar, overbearing presence is comforting in its way. It’s normal. It’s the only normal thing left.
But he doesn’t make it to his car. He gets just around the side of the building before nearly running into Cas, who appears suddenly in front of him on the pavement. Dean trips back a step instead of running headlong into him. He’s done that before; it hurts. Cas is remarkably solid.
, Cas hears the underlying insult, though he doesn’t voice it; Dean’s too sweet on him to press a bruise.
“Come on, Cas,” he complains, throwing down the pencil he was drumming with. “You’re always doing that, how is there even anything left to explore?”
“I don’t care about some random strongmen that I’ve never even heard of,” Dean tells him. “I just can’t believe that you’ve never heard of Kurt Russell.”
As soon as they finish dessert, Dean starts making his excuses. Cas, perhaps as punishment for Dean convincing him to wear a nice blazer for the occasion, hasn’t taken off his jacket the entire evening; but he does hold out Dean’s coat for him to shrug into at the door. Lisa’s frowning.
“Hey! There you are,” Dean calls out. Cas slowly backtracks and comes into the room. “I’m making some dinner, are you hungry?”
“Why didn’t you call me?” he demands. “If you were having a rough go of it. I could have given you my credit card number or something.”
Dean sighs. Cas makes a move for the car, but Dean pulls on him until their faces are close and he’s hit with the full force of Dean’s disappointed glare.
Dean jerks the steering wheel, nearly driving them into oncoming traffic. Cas is a serene statue, open palms resting on his thighs. He looks over, his eyes just drifting from the open road to the driver’s side.
“It’s to honor his memory, isn’t it?” Dean mutters, almost to himself. He throws back what’s left in the glass and splashes in more, a healthy amount this time. “I’m remembering. Besides, I’m pretty sure there’ll be liquor stores open tomorrow.”
Dean’s eyes are barely open, and he looks surprised when Cas holds up the joint, but then he leans in with hooded eyes on Cas and takes a long drag.
They build a fire in the yard, all four of them. Jody calls her woman and asks her to bring over more logs when she arrives, which she does half an hour later—bouncing out of the car all smiles and perky and blonde, not what Dean would have pictured for Jody at all. He whistles when he meets Donna, poking fun at Jody’s more serious nature next to her bubbly excitement at meeting Jody’s friends, and kisses Cas on the cheek when he gets Dean more beer because he’s amongst loved ones and it suddenly feels very easy to do it. Bobby’s looking at him, but he doesn’t say jack.
She frowns, thinking this over. Rolling his eyes, Cas redirects her attention by inquiring about her latest girlfriend, a warrior from an opposing faction in her LARP game. Apparently they broke up last weekend because of a dispute over their political beliefs, which is so far beyond Cas’s surface-level knowledge of human affairs.
He texts Cas when he gets there and then to check in that they’re still alive every night, but other than that it’s radio silent—at least from the other end of the phone. Cas spends his time doing all he can to help. He flips through books and all Dean’s bookmarked Internet tabs for relevant research for as long as he can keep his mind from straying. Somehow he can’t stop getting
“I don’t want to talk about it!” Dean snarls. “So what, you thought I’d need someone to stay up and talk about it over coffee?”
“So you’ve been listening to the meditation tapes I gave you?” Cas asks suspiciously, sticking his face in to squint. Like this motherfucker could suss out a liar by sheer force of will, ha. Even angels couldn’t make him tell the truth. How many of them had Dean tricked, now?
Dean flips his book shut: That means no dice. He’s already grumpy because Cas brought up Azazel again, and Dean gets his back up at the mere mention of his comatose brother going darkside once upon a time. This makes it very difficult to have a productive conversation.
“Most likely,” Cas says. “The books don’t say anything about how long it will take before he’s back to normal. Or what the effect will be on him, given that he’s not a demon.”
“Aren’t all the angels?” Sophie says. “Newsflash, Rocky, the Gates to Heaven got slammed shut. Everybody fell, that means
“I didn’t realize they’d give us drinks on this thing,” Dean says, leaning into his side to talk below the guide reeling off facts, hummingbird-like.
He gestures to the empty spot on the bed, and Cas nods. They’re so close on the narrow bed that their knees, practically their whole thighs are touching and Cas looks down at the space between them quietly for a minute before glancing up at his face, but Dean’s still looking down at his hands, playing with his bottle cap.
Comparatively, Cas’s voice is low and steady. He even blinks slower, inclining his head in Dean’s direction.
“Hey, better than the blood bag emergencies you keep ringing me up about,” Dean says. Benny gives him a sheepish grin.
“I won’t,” Cas promises. “I can stay here, not just visit. I’ll check in there regularly, of course—”
It’s a good dream for once. He and Sam are tracking a werewolf through Memphis when they catch wind of a demon attack the next state over; they finish off the cub quickly and head on over, only to find Cas already dealing with it. They help him finish off the last couple of demons swarming the safehouse, each of them wielding a copy of Ruby’s knife, and then get takeout and watch a movie at the random motel they find off the freeway. That’s the part of the dream Dean lingers on, when the three of them are shower-warm and laughing with nowhere else to be.
“Nothing,” Dean says, but he reaches up and knocks a hooked finger against Cas’s cheek and it drags down to his stubble, lingering. “Maybe you
“Yeah.” Cas pauses. He’s pulled Dean on top of him, but now he just watches the movement of his hands smoothing up Dean’s thighs and then back down, gentle and deliberate but unhurried so Dean can feel every second of it. “Why did you say it finally? After the—In the motel?”
It was a long, cold stretch of months running away from him. Pretending like he couldn’t hear. How often did Cas want to fly to make sure he was alright—or to help him when he definitely wasn’t? Now he lives just down the hall, and they can’t talk to each other at all.
They end up back in the middle of the room with the song nearing its final chorus. Dean lets him stay stiller, swaying in place and rarely asking him to spin.
Cas frowns. He props himself up on his elbows, forcing Dean to move to his own side of the bed, into his own space where it’s colder.
“I just want you to be safe,” she says, her eyes big and shining. “Okay? And that means ground rules.”
“Is this how you’ll be spending your retirement, Castiel? Playing doctor to this human?” he asks. Then he adds something else in a language Dean can’t understand, and turns away.
The waitress comes back with a bloody mary for Dean, who’s decided to indulge since he’s been cutting back just slightly the past couple of weeks, disliking the roiling discomfort of hangovers without all the amenities of home, like a fridge for cold water and a bathroom sink that doesn’t put him face-to-face with the dark night. Having to puke in a port-a-potty or public YMCA shower sucks too.
“But I saw you, Cas,” he says, looking at him. His expression pleads Cas to understand, but he doesn’t, he can’t read Dean’s mind anymore. “You were human, and you were—upset. You didn’t handle it very well.”
After a shower and a change of clothes, he looks a little less like he’s on Death’s doorstep. Dean wraps the wounds on his side while he demands answers, two birds with one stone. More war effort, blah blah blah. They got the last ingredient they needed for the spell, but Cas got his ass kicked on the way out. The other angels fled. He chose to take cover here.
get better.” Dean’s voice is gruff, but he realizes now that his chin has started wobbling, too. It’s too late. “Ever. It’s all I think about, it’s all I
He does lead, as he promised, but it was closer to another empty threat: Dean can’t dance for shit either. That doesn’t mean he doesn’t have enthusiasm, hauling Cas around the room and all he has to do is make sure he’s stepping in the right direction. After he learns that Dean shows him a split-second before he moves his feet by squeezing his hands first, it grows easier to follow him.
“What’s the news, brother?” Benny asks, sliding them both beers. A third is already sitting half-finished in front of him. “You don’t usually come up here strapped and loaded.”
“You know what, Bobby,” Dean says loudly. “I’d love to catch up, but I’ve actually gotta run. Massive, uh, water leak on the homefront. Thanks for the heads up on the vampires, I’ll take care of it.”
According to Dean, the appropriate things for Cas to bring on a simple hunt are four guns (hidden in various places on his body), two retractable knives, an angel blade up his sleeve and Chrysler Building-sized amount of celestial firepower. From what Cas is surmising as he watches Dean get ready from the doorway, the appropriate things for Dean to bring to a meeting with the disgraced ex-King of Hell is about two guns, an angel blade and a skyscraper short of that double-standard.
Cas is scowling at him again. He seems to only really have two expressions when Dean’s around, this and—Well.
“Yeah, and look how that worked out,” Dean snorts. He pulls on Cas’s sweater until he comes close enough to wrap his arms around, nuzzling warmly into the back of his shoulder.
The broken wheel on the desk chair spins a half-circle in the air again, then jams. A pause. More cursing, then a screwdriver tinkering with the joint. The wheel spins and cuts off with an awful grinding sound.
Cas’s brow creases just so when he’s thinking about what to say. Dean fights the urge to tell him to spit it out, because all that’s likely to get him is Cas zapping out of here before he finishes the thought. Dean used to be able to brush that stuff off, but it’s lonelier out here with nobody around. Living with Lisa and Ben was a classic case of not knowing how good he had it ‘til it was gone. Now he just looks at Cas’s constipated expression and tries to find a port of patience in a veritable hurricane.
Cas hums. The Men of Letters also looked far more respectable than Team Free Will ever has, so he’s not surprised that they bothered to find a front for their hideout as a way to slip in besides appearing to disappear through a sewer. Cas carefully doesn’t voice this thought.
“I...haven’t boosted the router yet,” he says dazedly, still not quite awake enough to comprehend what’s happening. Half-sarcastic, he adds, “I’ll put it on my to-do list.”
“Good morning,” Lisa says. He pretends not to notice how her smile seems a little forced. “Are you hungry?”
Dean packs away a lot of bar food while Cas and Benny look on with not-so-sly glances of disgust, although since Benny is discretely drinking blood out of a flask, he doesn’t have much room to judge. He keeps turning away to sip it in the corner like it’s not really fucking weird for someone to be drinking out of a hip flask while they’re sitting in a bar.
“If either of you were here, then I would have protected you,” he says, hard but nonplussed. He steps closer. “I’ll always protect you.”
When he pulls away, he spots a glass of water on the bedside table and passes it back to Dean without turning away from his fallen friend; and Sam just looks him over, lips pressed together and smiling.
“I know. I still wanted to do it, Dean. For you,” he says. “That’s why I opened Purgatory and shut down Heaven...although it didn’t go down the way I expected it to.”
“Yes, really!” Dean says. He looks around—the only other person in the parking lot is a blonde in a business suit that’s yelling into her phone and walking briskly in the other direction—and wrestles his voice back to normal. “She—She wanted it that way.”
“I suppose they couldn’t take away my training,” Castiel says. Bobby holds out his flask and Castiel takes a deep swig, only to grimace, holding a hand over his mouth too force it down. “That’s not water.”
“Sure do, man,” Dean gives him a hearty pat on the shoulder, eyeing him up and down, taking in the sight. “You look like a real hunter.” Dean continues off past Cas to find Sam and get started on the cleanup. Cas remains in place for a moment longer, catching his breath. He catches sight himself in the dirty, cracked mirror on the wall. His hands, his clothes, his face, caked in blood and sweat and grime. Yeah, he kinda does look like a hunter.
This afternoon is windy. There’s more than a slight breeze slamming against the trees, pushing some of the recently turned leaves off of their branches, littering to floor with an ever-growing carpet of yellows and reds. But then even among the commotion there’s a larger disturbance. Castiel dares to raise his hopes, his lips spreading into a smile, until they are dashed as Castiel catches sight of the almond-coloured feathers the adorn Uriel’s back.
“Because I bruised your fragile ego when I accused you of cowardice,” Cas says, sporting a shit-eating grin. “Don’t worry, I don’t expect you’ll be suffering for very long. I expect this is about to be the easiest three hundred dollars I have ever made.”
“I’m gunna go die now,” Dean grumbles, starting off to his room without making time for pleasantries.
The female angel, Remiel, pouts, but ultimately obeys. But they don’t leave. She turns back to Sam and presses two fingers to his forehead. In an instant he’s unconscious.
Dean gestures for him to sit, but he shakes his head. The atmosphere is certainly tense, and though Castiel is no expert at reading human expression, it doesn’t seem as though the others are particularly interested in having him join them. It doesn’t seem like a ‘pleasant family dinner’ kind of evening anyhow.
Dean watched the restaurant doors waiting for Cas to return, wondering where Cas really wanted to go that night. Cas was apparently this big romantic who liked stories about big gestures and lame gooey stuff like that. Cas liked to hold hands in public, Cas liked to kiss in public. Maybe Cas liked fancy restaurants too. Maybe he wasn’t doing enough to make sure Cas was happy.
Dean scoffs. “Like hell it isn’t. You say this fight’s coming to our doorstep whether we like it or not and you think we should just sit back and let it? I’m sorry but that’s crap.”
Castiel swallows as those green eyes search his in conflict. The pressure against his side disappears, Dean steps back and holds the blade toward Castiel hilt-first.
Cas grabbed his arm again. "I realise this is poor timing, Dean, I'm sorry, but I must leave," he said quietly, quickly, in the tone of a man with one foot out the door. He was already elsewhere, lingering only to offer parting condolences.
Dean's vision threatened to white out. He thought he gasped, but he wasn't sure, because there was nothing else except for the incandescent thrum beneath his ribs, the searing heat of Cas' palm against his skin, beneath muscle and bone. The walls shook with the force of it, or maybe it was just his body that was shaking. He quickly realised those were the same thing.
Jonah's body began to shimmer, the edges of it turning fuzzy. What light there was in the room refracted off unseen surfaces of marble and steel and gold. Jonah's eyes burned blue. "Stop asking why!"
Dean turned towards him. Their knees knocked again, and a thrill went through him when Dean didn't bother to move his leg away. One of his hands was curled in the fabric of his pants, bunched up near the top of his thigh.
"It was nothing," Bobby said immediately, chagrined at the earnest gratitude in his voice. "You've done a lot for us."
He caught a glimpse of the silhouette of himself in the mirror as he stood at the sink, refilling Dean's bottle and re-wetting the washcloth he'd been using. Jimmy Novak's face stared back at him, but if Castiel tilted his head at just the right angle and viewed himself in his periphery, he saw more than just his human vessel. Pearlescent walls hung like vast curtains in the air; the broad breadth of marble feathers and gilded spokes curled around the neatly bounded perimeter of his vessel's shoulders. Angels couldn't be perceived by human eyes, not in their true forms, but no matter how well-contained an angel was in their vessel, they always bled out a little at the margins.
Dean hangs on for a moment longer. He's not trying to push his luck, but a guy's gotta know. "So….?"
"We're good," Charlie answers, and tugs Claire towards the kitchen. She goes reluctantly, glancing between the two of them, before following Charlie.
It was difficult to comprehend the scope of the despair the angels were faced with. Castiel had difficulty contending with his own, let alone all of Heaven's. The hatred he felt for their Father was one he saw reflected in Jonah's eyes, though Castiel wasn't certain Jonah was aware of it.
Dean turns his attention to his lasagna so he doesn't burn a hole in the side of Cas' head. He has to chill out, play it cool. Cas is sure to make the first move when he's ready, and
"I'm doing that." Dean tucks his hands underneath the sheet, middle finger to the corner crease, and presses his palms together like Sam is doing so the sheet folds in half between them. "There's no point in folding this anyway. It's going on a bed."
As difficult as it was to hold his eyes, Castiel dared not look at Dean's mouth. "Before," he said quietly, "what you said, in the cell. Was it true?"
Castiel felt the tip of Jonah's blade slide along his chest, the slice cupping the undercarriage of his ribcage. It was too shallow, in his opinion, though he cried out as if the steel had struck bone.
"Dean." A hand in his hair, gentle. God, that feels good. Cas' fingers avoid a spot behind his ear, which he assumes is where he took the hit. "We're almost at the hospital."
"Grabbing another beer," she tells him, rifling through her duffel. "I can tell this conversation is gonna need it."
"Not—uh, well no, not like that." He's been jacking off in the bathroom like a fiend, though. Probably best to omit that part.
Castiel braced a hand on the bed to stop himself from touching Dean. He watched the anger, the grief scrawl across his face—he watched Dean struggle to push all of it down.
"I can mend the damage," he conceded with a tilt of his head. "I have no idea what they'll look like after I'm finished."
"It'll take me a moment," he told Sam softly, and began to work on him. The remains of Jonah's Grace in his body were already stretched thin, and Castiel felt lightheaded as he repaired the damage to Sam's internal organs. Around them, the building shuddered. It wouldn't be long before it came down altogether.
he's fucked in the head, his problem is that he can't stop himself. Cas isn't sleeping with anyone else, he knows that, and if he
Cas leans away again, this time to yank Dean's jeans down, and he rocks on the bed from the force of it, head falling back against the mattress, gasping in relief as his erection finally springs free. Cas has got that look on his face again, staring down at Dean's dick, and Dean has to cut him off at the pass. If Cas touches him even once he's not gonna be able to tell him to stop, and no way is he spoiling the main event.
"Dean…." Jody sighs. It's a sigh he's heard before, from Bobby, from Ellen, from anyone who thinks they have a moral obligation to knock some sense into his head. Boat's long gone on that one. "I know you had a… a rough childhood, from what you've told me. But Alex isn't Sam. She needs to do this." Jody touches his arm to get his attention. "It'll be okay. I believe that."
"So. About your gardening," Dean drawls. Cas is mostly covered with a blanket, so his hand moves under it, tracing aimless circles on his chest.
He listens to her while he makes his way to the kitchen and starts up a pot of coffee. Jody's voice evens out as she reports the facts to him: Mariam Alice's corpse was found in her home yesterday, chewed up seven ways to Sunday. A neighbour called the cops after not seeing her for a while, and told the police that she saw someone who looked eerily like Mariam's husband walking around their backyard a few days beforehand.
"Fuck—fuck you," he mumbles, and it's hard to tell if he even got the words out. He can barely keep his eyes open.
"Hey," Sam calls, a subtle but nonetheless smug grin on his face as he gives Dean a once-over. "Happy hunting?"
"I'm not saying it as an insult." He looked down at his hands again, trying to find the correct thing to say. "You're angry that I left suddenly, that I have been gone for weeks. That I have not answered your prayers."
Cas, ambivalent to that assessment, merely rolled his hips up into Dean's hand again. A noise rumbled low in his throat, approaching a whine, and Dean felt Cas' mouth nudge at his cheek again, a voiceless but very obvious request. More than happy to oblige, he kissed him, properly this time, hot and open, and was rewarded with another shuddering moan from Cas.
Hannah was much quicker by half. Her eyes took in him, then flicked to Sam and Dean behind him. When she met his eyes, her gaze was full of suspicion.
He's pleasantly surprised with how well he manages the strain. His leg is the one giving him the most grief, but so what, he doesn't have to stand. The headaches and eye strain lingers, though, so he has to pace himself.
Jonah stopped in the middle of the cell, looked at him. "No, I mean—" His head cocked, the muscles around his eyes tightening. "It's not possible."
In total, there are eight mausoleums on this side of the lot. Dean breaks into every single one of them, snaps a pick in the process, and comes up with a fat load of nothing. No flagstones out of place, no suspicious alcoves, no disturbed remains, no
"I need to show you how to kiss properly," he murmurs into Cas' mouth a few minutes later, smiling when Cas pulls back to look at him.
He drags Cas into the shower with him shortly after that. They get properly cleaned up from their previous engagement, not just with tissues from Dean's room, and now that he's no longer in danger of being hospitalised for a burst testicle, he can finally do what he's been meaning to for months. It's his turn to take care of Cas for a while, and fuck if he's ever got some good ideas on how to do it.
Dean's nose flattened against the bed of the trunk, his eyes squeezing closed. His breath came out stuttered. "Your heartbeat is really loud."
"Who fuckin' knows what Metatron did to it," Dean whispered, slumping deeper into the shoulders of the jacket draped around him. His eyes fluttered closed.
Dean snorts as he turns on the water and begins rinsing the plates off. "You think any maid in their right mind is gonna see the outside of this place and not immediately run in the other direction?"
He sniffles, honest-to-god sniffles, and swallows down the rest of his blubbering. There's those magic words again. "Yeah," he croaks.
Cas closes his eyes, exhaling slowly. A number of emotions flash across his face, too rapid for Dean to catch, but the one that lingers is a resigned fondness, the kind of expression offered to a beloved family dog that's just destroyed all the expensive new throw pillows. There's a slight smile on his lips when he opens his eyes, and Dean's breath hitches. God, they're so blue.
His heart was beating so hard it made his vision shake. Dean leaned an elbow against the bed of the truck, which was still warm from where he'd had Cas pressed up against the steel, and gasped in cool, rusty air. He shivered as the wind blew on the back of his neck, leaving him cold and sweaty.
He kissed Dean for several long, exquisite moments, certain that he would be able to do this for all time and not tire of it. Standing now, Dean pressed close against him, and Cas crowded him even closer, wrapping an arm around his waist. The shape of Dean's body was intoxicating, and after years of watching him from a safe distance, it was his turn to finally touch it.
"Do you not hear yourself?" Jonah got to his feet. "Do you not know what it is to process all information in Earth's domain through a human vessel?"
"You're not," Dean assured him, ducking past and clapping him on the shoulder as he headed for the door. "Come on."
Dean leaned back against one of the tires. The truck bed came up almost to his shoulders. "You wanna talk about it?"
God, how embarrassing. He has to lighten the mood somehow. No way he should be feeling this sappy; good thing Cas can't read minds anymore. He's getting soft in his old age—physically
about a lot of things, but also not. It's complicated. Over-a-decade-of-history kinds of complicated.
"What?" He can't possibly be having this discussion while he's sober. Dean white-knuckles the edge of the table. "Why would—? No shit, he knows. Why wouldn't he?"
"I told you not to pick a magic class for your first campaign," Charlie reminded him. "And it's—fine."
"And it hasn't been—" He rolls his hips again, a bit more forcefully this time, and they both rock on the bed. Dean bites his lip from the strain. "It was never like this."
And he thinks that maybe, if he kissed Cas in the rain, he'd be able to keep all this at bay for a while longer. Ease some pressure off the valve. Google was no help, but maybe the weather will save him.
"If it makes you feel any better, the last time this happened, it was my fault," Sam said, his mouth twinging into something that was too regretful to be a smile. "And I mean it was
Dean was a heavy and constant weight atop him, his body moving just enough to draw breath and pump blood.
Dean sighs, rubs at his face. "You don't have to do that, Cas." It would be weird to watch TV with Cas sitting dead silent beside him, but hey, company's company.
Sipping his coffee and skimming the news, though, he wonders if Eileen and Sam had snagged the last remaining case of paranormal activity in the country. He's not quite desperate enough to look for cases in Canada just yet, but it's on the table. There has to be
"You don't need to!" she spat back, jagging a finger at him. "That is what this is about, isn't it? Not reclaiming Heaven, not uniting the angels, none of that. This is about the Winchesters."
"It is, actually. I wasn't going to say anything." Cas stands up again, offering him a faint, amused smile. "Go on. I'll make lunch."
"Castiel." Jonah shifted his grip on him so that they faced each other. In Castiel's periphery, he listened to Tessa resume arguing with Dean. "Theo is up there killing your men. He's going to kill you, too." Jonah reached down and touched his side again, where he'd been stabbed. "I'm injured. I can't heal you and the Michael Sword both. We have to leave."
Dean doesn't bother hiding the huge dumb grin on his face as he approaches. Cas has his eyes closed anyhow. "Tough work."
It's Jody. His spine straightens at her panicked tone, and he keeps the phone to his ear with his shoulder as he clicks his lamp on. The clock beside it reads 7:12am. "
"No," Cas says, his expression carved entirely from marble now. There's no trace of warmth left. "No. You are not making me choose between sex and helping your brother."
As he had told Sam, the stitches in his side did nothing to heal the wound he had sustained from Rachel. It did, however, put to rest the worry he had for Jimmy Novak's body. It would not expire, or need significant reworking. A task he normally thought nothing of, but right now, it was difficult to even be present.
"Hello, Sam." He pushed the pages back to where they'd been laying before. "I hope it's alright that I'm here. I was looking for a… quieter place than the command centre."
"Well, then, you won't have a problem. Finish up your sub, I'm gonna put on Big Lebowski." She shoves a few chips into her mouth and shrugs at his continued gawking. "Like I said, I'm not gonna pry unless you want me to. And I'm really bored, so…."
"Not answering his phone," he muttered, glaring at his cellphone screen before shoving it away. "Idiot."
Angels did not require sleep. Constrained to his vessel as he was, Castiel did not require sleep either, though he felt the effects of its exhaustion. They bottlenecked his higher processes; every thought ran through the filter of his vessel's human brain, which was currently pushed well past its limits. Had Heaven's prisons been open to them all, he knew Bartholomew would have still ordered him to be tortured here on Earth. Human bodies were easier to break.
The knife twisted. Castiel saw white, deafened himself with his own cry for mercy. "I didn't! I didn't deceive Naomi! It was Metatron—please, Theo—"
"Twelve angels have died in the last hour." Tessa's voice was cool, detached, without sentiment or compassion. "More will follow. I doubt anyone will be along."
God, he could pick him up if he wanted to. If Dean asked him to do it. He would in a second. He'd probably do it right now. Jump out of that hole in the ground and haul Dean off his feet, bridal style, and all the world to lay him down on.
Jody listens to him as they continue walking, lips pursed but saying nothing. The expression on her face says enough. You think I don't know how I sound? he wants to ask her. It needs to be said anyway. If that makes him seem hysterical, then whatever, he's a madman. This is clearly a One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest situation, and everyone's auditioning for the part of Nurse Ratched.
"No sweat," Dean said. His fingers came up under Castiel's jaw, and he turned in time to catch Dean's mouth.
Castiel was working up to tell him he probably wouldn't get a reception down here when there was a thud at the door. Dean froze. He glanced at Castiel.
"Relax," Dean whispered, and squeezed where he had his hands wrapped around Cas' biceps. He tipped his head closer, Cas' features smoothing into a pale blur, Dean's mouth just shy of his lips. "You're strung tight."
He chews his lip as he thinks, actually trying this time. "The ears of that bald guy on the insurance billboard we passed about five minutes back."
It's not even the first time Dean's pulled this. He did it once, a couple months ago, using Dirty Dancing as a thin pretext to make out on the couch. And Cas had been very receptive to that, so there must be something else he's missing.
After that, the conversation goes back to safer topics, like Dean telling him that he doesn’t have to go to work the following morning, as they have to change the windows in his office and it will take a couple of hours, so his boss told him to just go in the afternoon.
he sounds like a cheap whore, but he just can’t help it, not when Gorgeous is fucking his ass better than anyone ever has in his fucking life and what has Dean even been doing so far, letting men who aren’t
Jimmy could definitely go from fairly relaxed to wound up super tight in a fraction of a millisecond.
The kiss is as possessive as they go. Cas’s left hand still on his waist to keep him close, his right hand on the side of Dean’s neck to help him keep his neck craned, while Cas’s teeth nib at Dean’s bottom lip. A clear request: open up to me, my love, let me get to what’s mine. And so Dean does. There’s no world in which Dean would deny Cas entrance. Cas’s tongue is thorough and insistent as it slides inside of Dean’s mouth, mapping it, cherishing it, owning it. Even through his own closed eyes Dean knows Cas’s are open. They often are. “I still can’t believe I get to kiss you whenever I want, my love. I need to see it,” Cas always says, making Dean’s heart skip a beat, or twelve, every time.
