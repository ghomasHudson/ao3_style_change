The cab pulled up outside of St. Bart’s. Sherlock grinned at him before climbing out of the cab. “It should be done in a day or two.”
The living room was empty as he padded through. Upon entering the kitchen, John found Sherlock glued to his microscope. He shuffled to the coffee maker, filling it full of water as he asked. “Experiment or the case?”
Lestrade snorted. “Might not be a good idea after Sally informed me about an interesting conversation at the crime scene last night.”
“It wasn’t a panic attack.”
“Then sleep.”
They paused in the corridor. Abstract paintings with different shades of yellow decorated on one side of the wall, brightening the grey. “Well, that confirms your theory,” John muttered. “The yellow paint stained their hands.”
“It is still early to be using past tense considering my brother’s supplies were only surrendered days ago. By evidence, he didn’t start again until after your-”
“So back to the flat then?”
“You shot me!”
He had never thought…
a/n: There's not much to say here except thank you for all who are leaving comments/kudos/and bookmarking this fic. Season 4 is almost here, I'm excited to know that my heart is probably going to get ripped out. Thank you to my beta, who makes everything better- 'englandwouldfalljohn (TheLadyAmalthea).
A small squeak of surprise echoed through the morgue. Both men turned to the quiet woman who was still busy with the corpse on the metal slab. Her eyes flickered between them as she pulled away from the cadaver. “Right. Sorry, Sherlock but the hands stay. I’m going to step out for a bit and…”
Marry immediately cut him off. “AJ and Rosie are my family. I would do anything for them. Moriarty is after me, after Rosie because of what I did. We’ll never be safe unless there’s a trade.”

It seemed that the man was so blinded by his anger that he didn’t care what would happen to him anymore. He would rather see his wife dead rather than to talk to her again. Hell, Mary shot Sherlock, lied about who she was, and he still talked to her about their relationship… eventually. He got over the urge to shout, and shoot things. He would rather have Mary getting a leg over than to shoot Sherlock in the first place.
John walked down the corridor that Lestrade had cleared earlier. He noted the shadows, in a darker grey of squares on the walls. Empty spaces where photos were hung, obvious even without the torch. His footsteps echoed in the hallway, loud against the stillness. Even downstairs carried the same bleakness as the floor above. Life and happiness never existed in this house. He walked into the kitchen, finding blood splatter on the black countertops, and the broken glass door before spotting the victim on the floor. It was easy to see what had killed her.
John opened the door, jumped out of the vehicle despite Lestrade’s protests. “Oy! I thought we agreed for you to stay in the car!”
“No.”
The rest of his words caught in his throat and his mouth clamped shut. He couldn’t even begin to think of Sherlock becoming permanently… dead. Underneath the cold ground. John would not be able to go through another funeral and the rest of his life with that kind of finality, that kind of emptiness. He asked for a miracle once, and you only get one. It seemed like an unwritten rule somewhere out there in the universe. Any more miracles would be selfish. If he were granted another miracle to get this psychopath off their backs, John would gladly use it-.
“Oh? A distraction from what?” asked Ripper mockingly. The man’s grey eyes glinted at Sherlock like gunmetal in the moonlight.
They walked down the hallway to the coffee machine. John eagerly poured himself a cup. He grinned at Molly who was watching him. “My first cup of the day,” he explained weakly. “Our morning didn’t go as planned.”
And it did. As Sherlock step away trying to understand what was going on, John realised he should do something about it. He didn’t want any more distance, walls, or separation. This was the time to piece themselves together with each other, take comfort in each other, embracing each other’s ghosts.
“Asking him what?
“Asked for you, no one else would appreciate my efforts.”
“I’m not good at this, you know. I’ve never been good at this.”
John had hoped that Sherlock would have closed the distance. He would much rather prefer snogging Sherlock than explaining what Mycroft said about Mary, and him, and the blackmail that could possibly tear him and Sherlock apart before any more progress could be made with their ‘all in’.
“And?” prompted John. He locked his eyes on the black shiny shoe hanging at Sherlock’s side by a pale finger. Then he looked down, seeing Sherlock’s black sock, toes wriggling around. “Is that your shoe?” John held up a finger, “Never mind, you’ll explain it, won’t you?”
“I had to improvise.”
John ended the call. His eyes glanced out the window, watching London flash by. He wondered where the hell Sherlock was. What was he doing? What was he thinking? His mobile buzzed, and John sighed in disappointment. Lestrade hadn’t seen him either and he had been texting Sherlock all morning, trying to get ahold of him about the victims’ identities. John groaned aloud. “Sherlock, where the hell are you?”
John peeled out of bed, pushing the tangled white duvet away from him. He tried to lift himself completely out of bed, but with his lower half of his body pinned down, intertwined in Sherlock’s long legs, he motioned Sherlock to let him go. The doctor in him, needed to help Greg. Sherlock leaned over him, and shook his head.
“NO! This isn’t the way it’s supposed to be!” The wheelchair inched a little away from John.
A few more tries, and Sherlock was obviously getting frustrated. John held his hips and helped him readjust. Sherlock made a few comments on the new angle, but all flew by John’s head. He was in an absolute state of bliss, and all he could concentrate on was the man above him, trying to impale himself on his rigid cock.
“No! You can’t leave yet!”
A wooden bang echoed upstairs. John shared a look at Greg and crossed the bedroom, going down the stairs with an arm full of clean clothes. “That was his door. I better get ready before he decides to leave me behind again.”
John noticed right away that he didn’t deny it like any normal person would with those accusations and wasn’t met with either tears or yelling like a rave lunatic. Or threats of bodily harm to Sherlock. Instead, the suspect with the fake name just sat there, waited again for Sherlock to answer his question. And Sherlock did.
Video, Discovery, Confess
John shrugged and leaned against the grey-colored wallpaper. “It counts with Mycroft. It’s either blackmail, power demonstrations, or verbal sparring.”
“Are you serious?”
Proposition, Understanding, Quiet
“I’m hardly the first woman who has been able to carry a child. It doesn’t make me an invalid,” Mary snapped. “The three of us made it out, alright.”
“No, I picked it up from the floor. Your jumper should be on the bed.”
He gagged on disgust. And pity. He saw her sail over the edge with him, the infant that Mary disappeared off with. His child. He could see flashes of Sherlock and his daughter tumbling over the edge. John spat on the rooftop to get the vile taste from his mouth but words kept tumbling out.
“I drugged you with coffee easily enough. Eventually theory turns into practice.”
John’s suggestion fell on deaf ears. He shrugged off his coat, and got to work. He stared at the computer for a moment, wondering where to start. Might as well from the beginning. He pecked at the keyboard, fruitlessly looking through the Internet search engines for ‘Issac Spoo.’ His search was failing miserably by the minute, getting results of spoons benders, funeral homes, and where to buy wooden spoons. On the seventh page of scrolling through of five-starred rating wooden spoons, he gave up.
Then Sherlock leaned forward, catching John in a deep, filthy snog, shutting the army doctor up. John returned it was vigor. He had immediately forgotten that he was in the middle of a sentence. His hands were released, and slowly beelined to Sherlock’s weakness, and threaded through the inky curls, earning a deep rumble from the detective.
The aroma of buttered chicken, green curry, and baked naan carried throughout the flat. It blended into the homey scent of Sherlock’s chemicals, burnt ashes from the fireplace, and the thin layer of dust. Any other time John would have happily inhaled the flavorful meal. He would have happily enjoyed being in their flat, with Sherlock, with the open possibility of more domesticity hanging over their heads. Instead, he stared at the plate in his lap, frowning. He was still moderately angry after his “conversation” with Mycroft, and seeing Greg in their flat didn’t help whatsoever. John couldn’t look, didn’t dare to look, at the silver-haired detective inspector because he knew what would pour out of his mouth if he did.
“Greg,” John corrected automatically, rolling his eyes at Sherlock as he poured the eggs into the pan on the stove. “It was my second time trying to talk someone down,” John fought the urge to look over at Sherlock. Fought against the way his stomach sunk at thinking about Sherlock on the mobile, on the pavement, and the heartbreak that had followed him for two years afterwards. Then everything with Mary. Fought against thinking about the criminal jumper last night with the infant. “Never had to in the army, and it’s a bloody good thing that I’m a doctor. I would make a shite therapist.”
His feet slapped on the pavement. Faces blurred together. He could barely hear the sounds of complaint as he slammed into strangers through the wind in his ears. He couldn’t feel the cold rain drops on his face. John burst through the black door, ran up the stairs, and pushed hurriedly into the flat. He stood panting, breathless, in the doorway. His eyes met Sherlock’s, who sat perched in his chair. John could hear his own heart beating, pounding in his head as he stepped further into the sitting room.
“And what did you say when Mycroft told you that?”
“No, it’s not!”
Judging from that infliction, it was too small to be a plain gunshot. John had seen a spread of gunshot wounds, this injury seemed too…he didn’t know how explain it, but gunshot wasn’t right. It seemed messier, or should have been with the amount of blood staining the victim’s back. John glanced over to Sherlock. He cringed slightly, finding the taller man working on the first victim with his small magnifying glass, digesting clues with his eyes whilst taking pictures with his mobile, and putting the puzzle together with his genius mind. Not to mention, sniffing the body. Before John could even protest about the ‘not good’ bit, Sherlock stood, then immediately sprang to John’s side, looking over the second victim with as much precision as the first.
Chapter 11
“Yes, and his presence add to your suffering,”
The air changed when John realized how close they had naturally migrated together. Their legs danced around each other’s. His hand somehow found Sherlock’s knee during their conversation. Through Sherlock’s dark trousers, John could feel how warm the other man was. John stared at his hand on Sherlock’s knee, and then shifted his glance up to Sherlock’s eyes. From knowing Sherlock as well as he did, John could see there was an undercurrent of annoyance, amusement, mirth, and something else.

“Well, that’s the way it’s going now. There’s no light. No Sherlock. It’s come down to you and me here Moriarty. One of us is dying tonight, or both if that’s what it takes. But you’re not allowed to come back from the dead a second time.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I want the precise time of arrival.”
Then John grabbed the steering wheel, yanking it with a hard turn, hoping the cab would drive onto the pavement so at least giving him the time to get the jump on Moran. He would either go for the gun, or at least make a decent get away to take Moriarty down on his own time.
“Sherlock Holmes-” John sighed with relief at Sherlock’s calm baritone, which the detective’s tone immediately changed at John’s sigh.
“What-”
“He certainly doesn’t need them anymore.”
“As I recall, there was doctor who recommended that I should.”
“It’s nothing to worry about. I’ll handle it. I thought Mycroft might have sent you to remind me of it, good to know that’s not the case. Can you pass a message for me?”
“So, we go back in and ask him?”
“Room 165,” she answered sharply. “A friend of yours?”
Sure enough, the footage was new. The walls were brick now, no longer the stale grey inside of New Scotland Yard’s interrogation rooms. Or showing Mr. Hageman glazed eyes.
Now the conversation moved into a silent exchange between the two brothers, John’s head turned back and forth, hoping to pick up on the wordless discussion. Moments later, Sherlock turned his head away, his violin wedged underneath his chin. Mycroft moved to the open door that John neglected to close behind him. John watched as the older Holmes brother twirled his usual accessory in his hand in habitual motion, even if the umbrella was unneeded for today.
“That’s enough.”
“Yeah, it did. But that’s not all-,” Lestrade answered before his voice grew muffled, followed by a shout. “Don’t move the body! Get someone in here to take a damn picture of it!”
The robe swished lightly when Sherlock crossed the room. The dark curls brushing over the pale forehead mesmerized John, and gray eyes staring down at him, studying him. Sherlock’s mouth was fixed in a thin line.
“Oh? So you got the death threat text too?” John echoed in a question. Sherlock’s head shot up from the microscope, eyes gleaming in interest. He looked like he was going to snatch the mobile from John’s hand. John took a step back, just in case and he was right to do so when Sherlock launched his lanky frame towards John.
“I haven’t missed another Wednesday, have I?” asked John jokingly.
Before John could question, Moriarty lunged, splashing into the pool.
“That will work.”
The mobile popped in his hand, startling John once more. This time he held it, not wanting to seem like a complete weirdo, throwing mobiles in the early morning hours. The blue screen faded into black, taking the message into oblivion along with it. John pressed an array of buttons, trying to recall how to switch on this kind of mobile. It was adamant about staying dead and it was apparent to John that there was nothing he could do to bring it back to life.
John licked his lips, focusing on the blond and the brunet- there was something about the brunet that he couldn’t place. “Sherlock, doesn’t the blond male look a bit like the jumper from last night? I mean, from what was left of him at the morgue. About the same height and weight.”
John sighed. “Well, that explains the vultures then.”
“And drugs,” Molly blurted out guiltily. John groaned. He leaned on the door, his head thumping on the wood, his eyes looking at the ceiling. “Molly, I asked you-”
Was still alive.

A/N: There is going to be a lot of updating today, just to try get Chapter 27 jumped started in my head. Don't you hate it when you're working on one story and another idea pops into your head?- Well, that's me now. Like I said before, I'm hoping to wrapping up this fic, but trying not to rush it at the same time. Thank you to all the feedback. Another thank to my beta- Whitehart, who knocked out five chapterS over the past weekend!
“You don’t want her blood on your hands,” John murmured simply. “The affair was an error on her part, not yours. You don’t have to add another death to your toll. Give us her full name and we can go about things the legal way. Right, Detective Inspector?” John asked, casting a glance towards Lestrade, who nodded.
“John’s appetite doesn’t have a definite schedule unlike your tea delivery, Mrs. Hudson.”
“Doesn’t Mycroft have the flat bugged? Couldn’t he look-”
“Tell brother mine that the real Mr. Moran did not escape from prison on my watch but never was incriminated. Unfortunately, I was…blindsided and a replacement had taken his place for his crimes.”
And John didn’t wait for a farewell, a dismissal, or an offer for a ride from Lestrade. He ran into the night until he reached the main road, hailed a cab, and climbed inside. John glanced outside while he was engulfed in the silent dark of the back seat. It wasn’t even daylight yet, and everything has managed to go to shite. He rubbed his hands on his thighs, in a hurry to get to Sherlock.
John slipped off his stool, and stood up before he asked.
John could only hope Mycroft knew it too. The pompous prick probably did, and John only hoped that Mycroft would keep them both save.
Sherlock huffed with a half grin on his face. “Dramatic.”
His heart pounded in his chest. Heat pooled into his lower body, reacting in a surprising fashion considering the source. He wasn’t gay, but his body reacted in ways that told him that the idea was fine. Oh, it was just fine. Just fine really. The hand that wasn’t occupied by the gun, reached for stability from the sticky floor. His hand landed on something warm, solid, and it jumped underneath his touch. John glanced down, finding his hand on Sherlock’s thigh. John fought every urge to glance over at Sherlock, wondering if…
John rolled his eyes and grinned back. “It might be a problem for you. Instead of Sherlock going into the Met stealing paperwork, he would have me do it and bring them home to him.”
“You changed your password. ‘Fort Knox’, clever.”
“I’m not angry.”
“Like a bell?”
He looked up and met Sherlock’s eyes.
The mobile he stole from the crime scene burned a hole in his pocket, but with Sherlock’s status currently unknown, he could not care less what it will bring.
John groaned lightly when Sherlock’s hand wrapped around his cock. He hummed at the languid pace that Sherlock had set. It was part torture and pleasurable at the same time. His thumb circling the head, smearing precum around the tip, while the other four fingers and palm rubs slowly on his shaft. An obscene moan escaped his lips when Sherlock reached the other hand down from behind and massaged his balls.
“I hope I don’t have to,” answered John. “But I will.”
Sherlock opened his mouth as if to interrupt but John pressed forward.
Their mobiles went off simultaneously. They both ignored it.
An eye roll accompanied Sherlock’s words. “Fine, the whole tedious process would slow us down anyways. Mycroft will handle it; it’s the least he can do.”
“A question,” John echoed disbelievingly and scoffed. “What kind of question?”
His eyes connected with the man below him, charging the air full of whatever was building between the. Sexual tension, maybe? Lust, mostly likely. Love? Infatuation? Could be. John closed the distance. His nose tickled against inky curls, his lips landed on Sherlock’s forehead because Sherlock’s mouth was parted, silently begging to be kissed. John worked lightly down, peppering the pale skin with light touches. He whispered words into Sherlock’s skin. Oh, what has Sherlock done to him?
He felt that wave of relief that he hadn’t wounded Greg by accident. It was one thing to shoot at the mirror; it was another to shoot at a friend. Or a flatmate.  John followed Sherlock’s conversation, while his hearing faded in and out to follow pieces. Sherlock looked at John and mouthed. “ Shot at. Surprisingly, you missed him considering being in such a close range. You certainly didn’t miss Jefferson Hope and he was much farther away.”
It was overwhelming. The infinite swirls of colours in Sherlock’s eyes. The emotions that was fixated on him, radiating from their depths. John could see himself. As sweaty, as flushed, perched underneath the man who was infinitely his, as much as he was Sherlock’s. The connection John felt as though it would carry through universes, through lifetimes
“You’re a good man, John. We both know that. I’m relying on your moral compass to…”
“Sherlock,” John whispered sternly.
“Doesn’t your brother’s happiness mean anything to you?”
They climbed into the cab. John shifted between looking out the window and glancing over at Sherlock, whose façade disappeared the moment they pulled away from the block of flats. Orange lights enhanced Sherlock’s features; John noted that his eyes were larger than normal. Shocked.
He groaned when he thought of something else, something he wished he had thought of in the beginning. He stood up, ignoring the dizzy wave that overcame him, and wished at the same time that people would stop hitting him in the head for god’s sake.
“No, he’s not my husband. My wife left me two months ago.”
John rolled his eyes and ignored more of Sherlock’s complaining moans. John’s hands trembled as he opened the foil and rolled the condom over himself. He quickly grabbed the lube bottle and he pumped over himself once, shuddering from the sensation. He was as pent up as Sherlock and he stood, he not wanting to tease either of them anymore. Fixing Sherlock’s position to have each of Sherlock’s legs over his arms. John leaned forward, lined his throbbing cock against Sherlock’s opening and gently pushed in deeper, deeper and deeper until he was fully seated.
“John, Sherlock, you know I wouldn’t have called if we knew something.”
“Wrong.”
Sherlock’s head shook slightly. John sighed. Nothing. No leads or at least no serial killer here. He leaned back in his chair, wondering how long until this course was over and they could return to the flat. John tucked the piece of charcoal on the easel, grimacing at the stain on his fingertips.
“This is murder, not a mugging,” stated Sherlock. He waved his hand over the crime scene. “A 70kg person contains 5.5 liters of blood. Times that by two. There are no traces of blood on this pavement. So where is it? I don’t recall blood being able to evaporate out of thin air. The bodies were dumped here.”
He angled forward, planning to capture Sherlock’s mouth when he countered, “What about today then?”
“No, and yes. Under 48 hours would be ideal considering the fact that my life is on the line.”
“But the allergic reaction…”
Sherlock cut in, “I didn’t lie. I simply refrained sharing the information with you. Would it be better for you to hear that I had been taking drugs again to broaden my span of thinking, that I can discover new leads to find Mary?”
Figuratively, John realised he would not be able to live without this madman, and all the things they had been through for each other was worth it. It was worth this moment.
John ripped out of the water, fixing his towel around his waist before yanking open the bathroom door. “You’re not going to bother Mrs. Hudson for your bloody-”
Sherlock brushed past him, tugging his scarf into place, looking as pristine as usual when he opened the office door. John’s jaw dropped again. “How did you even do that? Get dressed so fast?”
“Are you ever going to elaborate why I’m here? Because I really don’t have time for waiting around. Your brother is expecting take-out, and I prefer it warm. So, it’s either say why I’m in this car, or pull over. I don’t fancy having a chat in an abandoned warehouse halfway across London…again.”
“I heard the violin while I was walking back. It sounded like something new.”
“Yes.”
“About twenty minutes ago,” answered the DI in confusion. “What are you thinking? What are you both thinking?”
“So the killer will mess up?”
A/N: So? Why do you think she's back? *Give me your thoughts!*
The corridors were empty by the time they had paid the cabbie and ventured into the main building. University students rode up on the lift with them before exiting the elevator on the third floor at a run. John didn’t question to where they were heading, knowing all full well that Sherlock probably knew where to go. The music in the lift continued to play until the doors opened on fourth floor, revealing an empty corridor painted dull grey, lined with office doors.
He had dared to ask, ignoring the flicker of doubt that Sherlock wouldn’t want this again. Regardless of Sherlock asking him what he wanted. Regardless of the Sherlock snogging him first. Asking whether or not John wanted him. Christ, he did. And like Sherlock, there were some things to use as an advantage. The taller detective did it all the time. Even if his words were an empty threat, one glance over John’s face and the detective would know it too. Sherlock stared, glaring over him before sweeping by, sighing dramatically as he sat down in his kitchen chair. His darkened eyebrow arched at John, wordlessly telling him to get on with the torture, otherwise known as, ‘Substance.’ John couldn’t help but to grin.
“Git,” John murmured with affection. His hands caressed over Sherlock’s face, pale hands suddenly captured his, pulling at him until John sat alongside Sherlock on the bed. It was John’s turn to be nervous. He twisted his hands out of Sherlock’s larger ones. “Sherlock-”
Sherlock pulled away. John’s lips still buzzed from the contact as he met Sherlock’s grey-green eyes. “I didn’t die though. If Moriarty was slightly cleverer or myself a little less…well…”
John seized two pale ankles and threw each one over each of his shoulders.
Moran nodded. “The time’s changed. Later is now. Get in.”
“Well, what was I supposed to do with it?”
“Ta again,” muttered Lestrade, lifting his mug towards John in a silent cheers before taking another sip. “This case…”
I'm here, I'm alive, I love you.
“She was definitely a harlot,” muttered Sherlock, and John covered it with a cough. He glared over his shoulder at Sherlock, telling him wordlessly to shut it. By some miracle, Sherlock received that message. Lestrade pressed forward through John’s well-timed coughs.
God. They had kissed. It seemed unbelievable to fathom after so many years. And it was a fantastic kiss. But what exactly did it mean for them? Was it a one-time thing? Was it a point that Sherlock had to make to ‘fix’ what he broke? John rinsed the shampoo from his hair, trying to mute out the questions that plagued his mind with the sounds of running water before shutting off the tap completely.
Wordlessly, Joseph turned away, and left the flat. John took back his hand, surprised more than anything, and closed the door behind him. The sounds of stomping footsteps echoed through the door, which was followed by a hard slam. Typically, the abuse of the front door was a reaction to Sherlock. Not to him. And here he thought that he was rather kind after Sherlock’s refusal.
Back at 221B, the boys talk to each other, and make up
“Don’t Sherlock-,” he murmured lowly. Wondering if he could make it through this conversation without scrambling for words like he always did. Words, emotions, were not his strong suit. Give him a gun, tell him shoot, he could handle. He thrived on it actually. Words escaped him. Emotions too. “I don’t want to hear that you’ve…” he trailed off.
A/N: So, I'm having a bloody awful crap day! I decided to update it hopes that it would make me feel better. Please give love, kindness, and kudos. And don't forget to thank whitehart, who mostly provided the 'mmm' in smut. And yell at me for ending the way I did.
John rubbed his forehead. “You can’t cut the hands off.”
“Must you?” growled Sherlock before capturing John’s mouth again.
“It’s not like he’s going to poison the food, John. You know as well as I do that it’s not possible.”
“Probably not.”
“Not here.” John delivered a terse reply, which Moriarty disregarded with a laugh.
Understanding immediately crossed over Sherlock’s features. John released his grip on the counter when his feet met the floor, thankfully missing any porcelain remains shattered on the floor between them. Sherlock stepped over the mess, closing the distance and relieving the strain between them. The detective’s hands remained on John’s skin, tilting his face upwards. John’s eyes roamed over the reddened mouth, the slight flush to Sherlock’s cheeks, and then to Sherlock’s eyes.
“How do you know Mary?”
He walked through the flat, noting to put away his gun when he returned from downstairs. There was another thump when he reached the lower landing. John knocked on Mrs. Hudson’s door.
John could definitely not defend himself, and it resulted in a frown towards Sherlock. He had been hung up on quite a bit with the list of ex-girlfriends he’s had, but he didn’t know if he should be offended on how Sherlock announced it. John settled for mentioning Sherlock’s lack of sensitivity on that matter.
“Oh. Is it my birthday?”
He threw the bottle of lube on the floor. Then waited for Sherlock let out another insufferable sigh, which he did, and John timely brushed over Sherlock’s entrance, and stroked his cock at the same time. That made Sherlock gasp, and nearly fell from the bed in surprise. John’s pride was very much in tact now, slowly but surely unfolding Sherlock.
“I am allowed to express concerns when it comes to my siblings, Sherlock in particular.”
“Where’s the blood, Lestrade?”
His name in that tone from Sherlock’s lips, it was beautiful.
John pulled his jumper off over his head. “I’ll invest in a GPS tracker.” He paused. “Sherlock…”
“The infant wasn’t yours.”
“Damn,” the detective inspector cursed, and stalked through the Met. John matched his strides. Even before John could see Sherlock, he could hear the low insistent baritone carried through the air. Donovan’s annoyed tone argued back, with the usual attached insult of ‘freak’. They rounded the corner, John readying to Sherlock’s defense and side when Lestrade cut to it first.
The flat door opened before John could say anything. There was silence. John knew what this looked like. He was scantily clad in a towel, dripping wet, perched over Sherlock. His hand angled into the couch for Sherlock’s pocket. From the door, it probably looked bad. Judging from Mrs. Hudson’s widened eyes, a smile blooming across her face, he was right.

“Histamine would disappear at demise due to the deficiency of brain activity, thus no allergic reaction can be tested on the victim. But it does not mean that we cannot examine the suspect for exposure on his hands.”
“Wasn’t my fault the first or second time.”
John hummed. “Apparently.”
“221 Baker Street,” demanded John at the cabbie before turning back to Sherlock. The detective was huddled in the farthest corner of the cab. Sherlock curled his long body against himself, obviously avoiding any physical contact with John. His mobile buzzed again. John grabbed it, answering it snappishly. “What, Mycroft?”
“Not Mycroft,” came Greg’s voice from the other side with a sigh. “I just want to let you know that I called him. He’s looking into it now. How’s Sherlock? I’ve never seen him like that.”
“Then run,” John nodded over to the busy road. “I doubt you’ll go far considering…”
Each step had to be stealthy and measured in the narrow white staircase. The wood underneath his feet barely made a sound. John felt adrenaline coursing through him, a sense of purpose and power. The gun in his hand held steady. The light was still as well. In fact, both his gun and the torch were the steadiest and surest thing now compared to the situation. The wife could be dead. Someone could be in the house. John didn’t know how Lestrade was faring downstairs without backup. He knew to clear of any threats on the second floor, before returning back downstairs.
John shared a victorious smile with Mrs. Hudson in the sitting room out of Sherlock’s view, both knowing that was probably the best they would get out of the detective.
“There’s another person, helping him,” answered Sherlock. “His wife wasn’t dead when he was brought in, and he wasn’t planning on killing her himself. Someone was going to do the dirty work for him... or already did the dirty work for him while we were in there.”
“John.”
“The shooter’s motivation, spurred lover, perhaps. I’ve seen enough of the scene, I need to have a chat with the shooter.”
John’s hands went to Sherlock’s hands on his belt. Then he paused. He arched his eyebrows at the detective, who might have been having a staring contest with his trousers. John wasn’t sure. Sherlock had said he wanted to go to bed, together… perhaps he had changed his mind. There’s way no way to guess what was on that brilliant man’s mind.
“Yes. Assuming Molly does her job correctly, the samples should be getting analyzed soon.”
There was a peeved huff from behind him.
In five minutes time, John was dressed and downstairs, sitting, reading through their most recent bills. Or he was trying to read through the most recent bills, wondering what would have happened. Why his eyes were centered on Sherlock’s mouth. Why he practically vibrated with desire to pull him closer, and why he regretted pulling away. He watched the clock, seeing if Sherlock was going to be true to his ten-minute deduction. Sherlock stalked into the living room, pristine as usual, pulling on his large coat with swiftness. It had been eight minutes. John stood and grabbed his coat. Off they went.
“So?”
“Care to elaborate?” John asked, and Sherlock stalked away again. John sighed in exasperation, stomping after him. He was a bit irritated with the taller man and his stupid long legs.
“Please get on the bed, John,” whimpered Sherlock. His face was the picturesque of the word ‘wrecked’, with wild eyes, flushed lips. He dropped his forehead on John’s shoulder and stuttered, “If…you…I won’t last long.”

Silence hung in the air between them as they left the hospital, climbed into a cab, and finally, thankfully, arrived back home to Baker Street.
“I’m not a serial killer, Lestrade,” snapped Sherlock. His voice echoed in a snarl within the flat. “Desperation, recognition, power, control, take your pick. There are multiple undesirable traits that may relate to this individual.”
“You want me to explain to Mrs. Hudson that the position in which she caught us wasn’t ‘groping’ or anything of that sort, but simply you digging into my trousers for my mobile phone?”
“Of course,” John snorted. His laughter bounced down the empty corridor. He shook his head at Sherlock. “Only you would think about drugging your brother with cake.”
Sherlock grinned darkly as he retorted. “Or join me in the shower.”
John pointed to a flier next to a darkened door. “Well, they’re looking for modeling volunteers tonight. Could sit there and deduce everyone in the classroom at once,” he mentioned lightly as a joke. Sherlock’s chin rested on John’s shoulder. A grin bloomed across the detective face.
When his lungs burned for the need of air, John pulled away, pushing at the taller man’s shoulder. He watched as Sherlock’s eyes opened to meet his, John remained stunned from the contact and from the starling silver color of his eyes.
“I lost track for me, they’ve been moving me all around and they just brought you here. They had to carry you inside and she knocked you out again, though I doubt you remember it much of that.”
He glanced over to Moran, who seemed to be stirring back as quickly as John. His eyes glared before an arm came swinging. John deflected, smashing the arm to the headrest. He swung his right, getting Moran in chin. Not the hit he wanted.
“You do remember I spent some time in a tact team? In Afghanistan? I’m not exactly helpless.”
There was a moment of silence. John was determined to make Sherlock ask properly. He stuck out his tongue and licked a wet, hot, long stripe from Sherlock’s perineum up to his entrance, and poked the tip of his tongue in, right next to his thumb.
Lestrade’s tinny voice echoed from the other side. Sherlock had terrible mobile reception in the lab. “John? Are you with Sherlock?”
Silence befell the DI’s simple office in New Scotland Yard while three men crowded around a computer. John watched the footage of the CCTV over Sherlock’s right shoulder. The scent of the detective’s cologne wafted over his nose, the pale column of Sherlock’s neck teased him with every throb of Sherlock’s pulse. John licked his lips; glances flickered between skin and screen. His shoulder brushed against Greg’s, who was perched over Sherlock’s other shoulder, watching the small computer screen with rapt attention. John signed deeply, ignoring whether to follow his impulse or his urge to solve the case so he could get on with snogging a certain detective. Not Greg. The other detective. He had to consider his intuition as well, waiting for his impending divorce in order to snog said detective. John shook his head, erasing that last thought. It was no longer pending divorce, at least, according to the text message that burned within his pocket when he glanced at outside of Bart’s while Sherlock had hailed a cab.
John shook his head, and grinned at the ‘as-badly’ remark.
Sherlock flatly stated, “Withdrawal symptom,” before leaving the kitchen. A moment later melody radiated from the violin and its player in the living room, flooding the flat with music. Remaining in the kitchen, John couldn’t help but feel like Sherlock was avoiding the situation. Was maybe lying to him. After all, he did hear the word ‘Liar’ spill from Sherlock’s lips. Who was the liar? What was Sherlock talking about? Was
Not doing laundry was a lingering thought- it disappeared as soon as Sherlock’s wet and hot mouth stretched around him, taking his cock in with the perfect amount of suction that made his toes curl, and his eyes fall close.
The heat of Sherlock’s hands burned onto his bare hips, holding him still and the insufferable clothes out of the way. Then Sherlock did something absolutely fantastic with his mouth.
And that’s what John gets for letting his guard down just a bit.
“What situation, Lestrade? I would understand your late-night barge-in to present a fresh crime scene to me since everyone is an idiot at New Scotland Yard, but what kind of crime scene has a situation is- ‘with it’ that is too great for London’s ‘finest’?”
Disclaimer: I don't own BBC Sherlock, or any other variations.
John couldn’t finish his sentence. Words failed him just from feeling the way Sherlock’s body welcomed him. He caressed inside the tight heat, scissoring his fingers, stretching the muscles in hopes that Sherlock’s body would welcome him again.
“It was obvious that she found you attractive.”
John shook his head, forgoing his remark about the suit. Nothing could ruin the line of the suit on Sherlock. On other’s, maybe. Or point out the fact that Sherlock carries his mobile around, and that doesn’t ruin the line either.
John sighed and paused, staring at Sherlock, who was staring back at him intensely. Grey-green eyes flickered over John’s features, pausing on his mouth. John licked his lips, and was satisfied when Sherlock inhaled sharply. Grinning, John caressed over startling cheekbone and pressed a kiss to it.
His remark got Sherlock to chuckle lightly, “I don’t know.”
John stood up and bent over, pressing his lips to the crisscross scars littered on Sherlock’s back. He pulled out his thumb, and pushed in his index finger. He held Sherlock still, when the detective tried to move past John’s first knuckle. They needed more lube if they were going to continue. He pulled his hands away and stepped back.
John huffed, because only Sherlock would have something like John’s fingerprints memorised. He shouldn’t be surprised by it. This was coming from the man who stole his birth certificate in order to know his horrible middle name. He should be prepared to find out if Sherlock had some bits of his hair tucked away somewhere. It may be better if John didn’t know. He grinned towards Sherlock at the absurdity of that thought.
John’s eyes snapped open and to the pair of eyes looking at him in the rearview mirror. The message was a threat on Sherlock…had something already happened? Could that be the reason why Sherlock was hurt?
John stood and tucked the gun into his waistband. He walked over to collect Mary’s gun, and Mrs. Hudson beat him to it.
“Did the text specifically said London, John? It has to be a worldwide search,” answered Sherlock.
“Are you saying-“
He fixed the seatbelt around Moran’s neck, and pulled.
John grinned at Molly. “Good for you, Molly. Cheers.”
“So, this is it then?” John asked, nodding at their guns pointed at each other. “I go, never meeting my daughter, never getting to say goodbye?”

“-But I didn’t want to kill her or have her killed. You don’t either. When you marry someone, build a life with someone, and she betrays you, it’s difficult to put it past you, but you work at it. Then someday you can look back and let it go.”
“Maybe you should,” said Greg. “Just for fun. I go to the Apollo sometimes, they do a stand up night, I’ll take you.” He started to smile then he added hastily, “To
And he had had to accept that John
"Why are you thanking me now?"
“Oh, well, ok then,” said John, slightly relieved. Those cats sounded pretty vicious actually, and anyway, with the exception of his new friend, Persephone, he was more of a dog person. “I’ll get the milk,” he said, and he did so.

- either what he had put John through or how John would feel when he realised Sherlock was alive after all. Sherlock had only begun to understand after, when he was alone, wiping the blood from his face in the empty street, watching the taxi with John and Mary inside it disappear away into the night. Only then he had begun to understand how John felt.
John lowered the note again. “What?! Make some sense!” he said in exasperation, crossing his arms to listen, and still holding the note between his fingers.
He was referring to news from Greg Lestrade, who was supposed to be supplying them with results on a suspect's DNA test.
*Markses = colloquial term, short for a famous shop actually called, ‘Marks and Spencers’ - which is a more upmarket high-street shop. It is a British institution. Markses/Marks/Marks and Sparks are all affectionate terms as M&S (which is another name for it!) has been around since 1884…
…Because…?
'It's like being on holiday,' thought John, following Sherlock, feeling like a child again, and remembering long ago stays with Scottish relatives in the Christmas holidays.
it’s your favourite.”
Enjoy...!
The author of his favourite poem about loneliness and longing and unrequited love had given him some advice.
Sherlock didn't answer.
It was a large piece of thick, rough finished, pale-cream card. John recognised the look of it when he got closer before he even picked it up - it was expensive and handmade, clearly from the art and craft supply shop nearby. He could also now see it was an actual home-made card, and he turned it over to see what was on the front. Sherlock had just folded the piece of card neatly in half and drawn a simplified outline of a large (more or less) anatomically correct heart on the front in black Sharpie pen. In the centre of the heart, he had written
"Nothing at all," Anderson snapped. And he got out at the next floor. Sherlock got out of the lift himself after him, and turned to go the other way, and then bumped, literally, into Donovan coming round the corner from the staircase at some speed.
to…” he turned to go, feeling totally humiliated.
Greg had managed the waistcoat and he hung the hanger on the inside of the open wardrobe door, turning to glance up out of the window. The sky was black as jeweller’s velvet, hung with sparkling stars, the moon a stage light shining bright down onto the silent back yards and gardens of Greg’s street.
But Greg was quicker off the mark with his suggestion for what it had been. “—Quite interestin’?” he interrupted instantly, with a huge grin, and they both fell about laughing. Warm in Gregory’s bed, held close in Gregory’s arms, Mycroft thought he had laughed more in the last four hours than he had in the last six months.
There was another long, charged and very significantly quiet silence. John looked back at Sherlock, now looking less like a rodent and more like a slightly defiant rabbit caught in headlights, and Sherlock looked back at him with his
Sherlock just frowned and shook his head slowly in bewilderment. John took a deep breath and rubbed at his face again. "I met Mary when I was...very low...after you…after you
John had to stifle a laugh.
…" said John, honestly, breathing hard, staring into Sherlock's eyes.
smile playing on his face. His eyes roved southwards down Mycroft’s body and back up again in quite a leisurely fashion. He hadn’t said a single word yet, but the flirtation mode in Greg’s brain had powered up again and it was running at full strength.
John was suddenly angry again and he sat upright in his own and learned forward quickly. "Yes,
With his left hand and forearm he reached round, gripping hard and tight around Mycroft’s arse and hip and back, and swiftly pulled him close, deftly controlling the angle and position of Mycroft’s cock with his other hand. With both his hands, his grip was fierce, but his mouth and tongue were gentle. Mycroft sucked in air in a sharp gasp and almost sighed it out in a long, low, shuddering moan. His own hands and long fingers tentatively found their way to Greg’s broad shoulders, his neck, the side of his face, feeling the stubble on his jaw, his hair…his gorgeous,
And his prayer had been answered.
…But what
Mycroft…” whispered Greg, shaking his head a little and, looking up at him, the tips of his fingers stroking lightly up and down on Mycroft’s glistening cock. He was breathing as hard as Mycroft was.
Now onto Gabriella. He turned slightly to look at her. “I knew you were left-handed because of the finger prints on the side of the canvas, and the prints were not paint after all, as I’d first thought, they were mud, but estuary mud, it has a very beige grey look, and a silty, silky feel to it and it was very fresh. There were lots of right hand finger prints and thumb prints on the edges and on the back, all on the right of the canvas where it had been held it with the right hand, so, showing that the artist was left-handed and the small size of the prints showed this was either a woman or a very small man.The indentation marks on the canvas were from a carrying frame, and there were plenty, so the painting had been in and out of the carrying frame, which suggested the artist was local to the scene depicted and had often walked to the spot to paint it from life. Lots of the paintings were coastal, or seascapes, some of the same scene but from different viewpoints.”
"Yes, because of Mary, but also because of you,” John replied, as he rubbed at his face.
something!" John demanded. "Tell me…something…
“…All sounds truly enchanting,” murmured Mycroft gently, pouring out tea into several Cornishware mugs for whoever wanted a cup.
, Mycroft surmised. But why did Greg have it? Perhaps a question for another day, then, he thought. Mycroft hung his coat next to it, and as he did so, Gregory called out suddenly from the kitchen,“Highland Park, Laphroaig or Glenfarclas?”
Suddenly there was a monstrous cry of "Siggy,
He turned his head so his mouth was directly next to Gregory’s ear, noting how wonderful his hair smelt. He leant closer, taking his time, and as he spoke, he allowed his breath to deliberately fill the pale, waiting whorl of Greg’s ear in three hot and powerfully whispered syllables.
to be!' she kept wailing to me. So then I got angry. I told her he
“You’re not!” he interrupted firmly, holding his phone, now looking quite sternly at Mycroft. “I asked you to stay, didn’t I? I’d much rather be ‘ere snuggled up with you this morning than running around in the damp an’ cold, gettin’ cheerfully beaten up while I freeze my bloody nuts off!”
It was like that playground game where you dared your friend to say the worst word they knew, but this was an adult version, and John was certainly experiencing a very adult response.
“Oh, here we go," muttered Sherlock, through gritted teeth. Now in the kitchen, there was a second, much louder cry of “Lu-Lu,
“Hang on,” instructed Greg, “I just need to reach my...” he twisted, half turning, half hanging off the bed, and stretched up under Mycroft to reach the knob on the drawer of his bedside table. He yanked it open and rummaged sightlessly (but effectively) around in his upside down position. “It’s in ‘ere somewhere,” he added, feeling about for whatever it was, making Mycroft smile at his contortionism. Mycroft also had the most temptingly glorious view of his neck; tendons and muscles taut with the strain of his awkward position, and so rather than helping his lover in finding what it was he was looking for, Mycroft helped himself to Greg’s lovely brown skin instead. He lowered his head and touched his tongue lightly to Greg’s neck, working his way up and nipping gently with his teeth. Greg snorted. “Yeah, make it more difficult, why don’t yer?” he said, amused, and then he suddenly located the item he was looking for. “Ah-ha!” he exclaimed in delight, as his fingers landed on something in the depths of the drawer, and Mycroft looked up to see what he had. Greg was clutching a small, blue glass bottle. It didn’t have a label on it, but Mycroft recognised the very distinctive Neal’s Yard shape of the bottle. “Unscented almond oil,” explained Greg. “I don’t have any…erm…
That was so unexpected that John was momentarily rendered completely speechless.
John was then informed, over some freshly-made clementine mince pies produced hot from the Aga by Siger and a desperately needed cup of tea supplied by Lucia, that a Great Aunt Agatha was to be joining them later for dinner.
come over there…”
"An oaf with a big fist didn't like the very accurate observation I made about his upbringing." Sherlock said.
"From his point of view, a paring knife was maybe not the best choice of murder weapon," commented John, wryly.
“Not much chance of that with these asbestos plates…” murmured Mycroft, mostly to himself.
thought Sherlock, remembering like a shock of cold water one of the first real deductions he had made about Mary.
He accepted it.
He had learnt how to do this.
She opened the cottage front door as Sherlock led the bike and trailer away down the alleyway, and she deposited the stool and the canvas carrying case into a specially designed holding box just inside the front door, against the wall, next to which stood a pair of ancient red Hunter wellies, lightly covered in drying mud.
“Very much so,” said Mycroft, smiling back.
"Put pressure on it," he had ordered the hands that were pulling him, and then he had lost consciousness again.
he said fervently, gripping hard with his thigh. He fixed Mycroft with his dark, warm gaze. “Stop with me…Sleep the night with me.”
” She practically collapsed with laughter over the teapot and John could almost physically feel the cringing around the table emanating from both of the brothers. Seemingly, Lucia and Siger couldn’t, joining in with great enthusiasm. “Ahh, I’d forgotten that!” said Siger delightedly.
come and he had come for them both. So, forced into a corner, John had said that he forgave Sherlock. He had only said it then because he truly thought at that moment that this was it, and they were going to die together.
put the slightly tight-fitting waistcoat back on, though. Which was sexy. He looked extremely relaxed, sitting with his eyes closed in a bright patch of sun at the little table and chairs in the small but sheltered - and rather secluded - courtyard garden. From the pleasant fragrance wafting through from the kitchen, Greg could tell that that was a cup of the (truly amazing) Peruvian coffee that he was enjoying. It was one of Greg’s favourites too. When he opened his eyes at Greg’s approach, Greg grinned at him from the open back door, delighted, and held out a small paper carrier bag in one hand and, in the other, a crisp white bakery box. “Bonus fresh granary loaf, the last one…” he said, raising the carrier bag up high, “…annnd….!” he left the sentence unfinished, but held out the box at an angle to Mycroft so that he could see the contents through the cellophane window. The box contained three delicious-looking fat iced doughnuts - one soft pink, one pale purple and one baby blue. “They were on special!” Greg remarked, “ ‘Alf price!”
John caught sight of the book’s stark and very unromantic title. ’Fractal Geometry…’ he thought, ’well…your perfect coffee table reading material!’ If it wasn’t for the fact that he was at the Holmes’ residence, he’d have thought it had been pretentiously left there to impress visitors. In the companionable silence while the fire popped and then swiftly crackled into life, John watched surreptitiously as Sherlock rose gracefully to his feet, still holding the geometry book. He crossed the room to a large armchair, where he sat down and started flicking lazily through the book, reading a page then turning several pages at once, before stopping seemingly randomly to read another one.
the filthy part of Greg’s mind responded immediately, but he said quickly, “On the stage - I can see you as the most poised, immaculately dressed, straight faced and haughty stand-up comedian I’ve ever seen. Your cutting wit would slay them dead!”
“But you liked hearing me say it all, didn't you?" Sherlock said suddenly, terrifyingly very close to the truth. There were two quite different ways of understanding the meaning of the word
Their table was one of Mycroft’s favourites, tucked away from the main restaurant area and screened lightly on one side by more of the strikingly verdant green and leafy plants in tall black enamelled pots. Constantine’s was unusual in that some of its tablecloths were a vibrant white, and those tables bore glossy ceramic candlesticks and bright white candles to match, but some - like the one on this table - were instead a deep, soft cream; matched by elegant, carved wooden candleholders painted a deeper cream colour, and set off beautifully by the burnished gold candles that they contained.
‘How can this be so easy?’ thought John in wonder, this switch from herero-sexual-straight to the complete opposite? But then, as he stroked his hand up the hot, smooth skin of Sherlock's side and ribcage, up and across his chest to his neck, he thought, ‘but it wasn't a sudden switch, was it?’ He had had so long to think about it, so long to deny it and refuse to acknowledge it; it had been a slow, slow sea-change of thought where his doubts had lapped away at what he believed to be true, like the tide on the shore, and gradually and irresistibly, under the surface, had changed his entire belief system about himself. Only now, today,  had the water withdrawn for it to surface. There was conscious thought and there was decision making, and then there was this - Sherlock had simply turned to him with such a look in his eyes and John had not thought, 'Oh
There was a very short hallway next to the staircase which clearly lead to the downstairs loo - John could see another back door to the garden at the end of it. As Lucia started up the stairs - like she meant business, John thought - she called out slightly crossly to the unseen Siger, “Hurry up with Percy’s bowls!… And
and the actual
“Good afternoon, Agatha,” Mycroft said, smoothly, in a best behaviour purr, as she reached him and grasped his hand. “How
Then he noticed an actual real live (dead) stuffed grey squirrel, pushed to the back of the shelves behind another plastic molecule. The squirrel was sitting up on its hind paws on a rock and was slightly lumpy looking, and a little twee, its paws positioned to hold a wizened looking acorn. It had very shiny eyes and John didn’t like the way it was looking at him. He grimaced a little back at it. “An early interest in taxidermy?” John asked, perturbed, pointing over in its general direction. Sherlock glanced over at it and raised an eyebrow dismissively. “Oh,
Lucia was fiddling with a small blue plastic item that had clearly come out of her cracker.  “Now, boys,” she said smartly, without looking at them.
Anyone who follows cricket is likely to be massively impressed with my amazing cricket knowledge in this chapter.
and he would have to answer it. So he put his violin down, not particularly gently, and stamped down the stairs in a foul temper and yanked open the door—to
"I want to know. I don't think you would have, but I don't know and now I want to know."
Sherlock waited for her to come back to the topic at hand. After a moment, she remembered it, and became more solemn once again. “So, you’re not an artist, then. What is it you two want from me?” she said, clearly now unsure what their purpose was.
"Er, yeah," replied John, "I've seen his work before. He does a lot of birds, and snow. People sitting looking out of windows. And he's a writer as well."
Is that that really posh restaurant with the private bar place - the one we went to once with Greg’s friend what’s-his-name?”
"Oh, I do everything really well, John," replied Sherlock, in a harsh withering tone, and John wasn't quite sure what he meant, but he didn't feel he wanted to ask. "Let me get something for your cheek," he said instead, going for ice and a clean tea towel.
She didn't stop painting and after a long pause, she replied, "Quite busy doing this one now, if you don't mind."
The Dairy Milk bar, on the other hand, had come straight from the tiny corner shop at the end of the road.
John didn’t think he could trust himself right then with the amount of love he had for Sherlock. It was almost too much. Over all the years that John had been receiving them, no Valentine’s gift had ever meant more to him than this one.
The night outside was crisp and clear, and as Greg flung the curtain back, moonlight suddenly flooded in; a bright beam of it leapt across the bedroom, catching Greg in the centre of it - struggling to do up Mycroft’s expensive waistcoat on a cheap, plastic hanger.
Greg grabbed his shoulder gently but held him firmly. “Hey, hey! What’re you so angry about?” he asked, still grinning, trying to get Mycroft to face him. Mycroft did turn to face him then, and he glared at him in misplaced fury. “The
Where it would stay.
where he could press his body hard against his friend’s and do to Sherlock what Sherlock had just done to him. He pulled his mouth away from Sherlock's and told him so.
Siger paused in his chopping for a millisecond before John (who could have killed Sherlock for making Siger feel uncomfortable on his behalf for absolutely no good reason) glanced at Sherlock and said quickly, “Yeah, I do, I
but Sherlock knew that on the whole he was regarded by the rest of the cretins at Scotland Yard as being just as strange and unpredictable as some of their suspects.
But he had to
At John’s side, Sherlock muttered, “Of course you are…” making John nudge his ankle with his heel to shut him up.
Her viciously pointing finger lost all its power and she drew back, her righteous anger fading but her face contorting with speechless indignant venom.
He frowned.
“...So this is not a ploy to wind Mycroft up?…Or piss Greg off, because you know they’re gonna be—” He dropped his arms which he’d been waving about a bit. “—Wait, you’re so sure, why are you so sure, how the fuck do you
Sherlock obeyed instantly. And with great relish. He elongated the 'f' sound to draw the word out from its single syllable status, and drawled the last three letters into a low-sounding, rumbling growl with the harsh kick of the 'k' at the end. He pronounced the word like it was the name of a rare Anglo-Saxon delicacy, being placed with great ceremony on a feast table before a king.
John gaped at him, but only for a second.
"Ah, that'd be Guy's and St. Thomas' then, mate," replied the cabbie, oblivious, full of the joys of Spring.
“Much obliged, thanks, gents - have a nice evenin’!” the driver replied as Greg got out, stowing his fare and rather pleased with his generous tip. Mycroft made to follow Greg out from his side of the car onto the pavement while Greg held the door open for him, his left hand missing Gregory’s warm touch already. “Good evening, then,” Mycroft said pleasantly to the driver, as he stepped out onto the pavement, drunk on Gregory Lestrade and feeling quite unlike his usual reserved self. Of course the driver had no idea of any of this. “An’ you, guv!” he responded easily, checking his phone and re-setting the meter.
John blinked. “Wha
And as he wrote John's name, the thought,
“Ooh, lovely, Sigs,” said Agatha gratefully at the idea, taking a big slurp of her second glass of sherry and nearly finishing it in the process. “Hang on a tick though, let me just put my cases next door at Jilly's and I must do Zsa-Zsa and Sofia’s drops.”
Not if they knew what was good for them. But Gregory Lestrade didn't know about that and Mycroft found himself realising that Gregory being the sort of person he was, even if he did know, he wouldn't let that minor point bother him. How very
“Excuse me a moment, I’ll just go and find him!” she said to the room in general, in a jolly tone, and she slipped off to the study where she knew he would be holed up. Released by Agatha, Sherlock stepped back and leant against a worktop a safe distance away and shoved his hands into his pockets, but she wasn’t done yet.
He swept a hand through his hair distractedly. He read and re-read the note. It remained unchanged. Thick, expensive pale cream paper, lovely neat but elaborate handwriting, and what was written there was blunt but straight to the point.
at least - that he recognised what it was, and was gratified when Greg put his mug back down only half-drunk and confessed.
“We-ll, it's mainly because I owe the gallery owner a favour," replied Sherlock casually, "she has been incredibly helpful in the past. ‘The Case of the Octogenarian Art Fraudster,’ I think you named it on your blog - do you remember that one? And she happened to ask me very nicely."
Mycroft looked up into Greg’s chocolate-dark eyes and his heart leapt and spun. ‘I think I might be falling in L-word already,’ he thought in total and bemused surprise.
Sherlock, oh my
"—Scones out of the oven, yes, yes," said Gabriella, noisily doing it as she spoke. The smell was wonderful.
‘Oh. Well. Ok, then!’ thought John, pulling a surprised face to match his thought, and slightly puzzled at the turn of events. Sherlock seemed to have something on his mind all of a sudden. But what was new about that? So he just said cheerfully, “Ooh, yeah, tea, lovely,” put the sketch back carefully where it had been, and followed Sherlock back downstairs again.
that was
"How badly? Where?" asked John sharply, seeing no visible wound on Sherlock's front, and in answer to John's question, Sherlock turned around to show John his back, whilst still in the act of shedding the coat.
Siger, for his part in the performance, held up a small metal keychain decorated with a dangling pink rubber love-heart and pointed at it with his other hand. John burst out laughing at his silly pretend-excited expression.
Sherlock's brief, sweet kiss was like the casting of petrol onto John's fire, and at last the flames roared up and engulfed them both.
“I know,” replied John. “I’ve just got something I need to do. Back in about half an hour.”
It was a text from Mycroft. All it said was;
Yet. And John knew it wouldn't take him long.
Sherlock looked at him sharply. “Why do you want to be reminded of that awful boring woman? She ended the relationship with you, didn't she?”
laugh, but before Lucia could answer, Mycroft came into the kitchen from the garden, in a gust of freezing air and also in a scarf and his father’s borrowed Barbour jacket. He was clutching a large handful of rosemary and the kitchen scissors. John thought immediately that he looked as guilty as Sherlock had. He went straight to the sink to wash his hands and then rinse the rosemary.
. It was not as if he'd just
“You go first, it’s your fish,” John said, turning to Agatha. “…Give me your hand,” he instructed her, “…and hold it still, palm up.” Agatha obediently held her hand up as John had requested, and John placed the fish down flat onto the centre of it.
The table’s surface, where it could be seen, was marked and slightly gnarled, both with the natural uneven appearance of the aged wood - with all its knots and whorls - and from so many decades of use. “What a lovely table this is, as well,” John remarked, looking at the ornately carved flowers and leaves around its legs and feet. There was no tablecloth exactly, just a deep wine-red central table-runner with thick gold edging, and matching square fabric placemats in the same gold tone. Two large ornate brass candlestick holders at either end of the table held stout cream coloured candles. John smiled because he had seen Siger polishing the holders earlier and admired those too. Each of the six wineglasses bore strands of delicate variegated ivy leaves, twined around the stem just below the over-sized bowls and held in place with golden florist’s thread, to match the glasses’ golden rims. Small folded cream place-cards were positioned at the top of each placemat, all bearing intricate calligraphy lettering spelling out their names in dark grey ink.  They had obviously been done by hand, as had the thin (and slightly wobbly) gold rectangles bordering each place-card. It was like a table set from Country Living magazine.
Mischievously, Greg hooked his fingers into Mycroft’s belt loops at the side and drew him quickly forwards, while at the same time stepping backwards to sit down on the edge of his bed. He spread his knees as he went down, so that Mycroft could step in and stand just between his open thighs. As Greg sat down on the bed, he released the belt loops and slid his hands comfortingly down the sides of Mycroft’s thighs. So, he was now seated, directly in front of Mycroft, his face now much nearer to a significant part of Mycroft’s body. There was a poignant pause. Certain actions now seemed almost inevitable. Mycroft bit his lip nervously. “You…um…you don’t have to—” he started, but Greg interrupted him.
Mycroft smiled.
thought John, delighted, and he grinned back. He should have realised by now that sex with Sherlock was always going to be so much more than simply a physical act. He didn't think he’d ever had this intimate mental connection before, because - of course - how could he have done? There was only one Sherlock Holmes. And apparently, he was all John’s.
John laughed. “That’s not all you need,” he said, filthily. “Right, I’m going. Can you tell me what you're doing or is it something I'll find out about later?”
before abandoned himself so physically or emotionally to someone like this.
Mycroft smiled. ‘Not a single slim chance of that,’ he thought.
"Oh, well, I like the attention, John," Sherlock replied, deadpan, from the sitting room.
he whispered, weakly, not moving. John saw he was struggling to hold back.
Everyone at the table watched the contents of Agatha's palm with interest to see what the fish would do. After a few seconds, the sides of the fish began to curl gently. "Fickle!" proclaimed John, smiling.
But then Sherlock elaborated anyway. “I saw it when they were here for our Christmas drinks party. You were busy being a fantastic host - as always - and you didn’t realise, John, but they were talking together in the kitchen for
she exclaimed. “…Oh, I
simple in this place, and so you didn't ask
Greg made a rumbling sound of approval in his throat, like he had before in the kitchen.
snapped his inner voice, rudely - Greg looked back over at him, still lying warm in the bed.
This had been so long in the waiting, it actually seemed more than as if they were just two people finally acknowledging their feelings, or just two people reunited after a long enforced absence. It was so much more. As his body collided full length with Sherlock's in a fierce and violent embrace, John thought disbelievingly,
John stared dejectedly at the screen, chin resting on one hand, and with the other hand he drummed his fingers on the table. Then he leaned back in his chair and gave in and asked Sherlock, who was sitting silently reading at the table opposite him, "What did he say, you know, when you confronted him? At the end?"
“So you’re back on the fags as well, then?” he said, as Mycroft finally brought the cigarette to his lips and inhaled as he stepped out onto the balcony too; sweeping his other hand through his hair again as he did so, the strong harsh taste of the cigarette at once vile and yet so familiar, the wonderful head rush of the nicotine nothing short of heavenly. He closed his eyes. “Apparently so…” Mycroft admitted. “Well, at least for today…”
"I do," Sherlock chuckled. "Perhaps she'll be thrilled enough to let us have the pigs after all. Just until the wedding. The tribal people of Hawaii do a thing where they roast one over coals in the ground for hours-"
"Sometimes a... foreign hand helps... We could just try it. As an experiment. We won't ever have to speak of it again."
"You're an idiot," Sherlock said, pressing his lips to John's forehead for a long moment. He felt it wrinkle beneath them as the sharp shooter simultaneously frowned and tried to look up without moving his head. "Didn't you hear anything I said? You must have because you answered."
"Of course! Why would I kiss you otherwise?"
"It still will," came sleepy words deepened by being newly, and not fully awake.
"Really?
This one is kind of short I know. But the fluff! The angst! The more fluff!
"I'm enjoying it where it is at the moment," he smirked. Two could play at that game. Without another thought, John went through with gathering what he needed, avoiding looking, but feeling Sherlock watching so very intently. John made especially sure to look underneath things, with his arse, clothed only in thin cotton material, pointed directly at his lover. He had to get around him to reach the chair on which his jeans were laying, just happening to brush his hand over Sherlock's hip or crotch. John kept it up until, finally, Sherlock turned his head away and thrust the dressing gown at him. He didn't want to leave, just was apparently not having as easy a time as he thought he would, resisting John's form. John accused him of being embarrassed. Sherlock informed him, that at bedtime, he would show John in no uncertain terms how embarrassed he was. He would in fact be showing John for the whole of the day, as soon as he got his sexy little arse in gear. John had to pause then.
"Right..." They sat in silence for a few more long seconds before Sherlock spoke again, shifting between sitting up and laying down. "I'm not a virgin if that's what you're asking. And, no, it wasn't experimental. Well, not
Sherlock then cloistered himself in his room for a week whenever he was at home and not working on a case. During these times, he would only allow John to accompany him when he needed help with the experiment, which his partner diligently did, having no idea what it was actually for. John was actually good about that, contrary to popular belief. As long as no one was getting permanently harmed physically or emotionally, he was a sight more logical about experiment participation than Sherlock's other peers. John even began giving him an orgasm whenever his mind was racing too fast to think properly after the first time it worked, citing that it always helped him relax when his mind was going wonky.
Sherlock achingly pulled himself over him.  The pain was beginning to return now. "I only need you, John."
"Hm. I suppose it is," John said, leaning against the door frame in order to observe Sherlock as he did whenever he got the opportunity. "But that's not where I got it from. It's quite normal, as far as pet names go." Sherlock looked at him then, eyes uncertain. Or perhaps John was the one unable to decipher what they meant. The taller man got off of the bed, shed his jacket, and went to stare at his reflection in the full-length mirror, touching his face in various places as if trying to determine any porcine similarities. "Look, I'll stop calling you that if you like; well I'll try, anyway. But can't you just... logic your way out of being offended or something? I mean if you are offended, that is." John, who had kicked off his shoes as soon as he crossed the room's main threshold, went up behind him and wrapped his arms about his waist from behind. "You clearly aren't a pig. It's a wonder I can get anything into you sometimes." He lay his lips on Sherlock's shoulder as he looked over it, the heat of him clear through the shirt material and loving the seemingly unwitting little smile that broke out on Sherlock's face. Sherlock turned to his right and John came around so they could face each other for a proper kiss that got impossibly deeper when they caught each other peeking at themselves in the mirror. John moved him toward the bed and lay with him on it, touching his face and lightly tracing his beautiful lips with a thumb.
about this!"
"But-"
"Yes." John turned onto his right side and slipped down into the mounds of cloud-like covers, leaning his temple against the fist still containing Sherlock's dose as he gazed at his flatmate cum business partner cum best friend cum fake romantic partner. His profile as he concentrated was fascinating, the small constellation of moles on the side of his neck and jaw-line intriguing. His chest rising and falling, tremoring ever so slightly with the strong beat of his heart, the heart John swore had ceased not very long before that. That's what a man in love would be thinking anyway, his mind automatically supplied in these cases. So as not to be as forward as he wished and interrupt Sherlock's movements, John began slowly trailing the fingers of his empty left hand along Sherlock's arm, from wrist to bicep to shoulder, to those beauty marks. He didn't stop talking, only slowed, seemingly leaning in to the caresses and taking deeper, more relaxed breaths.
He disrobed quickly, not even bothering to hang up what he'd taken off and pulled on his own custom dark jeans, his body built somewhat narrower than John's, if not much leaner anymore. He had to have a collar to keep open at the throat, and so chose an expensive polo-style top of which he had several colours. He made sure to choose the forest green one to enhance the paleness of his skin and take full advantage of his heterochromia. It fit like a glove. He called further attention to the throat he caught many an interested person repeatedly glancing at by donning a round silver pendant impressed with a black stone hung from a leather thong. His shoes were just this side of combat boots, and he finished in the bathroom by capitalizing on yet another of his features many harped on. He took a bit of product, rubbing it on both hands, and artfully tousled his normally carefully tamed curls before washing his hands.
Sherlock then led John, still in the throes of port-orgasmic bliss, to lay on the rather luxurious rug that stretched the entire length of the floor in front of the bath and the nearby shower. Seemingly from nowhere, Sherlock pulled a small packet of lube which he tore open whilst further engaging John's mouth. Before the latter could protest about his refractory period not quite being what was(despite the fact that he was still semi-hard even now), or that he wasn't quite sure how ready he was for penetrative sex of the unknown homosexual variety, Sherlock begged once more, but for John to just kiss him, just hold him. He insisted John need do no more work with his hands other than holding on to him while he took care of himself fueled by passionate kisses and touches and declarations of devotion.
But John was currently close to weeping and Sherlock had no idea what to do about it. So he held him tightly, ignoring his own only slightly less powerful erection. Then they were frantically kissing again, Sherlock on top, John dipping sure fingers past the waist band of his pyjama bottoms enticingly in back. He knew he had very little control over his mind when he didn't realize how John's hands wandered, only that they were touching him and touching him was precisely what they should be doing all the time. Except he was pushed onto his back and John pressed his nudity to Sherlock's side and licked his neck as he stroked him furiously with a combination of organic lubricators. The only indication he was breathing was his uncontrollable moans of John's name and 'Yes' and 'So good. Oh God how is just this simple thing so good?' John had gotten his free hand up into Sherlock's hair to grip lightly and flicked his right nipple with his tongue. Then, dropping his mouth down over it, John continued the flicking in combination with a sucking very similar to how Sherlock had done it elsewhere. His hand gave a little twist at the top of Sherlock's shaft, then began going agonizingly slowly, massaging the completely exposed head with his thumb until Sherlock thought he would go mad, but nearly shouted with a sudden sharp release. John caressed him gently through it, letting him fiercely take his mouth with his once again and letting go of him just as he was about to become oversensitive.
"Obviously." John had a difficult time hiding his smirk when he was about to chastise her for being rude. "I'm sorry, Daddy, but it really is." Then Mycroft...
"I don't know why I even asked," he said fondly, so low it was nearly a whisper. "I know you. I know how you are. I know how you operate and what you need. The only thing I ever get confused about is what you
And wasn't this a beautiful development?
"Mm." Sherlock's utterance was not only an agreement, it was an acknowledgement of John's overwhelming wisdom. He let the hand that wasn't currently around John travel over his cotton-sheathed torso and wander toward the bare bits, John undulating under his touch in the most fascinating way. He would get to the scar in a moment. Contrary to popular belief, he could be patient when the situation called for it. How did anyone expect him to be able to conduct experiments without patience? Science was mostly waiting for something to happen when you introduced or removed one element from another. Sherlock had a burning question.
He was simultaneously excited and reluctant to get home, unsure of what he would find. But then, that was always the case, wasn't it?
"Hurt
"Mr, and Mrs. Holmes, I just-"
"Me, too," John replied, but Sherlock was already softly snoring.
"There were other ones?"
"What do you like? In bed I mean."
' look. At least he was honouring his promise not to fake his behaviour.
He'd assessed the vehicle when they'd first acquired it, was pretty sure of its strengths and weaknesses. So Sherlock wasn't going anywhere without a feat of strength that would most likely break bone. Even
The doors were locked so there was no need to pause his reassuring kisses all the way down to the bathroom and turning on the water. They continued their lengthy snog back out in the kitchen, despite their mouths aching, returning a few minutes later to discover that something had fallen into the rather massive tub, blocking the drain and filling it with water almost as hot as they could stand it. The only cooling being the distance between the shower head and the tub. Sherlock preferred a bath anyway and, minutes later, was relaxing back against John's chest. Some part of his mind was panicking at how comfortable this all was, how much he craved touching and being touched by this creature, how much he desired John's comfort and approval. He also wanted to shag him through every surface possible, no matter what it took. Even if it was...
"Oh I'm fine with using saliva," Sherlock explained, puffing and licking his sharply shaped lips, still staring intensely at what John was doing. "I would take you into my mouth, make sure you could slide fully down my throat. My gag reflex is directly correlated to my state of intoxication. At this point, it would probably be non-existent." John's hand was increasing in speed, but only a little, as he saw the potential for this to be over before it started properly. He never did want to be the one to come first during encounters of this nature, and purely out of habit, with a good dose of inebriation, he wasn't going to start now. He also saw that Sherlock was holding back a bit and decided to remedy that. No matter the situation, Sherlock always responded to questions that would allow him to demonstrate how clever he was, whether or not he found the queries unreasonably idiotic.
"Good to know some things haven't changed."
"I don't require saving."
"Another night safe," she said per route. It was a little bit heartbreaking, but their reality, nevertheless. John suddenly had a hazy yet exceedingly joyful memory of the point at which Willa climbed into bed with them, squirming her way into the middle and fitting perfectly.
crying in a shoddy room somewhere in the middle of nowhere, utterly alone, was to access voicemails John left on his old phone.
Within five minutes, Sherlock's neck and chest were riddled with marks in the shape of his mouth that would purple nicely in areas that people would be unsure whether or not it was his favourite(most fetching)button up or a love bite. Two fingers of John's left hand were buried deep inside his love's arse, finding his prostate unerringly whilst his right hand mercilessly stroked Sherlock's length until he was saying whatever came to mind. Lots of 'yes' and 'there' and 'please'. John took his sweet time. Enough time, in fact, to add a third finger and become completely hard again. He sunk into Sherlock's depths, always surprised at how tight he remained even after a good preparation. Comforted by the fact that there was absolutely no way this hurt even a little, John set a punishing pace right off the bat. He combined it with giving Sherlock's nipples a good tongue lashing with it until he started hearing swearing. After John got his left hand between them, he only had to give Sherlock's cock a few cursory strokes before the man with the largest vocabulary he'd ever encountered got to the word 'Fuck!'. John knew then that it was time.
"Say whatever it is you have to say, Sherlock. I need a wash-"
"I've enough room for the both of us I think," he said, frowning briefly into the distance as the phrase sounded like innuendo, but not quite. Sherlock turned to him, following his far off eyeline. Without thinking about it, his eyes had settled on Margie, who was asking a question of a taller woman in a striking deep blue dress.
With a forlorn sigh, he moved to the sofa. Sentiment was exhausting and he had a hard time believing it was all worth it. When he posed the question to himself, however, the resounding 'Yes' nearly deafened him as it echoed through the hallowed halls of his mind palace. But there wasn't yet a solution to his current problem on its heels and that frustrated him to no end as he continued to plumb his brain's structural depths.
The next week consisted of a combination of private snogging sessions beginning timidly and usually ending frustratingly abruptly. No one but them knew what they were talking about, thinking it another one of their strange inside jokes when Sherlock would ask something to the effect of 'How about now?' to which John would infuriatingly reply,
John was still, for all intents and purposes, a soldier. His hair may have grown out a bit, and his uniform may have morphed from fatigues to hideous jumpers and comfortably(nicely)fitting jeans, but he was doing the same job. Protecting. Serving the greater good as part of a group, getting into a bit of bother along the way, but he loved it really. Sherlock wanted, more than anything, to be able to provide him that moment's peace, as he'd already supplied him with a war, the one for the streets of London.
"That'll go on the list."
"Too many parameters. I needed to know a general average success rate to be able to calculate-" John turned to him then, his look stopping words as if he'd put a hand over Sherlock's mouth. But he was smiling slightly despite the unreadability of the rest of his expression.
"Too pretty for me?" It wasn't a serious question, though John had always actually thought so.
"Of course he does. A perfect nickname for Papa and Daddy's sweet treasure." He'd never heard Sherlock speak this way. Not even when he feigned affection. It was a certain quality of his tone. All at once, he fully understood where the term 'ring of truth' originated as well as the phrase, 'words have power'. If this was a smitten Sherlock Holmes, then John tore himself apart inwardly for not doing it sooner. He had little problem sacrificing his own happiness. If he'd been alone then this probably wouldn't have taken place. But he wasn't alone, and he had unwittingly sacrificed this-this pure joy and comfort-for the two people he loved most in the world. It was a physical pain in his chest. "W-would you like me to... to carry you?" Sherlock asked awkwardly.
"Alright..." John replied, his tone choc full of disbelief.
"Probably because Mycroft here didn't tell him we'd be coming," Greg answered angrily. "This is a situation for which you'd need to prepare emotionally, Mycroft. My God, you really are off. Then again, look who I'm dealing with. It's... really good to see you, John. We were worried sick and when we found out about the baby... Sherlock, I won't be the first to hug your boyfriend after all this." That snapped him out of it a bit.
"I'm sorry you're afraid to marry me." John grew extremely still for a moment then continued stroking the bird's head. "This isn't the proposal. I just... I admit that I've given you every reason to be. But please believe me when I say that fear of me is the last thing I want."
"No. I suppose not."
"Mm... positive." After an even lengthier kiss that nearly resulted in round two, John pulled back a bit to look into eyes he also couldn't get enough of.
"I don't need a sword, Sherlock."
"You can't resist me," Sherlock smirked. They got out of the back seat both using the doors this time and got back to their original places.
"You mean we didn't...?"
"I learned my lesson from that," he protested.
"I need you," he said. "Inside of me. God, John!" The way Sherlock said his name as he maneuvered the bedclothes out from under them, made it so John didn't realize they were quite suddenly naked. Sherlock had apparently been preparing himself the whole time, fervently kissing him as he was held close. John smeared a bit of the magically appearing lube onto his fingers in order to stroke his lover as he finished up, then was yanked onto him, pressing as much of their skin together as possible. His body made undulating motions, designed to keep them wet and on edge for hours, but knew John could only take a few minutes before he reached a dexterous hand down between them to guide John in.
"What?"
"You're really serious about this." It wasn't a question.
into me," Sherlock said, arching his hips into John's for indication purposes. It was just then that John noticed not only his erection, but,
"Children make life worth living," the child's father commented to John's unexpected chagrin. He wasn't positive whether he was predicting further ignorance or the statement hitting too close to home. He didn't suppose, at this point, there'd every be children of his in the future. "Don't suppose your parents hold out much hope for this, eh?" Mick Jones was really trying to be tolerant at the very least. He truly didn't understand attraction, however most didn't as much as they thought they did. John could find Sherlock attractive in every way and not be gay. Then again Sherlock tended to cross a lot of lines when it came to John's notions of himself. He was just that remarkable. The genuineness of Mick's misunderstanding was the only thing keeping his teeth in his head. Sherlock exchanged a look with him. It's almost as if he understood the conflict. Sherlock's Private Smile prompted John to speak first.
"How do you mean?" Damn his inquisitive mind sometimes. He wanted to enjoy what John was doing but had to engage.
It was ridiculous, the amount of energy he involuntarily spent on anticipating John's return. When it began taking longer than he thought it should he nearly started to panic. But John had reappeared, setting the DVDs down in front of Sherlock on the coffee table with the instructions to 'make himself useful', then had begun gathering supplies. There was a fan for the window, a few snacks including fruit, candies, crisps, and a pitcher of a drink called Arnold Palmer; iced tea and lemonade mixed together that Sherlock reluctantly found delicious. He busied himself with setting up the show, finding the latest episode he'd not yet seen.
"FOR FUCK'S SAKE PLEASE GO! I DON'T WANT TO... hurt you..." John was understandably startled, standing up and gazing at him with wide, shiny eyes, deep and full to the brim with... caring. Ugh.
"Hello, Margie," he said, accepting the continental dual cheek kiss greeting after the woman practically knocked the table over getting around it with what was a massive belly. "You didn't have to get up," he indicated by gesturing to her form.
"The password is 'Johnlock'" Sherlock saw the extreme puzzlement but, champion that he was, John had already donned his 'in charge' expression as an eye-level panel was slid open.
"Logic has hardly anything to do with feelings."
"What? Entertain me?"
The door-keeper was massive, as security for nightclubs tended to be, and he wasn't alone. The door was shut securely behind them so that they were trapped in a small, almost air tight foyer being groped by two other rather large guards, one male and one female. She clearly identified as a lesbian, according to her tattoos and tee-shirt, yet Sherlock watched in barely contained awe as she mechanically felt John's crotch for any hidden weapons and he only had to wink at her for her to break out in a seldom-used smile. So, bisexual then. Or John-sexual. He had an absurd urge to offer her an 'Amen' but controlled himself. Deemed fit to enter, another button was pushed. A voice over the intercom asked the password again and it was given by the woman. When the inner door opened, all of the sound, the screeching electronic highs as well as the belly busting baselines, combined with a seizure-inducing light show hit them, literally and figuratively, full in the face. The words 'Electric Sixxx' shouted at them in varicoloured neon, or from under a black light from every possible surface. John only arched an eyebrow at him. He returned it and they smirked at each other. Sherlock's heart skipped and he immediately willed it back to resting, always a little faster than usual when on a case.
everything all the time. Everything was the absolute truth to the user. To themselves, they
"A bit," he admitted. Sherlock couldn't explain how negatively that answer affected him, but he pressed on, because everything else wasn't going away. All of these other...
be wearing a kilt for the wedding."
"Yes. That's it exactly."
"Won't it?"
"John, Sherlock, and myself," Mycroft mused.
"I was going to bring her-"
"You had your reasons. I made peace with that long ago. You didn't leave me to leave me, you left to protect me from something."
Even though he was about to work his fingers around that long, pale throat and squeeze until he got a moment's peace from the aloof quiet his partner in every sense of the word exuded.  John would at least get the chance to think about a way to solve this.
"I'm fine!"
"Oh God. So good. So perfect," he moaned hotly, being clutched by Sherlock inside and out. "Are..." He had to take a moment to gather his thoughts before retrying the question. "Alright?"
"Ugh," John groaned, sucking his teeth, completely misinterpreting per the usual. "Good thing I'm for the shower anyway, before I have to entertain you." John was subtly engaging in military habit. Everything had a precise place and positioning within its space. His washing went in a hamper that was emptied once a week like clockwork. He sprayed some sort of sanitizer in the footwear he'd just used, admittedly a habit he began after becoming friends with Sherlock.
others he found himself standing in the heart of the flat, tempting to go reaching for his gun and putting himself out of his misery, as his heart ached for sherlock to return. to not be dead.
Tears of sadness, and loss, but also wet, hot anger. how could sherlock do this to him? how selfish could he possibly be, to abandon his life in such a manner?
after they wheeled him into bart’s, a pool of blood left where sherlock had landed, john had nowhere else to go but back to the flat. he sat alone for a while, in his chair. the flat looked so strange, peaceful, as though sherlock had never left. his violin resting against the mantle, the indent on the seat of his chair, a half finished cuppa on the table, the spy camera sherlock found in the bookcase still resting on the laptop. john imagined that if he left everything undisturbed, sherlock would come waltzing back in, coat swaying, returning from one of his bizarre missions.
“And you just happen to know what my fingerprints look like?”
That wasn’t how John remembered it. His pulse quickened thinking about the red sight lines on Sherlock. And the smell of gun and blood carried in the air. John remembered the wind swirling around them, and Sherlock’s voice within the noise, promising that Mary was safe now, he was safe now, and so was his child. John declaring Christ’s name in every way known to mankind. Surprise must have shown on John’s face because Sherlock added. “Mycroft didn’t tell you.”
“Yes.”
John’s eyes widened, and he blinked wildly. “What? Why?”
“You’re doing wonderfully, Sherlock,” John praised between biting his cheek, using the pain as a method to keep from coming. “Just a bit more if you’re up for it.”
He clicked the safety off as footfalls echoed nearby. He was prepared. His hand was steady; the gun felt right in his grip. It felt right having Sherlock by his side. Everything about the situation felt right, even the questionable danger that was heading their way. He breathed calmly, maintaining the composure of a soldier.
Even with an arsenal that promised stealth, efficiency, or a bloody mess, John still yearned for his Sig back at the flat. He knew its capabilities, its range, and the shape of it that fit comfortably in his hand. But he didn’t have his Sig. The 9mm Beretta, and one Smith &Wesson would have to do. He zipped up the remaining guns in the bag.
A/N: Hey everyone! I want to say thank you for all the comments thus far, and we are entering into the last chapters terrority if I have it my way. But the muse could have other plans. It's been amazing. I do have ideas for a sequel- do let me know if a sequel would be something of interest. I can't really say what the sequel would be about outright, but there's been some hints throughout the story. An awesome thank you to my beta whitehart, who does an amazing job as always!
He finished in five minutes, wrapping the gauze against the milky white skin. He continued to caress the bandage, knowing that he would have to pull away eventually. He knew that he should, but he needed this. Some small comfort to know that Sherlock was alive, that the baby wasn’t his today, and that the guilt that he felt over something that he couldn’t do anything to help: that his memories on the rooftop made him weak. He should have had his gun in his hand, ready to fire. Should’ve protected Sherlock, the baby. Should’ve done something more.
John took a hesitant step forward, his palms up in the air, placating submission to soothe the nameless man. “Alright, you don’t have to step down, but at least hand the baby over. It’s not good for the little one to be out here with just a blanket.”
He walked through the cream coloured lobby. His footsteps reverberated loudly on the wooden flooring. John walked past the front desk. It was eerily quiet, sending alarms off in John’s head that something wasn’t right. There should have been voices, noise, and music, anything of some sort to breath life into this place. It was as silent as death itself in a place that wasn’t supposed to be closed down for the night quite yet. It was far too early for that.
“Soap is not lube, and the shower is not the best place for penetrative sex. I don’t know about you, but I would rather not slip and fall then make a trip out to A & E for a busted testicle.” John scolded playfully, imagining both of them wet and wrapped in nothing but towels being lifted into an ambulance on a stretcher…
He knew that his child wasn’t the one who…
“Right or left pocket?” John asked lowly by Sherlock’s ear.
All they could hear was each other’s loud breathing. A surge of relief washed through John when Sherlock carded his fingers through his greying-blond hair. Slowly, he closed his eyes, letting himself relax.
“Do we even have eggs? Because the last carton…”
But now, it would be forever, a lifetime like this. He grabbed the front of Sherlock’s suit and pulled. Anchoring the taller detective downwards as he went on tiptoes, holding onto Sherlock’s shoulders.
Sherlock glared at him, insult twisting his face into a frown. “That’s the worst thing you’ve ever said to me.”
John’s eyes landed on the bed. Empty, except for the spread of medical supplies on the simple blue duvet.  John found Sherlock bunched in a chair, holding his knees to his chest, glowering at Mycroft, who occupied the other chair across the room.
John couldn’t help the flash of anger that overcame him. It was Mycroft’s fault, but seeing Greg, John couldn’t help it. He wondered just how much Greg knew. About Moriarty. About the third sibling. Hell, about him and Sherlock. Maybe, he knew about the blackmail. His anger aimed at Greg just because of his relationship or whatever it is with Mycroft. It wasn’t fair. None of it was. He couldn’t help but to wonder which side was his friend on. His or Mycroft’s? John opened his mouth to ask when Sherlock waltzed into the sitting room, relieving Greg from the papers. The questions would have to be later…along with everything else. Number four added to his mental list. John sighed and walked into the kitchen to get dishes for the three of them.
He maneuvered around Moran as the man charged. John kicked out Moran’s knee, and the man went down. John fixed his arm underneath Moran’s throat, and held it there. Until Moran stopped moving, and John removed his arm.
“What color is their apartment?”
The other line went dead. John pulled the mobile away from his ear, frowning at the contraption. He took a few steps into the lab, hoping the service bar would reconnect again. “Either Greg hung up on me or we lost service.”
“I swear if you are faking it, and you attack me again. I will bloody well shoot you.”
John knew what the other man was implying. It couldn’t be true. Not again. Sherlock was confident on the tarmac. Said that he was dead. John shook his head. “Sherlock said that Moriarty blew his brains out. I know that people could recover from injuries like that but-”
Either John’s words as a whole or the fact he had said ‘please’ made Sherlock flop backwards in surrender. One arm draped over his face. His hand waved in the air.
Moran spat on the ground. “You don’t get it, do you? I owe him. This life, killing people, not exactly what I signed on for when I asked him for a favour. I’m his until my debt is paid.”
Sherlock fixed him with a scowl before turning around. His low voice carried over his shoulder. “I’m not asking you to disrobe down to your pants, John. Unbutton your collar while you’re at it.”
John sighed and turned around to grab another wrap for Sherlock’s hands. He worked as he spoke.
-“I don’t know what you expect to see through a microscope without a slide.”
Live Nudes In Charcoal
Even though John was short, but he still had the compact body from his army days, mostly his arms. The rest could do with some toning. Sherlock’s body was made of angular lines, wrapped in smooth muscles, covered with a fine layer of hair. He stole a glance in the classroom, but this was spectacular, especially when Sherlock was as hard and ready as he was.
John cleared his throat and shifted in the seat. His gun dug into his lower back. “It wasn’t a difficult shot,” he murmured.
“Christ, we could be too late.”
Greg was frowning at him. Arms folded across his chest. “Is everything alright? You know with”-the detective inspector pointed up at the ceiling, and then he mouthed, “Sherlock on drugs again?”
“No,” John answered. His eyes flickered to the other light source in the room minus the strip of yellow coming from underneath the doorway. “You hacked into the professor’s computer?”
As soon as they were in a different alleyway, with the pub door closed behind them, John lost it. His back met the white bricks. Laughter spilled from his lips as tried to form a coherent sentence.
“Well, her death only proves that Moriarty is dangerous,” John stated neutrally.
“You’re also not Moriarty. The psychopath probably has back up plans for everything.”
There was no room for argument in John’s voice.
John shrugged his shoulders. “What have you found?”
Sherlock had his fake smile plastered on. John caught on that he was already in ‘actor mood’, and John was designated the role of the bad cop.
Lestrade shook his head. “None at all. The bloke had his fingertips burned off.”
John nodded his head over his shoulder, at the black plug on the bedside table. “Do you always run around with that in you?”
Chapter 17
“Dr. Watson.”
“So what you’re saying is, that Moran has been out there, the whole time?” John questioned, his eyes met Sherlock’s when the detective snapped to attention. “For as much as you boost about your connections, Mycroft, you really should check your employees. I’d recommend paying them more.”
“Thanks.”
John paused as Sherlock’s grey-blue eyes roamed over him, taking in whatever untold giveaways that were written on John’s face. “He wanted you to stay away from me romantically. Why?”
Now, for John’s next mission.
“You’re not above the law, Sherlock.”
“I think she’s full of shite. It seems the legend is always greater than the person. That’s all you have? ‘A friendly chat?’ Disappointing, really.”
There was also something in Mary’s tone that implied more, and John waited for more while carrying on visions of gunfire of the rescue. John shook his head. As much as he despised Mary at that moment, he was unable to voice out the ugly names he was calling her inside of his head.
John shook his head and held his arms out, waiting. His eyes were clamped shut to give Sherlock privacy as he heard rustling sounds from somewhere in the professor’s office. From the other side of the office door, he could hear student chatter. “That was a joke, you know. I didn’t expect you to actually go through with it.”
“Two partial fingerprints. One completely useless, and one full print.”
“Don’t count on it, Gavin, -” stated Sherlock, earning a sigh out of John, that Greg echoed from Sherlock’s other shoulder. -“I don’t think he was important. John, what do you make of the brunet man? There’s something remarkably unremarkable about him, wouldn’t you say?”
Potted plants hovered in the corners; squeezed in the middle of the foliage were plastic chairs lined in a row. Faint sunlight trickled though the large windows, clashing with the bright fluorescent lights overhead. Their footsteps echoed noisily through the quiet atmosphere. Sherlock stopped abruptly before one of the doors. Written in gold calligraphy over textured glass was ‘Office 129’, below which it was ‘Dean of Education’. A shadow darted across the other side of the window. John caught Sherlock’s sleeve before he could push open the dark wooden door.
He snorted and couldn’t help but to release a high-pitch giggle, which confused the detective before him, “You’re laughing…why are you laughing?”
John stepped forward, wedging himself in the distance between Sherlock and the criminal. Thinking that he could stop Sherlock from making another scathing deduction as a shield, regardless of the fact that Sherlock was taller than him, and could easily see over his head. Luckily, Lestrade seemed to think of the same. He took at the criminal’s side, and took over the interrogation.

“Sherlock. Let me help you, alright? And what did you mean you won’t need much preparation? I don’t want to hurt you just because you’re rushing to get penetra--”
“You know what I mean.”
“Sherlock’s phone. This is John.”
John didn’t stick around for long. He followed the distinctive coattails walking down the pavement. He jogged to catch up. When he joined Sherlock’s side, he murmured. “You know, Greg would have given us a ride to the Yard.”
He cursed aloud when he looked out the window while putting his wallet away.
What else could John say?
John snorted. “Don’t get cocky. I wasn’t flirting with you then.”
“And it’s yours-” Both men started at each other, fists still in defense when John heard a car from the next street. “May I go back to it or—?” John motioned to the cars.
John poured his own cup. “We were sleeping.”
Footsteps echoed through the room, joined with the telling click of an umbrella against outdated hospital floor. Mycroft’s voice came from farther away. John had rather hoped he was by the door. Or, headed there. He needed to talk to Sherlock without big brother watching.
“You’re right. I would just shoot to wound you.”
“Are you alright Mrs. Hudson? You’re not in any pain, are you?”
Sherlock bobbed his head back and forth, “Well…”
“So, you’ve felt…”
John stared at the floor beneath their feet, staring at a stain that was evidence of an experiment gone awry. He compared the differences between their wear of shoes, the colour, and even the size. As he let his mind drift, he started comparing the differences between them as two different people, amazed that their characters danced in sync with each other. It felt like an eternity, standing there, breathing the same air, and feeling the drum of Sherlock’s heartbeat.
“Victim is in the kitchen, at the table.”
John glanced over to his best friend, his flatmate, and the mad, insane detective who claimed to be a ‘high-functioning’ sociopath. For someone who says that he doesn’t care, he sure did ask that question a lot, especially to him. John wasn’t angry. He wasn’t in pain. If anything at all, he was thankful for the oblivious idiot standing next to him, waiting for the answer to appear on his face. He was happy. Happy that Sherlock was here, standing next to him, which made him waver in his decision of stepping over the line that he had mentally drawn. The ‘I don’t know.’ Closer? Or not? Feelings? Or platonic?
John sighed, slouching in discontentment. The tip of his toes brushed the floor as he shifted on the stool. He glanced over at Sherlock, who still had his eyes squinting intently into a computer screen whilst holding a fingerprint dusting brush, with gloves on.
He pushed away from the wall, and followed Sherlock further down the alleyway. Wordlessly, John took in the scene before them. Blending in with the red brick of the neighboring building was a streak of dark red stain. Then a pool of dark red hugged the wall. In the middle of the blood, sat a silver knife, and a large leaf.  “We found it.”
“Well, someone ought to let the cabbie out of the boot. I wouldn’t be surprised if he actually died seeing the way you totaled his cab.”
“If you’re not careful, I could orgasm just from that.” Sherlock whispered.
“Who were they?” John countered, pressing forward from the flesh and blood surprise and, nodded over the two people in the pool.
‘You can stop now. I have the schedules. – SH’
That after everything, he was still desired, even lusted after. One-night stands weren’t really his thing anymore, not since his military days; he was more a romantic at heart, which apparently echoed through his blog as Sherlock had complained before. Could he simply be with someone and not expect anything but satisfaction of a good shag? What about conversations over dinner? Or random talks in the middle of the night? Or even the stupid bickering about nothing? There was movement out of the corner of his eye, John turned, finding Sherlock had stood, adjusting his scarf.
Mrs. Hudson’s voice carried through the door, “Don’t mind me. I didn’t see anything.”
John half-smiled as he crossed the room to his patient, observing the injuries on Sherlock with every step. Two cuts on Sherlock’s face, one on the cheek, and the other cut on the brow. Knuckles on both pale hands were bloodied. Defensive wounds. It seemed like those were all of Sherlock’s injuries. Not bad at all. After all, they had been through worse--
“Go on.”
“You’re not always right, you know. You’re guessing.”
“Yes, John?”
John closed the nightstand drawer and stared silently at thin air  for a moment, debating internally about bringing up the magazines. He would skip over the part of that night, but stress the concept of his personal items and Sherlock should stay out of his things. John shook his head. It wouldn’t work. It has never worked. Ever. He called through the flat, “Your card wasn’t in there. Are you sure it’s not in your billfold? You know, supposed to be on you. I always tell you to keep your things together.”
He absolutely did not want to give up his only weapon, especially knowing where exactly he was going.
“You do.”
Years of high adrenaline experiences had taught John one thing – never underestimate your enemies. One should always be alert. He wouldn’t be surprised if someone jumped him at the entrance. After all, he had done the same for Sherlock when they tail criminals across the alleys of London. They always had each other, needed each other.
Kiss, Gift, Message
But Sherlock wasn’t there.
“No.”
John bit his tongue about the news while on their way to New Scotland Yard, instead he had listened to Sherlock, as the detective explained that there was no way to prove the ID-less jumper was indeed Oliver Izard’s killer, or even related to the other two victims. Sherlock was on a case, buried in The Work, the evolution of their ‘relationship’ could wait. It had to wait. John nodded here and there as Sherlock expounded that the dirt placed the jumper at the scene. It also didn’t help that the jumper was, in fact, at the scene while they were there. But blood, no murder weapon, not even latex gloves could actually conclude that the jumper killed Oliver Izard. The best chance to connect the jumper to the crime was the footage of the video cameras located inside, and around the block of flats. They have been cooped up in Greg’s office for at least one hour, if not more, watched through the first video from inside the upper class lobby. After deciding there was nothing suspicious throughout the footage, they moved on the footage for the outside the lobby.
“Get on the bed, John.”
If John was going to follow the direct line of his and Mycroft’s conversation, it wasn’t going to be pleasant. That was an understatement. Hell, telling Sherlock that everything he tore down for those two years were rebuilding, he didn’t know how the detective would react. He cleared his throat- and prepared his heart for the worse.
“That we are aware of. There could be more. Let’s ask him.”
Together, in perfect synchronization, they both bolted through the sea of green and blue tables, made a dash for behind the bar as a light flickered on. It barely illuminated the entire pub. Liquor bottles rattled when their backs hit against the bar. John grabbed his gun from his back, steadily waiting for the ambush.
AJ huffed at John, and ran a finger over the scarred face. He circled closer to Mrs. Hudson’s chair, earning a squeak from the older woman. Then AJ migrated in the space between John and Mrs. Hudson’s chairs. He smiled and hunched over as he spoke to John, flashing the gun fixed on his hip.
“Lestrade. Another crime scene.”
“This is one of the maddest things that you’ve ever done for a case, Sherlock,” stated John. His eyes were shut, making it difficult to rant on to Sherlock when he couldn’t see him. “Almost rates up with you stealing a double-decker.”
“Do hold still.” Sherlock whispered and moaned unashamedly as he repeatedly moved up and down on John.
“I was thinking,” Sherlock repeated lowly. “And it was hardly groping, John. Do refrain from being a drama queen.”
“Stop worrying. I’m really enjoying this.” Sherlock knew John was still worried about not personally preparing him, being a moan with the innate nature to care and protect. But just as he was saying that, he finally slid home, taking all of John in what felt like hours. Sherlock pecked on John’s face and nibbled on the doctor’s lips, only then did John open his eyes.
But he didn’t.
“Precisely. The killer altered weapons with Oliver Izard. Without accurate identification or the murder weapon, the serial killer could still be uninhibited or in the morgue. Lestrade, I require all available paperwork with this case to determine the answers demanded by John’s inquiring mind.”
It was almost having a living ghost. A very unwelcomed one at that.
The lip John rescued frowned at him. “I’m not nervous.”
“I know there are other ways to inject, Sherlock. I’m not going to ask you to tell me where. I trust you, but what made you…” John’s question trailed off. The flat fell quiet.
The kettle whistled; John fixed two cups of tea and then carried them out to the living room. He placed Sherlock’s teacup on the desk. John sat down in his red chair, grinning when Sherlock gingerly placed the violin down to immediately go after his cup.
“Return it back to the shop, like any logical person would.”
“Mrs. Hudson is everything alright in there? Do you need help with your bins again?”
“We moved on from that.”
John didn’t wait for Sherlock’s remark, instead he ventured into the living room. The hopeful look on Joseph’s face disappeared, and utter defeat wrote itself over his face.
John hung up. He stared at the mobile in his hand, remembering the other mobile that he had given Sherlock. Her mobile. John didn’t know what Sherlock did with it. John turned, folded his legs in order to study over Sherlock’s expression. There was a pleased, crooked grin fixed on his face, John followed the detective’s eyes to his mobile. John realised that Sherlock was entertained with him telling Mycroft to piss off.
“Crime scene, John.”
He stared at the closed door before turning back to Sherlock, glowering at him.
“Lost it!”

“We discussed this back at the flat when we were finished snogging, John,” sighed the detective dramatically. “It’s for the case!”
Story time ,Sassy, Rescue
“Oh? So you are planning on us ravaging each other in the future? ” John asked, eyebrows arching at the detective.
John gave the stockier man a small smile that was more pained than friendly.
But they were on a case, huddled in the back of a cab that reeked different traces of heavy perfume, cologne, and smoke. And as if it couldn’t get any worse, they were stuck in traffic.
“Are you seriously trying to give the big brother speech? Yeah, you can stop even before you start with that. What Sherlock and I decide on or do, it’s our business. Not yours, even with your cameras in the flat.”
Moran had been going for the boot earlier under the guise of letting the cabbie out. But choose to attack John instead. Thank god for that.
“No.”
Then another person followed through the open doorway. Him, John didn’t know or recognise, and he would have remembered someone with a vivid scar, such as the one on the man’s left cheek. The man leaned against the wall, arms folded across his chest. Apparently, he wasn’t running this show. John turned back to his ‘used-to-be wife’.
John bit his tongue to make the obvious cheesy remark about falling for Sherlock. Perhaps later, when Sherlock wasn’t on his knees in front of him. Instead he encouraged with, “That’s a lovely idea. Sod the cameras.”
The class fell silent as Sherlock entered into the classroom and stood on a small platform. John smirked lightly at the state of awe that washed over the students as the professor spoke with Sherlock. Then the robe slipped away. John swallowed, knowing that his face dropped, blushed, and his heart hammered. Everything about Sherlock was a long slender line, not soft flesh like a woman’s body, but muscular planes underneath the pale skin from chasing criminals that should be admired, felt, touched. John knew that he would look like this just from the barest of glances years ago when the sheet fell to reveal a powerful back. The chest had to be symmetrical, now he could say it was, minus the light pink scar. Hipbones that jutted outwards, startling sharp, framing lower thicker darkened curls. John turned his head away, his face burning.
“YOU WOULD’VE KNOWN IF YOU CHECKED YOUR MOBILE!”
He toweled off quickly as chilly air bit at his skin. There were too many questions again. And he was unwilling to find out because of fear, rejection, and lastly inexperience which made John huff with slight entertainment. He had experience with women. How different could Sherlock and his experience be? With that thought in mind, he grabbed his discarded clothes from the floor and opened the door.
The rest of John’s words were drowned out by Sherlock’s greeting to Molly, who hovered over a body on a slab. “I’ll need to sever the hands from the corpse that was brought in. Lestrade said there was no identification.”
Sherlock’s soft laughter carried in the air. “Eloquent observation, John.”
John coaxed his fingers over Sherlock’s scalp, earning a moan and a full-body shudder this time from Sherlock. Any noise they made, moans or heavy breathing, quickly blended with chatter on the other side of the door, fading into the background noises of the hospital.
“Let him in, Mrs. Hudson. Let’s see what he has to say.”
His remark either went unheard, or ignored as Sherlock descended down the stairs, two at a time, before disappearing altogether. John followed just as quickly and yanked the black door closed. Sherlock hailed a cab; John quickly trailed inside after him.
Only one word came out of Sherlock as the air flushed back into his lungs.
John shook his head. “We’re done here.”
“Really?”
“You did say it could be considered foreplay.”
John turned to Sherlock. “How’d you know that?”
“James Moriarty’s body was never recovered that day on Bart’s.”
John glared. “You were supposed to stay in the cab.”
“I didn’t mean all of your clothes,” John muttered exasperatedly, his fingers pinched the bridge of his nose, and he repeated. “People are going to see you naked.”
“Well, this should be interesting.”
“Do you do that often? Shoot at random things when you’re half-awake?”
“Heading out already? Let me walking you down,” offered John. “Been meaning to ask you something.”
“Or Mrs. Hageman, and the Izard poof.”
“I’ll take my usual, Angelo.”
He would die for Sherlock.
“Sherlock is fine as far as I know with all that. He’s fine as far as he knows. Had Mycroft mentioned anything to you about a third person? Or Moriarty?”
“You have a point, John.”
John grinned. “Right then. Off New Scotland Yard.”
And that reminded him of his daughter. He felt anger rising within him.
“I don’t have a gun,” John lied quickly and easily.
John answered the confused DI. “He came to the flat, with a case about his missing sister, Merry Mollet.”
“John. Oh, god. For fuck’s sake-” Sherlock groaned from the loss.
“Someday, I’m going to rip your least favourite shirt off of you. It would be satisfying to hear the buttons scatter around the flat.”
Sherlock replied as John walked by, going to the sitting room.
“And what’s that supposed to mean?”
“I know,” Sherlock remarked.
“I know Sherlock will step aside once Mrs. Watson and the baby are recovered safe and sound. Do you truly think that he knows, with utter certainty, the depth of your feelings once Mary returns?” Mycroft asked with a grimace. “Once your daughter is born?”
John snorted. Sherlock had point there. “Alright, well starting from when I was in the car. Mycroft gave me the ‘big brother’ speech.”
“I thought he was dead,” answered Greg as he hovered by the doorway. His eyes narrowed at John questioningly. “Right?”
Disclaimer: I don't own BBC Sherlock or any other variations.
Sherlock grinned at him. “Because it gave me time to pickpocket your mobile, so you don’t phone Lestrade right away.”
Venturing up to his room, John dressed quickly in his usual jumper and jeans combination. Sherlock was waiting for him at the base of the stairs with his coat. John avoided looking at the detective’s mouth, remembering the feel of that mouth against his. Instead, he nodded at Sherlock in thanks, not trusting his voice. The coat felt lopsided when he slipped it on. John plucked the familiar metal from the pocket, casting a look at Sherlock before tucking his gun away underneath his white cable jumper. He followed after Sherlock as the taller man went down the second staircase.
“What is it, Sherlock?” questioned Greg as the footage ventured backwards.
John cleared his throat, and stepped into the kitchen, placing the medical kit gently on the table. Sherlock’s face up jerked to watch him. His nimble fingers pulled at his shirt, fixing the buttons through the buttonholes in haste. John snorted.
Sherlock's end of the newly declared deal is here, John's red-hot embarrassment, and the writer's favorite chapter!
Neither moved to deny that they had an argument. John met Sherlock’s eyes as the laptop was snapped shut. John grinned when Sherlock fluffed his hair, and stood, straightening up his suit. He tucked his newspaper away. He would read it a different day. Instead, he grabbed the notebook used for their cases, if Sherlock decided that this case met his standards. John smiled at Mrs. Hudson.
“Traffic is fucking awful,” Moran complained, gesturing to the clusters of cars going nowhere fast on the road. “At this rate, I’m going to have to stop to pick up another pack. You wouldn’t mind, would you?”
“Not really, but I’m assuming you will tell me anyway.” Sherlock interrupted him for a moment before Ripper continued.
“What?”
Moran flopped face-first into the road. Hopefully, this way would last longer.
John smirked.
He forcibly stopped his fingers on Sherlock’s bandage with a sigh. “Are you tired?”
“While I was away, I miscalculated,” the detective answered quietly.
John still did not want to give up his weapon, no way in hell. “You wouldn’t kill me, not here and risk ruining his fun,” he argued.
“Have a seat, Mr. Holmes, and I’ll tell you more.”
Then he dropped down to his knees and pulled the trigger.
The other man didn’t recoil or make a sound. John unloaded and reloaded the gun right above Moran’s head, intentionally making it louder than it normally would. When Moran didn’t flinch, he knew the criminal was really out of it, and safetly tuck the gun.
John froze in his seat. The collar of his jacket scratched at the back of his neck. His voice came out steady as he asked, “You have a lead on Mary?”
John glanced over his shoulder, pondering if he should expect Moran to suddenly appear in the doorway. It was empty. John returned his eyes back to Sherlock. “Moriarty walked away that day at the pool, but on the roof, you said he blew his brains out. No one can walk away from that. Right now, you are remembering a ghost and nothing more.”
Even bracing for it, the impact knocked the breath out of him.
Floorboards creaked as he crossed the flat and into the kitchen. He stopped in front of the table, glancing down at the small mahogany box sitting among the clutter. John glanced back to Sherlock. His eyes were still closed. He still seemed so fragile. Looking back to the box, John opened it. Then froze.
“Never mind that. I must have switched something off in that big brain of yours.”
Murder, Gunshot, Broken
John nearly crashed into Sherlock when the consulting detective suddenly stopped. He glanced over the brick building. A faded blue awning hung crookedly over the dark wooden door, the word PUB barely seen even in the sunlight. The windows were dark. Quiet. John read over the business hours tacked on the door.
Mycroft’s heart swelled. “I would like that very much,” he said sincerely.
“Tea...?” said Sherlock eventually, in a conversational tone.
he called back in resignation. From the sound of Sherlock's voice, the letter would just have to wait. Sherlock sounded both pissed off and particularly demanding. John heard him coming up the stairs at a fairly urgent pace. As Sherlock opened the front door of the flat, John asked, "What's up?" without looking around.
though?” he interjected. “For you, this is an entirely new thing to be doing. Case on or no case on.”
again for? No, let me tell you about this amazing secluded beach I found by mistake one day instead...” and then he proceeded to relay an anecdote so full of humorous descriptions and the scenery and smells and sights of the island of Majorca, and so well away from the beaten tourist track, that Mycroft longed to go there more than he ever thought he would believe possible. “It sounds very beautiful,” he said, genuinely enchanted.
“Look and see for yourself,” Sherlock replied, smugly, still typing.
"There's so much to paint here...” Gabriella said, waving her hand over to indicate the soft beginnings of dusk on the horizon. “…Endless subjects and ever-changing scenes. That's why I love this place. You'd have thought I'd have wanted to get away from it after everything, but I don't. I really don't."
you to lie down with me…"
he thought, and put his glass down on the worktop, leaning back against it with both palms hooked over the edge. He gripped it slightly with both hands. “What I
to be there!’ ”
‘Christ in Heaven,’ thought Mycroft. ‘This man is a gift from God. I must have done something truly saintly to deserve him.’
it was not like him at all.
needed stitches. But what if Sherlock hadn't blocked the blade? What if it had gone in between the clavicle and first rib and pierced or even severed Sherlock’s subclavian artery? The only way to compress that vessel and even hope to repair it was to open up the chest…what if the stab wound had been  there instead and left Sherlock dead at the scene within minutes?
like this. In truth, he had simply never imagined it. But he suddenly knew he wanted Sherlock with an intensity so fierce it shocked him. He pulled back from Sherlock - to see his friend’s expression again clearly - hoping that he was right about everything and that Sherlock felt the same. He kept his hands where they were on the sides of Sherlock's face and looked at him seriously.
"Erm. Right." John didn't move either. “How, exactly?”
though he wasn’t sure about what. But Sherlock wasn't smiling or laughing, he just looked deadly serious, as if wanting John to realise something from what he’d just said.
“Coming then?” Sherlock said, raising an eyebrow and curling the corner of his mouth.
In a flamboyant but neat and almost copperplate script, she had written,
Mycroft swallowed. “I still—I still
Sherlock took the last sip from his cup. John was deliberating whether it would be rude to take the last half of scone and he almost reached out for it, but then decided not to.
How lovely to see you! How was your journey? I bet you're totally shattered after that awful delay, aren't you, my dear?” There was a lot of embracing going on and then there was a louder clattering and crashing of luggage and a clinking of many bottles in either a plastic bag or a cardboard carrying box being put down on the table. Siger must have offered some tea under all the noise, because Agatha said loudly in mock horror, "Tea?
to you?"
“Gab?" asked John, as suddenly something new clicked into place. “Wait - does he sometimes call himself ‘Gab’, professionally?”
“This?” he said, sliding it under some paperwork none-too-discretely, “Ahhh…Just…dealing with it. It’s a…w—er...witness statement.”
Greg had swallowed his toast and could speak clearly again. “Oh, don’t worry, I won’t call you either of ‘em in public!” Greg sipped some tea and grinned at him over the top of the mug. “I just like nicknames…” he explained. “They’re fun.”
He took up a sheet of private writing paper from his top drawer and his favourite pen, thought for just a moment and then started to write.
“Erm…I’ve actually got you something else, too,” he added. “Kind of a joint present, really. We’re going to see Itzhak Perlman play when he comes to London in June. I got us tickets last night.”
“Yes. So..”
of course, sorry. Not ‘Mykie’ anymore.….okay! Well - is there a young man, then?”
amiss here.
"—Mmm, of course you do," interrupted John, looking at him suspiciously.
In response, Sherlock made another minimal shake of the head. John saw that Sherlock was using his arm on that side almost normally. Which was good. And he was breathing normally, which was even more important. Sherlock discretely dropped his pretend gun in his other pocket before the police arrived. "Pressure," said John, discretely, with a tip of his head indicate that he meant Sherlock needed to put pressure on his wound. And then the car park was filled with the beautiful music of a police siren and the very welcome bathing of blue lights, and John and Sherlock were able to deliver the two injured thugs, along with their charming array of weapons, to Lestrade and Donovan, and get on with the really important stuff. Away from the police, out of sight of the two criminals, John grabbed Sherlock's good arm and turned him around carefully. "A stab wound, Sherlock? How bad is it really?" he asked, pushing the lapel of Sherlock's coat to the side to see.
‘This is…
Sherlock rose up, fast, lifting his upper body from the sofa and with both hands he grasped John's side and his shoulder and brought him down, like the predator that John had visualised earlier. But John was no easy, witless prey. He went down willingly, with a fierce response of his own. They fell on each other again and kissed like the world was ending.
had the money to gamble—“ she pulled her bun tight and sat up straighter. “—Anyway, and so he gambled it all away and then he began to borrow.”
Ok, then. Q & A.
Meanwhile, Agatha was making short work of her gin and tonic, John noticed. Remembering earlier conversations, John nudged Sherlock’s arm to point out Agatha tossing back her drink and said to Sherlock in an undertone, “ I thought you and Mycroft said something about not giving Agatha gin because of last year?”
he ordered.
Greg grinned and squeezed with his leg. “Ahhh, y’know!…Just a squirt of Chanel no.5….” and then he snorted laughter at his own joke. Mycroft, luckily - not being Sherlock - got the Marilyn Monroe reference immediately, and spluttered with laughter. “I
He gave a mock shiver of fear at the thought of it, the comical boyishness of the gesture making Mycroft’s heart leap unexpectedly. “Oh, well, come on,” Greg continued, turning to go up his garden path, “let’s go in…I’ve promised you cheap scotch, ‘aven’t I?!” He led the way up the path, getting his keys out from his jacket pocket as he went and not letting go of Mycroft’s hand as he dug around for them. Mycroft was still slightly surprised by the comedian comment, almost dazed, even -
- in most ordinary people’s opinions, at least - this was Sherlock they were talking about, and she had clearly long accepted as ‘normal’
“I shall have him for this…” he declared fiercely, his voice icy cold and furious. “I can’t

he said, almost giggling.
“…You
“Er...er, yes. Guest bedroom, yes…” said Sherlock vaguely. He looked at John. Then he swirled into action, almost appearing to shake his head briskly to clear it. His eyes flicked to John's face. “Want to see my room?” he asked mischievously.
John looked at Sherlock, who had closed his eyes again soon after speaking, and now sat leant back against the seat, still tightly wrapped in his coat and with his scarf and gloves in a loose heap on his lap. John just looked at him, thinking all sorts of things. Maybe he did know after all, what it was Sherlock was referring to. He and Sherlock had known each other a while now and he was just starting to make some deductions of his own.
John was incredulous about the Stilton-theft. “Did he actually
Agatha was overjoyed. “Oh, he ate it alright! And as many cheese biscuits as he could reach!” She guffawed delightedly, sipping her sherry. John flicked a glance at Mycroft just in time to catch him smiling at the memory, before he realised John was looking at him and immediately controlled himself.
since he had held another man’s hand…let alone kissed him wildly and repeatedly against his kitchen sink and then followed him upstairs to his bedroom…well, he considered truthfully, the sink moment had been a first, in fact…but
John clenched his fists tighter, folded his lips together and lifted his chin defiantly. So, they had gone full circle and here they were, right back at the beginning again, in the same place. But unlike that awkward conversation at Angelo's, after this, nothing was ever going to be the same again. Their friendship was going to be over in a final embarrassing mess of rejection and denial and he was just waiting for Sherlock to say the words and then he would leave. Leave him with the mess this time.
used to steal cheese and biscuits!” Without saying a word, Sherlock left the room at that point and went to dig about in the pantry - just to get away, John suspected. Meanwhile, Agatha was continuing her story. “Once, he had crept into the room when no one was looking, and just this little hand reached up over the edge of the table and grabbed a tiny handful of Stilton from the cheeseboard! He was only about three!”
it was her who rescued him from the depths of his own mind, and spent countless hours as his shoulder to cry on. he owed her at least a ring. and now a baby.

not that john is in any way angry that sherlock is the way he is.
"normal people don't run around chasing after criminals and psychopaths with their best friend who happens to be a sociopath. normal people find spouses, have children, work the 9 to 5."
and then there’s john; not exactly his polar opposite but definitely a contrast.  john believes he and sherlock compliment one another to the extent that it makes them, together, tolerable.
"have you written up the dog one yet?" sherlock inquired, undisrupted from his work. john gave a small chuckle.
john had become very accustomed to things being ripped away from him; the temporary loss of use of his leg after the war, every single failed relationship he had whilst living at 221b, he digresses. but he thought all of that was behind him. only smooth sailing ahead. but after witnessing that, the smack of sherlock’s body on the pavement, the sickening snap of his neck, seeing the blood drip down his face as john frantically reached for his wrist, desperate for a pulse.
john never once slipped, never let his affections truly show in the way he wished to express them. rather than wake him up with a kiss on the forehead and a steaming cuppa, he glimpsed up from the morning paper to briefly remind sherlock that mrs. hudson had left breakfast on the table. it was enough. it had to be enough. he understood sherlock could not return his feelings. he knew the man he was, and sociopath or not; sherlock was incapable of romantic love. it was not an insult, nor a fault; simply a fact john knew.
he could finally think of sherlock's beautiful, pale body and his long slim fingers padded with callouses from relentless violin playing and remember that man was not rotting in a box six feet under. he is alive. for now, john thinks.
he hated himself. he couldn’t function, couldn’t even go to the shops without breaking down into a mess. he would sit on the edge of his bed, his mind wavering, and his hand reaching for his gun drawer. open. close. open. close. open. his entire body trembled and numbed as he reached for the gun, swallowing a cry and he felt it’s cold, metal handle.
at the time it didn't seem that that was what mattered, but it completely and utterly did.
the new warmth john found between himself and sherlock gave him a feeling of hope he had been lacking for far too long. the war stole away all hope he had before, and his failed attempts that dating and reintroducing himself back into society as the man he was before only reinforced johns feeling of utter hopelessness. but then there was sherlock holmes. proud, cocky, and indestructible.
it hurts to think about the months after the fall. he still feels a twinge of anger towards sherlock whenever he remembers the days and weeks following sherlock's 'suicide'. the empty chair, the stack of papers still pinned to the mantle with a dagger, the skull slowly growing thick with dust as the 221b flat is neglected by a grieving and broken john. each day reserved for a different emotion.
looking back on it, it seems as though john had no other choice except for marrying her. do what normal people do.
and john is eternally grateful for it.
“john.” john gave no reply, only staring stony-faced at sherlock’s empty chair. he rested his cheek on his hand.
all john ever wanted was to be loved back by the person he admired most. after the fall, he had no one to hold on to. he was so alone, and felt just like he did before he met sherlock, subtracting the huge hole in his heart.
watching his best friend die is, to this day, the most painful thing john has ever had to endure. it tops the war, and though he would never admit it, even mary dying was easier to overcome than the loss of sherlock holmes.
when john would lie awake at night, mary sleeping my his side, he had to stop himself from crying because sherlock came back.
after the fall, john didn’t think he could go on. and then it all changed.
he used to spend his time thinking about what life would be like if sherlock had been normal, and come back into johns life calmly and quietly. of course, he knows sherlock could never carry out a silent return; he is far too much of a drama queen.
the rest left one after the other, both giving john a sympathetic look. john stayed, standing in front of the shiny black stone, wanting to protect it, just like he did for sherlock on their first case together and he had since. but then he failed.
“i’m fine.” john interrupted, still staring at nothing. lestrade drew a breath, then sighed, knowing nothing he could say would make the situation better. He gave john a reassuring pat on the shoulder, and left, closing the door behind him.
in that moment, john cursed the world. cursed sherlock for doing this to himself, to john. cursed those bystanders and first responders for not letting john save sherlock. he just wanted to save him.
so he sat, and waited for sherlock to come back.
john knows that sherlock packs the capacity of understand the emotions of normal people, but he cannot wrap his brain around why sherlock would ever think it would be a good idea to come back from the dead after two years by disguising himself as a waiter while john was on a date.
"yes sherlock?" john's gaze shifted from his laptop to the kitchen, where sherlock was busy at being sherlock.
"he might even be could be professing his love for me and i wouldn't even know it."
with all of the buzz around sherlock’s fraud, john knew there would be that one arsehole who would deface the grave. john had failed before, and wanted to stay and protect, but he knew that no matter what he did, sherlock would not be coming back. so he left, only returning once more with mrs hudson so she could pay her respects and so john could say goodbye one last time.
“let me through, i’m a doctor. please, he’s my friend”
he has no other choice.
dragged around, sometimes literally, john secretly enjoyed sherlock taking him on cases, just as so sherlock enjoyed little john trying to unravel every seemingly and increasingly impossible case the pair encountered. after all, where would he be without his blogger. john's incessant documenting of their many adventures brought sherlock a great sense of satisfaction. the baker street duo were perfectly, though quietly, content with one another. however, all great things must come to an end.
"You're one to talk about crass behaviour," John mentioned, lowering his mostly empty bag in its place by the wardrobe and gathering fresh pants, a towel, and his familiar blue dressing gown with the lighter vertical stripes. he was paying attention to his words, now, censoring himself. Sherlock didn't much care for that.
"Watson, Hamish J., Sixty-sixth Berkshire Regiment of Foot, Captain... Sherlock! How...?" He spun with wide eyes to one of the most intense looks he'd ever seen on Sherlock's face.
"I don't want you to feel uncomfortable."
Title(and the name of the bar based on the band of the same name-only 1 'x' though). They are a delight and sing:
"I bet you could charge admission for that," Joked Marceline after Margie repeated the quip to answer her question as to what was so funny. John elbowed his partner as a reminder and Sherlock murmured something in French to her.
"With the candle stick?"
"I then moved on to seduction techniques. I've deleted most of them, but I was able to get almost anyone I wished into bed after a rather late stage puberty."
"Yes! I told you I've tried everything."
"Well of course you were," she said. Of course he was. Probably. "That's practically down the road from us," Margie continued. It was a bit titillating and very slightly disappointing to think, though a few years his junior, he may have come across a young Sherlock Holmes much sooner in life. Maybe even right around the time of that Carl Powers boy. The most trouble he ever got into was defending someone who was getting picked on by beating the bully into the ground, and even that went away since he was very careful to drag the boy just off campus in order to carry out justice. The trust fund wanker's father tried everything to intimidate the school into expelling him, but John had endeared himself to nearly everyone, staff and student alike and got off with a warning. The warning was to take him farther away so no one's time would be wasted again, and punctuated with a secret wink from the head teacher at which he refused to smile outwardly, though his insides were. The boy ended up going to Harrow the next term, and suddenly, if Sherlock was anywhere around at the time, John was sorry to have thrown another potential Sebastian Wilkes into his path. The man had enough trouble as an adult, so it was difficult to imagine the navigation of all of that brain power plus the hormonal tsunami that was the teen years. John may have taken up drugs too, in that situation.
, wept for
"Far be it from me to criticise you making sure you have your facts straight." John giggled nervously and he was suddenly a young teen-aged boy again, disappointing his school mates. They would usually complain and say it was because he was small for his age, so it looked bigger than it actually was. But that never explained how it was longer and wider than any of theirs. The proportionary explanation was off by a mile. Well, several millimeters, at the least.
"I don't like surprises. Are you planning a surprise party? What for?"
"What... erm..." John's gaze went past the table top to the worktop by their sink as Sherlock stood expectantly at his left elbow. He cleared his throat, then started again. "What was the plan?"
The entrance was literally underground, an unassuming metal door leading into the bowels of an unassuming building which housed a fancy restaurant, a large office, and several expensive flats.
"It is a bit."
"Okay what purpose did I serve? Before Willa, I mean?" Sherlock sighed deeply. Emotions exhausted him. "I married and had a child on the way because I thought that's what normal people did. Mary was actually the one that helped me get to this point. She helped me see a lot of things about you and about myself that I just couldn't, because, when I began a relationship with her, I was walking around with my eyes half shut most of the time, just... going through the motions of a normal life. She made me see that we have to make our own normal in order to be happy, in order to be a whole person."
"I hope so," was all John said, and they quietly held each other until his backside began numbing even in the plush rug that had been under the bed to save the wood floors. Also,
"What?"
"I'm sorry, what?" He opened his eyes at John's question and the cessation of his head rub.
Then they were both topless, chest to chest, deeply into each other's mouths, their legs slotted comfortably. The way John clutched at him and rocked his hips slightly down into his all but drove Sherlock over the edge already. He had to begin his descent in order to keep it together for long enough to get John off at least once. He was so glad he shaved that day for seemingly no reason. Sherlock had read something about unpleasantness akin to rug burn back in that time and place.
"Do friends not flatshare and go into business together?" John crossed his arms and pursed and unpursed his lips a couple of times before lightly clearing his throat.
"There are two."
So John enjoyed learning of this a bit more than some other things. The sound had come up earlier when he kissed him before leaving their room and the thought first gave him pleasure then gave him pause, though he wasn't yet sure why. Finishing up the volley, he stared at Sherlock's face, unable to decide whether or not to look into his eyes or at his pinked mouth.
I was ordered to write this. It worked out, kinda.
"If you just let me-" It was worse that John was speaking to him gently rather than shouting, as if talking to a child. In truth, that's what he felt like. He'd been helpless around him before, but, even on that Summer day, it wasn't as utterly desperate as it was now. John wouldn't even look at him anymore, pretending to find the wall, the floor, anything more interesting.
"No."
"It was always going to. I'd already known your size before I asked for a piece of the platinum."
"Just a plan to tell me you... How you feel."
"He said that he would agree to marry me immediately, if I found a way to adequately demonstrate my... feelings... for him."
"Maybe 'Jovan' or even 'Ivan'."
"You don't usually ask stupid questions, Sherlock," he said. Sherlock nodded once, then stepped deftly past him, entering the house and expecting them all to know to follow, which of course they did. It's what he did. Lead. Mycroft had, at some point, told Willa to go back into the bedroom and wait, so as not to overwhelm her already fragile father. Everyone just sort of stood around for a bit, looking at each other in silent tension. It was killing him. So John did the only thing he could think of to break the ice. Small talk. "You lot look really well."
"What's wrong?" He halted then spun to face John with what was at first that familiar assessing look.
"Thirteen-no-fifteen. My parents decided to double up a couple of times to see if that would work. It didn't." While they had a brief laugh over that, John suspected that he didn't delete the number because the bugger was proud of it. "Apparently during this boring conversation, she suddenly had the urge to re-live old times. She mussed my hair and picked up my arm to inform me of how skinny it was before tickling me beneath it. I nearly broke my ankle, fleeing to the gents. Hard to run with an erection." Didn't John know it. The normalcy of it all was still fascinating. "I actually did break my foot when I was fourteen-an unfortunate ending to an experiment with Mycroft's umbrella, don't ask-," Sherlock continued as if relieving himself of some life-long burden. It further proved John's theory of how much he'd needed a real friend besides Mycroft and uselessly wished he'd first met him back then. "I'd had to have a cane as I couldn't endure the constant stimulation proper crutches gave me."
At first he had a hard time speaking. John had on a deep green apron across which frolicked several reindeer with fairy lights decorating their antlers. One of them had a bright red nose. It was insipid. What was not nearly as preposterous was, the rather sinewy forearms extending from the rolled sleeves of his blue gingham button up, though Sherlock's physical reaction to that little bit of skin and the fact that he'd shed his jumper probably was. Especially since it was so warm in the close quarters of Mrs. Hudson's kitchen, that he'd undone his top two buttons in the same way Sherlock wore his shirts, only the crew neck of the white vest he had layered underneath poked out where Sherlock only had skin. It reminded him of the ice lolly near disaster so much that he had to swallow hard and console himself with the fact that John was also wearing a pair of warm yet ridiculous looking black socks that had rubbery bits on the soles for traction. John clutched a bowl and was mixing it with fervor using a long-handled wooden spoon, bits of whatever was going on smeared on his apron.
"But you don't... you're not hurt now?"
"Then why do you look... horrified?"
"It's a brolly, dog tags, and, um, an anno... an... ana-tomic-ally correct human heart."
"Yes, the Earth revolves around the sun, I
They stepped out only when the water grew frigid, drying each other off slowly despite the goosebumps and other hardened skin. They then each donned their old dressing gowns, as the others were still packed and downstairs, and when John went into the bedroom, Sherlock went into the kitchen, returning moments later with two steaming mugs of tea, just the way John took his. Upon smelling his, John noticed an extra element, the pungent odor of whiskey prevailed and John grinned, only taking two long sips before setting it aside and pushing down further beneath the sheet and duvet. Sherlock copied his actions and there, under the covers, it fully began.
"Yes yes you all...
"Shut my eyes and thought of England." Sherlock scoffed at that and removed his arm from around John so he could cross them with proper petulance. "Come on, love. Don't be like that." The affection in his voice (Sherlock outright
to check his watch. John wanted to shout some more at him for that, wanted to berate him for making this into a science experiment or whatever he was doing at the moment, but all he could get out was a sputtered, "F-Ffuck you, Sherlock."
"When can we see them?" Sherlock was even more eager than John ever thought he would be at the thought of children once they became a reality.
"I honestly get the biggest thrill out of seeing you lose it a bit." John chuckled and kissed the moles on the side of his neck.
"I... didn't try... that."
"So are you."
"That is so."
"What?"
Then John really took charge.
"Funny," John pondered, glad that their words were clearing a bit. "I always wanted to be a doctor and a soldier." Sherlock paused to search his countenance on his way back to his now established spot.
"This purposely swearing Sherlock is more than a little bit sexy," John grinned, finally deciding not to worry about leaving his shirt and jeans buttons undone as he tore into the packing tape with a wickedly sharp pocket knife.
"Because," John's voice strained with his lithe, mostly naked body (his dressing gown made it off but not his shirt), "they'll think of you as a lost puppy full of angst and want to save you."
"Touché , John," Sherlock said, having engaged the defogger and punched their destination into the newly discovered Sat Nav. "Touché, my love."
"I wasn't insulting her, I was trying to help. I mean her style is all over the place."
He was was pretty sure he'd said that out loud, but then everything was a jumble. Until he heard John announcing he was close to reaching his peak. It was crystal clear and acted as a cattle prod, his entire form leaping into action involuntarily. He rhythmically squeezed his inner muscles, and met John's thrusts even more vehemently. John was calling him clever and beautiful and perfect, peppering his compliments with exuberant swearing until he clamped his mouth down at the base of Sherlock's neck on the side and pounded into him as if his life depended on it. The third orgasm had taken much more time and was probably dry, but John was inside of him at the time and it didn't really matter. John kissed him languidly until he stopped twitching, Sherlock again using his muscles to wring every last bit from him.  John continued to give him sweet pecks as he undid the restraints and finally,
But the speech, the homage to John's last blog entry after Sherlock left served to bring tears to everyone's eyes and almost completely calm Margie. So much so, that Sian slid slowly out onto an extra thick pile of towels John held beneath her with minimal grunted effort. Mick's wife Sandra had donated a sterile packaged mucus removal bulb from a baby bag that John used on Sian while holding her in his arms face down. He then gently massaged her back and, gurgled at first, then clear and piercing, Sian announced her safe, but annoyed arrival.
it is utterly incomprehensible to him and he if left with no voice but to believe that sherlock was totally out of his mind when he did so.
--------
he realized that he wil forever have everything be ripped from him.
sherlock has returned, and john does not know what is left to do but live out his normal life as not a soldier, blogger, or sidekick to the famous sherlock holmes, but as a doctor working in a surgery and living with his wife and soon, his daughter.
how quickly sherlock’s eyes flick back and forth when reading, his quiet calmness that brings down the tension of any situation, the way his brow furrows when concentrating on a book or microscope slide.
“please, sherlock. please.”
"Beauty and the Beast". this was the story that seemed to smuggle itself into john's mind whenever sherlock, either sitting at what used to be the kitchen bench using his microscope or lying on the sofa with his eyes closed, the marvelous brain of his working at incredible speed, thoughts going out as quickly as they entered.
before the fall, before any wives or children or secret sisters, john was almost totally happy for one of the first times in his life. almost. there was always that nagging thought that would remind john of his eternal reality every day: sherlock will never feel the way a real person does. john grew to be content with that fact, to live with it. you can’t change the truth.
i'll post another eventually
the ceremony was extremely brief, and no one even spoke until lestrade left, mumbling a “good man” as he touched the gravestone gently, before turning and departing.
