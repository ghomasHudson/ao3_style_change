“But I – and the root – you were distracted from your fight.”
The sheer impossibility of John knowing which remedy would be needed made Sherlock feel almost light-headed as he saw his brother nod reassuringly to the unsure Physician and heard her relieved announcement shortly after – the Princess’s heartbeat had gone back to normal and her skin wasn’t as pale anymore. This shock, this second where he couldn’t help but wonder if John had had anything to do with Moriarty’s intrigue – the thought feeling very much like someone had firmly seized his heart so as to viciously squeeze it – meant he understood an instant too late what was at stake. Already Lord Astair was reaching to the man he had earlier ignored in order to thank him for saving his niece’s life, and already Mycroft was overruling John’s dazed protests.
John smiled down in victory and happiness.  He had exactly what he wanted.  Sherlock had relinquished all control and John had proved that he could drive him to the very edge.  He’d got into that amazing brain and shut down everything but the very basic bodily functions.  All Sherlock wanted was release and John was more than happy to give it to him.
“We still have that as a fall back in case you need it.”  They both laughed.
John looked stunned at the sight of the stick, putting pressure on his leg under the table and realising that Sherlock was right.  There was no pain at all.
"You hadn't had your lip bitten or you hadn't kissed at all?"
"That's not what people usually say."
Sherlock used his lock-picks to open the door and they crept in to the kitchen.  They could hear the noise from a TV in the front room so they edged along the wall, John drawing his gun and pushing Sherlock behind him, being more used to these incursion tactics.  He did a crouched sweep of the room but it was empty.  John beckoned Sherlock forward and he passed him into the room to feel the seat of the chair in front of the TV.
Deep In The Dark
John reached across to Sherlock’s bedside table, got out the lube and squeezed some onto Sherlock’s fingers.  Whilst Sherlock went down to start working Greg open, John went up and captured the groans that were freely falling from Greg’s lips.  He knew the moment when Sherlock circled Greg’s hole, pressing the tip of his finger against the skin because Greg almost squeaked into his mouth.  John ran his fingers down Greg’s chest and played with his nipples, distracting him slightly so that Sherlock could work his first finger in.
“You’re going to make me say it, aren’t you?”
“You’re lucky I got here when I did.  The last air tower I passed said they were closing the airport because of this storm approaching and you saw how rough the water was.  I don’t think I could have brought it down if it had been much worse.”
“It was a great surprise.  Thank you, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock.  I wanted to ask if you would like to go out for a meal tomorrow night?  With me.  As a date, I mean.”  John was still a little flustered so he tried again.  “Would you like to go on a date with me?”
He saw one of the boys distracting the teacher by the drinks table whilst his friend slipped the obligatory booze into the punch and vowed to make sure he stayed away from that.  He did eventually walk over to help himself to a bottle of water, though.  If he was going to have to stand in this ridiculously overheated room filled with all the dancing students for much longer he thought he might pass out.
Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered and he slowly seemed to be waking up.  Eventually he squinted through the one eye he could half open and saw John hovering over him.
“Yes, I’m safe.  I’m here.  Can’t you recognise my voice?”
"Of course.  We'll get out everything applicable and let you know what items remain."
If you are reading this then I am gone.  My interpretation of the forthcoming events was correct and I have had to do this to save you.  Please know that leaving you in this manner was not something I would have wished but I willingly make this sacrifice for you.  Moriarty must be stopped and, as he stated at the pool, he had no hesitation to use my feelings for you against me.  I had several options in place to out-manoeuvre his strategy depending on his precise plans, but I hope their execution was not too traumatic to witness.  Please take care of yourself, John - it is important that you are well when my plans all come successfully to fruition.
By Joolz
John groaned as he felt those perfectly formed lips curve around his shaft.  This dream was better than anything he had actually had in real life.  Mary was loath to put her lips on him down there and had, in fact, only given him one blow job before declaring she didn’t like it and had only used her hand since.  He obviously wasn’t going to complain because as long as he got off in one way or another, he was happy.  He must admit that he thought it was a tiny bit selfish though, as he willingly went down on her frequently after finding out how wonderfully she reacted and how much she enjoyed it.  Never mind; stop thinking about that now – this was much more fulfilling.  He could feel that strong tongue moving up and down his shaft and it was heavenly.
“Yeah, that’d be good.  Where are we heading; to that copse over there?”
“Does it have to look so much like blood, dear?”
“Leave him alone!”
Martin laughed.  “Maybe be ready to duck just in case.”
“Okay, okay, sorry.  May I answer your question with a question?”
"Can you blame me?”
"When did you find out?"
He decided he needed to play this properly so he locked his door and headed off to the roof access.  He’d previously taken a squashy pillow up there which he kept covered in plastic so that it didn’t get soaked when it rained.  He pulled it out now and got himself settled in the lee of one of the chimneys and began playing around with the new tune.  He thought of the boy as he played and snippets of lines about dark, curly hair and strong cheek bones sprang to his mind so he started trying to fit the lyrics together with the melody he was creating.  He kept stopping to write things down in his notebook, changing the phrasing occasionally when something sounded better another way.
“Are… are you going to kill me?”
As John was captain of the team he did a lot of the organisation and it involved him spending large amounts of time with Mary getting everything set up for their matches.  They soon found themselves dating and spending even more time together outside school.  Sherlock wasn’t happy about that at all.  He put up with the time that John spent at rugby and even put in an appearance occasionally to show his support – for John, not the game – but this was getting too much.
“I don’t think I can do that without vomiting.”
John wanted that today.  He wanted Sherlock to be able to show off for him.  He knew how much Sherlock loved it and he wasn’t blind to the fact that Sherlock hadn’t been too happy recently.  Unfortunately, he was too enamoured with Mary to let Sherlock’s usual antics stop him.
“Oh no, I definitely want to give it try.  As in I don’t know what I want to do first…”
“You’re here.  I just can’t believe it.  I asked for a miracle and here you are.”
“By all rights I should be getting incredibly pissed with my mates this evening, Sherlock, so I thought I’d make the best of it and indulge in the booze even if I can’t include the company.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows at such a comment.  He had really thought that John had moved on and forgotten about him and was surprised to hear otherwise.
John got him a cup of water and helped him to take a few sips to clear his throat.  He plumped his pillows a bit and propped him up slightly, making sure not to move his hand.
"We really must cure you of this shyness, John; charming though your blushes are."
“Oh God!  I need… I’m going to… Please.”
“It’s great to see you.  Happy Boxing Day.”
“I would never…”
“Indeed, John.  Let me assist you then.”
"Because you intrigue me and I wanted to try it; you’re interested in me for my mind as well as just my face."
Marcus and Rebecca had been sitting together to the left of the stage, watching all the action avidly.  They’d been too busy picking up all the cues, in case they were called on to fill any of the roles, so they would be able to slot in easily without too much extra rehearsal being necessary.  They had seemed quite absorbed in what was going on, so Sherlock doubted that they had been waiting for the chandelier to fall - he couldn't rule them out, though, as both of them possibly stood to gain by an injury to a cast member.
That had never happened with John.  Everything he did was different and exciting and he managed to surprise Sherlock at every turn.  Even the boring things he did were somehow more interesting than they would be from anyone else.  He had the ability to absorb Sherlock’s destructive energy and turn it into more constructive avenues which had surely saved the flat more times than Sherlock could count, given the frequency with which that had happened at his other flats, usually resulting in him being quickly ousted to find somewhere new to live.
"Ahhh, what the fuck?"
“This is one of the Holmes estates – mine, in fact.  Mycroft has the main property in Hampshire and he lives in our London home.  I have this one, which is in Sussex by the way, and we jointly own a place in Scotland.  There’s also my grandmaman’s chateau in France and we share part ownership of the ancestral home in Transylvania with the rest of the descendants.”
“We could maybe make our own if we can get some off-cuts of wood.  I’m sure it’s only like model kits which I’ve made before.  It doesn’t have to actually work because you’ll be supplying the voice.  We could rig it up with some knobs and a little light to come on behind the dial window.  What do you think?”
“Do you have something to tell me about the sort of riding you’ve been doing, John?”
"That's a good idea.  Apart from making the radio and collecting the gun nearer the time, that's the last thing we need."
“It’s true that nothing else has happened, but whether that is down to a cessation of hostilities or merely to our ever present vigilance, is impossible to tell.”
“Thank you, Mycroft.  For everything.”
"John!"
“Rot!  That was one of the best ones.  You can’t beat Sean Connery.”
“You shouldn’t doubt it, John.  Though it may have taken him longer to realise he possessed them, my brother is not entirely without emotions; as he has been discovering to his detriment.”
“He’s been tracking down the snipers that were set on you three and taking down Moriarty’s network.”
“We’ll have to see ‘bout that.  ‘Xperiment for ‘nother day, isn’ it.”
Sherlock, of course, took full advantage of the freedom and, on the first few he iced, he piled them high with every decoration going.  Then he got a little more artistic.  He decorated three properly; one for Mummy, one for Father and one for Mrs Hudson, herself.  He’d already decided he was going to have one with everything on for himself and he would send the others to John.  He got out the writing icing and on the next one he drew a picture of a pig and put one pink sugar ball in the centre for its nose.  That one would be for Mycroft.
Sherlock smiled at him, "And are you?"
“It is a special occasion, yes, but not in the way you’re thinking.  I decided that as it was my service and injury that brought me to you then I would celebrate that using my tie, but wearing it round my neck wasn’t what I had in mind.”
Sherlock usually avoided this party, even more assiduously than the one on Boxing Day, but John persuaded him to attend this year.  When they had helped themselves at the buffet table, John encouraged Sherlock to deduce everyone who passed them, and Sherlock was surprised to note that he actually found himself enjoying the evening.  It was amazing what a difference a willing companion made.  They even found themselves roped in to joining a special treasure hunt through the maze, which had been especially lit for the occasion.  Sherlock knew all the best ways to get through and they helped any of the children who were struggling to find their way.  Sherlock also guessed where to find the best prizes, and John made sure that anybody who had, so far, not found a present, was ushered over to Sherlock to help them out.  All in all, it was a fun evening, and they retired to bed in the early hours, exhausted but happy.  John had even managed to get Sherlock in to a secluded corner of the dance floor as midnight struck, to give him a sweet kiss, and then kept him there for some dancing afterwards.
“Perhaps there isn’t; I still believe two men should know at least a little about each other before displaying this level of intimacy.”
“I assure you I’ve been dubbed as the Prince’s knight.”
“What do people usually say?”
“Oh, very well, I guess the game is up. I see you won’t fall for the same tricks twice, Sherlock.”
“Mycroft.”
The voice belonged to a freckled youth, a bit taller than he was, heavily muscled by his work in the stables. He wore his obnoxious smirk like one would a well-loved gown.
Back in their rooms, John was once more reminded of his determination to understand what was causing his Prince’s black mood as Sherlock threw himself in an almost-empty armchair, his temporary triumph at unmasking Princess Adler’s disguise having been replaced by petulance once again. The knight’s subtle queries of the last days had brought nothing in terms of new information, so he decided to go to the crux of the matter.
Before the Physician - and therefore Lord Astair and a good part of the onlookers - could start to panic, John saw the King raise a calm hand and, bewilderingly, turn to him. And even though he couldn’t fathom what this latest development meant, he knew what he had to do – and thus, ignoring Sherlock’s unreadable look, he offered Physician Thompson the small bottle he had found on his pillow three days sooner, accompanied with an enigmatic note – “Just in case”.
Sherlock suddenly seemed younger than he had ever had, even tugging absently at his hair, a nervous habit John had never seen him indulge in before. John wasn’t certain how to answer – thankfully, it appeared what Sherlock really needed was for someone to listen.
It was John’s turn to be astounded. He detailed Sherlock’s features carefully, despite knowing how little the man could be read. He had seen anger, or at least annoyance, flash across the Prince’s face as his brother addressed him often enough to think he could identify it, but he couldn’t see any in the pursued lips and deeply furrowed brow in front of him. The deep tenor voice didn’t sound angry either, but rather…panicked? John frowned a little, unconsciously mirroring Sherlock. That didn’t make any sense.
John could barely breathe as Sherlock brought his lips next to his ear and – impossibly – lowered his voice even further.
“As another second child, I understand the feeling of always being compared to one’s elder and being found lacking. Yet consider that your sibling was at least another boy.”
His polite query of the man’s name got swept away as easily as his concern for Molly had been, though by an amused quirk of the lips rather than by a scathing comment this time. Instead of answering, the man lightly bowed, a gesture that seemed at odds with his earlier behaviour but in which John could feel no mockery.
Sally, who had spent most of the feast hoping for it to be over soon so that she could rest her feet a little and eat her share of the food, discretely stepped in sudden interest towards the royal table in order to see the scene better.
Just as in many other places, Sherlock knew exactly whom to talk to in order to determine if anything suspicious had happened in the royal kitchens. Janet was a tiny wisp of a girl, looking no more than nine when she was soon to be fourteen and more often sick than in good health. The main cook had an uncharacteristic weakness for the girl’s pale blue eyes and more often than not Janet’s only duties for the day were to make sure that the fire wouldn’t go out and occasionally to stir the large pot of soup that simmered perpetually in the kitchens. Although the girl was grateful for the reprieve she was also quite often bored and made it a game of hers to observe what happened around her – a habit Sherlock encouraged and sometimes rewarded with a few sweets or coins. It certainly wasn’t the first time he had used the girl’s testimony in one of his cases – this time, however, the young girl didn’t have much to tell him.
Sherlock certainly didn’t share his brother’s disdain for what Mycroft called “leg-work” with a particularly regal twist of his lips; the thrill of the chase was one of the headiest sensations he knew of, just after the extremely satisfying moment when all the clues just clicked into place to reveal the solution to a case. He had nonetheless refused to resort to such measures until now, certain his skills would allow him to shed light on the matter of John’s poisoning without leaving their rooms, something he found himself inexplicably reluctant to do since his knight had been attacked and Mycroft hat “reminded” him the two months they had been allowed were coming to an end.
There was simply too much noise, too many things to pay attention to, and surely Sherlock couldn’t be expected to think in such a maelstrom? He would have liked to scream at them to shut up, to turn away, but even he was aware of the impossibility of such a demand. John was stepping closer, though, and at this moment the shorter man seemed a broad-enough barrier to keep the rest on the world at bay; so closing his eyes, Sherlock concentrated on his knight’s solid, reassuring presence, on the light grip John had on his shoulder, on the calm rhythm of the man’s breathing and started thinking.
“That boy’s certainly annoying. He’s always picking on the newest visitors.”
This train of thoughts was the reason why he didn’t move when the knight in charge of the fight gave the signal to attack, even though he was usually more comfortable in the role of the assailant. After a moment of uncertainty, the boy in front of him met his eyes. He didn’t know how to explain what he felt, so he just let his teaching instincts take over and gestured at himself in a move universally known to fencers. Come on, boy. Attack.
“What a polite young man! You look just like your mother, John – but you must get told this often enough. In any case it was certainly no trouble to accommodate you here for a while, my dear, no trouble at all. Now, just hang your coat on this patter; perhaps you’ll want a moment to freshen yourself up while I call for tea?”
“There’s the John that was missing last night.”  They smiled at each other and set to work.
"You have the best ideas."
“Now, I think it’s Treasure Island time and I do believe it’s my turn to read.”
They got in position and Sherlock pushed John’s legs up, and John held on to them behind the knees.  He pulled them right back so he could see what was happening, and to give Sherlock plenty of room.  Sherlock knelt in front of him and held his cock in front of John’s hole, almost as if he was unsure if he should be doing this.  John took the decision out of his hand by pushing forwards so that the tip started to go in.  He gasped at the intrusion, which brought Sherlock back to himself, and he pushed past the outer ring.  He waited there for a moment, for John to acclimatise.
“You’ve never had a friend?”  Sherlock shook his head.  “Well come here then, friend, it’s long past time we remedied that.”
“But what kind of fun would that be?”
John closed his eyes and tried to remember what Sherlock's question was.  The question and answer both came to him in a moment of clarity and his eyes shot open as he blurted out the answer.  Sherlock smiled indulgently at him and nodded.  Then he leaned in and sucked a big love bite right on the skin he had been tempting.  John groaned in delight, both at getting the question right and also at feeling Sherlock's lips instead of just his warm, teasing breath.
“They were necessary.  It was all for science.  Admit it; you wouldn’t want it any other way.”
Sherlock undid John’s zip and, in one motion, pulled down his trousers and pants.  He let out a pleased sigh as John’s cock bounced against his cheek as it was released.  John kicked his clothes aside, but didn’t move away.  He was enjoying the sight of Sherlock on his knees before him.  Sherlock kissed the tip and then suckled lightly at it, before licking his way along the shaft and back up the other side.  He took John in as deeply as he could and tried swallowing around it.  He had been practising taking it in further each time they did this and he knew that the motion of his throat, moving around John’s shaft, would bring him closer to his climax.  John shuddered and moaned at the sensations flowing through him.  Sherlock did it a few more times; watching John through his eyelashes.  He loved the faces John was pulling.  It didn’t take much longer until John was gripping his head tightly, right on the edge.
Mycroft’s brow creased.  He knew that Sherlock had said that he couldn’t take any identifying papers or phone or anything in with him but surely he had been going back to his room at night and if he had received a message about John’s assassin he would have taken action immediately, regardless of what else he was doing.  At a minimum he would have replied to this Billy or passed that information on to be dealt with by Mycroft.  He would have wanted John free as soon as possible.  Mycroft had been passing on comments regarding John’s state to Sherlock and he had been able to tell exactly how hard it had hit Sherlock to be deceiving his friend in this manner.  He wouldn’t have prolonged the situation for any reason.
"What time is it anyway?  Shouldn't we be in lessons?  Should you be here at all, come to think of it?"
John was fitted with an ear piece for two-way communication and after having his measurements taken, he was provided with a smart suit with a camera in the top button of the jacket.  He was also given a firearm and a knife which he slipped into an ankle holster.  He didn’t use the shoulder holster for the gun, finding that it looked too obvious under his jacket so he tucked it into the back of his trousers as was his usual way when he went out with Sherlock.
John smiled his thanks and allowed Sherlock to help him in to it, joining in Sherlock’s laugh as he had to roll up the sleeves so they didn’t cover John’s hands.
John attempted another grin at the man, but it was quickly wiped off his face as he felt the fist smashing into his mouth.  He spat blood out again.  He thought one of his teeth felt a bit wobbly after that one.
“Snipers?”
John leaned forward and sucked Sherlock's lower lip into his mouth, then his upper, then he placed soft little kisses all the way along.  Every time Sherlock tried to open his lips to pull John in deeper, John would draw back slightly, smile and start again.  In the end Sherlock had had enough.
“I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve it, but thank you.  I feel the same way.  If your absence was good for nothing else, it showed me just how deep my feelings were for you.  I felt like I’d lost half of myself with you gone.”
John grinned back at him.  “Oh, it is so on.  You’re going down, Holmes.”
“I…,” he cleared his throat.  “Indeed.”
“I am being serious, John.”
“He said that?”  Some of the all-encompassing fury left John at that point.  Sherlock had heard him asking for one more miracle and was trying to do something about it.  He was being bloody stupid about it by not letting John help him, of course; but if what Billy had said was right and Mrs Hudson, Greg and he had all been in danger, then it was exactly the sort of thing that Sherlock would have done.  He knew that most people believed Sherlock incapable of such depth of emotion, but he wasn’t one of them.  He’d seen the way Sherlock had protected Mrs Hudson when the CIA had come calling.  Sacrificing himself for them was just something he would have felt necessary.  But why couldn’t he have at least let John know that he was alive?  One text, that’s all he would have needed; anything just to let him know he hadn’t caused the death of his best friend.  “You’ve been watching out for me?”
“You won’t find me arguing.  That’s probably my favourite place to be.”
“Morning.”
“Indeed.  Sherlock’s effects have now been released to me as next of kin so I thought I would bring his coat back to put with the rest of his belongings.”
“Ooh, promises, promises.”  John grinned back at him, looking tempted by the idea of being completely under Sherlock’s control.  ”Not for tickling though; that’s not allowed.”
“You won’t, I have faith in you.  I really want you to see how it feels to come whilst you’re sucking a vein.  I know you loved it when you were human, but let me tell you it is so much better being on the other side.”
When they’d had enough they got out, showered off the chlorine and got dressed again, before heading out to do some more exploring.  They went to the boathouse next and, after looking at the rowing boats and canoes inside, they came out on the other side, away from the house.  Sherlock led them down to a, now denuded, weeping willow where, he told John, he liked to sit in the summer, hidden away from everyone.  They ate their sandwiches and had a coke each; then sat back resting against the tree, holding hands as they took a moment just to enjoy their surroundings.
They ambled back towards Shaws, saying how much they had all enjoyed the film but none of them seemed prepared to go in to too much detail regarding the plot so Sherlock assumed that Mike and Molly had seen as little of it as had he and John.  He had enjoyed his afternoon much to his own surprise, though, and he was glad that he'd allowed himself to be talked into going to the cinema.
“Sher…?  Wha…?  How…?”
“Nonsense, John, you don’t want to go in to bland, army accommodation where you’re just staring at grey walls for hours on end.  I’ve got my eye on a place in Central London which I would be more than happy to share with you if you would be willing to halve the rent with me.”
“Are you talking about Sherlock?”
“You did save me, Sherlock.  You were so brave.  I’m here to help you now, okay?  I’m going to lift your arms down but I’m afraid it’s really going to hurt – as if you weren’t suffering enough already.”
“Letters?  I never received any letters.  You just left.”
"We could just have different colour fills for when someone comes in from outside perhaps; a bluer light to show the colder weather.  How do you want to do the murder?  Is it going to be off stage and we just hear the event or do you want it to be centre stage?  We could maybe have the lights just go out and then when they come back on the person is dead?"
“Shrl…”  John coughed up blood as he tried to speak.
John bashed him on the arm.  “Hey! Be nice.  I could just walk back over to that other table, you know.”
Upon landing, Sherlock was met by one of Mycroft’s ubiquitous black cars which took him to Mycroft’s secondary private office in Vauxhall Cross.  Obviously he didn’t want Sherlock to be seen at his public office in Whitehall as he still didn’t officially exist at the moment.
He also admitted to himself that he was glad to hear that Lestrade had still believed in him.  He had known the man a long time and he’d hoped that he had proven his abilities in that time so even though he had known that Donovan had forced his hand, he’d hoped that Lestrade would have trusted him enough.  To hear that he had been made to do it regardless made him feel a little better.
Sherlock pulled back completely and smirked.  “Maybe we should save anything more strenuous for when your shoulder is a little more healed.”
“Good night, Sherlock.”
“What do you want?  You know I prefer to text.”
"I suspect what you have is a hangover not a headache, my dear Watson, and those lesser mortals out there are no louder than they usually contrive to be every morning, whatever the inside of your cranium may be trying to tell you."
“If I’d known that that was all I’d need to do to get you to agree with me on something, I’d have done it years ago.  In fact, now that I know…”
He decided to go to John’s house to see if he could catch him there.  John’s father opened the door but he told Sherlock that John was out with some friends that evening and wouldn’t be home until late so there was no point him waiting.  John hadn’t said anything to him about going out that night and he was sure he had seen the curtain moving in John’s room as he turned away but there was no way he could force his way in so he left.
“What girls?”
My beloved John
“My feelings for you haven’t changed at all in that time.  I think I’ve loved you all my life, one way or another; since I first met you when you were six years old in that park with those ridiculous bullies, from whom you didn’t really need saving, but I charged in anyway.”
"Sorry, was that too much?  Didn't you like it?  Should I stop?  I should stop.  Did you not want to kiss?  I took it too far, didn't I?  I spoiled everything.  Why..."
Sherlock looked justified that John was assuming the blame, but he was not going to rush to forgive anything without fully understanding what they were talking about.  He wanted full clarity so that there would be no more confusion.
“Are you kidding?  Of course.  You can do whatever you want.  Are you sure you wouldn’t rather I do something to you?”
Sherlock’s nose crinkled as he smiled at John and kissed him again.  He pulled him down to sit in his lap so they would be a bit more comfortable as he didn’t want them to stop for a long time.  John was more than happy to comply, making the most of having his deepest wishes come true.
"The whole thing sounded great, didn't it?  I reckon this'll be the best show we've ever done."
John turned to look and, as there was no traffic behind them, Mycroft slowed down to allow a better view.  John’s jaw dropped as he gazed at the buildings and surrounding parklands in front of him.
25th December
"Get what over with?  And, of course, I won't be punching you or leaving, what on earth are you talking about?"
John walked over to his chair and picked it up in one hand.  He put it back down and walked back to the sofa and sat down opposite Greg.
“Well, we can certainly tackle the radio ourselves then, if you can talk the teacher round, of which I have no doubt.”  Sherlock grinned at John and they both went back to looking for more props.
That only left the three main members of the production team.  Greg, of course, he knew quite well from hanging around with John and he could tell that all Greg was interested in was the play.  He also knew Sally from seeing her watching the rugby as she was Greg's friend.  She seemed basically acceptable, although she could just as easily be annoying when she wanted to.  He would have to hope that seeing more of her didn't increase the annoyance to unacceptable levels.  He had thankfully found that having John around seemed to increase his tolerance slightly.  He didn't like to disappoint him so he found he focused more on John and tried to ignore other distractions when he could.
John took his time planting kisses all over Sherlock’s face.  The chance to finally get his hands and lips on what he most desired wasn’t going to pass him by.  It seemed Sherlock’s neck was, unsurprisingly, a very sensitive area.  It was certainly long enough and John had always envied that blue scarf for being wrapped so neatly around that taut skin.  John sucked just behind Sherlock’s ear and dragged a line down along the skin with his teeth, only pausing when he reached the pulse point where he bit down, giving Sherlock a pleasing deep red mark.  He kissed it better as he enjoyed the rumble of Sherlock’s moan at the new sensation.
“When you say ‘without you’, do you mean you want to restart our friendship?”
The moment of truth arrived and John called Mr Johnson over whilst Sherlock prepared to flick the switch.  He pressed down the lever and it worked first time.  All three of them beamed and John cheered and put his arm around Sherlock’s back, patting him on the shoulder.
“I’d like to see you try.  You’ve shown your hand there, Doctor; now I know what you are doing I can resist.”
The side of Mycroft's lip twisted in amusement.  "I'll be certain to pass your apologies on to Simon.  I'm sure he'll be distraught."
When they had a rest halfway through practise, Sherlock moved to the other side of the pitch so that when they changed ends he would, again, be on the same side as John.  He was determined to get the most out of his time here and certainly wasn’t interested in watching the actual rugby.
“Tough luck.  That’s what it’s like to be taken down by a master.”
“I want to get them all set up on a table so that we can just carry it through to whichever room we’re using for rehearsals and then everything will be to hand.  I’ve seen tables like that before and they tape little squares for each prop and put on a label so you know exactly where it should go and you place them on the table in the order they are needed so it is easy to reach for the exact thing you need.”
“The most obvious one is just to say you are recuperating which is true.  That reminds me, I’d better text Lestrade.  I didn’t want to give him false hope of recovery so I was waiting for you to wake up before I let him know anything.”
It wasn’t long before Sherlock felt and heard John snoring heavily against his shirt, John’s outward breath heating his skin through the material.  Sherlock pulled John’s upper leg over his own to turn him slightly more on his side and to settle him more comfortably.  He resigned himself to being trapped there for the long haul, not wanting to leave John on his own just in case he needed anything.  Some time after midnight, when everything around them had settled into silence, Sherlock found himself drifting off to the reassuring sound of John’s breathing beside him.
“I will.”  John followed that up with a punch right on the other boy’s nose.  It knocked him to the floor and his nose started bleeding.
I think I might follow your suggestion of cultivating a contact within the police with whom I can share my deductions.  The sergeant we met at that crime scene seemed almost intelligent for a police officer and I got his badge number and contact details so I thought I might use him.  It should do wonders for his career path if he will just follow my lead so I’m hoping he will be open to the opportunity.
John had had the odd girlfriend before but they never seemed to last long.  Whether it was because John always dropped everything when Sherlock called or because they couldn’t put up with the observations Sherlock let fly whenever in their presence, wasn’t something on which he dwelt.  With Mary, though, things had been different.  She didn’t seem bothered by what Sherlock said, just letting it roll off her back; and because John was dedicated to his team, he wouldn’t be put off from meeting with her to discuss things, regardless of what Sherlock had to say.  Sherlock had serious doubts that all those get-togethers had been strictly necessary and knew she was manipulating things for her own benefit, but John wouldn’t listen to him and Sherlock had often found himself sitting alone at home, where before he would have spent the evenings with John.
“Indeed.”
Then there were the adoring gazes from random members of the public, both men and women as they passed him in the street, especially when they were on their nightly walks.  These were the worst and John found himself trying to run interference; he would draw Sherlock away, distract his attention – not that Sherlock seemed particularly interested in anyone else, but John didn’t want to take any chances – and often times John would put his hand possessively on Sherlock’s arm or lower back in view of the passer-by to show them that Sherlock was taken.
“Sherlock, can you hear me now?  You’re safe; I have you.”
He felt his chances were looking up.  As long as John could get over the fact that Sherlock had had to lie to him to keep him safe then maybe they could actually come together through this.
They spent their day much as they had the previous one.  Sherlock got John food and drinks and helped him move about and even agreed to watch a Bond film with him.
"I know.  Now why don't you stretch up here a bit, you're much too far away."
“Dr Watson, how delightful to hear from you.  I was sorry to learn you were unable to proceed with your reunion.  How may I be of assistance?”
Rachel and Kerry said they would go through the clothing in the store room and pick out some warm things.  The play was set in snowy, bad weather and even though the set was indoors, people would probably still be in long sleeved shirts or jumpers.  A couple of the cast volunteered that they had their warm winter jackets in their trunks which they would be happy to wear for their characters, so that would help too.
21st July
“Yes, bloody hell, yes.  I want that, please.”
John tried to pull out as he felt his orgasm flowing through him but Sherlock gripped his thighs tightly and wouldn’t let him move.  John just clenched his fingers in Sherlock’s hair and let himself go, releasing into Sherlock’s mouth, moaning as he felt Sherlock sucking out the last few drops.  His legs went weak and he collapsed down onto the bench, falling forwards in to Sherlock’s arms and just resting there as he got his breath back.
“Well, you haven’t exactly made it difficult for us.  You’ve hardly left the house but we have been taking shifts and keeping an eye on the place just in case you did.”
John hadn’t let Sherlock refute what he had told him about their time being unimportant but he had seen the instant look of shock, followed by sadness in Sherlock’s eyes before he had turned away.  How could he do that to the person with whom he had spent the majority of his life?  He hated himself.  He was appalled to realise, though, that even his self-hatred wasn’t strong enough to break through his panic and identity crisis.  He tried to tune back in to the discussion which Mary was having with herself apparently for all the notice he had been taking.  He hummed positively as she looked up at him and did his best to forget the memory of those despairing eyes which were burned into his own.
John, please.  I’ll do anything.
“I didn’t, did I?”  John groaned and held his head again.  “Did I do anything else embarrassing?”
"Shall we go?  I know I don't wish to go back in there; unless you do?"
Yours
“Hey, I was not slow on the uptake.  I was just making sure it was right.”
“Longer than you have yourself, I suspect.”
“By all means.”
Things hadn’t really improved from that night onward.  John was a member of the rugby team and Mary had stirred up some interest amongst the other girls for starting a cheer-leading squad like they had back home in America.  She didn’t make them do the more exotic climbing on each other’s backs and shoulders making towers, as her countrymen did, but they did do dancing and cheering and pompom waving during half time.  This had greatly increased the viewing figures for the teams’ matches – half of them coming for the game and half for the show.
“Don’t be obtuse, John, you know what I’m talking about.”
By Joolz
The first few days John insisted they stay near the house to give time for all his bruises and stitches to heal and Sherlock had little enough energy that he allowed that to happen.  After that they walked a little further each day, allowing Sherlock to build up his strength and stamina and by the end of the week they had planned an outing down to the beach with a picnic packed for them by the housekeeper Mycroft had employed to look after them during their stay.
“I certainly want to spend as long as I can with you and we can at least sit together there even if we can’t do anything else.”
John laughed.  "I'll give you your due, you have thrown some wild bashes in your time; I just wasn't expecting this to be one of them.  Though I have to say, I have no objections to how it's turned out."  He smiled warmly at Sherlock who glanced down bashfully for a moment before rallying and reaching across to pass John his walking stick.
He suddenly pulled back and looked down at Sherlock.
“Yes, I can do both.  I miss riding when I’m not in Scotland, so I’d love the chance to go out with you here.”
"It's clear to see what a good influence he's been on you; you are very like him, John."
“I agree.  If it was solely up to me then I would have recruited your assistance in this matter from the beginning.  I’m afraid the operation is not under my control and sentiment has been allowed to enter the equation.”
“Oh, do you have some things missing or has it just been a busy term?”  John smiled winningly at her as he asked his question, in faux innocence.
“So I was good.”  John smiled looking pleased with himself but still appearing slightly out of it.
"I'm playing perfectly fair.  You can't expect to get the good stuff on the first question.  You'll have nothing to aim for."
“What do you mean ‘you know’ - what do you know?”
He had been custom measured for a tuxedo which was the most elegant thing he had ever worn.  He had a purple silk shirt with a black bow tie which wonderfully set off his sharp cheekbones (made sharper by the weight he had lost in the last few months from avoiding the canteen and his general loss of an already small appetite.)
“I saw you come in with her.  Not that I was looking, of course, you just happened to cross my eye-line.”
“I am, John.  I’m here and you can’t believe how happy I am to be back.  I’ve been so alone without you.”
"That was... amazing."
“I can think of nothing I would like more, John.”
“Hello darling.  What are you up to and who’s your friend?”
“That’s what I thought I was reading from you, but we’ve been sharing a bed for almost a week and you haven’t made a single move towards me.”
John told them what he had diagnosed and they set to work to sort Sherlock out.  He had a CT scan to see if there was any internal bleeding but luckily it came back clear and x-rays showed that the nose wasn’t actually broken, though two ribs were cracked.  Again, luck was with Sherlock, as the ribs hadn’t pierced through into his lung so they were just strapped up for now whilst they worked on prepping him for surgery.
“Don’t be absurd!”  He picked up his phone and called his brother, hearing a deep sigh as the phone was answered.
Sherlock had been quickly running out of ideas as to how to handle the Mary situation though.  He had tried ignoring her and tempting John with other activities, but that hadn’t worked.  He had made comments to her and about her, but all that did was make John disappointed in him and that wasn’t a look he liked to see on John’s face.  He had tried being nice(-ish) to her and John had been really pleased with him which he had liked, but he had been so annoyed at having to fake being happy around her that the effort had become too much for him.  He had finally been reduced to trying to avoid her where possible.  This meant he spent even less time with John which made him very unhappy, but he just didn’t know what else he could do.
"What's the matter?"
“You can still refuse if you wish, or if you don’t want to do anything?”
Sherlock grabbed hold of John’s arm and dragged him towards the stairs.
"Sorry, I do that.  I'll just shut up."
The boy reddened further.  “What were you doing with it?”
“Ok, let’s start by introducing ourselves and saying what we’re all doing in this production.  I’m Greg Lestrade and I’m the director and if anyone has any problems or queries then please feel free to come and see myself or Sally at any time.”
"I wanted to try something more, but I didn't want to rush you in to other things"
“Sleep well, John.”
It was a dazzling full moon tonight and John was almost struck dumb at Sherlock’s beauty as they stood together on what they’d come to think of as their bridge.  It had taken John longer than he had hoped to get started.  He had had his speech well-rehearsed in his head and was just about to deliver it when a cloud moved away from the moon and its full light shone down on Sherlock who just glowed.  He was caught in the light shining down as well as the reflection of the scene in the river which was almost as beautiful as the real thing.  John had to take several moments to remember to close his gaping mouth and to gather his thoughts about him again before he could continue.
“Sh’rl’ck.  Knew you’d come.  Always save me.”
“I just wanted to express my gratitude that I can see no signs of relapse upon you.”
John blushed and dropped his head, then looked up at Sherlock through his lashes.  "I'll certainly hold you to that later.  I don't think it would go down so well with your mother, though, so maybe we ought to mingle for a while first."
I don’t know how well I would fare in such heat myself; I have dark hair and very pale skin, but I am a master at disguises so I’m sure I would be able to blend in as necessary.
Sherlock eased John back so he could see his face.  He stared into his eyes unsure for once how to tell him or how he would take the news.  This was something beyond even his deductions.
John and Sherlock were in there straight after breakfast to check if the radio had set and luckily it had, so they set about getting it varnished.  They wanted to give it a good shine so they were going to do two coats.  They applied the first one and then left it out to dry.  They opened all the vents in the room, like Mr Johnson had told them, to help it dry quicker and to distil the fumes.
John’s senses were on high alert.  The hairs on the back of his neck were standing on end and it was almost as if he could feel the presence of Sherlock.  He had no way of knowing how or why he just instinctively knew they were going to find something here.
John sat on his own bed and just thought back over his evening.  The playing had been beautiful.  The boy had performed a few classical pieces, which John had recognised, all from memory.  Right at the end he had played a different sort of piece.  It had a more haunting type of melody and one phrase from it had stuck with John and his fingers were itching to try it out for himself.  He took out his guitar and tried to remember the notes.  He got it after a couple of attempts and when he was confident of it, he played it through again quietly, letting his fingers just riff off the tune.
“Well, thanks, Sherlock.  The perfect attitude to suit my mood.  Now, I definitely need to kick things off!”
He had had it all set up.  He had been training up his two juniors and David, certainly, had already shown signs of being fully capable of taking over when John’s tour should have ended, five months from now.  He had been in contact with his old university friend, Mike Stamford, who had been putting out a few feelers and was confident that he would be able to get John a position at St Barts, where he himself worked.
Sherlock needed no more encouragement.  He grabbed hold of John’s hand and towed him quickly towards their halls.  They split apart when they got to a more populated area and made their way up to John’s room.
Scenery –                                  Olivia Harvey, Julian Griffiths
“John!”
"You have to try these scones.  They're Mrs Hudson's speciality and they are to die for, especially when they're fresh out of the oven like these."
Sherlock nodded.  He was very keen to examine John's room and see what else he could deduce about him so they went up to the other end of the corridor and John led the way inside.  Sherlock stood just inside the door and his eyes swept around the room and then he started straight in.
“If it’s anything like what happened when you bit me before then I can think of nothing better.  I really want to feel you coming inside me when you do it.”
He had a letter from Sherlock.  It was for him alone and no-one else had seen it.  Not even Mycroft had found it.  He treasured it already and he didn’t even know what it said yet.
John and Sherlock headed back to their rooms, John eager to get started straight away.  He and Sherlock set themselves up at John’s desk and John got out his highlighter pen and Sherlock got out his notebook and pen and they had a first read-through of the play.  John read the stage directions and his own character and Sherlock read in for the other parts.  As John read the descriptions of the scenes Sherlock wrote down all the props that were mentioned and any other things he thought would be needed to complete the set up.  Every time John got to some of his own lines or stage directions that related to him he highlighted them all in yellow to make it easier to spot his own interactions.
The perfectly-fine man then proceeded to stand up and almost fall over again. He help up a placating hand – wincing as it made his muscles stretch beneath his wound – easily anticipating the knight’s reaction.
“Stop with all the Sires. When I asked you whether you were relieved to go home, you hesitated and didn’t answer – this clearly meant you weren’t.”
“Fine, Sherlock. I’ll indulge this little caprice of yours-” Sherlock frowned, there was this word again “-for two lunar cycles. A knight’s salary isn’t negligible, and I personally believe we have enough of them right now. So you’ll have to convince me that hiring this man was a necessary measure before your time runs out.”
“That’s disgraceful.”
“They always had trouble understanding us – the way we saw the world was certainly quite alien to them. Ironically enough, Mycroft was my only ally then; the only one who got it. It changed as they died, though. Mycroft was only 16, but all of a sudden he was the King, not just my brother. He had no more time for the experiments we used to escape from our lessons to conduct. He started talking politics, when before we had both held them for boring. And when he understood that it was the only thing that would work, he began using our parents’ memories to make me listen to him. ‘Sherlock, don’t act so rebellious, you know how it all upset Mummy.’ ‘Father wouldn’t have wanted you to react this way, Sherlock.’”
His answer was flippant but he was clearly shaken – at least to those who could read him. Seeing that, Mycroft softened a little.
“You saw then.”
Far above from the training grounds, Sherlock watched the proceedings with a look of apathy that felt both very familiar and totally insincere right then; although he had never taken an interest in the choice of new knights before, he had to admit that this time he had wanted to know what would happen. His new-found fascination for a fellow human-being had surprised even him, but the truth was that in spite of the string of deductions he had given to impress John, he felt as if he had barely scoped out the man’s limits. The would-be-knight had surprised him far too many times – with his fighting abilities, when he had raised his voice to protest against Molly’s role, when he had reacted with admiration rather than fright or disgust to Sherlock’s deductions… His responses were unlike anyone’s Sherlock had ever known, and he couldn’t help but relish the challenge that trying to understand this man provided.
“Yes, thank you very much Molly; here’s your payment, and you’ll find your mount a bit further on your right.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed a little at what was obviously meant to be a jab, though one John didn’t understand.
And he knew precisely where to start his investigation.
John, in spite of all his earlier irritation, felt himself having difficulties repressing the smile that the earnest voice was clearly trying to provoke.
The royal physician Sherlock had insisted on visiting in spite of the very early hour was nothing John had expected; instead of a grey-haired man, he found a fine-looking lady who instantly adopted a long-suffering look as she saw who was visiting her, a look that quickly turned to concern as she caught sight of John's left arm.
“I want to know everything about you, using all of my senses, one of which happens to be smell.  Do you wish to limit my ability to recognise you in any situation?”
"You're welcome.  I just saw it and thought of you; the story that went with it was just a bonus."  It was John's turn to blush now at the sincerity in Sherlock's voice.  "Is it my turn now?"
Sherlock did take the opportunity to more closely examine John’s scar again, though.  He had touched it in the hospital, of course, but this time he wanted to taste it as well and he swirled his tongue all across the skin, feeling the roughness against his lips.  He loved the noise John made when his lips slipped a little lower and he brushed against the edge of John’s nipple.  He did it again and again and was soon taking the whole thing in his mouth, sucking the skin and nibbling on the nub as it rose up under his ministrations.  He leaned over John to reach the other side and when he almost overbalanced he decided it wiser to resume his earlier position of straddling John’s body so he had easy access to John’s whole chest.
“Lestrade; in here.  John’s been hit.”
“You know I would always find you, John.  We got both of the men who took you so you don’t have to worry about that.”
Sherlock’s eyes lit up, then his lip turned down as he frowned at Greg, looking confused.  “If you are dangling false incentives in front of me to secure your pleasure for the evening, I will be incredibly disappointed.”
“Hmmm, I suppose so.  I wonder if we could do a search of the rooms to see if anyone has pills hidden away?”
John choked for a moment, not knowing where Sherlock was going with this.
"Don't look like that, tomorrow's not so far away.  I know; why don't we go and find Mike.  We still need to get those skis off him which I know he brought back to school with him.  Judging by the picture he showed you, they should be just what you need."
"Fuck off!  At least tell me the truth."
“That is what we must find out, John.”
After rugby practise one evening, John was heading back across campus and thought he caught a glimpse of dark curls disappearing into the Music Building.  This was his chance.  He had to check if that really was him, and if so, what he was doing.  When he got inside the building, the halls were empty and silent; all regular classes having finished for the day.  He peered in the windows of each room but none seemed to be occupied so he took the stairs to try the upper floor.
“Sherlock, is that bizarre phraseology your way of asking me for a 69, with some mutual biting thrown in for good measure?  Because if so then, hell, yes.”
“Let me have a look at you; have you been overdoing things?  Have you had any flashing lights or visual disturbances?”
John laughed, “Oh, it’s so good to hear that snarky tone again.  I even missed that along with everything else.  I… I missed you, Sherlock.  Things haven’t been good.”
Sherlock
“Why are you on your own?  Your mum and dad have obviously just split up, but why would you come here and not your brother?”
Definitely your friend
It was John's turn to blush shyly as he followed the others to the buffet tables.
“I want to taste you.  Can I take you in my mouth?”
Mrs Featherstone had explained the situation to Sherlock and John’s families and, after assuring them she would ring to let them know when the boys returned safely, they went off to their hotels for the night, until they could take them home with them the next day.
John was the first to surface, probably because his one leg was still stuck under Sherlock where he had fallen on it.  He nudged Sherlock, who slid sleepily over to the side, allowing John to stretch out properly.  John used his other leg to drag the cover up from the bottom of the bed and he pulled it over them both, falling asleep with Sherlock snugly in his arms.
Sherlock was made to go through it again for all of them, and when Greg’s dad had the whole story, he phoned the local police force.  They dispatched a couple of officers to take over the situation and take Julian into custody.  Julian had made a full confession, when asked directly by Mr Lestrade, so Sherlock and John, along with Greg, his dad and Julian’s parents all accompanied the police back to the station for official statements to be made and signed, before they were allowed to return back to school.
Keep going with your rehab.
The only thing they still needed, then, was the gun and they decided they were going to speak to the sports teacher about borrowing a pistol.  One of the optional sports the school provided was shooting, both pistol and rifle.  They had even had one of their pupils in the Under 21 British Ladies Pistol Shooting Team and she had only just missed out for selection for the last Olympics, so the school were very proud of their former pupil.  John and Sherlock said they would go and see the teacher the following morning and see if he would allow them to borrow a pistol, loaded with blanks, of course, for them to use in the play.
“Whilst this is all fascinating, can we just get to the part where we offer Lestrade sex, now and just get on with the threesome and the biting.”
"I'm glad you didn't spend the night in the chair.  It was nice to wake up with you, even with my head like this."
“What piece of me?”
"There isn't time; we need to do this now.  Sit in front of him and hold him upright with his head against your neck.  Now just hold on tight whilst I pull."
Sherlock’s cheeks reddened and his eyelids fell closed as his own thumb slid across the back of John’s hand.
“He was saying stuff about us.”
“Wait until you’ve met him and then tell me that.  Now, come on, your turn to ring your Mum.”
"Sorry, Mycroft, did you say something?  Couldn't hear you from down here and it's very impolite to shout."
"Well, of course, I would treasure anything of yours, but do you wish to part with it if it's a favourite?"
“Whose fault is that, Mr-I-can’t-wait-long-enough-to-take-your-clothes-off!”
“I want you to do everything to me, John but, as I said, I’m prepared to wait until you’re better for that.  Now seems like the perfect chance for me to explore you whilst you’re a captive audience, as it were.”
“Is something wrong, Sherlock?  Have you strained something with all that walking?”
When they’d finished the run-through of the whole play, they all gathered round Greg for his analysis.  He and Sally had been scribbling away, making notes throughout, so they knew exactly where they still needed support.
“’M hot.  Isn’t it hot?”
The Drama Club had decided to perform The Mousetrap by Agatha Christie which John highly approved of, having read the book, and he was keen to try a detective story as that was his favourite genre.  Greg Lestrade, who was in his final year of the sixth form, was going to be the director and his friend Sally Donovan was going to be his assistant and stage manager.  John knew Greg from rugby and knew he’d be a fair director so he eagerly signed himself up for the casting session and then tried to get Sherlock to accompany him.
“That was no mere entertainment, that was impressive, and I don’t impress easily.”
"Do you think we'll be able to fix it?"
“He started as part of one of those ‘step’ things that he was doing with his sister.”
Sherlock swirled John round again.  “Do you see the couple now behind my left shoulder?  She is the wife of General Harmon, whom you can see over to my right just getting a drink of punch for his secretary standing beside him.  His wife has decided to get her own back for her husband’s blatant affair by getting him fired for selling military secrets, which she herself has just passed to the foreign agent with whom she is currently dancing.  Mycroft is going to confront the wife and I am about to follow Jenkins when he leaves to take those plans back to his bosses.”
“A likely story, boy-” here John bristled; he had already lived through twenty-seven springs, and surely the man couldn’t be much older than he was. “The kitchens are in the opposite direction, so I dare say you must have got more than ‘a little lost’ to get here. Now tell me the truth: what are you doing here, huh? Looking for something to bring home? Or did you have something more nefarious in mind?”
This really wasn’t something he could admit to.
“My Lady, this isn’t proper! Please allow me to see to your dress right away!”
It was time to play.
He left a small sigh escape him, however, as he reflected on the matters at hand. The attack on Sherlock’s knight was an unexpected opening move and he had to think on his answer. It was also very possible, he thought with a slightly amused twist of his lips as he wrote a message summoning the royal physician to his personal chambers, that more players than he had expected were involved.
It simply didn’t make any sense. If the Prince wanted to train, why would he do so in the middle of the darkest hours? If he was engaged in a fight, who did he fight against and why did no news of his action reach them by the light of the day?
“I see I must retract my protests, in any case – you have indeed learned enough from me to be allowed a certain familiarity. But I find myself unable to reciprocate, as the most important information is missing.”
“This is not Latin. Nor Greek.”
“Let me escort you to your new rooms. You’ll be able to get your luggage from Lady Hudson’s rooms later.”
“Indeed. I think my maid, Lady Sarah, would join me in saying we’ve been spoilt with feasts every time we sent for even the simplest collation.”
“I do believe this scratch has been beaten in submission by the three layers of bandage you’ve wrapped around it.” A slight tightening of the said bandage – clearly a warning – was his only answer, and inexplicably he found himself fighting a smile yet again. “We should both find some rest now.”
He’d have liked to explain to her supercilious smirk just why his silence was more than cowardice or simple loyalty to his employer; but truthfully, he didn’t know how to explain or if there even was something to explain, so he simply let his mouth close and his brow furrow slightly. The young woman seemed satisfied by his lack of answer and her mouth became a genuine smile.
“He has proven to be unexpectedly useful in my line of duty.”
“Indeed. Do I get to congratulate you today, John?”
Sherlock’s lip curled disdainfully. Obey the King indeed.
He only emerged from his thoughts in order to hear his brother proclaiming he was certain Sherlock was innocent and encouraging Lord Astair to let them study the circumstances of the attack. The chaos that reigned supreme in the heavily-decorated room allowed for nothing that could be called an investigation but he could hear the main cook, immediately sought by an astute guard – Atkins? Hopkins? – whose face Sherlock memorized simply because anything other than total incompetence among the Guards deserved a notice, wailing about the quality of the ingredients and especially of the symbolic Ellebora leaf John had mentioned the soup contained – a dry leaf would have indeed been slightly more potent than a fresh one, but anyway even then it would have done no damage. The Princess’s taster had been brought forward as well and he attested to his perfect health, sounding more than a little frightened.
“Do you? And what could you have possibly learnt about me in our fight as brothers in arms, except for a vague knowledge of my fighting style?”
“And you honour us with your presence, my Lady. Nevertheless, I would appreciate to know where my fiancée is.”
“Help! Please help!”
Physician Thompson cautiously took hold of the small plant, studying it quickly und probably unnecessarily as any child who had already been in the forest could have identified the common flower.
“One of the modern written languages. The philosophers’ latest works reflect our societies’ change, John. The written word finally transcribes what our languages have become and the frontier between the analphabetic crowd and the man of letter is slowly but surely thinning. We’re heading towards a new world – and soon enough every child will be taught how to read.”
It also meant that he was one of the first to reach Princess Adler’s side when she turned extremely pale and softly slumped over the side of her throne, her knife clattering harmlessly on the floor.
“He’s a Sorcerer – burn him!”
The world must have titled five degrees off its axis then, because John clearly heard the Prince answer.
John was definitively confused.
Sherlock opened his mouth to object but Mycroft cut him off once more.
Most people acted before thinking. They were ruled by their instincts, merely reacting to stimuli rather than trying to influence them. It was an important part of the reason Sherlock despised most of humanity and certainly nothing he’d ever thought he’d envy. But he had been wrong, because here was John, white and not breathing and on the floor, and he really had to do something but still his brain wouldn’t let his body act before it had analysed the scene – white lips, poison, mug of ale slowly spilling its contents on the floor, most probable means of poisoning, he had to make sure there was enough left to analyse what the toxic had been, the door hadn’t been forced, someone had been invited in or had the key, or the beverage had been altered in the kitchen, was the drink left for him or for John, would a physician come soon enough to save his knight? And then a stray thought; this is just like this time in the forest when John had been hurt. But so much worse.
“Sire! I’m so sorry…really sorry. I can’t – ah – apologize enough and I-”
“John! Are you alright?”
“Extremely beautiful as well - she seems a good match for the King.”
“Spit it out, John. My knight won’t be beaten by some chemical substance. Come on, I thought you were actually looking forward to the ridiculous celebrations next week? You must be the only person in this castle that does. I’m almost certain Mycroft expects you to make sure I behave for the wedding, and you shouldn’t disappoint your King. Believe me, he’s a vindictive man.”
All seemed to stand still once more as the Prince sifted through the herbs contained in the Regent’s advisor’s bag only to hold up a few small violet flowers with long stems and dark leaves.
“But could he have come a third time today, at the time we’ve discussed?”
Another consequence of his lengthy fight was that the Blond was definitively taking him seriously now, he found out as the third fight began. Neither of them really knew just how good the other was, so they started with cautious tests and rather slow movements, but quickly enough the fight began in earnest. The other man was a good fencer, solidly built and obviously very enduring, John acknowledged, but he was unimaginative; he wouldn’t have lasted a minute in a brawl, where the rules of fencing duels were only known so they could be ignored more effectively.
Sherlock pretended to gag but carried on, “in the whole wide world and I love you.”
“That was brilliant.”
John burst out laughing.  “Been there, done that.  Well done for the reference though.  See, I knew you liked them really.”
John moved over to the door and edged it open.  He peeked out both ways down the corridor but there was no-one in sight so he gestured to the team that they would split up and head in both directions.  John and his partner went to the left and used a standard overlap and cover manoeuvre as they made their way down the passageway.  All the doors were either locked or gaping open showing an empty room so they carried on until they reached the end which led into the main storage part of the warehouse.
“No!  Don’t do it again and certainly don’t phone anyone else, I’ll never live it down.  You are completely correct; it was definitely a pig noise.”
“I have no doubts about your skills, John, and now that you are in full control of your faculties again, I look forward to seeing what has kept the people of three continents enthralled all these years.”
"That's brilliant; thank you very much, Mr Johnson.  We'll be exceedingly careful with our methods and the machinery, and we'll tidy up properly after ourselves, of course, and leave everything ready for your afternoon classes."
They had been getting more comfortable with each other since the first night they had arrived.  Sherlock had shown John up to the bedroom he had called his own whenever he had stayed at the villa.  It still had the detritus of several experiments with which Sherlock had been involved at the time. He was delighted to see that some of these would still provide him some vital data of decay rates over a substantial period of time and he studied them in more detail as the week progressed.
John laughed and nudged Sherlock's shoulder.  "Not you, fool; I'm talking about this gorgeous chap."  John held his hand out flat with a sugar lump Sherlock had given him and Mystery allowed him to stroke his mane.  "I bet you're a real handful, aren't you – and, no, I wasn't talking to you again.  I already know you're a handful, Sherlock, in all the ways that count, so you can wipe that smirk off your face."
“So, why don’t you tell me about some of your earlier cases.  I know Carl Powers was your first but how about some of the others.”
John suited the words to the action and dropped down onto his knees.  He unfastened the button and zip and slid down the trousers and underwear in one go, pulling them completely off before looking up at Greg through his lashes and humming appreciatively.  John decided to show Greg one of the joys of vampire sex that he himself had learned from Sherlock – the lack of needing to breathe.  He took Greg down in one go and swallowed around the shaft in his throat.
“Will you be able to get us to the base?”
This was also all in darkness but across by the entrance near the main doors they could see a van parked so it seemed they were correct to assume someone was in residence.  They looked around for a way to get into the basement as that was where John thought he had seen a light and John’s team mate pointed over to a door in the far wall.  John nodded and they headed across.  They had a tense moment as they sensed movement as they approached the door, but luckily it was only the other members of their team so they all joined up again to head down the stairs.
Matthew.  He was probably the one with the biggest part as he was playing the detective.  He didn't appear in any of these early scenes, though, so he was busy going over his own lines and not taking much notice of a scene he wasn’t in.
“Sorry, sorry.  Back to the taking-things-slowly plan.”
“Your finger is not what I want you to be sucking.”
This showed him that he clearly had no issues with regard to being in physical contact with John but there were more intimate activities which would, of course, be part of having a real relationship to consider as well.  He had never indulged in those activities himself, though he obviously knew what people did during the many forms of copulation.  Some of it he had, unfortunately, witnessed first-hand when he had been at boarding school, and though it had disgusted him at the time, he had to admit that thinking of John in that manner did not draw those same feelings now.   Surely that should tell him everything.  His interest was piqued and with Sherlock, curiosity was everything.
“Naked on the bed would be a very good start.”
“Really, you would still…?”
"Well I can't say I haven't enjoyed my time here and any time you want to come back I would be more than happy to do so, but it would be nice to see everyone back home and see how I cope in our own environment."
“Do you really think Sherlock wouldn’t have had a good reason for that, Greg?  You know what’s been going on.”
John smiled at him and leant in for another kiss.  Sherlock captured his lips and they spent the next few minutes locked together.
Even though it was still very early, the building was quite well staffed.  They knew him at the front desk so he wasn’t stopped as he marched straight up to Mycroft’s floor and smiled at Anthea as he walked towards her desk.   When she lifted her head from her phone he nodded to her then turned quickly aside and made for Mycroft’s door.  She jumped up to stop him but he pushed open the door just as she got to it and barged his way right in.  Mycroft looked up to see what the disturbance was, but shook his head at Anthea as she raised her eyebrow to query if he wanted security called.
Always yours
“What did you have in mind, John?”
“About us being friends?”
“That’s good to know.  At least I don’t have to worry about someone sticking a cross in my face or breathing garlic over me.”
“I know you haven’t done it before, brother, but you know how it works.  You would have done everything you could.  You’ve given him the best chance.”
His luck was in as John walked that way from the kitchen.  He heard him press the answerphone button and the voice say ‘you have one new message’.  It was actually happening – this was the moment that could change everything.
John sat on the floor, carefully pulling Sherlock into his arms and stroking his head.  He could barely see Sherlock’s usually beautiful features.  His face was swollen and bloody; his eyes almost shut; his lip split; nose bulbous and possibly broken; and cuts above one eye and across his cheek bone.  He looked down Sherlock’s body and could diagnose three broken fingers, maybe a couple of broken ribs and a deep cut down his right leg, running from hip bone to knee.  The trousers had been ripped and John could see it as a zigzag line on which the torturer had clearly taken their time and tried to inflict as much pain as possible; jerking the knife through the skin meaning it would be hard to repair and sure to leave a deep scar.  It had clearly bled profusely, though it must have been done at least a day ago by the look of the congealed bloody mess which had dried down his leg.
“Fine!  But, if I trip you up and you fall flat on your face then it’s your own fault.”
“I can think of nothing better than spending my time with you, John.”
Sherlock blushed and John thought it was the most delightful thing he had seen.  It said much about Sherlock’s lack of previous experience with compliments and John was nothing but pleased about that fact.  Not that Sherlock had not had interest before because that was just an unforgiveable oversight by society at large; but the fact that John had the astonishing good fortune to be the one to bring this forth in Sherlock.  He revelled in the thought that – if he had his way - no-one had or would ever see Sherlock in this way but himself and he would provide the man with every pleasure of which he could think.  Definitely starting with those lips as he had suggested.
Sherlock put the radio down on the table and they moved some other props into place for the first scene.  The light worked perfectly when Jasmine turned it on, and Sherlock used that as his cue to start his announcement.  It all went like clockwork.  It was a triumph and Sherlock couldn’t have been happier that all of his and John’s hard work had paid off so well; he was very proud and he smiled again as he caught John’s wink.
“It’s no less than you deserve.”
Greg got himself into position in front of John and held him with one hand around his waist and the other round his shoulders to keep him steady as Sherlock pulled.  Sherlock took hold of the bolt and raised his eyebrow to ask Greg if he was ready.  When he got a nod he braced his other arm against John's back and gave a quick hard yank.  John jerked against Greg's body and his eyes shot open as he let out a shout.  He saw a pulsing artery in front of his eyes and sank his teeth straight in to Greg's neck.
When they arrived on Monday lunchtime Mr Johnson was admiring their handiwork.
“I trust you, Sherlock.  I always have, even knowing what I know now, that hasn’t changed.  Yes please, I’d like to try it if it’s as good as you say.”
“John, you are the most stubborn person I kn..”
“What you said before… did you mean it?”
“I’d like that, yes.  In fact, I’d relish the chance to try and recoup some of my losses from the last time you walked all over me.”
“It seems I’m going to have to leave you now, John.  I’m afraid there’s somewhere else I need to be.”
Sherlock’s hands were gripped around John’s waist and he found himself sliding them up John’s back, enjoying the movement of the muscles under his shirt.  Sherlock pulled the material out of the back of John’s trousers; wanting to actually feel the texture of John’s skin under his fingertips.  Sherlock swallowed a moan from John’s mouth as he slid his hands along the ridges of John’s spine.
Sherlock’s fingers froze on the screen for a moment as he instantly recognised that voice which he knew so well.
“Oh you must call me Mummy, or Felicia if you’d rather.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrow at John, who realised he was doing it again.  He closed his mouth and smiled shyly at Sherlock.
John agreed easily as Sherlock's fingers traced over his body, peaking his nipples as he brushed over them.  He lay down and Sherlock moved down his body, resting his head against John's stomach, pressing soft kisses into the skin before blowing gently over the head of John's cock as it sprang to life under his eager gaze.  John rested his hand on Sherlock’s head, ruffling his hair as Sherlock leant forward.
"We need to examine the scene of the crime."
His relationship with Sherlock had been going from strength to strength since that fateful day he had been rescued from kidnappers and had confessed his love to Sherlock whilst in a drug-induced state.  He and Sherlock had been taking things fairly slowly; not only due to John’s injuries, but also because John didn’t want to overwhelm a relatively naïve Sherlock with too much at once.
28th February
“There isn’t a policeman over there, you know.”
Cast:
“My name is Sherlock Holmes and I’m in charge of props.”  He looked at John who was sat between himself and Greg.
Sherlock’s head was rolling from side to side, soft hair now sweaty and matted against his skull, as he tried to find some release from this delicious torture John was putting him through.  He moaned John’s name on a constant loop; or as much of it as he could manage, the end sound being almost broken off each time with a heaving sigh.
“Well, I…”
“Is that safe, Sherlock?  I don’t want to go crazy again.”
“That… was amazing.”
He sat on his bed and opened the box of treats he had received.  He unwrapped the paper tissue and looked at the heart – Sherlock’s heart.  There was no way he could eat that.  He decided that as soon as he got home he would buy some lacquer varnish and coat the heart to preserve it.   That was something he wanted to treasure.  With his plan in mind, he put it away for now and finished getting ready and went down to join the others; knowing it wouldn’t be too long until he was back home with Sherlock again.
Sherlock lavished attention on both of John’s legs in turn; taking extra care to suck every toe as he had each finger.  He spent a long while behind John’s knees which turned out to be very sensitive and he couldn’t resist laying a trail of bites up both of John’s thighs which twitched so beautifully each time.
The first fight opposed the Blond to Gangly Boy; it was quick and brutal. The lad seemed more anxious than ever and the first brutal thrust of his adversary’s sword made him stumble when he parried, leaving his left flank open for attack. As they had been told, the Blond then attacked the weakness with the flat of his blade; although it did little more to the boy than wind him a little, it meant he had lost the fight.
A long-suffering sigh indicated that the man had both expected and dreaded this reaction, but he still started to explain.
Everything seemed to happen very quickly then, as no less than seven armed ruffians started to surround them, spoiling for a fight. John drew his sword and sent a glare to the man who had stopped him earlier, now knowing it had been part of the trap; but to his considerable surprise the man wasn’t joining the other ambushers but rather imitating him in getting his weapon out. John’s mind, as minds are wont to do in the most dangerous of situations, abstractly noted that both the scabbard and the sword were of a quality he had yet to encounter in his home county, and then suddenly he was fighting for his life.
John was taking more notice of this scene, as his own was now over for the evening, so it was the first time he had seen the slight signs of animosity between cast members.  He sent a questioning look to Sherlock who mouthed ‘later’ at him.  John nodded and turned back to watch what was going on.  They tried it a couple more times but it wasn’t going so well.  In the end, Greg decided to call time on the rehearsals for the day.  Tempers were getting a little frayed, but they had certainly got some ideas of how things were going and what they needed to work on in the future.  It was clear that something was going to have to be sorted, though.  People would need to get over themselves to allow the play to be performed properly or it would all be a disaster.
Sherlock's legs slid off John's shoulders and John collapsed down between Sherlock's legs, managing to slide slightly off centre to allow him to breathe but just unable to hold himself up any longer.  Sherlock wasn't in much better condition and they just lay there for a while whilst they both recovered.
John’s hips tried to almost levitate off the bed at finally getting a touch to his cock and it was only Sherlock’s hands on his abdomen which kept him in place.  Sherlock grinned.  He liked causing such extreme reactions in John so he did it again.  Sherlock rubbed his thumbs against John’s sac, massaging it gently as he pressed little licks and kisses along the length of the shaft in front of him.  John’s fingers scrabbled against the sheets as he tried to keep himself still, alternately gripping and loosening against the material.  His good hand slid across and rested on the top of Sherlock’s head, running his fingers through the soft hair, trying hard not to force Sherlock down in closer contact.
What the hell was he supposed to do now?  He had let Sherlock give him a blow job – well, ‘let’ was a relative term, he tried to console himself – but it had still happened and, what was more, he had liked it.
Sherlock moved John's legs around his waist so that he could lean down and reach his mouth and neck.  It also had the added bonus of pressing his stomach on top of John's cock providing him some much needed friction.  Sherlock kissed his lips first; quick open mouthed kisses around their heavy breathing.  Then he moved down John's neck and hovered over John's carotid.  He felt John nod his head against his and stretch his neck open further to allow Sherlock access.
“But you hesitated.”
“But surely paying for Knight Watson’s salary will barely dent the generous donation sent by Count Bolmir.”
It was still a difficult fact to process.
“Princess Adler.”
His discussion with the King had been even longer and much more confusing. He had learnt what Sherlock had apparently forgotten to tell him, that he had never been officially dubbed or recognised as a knight; that his salary as Assistant Royal Physician would be even higher than it had been those two months; and finally that he was free to choose his own sleeping quarters. King Mycroft looked at him very intently as he explained this last part and for the first time John, as a brother himself, thought he understood this man’s motives just a little bit better.
“I beg your pardon?”
Surely enough, the Prince and his knight soon found themselves engaged in a fight with five surprised ruffians. No matter how many times the scenario repeated itself, John kept forgetting the sense of utter rightness permeating their fights alongside each other, or perhaps convinced himself that his memory had to be flawed. And yet here it was again, as always, this easy camaraderie that according to all accounts shouldn’t have existed after little more than a lunar cycle of knowing each other.
The other knights jeered a little, obviously amused by how quick the fight had been; and as John took the Blond’s place for his own fight, he felt a little irritated. The older gentleman had done nothing out of the rules, he had won fair and square; but John still felt as if it had been cruel to treat this fight as an inconvenience to be done with as quickly as possible. He was himself of the opinion that the boy in front of him was far from ready to be a knight, but he had also seen potential in his first parry and in his almost-perfect posture – he didn’t like the idea that after this second match the boy would be sent home in disgrace, probably convinced of his own worthlessness.
Sherlock sent the quicksilver of his smile in John’s direction.
Most of the knights obviously didn’t know how to react to this strange version of what was basically a teaching exchange, but the man who had explained the rules to them and was clearly the fencing master was looking at Gangly Boy with a new light in his eyes, so John considered his goal achieved.
“It was certainly no reflection of the man’s talent. It had everything to do with money.”
Almost as a last resort he had tried to engage Sherlock in what had to be the main topic of conversation everywhere in the castle outside their rooms, wondering aloud which type of financial and military bond for the two Kingdoms would be announced by the new couple as they took their vows and rejoicing in the idea of eating the traditional rich fare at the feast. Sherlock had first raised a brow at his extensive knowledge about traditional bonds before enjoining him to stop “trying to fill his mind with useless information” and engaging in a truly bewildering explanation (somehow including attics) of why he certainly couldn’t afford to remember just how many days a royal ceremony was supposed to last (five, although two were considered as the heart of the ritual) or the ingredients in the traditional soup that would be served on the day of the official bonding (even though he did raise his head when he heard John talking about Ellebora leaves, especially as the knight explained only the royal table was served the soup containing the potentially poisonous plant, laying it back down when he heard the recipe included no more than a single symbolic leaf).
