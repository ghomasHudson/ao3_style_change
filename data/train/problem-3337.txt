‘My wife. And apparently Chuck’s daughter.’ Dean wipes his hand over his face and scratches the back of his neck, his stress tells showing for the first time in heaven.
A few days later Cas is out at a meeting about a possible new project. He calls Dean with stress in his voice.
Dean strolls past, towel around his waist, drying his hair, back muscles rippling. It takes all of Cas’ self control not to drool. Donna gives him a knowing look. Terrible terrible man, Cas berates himself.
He’s so fed up of LA. He wants to be near his brother. Sam and Eileen are getting married soon. Maybe they’ll have kids one day. Dean wants to know his niece or nephew properly, not just be the uncle that visits occasionally.
He opens the door to the bathroom. The front door to the bar flies open with a gust of wind. Thunder cracks and lightning strikes the roof. Everything is shaking now.
Jack suggests a number of options. Cas declines them all. Claire decides to broach the subject with Dean when she next sees him.
He heads to the car leaving a mildly bewildered Cas in the doorway. He does have a meeting, it wasn’t a lie, but it’s not until the afternoon. He’s got a few hours to kill. He decides to go on a drive. Clear his head.
Cas doesn’t admit it to Dean, but his choice of route does seem nice, better than the route Cas would have chosen. They trundle along through small towns until finally they reach some open road. Dean lets the car run.
‘Don’t be silly Cas, why don’t you bunk with me.’ Dean turns to Cas. Cas meets his eyes with a startle.
Cas smiles. He likes her already. They make small talk, waiting for Dean. It helps distract Cas from thinking of Dean in the bathroom. He is a terrible person.
‘Yes Jack,’ Sam responds distractedly, ‘Just need to stop this bleeding.’ He’s grabbing paper towels and searching for a needle in their first aid kit.
‘Oh yeah Dad, that would be cool. I can do ASL at school. I know a few bits.’ Claire proceeded to sign to introduce herself to Eileen. Eileen beamed.
They spend some time contemplating the peace of heaven, looking out over the water and the forest, before deciding to head back so Sam can see everyone else.
The head peered out, largely covered in a thick had with ear flaps and a scarf over most of his lower face.
Dean stopped short. Cas is staring at him. The goo is up to his chest. He tilts his head to the side, smiles and gives a tiny nod.
He grabs his bag from the car and makes his way up the front path. Benny has given him a key and instructions to make himself at home.
He pulled away. Tears in both their eyes. ‘Oh, I see.’ Cas looked away. Neither was able to look at the other for a moment. Dean pulled away, took a final swig of his beer from the bar, before turning back to face Cas.
‘No, Cas,’ Dean’s throat closes, he coughs to give him a moment, ‘No date. I would love you to come with me.’
‘Not often, but yeah. They’ve been best friends forever. They pretend they still are, but it’s weird between them.’
His thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of their food. They spend the remainder of the meal in companionable silence devouring their meals. Cas hasn’t realised how hungry he was, Dean’s appetite was clearly catching.
An hour later Sam and Dean pull up outside an industrial unit on the edge of town. Local business owners had reported some strange sounds, screams and light flashes coming from the building. Police had been to look but hadn’t found anything. But they didn’t always know what to look for.
‘And...?’ She pointed next door. He had the good grace to go pink. ‘I had a little breakdown, mid life crisis.’
The Irish bar is gloomy, air stale. Dean seems much more at home. They stroll to the bar. Dean greets the bartender like an old friend.
Dean nods into his coffee, inhaling the steam, trying to inject as much caffeine into his veins as he can as quickly as possible. He had tossed and turned and only finally fell asleep at 5am.
‘I’m sorry girls,’ Sam took a final sip from her latest cocktail, ‘I will leave you to your hunt. My girlfriend finished work early.’ He blew them a kiss as she walked off.
Dean turns the car off and tries to speak. He opens his mouth. Closes it again. Looks helplessly at Sam.
It turned out that Balthasar had been a piano prodigy in his youth, classical music only. The evening soon turned musical, with Balthasar and Claire leading the way on the piano.
‘Cas was looking after his nephew Jack after his mom had died. His dad wasn’t a nice man. He’s in jail now.’
‘Cas,’ Dean breathes, ‘it’s so good to see you.’ He wants to grab Cas for a hug. He holds his hands behind his back to stop himself. They stand close to one another, staring, not moving, not touching. Dean loses track of time.
She pulls away the shirt to reveal a long strip of gauze and a long cut running across her shoulder.
Cas is bewildered by Dean’s sudden enthusiasm, but he guides him to a chair on the decking outside the Roadhouse. He presses two fingers to Dean’s temple and mumbles some words in Enochian.
‘I’ve never flown first class. Being able to sleep properly on a flight must be much more practical for long haul.’
She sidled up to Dean, shoulder nudging his arm, nodding at Cas’ retreating figure. ‘What’s up with him?’
‘Of course you don’t, Dean. Because you want everything your own way, the rest of us be damned. Nothing is ever good enough for you. I’m certainly not.’
When Ben comes bounding into Dean’s room in the morning he launches himself between both his parents. ‘Can we do a Ben sandwich like we used to!?’
They both go to speak, but back off. The moment of silence continues. Gets awkward. Cas grimaces and shrugs. Turns away, Dean grabs him. The look in Cas’ eyes is unmistakable. It’s guilt.
Cas didn’t respond. He didn’t like Lisa. He used to. She had seemed nice. She had a kid too, Ben was about Claire’s age. It seemed perfect. She and Dean had been together for about a year and a half when she suggested living together. Cas knew Dean really wanted to and was very supportive of the idea, he thought it would be really good for Dean and Claire, who had been around 8 at the time. He and Jack would certainly miss them, but Jack wasn’t far off leaving home anyway so things were bound to change soon in any event.
She grabs a class of water in the kitchen and drinks the lot, before refilling it and slowly climbing the stairs. She’s about to open her door when she spots a chink of light from her dad’s room. He’s stayed up, or tried to. She pushes the door open quietly expecting to find Cas sat up in bed, book fallen into his lap and head on his chest. She usually removes the book and turns off the light.
Once Dean had downed the shot and poured another, Cas spoke again, to Sam. They conducted a normal conversation as though Dean’s blow up hadn’t happened and he wasn’t sulking at the bar.
He and his bike limp back home, his ankle, the only real damage, swelling to double it’s size by the time he’s through the door.
The rest of the group arrived slowly, Sam took a place at the bar next to Dean and joined him in the bottle of scotch that Dean now had set in front of him, although he took it more slowly.
‘No Dean, i should be the one apologising. I was an idiot. I was hoping you were hating it, missing me, missing home, but it’s clear you’ve got new friends and it’s all going great. I was jealous.’
‘Cas. You remember when there was that article about you and me.’ Cas nods. ‘Are you annoyed at what happened because they may have outed you, or  because they thought I was your boyfriend?’
‘Hey Becky my love sorry to miss you, hope you’re having a good day. Chat later.’ There was some muffled sound then Alastair’s voice again, ‘I’ve done my duty with that twit, now come here darling.’
Claire stared at her and then burst out laughing. Mrs Harvelle looked perturbed. ‘Claire this isn’t funny. I think we should have a chat with your Dad.’
Cas goes on his date and Dean sees photos of the event spread across social media, speculation rife. He even has a few photographers follow him for a few days. He and Cas make an effort to be seen together, to ensure the press don’t come up with a jilted lover story in Dean’s absence.
‘Yeah I think you’re right there. It’s not like he hasn’t seen you since you’ve moved here, he’s still seeing you as frequently as before, but I think it was different coz he would always stay in a hotel, he didn’t get to live with you.’
Claire and Sam were looking at him curiously. He realised he had been muttering to himself. He turned away, slightly embarrassed.
‘Cas, no!’ Black goo was wrapping itself around Cas. Jack held it at bay, ‘I can’t hold it forever.’
Cas smiles, ‘She’ll end up at the twins’ house, they’ll get hyped up on sugar and dance around at midnight, then crash in the living room.’
The rest of the week passes in an anticipatory blur for Cas. He’s not sure whether to warn his friends or not. He decides not to. He doesn’t know how.
Sam comes back into the room just as Cas is making sure he’s set up the sub titles for Eileen. Bobby and Ellen are bickering over to one side.
‘Where are the gruesome twosome?’ She asked, hoping onto a stool next to her uncle. He passed her a bowl and the cereal before pointing outside.
‘Trust him. That angel out there loves Dean more than any of us ever could. He pulled him from hell, rebelled for him, saved him, saved me, saved the world more times than I can count. Dean can barely live without him. You should have seen the mess he was in the last time Cas died.’ Sam let out a short at his own words, ‘The last time he died, listen to me, how ridiculous does all this sound!’
Cas turned as he got to the door. Before he could second guess himself he spoke quickly and quietly. ‘I don’t have a gap in my life, Dean. I have you. You are my best friend and my co parent, for all intents and purposes you are my significant other. I’m sorry that I’ve held you back and I hope you can find someone that you can see in the same way that I see you. But you will never never find anyone who loves me more than I love you. If it were down to me alone, I would have you all to myself, because you are all I will ever need in my life.’
He came back to find Cas passed out on the sofa in front of a plate of sandwiches. He grabbed one, put a blanket over Cas and headed out for an afternoon snooze by the pool.
‘Ellen has leftovers for you, then I thought we could find a film to watch? Wait out the storm?’ Cas nodded and followed them downstairs.
A few days after Cas is home from hospital he thinks to send the information to Sam. Luckily he had emailed it to himself so the loss of his phone didn’t cause a problem. Sam promises to look into it. He doesn’t seem hopeful.
In the weeks leading up to Christmas, Dean doesn’t come to see Claire and Cas. He’s on the road busy with shows. He FaceTimes Claire regularly. He also rejects most of the names she suggests, but promises to think about it.
Cas made to start speaking but Dean held out his finger, shaking it slightly, dissuading Cas from talking. ‘You showed me. I realised when I was with you what I was missing in my life. And I love you for it.’
‘Yes Dean. I think he just wanted to stay out of your way while Lisa was here. Give you guys some space. But then got this call, and it’s changed his plans a bit.’
‘I can help with that.’ Jack steps forward. ‘I will take anyone who is awake from the empty and look after them. You can go back to sleep.’
The hotel was quiet and out of the way. No one had recognised Dean yet. They were just ordinary people.
‘Yeah he was most of the day, house was pretty quiet. I thought it made sense for me to have some transport for when I visit. Something small that won’t get in your way to store it. I came up with the bike idea. Cas wasn’t keen, you know how much of a stick in the mud he can be, but he saw the logic of the argument. Anyway, I needed someone to drive me to the show room. This is just a test bike. I called up my friend to ask for a recommendation. They are going to customise the bike but gave me this in the meantime. Still pretty cool, right?’
‘Hey Claire,’ Jack holds up his hand in greeting. ‘Did you enjoy the show? I heard your dad got VIP tickets for all your friends too?’ He peers around her to the group standing with their jaws somewhere around their knees. He gives a little wave.
Due to Benny’s visit they had adjusted the rooms. Cas was now sharing with Jack while Dean and Benny were assigned the room adjoining Claire’s.
‘Oh hey Ben.’ Sam turns to Ben as he saunters onto the front step, ‘I just met your mom. She had to run kid, her plane was going to go without her. She said to say bye to you.’ Dean watches Sam explain Lisa’s actions to Ben with ease, Ben isn’t phased at all. Sam is a real pro.
Claire liked him immediately. Balthasar was quite like Rowena in that she didn’t feel like a kid around them. She was included in jokes and made to feel like an adult. She watched Cas and Balthasar. She didn’t think they had any chemistry at all. Her dads has more spark than these two! But she thought her dad liked Balthasar, just maybe not like that.
She moved over and put her hand on his thigh, nodding, keeping her eyes on him. Before he knew what was happening she was kissing him. And he let her. So sue him.
After dinner that evening, as Claire was off giving herself a pedicure, ‘It’s sandal season, I need to do maintenance,’ Dean brought up the subject of his album to Cas.
Dean rounded on Sam indignantly, about to tell him it’s not the same. But , he supposed, it is. He hates admiring Sam is right.
‘The Pearl doesn’t pull people away from their timelines, it creates a duplicate to bring into the later time. It doesn’t say much about the time the person comes from other than the person comes from a time when they would be of most use now. Whatever that means.’
A few weeks after they met Dean was telling Cas about his chat with her that day over coffee. We should invite Charlie over for dinner soon Cas. You’ll love her.’
The DMW set was electric as always. Amara hovered on the side of the stage watching the show intently. Cas was surprised when she walked back on stage.  Half way through the duet he had to sit down. Charlie came over, ‘You ok, Cas?’
He was surprised at how calm he felt. The reaper who came for him was one he didn’t recognise. That was probably a good thing. He was reverent to Dean, thanked him for all he had done, told him it was time for him to rest. Guided him by the hand when Dean hung back looking at his little brother.
‘What do you want kids?’ Jack’s face lights up, ‘Milkshake?’ Dean laughs, ‘Of course, and burgers?’ ‘Yeah!’ Ben is always up for burgers.
Sam takes Dean to the hospital. On the way home - out of spite? To get a rise out of Cas? He’s not sure - Dean calls Amara. They meet for coffee and she drops him home. Cas’ car is in the drive (it wasn’t when Dean left). Dean stands in front of the house waving and smiling and shouts obnoxiously, ‘Thanks for the lift Amara, much appreciated.’
‘My kind of place Ellen.’ He raises a glass, gets a wink in return. It brings a smile to his face, briefly, until she turns away.
Dean let out a bitter laugh. ‘Yeah well that ship sailed a long time ago. I was lucky she was happy to play along for the tour and the album. She does owe me after all.’
It’s all happened so fast, the others in the room barely have time to react. The Empty screams as the black goo recedes from Cas.
They sit quietly for a few moments contemplating their drinks. The air between them is a little thick. They’ve been chatting backwards and forwards for weeks with ease, Cas isn’t sure what to say in person.
While they were waiting for their order, Sam caught them up on Jack’s latest album that he had been writing on the road.
He knows now that time moves differently here and it’s probably only been the blink of an eye. He gets that Cas was trying to make sure he experienced his family, kept Sam close, safe. He also knows that he was there his whole life, even when Dean couldn’t see him.
‘Dad everyone is talking about you two. They want to know who he is. They’re speculating he’s your boyfriend!’ That caused Dean to go even more pink.
Food is Dean’s love language. He invites Sam and Eileen over as well and that evening, hangover long gone, piles the table with cooked chicken, steak, peppers, onion, salad, cheese, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. There’s easily enough food for 8, not 5. But Dean polishes off most of the leftovers.
Cas turned around and slowly the scene changed. A forest floor replacing the lake, trees replacing mountains, the wood of the cabin changing. Dean didn’t recognise their new location.
That evening, after sampling one of Dean’s excellent pies, most of the group headed to bed suffering from food comas. Only Cas and Dean remained downstairs. Dean suggested sitting out of the deck. The wrapped up and took a bottle of scotch for warmth. They sat out under the stars, drinking, listening to the sounds of the forest. They didn’t say much. It was peaceful. It was easy. It was like old times. Until Dean spoiled it.
Eventually Dean steps in, ‘Ben, I reckon these guys might be a bit tired after their trip. How about we hang out on the deck with those cookies we made earlier?’
‘They’ll likely drag my name through dirt.’ Cas shrugs. He really doesn’t care. He looks up at Dean, then down to his foot. ‘How is your ankle? I’m pleased Amara could take you. I heard her drop you off.’
‘What are they fighting over?’ She manages to get out amid a mouthful of cereal. Sam glares at her until she finished chewing.
Claire grumbled under her breath about who was the older one of the two of them, really? Benny watched the exchange with glee.
‘Hey, he could have had a worse role model. I did kill hitler!’ Sam rolled his eyes. Several people commandeered Dean after that, wanting the full story.
‘Tell me, Dean. Was my life that worthless to you? Did my death mean that little, that just a few weeks after I sacrificed myself to save you, you give up?’
Dean’s in crisis in his chair. ‘Oh man, I didn’t mean it like that. I mean I can’t carry on like this. I need you, Cas.’
He looks up as he hears footsteps approaching. Cas is heading towards him holding another beer in his hand. Dean looks around confused trying to find the source of the music. He spots Claire through the doors leading to the back of the house.
Cas looked at him quizzically, ‘Yes of course, I can take you to Bobby’s, but would you rather not go home?’
‘Awww, now none of that sentimental bullshit. Or I’ll start to think you actually like it here!’ Ellen admonishes.
‘I’m a publisher. I’m used to assessing writing styles.’ He nods, understanding why she might have spotted something that others (including himself) likely missed.
There is a camera set up when they arrive for the meeting, the producer saying something about chemistry and screen testing. They’ve done that, but ok. Dean  is suddenly worried they might fire Ben. There’s another kid at the back of the room. He says so quietly to Sam.
Dean and Claire moved out. Cas saw them regularly, but it wasn’t enough. He felt like he was going to lose his bond with Claire, that she wouldn’t see him as her father anymore. He knew he wasn’t, but it made his heart ache to lose the closeness with the little girl he had brought up for the past 8 years. He knew his bond with Dean could weather the separation, they would be like normal adult friends now. But Cas worried that once it was gone with Claire it would be impossible to rebuild their old relationship from a distance. He was in mourning.
‘I’ve stayed with your sons over the years because I feel the same. Dean was the righteous man when I met him, and even after all the things he’s been through, I’ve never met anyone with a soul that shines so brightly. And Sam has really come into his own and developed his skills as a leader and a Hunter. They are both men I look up to and aspire to be more like.’
The split into tearms when they got to the building with Michael inside. Cas confirmed he could sense Michael inside but nothing else.
Dean stops pacing and turns around. ‘So if you turn,’ pointing at Cas, ‘this off, you’ll look like the Cas I remember again?’
‘I, Cas, you make everything better. I gave you my child! How can you not know how much I love you? And yes, maybe it’s taken me a little longer to realise that it’s as more than a friend, but once I did, you were already gone and I thought you never wanted to see me again. And that you didn’t remotely think of me like that. But, things have happened. I think maybe you do. So, you know, if you do, then I definitely do too.’
The thing is, that as enticing as Amara is. As beautiful and intelligent as she is. The thing is. Well the thing is …
‘I know. Different though. It’s ... he’s ... he’s going to leave again.’ Because everyone does, left unspoken.
After 5 hours his usual alarm, that he had forgotten to cancel, went off. He dragged himself out of bed and booked a flight. He didn’t know what he has been thinking coming down here. He could have apologised over the phone.
The conversation ends there as the hoards descend for breakfast. The next few days are full of laughter and games. Dean feels happy. And not at all like there’s something missing. No, not at all. He’s not going to look at that hole, if he ignores it it’s not there. The hole was there when Benny was around, so it’s got nothing to do with him taking off. They’ve text since, work/friend stuff. Seems like they’ll be ok.
Dean shifted back and forth, rubbing his hand on the back of his neck. ‘But do you like it? What do you want?’
Dean stopped outside his own door before deciding to continue on to Cas’ room. He gave a cursory knock and opened the door. Cas was inside, as usual, nose in a book.
Claire was staring at the big screens. ‘Huh?’ She said, coming out of her daze. ‘Oh yeah, he’s seen them quite a lot.’ She reached into her pocket to pull out her ID as they reached the front of the line.
Cas can hear the crack in his voice. He spots a space at the side of the road and stops the car. Turns to Dean giving him his full attention.
He settles into what must be a TV room. It’s comfortable with big arm chairs facing a plasma set up. This room feels the most lived in.
Sam is marching back and forth unable to sit still. Eileen, who has joined them by now, is crying as she bemoans the lack of weapons. Dean wants to go and punch something.
‘Maybe I should just date women, think it would easier?’ Jody is slowly leaning to one side, drooping in the chair.
Dean straightens his T-shirt and rakes a hand through his hair, trying to make himself look more presentable (even in his hot dog pjs) before marching out to the hallway to greet his son. He pulls him into a hug.
They go about the tourist spots for a few days, easy in one another’s company, but Dean can tell Ben is not quite himself.
‘Deano. Just the man I need, we have to make some schedule changes. Today is the same as planned, but here’s the rest.’
‘Sam? He told you where I was?’ He stopped, realising that’s not what Dean had asked. Dean was shaking his head.
The afternoon with his sister disappears in a flash. They part as Cas heads off to meet Meg for a drink and Eileen heads home to find out what mischief (read - endless work) Sam has got up to in her absence.
Dean stepped through the door to the smell of burning and a blaring fire alarm. Claire charged down the stairs ‘Dad, what are you doing?!’ Cas stood guilty in the kitchen holding something black which may, in a former life, had been bread.
He finished wiping the table and looked down at his coffee covered clothes. ‘I best go home and change.’ He walked out.
It’s late by the time his taxi pulls up in front of the hotel. There are a few photographers outside hoping to get a glimpse of someone interesting. Dean is tired and just needs to crash, order some comfort food from room service and fall asleep in front of the TV in bed.
‘No, I think Rowena is having a few people over. Might head over there.’ Sam nods, gives him one last shoulder thump and climbs into the car with Eileen.
Later that day the two boys were playing some made up game that looked like a cross between stuck in the mud and parkour on the grass outside as Dean made dinner. Lisa sat watching with a glass of wine.
‘I think I had better go too.’ Cas stood up as well. Dean looked between the two of them his brow furrowed.
Dean asked at reception for Cas’ room number, but unsurprisingly they wouldn’t give it to him. Luck was however on his side as Balthasar happened to be passing as he was arguing with the receptionist.
Sam, Dean, Cas and Ben get into Sam’s car and head off, with a wave to Jody who is stood on the front porch.
Dean peers at it for a moment, contemplating the proffered hand, then grabs it and pulls his nephew in for a hug. ‘Man, you’re nearly as old as I am.’
Dean waits until his hangover subsides before booking a ticket that evening. He’s got the details of Cas’ hotel in LA from Sam.
They stalk quietly around the perimeter, doing a full loop. No sign of anyone. Dean sees some scorch marks against the wall and heads for a closer look. He’s in business mode now.
He looked up at Cas, ‘I saw a realtor. She’s got someone who wants a long term lease on the place. You’ll get half the rent.’
‘Dean’, Tess smiled warmly as he entered the office, holding him by the elbows as she kissed his cheek. Damnit, if she wasn’t already married Tess would be just the sort of girl for Dean. Smart, pretty, knew her own mind. He said as much to her. They had a frank relationship and she knew he meant nothing untoward by it, laughed at his comment. ‘I’ll keep my ear out for appropriate single ladies then Dean.’ He smiled in reply. They got down to serious business.
The sound of running feet precedes the appearance of a young boy in the hallway. He stops short when he spots Cas.
Cas fought to stop the tears forming in his eyes. Jack was a man of few words, but they were generally pretty profound. Today was no exception. He was grateful for Jack’s perspective.
He strolls through the library to the kitchen. There have been some upgrades he’s pleased to see. The Dean cave is intact. He makes his way to the bedrooms. Sam’s room doesn’t have any of his things in it. Makes sense. He’ll have a home with Eileen now. Cas’ room is empty too. Ok. That’s fine. Dean is used to being alone.
‘No. My home in LA. Where Dean ...’ He stopped himself. ‘I suppose I should check he won’t mind.’ He hasn’t thought of that house as his home in a long time. Odd.
He dresses down, dons the standard cap and sunglasses as they head off. He hides in the back of the store as the saleswomen swoop in and take control of the situation once Claire gives the brief.
‘I was not intending to be. The trip was cut short. That idiot .. oh. Hello Amara. Dean what’s wrong?’ All Cas’ attention is focussed on Dean’s leg, his eyes are squinting in an accusatory/ worried glare.
‘I fly tomorrow unfortunately. But I expect to be home next month. If you would like, perhaps we can meet again then?’
‘Cas...’ Dean took a step towards him, tears in his eyes, ‘I’ve missed you so much.’ He launched himself at Cas, pulling him close into a hug. It seemed to last forever. But Cas pulled back eventually.
Dean never found a moment of discomfort with Cas around. The man was a considerate housemate, a sensible parental figure for both Jack and Ben, firm but fair, always deferring to Dean when he has already made a decision.
Dean wakes up in the morning to the welcoming scent of coffee and bacon. Cas looks fresh as a daisy. Dean feels like something died in his mouth. It wasn’t fair. He can barely murmur thank you when taking the hot mug and plate of food from Cas who grins at him.
‘Cas, uh, I don’t want you to think that me staying had anything to do with this.’ Cas looked up from his newspaper, squinting his eyes, ‘But, uh, would you listen to our album, see what you think?’
Dean didn’t let his gaze drop, but the look on his face showed his discomfort, his confusion, his worry.
Dean nodded. He hated to admit it but he knew what Cas was talking about. Because some small part of him was trying to do that, trying to make himself a new family unit with a mother for Claire. It took Cas almost leaving without her to see that she didn’t need anyone else other than Cas. So he gave her to him.
As if he had never heard the song before Cas listens. He does hear what she means. He knows which verses were his and which were Dean’s. It wasn’t supposed to sound that way. They had intended to have only one voice in this song. This woman was astute.
‘Turns out Chuck has a daughter. He’s not changed his stripes, was a deadbeat dad, her mother died in childbirth, she got put up for adoption.’
Cas takes a small, tentative sip of the drink in front of him when they sit down. He watches Dean get a foamy white moustache, but decides not to tell him. The drink is like a meal in a glass. Unlike any beer he has had before. He doesn’t dislike it, just likely to take some getting used to.
‘Dean I get you feel responsible for the show and you want to do a good job. But the whole thing isn’t on you. And if the industry is getting you down, just quit. You’ve made a name for yourself, had an amazing career. No one can fault that. Go and do Broadway, or community theatre. Try directing small indie movies. No one else cares. You need to do what makes you happy.’
Cas stepped outside and was pleased to feel a refreshing breeze on his face. He wasn’t far from the river, he decided to take a stroll to the bridge.
Until Lisa came to see him. Told him that he was making it too difficult for Dean to commit to her, he was holding him back. Claire was not his child so he had no right to her. She wouldn’t be coming to stay regularly. Lisa told him to back off.
‘I was going through a tough time when I met Cas.’ Sam continued, ‘He and Dean had already become firm friends over the course of a few weeks. Dean didn’t know how much of a mess I was in. We had arranged to meet, he was late, Cas turned up and saw me. I had hit rock bottom at that point.’
‘She’ll be along, just catching up with her folks. It’s been a long time.’ Sam and his son share an indulgent smile, before Dean continues.
A path cleared. Their parents slowly made their way through the crowd. John Winchester the young man Dean remembered from all those years ago, before he knew about demons and monsters, happy. He surged forwards and grabbed both boys. ‘I’m so proud of you both, and I’m so sorry.’ Mary joined them and the four of them stood there quietly, savouring being together again.
‘Really? Seemed like he was. Perhaps I’m just tired too. I think I’ll head to bed as well.’ Cas marches off up the stairs. He hopes the rest of the weekend won’t be too miserable.
He rushes around the house on Saturday morning doing his chores and grabs a cab to downtown to meet Eileen for brunch.
Sam came wandering into the room a short while later. They were still talking about angels. He filled them in in some of the lore that Mary didn’t know, some of their history with angels.
Sam nods, he gets it. He pulls Jack in,  closely followed by Eileen. They sob into Jack’s shoulder, but they are happy tears.  Jack, having learnt his emotional responses from the Winchesters and an angel doesn’t quite know what to do with his arms. Dean helps him.
When Cas eventually died, Dean followed within a month. The doctors couldn’t find a particular cause. His heart just gave out one day.
Freddie breaks in, suddenly, ‘So is your mom who he wrote that song ‘You Changed Me for? She’s the one with the blue eyes you could drown in?’
‘You prefer tall dark and handsome then? Jody says with a wink. Sam shrugs. ‘I’m not picky. Anyway, we’re trying to find someone for Dean here!’
Cas reasons with her, ‘We might let you have alcohol on occasion Claire, but I’m not going to let you join in a drinking game.’ Claire pouts.
‘Fine, I’ll text Sam to meet us at the Irish bar down the street.’ He downs his drink, grabs his phone and stands. Cas follows suit.
He grabbed his key and opened the door. He noticed a flash of fabric at the end of the corridor as he stepped out. Otherwise no one else was around. It was late.
Jack turns with a smile. Beth is making fish faces at him, opening and closing her mouth. No noise comes out. Claire snorts.
Meg holds her hand up to his forehead, ‘No fever, but you must be ill. Why else turn down a chance to spend hours staring adoringly at that man on the big screen. Have you moved on? Found another idol?’
‘Am I your sole source of entertainment Dean? I have other things to do than text you constantly, you know.’
‘Dean Winchester.’ Ellen’s reaching under the bar now, no doubt for a gun. Dean doesn’t think there’s actually one there, but you never know. Dean is almost at the man’s side, suddenly feeling naked without a knife or a gun at his side himself. He needs to find out how to sort that out. He’ll need to speak with Jack, he puts the thought out of his mind for the moment, readying to take the guy down.
His voice soulful, accompanied only by his brother on an acoustic guitar, begins ‘Moon River, wider than a mile...’ it’s words hauntingly reverberating around the stadium. The crowd sways, lighters come out. There’s no applause when he finishes, just silence from the crowd. Claire stares up at the stage, mesmerised, tears threatening to spill down her cheeks. She’s not the only one, there are sniffles all around her.
‘You want to know what I think?’ He ignored the glare he could sense coming through the phone from Dean, ‘He won’t admit it but he missed you as much as you missed him.’
We ended up at the same foster home eventually. We had been through a very similar experience of home after home. But we got really lucky in our last one.’
As Dean lay there in the snow, hypothermia setting in, he thought back to his long life. He had seen his nephew be born and grow up, his great nephew had just arrived. It hadn’t been all bad after all. The spite was gone. He was ready now, as ready as he had been that day. He laughed to himself, perhaps Cas had a day off.
‘Are you sure? I could tell you more about how you are the most beautiful soul I have ever seen. How bright it burns. How you made me rebel from heaven. Turn away from god and all the angels and billions of years of life before you arrived. I could tell you that was all because of you Dean?’ While he was speaking Cas was slowly pulling Dean closer. Dean couldn’t look at him, just stared at his hand on his arm.
‘That you had a fight and you left. Yes.’ She signed back. He didn’t add anything more. His pursed lips told Eileen there was more to it, but she has already known. Suspected from the moment Dean told them something about what had really happened. Cas had never said how he felt about Dean, but she and Sam knew. Had been waiting for the day when something happened. They hadn’t expected this though.
At the end of the day she stood with her friends to one side of the car park, waiting for Dean to show as he had promised.
Dean laughs to break the awkward silence and takes Castiel’s hand gently. The blue eyed man keeps eye contact the whole time during their exchange.
Still, it’s hard to ignore the headlines blaring at him when he is stood in line for groceries. Why is it always there? ‘Exclusive interview with Castiel Novak - ‘The one person I want is someone I know I can’t have.’
Kaia is the first to snap out of it. She puts out her hand, grasping the first person she meets (Sam), and shaking his hand. Alex soon follows and then the group are making introductions.
Castiel nodded. ‘Jack would enjoy that certainly. As would I.’ He smiled carefully at Dean. The star wattage creeping out to blind Dean.
‘I gripped him tight and raised him for perdition.’ Dean looked slightly flabbergasted at that, grumbling in a remarkably similar way to Bobby, ‘Weird, dude.’
Cas laughs, ‘You know I have spare everything, and there are probably several items in my wardrobe which are yours anyway. You’ll be fine until the morning. I’m sure Charlie can bring your things over.’
‘Dean suggested this.’ She handed over an envelope. It was adoption papers. Signed by Dean and Mary Edland officially making Cas Claire’s Dad.
Cas is bored from sitting around at home for a few weeks and looking forward to spending some quality time with his friend.  He’s feeling guilty again at how selfish he feels, possessive even. He’s grateful that it’s just going to be the two of them, no distractions. He doesn’t deserve a friend like Dean. He doesn’t feel like he’s being a good friend in return. His feelings for Dean are growing more difficult to ignore with every passing day.
He realised that the stress Cas must have experienced during the Lisa episode, losing his family overnight because Dean had been too selfish to think about the impact on him.
By the time he’s lying in bed that evening he reflects on the ease with which he’s suddenly found himself a new friend. It usually takes him much longer. Eileen’s much better at it than he is.
‘I know. Like I’ve told you, serious case of denial.’ She takes a sip of the glass of red wine she’s holding, smirking over the rim at Cas.
She ends up with an elegant, sparkly, fishtail navy blue number that makes her look terrifyingly mature.
‘Haha, yeah Claire, pull the next one. That’s great photoshop though. Where did you get the photos? I’ve only seen the main one of Dean and Jimmy online.’
‘Yeah, I thought too. But I don’t think I can anymore. I’m not the right guy for you.’ Benny gives him a small smile and a salute, I’ll head off in the morning.’
‘I’m a little busy Meg.’ Cas snaps with a glare. She marches over. Rolls her eyes as she grabs his hand snd forces him to hold hers.
Dean breathes in deeply. ‘Yeah Bobby, soon.’ Bobby raises his eyebrows and gives him a clap on the back. He understands. That one takes a bit if working up to.
He mulls over the situation all the way back home. He means what he said, he wants to help. But he’s worried about what Dean will say. He knows Dean will be concerned for his welfare, will think it’s too risky. It’s probably best he doesn’t tell Dean.
‘Sam! He’s coming this way, look there’s an empty table next to us, do you think he’s going to sit there? I might die.’
‘It’s a dream Dean. I didn’t want to come to you as me, to disrupt your life. I wanted to blend in so you wouldn’t notice me, so I could check on you.
Dean was stunned. Lisa had never wanted to be with him again. Getting back together with Dean was clearly cover. Neither of them could afford for the affair to come out, it would wreck their businesses which thrived on trustworthy ness.
Dean took a step back, his face a mask. ‘Yeah, of course Cas. I’ll get out of your hair.’ He strode back into the house.
‘You had to Cas. It was our only chance.’ He looked away, ‘maybe it was the Pearl? We got to see dad, and found a way to kill Michael.’
Cas didn’t say anything, just looked over at Claire, before turning and settling back into his previous position.
Things went back to a semblance of normality after that. But the air between Cas and Dean was different. They could both feel it. Both worried what it meant.
It was a link to a video someone had taken at last night’s gig. It showed the end of ‘Hellhound’ then Dean starting singing on his own. It was the new song. Claire smiled remembering them writing it.
Dean flusters, ‘Oh, ah… sorry I brought it up. I thought maybe you would want to talk about it. I can give you some tips so you can win this idiot that you cant have over,’ he winks at Cas then smoothly knocks his coffee all over himself.
‘Guys, it’s ok, I was going to stay in a hotel for a few days anyway, I won’t be back late for most of the time it’s easier than trekking out here.’
‘Sorry to disappoint Rowena. But I would be grateful if you would keep it quiet. Happy to get you tickets or merchandise, whatever you like.’
‘It’s nothing Charlie.’ Castiel’s voice is calm and reassuring after the punch in Dean’s gut he delivered a few moments before.
Dean whipped round, staring at Eileen. ‘I’m so sorry! Sam, you should have said beforehand. I feel like such an idiot.’
When he was free of the tube and his bed had been raised slightly so he wasn’t laying flat any longer, Dean croaked to Sam, ‘where am I? What happened?’
For Cas it’s a few weeks of bliss. He gets to relax. Dean loves taking care of him. He gets to spend time with his best friend (yes he’s been elevated to that status).
‘Dean, Eileen can’t hear you. You have to face her when you speak so she can read your lips.’ Sam called out, signing to Eileen before following Dean.
Dean pulls back startled. Lisa grabs her bags. ‘Bye darlings, see you when you get home in a few weeks!’ And turns and walks into the airport.
Dean chokes on his coffee. Cas smacks him on his back until he stops coughing. Coffee is sprayed over the kitchen.
‘Dad, I miss you too. But other than that, you’ve don’t the best you could. I’m happy, Jack is happy. That’s because of you and the choices you made to raise us. You touch so many people’s lives, never underestimate that.’ She gave him a hug.
Dean wasn’t too sure how to handle it. She had stayed with him last time. He assumed that she could do the same again. He didn’t want them to go, but he hasn’t told Lisa that Cas and Jack were living with him. He thought about setting Cas and Jack up in a hotel for the week. He decided to see what Sam thought.
She runs her hands through her hair. All of a sudden Alex can see the resemblance. The mannerisms, they way she talks.
‘Cas, what the hell dude!?’ She passed him a glass of water that he gulped down. He sat in the chair sweating. Around 2minutes later during a scheduled guitar solo for Sam, Dean came marching off the stage. He looked around frantically, searching for Cas.
His wife looked thoughtful, ‘You could take a sabbatical? I don’t see him much in the week anyway, I could come out for a week every other month and see him then. It won’t make much difference to him. He’ll be too busy to notice.’
Cas whirls round. ‘No Dean I had not forgotten. If you want to bring your latest squeeze here that’s fine. I’m sorry I have ruined your plans. I’m well aware that Christmas is about family. I won’t get in the way of you setting up your new one, don’t worry.’
He roamed the streets for half an hour until his body started to cry out for sleep. He managed to fall asleep within seconds of his head hitting the pillow.
‘Dean.’ Said Sam , simply. ‘You know I fell out with Dad before college. He wanted me to become a roadie, work with him and Dean. I wasn’t interested. But I got into music in college. Started playing with a band. Dean came to watch, saw that I was much better than he expected. Asked me to join him. Not as a roadie, to make a band together.’ Sam smiled at the memory, ‘I was getting close to burn out anyway, thought I would just postpone a semester, have fun with Dean and then come back. But I never went back.’
He deleted and blocked Dean’s number when he got to the airport, crying the whole flight home. He knew he had done it for Dean’s benefit, but it was so painful, he wanted to curl up and ignore the world, shut everything out.
You saw her yesterday at the bar. Your evening started out the same. But you didn’t talk to the real version, probably didn’t even notice her.’
‘Cas!’ The man doesn’t falter or turn. Perhaps Dean was mistaken, it’s not him. He replays the scene over in his head.
Before Claire can answer, Jack is mercilessly shoved out of the way by a giant of a man. He scoops Claire up into a bear hug, swinging her round. ‘Claire-bear! I’ve missed you!’
As he held the Pearl thinking of a way to defeat Michael his life flashed before him. Regrets. Mistakes. Trauma.
Bobby was inside at the bar this time, harassing Ellen. Jo was sat at a table chatting to Ash. Charlie was trying to persuade them to join in a game of D&D. Ash looked up for it, but Jo was sceptical. They all stopped when Dean came through the door.
The make small talk about the new limited series Dean has signed up for. Michael makes it clear it’s his pet project. Dean is dreading it. He tried to say no several times, but apparently it’s his destiny. He sighs, wishing for not the first time that his life was different. On the outside it seemed perfect, but he was lonely and disillusioned.
‘Hiya Cas. You big star. Off to make it even bigger. Proud of you man. You’ll do a great job.’ Dean slurred at his friend, slapping him on the shoulder.
‘That certainly one of Cas’ strengths,’ states Dean, taking a sip of his coffee. He was beginning to feel human. ‘But it’s not the only reason why we keep him around.’
‘Ok well let’s cross check schedules and find a weekend that works. Or I’ll see you here again soon.’
‘I’m such a dick. This is why it’s easier not to get involved. It’s not fair if everyone who gets near me gets hurt.’
He strode over and stood watching Cas. Their eyes glued to one another as Dean picked up his part and they finished the song. Together.
They get to the door and show their passes to security. Once they are backstage, it’s total chaos. There are people running everywhere. There’s a group of people stood around the instruments, checking them over. Another group stood by yet another bar downing drinks. People frantically running to and fro.
They wandered into the ice cream parlour, Sam had tied up his hair and donned a baseball cap. There were only a few other patrons.
He’s put everything away from the weekend and is getting ready for a shower when his phone chimes. He picks it up expecting it to be Meg asking when they’re going to catch up that week.
‘Our dad, Cas. He was never supportive of either of us. Really drummed a sense of duty into Dean. He only sees that, not the positives in his life. He’s terrified of being seen as a quitter.’
Luckily the flight was called soon after and Dean didn’t have to endure Michael too much longer. It was an evening flight so he put an eye mask on, took some sleeping pills and went to sleep. Easiest way to cope with his flight anxiety and avoid talking to Michael during the flight.
He smiles at Dean, ‘You should do what makes you happy.’ Dean laughs, like that’s an utterly ridiculous idea.
Nine pairs of eyes looked at her with wonder. Vigorous nodding all round. They worked their way round to a roped off area to the right of the stage, close to the front. They showed their badges and were let through. As promised, there were plenty of soft drinks around, they avoided the bar, but enjoyed people watching.
As Dean sat on the porch of the Roadhouse with Bobby sipping a beer, Bobby explaining how heaven worked now, he couldn’t help but be proud of Jack and Cas. He looked down at his legs and saw their youthful strength returned. He turned his body and felt no resistance. It had been years.
This was the second album without Cas. This time Sam and Dean had done it all themselves. There was something missing. Dean hadn’t wanted to admit it. Somehow coming to see Cas and Claire had made it more obvious.
The others watched him silently. Younger Dean looked at his father questioningly, shock all over his face, Sam shook his head slightly. Jack seemed the most confused.
They stab him with silver (only very slightly) and salt him and throw holy water on him. No reaction other than a grim determination from John. Sam and Dean each take their turn.
He’s waiting for the big guns to come and show him his place. He’ll show them. A passing thought occurred to him that he thought Jack would have dealt with them by now. He will have a word tomorrow.
Dean checks his phone. Nothing from Lisa. Not unexpected. She knows what’s happened so she knows he’ll be gone.
With a rueful glance and a quick hug, Sam headed off to grab his bag. Dean came to hug Claire goodbye, ‘No rest for the wicked?’ ‘You loved it! I’m the coolest dad in your school.’ ‘Shhhhh, Cas will hear!’ She stage whispered, giggling.
Dean looked around, suddenly he understood. This was the place of peace and calm Cas had chosen before.It made sense now.
The evening of the premier he decided to tackle the problem head on. ‘Out with it.’ He demands as he’s fixing Ben’s bow tie.
Cas turned away from classical music that day and never looked back. Uriel and his other college friends tried to make him see reason, but eventually he turned his back on them as well, they didn’t understand him. He no longer felt like he was part of their life anymore. He had found new friends on Sam and Dean and the people her through them. The only one he still saw was Gabriel, but then he had always been a bit of a renegade.
It’s Dean’s turn to stare, slightly open mouthed. They held one another’s gaze for a moment before Dean abruptly turns and starts cooking again, humming loudly.
That evening after Sam and Eileen had gone home, Cas turned his phone on. He added Dean’s number back into his phone (because who was he kidding, he still knew it) and unblocked it.
Cas feels self conscious in the shirt. It’s a lovely soft material. Simple style but clearly expensive. A deep azure blue.
That night at home after Ben had put his, crying, wailing, teenage ‘it’s not fair’ case to his parents, they sat down to talk.
In between Dean has to go to the publishing house function. He’s not keen. It’s not his scene. He’s trying to keep a low profile, wants to publish under a pen name anyway, so it’s not like he can really say much when he is there. It’s probably a good thing Cas is coming with him, it will look like Cas was the one invited with Dean just tagging along.
Dean’s half asleep brain takes a moment to compute. He spots Lisa lying beside him. He decides to ignore that but gather them both in his arms, ‘You’re too Big Ben, I can’t get my arms around both of you anymore!’
As she hung up the phone he held it in his hand looking at it for a moment, the conversation was odd. She wasn’t as positive as he expected her to be. It was late though, he had probably woken up. He was hardly one to talk, he knew he was an ‘angry sleeper’. Oh god, he even used Cas’ air quotes in his mind.
Dean doesn’t need to see Cas. So long as he knows he’s here, he’s safe. That’s all Dean needs to know. Dean wants him to be happy. It doesn’t matter that Dean missed (misses? Always) Cas and feels his absence like a hole in his chest, marring an otherwise perfect heaven. That’s ok. He doesn’t get to have a happy ending, even in death. He wouldn’t know what it would look like anyway.
Cas agonised over what to do. He suggested to Dean that perhaps he should have Claire all the time and she could visit at weekends on occasion and for dinner sometimes.
Cas and Dean are now staring at one another across the room, Dean with pleading in his eyes. It’s like no one else is in the room.
‘I can’t Eileen. It’s too painful. I’ve done what’s best for him. I need to move on. We can’t go back to our friendship now.’
Hoots of celebration rippled across the group, like a Mexican wave. They started discussing the merits of standing versus seated tickets.
Sam chooses that moment to stroll through the front door. Lisa is a small woman, Sam towers over her.
‘Where the hell have you been?’ Cas let it all come tumbling out. Sam just held him as he cried. ‘Please don’t tell Dean! I don’t want to ruin his relationship with Lisa.’
Dean turns, slightly red faced, ‘No reason, just felt like it. Pancakes are ready. Eggs are done. Bacon over there. Hope you’re hungry.’
Dean turns around, he can’t watch. He reaches for a bottle on the table in front of him, grabbing his knife, turns around and lunges to Cas. He swipes the knife across his throat, pure brilliant blue grace falls from the cut. Dean catches it in the bottle he grabbed.
They shared a small smile, remembering Jody and their first weeks together. Cas had arrived first, Eileen had followed about a month later.
He grabs a passing waiter, ‘A bottle of,’ he gestures at the glass, looking between the three of them to provide the detail, ‘whatever this is please.’ Dean passes his receipt to the waiter, preferring that to trying to pronounce the name of Chateau Castres properly.
He looked around trying to plot an escape, when he noticed the figure had stopped. His heart was in his mouth. His palms started sweating. But not from fear. He would recognise that stance anywhere.
It’s a publishing house. He’d be working for a guy called ‘Marv’. The job description is a bit vague, but the pay is good.
That was all it took for Dean’s resolve to fail and he fell into Cas sobbing, gripping onto his lapels.
Later that evening while Dean and Eileen are geeking out over some new comic book series, Cas takes a moment to talk to Sam alone. Brings up his earlier thoughts.
‘I thought maybe we could go and stay in a cabin, maybe Lake Tahoe, Sam wants you all to meet his new girlfriend Eileen.’
‘You’re sorry?’ Dean was practically wearing. He grabbed Cas’ shirt, shouting at him. ‘You’re sorry! What the hell for Cas. That was the best performance of my career.’
‘You need to get out there. I’ve been telling  my other friend the same since his split.’ Sam had his serious face on.
He doesn’t want to go there. He’s spent too much time thinking about what could be. Is it too much to ask that he could get to be happy? From the outside, his life looks great. He’s a successful rockstar who gets to live a free and easy life, travel the world, get incredible life experiences that other people can barely dream of. What is wrong with him!?
As usual, Dean was cooking up a storm for the family. On Christmas Eve he spent the whole day commandeering the kitchen for prep work. He banished Cas, Claire, Sam and Eileen from the house. Jack was writing some new music so he was allowed to stay on the proviso that he stay out of Dean’s way.
He didn’t even return Sam and Eileen’s calls. He text Eileen and told her he just needed a bit of space. He was sure Dean had told them the full story.
He can’t pinpoint what it is. He’s a very strange guy. But that’s what makes him so loveable. He’s brutally honest. Which some people might find off putting, but Dean thinks is hilarious.
‘Haha, if that happens I’ll make sure to hook us up!’ She sat with Bobby and her friends making plans and answering questions. They were all interested to hear about her family, but she hoped they would forget soon and life would go back to normal.
‘Where are the gruesome twosome?’ She asked, hoping onto a stool next to her uncle. He passed her a bowl and the cereal before pointing outside.
There’s a queue to get into the school gate, because of course there is. Claire wants to get out and walk. Dean keeps inching forward. By unspoken agreement she stays, but slumps further down in the seat.
God, he’s trying. He really is. But, Dean feels relief after she leaves that he and Cas can carry on their day. He’s grateful, he’s such an idiot, but he’s grateful for the injury. As it means Cas has delayed moving out. That he’s got him as his own personal nurse maid, and no he has not fantasised about that thank you very much. Well, possibly a little. Alright, fine. A lot. But still, he’s actually enjoying being fussed over.
The man walks back to his car and grabs a large duffle from the back seat and a flask from the driver’s door. A blast of cold air hits Cas as the passenger door is pulled open. The man looks at him questioningly with his bag. ‘Put it in the back, there’s plenty of room.’
‘Thought I’d show Cas and Eileen the old haunts. Treat them to some quality Winchester time.’ Sam gives Dean an odd look.
Dean opens up his social media accounts immediately. Photos of them at the cafe heads together, talking intimately. Dean laughing, Cas gazing at him. Cas walking inside and Dean staring after him. Comments from people at the party in Singapore. The spilling incident and Cas helping wipe his trousers, ok so they do look bad. Or good. Depends on your perspective. He can see how people have jumped to conclusions after the recent interview. Cas needs to be more careful!
‘It’s probably a good thing. I would probably always have wondered if we had  done the right thing, ending our marriage, otherwise.’ Dean paused, ‘Explain what?’
‘Yes, of course. Claire would love it. And I mean all week if you like, not just tonight. She adores seeing you. It would be nice. Like old times.’ Cas winces, wishing he could retract that last sentence.
Balthasar was playing a little more confidently now, but looking over with an unreadable expression on his face.
‘No. My Dad, Dean I mean, had me really young. My mom left. I’ve never met her. So we moved in with his brother, Sam, and his best friend Cas. This was before they got famous. Cas is a writer, for music I mean. You won’t have heard of him, he uses a different name.’ She looked up, worried that the word vomit was too much.
At one point Ben, who is sat next to her, leans over n noo and whispers ‘It’s like he’s a normal dad,’ disbelieve evident in his eyes.
‘I see. And just to confirm, you don’t do this with Sam or Balthasar or anyone else you might consider a best friend in any way?’
‘Good evening Amara. I didn’t know you would be here.’ Tess is polite, but Dean can hear the edge in her voice.
‘Cas, I’m trying to be a better man. I want to do what’s best and live up to your opinion of me. I will keep trying. I miss you. I always will but I respect your decision and will let you go. Please know that I will always be here if you ever need me.’
Her hangover the next day is unpleasant. Dean feels at home, relaxed and happy for the first time in a long time. He tries not to look to closely at the feeling.
Cas is dumfounded. He blinks owlishly, waiting for his brain to process. The clean shaven man before him with brushed and waxed hair, is ... how?
Cas smiles and reaches for Dean’s other hand. Dean finally looks up and into his eyes. He wants to lose himself in the piercing blue.
When they eventually die, Dean gets to heaven first. He doesn’t have to wait long for Cas. Sam follows a little while later and Eileen comes along eventually. Hopefully their son will be quite far behind. Heaven is a place they all deserve.
Soon, the teary hugs had turned into back slapping congratulations and the party started back up. Soon tequila shots were doing the rounds. Sam and Dean made their way round the bar. They were near the back when the door opened again.
After scouting the bar for potential options, Meg calls it a bust and they sit down with their drinks.
The next morning Dean heads to Cas room before making his way to the kitchen. He’s out of luck, Cas isn’t there. He’s pondering where he might have snuck off to, without mentioning it to Dean, when he rounds the door to the kitchen and finds Cas and his dad talking over coffee.
Cas knocks on the door, hearing laughter within. He’s sent a message to Dean in the week telling him he’s looking forward to seeing him.
‘Oh so you are alive then? Don’t worry about me, I wasn’t concerned about you. Didn’t pray to you every day since you left. When I was dying, but no, nothing, not even a hint. Not bothered to drop by since I’ve been in heaven?’  Dean is now stood nose to nose with Cas. Cas hasn’t even flinched.
‘You will just need to close your eyes and say my name and you will be able to see me. Wherever I am.’
Dean looked past him and smiled at her, nodding. She pressed repeat, letting the music wash over her. She could hear it too now Cas had said.
He texts Dean. ‘I’ve been given a temporary promotion at work. I’m afraid the trip to LA will have to wait.’
‘I’m fine Claire. I’ve just realised what a mess my life is. How badly it went wrong. How I’ve ended up alone, without you most of the time, unable to spend my life with someone I love. I’m such a mess Claire. Please don’t end up like me.’ He started crying.
They met the family living next door the day after they moved in. Ben made good friends with Claire who was a similar age, Claire found a surrogate dad in Dean and Dean himself found a kindred spirit in her mother.
‘Well your team think differently. All the recommendations we’ve received are that you take over the role on an interim basis.’
If Cas weren’t so horrified that they were stopped at lights with other passengers watching at laughing when ‘Eye of a Tiger’ came on, he would find it amusing, adorable even.
Cas stands back watching the interaction. Amara leans in and kisses Dean on the lips. It’s a chaste kiss but Dean feels electricity. It leaves him speechless.
‘Dad got in a stress this morning, worrying about the snow making the trip longer and traffic and, you know, his usual general anxiety issues. We were leaving later anyway, I have school tomorrow.’
Ben turns to Claire, ‘Or maybe the Dead Men Walking? They were awesome! I would give anything to meet them.’
He wishes he could see Jack though, let him know how proud he is. Apologise for some of the things he said and did. He did a real number on the kid. Behaved like his dad. How did he let himself become that man? Saying it was all in the name of the greater good? He knows how he acted wasn’t right, nothing is worth messing up a kid over. He wants to tell Jack that. He knows he did wrong. Dean knows that because of all that he’s probably at the bottom of the pecking list, but he hopes Jack will visit. Give him the chance to be better.
The next morning they pack the car and set off to the airport. Lisa and Ben chat excitedly about the scenes he’s due to be filming the next day. Dean doesn’t really hear the conversation.
Dean and Cas head into the garage. Cas pulls the cover off the car. ‘She usually takes my car, as I don’t really go anywhere far I can walk, it’s less conspicuous at school, you know what teenagers are like. But we take it out on weekends usually, road trips to the beach.’
It’s Cas’ turn to seem taken aback. He thought Dean’s outburst back in the bar was anger at him making a deal without telling him. He hadn’t really listened to the words Dean used. Didn’t understand what he was trying to say. He thinks he does now.
He could see Sam out of the corner of his eye so he stopped panicking. He took a breath, ready for Sam to sing his part.
When they had all finished breakfast Jack, Sam and Eileen helped load the car. There was still no sign of Dean.
They soon settled into a routine. Filming was going well. Ben was loving it. Dean and Cas made good housemates. Neither one was a morning person, whoever got up first put on a pot of strong coffee and brought a cup to the other. They worked in sync with the two boys. It was really easy. Except for the bickering, which both men seemed to enjoy. It drove Sam mad. Their sons were bemused but largely ignored it. They were like an old married couple.
‘Love it actually. Bobby taught me everything I know about cars, it’s his auto shop you dropped me at yesterday. If I hadn’t got into acting, I would be right there with him every day still. Miss it all the time.’ Dean avoided Bobby’s eye. ‘You know all my bitching is just to keep you on your toes right?’ Eyes twinkling at Ellen.
Sam was watching the impending disaster loom ever closer. He caught Cas’ eye. He knew they were both thinking the same thing.
‘Anyway, next weekend, fancy a movie marathon? The cinema next to me is having a Dean Winchester extravaganza weekend. Thought we could go and binge.’
He’s never had a friend quite like Cas. They’ve only known each other a short time but he feels like he knows Cas better than any other friend he has.
Cas and Dean glare at one another before mutually agreeing, by shrugs and head gestures, to back down simultaneously.
‘But I checked her background. She never said she was adopted.’ Thankfully Sam hadn’t gone fully soft in his old age.
He walks close to Dean, squares up to him. ‘If you could look past the end of your nose you might realise that not everything is about you. I had a call on Christmas Eve when we got home telling me that my father had died.’
Dean is staring, lost, into his empty glass. He looks up hazily at Cas. His tolerance has certainly decreased. Or perhaps it was the champagne starter.
It’s a good party. Wide selection of people. A few he knows. He drinks champagne, gossips with Balthasar, wears a party hat and oohs and aahs at fireworks at midnight. They talk about everyone’s Christmases.Cas talks about spending Christmas in the mountains with his family. Balthasar gives him side eyes. He shows them some pictures of him and Claire and the lodge, careful to avoid any with Sam, Dean and Jack. He’s not in the mood today.
‘You tell me something like that, something I didn’t think was possible. Something I never thought I would get because of everything I’ve done. And don’t even hang around for me to say it too?’
Sam and Cas look at each other. Sam raises his eyebrows. Cas gives a resigned sigh and follows Dean.
Cas turns to the window, ‘Yes, very picturesque. More interesting features and depth than I was anticipating. In the landscape I mean.’
‘Nah, just the two of us.’ She let out a laugh like a bark, her eyebrows going through the roof. ‘I know, rock and roll, right?’
Once they’ve finished braiding one another’s hair, they order pizza and start the Star Wars marathon.
‘Fine.’ A raised eyebrow pushes him to expand, ‘She was… it was,’ oh god why is this so hard? ‘Yeah it was weird.’ Eloquent. Great.
The next day after taking Claire to school, Dean returned to a quiet house. They had used the SUV that morning as even Dean realised that a repeat of the day before was liable to make her explode at him. He wanted at least one member of his family to love him still. Due to his lack of transport he knew Cas couldn’t have gone far, but he wasn’t evident in the house either.
Dean, Jo, Bobby and Ellen come quickly at the commotion. Soon a bottle of champagne is located from the depths of a cupboard and the bubbles flow. Cas is caught in a warm glow of family.
Cas looked closely at Dean until Dean’s brain caught up. ‘With us, obviously. We’ve got a spare room. The kids can share, they’ll love it, saves you finding somewhere new. It will be good for the film, you can get some proper bonding time with Ben.’ Oh god. He has ruined it, their friendship had been going so well. He generally forgot that Cas was a mega star.
‘Absolutely. But he’s not keen to be in the limelight. It’s why he writes under an assumed name, why no one knows what he looks like outside the industry.’
Dean easily forgot how much Cas’ death had hurt Sam as well. He was too focussed on his own grief. He had been Sam’s friend too. Sam had dealt with years of grief for his brother and friend. It was unfair to leave him hanging, he should tell him.
‘Oh Cas, this is Ben. Ben, say hi to Cas.’ Dean appears behind the child with a stunning woman, with beautiful dark eyes and silky long brown hair.
Sam starts, ‘So, uh, Cas, about my brother. He should be here later. Probably should tell you... ‘ he peters out as it’s clear Cas is transfixed by the film, not paying him any attention.
They wait for Sam at the airport with a big sign for what feels like forever. When they spot Sam’s head above the crowds Ben starts waving frantically, echos of the young boy he’s growing out of being. He almost loses it with excitement when he sees who has accompanied Sam. It’s Jack. He’s beaming as well.
‘Thought you might have something to say about that. Jack got him out. They’re up there running things the way they should be, fixing things for everyone, making new angels to power the place. Cas is Jack’s right hand.’
‘I’m flying out tomorrow afternoon. Got some meetings in LA.’ Dean stands up from his spot watching Cas and starts to put everything away, holding up a hand when Cas tries to stop him.
The camera zoomed suddenly, taking the focus away from Dean and on some people coming up the steps at the side of the stage. Wait, was that? Oh my god.
He looks around at Dean’s home. It’s quite an old property, full of interesting quirks and character. The kitchen looks straight from the fifties. There’s an amazing library with a well stocked drinks cabinet on one side. He even spots a telescope.
Dean sighs in resignation, swipes his hand over his face, over the back of his neck, seemingly gathering his thoughts.’
The scene outside had escalated. They had both downed their weapons of post and fabric. Dean was stomping back and forth shouting, while Cas was looking stoically back at him. But Claire could tell, his temper was about to boil over. A few seconds later, she was proven right. Cas, in his quiet intense way, slowly walked up to Dean, spoke firmly to him in a way that made Dean shrivel. He then turned on his heel and walked back into the house.
After the end of the season, Ben gets called in for a shot at a superhero film. He doesn’t get the main part, but a few months later the casting director comes back to him about a role in the planned sequel.
Sam remembers that time fondly, even with all the heartache that came with it. ‘Dad died not long after. I think it would have killed Dean if I had left him alone, and things were just getting interesting. We had met Cas and he and Dean were writing together. We had got a recording contract. A year later it all went nuts! You came along, Jack needed looking after, our careers kicked off.’ Sam shrugged, ‘The rest is history.’
Silently, Dean climbed the steps to the door. Inside the cabin was a small, but clean and functional living room and kitchen. Stairs wound up to two loft rooms and a bathroom. He ran his hands over the stove, tried some of the cupboards, felt the stair rail.
He peers out of his door, ‘Sam?’ There is no reply. ‘Jack?’ Nothing. He comes into the library and looks up to see Cas stood, surveying the room before him.
‘Just long enough to tell him how wonderful I am and that you’re gay.’ Cas huffs, but goes along with it. As always.
She squeals. ‘I didn’t know he was even in town, wonder what he’s up to. Why is he here, does this seem like his kind of place? Do I look ok? Shall I go for it?’
They came up with a plan. They found a spell to give Cas a ‘moment of happiness’c to summon the Empty. Get Billie to reap God and Amara and when the Empty came to take Cas, push them in instead of Cas.
‘It’s new. We wrote it last night. Will see if I can slip it into the tour and release it as a stand alone single, maybe include it on the extended album.’ Dean suggested to Cas.
He speaks to Dean occasionally, but their easy back and forth is gone. Cas thinks perhaps Dean was disappointed he hadn’t visited. But he’s not sure. Maybe he’s moved on. Realised having a friend on the opposite coast isn’t that convenient.
Castiel chose that moment to descend the stairs with two duffel bags. ‘I’ll collect everything else another time, Dean. Lisa, I’ve changed the sheets, hope you enjoy your visit.’ With that he left and shut the door behind him.
Cas paused, then steeled himself, turned to face Dean fully. ‘If we could ever be more than friends, I would count myself the luckiest man in the world.’
Dean, on the other hand, hasn’t quite got used to his independent daughter and seemed to want to rewind time. The discussion became heated with Claire stomping upstairs, shouting at Dean that it wasn’t fair that he dropped in and out of her life and he couldn’t try and control what she did for one week a year.
‘My name is Dean Robert Winchester.’ His voice is surprisingly measured for someone just thrown on a bar, ‘My father is Sam and my mother is Eileen.’ Dean’s hands release slightly in surprise allowing the man on the bar to turn his head slightly to look back at Dean. ‘You must be my long dead uncle? Now will you please tell me where my father is?’
‘I get it, I’m not important. You regret it? That’s fine, it’s not like it meant anything to me either. You found a new Dean? Great, you can look after him now. Fulfil your holy purpose or whatever.’
Dean walked home in a daze, almost walked past his own house. What was Gabe talking about, surely this was about Meg? Who else could it be about?
By the weekend he’s fallen into a pattern with Dean to text at the end of every day with an update on latest events. It turns out being a film star involves lot of admin and meetings.
‘Hey sugar.’ Dean rolled his eyes. He pulled Benny in for a quick hug before leading him into the house.
‘Dude, that’s not what I meant. I love having you here. Wish you could live with me all the time.’ A grin forms on Dean’s face, ‘I can imagine us now, two grumpy old men sat in deck chairs on the grass out front moaning about the neighbour kids.’
Dean had to convince Cas to stay around. He knew Cas’ views of his father. They were justified if course. But he just wanted to enjoy all the people he loved together, even if it was brief. Cas was right though, they needed to work out what problems his dad’s presence would cause. He sighed as he waited for the masses to assemble at the table for breakfast.
‘Cassie, can you please just tell us all the juicy secrets? So we stop putting our foot in it?’ Balthasar moaned. They left Cas behind while they went for drinks, returning half way through the set, already a little worse for wear.
Predictably, Lisa arrived in a bad mood. Dean had spent the day stress cleaning the house. He’d tried to call Cas but didn’t get an answer. He hadn’t been back to collect his things or to talk.
‘House hunting. Eileen is moving back in, I’ve decided give her and Sam some space. They don’t need an old man and a kid cramping their space.’
‘Maybe he wanted to see how things went first? Maybe he just forgot.’ Dean stared moodily at the wall.
‘I, it’s not like that, it’s, I just, I was done but, Sam he needed to carry on, and I just couldn’t, but ...’ tears sprang to his eyes.
‘Cas, you’ve got your real family right here.’ He reached out to pull Cas into a hug. After a brief moment of resistance Cas gave in. They stood there for a few moments.
He hasn’t heard from Cas in months. Filming in Honduras finished the year before. Meg came home, but Castiel didn’t. The gossip rags are reporting a messy breakup and Castiel in rehab. Dean knows that isn’t true, the last he heard Cas was off to a retreat in Nepal with no connection to the outside world. Even before he disappeared Dean was only hearing from Cas every few months. Sam heard more often. They had a longer standing relationship Dean supposed.
