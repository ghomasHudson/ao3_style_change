John stretched his body as he flexed his arms and slowly fluttered his eyes, dragging out the moment before he opened them fully.  That dream had been the most realistic thing he had ever felt.  Even now his body felt sated and relaxed and he could still almost feel Sherlock’s body resting against his…  Wait, what?  Sherlock?  He thought back over the last few moments of his dream when he had realised whom it was he was actually dreaming about.  It had been Sherlock, not Mary, whom he had been picturing giving him head – and it had been the best orgasm he had ever had, too.  What was that about?  He wasn’t gay!  He didn’t think about Sherlock that way – he had a girlfriend, for God’s sake.
Sherlock pushed Greg up the bed until his head was on the pillow then turned him on his side with his back to John.  John got into place behind him and Sherlock slid down the bed until he was curled up with his head resting on his arm and Greg’s cock right in front of him.  Sherlock licked the bead of pre-come that had gathered in Greg’s slit and stroked his fingers gently up and down the shaft as John lifted Greg’s leg and positioned himself ready.
“No, he didn’t say anything to me?  He only told me to text him back when I found what he wanted; that was it.”
John woke first to a sensation of warmth down the front of his body.  He opened his eyes to see Sherlock fast asleep, pressed tightly against him, head wedged into the crook of John’s shoulder where it rested against the bed.  He lay still, not wanting to wake Sherlock, knowing how little sleep he usually got.  He watched Sherlock breathing, holding back a chuckle as he watched his own pyjama pocket ruffling and billowing as Sherlock released each breath against it.
'Oh,' the merchant continued, 'nothing dramatic or lachrymose. Both my father and my mother died before I could form memories of them. The first memory I have is the city of Mellom in the north - I was four, I think - and an old merchant took me under his protective wing. I’ve been travelling since that day, so you might say I have no fixed origins. But I’ve been here for a while, so you might say I’m more of a Zuali than anything else.’
'I didn't. A woman gave them to me. I don't know her name - she has a stand up there, about five minutes from here.'
Holmes eventually stood up, ‘Too much going on lately, uh? A birthday party, a quarrel, and that unfortunate accident with your notes.’
He was curious. He couldn't deny that. That merchant had an eerie influence on him and John had to admit that he was fascinated by him. Yet fascinated wasn't the right word. It was a mixture of curiosity, interest, fascination and fear. Curiosity because he was different from any other person John had ever met. Interest because Sherlock seemed to know more than he disclosed. Fascination because it was like being under a spell: being able to see the person but not quite able to get the whole picture. Fear because he could still be the enemy, a spy sent to check on his every movement or, worse, an assassin sent to kill him.
. If I have to sell a product I need to know my clients' tastes. If you come from the north you're unlikely to buy furs and potions to ignite fire quickly, right?'
John laughed as he remembered how, ages ago, he had made fun of Mary for her way of eating half of the words when talking.
John barely raised his gaze to look at the First Knight. He was too intent on staring at the black piece of marble before his eyes. Purple, yellow and red danced in blurred patterns on the cold stone, giving a sparkle of life where only death existed.
John writhed under Holmes’s strokes. In the deepest recess of his mind he was well aware it was all wrong, but Holmes’s thumb slowly circling the head of his cock, pressing on the tip, silenced that voice.
It tore John's heart apart. His mind navigated through all the memories of Mary he had: the midsummer celebration when they had met, the winter solstice when their union was approved, the spring equinox when they had finally married, the birth of their daughter only three months before. The daughter who was now sleeping curled into Lady Hudson's arms, unaware that the world has just become a darker place for her, for her father and for everyone else in the kingdom.
Holmes brought his right index finger to his mouth and pushed it in slowly. He sucked it, then parted his lips and let it slide over his lower lip, sticking his tongue out to circle it before running it down his chin, down to his neck and to his chest until it met his nipple. Holmes traced the contour of the pink dot on his skin with his fingertip, then pinched the nipple between his index and his thumb, never diverting his eyes from John.
Perhaps it was their glimmering in the dim-lit room, perhaps it was just John’s imagination, but he felt both comfortable and uncomfortable in looking at them.
John took a deep breath. He knew that Lady Hudson didn't mean any harm. And yes, he knew that Mary would have liked it. He was simply tired. Tired of hearing condolences, tired of hearing apologies, tired of hearing panegyrics, tired of everything.
‘Sick,’ John spat out. ‘Utterly sick. You are sick, and this is against all rules!’ he thumped the table, so hard his knuckles became instantly red.
'You lost your wife, my Lord,' she continued, 'but I lost my dearest friend. And I'll always feel guilty for not having been here, fighting by her side.'
'Pardon my insolence, my Lord, but why are you so concerned about my identity? Is it, perhaps, because of Mary wanting to go and meet the man herself?'
The journey, despite his fears, had so far been smooth. He had crossed the western borders of his kingdom three weeks earlier, had gone through the marshland of the Avalanii's Territories and had finally reached the Zuali Kingdom, the last Kingdom before the endless expanse of the Great Desert. The Zuali Kingdom stretched from the Ocean in the north to the Mountain Territories in the south, from the Great Desert in the west to the Avalanii's Territories in the east.
John looked around to see if someone had sent him a message. From the corner of his eyes he registered Holmes tapping swiftly on his mobile, and he flinched on his chair as Holmes’s raised his eyes and smirked at him. A second message arrived.
Apparently, I managed to write this whole chapter down sooner than I thought, and, since I'll be overwhelmed by work today and tomorrow (as I have already mentioned), I thought to post it this morning, so I can worry about writing the next one (which I haven't started yet ç_ç). Nevertheless, enjoy this one! (And enjoy my not-procrastination until it lasts ;))
The merchant raised his eyes from the book. 'You know I can speak the Common Tongue quite well, right?'
John hated the roses. He had always hated them. When he was seven or eight he had fallen into his mother's rose garden, and it had taken four servants and a thousand of screams to get rid of all the thorns pierced into his skin. At eleven he had eaten - it had been his older sister's doing - a poisonous berry from a rosebush and had almost died. And now roses surrounded the black sarcophagus of his deceased wife.
He was still debating when his eyes fell on the corner opposite him. Alone at one table near a stained-glass window sat a figure that looked familiar to John.
.' She fiddled with her pocket and extracted a yellowish piece of paper folded in four. She handed it to John. 'If you don't believe me.'
The woman nodded. 'We were friends,' she said. 'We grew up together. My father was her father's right-hand man. It felt natural that I became her right-hand woman.'
Warning: Sherlock keeps being manipulative. The scenes depicted here are on the edge of non-consent. You've been warned!
‘Halls still noisy?’ the professor asked, and dragged a chair to John's desk, sitting opposite to him.
The three acolytes encircled the sarcophagus, one at the top and two at the bottom, the vertexes of an imaginary triangle. They rose their torches up in the air and started singing the Funeral Hymn.
John somehow managed to turn off his mobile, but turned it on seconds later. Two new messages were already waiting for him.
.  I firmly believed that the man called Khuzarku is the legendary Dragon Master and came back to communicate it to Mary - sorry, the Queen.'
Alahar Market, a chaotic labyrinth of narrow alleys, multi-coloured stands and endless chattering, stood in the western - and oldest - part of Ossabella. Whitewashed houses that had been standing for the last five centuries ran along the streets. On them, oriel windows lined with blue stained glass reflected the bright sun and created soft plays of light on the opposite buildings.
'I'll come to the point,' she said. 'About seven weeks ago I reached the western border before the Great Desert. There is a village there - although it is more a mass of four or five huts swept by the desert wind - where the legend of the Dragon Master seems to permeate their culture. They have stories, folktales, and religious habits: all about the
First of all: thank you for all your amazing kudos! I'm overwhelmed by your lovely response to this fic that came out from my insomnia.
The halls were eerily quiet, and John had no excuses for not to be working on his essay. No excuses whatsoever. Yet, every time he opened a book or researched a website, Holmes’s text messages came to his mind. He had wanked another time that afternoon, as soon as he had got out of Holmes’s lecture. It was sick, he knew it, and he kept repeating it in his head, like a mantra.
Half past ten on Wednesday evening and John was sitting on his bed with a bunch of notes on paper surrounding him. He rhythmically tapped the silvery surface of his laptop’s keyboard, aware that he was not going anywhere with the essay.
‘That’s because you are a genius and Holmes has nothing against you,’ John said, and the sentence made him think of what Holmes had actually against him. Considering the last two days, perhaps less than John believed. Or, since Holmes was an all-round bastard, maybe those
'The Grange was lost on purpose,' Lady Donovan said, 'in order to save Alabaria. Queen Mary's strategy.'
John gaped in amazement, but a hint of suspicion crossed his mind. Was the man a spy? Had he been following John?
And soon they had four dragons flying in the sky destroying everything they fancied to destroy. War and dragons. If it weren't his daily reality, John would think he was five again, listening to his old nanny's stories beside the fire.
John shivered, but it wasn't for fear. Holmes's voice had an undeniable power over him. It was deep, and warm, and, if whispered that close, breath tickling his skin, somehow erotic. Wait, had he just associated the word erotic to his professor?
'Ah, that,' the merchant said. 'It's the same. Your Common Tongue also shows signs of the Laudinum's dialect.'
'Nice,' the man said. 'I'll take this.' He grabbed the bowl and paid Sherlock as if twelve dinars were breadcrumbs. 'See you tonight,' he said turning his back and walking away.
Now he was speaking with a woman who sold strange brown fruits she called datil. She offered him one, again with the same: 'Sherlock's friends are my friends.'
He silently ate the first bit of pork; the taste was a perfect match to its aspect: horrible, like old shoes with a hint of smoked wood. He looked at the drink in the cup and wondered whether drinking it would actually improve or worsen everything.
But nothing happened. No ‘click’ of the opening door, no familiar steps, nothing. Outside the window, only the wind blew. Five past midnight, and John thought about leaving. Ten past midnight, and John was still sitting on the chair staring at the black hours on the clock face. Fifteen past midnight, and John really believed it was time to go. Twenty past midnight, and John pretended to read the book. Twenty-five past midnight, and John was definitely ready to leave. Thirty past midnight, and a blast of wind announced the door had just been opened.
Nobody can resist two days of that slop.' The man raised his hand and snapped his fingers. 'Angelo!’
Ok. That was new. He had not a ready-made answer to that. He made it up, hoping it didn't sound as fake as it sounded in his head.
'Just shut up, Tahla,' Sherlock said, his voice strangely relaxed. 'I know nothing. It's just gossip going around.'
He stood still while Holmes’s left hand travelled downward and lifted his jumper, slipping underneath on John’s warm skin, unable to understand what was happening; he stood still while Holmes bent his head and started kissing him, slow, wet, hot kisses tracing the mandibular bone, the side of his trachea, his Adam’s apple; and he stood still when Holmes’s right hand left the neck of his jumper and found his nipple, toying with it. John moaned.
‘I will,’ and he reached his mobile in his jeans pocket, his hand shaking violently. ‘I’ve got the messages you sent me. The dean will be horrified, and you will be fired,’ John announced as steadily as he could, stretching out his arm and shoving his mobile under Holmes’s nose.
'He's near Tahla's stand, just down there,' she said and pointed to her right. 'Go down the street. Five minutes from here. He's on the left side.'
The innkeeper, a sturdy man with a thick moustache, gave him a bowl with what looked like pork drowning in a slimy red sauce.
. And everyone had believed these lies until a bloody dragon - yes, with wings and teeth and scales and what else - had materialised out of nowhere in the kingdom's skies. The only difference he could find between the supposedly mythological creatures and the dragons they were dealing with was the lack of fire coming out of their nostrils and mouths. Not that this
John noticed Holmes could type on his keyboard without looking at it. So he continued staring at John while tapping furiously on the mobile.
‘Are you staring at something in particular, Watson?’ Holmes asked, as though it were an innocent question.
John took a deep breath, ‘Yes. They were,’ he angrily replied, not able to hold it any longer. ‘And I'd like to continue my work right now, if you want it on your desk on Friday.’ He had lost it, but he felt as if a heavy burden had just been removed from his heart.
about the man's existence and come back if I had any lead. The orders were never to find him personally.'
H bit her lips and was evidently uncomfortable. But she looked straight into John's eyes and said, 'The Queen wanted to go to him by herself. That's why my task ended with proving his existence.
John swallowed as Holmes freed his cock and pushed it against his still-shut mouth. Holmes bent downward and caressed John’s cheek, brushing the tip of his thumb on John’s lower lip, then he also sat on his knees. He looked at John and buried his head under John’s chin, licking his way to John’s ear. John moaned in pleasure, and Holmes took advantage of it by pushing his thumb inside John’s mouth. John unconsciously closed his eyes and sucked it, his tongue moving fast as Holmes pushed it farther and farther down the throat.
John was well beyond the line that separated his patience and his anger. He huffed and continued on his road, leaving the merchant and his pottery behind.
staring now,’ and he unbuttoned the second, ‘I can’, and the third was done, ‘relax a bit,’ and he unbuttoned the fourth, and he stopped to push the two sides of the shirt apart, exposing his white skin and his nipples. Pink, round, hard nipples.
The image of Greg's pleading eyes, he knew, would accompany his nightmares - along with a black sarcophagus - for the rest of his life.
From the farthest - and darkest - corner, a figure moved, making John and the other two knights start.
John couldn't help but stare. The mess of black curls was slightly damp, as if Holmes had just showered and had had no time to dry them properly, and a small crystal drop had found its way down Holmes's neck. John followed it going down, and down, and down until it was hidden by the shirt. A purple shirt. Purple and, again, tight beyond any possible reason.
'It sweetens things,' the merchant explained and grabbed a small pot on the table's side that John hadn't noticed until now. He took out a small wooden spoon with a granular substance that looked like sand. 'This is
John couldn't care less about the starlit sky and the ancestors. If he had to fight a horde of dead corpses and a bunch of galaxies to get Mary back, he would have. Oh, surely he would.
John swallowed. He and Holmes didn't quite get along. He was under the impression he had been under Holmes's magnifying glass since the day he had stepped in his classroom. Holmes observed him. Truth be told, Holmes had a habit of observing people, but only John, of all, had had the guts of standing against him. It had been a glorious day for John - he had been called a hero - but Holmes had not taken it lightly. And for John life had become a bit of a nightmare. And being up at midnight in the library doing the essay Holmes would read didn't probably increase Holmes's opinion about him.
'When did you revert to monosyllabic conversation?' the merchant said, sneering. 'Yes, he likes you. Quite rare. He doesn't usually like people who aren't useful to him.'
‘Do not grin,’ Holmes commanded and forced all his length down John’s throat, making him cough and spit.
He wished to say that he loved Rosa deeply. He wished to. But he felt like an invisible wall had been suddenly built between him and his daughter when Mary died. As much as he tried to reach to his daughter, he could only see her as a reflection of Mary's lost beauty. And it killed his heart in more ways than he thought possible.
The man was intent on reading a book, bent slightly forward on the pages, right elbow resting on the table, right hand playing with a curl which fell on the forehead.
Holmes’s grin grew wider, ‘You did your homework. Good boy.’ With the fingers of his right hand still wrapped around John’s wrist, Holmes returned a few centimetres away from John, their chests almost touching, and whispered, ‘And do you know who he is?’
They stayed in silence opposite one another, fighting a wordless battle against the sadness that raged inside their hearts.
The man's face was still near John's ear. He could feel every single gust of breath, warm breath, on his midnight-cold skin, ‘Good, Watson. Good.’
, Watson,’ he whispered, hot puffs of air on John’s lobe. Holmes’s wet tongue trailed John’s helix, and he couldn’t help but letting out a moan, which he tried to stifle when it was already too late.
Holmes picked up one of John’s books and started leafing through it. He didn't seem deeply interested in it. He just looked at one page, possibly read some random words, and went to the next page. The whole process, however, involved a good amount of finger-licking. To turn the pages, Holmes didn't simply wet the tip of his index, he stuck his tongue out and slowly - painstakingly slowly - slid the finger on it. The gesture was always followed by the tip of Holmes's tongue passing over his upper lip, and by a small bite of the lower one. It was practically watching foreplay in porn.
In the light of day, John noticed, the merchant seemed slightly different. Gone were the otherworldly features which had struck John so much the previous evening. A white turban covered the black wild hair, leaving just one rebellious curl fall down the merchant's cheek, and the eyes, lined with black makeup, had lost their strange glimmering.
H stood motionless. 'My Lord, Mary loved you,' she said, almost a whisper. 'But she loved her people too. And she didn't want you or her subjects to suffer. That's why she wanted to go herself. That's why she wanted to leave and look for the man
John had never met the informant before. He was part of Mary’s closed circle of people who answered to her and her only. He had heard of 'H' anyway, the most trusted of them all, the man who always brought back the most salient information, the man of impossible missions. He had, long time ago, been rather jealous of the relationship between the mysterious H and his wife, but Mary had dismissed his concerns with laughter.
John went straight to the door and called the others back in. He had just made a decision. A decision nobody would like.
John swallowed. He hadn't expected the question. No, that was a lie. He had dreaded it from the very beginning. He had the answer. He had painstakingly invented a perfectly plausible answer. But until now he had kept away from any company and had never had to tell anyone. And he felt slightly upset he had to suddenly lie. Not that he had any other choice.
Despite all John’s willpower, he felt like he had run a marathon. He was short of breath and his heart pounded loudly in his chest, his mouth was dry and the palms of his hands were sweaty.
To John it felt like walking inside one of those exotic tales his nanny used to read him. Those in which a princess with black, silky hair ran away with a thief; or those in which a prince, tired of his life, decided to become a merchant and travel the world.
Despite his fears, John had to admit the lecture was extremely interesting. As always, Holmes’s knowledge of the subject proved to be exceptional. In that perspective, John and the others couldn’t complain about Holmes. It was just Holmes’s human side that made them cringe. More than once people had come out of his office crying uncontrollably, and John’s defence of the poor Hannah – who had been openly insulted by Sherlock because she lacked any training in Latin – was the reason John had lost Holmes’s favour.
John licked and sucked, his neglected hardness leaking hot come as Holmes pounded John’s mouth harder and harder. His rhythm was steady: he held John’s head strongly, pulled it towards his groin, and bucked his hips forward at the same time, until he lost it. John felt Holmes’s cock twitch on his tongue, and Holmes’s hands pulled his hair. He came in hot spurts into John’s mouth, down John’s throat. He didn’t pull away until the last drop was spilled and his cock softened.
Now that he had finally reached Ossabella, the capital city, he was having the umpteenth discussion about food with a woman. Her Common Tongue was broken and he had a hard time understanding what she was saying, but the heart of the matter was always the same: she didn't want
But again the merchant echoed, 'It's useless. The moment she'll turn around the corner, you'll lose her.'
'She is with her ancestors now,' the High Priest said to him. 'Her accomplishments on this earth will shine forever in the starlit sky.'
John turned to see a merchant sitting under the shadow of his tent. Pots of different sizes and colours lay scattered on an old, consumed rag spread open midway across the street.
The innkeeper immediately looked in their direction. How it was possible that he heard the call in such a noisy room was beyond John’s comprehension.
The merchant turned to the innkeeper and said something quickly. The innkeeper nodded, took John's bowl and disappeared.
Holmes probably read John’s mind and let his head fall back, his neck arched and the protuberance of his Adam’s apple was thus fully on display. His black curls fell softly on the pale skin of his shoulders, while his hands moved up and down his torso, caressing the muscles on his belly, pinching the nipples or rubbing them in circles.
The merchant didn’t move a finger during John’s talk, contenting himself with staring at John's every movement, seemingly weighing each of John’s words on an invisible scale.
'It will be a long wait,' the merchant added. 'He's never here before mid-afternoon, so, please, do come under the tent if you don't want to boil under the sun.'
John realised he had a stupid expression on his face because the merchant had the smuggest grin ever.
The man was huge. Huge in a sense John could not describe with words. He was tall, taller than any man John knew. Even taller - if his memory wasn't playing tricks on him - than his friend Norstorm, a huge guy who was almost twice as tall as John. And he was round, a peculiar breed between an elephant, a fat hippopotamus and a rhinoceros. His arms - both of the dimensions of a sheep - swung around his massive body like lethal weapons swung on the hips of a hitman. His steps seemed to make the ground shake.
But promises are promises, and here comes the new chapter (we are half-way through the story, hurrah!). I'm actually working on the fourth, which I hope will be ready soon (can't promise it will be ready tomorrow because it's quite long, and tomorrow and Friday will be busy days). Be patient ;)
John had more or less decided he was going to ask Sherlock out for a proper date.  He just had to get his nerve up to put his plan into action.  He had a few doubts about going ahead, his main one being that he didn’t want to risk ruining the friendship they already had and his second being why on earth would Sherlock be interested in him of all people when he could have anyone he wanted.
“Calm down!  How am I supposed to calm down?  My best friend has only been lying to me and I’ve been walking round like a zombie for weeks having nightmares whilst he’s swanning around having fun without me.”
"Sorry, was that too much?  Didn't you like it?  Should I stop?  I should stop.  Did you not want to kiss?  I took it too far, didn't I?  I spoiled everything.  Why..."
How did I do?  Are you tearing this letter up as we speak, never to darken my letter box with another comment?  I will wait and see if I receive a reply.  If I don’t I will know your opinion and you don’t need to worry about me bothering you again.
Sherlock’s expression froze for a moment before he blinked quickly.  Was he really going to be able to listen to all those messages John had left for him?  His hand shot out, palm open towards Mycroft who raised an eyebrow and stared back at him.
“We’ve re-painted the living room wall we had to better match the era we needed but we do still need to paint a winter scene to put behind the window.  The doors were all painted before we left for the holidays so they should just need a soft soap and varnishing then we’re pretty much sorted as well.”
“It seems you’ve been holding back all this time.  What other skills do you have that I should know about?”
“The others should be here soon.  Sally was just sorting the photocopying which she and Anderson had done so the scripts should be ready.  I wanted to give everyone their own copy right away so they could get started on learning their lines; the sooner we’re off book the easier it’ll be to work on the staging.  She should be here in a minute.”
Mycroft stayed still for a few seconds, watching John with narrowed eyes; clearly reading far more into John’s reaction than he wanted to reveal.  Mycroft obviously decided not to force the issue because he gave a small nod, turned, and left, closing the door quietly behind him.
“What do you know about this operation – is it dangerous?  I’ve been speaking to Billy, one of Sherlock’s homeless network, and he said he’s been trying to contact Sherlock for four days now with information he was asked to track down and he’s had no reply.  Do you think Sherlock is just incommunicado as you suggested or could something have happened?”
Molly blushed at the praise, she had been generally shy in front of him since Sherlock had joined their group, taking time to get used to him, but she was slowly coming in to her own and relaxing more with him as she did with John and Mike.
“That’s what I thought I was reading from you, but we’ve been sharing a bed for almost a week and you haven’t made a single move towards me.”
John joined in.  "He's right, mate, you're really good.  That was a pretty heroic thing you did back there"
John blushed and laughed, punching Sherlock on the arm.  “He’s such a kidder.  I’m just introducing him to it, trying to broaden his horizons.”
Simon backed away quickly, the others rapidly going after him, and all Sherlock could do was stare at John in awe.
John smiled as he kissed Sherlock’s forehead.  He knew that Sherlock loved being wrapped around John, listening to his heart beating until he let the soothing rhythm lull him to sleep.
“He… he will be happy to see me, though, won’t he?” Sherlock seemed unsure all of a sudden on hearing of the anticipated shock.  He realised he hadn’t actually spoken to anyone about anything genuine in the whole time he’d been away. He’d succumbed to the necessary evil of generalised chit-chat with people with whom he’d been forced to interact whilst undercover, but none of it had related to himself.  Now it was hitting home that he could finally be himself again and how that may impact on the people back home.
John laughed as Sherlock pouted.  He bent down and sucked that gorgeous lip between his own and nibbled on it gently.  He placed small kisses all over Sherlock’s face whilst he oiled up his hands again and started massaging Sherlock’s arms. He mercifully avoided any tickling motions, pressing harder into the under arm areas on the downward swipes, allowing Sherlock’s muscles to relax instead of tensing up.
Sherlock grinned.  “Now, that is a pleasant conundrum.  I am yours to do with as you will, Dr Watson.”
John put everything carefully back in its assigned place in the case and closed it up, putting it on the floor beside him.  He screwed up all the wrapping paper and pushed it into the box which had contained the skull.  Then he reached forward and curled his finger under Sherlock's collar.
"I don't know exactly how he does it, I haven't had to do that myself yet, but just know that he can.  So at this stage you can choose to just have Sherlock make you forget before we go any further and you can take our statements from the crime scene and be on your way.  Or you can hear the explanation now and still have the option to have the memory removed if you don't want to know what you will know."
“You are to me,” Sherlock smiled at him shyly.  “They always tell me I’ll never have any friends and certainly not a boyfriend.  I can even put up with the fact that they’re bound to go on about me changing schools again if I’ve got you there with me.”
“Brilliant.  Come with me to the casting session tomorrow then and I’ll speak to Greg about something for you too.  He’s in the year above us and he plays prop half on the rugby team with me; you’ve probably seen him.”
At John’s admission, Sherlock felt able to admit that he, also, had enjoyed himself.  He had really missed John in the last three weeks.  He had got used to having a faithful companion by his side; someone with whom to do experiments and go exploring and while away, the otherwise far too boring, hours in the day.  He didn’t begrudge John having other friends – well, he told himself he didn’t - but it had scared him to see John becoming so absorbed in someone else.  He probably hadn’t reacted very well by refusing to see him as he’d made the situation even worse; seeing even less of John than if he’d been off on occasional dates.
I got in touch with that Sergeant and he let me come down to a crime scene he was working on.  He wouldn’t let me behind the tape but he showed me some photos of the scene and I was able to point out something that his team had missed and lead him towards the correct person to interrogate.  He texted me afterwards to say that they had confessed and that I was right again so I think he is on board with allowing me more access which is very exciting.
He sucked up and down John’s shaft a few times, licking in to the slit on each up-stroke, tasting the droplets gathered there and enjoying watching John who was almost constantly moaning now.  On the next pass he took a deep breath again and when he reached the base he hummed in his deepest tone and swallowed around John’s shaft.  Before John even had time to pull back and warn him, Sherlock found himself swallowing rapidly as John came straight down his throat, shouting and grabbing his hair as he released.  John’s heels banged against the bed as his legs shuddered as he tried not to thrust his pelvis any further forward as Sherlock already had a mouthful and was taking as much as he could.
“I… I have never before had an interest in such things but, as with everything else about him, John has proved to be the exception.  He saved my life on the day after I met him and called me an idiot and he hasn’t stopped saving me since.  The whole time I’ve been away he has been the voice of conscience in my head and at the root of the yearning for my return.”
“Hey, don’t do that.  You don’t have to be embarrassed about it.  You won’t believe the state I was in when Sherlock first did it to me.”
Eventually they got to the Holmes mansion and Mycroft’s men carried John in and took him to the master bedroom.  They cleaned him up, got him changed into pyjamas and put him into bed, leaving him in Sherlock’s care.  It would take 24 hours for the transformation to occur so there was nothing to do now but wait.
I hope this has put your mind at ease that I will not cease in corresponding.  I have also endeavoured to cheer you along with something I trust you will enjoy so I hope it reaches you in good condition.  I pointed out to the owner that her new hire was pocketing the cost of one in three of the orders he was taking and she was most grateful and more than happy to make you a special one all of your own.
"Someone had to stay to make sure you were okay.  If anyone kicks up a fuss we can just say I sat up awake in the chair all night, they'll believe me capable of it."
He made his way out to the rugby pitch.  It wasn't somewhere he'd ever been before but he was willing to make this exception for John.  The boys were just coming out of the changing rooms as he arrived and he saw John joking with a couple of others as they ran down towards the pitch.  John’s eyes were scanning the field as he came across and his face lit up when he saw Sherlock standing to one side.  He grinned and nodded to him and Sherlock bobbed his head slightly back to acknowledge that he’d seen him.
Sherlock was analysing the taste of imaginary-John within his mouth.  This was so realistic – his superior intellect had obviously fashioned a perfect analytical dream for him.  This was just the sort of input he found fascinating.  He wished he could have kept some to put on a slide.  He would love to study this under his microscope and see John’s sperm in action.  He could do a comparison with a sample of his own and examine motility and do a full sperm count to see who was more virile.  He had no doubt the answer would be John.  He was sure his would be more intelligent, of course, but John was definitely the more physical specimen.
“Yes, and what do they know about anything; they who use their brains so infrequently and think so little.”
“Well, possibly; I’ll have to think about that one, but for now, is there anything you would like to declare as being off limits?”
The paramedics came in then and Sherlock told them everything he had observed about John’s injuries, including that he had been injected with an unknown substance.  They carefully lifted him on to the stretcher and wheeled him out to the ambulance.  Sherlock followed after him, not wanting to leave John alone and he climbed in the back and sat beside John, his hand resting lightly on John’s leg whilst he let the paramedic work around him.
“Yes, but how could you see all the things he described?  He said you could tell a pilot by his left thumb, how is that possible?” Martin wiggled his thumb as he spoke.
“Don’t be absurd!”  He picked up his phone and called his brother, hearing a deep sigh as the phone was answered.
John started laughing and Sherlock quickly joined in.  This was what he had missed; the comfortable camaraderie and honest friendship that John had always offered him.  He had never had that with anyone else and he was perfectly happy with that being a fact.  What did he need anyone else for when he had John?
Sherlock shook his head, trying to dislodge all the questions whirling around.  He could do nothing until he was actually home.  He needed to get home right now and it was going to take him forever.  He was in a little, no-name town which didn’t have a station in the middle of Europe.  So he would need to get a taxi to the nearest larger town with a station so he could get a train (which only ran twice a day here) to the capital which contained the nearest airport.  Then he had to decide if he wanted to risk using his current passport.  It was in the name of his latest identity which was the one he had used when working in the factory so it would be on the staff roster that would now be in the hands of Interpol.
Sherlock looked pleased as he laughed.  "Fair enough.  Maybe we'll start on resisting the blood tomorrow."
“I wish you could come with me, John.  I hate having to spend so much time with my family.  I always thought Mycroft was bad enough, but even he pales into insignificance in comparison to the rest of them.”
He grabbed the handle and gave a weird sort of wave as he went out and closed the door behind him, just as Sherlock was still halfway through a sentence.
Sherlock sighed and settled himself back down leaning on John again.  After sending off a quick text to Lestrade, he pulled John's arm over his chest and managed to get his head under John's other hand, nudging it to let John know that he wanted his hair stroked.  He had a very sensitive scalp and loved the way John ran his fingers through it.
Sherlock cuffed him on the head, “I know that, fool.  I just want to try something first.”  Sherlock held his wrist up to John’s mouth.
John looked at himself in the mirror – well, not quite as good as a James Bond tuxedo, but certainly not far off.  He was very pleased with the result and happily followed Mycroft in to the next room to meet the team with whom he would be working that night.  They spent the day getting everything set up and giving John a run through of all the codes they would be using and how the operation would be run.  It was all fairly standard, and nothing John hadn’t done before.
John jumped up and rushed across to Sherlock, lifting his body against the wall with one hand whilst he grabbed his cock with the other.  Sherlock gasped in surprise as John went straight in and swallowed him down, holding him in his throat.  As he'd been kissing Sherlock John had remembered how it felt to have Sherlock do this to him without needing to stop to breathe and he knew he just had to try it.
"Of course, my idea is the best.  Greg is a mature, intelligent adult and deserves to make his own decision."
As Sherlock spun John round he saw the moment when she slipped the small flash drive into Jenkins top pocket under cover of brushing some lint off his collar.  He locked eyes with Mycroft, who clearly had reached the same conclusions about the woman as had his brother.  With no words necessary, only subtle eye movements, they established that Mycroft would deal with the wife and Sherlock would take Jenkins.
John carefully shuffled across the bed so he was lying in the middle with his head on the pillow to allow Sherlock access all around him.  He spread his arms wide and gestured down his body.
Sherlock stood frozen; his eyes staring blankly ahead.  The phone was held to his ear without a single sound being made until the answerphone machine clicked off, and the continuous note of the dial tone sounded, indicating a person should hang up.  Still, Sherlock just stood there.
John snuggled a bit closer to his pillow, enjoying the warmth against his skin.  It felt a little harder than normal but the gentle movement up and down was restful.  Moving up and down?  What was he on about?  Was he dreaming about a boat?  No; his pillow was definitely moving and he could hear a steady beat under his ear too.  Almost sounded like a heartbeat.  It was a heartbeat.  Oh hell; where was he now?  He hadn’t gone home with someone had he?
Sherlock grabbed on to the arm which had just hit his own.  “I think you’ll find you aren’t going anywhere.”  His mobile phone pinged a text alert noise in his pocket.  “Well, I’ll retract that statement and say you aren’t going anywhere without me.  If that is Mycroft finally announcing his arrival then I suggest we leave immediately and go somewhere where these people are not.”
“I thought that Sherlock was dead, that’s what I thought.  How was I supposed to think anything else – he jumped off a bloody roof!”  John shouted, banging his clenched fists against his sides.
She shook her head as John started to apologise again and flicked her fingers in a ‘shoo’ gesture at him.  John leant forward and kissed her on the cheek before moving out from behind the table, grinning in anticipation as he left.  He watched as she turned to chat to their other friends, a resigned but still happy smile on her face.  The maturity from her well-travelled lifestyle shone through and she was determined to enjoy the evening despite not spending it with John.  Knowing that she would be okay, John dismissed everything else from his mind as he turned to look over at the only person in whom he was really interested.
“What do you propose then?  I suppose I could see if Mme Lapion has a camp bed we could set up in the corner instead of using a chair.”
“Sure, it’ll be great fun.  I used to help Mr Johnson, the woodwork teacher, clean up afterwards when I was taking his class so I’m sure he’d be willing to supply us with some off-cuts and let us use the school equipment for sawing and planing.  I’m quite good at dovetail joints.  Did you ever do woodwork in any of your other schools?”
“Sherlock!”  John burst out laughing.  “You shouldn’t offer something which you are unprepared to provide.”
They started watching a James Bond film, one of John’s favourites, which Sherlock tolerated only because he knew how much John liked them.  Very soon afterwards Sherlock was relieved to see John’s shoulders relaxing and they settled in to their regular routine of watching the film and flicking pieces of popcorn into the other’s mouth to see who could catch the most.  Sherlock usually won as John had a dead-shot aim and John always tried to claim that the win should be his for hitting the target most frequently.
Sherlock turned his head to capture John’s lips.  After a long drawn out kiss, John had to take a moment to marshal his thoughts again.
“So, that seems a bit unusual for brothers to sign up together; especially when it seems incomprehensible that either of you can be short of opportunities looking as you do.”
In fact there wasn’t anything about this week that I didn’t like.  You are everything I could ask for in a friend or a boyfriend and I shall be counting down the days until I have leave again and can be with you.  I’m going to post this at the station so you will get it as soon as possible so that you realise exactly what spending time with you has meant to me.
Sherlock seemed to have no interest in relationships and had not dated anyone in the entire time they had been together.  He was also known to spit the word ‘sentiment’ out with great disgust so John didn’t hold out much hope that any feelings he might have would be shared.  John was sharply feeling the lack of any partner at the moment as Sherlock had been most adept at halting any of his dates at an early stage.  He had been looking forward to a good old grouse with his mates and a chance to drown his sorrows.  Fat chance of that now.
John’s senses were on high alert.  The hairs on the back of his neck were standing on end and it was almost as if he could feel the presence of Sherlock.  He had no way of knowing how or why he just instinctively knew they were going to find something here.
Sherlock reached up and slid his fingers along the waistband, teasing at the skin of John’s abdomen.  John groaned as Sherlock touched him there and his hand convulsively gripped on to Sherlock’s shoulder as he pulled the material down and uncovered John’s cock.  Sherlock just looked at it for a few moments, examining it from all sides.
John followed Mycroft out to his car and they headed back to his office.  He hoped that Mycroft’s team might have found out some useful information in their absence.
Jasmine sat down at this point, and was stunned enough in her shock, to allow Stacey to come over and put her arm around her.
“Speaking of sharing oneself,” Sherlock smiled to lighten the mood and rotated his hips, brushing his cock against the very obvious bulge in John’s trousers.  “One of us appears to be seriously overdressed in this partnership.”
When the Drama Club announced their next play was going into production though, Sherlock once again realised that the rehearsals were going to sap time away when he could be with John.  He had already decided to sign up to be part of the backstage crew; not wanting to go to the effort of putting on a performance but still wanting to be around John whilst he was spending his evenings rehearsing.  He had yet to inform John of the fact.  He thought that allowing himself to be talked into the venture would earn him points with John and show the other boy that he listened to his ideas.  He was still learning his way in this 'friends' thing but he was trying at least and John appreciated his efforts.
The final dress rehearsal went badly, but everyone assured each other that a bad dress rehearsal was a good thing, as that meant the performance, itself, was sure to be a hit.  It had just been lots of silly things.  Freddie had completely dried and forgotten his lines when he had been talking to John just after he had arrived.  Luckily, John had taken it in his stride and, after including part of Freddie’s line in with his own, Freddie had recovered enough to carry on.  One of the props they’d needed hadn’t been put back in the right place at the end of the previous session, and Anderson had told Sherlock off, in supposed mutters, backstage.  This had been clearly heard front of house and put Oliver off his speech.  Needless to say, Sherlock had clearly pointed out that it had been Anderson who had moved the prop, when he had been mooning over Sally before they’d left the night before, and, of course, he was proved correct.  Anderson had sloped off in a sulk, knocking into the back of one of the doors on stage.  That had forced it open so that it nearly trapped the hand of Natalie, who had been standing behind it at the time.  Matthew had dropped his skis as he’d arrived, and he and Freddie had banged heads as they’d both bent down at the same time to pick them up.  They’d both been fine afterwards, but it was another hold-up to the show which they obviously hoped wouldn’t happen on the night.
Sherlock’s head was rolling from side to side, soft hair now sweaty and matted against his skull, as he tried to find some release from this delicious torture John was putting him through.  He moaned John’s name on a constant loop; or as much of it as he could manage, the end sound being almost broken off each time with a heaving sigh.
Wait a minute – something was wrong with that last thought.  He was going crazy with his pronouns.  He’d somehow shifted from ‘her’ to ‘they’ to ‘his’?  What was going on in this weird dream?  As he felt the pressure building, he decided he didn’t really care at this stage; all he wanted now was to come.  John’s hands tightened in the curls and he helped to push and pull the head as it slid up and down.
Sherlock, of course, took full advantage of the freedom and, on the first few he iced, he piled them high with every decoration going.  Then he got a little more artistic.  He decorated three properly; one for Mummy, one for Father and one for Mrs Hudson, herself.  He’d already decided he was going to have one with everything on for himself and he would send the others to John.  He got out the writing icing and on the next one he drew a picture of a pig and put one pink sugar ball in the centre for its nose.  That one would be for Mycroft.
By the time they’d finished Sherlock had filled several pages of his notebook and John was happy that he’d outlined his role and he was keen to start memorising his lines.  Sherlock left him to it at that stage and John fell asleep with his script drooping in his hand, going over lines in his head.
“Why don’t you give it a go and if you feel uncomfortable we can stop.  It’s so rare that I get an opportunity to dance, and I’ll let you in on a little secret - which I will deny if you mention - that I love dancing.”
"It's a male, probably 70 - 80 when he died, judging by the condition of the teeth.  Practically an omnivore, in fact, as the incisors are hardly worn and there is far more erosion on the lower molars.  No visible injuries, so not a traumatic death.  Not a particularly tall man given the distances between the facial features but hardy.  I would say you got this when you were up in Scotland and it is most likely the skull of a shepherd from the highlands."
“I suppose I should be happy that you’ve at least taken the edge off, both for yourself and for me.  I can see I’m going to need to keep my stamina up to keep pace with you, aren’t I?”
“Good point.  Is there something you’ve always wanted to try that doesn’t involve complicated gymnastics?”
Greg nearly choked on his tea.  John patted him on the back and gave him a minute to recover whilst he looked over at Sherlock.
They made their way to the Nurse’s Office having decided that John would say he had a headache.  This wasn’t far off the truth as he was still feeling a little delicate.  The Nurse had a bit of a soft spot for John as he’d always been interested in the medical side of things and had often helped her out when she’d been checking stock and tidying her cupboards.
Sherlock blushed.  It never got old.  The way John would just hand out praise so readily when anyone else would get mad at him, was always surprising and pleasing.  Sherlock slid his fingers over the exit wound, feeling the differing textures of skin around it.  John twitched and bit his lip.
“You can’t be serious?  You would be willing to work with me, even though I’m no longer able to perform the delicate surgery for which I trained so very hard.  All that work I put in to making myself an accomplished, successful surgeon, so that I would be good enough for you…”  John stuttered to a halt.
John was doing much the same in his own room.  He couldn't believe how the night had ended and how much he had enjoyed himself.  He fell asleep with a smile on his face.
It hadn’t been all smooth sailing, of course.  They had their fights like everyone else; none more so than when Sherlock was ten and John, at thirteen, had got his first girlfriend.  John had taken Trudy Johnson to the local cinema and held hands with her in the back row.  When he got back home he had a big grin on his face.
It was no good.  He couldn’t take the chance of being picked up at the airport and delayed for questioning.  His own passport had obviously been left behind at home as he was supposed to be dead so he didn’t have that to fall back on and he didn’t have any other spares left.  He would have to bite the bullet and make another call – this voice far less pleasant to him than the one he had just enjoyed.
"Hello."  John said with a brief smile.  It was nothing like the ones he usually gave to anyone else he met, Sherlock noticed.
“It already is morning.  This is not anything I would ever regret, however.  In fact, I feel this lockdown is finally good for something and I ought to send a thank you message to your army colleagues for being unable to meet you or we could have unnecessarily ignored this for a whole lot longer.”
The rain had softened the field a little but not enough for them to get stuck luckily.  Once they were all loaded in and he had done the relevant checks, Martin fired her up.  They bumped across the field, having just enough length to get the height for lift -off and they were away.  Martin radioed in to the base and explained their predicament and asked for transportation to meet them at the lake he indicated.
“It seems I’m going to have to leave you now, John.  I’m afraid there’s somewhere else I need to be.”
To answer your question, yes I can delete useless information from my brain.  It frees up space for the important things; it only makes sense for me to keep the information which would be vital to my work and to dispose of anything else.  It only surprises me that other people don’t also find this a useful tool for precise recall.
Sherlock dialled John’s number again and pressed the speaker button.  Luckily John didn’t answer, or that would have upset Sherlock’s plans, and they both listened as the answerphone message played again.  Sherlock still couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing and sat staring at the phone until Martin interrupted.
I have included a photograph for you.  I looked up how to correctly wear a Keffiyeh in the brief slot of heavily censored internet access I was allowed, so I hope I have put it on correctly.  I would obviously need to use make-up to provide a tan to pull off a proper disguise, but I do not have access to any of my usual materials in here.
"Thank you," he said again, quietly, deep sincerity in his eyes.  John smiled at him.  That was what a proper John smile should look like.  Sherlock was happier than he could say, that he seemed to be entitled to stand with this man by his side.  He'd never been more proud.
John spread his legs wider and tried to relax himself.  Sherlock traced his hands up and down John’s thighs, moving further inward on each pass.  When he got to the centre he cupped John’s balls and pulled them down slightly then he took one into his mouth.  John moaned above him, trying desperately to keep his eyes open, wanting to see what Sherlock would do next.  It seemed Sherlock was intent to tease before he actually moved in for the bite.  He wanted John as relaxed as possible so that even the initial puncture wasn’t too painful.
“John, listen to me.  You’ve been dead for 24 hours.  You have no pulse and no breath and no heart beat and the burning in your throat is because you need to feed; you need blood.”
“All I was saying was it is not wise to drink alone.  I would be happy to provide companionship for your evening.”
“Yes, you’ve done really well with that.  You don’t have to worry about going without for anywhere near as long as I do; I am so much older and more experienced after all.  It’ll just make it easier if you’re ever kidnapped again for you to know that you can hold out, though the chances of that happening should be greatly reduced now with your extra strength.”
John slid Sherlock’s coat off, quickly moving on to unfastening the buttons on his shirt.  Sherlock undid his cuffs to help things along and John was soon pushing the shirt off as well.  Sherlock’s skin glowed in the moonlight coming in through John’s window and it caused John to pause his previous frenzy and instead he tenderly traced over the surface, following each trail with his tongue and placing gentle kisses on the moonlit skin.  When John’s tongue traced over the edge of his nipple Sherlock shivered and sucked in a deep breath and as quickly as that it seemed that a switch had been flicked in John and once again he was desperate for anything he could reach.  Where his tongue and lips had been gentle his teeth now sought dominance and John dragged them over the skin, pressing a trail with them and sucking the skin into his mouth, wanting to leave his mark on Sherlock and cover as much of him as he could.
Knowing how much he, himself, had wanted Sherlock to touch more intimate parts of him when the detective had been examining his body during a previous session, John took pity on Sherlock and paid a little attention to his groin as well.  He swept his hand across from hip to hip, massaging the oil in to the skin.  He moved all around Sherlock’s balls, coating them and rolling them in his hands sensuously before he slid his hand in a long stroke up one side of Sherlock’s cock and down the other.  He brought it to full attention, circling the head and dipping his finger into the little droplets gathering in the slit.
They ended up staying at Sherlock’s manor house for just over seven weeks.  John had loved all the alone time with Sherlock and learning about his new abilities without interruptions and would have been quite happy to stay there longer, but he could tell that Sherlock was starting to get a bit antsy to be back in the thick of the action.  He was being very subtle about it for a change as opposed to his usual flouncing around and throwing himself on the sofa like he did at home, but there were just fleeting glimpses of boredom starting to sneak through and John wanted to stave it off before anything more explosive happened.  John was very appreciative of Sherlock’s efforts on his behalf and the fact that Sherlock was determined not to rush John back to civilisation before he was ready, but all the experiments he could think to run on how John reacted to new experiences had all been done and there wasn’t really any necessity to keep them here any longer.
They spent a long time kissing.  When one pulled away to catch a breath, the other followed in closely and captured their lips again, beginning another drugging kiss.  Sherlock learnt very quickly, first copying John then experimenting on his own to see what he liked.  His tongue tangled with John’s as he used it to savour and learn every inch of his mouth.
“This is just like James Bond.” John grinned at Mycroft’s raised eyebrow until Mycroft smiled smugly back at him.
“There’s no need.  I think watching you was enough for now.  You should know by now that I have total control over my transport, John. ”
John kissed across to Sherlock’s neck and dragged his teeth lightly along the skin up to his ear where he bit down on the earlobe.  Sherlock cried out and convulsively clutched on to John’s back with one hand as he raised his other to his mouth and bit down on his knuckle as John kissed his way back down again.  John did it several times, loving the stifled noises that Sherlock was making.  John sucked a love bite at the base of Sherlock’s neck before moving across to the other side and going through it all once more.  He’d definitely discovered a sensitive area for Sherlock and was determined to make the most of it.
They had been getting more comfortable with each other since the first night they had arrived.  Sherlock had shown John up to the bedroom he had called his own whenever he had stayed at the villa.  It still had the detritus of several experiments with which Sherlock had been involved at the time. He was delighted to see that some of these would still provide him some vital data of decay rates over a substantial period of time and he studied them in more detail as the week progressed.
“I’ve tried him for the last three days on that other one but didn’t hear anything back so that’s when I tried the number he’d given me for emergencies.  So, do you think he’s in trouble then?”
“Hello Mummy.  This is John.  His dad works here now and we’re going to examine the soil samples we just collected in the park.”
“That’s just ridiculous propaganda put about to perpetuate the myth.  We do have a sensitivity to light as you already know.  That’s why I wear the long coat, scarf, gloves and sunglasses.  I’ve built up my tolerance over the decades, but you won’t be quite as immune to start with so we may need to kit you out and get you some kind of hat too.  Maybe you could borrow my ear hat?”
"What thing?  You can't make someone forget something like that.  Is it like hypnosis or something?"
John felt around in the pockets but these, too, were empty; even the secret pocket in which Sherlock kept a little knife, which he had once used very successfully to assist their escape from a kidnapping.  He wondered whether Sherlock had another secret in his coat that had not been previously discovered.  He lay it down in front of him on the floor and felt over the entirety of the lining, listening carefully and looking out for any open threads.
John found himself always thinking of Sherlock in other ways too.  He tried to make him eat and sleep, wanting to keep him at the peak of health, but regardless of how little food Sherlock partook of he never ran out of energy; and as tired and restless as Sherlock appeared during the day he seemed to come to life even more at night, never flagging as John did himself.  It didn’t stop John caring though, he was a doctor, that was what he did and he had sometimes caught Sherlock giving him an indulgent, endearing look when he didn’t think John was looking.
“It is blatantly obvious to anyone who looks at her.  She always sits as near to him as she can and her pupils dilate and she blushes when he smiles at her.  Her nervousness also increases when he’s talking directly to her and her stutter becomes more evident.”
Sherlock ran to the bathroom and quickly came back with a tube of lube in his hand.  He shook his head at John’s face, knowing what he was thinking, but aware that it wasn’t something that they had discussed yet.
“Well, I’d be very proud if you followed in my footsteps.  It’s hard work, mind you, and can be quite tough on occasions; but when you get a good result and put away some very nasty pieces of work, it is very rewarding.”
“It’s true that nothing else has happened, but whether that is down to a cessation of hostilities or merely to our ever present vigilance, is impossible to tell.”
Sherlock instantly took him up on it and pulled John towards him, laying his own trail along John’s neck.  He placed his own mark higher on John’s skin, not giving him any chance to hide it away with his collar.  He smirked, liking the feeling of knowing that everyone would see that John was his.
John smiled down at Sherlock and ran his fingers gently through Sherlock’s hair, being careful not to snag them in the tangled ends.  He looked up as the Team Leader came to stand in front of him and gestured to two men behind him with a stretcher.
When the actors played out this scene, Sherlock was watching closely as he sat beside John, who was busy looking over his script as his first scene was coming next.  Greg didn’t seem happy about the way it was coming across but couldn’t seem to see why, so he had them do it a few times more.  It was quite obvious to Sherlock, however, that the reason it wasn’t working was that Oliver didn’t like Jasmine.  He was trying his best to flirt with her, but it really wasn’t reaching his eyes at all and, consequently, it didn’t seem genuine.
“You’re lucky I got here when I did.  The last air tower I passed said they were closing the airport because of this storm approaching and you saw how rough the water was.  I don’t think I could have brought it down if it had been much worse.”
John laughed but kept his arm raised, submitting to Sherlock’s examination.  When Sherlock had finished doing that arm he climbed over John, straddling his hips for a moment.  Unfortunately, as far as John was concerned, he didn’t pause there long enough for any more intimate contact before he climbed off the other side and repeated the whole touching and tasting process on John’s other arm.  He had to be careful of the broken fingers and the wrist burns again and also, this time, he couldn’t lift John’s arm quite as far due to the slightly limited range of movement caused by his shoulder injury but he did his best.
'No,' Sherlock answered. 'I'm just a trader. I go from village to village and buy stuff at a fair price and sell them at Ossabella or Zakath. This year pottery seems to sell pretty well, so that's why you only see pottery on my rug, but I usually have various goods - from jewellery to clothes to books.'
Squeezing through the crowd, John followed the woman's directions and, exactly five minutes later, found the merchant sitting under a blue tent, his pottery on the usual consumed rug. He was talking to a grey-bearded man and - although John couldn't get a word - it was clear from his fast, agitated talking that Sherlock was trying to persuade the old man to buy a vase.
‘Predictable book,’ the professor sentenced, eventually ending John’s torture. He barely registered what Holmes had said anyway, his ears whistling with high blood pressure. ‘You shouldn’t use it for your essay.’
Thanks for reading and sorry if it was less hot than the previous, but I needed a bit of build-up ;)
The woman laughed. 'Yes, yes. Sure. To each his own secrets! Speaking of which...who's him? Another secret?'
John's heart beat fast in his chest. First, he had just exposed himself to a potential threat. Second, that man still had
Throwing himself on the bed, he wondered how H had managed it. She had skills unknown to him. Sure she had been doing that job and living that life for a long time, and John was just an ordinary warrior with no aptitude for heroic quests, but it gave him a sense of utter powerlessness.
Sherlock took some dried leaves out of his pocket, crushed them in a small glass cup, added a transparent, gelatinous substance, and put the result in his mouth. He seemed so absorbed in the process that John asked himself if he ever heard what he had just said at all.
'Oh,' John said, quite unable to understand how Sherlock's plan worked but quite trusting it at the same time.
The library was, as always, dead silent. No one was there, nothing moved. He sat down at his usual table and took out a book he had brought with him just to keep up appearances. The clock on the wall marked a quarter to twelve. He waited. Each passing minute tick-tocked loudly in the empty space, each minute brought the black hand nearer to twelve, and when twelve struck John inhaled deeply.
'No, I haven't. The bowl was just the appetiser. A whole meal has still to be served,' the merchant said, leaving John even more confused. He stood up, shook the sand off his trousers and added: 'I'll come at the inn at six. You'll need clothes for the evening. I'll get them for you.'
'It's useless,' someone said behind him. 'They won't accept it. Not even when they are on the brink of death.'
John read the note twice. It took him a great deal of strength to realise that Mary - his Mary - had already decided everything without letting him know her true plan. Yes, of course he knew about his wife's
John waited for Holmes to move away, but he didn't, ‘I am quite sure there are rules here that do not allow a teacher to read his students' essays before the due date,’ John spat out and turned to face his professor.
The merchant stared at him as if he had just gone insane, his eyes two fixed points in the suffused lighting of the inn.
Wild red roses lay scattered on the floor, covering the unreadable names of generations of ancestors. Red roses to symbolise bloodshed. Wild roses because she had been wild in every sense of the word. Their smell permeated the air of the small chapel, a pungent bittersweet odour which mixed with the vague reek of putrefaction. They were to be burnt at the end of the ceremony, so the tradition said. A red fire of scarlet flowers to erase sins, to purify the soul, to elevate the spirit to the Afterworld.
Holmes’s cock was warm and had a masculine smell John found incredibly erotic as it was pushed slowly inside his mouth. It was definitely bigger than his own and slightly larger than Sholto’s. Some pre-come was already on the tip, and he moved the tongue around tasting its saltiness. His own cock throbbed and twitched at the sensation of Holmes pushing it farther inside. And when Holmes moaned for the first time, throwing his head back, John couldn’t hide a small grin of satisfaction.
He greeted Sherlock with a voice that John thought similar to an ass's bray. The merchant answered with a smile and a small bow of the head, a deference which John hadn't expected from a man who had just blurted out the private life of a woman.
'We've lost the Grange,' he said flatly. 'And it looks like we'll soon lose the post on the Wye River.'
It took John a second to realise what was going on. Not that he had understood everything. On the contrary he felt most details were missing.
Of course there was something going on, but confessing Mike he almost had a sexual encounter – well,
John gulped, and it seemed to him that the whole world suddenly disappeared. He could only hear Holmes’s breathing, could only see Holmes’s skin, and could only feel his own jeans become tighter.
He woke up with the first light of day seeping through the window, a vague sensation of warmth enveloping him like a cocoon. He rolled on the left, looking for Mary's comfortable embrace.
John had never met him out of the classroom before. He and Mike had even joked about Holmes living in his own office. His black curls were more ruffled than usual, with a couple of locks falling softly on his forehead. His usually pale cheekbones looked chiselled under the neon lights. His lips, with that ridiculous cupid-bow upper, were moist and red, slightly parted. Maybe it was the light, but they looked kissable. His eyes were still of that cold aquamarine, but, thanks to the dimness, his black pupils were larger. His long, thin neck disappeared into a white shirt that was almost too tight. No, wrong. It was definitely too tight. Holmes's nipples were clearly visible underneath the fabric. Two small parallel peaks mid-chest. Hard. John unconsciously licked his lower lip and swallowed.
Something clicked inside John's mind in that exact moment. All the subterfuges, all the little lies, all the things that Mary had never told him but had told to someone who John saw as a
That evening he was pacing to and fro his small bedroom. Books lay open on his desk, and he had managed to write about a page in the last two hours. But now the usual ten o’clock chaos had started, and John couldn't focus anymore. The solution to his problems would have been the library, if he had had enough willpower to go there. He had been balancing the pros and cons of seeking shelter there. Pro: silence, essay done. Cons: the possibility to find Holmes there, the impossibility to look at him without having second thoughts. But what were the chances of meeting him twice in two days at that odd hour? Close to zero.
John licked his lips as Holmes took a step forward, placed both his hands on John’s shoulders, and repeated, whispering into John’s ear, ‘Do you have
Turning his back to her, John felt Lady Hudson's eyes fixed on him as if she could see through all the lies. As he walked to meet Greg and the others, he murmured to himself, 'I'm sorry, Lady Hudson. I'm truly sorry.'
It was as though something clicked inside John’s head, like he had been dreaming the most beautiful dream and suddenly the alarm clock went off, waking him up. He removed his hands from his groin and jumped up on his feet as though the chair was on fire. He was breathing hard and his cheeks were hot.
The revelation and her cat-like movements had the effect to silence the small company even more, so much that the crackling of the burning torches could be heard.
He tried to concentrate on the books and ignore Holmes's presence. It proved impossible. The man stood beside him, his gaze on John's every movement. How could he write it when he couldn't even read three words without getting nervous? It was maddening.
John didn't want to, but the tone of the merchant seemed to suggest that he didn't want him around anymore. He asked himself why but kept it to himself. If he wanted information he had to abide by their rules.
Sherlock put away the silver coins. 'Could've asked for four,' he simply said, then added: 'I thought you got lost.'
John unconsciously freed his hands from underneath his thighs and started palming himself through the fabric of his jeans. When Holmes pinched both his nipples and let out the first moan, John pushed his hand harder against his throbbing groin and licked his lips.
John sprang up to his feet and turned to Holmes, taking him aback. They both stood still, John’s eyes fixed on Holmes as Holmes’s eyes were fixed on John.
John stared as flames engulfed the black stone, saw the stone disappear behind a wall of red. Then the High Priest's magic engulfed red with white, brighter than the brightest star. In less than the blink of an eye, the sarcophagus was gone, Mary was gone. With it, gone was John's world. The only thing left: the smell of burnt roses and their black ashes on the white floor. And Rosa, his daughter, crying in Lady Hudson's arms, as if for a glimpse of a second, in her white innocence, she understood the sadness of life.
and they say he lives in a cave of an oasis in the desert. I gathered all the information I could about him and compared it to the bits I had before. It fitted. Some reports mentioned the land of the
