The music was too loud.
“Your turn”, he says.
Sherlock closes his eyes and presses his hands firmer together. “I find myself intrigued by our conversations.” He grimaces, because that is a dishonest understatement. “Those desires that I had with previous partners… even considering this, it is once more getting difficult to stifle them. It is not entirely convenient. My brain is getting… foggy.”

helping out when he's a guest in someone's home. Sherlock cannot for the life of him understand it, having nurtured a lifelong habit of avoiding boring chores to the greatest extent possible (which turns out to be a great extent indeed), but it is oddly captivating to watch John do it. He smiles pleasantly at Sherlock's parents, chatting and joking and
“But-”
If I'm SURE? I am so anxious to hold her ridiculous five pounds and eight ounces that I can barely sit.

When Sherlock finally started to stir, I had already been writing for an hour. I glanced over when I heard the sheets rustle, and caught his closed-eyed smile, just the briefest softening on his features.

John hears him snarl, and the banging stops for a moment. Then it comes back again: “John, if you don't open the door, I will break in!”

I looked at his face, turned upwards to me, arrogant and somewhat triumphant, as if he was sure that he had scandalised me enough to be repulsed. But to me, his words only led me to a simple conclusion:
“Of course it was! It was extraordinary, it was quite… amazing.” I sound like an idiot. God, it's clear that Holm William is a genius; I must seem so stupid to him.
“You want me to kiss you?”

about that!
The forty-sixth year, their grandchild gets his first violin. John and Sherlock travel to London for never-ending concerts at music school. The seats are hard and everyone except for their boy is terrible, but it is always worth it for seeing his grave concentration on stage and his radiant eyes afterwards.
Thank you for reading, and thanks to those of you who have told me stories of your own encounters with the Swedish folk music and dance! I'm thrilled to hear all about it. And for those who didn't know anything at all about it before reading, thanks for keeping an open mind and letting me show you something new! You're all so lovely.
Harry, she's my sister.”
Sherlock turns around. He has been lying with John pressed against his back, but he wants to see John’s face for this.

It isn't until later that he thinks about what Sherlock let slip.
At three a.m., John is awoken by a brisk shake at his good shoulder. “Wh?” he slurs, already reaching for his gun.
I'll give sleeping another try.
It had always been a dream that couldn't last. He would lose his John one way or the other, and had he allowed himself to think about it, he would have expected it sooner than this.

“Yes, I know that”, he smiled condescendingly. “But I can't assume you will be any different from the imbeciles in the music section, now can I? I always have to do everything myself.”
. His mouth kept caressing me, and I shoved him back into mine, all finesse gone. Then his finger slid over that spot again, and my head fell back.
My insides felt like a wrestling bout between my heart and my guts. Part of me was afraid that it was all over, that Sherlock was done with me. But then I remembered the way he looked at me. The way he fought to stay silent, and how shocked the sounds that slipped through were. The way he laughed against me. I remembered our first dance and the way he held me, only to dismiss it as an act later.
You've met Lestrade, then.
“How-” I didn't bother to keep my voice calm any more, the pitch rising when I spoke. “How can he do that? How can he
I'm certain that I want to.
“Because every relationship I’ve ever had seemed a bit empty. Know what I mean? My ex-girlfriends didn’t really know me. And I didn’t really care about them. But you, you truly understood me. Losing that… it was harder then, settling for less.”
I moved my hand to make him stop thinking, and he grabbed my wrist to speed me up. He soon didn't remember anything but my name.
“What happened here?” he says as he reluctantly closes the door behind him, trapping the air inside.
John doesn't seem to mind, though.
John chuckles. He tips his head back, beaming at Sherlock. The mere sight of his smug grin makes Sherlock roll his eyes.
I think it simply looks too effortless when he does it. The audience doesn't understand the strength it takes to do that, because he does it entirely without flaw.
“I had my leg here first”, Sherlock says.
The eleventh year, Sherlock cries despite his best efforts when he says
When I couldn't do anything other than gape, he shoved his cock back into my mouth, thrusting shallowly. Though I was beyond coordinating any pleasure for him, fluid leaked out of him onto my tongue. It was so hot, the way he took what he needed and gave me everything.
“That's insane”, I said when Gregory told me on our way there.
heard it, and it surprised me.
The tunes they're playing today are less explosive than last week, but just as powerful. This one is in a minor key, pensive and expressive. Holm William still plays the melody, Soling Jacob sweeps forth the harmonies, and there is no bow-stroke that isn't skilfully reflected by the other player.
“Are you playing tonight?” I ask.
Mostly because he doesn’t trust himself not to do something very, very stupid on his way out.
He tried to look at his reflection and seek support. No one else was there, and he was seconds from losing consciousness.
I raised my chin, looking up at him on the stage. “It's your job to speak the words I write for you.”
The third person in the room suddenly shifted in the shadows. His hand moved to cover the gun in his belt, but it was a redundant gesture for Mycroft Holmes.

“I like being on holiday with you”, John sighs, nipping lightly at Sherlock's neck. “Even though you can't behave.”
John opens his eyes. “Food.” He nods to the empty plates on the coffee table.

With time, John stops noticing when it happens. Walking hand-in-hand is just the way they walk. Sherlock's hand never startles him now; it's always there through his day, kind of like his cups of tea. It's familiar, it's comforting, and it may be unconventional for friends – but that of course means nothing when it comes to Sherlock Holmes.

“Obviously”, he says to the ceiling.
how he acts when he's in my arms. He's not a sociopath. He's a person who thinks the night sky is beautiful, who loves dogs, who gets shy at innuendos, and who looks at me like I'm the whole world when he touches me. He's the cruellest man I know, but he's also all that.
“I barely have any subcutaneous fat, John.”

I duck my head to breathe into his shoulder. He sighs; I feel it happen within the circle of my arms. He lays his cheek against the side of my neck. I can hear the relief in his breath.

“Hey.” I smile.
“But I haven't written anything in years. There are only blank pages strewn over my flat.”

“John”, he whispered brokenly, face contorted as though he was crying.

“Jeopardising our friendship. What if you fall in love with me, and I don’t fall in love with you? I don’t want to hurt you.”
I drew back to rest my nose against his, and he slowly opened his eyes. There was bravery in them for looking at me in that moment.
Moriarty bent his knees to straddle Sherlock's hips. Then he lowered his head over Sherlock's exposed pale throat, inhaling loudly. “Such a little virgin”, he murmured against his flesh.

There is nothing to say. Useless words tear at one another within John's throat, soothing words weigh at Sherlock's heart. None of the words are more real than this:

Paris lay outstretched by the elephant's feet, set on fire by yellow and red trees. It was beautiful, crisp and unashamedly colourful, vast and whirring with life. We were a part of it, so small at the centre of the busy city, and at the same time we were closed off, safe in the small balcony, in the small haven of one another's arms.
Sherlock narrows his eyes at him. John has a habit of clearing his throat when he’s nervous or unsure of something. That, and rubbing his hand over the back of his neck – ah, there it is. Conclusion: there is something John is not telling him. But when Sherlock tries to deduce what it is, John turns his face away in quite a deliberate way.
he has no trouble demanding attention from everyone in the room. His polska is as powerful as an entire spelmanslag playing together.
I tried to make him stop it. He panicked. “Stay where you are, don't move, keep your eyes fixed on me”
He was getting frantic. At the edge of a roof. I did the only thing to do. I backed, held up my hand, told him it was all right. Whatever you say, anything, just don't, don't.
John's eyes flicker to his mouth ever so briefly, and then back to his eyes. Sherlock stares back at him, not managing so much as a blink. And then John moves forward.
He looked at me, glanced at the door and then back at Moriarty, starting to walk slowly towards him. I realised that he finally had Moriarty's attention, and I slowly, quietly rose to my feet behind his back. I winced every time the fabric of my clothes shifted – it would be crazy if we got away with this; a third person standing right there on the floor and not being discovered.

“Sherlock. This is not a good idea for an experiment.”

Sherlock was visibly vibrating with annoyance. He plastered an insincere smile onto his face. “Thank you for your insightful advice”, he said, slowly and sourly. “While you're here, could you do me the favour of firing that man over there? It would
Moriarty reached out with his free hand and nudged two fingers under the tight necklace around Sherlock's neck.
Yes, I did run my other project by my beta and yes, she did still deliver this chapter in a week. I really can't praise her enough - she puts up with my second-language English, dedicates hours every week in the middle of her crazy life to follow my latest Johnlock whim, and hasn't had a single day's break from betaing my fics for two whole years. Trust me, we love her.
“What the hell just happened?!” I blurt. I'm desperate to know I'm not the only one who noticed.
“So you think that we could be more than friends.” Sherlock is impressed by the steadiness of his own voice.
When he turns the kitchen lights on to reveal Sherlock's face properly, he's almost amused by the way Sherlock gazes at him with triumph and pride, from a face soaked with crimson red.
“Have you been drugged?”
“Then I want it like this”, I whispered.
“But you hate Mycroft, naturally.”

“So what are you going to do?” Holmes snapped. “Leave the Moulin Rouge? Remember what happened before I saved you from the streets, Sherlock.”
John    13:52
Holmes eyed the handle of his umbrella, twisting it slightly. “I was merely concerned.”
“She thinks she hasn't found them all yet”, John says. “We texted yesterday, she wanted to return a shirt I've forgotten at her place. She told me the flat still stinks, even though she has washed the carpet twice.” Not a muscle moves on Sherlock's face. John waits a few more seconds, then he casually adds: “Where are the prawns?”
The implication poured like cold poison into my body, my heart pumping it out to spread further through my limbs. “What?”
Speaking of my travel: This fic has been quite influenced by me meeting my beta and friend. For example, John's remark about not knowing how to explain what William is to him - that's how I feel about her. This is what she commented on that, in the middle of the markup for this chapter:
“Someone in the crew had sex against that wall less than an hour before this was filmed.”
He walked out of the doors and over the courtyard with confident steps. The coat swirled dramatically around his ankles. He walked like the god he was, owning every place on earth and every heart in Paris, not caring if he crushed them under the hard soles of his shoes.

The tradition is that at Midsummer's Eve, the girls go out and pick seven different sorts of flowers in complete silence. They put the bouquet under their pillow, and if they manage not to say a word from the moment they pick the first flower until they fall asleep, they will dream of their future husband.

It's not like that, though.
There is a special sort of warmth in a bed that John Watson is sleeping in. Sherlock didn’t realise he was chilled until he crawls in under John’s duvet in the early morning and gets to share his sleepy heat. Perhaps Sherlock has in fact been cold his entire life, because he has never felt warmth like this. It seeps into his very bones.
“To what?”
John is just his friend, regardless of their conversation yesterday. You do not choose clothes for the benefit of your friend.
Holmes had an investor. The Bohemians had a show. Stamford, Gregory and Molly had all knocked on my door in turn, trying to drag me with them to the celebrations in Stamford's flat. I had declined, telling them I needed to write – and I really did, as the first script reading was tomorrow, and I hadn't produced a single line apart from the song.
know that story.
His voice was softer when he spoke again. “My parents were gone. I can't even remember them. Never had a home besides the gutters of Paris. I was fourteen when I first tried drugs – I don't know what took me so long, really.”
Holmes stared into Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock stared back, an eyebrow twitching. Holmes tipped his head back a fraction, Sherlock rolled his eyes, and Holmes' mouth twisted to the side. I had no way of guessing what they communicated to each other through this, but it was unsettling. I wondered how long they'd had this silent understanding, and why they had needed to develop it.
When Sherlock is too absorbed by his experiment, John tries to distract himself by cleaning the flat. But under their bed, he finds something that makes his chest even tighter with longing.

Everyone is pissed off with Sherlock. He doesn't let anyone in on what he's doing, even tries to shake John off. His sudden shift from the impulsive joy in the office to the snarling rudeness now, means that he must have heard John's conversation with Donovan. He must be embarrassed too; he was the one who hugged John.

This is why they're looking at us in confusion when we're speaking. No one else bothers to talk to him, and they wonder why I do. They don't know. They don't see.
John caresses Sherlock's lips with his mouth softly, steadily, slowly.
And it just slips out of me, honest and giddy:
I just don't want to drag you into this any
This kiss is more earnest, more fitting for their January First anniversary. Sherlock’s mouth opens slowly under John’s lips, inviting him inside. John breathes in the sweet scent of him for a few moments before he ends the kiss and turns back to the fireworks outside. For a while they just stand there together, watching the sparks rain over the city.
He shivered then, the sweat on our skin cooling us down. I sat up and pulled down the covers, hope glowing in my stomach when he let me tuck them around us. I curled up on my side, watching the side of his face.

Well, maybe Sherlock Holmes can.
“There's this dancer”, I said. “He's the most beautiful dancer in all of India.” Sherlock still refused to look at me. “But his kingdom is invaded by an evil maharajah. The Maharajah has his eyes set on the Hindu Dancer, and he wants to conquer him and make him his own.”

The liquid sleepiness is long gone from Sherlock's body; he is stiff and cannot take a proper breath, completely wasting the limited time he has with John in his arms. And then John's left hand moves into Sherlock's hair, and Sherlock tenses up even more severely. He tilts his head back.
Oh, my Sherlock.
Oh, so your name is also John? I meant John

Yesterday's adventure felt unreal in the white daylight. The magical creature I had met inside this strange building seemed to belong in fairy-tales. It was hard to imagine he would actually be inside the stage building in the back – perhaps he didn't exist at all unless it was dark.
She gasps that she's sorry, over and over, until finally she gets out: “There's this guy.”
I could tell, just from watching his back, that it was like that for Sherlock too. When he ran, he was joyful. When he ran, he was alive.

Soling Jacob and William are still playing when there are only two couples left on the dance floor; Täpp Lisa and I, and another couple. The four of us keep trading dance partners so that no one dances with anyone for too long, until Lisa tells me she's too tired to keep dancing. They're all neighbours, it turns out, who always walk each other home after a dance. We bid each other a good night, and the three of them leave the dance barn.
Back in the day, Swedes didn't just have first names and surnames, they also put the name of the house they lived in before the first name. This to make it easier to know who you were talking about, if a village for example had several Anna's. In this chapter we meet Anna who lives in the Liss house – Liss Anna. This went out of style long before my time, but when you play Swedish folk music you hear it a lot, as the old fiddlers who passed on the songs had those house names.
John's hand is a marvel. Soft yet rough, small yet strong, firm yet delicate. Sherlock held it, and held it, squeezed and relaxed, swept his thumb over warm skin. He held it and marvelled and gave all of his fierce attention to the beautiful structure of muscle, bones, veins and skin in his grip.
We stopped. We watched. Arms pressing. Hands finding. He had no gloves.
I found his pulse. I let his hand rest there, half on my face, and let the tides of his blood drum against my lips. Steady, unwavering, like nothing on earth could stop it. I know, of course, that that isn't true. But it was good enough to let me fall back asleep and be spared any more dreams.

The thirty-first year, Mrs Hudson shrinks and fades. John is there with calm and steady hands. Sherlock tries to be there too, but he is buzzing with all the terribly sad things he has encapsulated in his chest. He can't be with her without pacing around her, his strides long and his coat as dramatic as ever. He loathes himself for causing her stress like that, until she roars at him that she isn't stressed, she just wants her dear boy there, even if he is so afraid of himself that he can't be still.
I have borrowed some lines from Vincent Starrett's poem
He frowns. “Where are you?”
“Yeah. God, yeah. Oh, god, you’re an amazing kisser.”
Watson's eyes are kind. Sherlock scoffs to shake it off.
Suddenly Sherlock freezes, his free hand raised in the air and his mouth forming a circle. “Ohh John, that's it”, he breathes, his eyes darting quickly back and forth without seeing anything except what's in his mind.
“Sherlock”, he tries, “Sherlock, you git, no one can understand you” – but Sherlock doesn't hear.

“It's just so incredibly petty it's sweet”, John says, and the great detective Sherlock Holmes blushes.
“I'm making you a cuppa, yeah? We could both use something to wind down.” John waits another moment on the other side of the door, then moves into the kitchen and fills the kettle.
You won't get this letter either. It's probably silly, but I wanted to write. Turns out I really do need it. My laptop is at the flat, and I will not write my blog on your laptop, so. Pen and paper it is.
“It's still amazing.”
He hadn't seen me yet. He was watching the people dancing, looking bored. There was an empty space around him, as if everyone knew that it was best not to approach this man.
I barely heard her. Sherlock stopped again, and his cold mask was entirely gone now. He looked infinitely vulnerable with his slim waist trapped in the corset, acres of bare, white skin under the diamonds, and eyes big and fearful. “Go”, he said, low and desperate.

Sherlock smirked. “Oh, I think you just picked a side.”
My legs are trembling too now. I resolutely hold my pose on the floor by William's feet. I can see his throat working before he too manages to swallow and get out a quiet:
I snorted. “What's going on, Sherlock?” I asked as I approached the stage.
I don't know if I'm imagining the way he looks frantic for not finding something more significant to say.
“No, right now I'm your exhausted flatmate and angry friend who needs you to stop taking risks like that.”
The flat is filled with Sherlock. He's quiet but he's glowing. He's walking about with his dressing gown untied over a crisp white shirt with straining buttons. He moves with a hushed grace that he is unaware of himself – he doesn't even seem to think I'm looking. His face is unmoving – not closed off, not sulky, just still, just quiet. His skin is pale, his lips are too, but his eyes are softly shining, the undersea-rainbows playing over his work, over the walls, sometimes gliding peacefully over me.
“Mmmm”, Sherlock says, “that was terrific.”
Sherlock is singing.
“I didn't sleep at all.”
“Sherlock”, he whines, his legs starting to give out. Sherlock presses against him even harder to hold him upright. He is hard as steel against John's waist, and John's hands wander to grab his arse and pull him in closer. “What if someone-” he pants, his head falling hard against the wall behind him when Sherlock's grip tightens.
We ordered Chinese for dinner. I lit a candle. He looked sad when he saw it. But he ate.
Moriarty was staring unwavering at me. His face seemed to hold nothing but those dark eyes, like black holes consuming every light in the room. It was the first time we looked at each other and each really knew the other. Until he saw me there, he had gravely miscalculated my strength. And though I'd had a premonition about his, I never actually guessed that the allure of his power and assets would be enough to make Sherlock choose him in the end.

I smile self-consciously. “It's not very interesting. I'm not that good at it – it's my first fiddle, as you know, and really I'm just-”
Sherlock has studied him out of the corner of his eye all day, trying to determine where the change lies.

“Well, goodnight”, Sherlock says in the hallway outside their bedrooms.
Up until then, our adventures in my bed had been restricted to nights only. The stolen kisses that had seen daylight had all been kept within the walls of the Moulin Rouge, easily and often interrupted. Here in my room, everything was quiet except for us, the whole space ours to claim. It felt so wonderfully wrong, indulging in filthy kisses with afternoon sun begilding the window frame.
The ensemble stood around us with grim faces. Holmes' eyes were naked and crushed. Gregory lifted his hands slowly to take off his Maharajah turban. Everyone was quiet, allowing only my strangled sobs to sound. I was shaking all over, my body stiffening and refusing to live on and make space for this new reality.

It’s all whispered into the narrow space between them like a secret. Sherlock hangs onto every word, anticipation simmering in his gut.
I stared at her, not knowing what to say. Not once during her story did a shadow darken her face, or her voice betray the gravity of what she told me. The smile was never far from her purple-painted lips, and it nearly broke my heart.
John giggles breathlessly into Sherlock’s sweaty skin.
My room grew brighter and the golden sun turned white. I wrote and wrote, barely looking up from my typewriter until every word had found its place. Then I ripped the sheet out and took it with me upstairs.

By the seventh day, my heart was constantly pounding. Something as fragile as it was strong had settled in my gut, reminding me of its existence every time I drew air into my lungs. My chest tried to expand beyond the confines of my ribcage. It was a floating feeling, not all that pleasant.
“Well. Consider it the declaration for the day.”
“Please”, I slurred into his hair. His curls were damp with sweat. The Hindu crown was hard and unforgiving against my cheek. “You'll be all right. You'll be all right.”
I was no longer afraid to look at myself and find the broken shell of a soldier. When I looked into the mirror above my cracked sink, I sometimes tried to see what Sherlock saw. I put my hair in order in the morning thinking

Sherlock sees that John isn't normal. He chose to let John into his magical world, to see the battlefield of London and to navigate all the secret pathways in the city with him. He looked at John, cracked one joke, dashed off and knew John would follow, because somehow he already
“Sherlock, I'm in love with you”, he blurts, before he even has time to think about the potential consequences of saying this to his best friend. “Sorry, didn't mean it to slip out like that, I just… what I felt for her, what I've felt for… it's not… this is… oh my God.”
You know what, this isn't working.

He brags about his doctor skills and she is impressed.
My typewriter shines in the moonlight. I push slowly at the line space lever. The carriage rattles when it slides to the right. The space within the type guide is empty, white and vast, and I need to fill it. I need to say it, if there are ever going to be any words following these. It is the one thing I do not want to tell, and the one thing that I have to.
John    13:48
“Moriarty, I am most terribly sorry-”
I am a soldier, a doctor and a poet. I have skirted the edges of death in the hot sand of Afghanistan, and I have fought it in sterile hospital rooms, saving those who should have been taken. I have held my heart in my bare hands and watched it die with the last breath of my beloved. And yet, I still don't know much about death.
But then he looked down. And although the distance was too far for me to see his face, I could sense his gaze on me. I felt it, soft and tender. When Moriarty couldn't see his face, there was the hint of a smile around his eyes. Something warm that contrasted with the coldness of the night, the lights, and the man behind him.
At nine a.m., John is secretly awake. Sherlock's hands caress him, stirring his blood and warming his skin. He doesn't say anything and he tries not to move. Of course he hasn't fooled Sherlock, who ducks his head to kiss him. “Happy New Year, John.”
But William takes it one step further. His analysis is razor-sharp when he speaks of the precise way his choices in dynamics, phrasing and beat affect the dance floor. I gradually come to see that in his mind, there is a great map with thousands of possible ways it could go. He's ready to follow one of those paths at any time, knowing precisely what the effects will be given what he sees on the floor.
Before he leaves, he pulls the blanket up around me. I think he strokes my hair once, but when I wake up again in the morning I can't be sure whether it was only in my dream.
John thinks fondly of the miserable man with the cane, he remembers how naive he was, and he thinks about how wonderful the fifty-one years with Sherlock have been.
Sherlock    14:13
His eyes narrowed. “You are not a doctor here.”
“Oh, please”, I heard myself whisper, the tension gathering quickly in my lower body when he stroked me. He kissed my gaping mouth, sucking my lip, and I was done for.
“-but the piece is… quite. Well. Beautiful.” He averted his eyes. “It works well with our voices.”

Before the stage, the conductor moved. The musicians tentatively started playing the heartbreak music composed for the ending. Apprehension on their faces, the Diamond Dogs in the background started slowly dancing.
When I saw his back, the beautiful miles of alabaster skin interrupted by angry red streaks and covered with compresses… then every part of me was shaking.
Sherlock turned away to hang up his coat. “Moriarty came to see him about it today”, he said distractedly. “He has, as of now, exclusive ownership of me.” He spun on his heel, spreading his hands ironically to the sides to show himself off.
It's just that John is a man of few words and there's nothing to say, really.
I'm your life partner. It means we do this
I'm fine. Sad, yes, but I'm not worried about it
“See”, Stamford chipped in, pointing at me. “John's a writer, he knows what he's talking about.”
Afterwards, we lay side by side on top of the covers. Our hands were touching, but I didn't dare take his properly. There was a question on the tip of my tongue that I didn't know how to ask.
Sherlock sighs. “You do make a good argument.”
“Well”, Sherlock says, still in his haughty voice, “I certainly could have told you that.” He meets John's gaze from the corner of his eyes, the candlelight glistening in them and a meaningful smile playing on his lips.
John raises his brows, trying to remember something in Sherlock's speech that indicated he was talking to John. “I did say. You didn't hear me. You were rambling deductions so fast no one could even understand you.”
John clears his throat.

He has barely finished the last word before regret floods him like ice water. He's already asked Tori. He can't stand having the two of them in the same room; even when they're being civil his skin crawls with the need to separate them. He doesn't know who he should be when both of them are there.
I lifted his hand. One of us was trembling. Could have been both. I took his pulse. Wouldn't have heard his suppressed whimper if I hadn't been standing so close. His pulse was jumping under my fingertips and I forced myself to believe the evidence that Sherlock was alive.
“Will you be playing at Sidensjö's Midsummer celebration?” I ask to break the silence.
Sherlock    10:10
I shook my head and smiled. “Always have to excel at everything?”
John    14:35
“Please take me out of here!”
“Oh!” Sherlock shouted, once again halting Moriarty's turn towards my hiding place. “Moriarty, let me just say… You- you look quite dashing. Sorry, it's just… I have certainly never encountered anyone with such an air of authority and power.”
“Nothing, I just-” I looked at the sheet of paper in my typewriter to avoid his gaze. “I like knowing what you're hiding under there, that's all.”
When the closing credits have rolled and John switches the telly off, the flat is completely silent except for Sherlock's calm breathing. John allows himself to watch Sherlock for a little while, drawn to the peace of his features. There's not a single crease on his face, his lips are parted again, and his hair is a messy tangle that makes him look boyish.
John    14:04
Sherlock's eyes screwed shut when the necklace choked him. The sharp gems cut his throat in an ornamental pattern before it broke. Jewels clattered to the floor. Sherlock drew a painful breath, and then came the punch. He fell onto the diamonds on the cold stone.
“But he's not-”
“Are you sure-” I started in a break for air.

“You certainly had no problem with that when you relied on me fixing every problem you had.”

I can feel William's body come alive under my hands from the exertion of the dance. The back of his purple shirt is warm and humid, and the scent of him is stronger the longer we dance. Every breath I take has William in it. It's intoxicating. I want to bury myself in the junction between his neck and shoulder and live there forever.

John smiles incredulously. “We don't know a thing about each other. I don't know where we're meeting; I don't even know your name.”
I had to fight hard not to smile at the familiar words in his clipped tone.

Extra thanks to shcrlockhouse for coming to my rescue when I needed to make a last-minute rephrasing, and wasn't sure how a native speaker would say it. I'm so grateful for the Twitter network, where I can throw out a question that's beyond my scope of knowledge, and within minutes I have an answer from someone in this diverse, multi-talented fandom. You're all golden!
But there is a flavour to this particular case of arousal with which he has been unfamiliar until now. He has never felt quite this hot; his muscles have never had this useless liquid quality. His groin has never felt quite so full, and he has never lost his grip on coordination like this without even being interested in regaining it. He is only interested in halting on the steps, turning around and wrapping himself around the little soldier with the intense gravity pull behind him.

“Yeah? What are you going to threaten me with? Because I do see that, Sherlock, and you know I do. You're just picking a fight to drive me away-”
“If we must”, Sherlock says with a roll of his eyes that doesn't match his contented tone.
Then why didn't you SAY SOMETHING TO ME? How could you let me think that? Whatever the stakes, how could you let me think that? Why did you choose
“U-huh”, John says, fighting his smile. In the corner of his eye, he sees Sherlock glance at him.
Sherlock puts his lush lips against John's ear. “Why?” he breathes, and John writhes at the realisation that Sherlock is ready to finish this here and now.
“Definitely not the gay thing.”
I smiled faintly. “I'm happy that he has you.”
John calls my name just after I have passed.
“No, it wasn't the writing”, I cut him off. “It-”
“In Paris, you will. You'll meet other artists who would be delighted to work with you, and then the inspiration will come.”
When Sherlock comes back to himself with a gasping breath, John lets him go. Sherlock slides down onto the floor, and opens his eyes to the pitch-black Baker Street bathroom.
“Don’t you find that difficult? Don’t you ever long for something else? For… someone?”

“Right, and don’t you ever think how great it’d be to base a relationship on that? I don’t have feelings for you, not in that way, but… what if I could?”
My mind was reeling, going over the facts of the diagnosis, looking for something useful in my years of medical studies. What good were they if I couldn't save this man? But I knew what consumption meant. I had seen it take more people than I care to remember.
The mansion finally comes into sight, lighting up the night. There are no close neighbours and no street lights, so the only light comes from the windows of the house. The stone wall surrounding the mansion is high and the gate in it is fancy; thick, black iron bars with an elegant ornament on top.
The windows have been dark for so long now that you can barely even imagine light in them. Although it hasn't been so very long since the Moulin Rouge was alive, it's as if nobody remembers anything other than these blighted shapes of a ghostly, abandoned bordello. When I look down into the dusty courtyard, it doesn't seem real that there once was a giant elephant there, majestically glowing with the lights of the night.
“Fine.” I cleared my throat, then cleared it again. Stamford found someone to support Molly when she left the room, and Sherlock and I stood awkwardly on stage, not looking at each other. I wished I
Hell, John doesn't know what it is. He only knows that it means Sherlock is here, and Sherlock is his, and now that John knows the soft vulnerability of his mouth, he will never ever be able to let him go.
Thompson was an unusually clever creature.
All his studying did not prepare him for the sensation of the peculiar state of matter that a bee cluster is. It is surprisingly warm in there, and he can feel hundreds of tiny bee feet picking at his fingers. The wings brush softly against his skin. Sherlock cups his hand and gently separates a big handful of bees from the cluster. They are reluctant to let go of each other, but they are not at all defensive; a swarm has no home, no brood and no honey to protect, and is therefore docile.
The door was unlocked. I was in luck; Stamford had finished work early that day.
Sherlock's eyes narrow. “Don't patronise me. As if

“Want me to prove it to you?” I said, even though I knew the whole act was just a way to make me read it out and pay him attention.
And then Sherlock's arms wrap around him out of the blue, reminding John that it really is fine. Sherlock wants this; he hugs John at any time, regardless of what John is currently doing. He's completely unselfconscious about it, doesn't seem to ponder the issue at all.

“No, I just tried to ask him, do you think a nun would say this about a hill?”
I notice what he's saving for last. And sure enough; he finally stops by the half-finished violin top plate lying in the middle of the desk. The F-holes are not yet carved out, but the shape of the wood is obviously unmistakeable. I'm actually pretty pleased with the way the upper and lower bouts and the waist are balanced against each other on this one.
is the one Sherlock invites into his bright world.
“Well. No. I… I only pretended to, I suppose.”
John locks the door behind him, a wicked smile spreading on his face. He slowly undresses, getting in the shower and turning the water on. It's only seconds until Sherlock is outside the door.

When he continued, the conductor rose his baton, and the orchestra started playing gently to his words.
“We'll be right there”, John smiles tightly.
John is so stunned that he lets Sherlock drag him by his hand through the lobby and back to the crime scene without a word. Sherlock doesn't even seem to know he's said something nice.
appearance of visiting Mrs Hudson.
I swear I don't do it on purpose.
I take one step into Sidensjö's dance barn the following Saturday and already I ask myself why in God's name I've never come here to dance before. The air is alive with gleaming cascades of notes from one lone fiddle. The dance floor is whirling in a wild polska. Men stomp their feet into the wooden floor hard enough to send up sparks from the soles of their shoes; women's skirts stand out like bluebells.
“Oh my god”, Sherlock pants and has to squeeze his eyes shut again. “Well. Now you-”
Now he caught me looking again, and he blushed under his safety goggles and stopped in the middle of a heartfelt

Because on the eighth day, Moriarty came back.
“Why would you do that?” Sherlock interrupts, still not looking up from his microscope.
The dressing room was grazed by the faint light of the rising sun, still below the horizon. Sherlock's eyes moved erratically behind closed eyelids. Sweat shone on his forehead no matter how many times Martha wiped it clean.
Sherlock hums into his hip, not moving.
Mary's face was red when she looked back at me. “I-”

John shrugs. “Yeah. Things did change.”
I leaned back until his face came into focus. “Stay, Sherlock.”
When John opens it, he knows what Sherlock means. John is still using Harry's old phone, and after dropping it on the asphalt outside the clinic today, the display is cracked just where the first line of the texts he writes are showing. He does need a new phone – but this one seems a bit expensive.
John raises his eyebrows. “How am I? I'm… God, Sherlock, you know something?”
Brushing one’s teeth with this amount of sexual tension in the room is a ridiculous affair. It is mildly surprising that the mirror doesn’t break from the glances Sherlock and John share in it.

We moved, breathed, ran as one. We finished it. As one.
“What makes you think I'm not?”
But as I keep my eyes fixed on her, I suddenly know. Perhaps she will not always live with me; perhaps John and I will not always be as close as we currently are. But she and I can be whatever we want to each other. This new person has her whole life before her, and she gets to decide for herself what she wants. If I want to be here for her, I can, and if she wants to keep me, she will.
“His life is the only one that matters.” Sherlock's rasping voice was nearly unrecognisable. “I have no time left, anyway.”
A woman's voice echoed through the large, empty hall.
“Huh”, John says. Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “Well, you know how I said that if we do something sexual, that’s a line we can’t un-cross? I think we might have crossed it just talking about all of this.”
Without saying a word, John gets up from the sofa. Sherlock immediately walks towards his bedroom, dragging John behind him. When they enter, the intimacy of being invited into his friend's bedroom hits him somewhere in the stomach, but Sherlock doesn't seem to notice.
“I wanted to show you”, he murmured, wrapping his arms around me from behind.
Greg    16:04
“Are you seeing…?”
Sherlock doesn't manage to stay quiet no matter how John shushes him. At the end, John doesn't either.
“Good.” I stopped beside him, too out of breath to properly speak. “That was ridiculous”, I managed, clutching my side.
“All is well, I take it”, Holmes said smoothly. He put the tip of the umbrella at the floor, leaning slightly on it.

Say SOMETHING
It must have been almost a year since Sherlock broke John's RAMC mug during a mad experiment. John had been furious and Sherlock had scoffed at him for getting so upset about it. And now, hidden far under their bed, he finds it again; the small shards glued together.
“Obviously”, William says.
“What if I don't
Sherlock watches their joined hands resting on top of the zebra sheets. “If there is one thing I have learned about my heart, it is that it cannot be trusted. In fact, no part of my body can. This is why I keep it under such firm control. If we become too intimate, I will lose control completely.”
I stepped away.
supporting me. He is preparing a new dressing room for me as we speak.” Sherlock smiled confidently. “All that money he invests in the show? He appreciates art just as much as I do. I'm certain he recognises that the work is the most important thing.”
Every time John transfers her to my arms I imagine that I will hold her for twenty minutes at the most. A moment of half-lying on the sofa with her on top of my chest, looking out the window, mentally preparing the next experiment I plan to conduct.
The movement of Sherlock's lips is careful and tentative, and his jagged breathing is reverent through his nose. John's pulse rate has increased so quickly that he's dizzy. The

Probably just a trick of the light.
“Sherlock dear”, Mrs Hudson says. “Have another piece of chocolate.”
He is so beautiful.
8:00:00: Could it be Sherlock? Could it?
When he went on and turned a corner, there were other people there. I hardly noticed them, unable to see anything besides Sherlock's fleeing back. They all noticed us, though; it was hard not to.
This is when Mikael brings up the failed night-wooing again. I listen absently to his and Greger's complaints over the Drömme girls. “I've met them all, and I don't like any of them.”
When John speaks, his words crack the secrets draped in the air of 221B.

when something wasn't right. What Sherlock did with deductions, I did with a fine-tuned sense of where I was needed. I tore the door to the castle open, and only spent a second eyeing the two staircases before randomly choosing one.

movie, which will be the case throughout the fic.
I thought we were going to live forever. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, when I go back to that pure joy, I still think we can. Because such a moment of clarity must somehow be true. When you know something so deep in your soul that it becomes a part of who you are, it can't be an illusion.
“Stop, stop!” he shouted in the middle of the song. Beside him on the stage, Molly's mouth snapped shut and she looked worriedly at him. The orchestra kept playing a few measures before trailing off, one by one.
John is looking down at him. His face is puffy with sleep, and his eyes are shockingly blue. His short fringe is standing straight up. It looks ridiculous.

“Who's
He looks up at me, amused. “John, you shock me.”
John strokes his palm over Sherlock's smooth cheek, the contour of his cheekbone beautiful against the morning light from the window. “Hello Sherlock”, he says in a barely audible voice.
I was wondering how Sherlock is doing? I

“Not quite.”
“One more hour”, John hums, unsure if the words actually form on his tongue in the end.
“It will be the show of the new century”, Holmes finally interposed. “It will include every talent we have among our Moulin Rouge dancers; fire-eaters, muscle men, contortionists, courtesans – and it will all be powered with electricity. The modern, bohemian spirit will make it popular in a city such as Paris. I dare say that with your involvement, Moriarty, this show may run for decades.”
“No”, he whispers.

“Okay, this is not as silly as it'll sound. Before I first started sleeping in your bed, I was changing my bed sheets one day and accidentally picked this up. I went to get one of my own, but I forgot to return yours, and it smelled like you which was… nice, so it kind of… stayed in my bed.”

John smiles at him and presses play. Sherlock's eyes are still on him, creating an invisible connection between their bodies that lingers after Sherlock turns his attention to the screen.
' not humiliating enough as it is? Why would anyone in their right mind want to have a film crew following the proceedings and then show it to the entire British nation?”
They eat awkwardly on the sofa, upper arms and knees pressed together.
Sherlock dives back to his lips, his tongue slipping into John's mouth urgently. John tries to slow things down, to back up to safer ground, only he has no bloody clue what ground that might be. The way Sherlock gives in to this is irresistible, and John's hips press upwards helplessly, screaming for friction. He still hasn't taken an active role in the kissing, and when it's obvious that Sherlock tries to make him do it, it's like a fire alarm blaring through his mind.
“Don't say it”, he whispered before I got a chance to open my mouth.
Throwing myself into a project like this would be rash and stupid – in other words, exactly the kind of thing I have never been able to back away from.
“No”, I rasped. “It's not.”

“This song is so lovely, John”, she said while I took a seat next to Stamford. “It's an honour to perform it.”

How wonderful life was, now Sherlock was in the world. I lay awake late into the night, staring at the ceiling, heart pounding in my chest. My skin smelled like him.
Right, that decides
Sherlock suddenly tears himself away from John's mouth, escaping to the space by his neck as if the pleasure is too much to bear. He pants against John's throat, making John's head desperately fall back and his jaw drop. John gasps for air, but he doesn't have a chance to catch his breath before Sherlock sucks at the sensitive skin. John can't help moaning loudly. How is it even possible that this mouth feels
“I think it’s wonderful”, Sherlock whispers to their hands.

“You didn't like it?”
Away, away from the turning blades, groaning their final verse. Fly, fly away.
Not much got past Holmes, but there was one actor great enough to fool him. Sherlock scowled, arranging his rudest expression onto his features. “The work”, he answered. “It's all that matters to me. I will not become a real actor if I spend the nights as a whore.”

John is correct; he has already grieved. And this is not what his grief looks like. His eyes are clear where he sits across from me; he sips his tea and doesn't forget to drink it before it gets cold.
John stands by the stove and stirs a frying pan while Sherlock watches from the kitchen table.

“What?” Moriarty interrupted. “Other ways to stage your precious little show? Other ways to make your darling Virgin into something more than a dirty whore?”
John puts his nose in the tumult of Sherlock's hair, breathing quietly. He can feel Sherlock's heart beating against his hand, and his own heart beating against Sherlock's back. At once, every trace of awkwardness and worry leaves him. Sherlock in his arms is all that matters, and he isn't about to throw away a night they both badly want, for some irrational feelings of guilt.
“Technically, we share all our pillow cases.”

Boring? What ever are you talking about? SH
Sherlock's brain kicks into gear, frightening his heart into a pounding rhythm. How did they end up like this? How long has John been awake? Is it okay for friends to sleep like this? Where does the line go? Should he move away? Or could he get away with moving closer?

, can he? He glances at John – John who is here with his flesh and his blood and his heat and his hands – and Sherlock doesn't know how to reach for him. Yes, they are married, but they have been a romantic couple for only three months. After a week apart, Sherlock feels unsure of the everyday intimacy they have so recently learned to share. It no longer feels easy to reach out and touch. Sherlock walks stiffly, his entire body tense with the effort not to throw himself at John and wrap himself around him in an unsolvable knot.
Finally, he unfolded his arms and gave us his verdict.

. The deduction of what war John was in isn't necessarily accurate in a historical timeline - I did do some research, as Iraq didn't exist in 1895 and I had to exchange it for another country. I found a list of where Britain was sending troupes during this time period, but I readily admit that I didn't dive too deep into what went down in Burma i the early 1890's before I chose it. Apologies to all war-history enthusiasts.
It's impossible not to be pulled in by the music. I forget everything about introducing myself to a few people before I dance, instead leaving Mikael and Greger at the door to go straight to the bench along the wall. I hold out my hand to the first girl I see, barely having time to look her in the eye properly before she's next to me on the dance floor with her hand on my shoulder. I secure my arm around her waist and we flow effortlessly into the circle of dancing couples.

It still wasn't enough. I slipped my hands down, found my way through his open suit jacket. His skin was even hotter through the thin fabric of his tight shirt, and I slid my hands around his waist to hold his back. And that's when I felt the bumps under the fabric.
“Found this on the floor”, he said, laughter hidden in his voice. “Must have forgotten it when you danced.”
She smiled. “Yes. Don't tell him.”

seems to get stuck in his airways, and he clears his throat to get rid of it. He's too stunned to think of an answer quickly enough –
“Like what?”
Sherlock pauses. “What is ‘this’?”

The former dance floor was a sea with rows upon rows of suited men, sharp in black and white. Suits, shirts, hats, gloves. Shining black shoes. Eyes wide, mouths ajar, they consumed the colours presented to them like a buffet. None of them had ever seen anything quite like this.
When the door shut, he stood on weak legs, pulled the sweat-smelling dressing gown closer around himself and walked to the large mirror on the wall.
“Problem?”
Sherlock opens his mouth on a trembling breath. But John is not in a hurry. He tastes Sherlock's lips, sliding them slowly between his own. Caressing kisses that gradually claim more of his mouth, gradually move deeper. When their tongues finally touch, a persistent heat is rising in Sherlock's cheeks.
I frowned at him. There was something off about him, something in the way he moved that I didn't recognise at all. He looked up at me from the bed with docile eyes, his lips still obviously pursed.
The twentieth year, John makes sure he is thoroughly equipped for Rosie's puberty. He buys every sort of menstrual hygiene product he can find (and the number of options shocks him, but he pulls through). He raises the question of having the Talk, but Sherlock rolls his eyes and tells John he took care of that eight years ago.
“Can't. No time.” Irene simply went back to her shoelaces, but Sherlock went on: “If the message doesn't get through, Moriarty will not be pleased. Might tear up the contract.” She paused her hands again, shooting him a glare which he answered with a smirk. “Come on, John”, he said and went for the door.
John finds that taking Sherlock's hand in return helps in many situations. It's like turning on a switch, making Sherlock suddenly compliant when he's in the middle of a fight with Anderson. After a while, John dares to take his hand just to reassure himself before they throw themselves into danger, knowing they're in it together. John likes to think that Sherlock gets injured less since they started doing this.
The words came hesitantly at first, but grew more certain with the reassuring sound of pattering keys.
They made their way through the suits to one of the side doors. Sherlock's arms dangled over his head at an uncomfortable angle. His hat had fallen from his head, making him look strangely naked with his black hair slicked back to expose his unconscious face.
Right.
John asks. It's blunt and greedy. He is staring at me as though the answer might be written in my pupils. In a metaphorical sense, I suppose it is.
The women in the corner broke apart. One of them might have been the brunette I'd seen dragging Sherlock into the house. When she saw him, she threw her long, pale arm across his shoulders and gave him a wide, lipstick-thick smile. He looked somewhat pained, not smiling back, and the woman whose hand had just been under the hem of the brunette's short skirt looked put out. The brunette didn't seem to notice or care, just said something to Sherlock that he answered with an uncomfortable grimace of a smile.
Sherlock shakes himself, terrified of where these thoughts are taking him.
“Bees are inspiring creatures”, William agrees. He doesn't outright praise my handiwork, but something tells me this is the closest to a compliment you get from him. His long forefinger keeps stroking one of the tiny bees.
“Astute observation, John”, Sherlock said absent-mindedly, rising on his toes and reaching for a massive book on the top shelf.
“You have certainly been…

“Perhaps
I need to get to the hospital. I need to feel the quiet weight of her and know that she is real.
John    09:35
When I turn to sit down and rest my legs for a bit, I see that William is here. I didn't notice him coming. These days there's always a little jolt of happiness in my stomach whenever I see him, and I walk up to him, fighting an unexpected impulse to give him a hug. We share a few words; he tells me that Soling Jacob isn't coming tonight. Instead, William is going to play solo.
“I mean, a relationship doesn’t
He doesn't ask me for news on Morstan, which is good. I don't have any, and the fact that he doesn't ask means he doesn't expect me to solve her case. I already knew he wouldn't, of course; she did put a bullet in me, after all.
Sherlock continues in a louder voice, attempting to ignore John’s laugh: “Toast sausages in the fireplace.”

“This show is going to be spectacular”, Stamford said, eyeing me until I looked up.
Now, hours after sunset, the water dripping from the rooftops has formed icicles. I think my ears might just have done the same.
I heaved in a breath through my nose. My head spun from the rush of
Then suddenly Sherlock Holmes is gone and, just like that, so is John Watson.
It's the kind of night that never ends, and never should. It's one a.m. and the restaurant looks dingy, but by God, the dim sum is good. The bottom third of the door handle. What do you know. John's mouth twists into a smile – it's so easy to smile tonight.
you.”
John goes to the bathroom and I lower myself onto the sofa. This is absolutely fantastic. The sounds of someone else running water in the sink; the sensation of John's compact and reassuring presence within these walls; and then her, lying in the cradle as if she's always been a part of 221B.
I let out a half-laugh. “What, you want to ditch your writer for me? No.”
“No”, he sobbed when Moriarty threw him down onto the bed.
“Ohhhh, that feels good.” Sherlock’s voice sounds floating and strange.
John licks Sherlock’s neck and Sherlock’s body arches. John runs his hand across Sherlock’s torso. “Oh, you must have been starving.”
Holmes stopped by the doors to the theatre, watching the building of the stage. The air felt palpable, filled with the inevitability of the audience that would soon step into our private bubble. Dressed-up strangers coming to devour our work of love.
I turned back to Sherlock. He was still panting hard from our song. His eyes were glassy. When he saw my triumphant happiness, he couldn't help a faint smile, though it seemed to cost him valuable strength.
to marry. With me.”
I peer at the strange creature who has appeared out of nowhere in the night, stomped into my room, lain down in my bed; and now lies here hissing and quibbling, seeming for all the world as though I have dragged him here against his will.
saw him, to be honest.
The cold wind hit him in the face, cooling his thin silk clothes. He spread his arms, and with the blowing wind it was almost like flying. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying not to want it. He willed the wind to sweep my words away, to keep his heart hard and stiff.
him… how can you do that to him?”
“No?” His face was at once terrifying. “And what gives you the right to say that? Have you ever lived on the street?”
“What's that?”
you are? How lucky I am to have you even as a friend?”
“You're the most ridiculous man!” I gasped, collapsing onto the bed next to him. “Why did you hide

hurt you again.
“Sherlock, that's you, isn't it?” Stamford said, trying admirably not to laugh.
When the silence was growing uncomfortable, there were hard steps on the floor, and Holmes appeared from one of the shadowed alcoves.
“Yeah, you have. Right before you ran away from hugging me…”
“She could never do what Sherlock does.”
I wanted to shut out what Stamford had said about Sherlock. But he had filled me with doubt. And there was only one way to be sure.
Listen to
John    14:34
He gives it to her.
You don't need to be nervous, love.
Sherlock    19:42
“You have to go.”
They spring into motion as one. John starts wrestling with the jumper he threw to the floor in a tangle. Sherlock snatches up his suit jacket and slips into the bathroom.
To the relentless beat from Soling Jacob's fiddle, I make sure to use every halling-trick I know. The audience claps in time throughout my whole solo, making it easy to ignore the burn in my muscles. William doesn't clap, but he's watching me. I can feel the weight of his scrutiny like a stone on my shoulders. And that, even more than the applause, spurs me on and makes me feel even stronger.
There were rustling clothes, rushed steps and a hurried “Thank you, Martha”. Sherlock burst out of his dressing room, tall and royal in a black velvet dress.
Well, you were.
(See the end of the chapter for
While the film plays, their bodies melt together until there is no air between them. Sherlock is silent the whole movie. When John realises that he doesn't even scoff at the plot holes, he has to duck a smile into Sherlock's hair.
I don't know what that word is doing to me. I did it slowly, just to keep that word tumbling out of him.
“Minsk”, Sherlock bites.
Sherlock stares at the ceiling. It has cracks in it.
When she was in the kitchen, I went to the fireplace as usual. She still has that picture of us from my birthday all those years ago, with my goofy smile and Sherlock's shining eyes. We were so in love. Always have been.
undersea-rainbow eyes. unseeing rainbow eyes.
Sherlock    14:08
John closes his eyes when Sherlock's nose touches his. No one can ever take this from him. He wants there to be nothing else in the world than Sherlock's nose nuzzling his. Sherlock's hands stroke his back so softly, and it feels as though every muscle of his body gives out at the same time.
No, get home and let me.
I raised my hand to my face, pressing thumb and forefinger against my eye sockets.
Sherlock pulled himself together to act, scoffed in mockery. “Mycroft, don't be ridiculous.”
“Yes of course, the writer”, Sherlock said, plastering a smile onto his face. “We were just reading the script.”
John    16:54
Sherlock pauses by the bed and removes his clothes, everything but his underpants. John grins sleepily. It occurs to Sherlock that he should feel self-conscious about stripping like this in front of someone else – especially his best friend – especially someone he has not yet had sex with (although that one is debatable). He would have, were it anyone else.
yourself?
. Sherlock's thin body is shaking with cold, and he buries his face in John's neck, making himself smaller.
We cannot get a dog together. SH
He made a little pirouette, turning on the spot with his eyes on my hand. Then he looked up at me from a frame of black eyeliner and mascara.
sent    18:35
“John”, a deep voice mumbles into his palm, soft lips brushing the sensitive skin.
“John”, William breathes when the night is motionless and dark. “I can't get enough of you.” This time I am lying with him on top of the blankets, fully clothed. I twirl his hair around my fingers. He closes his eyes and moans quietly. “I don't know what to do.”
Stambro Mikael stumbles off the dance floor just then. I grab his arm.
Sherlock was sitting up against the headboard, wearing his blue dressing gown. His arm was curled protectively over his chest and he kept his eyes averted. He coughed.
Sometimes John is curious about what it would feel like if Sherlock's lips lingered. Sometimes he thinks he wants that to happen, because there are few parts of Sherlock's body that aren't his yet. He doesn't want all of it, of course, he doesn't want it sexually – this is on a level far deeper than sex. He has never experienced it before, he's not sure there are even words for it.
We hadn't been sitting there for long before a door banged open and Sherlock's choreographer stormed out, tears in his eyes. I watched him hurry out of the building and raised my eyebrows at Stamford.
Sherlock squirms on the sofa; the leather makes his back sweaty. “Deserving it will not make it happen.”
“Ungrateful boy”, Holmes spat. “I have built this entire show around you. I found you a patron who will do anything for you. In return, I only ask that you do your job.”
Once I'd started to move, I instinctively knew that I needed to be faster. It was like a clock jolting to life inside me, ticking loudly and telling me that every second was critical. I was back in the army, where I would just
“John.”
John looks at him, just far away enough to be able to focus on John's face. His eyes look ice-blue in the strange lighting. They watch John intently as if trying to take him apart, as if he's the only thing in the world worth the effort. Having this gaze directed at him is a high that never dulls.
, and
John can't even look at him in the back seat of the cab, because he's just too damn adorable. And then Sherlock's low rumble joins in with John's giggles, and suddenly it isn't John's laughter that makes him unable to breathe.
smiled, and it was reckless, really, because he'd never done so before. I loved it. And then he opened a door, pushed me into an empty room and swallowed my breath with his kisses.
“John”, was his answer, and the rest of it was without words.
He kept humming when he was getting dressed and I was making breakfast. He ate what I put before him, and he didn't sing then but it was as if the notes were still clinging to him. To his face, glowing with the winter sunlight, to his body's cosy movements inside a fresh grey shirt and his burgundy dressing gown, to his hair curling with damp.
”, Molly read, marking the end of what I had written so far.
Inexplicably, this causes Sherlock's mouth to fall open. The breath he fought to catch rushes out of him. A tingle in his lower belly swirls downwards.
“You mean
I ignored him. He stayed anyway, and he should get credit for that, really, because the smell must have been awful in here. Eventually he approached me – bravely, I might add – and gave me a glass of water, which I accepted without looking at him.
Oh God. SH
“Tomorrow is our last morning here. I have to save it until then, or we will never make it.”
“I want that.”
“Sorry! I forgot my hat-”, Moriarty's voice said, and Sherlock and I didn't have time to do more than look up before the man stood in the doorway.
“Oh God, you're so hard from that…”
Sherlock closed his eyes again. They sat like that until the fever had subsided, the tears had stilled, and the sun was rising on the last day.
There is a love that defies everything. There is a love without laws, and a love without limits. There is a love that knows no borders, not even those of time, of life and death. There is a love that will live forever.
Sherlock frowns deeply at the sock in his hand. “Organising my sock index.” He puts it neatly on the back of the couch to his left, where a few other socks are laid out carefully. Then he picks up a new one from a pile.
He lifted his hands and started playing. The first notes were soft and slow, almost tentative, but they were a stable enough foundation when I filled my lungs and started singing.
“But this is something else, Sherlock. This is not what friends do.”
by Paul Francis Webster and Sammy Fain
Well that didn't save you from torture, or whatever the hell happened to you!
At the same time I feel hollow. I walk around, work, eat, talk to people, laugh, and it just echoes inside me.
No. SH
“Oh, there's been noises all day. I tried to offer him tea at noon but I don't think he noticed me.”
. Her bedroom door has been shut for two hours when Sherlock comes home, and John has resigned himself to reading a book in his armchair. Rosie has stopped crying when she silently enters the living room, walks up to Sherlock and asks him if he wants to become her real father.
As soon as he starts talking again, Sherlock moves his fingers. He slowly traces the hem of John’s boxer briefs with one light finger, nearly feeling the heat of John’s trapped privates through the thin fabric. John soldiers on:
There's something in the way his voice pours smooth and low into the word
I snort, mostly because I wonder how William manages to make even words like that sound alluring. “Either that, or you're just a coward.”
“I can't-” I gasped. I pressed my face into the crease of his thigh, breathing hard, kissing his shaft with open mouth when I could achieve enough presence of mind to do so. “I'm sorry, you- You're so- oh-”
John’s laugh subsides. “We should do that. You and me.”
Sherlock frowns. “How is this relevant? I have made an important scientific discovery, it is a crucial piece of data for the future science of deduction, and you want to talk about your boring clinic work?”
