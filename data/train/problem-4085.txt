"Then what is it?"
He grudgingly releases Castiel to peer into his face. Castiel looks almost shy as he looks up at him through his dark lashes, like he still can’t believe what’s going on—Dean doesn’t really blame him because neither can he. Still, his lips are quirked up, crooked and tentative, but genuinely pleased.
him. Castiel loves
Realizing he’s not getting anywhere, Dean tries to soften his approach. He uncrosses his arms and walks up to the angel. “C’mon, Cas. We’re worried about you, man.”
“I gotta check in with Sam about a case.” Dean’s voice comes out thick with emotion, but he rambles on in hopes that Castiel won’t comment on it, “You wanna keep watching the movie?”
Dean can’t deny the whirl of panic that accompanies the statement. It’s out in the open now; Dean Winchester loves Castiel, a man, an angel. His throat feels tight all over again, his cheeks heat up, and his gaze shifts to the floor between him and Castiel. To the flower, innocently laying on the floor—a stark reminder of what Dean almost lost.
Dean looks between the kitoushi and the pouch, confusion etched in his face.
He’s a little unsteady when he rises to his feet, gently shrugging Castiel’s hand off of him. He tries to keep the action subtle, but he doesn’t miss Castiel’s jaw tighten as he does so. He watches Castiel’s long fingers slowly curl into a fist.
Dean’s grip tightens on the back of the chair he was leaning on.
you.”
“Well, kind of. A person can only catch Hanahaki Disease if they’re, uh, in love.” Dean’s body jerks from where his elbow slips on the arm rest.
Dean raises his arms, palms outward, as he slowly walks toward the cabin. While he can’t see the girl, she also doesn’t tell him to stop, so he keeps going.
Dean jerks his head side-to-side, which has Misaki barrelling on like a dog on a scent.
Sam huffs through flared nostrils, his arms now folded over his chest. "I didn't expect you to react like this.” He sounds disappointed, which is what finally brings Dean to look at him.
“When I was first asking around our contacts about Hanahaki, there was one name that kept coming up—Misaki. She’s a
“He’s getting worse, Sammy,” Dean mutters, unable to keep the tremor out of his voice. His brother walks up beside him and places a warm palm against his shoulder. “I can’t… I can’t watch him—not like this. I, I gotta do something.”
Days pass, their research leads nowhere, and Castiel keeps getting sicker. He’ll be fine one moment and be doubled down in a fit of coughs the next. The symptoms seem to be progressing faster than it had in the first week after he’d been cursed, and Dean can no longer deny that it scares the shit out of him. His heart sinks every time he sees those fucking petals spill out of Cas, and he thinks he wouldn’t mind going without seeing another flower for the rest of his life if it meant Cas no longer had to spit them up.
He considers letting him know about his revelation like this—praying his confession in hopes that someone’s listening. But as terrified as he is, Dean needs to do this in person. He needs to look Castiel in the eye, make sure he understands.
Sam glares at him, “I’m going to let that slide for now because this is about Cas. Dean, you aren’t seeing the way he looks at you. I just… I can’t believe it could be anyone
him all the more unbearable. If only it were true. If only the sparkle in those blue eyes meant something more. If only it was Dean. Then, then—
Dean’s chest tightens at the thought. “Well shit. So how do we cure it?”
Castiel turns around to look at him again, his piercing eyes stare straight into Dean’s. They’re a little warmer this time, like
He hears the front door open as he gets out of Baby, leaving just the screen door between him and this mysterious kitoushi. He can only see her vague shadow through the screen, but he hears the unmistakable click of a gun safety being released.
“...he’s extremely caring,” he starts, and immediately Dean’s heart sinks when he hears Cas refer to the person as a ‘he’. But he buries the pain under a tight smile, encouraging him to keep talking. Castiel continues quietly, a worrisome whistle accompanies each of his exhales. His eyes, bright even in the dim lighting, seem to grow warmer as he chooses his words. Dean can’t stop the twinge of jealousy that twists his stomach into knots, but he listens attentively.
Misaki nods. “Yes, have you told him your feelings?”
Castiel, for his part, looks stunned. Blue eyes wide in the disbelief at Dean freely talking about
He flees before Castiel can say another word.
Dean swallows around the knot in his throat and bows his head.
Instead of going to help Sam, Dean drops off his bowl in the kitchen and rushes to leave the bunker, taking the steps two at a time. He thinks he hears Sam call his name from the library as he stomps up the stairs, but he doesn’t give it any thought. Air. He needs air.
He turns on his heel and rushes out the cabin before he can break anything. He knows Misaki’s watching him, but he can’t stop the flood of emotions from overflowing. He lets out a guttural yell, something between a groan and a scream, and crashes his fist against the closest tree. He stands there, shoulders heaving from the outburst, forehead resting on his fist leaning on the tree, trying and failing to figure out what comes next. What this means for Castiel.
As difficult as it is to admit, it’s the only thing he’s certain of right now. And if there's any chance in hell that it may save the angel, then he’d rather love Cas and have him eventually resent him than lose him entirely.
. It must show on his face, because Castiel dramatically rolls his eyes as he moves to get up. He wobbles a little when he tries to stand, but Dean’s right there to catch him.
“Do you remember what you told me the witch said when she cursed Cas?”
“I love you, Cas.”
“Nothing, just… I love you. And I guess I don’t need to stop myself from feeling it anymore.”
). He failed (
It’s not that Dean doesn’t trust Castiel to hold his own in a fight against a witch, but she’s weasled her way into gaining his trust. What if she catches him off guard? From the victims they’ve encountered during the case, they know she has a sick mind and a skillset to match, and Dean can’t stop the fleeting visions that keep popping up in his head of a bloody Cas being tossed around by dark magic.
someone else. Dean feels his heart crack all over again as his lips twist into a painful grimace.
But of course, it isn’t fine. Because Castiel won’t talk to Dean, and that just doesn’t sit right with him.
She doesn’t stop Dean from crossing her yard, but the lack of rustling behind the door tells Dean that she most likely still has a gun pointed at him. He slows down as he nears the door.
comforting
“Cas!” He tries again, back against the wall as he’s about to round the corner. He angles his flashlight to get a peek and finds another dusty hallway leading to a dead end. Frustrated, he clicks his tongue, regretting splitting up with Sam in order to cover more ground. He almost turns back around when he hears a noise. He stills, his Colt at the ready, loaded with 6 rounds of witch-killing bullets. He quiets his breathing, pooling all his focus into trying to pick up another sound. It isn’t long before Dean hears another noise.
It isn’t like he’s heartbroken. Even if he thought Castiel
“Hanahaki disease.”
Lex Luthor is screaming on screen, and it’s just one too many sounds for Dean to be able to focus. He pauses the movie and turns his full attention back to Castiel, whose shoulders are still heaving, but he seems to at least be able to take in drags of air now.
“What?” Dean asks.
Dean ignores the sharp sting in his chest and brushes off the question, “Apparently.”
The short hissing exhale that Castiel releases is clearly disgruntled, and Dean doesn’t know whether he might cry or laugh.
“Apparently you needed to know it for it to be true,” Dean half-explains before he lunges forward to wrap the angel (
“Yes,”
Castiel smiles—he’s been doing that a lot more these days—and follows.
“Dean, how far away are you?” Sam doesn’t even greet him when he answers the call, and Dean knows things aren’t good.
). His voice is tinny as he presses on, “—if it’s me… Cas, if it could be me, then you’ve got me, man. I’m yours. Always have been from the moment you dragged me out of Hell.”
these words impossible.
His throat tightens as he speaks, barely able to get the words out, because if this doesn’t work (
There’s a soft smile on her face when she leans back in her chair, food almost gone. “I can tell how much you care for him.” The
“You found something, Sammy?” Dean wastes no time getting to the point once he’s out of earshot of Castiel. Sam’s tracing a map with his fingers, eyes focused in a way that tells Dean he’s got some sort of a lead. For the first time since Castiel’s diagnosis, Dean feels a flare of hope.
“...why are you doing this, Cas?” He hates how feeble the words come out.
“Dammit, Sammy. Just spit it out,” he huffs impatiently.
“Dean,” Castiel sags into his grasp, his face tilting in towards Dean’s palm. Dean feels his own breath catch, and he takes a second to take stock in his body to make sure that the witch didn’t try anything with him.
“Cas,” he tries again, “if there’s even a possibility that we can cure this thing by telling her—”
There’s a world out there with monsters and demons and all sorts of big bads to fight. But in this single moment, all Dean knows is the feeling of Castiel’s lips on his own.
“Yes, the flower that was growing in my lungs,” Castiel replies easily, as if the words don’t still twist at Dean’s stomach in tiny pinches.
“That’s the thing. The only known cure is for the person’s love to be requited.” Sam shifts uncomfortably in his seat, as if to anticipate Dean’s reaction.
Dean tenses, hands halting from where it was about to start chopping onions. His eyes glaze over as he purposely tries
Castiel doesn’t reply. He doesn’t even look at Dean; his blue eyes downcast, mouth pulled in a tight line.
“Son of a bitch!” Dean holsters his gun and pulls out his knife instead, jamming it into the groove along the edge of the panel. He maneuvers it like a lever, roughly pounding at the handle, and to his surprise, it does the trick. He hears a loud crack and the panel swings off its hinges.
For the first time since they started this conversation, Sam looks uncomfortable as he finally looks up from the laptop. Dean leans in closer from the seat beside Sam, eager to see what he’s reading on the screen.
“What the fuck.” The whisper escapes his mouth without thought. He pockets a few to bring back to Sam, hastily straightening out the areas he’s investigated.
“It’s just a scratchy throat. I’ll get myself some water,” Castiel mumbles from behind his hand between heaves of breath and quickly disappears toward the kitchen, leaving a confused Dean and Sam in his wake. Dean’s eyes dart to his brother and he raises his eyebrows as he gestures toward the direction Cas walked away.
“Dean, please.” He sounds exhausted, his back slouched like he can’t quite hold himself up straight. Castiel cradles his head in his hands, and Dean can’t help but be concerned at the state of his best friend. His hand twitches on his lap, fighting the urge to reach out and comfort the angel, but Dean isn’t sure if his touch would be welcome. Instead, he stays seated on the bed.
“Yet we’re supposed to believe that Lois Lane cannot tell that they are the same person? That’s implausible.” The unexpected comment elicits a surprised bark of laughter from Dean, causing some of his chili to end up on his shirt. Castiel crinkles his nose disapprovingly, to which Dean responds with a full-mouthed grin. The look of disgust on the angel’s face is replaced with something softer, an amused glint in his eyes.
“Dean—” Castiel’s voice is raspy, his throat no doubt scratched up by expelling the plant, but it does nothing to deter from the reverence that fills the single syllable. How did Dean never hear it before? Finally, as if he’s just coming back to himself, Castiel narrows his eyes in a squint. He tilts his head, clearly confused, and Dean feels his heart swell at the familiar gesture. “—you, how did you…? But I thought you didn’t...”
“Cas, that isn’t—” he finally pushes himself up from the bed, unable to hold back any longer, and reaches out to grab Castiel by the shoulder.
"Angels are genderless, right? So it would make sense that gender isn’t part of the equation when they feel attraction, either." Dean is still processing that information while Sam continues, "maybe he got defensive because you assumed the person was a woman."
“I’m fine, Dean. She said
“Feeling alright, there?” He kneels down next to him, hand back on his shoulder, brows creasing when Castiel lets out a tiny cough.
Castiel frowns, “I thought it was beautiful. And, uh.” The blush spreads high to his cheeks. “It reminds me of how we came to be lovers.”
“And the person Cas is in love with—”
“We should go find Sammy. Let him know you’re as good as new,” says Dean, finally wrenching his eyes away from his... boyfriend? Partner? (They’ll sort out details later.) But he keeps his arm wrapped securely around him.
"It, uh, isn't me," is all he manages to get out, his voice thick with emotion.
“Dean, I’m sure. You should have gone for the amulet,” he huffs gruffly. With clear annoyance he adds, “or shot her.”
"Well his family is a bunch of dicks," retorts Dean with a shake of his head. He avoids making eye contact with his brother, his brain working fast to figure out a way to get Sam off of this line of thinking.
Dean narrows his eyes first at Sam, then at the offending flower. “What do you mean?”
“Unless he’s in close proximity to his loved one.”
Dean immediately puts his bowl down and rushes to Castiel’s side, his hand patting his blanketed back. The violent heaves don’t seem to stop, each painful choke producing yet another batch of petals. Dean drags over the garbage bin he keeps by the chairs so Castiel can throw the petals away, and watches with a detached calmness as the soft petals flutter into the bin. The white looks bright under the blue-tinged glow of the TV, a stark contrast to the plain black bin.
“...sounds like a hell of a guy,” is all he can make out—his remaining awareness is focused on trying not to let any tears flow outward. He takes a shaky inhale, and adds weakly, “Hate seeing you in pain like this, buddy.”
Castiel regards him with his usual scowl, squinting slightly as if he’s trying to solve Dean like a puzzle. The light catches him just at the right angle where those blue eyes seem to glow under the fluorescents. It’s the kind of look that gets Dean a bit hot under the collar, and—shit, he’s doing that staring thing again. Dean can rarely bring himself to look away when he finds himself under the angel’s scrutiny. He stares right back, as if he’s goading (begging?) Castiel to figure him out; equal parts curious and terrified of what Castiel might find in his gaze.
In times that he struggled to do so, Dean had found some sense of closure in his belief that angels couldn’t love. At least not in the same way that humans could—they didn’t have the right “equipment”. He convinced himself that everyone was better off if his feelings for Castiel were kept as those of friendship, of family, of brotherhood. Something that the angel could understand, something he could reciprocate.
“We don’t know that!” His voice rises enough that one of Castiel’s eyebrows arch disapprovingly.
“You don’t have to tell me who it is, but uh, you seem to think this one’s worth putting yourself through hell for. So tell me what makes ‘em so special?”
That gets all three of them back into action. Dean still keeps a close eye on Castiel, but other than a few hems here and there, he really does seem fine; no more aggressive coughing fits or desperate gasps for air. So against his better judgement, Dean drops the matter—for now.
“Come on, sweetheart.” Dean plucks the glass out of Castiel’s hands. “Maybe we can get this stem to grow into a bush next year.” He winks as he starts up the stairs.
It starts with a soft and hesitant brushing of their lips. As if they’re both testing this out, making sure it’s what they want (as if Dean hasn’t imagined this—and more—late at night, in his weakest, most vulnerable moments). But when he hears Castiel’s silent gasp as their lips part, he can’t help but go in for more. Their lips slot together perfectly, and Dean feels a jolt of electricity run up his spine.
, and yet…
His fingers snake back to tangle with Castiel’s unruly hair; a gentle tug eliciting a soft moan from the angel. Encouraged, Dean nips at Castiel’s bottom lip, relishing in the feel of Castiel’s plush lips between his teeth. The brush of Cas’ hand up his back has him feeling lightheaded, like he’s floating. Now that Castiel is caught up with the program, he gives as good as he gets. He curls his hand around the back of Dean’s neck and angles his head to delve deeper, pulling Dean closer to the bed he lies on. Dean’s practically leaning over Castiel in bed when he feels the soft wetness of Castiel’s tongue and—
As he reaches out to place his palm on Castiel’s shoulder, he watches Cas’ eyes follow his movements. He can almost pinpoint the moment it starts—a crease forms between the angel’s eyes, his shoulders tense, and he releases a single deep cough.
“You should let Cas know you’re heading out,” is all Sam says when he finally responds. The words are gentle, kind in a way that somehow feels patronizing and encouraging at the same time. Dean just nods, not trusting his own voice.
Dean can’t bring himself to reply immediately—he feels the familiar heat of tears building as he thinks again:
"What?"
“I can look into it, but we don’t have a lot to go on… do you think you could drag a bit more out of him?”
He brings his dinner to the Dean Cave, where Castiel is intently watching
“Hey, sunshine.” Dean shoots him a wry grin, hoping that the angel didn’t pick up more of the conversation than he let on.
The garbage bin by the desk is holding what looks like tissues covered in blood. He kneels down to take a closer look and finds that they aren’t actually tissues at all. Dean reaches into the bin carefully, fingering through the white and red...
No, the words make sense, but Dean’s brain is overcome with a heavy haze that seems to have made
Dean feels his world come to a halt. And there lies the crux of his newfound revelation (if Sam's hunch is true). If Castiel feels attraction to men, then that means he could have loved Dean but he
Castiel leans over the edge of the bed, and flower petals start spilling out of the corners of his mouth like he can’t contain them any longer. His shoulders quake as Castiel’s body can’t seem to decide whether to inhale or exhale; Dean can almost
Castiel furrows his brows, but it’s pretty clear that he’s amused by this concept.
“No,” he interjects, not willing to hear any excuses as to why Castiel seems to be fine with the idea of just choking on a fucking flower. “I don’t know what your deal is, but we aren’t giving this up without a fight.”
“Dean, please.” Castiel stops him. “I’ve made up my mind. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some research to do.” Castiel stands swiftly, slipping out of Dean’s grip (Dean only now realizes his hands still rested on the angel’s back). He strides out of the room and disappears down the hallway, and Dean is left kneeling on the floor like an idiot, unable to ignore the stinging sense of rejection he feels in his wake.
in a way that lingers in the air between them. “He always has.”
. Sam’s voice echoes unhelpfully through Dean’s short-circuited brain. He can feel Sam’s stare as he takes a minute to process this information.
“Dean,” Cas starts, pulling him back to the present.
, dude,” Dean mocks his brother playfully before turning to Castiel. “How are we supposed to…”
With that spelled out, Dean's eyes darted up to meet his brother's. He never once considered the possibility that Castiel might be attracted to men, and if he's completely honest with himself, he isn't sure how he feels about that. Because if Castiel can feel attraction to men, that means...
She walks him to the front door, distractedly straightening up the knick-knacks on her shelves as she goes. Dean sees her pick up a small pouch; bright red-orange with golden embroidery throughout. It has a short string loop attached to the top of it and Dean briefly wonders what it is.
? He picks one up and confirms that they are white flower petals, with smatterings of deep red staining each one he sees. Dean’s eyes dart back to the garbage bin that’s full of the petals, and he feels a chill run up his spine.
“Dean, what if it’s you?” Sam questions, there’s a kind urgency to his voice that Dean finds gratingly placating.
“Kind of,” Dean hedges. Sam’s eyebrows pop up, his skepticism clear. “Listen, anytime I try to talk to him, he bails. Not my fault, the guy’s a natural Houdini.” He shrugs, hoping it masks how much the rejection actually affects him.
Dean grumbles something that’s close enough to an assent, and only pauses when they get to the door.
“Ain’t gonna happen,” he turns back to the counter, hoping that Sam will take it as the dismissal it is. Of course, he doesn’t.
Sam scoffs. “Coughing up flower petals seems pretty specific. It wasn’t hard for me to connect the dots.”
His voice is gruffer than usual when he finally opens his mouth, "so you think Cas is in love with a dude.”
“Dude.” Dean tries to put on his most disapproving voice.
“Cas got hit by some spell. We aren’t sure what it is yet, but otherwise we’re good.” Already turning back to return to Castiel, Dean gives him a hasty rundown.
The angel, to absolutely no one’s surprise, is not forthcoming about the supposed love of his life who may determine his fate.
“So if you knew about her from the get-go why are you just now telling me about her?” He can’t help the frustration that seeps into his voice. It’s been two weeks since Castiel started deteriorating, and anyone with eyes could see that he’s at the tail end of the disease at this point.
“I gotta do this, Sam.” Dean’s voice is soft with a small quiver that he doesn’t even have the capacity to feel ashamed of anymore. “I can’t just sit here and do nothing—just, watch him get weaker and weaker. I can’t.”
It’s more distinct this time, like a muffled grunt, and Dean’s on the move. He can’t pinpoint where the noise is coming from, but he figures there has to be a hidden entryway somewhere. He starts knocking on the walls methodically, struggling to keep the rising panic at bay. He’s just about to give up, to run back around and find another entrance when he hears the distinct echo of a hollow panel. He huffs out a celebratory laugh.
Sam hesitates before answering, “He’s barely lucid. I… I’m not sure how much longer he has. How far away are you?”
“I don’t understand,” Castiel muses, startling Dean out of his reverie. He’s grateful for the dark as he feels a blush creep up his neck, and he gets settled in the second recliner.
“Clark Kent is Superman with glasses,” Castiel points his attention toward Dean, eyes entirely serious. Under the deep husky tone, Dean hears the now-familiar rasp of his scratchy throat. He wouldn’t be surprised if another fit was coming soon. Dean cocks his head with narrowed eyes, ignoring the dread that pools in his gut at the thought of Castiel puking up more flowers. He brings a spoonful of chili to his mouth to distract himself.
“Any luck with Rowena?” Dean asks in an attempt to steer the conversation.
Because it isn’t Dean. It can’t be Dean, because Castiel is sick, and if it were Dean, then Dean could fix him.
Dean might be offended if he weren’t so relieved, but in the moment the words only make him hold on tighter. “C’mon, Cas. You know it wouldn’t have worked if it weren’t true.”
. A familiar emotion spreads in Dean’s chest along with an acute sense of panic that seems to always go hand-in-hand with it. Dean breaks eye contact, letting his eyes swim across the room. His hand lifts to rub at the back of his neck.
Even after Sam leaves, Dean stands with his hand hovering over the handle. He lets his eyes fall shut as he takes a centering breath. He reminds himself what’s at stake.
—an endless refrain running through his head. The angel who always fought by their side, who sacrificed so much for them. He’s the last person who deserves this fate. With a grunt, Dean swings a fist at the nearest object he can find (a tree, and it doesn’t give Dean much satisfaction).
“He’s a good man, determined to be righteous in a world that’s built for humans to fail in. He stands up for what he believes is right, and will always protect the ones he cares for. He’s loved and respected by everyone who knows him, and I’ve never met a man more deserving of that love and respect… I never thought I could feel in this way—
“You love me,” he whispers.
“According to the lore, yeah.”
Dean Winchester. But Castiel doesn’t seem to mind. In a wordless “yes”, he angles his head ever-so-slightly, giving Dean better access. Dean leans in slowly, gently pulling Castiel toward him as he does so. Not wanting to wait any longer than he has to.
“What is it?” Castiel tilts his head toward him. Dean turns his head to drop a peck on the other man’s temple, catching him by surprise.
There’s that stinging heat at the back of his eyes and a somewhat delirious, nervous energy thrumming right below his skin. With a trembling huff of half-laughter, half-sigh, he cradles Castiel’s face with both hands.
The silence drags on for another second.
Dean’s mouth pulls into a tight line. “We don’t know what she did to you, Cas.”
. How could he ever compete with such clear devotion? Any remaining hope, any tiny speck of
“I’m reading more into the myth,” Sam says, carefully sidestepping Dean’s outburst, “but I still don’t see anything about a cure aside from what we’ve already found.”
“I don’t know if you heard us, Cas. Hanahaki? Coughing up petals til you
“Better than new,” Castiel adds, eyes adoring.
He was never allowed to love who he wanted, convinced that he had to
? For a dreadful minute the possibility of Castiel being in love with his brother passes through his brain, but Misaki (thankfully) interrupts him before he could take the thought any further.
to help? Cas doesn’t even drink water!”
“But if it
. If it were up to him, he’d gank the bitch right now. But he doesn’t know what sort of spell she may have cast on Castiel or how to fix it, and he isn’t sure if he’s willing to take that risk. He’s about to open his mouth again, when he catches Castiel double over coughing from the corner of his eyes.
Castiel looks at him with unfocused eyes. hazy, but still impossibly blue. His parted lips look even drier than usual (Dean shouldn’t really know what Castiel’s lips
His brother winces, “According to the lore… yeah.”
“Please tell me she’s nearby.”
“Dea—” Castiel whimpers his name on a shaky exhale. It’s basically all Castiel can manage at this point—huffed out fragments of words, and Dean is immediately by his side. He picks up Castiel’s hand, almost by habit now, and his lips quirk up in an attempt to smile.
As he steps further inside, the smell of incense is overpowered by the smell of food cooking, and Misaki’s question belatedly computes in his brain. He must have barged in close to dinnertime. Whatever’s cooking smells unfamiliar but heavenly, and while food was the farthest thing from Dean’s mind, his stomach decides it’s the perfect time to let its presence be known. Misaki grins and gestures toward a seat at her table.
"No, Sammy. I don't—listen, let's just cut the chick flick crap and figure out a way to save the guy, okay?"
with a curious tilt to his head. He’s looking more casual than ever, ditching his trenchcoat in favor for a blanket wrapped tightly around him (because Dean managed convinced him that it was common knowledge that blanket burritos help with sickness, supernatural or not), and he still has that signature pinch between his eyes as he watches Superman kick ass on screen. The glow of the movie lights up his profile sporadically, highlighting his strong jaw and high cheekbones.
“Do you think Cas would tell us? He hasn’t really been forthcoming with his Hanahaki,” Sam adds worriedly.
Dean can’t wipe the smirk off his face—something about a blanket-burritoed Cas asking him a serious question about Superman and Lois Lane just seems to do that to him—as he tries to settle back into his recliner, the looming stress of Cas’ illness alleviated for the moment.
“Stay—” he manages to wheeze out.
it was a set up.
More than once, he asks Castiel to tell him the name of the man, thinking that perhaps having him here might bring Castiel some comfort. But every time Castiel shakes his head, smiling sadly. He doesn’t actually seem sad—not usually at least—he seems resigned to his fate, but not unhappy. Dean sees unexpected serenity in his eyes. Like the calm of an ocean after a storm. Like Castiel is at peace with his choice.
“You good?” Sam asks, “I saw her with the amulet and I thought--”
“Okay, okay,” Dean starts without fully finishing his mouthful, “but who wouldn’t be distracted by a badass like Superman?”
Even the breaths he takes make him feel sick. It’s been a few days since Castiel could draw a deep breath.
The bedroom is dark aside from the small lamp that sits on the nightstand. The musty scent of dying flowers permeates the air; it scents of death with a hint of floral sweetness. The hissing, choppy breaths that fill the silence immediately tell Dean that the angel is still kicking, and in turn he breathes a little easier—how fucked up is that?
“Specifically, it catches if they’re in unrequited love.”
“Hanahaki, the flower petals, they are a manifestation of unspoken words. If Castiel doesn’t know you’re in love with him, if he honestly believes that his love is unrequited, then his health will continue to deteriorate. It’s all about perceived requittal! The unrequited love is what may kill, but the silence is what tightens the rope.” She sounds excited now, her hands waving around as she talks. “The curse of Hanahaki, at its most successful, is two-fold. Castiel shoulders the curse because he doesn’t want to burden you, and you are also tortured through having to watch your love suffer.”
“‘mpossible,” Cas replies with a rasp.
“I’m what?”
“Shit, Sam!” Dean’s up in an instant, Castiel standing beside him. He shoves the angel back down by his shoulder, “you stay here until we’re sure the spell didn’t do lasting damage!”
“I think so,” he whispers.
“And second,” Dean interrupts before Castiel can finish his thought, “We aren’t keeping your haunted death flower.”
Ice settles in Dean’s gut, and he feels his shoulder drop with Misaki’s words.
"Does the idea of Cas having romantic feelings for you make you
“Well, it isn’t totally uncommon knowledge,” Castiel straightens his back as he repeats Sam’s words. But his brows slant downward when Dean doesn’t reply immediately, looking somewhat embarrassed.
“Are you Misaki?” He asks, hoping his voice comes across more friendly than desperate.
“Sammy’ll take good care of you while I’m gone, and, uh, I’ll be back before you know it, ‘kay? You won’t even know I’m gone.”
“Just like that? Aren’t you worried I’m lying or possessed or something?”
with Castiel is different. Real, in so many ways that his previous attachments have felt superficial or fleeting. While Dean is a firm believer that people should be able to love wherever they fucking choose, when it comes to himself—… let’s just say that if someone spends enough time knocking into you who you should or shouldn’t be, then it becomes second nature to believe them.
“Cas?” He calls out, uncertain. He thinks he may have heard a hitch in Cas’ breathing, but when he walks up to the bed, Castiel seems to be unconscious. His brows knit together in pain, his lips curl down at the end in a thin scowl, and his chest jerks rapidly with every breath he tries to take.
“Doesn’t love him back,” Sam responds with a confidence that sends Dean reeling.
“I’ll keep looking into the lore,” Sam turns to Dean as he talks, knowing already that Dean’s the one who needs convincing. “I think we have some copies of Bobby’s old translations of Japanese mythology somewhere. I’ll dig around for those.”
That seems to get a reaction out of the angel. The deep crease that forms between his brows openly broadcasts his displeasure. He opens his mouth, probably to object, but all that comes out is a violent coughing fit accompanied by another batch of blood-stained petals. Castiel’s chest heaves with each cough, soon his entire body is convulsing with each attempt to take in a lungful of air. Dean squeezes Castiel’s hand, leaning in helplessly as his friend struggles. When the hacking finally subsides, Castiel looks back at him, a thin sheen of sweat covers his forehead; the physical exertion obviously taking a toll on his weakening body.
“Yeah, me too,” he replies, hastily clasping his brother’s shoulder as he rushes past him. Sam follows him as they make their way to Castiel’s room.
“Are you sure, Dean? We don’t know how much more time Cas has…” Sam asks again, with that look of pity in his eyes that makes Dean’s stomach twitch uneasily.
“I’ll make you a plate, I was just about to sit down myself, and I always make extra for leftovers.”
A different kind of fear grips his heart.
Sam nods. “Apparently the best in the continental US. Any sort of Eastern, especially Japanese, curse, monster, demon, she’s the expert.”
At least now that his Hanahaki is out in the open, Castiel doesn’t seem to be avoiding Dean anymore. In turn, Dean has been trying to spend more time with the angel; if Castiel won’t let him help cure him, he’ll at least be there to offer comfort as a friend. Castiel either doesn’t notice or doesn’t mind how needy Dean has become, readily allowing the soft touches and constant proximity. If anything, he seems to enjoy the company, although he clearly doesn’t appreciate the doting.
He lets his sentence trail off, unable to even speak the words. His jaw clenches so tight it’s almost painful. Neither says another word and Dean goes back to chopping onions just to break the silence.
, and the thought brings a goofy smile to his face.
There’s a beat. Castiel’s body stops shaking, and Dean fears that he didn’t hear his words, that Dean was too late. The tears are flowing freely now—there’s nothing he can do to stop them.
Sam doesn’t say anything; he only stares at him with a pained expression as Dean tries to get his emotions back in check. Dean clears his throat before continuing, his voice still thinner than it’s usual cadence, grating to his own ears.
“What?” Misaki looks up at him, confused. “But you must know who it is.”
“While I appreciate what you’re doing, it isn’t necessary,” he mumbles to the brothers, who have cornered him in his room. Dean sits on the unused bed, impatiently dragging his hands through his hair. Sam, arms crossed over his chest, is standing by Castiel, who’s sitting at his desk. There’s a slight pallor to his normally tanned skin, but other than that, he mostly looks like his grumpy self. He’s angled away from Dean and Sam, as if he’s trying to put an end to the conversation, but Dean is having none of that.
“I’ll try…” Dean considers this, thinking of all the unsuccessful attempts he’s made thus far, “Might have to do some extra digging.”
“I love you too, Dean.”
Wordlessly, his fingers trace the lines of the angel’s face. From his forehead, to his temple, to the line of his cheeks, to his sharp jaw… he cups Castiel’s jaw with his hand, letting his thumb gently rub the ridge of his cheekbones. Castiel’s eyes fall closed, his long lashes fanning out over his cheekbones, and he releases a soft, whistling sigh. And he’s so close, so pliant under his hand—Dean could just, lean in, and…
Castiel’s eyes sag at the edges. He reaches an arm out, hesitating slightly before clasping his hand on Dean’s shoulder. It’s meant to be comforting, Dean knows. And to a certain degree it is, but after hearing Castiel declare his love for another man that could never be Dean, it feels like a hollow imitation of the touch that Dean actually craves.
Dean thinks he hears his heart break.
Sam’s eyes widen a fraction before he answers carefully, as if he’s picking each word deliberately, “Dean… he always stares at you... weird.” He emphasizes
As soon as he steps outside he breathes in a lungful of fresh air. Fall is well on its way, and the evening air is crisp even with the constant hint of dirt and musk from the old power plant. Dean continues to take long breaths, willing his heart rate to even out with little success.
“Did you… take the Hanahaki flower and put it in
“But Dean, you told me he’s not well, and that it’s been less than three weeks. Hanahaki doesn’t progress that quickly unless—” She halts, contemplating the implications of what Dean’s telling her. Dean is alert, leaning toward the kitoushi now—for the first time since Castiel’s gotten sick, he feels like they’re on the precipice of a breakthrough.
Sam looks up at him with clear apprehension. “Do what, exactly?”
? We’re trying to help,” he grouses. Castiel responds with a deep sigh, and knowing now that he’s struggling to breathe, Dean can hear the slight wheeze that’s laced in the exhale.
“Another dead end. That’s just perfect,” he jeers as he takes a sip of his beer. A brief silence befalls the room.
He sees it on the table at the center of the room, innocuously placed between the three of them. Just a matter of who gets there first. Dean’s planning his next move when Castiel breaks out in an especially violent coughing fit.
Dean hates it.
Castiel sighs, “Fine. I won’t keep it in my room.”
Dean shakes his head, “he won’t say.”
“First of all, don’t say
Sam nods in that placating way where Dean can hear the clear ‘but’ that’s about to follow.
It's obvious that Sam has more to say, but to his credit (and to Dean's immense relief), he relents and gets back to his research.
“Dean, does he know how you feel?” Her doe-eyes are shining excitedly as they look up at Dean.
“His love remains unrequited?”
“A little over two weeks.”
a certain way. He thinks of his failed relationships. Can he even really love Castiel the way he wishes he could? Would Castiel come to regret loving a man who couldn’t give him everything the angel deserves? Dean almost wonders if Castiel would be better off without him before he remembers that the alternative would be death. And fuck, it may be selfish, but Dean loves Castiel.
“All the more reason to at least attempt the ‘make her fall in love with you’ plan,” Dean suggests again, and Castiel’s eyes bore into him with a look of annoyance mixed with something he can’t quite place his finger on. After a short silence, Castiel looks away.
Dean’s brain comes to a halt. But that can’t be right because they haven’t had any guests in the bunker since Castiel got sick; it’s only been Dean and Sam.
“Yeah, well… When enough of your friends die, you think you’d get used to it eventually… but Cas, fuck. Cas gave up so much for us. He deserves to be happy, and I just can’t, I won’t—” the words get lodged, deep in his throat. He sighs, “If he’d at least tell us who it is, maybe we could try to help.”
"Wh, what? Sam, how could you—no!" Dean splutters. It’s the furthest thing from the truth, and the fact that Sam thinks he could be so bigoted has his hackles raised.
“Are you coming back?” Castiel asks, eyeing Dean as he picks up his still-full chili bowl.
If he thought Castiel’s smile from earlier was bright, the one he points at Dean now is downright criminal. Dean can feel his cheeks heat as he takes in Castiel’s kiss-swollen lips, pink cheeks, and disheveled hair. He almost feels smug at the thought that he’s the one who made Cas look like
Castiel nods solemnly. “Thank you, Sam. I’ll continue my research as well.”
Sam looks up at Dean from where he sits at the table, a fork full of leafy greens midway to his mouth, and narrows his eyes.
The 6-hour car ride passes by in more like just shy of five (with a thankful lack of cops to pull him over), and Dean soon finds himself carefully driving Baby up a dirt road through the outskirts of the Ozarks. He curses each pothole that causes a puff of dust to rise around the car as he pulls up to a simple cabin hidden by the trees that surround it. The sun is setting, streaks of gold, orange, and red find their way through the cracks between the trees, and Dean can see a warm glow through the windows of the cabin; a sign that someone’s home.
“In that case I might go back to my room,” Cas replies, his voice purposefully impassive.
“My friend has Hanahaki,” he blurts out without preamble. The hand ladling hot soup into a small bowl halts briefly before Misaki continues dishing out food. “So I appreciate the offer, but I can’t stay. I was hoping you could help him.”
Then Castiel’s body jerks. Violently. The choking sounds even worse than when this fit began, and Dean can only watch in horror as the scene unfolds.
look like) as they twitch with effort to breathe. Suddenly Dean feels his resolve crumble, wondering if he
“Pretty sure you can’t convince someone to love you, Sam,” Dean repeats Castiel’s words quietly. “Cas needs his family, he needs us. What good’s going to come from someone he trusts as his friend blindsiding him like that? Why make him feel guilty in what might be his last…”
Sam pins him with a triumphant smirk. “She’s nearby.”
“Yeah,” he finally chokes out. “Yeah, I do.”
Dean’s face twists into a sneer, “Yeah, right. Because I’m such a prize.”
Which is when Castiel starts coughing.
“You're Not the one he’s avoiding like the fucking plague,” he points out, exasperated.
Castiel squints at him, looking suspicious of Dean’s intentions (which is understandable, considering Dean can’t be sure of his own intentions either), but tucks his chin. For a moment, he looks so small under his blanket. It’s ridiculous, since the man is almost as tall as Dean. But there’s something childlike in the way his shoulders slouch and he glances downward, dejected—resigned.
They stand there for a while. A few seconds that feel like minutes, hours, days, looking into each others’ eyes. All the fear and shame that clung to Dean so stubbornly washes away, finding salvation in the truth that lives in those sparkling blues—Dean wonders how he never saw it before, in all those times he spent looking at Castiel’s eyes.
Sam scoffs, “It’s not totally uncommon knowledge, Dean.”
“Yes, Dean?” Castiel walks into the room, unhurried despite Dean’s frantic tone.
Dean sneaks a peek at Castiel, who beams down at the single Gardenia that is now neatly planted in the grounds by their home.
“I may still be fairly new at this, but even I know that you can’t convince someone to love you.” His voice is barely above a whisper and tinted with so much sadness that it hits Dean like a ton of bricks.
“What?” He asks. He brings a spoonful of chili up to his mouth.
“Excuse me,” his voice is rough as sandpaper when he apologizes, and he’s suddenly in a small coughing fit as he angles away from Dean’s hand.
“He was coughing when the witch got him with that dust! And since when do angels just get ‘scratchy throats’ and need
So whatever complicated mess of emotions that Dean felt for Cas, that just needed to be sealed in a locked box in a dusty corner of his heart. Dean did just that.
But no.
Castiel honest-to-god pouts. His pink lips stick out slightly, and Dean has the sudden urge to kiss the damn frown off his face and give him everything he wants.
It’s the most honest he’s ever been, in regards to his feelings for the angel, but Dean can still barely get the words out, as if that would make the dire situation any more real.
Slowly, Castiel’s lips pull even wider. His eyes crinkle at the edges, and Dean (ironically) gets the breath knocked out of him by the brightest smile he’s ever seen on the normally stoic angel.
With that, Sam rushes out of the room, leaving Dean alone with Castiel. It isn’t the first time they’re alone since the witch hunt, but it’s the first time Dean feels like the angel’s not going to immediately disappear on him.
It's the easiest Dean has ever admitted his feelings, albeit in a roundabout way. Each confession making the next feel a little less terrifying. Misaki replies with a sad smile.
“Cas, is that…?” Dean asks with wide eyes, horrified.
“Dean?”
“Dean, I’m serious. This could be bad,” urges Sam.
“Whoa, you alright there, buddy?” Dean’s hand switches trajectory and starts patting the angel on the back instead, but the coughing fit doesn’t seem to subside.
Dean racks his brain trying to decipher the unfamiliar term. “Like a Japanese shaman?”
Dean huffs out a watery laugh. He unclasps one hand to bring it to Castiel’s face, gently wiping away a droplet of sweat that runs down his forehead.
“Right,” he rasps out as he tries to make sense of the words.
in this way—but he taught me that I could. Even before I knew what love was, I loved him.”
“Hey, buddy, you awake?” As he nears the bed, Dean sees the spread of flower petals that Cas can no longer catch as they continue to spew out of his lungs, splattered around Castiel’s pillow. The sight brings bile to Dean’s mouth.
to think of the way Castiel looks at him—because thinking about the possibility of Castiel looking at him like he’s anything special, as if he’s deserving of even the notion, makes the fact that it
It wasn’t him (
He can hear his heartbeat in his ears when he urges her on, “What?”
“What? Why do you think he’ll talk to me if he won’t talk to you?”
Cas is going to die.
“Cool. I’ll, uh, see you later, then.”
“Yeah well, happy endings never really were my thing.”
? Dean’s stomach drops.
, but what if he changes his mind when he hears how you feel?”
“That fucking bitch,” Dean mutters under his breath.
“Goodbye, Dean! Good luck with that angel of yours. For his sake, I hope I’m wrong about him.” She has the audacity to wink at him before rushing out the door, and for a moment Dean considers taking the “fuck it” approach he’s well known for and charging at her. But then he hears Castiel’s labored breathing and before he knows it, he’s crouched down at Cas’ side.
“There you are, sweetheart.” The endearment slips out by accident, as if the thought itself is letting Dean know it’s time to say the words, urging him on to let go. Castiel’s brow twitches when he hears it, and the next thing Dean knows he’s curled up into a ball, lurching forward with an alarming choking noise. Castiel clearly isn’t getting enough air in his lungs to even cough anymore, so he just convulses in the bed instead. Dean’s heart drops to his stomach.
“Hey!” His hands are steady as they train his gun on the witch, but he’s distracted by the sight of Castiel clutching at his chest. “What did you do to him?!”
“She lives completely off the grid, Dean,” insists Sam. “I’ve been trying to track her down this whole time, and I finally found her.” His brother’s hazel eyes are bright when they finally look up at him, determined in a way Dean hasn’t seen since Cas got sick. Dean leans over Sam’s shoulder, glancing over the area of the map he was tracing earlier.
Every pat on the shoulder, every
“Son of a bitch!” He braces himself for another blow—he’s been tossed around by his fair share of witches—but it never comes. Instead, with a flip of her wrist the bitch brings the amulet flying into her grasp.
catch,” the witch smiles, clearly enjoying watching the two squirm, “then killing me isn’t going to save him, Dean. This is old school stuff. Ancient magic.”
So instead, he hits the gas a little harder and stares straight ahead.
Dean stands there for a short while (just long enough that he can get away with it, he tells himself), trying to engrain every feature into memory. His untamed hair, scruffy five-o’clock shadow, straight nose, chapped lips, long lashes—
with Castiel. Why is he even considering this?
She shrugs, “I can usually tell.” Misaki turns back into her home, trusting Dean to follow.
"Like what?"
, Cas changed the pronoun to
“So… if Cas is hacking up bloody potpourri, that means he’s in love.” The statement comes out slowly, like Dean is testing out the idea.
“You know about me?” Dean’s eyebrows arch at the unexpected reply.
“Nah, I should get some research done tonight. I’ve been slacking a bit,” he regrets the implication—as if spending time with Castiel is in any way a negative, but before Dean can explain, Castiel looks away. From his angle, Dean can’t see his features in the shadow cast over his face by the TV.
“You feel alright? You can breathe normally and all?”
“Oh come on, Dean. You know exactly what.”
) then Castiel may be breathing his last breaths right in front of Dean (
“Who are you, and what do you want?” Her voice is calm and confident, forceful in a way that tells Dean this isn’t her first rodeo. There’s just a faint remnant of an accent that wraps around her vowels, as if her mouth is questioning the sounds she creates. Her words are anything but questioning.
“Dean, did it—oh SHIT.”
Dean feels Castiel’s fingers twitch in his hands, and his eyes dart up to meet infinite blue. Castiel’s eyes are trained on him, shockingly clear for someone who otherwise seems to be on his deathbed. His irises shake with the struggle for air, but he’s there, and he’s listening.
Dean enters as he knocks, both not expecting an answer and also too impatient to wait. His stomach is in knots and it’s either that sickly sweet smell of death or his nerves that are making him want to keel over and hurl the contents of his stomach. The thumping of his heart echoes in his ears so loudly that it almost drains out the weak wheezing of Castiel’s breathing; each inhale is barely a gasp.
"I just know!" He snaps.
“Here, take this.” Misaki holds up the small pouch she just picked up off her shelf.
He kneels by Castiel’s chair without ever lifting his touch from the man. “I got you, man. You’re okay, I got you,” he mutters helplessly. Then finally, Dean sees a speck of white and red between Castiel’s fingers that are cupped over his mouth. They seem to fill his hand with each wet cough.
“No, I can breathe fine now, and I don’t sense any lingering effects,” he concludes.
“Okay, well… have you tried asking him about it?” Sam suggests, a sigh mixed in with his accusatory tone.
Castiel crooks his head, giving this some thought, and nods earnestly. “I see your point.”
“I understand you want to get back to him quickly, but you have to take care of yourself as well. You have to eat anyway, so why not have a healthy meal before you head back out? Come, tell me about your friend.”
Dean kneels next to the bed, digging out his friend’s hand from under the sheets and grasping it tightly. He leans in, ducking his chin and bringing his clasped hands up to his forehead (what good is praying to an angel who’s right in front of you?). He clenches his eyes shut anyway.
So in conclusion: that soul crushing feeling he’s feeling right now? Definitely not heartbreak.
Dean drops Castiel’s hand like he’s been burnt. He thinks he hears a small hitch in Castiel’s strangled wheeze, but by the time Dean can even question it, his breath evens back out to his shallow hisses. Sam pokes his head into the room, looking anxious as he jerks his head to beckon Dean to the library. Dean nods without a word, but turns back to the angel before leaving.
“Our lil’ baby in a trenchcoat is all grown up and in love, got it. So what’s the cure?” Dean’s voice sounds thin and strained, but thankfully, Sam either doesn’t notice or is happy to ignore it because he looks back down at the laptop.
He looks down to his brother, who seems confused but doesn’t try to further question Dean’s claims.
So he just sits with him, helplessly. He tries to comfort Castiel himself, as best he can, which is the excuse he gives himself the first time he holds Castiel’s hand in his. Castiel doesn’t seem to mind. If anything, the tender smile that shines through his eyes the first time Dean does it convinces Dean it’s worth the embarrassment. It becomes part of his routine when he sits beside Castiel. He sits down, takes his hand, leans in close and talks. He tells Castiel stories, and Cas huffs and wheezes in response the best he can as he listens along. If Castiel starts coughing, he uses his open hand to rub gentle circles on his back, but he never lets go of Cas’ hand when it’s just the two of them.
Dean opens his mouth to object, but Castiel is so earnest about this, he can’t bring himself to do so. Castiel picks up the glass he chose as his makeshift vase and heads out of the room with Dean following closely behind.
But Sam isn’t offended, or even surprised. He points a weary smile Dean’s way and nods. “Yeah, of course. I’ll wait in the break room.”
"I think it's possible. And uh, I don't know, Dean… if I were to guess," Sam's eyes are shifting uncomfortably, wandering from one corner of the room to another, and it puts Dean further on edge. "I feel like the logical choice would be, well… you."
Just like that, the panic abates. He brings his eyes back to Castiel, who watches him patiently with warm, glistening eyes. And for a moment, because it’s something Dean can do without shame now, Dean lets himself get lost in the endless blue of Castiel’s eyes and takes a deep breath.
Misaki chuckles, “I doubt you’d find anyone involved in this business who doesn’t know you or your brother.”
“Dean, I don’t know if ‘may or may not work’ is going to cut it at this point,” Sam cuts him off.
Apprehension brews in Dean’s gut as he hears Castiel take in a labored breath. His eyes dart toward his brother, desperate for back up, but Sam’s just sadly watching Castiel’s slumped shoulders. Apparently he’s the only one willing to fight for Cas’ life.
“So, uh, Sam may have found something—someone who might be able to help. She’s not too far, but I gotta go see her in person.”
, but before he can say anything else, they hear a gunshot in the distance.
“I’m fine,” is what finally comes out.
“Clearly it isn’t, Sam. Because the guy keeps getting worse and there’s nothing we can do about it,” he lets out an exasperated sigh, rounding his shoulders with it just to emphasize how done he is with this conversation, but Sam isn’t backing down.
Relief is finally catching up to Dean as a smile spreads on his face. The panic from the moment before is replaced by giddiness because the roots of Castiel’s Hanahaki are lying on the floor, and that can only mean one thing.
“Dude. You can’t just pout and get your way any time we have an argument.”
It’s been a week since the witch incident, and Castiel has been acting strange. He’s been opting to spend more time alone than not, or with Sam over Dean (and no, Dean is
“Cas?” He barely finishes saying his name, eyes darting toward him, when he hears a rushed incantation and his gun is forcefully flung out of his hands.
Sam shakes his head, shoulders slumped. “From the sounds of it, most witches don’t even know of Hanahaki. Those that do, only know it as ancient natural magic—untouchable stuff.”
“That’s right. And he was coughing up a storm back when it happened, too,” Dean remembers.
Castiel’s breathing starts to even out after that. His shoulders heave with each shaky breath, but the coughing stops. He looks resigned as he slowly opens his clenched fist to reveal a handful of bloodstained white petals. Dean feels the blood drain from his face.
"If it were me he wouldn't be sick in the first place, okay?!" He blurts out with a shout. He wants to take the words back as soon as he says them, but it's too late. There’s only a brief pause before understanding dawns on Sam's face. Understanding, followed by surprise, then sadness. Everything Dean didn't want. He doesn't want Sam's pity. He needs Sam to be on his game. To find a way to save Castiel.
They sit down to eat at Misaki’s simple wooden table. An array of food is laid out, and Dean’s mouth waters despite himself. “Miso soup, rice, ginger pork, and salad,” she pointed each out to him when she noticed him staring at the unfamiliar dishes. Misaki drives the conversation, asking Dean questions about Castiel, expertly drawing stories out of him as they go.
“Hannah-what?”
angel) into a tight hug. “Fuck, you scared the shit out of me, Cas. I thought I lost you.”
Dean tosses his phone on the passenger seat and focuses back on the road. Except the more he tries not to think about Castiel deteriorating alone in his bed (he knows Sam’s with him, but it doesn’t feel right that Dean isn’t), the more suffocating the inside of his beloved Baby feels. His knuckles are white around the steering wheel, and it takes excruciating effort to relax his shoulders.
To say Dean was getting desperate was an understatement.
A fluster of feelings attacks the hunter at once: anger, frustration, despair, grief.
The idea hits him then. It’s been a while since he’s done it, and apprehension seeps into his mind even as he puts together the words.
Misaki looks apologetic as she explains, “The symptoms don’t regress, Dean.”
It’s far worse than any of the other times Dean has heard it. Even worse than that night when he first got cursed. He’s clearly struggling to catch his breath, wheezing between each convulsion that accompanies the hacking. Dean feels utterly useless, unable to do much more than rub Castiel’s back, frantically whispering words of comfort under his breath.
“Cas, you hear me?” He starts, hesitant (can an angel half comatose still hear prayers?). “I know you ain’t feeling so hot right now, but I hope you can still hear me. You gotta hang in there, okay, buddy? I’m almost home, and you can’t… I’m not letting you go. You got that? So listen to Sammy and hang in there. I’ll be home before you know it.”
Sam sighs, but doesn’t argue. Instead he changes the subject to ask, “Did you get anything from the kitoushi?”
Sam points toward the text on the screen as he keeps reading. “If the disease is left untreated, the roots of the flower will grow to fill the lungs, causing asphyxiation.”
But, not for the first time, they didn’t catch it. Not until they got to the warehouse where they tracked the witch, broke up into two groups with Castiel and the insistent bitch protecting the amulet the witch was supposedly after, and Dean and Sam busting into a room where they found the body of the witch they’ve been hunting, long cold. It only took a moment for Sam and Dean to realize that the oddly helpful friendly neighborhood witch was, in fact, the witch on a murder spree in search of the amulet that was now right at the tip of her fingers. The only thing between her and her prize—one fallen angel of the Lord.
