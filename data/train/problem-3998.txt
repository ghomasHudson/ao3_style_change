“I’m on my way,” Jo says. Dean can hear her car engine rev through the phone. “I think I can be there in about an hour, can you wait that long?”
“Alright, there are three things in this ambulance that need to be restocked.” He ducks out of the back and steps down to the floor beside Jack. “I want you to tell me what they are.”
His prayer was answered. The awe he feels as he realizes it is only dampened by the doubts—after the hundreds of prayers he’s said in his life, why is now the time for a response? Would God really care about him, or is he fooling himself, and this is just another psychic premonition?
He snaps the laptop shut and sets it aside. He changes clothes, gets ready for bed, and even turns the light off before he pauses. After a moment’s hesitation, he kneels beside the bed and clasps his hands together like he used to when he was a kid.
“Yeah,” he says, somewhat grudgingly. As Dean pulls out the bottle of whiskey from the first aid kit and takes a swig himself, Sam adds, “Hey, let me ask you something. I didn’t see what happened back there, but… you took out three demons on your own. Like they were just regular monsters. I know I’m a little rusty, but even a year ago we couldn’t have done that without getting our asses handed to us. How’d you do it?”
Cas positions himself behind Dean on the leather seat, too nervous at first to put his arms around the man in front of him.
Dean swipes his blade toward Alastair's face. The demon catches Dean's wrist in one hand and starts to slowly clench his fingers around it. Dean's eyes widen as he hears the bones of his wrist crack and pain shoots up his arm. He's more human than he thought.
"Dean?" he asks quietly, when a full week has passed since what happened. It's growing dark out and Dean is sitting at the tiny table in their inn room, beer in hand.
Dean looks at him expressionlessly for a few seconds, then turns his right arm over and holds it out for Cas to see. "This. This happened."
"The muscles in your right leg were torn, you had a fractured rib, and your shoulder was dislocated. You should be fine now."
The girl hangs up, shaking her head. "Your boyfriend seemed confused; are you sure you want him instead of a hospital? I feel like I'm breaking some kind of law not getting you help."
Dean shakes his head and growls, "I don't want to become more human. I want to stop whatever traces of it I have in me."
“No, it’s fine. I don’t mind. I mean, I don’t care. Whatever.” Much more than yesterday, he’s suddenly aware of what a goddamn mess he is—he was able to shower, but not well, not to mention he’s in a shitty hospital gown, his hair is limp and flat on his forehead. He’s only gotten a glimpse of himself, but the burn on his lower face and neck might look even worse than the day before as the blisters get bigger.
Dean gives him a sad smile. "I want you to be. I wish I could tell you something to make it easier." He pauses. "If it helps, I've accepted this."
"No, Dean, I mean it." He lets go of Dean's hand so he can try to straighten up higher. "I still have to come to terms with this whole idea in the first place, but I—I will. Somehow. Give me a little time. Just until I'm out of this hospital and we can spend time together, just once, and then we'll say goodbye. Not here. Not while I'm stuck in this bed. I deserve better than that, or I like to think I do."
The angel's clever, but Dean saw it coming. He whirls around in time to block the angel's attack from behind. A few clashes of their blades and Dean sees his opening. He slashes a brutal cut into the angel's arm, which causes him to drop his blade and look down at the wound, some combination of a gasp and a cringe on his face. Dean grabs the wrist of the angel's wounded arm and twists it behind his back, kicking him behind the knee to make him fall. As he drops to his knees in the dirt, grunting in pain, Dean raises his knife above the angel's neck.
“My little sister,” the boy says. “She panics at loud noises sometimes and she probably didn’t follow everyone out, I have to—”
“She’s felt short of breath all morning,” the man says, “but it got bad really suddenly—she used her inhaler twice today and it didn’t touch it. I don’t know what’s happening.”
Jordan nods and opens the car door, then pauses to turn and offer a handshake. “Nice working with you, Dean.”
The demon spins around, catching Cas's knife arm and twisting it so hard any human's bone would crack as he uses his other hand to plunge a knife into Cas's chest.
There are a few people inside, but no one is in line, so Jack walks up to the counter, where Max has her back turned, pulling a shot of espresso. He waits until she turns around and sees him.
Cas stands in front of the dying pyre, watching the logs sputter out sparks. Sam left just minutes ago, but Cas decided to stay.
“This is so stupid.” Dean clears his throat and works, as he usually does so well, on bottling up his tears. “I’m fine, I swear.”
Dean rubs a hand over his face and rifles through the pile of books to see if there’s one he hasn’t checked by now. This part, the research—this was what Sam was always so good at. Give Dean something to kill and he’ll have it dead by the end of the day, but the research? His brother was the specialist there, and progress is slower now than it ever was during the two years they spent hunting the yellow-eyed demon.
Jo sighs and sits beside him on the hood, staring out at the highway as she takes a swig of beer. “Pretty much. But it’s the most freedom she’s given me yet, so.”
He’s been with the department for two months when the call comes out in mid-afternoon for a forty-eight-year-old female who fell off a ladder. Dispatch says she’s unresponsive. By the time Dean and Jack get on scene, she’s not breathing, and her daughter is kneeling above her, frantic and in tears.
"How else do you explain it, Sam Winchester?" He blinks and his eyes return to their normal shade of brown.
"As far…as far as I could drive in a couple hours. Away from anyone I could potentially hurt." His tone remains forcefully flat and lifeless.
Crowley's jaw clenches briefly. "You two," he says to the demons on either side of Alastair. "Leave us."
He glances over his shoulder, where he can see Dean out the front window. He's scowling—normal—and seems to be talking to someone—less normal—but Crowley can't see who it is.
Once inside, Sam sits in the armchair with a wince and Dean drops the first aid kit on the floor beside him.
"You don't have to summon me," Cas says, stepping away from him. "You can just pray and I'll be there."
He eyes the other patrons at the bar. It’s a weekday, so there aren’t many. A middle-aged couple, an elderly man, a heavily tattooed woman. Cas looks down at his drink and slowly spins the stem of the glass between his thumb and forefinger, the base rotating on the slick surface of the bar.
All in all, Sam feels there's a lot being kept from him. He just isn't sure if he actually wants to know the rest or not.
"You were born in Lawrence, Kansas. You were orphaned at the age of four and entered foster care until you were eleven years old. The foster father you had from when you were nine to when you were eleven had a habit of drinking too much. One day he was intoxicated while you were in the car and he got in a fatal accident. Dean Winchester died in the passenger seat of that vehicle."
Then he wakes up. He can feel the pain in his—Cas's—back, blooming, dragging him toward unconsciousness. He fights against it.
Cas starts the espresso machine and turns to Dean with a slight smile. “I didn’t invite you here to fix my oven.”
Cursing, towel still wrapped around his waist, he digs around in his duffel bag until he finds the least-dirty, least-smelly pair of jeans and t-shirt. He pulls the shirt on with some difficulty, because his shoulder seems to be getting worse.
"Alright," he says, racking his memories for somewhere—anywhere—he knew of. "I think I have an idea. But we won't be able to drive there."
"I got that part." Dean puts the cigarette between his index and middle fingers and pulls it away from his mouth. He puts his elbow on the knee of the leg he still has propped up, and he fixes the angel with a hard, calculating look. "Who are you?" His tone is low and threatening. "Why do you know my name?"
Dean shifts to try to see if he's feeling any better. His chest hurts a little less and feeling is starting to come back to his right arm, but it's uncomfortable. The scrape on his leg and the wound in his cheek don't seem to be improving.
Dean shakes his head and briefly breaks eye contact. "Do you have a death wish, Angel? Because you've been insistent on trying to help me, even though it's probably all for nothing and you're just putting yourself in danger. What are you trying to get out of this?"
"Sorry," Dean says quickly, pulling away and releasing Cas, who visibly relaxes. "Sorry. Nightmare."
Then, finally, Dean is standing at the bar watching Jo’s knife hit the same three square inches of wood over and over again when Sam steps into the Roadhouse. He stops just inside the door and looks at Dean. Jo pauses.
“Are you from around here, Dean?” Cas asks, gaze lingering on his colorful sleeve of tattoos before making its way back to Dean’s face.
The demon's first response is to cough again. He and Cas are only standing about a foot apart and drops of blood splatter onto Cas's shirt and trench coat, but he doesn't flinch.
. There are words in Enochian, though not nearly enough to capture the diversity of human souls.” He shakes his head, a smile touching the corners of his mouth. When Cas smiles—it’s not terribly common—he looks like he’s not quite sure if he’s allowed to do it, but it softens his face in a way that makes Dean’s gut seize up. “Your souls hide nothing. They’re everything you are, without any of your social performances or lies you tell yourselves or other obstructions.”
Sam starts and turns to face Crowley, who's standing in the middle of the room, arms crossed, staring at him.
Sam shrugs and tosses a washcloth onto the counter to clean spilled drops from previous customers. "This is one of the only bars in the area and I know most of the people who come in here. I'd never seen you until about a month ago and now you're here once a week."
Crowley tips his head to the side. "Not all souls who come to hell become demons. You know how there are different levels of torture. Hellhound deals land you at, say, level fifteen of twenty. You, with the Mark and…everything…would normally be a nineteen. But…that I could change. Eight or nine, maybe."
“Would you? Because you’re the most faithless person I’ve ever known, even more than Dad. You don’t believe in anything, Dean. You never have. That’s why I have to be the one to stop Lilith. If God wants me to do something, I’ll actually listen.”
“I already paid,” Eileen says, interrupting them. “When I said I was going to the bathroom, I had them charge it to my card.”
Two days and two nights have passed since Dean and Crowley had their argument. Dean's still in the same motel, though when he wakes up in the morning, he's not alone.
Suddenly, Cas feels something. "Why? You shouldn't be okay with it, Dean. You shouldn't be. This part of you—the you without the Mark—you don't deserve to die. Even as a demon, you still decided to break out of this cycle. You shouldn't have to die, and you definitely shouldn't have to go to hell."
"I don't know what to do about this," Dean says, pulling back his sleeve to show the Mark of Cain. "I tried resisting it. I can't. Even if I could, you're right. It's only going to drain me until I'm nothing. But before you say anything," he says quickly, as Crowley opens his mouth, "I'm not going back to killing for you. I can't. I won't. But you know more about this thing than anyone. Give me—give me something, Crowley."
Jack says nothing. Dean eventually looks down at his tablet and finishes entering information into his report. Then he looks back up.
He hears the front door of the apartment shut and Dean steps out from behind the shrubbery. He stares at the apartment for a few seconds before turning to Cas.
"Let's go," Dean responds, taking his angel's hand. He looks to Crowley, then meets Sam's eyes. He gives his brother a smile and Sam nods.
Dean looks at the ground for a long time. His expression holds the weight of the world and Crowley has a feeling they both already know what he's going to chose.
Dean hasn’t driven this Impala in years. Almost a decade now—since the last time he spoke to his father. He swore he’d get rid of it, but he hasn’t found it in himself to do it. For all this shit this car represents, he has a lot of good memories in it, too. It’s the closest he ever had to a stable home before he turned eighteen and took off, packing up his and Sam’s belongings in a single bag and driving as far away from their father as he could get.
"Hi," Cas echoes, then frowns as he realizes he just greeted him twice. "Um. Are you going somewhere?"
Twilight’s hint of color at the horizon has darkened, and stars are spattered across the sky. Dean sits on the hood and stares up at them for a moment, folding his arms against the ever-colder night air. There’s space for his thoughts under skies like this, sometimes too much space. But in the same, this car under a wide-open sky—it’s the only solace he’s ever known.
Jack takes a sip of his latte—white chocolate caramel is his favorite, usually reserved for times when he’s stressed or upset or generally in need of a pick-me-up—then carries it over to the table.
He can remember the old woman dead on the porch and the nasty gash on Balthazar's arm and the horrified look on the college girl's face when she turned and saw him—just saw him—standing there. Maybe that will be his motivation.
"It's because I haven't killed anything," Dean says. He's still on edge and he throws the towel back to the counter with unnecessary force.
"What would you have thought if I hadn't? Humans have a tendency to convince themselves they're insane. Or lie to themselves."
Dean’s eyebrows shoot upward, and for a moment he says nothing. Cas feels terrible, but he knows he’s right.
Dean ducks under the window to cross to the open doorway and sets his duffel bag carefully on the floor. Back against the wall just adjacent to the entry, he raises his pistol, racking the slide in time with the clang of the door to keep them from hearing him. They’ll see him the moment he steps into the doorway, so he’ll have to act fast.
Cas immediately feels a knot of dread and anger in his gut. He steps forward. "You told them, didn't you? I could be exiled for this—what did you tell them?"
Thankfully, Jack doesn’t seem to notice that any of this—Dean knows his father would call it feminine—worry is going on in his head.
"I've heard that so many times," Cas says, exasperated. "You agreed to this, Dean. You agreed to all of this."
He can hear pages flipping. “Not that I’m seein’. If you want to make your way over here, I’m happy to have you for a night or two. Last time you said you were gonna visit, you detoured over to Wyoming and never made it here.”
Sam smiles a bit and also shrugs. "I'm not sure what else to say. Like I said, my life isn't much to write home about."
Cas glares at him. "I hate that this is your solution. Doesn't death mean anything to you? Aren't you afraid of it?"
"I need—I need to tell you something." He pinches the bridge of his nose and wonders how he's going to explain this.
Anger starts to rise up in him. "Dean, this is only over because you're saying it's over. You still have a choice here. What exactly are you expecting to do? Go back to killing endlessly, like a monster? That's not you—"
"I can't fight it, Sam. I can't. I tried. Hell, I've been trying for the past—the better part of a year? There's no way this story ends where I'm human and we all live happily ever after. The Mark…doesn't work like that."
Cas could kill him right here just by touching him—if he's fast enough—but something about this demon strikes him and he remains still.
He pulls out of the lot and onto the main road. It takes him a moment to get used to the gas and brake pedals, and using a steering wheel feels a bit weird, but there's nothing complicated about it. Riding a motorcycle certainly requires more expertise.
This is the part Dean isn't certain how to say. "I want…I don't know, I'm guessing this is stupid at this point. But I want to…I wanna find out who my parents were." He glances at Cas, who has his head tipped to the side and a slight frown on his face. "I mean, I remember them, vaguely." He stares out the window. "My mom's name was Mary. She had long blonde hair and this…this beautiful smile. She'd sing me…I think it was Hey Jude," he says with a slight laugh, "instead of lullabies. And my dad…John. He was hard to make laugh, but Mom could always do it if she wanted. Sometimes he'd let me sit on his lap while he drove down our street, which I thought was just the coolest thing." He shakes his head. "He had this big black car from, like, the sixties. I don't really remember it, except that he loved it."
Crowley looks back up to Dean's face, his eyebrow lightly raised. It's only now that he realizes Dean doesn't just look bloody—he looks shaken. Broken. "Something's happened," Crowley says slowly.
Sam pushes away from the car. “It seems pretty useful to me, Dean. I can kill demons without hurting the people they’re possessing. Not just exorcise them. Kill them.”
Garth has already connected their lines and charged them by the time Dean and Jack have donned their SCBAs and are ready to go in.
Dean smirks. “You have no idea. Consider it an occupational hazard. I’ll try not to corrupt Jack, but no guarantees.”
“He told me to give you some space yesterday. I was going to visit you in the ED when I got discharged, but he thought you might need time to process everything.”
They come from all sides. The knife works on them—he slashes and stabs and tears as much as he can—but not well enough. In the harsh light, in the pure adrenaline, he can’t tell what blood is theirs and what is his.
Dean drops a match into the bowl of ingredients, which flare up instantly. As he waves the smoke away, Castiel appears in front of him.
Crowley can see the gears in Dean's brain turning. Then he looks up. "You would help me if I actually went through with this? You're not trying to stop me or convince me to come back—at all?"
But not to Cas, and that's why he can't return to heaven. He's managed to fall in love, and fall in love with a demon at that, and there could hardly be a higher offense to heaven.
Things were simple back in heaven. It always seemed easy to decide what to do. Decisions were always a matter of doing what he was told or doing what was best for the greater good. Even Cas, the one who'd never quite been the same the other angels, followed those rules.
"Slow down there," Dean says with a breathless chuckle. He coughs into his mouth and swallows the blood to hide it. "I was riding, she stepped out in front of me, I turned to avoid her and crashed. I'm fine, and I don't know why I'm not healing. I think I am, but slowly."
"Stop calling me that," he says, but Cas has lost him. His tone is flat and emotionless. "Dean Winchester is dead."
The gravel roads that lead out past the empty fields surrounding the town are rough and dark, as it's about twilight, but Dean's Scrambler can navigate it just fine. It's one of his favorite things about the bike; it can go almost anywhere.
Dean looks back to the water. "I'm not afraid of going to hell. I talked to Crowley a bit—I won't have the worst torture there. And I don't believe I'll let myself ever become a demon there. I think…I think if I tell Crowley I never want to be a demon, he might be able to help me on that front. So it won't be so bad. But I'll remember you, Castiel, and I'll miss you."
Cas shuts the passenger door and looks over to Dean, waiting. After a moment; "Why aren't we going anywhere?"
“You’re a hunter, right?” he asks. “That looked like a hunter’s journal, and the Irish folklore book… Hey, I’m a hunter too—or, I used to be. That’s why I was curious about what you were doing.”
"Of all the things you could've done," Dean says, a knife in each hand as he stalks toward Alastair, backing him toward the wall of a building, "you chose to confront me; and even worse, you chose to hurt Cas." He smirks. "That'll be the last mistake you ever make." Alastair tries to smoke out, but Dean stabs both blades into him, thrust up at an angle to hit his heart. For a moment, Alastair is frozen, his mouth open in his last attempt to flee, his eyes wide like a cornered animal's. Then he flickers with orange light and goes limp.
"Dammit," Dean mutters to himself once he's back topside, standing beside his motorcycle. Why did he ever make an agreement with Castiel that he was going to stop killing? It's a ridiculous notion. He meant what he said to Cas that day in Texas; killing is like a drug to him. He needs it. He craves it. The idea that he could purposefully choose not to kill something is absurd.
What a strange life. Tragedy hits when he's seven, taking his brother away from him. He grows up, moves on, almost graduates Stanford and then ends up working at bar instead. He meets a woman he felt he could've loved, only to have her move away. His supposedly-dead brother shows up, now a demon, or kind of, and he has this friend who's the king of hell who has hellhounds and this boyfriend who apparently is an angel. Then Sam finds out his sort of-demon brother is going to have to die, and is even choosing to do so.
When he's done, he decides it was surprisingly pointless, but this time he can see the appeal. It's relaxing, if nothing else.
“Lilith is the final seal. She dies, right there, after sixty-five seals have been broken, and Lucifer is free. Catch is, your brother has to be the one to do it.”
"Your wound must have already been treated?" Cas asks warily once he runs into Balthazar again in heaven.
He struggles, trying to push onto his hands and knees against the weight of whatever is on his back.
"Dean—I should tell you…I should tell you what you mean to me. I don't think I've—I've never really taken the time, I think, and—"
Cas grits his teeth, looking back and forth between the two. "From what I can tell, I'm more afraid of what you can make him do."
“I’m not, I’m not.” He draws his uninjured knee up toward his chest, resting his forearm on it and examining the label on the bourbon. “I’m not tryin’ to make you feel guilty about leaving or anything, I just… wonder how you do it.”
Sam’s expression is resigned. “Now, I’m going to start listening to God before either of us can get anyone else killed.” He turns away and walks to Bobby’s car.
"I don't want to be human, Cas," Dean says, and though Cas could be imagining it, he sounds almost pleading. "I don't want their obsessions, or their normality, or their social lives, or their…
"You're not human," she says, casually but with a hint of wariness. "Why else would you think you can heal in seconds and you be able to get here so quickly from a motel several minutes away without a car?" she asked, gesturing to each of them. "So…I'd say demons based on the powers, but obviously neither of you are demonic and they can't heal others, so…what is it?"
“Yeah, okay,” Sam says, still looking concerned. He pats Dean on the shoulder. “Maybe I should’ve done a half-milligram of Dilaudid instead of a full one.”
Would heaven ever consider letting him back in? They accepted Dean's soul, didn't they? What did that mean of Cas?
"Fine." Maybe that means he won't have to kill anything and won't have to start lying to Crowley yet.
He was the bartender there. He must have been. Dean had hardly spoken to him, since Crowley had been distracting him, but he remembers well enough.
A/N: this is set in a canon-divergent AU after season 2. Azazel is dead; Sam never died and Dean never had to sell his soul. Sam returns to Stanford and Dean goes on hunting alone. The apocalypse is on the horizon, but there are a few differences from canon which will become clear in the story...
Dean can’t argue with that part, but it still doesn’t make sense to him. “But why? What in the hell do I have to be not-fine about? My life is great—fuck, it’s better than I ever expected it to be, probably better than I deserve.”
"I know well enough," he lies. He wishes he could send demons to find Dean, but he knows that'd be nearly impossible. Dean's better than that.
"Hey," Dean says firmly, "don't give me that. You've done the best you can. Better. That's more than I could've asked for."
“If I survive the apocalypse,” he says quietly, looking at the liquor, “I’m so going to die of liver failure.”
Dean takes a deep breath and shakes his head. “Don’t worry about it, kid. I probably got the name wrong.”
"I saw the guilt in your eyes the last time we met, Dean. It was human. Do you want to make that any worse?"
She tracked the banshee into town, but lost it when it stopped killing for several days. It’s dormant for another week, during which Sam and Eileen meet a few times at the library to make sure they’re ready, and Sam embarrasses himself trying to sign to her.
"I can't tell you everything," Cas says carefully, "because I don't know. I've never encountered a demon like you. But I believe you feel different because you didn't kill that woman."
“Maybe. I don’t know. I barely know what day it is, don’t take anything I say seriously.” He glances back up at Cas. “Would that work? If I had been, would that’ve worked?”
Dean takes the folder, but his gaze doesn’t leave Jo’s face. “Your mom wants you to run your cases by me, doesn’t she?”
"I didn't make him do it, ever." Crowley's patience seems to be wearing thin, though his tone remains falsely slow and steady. "I asked him to, and he did. Always. He's fearless. Brutal. The perfect weapon. Even the hellhounds fear him."
"I don't know, Cas," Dean sighs. He stands up and goes to pull on a shirt. "Right now I'd like to think so, but…." He decides not to mention the fact that Crowley said he would die if he refrains from murder. "I don't even know if I'm going to keep the motivation to change my entire lifestyle."
And he remembers. Waking up in the early morning, drenched in sweat. The feeling of being suffocated, and of blood in his lungs, and of anger. He wanted to tear something apart, to hear it shatter or hear it scream. It was all the violent residue of the happiness, the contentment, the love, maybe, he'd felt the night before. With Cas so near, it had terrified him, and he'd left just like that. Then it was misery. Wandering around, hoping he wouldn't spontaneously kill someone, and eventually, alcohol.
“Okay, I’m coming.” He stands and puts a hand on Jack’s shoulder. “You’ll find your place, Jack, I promise. And until then, you always belong wherever I am, okay?”
He sighs and sits up, pushing the blanket off entirely and shivering once as the air sweeps over his skin. He gets up, pours himself a couple fingers of whiskey, then starts building a fire over the ashes of the one from the night before.
He stares at the words printed across the pen in his hand. There’s one thing he knows for certain, and it’s that he’s not going back to Stanford.
"Here," Crowley says, pulling a small notepad and pen out of his pocket and scribbling something down on it before setting it on the table beside Sam. "They looked good on you, by the way," he adds with a small nod to the glasses in Sam's hand.
Amelia says some last words to the bartender and Crowley realizes he must have missed something important. She has tears in her eyes now and he looks disappointed and sad. He steps out from behind the bar and gives her a hug.
She cringes and looks back. "It hit the lamppost back there. It's pretty smashed." She looks back to him. "You should be more worried about yourself. You're lucky you weren't thrown into traffic."
“Just wonderin’. Hunting’s a lot different when you’re on your own. It’s a lonely business, believe me. You never really had to do it alone.”
"Hellhound. Her name is Juliet and she's the one who nearly killed you. Those glasses have been scorched with holy fire, that's why you can see her."
A man approaches the site. He wears all black and has his hands in the pockets of his dress coat. He surveys the scene with utter apathy. He walks up to the passenger window of the hatchback and looks across inside. The woman in the driver's seat is bloodied and still, and surrounded in jagged pieces of glass and metal. She's been dead for several minutes now.
Dean wakes up with the headache of a lifetime. He moans and rolls over, his mind momentarily empty of what happened yesterday. He feels like his head is going to violently split open. This is a whole new kind of hangover. Demons can handle alcohol quite well, and Dean always drank it fairly regularly. Regularly, but usually in moderation. He was a weapon that couldn't afford to be dulled.
Jack watches his dad tamp coffee into the basket and lock the handle into the machine. When his back is turned, Jack says, “I don’t think my partner likes me very much.”
“You stubborn son of a bitch,” it says with its vessel’s female voice. “I guess I’ll kill you slow, then.”
He watches the sky for a moment in silence before his gaze travels down to Cas’s silhouette against the stars.
"Yes," Dean says, finally. "Yeah, I am. But honestly, what would this whole being human thing be if I weren't scared to die?"
"No. Dear god, no. I don't—I don't need proof. And I certainly don't need to take a trip to hell with a demon."
“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts,” Cas says again, eyes glowing, his voice distorted, as if multiple people were speaking at once. He wipes the blood from his face, and his voice returns to normal. “I am not your guardian angel, Dean. My mission was never to protect you.”
"Buddy…" Sam complains, lowering his book. Riot's been on edge for weeks now, especially since his shoulder got wounded, so this behavior isn't unusual.
“I don’t know.” Dean shakes his head and digs the toe of his boot into the gravel. “You’re just gonna get yourself killed.”
When he gets back hours later, Dean's car is in the parking lot. Still, no red flags. But as he approaches the door and starts to unlock it, he hears a loud thump from inside.
"You're my best friend, Cas. We've always kept each other on track when it matters the most. Yes, we've tolerated a lot of exceptions. I tolerated the time you had sex with a reaper. You tolerated the time I had an affair with a human. Fine. But a demon?"
His next target is an older woman named Eliza Johnson. Dean wasn't paying attention to Crowley's explanation of why she needed to be killed; he didn't really care.
He pivots and gets two shots off, one in a demon’s leg and one in another’s stomach, before the third throws him back onto the floor. His head hits the concrete and dark spots speckle his vision, his ears still ringing from the echo of the gunshots. As his eyesight clears, he catches movement toward him and raises the gun, only to have it torn from his grasp.
Crowley's voice, calm yet slightly urgent. "Dean, I know you probably don't want to hear from me right now, but this is important. Alastair turned up at my throne room the other day and he thinks I'll take him as my second again if he kills you. He's looking for you, Dean, and I don't think it'll be long before he finds you. Don't get yourself killed."
“You’ll be fine, Sammy,” Dean says dismissively. He can't hear any more of this. He can't listen to Sam ask him to kill him again, so pushes it all aside, bottles it up the way he always does, and fixes Sam with a firm look. “Just keep me in the loop, okay? No secrets.”
When he hangs up with Sam, he returns to Cas inside. Just moving from one place to another makes him feel slightly dizzy. He's calmer now after speaking to his brother, but the less angry he feels, the weaker he seems to become.
Jack drives competently, and Dean mans the siren in order to switch frequencies at intersections so Jack doesn’t have to take his hands off the wheel. Once they’re on scene, Dean hops out of the ambulance, pulling on gloves as he heads to the porch of the house. He glances back and sees Jack fumbling to get the heavy, awkwardly-weighted jump bag onto his back.
He pats the German Shepherd on the head, then shuts the car door. He closes his eyes and settles into the smell and feeling of the old car. It’s like a warm hug from someone you know is about to stab you in the neck. It’s comfort and self-destruction, all in one place.
“She was with the Sheriff’s Department,” Garth explains, “before she came to the light and became a firefighter. We still give her shit for it.”
The demons scurry away and Crowley sighs. Of course Alastair escaped. No one knows hell as well as he does except Crowley. Crowley isn't certain he'll see him again after turning him down, but if he knows anything about Alastair—which unfortunately, he does—he's not done.
Sam wishes he could explain everything, but not only is he unsure how to go about that, he knows Dean would just scoff and say, “Visions from God, really? You know that shit isn’t real.”
"I know." Cas puts his hands on Dean's upper arms. "But think about it. What are you going to do if you find Crowley?"
The angel touches Dean's forehead lightly and all the pain is gone. It's suddenly much easier to breathe, though he still feels the tickle in his chest that makes him want to cough.
“Is that everyone?” he asks on the front steps of the school, as one of the teachers tries to get a head count.
Crowley takes a drink of his whiskey. He can't pretend the words don't mean anything to him, but now he's on edge and suspicious of Sam. Without the full story and an understanding of Crowley being the king of hell and all, the bartender can only be so helpful.
For a moment, he gets the sense of being watched. He thinks maybe it’s Bobby, also having trouble with sleep, but when he turns around, no one is there. He reaches under the couch cushion for his gun. The smooth grip of the 1911 is a sensation that could almost make him whole.
The small collection of words are written in plain black ink and a simple cursive font—they're framed at the top and bottom by the vines and wire that decorate the rest of Dean's arm.
The demon rolls her eyes. "I've been doing this for two hundred years and still the most common wish is for money. Fine, kiss me, the deal's sealed, you'll die in ten years."
Dean smiles slightly and raises his hands. "Okay, okay. You're right. I need to…." His smile fades. "I need to talk to my brother anyway."
"I've learned a lot. She tried to break down on me once. Besides, some of the parts aren't so different than my old motorcycle, and I fixed that thing up all the time."
Dean gives him the slightest, gentlest smile that seems so unlike him. He reaches over and puts a hand over Cas's. "I'm tired, Cas. I'm tired of the roller coaster here. Of feeling exhausted and sick all the time and especially of being constantly afraid I'm going to hurt someone. I already said this, but I mean it. I can't risk hurting you. Not after…." He shakes his head and looks down at the side of the bed.
The phone rings for a while, and just as Dean is about to hang up to keep it from going to voicemail, Sam answers.
It's been a hard decision for him. He's spent the last few days pondering his conversation with Sam and wondering if he should make a move or not. Eventually, he decided safe is better than sorry.
“It feels like Bobby’s whole network is collapsing. I don’t know if people are giving up or… or getting killed, but… I got a hold of a friend of Bobby’s, Jody Mills? She’s new to hunting, but she was willing to help.”
Dean slides out from under the Impala to see Jo smirking down at him, a beer in each hand and a folder tucked under one arm.
“Hypertensive, a little tachy. Couldn’t get her oxygen above eighty-four, even on fifteen liters and after a neb.”
Sam sighs. “If you don’t want to talk to me right now, that’s fine. I just want to make sure you get out of whatever rut you’re in before…”
“Alright,” Dean says, still on high alert despite Crowley’s promises that he has no interest in killing him. “What can you tell me about Lilith’s plan?”
Sam puts his head in his hands, rocking back and forth slightly. "I'm going insane. None of this makes sense." He looks back up at Crowley and tries to take a deep breath. "Why were you there? Why did you save me?"
“I do.” He turns away to pour the coffee and collect his thoughts. “I’ve had it for almost three years now.”
“I’m getting better,” he says defensively. “I just have to keep working on it. If I hadn’t wasted time trying to ignore it while I was hunting with you, I might be able to kill Lilith already.”
He hears the voice inside his head and closes his eyes. In his mind, he can see Cas looking at him with confusion.
This slowly sinks into Cas. He has a home again. Maybe it would take him time to trust them again after they turned on him so quickly. But they actually accepted that he was right, and that meant something.
"He'll be fine," Sam answers. "I'm not sure what he got into, but his shoulder was ripped up pretty badly. The…vet says it'll be a few weeks before he feels normal."
“Yeah.” He gets to his feet and shoves his machete back into its sheath, staring down at the werewolf. “An idea where to put the body?”
The doctor comes in shortly afterward, as promised. She places the chest tube, which pierces his chest to release the trapped air so his lung can reinflate, and the effect is instant. It’s a sharp stab of pain, then the relief of being able to fully breathe again.
"You've seen better days," he comments, noticing the blood dried on Dean's face—which he'd only half-heartedly tried to wipe off—and soaked into the gray t-shirt he wears under his flannel. Flannel. Crowley wonders what happened to the black and leather.
The young woman looks at him for a few seconds before shaking her head and saying, "Well, thank you. For not hitting me. I'm really sorry, it was my fault—I was looking at my damn phone—"
"I suppose." Crowley pulls out his phone and brings up a picture of a dark-haired woman. "Meet Amelia Richardson. We have a client whose boyfriend ditched her for Amelia, and she sold her soul for revenge. Kill Amelia, we fulfill our end of the deal."
The tattoos all give the same kind of impression that Cas had first gotten from the demon: cruel elegance. They're beautiful, like he said, but they seem like an overstatement, like—
Sam nods slowly. "Well, something must have made him change his mind. An outside influence, I guess."
Eyes wide, body shaking, she gives a tiny nod. She’s dressed in pink, her hair in bantu knots—she looks so innocent and so terrified Dean wishes he could truly protect her, not just from the demon but from the memory of all of this.
“Yeah, but if you just answer the question,” Dean says, pointing to the demon with his machete, “I can make it quick. If not…” He shrugs and goes back to sharpening the holy wood.
Dean looks at the gun, turns it over. “You’re right.” He tosses it aside. “All I ever wanted was to keep you safe. To keep what’s left of this family together.”
Miracle curls up in the dog bed in the corner and watches him as he uncovers the wide metal frame of the black 1967 Impala that used to belong to his father. Seeing it always gives him a chill, some combination of wariness and nostalgia. He opens the driver door—there’s barely room inside the narrow garage of his apartment complex—and slips into the driver’s seat.
Cautiously, he lowers his arm and tries to open his eyes. He can’t see much, can barely move. He makes out a figure leaning over his brother, then moving to Jo. It’s the blazing force of his presence, even more than the voice or the trench coat, that makes Dean certain it’s Castiel.
“Oh, the usual. Poltergeist today. Last week was a ghoul and a couple demons. I spent a day at Bobby’s place just for the hell of it. We tried—well, I tried to make a pizza—it didn’t go well.”
“He seemed… exasperated. And he was angry he had to work on the ambulance with me instead of on the fire engine.”
Cas steps out and shuts the passenger door behind him, standing just a few feet from Dean. "How are you?" he asks, giving Dean a sidelong glance.
Cas shifts his arms down and holds on as Dean turns sharply out of the parking lot and starts speeding down the road. For the first few minutes, Cas doesn't really understand the appeal to riding a motorcycle, but by the time they get out of town and start to drive along a winding road with a view looking out over a deep canyon, he begins to enjoy himself. It's a distinct, unique experience, unlike anything he's done in his thousands of years of life.
As abruptly as it came, the sensation passes, replaced by a stinging in his eyes and a wave of nausea in his gut.
“Forget it. It’s fine.” Dean takes a step backward, only looking at Cas in glances. “You know, you’re right. I am that guy, so.” He takes another step and runs into his vehicle. Regaining his balance, he puts a hand on the trunk and keeps his gaze on the asphalt.
“My services are free,” he points out. “Besides, I like fixing things.” He eyes Cas for a moment and says, “You’re thinking about it. I can tell you’re thinking about it.”
They're an unlikely pair, one made of leather and silver and smoke and the other of black and paisley and class. But anyone in that bar could take a look at them and know not to mess with one without planning on dealing with the other.
It feels different, pulling the gurney out of the ambulance knowing it will be Dean on it during their drive to the hospital. Jack still feels as though he hasn’t fully processed what happened since he and Dean were inside the house, but he pushes onward. He ditches his coat and gloves in the ambulance and wheels the gurney across the grass to where Dean is on his back again, one knee bent, one hand still clutching his chest.
“As friends, obviously,” Dean says. “Or—hunters, you know. That way. I don’t—I don’t swing the other way.”
He turns and is surprised to see a host of angels behind him. Balthazar, Gabriel, Hannah, Muriel, and Samandriel.
“Oh, you know.” Max gets that smile on her face she always does when she talks about her girlfriend. “Not taking the SAT as seriously as I am, always trying to distract me when I’m studying.”
“Relax, I got it.” Dean grabs the radio receiver and says into it, “County, four-four-two is clear of CMC and available.”
Frowning, he starts his bike again, but keeps the headlight off, rolling toward the light as quietly as the motor will let him. Long before he reaches the source of the light—he can make out a silhouette now—he parks the motorcycle and steps off the gravel road, where the crunching rock might give him away.
Dean gives him a nod. Dean turns to Crowley. "Crowley, you are a huge jackass. You're a selfish, self-serving demon, and nothing will ever change that."
He pulls Dean off the angel and pushes him aside. Then he crouches and helps the angel sit up. "What were you thinking?"
"Okay, it's been a long time," Dean says, running his hand along the side of the vehicle. "But I swear to god this is the same car my father had."
Cas nods, but he doesn't look consoled. Dean doesn't figure he'll be able to convince him it's not such a bad thing.
She seems to relax a little, her hand leaving the hilt of the knife, though she stays alert. “You don’t know anything about them, then. The Men of Letters.”
Dean sits up with a gasp. It hurts to breathe from the beating he took earlier. The blood on his cheek has dried slightly and feels sticky.
He doesn't know if he'll see Cas again. He doesn't know if he can do all this—this being human without Cas. He's not sure he wants to.
"Did you know?" Cas asks quietly. "When you woke up, did you know about the crash and did you…feel different?"
Cas is there less than a minute later, a small bouquet of flowers in a vase in his hand. Dean recognizes roses and lilies in it, and the rest are a mystery to him. He keeps staring at it even as Cas speaks.
But Sam knows what’s at stake if he goes back. He still sees it at night. He sees blood drip from a demon’s wrist into his infant self’s mouth, he sees Max Miller’s brain blow out the back of his head, he sees the crazed look in Ava Wilson’s eyes as she revealed her intent to kill her competitors, including him. He sees himself killing a hunter and tying up Jo and shooting his brother in the shoulder—everything he did while possessed by Meg—and somehow it feels like some part of him wanted to do those things, too.
The girl leaves and Sam turns around to find Crowley at the counter. "Oh, hey." He scrunches up his expression, pointing at Crowley and biting his lip. "Crowley? I'm sorry, I'm not great with names."
"I wish I could say this is the weirdest thing I've ever seen," Sam says. Dean looks up to find him staring toward the hound he can't see.
Cas frowns and looks to the window. It's barely growing light out, but he doesn't see anything there. He carefully extricates himself from the bed and rolls the metal stand with the bag on it—the I.V. something or other?—with him so he doesn't have to pull the needle out of his arm. The latch is so stiff on the window he expects it's never been unlocked, but he manages to wriggle it over and even opens the window a crack. The fresh air is relaxing and he yearns to be out of this so human place. He considers just leaving right then, but even just standing makes him feel lightheaded and he has to wait until he figures out what Dean's doing, anyway.
It’s about one in the morning. He only spent one night in Sioux Falls before catching wind of a case in Minneapolis and leaving by noon that day. Bobby tried to get him to stay, but there were no other hunters available to dispatch to the haunting, so Dean left before anyone could get killed. It was five hours ago that he started digging up the grave of a local police officer he suspected of being the spirit in question. Only it hadn’t been her, it had been a poltergeist, and he’d paid for his mistake, as always, by shedding some blood.
“I’m with you, but unfortunately where you’ve parked your car is illegal. It’s not safe on the side of the road like this, for you or for anyone else. I’m gonna have to ask you to move it or get it towed.”
His sleep has been interrupted frequently by dreams of what happened to him, or of how the situation could have been exponentially worse—there were residents trapped inside the house, Jack was killed in the roof collapse, Dean’s mother was in the house and he couldn’t save her. But he has nothing to do but lay in bed and stare at the TV, so he drifts to sleep often.
"What are you doing here, Alastair? As I recall, last time I saw you, I told you if we met again I would kill you."
He goes up to the counter and orders a double scotch. The man behind the bar, who's taller than Dean and has warm brown, shoulder-length hair, is quiet as he goes to pour the drink. Usually when people don't talk to him it's because they're intimidated by him, which gives Dean no end of pleasure.
He sets the child on the snow-dusted road and pulls a knife from the inside of his dress coat. He returns to the vehicle where the dead man still sits and he slits his throat. Without a heartbeat, he has to rely on gravity to carry blood to the cup he holds under the cut and it takes several minutes he tells himself he doesn't have.
"I'm pretty sure I don't need helping. If I did, it wouldn't be from something like you," he sneers.
“It changed everything. My dad, most of all. I barely knew my mom, you know, I have just a few fragmented memories of her, but you’re right. It does stick with you, forever.”
Dean looks over with some surprise at the man in his passenger seat. “Me? Jordan, you called me out here to save
Jack swallows. “I don’t—I don’t know, I just thought—for a second I couldn’t remember where to get the albuterol from, and I thought if I didn’t know it could mean bad things for the patient, and then it would be my fault something happened to her, and—”
“No, no, it’s not that. I have insurance through the school. It’s just that I’m—I’m kind of cornered. The demons don’t know where I am yet, but… I’m not going anywhere soon.”
"I'll figure that out," he says. He won't, of course. He'll help him because Dean is the only thing his cold, blackened demon heart has the capacity to care about. With maybe a very recent exception.
“No. Obviously it’s mine, I chose to stop practicing. I was… scared, I guess, but I’m not running from it anymore. I just hope it’s not too late for me to figure it out before Lilith breaks the final seal.”
Lightning flashes overhead and thunder splits the air. The demon signs have gotten more drastic as the seals break, and the death toll, accidental or otherwise, is climbing.
Cas sets down the cappuccino and kneels beside him. “Here.” He takes the phone and holds it for him while Dean lies on his side to use both hands. After a moment, he extricates himself and sits up with a frown.
He’s interrupted in mid-morning by Jack, who knocks on the doorframe to announce his arrival and stirs Dean from another unpleasant dream. By the time Jack slides the curtain open, Dean can pretend he’s been awake the whole time, though his heart still beats heavily as the flames fade from his mind.
“I should probably put on a shirt,” Dean mutters, turning to grab his shirt off the bed. “So, I guess Lilith’s demons found me.” He pulls the shirt over his head and fishes his necklace out of it. He flashes Cas a grin. “Which means we’re doing a good job pissing her off.”
“You’ll figure it out. You’ve only had two shifts. Besides, working with him is only temporary, right? You said he’ll get moved back to the fire truck before long.”
He got everything he wanted. The Yellow-Eyed Demon is dead. Revenge for Mom and Jessica, enacted. It’s about time he left all the hunting bullshit behind and finally built his own life.
He delivers a solid punch to the side of Dean's face, snapping his head to the side. But this time, Dean is prepared. He uses the momentum of the blow to yank himself away from one of the demons. He tears off his blade pendant and digs it into the throat of the demon still holding his right arm, getting barely enough time to pull it out again before he has to duck and roll to avoid the others.
Sam watches the hound warily as it stands, but it seems to have no interest in him. Since he can see it, he remembers he still has the glasses on and pulls them off. They probably look ridiculous.
Jack leans against the counter. He doesn’t want to say that Dean Winchester scares the shit out of him. “Maybe.”
Dean shifts on his pillows. He feels woozy and shaky and everything aches, most of all his head, the right side of his chest, and his face. Aside from the pain, too, he feels like he can’t get a full breath, which only exacerbates his feeling of general shittiness.
Jack nods without hesitation. “Fuck yeah.” He winces, because he doesn’t usually swear, and Dean can’t help but smile. “Really, I think it just makes me realize how important it is.”
Cas shakes his head and steps toward him anyway. Dean turns to attack him again, but this time Cas sees it coming. He catches each of Dean's hands in his own, then pins both of them together in his left hand. The demon is incredibly strong as he tries to escape the grasp, but Cas is stronger. He reaches up to Dean's forehead with his right hand and—fortunately—touches him before he can deliver a kick. Dean goes still as Cas tries to figure out what's wrong with him. He can't exactly pinpoint what's causing it—not like he usually can—but he can find the bleeding in Dean's stomach and lungs and heal it temporarily.
"Cas," Dean says, helping him to sit up, though he himself feels drained from the exorcism. "You okay?"
Dean holds his gaze for several seconds and Crowley finds himself unable to read his expression. Then Dean turns to head for the door. Somehow, Crowley's mind drifts to Sam and his place in all this.
The bay seems huge to Jack—big enough to hold two fire engines, two ambulances, and two chase rigs—and the laughs of the other firefighters echo off the bare walls and concrete floor. They’re scattered among the vehicles in the most casual way possible, one leaning on the hood of a rig, another perched out of the back of the open ambulance, another sitting on the rear bumper of a fire engine. Jack swears each one is at least six feet tall with at least one sleeve of tattoos, like every stereotypical firefighter ever.
He checks his watch. He was asleep for about two hours, which should be enough to get him to Ellen and Jo’s motel.
Sam takes a moment to digest this, but at this point everything's getting so over-the-top that it doesn't take long. "Okay. But—why did you want to kill me? You said…you said you sent that—her—to kill me? And then saved me? I haven't…done anything."
Dean steps close enough to grab Sam, but doesn’t. “Dude, you need to bail on the pity party. This is the goddamn apocalypse we’re talking about, and we can’t afford to screw it up. Even if Heaven does want you to kill Lilith, you can’t trust them. Even Cas thinks there’s something wrong—”
“Just shut up and listen to me for a minute. We both know the apocalypse can’t go down, right? At least we agree on that. So, we do whatever we have to do to stop it.”
A few hours later, he steps out of the barn, his hands smelling of salt and iron, his clothes still drying from splashes of holy water. All that, and he didn’t even get the demon leader’s name. The demon from his trunk knew he couldn’t kill it without killing its vessel, and the impermanent pain and threat of exorcism wasn’t enough to motivate it into talking. Tomorrow he’ll exorcise it and drop the vessel off somewhere, but for now he needs sleep, and it’s secure in a devil’s trap and iron chains.
Sam comes to consciousness slowly. As he becomes aware of things—he's lying down, his head feels heavy, like he's medicated, he can smell disinfectant and fresh linens—he opens his eyes. It takes him a second to glance around and another second to remember why he's in a hospital.
"I don't get it," Dean says, kicking something so the motorcycle stands up on its own and swinging his leg around so he sits sideways on it, facing the same direction as Cas. "There are a zillion stars, how do you make out a shape?"
"Hey Michelle, thanks for covering my first hour," he says to the other bartender behind the counter.
As soon as he draws the blade back for a kill, Cas lifts his foot and kicks the demon square in the chest, sending him stumbling backward with a grunt. He pulls the sword out of his stomach and the knife out of his chest. By the time Dean comes back with the angel blade, Cas parries his attack and sinks Dean's knife into the demon's arm. It seems to alarm him more than hurt him and it affords Cas just enough time to grab his blade back. He slashes Dean across the cheek as a distraction and returns to heaven a second later.
Next is the saline spray, then the suturing. He does his best to sterilize a needle with his lighter, then unpackages the suture thread. He keeps his jaw clenched as he works and only pauses to take drinks of liquor. When he ties the last knot and snips the thread, he takes a moment to examine his work.
"We need to go," Dean says immediately, shoving the phone in his pocket and grabbing things around the room to throw in his bag. "We have to go, now."
Forty-eight hours later, Jack gets off shift and drives, instead of home, to the Espresso Hive. He’s relieved to be back in Converse and jeans instead of tactical pants and boots, and his mind is still processing his first shift at the new job.
"Not quite." He starts to stand up, shifting his weight heavily onto his left leg. Cas takes his arms to help him up.
Dean reaches up with the hand that isn't paralyzed and pinned underneath him and pulls off his helmet.
Turnouts: the firefighting uniform. The things they wear so they don't die. You know what they look like.
He follows the top of Sam’s shoulder blade out to his arm and feels for the humerus. “Yep, you dislocated it. Sit up straight and press your back into the back of the chair.”
“I don’t know, Dean. I’ve done it before. I learned how, I guess. If you’re trying to get me to consider going back—”
"Did I? Did I really?" He tries to step toward Cas but stumbles slightly. "I think you kinda pulled me into this mess. You just wanted one less demon problem to deal with, and now I'm going to die for it."
Dean waves him off and lifts the mug to his lips. He lets the coffee sit in his mouth for a second before swallowing. “Oh, damn. Okay, that’s good.”
Dean grinds his teeth. He’s never wanted more to punch someone in the face but felt so unwilling to risk the consequences. “And how the hell was I supposed to know when the right time was? You told me we wouldn’t get many chances.”
He waits silently on the back porch of her mobile home in the dark until she opens the door. As soon as she steps outside, he thrusts a knife into her back. She gasps and her eyes go wide, but she doesn't make a sound. Dean can feel her blood rush over his fingers, but he doesn't find the same thrill in it that he usually does.
"Oh my god, what the hell?" he hears a woman's voice from above him. "Are you okay, are you still conscious?"
"You must have done something," Dean says firmly but almost patiently. "I've felt different ever since you wouldn't leave me alone outside that bar. You did something, and I'm not lettin' you go until you've undone it."
Cas takes a few steps backward down the concrete stairs. "Who are you?" He reaches his hand into his trench coat, prepared to pull out his blade if necessary.
His phone buzzes once, which startles him. It's been so quiet here and he's been so deep in thought even the small noise is invasive. He picks up the phone and looks at the screen. There's a single text from Dean: unlock your window.
“Before I nearly lose my job again? Before I become like Dad?” He holds Sam’s gaze firmly in his own, demanding he finish the sentence.
He stands where he can see all three demons—they curse and struggle, but can’t move—and starts to recite,
When he’s gathered his things and disposed of the body, Dean drives back to his motel room. It’s about eight o’clock and he never ate dinner, but he starts drinking, and he drinks until he passes out.
It's not just here, though. Everywhere, everything feels that way. These mood swings from rage to despair and the constant battle to suffocate both have left Dean exhausted. It's starting to sink in that this is going to have to end sooner or later.
Cas shoves Dean away. "What were you thinking?" he growls. "Everything we talked about meant nothing to you, didn't it?"
It's no cooler outside after the five minutes he was in the bar. He shrugs off his leather jacket and tosses it across a chair outside the place. He's left with just a gray V-neck, which makes the shade just barely bearable.
Crowley nods. "Just curious." He looks past Dean to Amelia, who's sitting at the end of the bar, smiling as she talks quietly to the bartender. "Unless you want to make a scene like you did with that angel a few days back, I suggest you wait outside and catch her when she leaves."
Frowning, he walks around to the other side of the car and pulls open the door. Surely enough, there's another body inside, a young boy he missed at a glance. The boy is covered in glass from the windshield and bits of metal and plastic. He has a bloody gash on his head, which is lolled to the side against his shoulder.
He turns to the woman and puts a hand on her shoulder. “Carol? My name is Dean, I’m with the ambulance. I want to get you feeling better and get you to the hospital, okay?”
Dean flips his machete in his hand. “Preying on those people in the trailer park, because they’re easy targets? Because no one will look for them? Your words, pal, not mine. That’s pretty low, even for a thing like you.”
He tries to squash the anxiety that encounter gave him, but it doesn't fully go away. He knows he's not going back to Dean. He doesn't know how to approach what happened the night before. Maybe Dean really is a lost cause. Maybe everything they'd worked for was pointless. Dean never seemed optimistic about his chances against the Mark of Cain.
"I know a great way to spend time." When Cas still appears to be missing the memo, he adds, "You know, when two people such as ourselves are together…alone….And I've got this car we can do it in…."
Sam is taken aback. For a moment, Dean isn’t sure if he’ll shout, break into tears, or try to punch him. Instead, he scoffs quietly and looks at the floor. “I guess I shouldn’t have expected you to believe in me, either.”
From the outside, she barely looks injured—a broken leg and a bit of blood from her temple, but that’s it—but the internal damage is the killer. Dean is the first to point out the worsening bruises on the woman’s abdomen that suggest internal bleeding.
When they get to their destination, Dean finds parking a few blocks away from the restaurant. The slight shower that had sufficed for New Mexico rain has stopped, but the ground still holds a little moisture, which reflects the streetlights and neon window signs.
“If I were a poet, I would exclusively write poems about pie.” He pauses, then says, “Do you have a gas stove? I swear I smell natural gas.”
Dean clears his throat and stands up, rifling through his bag to find a shirt. "You know, I was serious yesterday about how selfish I've been. Let's stop with all the talk of me and my situation. We should do something normal, just the two of us. It doesn't have to be a date, just…something. We'll see how we feel after that."
"I didn't pull you out of that wreck because I wanted to give you the Mark. I wasn't there for you. Someone died before a hellhound could finalize their deal. I just went to see, and when I found you there, I realized you were alone. And dying. When I died—the first time, before I was ever a demon—no one was there. No one cared. I pulled you out at first because I didn't want that to be you."
"I forget how humans work," Crowley says more to himself than anything. "You're supposed to go to a hospital, yes?"
“So, what’s next for you?” Sam asks as he and Eileen walk out of the retirement home after the banshee is dead. They pause on the sidewalk so he can face her as he talks. “You spent your whole life going after this thing, and now it’s gone. It’s a weird feeling, I know.”
He stays there for most of the day, leaving only to buy a salad from a nearby deli before returning to the same seat in the library. She’s still there when he gets back.
Dean pulls himself out of the trance he'd fallen into as he described what had happened. "Yeah. From what I know, it's not something just anyone can do; you'd have to be either an extremely powerful demon—more powerful than Crowley—or a very powerful witch. Crowley may not have been enough of a demon to do it, but his mother was an excellent witch. He knew enough from her to pull it off."
Dean wouldn't be impossible to find, but difficult. It could take him long enough to find him that Dean would be dead by that time—Alastair, it seems, already has tabs on him. But he'll have to warn him somehow, because though Crowley knows normally Dean couldn't be defeated by him, he has no idea how much he's changed in the months they've been apart. Even a small amount of humanity returned to him and Alastair may very well be good enough to kill him.
He sucks the blood from his thumb and flips the textbook closed with a thud that causes another student in the library to look up. Sam gives her an awkward, apologetic smile and looks back down at the desk again.
The cold coursing through Dean now has nothing to do with the temperature. He keeps his expression in check to keep his emotions hidden from his brother, but he hoped Sam would refute it entirely, and in a way he could actually believe. As it is, he thinks Sam is downplaying whatever he’s feeling.
Sam smiles. “Other than the broken ribs and the pneumo, you just have a hematoma in your leg, but that’ll heal up on its own. No other broken bones. And the concussion is pretty serious, so you’ll feel like crap for a while, but it’ll get better. I think Doc’s gonna end up admitting you overnight, just for the chest tube and to make sure your mental status doesn’t get worse.”
Shaking his head, Dean reaches up and runs his fingers through Cas's hair, brushing it back away from his face. Cas realizes it's still wet from his shower and it had probably been sticking up in every direction.
Crowley rolls his eyes. "Isn't the killing fun enough for you? Why do you have to waste time with those little excursions? I got here an hour ago—when we were supposed to meet."
In the end, they work the case together. Sam quickly realizes Eileen is entirely capable of finishing this hunt on her own—more than he is—but the stakes are high enough she didn’t want to miss the opportunity to be thorough.
"You son of a bitch, that was my kill." He turns to Cas and Cas can't help but take a step back. Dean wouldn't hurt him, would he? "So much for the meatsuit, huh?"
"One thing at a time," Dean says, holding up a hand to stop Cas as he walks over to what's left of his bike. Most of it is still in one piece, though it's nearly unrecognizable. The front half of it is smashed around the lamppost while bits of metal and plastic lay spread across the ground around it.
But Dean didn't truly seem sad when they said goodbye. He seemed settled. He'd come to terms with this, and so would Sam.
He scoffs. “Yeah, like you would know. I’m meeting my study group tomorrow morning. You know, studying? The thing people are supposed to do in college?”
He turns to clip the sensor of the oximeter onto Carol’s finger, then swivels back for the stethoscope. Jack is still standing there, frozen, staring at the space behind Dean.
He counts five of his own frantic heartbeats before there’s a rustle from inside and the lock clicks. Dean pushes the door open slowly to keep from hitting his brother on the other side, and salt scatters across the floor as he breaks the line at the bottom of the door.
He hangs up and sets the phone on his chest, exhaling. Yellowed water stains stretch across the white panels of the ceiling. His shoulder aches.
Dean rolls his eyes and downs his scotch in one swallow before he stands up. "If you're not telling me something that's going to matter later, I'm gonna be pissed."
The king of hell returns to the unconscious boy and kneels beside him again. He still hasn't stirred, and Crowley begins to talk.
Cas lets go of Dean. This is the first time he's heard the demon use 'Angel' in an almost—in a non-negative way. "It's…exhilarating. I see why this is your chosen method of travel." Cas swings his leg over behind the motorcycle and hops off awkwardly. He goes to the metal barrier that separates the highway from the canyon.
He opens his eyes and takes a moment to convince himself that was real, and not just a strange dream. He sits up and pulls out his laptop, searching for Saint George and Cedar City. They’re cities in southern Utah, and if he goes to their news, it looks as though there’s been a lightning storm and two livestock mutilations in Saint George in the last week alone. Demon signs.
"Don't write me off, Cas," he says, turning back around. "Just because I'm not killing anyone doesn't mean I'm doing good. This—refraining from murder, even as it's killing me—this doesn't even begin to right my wrongs. Nothing can undo what I've done. I can only hope to not add anything else onto that."
He remembers encountering the demons and Alastair sticking a knife in his back. He remembers Dean healing him, though he can't recall details about it—it had been surreal, like he knew Dean was there, could feel him, but couldn't quite reach him, as if the barrier between heaven and hell kept them apart.
“Have you read the Book of Enoch, Sam? Angels aren’t just good, it ain’t that simple. He let Bobby and Ellen die in that hardware store.”
Alright, so he struck out there. It’s not like it meant anything to him anyway. He knows this about himself by now—flirting is a coping mechanism for feeling vulnerable.
Sam gets out and steps forward into the headlights, his gaze traveling down to the gun in Dean’s hand. “Dean. What are you doing? What happened to you?”
He trots to catch up with her as she heads for the door to the apparatus bay. “Wait, you mean you’re not on my shift?”
"Yeah." He frowns. "I'm surprised you didn't find anything about him. I mean…there's not much to tell. He got adopted, I went into foster care. We saw each other every few months, sometimes a week at a time. But I heard he'd—I thought he died of some illness recently after I got to hell." He's surprised by how difficult it is to think and talk about all this. He's never cared much since he became a demon, or if he did briefly, he just buried it.
Dean watches his brother leave. Then he closes his eyes and forces himself to take a breath, suffocating his emotions before they can tear him apart. Jo is watching him coolly when he raises his head.
Sam glances around the room, shaking his head. He runs his hands through his hair to push it back from his face, then lifts the glasses and rubs his eyes. "Why save me, then?"
"No," Dean says as he stands, surprising Cas. He strips off his leather jacket, which is torn at the shoulder, and drops it on the floor. "I'm going to take a shower. So unless you want to take part in that with me, you can leave."
He needs to do something permanent. Something that will really set him on this insane path to become human again, something he'll have a hard time turning back from.
Sam feels his cheeks grow warm and he looks at the bedsheets in front of him. Dammit, you couldn't have said that a little better? "No. Well, I just—"
Sam wipes blood from his upper lip, though another drop rolls out of his nostril. He looks like he’s about to pass out.
Crowley looks at him for a moment. The boy's soul is still holding on, just barely, for as long as his heart keeps beating. But he's fading fast and from the looks of his mangled body, he can't be saved.
"Let's go get some whiskey," Sam says suddenly. "You, me, a booze run. Tell me you favorite story about Dean."
"The gang's all here," Dean says with a sigh, because he knows what this means. "Let's all crowd into Sam's apartment."
Crowley raises his eyebrows at the blood now covering his hand. "I suppose I should get you something for that."
He’s been waiting for years to find someone who can do that, and he has no reason to think Dean will be the one. They barely know each other, really. But Dean keeps showing up, and Cas welcomes him every time, even if he offers so little. Cas thinks he sees past Dean’s scar tissue, sees that he carries a passion he doesn’t let surface—but Cas could be seeing it because he wants it to be there.
He smiles. “No harm, no foul.” He glances up and down the street to ensure no one is nearby. “What are you hunting?”
“Well, I’m good now,” he says. “Ready to get the fuck out of here, that’s for sure.” He studies Jack for a moment. He’s wearing his fire department ball cap even though he’s off-duty, and he’s paired it, eclectically, with a tie-dye shirt. “What do you think, kid? You still want to do this job so bad now that you know the risks you really run?”
"Every demon wants to feel powerful, but I am powerful. There's a reason you chose me as your second all those years ago. I haven't changed."
“You were suspicious the moment you saw the book I was reading. When I left my table and you went up to see what it was. Then you kept watching me for the rest of the day. You didn’t leave until I did.”
"Are you still convinced you can help me?" Dean asks as soon as they start away from the crossroads.
"Bring him in," Crowley says, bored. Intruders aren't common, exactly—not very many demons can sneak into Crowley's lair in hell—but they aren't a particularly large concern, either.
He never listened the message Dean had left before. He's almost done it, but stopped himself every time. But now….
Sam sighs and pulls out a chair from the dining table to sit down. "I'm not going to try to stop you," he says. He sounds more defeated than he'd like to. "I just wish—I wish we could've actually known each other, you know?"
He hasn't seen much of Dean since they checked into this hotel two nights ago. He wouldn't put it past the demon to slip away to satisfy his need to kill, but Cas knows Dean only has so much tolerance for him, so he's kept his distance. He can only hope that he's kept clean.
Crowley's face turns mildly sour. "Don't think that I want this, Dean. I didn't want any of this. But you…." He shakes his head. "Yes. I'll help you."
"Alright," Cas says, turning back to the other angel. "Balthazar, go back to heaven, get the same treatment I got."
“How about this plan?” a new voice says as the demon steps out of the teacher’s lounge down the hall. It holds a struggling little girl to its side, covering her mouth with one hand and holding a knife in the other. “How about you give me my sixty-six kids, and I let the rest of you all go?”
Then Dean pulls Cas up against him and kisses him again, this time with more passion. There's something intoxicating about the sensation and as Cas's hand travels from Dean's face to his chest, he finds himself clutching the demon's shirt as if he could pull him any closer.
“Gettin’ a bit dusty, Baby,” he says, brushing off his hands before pulling open the door and sitting down. The door hinge has started creaking again. “I really need to give you a once-over. I just don’t have the money for it right now. We’ll go to Bobby’s next week and I’ll get you all fixed up, okay?”
Dean doesn’t watch him leave this time. He walks back to his own car, plunges the key into the ignition, and peals out of the parking lot.
He turns away from the coffee pot and starts in surprise when he sees Castiel standing behind him. "Jesus Christ, give me a little warning, would you?"
The air is cooling down, but it isn't cold; Cas actually finds it surprisingly pleasant. Cas can see a few stars beginning to show in the deep blue sky as the two head back down toward the town. Before they reach buildings again, Cas tells Dean to pull off onto a dirt road he catches sight of.
Putting out fires, that’s what this is. But until Cas can get back to him with new information, stopping the next seal is the best Dean’s got.
“I can explain, just—not right now. I’m a little bit cornered. By demons. Please, tell me there’s someone in the area.”
It occurs to him, not suddenly, but as though a drape is slowly being lifted from his mind. He doesn’t recall the roof collapsing, but he remembers the seal of his mask getting broken just for a second, and the acrid lungful of smoke he got as a result. In that moment, he had known exactly what it must feel like to suffocate.
He takes a deep breath to pull himself away from the memory and looks at Cas as if everything's fine. "Yeah."
"I always thought I'd be around forever. I mean, I age, unlike other demons, but once I die, I'll just come right back as a cloud of smoke. What little soul I have left is bound for hell, right? Unless I die as a human. Then I'm sure I'll still go to hell, but at least I won't have an immediate 'demon' ticket."
"Dean. I can't," he says, looking from her outstretched hand to his arm, which he holds against his side.
“Lazy fuck,” Dean says, sitting heavily in the recliner next to him. “Have you even been on a call since I got stuck on the box?”
Dean's upper lip flickers into a snarl. "Murder is my high, Angel. I love sinking my knife into their flesh and watching the light leave their eyes."
Dean nods, frowning. "I get that. And I never really considered anything different—it was reflex, like I said. But I can't…I guess I can't get over everything else."
Jo steps outside. It’s the only thing that keeps him from hitting the wall until something breaks, be it part of his body or his mind.
"But it's not going to come to that, is it?" Cas asks, just realizing this. He narrows his eyes and tips his head to the left. "Because you don't really want to kill her."
"Yes," he lies. He shakes his head and refrains from coughing. Why isn't he healing? He's suffered far worse wounds than this and been fine afterward.
“Forget it. If we’re gonna stop the apocalypse, you’d better get back in shape,” Dean says, nodding at Sam’s arm still in a sling. “I can’t have you busting something every time we fight a couple of demons.”
“I’ve let you control too much of my life as it is, Dean. Enough. Besides, if I can do this alone, at least I know no one else has to die for it.”
“Damn hunters,” the demon says, grabbing the front of Dean’s jacket and hauling him to his feet. Her eyes flick to black. “There are so many more of you than last time I was topside. But you’re still outnumbered.”
Written across the wall opposite him in what appears to be charcoal from god knows where is exactly what Crowley might have expected.
"Exorcizamus te omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica."
"I will not help you do that. You've been a demon for, as far as I know, nearly thirty years—far longer than you were ever human. It makes sense if you're afraid. But—"
Sam fidgets. He gets the sense he’s supposed to be doing this alone, but would it be so bad to have some help, at least until he can find Lilith? Surely Lilith is the demon he’s supposed to kill. Is he really putting Dean at any more risk by hunting with him? He’ll hunt Lilith either way.
He keeps all this from his brother. When he does consider telling him, he always decides against it, not least because he doesn’t want to ruin Dean’s good mood.
Cas stands and steps over to him, passing his hand over Dean's to heal it. Dean seems like he's about to say something when instead he chokes and starts to cough. It takes him a few moments to recover. Then he looks at Cas and reaches up to briefly set his hand on the side of Cas's face.
Dean has learned a little more about his target and he finds it odd that she would come to a place like this. It's not a low-class bar, by any means, but he often thinks of places like this as being for people with no ambition and this Amelia—this veterinarian—doesn't seem that type.
“What about you? You’re a little rusty,” she says teasingly, “but you could get back in shape, if you wanted to hunt again.”
Some time later, Sam comes in to give him his nicotine patch, another dose of pain meds, and updates from the doctor.
Dean smiles, considers responding, then doesn't. Instead, he gives Cas another kiss, then hops up to sit on the hood of his car.
Then there’s Miracle, a terrier mix with one ear that sticks up and one that flops, who he found at a fire scene. An abandoned building had caught fire after a severed power line sparked above it, and as they were laying their attack lines, a dog came bolting out of the wreckage. After Dean got her calmed down, he realized she was as abandoned as the house—collarless, fur matted and smoldering, malnourished. But he already had The Colonel, who he knew didn’t play well with others, and it’s hard enough taking care of one dog when he has to be gone for 48-hour stretches of time. So, he took her to the Humane Society and told them what a miracle it was that she survived, and the name stuck. Two weeks later, no one had adopted her, and Dean caved.
Dean shoves Cas off, but in a second the angel is front of him, and this time he holds an angel blade in front of him. "If you move, I will incapacitate you." He flicks the knife toward Dean's cheek. "You haven't fully healed from the last time you met with this blade."
“Hm.” Dean moistens his lip and tries to imagine, for a moment, what his unguarded soul must feel like to Cas. He sits forward, bending a knee and propping his forearm on it. “I probably don’t want to know what mine feels like, do I?”
Dean pulls out of the parking lot and makes his way back toward the highway out of town. Before Bobby sent him to rendezvous with Jordan, he was headed to meet up with Jo and Ellen to work a haunted coal mine in Oklahoma. He’s half a day behind now, so even though the sun is setting, he figures he’ll spend the next five or six hours on the road to try to make up for it. He knows why Ellen wanted his help. Jo is insisting on helping, and Ellen is worried enough about whatever is in the mine that she wants backup, for Jo’s sake.
He looks up at Sam one last time. The man with perpetually good intentions, so horribly misled. Blood runs from Sam’s nose, his clenched fist trembling in front of him.
Though he tried to hide it—of course—Dean seemed forlorn when he and Sam first started hunting again. He seemed more tired, more jaded, more depressed than when Sam last saw him, just after the Devil’s Gate. He’s perking up now. He sings in the car and winks at people across pool tables and calls Sam “Sammy” incessantly. Dean is always made complete by the nearness of family, and unfortunately for him, Sam is all he has left.
Reluctantly, Jack gets out and follows Dean around to the back of the ambulance. Dean steps up inside and sits on the bench seat, gesturing for Jack to take the CPR seat across from him.
He never took enough of a break for his shoulder to heal, and his boots are falling apart. It’s been a few days since he showered, because his credit card keeps bouncing and he can’t get a motel room. He hasn’t spoken to another person in forty-eight hours, and before that it was simple “thanks” to a gas station cashier. And he has a demon tied up in his trunk.
