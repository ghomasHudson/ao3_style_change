John watches him, then shakes his head. “No. I thought I might. Before. But ... you mentioned that I always claimed that I wasn’t gay.”
“My colleague had a nightmare,” he says, truthfully, “which woke me up as well. It took him a while to calm down again. Affected by his experiences in the war, you see.”
While John orders their food and fetches their drinks, Sherlock finds them a fairly secluded corner near one of the grimy windows. The table is sticky with ale, so he wipes it with a handkerchief, before sinking onto the hard bench and drawing up a chair to rest his injured leg. It hurts every time he puts weight on it, and even at rest the wound pounds painfully. At least the bandage seems to be holding. He tries to ignore it the pain. He can’t afford to be injured now. His leg will have to bear him at least until tomorrow.
John sighs and grabs the remote. “Any preferences?”
“It was the right, in fact the only possible responsible, decision to halt the stage,” puts in Sam. “The commissaires got a lot of flak from some teams. Some even threatened to sue, but of course they stand no chance. The officials retain the right to interrupt or shorten stages as they please. In fact, had they let the stage continue right through to the finish, each and everybody affected by the weather might have had the right to sue them. So of course, they pulled a stop.”
“Listen to me, if that idiot hasn’t come round by next week, give me his number. I’ll have a chat with him and talk some sense into him.”
“Right, sorry. Next pic. Sleeping in the same bed. Or not. What does 1/2 mean? Half/Half? Oh, you want us to sometimes sleep together and sometimes apart. Yes, that’s acceptable. Guess one needs a little space now and again. Okay. Next one. Oooh, Sherlock.”
The lift shafts. They’re about the only possibility. He could climb down, make himself small, and hope that nobody will check there. But why should anybody check? Whoever is on the stairs is likely to come for Nora Perkins and him, assuming her dead and him still incapacitated and tied up. So, lift shaft it is: climb in, wait for them to pass, climb out, dash up the stairs and hope to get out.
“In about two hours, I think. I may put in a brief appearance at the stage door.”
Sherlock doesn’t want sex, though. He’s never really understood what’s supposed to be so great and important about it, or how people can be so unconcerned and careless who they have it with. When he is honest, the idea of this kind of intimacy, of making himself so vulnerable to a stranger, scares and downright disgusts him. Using sex to pay for his drug habit ... out of the question. The craving for cocaine isn’t that bad – yet. He hopes it never will be.
“All right then,” she says, and then, “Shall we go and join the others?” asks Molly. “I could do with a drink, and also we need to make sure that your doctor is still in one piece and not covered in lipstick and bite marks already.”
Sherlock shakes his head. This is unexpectedly amusing. He recalls John’s reaction to finding Janine in his bedroom wearing one of his shirts and not much else. He can only guess at John’s expression when she joined him in the bathroom. Clearly, he remembers John’s unveiled irritation, even anger when later she arranged herself on his lap, and even better, when he let her kiss him. Why was John angry? He was almost bursting with consternation. Why? He was recently married, had just returned from his ‘sex-holiday’. Shouldn’t he be glad that his best friend had – how had he joked at the wedding? Pulled? But he wasn’t glad, not one bit. He displayed all the signs of a jilted lover. Jealous, possessive, clenching his fists and puffing out his chest as if he was spoiling for a fight. Sherlock has to admit that this was an unexpected but rather revealing side-effect of his fake relationship with Janine. But why would John be jealous? They’re just friends, after all. Unless ...
John stares at him incredulously. “That sounds like total bullshit.”
John’s food arrives, and right on cue, probably when the tense silence becomes unbearable, he begins to talk about archenemies, friends, and people people like and don’t like. And boyfriends and girlfriends. Sherlock reminds himself to breathe. Any moment now ... and there’s his cue.
“Hey, if ever you want to get rid of these beauties,” Donovan’s voice brought him back to the present, “think of me.”
The four men exchanged glances, and John braced himself for the almost inevitable question about the true status of their relationship.
“Tickling torture, or wasn’t that how you termed it?”
“Boys, if you have so much breath left for chatting about bears,” says Sally’s amused voice, “how about upping the tempo a little bit so as not to let the breakaways gain too much of a lead? It’s almost eight minutes by now, and the other teams sit on their arses eyeing one another, but none actually making a move. Make sure you’re at the head of the peloton on the first three descents. The roads are slick and dangerous, and there’s a bit of mist up there. Be careful.”
Even though John knows he should be concentrating on the stage and bury what happened in the morning as deeply as he can so as not get distracted on the road, the task turns out to be difficult. In fact, it’s impossible. He catches himself mulling over Sherlock’s words and James’ texts all morning throughout breakfast, team meeting, the short transfer to Val d’Isère where the stage commences, and sign-in. Because there is only a short roll-in with the road almost immediately beginning to climb in narrow serpentines, the riders have to warm up on stationary bikes at Val d’Isère. The fact that Sherlock is in John’s direct sight most of the time certainly doesn’t help. Nor do the frequent, stealthy glances shot in John’s direction whenever Sherlock thinks he isn’t paying attention to him.
Victor looks startled at the question. “I ...” His shoulders sag and his runs a hand through his hair. “I don’t know. I thought so, at
Sherlock smiles at him. “True. But I
“Thank you.”
Sherlock nods. “You look as if you belong here,” he says.
Glancing at Sherlock fiddling impatiently with his phone during yet another spell of disconnectivity, he smiled to himself. The journey had been a complete and utter success, not just when it came to the cycling. Things he hadn’t let himself dare dream of had suddenly become reality, and he still hadn’t adjusted to the new features of their relationship. Of course, it would have to stand the test of reality. Things were going to be different once they were back at Baker Street. Was Sherlock going to revert back to the work-driven, single minded creature of the past, or would some of the other Sherlock, the relaxed, silly, cuddly, often insecure Sherlock be allowed to surface from time to time? Would he compromise between work and John, putting the latter first more often than previously? And what were they going to tell their friends and family? Despite the shift in John’s perception of his own sexuality and the fact that it still felt a little strange to suddenly be in a physical relationship with another man, the thought of his friends finding out about it didn’t bother him. He believed Sherlock in his estimation that most had been thinking or at least hoping he and Sherlock would get together eventually. No problem there, then. There were going to be knowing smiles and silly remarks, particularly from Harry who’d grilled him repeatedly about his true feelings for Sherlock in the past, but John knew those wouldn’t bother him in the slightest. Moreover even Sherlock didn’t seem troubled by the prospect of being suddenly found in a relationship and thus broadcasting to the world that no, he wasn’t quite the people-hating sociopath he often displayed to be left in peace, and yes, that he did have romantic feelings, deep and passionate ones, too.
Sherlock smiled wryly. “Actually, for a moment it was quite entertaining, seeing them all sit in utter shock before beginning to squabble amongst themselves and then blame my parents for not keeping me in check. I don’t know what happened afterwards because I ran away, out into the garden. I’d have stayed out there all night but Mycroft found me. Thankfully, he didn’t force me to go back immediately. He brought me a blanket and some hot chocolate and we sat in the greenhouse without speaking until he sighed and said that things were going to change now and that I shouldn’t have done what I had because sometimes it was better to just keep one’s thoughts to oneself. We argued for a while, and then ... actually I think I cried a little, mostly for granny because I hadn’t done that before. I didn’t know then what he had meant by things changing. I learned soon enough, though.”
“I hope you told her that he will.”
Sherlock pretended to look confused yet slightly hopeful. John marvelled how somebody this intelligent managed to come across as utterly stupid by just rearranging his features slightly and changing the pitch of his voice. Well, maybe the Essex slang helped a little, too, but then John was prejudiced after too much crap telly.
“Yes, I know. Doesn’t account for all her symptoms, though,” returned Sherlock. “There must be something else.”
“Everybody apart from Moriarty is on the road now,” explains Dimmock. “Sherlock’s approaching the first split time. It’s a shame that he and the other GC favourites have to cope with this awful weather. We’ve been lucky.”
He draws a deep breath, his mind made up. “No,” he murmurs. He can’t look at John, not yet. The scar has healed well. It’s only a faint white line now. But he remembers how much it bled after he’d torn open his leg on a broken branch, and that he’d been scolded for ruining his good trousers.
“You could always call in sick.”
, you know?”
“Which one is the sharp mountain over there?” Kit wants to know. “The one that looks like a jagged tooth. Looks pretty high.”
“Correct. You can meet us there. Here’s some money for you, Eddie and Eddie’s wife.” Sherlock hands him a generous amount. Billy grins, tipping his cap.
Sherlock swallows. John is referring to the various instances when he cheated death. There have been several incredibly close calls, the last one on the plane. John looks troubled. Sherlock is tempted to reach for his hand and squeeze it. But they don’t do that, do they? The touching thing. John isn’t demonstrative that way, likely wouldn’t appreciate if Sherlock suddenly reached out. Thus, he refrains.
The road began to ascend more steeply once they had passed the church and John ground his teeth at the dull pain of sore musculature. He had felt considerably well this morning, his shoulder only faintly stiff and his legs barely aching. But now that they were required to work again, they reminded him painfully of yesterday’s strenuous climb. Luckily, today’s was less than half as long, their destination La Planchette being situated at an altitude of about 1500 metres instead of over 2500 like the previous day. There were, however, some steep passages to climb, and John didn’t look forward to those. He hoped his legs would recover once the exercise had warmed them up.
“Excellent. See if you can find him and ask him and his wife whether they know any films the singer Irene Adler may have had a part in.”
“I was about to have a look at these messages personally,” says Tiltman, shifting his attention from the planes back to Sherlock. “I remember receiving a memo from Knockholt that stressed the importance of them, as least according to their estimations. They were brought by dispatch rider because at the moment, due to some cock-up in the London area, our direct teleprinter link to Knockholt isn’t working properly. I’ve still got the memo somewhere.”
“Good luck. And stay safe. According to the map, the descent from Port de Balès is tricky.”
“Wiggins has just crashed,” Sherlock confirms John’s suspicion.
There was the clearing of a throat from the direction of the bedroom door, which subsequently was pushed open wider to reveal a pale and somewhat dishevelled Lestrade who looked like he had just fallen out of bed after a bad dream. He seemed to be preoccupied with something truly serious, because his eyebrows only rose a fraction when he took in Sherlock’s and John’s state of undress and the implications thereof. John felt Sherlock tense next to him, sitting up even straighter in rapt attention, even alarm.
“So Anderson found out about the knife?”
“Probably. If you really fancy a hike on muddy paths in this kind of weather.”
John flashes him a smile. “I’m not ‘people’.”
“Good luck. Remember, I was undercover. I wasn’t using my real name.”
Anything he can do to avoid these things, he does. However, there are exceptions, rare ones. At one point Milner-Barry, a fellow Cambridge man and now head of the Hut 8 Crib Room, invited Sherlock to a game of chess. Uncharacteristically, Sherlock agreed, if only to test his skills against a real professional. He lost, albeit narrowly. The defeat didn’t much bother him. After all, Milner-Barry had represented England at the Chess Olympiade before war had been declared, so losing had been … bearable.
John licks his lips. “They do little else, so let them. I ... I thought about what you said this morning. And I’ve decided that you’re right.”
“You didn’t? The substances, I mean?”
“But I didn’t,” returns Sherlock sharply. He watches the other, his lower lip twitching, before holding out his hand – a clear peace offering. Victor looks almost relieved when he grasps it and shakes it firmly. Cameras go off again. John knows that this is going to be the image to grace the news headlines. He hopes that the articles accompanying it will stick to cycling and not dig up old personal stuff again.
“Very well, sir,” says Sherlock, playing up the helpful underling. “Shall I inform your driver to bring it round, then? Which one is it?”
precisely. Just ... weird. Uncanny. Sherlock feels it, and John, he is certain, feels the same.
“Yes. That was a stroke of luck, for both of us, as it turned out.”
“Is Picard the one who drinks Earl Grey or the one who always loses his shirt?”
Overhead, a rushing, pulsating sound announces the helicopter drawing close. Ever since his crash, it has stayed close to Wilkes. Something must have happened further ahead. John swerves and curses loudly when from behind him, a camera motorcycle speeds up, overtaking him in a breakneck manoeuvre that has even John shake his head. At the same time he welcomes the rush of adrenaline that clears his head. Some of these motorbike chaps are even crazier than the professional cyclists. He’s always admired the camera persons in the back, riding shot-gun facing backwards while handling the equipment, often with both hands on their cameras. They must have stomachs made of iron.
Sherlock slows his steps, waiting for John to catch up. “I can virtually hear you thinking,” he says, his voice deep and a little hushed. It doesn’t seem appropriate to speak too loudly in this strange, black and sliver-hued night.
“Distracted?” asked Sherlock confusedly. “The countryside hardly warrants that.”
“Food on the table and the odd luxury item, mostly. And the introductions to potential employers or ... patrons.”
Sherlock bites his lower lip, contrition gnawing at him. That particular experiment turned out a big miscalculation and more than a bit not good. “I did apologise,” he mutters.
“Are you boys done insulting each other?” she asks. “Mariella over at Findon Manor would like to know when you’ll be arriving, and whether you’d like the meat course, poultry or fish for dinner.”
Whatever the hikers think is hiding in the trees, they begin to look around anxiously. One of the children present wants to go and investigate and is promptly called back. Not long after, the group packs up and leaves. And even better, on their way down, they meet another small group of walkers who they inform, in hushed voices, that they believe a ferocious dog is running loose between the trees and has been howling quite threateningly. As if on cue, Lightning streaks past, albeit at a distance, and all of them shudder and quickly head towards the lower gate near the water tank. Soon, they are out of sight. Sherlock only hopes that they won’t tell any of the farmers about loose dogs, or else they could get into trouble. Blessedly, for the rest of the afternoon, nobody else shows up.
Daniel nods to himself, hesitates, then swallows and says, “Listen, Sherlock—”
Sherlock watches it with a stab of grief and longing. Jan seems to notice his sad expression, before he points at Sherlock and motions for him to come and pet the dog. Sherlock does so, swallowing around a lump in his throat. He hasn’t petted any dog since Redbeard died. This one here feels different. It’s taller and its coat feels coarser. Even though it seems tame and docile now, to Sherlock it still looks feral and dangerous. No wonder the sheep are afraid of it. Still, it licks Sherlock’s hand and he sniffs.
John is about to lead his teammates to try to close the gap again when the radio in his ear crackles into life. “John, wait,” warns Greg. “You’ll need your strength. Stephen’s had a defect on his bike. He must wait for the replacement and will need his teammates to bring him back into the peloton.”
“Because, as I said, part of the reason that you’re stressed and irritable most of the time is down to the fact that you feel you need to hide who you really are. I fail to see the point of it. You are about to finish your career, you have a good standing within your team and indeed most of the cycling world. You have thousands of fans, most of whom clearly don’t care which way you swing, or who’ll happily pair you off with other men for their entertainment, or because they identify with you and would like to see their own sexual or romantic identity represented in a sports person they revere. So why all this tedious agonising about whether another person on the planet cares which gender you fancy? If this is just down to your father’s real or imagined disapproval—”
“I am sure. It’s the only way of silencing the allegations.”
Eventually, they disentangle again, brush tears from their eyes and sit looking at each other.
“This wasn’t my limit,” returns Sherlock, taking another gulp from a water bottle. His statement is contradicted by a fit of coughing. John rubs his back some more.
“Here,” said Sherlock, handing John the tote bag Susan had stored their provisions in. “Sit down and eat something.”
“Well, I’ll make sure I’ll watch you on the telly next season,” says John.
one time. More than friends, perhaps. But all this is in the past, and I guess too much has happened to ever put things right between us. And believe it or not, I’m not here to allocate blame.”
“Oh, come on, you revel in the fact you’re unique. The only one in the world.” He looks ahead, slowing the car for a cat as it crosses the road. “The boy who lived,” he adds softly, giving Sherlock a quick, furtive glance from the corner of his eye.
a detective,” comes the irritable retort. “I told you, it has nothing to do with fanciful ‘games’.”
He picks up Hattie and holds her so he looks directly into her eyes. She glares at him in return, hanging limply in his hands, before beginning to struggle to be let down. Sherlock does so. “Thanks for your input,” he grumbles as she stalks away haughtily.
“Wow, really? That’s like Hogwarts, isn’t it?”
Her eyes narrow as she watches him. She re-folds her gloves. “Why do you need to know?” she asks at length.
Sherlock smiles, glad that John’s mood seems to have lifted already. “I think that can be arranged.”
Casting a quick glance over his shoulder to ascertain that Tjálga was still there and hadn’t wandered off, John readied his phone to record the confrontation. His gun he had placed next to where he was lying on the damp ground.
He jumps slightly at the sound, gripping John’s hand more tightly. It’s faint but clear, like a spoon hitting the table. The spoon in the ice cream has disappeared again. He exchanges an excited glance with John.
Kenworthy nods and notes down the request. “Anything else I can assist you with, Mr. Holmes?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes at him and sighed, but he ate the pie all the same, and seemed to enjoy it. They really were good, so much so that John considered getting another. Just when he was moving to get out of the car, he saw Katie cross the carpark. She was accompanied by a small, slender woman in her mid-thirties. She was dressed for the outdoors, but in a way that suggested that normally, she’d be wearing more feminine clothes, more in line with the Hermes overnight bag she was carrying in addition to a hiking rucksack. Her hair was long and pulled up in a French braid, and she was wearing pearl earrings and subtle make-up, creating an interesting contrast to Katie’s stronger build, more masculine clothing and practical, windswept hairstyle.
“As I said, not your business. Are you done?”
“Morning,” rumbled Sherlock before picking up the phone again and snorting while looking through his text messages. “And if the morning couldn’t be any more frustrating …,” he muttered.
Vanessa Warrington has watched their exchange with interest. “I hope I’m not being too forward, but—”
Sherlock had already readied his magnifier and had crouched down on the threshold to study the stone floor which was flagged with bricks of different shades in a fishbone pattern, with drainage channels to both sides, apparently a remainder of the old stable-building. “Are all your horses shod?” he asked.
They kiss for a long time, gently and somewhat clumsily at first because of the odd angle and Sherlock’s ridiculous glasses, which he promptly takes off. Turning more fully to John and pressing himself against him, he deepens the kiss, endearing in his eagerness paired with a definite lack of expertise.
“Care to elaborate?”
She stirs, turns to him. Some of her composure returning, she jerks up her chin, sniffs haughtily. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. Dad’s clearly unwell and has had a bit too much to drink last night. He’ll be fine once he’s slept it off.”
“I volunteer for exclusive tutoring.”
John hums as he continues to stretch, more carefully now. “Yeah, that’s what I think as well. Anderson might take a stab at these category four hills today. There are a few, and one cat 3. It’s a good way to collect points for the polka-dot jersey. Hope Stephen wins today. He seemed really miffed yesterday. Understandably so. Ah well.” He crawls out of bed. “Need the loo?”
“Are you a ghost?”
“My apologies, Mr. Moriarty. I didn’t mean to imply any undue allegiance on your side.”
Sherlock feels a frisson of fear the next time Moran attacks with a clever riposte which Sherlock finds hard to parry. There is fierce determination behind the blows now. Finesse has been replaced by brute strength and dark cunning. This is no longer the gentle, orderly strictly regulated kind of fencing they both know from public school or university. This is duelling for real, with the aim of taking the opponent’s life, or at least severely wounding him.
“Well, given the hour, I’m all for calling it a day,” agreed John, absently rubbing the nose of one of the horses. “Do you need to question Peter and Susan tonight, or can this wait for tomorrow as well?”
John has ridden it only once during training. Unlike other, more prestigious ascents, Port de Larrau hasn’t been part of the Tour de France often, nor of the Vuelta. He can’t help feeling a little sad that most of the views of the surrounding mountains and valleys are hidden by clouds the higher they climb. The landscape turns wild, almost lonely when one disregards the fans lining the road and the long train of riders and cars snaking up the hillside. Patches of dark woodland soon make way for stony pastures of rough grass dotted with erosion scars and a curious web of narrow paths which were probably made by sheep or other grazing animals. Cream-coloured cattle can be spotted now and then and herds of small, shaggy sheep, their bells ringing through the fog.
“They’re not fantasies,” he murmurs after they’ve lain in silence for a bit while outside the window, a blackbird has begun to sing while rain patters against the glass.
“Relax,” murmurs John, rubbing his back in a soothing gesture. His hand feels very warm. Sherlock hopes his own hands aren’t too sweaty. He can hear the smile and quiet encouragement in John’s voice. Why is he not more troubled by this? It’s not allowed. They’re both men, they shouldn’t be dancing, especially not in a setting that has all the markings of a romantic one: solitude, moonlight, a garden, music. But John seems perfectly at ease. Sherlock wonders if he has done this before. Not exactly
“Well to do, yes. Both parents deceased, however, no siblings. His parents were diplomats and he was left with a trust fund to pay for his education, his uncle functioning as his legal guardian until he came of age.”
They watch the screen for a bit, until, “This man is wearing a wig,” observes Sherlock.
With some well-aimed deductions accompanied by icy glares from Sherlock and John they scare off a group of German tourists and so manage to secure a cable car gondola for the three of them only. Wiggins is fidgety and keeps looking over his shoulders nervously.
The illustration for this chapter is "At the window":
“You mean you’d have died from exposure otherwise?”
“Hope that’s all right. I felt I needed some coffee, too, to keep me awake,” he states, taking a sip of his own cup.
John laughs and gently slaps Sherlock’s arse with the flannel. “Thank you kindly.” Then he turns serious again. “Come on, let’s get you clean and out of the shower. Your legs are trembling already.”
Now, however, the competent Miss Hooper is reduced to a nervous wreck as she stands, wringing her hands in front of her. She has done something with her hair that makes it look like a bird has attempted to pile it in a nest and failed, and wears lipstick for a change, the colour too pink for her complexion. She has also opened the top button of her blouse, which is reasonable in the heat. Sherlock gives her a quick once-over and decides to be kind and spare her the trouble of a long speech. Molly is tolerable company where codebreaking and talking about dead bats is concerned, but it’s obvious even to Sherlock that she is trying to steel herself into asking him out, and that simply won’t do.
“Haha, very funny.” John glowers at him. Drawing a breath, he reaches out and resolutely pulls down Sherlock’s briefs.
“Got a flashlight?” he asks his comrade while walking across the road, away from the car that reverses down the street and joins traffic on Brompton Road.
“Whose fucking idea was it again to drag both of them down here?” asks the American. “We could have left them at ground level. Would have saved us having to carry them up again.”
Sherlock nods. “Yes, they are. But it’s not a problem. I’m a light sleeper. The birds would have woken me soon, anyway.”
Soon both of them were ready. Despite the horses’ relatively small size – they weren’t referred to as ponies, although for John they were definitely pony-sized – they seemed able to carry grown men with ease. Even with his habitual poise, Sherlock looked a tiny bit ridiculous with his long legs dangling to both sides of his mare, but the dramatic coat made up for that in John’s opinion. He wondered when Sherlock had had riding lessons. He definitely looked like he knew what he was doing. John hoped it was indeed like cycling and one didn’t unlearn it. At least his hands seemed to recall on their own accord how to hold the reins, and after a bit of shifting in the saddle he found a position that was both comfortable and efficient for urging the horse on.
Therefore, reaching out and running a hand down John’s chest while leaning in even closer, he says in a voice so low that John must rather feel its vibrations than actually hear the words, “I’d like to try ...”
“Like I was overrun by a lorry, or rather a couple of Suffolk Punches, but it’s much better than this afternoon. What time is it, by the way? I didn’t mean to drop off.”
“He’ll do that whether we talk or not, Mike,” quips Irene, but she, too, falls silent and watches as Sherlock draws near the check point. The announcer is raving excitedly about the effortlessness of his cycling, his fluent, aesthetic style, and about his time, of course. And he’s right. All of these features in themselves are spectacular and quite fascinating to watch. But the time is the most remarkable. Sherlock has beaten Victor Trevor’s already excellent split time by about ten seconds.
“I had a run in with some criminals, Mrs. Hudson, but John rescued me. I’m fine.”
“Right, well, he gave me a nasty glance and muttered something I didn’t catch. That woman sitting to your other side enquired after you because you looked so pale. She seemed quite worried. So I explained about the bomb and you saving the children, and also about me being a doctor. The woman was impressed, and even Ugly Tie seemed somewhat mollified.”
John nodded. “Hope Sherlock behaved himself, at least.”
Sherlock smiles at him. “Thank you, John,” he says earnestly. He hesitates for a moment, then leans in and kisses John gently. John returns the kiss, initially worried about morning breath but soon forgetting about it as their kiss turns deeper and more passionate. Sherlock is warm and pliant despite being all lean muscle. Arousal stirs in John’s belly. He allows it to simmer. Now is not the time to indulge in more than kissing. He doubts Sherlock would be amenable to it, anyway, despite his earlier declaration that he wouldn’t mind “assisting” John with his sexual needs. He appears to be enjoying himself, though, kissing John with that unique focus and dedication of his which John has quickly come to crave.
Sherlock chances a quick glance at John, who seems oblivious of Sherlock’s dilemma. He does, however, turn to Sherlock and smile at him, and now he does place his hand so that for a brief moment, his pinkie brushes against Sherlock’s thigh. As usual, Sherlock’s heart leaps, and he has to clear his throat and look away.
“Have you or your husband touched this since the second message was pushed through?”
As he cycles towards the house indicated by the vicar, Sherlock considers how to approach Molly’s landlady, and what exactly to tell her. Eventually, she must of course learn of the fate of one of her tenants, and in Sherlock’s opinion rather sooner than later. He wants to avoid gossip making the rounds, though, especially before an official investigation by the police – local or otherwise – has commenced. Also, he isn’t sure whether he is the right person to break the news to Mrs. Suffield. As he has heard repeatedly today, he lacks tact. Then again Molly might be too distraught to repeat her tale to her landlady. John might be a good person to relate their findings. He’s a doctor, and fairly good with people. Apparently he has skills relevant to dealing with them which Sherlock so obviously lacks. Sherlock recalls how Molly seemed to become more at ease under John’s careful ministrations. A hand placed here, a kind word there. Sherlock may be good with codes and cyphers, but he’s never seen the necessity to try and understand people. Perhaps, he muses, he should begin taking an interest in them. It might be beneficial for the Work, should the war ever end and he be able to pursue detective work once more.
“Yeah, right, so you want to sit here and stare into what remains of the fire feeling sorry for yourself and making yourself believe that you’re not worthy of my attempts to make you feel better. Is that it? Because if it is, you’re a bloody idiot.”
, thought John, fighting hard to hide his grin.
When the movement of their lips has slowed to almost standstill, Sherlock breaks the kiss, pecks John on the nose, and kisses both his closed eyelids. John knows he shouldn’t be surprised by the tender playfulness anymore. This is Sherlock at his most natural and unguarded, his most genuine. Nevertheless, John feels his heart swell at the affectionate touch.
“I listened to you for the greater part of my life,” says Sherlock bitterly.
Sherlock huffs. “I do detect irony and sarcasm when they are being used. I am also aware of your attempts at levity which mostly manifest in some mild – I think the term is ‘bickering’ – with me. It’s rather enjoyable, I find.”
Carefully, Sherlock places the paper on top of the square of fabric, which he then folds over and puts into the notebook. Hopefully the cotton and the book’s pages are going to soak up some of the moisture and prevent the paper from disintegrating further.
“The thought had occurred,” admits Sherlock.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Not really. Too many people in too small a space. Too much sensory input. When I was younger, I had real difficulties switching it off. Deducing people, I mean. Now I can filter it a bit better, but using the Underground is still challenging. But how about we walk for a bit. I’d like to pass by my flat to see if there’s any mail, and if it’s still there, even.”
John nods. “Yeah. Thought I’d enjoy it while it’s still light outside. It’ll be dark by the time we reach Paris.”
Sherlock inclines his head, his movements loosening incrementally. “She’s had some classical training as a young woman, and while her ex-husband was running nightclubs in Florida, she would dance there. Not exactly standard dancing, though. It was more of the ... exotic variety.”
Thankfully, even though the road is already busy, he manages to reach the Tube station without further incident. Walking next to his bike on the pavement, he looks around for cameras near its entrance. Sherlock was caught on CCTV near the Harrods entrance, wasn’t he? That’s where he caught the Tube to South Kensington. John spends some time walking from one station entrance to the next, checking the pavement for anything that could be seen as a pointer towards Sherlock’s whereabouts. Unfortunately, the paving stones seem to have been cleaned earlier. Barely any litter is left.
So they drove on in silence. Sherlock tried to think about the case, but found that with John so close, his familiar scent almost tangible in the back of the car, he couldn’t concentrate. Because of the darkness he could barely make out his features. Near Bexley, he was almost certain John had fallen asleep – he wouldn’t have held it against him, given that John had already travelled for a long time that day to get to London. But John wasn’t asleep. In fact, he seemed wide awake, because suddenly, Sherlock felt something firm and warm pressed against his leg. John had stealthily slid across the back seat until he was sitting close to Sherlock, close enough to touch.
“Fantastic. You’re absolutely brilliant. And completely bonkers. How did you manage to steal that card so fast.”
Tiffany beams at him. “Oh yes, I’d like that.” Then she sobers up a little. “I hope they won’t be too angry.”
“No. Radiocarbon dating revealed her to be from the third century AD.”
. Actually, this wouldn’t be altogether bad. John believes he would make a good coach, given his experience and his good rapport with his fellow teammates. It would mean not quitting cycling entirely.
were the one who simply couldn’t keep his mouth shut and had to broadcast everything he picked up without switching on his brain first to consider whether it would be wise to reveal what you had learned. Your brother knew, too. Mycroft knew all about my doings, and yet he didn’t say a word. And your mother knew as well. She was even d’accord with it, and, believe me, quite content with the arrangement. But you, you had to try and be clever. You had to show off, as always, with your faible for dramatics and bad timing. And apparently you haven’t lost any of that. Trying to make a career out of your weird little knack of reading people.”
If this weren’t enough, Sherlock’s activities were accompanied by a low, rumbling hum, much like the purr he emitted sometimes when particularly content or mentally engaged, like when he was relaxed and happily splayed out over the couch and his flatmate, and John was playing with his hair. Now he appeared particularly content and stimulated, too. As much as he was still capable of rational thought and observation while being reduced to mere emotional and hormonal jelly by Sherlock’s careful ministrations, John thought he felt him pause briefly at regular intervals, sometimes even disengaging his mouth and lifting his head as if to study John’s reactions and commit them to memory. John wondered whether he was constructing a new extension to the ‘John Wing’ of his mind-palace, and he let out a giddy, happy laugh at the thought.
A brief visit to the bathroom later – where, to his surprise, John found that Sherlock had actually rinsed his cycling gear and hung it up to dry –, they had resumed their previous positions in Sherlock’s bed, which, John had to admit, was rather more comfortable than his own. Moreover, it smelled like Sherlock, which John considered an additional bonus.
if I can. Not sure if I’m going to be much help to the rest of the team. What about you? Lie low until the next time trial? Or are you going to fight for your podium place or top ten ranking?”
Sherlock smiled mysteriously. “Oh, I’m rather convinced it’s still fairly close by. The abductors will want to keep an eye on it.”
John shakes his head, smiling. “Did you last share some with your friend here?” he asks.
Sherlock gazes after him, confused.
Despite the layers of clothing John was wearing, the air felt indeed cold when they set out, particularly whenever they cycled in the shade of buildings or scantily leaved trees, or when the sun was hidden behind fast-moving clouds. Sherlock set a brisk pace right from the start, making John a little breathless but helped him warm up quickly. Despite feeling a little out of shape, John knew that his idea to take the bikes and Sherlock out today had been a good one. Traffic on their chosen route was light and the views of white Georgian architecture catching the level sunlight were beautiful. Last weekend’s gale St. Jude had stripped most of the trees bare, but the remaining coloured leaves on the trees in Regent’s Park were glowing in warm shades in the sunlight. John appreciated the clear, bright colours, a welcome change after the grey, wet dreariness of the past days.
John smiles, gazing down at his chalk-stained shoes. “Indeed. It’s so strange to imagine that all of this was covered by the sea at some point.”
Listen, Gascons, this is the Gascogne!”
“The last two words likely mean ‘Knockholt, Kent’,” Sherlock informs him. “It’s one of the listening stations on the South Coast. I could not decipher the precise time, but I think we can safely assume that this was the date the message was intercepted.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Probably. I’m not interested in labelling myself. But throughout my life, there have been very few instances when romance and/or sex held even a modicum of appeal to me.”
“The ascents are pretty straightforward. In most cases there is only one road leading up to the pass,” said Sherlock, reaching for the cup and taking a careful sip. “We would have managed without the map. Still, it’s interesting to see how high the mountains are around here, and how steep the roads. What’s this?”
The secretary seated next to the closed door of Commander Denniston’s office doesn’t look up from her typewriter when the threesome approach her. Sherlock studies her from narrowed eyes. He hasn’t seen her before in this place, and yet she looks eerily familiar. Her dark hair is styled in elaborate waves; she wears tasteful, professional looking make-up accentuated by dark red lipstick. The fingernails on her quick-moving fingers are varnished in dark crimson, too. Instead of the usual skirt and blouse (and cardigan) combination most female employees of Bletchley Park wear when not in WRN uniform, she is dressed in a dark costume with a narrow skirt and fitted jacket that gives her an almost masculine appeal despite the feminine cut. The faint pin-stripe pattern of the fabric makes Sherlock think of dark umbrellas and stiff reception rooms, and suddenly he knows where he has seen her before.
She cocks her head. Sherlock can tell that his words have intrigued her. He pushed himself off the doorframe and takes a step towards her, planting himself next to John.
Sherlock heaved a sigh. “As usual, you don’t observe, John,” he stated petulantly.
“When I could not stand it any longer – well, actually I hadn’t been able to stand it even when he started –, I tried to get rid of him. He didn’t catch my not so subtle hints, 'no' and 'enough' obviously not in his vocabulary, until my only rescue seemed to be to try and knock him out. Which I did, with the champagne bottle. But by that time I was thoroughly panicked and didn’t hit him properly.
John gives him a quick smile. “Sounds all right to me,” he comments, nodding at the chain changing smoothly from one sprocket to the next.
Sherlock can’t help scowling at him. “Robert, eh?” he says archly, pouring the wine
“Sorry to be a spoilsport again, boys,” Sally interrupts them, “but you’ve not reached the finish yet, and the tempo has just picked up. So stay alert until you’re safe, okay?”
Sherlock looked at him gravely, but with the tiniest of smiles playing about his lips. “Always defending my honour, Dr. Watson?”
Breathing hard and trying not to steer too close to the right whenever he was riding next to the unsecured roadside, John began counting down the bends. Three more to go, now two. There was a slight lessening of gradient, the last serpentine curve, a straight stretch ahead with the carpark at the pass already in sight. Looking over his shoulder to Sherlock who this time had chosen to ride second, he saw his friend’s weary but elevated smile. Holding out his left hand, he waited for Sherlock to ride up and grasp it briefly, an action which almost caused the two of them to collide and fall over because of their low speed. Grinning like a madman, John let go of Sherlock’s hand as powered by a rush of endorphins not only caused by the fact they had indeed conquered the pass, he accelerated to cover the last metres in a sprint.
Returning from his lunch break, Stamford visits him in the lab, bringing with him the perfect candidate. In retrospect, Sherlock isn’t sure whether he falls in love with John right away, or whether it takes another day, a chase, a shot and a late Chinese dinner. But fall he does. He doesn’t realise what’s going on at first. It takes some getting used to suddenly having a flatmate – and what’s more, a friend.
They have almost finished their pies and mash when Molly arrives, looking excited but also flustered and tired – hectic cycle ride to the station, full train to London. She is clutching her small handbag to herself as if it contained some fabulous treasure. Perhaps it does, muses Sherlock as he waves her over. Noticing how her eyes linger on their empty plates, he nods to John, who takes the hint, gets up to shake Molly’s hand in greeting, to then enquire what she’d like to eat and drink. Molly opts for the pie as well, and some light ale. John sets out to order the food and fetch the drink, while Molly takes off her hat and coat and sits down next to Sherlock.
“Yes. But I’m glad you do.” John swallows, scoots closer to Sherlock and rests his head against his chest. It feels a little strange to be the smaller spoon, but not as strange as he thought it would. “And I’m glad we finally got here. I’m aware we’ve only known each other for little more than a fortnight. It feels longer, though, like I’ve known you for ages. I don’t believe in fate and soulmates and all that—”
John laughs. “Very much, yes. And,” he smiles at Sherlock, “I like you.” Then, however, he bites his lower lip, looking uncertain of a sudden. “What I said back at the restaurant ... about certain things being fine ...”
“And these gentlemen are Alan Turing and Dilwyn Knox. Mr. Turing is head of Hut 8 where you’ll be working, captain,” explains Denniston. “Mr. Knox is Hut 6.” He doesn’t mention what goes on there. Sherlock knows, but apparently Watson’s clearance doesn’t entitle him to this information. The less the single person knows, the least they’re likely to blab. And there’s a death penalty on blabbing, as they’ve all been told over and over again, and made to sign.
More laughs and cheers from the audience. John knows that he is fairly popular, is regarded as a sympathetic, down-to-earth rider.
The first thing he noticed was that all three quads lacked license plates, not that he had really expected any. When he had almost reached top, he saw that the actual crown of the barrow had caved in as well. Perfect. Stealthily moving forward, he led his horse into the shallow dip and crept on without her until he could gaze at the scene below, himself partly screened by wet bracken, wind-swept heather, and a small gorse-bush.
Until he met James. James with whom he struck up an immediate friendship very similar to what he has with Sherlock now – and yet completely different. James was .... difficult, although most people would say this of Sherlock as well. In some ways, they are alike. James was very focused on his career. Driven, in both good and bad ways. Often, John didn’t know how to read him. He would be openly affectionate, buoyant and exuberant one day, cold and remote the next. Combine that with John’s reluctance to let anything of his bisexual inclinations show publicly, and James being very careful concerning his public image, too, no wonder they never really managed to work things out between them.
Sherlock’s eyes narrow. The name sounds familiar ...
In the semi-darkness of the room Sherlock’s teeth flash when he smiles briefly. “Nothing unseemly, never fear.” He casts back his blanket and leaps out of bed, suddenly wide awake. John watches him flit through the room and open the curtains, letting in orange light from the streetlamps outside. John hears him shift a few things, claps are popped open, followed by the unmistakable sound of a violin string being tugged gently, followed by another.
Sherlock huffed. “Yes, obviously. Didn’t you spend some memorable nights in the hay before? That summer when you worked as a stable-hand?”
“Well, despite more advanced methods of keeping shellfish fresh, there’s still some truth to the rule you shouldn’t eat them during months without an ‘r’,” mused John.
“You’re welcome. Um ... just to be clear ...,” continues John somewhat hesitantly, “you’re misty-eyed because you’re a little overwhelmed, right, not because the sex was so bad.”
Sherlock watched him imperiously for a moment before giving a curt nod.
John gave a curt nod and stepped back. “Come by Scotland Yard on your way from the market, and we can go to Kerke’s flat together.”
“Quite so,” replies Sherlock, plastering his most pleasant and slightly insipid smile onto his face because it usually causes people warm to him quickly. It makes him look rather stupid, too, but that appears to be part of its appeal.
John snorted, his eyes wide in a mixture of shock and amusement. “You sent Mrs. H. to buy you new underwear?”
Sherlock grunted, dealt the enter key a harsh stab and closed the laptop with a snap.
John licked his lips. “Be careful, okay.”
“Friends,” he repeats slowly, as if tasting the word for the first time. “I don’t think I ever had a
“Hungarian sheep dog,” Tiffany and Sherlock reply in unison, and then smile at each other.
“Where, Kensington?” he asks.
“Right.” Turning back to Sherlock who was stooped over one of the hands, he asked. “Want me to look for anything special? Only I doubt I could find anything that you or Molly have missed.”
John laughs. “Jesus, that’s brilliant. Wonder why nobody’s thought of that before.”
John understands. “You’re allergic?”
“Why did you stop?” John wanted to know. “Ballet, I mean, since you obviously enjoyed it.”
“Are you really okay?” enquires John gently.
But this is different. He enjoys John’s gentle digs at his ‘otherness’. Didn’t John even call him incredible and mean it as a compliment? And he’s given him a gift, a very thoughtful, precious and useful gift. Sherlock’s hand curls around the magnifier in his pocket at he spoons up his stew, feeling warm all over which he suspects has little to do with the meal. He carefully avoids looking at John who he knows is watching with a fond but also tired expression. Sherlock is convinced were he to return the other’s gaze, he’d blush even more vividly. So he concentrates on eating, hoping the added tinge to his cheeks appears as if it is caused by his hot meal.
Sherlock shrugs and grins. “Well, it should give the tabloids something to write about tomorrow, if the revelations about Magnussen or our encounter with Moriarty don’t produce headlines – the latter, by the way, was photographed by a couple of bystanders and will therefore most certainly show up on social media later.”
Jim nods sadly, drawing on his cigarette. “Yes. She came up to me and asked me not to play a certain song one night back in London because it reminded her of Michael. ‘Night and Day’, Porter, that was the song. We played something funny instead, ‘Run, Rabbit’ or something like it, and she came and thanked me afterwards. She danced a lot that night, with a number of different men. I think she wanted to get over Michael as soon as possible, and I was glad to help her with that.”
John smiles against his temple as he kisses him again, before slipping his hand into Sherlock’s underwear. Sherlock doesn’t last long after this, with John stroking him and kissing him at the same time, until Sherlock shatters apart, his face once more buried in John’s neck and shoulder while the other whispers endearments. Sherlock holds on to him. When his brain cooperates again after shutting off when his climax surged through him, he realises that his eyes are wet and his throat feels strangely constricted. He sniffs, and sniffs again. He is crying. Embarrassed, he tries to shift his streaming eyes and snotty nose away from John’s skin, but John has none of it. He holds Sherlock against him, strokes his hair and back, kisses his temple.
Sherlock sniffed haughtily. “Had the containers been in the right order, I wouldn’t have had to.”
Sherlock stands with his back to John, his shoulders tense. Gradually, they relax. His posture slumps and he runs a hand through his chaotic hair again. “Okay,” he says in a quiet, small voice, briefly gazing at John over his shoulder. “Apologies for the outbreak. It’s ... you didn’t deserve it, particularly not after I interrogated you about your sexual history.”
John swallows softly at the compliment. “Uh ... thanks, I guess. I’m not saying I’ll join you on any midnight expeditions, but I will try to help you.” Staring at the dark ceiling, he chuckles to himself. “God, this must be the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done.”
“No. Yes, I mean. It’d be nice, I guess. Sex with him. Could be. But ...” He shrugs. “I don’t know, Sarah. I feel like a bloody teenager again, and it’s not even because I’m confused about my sexuality. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to scare him away, or alarm him. Sherlock’s so ...  And him being a team- and roommate and us riding one of the toughest cycling races in the world doesn’t help. Nobody needs this kind of distraction during the bloody Tour de France.”
“I won’t play all night, only until you’re asleep,” returns Sherlock.
“Victor Trevor.”
“Where are these pictures?” Sherlock wants to know.
“He is,” agrees Molly. “And very nice. But I’m not looking for anything at the moment, not with the new job and everything. Perhaps when the war is over ... Or perhaps not. I can’t really imagine being in a relationship just now.”
John looks up, his eyes shining. “Defective?”
“You haven’t done any cycling today to earn one.”
Chest tight and throat constricted, Sherlock dashes up the stairs. John isn’t in their room, but his own. Packing. His uniform is spread out on his bed, his suitcase, sitting on the chair next to it, is already half full with shirts and underwear. He looks up when he hears Sherlock. For a long time, they simply stand and gaze at each other. John looks tired, the lines around his eyes look deeper and more pronounced in the dim light in the room – dusk is settling in, but John hasn’t drawn the blackout curtain yet nor switched on the lamp.
Sherlock leans on him to steady himself. “Don’t blame yourself. Let’s try the stage door.”
Eventually the idea of breathing lost its inherent boredom and began to rapidly gain appeal. John was about to communicate this to Sherlock when a noise from the living room caused them to terminate the kiss. Someone cleared his throat, before a well known voice sounded disdainfully.
Molly’s eyes grow wide. “You mean ...,” she lowers her voice to a whisper, “you mean she was spying on him? But why, and for whom?” She thinks for a moment, then nods to herself. “It makes sense, though. The fact she never mentioned him while being so candid about her other lovers. And on the outside, he would have looked like a good match, being rich and of the gentry and everything. Someone you’d flaunt to the other girls, for sure. But she never did, even when Jeannine asked her about some piece of jewellery she’d obviously been given by him.”
“That’s James Bond. Or rather, Sean Connery playing Bond.”
“How can you be so sure?”
“Are they?” asks John. “To be honest, I can’t imagine that. I mean, from what one hears, all those who dare oppose the government face major discrimination or are even jailed and executed. Who’d dare to voice their opinion freely and openly under those circumstances? I was captive on a German submarine, and what I witnessed there wasn’t a vessel filled with glowing supporters of the Nazi cause, but just ordinary chaps like ours, homesick, worried about their dear ones, interested in girls and football and looking forward to shore leave. Their captain was a bit of a hardliner, but the rest ... they weren’t the monsters we want them to be. Anyway, I fully support the need to defeat this enemy. The alternative is unthinkable. But we shouldn’t forget our humanity. Otherwise we’re no better than those we are fighting. Also, look at how things developed after the Great War, the ‘War to End All Wars’. Germany was beaten down, was made to pay exorbitant reparations that crippled its economy and caused dangerous upstarts like Hitler to rise to power. We should be careful not to make the same mistake again.”
“Yes, I did. Lift up your arms.”
Sherlock rests his head on top of John’s, his hands sliding down his back to draw him closer. “Sounds like a good plan,” he murmurs before drawing back again. “But first, the final stage. Do you still plan on winning tomorrow?”
“Think he recognised us?”
Anderson shrugs. “Tomorrow and Sunday will tell. I’ll try my best.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John sighs. “It’s just ... your ... informant, Billy. I’ve seen the kind of him before. I don’t need your deductive skills to notice that he’s got a serious problem with substance abuse. I don’t know what he’s taking, but it’s harmful.”
John swallows and nods. “Please,” he manages.
“Er, yes, actually. I was wondering if you had any desserts left, or anything you could make quickly.”
“Obviously. What’s the matter? I can’t see that there is anything funny about it. You should be pleased that I’m considering to go such lengths to accommodate your needs.”
“It’s a character from a Japanese animation film from the 1980s. I watched it once when it was shown on the telly. It’s a bit crazy but very atmospheric and ... um ... heartwarming. Totoro is some kind of benevolent if strange tree-spirit who helps two little girls visit their sick mum in hospital. He’s magical and only the kids can see him, and he has all kinds of weird creatures as friends, like a bus-cat.”
“Yes, let me just pop down to the bathroom. Wish I had some more time to look round your bookshelves. You’ve got quite an impressive collection of medical publications here. At least that’s what I gathered from a quick browse.”
“You did it for me. All of it.” It’s not a question.
The tailor is a Savile Row individual whose brother opened a ready-to-wear business some years before the war. Sherlock recognises his name, and when Mr. Norton hears his, a spark of recognition lights his eyes. Sherlock is convinced he is familiar with his brother, even though Mycroft habitually has his clothes made at another establishment. Ah, but his coats ... Sherlock surmises that he might buy his winter coats at Norton and Sons.
“I was, yes, but I did take in the crowds, and some of my surroundings. That’s part of the fun of the Tour, isn’t it? It’s the world’s greatest sports spectacle, on the largest open air stage, and you’re part of it. It’s special, and invigorating, don’t you find?”
“You,” he rasped, his voice hoarse and full of emotion.
Sherlock cocks an eyebrow. “Yes, says the very man. Apology accepted, John Watson, but don’t tell me to ‘fuck off’ again. I won’t, I told you. You’ll have to fuck off yourself to get rid of me.”
She nods and leads the way. John follows, casting a last wistful glance round the room that pulls at the strings of Sherlock’s heart. He is about to step out of the room when Daniel stops him by planting himself in the doorway, looking at Sherlock from narrowed eyes.
Despite being grilled about their adventures in London (their landladies have read about Moran and the Adler engagement in
“Yes, of course you are, don’t you see? Shorthand.”
Sometimes, it still surprises John that a man so knowledgeable of and skilled in so many things nevertheless has glaring gaps in his knowledge. He can easily deduce who recently had sex with whom, has a profound knowledge of various acts of intercourse. But it’s all theoretical. There’s an entire set of experiences, namely of the intimate kind, that Sherlock lacks. John doesn’t know why. Perhaps Sherlock doesn’t, either. For a long time, John assumed he was asexual or aromantic or both, that he simply ‘doesn’t feel things that way’.
“Yes, I was. I had the night shift which is exhausting enough, and the appointment with Molly. Dick surprised me by just showing up. He knew about my busy schedule. Normally, he’d sent word beforehand, to ask whether I’d like to meet him and what date and time would suit me. Last time we met before last night, he’d told me he wasn’t going to be around for a while because Lord Moran was spending time in London. That was fine with me. He was all right, but I wasn’t in love with him or anything. As I said, I was very surprised when he showed up last night out of the blue. He seemed changed, too. Normally, he was a charming fellow. Easy-going, generous, not pushy at all. But last night he seemed to be in a dreadful hurry. He asked me strange things.” She flashes Sherlock the briefest of gazes indicating Sergeant Lang, suggesting that there are things she doesn’t want to talk about in the presence of the policeman. Sherlock inclines his head slightly in sign he has understood. “And he insisted on me getting into the car with him. I told him I couldn’t because of work, but he ...”
The girl was awake, a tiny bundle with a wrinkled face like a little red raisin, wrapped in a colourful blanket and wearing a knitted hat with ears that made her look like a small bear. Her features clearly denoted her parentage. She looked like a crumpled up miniature version of both John and Mary, her expression one Sherlock recognised from John: a furrowed brow and downturned corners of her mouth as if disappointed at the world in general. She was even clenching her tiny fists.
“It covered the fireplace,” said John.
“Shut up,” he returns good-naturedly.
They dismounted next to a wooden barn in the shade of a large walnut tree, resting their bikes against the trunk and collapsing on a worn bench surrounding it.
“No, because between spells of utter boredom we were being shot at or blown up, or both. Aliens are the last thing on your mind in that kind of situation. But I can’t imagine the boys in Suffolk sharing that experience.”
“Didn’t know you spoke Italian, too,” said John. “Although it doesn’t surprise me that you do.”
. Seeing him so obviously rattled, Sherlock feels guilty of suspecting him of masturbating earlier when in fact he seems to have had a far less pleasant experience.
“Precisely. When they heard my surname, they expected another Mycroft Holmes and were disappointed when I refused to conform and openly questioned their teaching methods, arcane codes of conduct and unjust forms of punishment. I spent more time in detention than any other boy from my year. Not that I minded. Detention was preferable to activities that held the potential of getting bullied by the others.”
Sherlock’s eyes twinkle. He’s both pleased and amused, it seems. “Well, go ahead, then. You’ll hear no objections from me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
little brother
“It’s not as easy as it seemed when you did it.”
John shrugs, grinning at him. “You tell me.”
Sherlock sniffed. “Will you stop mentioning that?”
And what about him and John? They’d need to talk. Badly. There are so many things hovering between them, things they don’t say. ’Sherlock is actually a girl’s name’. How utterly preposterous. So yes, he was under the influence of drugs then. But seriously? That’s what he came up with when he thought he was going to his death and had one last chance of telling John how he feels? What a complete nutter. On the other hand, sitting down with John, talking ... God, no. The mere thought sends cold waves of fear down Sherlock’s spine. The instance this afternoon was scary, and then only John did the talking. It was brave of him. Sherlock doubts he has his courage. Brave John. And yet, even John didn’t touch the really deep, important issues. His talk only skimmed the surface. Because he, too, knows. Once said, things can’t be unsaid. So better not say them. Keep the status quo.
His grandparents’ garden is beautiful all year round, but particularly in spring. Now in early April the grass is lush and green and dotted with lady’s smock and dandelions. The apple-trees are almost in flower, their white and pink buds about to open any day now. Bees are out and about, and butterflies. The tadpoles in the ditch behind the cottage have already grown little hindlegs. Sherlock wants to go and see them. He wants to run along the narrow, grassy path to the crumbling chalk-cliffs and climb down the steep wooden steps to the beach to hunt for seashells and fossils. But the weather has been cold and windy. Heavy clouds threatening rain are moving in from the sea, and so Sherlock has been confined to the garden with a strong warning not to leave. He has already found all the Easter eggs and chocolate bunnies his parents and grandparents have hidden, even the ones in the more challenging hiding places. He has been told to return to the house because of the worsening weather but managed to bribe Mycroft into letting him stay outside to play with Redbeard a little longer by giving him all of his Cadbury’s eggs.
“Let’s go,” says Sherlock, not wanting to remain in his vicinity. John eyes him, frowning slightly, before levelling a sharp glance at Daniel. Sherlock wonders what, if anything, John has overheard of their exchange. He almost feels like laughing of a sudden. He told Daniel to talk with Vanessa about their relationship. Talking. Does that really solve problems caused by sentiment? Isn’t that just something people say, put in books or post online in those useless self-help forums? Do people actually sit down and talk about these things, ever? Sherlock thinks of his parents. They are still married after so many years and are still very much in love, almost disgustingly so. How do they manage? Do they have a weekly talking session? Surely not. How would that go, anyway? Mummy talking incessantly and Father sitting by humming softly to himself. Ah, but perhaps that’s the secret of their success. Not talking. Listening.
“No, not very often, at least. Sometimes when you bend your head you suddenly acquire a multitude of chins, which admittedly looks funny, especially because one has to wonder where you usually hide them, slim as you are. But other than that ... no, you don’t look silly. With the right illumination, you look either striking or unusual, or a bit alien. But most of the time, you’re just very beautiful.”
“Needless to say,” he begins, “this is a nasty and most inconvenient business, especially with so much else going on at this time. I took the liberty of filling in the gentlemen here on what you reported in your phone call, Miss Hooper. I would like to hear the full account now, if you please. I am sorry for your loss,” he adds in an afterthought. “I gather Miss Wilson was a friend of yours and sharing your billet. Finding her like this must have been quite a shock. Still, the matter needs to be resolved quickly and moreover quietly. It is impossible to completely keep the news from spreading and I’ve already forwarded the case to the local police who will be supervised by a Detective Inspector from Scotland Yard’s homicide division who has the relevant security clearance and has connections to MI5, should they prove necessary. But I must remind you of your strict adherence to the OSA. Miss Wilson’s connection to this place and particularly what we do here at Bletchley Park must not reach the ears of the general public. Remember that if you break parole, you are liable to be executed for high treason.”
Sherlock cocks an eyebrow at him and John grins. “Of course.” He closes the window and begins to strip off his dressing gown.
“My bedroom, tonight.”
“Oh yes, I heard about it,” puts in Miranda. “They called an ambulance because they thought Remington and Gruffudd might have alcohol poisoning or suffering hallucinations from some other drugs. They were raving about having been attacked by dogs and riders, and by wild boar rampaging through their garden. Bob and I went down there on New Year’s to have a look. And the garden really looked as though the boars had rootled there.”
Sherlock glances at him. He looks small next to him, his face pale and lined, the shadows under his eyes prominent in the glaring lights of the hospital corridor. A powerful memory rushes over him: John’s hand gripping his wrist, his voice, broken and desperate, ringing in his ears.
John read on, his voice thick with emotion,
“But you’re the one he snuggles up to at night, right? And you’re the one he composed music for? And you worry about Trevor?” He laughs. “Seriously, John? What happened to your swagger and self-confidence.”
“Very much.”
Back at the table, Tiffany seems to have begun quizzing her father about potential things to do in London. From the French doors, Sherlock watches her and her parents as they talk. Sherlock is relieved to notice that apparently – at least for the moment – practicality seems to have won over grief and upset about her parents’ impending separation. The girl tries to look at the bright side and make the most of her predicament. Sherlock considers this a very mature attitude, and hopes it’ll last. With a stab in his chest he recalls his own reaction to emotional turmoil. He didn’t possess Tiffany’s stability and her positive outlook on life. He envies her a little, then wonders why he takes an interest in the first place. It’s not like him – or is it? He recalls John’s words, his observations about how much, in fact, Sherlock cares about people. He knows John is right, whatever Sherlock tries to tell himself. He does care. And Tiffany is family, albeit removed and estranged.
Sherlock nods in approval. It’s what he would like to ask her as well. He hopes that Lestrade will allow him to tag along again, like he did with Jim.
He turned his head to John, who returned his grave look steadily.
“I still can’t believe it,” he mutters. “I can’t believe that you, bloody stupid idiot that you are, actually fought a duel on my behalf. With actual swords. You ... you’re a complete lunatic.”
his whole appearance screams city-boy and money. His Swiss special edition watch alone costs more than Sherlock’s parents’ car is worth. He obviously works out and owns a sunbed. His tan, however, doesn’t quite disguise a certain pallid touch to his skin, nor does it hide the dark shadows under his eyes. He looks stressed, anxious and downright hostile and suspicious when John steers the Holmesian Vauxhall into his drive. Sherlock spots no signs of Remington’s other car and concludes that Gwendolen hasn’t returned yet.
“You know you had your doubts concerning this venture, John,” came a low rumble as both were gazing into the mobile’s lens and the smiling face of the Australian, “but I think you will agree this has proved extremely enjoyable so far.”
Sherlock lets out a long breath and inclines his head in a nod. “Yes. It’ll be much different from the Prologue. The course is hilly, with one category four climb. And it’s relatively long. Even though my fitness has improved as expected because of the extra training in the Alps, my knee is bothering me more than it should. Mike massaged it and Sarah is treating the pain, but today’s exertion didn’t exactly improve it.”
John grins at him. “Yes, I think I do.”
John decides that first of all, he has to decide what
Picking up the phone again, he sends a text to Sherlock’s brother:
sound from the team, along with a number of hoots and catcalls before everybody quiets down again to listen to him play. Even though he has heard the piece before, John is as touched and moved as during the first time Sherlock played it for him. When he has finished, John can’t help himself. He stands and steps over to Sherlock, gently taking the violin out of his hands and hugging him tightly, kissing his cheek in what for outsiders probably looks like a friendly gesture, but which in fact is a hot, searing kiss accompanied by a fierce whisper of “I love you” into Sherlock’s ear which makes him shudder deliciously.
He presses himself closer. John gasps softly when their hips meet (or rather, when John’s groin meets Sherlock’s thigh). Sherlock shifts and bends his legs slightly so that they align some more. John sucks in a breath, and then suddenly his hands are there, sliding down Sherlock’s back until they have a firm grip on his backside under his jacket. They hold on to it and squeeze. Sherlock almost blacks out when most of his blood is diverted southwards in a rush. He sways slightly but John holds him in place, leaning in and breathing against his ear, “Just so you know, I’d rather hoped you do want to devour me, or do whatever else you like with me. Because seeing you watch me all day long, your eyes so incredibly hungry and your breath hitching at every little touch, or even look, has made me horny as hell.”
“I’d never to anything of the kind.”
Father gives him another of his looks, but Sherlock ignores it. Mummy sighs and nods. “Don’t take too long. I’ve made a special cake for Christopher. Surely you’d want to be there when he cuts it.”
too, for good measure. A moment later he dropped both of them on the duvet again and reached for the t-shirt and pyjama bottoms he slept in. Quickly, he changed into his night gear, hoping he’d be invited to stay the night. Switching off the light and dashing downstairs again, he hoped that Sherlock had managed to stay out of trouble for five minutes.
An excited whistle sounds from the audience when, obviously surprised, she gazes at it, before stooping to pick it up and smell it. Raising her gaze, she inclines her head towards the thrower. Many eyes switch in that direction. Sherlock, too, tries to catch sight of the mysterious admirer. He is situated in one of the private boxes closest to the left side of the stage. Therefore, it’s illuminated sufficiently for Sherlock to make out the uniformed figure of a middle-aged, moustachioed man with short dark hair parted to the side, who is standing and bowing to the singer, before taking his seat again. Sherlock gazes back towards the stage and Irene Adler, smiling thinly to himself. Apparently, the people at Ivy Farm Listening Station know their commanding officer and his habits well.
John laughed. “Well, it should be fun to visit Rendlesham after all this time. Not sure I want to sniff round the base, though, after what happened at Baskerville.”
“And ... the race is on,” comments Sam. “The riders from teams Starbucks, Credit Suisse and Sparkasse are trying to split the breakaway, but our man Jonathan is there to close the gap. Kit is right behind him. They’ve caught the three escapees on the steepest part of the climb, dropping the other three who seem too spent to follow. Eric Hochstätter from Sparkasse tries his luck again, but Jonathan is there once more with Kit following. Wow, this is exciting. There are still almost twenty kilometres to go, so whoever breaks away here better has the legs to ride it to the end. The wind is good, but— oh shit, here goes Urs Camenzind from Credit Suisse, and he’s bloody fast. Jonathan tries to catch him, but he can’t get away. Hochstätter tries to break away, too, and ride up to Camenzind. Kit catches him. Go, Kit! He’s overtaken Hochstätter and is catching up with the man from Switzerland. Jonathan drops back. Good work, Jon. Camenzind and Kit have almost reached the end of the climb and are in range of the stationary cameras of the mountain classification point. Aaaand ... Camenzind gets the three mountain points, Kit fetches two. The other six have formed a group again, out of which Hochstätter appears to be sprinting for the one remaining mountain point. But unless they work together real well they won’t catch the two at
John sighs, puts down the piece of wood he’s been holding. “You’re incredibly attractive, and witty, and clever, and charming, too, when you’re not being an arsehole to people, and—”
Not that John and the other riders can fully enjoy the views and the atmosphere, having to concentrate, and concentrate hard, on cycling now. While the GC hopefuls stay together for the time being, eyeing each other and their competitors’ teammates critically, ready to thwart attacks and unleash counterattacks at any moment, some riders competing for the polka-dot jersey make a dash for it. Again, Anderson is among them, but he doesn’t manage to keep up, still bothered by his injuries. He even apologises via radio when he has to drop back into the peloton, his hopes of regaining the jersey dashed for good now. Greg, Sam and Sally as well as his teammates try to cheer him up as best they can. John knows what a big disappointment this must be for Anderson who worked hard all year to wear the mountain jersey in Paris. But this is the Tour and having worn it already for several days is a huge achievement.
“No. Yes. Damn it.” John let out an exasperated breath. Sherlock’s words had hit very close to the truth. Sherlock did indeed know him well.
“I had broken into one of the organisation’s operating bases, a townhouse in Frankfurt where they had established a small but vital and extremely well-connected hacker community. I wanted to retrieve information not accessible elsewhere. Moreover, I had heard about a possibility to disable or at least sabotage their main servers by planting a virus designed by some friends of mine. It had do be done physically, because the systems were too well protected against digital assaults. But the virus did not work as well as it should, and the place was much better guarded than my contacts had told me. Moreover, the people watching it were sharper and better equipped than those I had encountered before. Either that, or somebody had tipped them off, told them to be extra watchful. Anyway, I managed to get in alright, but the interior layout did not fit the intelligence I had gathered from the outside. Reaching my destination took more time than anticipated, and through some minor act of carelessness I lost one of the keys I needed to reach the room I was aiming for. They noticed there was an intruder about, began to comb the building, and to cut a long story short, I was caught.
“Doesn’t it? Only it’s not mine. Sherlock has been baking and doing things in the kitchen ever since you left in the morning. He says it’s for a case, but I think he got carried away again a little, the dear man. Go up and have a look.”
John exchanges a glance with Sherlock. “Yes, I will write, as often as I can,” John promises solemnly. Under the table, his leg slides against Sherlock’s. Sherlock swallows and ducks his head. Letters. They’re going to be the only link to John in the future. Better than nothing, but still only a small comfort. And how often will John be able to write, anyway? Well, he can write every day, but when will he be able to post his letters, or receive Sherlock’s? What will distance do to their relationship? Will it endure? Sherlock thinks of their grass-rings, of the promise they symbolise. He knows that for him, this promise is binding.
