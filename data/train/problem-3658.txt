A sinew in Sam’s jaw pulses as he works to bite his tongue. Castiel sees the hurt and anger in his eyes. The way Sam physically braces himself and stands taller in defiance.
For a moment, Dean’s not sure how to react. He’d braced himself for a useless platitude. For Castiel to comfort and reassure him without knowing if things would really be alright.
He’d once strayed kisses and licks from Dean’s nipples, up his chest, to his armpit, and nearly gotten smacked in the face. Dean clearly liked it, if the way, he’d blushed and spluttered had been any indication, but he still seemed reluctant and self-conscious when it came to indulging that particular pleasure. As much as Castiel enjoys the thought of burying his face in the apex of Dean’s scent, it makes Dean uncomfortable in some way, so he resists.
Immediately Castiel spoons him, molding to his back and mouthing at his shoulder. “Love how these freckles taste.”
The realization comes to Castiel like a gunshot to the head. They’re flirting. They were– he was intruding. He staggers back, nearly tripping over his own feet, and all but runs out of the cabin.
“Well, shit.” Dean has no idea how to begin to handle this, so he falls back on an old defense. “You just– you pretty much blew our cover. Now they’ll know you’re an accomplice and we can never bury a body together.”
But Castiel just huffs, amused. He meets Dean’s gaze steadily, and smiles. It transforms him, and steals Dean’s breath away.
“I just wanted to thank you for that,” Castiel explains, speaking hastily. He looks just as embarrassed as Dean feels.
The phone buzzes. It’s the phone, it must be. Castiel tries to keep from opening his eyes. It is the phone. It could be Sam. He gives up and opens his eyes. He doesn’t need to look around to confirm what he already knows. Dean is gone.  Dean was never here. But angels don’t sleep. Angels don’t dream.
Yes. Of course. Jack had died. Poor, dead Jack. And all the poor people mourning the loss of poor, dead Jack. Castiel will be needed at the store room. Their little inter-faith oasis. He needs to be there. So Castiel follows the men to the store room and staunchly tries not to think of Dean or Risa.
The drive is short and tense. As they near the towering building, Dean slows the car. There’s a big red bus stopped haphazardly in the middle of the road. The windows are sprayed with blood. Torn limbs litter the sidewalk beside it, and the driver’s side window is smoking.
“You’re not dying,” Dean says, grim and calm. “The bullet grazed your shoulder. It’s a little deep so I’m gonna stitch you up and we’ll hit the road.”
The man opens his mouth to answer, but Castiel never finds out what he was about to say because he gets shot in the head. The bullet blows a hole through his right eye, splattering his brains against the wall behind him. Castiel rolls without thinking, making for the cover of the desk. He reaches it and finds the man crumpled on the floor, dead.
“My vessel has. The former owner of my vessel,” Castiel replies, looking out through the lines of the fence. Beyond, the green of the woods rustle and stir in a breeze. “He was married. He had a daughter.”
Dean slams a fist down. Files cascade to the floor, glossy pictures of dead kids fanning out at his feet. “Don’t you get it, Cas? This is it. There is no picture bigger than the small towns no one gives a shit about. We save them and we save the whole world and everyone in between. That’s how this works. The moment we give up on them– the rest of it? Doesn’t matter. It’s what we do. Save people. And as far as I’m concerned? That whole town out there is full of people that need saving. So I’m gonna do my job. With or without you.”
Castiel hasn’t lost his grasp on languages yet. He still thinks in Enochian, and he spent the afternoon translating an Aramaic text.
It’s true. And thankfully it’s also a good, somewhat safe answer. Oh, and Dean will take that shot after all. He deserves it now.
“Believe me, I did. You’re no use to us gone on pain, jumping at the drop of a hat. It’s all hands on deck, Cas.”
Charlie glances between them, chewing on her lip. She probably already figures it’s not stage fright that’s causing the cold feet. Dean opens his mouth, groping for an excuse, but the door to the studio opens, and Cas walks in.
He turns pink as soon as he admits it aloud. God, he’s beautiful. Despite the situation, Castiel feels… pleased. There’s this warm, almost fuzzy feeling in his chest. He’ll deal with Charlie later.
He briefly considers shaving and decides against it. When he looks in the mirror this time, he sees himself differently. He’s fragile. Human. Pink about his lips and the tips of his ears and the corners of his eyes. Fallen and breaking. It's an ugly sight.
“I don’t?” Cas scoffs. “I practically grew up with her. You’re rude and belligerent to her all the time. Can you really blame her for responding in kind?”
Silence. For nearly a minute. The bustle of the restaurant continues around them, and Castiel forces him to dwell in the silence instead of taking refuge.
“It’s not a bad idea. Runnin’ low on toilet paper, too. It’s a matter of civilization, son. Don’t wanna be wiping my ass with leaves if I can avoid it.” It’s Jack, the older hunter who’d made the suggestion about the generators. His voice is light, his smile easy. Some of the tension dissipates.
"Dean…" Castiel stops, suddenly conflicted. He's different now. Dean is different, too. But it doesn't change the past. "Dean understood."
He gets off the step-stool, glancing at the clock as he hurriedly ties on his apron. There’s already someone waiting in the drive-thru even though there’s about ten minutes before they open, but Dean hurries to check his phone anyway.
“We’re running on fumes, Dean,” he says earnestly. He looks a little afraid, but seems to regain some confidence after sparing Castiel a glance. “Look, what you’re doing obviously takes priority, no argument there, but we’re sitting ducks here. One of the boys caught the flu the other day and it looks like it's spreading.”
It’s strange. Being fed. Being looked after. It’s not like Dean at all. And there lies the weakness. But Castiel doesn’t want to look a gift horse in the mouth. He accepts every bite Dean holds up for him and he never points out that even with his rotting grace, he can still taste the molecules. Castiel keeps his eyes fixed on the bowl, on Dean’s fingers cupped around it and the steady, unwavering gentleness with which he spoons out another bite and brings it to Castiel’s lips. Minutes pass in the silence and Castiel can’t tolerate the tenderness anymore. The kindness. The crushing magnitude of his mistakes weighs too heavily. He doesn’t deserve it. He didn’t save Dean.
“In a minute,” Sheriff Mills says, still annoyed. “Dean,” she continued, turning him around to face her. “I have to know. You quit working for Crowley, right?”
Castiel is already warm and drowsy from the wine, so it doesn’t take a lot to knock him out. He has saccharine dreams about a beautiful man who kisses him until they melt together.
Dean grits his teeth, and says, “If you ever loved me. If it was ever true, then you would do this for me.”
Dean waits for him to log off, but then he reaches out and tugs Castiel by his tie. It catches Castiel by surprise, but he goes along so he doesn’t choke. When Dean kisses him, Castiel melts into it.
“I haven't,” Castiel says, feeling dejected. “We could just leave, if you prefer. I’ll take the fall for it and make sure Charlie doesn't hassle you.”
Castiel sits back, stunned. He’s not sure what to make of it. From the looks of it, Dean’s struggling with the same thing.
“Have a nice day, Mrs. Moseley,” he smiles, even though she just glares and shakes her head at him. Over her shoulder, he can see Benny behind the pharmacy counter lounging in a chair. Lucky bastard.
Castiel a lot. He’d wanted it to be… something. And maybe the worst part is that he doesn’t even remember the good, sexy stuff. He can’t even choose not to regret it if they’d had a great time because he has no idea how good or terrible it was. He has no idea what Castiel is thinking about it, or how Castiel feels. Time to get outta here.
The summer’s mellowed out, and a gentle breeze sets in around the early evening. The weather is perfect. They get a precious few days like this. And Dean’s stuck at the register, scanning batteries and milk for an elderly woman.
Dean is on the floor, coughing, caught in a chokehold by a Croat. His gun has been kicked a few feet away and he’s struggling against the grip, but clearly failing as he turns blue.
Castiel’s vision swims. His grace ebbs, wisps fragmenting into threads and disappearing into the ether. He’s so weak he can’t feel his wings. They probably burned up in the flight.
For a few disheartening minutes, there’s no response. Castiel beats himself up for getting his hopes up. For building castles in the sky. For imagining things.
Castiel quickly programs the number into his phone as a contact, even as he questions the decision. Does he really want to save the contact information of someone he doesn’t really know? Someone who accidentally texted him. Apparently, yes. He does.
Might be 3 years before I post again, so read up folks! I kid, I kid. I mean, I'll make every attempt to not take that long, but... no promises.
After all, everyone in Castiel’s life knows about Daphne. Their nuptials are a matter of when, not if.
“My grace is depleted. At this point, I’m more human than angel. That means I lose consciousness, I bleed. I’m forgetting things.”
By the time Castiel finishes typing out the long-winded message, he’s not sure he should send it. What is he doing here? Accidentally impersonating someone and getting involved in a stranger’s personal affairs. Nothing good can come of this. Especially if it comes back to bite him in the ass, and Castiel knows that these things have a way of doing that. Besides, it’s not his place to offer advice like this. All he knows about this stranger is how he looked a decade ago in an embarrassing photograph, and about an hour’s worth of text messages.
"So it's a plural now?" Dean hedges, struggling to keep up, and still trying for some reason. He decided not to question the impulse.
Castiel decides to break his silence. “Dean. I could go. You can still continue your trip as planned. The smaller towns should have a considerably depleted population. There would be no need to spare useful manpower. I can go alone, or with one armed escort.”
The sky is red. The last shattering, electric bluewhite light of the grace cracks like thunder, whips an echoing sonic blast that shocks the air. Wings are scorched into the pitted, barren, wounded sand. The angel is dead. And it's over. The Mark rends a triumphant shriek that splits the earth beneath him. He falls to his knees and breaks. Blood soaks his thighs. Rises to engulf him. Blood that's not his. Blue eyes, unblinking. Hell is here. Now. Forever. The air clogs with the stench of fear -- terror -- blue -- blood -- blade --
“Hey, Cas. Thought the Coffee Grind was too expensive for you,” he teases, ringing up Castiel’s order. He goes to start making it and Castiel follows him along the counter.
“I haven’t experienced it yet,” Castiel says, looking at Dean now, trying to gauge his response. “I think I’d prefer being an omega. It sounds most tolerable.”
“They’re standard. All the other coup– groups answered them,” Sam insists, defensive. “Just pick up the next card. Keep going.”
The year passes in a blink, seasons fading away gradually. Dean actually kinda loves his job. The CVS across the street closes. Sam graduates and starts working full time.
“Looks like a gunshot to the head took her down,” the medical examiner crouched by the body offers. “She was shot from behind. Kid over there got the jump on her.” He jerks a thumb over his shoulder to a boy sitting on the steps of Gilbert Hall, covered in a blanket, talking to a detective.
Castiel shivers into the warmth. Dean radiates heat and light. He always has. It’s comforting. Castiel's chest is still burning and his throat is raw, but somehow, he feels better. He leans into the touch gratefully and at long last turns to look at Dean. Drinks in the sight of him. The rueful green eyes, the fine lines around them, the gentle set of his mouth.
Castiel looks away uncomfortably. They’re in the cafeteria, and people around them turn to stare. Charlie doesn’t appear to notice or care. She’s holding her hair in her hands, looking at him in shock.
They're driving back from a trip to fucking Hot Topic when Dean wants to reach across the bench seat and rest his hand on Cas' knee. The urge creeps up on him, and he's halfway across when he catches it. He saves himself by swooping for the radio dial, and fiddles with it even though he'd been perfectly happy letting some kid implore a one night stand to stay with him. Nothing made sense anymore. More so than usual. A shitty tribal tattoo was controlling him, he'd taken an angel shopping in some teenage hipster store, and he'd just nearly tried to fondle said angel's knee. Ever since the Taylor Swift debacle, he just gave in and unwound to some Top 50 trash every now and then. Usually when Sam wasn't around. Reluctantly, Dean switched back to the classic rock station for something to do.
Castiel hesitates. He considers explaining himself. Maybe apologizing. Dean’s fists are clenched in the sheets. He’s radiating anger and stress. It layers over the scent of his arousal. No, Castiel decides. He’s not going to explain himself when it’s clear Dean's not in the mood to listen. He’s certainly not going to apologize either. That leaves him with one option. Really, the only option. So he leaves.
Dean nods, looking marginally hopeful. He scarfs down his burger. “This is good. It’s pretty good, Cas. You did good.”
It’s best to follow the path of least resistance, Castiel decides. If he ignores it, nothing will come of it, and in the morning he can delete the entire thread and that’ll be the end of it.
Dean spends a few minutes in the parking lot, weighing his options. He could go upstairs and fall into Castiel’s waiting arms. Watch a movie, be comforted. Or he can cross the street, march into Auto Singer and demand an answer. He drums his fingers on the steering wheel, nervous, and then decides. Fuck it.
Cas puts his elbow on the table and his chin in his hand and peers at Dean. He’s staring. Dean fluffs his shirt in a pathetic attempt to dispel the heat.
“Sleep,” Dean coaxes. His voice rumbles, reverberating through the palm Castiel has pressed against his chest.
Castiel leans closer. “The milk is about thirty five cents more expensive at CVS,” he says in a conspiratorial whisper. “It doesn’t seem like much, but it adds up over time, you know.”
Dean’s equal parts relieved and frustrated that Castiel hasn’t discovered his morning wood yet. “I could eat,” he says lightly, turning his back on Castiel.
The feeling, though without explicit factual basis, is impossible to ignore or shake off. He disobeys the direct order and turns the engine off. He sets the rifle aside. He’s not confident with it and might end up losing it in a struggle. He slips the keys in his pocket, locks the jeep, and enters the shop with his gun raised. Safety off. Ready to shoot.
“There’s a book of witchcraft called the Book of the Damned. No one’s seen it in a millennia. There’s no mention of it anywhere except in a single passage from a medieval hunter’s journal. He mentions that the witch he killed possessed the book, and among its many secret treasures was a spell to trap the devil. However, he couldn’t read it, and it was stolen from him before he could decipher it.”
Not for the first time, Dean feels terrible. Cas tried to find a sense of purpose for himself. And instead of letting him be, Dean went and dragged him through a hunt to rub his face in the misguided desolation of the rest of his kind.
Dean stares at the shut door for a moment, clenching his fists at his sides. He takes a few stabilizing breaths and then turns to face Castiel. As he walks by, Castiel is overcome with the urge to touch him. To comfort him. Castiel ignores the urge.
“And they will continue to die after you foolishly sacrifice yourself. Lucifer will destroy this planet.”
No. Fuck it. He’s head over heels. All he gets is small glimpses, but he knows enough to have caught a bad case of the feelings. He’s seen Castiel at his best, clean-shaven, dressed in a suit that’s just a little too big for him, looking mouth-wateringly good.
, a present from his brother Gabriel – and turns off the bedside lamp. It’s no secret that Gabriel is not very fond of Daphne, so Castiel suspects Gabriel bought it because he found the title amusing and fitting. Despite that, it’s an interesting read.
The next customer steps up, and Dean greets the guy with automatic, manufactured cheer. “Hey, how’s it going? You find everything okay?”
A siren whoops in the distance, and the police car jerks onto the street sharply. The officer from earlier stumbles out, face ashen. “Agent Costello. Please hurry. The kids from the dorm, the previous shooting– I– I don’t understand what’s happening.”
“Oh. No.” Castiel stares at the devil’s trap on the floor. “One of these lines is wearing thin. You should probably redo it.” I
Cas gives him a funny look like he's sort of offended Dean doesn't think the cat is cute, but he says nothing.
She pulls him in for a hug, and Castiel holds her until she pulls away. He’ll miss her, he realizes. Her friendship, and her warmth. They spent five years of their lives together. She must’ve had hopes and dreams. She must’ve made plans, and yet. Castiel knows that he’d abandoned them for a long time now.
“How’s the pain?” Dean asks, turning the TV off. Castiel doesn’t have to look at him to know Dean’s watching him.
“Oh, good,” Dean huffs, relieved. He sags against the doorjamb and drops his jacket. “I mean, not that I didn’t–”
“So,” he says, chewing away stickily at a huge bite. “Girl living in the apartment behind the motel was a student at the university here. No family or friends here, but kids from her classes know her. She had two weeks left on her lease when she snapped and went on a murder spree. The ones that survived said they saw her eyes turn black, smelled sulfur, the works.”
Dean grits his teeth, but relaxes a few moments later. He clears their dishes away. Castiel thinks he’s going to be ignored again, but Dean eventually sighs.
Dean gets up, and helps himself to a beer with a false cheeriness. It's ten in the morning here. It's six in the evening somewhere, if anyone asks. No one's asking. In light of the Mark, Dean supposes crippling alcoholism is the lesser of possible evils. Cas is still focussed on the avocado salad. Sam's making his coconut milk latte for Charlie in the kitchen probably. Dean's not sure, so he assumes. He's about to open his mouth and say something to Cas, but Cas plops the bright, buttery, lime green flesh of the avocado in his mouth, and Dean stops to stare at the explosion of expressions that cross Cas' features.
“Don’t look at me like that,” Dean says, quiet and worn, so Castiel looks away obediently. Later, he draws Castiel’s attention once more, pressing a few pills into his hand. When Castiel swallows them, Dean helps him sit up and drink some water.
“S’okay,” Dean mumbles. “You always come back.” He sits and takes a drink even though it’s out of turn, and picks up a card. “If I killed somebody would you help me cover up?”
“I know what it is. The human biological drive to procreate. My question is- what does it involve? Why does Sam need to be alone–“
Sam draws in a sharp breath. “Dean?” In the moment of silence that follows, he seems to recover. “Okay. That’s not a bad idea. Maybe it’s some sort of chain reaction to the angels closing up Heaven. It could be that the demons are getting trapped in the bodies they possess.”
“‘Cuz you’re a nerdy little accountant who sits up here in his glass tower with his nose glued to his screen,” Dean teases, sitting on the edge of Castiel’s desk. “I mean, how else would I be at the Christmas party, dude? Remember? Where I first saw you, blah blah?”
They're sitting in the store room when Chuck blurts the question. He's checking their inventory and accordingly adjusting the rations. Everyone else has left. Castiel decided to stay behind because he has nowhere else to be. And he'd rather not be left alone with his thoughts. When combined with feelings and his amateur grasp of them, thoughts tend to be dangerous.
Castiel follows, expecting an impromptu meeting in Dean’s room, but Dean leads him towards his own cabin. He doesn’t talk until he’s herded Castiel inside and shut the door behind himself.
“You just said you found me attractive. When we first met you propositioned me.” Cas pauses, getting that far away, puzzle-solving look. “I always thought it was a drunken mistake on your part.”
It’s tedious working in Accounting, but Castiel prefers it to IT. Zachariah may be tough and a little unjust sometimes, but he’s a far cry from the guy who heads IT. Dick Roman easily takes the crown for the worst boss. Castiel has no idea how Charlie is able to work under someone like him. Unlikeable superiors notwithstanding, Castiel works hard because it’s part of the plan. Work hard, provide for Daphne, build a home and life with her. It’s been a while since Castiel was actually sure he wants this life, but he keeps at it because he doesn’t really know any other way to be.
Dean goes to check out, and the balding Indian man behind the motel’s reception desk snorts awake when Dean slaps the bell on his desk. Dean grins, but the beta mutters under his breath and glares balefully at them.
As it turns out, the man Castiel believed to be named Mark is actually named Jim. And he was right. The camp goes down in little over a day. The pathways between the cabins are deserted. The cabins go through a reshuffling of occupants.
Castiel orders a coffee as well. Dean gets an OJ. They sit there for a moment after Lisa leaves with their order and Dean feels out of sorts.
“I’m nothing,” Dean says with so much venom that his voice shakes. Tears well in his eyes but don't fall. “I had one job. I had to protect one kid and I couldn’t do it. What makes you think I can protect these people?”
Castiel pauses, recalling Anna and Uriel. He hedges on, aware of Chuck listening intently. "I don't hate it here. I just don't belong here. The agony is pervasive and persistent. The ablutions are endless and exhausting. I am constantly tired. Sometimes the ache is triggered by emotions. I'm not accustomed to feeling so much."
“You’re gonna have to shut the gates of hell to do that,” Dean says. He nods, resigned and looks down at his open palms. “With me inside.”
Castiel feels too weak to do more than push himself up onto his elbows. Sweat beads across his forehead. He perseveres and tries to swing his legs over the edge of the bed. “When are you leaving?”
Dean stares at him and then looks down, pinching the bridge of his nose. He sighs, haggard, and reaches for the beer on his nightstand. It’s empty.
“What about the big showdown with the Devil?” Dean asks, looking confused. “What, Michael’s just gonna walk away?”
Castiel loses his patience. “This is futile. If we don’t stop Lucifer, there will be hundreds of thousands more towns like this. Billions of people. Something is wrong in this town but it is not important right now–”
They don’t talk about Sam now. They talk about Lucifer, which is really, the only way to talk about Sam. Sam is why Dean ever talks anymore. To bring an end to Lucifer (Sam) was the only way to right this wrong and finish what was started. It’s that simple. Castiel frowns at the floor.
“Good man.” Dean smiles and lets go of Castiel to pick up the bowl and Castiel immediately draws his hands up to accept it. “Uh-uh.” Dean shakes his head, holding the bowl close to his chest and stirring the soup to cool it. “You might spill. I got this.” He meets Castiel’s gaze and smiles again. This time, Castiel tries to return it.
He tries to retrace his steps. He remembers going home with Castiel. He remembers Castiel opening a bottle of wine. He remembers getting through half the bottle, and he remembers turning to kiss Castiel when one of the nurses kissed Dr. Sexy. It had seemed like a great idea at the time.
The nerves make Castiel’s stomach tie up in knots. Their waiter chooses that moment to bring them dinner, and Castiel busies himself, feeling guilty and grateful.
He can feel the gravity of their situation settle on Dean’s shoulders. Dean goes a little pale, and scrubs a hand over his face and through his hair.
“Yeah.” Charlie’s smile is sheepish, sympathetic. “That’s the lights. They heat up the room. So where’s Cas?” she asks, nudging him with her elbow.
From the doorway, Dean snorts. He’s chewing on a sandwich. “Forget about Heaven. They’ll catch up with us. We go after Lucifer.”
“Dean knows you’re a terrible liar!” Charlie says triumphantly. She pumps her fist in the air. “I knew it. I knew you’d be the weakest link.”
Dean picks up the next card. He knows the answer already. “Have you ever had a crush on someone I’ve been with?”
“Is it true that the alphas suffer the worst biological cycles?” Castiel asks, trying to change the subject. It’s not a very subtle effort. Dean takes it in his stride. Discomfort at the topic appears to be overruled by a grudging sense of responsibility.
“Yeah, I got that.” This time the laugh shakes Dean’s shoulders. “How much has it added up to? Like five bucks? I’m worth five bucks? You flatter me, Cas.” Honestly, he can’t remember the last time he felt so good. Just a plain, openly good, happy giddiness. No smoke and mirrors seduction, no games, no pretenses.
“Save it,” Crowley interrupts, looking bored. “I can’t have employees trooping in and out of here whenever they please.”
Dean checks his phone. No new texts, but the last one was only ten minutes ago. “He’s on his way,” he says, pocketing his phone. “So– what’s the deal, anyway? What am I doing? And why?”
Luckily, Jess steps in to introduce herself, and then she and Kevin put Castiel to work setting the table pretty quickly. Dinner is actually ridiculously delicious. The turkey smells divine, and Dean gorges himself on everything from the freshly baked rolls to the fluffy potatoes and the sweet mashed acorn squash.
The praise feels good. Castiel can admit that much to himself. He’s spent stifling months feeling utterly useless, and now he’s found something. He’s useful without his powers. It’s reassuring. As dismal as things look, Castiel can’t help but also feel a little hopeful. They might just be able to pull this off. And yet, it just doesn't feel right.
When he shifts, the bed creaks in protest. A tickle in his throat triggers the first cough and that sets off many more. It’s painful. It doesn't abate for what feels like forever. What a strange thought. As an angel, he has spent millennia under heaven's orders. He has a real idea of the true measure of eternity. And yet, here he is, all too human and unable to tolerate more than a few moments of pain.
“Thankfully, it was in still in one piece. I think you used up the last of your juice getting us back here.” He puts pressure on Castiel’s shoulder while Sam heats up a needle. “Sew him up. I’m gonna get some grub.”
This close, Dean can see his eyelashes individually. He can smell Cas’ bodywash - the same one he sometimes sneakily uses so he can pretend it’s the smell of Cas’ skin lingering on him. And he can smell Cas’ breath, hot and sticky from the liquor and juice. Dean’s gaze drops to Cas’ mouth and he wets his lips, suddenly feeling parched.
“It doesn’t matter,” Castiel says, spearing the salad bowl with a decisive stab. “We’re not together anymore. We were never in love. I was with her because it was the easy thing to do and now–”
“No,” Cas grumbles, pushing his head under Dean’s arm to force Dean onto his back so Cas can nestle up against his side. “Don’t go.”
Castiel searches Dean’s eyes in the shadow of the horrific mask that lurks just beneath Dean’s skin and finds the truth still there, buried deep within. The startling green that God created for his favourites– the new season fields of Kansas, the most ancient of forests, the breathtaking colour of life and rebirth . He finds the brightness of the very best of humanity, that the world tried to stamp out and erase, still exist. And the man Castiel loved, even bearing the corruption of the basest, fallen creatures, still eons better than the most loftiest of angels.
Dean appears to take pity on him. “I should probably start at the beginning. Charlie invited me to the office Christmas party last year and I saw you. I had– well, still do. Have this massive, um, crush. On you.”
Taking stock of himself, he’s grateful to find he’d had the sense to slept in pajamas. Dean had handed over a pair that Castiel suspects originally belonged to Bobby. They’re pinstriped blue, and they’re both too loose and too short for him, but they do the job.
Where had he gone? Castiel had gone to hell, too. Oh, and he went willingly. He went to hell and he never truly came back. For Castiel made a fatal mistake: he touched the bare soul of a man corrupted and tortured and broken.
It’s true, humanity is painful. The amputation of his grace leaves Castiel over-sensitive to stimuli at first. Touch stings. Tastes overwhelm. Smells nauseate. Sounds, however, are bearable. Perhaps, Castiel reasons, it’s to do with being used to much higher frequencies. A greater sense of being. It’s not like there’s a self-help book for fallen angels. He spends a lot of the first fortnight of his fall struggling to mask his flinches and winces. He makes an effort not to protest aloud. If Dean notices, he chooses not to comment on it. Dean doesn’t comment on much lately.
Dean’s seething on the inside all over again, but he rolls his eyes and walks to the table, flopping onto one of the stools. Charlie’s clearly dying to ask, but to her credit she keeps her mouth shut.
Until someone clears their throat, and Cas springs back, startled. Full lips and cheeks flushed, dark hair mussed, eyes blown with lust and interest.
“Good morning, Dean,” Castiel mumbles. He’s rubbing his eyes and suppressing a yawn, but when he finishes, he smiles at Dean. “I think I’m still a little drunk. Did you sleep well?”
When Dean jumps, Castiel realizes he’d reached out and his fingers are now curled around Dean’s wrist. Dean’s wrist, where his pulse hammers under Castiel’s fingertips. Where the skin, soft and lightly furred with hair that glimmers gold in the sun, is enticingly hot.
Cas doesn’t turn at the sound of his voice, but his shoulders loosen and sag. “The things humans - people - create are so ingenious.”
Castiel answers the question, if only so Dean won’t overthink a little massage. “Daphne sent me an invite to her birthday. I believe she’s throwing a party in her new home."
Dean raises his eyebrows in challenge, but the effect is ruined by the fact that he can’t stop grinning like a fool. Determined to give Castiel a little bit of a hard time, Dean shrugs. He expects Castiel to push back and come on stronger, but Castiel just gives him a sidelong smile, and relaxes. They finish their beers and pick their way through the (surprisingly delicious) potato salad slowly, and Dean finds himself talking about things. Sharing his hopes for what he wants to do once Sam graduates. Confessing that he’s applied to Singer Auto across the street from the CVS.
The first picture is mostly washed out, but still recognizable as the man with the cowboy hat, only about a decade older. Dean sends it accompanied with the caption–
Then Dean shakes himself because he’d find the staring kinda creepy, and heads onward to the kitchen.
Dean sighs, defeated. “I was gonna come back in a few days. I just needed to be... I needed some air.”
Dean sighs, and starts moving around. He heads to the bathroom for a while and returns in different clothes. A sweet scent wafts from the bathroom. Castiel tunes it out, or tries to, but it clings to Dean’s skin. He sniffs, head starting to turn in Dean’s direction.
“It’s only just begun.” Castiel grabs Dean’s arm to stop him from pacing, and points to the floor. It’s one of the boys from the dorm, hanging onto life by a thread.
Dean shrugs. “If that’s what it takes. You’re headed out the door jonesing for a hit of demon blood for when–“
For a while Castiel is silent, collecting his thoughts on the matter. "Heaven wasn't what it was meant to be for a long time. However, it was what it was for a very long time. And I was part of it for a long time. I grieve the loss of my brothers. I miss them. I have a recurring dream that they're just stationed at a different garrison and I will be reunited with them in a few centuries."
“You don’t have to, Cas,” Dean manages a few moments later. “Listen, you ever need anything, a place to crash or whatever, just call, okay?” Considering what Castiel has done for Sam, it’s the least Dean can do. And honestly, it’s not even just about that. Castiel is a genuinely nice guy, who’s clearly alone, and a little off-beat. He’s been dealt a bad hand. Dean wants to help him because he likes Castiel. And, he gets the feeling that Castiel is quite deserving. He deserves all the good things.
When Castiel looks up, he sees that the impromptu foot rub has been cause for some embarrassment. Dean’s watching him, cheeks pink, lip caught under his teeth.
Dean usually stops whatever he’s doing to hang out at the counter so Castiel won’t have to wait. He’s even stopped chatting with Benny as soon as Castiel walks in, when he usually lets other customers to walk up to the counter before he does that.
He’s also seen Castiel looking like he rolled out of bed on two hours of sleep. Honestly, Dean’s not sure if the cleaned up look or the sex hair-and-bee-pajamas are worse for his heart. Either way, he watches Castiel on the monitor like a stalker, and tries to come up with something smart to say. He never quite succeeds.
At the table, Dean ends up sandwiched between Castiel and Sam, and it's really fun to watch Castiel and Charlie get on like a house on fire. Kevin and Sam talk loudly with each other over some issues with their classes, and Jess engages Dean in conversation about the TV shows they both watch. Now that Dean knows Sam was friends with the guy he’d been crushing on for about a year, Dean thinks it’s a little odd that Sam’s never had Castiel over before. When Castiel excuses himself to use the bathroom and doesn’t ask for directions, Dean realizes that Castiel’s been to their home before. Dean just wasn’t around for it. Figures.
“The way this progressed– it makes no sense. It was like the demons were possessing people that every possessed person came in contact with. Like they were spreading some kind of demon cooties. Is that something that’s even possible?”
He’s no stranger to denying himself. He knows how to do that. He doesn’t want to anymore. Cas makes him want to indulge himself a little.
Castiel sighs and copies the movement. Something in his shoulder pops audibly. His back arches and he pushes higher before relaxing with a sigh. Dean was right.
It costs him. The Mark screams in fury, burns hotter than the flesh memories of hell. Skin melting, sizzling and ripping, sticking to wet, black, thorned whips. But. It's Cas. Mouth filled with blood, heart broken. Everything broken. Dean has pinned him down like a helpless bug and torn his wings, crushed him to dust. Dean fights back, and pays for it. He brings the blade down in a book, and he backs off, trembling, running.
“Disastrous.” Dean takes another step into the room and it reveals a long spatter of dried blood up the side of his jeans. “City’s an all-out war zone. Military’s gunning down everything that moves ‘cuz they’re overrun by Croats and they don’t go down easy.” He crosses his arms and admits, “Lost two guys. One of ‘em was slow. Always been a careless deadweight. The other– he was... good. Unlucky.”
Dean starts to say yes before he even thinks about it before he remembers he’s got an afternoon shift. “Shit, what time is it?”
“If you’re actually asking,” Dean elaborates with exaggerated patience. “I’m saying yes. Yes, I wanna do it. I’ll marry your dumb ass.”
“I’ve never been up here,” Dean admits, running his fingers over the monitor. “It’s very… stuffy. And musty. The tenth floor is more space age, less old-dead-guy’s-office.”
And he’s happy to support Sam. Play a starring role in the show while his brother goes off to save the world or whatever.
“I shouldn’t have refused you, Dean,” Castiel says, watching Dean fish around the rudimentary, depleted first-aid box for some bandages to cover the wound. “For whatever it’s worth, I– well. I wish I hadn’t. I do want...”
Dean heaves an exaggerated sigh before facing the camera. “I’m Dean. I’m the dumbass director’s older brother. I’m a mechanic–”
“I do,” Castiel says with a hard smile and Dean looks up abruptly. He stares at Castiel, lips pressing into a grim, flat line. He takes a breath, words waiting at the tip of his tongue but he swallows them instead. He says nothing.
!” Jess laughs and butts her way into the hug, and Dean wraps an arm around her as well. “About friggin’ time!” he cheers, and kisses her forehead.
“Aw, Cas, I missed you too.” Dean means for it to be teasing, but it comes out all shy and stupid, and both he and Castiel blush. As a joke, he scrawls his number on the cup before he hands it to Castiel.
“Fuck,” Dean mutters, rubbing circles along Castiel’s lower back as Castiel takes him deeper. “Cas, I’m so close babe–” he tapers off into a moan.
When he gets back to his office, he checks his phone out of habit before putting it away, and finds that his mystery texter has responded with one word.
“Yeah, Cas was a tutor for that Math class I took last year,” Sam explains. “Thanks for the recommendation letter, man,” he adds to Castiel, who blushes a little and murmurs something self-deprecating. “Come on in. I gotta go grab some half and half.”
“I can’t heal,” Castiel points out, watching as Dean pushes his shoes under the bed, out of the way. “My grace is–”
"The what now?" Dean asks, thoroughly befuddled. Speaking of things that made less sense than normal, an Angel of the Lord was schooling him on social media. And emoticons. One of the many inexplicable texts Dean had received from Cas involved tiny pictures of a yellow face with x'd out eyes and a knife, followed by a question mark. Apparently Dean was supposed to gather from that gibberish that Cas was asking him how the vamp nest takedown had gone.
“Were you planning on leaving without saying anything?” Castiel asks. “Would you have left me behind if I hadn’t caught you?”
“Yup.” Dean watches as Castiel walks away and then calls, “Hey, Cas!” His heart skips a beat and does a funny swoop thing all at once when Castiel turns to look at him, head cocked to the side adorably. Dean winks, and says, “Call me.”
Castiel wants to go there. In the privacy of his own mind, he’s willing to admit that he probably has a problem. He could (and has) spent hours teasing and spreading Dean open. There’s so many things to love about pleasuring Dean, but Dean certainly doesn’t help matters by making the most addictive sounds. Castiel is rightly, justifiably, obsessed.
“... deputy shot him thrice, and claims that he stopped moving after the shot to his head, which is really strange. Going by what we know, this case is a dead end, but it just doesn’t feel over. Something’s off.” Sam pauses, and the phone speaker blares with the horn of a passing truck. “But this can wait. Bobby filled me in on the Heaven situation– that’s much more important. He’s already hit the books, and I’m gonna drive up there to help him.”
“No, not Heaven.” Dean has the audacity to look impatient. “That’s actually kind of a good thing. Michael took himself out. Now all we have to worry about’s the Devil. We get the demons, if not this demon, to tell us how to cram Lucifer back in hell. Or wherever.”
Before the wounded cop can make sense of that, Dean cuts in. “We have some theories, but it’s too soon to say–”
“We got lanterns,” Dean says uncertainly. “I think I saw them in the store room and I don’t know if they’re electric or what. There’s a couple flashlights and we could find more when we hit a city.”
“I know that,” Dean says irritably. “You drank a beer, tried to get laid, remember that? Good times. Heaven’s closed up shop so you might as well live a little.”
“What do you want me to do? Find a hospital? Call the CDC?” Dean demands acidly. “I’ll get right on it.”
It’s hard for Dean to remind himself to stay guarded because when it really gets going with Castiel, things are so good Dean has to stop and pinch himself to make sure he isn’t dreaming. It’s been three weeks and Dean has already slept over twice.
“No,” Sam says on the tail end of a sigh. “But we’re not giving up. We’re gonna keep looking. There’s gotta be a way.”
Dean’s heart sinks. Oh great. This is horrible. Before he has the chance to explain or understand, Castiel murmurs a thanks and practically flees the store.
“I wanted to see you,” Castiel says simply. Just like that. So sincere and open, like it’s no big deal. The meaning is plain.
This time, Castiel feels the ebb of his grace. He watches Dean frown over the bullet and shake his head.
Once Dean slides the card over, the man doesn’t dawdle. “IHOP’s across the street. Just past the Road Ranger.”
Castiel bites his lip, mulling it over. Dean’s assessment is far more charitable, and far less irrational than Castiel’s internal self-flagellation. Then again, Dean is biased.
“Well, thanks,” he mutters, reaching for the next card, desperate to move on and regain his composure.
“Oh, Cas.” Dean feels the smirk take over his face and gives up without a fight. His voice has rumbled un-self consciously closer to sleep and the space between them feels dreamlike. “That’s not what we mean by little death.”
“Screw the case, Dean. There won’t be cases to work if this whole apocalypse thing goes sideways. I’m saying that you and Cas should meet me and Bobby in Sioux Falls. It’s all hands on deck. Who knows if something like this is even in the lore? It seems stupid to waste time over a case so small when there aren’t even any demons to interrogate.”
When they return, it’s close to midnight. The patrollers on duty are awake, but almost everyone else is asleep. There isn’t the usual fanfare of the camp dwellers clustering around the jeep for news.
It’s after dinner, and they’re settled on Castiel’s couch with the TV on in the background. Dean’s reading a comic book rather distractedly, and Castiel… well, he’s trying to ignore his phone.
Castiel opens his mouth to reply but Charlie bounds into the kitchen and interrupts them. Dean has to fight to defend his mug of coffee, and he’s both relieved and a little disappointed by the intrusion. He looks over and sees Castiel smiling, and can’t help but smile back.
Castiel tries to stop himself, but he feels like he’s come this far, so why not? The wine pools warm and low in his belly, and maybe it plays a part in his nosiness. He asks,
“Keep it running,” Dean barks at Castiel before taking off. Castiel obeys, keeping an eye on the back door of the store through the side mirror. It stays closed. He hears the sounds of Dean jumping into the fray. Thick, muffled grunts punctuated by the sounds of things, maybe even walls, breaking. One single gunshot. Then silence.
“Dean,” Castiel breathes. He doesn’t even care that Charlie is practically glued to the door, watching avidly.
He thinks about leaving her, sometimes. Really thinks about it. He stands in the bathroom after he showers, and stares at his reflection in the fogged up mirror, and practices the lines under his breath.
They both turn to look at him. Dean is desperate. He wants an answer but Castiel doesn’t have one. He finally admits what they’ve all suspected for some time now. As much as he doesn’t want to crush Dean’s hopes, he can’t let Dean entertain the notion that he’s useful any longer.
It’s a little abrupt, but it’s all too much again. Castiel can’t blame Dean for it. He needs to sort himself out. This has ventured past inappropriate and Castiel needs to reign himself in. Sure, it’s just a picture of him over a decade ago, but he wasn’t thinking.
Castiel looks in the face of the dead man. He’s a child. No more than nineteen. It doesn’t warp with the features of a demon. “It’s… gone now. I can’t tell.”
The officer nods. “Well, it appears she was hiding out by the East Lagoon. Students trying to leave the campus reported being attacked, but we just got a call about a body. Matches her description.”
“He doesn’t want you gone. He needs all those who bear the bloodline alive so he can fight Michael.”
“I’m so happy for you two,” Dean says, and he really means it. He loves Jess, and he honestly couldn’t think of anyone better for Sam.
“What are you doing here?” Castiel sounds hoarse, voice cracked and sore. He knows better than to ask. This isn’t, after all, the first time. Dean has been visiting him, slipping quietly into his reach and then slinking out with the shadows before Castiel can get a proper hold of him. Still, Castiel can’t help it. He has to ask. He has to hope. He has to believe that there’s a chance this might be real.
After he wipes the sweat from his face. After he vomits in the bathroom. After he showers and wipes down the fogged up mirror. After everything. They're talking about him in hushed voices. They're afraid. Dean really, really doesn't want to hear it.
Soft as silk, hot as a furnace, Dean’s mouth. In the darkness behind Dean’s teeth is the edge of an abyss, but even as far as he’s already fallen Castiel has a ways to fall yet– yawning eons – before he reaches it.
He wants to go to Castiel, but the convocation is today. Castiel’s finally graduating. It’s his day. Dean’s not gonna go into his bullshit when Castiel should be celebrating.
Away. And they’d be too far apart because Dean can’t afford to haul ass to Chicago. And they’ll only meet on the weekends, but Castiel will get busy, or Dean will fuck up, and they’ll drift apart. And then Castiel will meet someone else there. Someone better.
Castiel stares. As if to prove himself, Dean pulls his phone back out and starts thumbing through it.
Then he pushes Dean onto his back. Castiel pulls his t-shirt off before following to settle on top of Dean. They mold together, Dean’s legs slipping open for him, Dean’s hands coming to rest on his ass, pulling him closer. Castiel cups Dean’s chin, pressing him back, and kisses him deeply, enjoying this play at control. Everywhere that their skin touches is warm and sensuous. Castiel feels at once alive and completely soothed.
After about thirty minutes, he groans. “Can you at least pretend to breathe or fidget a little or something? It’s gettin’ a little creepy with you playing a statue in the corner.”
Castiel isn’t sure how this relates to his situation, but he decides he ought to be supportive anyway. She’s always been supportive and generous to him. Maybe this reminds her of something that went wrong for her.
Dean nods, hoping his relief is not too evident. He parks in the driveway of the townhouse he shares with Sam and Kevin and Charlie. He's trying to think of a way to explain Castiel to them when the door flies open and Sam steps out.
He feels sick for lying to her. He hates himself for not having the stones to do the right thing. The problem is, he's not sure that this… thing with Dean is even real. But even if it wasn't, he knows things are not working with Daphne. On the other hand, if it were simply about the uncertainty (and not something he actively wanted), he’d come right out and tell her. At worst, she wouldn’t think it was funny. Basically, there's no excuse to not come clean, except the obvious.
(“You’re tie’s on backwards,” Dean points out one afternoon, licking his lips and looking away. He’s tempted to reach across the counter and fix it.
Dizzy and overwhelmed, Castiel latches onto the first movement that catches his sight. Two men. Walking. In a direction. Towards the storeroom.
Gorgeous blue eyes meet his, and Dean can’t help but notice that they’re bloodshot and rimmed red. The expression on the man’s face is weary and exhausted, and Dean makes out the distinct tracks of dried tears over sharp cheekbones before an overgrown stubble takes over his fine jaw. Concern pricks at Dean, but he bites his tongue. It’s not his place. He’s just a regular retail robot.
Dean doesn’t respond. He thumbs through the book in front of Castiel. He frowns. “What is this? This language?”
Because he pined after Cas for almost a year and a half, but here in the real world, it’s only been three weeks. And three weeks is nothing to someone like Castiel, who has prospects and a future. Dean is determined to make this relationship count, but he isn’t gonna hold Castiel back. As much as it hurts now, he knows in the long run he’ll be content to just be a nice, sweet memory.
“Okay, moving on.” Dean drums his fingers on the table, and huffs incredulously when he reads the next card before tossing it aside. “What’s something you’d want to change about me? There’s probably a list for this right on the fridge next to the grocery list and the cleaning schedule.”
Dean’s laugh is not much more than a huff, but he looks up at Castiel, amused smile firmly in place. “Yeah,” he says, thumb stroking over the inked skin. “I like it.” This tortured, abused flesh that Castiel now resides in, releases pain, siphoned off by every warm point of contact to Dean’s skin.
“How come you’re here, Dean? You should be spending Thanksgiving with your family, not working.” Castiel pauses, leaning against the counter between them. “I realize that might be a little insensitive. My apologies.” He burps softly. “You’re welcome to spend it with me if you want. I’d appreciate the company.”
“I have grown rather fond of coffee,” Castiel says, even though neither Risa, nor Dean, is looking at him. They’re looking at each other. Castiel gets the feeling that this conversation isn’t actually about him and he’s not really invited to join it. He can’t quite fathom how or why yet, but he knows enough to sense it.
“Sorry.” Jane has the wherewithal to look ashamed. "I gotta get back to the store room. Chuck’s gonna say a few words for Joe and Carl.”
Castiel kisses Dean’s chin, and neck, and nips at the tattooed skin above his heart, and laves at Dean’s left nipple before trailing lower with heated kisses. It’s true, Castiel loves Dean for his kind heart, and sharp mind, and gentle soul, and every rough edge and vulnerability of his personality, but sometimes he looks down and realizes with a numb sort of stupidity that Dean’s body is beautiful. And he loves Dean’s body. A lot. It’s kind of wonderful to be in love like this.
It takes Dean another hour or so to show up. By then Castiel is riding the blissful, floating edge of a haze. His heart drones a steady beat in his chest, but he also feels the throb of bloodflow in his fingertips and ears. He could get lost in the drumming. It’s magnificent.
Castiel asks the question with some trepidation. Dean’s humor is sometimes self-deprecating, but Castiel sees that it is a thin veneer for Dean’s insecurities. It’s in the way Dean talks about himself and even though they haven’t known each other long, Castiel is ready to defend Dean if he insists he’s not nice. Because Castiel knows people who aren’t nice. And Dean is nothing like them. Which is why Dean’s response comes as a surprise.
Castiel squawks as Charlie snatches the phone right out of his hands. It’s his fault for not deleting the damn picture, and he certainly shouldn’t have been looking at it at work. Even if it was his lunch break and he was sitting in the cafeteria. Maybe especially then.
And then Castiel had touched him, to soothe, to heal, to prove– and of all things, Dean’s soul reacted like a star going supernova, bursting outward from the blackened husk that concealed it, responding with a touch of its own: tenterhooks that sank into Castiel’s grace and held fast. The blast fused Castiel’s touch on Dean as well, a mark Castiel left when he remade Dean’s flesh.
Castiel focuses on the massage because he doesn’t trust himself to speak. This is something he’s struggled with in the back of his mind since he ended things with Daphne. It’s come to the forefront ever since he saw the email. Most days he doesn’t really think about it, because, well. He’s happy. Content. And busy enough that he doesn’t spend too long brooding about it.
Bobby sighs, shaking his head. Dean is silent for a long moment. Frustration washes over his features, then anger. For a brief moment… guilt? Maybe pity? But he says nothing and storms back upstairs.
The first thing Castiel notices upon waking is that the room feels uncomfortably hot. It also smells incredibly appealing. The third thing he realizes is that it’s Dean. Dean smells appealing. Castiel glances over to where Dean is lying stiffly on his side, arms crossed, frowning in his sleep. Dean's scent makes Castiel think of the texture of Dean’s skin. The rough warmth of his palm. When Castiel swallows, his throat feels dry. He blinks, trying to clear his mind, but it’s too late. The world has taken on the shimmer of a fever dream. Everything oozes in and out of focus in tandem with his breathing. His attention wanders and refocuses on Dean. He spreads his legs, brings his feet up to lie flat on the bed, knees spread and pointing to the ceiling. Imagination skidding in overheated overdrive, his body reacts, begging and keening for stimulation that never comes.
“You just surprised me, Cas,” he says. And it’s true. The rest of it, that can come up later. Or maybe never. He watches the tension leave Castiel’s shoulders and smiles.
That would be ideal. Then it’s not premeditated. It’s not an active decision or choice made by him. He’s a passive pawn in the machinations of the universe. He's not a liar. Or a cheater. A coward.
Maybe because he’s already touching Cas’ hands and fantasizing like such a girl, Dean has to clamp down the unreasonable, shuddering urge to press a palm to Cas’ sternum. He wants to turn the reassuring rise and fall of Cas’ inhales and exhales, punctuated by the drum of his heart, into a sense memory. This reality, Cas being human, is straight out of fantasies Dean never even allowed himself to have. Though he’s trying to be clinical about it, it’s an intimate moment and he cares for Cas. He’s helping heal him now. And sure, it’s nowhere as quick as their favored brand of angel mojo. And it’s not shelter, but it’s help all the same.
Risa looks at Castiel abruptly. With a grateful smile, she reaches out for his hands and he steps closer to let her hold them. “Thanks for checking on me, Castiel.”
Then why does it leave him winded? Why is his heart pounding? What is the sick, acerbic taste at the back of his tongue?
“For the hundredth time, I’m in a rut and I want some fucking privacy. I’m headed to a motel to take care of myself, not spread my legs for an archangel like some heat-hungry omega whore–“
Sam growls and a burnt smell fills the room. His eyes are wild, and he’s all but foaming at the mouth in rage. He’s nothing like himself. Castiel sees the darkness in Sam take hold of the reigns and recoils from it.
“I can’t disagree,” Castiel replies. There’s a drawer in the nightstand by his bed. He pulls it out and finds an untouched Bible. There’s a joke about the apocalypse there somewhere, but Castiel isn’t sure of the punchline or how to deliver it so he slides the drawer back in place.
Castiel starts to hum but stops himself. Then he catches himself trying to buck up into Dean’s hand. “This isn’t,” he says, stilted and halting. “It isn’t how we are.”
Dean shrugs, turning onto the road that leads them back to the motel. “Seemed like a good idea at the time.”
The TV spits white noise at them. From where he’s collapsed against the headboard, Dean says, “This was a huge waste of time and money.”
Castiel hangs up and wings over. He lands a little unsteadily. Dean looks frazzled and exhausted, but he sits up in bed, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
At that, Dean’s throat unsticks. Guilt wells up within him. Sheriff Mills has been offering him a job for over a year now and he’s rebuffed her. And in spite of that, she vouched for him. She fought for him. She deserves an explanation.
“I understand,” Daphne smiles sweetly without a shred of doubt. “By the way, I made ginger snaps. Maybe you can take some for the office.”
“Is this done?” he asks, trying to get up. “I’m leaving. You’ve gotta have other friends that can do this, Sam. I already pay your bills. Don’t make me do your homework.”
Bones splinter, blood sprays across his vision. What makes an angel? Not this weak puppet with cut strings in his hands, a doll shattering, ball from socket, glass eyes wet with unshed tears. Surely not. It's brutal, and the Mark scorches a vicious bolt of pleasure up Dean's arm. He grips the tie, the silken rope sliding into his blood-gritty grip.
As the days slip by, Castiel feels a distinct shift in the tone of Dean’s texts. There’s more pictures, for one. Dean constantly takes pictures of himself or the food he’s eating or anything he finds amusing. Or anything he thinks Castiel might find interesting.
Anyway! Thanks for reading along. Writing this has been such a fun ride, and please accept my undying love for comments <3
The deep, gravely voice sends a frisson through Dean, and it makes him pause and look up. The man in front of him is perusing the cover of one of the lurid magazines on the stand with a determined look, but Dean– well, Dean’s a little stunned. He loses his train of thought because he’s looking at an arrestingly handsome man he’s never seen before. There's something forlorn about him.
It’s a cop. His face is ashen, and one sleeve is drenched in blood. He favors that side and knocks with his free hand, leaving flecks of blood on the window.
So it turns out Castiel is a total lightweight. Two beers in and he turns into a smiley, flirty lush. It’s kind of seriously adorable.
“You still feel guilty about the whole thing,” Dean says. It’s not a question. His smile turns wry and knowing.
By the time he gets the coffee machine going, Castiel wakes up. Regrettably, Castiel’s dressed in jeans. He still looks half-asleep, though.
Bobby fixes him with a beady stare for a moment, but eventually he sighs. “Not for a few days. Knowing the Winchester temper tantrums, it’ll take a while before they figure out how to forgive each other. Takes a stupidly long time, but they always get there in the end.”
It’s kind of awesome to see the hope and happiness dawn on Castiel’s face. “Really? You swear? I mean it, Dean. Don’t keep something that's bothering you about us, or me, from me. Please.”
“Cas, let go,” Dean says, voice tight and quiet. “Get in the jeep or back in your cabin. You can’t stop me.”
There isn’t much to see. His office is sparse. He doesn’t care much for hanging up accolades or personalizing with pictures. He likes to keep his personal life separate from work. The less Zachariah knew about him, the better. The only thing in here that really belongs to him are the electric tea kettle and the expansive collection of different teas. He likes to brew some when he’s stressed or strung out. It helps him focus and decompress. Dean turns his nose up at it, but Castiel already knew that. Dean prefers coffee. He calls tea ‘soggy leaf water.’
Castiel waits in the car as Dean refuels at the gas station. By the time they pull into the parking lot of the IHOP, he feels impatient. It feels like Dean’s moving at a glacial pace on purpose. He bites his tongue when they walk in and Dean flirts with the waitress. An omega. The kind of girl Dean normally manages to charm successfully. She seats them at a booth and Dean orders an inordinate amount of food.
Charlie grins. “I keep telling you, man. I got ninja skills. I'm gonna pull off a heist one of these days.” She made a show of glancing around as though the walls had ears. “Or am I?”
