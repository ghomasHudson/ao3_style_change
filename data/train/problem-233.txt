It was no longer a warm breeze, but a scorching sun that blazed down and burnt his skin.
I bite down on the back of my hand to silence myself, and cross my legs as a wave of pleasure goes through me.
(Who liked the friends reference in the title?)
"Oi!"
“Fuck, I’m so hard for you... god I want you so bad.”
I’m cumming, I’m cumming, I’m cumming and it’s so hot.
“Of course.”
I’ve never seen him look peaceful.
In his place, lies a harlot, begging that I fuck him harder.
“I trust you.”
“Basically, we stand here and tell them they can’t take food out of here, and to keep the noise down. It’s normally quite calm.”
John. Where’s John?
Johns eyes flew wide when he realised what she was getting at, but before he could comment she’d grabbed his hand and was pulling him down the street while he desperately tried to hide his arousal with his coat.
He’s warm and hard, pulsing and throbbing in my hand.
“Wipe that pout of your face. You and Rosie have boyfriends, you can just grind with them. Molly and I have hunting to do.”
John was regarding her affectionately, a soft, loving smile playing on his lips.
“You could say that.”
“That’s not it. I am ready... I’m just... scared.”
Sherlock age: 15
Hi guys, hope you enjoy. BDSM attempt here. SAFE, SANE, CONSESUAL.
Sherlock was sure he was so red now he’d put a tomato to shame.
“I hear from Harry that she and John are to be returning today.” She pointed, eyeing Sherlock over her tea cup.
“Yeah?”
I press my lips against his jaw, and murmur quietly as a deep rumble.
“And what about you?” The pale girl asked, trying to take off her gloves of with her teeth.
Her mother turned her head to look at her youngest daughter.
What if it was really awkward?
“Molly, wait! Oh, shit.” Rosie groaned.
Sherlock wasn’t looking when John looked up to him again.
“This ok?” John asked through gritted teeth, holding back a moan at the new feeling surrounding his cock.
I feel his cock spasming in my hand, followed by a wet, sticky fluid gushing in to my palm.
Sherlock was sat on the bed, actually tied to the bed, staring up at John with pained eyes and parted lips.
"I'm not a psychopath." He said calmly, slowly getting to his feet.
“Yes.” Sherlock beamed.
“Nah uh. You’re not going to sleep yet. Come on.”
Two can play at seduction.
Five little words sent Sherlock’s world upside down... again.
“Are you sure your parents don’t mind me staying here?”
I can’t help but get drawn in to a kiss as Sherlock’s clever fingers work their way in to my shirt.
“What was all the racket?”
“Indeed.” John grinned at Sherlock in the candlelight, his eyes soft, warmer than they’d been in a long time.
“I love fucking your pretty little mouth!” John rumbled, his eyes screwed shut.
“You could say that.”
“Hey.” Sherlock frowned.
“You Alright?” John asked genuinely while the three girls were distracted picking cocktails.
“You have to Sherlock!”
He manages to maintain eye contact with me for all of ten seconds before going all blushy and giggly again.
“Mycroft’s got a girl in his room.”
“So you don’t chew your arm off.”
“I don’t know. You pick, it’s your house.” Sherlock said, quoting John.
“Good boy.”
Molly shrugged.
“This is nice.” Sherlock mumbled against johns lips.
Sherlock knew that wasn’t all they were to each other, so it didn’t matter what the rest of the world knew. She knew, and John new.
“I do want to. I really do. I’m...” Sherlock looked down. “I’m worried I’ll be a disappointment.”
“Actually, no. How did it happen?”
He crawls closer to me and presses his lips back to mine.
Johns mouth felt better than his hand, far better.
“Ready.”
This was new, and exciting, and so very, very hot. Sherlock felt intoxicated as he lay there, his head cloudy, his very being on fire. John continued to squirt whipped cream on to Sherlock’s body, then licking it off as he went. Sherlock’s whole body seized up when johns tongue made contact with his nipple.
“What do you think of this?”
“Maybe I could stab you with it?”
You don’t think about it when you actually kiss someone, because all you can think about is how wonderful the other person’s lips feel on yours.
He threw his head back into the wall when John mouthed at his neck, kissing, biting and sucking at his pulse point.
Mycroft was alarmed at this, not accustomed to Sherlock showing emotion. Despite being a rather sensitive child, this was still a surprising sight. Although neither he or Sherlock had a grasp on their own emotions, he had a better understanding of others’. The curly haired boy’s shoulders were shaking as he wept, drenching the front of his brother’s shirt. Mycroft slowly put his arms around him, and held him close to his chest.
He moved his mouth up and down thrice more before Sherlock was coming with a loud sob and a cry of his name.
Sherlock crawled to johns side of the bed, and knelt down before him. John leant in by his ear.
“Children! Supper!” Mrs Hudson called from the kitchen.
He pulls back, and his gaze drifts down a little further to linger on my artificially glistening hole.
“Oh, right. John Watson.”
His rock hard, dripping, not to mention generously sized cock is supposed to fit inside me.
“John...” I murmur breathlessly as I ball the stiff cotton of his shirt in to my fists.
“Oh...” Sherlock moaned as John wrapped a hand around his cock.
“I’d like to.”
“You might be able to tell what you need to about everyone with just a look, but you miss out on so much when you do that, stories, emotions...”
The officer's voice was stern this time, something Sherlock either didn't pick up on, or was deliberately ignoring as he opened his mouth to continue proving his mouth.
“Is she ok?”
I nod my head, a grin tugging at my lips.
Sherlock did as he was told, and closed his eyes as the tune continued.
John was leant against the door way, a smirk on his face.
“I thought you could wear this.”
Rosie turned her head so her cheek was pressed to the floor as Irene came in. She was dressed, hair brushed, fresh make up on her face. Rosie on the other hand had hair like a rats nest, and last nights makeup ringed round her eyes like a raccoon.
Oh the settings gone up- oh god- oh-oh-oh!
“What? What’s wrong?”
“Ok, my turn to ask. How old are you?”
Sherlock has a dirty dream about John.
“Oh fuck...”
I can’t help but grin to myself as I saunter through the corridors, Sherlock’s underwear clutched in my pocket.
Sherlock walked down the hall, and knocked on Mycroft’s door. The older teenager opened the door, an irritated expression on his face.
“Finally over.” She sighed as she pressed a kiss to the corner of his mouth.
The reality of being back home starts to hit John.
“I’ll only be a minute.”
Irene chuckles and shakes her head.
He shakes his head.
“You’re not a stranger... you’re his dad.”
John turned around to look at a photograph of flowers in Todd’s hand.
John falters, his brows knitting together, a look of confusion washing across his face.
“I remember when you sent me some jam last summer.”
He moves his fingers over the shelf, and reaches for the hand I didn’t know I’d put before him.
“When we’re sitting in class... I’ll know you’re covered in hickeys, because of the things I did to you... I know you’ll think about this moment... every time you look in the mirror... And that really turns me on.” He mumbled between kisses.
“And you?”
“Oh fuck...”
“John’s over the moon. One of the officers gave him a cigar to celebrate with.” She announced as she walked towards her mother.
Sherlock smiled flirtatiously, his eyes searching John’s.
“You guys have a weird relationship.”
“Well, then, you’d best be off my darling.”
“God, Sherlock... mmmnnggh!” He groaned.
I feel him smile briefly before drawing one of my nipples in to his mouth.
He could feel death right behind him this time, the barrel of the gun pressed against his skull.
Thank you very much for the gift. Your mother brought it over this morning. I love it. I shall never take it off. Sorry to hear about your bunk mate. Although I don’t have to worry about snoring, Mycroft’s new baby wakes me up in the middle of the night with her crying. We’re off to the post office now to have her photos done. I’ll send you one with my next letter. Wishing you the best.
Sherlock did the clasps up with ease after that.
“I didn’t murder anyone.”
Mrs Watson smiled, then left with the housekeeper.
I can’t help but falter for a moment before pulling my shirt over my head by the hem, keeping the sleeves over my arms.
“Young lady? Are you to be travelling with the party?” A blonde woman in a skirt suit asked. She was surrounded by a group of girls and an assortment of parents, friends and siblings.
I am fully aware that now is not the time, but there is something very, very hot about this...
“Aren’t you going to get dressed, John?”
I don’t know what twisted issues I have swimming about in my head, but that has my arousal spiking, and my cock throbbing.
“What? Why?” The blonde asked, his brows furrowed.
“I love you so much.” Sherlock babbled, toying with a lock of Johns ashy blond hair.
“Look at you... my little sex kitten...” John husked as he knelt up to face Sherlock.
Normally, I do this as a necessary release, but there is defiantly something different about doing it for pleasure.
“Hey, give me the bottle. Hogger.” She hissed as she made a grab for it.
“This is my favourite.” Sherlock said with a grin.
When she got to his house, no one answered the door. She knocked again, but to no avail.
When I’m a few inches away from him, he spins around, and hits my in the shoulder with the end of the rake.
I scuttle back as far as I can so my back is pressed up against the wall, mindful not to bash my head on the desk.
“Oh, that would be lovely.” Mrs Watson said, a smile tugging at her lips. “Speaking of tea, I must invite you in for some. I’ll have Lillie put the kettle on.”
The pair cautiously crept down the stairs, terrified someone had heard them. Thankfully, Mrs Holmes and Mycroft had the television on rather loud, and were sucked right in.
“Have you heard from John?”
“No.”
"In your pyjamas?"
“John’s still having his night terrors.” She stated as she ran her eyes over her younger sister.
“Yes. I actually prefer to use it in place of my first name. William is so mundane... as is Scott...”
Despite what he was hearing, Sherlock still managed a laugh when John pretended to throw up.
In my hand, is the pair of underwear Sherlock was wearing last night.
“John’s going home with a lot more than just a pat on the back.”
“Sherlock these are metal, they’re gonna-“
“Me too.”
As soon as he saw it, Sherlock recognised the shop.
“Oh Jesus!” She cried out when he placed his mouth round one of her nipples. “John!”
“I’m already naked.” He sighs against my ear, nuzzling me with his nose.
Sherlock trembled when John pulled his skirt up, revealing his bare ass. The smack on his exposed skin had him cry out, his hips jolting forwards. There was an angry red mark already forming on Sherlock’s formally creamy skin. John was using all his self control not to lean down and bite Sherlock on the ass, as pleasurable as that would be.
“I’m in charge here, not you.”
John’s voice was deep, and strained, and it had Sherlock soaking his boxers.
“Not the time!” She snapped, silencing Sherlock.
John’s head whipped up, his eyes landing on the tall, wiry figure leaning against the doorframe.
“We just had sex.”
Sherlock and John go crime solving.
“Oh, Sherlock.”
“Do you have any idea how much I love you?”
“Mmnngghh...” John groans deep in his throat as he pushes in to the hilt.
I follow a moment later.
John chortled, and shook his head.
“Get in with me?” Sherlock finally said after he’d caught his breath.
Sherlock wasn’t new to being hungover, but this was definitely worse than before. Perhaps that was due to the drinking game she and John had started.
“Bad leg. Can’t walk up the stairs.” He shrugged meekly.
“It’s ok.”
John had already dozed off, and was sleeping soundly on the other sofa. She knew it wouldn’t last. It would only be a few hours till he was up again. She tried not to think about it as she settled down, and waited for sleep.
“I really have to go this time.”
Sherlock moaned softly, and bit his lip.
-love Sherlock xx
He was going to see Rosie. He wanted to see her. He was going to leave Sherlock, and he was going to spend time with her. Sherlock walked back home from school, tears beginning to fall from his eyes. By the time he got to the front door, iridescent beads were streaming down his face. He fumbled around for his keys, then tumbled through into the hallway.
She spun around to face him. He looked different somehow, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.
“Thanks mum.”
Of course these screams did end up waking the baby.
“How was school, dear?” Mrs Watson asked.
“Let’s try this again.” John ginned against Sherlock’s lips as he lay him down on the bed. He positioned himself between Sherlock’s legs, his hands either side of his dark head, his muscled arms trapping the slighter teen. He kissed Sherlock’s lips hard enough to bruise them, nipping at them with his teeth, running his tongue along their smooth surface. John moved his head down to Sherlock’s alabaster neck, and began sucking there, leaving dark love bites.
I have a new plot. Sorry this took so long, I kinda ran in to a wall plot wise. Enjoy! Oh, and please comment ideas if you have any, those walls are very frequently ran in to 😆
His eyes are wide with alarm, his cheeks flushed bright pink.
“Mmm, John...”
Sherlock smiled, and nodded his head. John gave him one more kiss before jumping off the bed to rummage through Sherlock’s draws. He climbed back on to the bed with the bottle, then beckoned Sherlock to move closer to him.
“I’ll try though.”
I mean of course I would do that, but then I would have to worry about favouritism... wait, why is she doing it?
“What I want isn’t in the kitchen.” She glowered as she pulled a pillow close to her chest.
He’s bright pink by the time he’s finished talking.
Sherlock obeyed, and draped himself over johns knee, ass in the air, feet just scraping the floor.
Sherlock was pressed up against the window, small patches of condensation forming where she was breathing.
Sorry this is short
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock!” John howled as he felt his orgasm rip through him.
“Nnngghh! Ahh! Oh!” Sherlock yelped, thumping one of his fists on the door as Johns tip brushed his prostate.
“Oh fuck- ah!”
“Good point. Let’s just hope that I’m not here long enough for my child to be able to write me letters.”
“Tea please.”
“A good friend.” John answered for her. “Her mother asked me to accompany her.”
“Wow.”
“Miss Watson has come to see you. She’s in the parlour.”
Well, I can’t say no to that.
“You don’t have turtles.”
John couldn’t hold off any longer.
John grabbed at Sherlock’s ass, spreading him open.
“I’m gonna take a shower.” Sherlock mused, running his now free hands down johns chest. He climbed off the bed, and took a long stretch. John rolled over in the purple cotton sheets to sneak a look at Sherlock in all his glory. His long, lean, and lightly toned body was glistening with sweat, adorned with fresh love bites, and a proper bite mark on his shoulder. He bent over to stretch, tensing all the muscles in his back and ass. John shook his head at the tease that was his boyfriend. He crawled across the bed, and placed his hands on Sherlock’s waist. He added to Sherlock’s collection of marks by biting softly at the smooth skin of Sherlock’s ass.
‘Walk through the fire with you,
“Oh god...”
“Oh my god, oh my god. My Sherlock, my god... I...” his words broke apart as he sobbed in to her hair.
“I’ll be ready.”
“I was just wondering if either of you wanted anything to eat?”
“I asked you a fucking question!”
“Although to be honest, I’m kind of afraid to do anything now. Seeing Mycroft may have made my dick invert.”
“You’ve got a boy.”
Sherlock’s POV
It would be so easy to let myself believe he’s actually changed his mind, but...
“Ahem. I... mmm.”
There’s people flying about, running around.
I swipe my tongue across his dripping slit, causing him to howl.
“Just shhh.” John quipped. “And listen.”
"John? What happened?"
“Reddish hair, green eyes.”
“Yes.” Sherlock chuckled. “I feel great actually.”
John had been holding his fists so tightly his knuckles had gone white.
The imagery of Sherlock in between my legs, on his knees, his pretty little mouth round my cock... that coupled with the knowledge that he got himself off last night to the fantasy of my words.
She’d stayed awake most of the night before, anxious to see John again. She hadn’t seen him since he was 17. He was nearly 21 now. She hadn’t felt like celebrating her own birthday, and the day had just passed by like any other. She’d been too worried about John to do anything about it. She didn’t need to be worried now. He was coming home. She didn’t need to worry. He’d be ok now, wouldn’t he?
“No.” He winced when he sat up, his arm moving up to tentatively touch his shoulder.
She turned her head when her bedroom door was flung open.
“What did you say?”
He shook his head, and inhaled sharply.
He’s kissing me with raw, lust fulled passion, and I find myself responding ever so readily.
John lifted his head and smiled.
“Am I doing it right?” I ask against his lips.
“Yes, Yes I’m fine.”
They’d never kissed like this before, sober anyway.
“Sweetie, darling.”
Most of the mess is on him, primarily his hands.
“John...?” She asked, concern in her voice.
“For him... no. Let me guess, he tried to bribe you?” Sherlock muttered, running his hands through his ebony locks.
“Mmmmm...” Sherlock hummed, lifting his hips so John could pull his underwear down, shivering as the cotton garments were dragged against his skin.
"You're brilliant, you know that, right?"
“Horny.” Sherlock replied matter of factually, making John snicker. “I’m so wet for you right now.”
John grabbed Sherlock’s arm, and steered him across the field.
“Why...?”
He gripped his leaking cock, and slid the condom down the length, moaning from the contact, already so on edge. He quickly glanced up to Sherlock, who nodded for him to continue. He didn’t hesitate before pushing in to Sherlock’s hole.
Yes, I stole that line in the fight scene from TAB, and the end from OITNB.
I won’t be able to get all of it in my mouth.
He pressed a chaste kiss on Sherlock’s moist lips, and walked into the hall.
“My hero.” Sherlock giggled, and pressed a kiss to johns cheek.
He grasped his leaking cock, and positioned himself at the apex of her legs.
“Johnathan!”
John wondered for a moment if he would be able to find Sherlock’s prostate. That would probably get him off.
“The science of deduction. That’s what it’s about, and it’s title. Just in case you were interested.”
“No, no. Don’t stop. It only hurts a bit. It’ll be ok.”
“It’s fine.”
Fuck he’s distracting.
They wouldn’t get married before the baby was born...
Currently, my legs are between his, one of my hands is lost in his dark tresses, and my other hand is joined with his, resting on his hip, our fingers are laced.
“Oh yeah. See that redhead over there?” She asked, pointing to a girl sipping on a Cosmo at the bar.
“Fine.” The brunette responded curtly, too busy looking around to see if the blonde girl had tagged along. He caught sight of her talking to Molly a few yards away. She waved, but didn’t come over.
“I started playing the violin.”
I watch the blue eyed boy as he moves around his cube, reading, pacing. He paces a lot. A few times, I think I feel him watching me in the bubble, but I never catch him looking. I get moved to the warehouse in my last hour, so I don’t see him for the rest of the day. That doesn’t mean I don’t think about him though. It occurs to me at some point during the second half of the rugby match that I don’t even know his name. That’s my mission for tomorrow.
“Oh, shhh... shhhh... it’s ok...” She sobbed, rocking the baby in an attempt to sooth her. “Please don’t cry.”
“Fine.” Sherlock sighed. “She seems like a nice girl, I won’t tell Mum and dad she was here, there’s left over stir fry for you in the fridge, please don’t have intercourse while I’m still in the house. Afternoon.” Sherlock quipped.
“Now there’s a sexy sight.”
Sherlock involuntarily bucked his hips up, a strangled whine escaping his lips.
“Oh he does not look like a potato!”
“My brother?” John asked, confused, and slightly annoyed.
John’s POV
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at John in mock annoyance.
Fuck, I’m getting hard.
“Your semen is coming back out.” He stated matter of factually.
Sherlock sat up, and pressed his lips to johns ear.
“Bought you a little something.”
Sherlock turned her head to face her mother.
“Hello, molly.”
“Now I want you to know I’m not doing this to do the right thing... I’m doing it because I don’t want to waste another minute of my life without you. I know we’ll have to wait till I get back, but this is a start...”
“Catch you later. Holmes.”
He looks so small and frightened right now.
“I’m moving back in here for now. At a time like this, we all aught to be together, don’t you think?” She asked somewhat rhetorically.
John shuffled forwards then, and dropped his head on to Sherlock’s shoulder. She nuzzled him affectionately, and wrapped her arms around him. John pulled back after a moment, but only to pull Sherlock on to the sofa with him.
“He’s lucky I love him. It’s so fucking cold.”
It was fast, and hot, desperate and passionate. Sherlock couldn’t even begin to fathom the ungodly noises that were coming out of his mouth now as John fucked him. John was thrusting his hips with abandon, hitting Sherlock’s prostate again and again.
I want to be able to hold him, kiss him, sooth him, comfort him, bask in the afterglow, be with him for as long as he needs, as long as we both need.
He quickly gathered his things, and went to leave the class.
“I’m really sticky.” He complained, chuckling a little as he swiped his finger over his still sensitive nipple.
“John, I think that would be best.” Sherlock interjected before John could open his mouth, then gently placed his hands on his shoulders, and ushered the broad teen out of the room.
Mycroft worried her lip between her teeth. It was what they had all suspected, and hearing the doctor say it only confirmed it. Footsteps running up at the stairs drew Mycroft’s attention. Mrs Holmes and Mrs Watson practically fell through the door. The sudden outburst made Sherlock jump, her eyes falling on the pair.
“Don’t need breakfast.” Sherlock mumbled as he popped a single blueberry into his mouth.
“He’s dead.”
John returned to the living room with coffee for both of them, and sat down next to Sherlock who curled up against his shoulder. Johns phone buzzed on the table, Molly’s ID appearing on the screen.
“What sort of music do you like?”
“I mean it. You made me feel so good.”
I can’t believe that person is someone as amazing as John.
Sherlock chortled, and playfully thumped John on the chest.
“I’m wearing panties with attached garters by the way. Just in case you’re interested.”
He flashes me a wink then retreats across the room and out in to the corridor.
“Oh fuck!” Sherlock cried out, his eyes screwing shut.
Sherlock stood up abruptly, realising now was probably the time for niceties, and small talk. Ugh.
“John, I need you so bad.” He groaned seductively, lifting his hips up, and grinding them against john’s pelvis.
“Yeah.” Sherlock moaned, voice slightly strained.
“Agh! Irene, is this tequila?” John grimaced at the taste, sticking out is tongue.
“Mmmm.”
I shuffle my hips a little to try and accommodate him better. It helps a bit, and helps to reduce the twinge in my back.
John got up to grab the landline phone, then called up the Chinese take out place on the corner.
He quirks his brows.
“Ok.” Sherlock beamed, and went to climb off John.
“It’s no problem. Just try not get in to any brawls on the way back to your cube.”
“Mmmm?”
John couldn’t believe what he was seeing as Sherlock started to slowly slide down his body,
“You’re so beautiful. So clever. So talented. So strong.” John murmured between kisses. “And I love you more than anything.”
“Sore.” Sherlock said honestly.
“You should telephone John.”
“Ah!” Sherlock yipped as John snapped the elastic against his skin.
“Ok.” Was all she could answer.
As Sherlock carried all of his height in his legs, the fact that he was a few inches taller than John was one that was completely lost with them lying down.
“I’m fine.”
The teen rolled his eyes, and swivelled round in his chair so he was laying on his back, his long, skinny legs spilling over the arm of the chair.
This may have seemed a bit fast, but I’m pretty sure Sherlock in the show has been in love with John since day 1.
He smirks, confirming my assumptions that no, no it won’t stop them.
“I’d offer my services, but I think you’ve been serviced enough today.”
“Sherlock, darling. Johns here to see you.”
Oh fuck.
His mouth gapes as I stand up again, dragging my fingers up his pale, creamy thighs.
“Mnnngghh... fuck- oh god!”
“I might be. What are you going to about it?”
He opened the letter with his pocket knife.
“Yeah, that’s the right word.”
“Hi.”
“Is this your house?” John asked, wandering around the room.
He’s only about a centimetre away from me, his deep blue eyes staring in to mine.
“My sister is an alcoholic.” He says after a long pause.
I tilt his chin up to force him to look at me.
“Small marks... some discolouration. Not too worried, but I do need to carry out an internal examination.”
“To put myself through medical school.”
I keep my gaze fixed on John, who seems to be understanding what it is I’m getting at.
“He looks like his father.” Mrs Holmes commented as she stroked the baby under the chin.
“I reckon we’ve got about 15 minutes before the girls come back.”
John’s lips pulled into a smirk as he looked at Sherlock. His cheeks were flushed, his mouth was parted, and his eyes were wide as he vied against the handcuffs. John felt his cock ache at the sight before him. He loved seeing Sherlock like this. Desperate.
Obviously, there are other things playing on my mind, but this just isn’t helping.
I spot him raking the grass a few yards away, his back turned.
Sherlock let out a somewhat desperate whimper and threw his head back. When John pulled Sherlock’s trousers and underwear down, he was rock hard and weeping. John felt a bolt of arousal go through him as he allowed his eyes to run over Sherlock. The younger boy had his eyes shut, teeth clenched, his chest rising rapidly and his cock throbbing between his legs.
Sherlock followed her finger as she pointed over to the blond who was currently running to the other side of the pitch, and scoring the winning touchdown.
This is exhilarating. Hearing him moan, feeling him throb, knowing I’m making him feel good.
Sherlock stretched his arms above his head as he yawned.
“Alright... I’ll see you... at six.” John said between kisses.
How would he tell him? How would he confess his love? John shook his head as he walked side by side with the younger boy on the way back. He knew he’d end up saying something stupid, he knew he would. He wouldn’t say anything for now. He’d keep his mouth shut, and come up with a solid plan.
“Some things I think you’ll like.” Sherlock said quietly, batting his eyelashes.
She opened the door to the living room,
“The boyfriend who put Saran Wrap on the toilet last year.”
“Ok. Great.” He chuckled.
They both whipped their heads around to see a group of boys.
“Oh.” Was all she said.
“Does that sound like a good idea to you?” John cooed with a gentle squeeze of Sherlock’s erection.
“Why are you so interested in him anyway?”
“I’m not dreaming, am I?” He asked groggily, his eyes going to the shoulder he’d been using as a pillow.
Fuck, my legs are jelly. My hips hurt. My back hurts too. So does my rim...
“Better. Do it again.”
“Oh, Sherlock! Agh!” John grunted, reaching forwards to grip on the head board.
“Why do you care? I contradict you all the time, I make you look like a complete idiot in front of everyone else, and I’m just a...”
“It’s his sister, Erin.”
Sherlock suspected John was playing along with the soul purpose of being difficult. He stomped out of the room, and down the hall. John turned to Mrs Holmes, and revealed why he effectively threw Sherlock out of the room.
“Thank you.”
Storage cupboard.
He moaned softly when he felt Sherlock dip his head, and begin mouthing and kissing at his neck.
John felt a smile tugging at his lips as he thought of Sherlock.
I allow excitement to win out, and offer John an enthusiastic nod.
4. Sherlock being non binary instead of just cross dressing.
Sherlock yawned deeply as he stretched his arms up above his head.
Moly turns to me.
“Be quick in there. No funny business.” He teased.
Sherlock gives John a ‘helping hand’.
“You look lovely.”
“Come on then.”
“Rose, why are you on the floor?” Greg asked as he made his way over to the group.
“What are you up to?”
John pressed their lips together in a sloppy kiss.
Sherlock made a noise of salacious bliss at this, pulling back from the kiss to gasp aloud.
“Ummm... can’t say I have. Why...?”
I can feel myself getting close much sooner than I’d normally like, but when you’re fucking a cupboard, being quick is actually a bonus.
“I think we should leave this for another day.”
The apology is said by us both, each offering a head shake of reassurance also.
I finally cave, sick of these antics.
“You know?”
His eyes quickly snap back up to meet mine. They’re slightly wider than before, and his pupils are dilated. Physical attraction.
“What about you, Irene?”
She wasn’t looking at him, but he was looking at her.
“Your cock! Please, John... ah!” Sherlock yelped when he felt one of john’s fingers probing at his entrance. “Fill me- fuck me with your... ah... huge cock.”
He nods his head to the right, then leads me in that direction down the hall.
She pressed their lips back together, and wrapped her arms round his neck.
John didn’t answer due to the last mouthful of muffin, so he gave her the finger instead. He put on his shoes, grabbed his phone, and hurried out the door before Harriet could ask anymore questions.
I have my work day, and a ‘moment’ with Sherlock.
He opened his eyes just in time to see Sherlock swallow the salty liquid. He fell back, and lay still, breathing heavily.
“Oh god...”
“Please.” John said suddenly, looking up at her with his blue grey eyes. They use to remind her off a calm, picturesque evening by the sea, the waves gently washing up to shore; but now, she could see their was a whole thunderstorm chopping the waves, sending them crashing down on to the beach, and john, a lonely little boat, lost at sea, trying not to capsize.
“Just walked, and visited castles mostly. What did you do?”
I can’t help but blush like a fool when his fingers touch mine as he hands me the rake.
“Have you seen ASDF?”
“What the bloody hell do you think you’re doing?”
“Or maybe I’ll try something new.”
John lifted Sherlock’s skirt up, and pressed a lubed up finger against his throbbing entrance.
Sherlock quickly wrapped her arms around him, and held him tightly to her.
“Right, let’s go then.”
“Baby...” I start, trying to use his hips to moderate and control the speed at which he slams down on my almost painful erection. “Are you going to cum for me?”
“I think they’re blue.”
His vision went white as he shot off in to Sherlock’s mouth, his lower abdominal muscles tensing, earth shattering pleasure filling him. He was unable to form any words when Sherlock finally pulled back, completely stunned. Sherlock sat there panting as his adrenaline high came to an end. He noticed how uncomfortable he was in that moment. His underwear was soaked, and some of his release was beginning to trickle down his leg.
“Yes.”
I smile to reassure him, and move to snuggle up to him.
“I love you.”
“Yes. Yes.” Sherlock panted, threading his fingers in to johns hair.
This is what it means to have someone, isn’t it?
“Hey.”
The seconds they waited while the phone rang went by tantalisingly slow. But then, someone answered. The Field Marshal. He listened patiently to Mrs Watson, then went off in search of John.
“When we live alone, you won’t have to be quiet.”
“Do you want to go to my room?”
Mycroft thought Sherlock should have been annoyed enough to answer by now. She exhaled a shaky breath, then got to her feet.
“Come on then.”
As the autumn breeze swept through the garden, Sherlock leant back against johns side for warmth, and thanked all the deities she didn’t believe in for the life she’d made for herself.
“Well, then, please call me Kate.”
The very notion of Sherlock and his little plan has had me all worked up from the moment he mentioned it, and I’m fairly certain I’ve been half hard since.
I on the other hand, am not so cool, and nearly choke on my own beverage.
“It’s fine.”
Is it meant to hurt this bad?
“I found her like this. I don’t know what’s wrong with her.” She wailed, stroking Harry’s forehead.
Sherlock would be back at boarding school soon. John couldn’t bare to think about it, so instead he shut it out of his mind, and just pulled her closer.
Next came a forest green skirt, a mustard jumper, knee high socks of various colours, the purple top Molly picked, and a black crop top with daisies and a bee on it.
I grin back before gripping his hips, and slamming in to him.
“I’m going to fucking ruin you.” John practically growled.
My breath hitches audibly as the feel of John’s large, calloused hand on my cock translates from nervous impulses, to the most sensual perceptions I have ever felt.
John took one of the biscuits, and nibbled on it slowly, trying not to think about his mother and sister.
Mrs Holmes had changed into a floral dress and red jacket, and already had her hat on, and the pie in a tin. She extended her hand to Sherlock, who took it somewhat begrudgingly. She was nearly six, and more than capable of walking down the street without holding her mum’s hand.
John age: 17
I say cooked... he microwaved spaghetti hoops in the tin and blew up the microwave.
I watch him intently as he reaches for the lube again, and slicks himself up.
“Mikey? What’s wrong?” Mrs Holmes asked from the kitchen when she saw the disgruntled look on her eldest son’s face.
No matter how in-tune we are with each other, we run in very different circles. This prison, this hell hole... it’s my home, for now at least.
“Ah! Oh that’s... mmm...”
“Come on then. You’d better get dressed too.”
“Will it stop them coming down here?”
“How did... how did...?”
Smutty and fluffy. Enjoy!
“Anything for you Mrs Hudson.”
Maybe a simple proposition would get his attention.
“Do you wanna end up in SHU?!”
He physically relaxes, and even lets out a chuckle.
“Ready?” John asked.
She couldn’t find any more words.
“I should go.” I say quietly, gently running my fingers through his soft, blond hair.
“Opening a tin. What does it look like?” Sherlock snarked, the tin of pineapples clearly getting the better off his emotions.
“There must be a few computer tricks...”
John had his head thrown back, his eyelids fluttering as Sherlock worked his zipper undone. After some shuffling about, she managed to pull them down his legs. She could see his erection straining against the confines of his cotton briefs clearly now.
“Now, darling, I know you’re old enough to have sex, but being mature enough to deal with that responsibility is something else entirely.”
His breath is a hot rasp by my ear, one that sends chills up my spine, and blood flooding down to my groin.
“Sure.”
This is new, so new, and yet I find myself wanting more.
He starts to pace.
Dear, Sherlock.
John and his family come over for tea, and he breaks the ice with the curly haired girl.
“John- fu- please- more!”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine.”
Sherlock had finished off his homework faster than he’d thought, and had dragged Rosie with him down to watch John’s game. The pair were stood in the stands at John’s rugby game, dosed on coffee and chocolate biscuits. It was crisp and cold in the early spring morning, and Sherlock’s new skirt was very doing little to keep him warm, even with John’s rugby jumper paired with it. He blew air into his hands, and placed his face between them.
(See the end of the chapter for

Yes, I know it’s kind of out of character for mycroft to bring a girl home, but from
Sherlock furrowed his brows in curiosity.
Yes, upset.
Sherlock smiled warmly at him, and reached down to affectionately stroke his hair from his face.
“I’m so glad you’re home. How... how comes you’re home?”
“What’s going on? I heard my name?”
“So what did you buy?”
Someone grabs my arm, and I’m pulled down a corridor.
John stares at the photo for a good while, his finger gently drifting across her mid section.
She may as well have been from a fairy tale. Those always had happy endings, didn’t they?
“Pass me that pillow.” John said, gesturing to a pillow at Sherlock’s end of the bed.
"Are you coming with?" Sherlock asked, briefly disappearing behind a wall, then reappearing in the living room
I bring my hand up to run a hand through his disheveled ebony curls.
I chortle at this.
He really is something else.
“I’m all sleepy now.”
“Maybe another... oh... time.”
“Please.”
“No one will know they’re there.”
Sherlock whimpers in his overstimulated state, arching his hips and kicking his legs.
“I’m so happy she has him. Aren’t you, dear?”
“Ok, I’ll be as careful as possible.”
“You did... but if you didn’t... I would have found a way...”
“I think there’s decaf...?” Rosie ventures.
I take his hands down press a kiss to his knuckles.
It’s never just... a moment.
John did his best to maintain his composure, but the eager teen to his left was making it very difficult indeed.
His back arched as John stretched him, his mouth gaping in pleasure. John slipped in another finger, grinning when he felt Sherlock convulse around him.
“You are wearing a skirt and tights, to be fair.” Rosie chuckled, and nudged his shoulder affectionately.
“She’ll probably throw a party because you’re having a sleepover.” Sherlock quipped before stuffing a ginger nut into his mouth.
I know ever since our first time, it’s like a fire has been lit inside him, overwhelming him with desire and passion, but this is crazy even for him.
He smelt as he always did after a game; dirt and sweat, with the subtle undertone of his aftershave. John chuckled, and wrapped an arm around the lanky teen.
“Oh, mum-“
“Mmmm...” Sherlock hummed as their hot, writhing bodies grinded together.
Sherlock furrowed his brows as he watched John dig around in his bedside table. When he sat back up, he was holding a small, hot pink object. It only took Sherlock a moment to realise what the object was. A plug.
John got up, and went to her side.
Sherlock and John have to make a decision that may throw them both in danger and challenge their morals.
She lifted her head, her face stained with tears, her mascara running down her cheeks.
He looks up, and smiles.
“Jooohhn...” he groaned, his whole body convulsing as John added a third finger.
“I don’t why I care, but oh my god!”
Unfortunately for them, an extremely drunk Harriet appeared in the doorway.
“Still bored I see.”
“Right, I have to time your contractions. Just let me know when you’re having one.”
“Officer Watson is going to hand you over.” She says with a wink.
WARNING: Sherlock gets called a slut during dirty talk.
Sorry this is late. Enjoy.
“Yes.” Sherlock nodded
“Inmate. A word, please.”
“You ok?” John breathes by my ear as he runs his fingers over the dripping slit of my cock.
“Umm... I guess. If that’s ok?”
“No!”
I feel him throb beneath me and I hear his breath hitch.
“Bugger.” Sherlock muttered under her breath.
I look over to Mike, who’s sound asleep. The depth of his sleeping is much alike to a log, so I don’t face any chance of waking him, but I reach into my locker for a sock to silence myself anyway. Actually, better take two. Don’t really want to make a mess.
SHERLOCK’S POV
“You know... I still have my safe word...”
I give him a questioning look, and he catches on, thankfully, eliminating my need to actually ask him the question.
Sherlock grinned, and leant in to kiss him, soft, and tentative.
“Oh fuck!” He howled in response, bolting upright.
Yes, I know I’ve already used this chapter title in my other teenlock fic...
“You said you wouldn’t ask for details.” John chided as an insistent Harry followed him in to his room.
“Get on your knees then.” He leant in so his lips were millimetres away from Sherlock’s ear. “And take my cock like the little slut you are.”
He looked up to see Lesteade looking at him.
The brunette pouted, but moved to rest his head on johns neck so he could sort out the shower. Almost as soon as the water was hot enough, John had Sherlock pinned up against the wall by his hips.
Sherlock shuddered against John. He could feel himself getting hard again. Fuck.
“Shhhh... just relax.”
“Not particularly. Why?”
“Holmes, you’re back! We thought they’d locked you up and thrown away the key.”
“Yes please dear. Thank you. Here, take some money.”
Sherlock looked spaced, his eyes glazed over as he stared out in front of him.
As much as I want to leave him relaxed and docile, I only have half an hour before my shift starts, and the last thing I want to do is leave him to wake up alone.
John pulled back from her to look at her. He found himself sobbing when he realised it could be for the last time. They heard a conductor ordering the men to get on the trains.
It kept getting better, the pleasure increasing, overriding the weird feeling completely.
23rd of July 1917
Sherlock’s fists were clenched as he trashed about, his eyes screwed shut, on the verge of tears of frustration.
I lean in and press a kiss to his lips, my heart all but fluttering when I feel him smiling in to the kiss.
-love Sherlock x.
John quickly did his fly back up, and tucked his shirt back in as he got to his feet.
“Well... that was weird.”
“Are you ok?”
Sherlock exhaled a shaky breath. Johns fingers tickled his skin as he pulled his briefs down. John quirked his eyebrows. Sherlock’s cock was a decent length, and as pale as the rest of him, nestled amongst dark curls. John grinned to himself, and licked his lips. Sherlock was the picture of awkward as he watched John’s reaction. When John finally looked back up, his usually gunmetal blue eyes had turned navy with arousal.
She sighed happily when she heard John say her name.
He looks vulnerable as he sits there wrapped in my basic grey towel, his dark tresses dripping water down his face, hence the need for a towel.
Enjoy! :)
Sherlock frowned at her sister and slumped down against johns chair.
Of course, such with anything of the likeness, these moments are juxtaposed with the hours of harrowing emptiness that follow.
“How do you want it, baby? Hard?” I growl, squeezing his ass.
“Who could turn down such a tempting invitation?”
John took her hand, and lead her down the stairs, mostly for support in her heeled shoes.
Sherlock looked down at the kaki garment in hand.
“I know it’s ok.” Sherlock answered rather too quickly.
Sherlock wasted no time in pushing the pram out the door, and speed walking down the road to the train station.
“John...” Sherlock moaned with a roll of his hips.
She gasped out a moan, and threw her head back. He continued his descent down her torso, sucking on her pulse point, nipping softly at her collar bone, slipping his tongue between her cleavage.
His eyes drift from mine as he speaks of her, a brief insight in to how deeply she effects him.
John got her to lift her hips again as he pulled the delicate, cotton garment down her legs. This was the first time he’d seen her like this. Exposed. Apart from the stockings and the belt that held them up, she was completely naked.
The two women turned to look at the youngest member of the family.
As it turns out, quite the turn on for me.
“Alright, go on then.”
Oh fuck, just the reminder that I get to cum inside him nearly has me shoot off right there.
John held Sherlock by the waist as he slowly dismounted him. Sherlock fell back down within seconds, completely exhausted.
“It’s no problem. I’m just glad I can help.”
“I am utterly, completely, head over heals in love with you.”
“Offer your friend a drink.”
“Mmmm... what’s gotten in to you?”
“We need to stay here.”
“Fine.” She lied.
“Mmmngh!” Sherlock cried.
“Please.” He chuckles mirthfully. “Don’t bother lying to me, Sherlock. It does not work.”
I tug his hair softly and run my hand down his chest to pinch one of his rosy nipples.
Shelrock gets punished for his behaviour at brunch. He should have known it would come back to bite him in the ass.
“How you feeling?”
Sherlock squealed indignantly, scrabbling to keep the sheet wrapped around his waist, as if modesty was any concern of his.
A rock would have been preferable to what may actually be residing there.
“Shhhh... noisy little slut...”
“Hang, on. Hang on. Actually, close your eyes.”
Sherlock slowly shuffled in his lap so she was straddling him, her knees either side of his hips.
As I pass through the halls, I catch sight of the clock on the wall.
I wonder what his gag reflex is like...
Said boy tilts his head in my direction, so I know he’s aware of my presence.
She then took a step towards him, and wrapped her arms around his neck.
Sherlock! Sherlock!”
“Well that’s not what people normally say.”
3. BDSM
That’s until I hear the sound of someone hitting the wall.
“I’m telling you, you ain’t never seen a pair of jugs like that before.”
“No, I’m quite alright, thank you. I’ll be fine with an Apple.”
“They’d get thrown out.” Rosie chuckled, shooting a pointed look in Sherlock’s direction.
“Are you sure? Mycroft never talks to women. The last women he spoke to was at a drive through where she asked if he wanted fries with his Big Mac.”
“Let’s nail that motherfucker.”
She moved her hand down, and gingerly wrapped it around his clothed cock.
Sherlock giggled as he watched John’s fumbled attempt of pulling his trousers down his legs.
Hope you guys enjoy this! Let me know if you have suggestions. 😉
John felt his heart skip a beat.
"Great." Sherlock said, winking at John after his mother had turned her back to them both.
I nod, then depart to my bunk.
19th of October 1918
“Only a few minutes now. Better hurry up.”
She also told me to write a blog. Write about everything that happens to me. Let’s just say, my blog page is about as empty as the chocolate isle of a supermarket on the 15th of February. Who doesn’t love sales?
That’s not a bad idea...
Thankfully she didn’t say anymore on the matter and instead brought her teacup to her lips, only to instantly recoil when the cold liquid filled her mouth.
I furrow my eyebrows.
Sherlock moved his hand even faster, his wrist aching.
John. There’s John.
Sherlock blushed and buried his head in johns neck.
Sherlock’s arousal flatlined.
“Mammal... mammal... oh, it’s gone weird now! I’ve said it too many times!”
“Well, only because you asked so nicely...” I purr before digging my nails in to the sofa and driving in to him with abandon.
John was loitering in Sherlock’s doorway as Mrs Holmes set up a bed for him.
“Leave it on. And the socks.”
I can feel myself seizing up at the thought, my nails digging in to his shoulders.
“It’s weird. But keep going.”
Fuck, I’m getting hard just thinking about it.
He lifted his arms to allow John to pull the garment off, then reconnected their lips in a hungry kiss.
John presses down on my chest till I’m laid out on my back.
No such luck.
He continued pushing till he was completely sheathed within Sherlock’s tight walls.
“I did. Is that your Sherlock?”
After dessert, the pair got up to leave, John still focused on the man. He was evidently on a date with a blonde whom he had seemingly little interest in as he was paying more attention to Sherlock than to her. Just as they were about to leave, John caught him staring at Sherlock more intensely. John normally wasn’t a petty man, but this was rubbing him up the wrong way. He made sure the man was watching as he pulled Sherlock to him by the waist, and pressed his lips up against hers. She was surprised at first, but melted in to the kiss after a moment.
Sherlock brushes it off, and skulks back over to his chair in the corner.
“Yes. Fine.”
“He’s a very quiet baby, isn’t he?” Mrs Holmes observed as she stroked her grandsons cheek.
“Do I have consent to play with you?”
“I...”
She and Sherlock had met at a rugby game. She’d been watching her at the time boyfriend playing a game, and was sat in the stands with all the other girlfriends when Sherlock had come and sat down at the end of the bench. He looked so awkward she thought he might jump in the air from fright if she spoke to him. She decided she would regardless. If he wasn’t too jumpy, she may gain a friend. If he was, he might fall of his seat, and that would be a laugh.
Sherlock quirked his eyebrows, intrigued.
“I don’t understand why he likes that game. I understand why you like watching.” She said when she noticed the small grin forming on her friends face.
After a moment, I feel John’s hand grip my wrist and pull me towards him.
"Ok... I don't think you're concussed." John said, sitting back on his heals.
“I love you so much...”
“Get the red ones.” He said finally. “That’s your colour.”
“No, that’s my suspender belt. It- it unhooks at the back. Ugh. Here.”
“Really?” I stammer, my eyes widening even further when he nods in earnest.
He slouched down on the armchair, and began fighting the urge to close his eyes.
“You’ve met him, how many friends do you imagine he has? I’m probably the closest thing he has to a friend.”
Irene put the TV on, then jumped on to the chair beside Sherlock.
Sherlock chuckled and shook his head at the cheesy line. He settled back with his book, and simply enjoyed johns company.
“The age for recruitment is 16. John will be 17 later this year.”
He was doing his best to stay quiet, but the way John’s tongue worked the underside of his cock had him ready to burst.
What if it’s really awkward? What if he doesn’t enjoy it?
Sherlock giggled at this. John was the only person who made her do that.
Oh fucking hell- oh, oh, oh!
Sherlock jumped up from the bed, and reached across John to uncover his laptop from a stack of papers.
“No, that’s not happening.”
Sherlock swallowed audibly, and exhaled a shaky breath.
He looked down the corridor at his now closed bedroom door. He knew Sherlock was behind it. He had an idea of what Sherlock might be up to in there, but it wasn’t confirmed until he heard a buzzing noise coming through the wooden barrier, followed by a low wine from Sherlock. On the other side of the door, Sherlock had his head thrown back in bliss as he plunged his vibrator further inside his channel. John went to open the door but it didn’t budge.
“You’re so tight! Mmmnngh!” John grunted against Sherlock’s neck.
John looked Sherlock up and down, then settled on his eyes. Sherlock had very nice eyes. They were so pale, and piercing that John felt as though he may be able to stare into his soul. He realised he was staring, and hadn’t blinked for about 10 seconds. He compensated for this by blinking four times, then adverting his gaze to the floor.
I get checked over by moly, who I can tell is holding herself back from hugging me.
“Everything ok?”
“Mmm... do we have to be anywhere?”
“I better get ready to have sore knees then.”
Is it hot in here? It feels really hot.
2. What pet names should they use?
John was mesmerised as he watched Sherlock’s body react to him. All his muscles were tensed, his hands were gripping the sofa cushions, and he was breathing frantically.
Sherlock and John’s relationship starts to develop.
“Nothing. He said nothing.”
"Your ribs are bruised, but I'm not too worried. Obviously, I'm not really, or at all qualified to make theses diagnoses, so maybe you should see a doctor?" John said cautiously, his eyes landing everywhere but Sherlock's.
“Never mind, stupid question.”
“We will, don’t worry. I’ll even make dinner to say thank you. Sherlock, just sit there and look pretty.” John chuckled.
John rubbed his eyes, still not fully awake.
“Mmmmhhh...” Sherlock moaned in to his mouth.
“John, let’s go.” Sherlock said, tugging on johns sleeve.
“Indeed.” Sherlock murmured, already half asleep.
She smiled, then left Sherlock to open the letter in peace.
His hands had stilled, and were now gripping her ribcage just below her breasts, his nails lightly digging in to her skin.
“That yesterday... that wasn’t the reaction of someone who’s ‘fond’ of someone.”
They all turned around to see John come into the kitchenette to fill up his water bottle.
“John... oh god... agh... ah!”
He’s tight around my fingers. It’s been a while.
“Oh!” John gasped, throwing his head back.
“Irene... you let a high profile criminal walk fee out the door.” John utters in misbelief.
John was at her side in seconds, cradling her head to his chest as she sobbed.
John felt his blood rushing to his cock, his jeans suddenly uncomfortably tight. Sherlock looked so gorgeous.
I find myself keening in to his touch, little whimpers of pleasure escaping my lips as I cling to his shoulders.
“Come on John... take those fingers out and give it to me good and proper.” He moans breathlessly as he squirms around a recently added third finger.
I turn back, and see John watching me from the door.
“Do you remember when all my scars were from rugby?”
He had a feeling he wasn’t going to like this.
“How did you know all that?”
“Do we have to? I got tested last week. I’m clean.”
At that, Sherlock sat up.
She came back a moment later to present the baby to Sherlock.
“Fine.”
“She’s started throwing things... so maybe it’s better you’re not here. Wouldn’t want a... foot stall... to the face now, would you?” Mycroft grimaced at a loud clattering on her end.
“I want to have sex with you.”
John slid his underwear back down, then took Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock’s heart hammered violently when John placed both their hands in his cock. It was warm, and stiff, and throbbed under Sherlock’s touch. He heard John moan softly, and his eyelashes fluttered.
“Sherlock- Mmmmm...”
“That’s not nearly enough time.” I add to save him from further confusion.
"Jillian Cooke, murdered last week by her coworker in a crime of passion, obvious, and yet none of you have solved it."
“You Alright dear?”
Hope you guys enjoy!
“You’re really horny, aren’t you?” John teased, pausing his actions to press a kiss to Sherlock’s inner thigh.
There’s nothing like it, and no words printed on any page of any book could ever make me feel the way he does.
“Has any one already done the ‘I’m never drinking again’ speech?”
“Harder!” Sherlock wailed.
“Class is about to start. Enjoy French, mike.”
I don’t do small talk, it’s pointless. And yet, I find myself hanging on his every word.
Oh god, what does he want?
She grins.
John took her trunk with one arm, and wrapped the other around Sherlock’s middle.
"I'm not keeping you from Rosie, am I?" Sherlock asked suddenly, not caring how bitter he sounded.
“Sure you’re not. Ok, I’m pretty sure you’re supposed to be somewhere, my darling.”
The announcement that war had broken out was on every radio channel in the country. Everyone, Sherlock included, was fully aware of what was going on by now. She was too caught up listening to what her parents were saying that she failed to consider one major consequence. She’d finally managed to fall asleep after hours of pacing her room, only to be interrupted by something colliding with her window.
“No, no, no. Sports and I don’t mix. Last time I played a sport, I got knocked out by a tennis racket.”
Sherlock wriggled, a smile on his face. He was so turned on he thought he would fall off John’s lap. John was attacking his lips again in seconds, thrusting his tongue in and out of his mouth. Sherlock started to rock his hips against johns faster than before, desperate for friction. He reached down in between them, and gave a few pumps to Johns erection, already hard again.
A sob wracked the brunette’s body as he sank his teeth in to johns flesh, causing the other boy to let out a cry of his own.
I frown.
I shift my weight from foot to foot, the fact that I am still holding his arm completely forgotten.
John gave her a shy smile, his cheeks also turning red.
Also, imagine the song ‘you are always on my mind’ playing here.
Sherlock lifted his pelvis, and began bucking his hips to match johns thrusts.
She looked at him with her crystal blue eyes. Although they were the same colour as Sherlock’s, hers were warm, and full of curiosity. Mycroft’s were cold, and piercing. Like a reptile’s.
“Thank her for me.”
He felt Sherlock had the right to know this.
“Mikey, how come you’ve never introduced us before?”
I feel my chest constrict.
“I write a blog.”
That was the first day John left the house.  He was bound to a wheelchair, but he’d been responding well to physiotherapist, and there was hope he would be walking again within the year. Sherlock had barely left his side. Neither her mother nor Mrs Watson said anything about it, and simply let her do as she pleased. She’d been going to school begrudgingly, then racing back to John. She would be leaving school in a few months anyway, but for now she was stuck. Then of course she’d be off to finishing school, then university. She’d always looked forward to the later, but now the idea of leaving John was almost unbearable. When she got home, John was waiting for her by the back door. They’d originally gone out on the premise of picking gooseberries for Mrs Holmes to make jam, but the amount obtained seemed rather sad, and were now sat having afternoon tea on the lawn. Mycroft was due over any moment with Lucy but she was late as she often was since the arrival of the latter.
“Let’s have a look at your neck then.”
“I guess you did.”
Honestly, I hate people sometimes. Work was alright, but some dick on the road cut me up. I stalk in to my flat, and settle on the sofa to watch the football. After the match, I flick over to one of the porn channels. It’s one of those cringey ones with shitty dialogue and a shitty plot. That doesn’t mean its not turning me on. I watch for a little bit, but I’m very quickly distracted by images of the boy from yesterday... I still don’t know his name... but his gorgeously chiseled face is etched in to my brain. I take my aching cock in hand, and begin to pump my wrist up and down. It’s stress relief, if nothing else. I’m not even watching the television anymore; the image of the boy in only his towel is enough to have me moaning and arching my back. I bite my lip to silence myself as I cum hard, some of it going on the floor, but the majority goes in to my hand. Normally I feel relaxed and soothed after, but now I feel nothing but shame. I have to be back at work again in just under five hours. At least for now, I’ve satisfied some of my urges.
“I really can’t believe he did this... Lestrade interviewed him a little while ago. He can’t believe he did it either.”
“Well, I wouldn’t say you make me look like a complete idiot.”
“Alright dear. Tin is on the counter when you’re ready to go.”
“Mmmm...” Sherlock moaned, throwing his head back.
Mycroft smiled, then left Sherlock with the tot.
“Mmmm...” Sherlock hummed happily before resting his head on johns shoulder.
“Anne, these are my children, John, and Harriet. Children, this is Mrs Holmes, and Sherlock. They live next door.”
“Yes.”
“No. She won’t let anything but water past her lips. She hasn’t said a word to anyone either.”
“Of course you are.”
They were sat under his desk, bursting at the seams with giggles as they drank a bottle of off limits scotch.
How could he be so careless?
“I’ll be sure to walk you.”
I walk up behind him, taking in to account how many inmates are going to be whiteness to this.
Sherlock recoiled a bit, curling in on himself.
“Get more under the table!”
Sherlock grinned and nodded his head before planting a kiss on johns lips.
The next noise was a knock at the door.
Sherlock let out a yip when John flipped him over and pinned him to the mattress.
“What is it like?” Roberts asked cautiously.
Sherlock age: 5
“Mmmm...” John groaned as he added a second finger.
“It’s because you didn’t think I’d be ok with it.” She sighed as she pulled back.
“Just a little stiff. Guess I slept funny.” He mused, taking a sip of his tea.
“Here.”
“Alright, this is going to sting.”
“There you go.”
“Boyfriend?”
I move my hands from his shoulders round to the front of his chest. I grab a fistful of his blue shirt, and pull him closer to me. A low groan vibrates through his body.
John age: 20
God, today has gone by slowly.
“Oh...” Sherlock moaned.
John continued his path down Sherlock’s body, and down to his cock.
“John.” He curtly nodded his head, then sauntered back down the hall, and disappeared up the stairs.
“Go for it John!”
John chuckled, and bumped Sherlock’s nose with his.
“You sure?”
Was this a panic attack?
John chuckled softly, briefly wondering when the terrifying teenager would make an appearance. Sherlock got his own pair of pyjamas out from under his pillow, and started to undress. He unbuttoned his school shirt, slowly revealing new, pale skin centimetre by centimetre. John was a little startled by Sherlock’s actions, and wasn’t sure where to look. He tried to look away, but couldn’t help himself, and ended up staring at the other boy. Sherlock took off his shirt, revealing his long torso, and washboard stomach. John felt his breath catch in his throat, and his boxer shorts tighten. He prayed to god his school trousers were loose enough to hide his arousal.
“Mmmmm! Ah..! ah... John...”
Sherlock looked over at John as he opened the front door.
Mrs Hudson helped Sherlock to get the dress down, then gently slipped it over her head.
The blonde boy was behind the door in a suit and tie, a hair band in hand.
This time, my gulp is as conspicuous as a slap across the face.
“Ahh!” John groaned as he felt Sherlock sit back on his cock.
Might not be anytime soon, but it’s going to happen.
“Ngghhh.” John groaned.
“You’ll need to get going if you want to catch your train, please tell me you’re ready.”
“If I can, do you want me to sit in with you?”
They all heard her perfectly well, and did as she said. Alone with the letter, she began to read.
“Not yet. You?”
Mr Watson didn’t even try to pretend he wasn’t lying as he spoke. He knew Sherlock would see straight through it. There was no deceiving her. She headed back to her father, her stomach sinking, and her heart crumbling.
John was kissing him again, heated and passionate as ever. His fingers were in Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock’s arms were around his neck, his legs wrapped around the blond’s hips.
“Irene, I think I’m gonna go.”
His breath hitches.
“Oh gah- mmmm!” Sherlock moaned, arching her back in to his touch.
“You... you what?” She asked, unable to process the information she’d been given.
“Mrs Hudson’s. Just for a visit.”
“Yes. I promise.”
“So, Sherlock Holmes... will you marry me?”
Mycroft smiled.
“Mmmm... ok, ok. Here, lie back.”
“Please, you really think he can last that long?” Sherlock grumbled, not really wanting to think about his brothers sex life, but wasn’t willing to let an opportunity to mock him pass by.
“I know.”
Sherlock age: 13
“Please...” He coos, rocking his hips against me.
“Fair point.”
“It’s not that, I just- I just didn’t think...”
Sherlock returns to minimum.
“I don’t mind.” He said with a sultry smile. “I’ll just go clean my teeth.”
He takes a quick look around us in the otherwise unoccupied corridor before walking over to me.
Every time I see him, I feel a sort of rush, a rush that intensifies when he looks over to me.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fine.”
“I haven’t. Have you?”
“Fair point. Let’s get you cleaned up then, shall we?”
I put away the equipment while Sherlock puts his shirt back on.
“Please.” John said quickly, no care to how desperate he sounded.
“It’s alright, let’s not panic.”
“Whether I care or not, she will still be dead. Caring is not an advantage.”
“Wha- oh! Ah, ah! Oh...” Sherlock gasped out a chuckle when John swiped his tongue along the skin on his pubic bone.
“I’m gonna make you cum just from this....” John whispered, his voice low and husky. “Then I’m gonna fuck you long and hard...”
I can’t resist the urge to open my mouth when John runs his tongue along my bottom lip.
Once Sherlock was on his back, John settled between his legs, and applied a generous amount of lube on his fingers.
“Nah, it’s alright. I’m just on my way out.”
“Don’t be. I like him.”
He should have been happy, but he was anything but. This was not a good thing. His dad wasn’t exactly a bad man, he was just very different to John. They had nothing in common, and didn’t have the best connection.
“Turn around.”
“What are you doing here? It’s... 04:00.” She said, casting an eye to the grandfather clock in the corner.
What the title says.
He grins before pressing a chaste kiss to my cheek. I try and catch his lips, but he pushes me back with a hand to the chest.
Sherlock beamed back as she took his hand and lead him over to where her mother was stood with the baby.
Sherlock lifted her limp head.
Sherlock ran his tongue down the length, and up again before placing his mouth around it.
He catches on and increases the speed of his wrist which in turn, increases my pleasure.
He slipped another finger inside Sherlock’s opening, making his back arch.
Sherlock felt tears begin to flow from her eyes again.
What if it wasn’t enjoyable for either of them?
When they got back, Mrs Hudson insured he stayed for dinner. Sherlock was sent upstairs to get changed from her out door clothes, while Mrs Hudson asked John to sit with her in the kitchen. She had become like a grandmother not only to Mycroft and Sherlock, but to Harriet and John too. Sherlock of course hadn’t gone up, and was eavesdropping on the stairs to whatever they had to say.
I reach down between Sherlock’s legs, and begin to pump his warm, pulsing cock.
“Hello.”
“Mmmm... oh god...”
“Jooohhnnnn...”
John was home.
With one final deep breath, he pushed inside of her.
He grinned to himself as he got up to fetch them. Sherlock felt the mattress shift, and heard John moving away. He knew he hadn’t left the room, as Sherlock had made it clear he didn’t want John to leave the room when he was bound. He felt the mattress dip under johns weight a few seconds later.
His stomach dropped and his heart froze. He’d seen him.
Sherlock giggled as John pulled her closer and pressed a kiss on the sweet spot where her ear met her neck.
“Did I wake you?”
“Thanks.”
I can’t imagine it’s been more than about 30 seconds before I feel myself reaching my climax.
He stands still, hands behind his back, his eyes on the floor.
She released the breath she didn’t know she’d been holding, her heart thumping away.
John rolled his eyes, and pulled Sherlock to his feet.
“What’s wrong?” I ask cautiously, scanning his face.
Sherlock obeyed, and wrapped his legs around johns waist. The broad teen reached in between them, and lined his rock hard cock up with Sherlock’s entrance.
Oh fuck.
Mrs Hudson placed a cup of tea in her hands, and gently squeezed her shoulder.
I examine the box a moment, taking in the dimensions.
“Well, I suppose love is blind.”
“Well, come on. What else?”
“Yeah, yeah, good.”
Mrs Holmes returned after a moment with a tin.
2 months then he’s out, and he gets to go home... does he still live with his parents...? Is he going to come back with me...?
I crawl out from under the table and peer over the desk in to the darkness.
“System’s fucked.” I parrot.
She felt John tensing beside her, and immediately reached for his hand.
“Hello.” Sherlock said, smiling falsely before turning back to the other boy. “You left in a hurry. Late night study session.”
He chuckled as he took a sip of said tea. Sherlock felt sadness ebbing at her as she watched him. He could sit here with her, laugh and joke, and everything was fine. Then he’d fall asleep, and down in to the hollow pit of nightmares from which he couldn’t escape. She wished she could help more. She couldn’t wake him up when he was dreaming in case he went in to shock. All she could do was listen to him scream and cry, waiting for him to wake up. She could reassure him when he woke up, hold his hand, kiss his cheeks, tell him he was safe.
“Sorry?”
“She is, I swear.” The redhead boy exclaimed, crossing his fingers over his chest.
Mr Holmes had said goodbye to her before he’d left for the home guard that morning, but she still needed to say goodby to Mycroft and Lucy. She and John briefly stopped by on the way to the station. Mycroft almost seemed sad to see her little sister go. Sentiment was never something present with Mycroft, and yet her face was definitely more solemn than normal. Lucy was too young to understand, and sat quietly at her aunt’s feet, playing with her shoelaces. They arrived at the station, and quickly bustled on to a train in to town.
I know I’ve already told him I want him to, but he seems to have either forgotten that in the midst of his pleasure, or he just wants to warn me in case I’ve changed my mind.
“Did you enjoy that?”
“John?”
One last smack had Sherlock reach his climax, and release himself all over johns legs.
We’re not even kissing anymore as we time our thrusts to meet each other.
Neither of them were sure when it happened, but the couple had found themselves on the dance floor, bopping away to Beyoncé.
A thrust of his hips.
He lifted Sherlock up on to the counter, and positioned himself between the brunette’s long legs. Sherlock felt pleasure coursing through him as he felt john’s thick erection poking at him through both their jeans. John massaged Sherlock’s tongue with his own, drawing low moans from the other boy, fuelling arousal in both of them. Sherlock ran his fingers down johns back, and fisted his shirt in to his hand, lightly raking his bare back with his nails.
To John:
His eyes flick up all of a sudden, and he sees me.
Accustomed to her daughters cert and abrupt manner, she abided without question, and brought Sherlock’s writing set to her.
I’m so wet and hard for him right now, my briefs both soaking wet and threatening to rip as John continues to tease me.
“Did you know that all polar bears are left handed?” Sherlock asked after a moment.
“No problem. Come over any time dear.”
Sherlock recalls the night he lost his virginity.
“That’s good. Alright, catch you later... stud.”
I wobble a little, so John offers me his arm.
“Thank you for this.” He says after a moment as he rolls out from under me, instead moving to lie on my chest.
“Yes.”
“John- mngh...” I grunt as earth shattering waves of pleasure rush over me, setting my whole body alight with endorphin induced bliss.
‘If I could make this stop, I would.’ I think to myself as I press a kiss to his temple.
“Am I really that loud?”
“Very surprised by it, but... very enthused.”
Lestrard simply shrugged off Sherlock’s complaints, and assured the boy he’d be more vigilant in future. For the past few days, the boys would walk down to the coffee shop and have a drink together before parting ways to go home. At the end of the day, Sherlock had lost sight of John. He finally found him talking to ruby.
“The police officer has taken his hat off. It’s always bad news when they do that.”
“Alright. Sherlock, can you hold her?”
Mrs Watson smiled sadly at her. She could see how much the girl truly loved her son. She highly doubted there would be any ‘funny business’.
He’s completely sated, eyes closed, chest heaving, his fingers digging in to the sides of the chair.
“As long as you want. My father is away at a conference, so his opinions on the matter is moot, but my mother won’t mind, and I don’t care what Mycroft thinks.”
I begin to worry that I’ve done something wrong, out of turn, but then, he’s kissing me.
“Let’s see shall we?”
He left the next day with the box of donuts, and the feel of Paulette’s soft lips against his.
John comes to Sherlock’s rescue.
She smiles when she presents them to me.
Another hour went by before she finally spoke.
“Ugh...”
“Sherl... I’ve missed you.”
John marched swiftly to the phone, his heart thumping.
“You might want to stop... or this is going to be over before it even starts.” He chuckled somewhat nervously as he pulled his briefs back up.
“Not particularly, but I guess I’ll have to. Alright, I’ll be back in a few minutes.”
“I love you, John.” She said simply.
John sighed. He sat up, lifting Sherlock’s body as he did, then carefully slid out from under him.
“Mint choc chip? I don’t think so.” She laughed as she shook her head.
Everything I am, my heart, my soul, now my body, I want him to have it.
“Just give me your hand.”
“More drinks!”
“Your hair is so soft.” John cooed softly as he massaged Sherlock’s scalp.
“No, not really.”
Smoking.
John smiled, and lent down to kiss her lips.
Sherlock looked down at the sheet covering his body, then shrugged.
Rosie and Molly chuckled.
Sherlock crawled over to John, and settled at his side.
“She’s gone upstairs. Not feeling well.”
John couldn’t resist the temptation of assaulting Sherlock’s pale neck, dipping his tongue in to the hollow of his throat.
“She does have a point, you guys do have sex everywhere.” Irene chuckled as she entered the flat, two bags of shopping balanced in her arms.
No, I won’t allow it.
“John...” Sherlock gasped out, clawing desperately at the blond’s back.
John couldn’t help it as his hips began bucking up to meet Sherlock’s, thrusting his clothed cock between Sherlock’s thighs.
John.
Sherlock pulls back, and looks at me with wide eyes.
Oh, fucking hell, his tip is rubbing in between my legs, and fuck, oh god...
“You say the word penguin wrong.”
“In fact...” He pauses to sniff. “I could even tell you who it was with.”
“When we get home, you can be as loud as you want.” I purr with a gentle stroke to his inner thighs.
“You have a lovely home. Very stylish.”
Sherlock was a lot more relaxed this time.
“They think that I fancy you.”
“You are gonna have to do something about that skirt.” John murmured, looking down at the garment, white streaks staining it.
John motioned for her to come down. She crept down the stairs, hugging her blue dressing gown to her. She unlocked the back door to let John in.
Once outside again, Sherlock finally relaxed.
(See the end of the chapter for
I feel whole again.
“Mmmm...” he says, not convinced.
She nodded.
He reached out to stroke Sherlock’s cheek. He flinched, a small whimper escaping him.
It feels like someone has lit a fire between my legs, and not in the way that people describe being horny, it actually feels as though I’m burning.
“Thank you.”
This is a sort of fluffy, comedy, filler chapter. Thank you all for the votes on the suggestions. Smut in the next chapter ;) Hopefully it’s improving.
John nodded when the blonde girl turned to look at him.
She looked up to see Mrs Hudson staring sadly at her.
“Nearly everyone likes popcorn.”
2. Dancing queen
“John? It’s... 04:00.” I say with a quick glance to the clock on the wall.
She eyes me over her coffee cup as she takes a sip.
Sherlock never normally swore, only in their more intimate moments. For now, just having him groaning profanities at the back of his throat was enough for John, but he wanted to have him screaming them in pleasure. Sherlock had his eyes squeezed shut and his fingers tangled in johns hair as the older boy abused his neck. He locked his ankles round johns ass, pulling him close. He moved his hands from Johns hair to grab at his hoodie.
John inhaled deeply.
“I would love to.”
He takes a moment, then returns his attention to me, a look of pure lust on his face as he allows his eyes to roam my exposed, nude body.
We look down between us at the miscellaneous jumble of fluids soaking our garments.
“Morning.”
“Please go away.”
“Hey... John.”
John leant his weight in the wall either side of Sherlock’s head so he could pull out.
My day pretty much sucks, except for one inmate getting stuck in between the vending machines after diving in for a packet of jammy dodgers.
Sherlock continued moving his lips down John’s body.
“Oh, lovely. Stay for a cuppa?”
“Fine, keep at it. If you fall through the floor and end up in downstair’s living room, I’m not helping you explain. ‘I’m a dickhead’ that’s all you’re gonna have to say.”
“Like what?”
It’s a lot more complicated, and I’m not even sure we’d manage in here.
“You taste like soap.” John grimaced.
John practically dragged Sherlock out of the cafe, and down the street where upon they stopped outside a very familiar shop.
“Oh fuck- so tight...”
“I wanted to ask you something.”
My voice has returned to a husky rasp as I drag my fingernails down his back.
John wasn’t there to feel the moment.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, and reached for a biscuit. A chocolate bourbon. Sherlock held it with shaky hands before putting it back down, and eating a custard cream.
He noted the faint words in pen on johns cheek where he’d fallen asleep on his notes, and the sleepy dust in the corners of his eye.
She giggled on the other end. Sherlock’s laughter was the single best sound he had ever heard, and her smile the best thing he’d ever seen.
He shuffles his feet and keeps his eyes down.
“Yes!”
Sherlock glanced down at the menu, the brownie and ice cream taking her eye.
“What he means is; can we stay here, please. Right babe?” John quipped, turning to look at the brunette.
“What is it, Mrs Hudson?” She asked as she entered the kitchen.
“John, are you home?”
John nearly came in his pants at Sherlock’s words, a strangled moan escaping him. The brunette in question was eyeing John intently, wiggling his hips suggestively as he waited for john’s answer. His chest was heaving, his cheeks were flushed, eyes wide, lips wet and sticky.
Mycroft was sat in one of the lawn chairs on the patio, a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits on the table beside her.
I almost forget that I have to respond to this.
Oh god, the things I would do to him if I could...
John suspected Sherlock was already sound asleep by the time he left the room.
I traipse across the grounds to the greenhouse where, leant up against a table, I wait for the other inmates to be escorted inside by another CO.
“Come here. Let me do that for you.”
“Sherlock!” Mrs Holmes snapped. “Not at the dinner table.” She instructed, thwacking the younger boy with a tea towel as gently as one can thwack someone. “Swear at him all you like later.”
God, I want him so badly.
After a moment of hesitation, John kissed Sherlock on her plump, pink lips. When he pulled back, her eyes were wide.
He looked down at the blanket, then turned to look at Sherlock. He reached out to stroke her cheek, which was adorn with fresh tears. She closed her eyes, and lent into his touch.
"No, no you’re not."
Sherlock glared at the babbling woman, his nostrils flaring. John couldn’t help but notice he looked like a pissed off rabbit.
Sherlock age: 8
“The shop you got the test tubes from.” She told him earnestly.
“What are you gonna call him?”
“Please john... cum inside me- oh Christ! Fuck... gah! Fill me with your cum!” Sherlock’s desperate howls tipped John over the edge.
Sherlock bowed his head as he slipped in to sub-space.
Just a snippet of Sherlock and John’s friendship.
“Oh god... ah...”
“Yes darling?”
God, everyone was so stupid. This was a thought that ran through the curly haired teen’s head nearly everyday. He was sat in his history class, wondering why he needed to know what methods the ancient Romans used when farming. He’d also fallen asleep in maths, and completely zoned out in P.E, resulting in being hit in the face by a dodge ball.
“Sleep overs are fun. Apparently.” Sherlock shrugged.
Sherlock enveloped the head of Johns cock slowly, running the flat of his tongue along the underside, being mindful of his teeth.
“Did you sleep Alright?”
He’s gentle whilst he stretches me open. Wouldn’t want to have to stop before the had even started.
“I know I heard. The lady doth make a good point, baby.” John teased before allowing Sherlock to settle back in his lap. “But I love you anyway, you quirky box of fries.”
“I need your cock inside me.”
Sherlock panted heavily, wriggling as John pulled his fingers out. He settled between Sherlock’s legs after sorting out a condom. He sat for a moment to allow his eyes to wonder Sherlock’s face. His head clouded with arousal as he drank in the sight of him. His skin was glistening with saliva, on his neck, his cheeks, flushed pink, eyes desperate and needy.
“I fucked up... you know that inmate... moriarty.”
“Thanks.”
I know he likes it rough, but I do have to be careful with him, no matter what he says.
I feel John reach an arm up, and begin to play with my hair, gently tugging at the roots as he combs his fingers through my tresses.
My heart is beating so fast.
“Sherlock.” Mrs Holmes turned to look at her son.
He bucks his hips with abandon, grinding on to me as if his life depends on it.
Sherlock age: 16
Mycroft raised her head in disbelief when the crying ceased.
I gently lower him down on to the cushions, and ever so slowly start to pull out.
I do as he asks, making him moan low in his throat.
Sherlock grinned, and made his way across the floor. He dropped his dressing gown, and John licked his lips. Sherlock was stunning. Long legs, perfect cock surrounded by dark curls, smooth skin, lightly toned stomach, sharp cheekbones, and glistening silver eyes. Silver eyes that were focused on John, hungry.
Hope you guys enjoy this story!
“Not too tight.” I tell him as I cuff his hands behind his back.
Death.
“I love you.” John grinned at his pouty boyfriend.”
John turned to look at Mike, who shook his head.
“I... thank you.”
Oh I think so.
Sherlock did as he was told, and lay with his legs spread in front of John.
“I need to talk to you.”
Sherlock sighed happily, rolling his head to bush his lips against johns.
“There are lost of holes in a tea strainer, John. That is the point.”
“That’s alright, just... watch where you’re going next time.” He says calmly.
Sherlock age: 16
Sherlock felt his heart hammering in his chest as John lent in towards him. A warm sensation went down Sherlock’s spine, and filled his abdomen as their lips touched. He felt his cock twitch in his trousers. He didn’t have time to think about it before he felt John’s warm, wet tongue slip past his lips. He moaned softly, and opened his mouth to grant John more access. Sherlock was surprising himself at how needy and ready he was for this sort of thing. After that first small taste of the world of ‘shenanigans’, he found himself desperate for more. He moaned when John slipped his hands round his waist, under his ass, and pulled him into his lap. Sherlock was glad he wasn’t the only one who was hard. He could feel John’s lengthy erection through his jeans, brushing between his legs.
I kiss him one last time before exiting, leaving a “caution wet floor” sign behind me as a deterrent.
“He told us to keep him company while he was out.” Irene shrugged.
“Promise me you won’t do this again.”
“What about you?” I ask out of curtesy.
He entered the hall.
“Yeah, we’ll go by after dinner. Thanks again for letting me stay.”
“Hey.”
A few years went by like this, Mycroft and Harriet having a heated discussion in a corner somewhere, and Sherlock and John going to each other’s house between a hole in the fence to play board games. But that all changed when John went to secondary school. He didn’t have as much time for the curly haired girl as he used to. He was allowed out on his own where as Mrs Hudson would have to escort Sherlock. John was allowed to stay up much longer than Sherlock, and spent those hours with Mycroft and Harriet. Their interests also became more varied, John had become interested in girls whereas Sherlock pretty much only ever wanted to play board games. Sherlock hadn’t seen John for a few weeks, until she went to deliver some jam from their peach tree and he answered.
“Since I’ve known you, I always knew you were special. I always knew there was something about you. I haven’t felt this way about anyone else. I guess what I’m trying to say is...” he trailed off, presumably moving his head away from the phone.
“I may have bought myself something while you were distracted.”
“I’m sorry daddy! I had to! You make me so- ah- so horny!” Sherlock sobbed, desperately rutting against the mattress.
“Shall I show you what I do?”
Don’t go too fast, don’t take too much, don’t choke, and for goodness sake be mindful of teeth.
He smirked when he felt Sherlock shiver. He sat back, and looked at the other boy who had turned a deep shade of pink.
The longer I don’t say anything, the worse this is going to get.
“Sherlock...” He groaned softly.
I have no idea what sex shops look like. Did I get it right? 😆
“You’re injured.”
“Indeed. Parents this time. Yourself?”
“In fact, you need to get dressed. Go. Now, please.”
“John is going to kill us.”
“Elevated a little... but I think we can put that down to stress.”
“Shall I do it again?” He teases with a slow roll of his hips, that fucking hell, has me reeling.
I offer her a laugh that’s only half pity.
“Hello, Sherlock.” Rose or whatever said, waving at the brunette.
“Yes, yes I’m fine. Just... thinking.”
“Hang on, you’ve got some on your face.”
“So, what’s the verdict?”
“It may not have been the hair on my head, but it also wasn’t just the hair on my legs.”
They walked up to john’s house, and stepped indoors.
John pulled Sherlock to him by the front of his underwear, holding their bodies flush together. “Trying to distract me from my homework?” John tutted.
Sherlock turned around, and saw a pasty faced boy, and a dark haired girl. He recognised them as Phillip Anderson and Sally Donovan. He continued on his path, and briskly walked away. He knew they were following him. In a battle of wits, Sherlock could beat anyone, no doubt about it, but he was less experienced in the physical kind.
Their foreheads were pressed together, glossy layers of sweat between them, sharing each other’s air as their lungs worked in overdrive.
Thompson was just a boy, his first Christmas at the front. John was used to the hardships of war by now, and he had scars to prove it.
“Sherlock... mmm... mngh...” He groans in to my mouth as he scrunches my shirt in to his fists.
Mycroft startled Sherlock when he lunged across the table so much so that both he and the jam fell to the floor.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and deepened the kiss, swiping his tongue across johns lips.
“Calling Mycroft.”
“Are you going to be quiet?”
“Yes.” Sherlock said flatly as she scanned the crowd of girls.
Hey guys. Hope you are enjoying the story so far. Smut in the next chapter.
“If you think cooperation is going to make this easier on you, you are sorely mistaken.”
“Oh good. Tell him I say hello.”
“Yes sir.” I squeak, adverting my eyes.
“Sherlock, is your brother back yet- oh, hello John.”
“I’m gonna call Mycroft and tell him he might be getting a visitor.” Greg said, then took Rosie with him as he went outside to make the phone call.
“We all know inmates try and get in the way when someone’s date is coming up. Maybe that’s what’s going on here.”
“Up you get. On your back.”
12th of September 1918
“I’ve loved you since we were children. Obviously in a very different way to the way I love you now, but I loved you all the same.”
“Well, That was rather lovely.”
John grinned.
Sherlock age: 16
5th of August 1914
John looked up at her with sad, bloodshot eyes. He patted his knee, and Sherlock carefully climbed into his lap.
“I believe that’s mine.”
Sherlock exhaled a breath of exasperation, and trudged down the hall.
Mycroft smirked at Sherlock.
“John... jo- ah fuck!”
“Yes you do. It’ll have to be quick though. Toast alright?”
“Why don’t you tell me what they are...” Sherlock breathed, running his long fingers down John’s back. “And I just might let you do them.”
“Ah, yes I am familiar with their labs.” He says with a smile as he recalls his time there.
More unintelligible noises escape my throat as I feel my climax building embarrassingly fast.
He doesn’t look too impressed as I push the pillows beneath him.
Now I know how it feels the other way round.
He too, had left love behind.
“How’s this?” I ask in a husky rasp, leaning in to nip at his earlobe.
“Not loud at all, are ya?”
“Hi.”
He kisses me again, his skilful tongue carving out my lips.
“Yes?”
I watch him curiously, watching the way his nose wrinkles a little as he thinks.
Rosie’s eyes went wide, her gaze falling on Sherlock at the mention of his brothers name.
“Mmmm.”
The blond groaned in to Sherlock’s mouth, his pelvis tilting forwards to pin the slighter teen to the counter with his hips. Sherlock moved his hands up to run them through johns hair, tugging softly at the roots.
“I see.” Mrs Holmes smiled as she wiped a bit of dribble that had slipped from the baby’s mouth.
John swallowed audibly then chuckled mirthlessly.
Ten years had passed since the war had begun. John’s night terrors were infrequent now, and if ever he had one, Sherlock was there to sooth him back to sleep. The battle scars were still there, if only now little silver lines.
"Oi, freak! We're talking to you."
“I see that.” Wiggins chimes in from where he’s sat on Mike’s locker.
“Um, I’m gonna walk Rosie home actually, but we’ll go tomorrow ok?”
“Yes, I cant imagine Rosie will want it back.”
P.S thank you for the kudos and comments.
“Why?”
When I pull back, his face contorts in disapproval as he tastes himself on my lips.
“Are you sure you definitely want to?”
It was slow at first as John gripped Sherlock’s hips to settle him in to a rhythm.
She quickly silenced his laughter by pressing her lips to his.
John finally catches on, and realises he has feelings for Sherlock.
Sherlock arrived at school with minutes to spare. John was sitting on a bench, talking to a red headed boy. Sherlock wasn't sure if he aught to approach him, and instead walked right past him.
John positioned the pillow under the small of Sherlock’s back and positioned himself between his long legs.
“It’s nice and cold, and it’s the only place that doesn’t make the room spin.”
He pulled them off, and threw them into a corner before sitting back on his heels, his dripping erection standing stiff between his legs. John walked round to the other side of the bed, and went through the chest of draws. Sherlock inhaled audibly when he saw the red, satin blindfold in johns hand.
“John, can I ask you something?”
“Mmmm...”
Her eyes were empty and vacant as she stared out in front of her, a teacup full of lukewarm tea clasped in her shaking hands.
“It might even be a vibrating one.”
“Are you going to behave?”
“No, it’s fine. I think if you just... keep going I’ll adjust.”
“I might be pissed, but that doesn’t mean I want to hear about my brother’s sex life, or lack there of.” Sherlock stated, his attention going to a stray thread on his top.
We both look up to see Moly has wandered in to the room, Tupperware box of what I think is risotto grasped in her hands.
His lips felt amazing on mine, gentle, but still passionate.
“Are you going to cum?” John husked with another thrust of his hips.
“Thanks for comforting her. I know that’s not really your thing.”
“What about these ones, sherl?”
Sherlock let out a shaky moan at Johns words, his hips snapping forwards.
She could nothing about the aching sadness that pulled at her heart, and punched her in the stomach.
“I have lots of hobbies.”
That all changes when Molly comes out of medical, hair a mess, piles of paper in hand.
“What?”
Johns lips were back on his in an instant, not wanting to be without the wonderful sensation for more than he had to.
“It doesn’t hurt, but it doesn’t exactly feel good either.” Sherlock hissed in discomfort.
He isn’t still though.

John celebrates the birth of his son
Sherlock was about to does off when he caught sight of the clock.
Thompson turned back to face John.
“Get to it.”
“I will!”
I want hard, rough sex. I want to be fucked until I can’t stand. I want to be covered in marks, I want to be sore all over. I want to know his body better than he knows his own, I want him to know my body better than I do.
“We are doing that again.”
“Mmm!” He whimpered when he felt Johns lubed up cock at his entrance.
Johns grey eyes met her baby blues.
JOHN’S POV
But the moment he saw John, it all went away.
He reached out to stroke her cheek.
The boys chatted for a few minutes about homework, up coming tests, and the very interesting gossip that Mycroft had been spotted talking to a girl. To one, not at one. At one would be nothing new. They’d been spotted by James Davidson, a boy in their year, chatting away in a corner. The girl even had her hand on mycroft’s arm apparently. John had seen it on the schools football group chat, and reported back to Sherlock.
As he spoke, John couldn’t help but wonder what his son would look like. Sherlock, himself, a mix of them both...
“Oh really? What were you thinking of that requires more time...?” He drawls as he moves to mouth at the shell of my ear.
“I appreciate how dedicated you are to him, darling. I wish I could stay with him, but my back can’t handle the sofas.”
The officers grin disappeared at Sherlock's words, and was replaced by a look of shock. John, never having heard Sherlock's theory stood and watched in awe.
“John!” He squealed.
“Sherlock, manners. Guests first, dear.” Her mother kindly reminded.
“You doing ok?”
Sherlock comes home for Easter.
29th of June 1917
“You need to get up.”
Tuesday’s grey, and Wednesday, too.
It doesn’t take much more until he’s sputtering a chorus of groans and sobbing out a warning.
Sherlock helped John clear up the plates, then they awkwardly stood in the kitchen as Mrs Watson put some food and a drink on a tray, presumably to take up to Harry.  They moved back into the living room after she went upstairs, and sat down together. John had curled up in the corner of the sofa, and was staring at the wall, his eyes completely glazed over.
Of course it’s true, but even if it wasn’t, I would have confessed as such just to see the smile that appears on his face.
John’s are soft on mine, a contrast to the traces of stubble on his jaw that rub against my cheek. He brings up both hands to cup my face, effectively forcing me to kneel up and turn towards him.
I turn my attention back to the little packet in my hand, and remove the condom from it.
I cannot help myself but thinking of this analogy as I throw my arms around johns neck, pulling him closer.
“Don’t look at me like that.” She said flatly. “It’s more than I can bare.”
I watch him closely for his reaction.
“Oh. Ummm... very small jars of jam? Or one really big jar. Either way, not much jam.”
P.P.S if there’s anything you’d like me to write that I haven’t put on there, I’m open to suggestions.
“Ditto.” John said, quickly picking up his orange juice, hoping the glass would hide his quivering lip.
“Green.”
“15.”
I whip my head up upon hearing his words, and see that he’s smiling, nay, smirking.
That was a mistake, because he wakes up, but he doesn’t make a fuss. Instead, he sits up just a little and wraps his arms around my neck.
Sherlock’s POV
The brunette looked up from the floor and met johns gaze.
He puts his arm forward, and stops my attempted embrace.
“You and I are friends?” Sherlock asked after a moment.
“Hello.” He says once he slips through the door, being sure to close it behind him as quietly as possible.
“You like John.” Mycroft said knowingly, eyeing Sherlock from behind her book.
Mycroft knew Sherlock started the scarf a few months back, but she kept getting distracted, ever the procrastinator.
“Right then, trouble. What have you learnt from today?”
“Mmmm... it was worth it.”
“I know.”
John raised his eyebrows, but didn’t voice how he felt about this, and instead just  re-buttoned his shirt.
“So hard for you.” He groaned, running his hands up Sherlock’s back.
Mycroft Holmes sat with her younger sister for 46 minutes on the platform till she lost her voice from crying out for John.
“John... I need you now.” Sherlock whined, bringing his hand to his lap to palm at himself through his skirt. John turned around at this, and Sherlock quickly removed his hands. John saw what he was doing, but pretended not to notice.
Sherlock began to walk around the room as he spoke. “Orange lipstick? Who wears orange lipstick? Jillian obviously, and one of her male coworkers... do you follow? No of course you don’t.” He quipped before the officer could answer.
Sherlock made a face at him, and tightened his grip round his neck.
Sherlock’s whole body seized up as he felt John shoot his load inside him, just as he asked. So good, so good, there- right there-
John age: 15
“That was amazing.”
She is not wonderful.
“Now what do you three have to say for yourselves?”
“I want to touch you again.”
He’s in his bunk, book on the pillow, his long fingers splayed out over the pages, the digits on his other hand fisted in his dark hair.
They all shared greetings, except Sherlock, who was opposed to meeting new people, as she’d stated many times.
Sherlock shuddered, tilting his head towards John. He nodded bashfully, his cheeks heating up.
Johns father was tall and broad with the same ashy blond as himself.
“She wanted to know where you were. You really need to start telling her things like that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock...”
“More! More!” She cried, her toes curling, fully aware that she had repeated that word numerous times that night.
“You are in labour, I think mother will forgive you for disturbing her beauty sleep.”
The living room floor is adorned with what appear to be origami frogs of various colours.
I give him an affirmative nod before he slides them down.
“Fuuuuck...”
“Oh yeah?”
“In the storage cupboard at a Zumba class that we went to by accident.”
Sherlock arched his hips off the bed as John dragged his tongue down his body.
“I was thinking a busy movie theatre out of town so if we get caught, no one will know us...?”
“Who do you belong to?” John barked.
“This has been a very thrilling day, wouldn’t you agree?”
Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows, but slung his long limbs over johns broad shoulders regardless.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock age: 16
John age: 20
“Love seeing you like this.” John rumbled.
He helped Sherlock off the bed, and pushed him into a kneeling position, his wrists still tied behind his back.
“I’ll do what I can. Be careful. Now, call your mother. She worries.”
Sherlock lay sprawled out on johns toned chest, his sock covered legs wrapped around his hips. He toes off his shoes, and kicked them to the floor. John connected their lips in a heated kiss, his tongue darting in to Sherlock’s mouth. The slighter teen moaned softly as their tongues danced in passion.
People push their friends out of the way of bullets and take them instead. Why? Because they love them?
She looked up in contemplation, then back at Sherlock.
“Just one more shop.” She said with a smirk.
“On the bed.” He ordered, his voice low.
The second I open the wooden impediment, John is pushing me back against the wall and assaulting my lips with avid, concupiscent passion.
John teases Sherlock with some handcuffs.
“Cum for me then.”
Sex. Kissing.
John ran his hands down to the waistband of Sherlock’s jeans, and tried to pull them down.
“I will baby.”
“I’m going to confront him.” He shrugged.
“That’s just something... for you to think about tonight.”
I spin about on my heels, my eyes falling on John about thirty yards from me.
He looked down at the packet in his hands.
He turned on his heel, and continued his path through the battlefield. He guessed he should consider himself lucky. He’d been captured, and interrogated over the last few months. He’d only just got away. He was lucky compared to some. Some didn’t escape at all. He knew he couldn’t think about that now. All that mattered was getting home. Home to Sherlock. He inhaled deeply as he thought of Sherlock. Beautiful Sherlock. Had she changed a lot? What did she look like now? She’d be nearly 16 by now. He knew he’d see her again. He knew he would. With his new found determination, he picked up his pace. The ground beneath his feet held memories of the battles fought there, the air carrying the smell of death. Death was following him as he walked, he knew that. He couldn’t outrun it, so he simply continued walking. As he walked, he called to mind a story Mycroft used to tell. The appointment in Samarra.
“Right, sorry. Keep going?”
Sherlock smirked at Johns reaction, and experimentally stroked his length.
He waited patiently for her response. They were long passed the point of her thinking he was crazy, and asking to sit elsewhere. She knew very well how odd he was.
“Too hungover to argue. Oh my god, I must be dying.”
“What about me?”
I falter for a second before nodding.
SHERLOCK’S POV
She looked up at him with her baby blues, then down at the biscuit, and back again a few times before taking it from him.
“Come on, let us dress you up!” She pleaded.
“Yeah, baby?”
Sherlock was sat in the dining room with Mrs Watson whilst a nurse saw to John’s wounds. Sherlock would have been happy to continue, but Mrs Watson said she couldn’t ask that of her. She didn’t like the nurse. May Darson. Sherlock had never allowed jealousy to affect her, but she found herself glaring daggers at the redhead through the window whenever she pulled up on her bike.
“That good, huh?”
The coffee cup is hot in my hands.
“Careful...” I mumble in to his hair. “Careful not to leave a mark... I have visitation today...”
It only reminds me of earlier when I was cuffed before him, completely at his mercy whilst he pounded in to me.
"What did you say?" John asked, pulling Anderson up by his shirt collar.
As John returned to his room, a thought popped in to his head.
He made sure he did the next phone call.
She slumped back into the chair, her eyes screwed shut. Sherlock giggled at her sister, then found herself gagging, and trying not to throw up.
“Off.” She said definitely, obviously following his thoughts, and guided his hands round to the fastenings.
Cold.
She couldn’t help herself.
“You look beautiful.”
“You’re so big... how am I gonna get your big cock in my little mouth?” He coos, his voice coquettish and sultry.
He looks down at the floor.
“Oh yeah?”
Sherlock chewed the inside of her lip, remembering her mother frantically running around the kitchen before banishing her to the parlour.
“Sailor boyfriend. Saucy.” He mused after a moment, and fell back in to the pillows.
Not only do I want to be in his company for as long as possible, but I feel a strange sense of protectiveness over him. I barely know him, although he apparently knows everything about me.
“He came home just after you got in the shower, and he brought a girl with him!”
Sherlock blushed furiously, and hid his face behind his curls in a fit of giggles.
No one had ever got her something so thoughtful. It truly touched her heart.
I hear john’s breath hitch.
“Do you want a bit?”
He walks us over to the blanket fort, and gently lays us down so that I’m straddling his waist. Without hesitation, I begin grinding my hips down on his length, and I am genuinely concerned that I’m going to cum just from this, untouched.
I lean against the wall as I wait patiently.
Sherlock couldn’t fathom how much this hurt. It felt as though her insides were stabbing themselves with knives.
The movie was alright.
Sherlock locked his knees as he got used to johns weight against him.
“Right, you’re gonna lie down, and I’m going to check your vitals. I don’t think you’ve OD’d, but I’d rather know for sure.”
“Yeah, mum I’m home. Sherlock and I are playing computer games in my room.”
Sherlock made a general noise of disgruntlement as he went to do the towel back up.
"Sherlock, What-"
“Mmm, I like those too. You want them, baby?”
“I’m fine.”
Sherlock squeezed johns hand before getting on the train with the other girls. He waited on the platform to wave her off, watching her train as it departed. Then, he walked home with his head hung, hoping no one noticed the lag in his step, or the tears streaming down his face.
“I love you sooo much.” John grinned as he pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple.
Sorry this is late and kinda short. Hope you enjoy anyway.
There’s something wet touching my skin.
"Oh, Good. Now, what do you two want for breakfast. And no, Sherlock, it is not an option. You're eating it."
Of course he does.
“I love having you like this.” I rumble as I trace a finger down his spine, making him shiver. “My good boy.”
I have to.. have to find...
My hips buck up involuntarily as pleasure overtakes my body.
Jesus Christ, I need him again.
Irene lead the other two girls out into the living space, and to the door. This gave Sherlock time to sort himself out, just in case things went where he was hoping when John came home.
“You are incredibly handsome.”
Sherlock decides to beat John at his own game.
Sherlock exhaled a moan, and started bouncing up and down on John’s cock.
“Oh, sure. I’ll see you out.”
I’m so close, so close, so-
John cast a glance behind him to the photograph of Sherlock on his own wall.
John, slumped on the floor, chest heaving, heart pounding, was cursing himself for letting the little tease get to him.
John came home that afternoon. Sherlock spotted him out the window, and after waiting the two hours her mother instructed be left for them to settle down, she ran out to knock for him. She hadn’t gone through the hole in the fence for a good few months, and hadn’t taken into account her new shape. Then young girl found herself struggling to slip through, the new additions to her chest getting in the way. It had always been a small gap, and John had failed to fit through for years, but it was still a great surprise to Sherlock. In her distress, she’d managed to catch her blouse on a bramble behind her, and was now well and truly stuck. John had spotted the struggling preteen, and run out to help her.
“Congratulations.”
“Thank you.”
“Are you ok? You’re not hurt or anything?”
John was trying his best to focus on her, but it felt so, so good that her voice was more like an echo in the background.
She gripped Johns shoulders, and lifted her hips up to allow him to reach round under her. John could have sworn that in addition to the corset, her clothes were designed to be as difficult as possible to take off.
“It doesn’t necessarily mean he’s dead. Maybe he’s just missing.”
Sherlock felt his cock throb at John’s low, suggestive voice. “You know- mmmm! Why? Mmmnngh...”
His smile continues even after he reconnects our lips and pulls my hips flush against his.
“I think you’re ready now.”
John began to build a rhythm, sinking most of the way in, then pulling almost all the way out. It was torture for Sherlock, Johns cock just missing where he desperately wanted it, needed it.
“You ready?”
She clearly thinks so too, but she doesn’t say anything.
“How would it make you feel if they saw me with my hands in your trousers... getting you off?” Johns voice lapped at his ear, his lips ghosted his neck, and his teeth grazed his skin.
Fuck, it really hurts!
“I love you.”
She flinched back in surprise.
She went back to sleep, only to be awoken again a few hours later.
His mouth is on me now, and oh god it’s taking all of my willpower not to buck my hips up in to his mouth.
John moved his head, and bit down on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Of course. I would never do anything to make you uncomfortable.” John said with a squeeze to Sherlock’s hand.
He tilts his head in a manner that reminds me of a small puppy.
Mycroft faltered for a moment whilst she scanned the garden for her daughter.
“I’m going to make spaghetti. Is that ok with you?”
“Ready?”
His hair his a mess, his eyes are wild, his covered in saliva, only some of which is his.
“Yes. Now off you go. I’d hate to have to punish you prematurely.”
"Come on, I know you punched Anderson in the face. Your knuckles are all bruised."
I swallow thickly as I gaze up at him, meeting his intense, ardent stare.
“I believe that’s mine.”
I grin at the simplicity of John’s words.
3. Are you enjoying the story so far?
“Can I try?”
“It’s ok.”
“John, I... I... need... Agh!”
Sherlock did as he was told, raising his arms above his head so John could pull his shirt off. John was rock hard between his legs, Sherlock’s rocking driving him mad. He attacked Sherlock’s creamy skin with his mouth, sucking and biting, nipping, licking, desire overwhelming him.
It wasn’t until Sherlock started going to secondary that she saw John more often. She walked to and from school with him, and sometimes saw him in the hallways. That was enough for her. She hadn’t made any friends at school, which wasn’t a surprise to anyone. Mycroft and Harriet had both left for university, and only came home during the holidays. The two houses had seen out their days of being family homes, filled with children’s laughter. More often than not, the only thing that filled the Holmes’ dwellings was the sound of Sherlock’s violin.
“Nor I.” Sherlock smiled.
“I’ll go to the post office tomorrow.”
John’s head shot up upon hearing Sherlock’s offer.
Sherlock reached out to touch his hand, and gently squeezed one of his fingers before taking both of their tea cups back through to the kitchen.
My brain goes in to overdrive as I sprint down the halls, my heart pounding in my chest, pounding so I can run, pounding so I can feel fear.
“Just returning some balls.”
“John? Are you alright?”
“You look so cute.” Molly smiled.
“Yes, it’s very- ah! Very good!” Sherlock yelped as John pulled out only to push three fingers inside.
It was good, weird, but good.
He runs his hands up my back as he thrusts his tongue in and out of my mouth.
“Pineapple.” Sherlock grinned coyly as he cleaned himself up.
“Hi.”
She mused, a faint smile playing on her lips.
“Alright, I’ll pick anything then.”
Shit, he’s crying.
John age: 20
“Is He you’re boyfriend?” Rosie asked, not unkindly. She would settle for friends, and wouldn’t intervene.
“These are going to have to be burnt...” he grumbles as he looks down at his trousers with abhorrent distaste.
“You left without saying goodbye!” She said tersely.
When his eyes meet mine, they’ve  changed colour again. Silver.
Falling asleep here is always difficult. Either it’s panic and fear surging through you, the sinking feeling we call loneliness, or it’s the fact that the beds are really uncomfortable.
Sherlock experimentally opened her mouth, opening Johns with it, and slipped her tongue passed his lips. He moaned softly.
“Are you wearing two pairs of underwear?” John asked curiously, pulling back to glance down between them.
“Yes mother.”
“Still think he’s not hammered?”
“That is of course, I am not robbing you of the opportunity, Mrs Holmes.”
“I aught to come to your games more often.” Sherlock mused as he looked down at the small amount of space between them.
“Don’t you need to get back to work... officer?” He teases, pulling me to him by my belt.
I falter for a moment, wondering what to say next. That’s when I realise how new this all is to him. The way he talks, the way people talk to and about him, and of course the record of times he’s been admitted to medical. (I may have checked his records after I walked him back to his cube.) As he sits in front of me, staring up at me intently, I wonder if he’s ever had a friend, or if he’s spent his years alone.
“You haven’t mentioned him much. Is all well?”
“Exactly.”
With this thought in mind, I turn to him and shake my head.
Johns focus was slipping away as he was grasped by the sensations caused by Sherlock’s mouth, the stimulation maddening. He bucked his hips up, ramming his cock down Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock gagged a little, but he didn’t let go. He continued to bob his head non the less, ignoring the tears springing in his eyes. They had an understanding that if Sherlock wasn’t comfortable, and he couldn’t answer with his mouth full, he would use hand signals, or blink repeatedly. John watched him cautiously for his reaction, but he simply looked up at him with wide blue eyes, and carried on moving his mouth, his lips reddened, slick with saliva and pre-cum. John took initiative again, and held Sherlock’s head in place as he began to frantically thrust his hips off the bed.
She fell back on the stairs, and sat there, numb. She ran back up before they could hear her, and collapsed in heap of tears on her bed.
I chuckle before playfully pushing him away.
“No, go on. Open the door looking like a worker who had an accident at the Hartley’s factory.”
I start to laugh, but the look of confusion on his face says that he’s genuine.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at her.
“Mmmmm... I’d love to sweetie... mmm...” John mumbled against Sherlock’s lips.
John’s POV
Sherlock age: 13
John pushed himself all they way forwards this time, his sharp hipbones pressing in to Sherlock’s soft body.
Then, he drags his thumb up a little further, revealing one of my track marks.
The work day comes to an end, and we all round up to be counted before going back inside.
I take up my spot on the floor at the foot of his chair whilst he closes the door.
“Get over here.” John said a little more firmly this time.
“Hello.”
“It doesn’t matter. I love you, and only you. Although, I must say...”
“You sure? You need anything?”
Sherlock nodded, and shuffled in closer to John. He licked the spoon full of raspberry pudding happily.
“Sure.”
He was clearly surprised, but he relaxed after a moment, and started kissing her back.
“You’re very loyal, very quickly.”
Even after she broke up with Jake, and stopped going to the games, she still hung out with the couple. They soon introduced her to Greg, a friend of Johns. He was two years above, so they never really saw him around during class hours, but he played rugby, and had a flat share with Sherlock’s older brother. She soon found herself coming to the games to watch him, and they were dating by the end of the year.
He reconnects our lips again in a sloppy, messy kiss, muffling the quiet whimpers that escape me as he begins to pull out.
Johns lips and teeth attacked his skin, drawing all the blood to the surface. He continued leaving hickeys all down Sherlock’s body, only stopping at his waistband.
“Mol?”
“Why are you watching the Jeremy Kyle show?”
“Well, that’s what you are, aren’t you?”
“Really?” He asked, shuffling closer to Sherlock.
“And I like you.”
Enjoy!
“She does always have supplies.” John said, winking at his blushing boyfriend before jumping out of the chair to go into their shared bedroom. Sherlock and John had been introduced at a party in freshers week by a mutual friend, Mike Stamford, and had started dating after the Christmas holidays. The couple now shared a flat with Rosie, and two other girls, Molly and Irene; the nymphomaniac.
John suddenly broke his gaze, and looked just behind her head.
“I won’t be long.”
Sherlock, as John observed, was now watching Mycroft out of the corner of his eye.
“When we’re at home, i’m going to have you stretch yourself whilst I watch.”
“You’re just lucky Molly has never seen anything.”
As time goes on, Sherlock and I only spend more time together. Sure, it’s only for a few minutes at a time most occasions, but sometimes there are moments when we have free time, and we can sneak away for half an hour or so for our more... intimate activities.
“Ah, no.”
“Yeah, yeah I love you too.”
“Yes.”
I feel petrified.
“Fuck off Harry.”
“Johnathan?”
“Ummm... Sherlock... what the fuck are you doing?”
He’ll start with an accidental run in which will evolve in to a full on physical confrontation, and end with me dragging him away in to the old break room.
“Mmmmm... oh...ah...” Sherlock panted, desperately trying to catch his breath.
John began moving his mouth up and down sherlock’s length, humming gently. The brunette felt a pressure building in his abdomen.
John groaned as he watched Sherlock’s fingers disappear further inside himself.
He bent forwards, and rolled up his pyjama trousers, revealing a strip of bandages tied round his leg. Sherlock slowly unwrapped them, all the while keeping her eyes focused on Johns face. He wasn’t looking at her, instead he was staring off in to space. She paused when she saw the small patch of bloodied gauze. What was underneath was the reason John had come home. She tentatively peeled it back. Just under johns knee cap was a patch of red skin, and there, in the middle, was a bullet wound. Sherlock normally didn’t have a problem with blood, and injuries, and yet found herself frozen to the spot. But it wasn’t the wound itself, it was everything it represented. Something so small had done so much damage, and regardless of its size, John had been shot. For the past three years, he was in a place in which he could be shot; killed. Sherlock tried not to allow her face to show how she was feeling. She chewed her lip between her teeth, and gently dabbed a washing cloth
Only until a lie found itself escaping her.
He’s quick to obey, pulling the cheep polyester garments down to his ankles.
“Yes. By the time I’m finished with it, it’ll be cold enough for him to need it.”
“Yes definitely.” Sherlock said quickly, then grabbed John by the hand, and dragged him into the hall.
He doesn’t seem to mind, in fact he seems very enthused as he gently pushes his tongue passed my lips.
Her mother bit her tongue.
He knew Sherlock was orgasming when he screwed his eyes shut, and howled out Johns name. John watched with hooded eyes as the brunette ejaculated all over himself, semen covering his legs and stomach. John felt shockwaves of pleasure, his muscles spasming, his cock pulsing as he followed. His eyes closed as he emptied his load with a low groan before collapsing on to Sherlock’s cum stained chest.
Sherlock sat as still as she could as Mrs Hudson combed her hair into two pigtails, which tamed it for the most part.
“It’s ok. I’m ok.” I murmur against his lips.
Just as Sherlock said, Mrs Holmes came home at 20:00 on the dot.
John age: 13
He’s followed my gaze straight to the blond guard. “You gay, Holmes?”
“John! I missed you so much!”
John pressed a chaste kiss right on his Cupid’s bow.
“Well then.”
“Oh? What did you sing?”
John couldn’t help but laugh at his boyfriend’s monotonous statement. As usual, Sherlock fell asleep not long after, leaving John plenty of time to get on with his mundane homework.
"So what's the plan, we're just going to run in there, and claim you've solved a murder."
Sherlock’s giggle turned into a groan as John slipped his hands down the front of his briefs.
John smiled as he thought of Sherlock.
“This is like pass the parcel.” Sherlock remarked as she too Lucy and lay her head in her lap and legs on the sofa beside her.
Sherlock.
“How romantic(!)”
“I know.”
“Actually, I’m going to go back home and get changed. Is it alright if I come back?” She asked.
“Thank god.” John sighed.
I help Sherlock to climb off my lap before shuffling over to get the wipes.
Sherlock blushed, burying his face in his hands.
“You saying that is already too many noises, shhh.”
I was right to worry that Sherlock would get home before me.
John age: 20
John was leant against the fridge in his rugby kit, mud on his knees, perspiration dripping from his forehead. If they didn’t have plans, Sherlock would have flashed him the underwear then and there. But instead, he simply walked across the room and flung his arms around johns neck.
As Sherlock looked down at the fair haired child, who reminded Sherlock so much of Mycroft who had been almost blonde in childhood, she couldn’t help but wonder who her child would look like, John or herself.
I don’t say things like that.
His scarlet boxers are tented up around his cock which is desperately straining against the cotton fabric, enticing me.
“This one is for you, Jimmy.”
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
“Alright, I’ve got to get dressed.”
“Hello.”
John wondered what would happen if he spread his fingers in a scissoring manor. Sherlock whined, and bolted upright, his eyes still scrunched shut.
“Fucking hell...” he grumbled as he rolled over to look for his phone.
“What are you doing?” I hear him call behind me as I stalk off down the corridor.
He squirms and moans as I work his cock, sucking it, licking it.
“It’s ok. It’s ok.”
“Alright, That would be the glass shop.”
Sherlock watched him walk down the street till he couldn’t see him anymore.
He wasn’t angry with her because of the secret, he was angry at himself for the secret even existing in the first place.
It was already so good, and he wasn’t even completely sheathed yet.
“Mother invited them over for tea. Perhaps coffee for Harriet.” Sherlock noted, a grin on her face.
“Yeah... I’m... fine...” he murmured between pants.
“Oh fuck...” He groaned when John scissored his fingers inside his channel.
“I’m gonna pull out now, ok?”
He kissed Sherlock till they were both breathless, the. left him with the promise that they’d make out in the storage cupboard at school on Monday.
I close my eyes as I begun to pump my wrist up and down my shaft.
“Mmmm!”
There’s a few other people dotted about the room attending to various tasks, watching television, having a chat.
No, no I have to talk to him. I have to find out.
I’m still on his lap, and when he arches his hips up, I can feel his every outline.
“Is he alive?”
I could get used to hearing him say that... not the time.
John couldn’t help but laugh at the mess his normally genius boyfriend had since become.
It’s definitely hot in here. It’s definitely hot, this bed is uncomfortable, and the polly cotton blend of my vest is very itchy. He places the blood pressure cuff around my wrist. If he takes my pulse, I’m screwed.
He leant in and reconnected their lips before she could answer. He ran his fingers down her abdomen, and began to trace patterns on her pubic bone.
“Is this still ok?”
“No, no, no.” Sherlock blathered, raising his head up. “I want to feel you.”
Sherlock sighed in agreement. If Molly knew what they got up to, she’d have to scrub her brain out with bleach.
“John, are you home?” A woman’s voice called from the hall.
He lined his throbbing cock up with Sherlock’s entrance. He placed his hands on his hips, the band of the panties between their skin. He inhaled deeply, and thrust into him.
John confesses his feelings for Sherlock.
John began pulling Sherlock in to him by his hips, slamming up against him.
“I graduated with honours, and yet I can’t stop this child from crying.”
“I ummm... do you know what we need to do now?” John asks cautiously, gently dragging his fingers down the column of my spine...
Sherlock sat on the sofa till long after dark, locked away in his mind palace, dreaming of John. Although he only had dream John now, on Monday he would spend all day with the real John. His John.
"Alright. May I ask, where did you learn about this stuff?"
“No, Sherlock, not for that. I need a fake girlfriend so mother and father won’t give me a condescending lecture on how I don’t have a real one.”
Sherlock walked over to where John was standing, and pressed his ear to the wall. Two voices. One was Mycroft, and the was indeed a girl.
This time it’s stronger.
John’s lips pulled in to a broad smile.
“I hope my brother is managing to entertain you.”
“Sherlock...”
“What do you think, Sherlock?”
“There’s more. If you want to find out, I suggest you keep undressing me.” Sherlock whispered seductively.
John explored every inch of Sherlock’s mouth, their tongues fighting for dominance. Sherlock could feel heat pooling between his legs, pre-cum dampening the front of his briefs. He pulled away from the kiss for breath, becoming so turned on that he was practically gulping for air. While they were disconnected, Sherlock ran his hands down johns chest, then pulled his shirt off to reveal johns gorgeously toned chest. He dipped his head to press his lips against johns collarbone, making the older boy gasp out a moan. Sherlock moved back up to kiss johns lips again, their teeth gently clacking together.
“When avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes, one learns to be discreet.”
Their bodies were so close, Sherlock could feel Johns heart beating by his shoulder blade, and his warm breath on his neck. He moaned when he felt Johns lips follow, trailing kisses from the sweet spot under his ear down to his collar bone.
“Oh!” He cries out, arching his pelvis up towards me.
We engage in a few more minutes of pointless conversation before the two minute warning.
“I hate alcohol.”
“This might hurt. I’ll be as careful as I can, ok baby?”
This time I do laugh, choosing to ignore the look of bemusement on his face.
“Go try these on. Show us each outfit when you’re done.” Irene said, shoving him into a cubicle.
“I also lost another tooth.” Sherlock said, indicating with her tongue the space where one of her canines had fallen out.
“Can you be fucking off?”
“Cuff me.”
Sherlock hesitated before tearing his eyes away, then shuffled forwards on his knees, and wrapped his lips around johns cock.
“No time.” I order when he starts untying his shoes.
He moved towards Sherlock, only to have the younger boy throw himself into his arms, and crumple in a heap.
Drunk Sherlock was more aloof than sober Sherlock, and she certainly had lowered inhibitions in this state.
Sherlock’s gaze drifted over to the remote in johns hand. “What do you think?”
“It’s ok. Sherlock said cautiously.
John age: 12
As in tune as are we, he seems to get the message, and speeds up. Not only that, but he lands a sharp smack across my bare ass cheeks.
“So.. what actually happened to him?”
“She’s your mother too.” I supply helpfully.
He lets out a quiet moan as I duck my head so I’m in between his legs.
John winked at Irene before going over to Sherlock.
I have to pull away so I don’t choke on the mouthful I’ve already obtained, my eyes watering at the sheer velocity and magnitude of the fluid.
“I would have taken you in my mouth, slow and gentle. I’d work you till you were a thrashing mess, pleading, begging me to let you cum. Then right when you were on the brink, I’d slip my fingers in to your tight, little, virgin hole... and make you cum... and I’d swallow every sweet drop.”
John turned to look at him, and saw that he was dead serious.
I’ve held off my climax for as long as possible, but with Sherlock’s body convulsing around my engorged cock, I can’t contain it anymore.
I’m sure John knows this as I dig my nails in to his shoulders and let out a sharp cry.
I should definitely ask.
Sherlock curled up against johns side, and lay his head on his shoulder, breathing in the exotic smell of John’s body wash.
“An enemy.” The boy smirked, leaning his weight on his umbrella. “If you asked him, he’d probably say his arch enemy. He does love to be dramatic.”
"I thought you liked her?"
“Oohhh...”
“When I tell you to do something, inmate, you will fucking do it.”
He’s pressing his lips up against mine and his hands are tightly gripping my shoulders. It’s one of those kisses where even though it’s sweet and innocent, it’s full of passion. It’s the way every kiss is with that one person...
His pause says otherwise.
“Is it not the fact that I am with you? That it is you who I give myself to?”
“That... you’re so good at that... fucking hell.” John garbled as he ran a hand through his ashy blond hair.
His voice was shaky as he took her hand in his.
“God I missed you.”
“Ah. Well, it’s more fun this way. Now, go try on these!”
John’s comrades learn about Sherlock.
“What should I do with this?”
Sherlock and John locked eyes in a fearful exchange.
Johns was astonished at this, and he would have thought on this a little longer had he nod been immediately distracted by Sherlock biting his lip and drawing it in to her mouth.
Sherlock halted in his tracks when he heard John’s voice. Was he here to gauge the knife further in to his back? Never one to shy away from confrontation, Sherlock turned around to face him.
“You can scream as loudly as you want.”
“Well...” John started, crawling to be by Sherlock’s head.
I catch his lips quirking up in to a smirk out of the corner of my eye.
Sherlock’s POV
That was how they’d ended up collapsed, wrapped in each other’s arms on the sofa.
Mycroft smiled softly, and affectionately squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock was lead into the shop by a very determined Irene, his cheeks pink. The lighting was low, giving it a slightly daunting feel, and the air smelt of incense which made Sherlock’s nose itch. Lining the walls were sex toys, lingerie, handcuffs, whips, everything from fifty shades, red lights in the shelves highlighting the objects.
He placed a chaste kiss on Sherlock’s cheek before dashing out the door, leaving Sherlock to stare after him this time. The brunette picked up his violin again, and allowed the music to flow, his body alive with electricity.
“So no... that won’t work.” He hangs his head in mock sadness.
“Yes, it is.”
“Humour me.”
“She has to be. Otherwise the temptation to put her in the oven would win. How do you suppose Sherlock made it past infancy?”
Hope you guys enjoy!
“Can I go now?”
Sherlock arched his hips as he stretched out.
Watson. It had been a long time since anyone had called him John. He turned his head, and saw the colonel standing beside a boy.
“Where are you getting all this from?” I grin as he nips at the soft skin at the base of my throat.
The adrenaline filling my body does just as good of a job at providing me with courage as I can imagine an alcoholic beverage would do.
“You going with him?”
“I’m flattered.”
“We’re not leaving!”
SHERLOCK’S POV
“Milk?”
He looks so peaceful when he sleeps. I think it’s the only time his mind is ever at rest, the only time he ever stops.
She paused for a moment before returning her gaze to him.
If so, how do I tell her I’m not interested without upsetting her. I can’t tell her I’m seeing someone without inviting questions I can’t answer.
“I know, as am I. But that’s not what I’m worried about. I don’t want to get you pregnant.”
Sherlock responds with a curt ‘yes, sir’, where as Moriarty instead offers me a shit eating grin.
“What about that one? Purple is your colour Sherlock.” Molly said, holding out a purple crop top with little white flowers.
He does have a point. The only thing noteworthy that happened yesterday was one of our fellow inmates thought that super noodles was a television show instead of a brand of dehydrated carbohydrates.
Enjoy! Thanks for the lovely comments, and the prompt for this chapter (Sorry can’t remember who it was)
“Mycroft’s a prick.”
Even though we are now both giggling, it’s still incredibly hot. My legs are wrapped around his waist, his hands are in my hair and his pelvis is pressed right up against mine. I can feel something hard poking in to my thigh and it makes my cheeks flare up.
With that thought in mind, I make a grab for his hand and guide it up towards the slackened elastic waistband that is doing its best to hold my trousers up.
I grin, and lean in to kiss his nose whilst his eyes are cast down.
I should probably speed things up a little, so I push a third finger inside him.
Sherlock begins to realise she hasn’t got much time left to get her shit together.
“Tastes the same- Hey!” Sherlock squeaked when John wiped a dollop of cream on his nose.
The next morning, Sherlock had to be prised out of bed, and his mother dropped him at school to ensure he didn’t run off. He hadn’t said anything about his injuries to his mother, although then he could have blamed the tears on physical pain rather than emotional. He felt his heart wrench when he saw John talking to Rosie a few yards away. John looked up, but quickly looked away after making eye contact. Sherlock walked swiftly through to the bathrooms were he collapsed in one of the stalls, sobs violently wracking his body. It was bad enough just having to deal with his one sided feelings for John, but this was down right unfair. What was John playing at? Maybe he was just like the rest of them. He’d been used before by people who got him to do their homework, but this was worse by a factor of 1000. He walked to his first class, chemistry, still bleary eyed, and sat down at the back.
Tried to make this as real as possible. I think I succeeded... 😬
“Have fun.”
“Does that sound like a good idea?”
“Computer games? That’s slang I’ve never heard.” Sherlock chuckled.
John nodded. He felt relieved that his mother at least supported him. He moved closer to her and rested his head on her shoulder.
Mr and Mrs Watson bid them both goodnight, then left them alone in the dark.
Sherlock swivelled on the bed so he had his back to John. He felt him unlock his left wrist, but not his right.
“Sure.”
I quickly run my fingers back over his rim to make sure he is loose enough before positioning myself between his legs.
My erection is blatantly obvious at this point.
She heard him laugh on the other end.
I’ve never given a blowjob.
“Come on then.”
So here I lie, alone. Alone, locked in solitary confinement. Well, that is generally what is meant by solitary confinement. It is a special gift to be alone surrounded by people...
“How comes your over here?”
Fucks sake Sherlock.
“I fantasise about you too.” He breathed heavily by Sherlock’s ear.
SHERLOCK’S POV
“Irene, this isn’t what it looks like...” John begins.
Sherlock giggled, and fell against johns shoulder.
“Thank you. For the cookies.” He said, wanting to change the subject.
“Compared to yesterday it is.”
“I am under the table.”
Thank you so much for the comments and suggestions! Hope you enjoy this, smut in the next chapter... and their ‘first time’ at some point... 😆
By the third, he was in a fair amount of discomfort. He was very overstimulated, and fairly exhausted. His upper thighs were coated with white, sticky fluid, some of it solidifying in a most unpleasant manner. He tried to wriggle his wrists out of the restraints, but it was to no success.
I keep kissing him as I move my hand up his thigh, and gingerly allow my fingers to touch his length. His breath hitches and his body twitches underneath me.
“Fucking do it again!” Sherlock exclaimed, bringing both hands up to cup johns face and pull him in to a sloppy kiss.
“I’ve got supplies from the kitchen. Do you want to prepare yourself?”
“No.” Replied the brunette, his voice deep and strained. “Maybe this will teach you to pay better- oh fuck- attention...”
His hands were shaking too.
“You’re always welcome to stay with me if things at home get too... unpleasant.”
“He’s been watching for you out the window.”
“Perhaps. We ought to arrange something for them.”
When he does eventually speak, his voice is strained and thick with sleep.
He vigorously shakes his head at me as I come to sit beside him.
"I've wanted to hit you for so long. For all the times you've made me feel stupid!" Anderson yelled.
John removed the blindfolds after a moment, followed by the cuffs.
Then there are his lips, which make every nerve in my mouth tingle, not in an unpleasant way, more analogous to that equivalent sensation of eating ice cream.
He was fed up of guessing, and just wanted an answer by this point. He was unable to look John in the eye as he waited for a reply.
“I assume Sherlock has informed you of the rules. No male visitors, I’m afraid. There will be plenty of opportunity for me to spend time with her then. You take her dear.”
He smiles coyly at me, his bottom lip drawn between his teeth.
“Are you crying?”
John took a scoop of the vanilla frosting, and smeared it across Sherlock’s cheeks.
“Hey guys.”
It was true, Sherlock didn’t want the jam. But it was no longer a container of preserved fruits. It was now a means with which to torture his brother.
1. Sherlock in kitten ears
“Are you ok?” Mycroft asked.
“Do you want me to hold her so you can get up?”
Oh god, oh god.
Sherlock felt pleasure course through him at John’s praise, his cock pulsing in his jeans. He hadn’t paid much attention to his own arousal, too focused on pleasing John. Apparently, John hadn’t missed a beat, and after pulling his pants back up, began sliding his hands up Sherlock’s thighs. John attached their lips in a heated kiss, thrusting his tongue in and out of Sherlock’s mouth. The brunette allowed John to roll him backwards into the pillows, and cover his lithe body with his muscular one. That’s when they heard the door open.
“Get your pants off then.”
“I understand completely. You are entirely forgiven.”
“A little weak in the knees, but yes.”
“Ok.”
John chewed the inside of his cheek.
If he didn’t sound so desperate, and look to be in agony, John probably would have enjoyed seeing his boyfriend cuffed to the bed frame.
Maybe John would never come home.
“Agh! Oh god!” Sherlock cried, tugging hard at John’s hair when he brushed against his prostate. He whined when he felt John pull his fingers out.
“What do they normally say?”
It’s nice having him look after me.
“Who’s this, darling?” She asked, gesturing to Sherlock, who was sat on the sofa, trying to take up as little space as possible.
Sherlock tutted, and rolled his shoulders.
“Are you Alright?”
“Did my mother send you?”
“No, no it’s fine, love. Tea?”
Sherlock eventually reappeared, sans the jam, and slumped down in the chair next to John.
“You’ll have to borrow a pair of Sherlock’s pyjamas, although they will be a bit big. I can pop your stuff in the wash over night if you drop it downstairs.” Mrs Holmes said as she rummaged through Sherlock’s draws.
Mycroft nodded, and left down the hallway.
The blond gasped out a groan almost immediately, his eyes fluttering shut. On occasion, he had been known to experiment with his fingers, sometimes even a dildo similar to this one. It was a fun thing to try.  He paused his plunging motion, and opened his eyes to look over at Sherlock. He knew the brunette could take a lot more than he could. And he took it so well, too. John grinned to himself as he watched Sherlock push a third finger inside himself with a moan. As much as Sherlock wanted to watch, he was distracted by his own pleasure as he worked himself further open.
He grins and nods.
“So what happened to you this time?”
Enjoy! Thanks for the comments! :)
“Jake Smith. He’s the one shouting at the ref.” She sighed. “I’m Rosie.” She extended her hand to the lanky teenager.
He put the violin down, and sat down in a chair at the back of the room.
“Off.” John barked, pointing down at Sherlock’s briefs.
John used his left hand to stroke his cock while continuing to use the cat with the other.
John reached over to his bedside table, and grabbed a condom from the draw.
John couldn’t help but smirk to himself as he watched Sherlock squirming, one seat over, one row in front, knowing all the while that he was the reason. It was extremely hot. He knew very well what he’d be fantasising about tonight.
“Well, I’d better go and get our new toys then.”
Mycroft and Mrs Holmes shared a glance, questioning sherlock’s judgement with their eyes.
God, I love him so much.
God, doing drugs is a terrible idea.
Sherlock was all grins and giggles as he looked himself over in the mirror.
Thanks for the comments and kudos! 💖
“Sherlock...” he groaned low in his throat, his hand going out to rest on the back of his dark curled head.
He turned his head, and pressed a sloppy kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock hints at his issues with authority while he and knight in shining armour, John, play doctor.
Hi guys! Just some questions for ya.
She was four months gone now, and each day that passed, was another day that John wasn’t home to experience it with her.
“You have some...”
His hands are on my hips, pulling me in to him again, and oh god, I just want more of him, I want all of him.
“Blimey, you look so grown up. I didn’t recognise you.”
Sherlock got up, and grabbed the jam from the counter. He sat back down with it, and went back to staring at his phone.
“Come on then.”
‘Wake me up when September ends’
He grimaces.
John noticed she was more rigid than normal when they sat down.
“It’s no problem.” John shrugs, leaning his weight back in the chair.
“13 months. Well, 11 now. Maybe less with good behaviour, but I think we can both agree that isn’t going to happen.”
"I wouldn't say a complete idiot-"
Sherlock guessed an older girl, and a boy not much older than herself.
“Ok, mother.”
His eyes were wide, his lips slightly parted.
“Yes.” He said quietly.
“Of course I waited.”
Sherlock grinned as John pressed a kiss to his cheek.
“Tea?”
“We buy our... stuff... online.” Sherlock said, awkwardly shuffling his feet.
“Bit wobbly.”
Ok... what am I going to think about...?
“I’m alright.” She whimpered, rubbing her knee where a dark bruise was already forming.
John age: 20
“John... I- ah!”
“I just don’t want you to regret having done it here.”
Outside, I see John.
“What can I say? I missed you.”
He couldn’t help let out a low groan, his teeth clenching.
“Well, that’s not what people normally say.”
He looked well rested. There were still bags under his eyes, but he looked rather refreshed. Sherlock’s eyes drifted down to his left hand which was spasming.
John sighed as he did his trousers up. “Why?”
I grimace as it washes down my throat.
She’s here to ask something of him, probably a favour.
At this, I have one of those oh so caricature like ‘lightbulb’ moments.
He smiles against my lips, then breaks away chuckling.
He doesn’t look to enthused, but he nods his head all the same.
Sherlock nodded earnestly. John grabbed his wrist, and pulled him down in to his lap.
The phone call that told him he had a son.
Normally he’d scold Sherlock for being demanding, but he was so desperate, so horny, he couldn’t hold off any longer. If Sherlock was ready, there was nothing stopping him. He picked up his pace, thrusting deeper and harder in to Sherlock’s channel.
The nurse who was normally timid and quiet was shouting commands at Sherlock, her voice fierce and demanding and she screamed for her to push.
His mother looked up to him, her eyes bloodshot, tears flowing freely down her face.
“Yes. Yes, I’m fine.”
“I don’t mind. Actually, it’s quite nice to know I have this effect on you. I know you do on me...”
John would be back to know his child.
“I’m going to take a shower. I feel like crap.”
Sherlock lifted his hips, rubbing his pelvis against johns groin. He was hard as a rock. John pulled off the jumper that he didn’t remember giving Sherlock permission to borrow, and threw it behind him. He gripped Sherlock’s wrists, and pinned them above his head.
“Please...” He whined, not caring how desperate and needy he sounded.
“Good boy. I’m just going to stretch you first, ok?”
John had been away traveling around Wales and Scotland for the entire summer, which left Sherlock plenty of time for her chemistry experiments. She’d also taken up interest in scrap booking, and had kept track of the things she’d done that summer. She doubted it was as interesting as johns. The only real thing that had happened to her was a huge growth spurt, and she’d started to develop curves. That was hardly something worth telling John. Mycroft had been at home, causing her usual nonsense. The peculiar child had turned into a rather beautiful young lady, having grown into her sharp features. She now wore cream lace gloves, a hat, and carried an umbrella when she went out. The corset she wore beneath her blouse hardly had any effect on her immaculate posture, and her high heals only made her seem more frightening. It was often a concern of Mrs Holmes that she would never find husbands for her daughters. Sherlock would put them off with her lack of a filter, and Mycroft would scare them away.
Mrs Watson smiled.
“Ok, I have to go and start my shift in the warehouse. I’ll see you tonight though, if I can.”
“How would biting you help?”
“You do know there’s a lab you can use at uni?” John murmured against his soft skin.
Sherlock causes drama on April fools. John doesn’t do pranks, but he sure knows how to get him back.
John gasped loudly as he came hard into Sherlock’s mouth, shooting ropes of hot cum down his throat. Sherlock swallowed as much as he could but some of it trickled down his chin. He looked up at John as he coyly licked his lips. John groaned deep in his throat, his eyes wide, chest heaving. After he caught his breath, he pulled Sherlock up from the floor, his fingers under his chin, and sat him back on the bed.
“Yes. Yes, I do.”
John took both her hands in his, and began to dance. They frolicked around the floor with the other pairs, laughter filling the room.
