Castiel led them toward a spiraling metal staircase in the corner, expending a small amount of energy to stabilize the warped steps as he went.
“You’re the best friend I’ve ever had. No one has ever stood by me the way that you have, not even close—not even Sam.” Dean sounded almost surprised by that thought, but quickly continued before Cas could cut in. “You don’t pull any punches with me, which is good because I’m full of shit half the time, but you’re also actually
“Dean, this is my fault. I know I’ve already cost you too much, and I want you to know that all I want is to help with Chuck, and then I’ll never bother you again,” he took a deep breath. “I’m sorry Dean, I can’t make it up to you, but I’ll do everything to help now, and I don’t expect you to forgive me.”
Cas was passed out but breathing steadily. His head rested on Dean’s shoulder, and Dean idly swept the hair from his forehead.
“Stop. Leave him out of this,” he growled uselessly. The Entity would torment him as it pleased, his protests would likely only spur it on further.
“Dean—” Sam started, clearly getting ready to play mediator. Castiel felt a twinge of sympathy for him. It had been over a decade of Sam acting as a buffer between them.
After all that Cas had done for him, everything they’d been through, those were the last words he’d said to him. He hadn’t even realized that it was already too late, that the angel had already sacrificed himself, that there was no more room for begging, no more time to talk Cas out of it. Just saying those three words had sealed Cas’ fate. That was Cas’ true happiness? Cas loved him so much that just saying it, just letting himself feel it was enough complete his deal with the Empty, and Dean had given him nothing in return, and now never could.
He’d had very few moments since being plucked from the Empty to think about anything other than the Great Work, as the angels called it, or as Jack had called it, “Heaven 2.0.”
Despite Dean’s concerns, by the time the man was asleep in Castiel’s arms, still sticky with sweat and smelling sinfully divine, Castiel was certain that no human on earth could compare to Dean Winchester. It was lucky, really, that he hadn’t truly understood what he was missing, or the last several years would have been even more torturous. The sounds Dean had made when he came undone in Castiel’s mouth while his finger teased into him, his
In the Men of Letters bunker, Dean was dead. Yupp, definitely dead. The good kind of dead, where you just float off into unconsciousness and there’s no heaven to replay your greatest hits or hell to screw you over with them. He wasn’t sure he could have a conscious thought if he tried.
“If you insist,” Castiel replied dryly. “She did give me her number the last time we were down there.”
. Jack needed him, if not to help with Heaven than to make sure that Jack would indeed continue to exist at all. He could hardly ask Jack to stay and than leave himself. And he
Jack sat by Michael, both outlined by the daylight seeping through the closed curtains, while Sam crashed on the bed farthest from the door, boots and jacket still on. They figured an unexpected wakeup could be on the menu.
“Hey, while you’re at it, mind finishing up the dishes?” Dean called behind him as they headed out the door, leaving Sam to sputter indignantly behind them.
“Sam, move,” Castiel ordered, shoving the weeping man roughly to the side. There would be time for a happier reunion later.
“You’re saying this is why Jack was able to take Chuck’s power in the first place. Because he’d already left it vulnerable,” Dean commented.
. Jack was gone, and I couldn’t even save his body, I had to burn the demon out of him and leave him, nothing but a smoldering mass of charcoal in the depths of hell itself,” Castiel closed his eyes, willing the visual away, the stench of burning flesh suddenly lingering in the air.  “And you,” Castiel swallowed. “Even if I’d wanted to lean on you through any of it, all I had was your contempt. It was the first time I ever truly felt that you
… but that was nothing that Castiel himself hadn’t said directly to Dean’s face multiple times before that. That it was all for Dean, everything he had done. And Dean had never so much as acknowledged it. Perhaps it had always been too much.
) and tended to stand close enough that there sleeves would brush. Now he was standing with nearly two feet between them, a normal distance for anyone else but nearly unprecedented for them. Dean felt his high spirit from earlier deflate slightly. Maybe Cas was regretting rushing into this thing with him and was trying to signal that without having to say it.
“You will too, you know,” Dean murmured softly. “Have support. You could hang up the blade for good.”
Death turned to regard Jack with a perceptive gaze. “You’re a very curious being. You’ve gone through a tremendous change recently. It’s altered your capabilities substantially.”
was, all of what creation was. Castiel could now only comprehend it as an endless sea, all colour to represent the things that words couldn’t. Now, he found himself alone in his mind, and it was his own voice, channeled through his vessel that his thoughts rang out in.
“I guess I never told you enough how much I need you. I tried, but I think I used the wrong words. It’s just you, man, not the things you do for us, though I owe you about a hundred more
Dean couldn't deny that this nerdy guy was more interesting than he had originally thought. Dean wouldn't tell him that he thought his lifestyle of travel was incredible, that maybe he could show him more of Seattle, or even the west coast, if he'd let him. Right now, he was trapped in a stare that might as well be seeing straight into his soul, and he didn't mind one bit.
Cas blushed, smiling slightly at Charlie's approval, before frowning at the thought that this could be over and it would be on him. "I suppose I'll sleep on it and talk to Dean in the morning."
Letting his head roll back in pleasure, he gasped and moaned through the rhythmic pumping of Dean's hand, the gentle licking of his tongue. He wasn't going to push Dean to do more than he wanted, but he needed more. Slowly, Cas began pushing his hips, fucking himself up into Dean's hand. He felt Dean's breath in a short puff against his dick as he pulled his mouth away to watch. Cas glanced down then, eyes going wide as he watched Dean stroking himself with one hand while Cas slowly fucked himself into the other.
"Let him get a drink in first, he has to loosen up a bit. But that looked to me like he knew what he wants." Balthazar made a quick glance to the bar, then reached up to tousle Cas's hair, and quickly undo the top buttons on his shirt. Gabe snickered across the booth, rolling his eyes as he took a swig of his drink. "You two are absurd," he chuckled.
Dean chuckled, letting his other hand slowly release Cas's shirt, much to his disappointment. "Weirdly enough, I only live about 4 blocks that way," he pointed over his shoulder, "So I think I'll take Balthazar's advice and walk to cool myself off."
The waitress makes her way to them, and Balthazar orders a round of drinks called Mojo for the three of them. As expected, they are a fruity and vibrant blue, served in a glass shaped like a large vial with a silver metal straw. A sweet blue raspberry flavor with strong enough alcohol content to have you squinting your eyes with each sip. After the third of which Cas decides it actually tastes pretty good.
"CAS" Charlie's voice broke through his ramble, "Hey man, slow down. I'll be at your place in twenty."
"Sammy?" He gasped, emotions welling up as his brother met him with a grin. He all but ran to him, pulling him into the tight squeeze he reserved for Sam alone. "What are you doing here?"
Cas didn't expect to hear from Dean for the rest of the weekend. On Saturday he had woken up feeling content, went on a quick run before the clouds had a chance to roll in, and made plans to spend the say with Balthazar. Balthazar had insisted he continue his services as Cas's coach through his process, and so they did some shopping, some Seattle exploring, and some socializing.
He watched as Dean tensed for a moment before turning around, eyeing him over the rim of his mug. Cas made sure to hold his gaze.
Dean accompanied Charlie on her round of mingling, receiving many excited greetings. Apparently, all of the employees adored him. Gabe mentioned that everyone had been a little put off by his few days of 'dicky behavior,' but they were glad he was back to his social and charming self. Nobody commented on how Cas had been the cause of the negative attitude shift, and he was grateful.
Cas couldn't help but stare. Dean looked fantastic in just about anything, a suit at work or casual clothes when they'd gone out, but Cas mused that this look had to be his favorite. He was leaning back against the far counter in the kitchen, arms crossed over his bare chest, gray sweats hanging low over his hips. His hair was a little unruly from a quick towel dry, cheeks still a little pink from the heat of the shower. Cas found himself thinking Dean bumming around in the kitchen was something he could get used to. Dean doing anything was something Cas wanted more of.
"I'm free almost any night of the week." Cas rumbled at him, slowly reaching out to touch Dean's arm. Apparently he couldn't read the signs at all.
Thanks again for all your kind words and kudos, even when I'm slow to update. You are all so, SO appreciated!
tickling his ear before Cas stepped away. He would be back here tomorrow night to pick Cas up. The rest of the way to his own apartment, Dean smiled to himself.
Just the thought made his heart race. Did he want to move things forward with this guy? In the short few weeks they had known each other, and even shorter time they spent getting to
Dean's brows furrowed as he considered Cas, nibbling slightly on his lip. His hand slid down Cas's arm to brush their knuckles together. "You could stay… if you want.." He mumbled.
Cas looked up as a sudden hush came over the café, followed by low murmurs and a few girlish giggles. He smirked, closing his book and raising an eyebrow at the handsome man standing near the register.
"Dean, this place is amazing. I mean, I've seen Guatemala before, but this little mountain valley is incredible! The altitude makes the temperature change between night and day kind of severe, and then the cloud cover adds to that, and it makes the soil and the plants here have all these unique characteristics! I feel like every day I find something new. And the coffee, dude, it's awesome." Dean smiled, hearing the enthusiasm in his little brother's voice. The giant nerd.
"Well, Mr. Winchester, don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything, anything at all, I can do for you." Cas said, turning and strolling back to his desk.
A few more shaky breaths and he feels like he can pull himself back together again. For now, at least, until they get back to the bunker and he can lock himself away.
Dean's own cock twitched, wanted release after getting so worked up, but Dean ignored it. "Do you want me to…" he trailed off, raising his eyebrows at Cas. He could take care of himself later if Cas wanted out.
Thursday morning came, and Cas left Dean his coffee and morning work as was becoming normal. He was greeted with a smile and a quiet "good morning, sunshine", causing Cas's cheeks to flush, as Dean strolled to his office. Before he shut his door behind him, however, he paused, and Cas turned to see what was wrong. Dean was standing in the doorway, hand idly fondling the door knob while he furrowed his eyebrows in thought. Cas glanced back out to the office floor, and it seemed nobody else had noticed this change of routine. Cas narrowed his eyes and turned back to Dean, who was now turned back around, watching him.
"That is perfectly fine with me, Dean." He said with a smile, slowing down as they approached his door.
But there was just the one thing still whispering at the back of Cas's mind after these couple months.
"I could think of a better one," he smirked, giving himself just enough time to watch Dean's eyes grow wide and cheeks turns dark red, before he pushed back from the bar and walked back to the table.
"Dean this was a very unique experience. I hope I didn't intrude, but I did enjoy myself and thank you for inviting me." He smiled up at Dean through his dark lashes.
Sam laughed again, "Well, I hope he actually does some good worked, not just getting you worked up."
Left alone to feel his cheeks flush, he decides Dean fucking Winchester needs to be more of a boss and less of the charismatic friendly face people around the office seem to see him as. No more mister nice Dean he thinks as he exhales. He sets his jaw, elevator doors opening to the seventh floor office penthouse, and steps out.
"Well, Mr. Winchester, don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything, anything at all, I can do for you." Cas supplied, maintaining his smug smile all the way back to his desk. He plopped down, sipping at his coffee before starting to make it look like he was doing some important work while he waited for Dean to return to his office.
Dean watched him still, and Cas began to think this had been a mistake, when he cleared his throat. "Yeah man, you're good. Don't forget to skip on the coffee tomorrow." he beamed, poking fun that made Cas blush a little more.
He squeezes his eyes shut one last time before raising his head and looking out to the street, and feels his breath punch out of him as his eyes meet squinting blue.
Cas glanced at it, nothing more than instinct upon seeing an illuminated screen, but froze instantly.
Cas felt like he was in heaven. Cloud nine, living in a dream, all that. The more time he spent with Dean, the more he felt like they had known each other for years. It was just
He took out his phone, thumbing through his message threads and pausing over Benny's. He wasn't even sure why. Part of him wanted to erase the messages, delete the contact, block the number. Part of him wanted to call him up and scream, he had ruined his ability to trust anyone, to put his all into a person without being afraid. Part of him wanted to see what he was up to, ask him to swing by and relieve some of this tension coursing through him. Instead, he scrolled up to Charlie's messages.
Cas broke the kiss, nuzzling his was along Dean's jaw before finding his earlobe and sucking gently, "I want you, Dean" he whispered.
do is project yourself into it. You wouldn’t be fully there exactly, so it wouldn’t break the metaphysical boundaries of the plane.”
“Thank you.” It came out soft and sincere, and it wasn’t what he meant to say, although he had no idea what he should have said in its place.
said that we’re family, that we’re like brothers. This doesn’t make sense, I don’t want you doing this to yourself just to make me happy.”
Dean rushed over to the table where Sam stood, sorting through what ingredients they had, what they’d need more of. Sam helped, though he kept throwing Dean looks of concern.
for him, even. He’d led a tragic life. It was no surprise that for those he allowed access into the more intimate parts of his life, letting them go was a struggle. Dean was loyal, and he prized loyalty in turn. This was why, sometimes, when he let his guard down just a bit, he could tell Castiel that he was important to him. He’d been loyal, and Dean needed that. So Castiel had given it.
Dean lifted his head at last, his eyes bright, and shot Castiel a wolfish grin, “Buddy, you ain’t seen nothing yet,” and he caught Castiel’s smiling lips in a searing kiss.
“Yes, for now. But you shouldn’t have to. I do need your help, but regardless of my decision, you’ll eventually need to make yours.”
“Uh, yea,” he said instead. “World’s not ending anymore, figured there’s at least six years of spring cleaning to catch up on.” He watched as Cas pulled down two mugs and set them in front of the machine.
Cas paused. This day had been so much fun, doing almost nothing with Dean. Who knows what tomorrow would bring, but he was eager to find out.
She swatted at him, "Oh whatever, you'll come out eventually", waggling her eyebrows at her double entendre.
Dean went for his neck, and now, exposed chest, sucking and biting harder in places Cas's shirt would cover. He stroked them both slowly at first, but as Cas began to crumble again, he sped up. Cas was no longer trying to stifle his noises of pleasure, he hands finding purchase on Dean's hips. Dean could feel himself getting close, and judging by the way Cas was beginning to shake, so was he. He pulled back, giving himself room to watch as Cas fell apart in his hands.
Letting his head fall into his hands he let out a groan. He had screwed up big time if what he was realizing now was true, and there was probably even more to it than that. He could understand now why Dean hadn't explained himself, it probably hurt him too much. And with Cas, well, he was doing it all over again. But Cas had no ulterior motives, no secrets, he just wanted Dean. He felt a lump forming in his throat at the thought of never being able to express that to him again. What the hell was he supposed to do now?
He quickly typed out a reply to Balthazar and went back to his book. Ironically, the rain had followed him down the coast, as if tell him he couldn't just run away from this. He was parked along the water, curled up in the passenger seat with the window cracked listening to the waves and the soft beat of rain on the car. He thought about the way the rain sounded through Dean's windows at night.
He sighed, knowing full well this would happen eventually. He curled forward, letting his chin rest on his knees. "Sure." he murmured.
A small smile tugged at Cas's lips as it became evident that his tough guy boss was, in fact, not so tough.
Friday morning came, and with nerves one fire Cas set out to enact the plan he and Balthazar had cooked up earlier in the week. He had to get to the office early, before anyone else, including Dean, was there. Stowing his backpack out of sight under his desk, he slipped around the corner to where the coffee brewers were. From there, Cas could peek around the corner and ensure Dean made his way to his office after his Friday morning run. He was fidgeting, about to just call it quits from being so anxious, when he heard the ding of the elevator.
"Yeah, okay definitely." Dean managed a small smile, then turned to grab the bartender, ordering another whiskey. Cas watched him as he took a sip, closing his eyes as the burn slid down his throat. When he opened them again, his expression had changed. A confident grin tugged at his lips as he eyed Cas with the same intensity he had been given. Cas was suddenly very interested in this little game they were playing. Dean arched an eyebrow at him, "You know, the last time someone looked at me like that, I got laid." He sipped again, smug smile on his face.
"I didn't realize you had a car! But nah, I made sure this was all walkable, if that's okay." He turned, leading Cas back down the street. He tucked away the road trip idea for a couple months down the road if things worked out. He hoped they did.
it had started so intensely physical we just kind of fell into each other. But with Cas well, I don't know. I definitely want it to be physical but I think I want more, too. But, what if…" he trailed off, casting his eyes down now.
"Um, well.." Charlie hesitated, "Well he just hasn’t shown up yet," she said, hurrying to add the 'yet' in hopes of lifting Dean's spirits. It didn't work.
Cas was still trying to get himself on board with whatever it was that he and Dean had going. They're conversation over lunch had him leaning toward something with the potential to become more serious, but the way Dean acted afterward, in front of Charlie and Sam, made Cas feel like maybe this was something better kept quiet. Mixed signals aside, Cas was one hundred percent sure he wanted Dean either way.
Once inside the door, his brain began to scream for a hot shower. Normally that wasn't an issue, but now he had this maddeningly attractive and soaking wet man shivering next to him.
"Either we stop this for the night, or I won't be able to control myself. Fuck," he ran his free hand through his hair, lust blown eyes never leaving Cas's. "Fuck," he whispered again, biting his lip, breaking eye contact for just a second to glance at Cas's lips, Cas's door, and back to his eyes.
So instead, he sat staring blankly at his phone in an empty café at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon. He was acutely aware of the barista glancing over at him every few seconds, probably because he had come in and sat down without ordering anything, and was now just sitting there in silence. With a long exhale he hauled himself up and walked to the register.
His thoughts, and consequently their staring contest, were interrupted by the waitress clearing her throat, eyes darting back and forth between them. She smiled coyly, sliding the check onto the table before snagging their empty dishes with a wink. Cas ducked his head, but Dean saw his cheeks turn the same color pink as his own as he threw down the company credit card and tried to look literally anywhere else.
"Yeah," was all Dean managed to breathe out. Cas smirked, breaking eye contact to take his new drink and thank the bartender. He was satisfied with Dean's reaction, and eager to see what else he could get away with.
"Let me get us some coffee." Dean suggested softly, quickly brushing his hand over Cas's in hopes of comforting the man a little. It was beginning to make Dean equally as nervous.
He turned to see Dean beaming, knowing full well what he was thinking about Cas getting off, and frowned at him. He shooed Dean from the counter, turning exasperatedly back to his coworkers, who were all watching with knowing smirks on their faces. He rolled his eyes, finishing up his shift trying to ignore Dean’s eyes on his from the lobby.
A million thoughts raced through his head as he sat, Dean getting himself organized. What had he done wrong? Dean had seemed relatively friendly literally moments ago. Maybe somebody had said something about him? Or something about Balthazar? Color quickly flooded back into his cheeks at the thought, and he lifted his eyes from his knees to the green ones watching him from across the desk. Dean smiled.
At this, Balthazar looks up, abruptly cutting off the conversation with one look as Charlie nears the table. Quietly, he turns to Cas and says, "This little chat will have to continue at a later time." Cas narrows his eyes, wanting to know more, but Balthazar turns then to the approaching Charlie and grins, welcoming her into the booth. He sends Cas another quick glance, urging him to drop it for now.
Squeezing his eyes tighter he recalled that Aaron had disclosed the leak had been a one man job, but their conversation was cut off when Charlie joined their booth. Pieces of conversation started making their way back into his memory, and with a gasp, Cas opened his eyes wide at the ceiling.
As it turns out, the levee was already starting to crack. Dean holds it together long enough to make sure Sam and Eileen have gotten into the diner before he heaves out a shaking sob. He raises a hand up over his eyes, pressing his fingers against his eyelids in hopes of slowing the stream of tears but it’s no use. He wonders how he is supposed to live the rest of his life like this, how he is just supposed to move on and accept Cas’s sacrifice when he deserved to be here celebrating with them.
After their date to Pike's Place, Cas had volunteered to walk Dean home for a change, and was treated to an impromptu make out session on Dean's couch before heading home for the night. He had wanted to stay, and got the feeling Dean wanted him to also, but he wanted to take this slow for now, even if it meant going backwards a little. He made a quiet promise to himself to stay a little longer next time.
He could feel Cas smirking as Dean whimpered, and he could feel Cas's hand slip from his hip to find his dick, stroking him as he sucked and licked, Dean not able to hold back from moaning and writhing in Cas's grip.
Dean unwrapped an arm and slid it down to take Cas's hand, guiding him to wrap around his dick, then wrapping his own hand around Cas. Stroking each other, their mouths met with soft gasps. Cas's free hand wrapped around Dean's back to keep him steady, pull him impossibly closer, as Dean's free fingers tangled their way into the hair at the back of Cas's neck. Between kisses escaped quiet moans, the occasional whimper, and the shudder of breath as they worked each other closer to the edge.
Balthazar rolls his eyes, "Oh call him Dean. Not to his face of course, unless he says you can. Nobody calls him Mr. Winchester." He pauses to sip his drink, "But the big mean boss thing has been recent. We think it has to do with the whole 'scandal' thing" he finishes, waving his hand dramatically when he says 'scandal.'
Dean cleared his throat, "I hope you're not one of those vegans. I didn't account for much other than carnivore when I picked this place."
"I'm not sure if you'd like to, uh, come in or not. I mean I'd like it if you did, but I wouldn't be upset if you didn't want to. Well, no, I would be upset but I-" Dean's hand closing around his wrist stopped him, and he looked over to meet green eyes.
Dean’s face is turned up toward the sun, his eyes closed, feeling the warmth against his skin. He’s trying to focus on just that, not what comes next or what they’ve just accomplished, not what is so obviously missing from this victory.
The Winchester's took a step back to let Cas inside and a tense silence ensued. Sam, glancing between the two men standing before him without looking at each other, decided to break it first.
The Winchester Roasters Café crew was still adjusting to having their CEO stop in so frequently. Cas was still getting used to his female coworkers drooling over how hot that CEO was.
Exhausting as the day had been, Cas had gotten to see a lot of his neighborhood, realizing he was a few short blocks from the Winchester Roasters he had walked past with Dean on their way to lunch.
The staring contest incident at lunch the day before had been… something. Dean had gotten lost in his head, and those eyes, and wanted to know more about the man they belonged to. He had spent the entire second half of his day yesterday distracted, and he knew he just needed someone quick to sleep with to ease the tension, but at the same time, he didn't want it gone. There was something almost electric between them; the waitress had seen it yesterday, and it seemed that Balthazar was catching on, too. Was it something to pursue, or something to put an end to?
assistant thing, maybe he was more accustomed to some tiny little thing in a short skirt taking up residence outside his office, maybe he didn't like not having the eye candy, the options…
With his free hand, Dean tugged Cas's boxers lower to completely expose him before dipping in with his mouth. Cas craned his neck, eyes straining as he watched Dean turn his head to mouth at his dick while his hand continued working him slowly. He whimpered, wanting Dean to take him in fully, wanting to flip them over and take Dean himself. Instead, he let himself be pleasured, watching through hooded eyes as Dean dipped to give a hesitant lick to his balls before letting his tongue trail up this length.
He shook his head, expelling negative thoughts and setting his mind straight. He was here to have fun and see where that got him. With a deep breath, he undid the buttons at the top of his light blue button down (Balthazar said it made his eyes shine like ice in the sun), and ran his fingers through his hair, taking a seat in Dean's desk chair. Eyes glued to the bathroom door, he waited for the shower to turn off.
Sam ducked his head, and Dean was sure they were both equally unsure how to start. "I just want to make sure you're okay, man." Sam said, lifting his eyes back to Dean's.
"Or, you know," Dean said, quieter, "you don’t have to. It's whatever. Charlie had mentioned you were really passionate about the whole com-"
After a few more doses of Mojo, Cas felt much more at ease with his new coworkers. They had swapped stories of office mayhem, travel, and the occasional reference to last year's holiday party without further explanation. Balthazar discovered Cas's rental was not far from his apartment and so they decided to catch an Uber back together.
Pulling himself together, Cas made a decision. It wasn't like this job would last forever, and what better time to get out than right now, when you've been sleeping with the boss and it turned out you meant nothing to him. As he threw some clothes into a bag, he pushed down the thoughts of watching sunsets and getting caught in the rain and let the ones of Dean gaping at him as if he didn't owe him any explanations take full reign. Double checking the lock on the door, he made his way to his car. He'd be back when he found his next gig to collect the rest of his things, but for now he just needed to get out.
"I want you to stay" Dean blurted out, eyes looking anywhere but at Cas as he continued to chew on his lip.
Hours later, Dean showed up exasperated at Cas's desk. "Come to lunch with me," he didn’t ask, but his eyes were pleading. How could Cas continue this blatant torture?
"Oh no, no, by all means, continue!" Dean said with a wave of his hand, "This is the perfect time, when I'm wide awake and fully attentive."
Playful tone gone, Sam sighed, "Dean relationships aren't meant to be compared. Benny and Cas, they came at different parts of your life and you have been a different person with each of them. Benny was a dick, we all know it, and I wish that you hadn't been hurt by that, but you have to look at what it did to make you better. And, you are better."
So when Monday rolled around, he had made up his mind to not make this into more than what it was, fun. Cas gave him a quick glance, accompanied by a deep blush and a smile as he had walked into his office. He wasn't sure if Cas was the kiss and tell type, and so making any obvious advances in the office was out of the question. He did make more frequent trips outside of his private office than he needed to, however. Cas was, once again, wearing a slim fitting button down and slacks that hugged him in all the right places. His hair was a little unruly, but his eyes their usual breathtaking blue. He had caught Dean checking him out at least once, and met Dean's slightly embarrassed gaze with the raising of an eyebrow. After lunch, on Dean's third unnecessary trip to the brewing counter, his thoughts were interrupted by a deliciously rumbling voice behind him.
He let his mind slide slowly through the events of the day before, fast forwarding through his awkward encounter with his boss, and slowing down to appreciate the lighting and giddy feeling of their conversation later in the afternoon, smiling to himself. He got to the point where Aaron was giving him the details of the information leak scandal, and tripped up a little bit.
Dean needed to release some of this pent up tension or he was going to lose it. He toyed with the idea of relieving himself in his private bathroom, but why would he do that when the source of his frustration was just outside his door?
"Cas," Came Dean's voice, "If it's not too much trouble, could you grab me a cup of coffee?" Cas could hear the smile in his voice.
Naturally, everyone around the tasting table was turned, looking for the source of the sudden commotion. Balthazar was sporting an ear to ear grin.
They had chatted briefly on the walk over, Dean pointing things out to Cas along the way, including the nearest Winchester Roasters café to the office and apparently, Cas's apartment. It happened to be the one Dean frequented on the weekends, or times when he needed to get work done outside of the office environment. He'd spent many hours there when sitting at his desk proved to be a little too painful to get any work done.
Climbing back into his car, he dialed the number, putting it on speaker and pulled back out onto the road. He had barely registered he had been holding his breath when Dean's voice came over the line, breathy and concerned.
He took a deep breath and shook his head. Letting the tingle in his nerves settle as he focused on getting his work started for the day, he dialed Sam's number and set his mind to work.
A slightly too hard nibble at his collar made him refocus, and he made a decision. He pulled Cas's hips hard into his, fitting against him and causing Cas to breathe a downright filthy moan into his neck. He nudged at Cas's cheek, bringing his face up to catch his mouth in a kiss, and forced them back till Cas's bumped Dean's desk. Now, it was Dean's turn to explore, and he continue to push himself into Cas as he mouthed his was along his jaw line and down his neck. He shifted his hips once more, just slightly, to line up their not so subtle boners, and began to grind into Cas.
Cas took the coffee gratefully, wrapping his fingers around the warm mug, "Like the dead" he mumbled, and Dean appreciated that Cas's morning voice had even more of a rumble to it than usual.
"Uh, I guess you could say that." Cas shifted his weight back and forth between feet, looking down, "Did Charlie not mention that part of my resume?"
Then, Dean's hands were at his shoulders, pushing gently. He felt his stomach drop as he stepped back. Dean didn't want this.
Dean was pleasantly surprised when he woke to the sun breaking through the clouds. It was nice to go on a run that didn't include a random rain shower, and so he arrived at the office in good spirits.
Cas had spent the day checking over his shoulder, making sure Mr. Winchester was not looming behind him with a soul piercing, green eyed glare. Every once in a while, he looked up to see another office employee watching him with an amused grin. The clock seemed to slow down with each hour that passed. Fridays were apparently slow, nobody wanting to bother the CEO so close to the weekend. At this point, downing a couple drinks sounded more and more appealing. Anything to push the embarrassment out of his head, and make less obvious the flush that rushed to his cheeks every time he thought about it.
"You have poured every piece of yourself into your work since he left, and it doesn't matter why, because look what has come out of it! We have grown as a company, and a family and a team because of you Dean. Maybe you closed yourself off for a while, sure, but Cas came along and was able to get through to you. And you
They had chatted briefly over text on Sunday, making tentative plans to spend a day together next weekend. On Monday, Cas left a note on Dean's desk with his coffee:
he thought, turning his gaze to his awakening computer screen. Seconds later, his door opened and shut, and be looked up to see Charlie glaring, arms crossed over her chest.
Balthazar cleared his throat, not one to be ignored "Well, Cassie, the few of us will be finding a happy hour later, and I would love for you to join us. Maybe you'll be more inclined to share with something fruity in you." He said with a wink before turning to whisk Gabe away to the elevators.
That's what Dean had let himself believe anyway, but a couple hours and quiet a few beers later, they were stumbling through the door of Dean's hotel room, desperate to make up for lost time, to gain closure maybe, to take out all the pent up emotions that had been bubbling under their skin. Dean wasn't sure if the relationship he had with Benny had been real or just another means of getting information, but this felt pretty real. Dean could give him nothing else, and so maybe what he wanted this time was Dean.
He really had enjoyed himself last night. It had , obviously, been a while since he'd gone out drinking. Despite his hangover, he was glad to have spent time getting to know the team outside of the office.
For a moment they stood in silence, Charlie not entirely done with her pep talk and Dean not done with repressing his feelings.
"Dean" Cas's voice came out ragged, wrecked by the perfect, quiet intimacy of the moment, thoughts liquifying as he felt himself tumble into orgasm,
After a quick rinse, he exchanged running clothes for business attire, and made his way out to the floor brewing station. As he fixed himself a cup of coffee, a cheerful voice called to him. "Hello boss!" Dean turned to see Balthazar striding toward him, his face split by its usual grin.
He reached up, slowly, to wrap his hand around the back of Dean's neck, and pulled him in. This time he let their lips slide together slowly, feeling Dean's hands fist into the front of his shirt. He gently nudged Dean's lips apart with his tongue, smiling as Dean let out a soft moan. Cas knew he had to restrain himself or he would be pulling the man in through the door without a second thought. Dean nibbled gently on Cas's lip, taking his turn to follow his teeth with his tongue. They stayed there wrapped up in each other, slowly exploring what they could of each other, before Dean pulled away with a soft gasp.
Cas had to feel it too. There was no way any of that, at the restaurant or in his office, had been an accident. The way he
Cas chuckled, pushing him away to make his way to the shower, pointedly ignoring Dean's sounds of protest from behind him. He paused in the doorway, turning back to Dean as he began to undo his shirt, and arched his eyebrow, "Are you coming or not?"
Dean chuckled, running his hand through his hair before turning to Cas. "You're right, definitely inappropriate, but not unwelcome." He raised his eyebrows in question, trying to figure out where this was going.
"I'm still working on that. They seem open to the idea, but are worried about their supply meeting our demand. I've been trying to explain the limited edition idea, but they're worried it'll stress the coffee trees to death. Apparently that's a real thing." Sam replied, his optimism seeping into his words. "But I will have an answer for you by the end of the week, definitely. So now, Charlie said you found a new assistant?"
. He felt guilty, betrayed, hurt and angry. They were best friends, this was his life's work, and for someone so close to him to do this, to use him-
"Oh, yes. It's nice to be reminded what being warm and dry feels like." Balthazar laughed, pouring his own cup. "But the weekend doesn't start till the office gets to happy hour! Will you be joining us tonight?" He asked casually, raising an eyebrow.
"Dean," he said, glancing over to enjoy the way Dean reacted to him saying his name, "I know the comments I made earlier were not exactly appropriate to say to my boss, and I apologize… I just couldn't help myself."
Cas's heart beat a little faster as they walked and Dean didn't pull his hand away. He was talking about something, the pacific north west lacking in ocean views, but Cas was watching the way he moved his free hand when he spoke, the way his eyebrows shifted restlessly into various facial expressions, the way his hair blew in the slight breeze. The way he claimed he knew what Cas might like to do in his spare time, and how he wanted to be a part of it.
The sudden scratch of chair legs against the floor brought him back, and he realized he was staring at an empty chair, as Cas moved around him to head for the door. He jumped, surging after him, leaving his untouched mug of coffee on the table.
Finally they broke apart, gasping and holding each other. Cas's cheeks were deliciously flushed, his eyes glowing against the bright pink.
They stood there grinning at each other for a moment, then Cas leaned forward to catch Dean's lips in his. He let them linger, and Dean could feel the twitch of a smile, before he pulled away and reached for the door.
"Alright alright, just poking fun. I'll get back to you about the farm before the end of the week, okay?" Dean could still hear the smile in Sam's voice, but he didn't press it.
He's not sure how long he sat there in thought after Charlie left, staring blankly at the closed door.
Charlie steps up beside him, "Balthazar is our newest addition to the PR team, and a fun source of entertainment for the whole office." This earns some chuckles from the rest of the room, as Balthazar rolls his eyes.
Dean cut in, "Yeah he, uh, came to keep me company…" he trailed off, eyes lowering as he rubbed the back of his head.
"I think we could have a lot of fun together," Dean mused, and Cas felt himself growing warm, "I would like to have some fun with you," he paused, giving Cas another once over, "But I also think you're an interesting guy, and I don't want to rush into anything that you aren't ready for."
As they waited for the check, Dean looked up at Cas, thoughtful. "So, actually, this afternoon I'm supposed to have a sampling of a new coffee Sam has been researching. Uh, usually, it's just Charlie and I, and Sam if he can make it home, but if you're interested, maybe you can join us?"
anything about the 'L' word. He flopped down on the couch, pinching his nose between his fingers. Doesn't matter if he was ready, this needed to come out now.
He cleared his throat, “I’ll take a… tall, dark, and handsome”, Dean replied, wiggling his eyebrows.
Balthazar knew Cas wasn't exactly a social butterfly, and so they went through a few hours of working flirty body language into Cas's every day vocabulary. Lots of smirking, eye contact - but also let the eyes wander- and push personal space boundaries.
him, as if you knew deep down you should. If you feel as strongly about him as you think you do, without comparing him to your past relationships, I think you deserve to trust yourself and let yourself have this."
It was well past midnight, but Dean was wide awake. When he had gotten back to his apartment, he popped open a beer and sat in the dark at his kitchen table, mulling the evenings events over in his head. Going into this, he had planned for something to snap between him and Cas, but he never thought it actually
"I'm still trying to get acquainted with the area, and the office, but I am enjoying the work." Cas replied, his usual rolling thunder voice raised to be heard over the noise of the Friday afternoon crowd.
The thought scared him, but not as much as the thought of just letting Cas go. Taking a breath, he typed out a quick message to Cas, then threw his phone to the bed and headed for the shower.
"Ta-da!" Dean exclaimed, gesturing widely with his arms in presentation. Cas smiled up at him, but even he could feel it was weak. His head wasn't here anymore, enjoying a quiet night in with Dean, but yelling at the back of his mind to jump ship.
As he let this rediscovered information settle in, he also tried to process what this meant for him.
Cas tried not to appear any level of smug as he made his way out of the building, waving his usual goodbyes to Donna and anyone else he happened by. Naturally, he hadn't quite made it to the front doors before Balthazar's boom stopped him.
Dean froze, the anger and paranoia bubbling in his gut. What was this? What was he doing? He promised himself he wouldn’t do this ever again and now here he was, on the verge of talking about feelings with what, his secretary? Again? He felt his mouth opening and closing, trying to decide on what to say next. He could end this right now, save himself the embarrassment of the world eventually finding out again, of having to explain himself, of Benny coming forward and costing him his job. Was this worth it? Hell if he knew. A tiny voice at the back of his head screamed that Cas meant happiness, but what was happiness if he lost everything he had worked so hard for. For his damn
He stopped himself, squeezing his eyes shut and taking a deep breath. Cas was nothing like Benny. What he had with Cas was nowhere near similar, it was so remarkably different and Dean was happy for the first time in a long time. Even if they hadn’t put a label on themselves, he wanted to keep this thing going.
Balthazar paused for a moment, interpreting, before his eyes went wide. "Oh why yes I would love to grab a drink with you!" He said, all but dragging Cas out of the building.
It was difficult to be bad at something like secretarial work. It was fairly simple, and he enjoyed the job. Taking calls, writing out emails, keeping things organized, and a personal favorite, putting people on hold. But perhaps the best thing about finding the work so effortless was that he could do it anywhere. And so he did.
"Mr. Winchester," Cas greeted him with a smirk, "I would hate for you to be away from your desk any more often than necessary. If you need me to bring you in more coffee I would be glad to do it."
The diner door jingles behind him and he turns as Sam passes him a to-go container of pie. Sam is beaming, checking his phone every couple seconds to see how close Eileen is.
and not think about you waiting outside the door the entire time" he took a step closer, into Dean's personal space, "you have much stronger will power than I." Cas threw his shirt to the ground and caught Dean's lips in one swift movement, backing him up against the nearest wall.
"So most department head's have a desk up here to be closer to Mr. Winchester if they need it, but usually prefer to hang around their department's on the other floors. Balthazar is just the floor below, but the PR manager, Gabriel, can usually be found up here." She gestures then at the desk they're passing, a bowl of candy nestled between a laptop and a stack of papers.
Cas beamed at him, pulling the door shut and locking it behind him. "Are we traveling by foot or would you like me to drive?" He responded, and Dean's mind flashed to long drives with the windows down, Cas behind the wheel.
"I'm happy here, Dean," he whispered, his voice low and gravely from pleasure as he continued where he left off earlier, "I've never wanted to stay anywhere before, but I'm happy I stayed with you." He planted small kisses on Dean's cheek, Dean's soft whimpers only propelling him forward. "I love you, Dean Winchester, you make me happy, you're the reason I stayed."
He typed, letting out a slow breath and putting his phone face down on his desk to avoid what he knew would be the answer. That had been something, it was almost tangible in the space between them. For heaven's sake, the waitress had even noticed.
"Thanks Sammy" he said, voice a little gruff with the threat of breaking. He wasn't ready to lose Cas, or any of this, but he was damn ready to fight for it should he have to.
Holding him at arms length, Dean searched his face until he caught Cas's eyes. "Hey, whoa, slow down there cowboy." He flashes Cas a reassuring grin. "Can we talk for a sec?"
Neither of them had ever expected to be where they were in life. Dean had known he would probably inherit the company somewhere down the line, but turning it into what it was today was never something he expected. With his father, John, as CEO, the chain shops had been common enough in bigger cities. With Sam and Dean holding the reins now, they had managed to modernize the company, growing it into one of the most sought after business models in the world. Of course, they would never have been able to do it if their dad hadn't taught them everything before he passed. Dean hoped he would be proud of what they had made, and how much they loved it.
The paranoia in his gut reached full strength and he realized he was more worried about losing Cas than the world finding out his deep dark secrets. He hadn't explained anything to Cas at all, and now he was walking away and clearly didn't want anything to do with Dean anymore.
"If it means you staying local I can call their manager and pretty much give you the job right now. I know it's none of my business, but dammit Castiel, even if he's an idiot sometimes, he needs you. He's been a mess, please just call him. I won't say anything about the job, that we spoke at all." she paused, "Unless that isn't what you want."
It was a normal question, but Dean felt the heat spring to his cheeks, "Well, uh, yeah I mean, I would usually, but.. If you, you know, I can wait till you.. Do whatever.." He rubbed the back of his neck, looking away from the eyes that were slowly narrowing at him.
He sighed again. He loved this job, loved the people, but he couldn't keep working under Dean, whether things worked out or not. "I don't think it would be in mine or Dean's best interest for me to stay, Charlie." he could hear the sadness in his voice, but he had known from the start this wasn't going to last forever.
Dean had turned to look at him, his little brother speaking these words of wisdom, and it dawned on him just how grown up they both had become. He hoped their parents would be proud, despite the mistakes and the setbacks they'd had along the way.
He had gone out for drinks with the team Friday afternoon as usual, trying his best not to stare (more like gawk) at Castiel every chance he got. The guy was reverberating confidence, happiness even, his usual furrowed brow replaced with a soft smile for the whole evening. Dean managed to coax him outside to steal a few kisses. Dean wanted more, to take him home, to leave everyone else, but he was going to be patient with this one.
Cas could hear the mumble of voices on the other side of the door and hesitated. He'd take any excuse for a few more minutes to figure out what he was even going to say. He fidgeted, biting his lip and flexing his fist before finally taking a deep breath and knocking.
Cas had started at the front desk of the local library in his small hometown as a Summer job. He found he had a natural knack for keeping things in order, for talking to people, offering direction or advice, and so he kept the job through the rest of high school. College had never appealed to him, so he took his talents and traveled with them. One letter of recommendation to the next, he had picked up jobs in vet clinics, doctor’s offices, car dealerships, anything he could find really, and he traveled, staying in places for as long or as little as he pleased. He had been beach side, had stayed in the mountains, spent time in bigger cities, until he found himself heading for Seattle, Washington.
he thought, testing the nickname in his mind. "I don't know Charlie, depends how the rest of the day goes. If it's anything like this morning, I might be so emotionally drained I'll sleep through the weekend." He flung a dramatic arm over his eyes with a grin.
Dean slowly gathered himself, downing the rest of his whiskey while deciding his next move. Cas had left the ball in his court, so he could leave, or keep playing. He definitely wanted to keep playing. He grabbed another drink, switching to beer, and wandered back to the table. Cas was leaning against the booth next to Charlie, leaving space for Dean to do the same opposite them, next to Gabe.
Still stunned, Cas reached over to grab Dean's fidgeting hands, and only then did he look up to meet Cas's gaze.
"Dean, this isn’t about them. I don’t care what happened, I just want to know why he's still talking to you." Cas said slowly, pausing before he continued, his eyes back down on the table, "I just want to know if this is what I thought it was."
"Welp," Charlie said, "This was fun! See you guys later." She gathered up the French press and scurried out of the office, leaving Dean suddenly too warm and all alone with Cas. As the door clicked shut, Cas reached his hand out to touch Dean's arm.
"Well it has been a pleasure to meet you Cassie. From one new guy to the next, just call if you need anything!."
He thought about what to say to Dean, if he decided to talk to him again. He knew he would, it was childish to just disappear like this, but he needed time. After this past month or so he had really started to feel something for the man, started to think about Seattle being more permanent, about
At that, the elevator doors opened, as Charlie came skidding around the corner. "Guys! Hey!" They stepped out as she continued, "Guys, I'm sorry, I got dragged into something kind of important and I want to see it finished before I take lunch. I was just coming up to tell you." She jutted out her bottom lip, pulling a flawless puppy dog eyed pout.
So, Dean had a date. He didn't tell anyone, not Charlie or Sam, not a single person. Let everyone talk as they will, but this was his little slice of joy he wanted to keep to himself.
"Well," Balthazar said, "I'll be seeing you later then," and he turned, still smirking, heading back to the elevators, leaving Dean all but sputtering next to his assistant. Cas was watching him with a smile, seeming to enjoy the way Dean's face was growing a shade of soft pink. He squirmed a little under the gaze, and wondered if this was what Cas had been feeling when he all but corned him yesterday afternoon.
It was Dean's turn to glare now, the only way he could think to handle his discomfort with this topic, even if nobody else was around to hear the conversation.
He hesitated, not wanting to read further into this then he should, but his stomach still being in knots said otherwise.
He was just stepping out the door when he felt a hand on his arm and froze. He turned to Dean, who was standing just behind him, making the hair on the back of his neck tingle. Dean seemed to be particularly focused on Cas's eyes as he spoke.
"Um, hello. I, uh, just wanted to see if there was anything else I could do for you before I headed home." Most days, Cas kind of just waited until everyone else started clearing out to take his own leave, but since he and Dean were on better terms he figured some communication couldn't hurt.
He made no moves to leave the office for the rest of the day after this morning's incident. On Fridays, Dean would run the blocks to work rather than going to the gym. It was a nice way to start his weekend, and gave him the little burst of adrenaline to get through the day. His office had a nice ensuite bathroom, equipped with a small shower and closet. Sam had told him that before the company bought the building, the top floor was intended to be a penthouse suite. Plumbing already in place, they decided to make use of it when the plans changed to an office suite. Dean took full advantage, despite Sam telling him it was 'weird' to shower at work. It had never been an issue. Well, before today it hadn't.
"You better make a move before he decides to bolt," she said bluntly, and Cas's eyes widened in shock.
Pushing himself harder on the run back to his place, he contemplated his next move. He couldn't bear the thought of Cas feeling the way he had felt. He wanted Cas to know that it was a misunderstanding, that he was wrong for never telling him, that he wanted him back, permanently if he could.
It's been two months since Cas moved out of his studio and into Dean's place, and a little more than that since he'd cleared out his desk at the office in favor of working behind the counter in the café. Like most things in his life as of recent, this job was very new to him, and he loved every minute of it. Dean was still pouty about him not being directly outside his office every day, but Cas felt living together made up for it.
He started up his computer, setting up to type out an email to Sam, and took another swig of the quickly cooling dark roast. As his computer blinked to life, Dean mulled over the idea of going to say something to Castiel. He just couldn't bring himself to make more of a scene for the guy after what Dean is sure Balthazar put him through earlier. Whatever, the guy was probably over it. Just a little mishap, no harm done, they could get on with their lives.
Cas sighed, knowing exactly how Dean was feeling. "Do you need to call an Uber home? I could invite you inside while you wait…" he said with a smirk, raising an eyebrow suggestively.
being more permanent. Stupid, since he hadn't really known him after all. Why wouldn't Dean just talk to him? Open up about his past and they could go from there. It was like bringing Benny up had fried Dean's senses. If this had just been some fuck buddy that Dean had said a little bit too much too, well, who cares? Shit happened sometimes, there was no reason for Dean to get so emotional…
This guy could play nerdy secretary, but when he got in this mood, he was a whole different animal. Dean couldn't get enough.
"I still don't like having to wait all day to kiss you," Dean growled, "But damn do you smell good when you walk out of that place."
Dean seemed to relax at that, letting his eyes meet Cas's again. Cas refused to acknowledge the tiny rumble of butterflies in his stomach. "Awesome," Dean grinned, "If you had nothing planned for your lunch today, there's some good spots not far. I could ask Charlie to join, she thinks you're awesome too. Okay, yeah, I'll just uh pop out there a little later then."
of the shower" he mused, shoving the fries in his mouth. He had a lazy grin on his face, and Charlie definitely noticed.
Dean vaguely remembered they were at his place, and so he shook his head to clear his foggy thoughts, pushing himself from the wall in search of towels.
Cas's face flushed and he cast his eyes back down. "I um, some of the other employees were talking and…" he trailed off. Dean's jaw tightened as soon as the sentence was out of Cas's mouth, his eyes no longer soft and inquiring but hardened.  Why the fuck couldn't people keep their mouths shut.
Should he go say something? Apologize, or tell him not to worry about it? How was the guy supposed to know, anyway? He kicked himself a little, knowing full well that had he been his usually friendly self this week, this could probably have been avoided. After all, the guy was just trying to be nice. He was probably trying to offer the coffee as a olive branch for a tension Dean himself had started. Maybe being this stern guy wasn't the best course of action. Castiel was his personal assistant, they should at least be kind of friendly, right?
By Friday morning, Cas had made up his mind to do some light digging, and maybe a little brown nosing. He made sure to get to the office early, nodding a friendly hello to everyone else that had the same idea. While they clustered around the usual tables discussing plans for the weekend- tasting tables, he had learned - Cas wandered to the floor brewing station and began fixing a cup of the piping hot dark roast for Mr. Winchester. It had been a long week, and what better way to start his boss's weekend then with a cup ready for him to get right to work.
The three sat down in the tasting corner, settling into comfy armchairs surrounding a small coffee table. Charlie had set up a French press with the new blend, accompanied by a plate of chocolate chip muffins and some mugs. Usually Sam was here to guide them through this process, but today they were going to Facetime with him instead. Dean's stomach lurched as he considered that this would be the first time Sam 'met' Cas, and as it currently was with Charlie, bringing Cas here would raise some questions.
The first few minutes of the walk were filled with an apprehensive air. Cas wanted to get to know Dean more, he didn't want to just bring him home and have his way with him. Well he did, very badly in fact, but he could feel something more going on here. They needed to probably talk about this, but for right now Cas was enjoying the small smirks and glances they were trading as they headed away from the Friday night crowds and into more residential areas.
Later that evening, sitting at a dive bar in Portland, his phone went off. A phone call from Dean. He let it ring, already a couple drinks in and in absolutely no state to deal with this.
He had been eyeing the bartender, as well as the couple of ladies sitting at a high top on the other side of the bar, and man were they eyeing him back.
"I'll be fine, thanks," Cas said, hesitating by the door, "I'll um, talk to you later." And he bolted, without giving Dean a chance to respond.
Dean figured it was best to just jump into this. "Hey so Cas is here with Charlie and me, I asked him to sit in on this tasting, hope that's cool."
"Mr. Winchester" a voice like a deep rumble of thunder came across the line, "your - uh - the other Mr. Winchester -uh, Sam, is on the line for you. Shall I patch him through?"
By the time 5pm rolled around, Cas was itching to get out of the office. He was probably over thinking, but it felt like he was getting more glances in his direction than usual. He wondered just how secret Dean's past relationship had been if this was the way people were reacting to them simply going out to lunch. The weather had turned into something slightly more pleasant, and Cas was hoping to clear his head with a run before more clouds rolled in.
"Benny is…" she trailed off, struggling to find the right words, "Kind of lacking in empathy. When everything happened, we found out that the Benny we knew wasn't who we had thought, and he was actually selfish and uncaring. That hit Dean especially hard since… you know… but everyone else felt it too. We were all friends and he had just been… lying." She paused, her eyes distant as she recalled her memories of Benny.
Exhaling, Dean turned to look out the window. After the initial leak of company trade secrets, Benny had directly contacted him to confess, but also bribe him. He had told him everything, his plan from day one, coming in to be a mole and sell any information to the highest bidder. What was never a part of his plan, however, was the secret relationship he had started with his boss. Despite the way they felt about each other, their positions made it difficult to bring the relationship to light without causing a scandal. Instead, a different kind of scandal had come out of the whole thing. Benny was smart and had directly contacted Dean because he knew he couldn't let his reputation be tarnished. He couldn't admit to the world that he, the CEO of Winchester Roasters had been the one to give up so much of that information under the guise of love. Benny had dealt a blow to the company, sure, but they could recover. If other businesses utilized their trade secrets, so be it, they would never be the same company, they couldn't compete.
His cheeks flushed a little and he cast his eyes down, but Cas was quick, catching his chin and lifting it back to let their eyes meet. He smiled, "Well, thank you. I enjoy spending time with you too." He chanced a glance at Dean's lips, which were quirked up in a smile, then glanced around. He could tell Dean was apprehensive about their PDA in crowded places, but here they were almost alone…
At this, Dean's eyes popped open, cheeks a deeper red than they were a moment before, and Cas slowed to a stop as they searched each others faces.
"Yes?" His office phone was a private line, anyone calling needing to  first get patched through by his-
"I apologize for driving you crazy," he said, his voice coming out, if it was even possible, raspier than usual.
Dean woke wrapped up in Castiel. For a minute he let himself take in all the little details. Cas's lips, dry and pink, parted slightly exhaling little puffs of breath, his cheeks rosy with sleep, hair sticking up in every direction. As Dean stirred, Cas rolled onto his back, nestling into the pillow without ever opening his eyes.
"I don't want him to ever feel that way" he whispered, his voice cracking. He cast hopeful eyes toward the desk outside again, but still found it empty.
Already having exchanged a few emails and phone calls with the HQ hiring manager, he made his way from his rental studio to the office building for a face to face interview. If this didn’t work out, he was confident he could find something else, but he wasn’t about to pass up the chance for an unlimited supply of the coffee that kept him going day by day. Cas had been frequenting Winchester Roasters since he was in high school, and it was one of the only constants he had as he traveled state to state, town to town. With his odd secretary jobs funding his addiction, there was no better way to bring his passions together.
"What? No!" Dean cut him off, "No I'm actually enjoying kind of rediscovering this place with you. I haven't really spent time doing this stuff since I was a kid, really. I used to come here all the time, I don't even know why I stopped…" he trailed off for a moment, eyes unfocused as Cas watched him slip into his memories. He shook his head, turning back to Cas, "I like showing you. I enjoy spending time with you."
Benny was never one to be put in an awkward situation. He could make any topic, not matter how tense or hurtful, into a lighthearted conversation.
He figured maybe jumping into this fire was the easiest way to get over the fear of being burned. Dean wasn't trying to recreate his relationship with Benny, but he needed to get past all the crap he associated with it if he wanted things to move forward with Cas.
"I appreciate your input Cas," he had said, just loud enough that anyone pretending not to listen could hear it, "I'll think it over and I'll get back to you before the end of the week." Dean had caught his eye and winked at him then, before wishing him a safe home.
"Dean," Cas cut him off, "Yes. Yes, absolutely yes. It would be an honor." Dean smiled, looking away to take care of the bill to hide it. "But Charlie wasn't supposed to tell you what a giant nerd I am," he added, getting a chuckle out of Dean.
She shook her head, glancing back through the frosted glass at the empty chair. "Have you heard from him?"
Dean's eagerness to care for him stung a little, as Cas couldn't fathom caring for someone so deeply and failing to mention something so dire.
Dean was getting used to flirting with his boyfriend over the counter rather than dragging him into his office whenever he felt like it.
Dean didn't really mind that people at the office noticed his change in attitude. He could tell he was smiling more, he was friendlier, he came out of his office more often. When he could he would steal a moment with Cas, just a quick look or a kiss in the elevator. He wasn't sure if people knew, but he didn't care. If they wanted the facts they could talk to him about it, this wouldn't be like last time.
"Thanks. Me too." He all but choked out, throwing his backpack over his shoulder and turning to hurry toward the elevators.
One hand still clasped around Dean's wrists, the other reaching back behind him, Cas began to roll his hips forward to rub himself along Dean's quickly hardening length. There were nights that Dean loved to be in control, but this wasn’t one of them, and Cas was relieved. He paused in his movements for only a second to fish around the bed for lube, before returning his attention to Dean.
Cas could feel his cheeks flushing, mortified to have misread this whole situation. Who was he kidding? This man was his boss, a business icon, he didn't want any kind of relationship with his secretary. This had been a mistake, and he should never had let Balthazar or anyone talk him into this.
Biting back his suggestion to cool down in the shower, Cas nodded. "Well, please get home safely, then." Cas was still feeling a little bold, the last of his buzz still vibrating under his skin, but he forced himself to hold back. He wanted Dean to feel comfortable with this, despite them obviously both wanting to dive in. He knew Dean needed to build trust after his last relationship, and Cas was willing to be patient.
Feeling Dean smile against his chest, Cas managed to open his eyes to glare down at him. Dean waited until their eyes met before he dove his hand into Cas's boxers, wrapping his hand around his quickly hardening dick.
Twenty minutes later, they were the only people seated at a high top in some cocktail lounge a few blocks away at 5:30 on a Monday afternoon. Balthazar had, of course, ordered them something eccentric and fruity, and was sipping it with wide eyes as Cas recounted what had happened. A smile gradually spread across his face as Cas's began to blush, hurriedly skipping over the details to the end. Balthazar sat back and clapped his hands together.
"You two really do have some natural chemistry, or something. You were right when you said it was almost tangible. The man would be an idiot to not see it too!" He had said between bites of his sandwich. Cas listened with a small smile. He had never been particularly charming outside of the work setting, but with some coaching from Balthazar he had flawlessly executed a 'casual cool interaction,' as Balthazar called it. He was feeling confident, and eager to see how happy hour would go if Dean did show up.
A beat of silence, where Cas saw Dean's lips tug upward as they stared at each other, then Dean was shimmying himself into Cas's space. Dean nuzzled at Cas's jaw, trailing his lips up to his ear while he wound his arms around Cas's waist. "I think I owe you a favor from earlier" he breathed in Cas's ear.
"Can I take you out to lunch?" Cas's eyes snapped up again, wide as he saw Dean mindlessly straightening papers on his desk rather than looking at him. "As a like, welcome to the team kinda thing. Obviously. Since you're new. I guess that's obvious too." Dean's cheeks were flushing almost as quickly as Cas's.
"Listen, Cas. It's nobody's damn business. I love my team, I really do, but they tend to stick their noses into stuff they don’t understand, and they don’t realize who they can hurt…" Dean trailed off, and Cas had to prevent himself from prying. He had the feeling Dean would tell him on his own terms.
Cas fell apart. Dean smirked against the man's neck, alternating between nibbling, sucking, and moaning himself, while Cas's hands searched for something to hold onto. He was biting his lip to hold back soft whimpers, and so instead they were coming out as low moans in his throat. They should stop, Dean knew, but this was too good, and he was enthralled in the way he had Cas squirming in his hands.
That's a wrap! Thank you to everyone who kept up with me through the monster fic that this turned into. I hope you've enjoyed it!
Never again, he thought. No more getting close to his employees. No more blabbing his mouth off late at night after one too many beers. He wasn't going to put everything he had worked for at risk, not ever again.
"Oh my god, shut up Sam!" Dean all but yelled, a grin making it's way across his face. "Will you ever grow out of the Pain In My Ass phase?"
Cas made it safely inside his studio before he let the tears start to fall. So he had just been a play thing on Dean Winchesters to do list. He meant no more to him than the last secretary he had fucked, and he had been stupid to think otherwise. Dean was the typical CEO, doing whatever he wanted with whoever he wanted, and Cas fell right into the trap. He was so stupid.
He changed the subject. "Dean, how did you and your brother become involved in all this?" Dean smiled, and launched into his life story, about his parents and his brother and how this company had come to be his. And Sam's, of course. Cas listening intently, mesmerized by the way Dean spoke so fondly of his brother, of their relationship and the work the did together. Cas thought distantly that he would like to meet Sam.
"Hey, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Um.." Dean cast his eyes down to his feet, "Uh, if you want, I mean if it's something you would like, maybe I can make us dinner sometime? Maybe this week?" He felt his own cheeks flush. God he was such a wimp! "Or if you'd rather go out somewhere or do something else or-"
"Of course, all the sweeter as the week is coming to an end. You'll be coming out for drinks later, yeah?" Balthazar replied as Dean continued to stand there, trying to control his thoughts.
For a split second, Cas saw Dean pout a little, and chuckled. "That walk took far less time than I had hoped," he sighed, following Dean's gaze to his front door. When he turned back, Dean was staring at him, lips parted ever so slightly, as if contemplating his next move. Cas let his eyes slide down to Dean's mouth, nibbling on his own bottom lip for a moment before he let himself give in.
"You're going to leave?" Dean said, not quite able to hide the disappointment from his voice. Based on Cas's history, he stayed in on place for anywhere from six months to a little more than a year. He was aware he barely knew the guy, but why bother trying to establish a trusting friendship if he was just going to up and go?
She let out a puff of breath, looking quickly back at Cas before continuing, "Dean Winchester, stop worrying about everyone else and worry about you. What do you want? Why don't you try just opening up to someone, see where that gets you? Try a different approach this time! And please, everyone loves and supports you, and we are willing to take down anyone who says otherwise. Do something to make you happy. Take the man out on a date
They're all pretty friendly in this office, and when this whole incident went down, that had been Dean's biggest regret. Benny had been playing them all, flashing his smile and charming everyone with his heavy New Orleans accent. Nobody had suspected he was here for information, to turn around and betray the team that had grown to love him. The media flashed a story of loose lips in the break room, some chatter amongst employees that got into the hands of some no good people, but nobody knew the real story. Nobody knew just how close he had become with his personal assistant, or just how much Dean might spill to someone he thought he could trust. Someone he thought his was falling for. Or at least, he thought nobody knew. Again, it seems he was too easy to read within his own office. He scrubbed his hand over his face with a groan, thankful that his remaining employees respected him enough to keep his personal life out of this.
"Well, that's the biggest mystery of all." Balthazar continued, eyes gleaming with suspense, "I can't be sure as I was hired shortly after this whole mess, but from what I have heard, Dean had given the media a twisted story." The car pulled over now, but Cas was still confused.
"Hey," he whispered, and Dean peered at him through a half open eye, "I'm happy here, Dean, with you. I hope you know that." He continued dragging his nails up and down Dean's arm, making it difficult for him to focus on his words. With a light hearted groan, Dean dragged himself up to lean on his arm, eyes narrowing at Cas.
The barista was a short, cheery eyed guy, with a little bit of scruff and some loose light brown curls. His nametag, precariously hanging from his apron, said Chuck.
Later the found themselves sprawled on the bed -- their bed -- skin flushed from the shower's hot steam, a small trail of bruises blooming along Cas's collarbone. Dean smirked as he looked over at him, his eyes fluttering closed in post-shower bliss while Cas rubbed his arm gently. He was nearing the precipice of sleep when Cas nudged him awake.
Cas moaned, head falling back against the pillows. His hands found their way into Dean's hair as he resumed his path down Cas's torso, grabbing small handfuls with each stroke.
Dean turned away in search of a towel to clean up with, while simultaneously trying to hide his own reddening cheeks. This guy was damn hot, and Dean wanted to do
Twirling the bottle in his fingers, Dean thought back to Cas. He thought about the way the other man had so obviously wanted him too, and just as badly. The way his breath caught when Dean said his name, the way he had so gracefully taken control in the bathroom, the way he had been almost soft out there on the sidewalk. He thought about the way he had laughed with all the other employees over drinks, the quality of their conversation at lunch the day before. Dean was struggling to push back what his brain was screaming at him, trying to regain focus on the whole 'just for fun' thing.
Cas stumbled out of the car, squinting as he tried to understand these snippets of information he had gained over the last few hours. Balthazar yelled to him as the car pulled away, but he only vaguely noticed as the pieces slowly came together. As he trudged up the steps to his front door, he twisted the key, and everything slid into place with a click.
“It is so nice to finally meet you! I’m Charlie.” She took a step into the waiting area and extended her hand, glad to put a face to the name she had been speaking with for the last few weeks.
Dean's rain soaked clothing littered the floor in a trail to the bathroom door, which was cracked open, steam curling out in wisps. Cas hesitated, wondering if maybe he could get away with hopping in the shower with him, but decided he didn't want security called if that went south. If he was being honest with himself, anything he did right now could go horribly wrong. He was confident Dean was attracted to him, sure, but there was that tug of doubt at the edges of his mind telling him not to try anything, the man was
He thought it had to be working too. Even though Dean wasn't particularly chatty with him, he greeted Cas with a warm smile when they saw each other, and always thanked him for all he did. Although, Cas didn't think anything he was doing was all that difficult. He was just doing what, he hoped, was in his job description.
Dean hadn't planned for the day to end this way, a rookie mistake as most Seattle afternoons ended in rain. Part of him didn't mind where things were going, but a larger part of him was anxious as all hell. When he'd suggested getting dry, he hadn't given a second thought to calling an Uber for them to get back to his apartment. But now that they were soaking wet in the backseat of a black Honda, just a block from his place, he was worried it had been the wrong move.
Cas helped him clean up, both men slipping in a few flirtatious touches, smiling and glancing at each other as they moved about the space with ease. Cas changed into his now dry clothes from the day before, and as noon approached Dean found he was searching for things to talk about to prevent him from leaving. He was enjoying the company, but also the casual familiarity with which they interacted. Rubbing the back of his neck, Dean walked Cas to the door. He didn't want this to feel like a one night stand kind of goodbye because he didn't want it to be a one night stand.
He felt Dean stiffen is his arms, the man's breath hitching deliciously. Cas smiled, continuing his path down Dean's jaw, pressing himself against the towel separating them.
Cas launched at him then, rolling him onto his back and straddling him in one swift motion, a yelp erupting from Dean's mouth. Pinning Dean's hands above his head, Cas lowered his face until he could feel Dean's breath on his lips. He smirked.
As Dean had expected, Cas was enjoying the food booths throughout the market, putting together a makeshift dinner for the two of them. Dean waved off his other dinner plans, content to let his date explore more. They could grab drinks later, or maybe even plan dinner for another night. The idea thrilled Dean.
“You could spend the rest of my life just hanging around the bunker, binging Netflix and stealing all the coffee and it wouldn’t make me
Dean smiled too. That wasn’t even that bad—It had actually been kinda nice to talk about it, finally.
To Dean’s horror, Cas looked apprehensive. Dean started mentally scrambling for a way to back track. Oh my god, what if Cas hadn’t actually meant that he was
So he’d travelled far and fast, with only a heavy grief to keep him company. At the time, he felt only pain, too thick to reach the anger that he should have directed back at Dean. It took him time to interrogate what Dean had said to him and come to the conclusion that Dean may have been projecting.
And then Chuck whipped around and covered Michael’s hand with his own, snuffing out as much of the light as possible, forcing Michael down on his knees before him.
“No, that’s not right. You can’t give up your life, your existence for some fleeting notion of perfection. You can’t sacrifice yourself for anyone, for anything. Your life is worth too much.”
The air felt thicker than it used to. The weight of it crushed around him, inescapable. A millennia and a handful before of being able to slice though the atmosphere, through various dimensions in a matter of moments, and now the air felt so thick Castiel wasn’t sure he’d ever move from this spot. Surely if he lifted his arm, the pressure would break it in half.
“It won’t change,” Dean said firmly. “He’s still Cas. He’s been an angel since the big bang or whatever, I’m sure he’s still got a few angelic tips up his sleeve for you. And anyway, I don’t think that what you and Cas have is ‘cause you share some weird angel DNA, you just… love each other and have shit in common. Don’t worry about it.”
“Why ‘Castiel’?” he asked suddenly. He could probably count on one hand the number of times he’d heard Dean use his full name.
“I’m comfortable,” Cas said firmly. “Just earlier with Jack, I thought you might have been trying to avoid talking about…us, when he’d asked where we’d gone.”
“How is it that you’re back for two goddamn minutes and we’re already fighting,” Dean let out his breath in a hiss. “Let me bottom line this: I can’t, without you. Not any of it. I’m tired of pretending it’s any other way.” His mouth was a hard line, but his eyes were pleading, begging Castiel to understand.
The plan was simple. They would walk straight into the meat grinder, and with Jack and Michael’s powers combined, they would essentially hoist Chuck by his own petard. Michael hadn’t come empty handed; from the center of the Garden, Michael had retrieved what he called the Sword of God. It didn’t look like a sword at all—it was, as far as Dean could tell, a small ball made of brown clay. Michael explained that within its crude casing, a power source strong enough to destroy any life, even God’s, existed.
“Good, she’s great, we’re—ah shit. Sorry, we’re probably heading that way soon, Eileen wanted to do some research on tulpas, some weird stuff down South… fuck,” a clattering noise on the other end.
“True, but being dead wouldn’t help you get to the Empty anyway, it’s not for human souls. A dead human would be ejected immediately. What I think you
“Jesus,” Dean murmured. Castiel tentatively looked over at him, taking in his crumbled brow and clenched jaw. “Sometimes,” Dean said quietly, “Sometimes it feels like I’ve lost the best years of my life. My entire life, wasted on Chuck’s plot points, and now I’m old and worn out and free, I guess, but too late.”
“Okay, so great, Jack can toss the God power away, and that’s that?” Dean looked around for confirmation.
When their knuckles brushed, Dean clenched his fist like he’d been electrocuted, but Castiel captured his hand in his, unwinding the tense fingers between his own.
Dean had that look again, the same one he’d had outside the barn, when he’d struggled with himself before hugging Castiel.
“Adam,” Cas gave him a small smile. “I’m sorry about Michael. I’m not sure whether it would be a comfort, but please let me know if you’d like to talk—I wasn’t a particularly good brother to him lately, but I knew Michael for many millennia. I’ve learned a lot from him. If you’d be interested.”
“So,” Castiel trailed a hand from Dean’s head down his neck and over his shoulder, to the place where he had first connected to Dean Winchester in Hell. “It that something you would be interested in too? With me?”
Castiel hesitated for a moment. “I did. Leave.” He didn’t look at her face, not wanting to see any betrayal in light of his abandonment of her son.
“No, we’re not alright. The Empty took Cas, he made some kind of deal to save Jack way back when, and he called the Empty to collect. We were trapped, it took Billy too.”
Dean continued to stare at Castiel seriously. “I’m not trying to pull you away from the kid, Cas. I know I’ve been all kinds of awful when it comes to him, I just… I wish I could have made it right, and if the one thing I can do is make sure he has you, I’m not gonna force you to stick around.”
I'm pretty sure there will be another chapter of this, but I'm also pumped to start writing some other stuff. I was not anticipating that i'd be writing supernatural fanfic in the year 2020, what a time to be alive :')
Settling back down, he accepted the call, resuming his petting of Dean’s hair to hopefully quiet him.
“A freak meteor shower, that’s what the paper’s called it!” a plump women insisted around her nodding companion to the man at the next table.
easier, either. Got worse, maybe. Especially when it was my fault, which it was, half the time. This last time you were gone… I just. It was like all my bullshit was just obliterated, and I was left with two things; what you thought of me, and all my regrets. And those things couldn’t exist together. So during the day I’d try to act out what you thought of me, try to be better. And at night I’d just. Fall apart. Just sit there with all the things I never did, never said to you. The things I did do, that I
He tried to be present, to be there as he said goodbye, as words slipped out of his mouth, sentimental and meandering, but his mind felt foggy, the pain radiating through him, making him feel sick, weak, his weight held up on legs that were past ready to give way. And in the end, he let himself be selfish, just once with his little brother, to say something for himself, instead of whatever he thought might comfort Sam.
With a gasp they broke apart, still clutching each other. Cas's hair was impossibly more wild, his lips red and swollen from the intensity of their kissing, and Dean felt suddenly and hopelessly lost in his need to make Cas look even more disheveled. Cas seemed to understand, and with a smirk he pushed up from the desk, gently walking Dean back to press him against the wall of windows, and find his way to Dean's neck.
Cas raised an eyebrow back, "I hope she had the decency to take you home first, it's seems awfully uncomfortable a thing to do in front of your employees." Cas was careful to mention a female, as Balthazar had warned him however blatant his flirting might be, Dean's bisexuality was still kind of a secret.
Cas moved his hands to either side of Dean's head, crawling upward as he continued his slow thrusts, planting soft kisses up his stomach, chest, and neck until his head was resting against his collarbone.
There was a moment's pause before the door opened slowly, green eyes peeking through the gap. Despite his nerves, Cas couldn't help but smile at the way Dean's cheeks flushed almost instantly. He opened his mouth to speak but stopped as another head popped up behind Dean's.
Balthazar insisted that he come out to happy hour tomorrow night, and he would pull every string to get Dean to come. He was eager to see what would happen outside of the office setting, despite Cas's protests. He wouldn't tell Balthazar the thought of  going out for drinks with the man made his heart race. Not that he needed alcohol to make anything happen, but it would certainly help calm his nerves. He thought briefly how he'd like to return the favor and tease Dean himself, not to mention he was confident he could do a much better job. But maybe not at a work outing.
Trust me. Just go say something. I need to sign on you getting fired anyway if things go south, so don't worry about." She winked at him, stepping aside to let him out of the booth.
"Mr. Winchester, Sam is on the line for your scheduled conference call" came Cas's low rumble through the receiver.
As Cas worked Dean open, he whispered dirty encouragements, causing Dean to wriggle and whine underneath him. After a few minutes, the whimpers had turned into soft begging, Dean bucking his hips in hopes that Cas would slide a little lower.
Dean threw his arms around Cas's neck, pulling him down into a kiss that said more than any words ever could. Cas picked up his pace again, something gentler than before, resting his forehead against Dean's when they pulled apart for air.
"Charlie, I don't know what to say. Thank you, for this and for everything. I cannot express how much your friendship means to me, especially considering I was afraid I had fucked it up." He heard her chuckle on the other end of the line, "I will give him a call. Thanks Charlie."
Cas's breath hitched in his throat as Dean rolled him onto his back, crawling over him and starting the slow descent down his body with his lips. He felt Dean's hand skim over his crotch, fingertips trailing teasingly over the fabric separating them. In the same moment, Dean's teeth grazed across a nipple and Cas couldn't help but buck underneath him.
Dean had ordered the classic wings with a side of their famous Phoenix Ash hot sauce, which he made Cas promise to try, while Cas ordered some parmesan chili garlic wings for himself. From there, Dean was surprised, they fell into easy conversation. Dean brought the topic back to Cas's history of travel, which sent Cas on a storytelling spree of his adventures. It was easy to see the guy was passionate about being able to have his freedom, and Dean couldn't help but smile at the way he spoke about each new place with such detail. He reminded him a bit of Sam. Distantly, he noted he would love for them to meet.
Dean was so focused on the quiet hitching of Cas's breath that he almost didn't hear Sammy come on the line.
As expected, when Monday morning came, his phone lit up with messages from his coworkers, well ex-coworkers now, at Winchester Roasted HQ. If he was being honest, what he wanted right now was a couple of drinks with Balthazar to rant about everything that had happened. Being alone the last few days, his mind had spun stories of what Dean might have said, how he was spending his time without Cas, if he had already found someone else. He remembered all the times Dean acted different in front of other people, all the times he had hid Cas from everyone else. That wasn't what people in relationships did.
"Glad to meet you, uh, sort of, Cas! I've heard lots about you!" Sam said with a wink, causing both Cas and Dean to blush, Charlie letting a small giggle slip out before her hand shot to her mouth. "Alright, alright. Let's get this started."
“Okay Cas, we’re gonna get you home, you’re okay.” He gestured to Sam, who was hanging back slightly. He came around Cas’ other side and together they got him out of the barn and into the Impala.
They chatted casually for a few minutes (Sam and Eileen were thinking of taking a trip to see Donna, Jody and the girls), but Dean couldn’t really engage. Something felt off. When he looked over at Cas talking happily with Sam, he realized what.
They heard the soft rasp of a match being struck, and a large candle on the altar flickered to life.
He thought of all the other times that Cas had died. It was always tinged with regret; Dean always cursed his inability to be honest with himself and honest with Cas after. He had spent months thinking that, if he’d known Cas was going to die, he would have done things differently, he would have at least
As the rebar slid free, Cas covered the wound with his hand and pushed his grace into Dean’s body, healing it from the inside out, Dean’s head slumped on his shoulder.
“Sorry. I mean, it makes sense. He obviously had a sort of… special attachment to you, I mean he’s pretty much lived his life around you for years.”
They arrived back at the bunker the following evening, Miracle jumping happily from the backseat when they pulled up front and immediately chasing after a squirrel that skittered by.
“How are the negotiations going?” Castiel asked her, as he tapped Eileen on the shoulder and offered her his untouched beer, which she took happily with a wink. One of the tasks that Jack had determined necessary, after returning the Empty and its souls to rest, was a reworking of Hell’s internal structure, with an emphasis on redemption, and the possibility of a peaceful afterlife for the condemned souls that chose to work towards it. It was a massive undertaking, second only to the restructuring of heaven itself, and required the participation of not only Rowena, but the angels and Anubis as well. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the angels needed the most convincing. Fortunately, and for entirely transparent reasons, Gabriel had taken the task upon himself to find a workable solution and proved himself effective at working with Rowena and converting the angels.
Jack held his gaze. Castiel couldn’t be sure what he found there, but finally Jack sighed again. “Okay.”
Castiel forgot to breathe for a few quick beats, but the burst of activity in his mind compensated for this.
“Dean will be okay,” Sam lied. “We’ve all had to make hard choices Jack, and I know that if Cas could go back and change anything, he wouldn’t even consider it, not if it kept you safe. This was his choice, it’s not on you.”
“Okay, okay, I get it,” Dean cut him off, trying desperately to get his blushing under control. This was not the time to act like a schoolgirl talking about her crush.
“This force… it feels less familiar than I expected,” Michael confessed as the neared their destination. “It could be Him, or it could be something else entirely.”
But before Dean could, everything shifted. It felt like he was falling, the fog around him lifting away to reveal the open Kansas sky, twinkling with thousands of stars. He felt off balance, the world around him suddenly clear, the ground below him solid.
It was a remarkable feat, a true act of creation the likes of which hadn’t been seen in millions of years. And to maintain it, a fleet of Heaven’s finest. Jack, in his new all-knowing wisdom, had taken from the Empty all those who had fought on the side of freedom, those who could understand what it was that they were trying to accomplish. Those that would love humanity, and the world, as they were meant to.
Castiel watched this bizarre interaction with a raised brow, officially having moved on from concerned to casually nonplussed.
“That, and I was worried her and Eileen would hate each other and Sam would have a full on mental breakdown.”
“You didn’t give me a chance to say much there, you know? You got some timing, Cas. I’ve gotta find you now, because I’ve got something to tell you, and neither of us are gonna die after. Okay?”
“You’re a better friend than a fighter. And I’m not saying you’re not a hell of a fighter,” Dean cut Castiel off before Castiel could vocalize his own indignation. “You’re a major badass. Could kick my ass any day in a fair fight, juiced up or not. I’m just sayin’ that of all the things you’re “good for”, that doesn’t even crack the top ten for me.” Dean actually used air quotes, which would have struck Castiel as hilarious if he wasn’t so thoroughly confused by the turn in conversation.
He’d spend so many years adamantly not saying anything, that now that he was supposed to, it felt almost impossible to get the words out.
“In sex, you mean?” Castiel asked, mostly to see if it would make Dean blush. He was rewarded when Dean’s ears flushed red while he nodded.
“Oh,” Dean replied, feeling his heart sink, “Okay yea that’s fine, whatever pace you want is okay with me, I’m not trying to pressure you, or or make you feel…” he trailed off again, feeling particularly stupid.
He was fully prepared to just continue following his instincts, but it seemed that Dean’s new-found verbosity extended even here as he broke his mouth free and gasped, “C-Cas, Cas, wait, slow down buddy, just—”
“Because,” he began, but there was no end to that sentence. How could he explain to this child that some lives are more valuable than others, than
After dinner, Castiel helped Dean with dishes while Eileen and Sam dug through the bunkers tulpa lore. Dean had been quiet through dinner, letting Castiel catch the others up on their meeting, though he seemed content, only a small amount of tension winding along his soul. It lingered, accompanying a small line bisecting his brows as he frowned down at the dish in his hands.
“We figured out how to defeat Chuck. After I blew up the Empty, I could take in power, consume it into me, so I took Chuck’s. Sam and Dean helped,” Jack smiled fondly.
Dean could hear the panic in Sam’s voice, but he found himself impervious to the feeling. The worst had already happened, this was just one more thing to fix.
“I don’t deserve that, Cas. I doubt he thinks that way about me anymore, and I just. I fucked it up, no wonder the kid couldn’t wait to get away.”
They’d alternated between rock cassettes and the radio as they wove their way home. Dean had sung along to Bachman-Turner Overdrive and Taylor Swift alike, the windows rolled down and the countryside whipping by as Castiel taped out the beat against the warm metal of Baby’s door, and Miracle snapped his teeth at the breeze. It was a bright day, but the happiness on Dean’s face had outshone the sun and Castiel had stared unapologetically, basking in the warmth of Dean’s smile.
“I love you too,” Cas said quickly, suddenly realizing that that was the typical response, and that he’d inadvertently left Dean hanging. He suddenly worried that Dean might be regretting saying anything and couldn’t let that happen.
“Kinda hope Rowena shows up before Sam and Eileen get here,” Dean commented as he wrestled the ball from Miracle once more. The dog would eagerly bring the ball back but wasn’t keen on giving it up without a fight.
Jack bit his lip, looking every bit the young man he’d been on earth, about to tell his father something he really didn’t know how to say.
It might as well have been a hundred. Castiel didn’t respond immediately, going over Dean’s words in his mind, staring at Dean’s face in a slight daze. Castiel could find something to argue against nearly every point Dean had made, but somehow, the sheer fact that Dean apparently thought those things, regardless of whether they were factual, overwhelmed his tendency towards self effacement.
. If things were constantly kept at a boiling point, if we were always in crisis mode, if I could never stick around between one emergency to the next and you could never feel secure enough to ask me to, then nothing would change with us, and therefore I wouldn’t interrupt Chuck’s story any more than I already had. He was very preoccupied with keeping you and Sam isolated, only able to rely on each other. It’s remarkable, Dean, that even in the face of God’s will, you’ve been able to form a community in the past several years anyway, to make a family. I hope you can see that for the feat of strength, of free will, that it is.”
“My dear, what on earth are you doing down in Kansas, aren’t you and wee Jack sitting atop the high heavenly throne?”
“Our height difference isn’t quite enough for that,” Castiel replied, and then immediately felt a nervous giddiness rush through his body. For over ten years he’d refrained from making innuendos, even when Dean tossed them directly at him, and now he was practically begging Dean Winchester to kiss him, out loud, to his face. He still had no idea if that was something Dean would want, or would let himself want.
The women’s husband interrupted then, “It’s all gotta be hush-hush, I mean they can’t exactly expect them aliens to be as friendly as E.T. now can they?” He laughed gruffly, but Castiel found himself pushing up from his chair and heading for the door of the restaurant almost before he could think about what he was doing. All he knew is that he didn’t want to talk to these people who called his family aliens in a restaurant where he had been forced to hide out for months until he’d caused a building full of people to be slaughtered, hearing more about an E.T. that left a sharp pang in his very human heart for completely unknowable reasons.
It sounded too simple to be possible, but the point was salient. He felt his heart lift from where it had settled in his stomach when they started talking about Jack again. “I… I don’t know. Maybe he doesn’t.” He looked at Dean, noting the determination in the set of his brow.
Castiel wondered absurdly if perhaps humans really were feeling their lost limbs, as they existed in an alternate reality where they were still attached. He supposed it could be true for some of them, those more tuned into their extra senses. But Castiel did not feel tuned into anything.
Dean smiled again, and this time when he laughed it wasn’t as harsh as it had been a moment ago. He looked genuinely happy, if a little overwhelmed and confused.
“A—persona, an avatar for that power to exist within a limited structure that allowed God to walk among humans. Chuck is that power’s sentience made manifest in human form.”
, but there wasn’t another option. I’m sorry that I wasn’t there to help with Chuck, I know I should have been, but—I’d make the same choice again, even if it means that things are awkward between us. It saved you, and that’s worth everything.”
As Castiel gaped at the smaller man who strode out in front of him, cocking his head to the side with furrowed brows and his mouth slightly open, Chuck rocked back on his heels, hands shoved into the white pockets of his white suit, and gave Cas a sheepish smile. He lifted a hand from his pocket and gave Cas a brief wave as he said, “Heya, Castiel, you got a minute?”
Eileen largely ignored their interaction for the moment though, instead dropping her bag by the stairs and wrapping Castiel in a strong embrace that he quickly reciprocated.
specifically? That sometimes, people make so many mistakes that the only right thing to do is sacrifice themselves for someone or something better. Jack had told him that he was willing to sacrifice himself to stop Chuck in order to earn the Winchester’s forgiveness. How often had Castiel vowed his own life for that same thing?
“This is a good thing, Dean. It’s a win. Just don’t start freaking out until you talk to him, okay?”
Castiel dragged his tongue along his bottom lip, hating the thought of Dean in pain, of Dean seeing death as a way out. He fought against a wave of nausea, seeking to block any further thoughts about it before they formed.
. But he had just watched his family burn up the night sky.  Castiel had long ago accepted that his life was divided between two realms, a family that he couldn’t be with and one that he was bound to whether he wanted to be or not. And now he was suddenly unbound, any tethers forged by grace, duty, and kinship burned away like so many paper lanterns. Castiel had wondered, after the lights had finished falling from the Heavens, if he might find land scorched with the ashes of his siblings wings, as far and wide as the eye can see, like when he had played god and decimated a sunny Tuesday in heaven. But there was nothing, no sign that their grace had ever existed. The wings had just burnt up, gone. As Castiel began to move, dazedly, towards nothing at all, he swore he could still feel the weight of his own wings, could almost swear that they must still be there, but when he’d grasped over his shoulder, his hand had simply clutched the cloth of Jimmy’s much abused overcoat, the fabric thin and brittle against the brisk chill of the May evening.  Still, Castiel could swear he could feel them, the weight too real, the tingle too familiar as they fluttered behind him as he moved. It was as if they existed as they always had to humans; there, but insubstantial, unreachable, beyond the planes of this particular reality. But this was the only reality Castiel could access now, and so he could not say if what he was experiencing was any more than how a human might experience a phantom limb.
Cas was quietly mouthing along to the opening verse of Over the Hills and Far Away, and Dean felt a surge of affection shoot through him. It was enough to make his nose tingle in a way that signaled coming tears. It was one of the songs that he’d put on the tape he’d given Cas, years ago.
Mary smiled at him again and took his hand in hers, squeezing lightly. The beach melted away, and they were on the porch of a cheerful house, a replica of her home in Lawrence.
It was an absurd notion. Castiel had already traveled a considerable distance, walking and using public transport, unable to lift a wing to quicken the journey. But now that the bunker, the home of the Winchester’s,
They walked home chatting about their day as usual, and were barely in the door when Dean pressed him up against the wall, his lips immediately finding Cas's neck.
"God I love the way that sounds," he laughed, his own voice coming out raspy, still clutching the collar of Cas's shirt. He noted it had become slightly untucked, and wondered if he also looked so disheveled. Cas pulled back far enough to meet his eyes, searching them for where Dean might want to go from here. Before he could say anything, the door swung open, and they jumped apart, turning to the sinks to tidy themselves up while Dean silently prayed it wasn't someone from work. Luckily, the stranger only hesitated a moment, narrowing his eyes at them before carrying on.
Benny hadn't been like this though. Benny had been all too quick, not deep enough, just rough and fun, and comfortable. They had spent little time getting to know each other, and instead spent most of it just around each other. Dean, admittedly, had begun falling for the man for his charming personality. It wasn't until after everything that happened had he realized he didn't know the guy at all. There had been a spark and a flame, but all fires fizzled out eventually. Cas was electric, buzzing with more frequency under Dean's skin every day since the day he stepped into this office.
Two hours into his drive back north, Cas stopped off for some gas and snacks. He had left almost immediately upon hanging up with Charlie, throwing his phone in his bag, then into the back seat, speeding out onto the highway. Now, as he refueled, he fished his phone out of his bags, seeing notifications he hadn't bothered to check after his wake up call.
Something clicked then. He hadn't thought of it before since he had never seen Dean's reaction to Benny, but suddenly it made sense.
"I'm not a huge fan of heights, but if you want…" Dean mumbled, eyes wide as he stared at the building almost shrouded by clouds.
With a smile, Dean turned to head back down the street, but paused and looked back to Cas. "Goodnight Cas" he said softly, then began his walk home, leaving Cas standing there staring, a flutter in his stomach.
Dean is half aware that Sam has stopped talking, and he cracks an eye to peer over at him. He’s watching him, the crease between his eyebrows all Dean needs to see to realize he understands what he was doing.
He cursed under his breath as he swiped to open one from Dean. It had been days since they'd spoken, and now hours (why was Dean texting him at 4 am?) since Dean had finally reached out and Cas had basically ignored him. Past noon now, Cas decided maybe it was time to make the call he'd promised Charlie.
So, one could imagine Cas's surprise as he pushed the office door open, hands full of coffee and paperwork, to find Dean Winchester in the process of pulling a sweat damp t-shirt over his head.
"You can't fool me, Dean. You think turning into a stone cold CEO is going to change what happened? Prevent it from happening again? Your employees, your team, loves you Dean. That's how you built Roasters into something this great. Don't push people away. You're the reason they love coming to work every day."
"Awesome, and hey, thanks for the coffee this morning. It made this rainy Monday a little more bearable." Dean shot back, hoping his fluctuation between stern CEO and pleasant boss wasn't screwing with the new guy's head.
again, like soon. Cas smiled softly as he accepted the towel, then eyed Dean from under his dark lashes.
Cas was smiling, watching Dean's face of mild panic in the mirror. Dean straightened, clearing his throat and raising an eyebrow. "Come on, we've probably been gone suspisciously long."
Cas was falling for this guy, his own boss, and nothing could stop him. The little routines they had worked out together, the way they moved with and around each other like a practiced dance, the way they fell into such a fluid rhythm. Cas often found himself dumbfounded that he could be so lucky.
A quick scan of the room spots Charlie's fiery hair at the far end of the floor next to his office. Beside her, a tall dark haired man in a purple button down under a white cardigan. As he strides toward his office, he nods curtly to each greeting, keeping his eyes trained on the pair at the end of the center isle. Dean watches the man jump into action, nearly tripping over his desk as he tries to get behind it. Charlie had said Castiel was professional and confident, but this guy seemed to be a nervous wreck.
Balthazar took a deep breath, "It was not, as the media said, some idiotic interns, but one man that had been a friend to everyone. From what I have gathered, he had gotten the job with the sole intent of finding information he could sell. He worked there for near a year, becoming friends with everyone in the office, including Dean. You are the first person to fill his position since he left the company months ago."
"Nah, not me. There's a whole coast right here full of cities with… opportunity." He flashed Dean a grin then, causing his stomach to churn with a little bit of butterflies and a little bit of disgust. His gut told him to drop the bartender a twenty and haul ass back to his hotel, back to Seattle even. But at the same time, the familiarity of sitting next to Benny at a bar, his subtle smell, the way his voice rumbled in Dean's chest… he didn't want it to go away.
. Bring him back. And Castiel had, because he had been required to, because Heaven had needed him to, and Dean had as well. Dean had always needed him.
“Roswell,” the women said, nodding her head meaningfully. “They’ve known about this for years. They’ve got to cover it up with meteor showers or else their cover is blown! The American people will know they’ve been lied to, and that’ll mean big problems, won’t it?” She was looking expectantly at Castiel, so he lowered his brows and nodded briefly, trying to seem interested.
And suddenly, without knowing how he came to this conclusion, without being able to rely on grace or even previously acquired knowledge, only human instinct, Castiel understood.
Jack approached the Impala looking both determined and petrified. He’d been eyeing Dean since they arrived but hadn’t had a chance to say anything as they got caught up on Michael’s plan.
“I’ve often been called a freak as well,” he mused, “though I’m not sure Gabriel and I belong to the same category in that regard.”
By the time Sam and Jack walked through the bunker door, Dean and Michael had come up with the closest thing they’d had to a plan since Jack went atomic.
“You’ve been tragically predictable for quite some time; I had little doubt that you two would unleash the Darkness on this world, and that God would return as well. You can imagine my distaste at the thought of playing referee between the two. And I am not impervious to their powers. Had they known where to find me, they might have successfully bound me to their will. If this had happened, we might have faced the ends of all life on the planet… Although perhaps I needn’t have worried, as the two of you have hastened that conclusion regardless.”
“You’re not an idiot,” Cas murmured, and Dean let out a bark of a laugh. He opened his eyes and could see Cas’ lips turned up in a smile.
Behind the candle, a gaunt, almost skeletal face peered through the flame at them. Dean felt his breath hitch in his throat. His feet were glued to the floor.
century priests chopping off their junk because Jesus fucking Christ himself was apparently “misquoted.” You’re way funnier than you pretend to be, and don’t think for a second that you got me fooled with your whole Ariel “what’s a fire and why does it burn” schtick, I know you think you’re real slick but I can usually tell when you’re messing with me, you get this little smile on your face that’s like—”
Dean reached above Cas’ head and pulled down two travel mugs, and Cas quickly dumped the coffee into them.
Castiel stretched out atop the covers, his back resting on the headboard and feet crossed at the ankles before Dean moved to get into bed. Castiel was acutely aware of his hands, and decided that the least awkward thing to do would be to reach for one of the books that he’d placed on the ground beside the bed while Dean slid under the sheets on his side (
When they moved inside, the bunker felt quiet, and Castiel felt a strong pang of grief. For Jack, for the family they’d built. Even though Jack was technically alive and well, their family would never be the same again, would never again exist under the same roof as a tangible unit.
Dean took a couple of deep breathes, closing his eyes and willing himself to take his own advice and calm the fuck down.
She stretched up to place a kiss against his forehead and cradled his face with one hand. “I’m glad to have you in my family, Castiel. I know you’ll make the right choice.”
Dean swallowed again, pulling him back into an embrace and raising his hand to graze through the hair behind Cas’ ear.
When he returned to the barn, Dean and Sam were standing by the car, where a furry beast was happily hanging its head out the window. Castiel reserved his questions for later.
They walked back toward the bunker, carrying a tentative silence between them. Castiel had an irrational fear that if he spoke, he might shatter the illusion of this perfect night, that it might suddenly be revealed to all be a rouse. Briefly, Castiel wondered if there was a possibility that he had never escaped the Empty at all, and that perhaps this was all an elaborate backstory designed to devastate Castiel when the truth was revealed. From the tentative glances Dean threw his way, Castiel wondered if Dean was worried about the same thing.
you. But as far as I knew, nothing ever happened there, so I guess I just kind of chalked it up to a weird angel thing. Just one of those strange
“Angels are capable of sexual attraction. It’s not common, because it usually constitutes an expression of free will, which, as you know, angels are notoriously inept at adapting to. There’s no need for angels to… mate, or... copulate, with one another, as two angels could never produce a child or the angelic equivalent. So attraction between angels is rare. But there are plenty of instances throughout history of angels engaging sexually with humans and producing Nephilim. Certainly not always, um, in what you might consider a romantic manner, but even the Bible has it’s share of stories of passion between angels and humans.”
Castiel’s smile grew. “Would you like me to put your brother on the phone? I’m sure he could walk you through it.”
Prepare for soooo much communication. Like, to the point where I started to worry it was out of character--but, I feel like they've gone so long without actually talking that once they start, they'd just... not stop. No excuses now boys. Anyway I tried to keep it true to them, so hopefully it worked.
“It wouldn’t work, or at least not in the same way. Castiel tore out his grace to leave, and already had a body. If Michael tore out his grace, he’d be reborn, a human baby with no idea who he was, potentially tormented by memories of a past life he could never understand,” Adam said mechanically. He'd clearly been thinking about it since Sam told him last night what had happened.
knew something was wrong with Jack. If you’d told me, “Jack’s unstable, don’t go near him,” do you really think that would have kept me away? I wanted to help him. I don’t even blame Jack, and I certainly don’t blame you. It’s not your job to monitor everyone.”
He didn’t think Dean would remember that conversation, the first time that Castiel voiced his doubts to him, put his faith and confidence in him.
Dean looked around, immediately on high alert, expecting so see that amorphous black goop creeping behind him.
Dean’s jaw clenched but he didn’t let go of Castiel’s hand and his gaze didn’t waver from where it watched the horizon.
and Michael appeared behind Chuck, the Sword’s clay coating breaking apart in his hand and a strange humming light beaming though his fingers, catching Chuck in their reach, and for a moment Dean thought it was over, that it had actually worked—
another way. It’s too much power for one, or even two people to hold, there’s too much risk. Humanity has been manipulated by that power too many times.”
“We’ll get him back,” Sam said softly, and immediately regretted it. Truthfully, how many times could lightning strike the same spot? Surely, they’d used up their “surprise Cas resurrection” chips by now. He wouldn’t have dared get Dean’s hopes up. It probably wasn’t helpful to raise Jack’s, either.
“The uh, the desk chairs in this place kinda suck, so. If you want, you could…” Dean trailed off, scratching the back of his neck sheepishly.
“Hmm,” Cas made a low noise of agreement. “It’s a common phenomenon. Soldiers returning from war and having no idea how to integrate back into a life of peace. So it was for the Achaeans, so it is today.”
Cas hummed and took Dean's hand back in his own, brushing his thumb along Dean's knuckles. “It likely won’t make you feel better, but I suspect Chuck did have something of a hand in that. Maybe not a direct manipulation of your ability to talk, per say, but in our overall…dynamic, I suppose. You said before that you wished we had more than five minutes to talk honestly, but I think it was by design that we
He could hear Dean clamping down on his emotions through his next words. “It wasn’t—I… All I could think about, those days after Jack—all I could think about was
“There’s a lot of things I could tell you Cas,” Dean can hear some of that panic creeping into his voice. How long had it been? Twenty minutes? Thirty? His watch hadn’t ticked since he entered this place.
And to that, Cas had no response at all. Absurdly, the old impulse to fly away struck him immediately, like the instinctual panic of a startled bird. That made no sense, why would he want to leave Dean, especially when he was standing there saying things that Cas never expected to hear, had always
They stopped for the night just before reaching Illinois. Sam had been yawning loudly for the last hour, and Cas could tell that Dean was spent as well, even though his body still contained a tenseness that staved off sleep as he drove for hours.
“This body has aged, though. It’s certainly not the same body that Jimmy Novak vacated all those years ago. I have spent quite a while “powered down” in one way or another, it was inevitable that I’d age at least a handful of years.”
This revelation is what turned him around. He picked his feet off the cement, one and then the other, until he was moving briskly away from the bunker, away from the family he had no right to, the love he had no claim on, and the home he had no place in.
“I took you from there. You and some of the other angels. And I fixed the Empty, and put the Entity to sleep. The remaining inhabitants are resting free of torment. And we’re in heaven because, well, I couldn’t talk to you if you were on earth, and this is my next project. I thought maybe you’d want to help.”
Dean gave a weak smile as his eyes flitted up to Castiel’s and away again. “I know you had… something going on with Meg way back when, and when you were human, but I mean, that was all a long time ago, and you kinda never seemed interested beyond that.”
. He still asked for advice, even asking Castiel permission before making a few adjustments to his plans. When the angels called him “Father”, he smiled and gestured to Castiel. “That’s my father, I’m just Jack.” He spent time with Kelly, and occasionally Castiel joined them, a different little family than the one he typically occupied.
Cautiously, they rounded the corner to the back of the hospital, to the garden that Dean knew would be there, where Chuck would be waiting—
. At best, a useful tool in the Winchester arsenal. At worst, a monster. The type of thing Dean had hunted since he was a child. Ancient and cold and with enough innocent blood on his hands to fill the Nile. An angel, a thing Dean hated, but a grotesquely distorted one too, broken in every conceivable way, and full of deceit.
Cas looked like he might tear up. He pulled Jack into another hug. “Thank you, Jack. I never doubted you for a second. I’m just glad you’re okay,” Cas held Jack’s face between his hands. “I’m never going to let you be put in a position like that again, I just want you to have a safe, happy life. You mean the world to me, Jack.” Cas looked so sincere that Dean’s heart ached. How often had he hurt Cas through how he treated Jack?
Sam shrugged. “You’re my brother, I know you better than anyone. You put on this bullshit bravado thing with him, when you’re not bickering like an old married couple. And you obviously
Dean huffed a short laugh, though he didn’t sound terribly amused. “I know. He said it himself, he couldn’t control you. After you left, I thought a lot about it, about Chuck, about that day that we showed up at his place, trying to track down Sam and Lilith, and his squirrely act dropped for just a minute. “You’re not in this story.” He said it right to our faces, and I still didn’t get it, not any of it, even after we knew what he was. I should’ve talked to you about it, about all that, should’ve apologized.  I would’ve, I think, back before we left purgatory, if we’d had more time. I had a lot more to say. But then it was back topside and I don’t know why it’s always been so damn difficult to just—talk. It doesn’t feel like that, now. It feels like… well, it’s not easy, but I can do it now. I can tell you I, uh, love you.”
Castiel watched the star specked horizon, tracing the lazy slop of fields into the distance. Two field mice chased one another through overgrown grass a few hundred yards away. If Castiel turned his attention to them, he could hear the hushed noise of their paws against the soil.
“Well, it kind of was,” Cas replied, recalling all the times he’d been mocked as the Winchester’s guardian, their lap dog.
Castiel flipped them back over into their previous position before Dean could spiral any further, rewarded once more by Dean’s groan as he brought their hips together. “Really? Years?”
It was possible that Jack might be able to intuit a way to achieve this on his own, though Castiel was hesitant to bring the suggestion to him without doing his own due diligence on his and Dean’s theory.
It wasn’t a question, but Sam nodded. He steeled himself before glancing away from the road and towards the boy. Jack’s brows creased low over his eyes, where regret and barely contained despair swirled. His clear resemblance to Castiel made Sam look away quickly.
“Okay, Dear Abby, calm down,” Dean blustered, and Castiel held back a smile at Dean’s distinct lack of calm. “We called about Jack.”
Things almost felt normal in the bunker that night. Sam had shown Adam to a spare room, and Jack went to the kitchen to make peanut butter sandwiches, which he laid on the library table with a proud grin. Dean looked up from the lore book he was skimming and gave a half smile back.
“I understand that you have collected a weapon,” Death continued. “I can’t tell you whether it will work, but should you manage to sufficiently injure Him, I will be able to step in and ensure that there is no chance of a recovery. His essence, and that of his sister, will be scattered into the universe, and balance will be restored.”
“You might recall that there are thousands of ways that your stories could have gone. There was not one in which Sam Winchester died at the hands of his brother wielding the weapon of Death. There were certainly many where the Darkness killed you both.
Kevin had done as he was told, to the T, actually. Sammy was passed out on his bed, apparently even the excitement of the fallen angels and the pain of the incomplete trial not being enough to overcome the exhaustion of trying to cure a demon like Crowley. Dean checked his temperature, warmer than it should have been, but not dangerous, and put a glass of water beside his bed before exiting the room, knowing there was nothing more he could do for Sam right now, and his brother needed the sleep.
A moment later, Sam, Dean, Jack, and Michael stood in the dilapidated lobby of what looked like an abandoned hospital. It was still dark, the early hours of the morning, and the silence felt heavy.
But from the corner of his eye, he saw Dean’s face turn tender. “Of course, Cas. Always.” His voice was impossibly soft, his hard veneer swept away in the cool evening breeze.
“It’s, uh. It’s probably not the best place for a dog to live,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, looking slightly guilty.
“Nawh, Cas, should be me, you know. Just wish he, you know, already knew. It’s always the talking part, I just wish I didn’t have to say shit.”
Jack collapsed to the ground beside Sam and Dean, breathing deeply into the echoing silence while the sun crept over the hospital behind them.
He led Cas back to his room and turned his back to him as he grabbed a couple of things out of his drawers. He startled slightly when he felt Cas’ hands settle lightly on his hips with his forehead rested on his shoulder.
Dean counted his luck again that Kevin probably hated him enough to not make talking an issue. They drank in silence until Kevin got up, maybe a minute, maybe an hour later, handing Dean the bottle in silent comradery and heading down the hall to a room they’d assigned him. Dean slouched down further and shut his eyes, then squeezed them tighter as he tried desperately to not see the falling night sky behind his eyelid, awash with light as heaven itself fell to the ground.
He wondered if Michael knew. Dean thought back to all the comments that he’d heard over the years, from angels, demons, friends, enemies, all commenting on Dean and Cas’ relationship, snidely or otherwise. Maybe it had been obvious to everyone but Dean. The thought caused him to grit his teeth together roughly to keep from screaming, or possibly sobbing.
As Sam and Eileen scavenged for leftovers in the fridge, Dean gestured for Cas to follow him, mumbling something about finding him some other clothes to wear.
Rowena made a delicate “hmph” noise and extended her hand towards Castiel, who accepted it politely, folding her arm over his own and walking her into the bunker. Dean trailed behind with an exasperated “You’ve got to be kidding me,” whistling for Miracle to follow.
Dean wasn’t sure that that was completely fair, but he was feeling pretty lucky to still be alive in the face of the cosmic being he had tried to kill, so he didn’t challenge him.
“You’re gonna kill me,” Dean muttered, shaking his head in amazement. Cas had been dead yesterday, and today he was sitting in Dean’s car, making dick jokes.
Castiel could practically feel the heat from Dean’s blazing cheeks in response, but he kept his gaze firmly on the path ahead, giving his friend a chance to adjust to this intimacy, or to pull away if he wished. They’d held hands before, but never quite in this way.
“Okay, so, angels don’t bone down together because it would be pointless. But it’s not like you and me could. You know. “Produce life” or whatever.” Dean was blushing furiously now, but to his credit continued. “So is that still something you… Wait,” Dean suddenly looked up, horrified. “We couldn’t, right?”
“It’s stupid,” Dean said eventually, glancing up only briefly. “After everything, I guess I just felt like I’d taken enough from you. Your family, your faith, your life. Didn’t want to take anything else away from you.”
. Hadn’t he become that broken version of himself anyway? That angry, damaged person? He’d vowed to change it, but here he was, not two weeks later, having slid right back into old patterns, and dying before he could correct the course.
Jack had never had an angelic form, having been born directly into a human body, but the aura surrounding him now was vast, like the way a shadow of their true form encompassed envesseled angels. Only it, like the void, was entirely formless, pure energy. Still, there was something familiar about it.
In truth, those weeks had been the hardest Castiel had ever lived through. Worse than falling for the first time, worse than paying penance for releasing the leviathan and decimating heaven, worse than being human and hungry and turned away from only home he could ever imagine, and worse than setting the devil himself free. He left the bunker with no real destination in mind, and to this day he wasn’t sure that he’d completely processed his feelings on everything that had happened. He wasn’t particularly good at identifying his emotions and their sources on a good day, never mind during the worst moments of his life. There was the fear for Jack, the sorrow at losing Mary, the sharp pain of Dean’s hatred followed by the sting of betrayal when Sam and Dean conspired to lock Jack in a Ma’lak Box. And before he’d even begun to unwind all of that, there was the rage at Chuck, and anguish over Jack’s death, all compounded by Dean, always Dean, sending him off to Hell without a care about whether he lived through it, Dean telling him that he was the source of all their problems, Dean letting him walk away without a single word of comfort.
“So, we can assume that when Chuck and Amara became, they were essentially power, or its inverse, with sentience.”
Castiel sighed, lifting his head and resuming his vigil of the fields. “I don’t know why he brought me back so many times, but I know that the things I chose since meeting you, those were my choices. I’ve never doubted that it was all an exercise in free will, one that I was fumblingly bad at at times, but it was quintessentially in my own hands.”
He heard her moving away from the noise of the bar during happy hour as soon as she processed the serious tone of his voice, and then he told her everything. How Balthazar and Aaron had spilled the big secret to him when he first started working there, and how he hadn't really cared until Dean came into the picture, and Dean and never brought it up and now Benny was texting him and Dean was still sleeping with him and he was so stupid to ever--
Dean let out a low groan in response, trying to stroke Cas through his orgasm while he rode out his own, head rolling backward. After a moment he pulled his head back up, resting his forehead against Cas's. Cas blinked, trying to refocus his eyes, inhaling sharply when they did. At this angle, Dean's flushed cheeks brought out a brilliant spattering of freckles visible through his long eye lashes. Cas smiled to himself, lifting his chin to press a soft kiss to Dean's cheek.
After a few moments, Dean appeared around the corner, keeping his eyes down as his made his way to his office. As he approached, he lifted them to catch Cas's, and he looked like he might say something, before changing his mind and continuing through his door. Cas wasn't sure what to expect, as they were still at work and he knew Dean didn't want this to become obvious, but he had a feeling the man wouldn't be able to ignore it for long. The sizzling tension they had been struggling with last week was making it's way back into the air, and Cas couldn't help but feel giddy as it buzzed under his skin. He could wait, if that’s the game Dean wanted to play.
Cas paused. Had he made Dean blush on their lunch break yesterday? And even if he did, why did he care?
"It's not worse, Dean, I think it's just a… slight derailment. I saw the way you two were that day on video chat, I've heard the way you smile when you talk about him. I think it just needs to settle, and then you can speak with him. It will work out."
each other, Dean had found himself stirring from thoughts that centered around Cas more often than not. He told himself it was just the thrill of having something new, but at the same time he couldn't shake the feeling of wanting more, of something bubbling under the surface. He liked having Cas's around, and for now that was what he was going to focus on.
Dean was a little nervous that Cas would be bored. Sure he had mentioned wanting to explore the city, but he'd been here for weeks and maybe what Dean had planned wouldn't be any fun. Maybe Dean was just getting nervous, and maybe he needed to just do the damn thing because he liked Cas and he wanted to hang with the guy.
-" his orgasm hit him like a punch to the gut, his mouth wide but silent as Cas drank him in. Cas sucked slowly, helping him come down before pulling his mouth off and standing to hold Dean up.
Chuckling, Sam tossed his phone back, and replied, "I don't know man, I've just never seen you like this. Even with Benny, you were never like this. I don't want to say the 'L' word, man, but you have it bad!"
Almost on instinct Dean’s mind reaches out in prayer. He doesn’t say much, just pushes all the things he is feeling out there. Maybe Cas will feel them too, and then at least he will know. If Dean can’t get him back, he just wishes Cas could
He swallows back a small sob and shakes his head, not even sure how to respond, his mind now screaming into the void with the pain he feels in his chest. Silently he pats Sam’s hand and goes back to playing with his food.
Cas looked around speculatively before answering, "Drinks sound good, but you'll have to pick the spot."
Afterward, having drank potentially the entire contents of his personal liquor cabinet, he had called Charlie. Sam, in Costa Rica at the time, had made his second trip back to Seattle in that same month the next morning after Charlie had gotten in touch with him. The first trip after the initial leak had been all business, and Dean had done all he could to steer the rumors away from Benny and toward 'a group of interns' in hopes of preventing Benny coming forward. The second trip was for a near incoherent Dean to explain everything to his little brother, in hopes of finding a solution. It was Sam who told him the best plan of action was to keep moving forward and hope for the best. Months later, and Charlie and Sam were the only people who knew the real story.
Dean is happy for him of course.  He’s happy for everyone that returned safely, happy that humanity gets to live another day feeling the warmth of the sun on their faces.
A tentative hand reaches out between them, Sam’s fingers pausing to hover over Dean’s shoulder before shifting down to squeeze his forearm instead.
A slew of employees followed them down to Tasting, where Sam met Balthazar, enthusiastic and flirty as ever, and he began to set up his tasting. Dean, Charlie, and Gabe hung at the back, eager to watch Sam spew all his newfound knowledge. Out of habit, Dean turned to whisper something to Cas, and felt a sharp pang in his chest when he realized he wasn't there. Charlie caught his expression, gently taking his hand.
"Wha- what're you, oh- Cas, what- " Dean tried, cut off by Cas's lips catching his. Cas could feel that he was a little tense, unsure what was happening, but he wasn't fighting it.
They had plans for dinner, but Dean had arranged to pick Cas up a little earlier to do some sight seeing before they ate. Dressed in a lightweight flannel over a black t-shirt and dark jeans, his nerves were making him warm on a cool evening as he approached Cas's block. A smile tugged at his lips as he thought about kissing Cas again, his gut telling him this was more than he had thought he could get himself into again.
Cas has to a stifle a laugh, “Please don’t tell me that’s the best you could come up with.” He turned to pour Dean the cup of black coffee he knew he wanted. “Are you gonna hang out until I get off?”
Giant picture windows surround him, dousing the entire floor in a soft glow as the morning sun struggles to rise above the Seattle cloud cover. To his right, along the outer wall are a series of desks designed to be shared in a similar fashion to a computer café. To his left, three long tables with bar seating stretch parallel to a couple glass enclosed meeting rooms. A few lazy morning smiles turn to greet the pair as they walk to the other side of the floor, between the desks and tables. While personal belongings are strewn across most of the desk spaces, it seems all present are gathered around the long tables, talking quietly, coffee cups clutched in their fists.
