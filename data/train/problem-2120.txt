PFFT. Its Never happening sherlock. And it won't. I'll make sure.
"yes mycroft, do go on with your talk about the... Hands and guns. Or guns with hands... Zzzzz" sherlock replied
Sherlock just stared at his best friend. He has many times seen John cry but he has never been in such a state. He was about to have a complete meltdown. And sherlock of course wouldn't be able to do anything. But he just couldn't help it. There was too much going on. What's wrong with being high so you can float away from everything? Of course John neither anyone would be able to see that.
" enough about John. That ba—"
Sherlock has a voice in his head who is really annoying.
Since sherlock just wouldn't listen to mycroft, I had to listen to mycroft for him. Mental note:to ask Mrs hudson or molly how I ended up having to take care of a big baby and be his babysitter while having to deal with his brother.
"shut up sherlock. I can't believe you—you promised me, mycroft and Mrs hudson you wouldnt — You WOULDNT, go back"
"SHERLOCK. JOHN. ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING."
"enough, we have a case to solve"
LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE. PATHETIC.
"just please help me"
————————————————————————
"of course he did Greg"
"OH LOOK I THINK I HAVE A LEAD. ALRIGHT"
Mycroft as usual, went on and on ranting on how ridiculous sherlock was when he was high. But why would sherlock care, he had solved a case. He wouldn't care. But for some reason, he had remorse in his eyes. He, was listening to mycroft, feeling bad. Either Something was wrong or someone had replaced my sherlock with a psycho. *MY* sherlock wouldn't care a thing mycroft said unless regarding a case. Other than that, no. Or, had sherlock come to his senses and had put aside all his brother rivalry?
I couldn't hold it back anymore. I cant lose anymore people. I can't. I wouldn't be able to handle it. After sherlock's first "death". After Mary's death. I can't.
John slowly went up the stairs with a huff. While going up he heard someone's voice
"y-you, got my name co—
well done, sherlock Holmes the genius, you've chased one of your only friends out. Well done.
Right, now that we have some privacy, what about we talk about jo—
Is it too long? Or too short? Idk. BTW I don't post often. So you might have to wait for a looonngg time before I post again. But I will definitely try to finish this fic. Oh yeah. Almost all of the chapters are in John's POV.
Oh, but I know you so ever want to talk about him or maybe even to him. Tell him how you fe—
"which you will obviously require my help in"
"whatever"
"NO ONE. IM JUST, THINKING ABOUT A CASE I HAVE"
"excuse me what did you just say to me sherlock Holmes? Youve just ruined everything and now you're asking me to shut up. I don't think so."
"GASP.THATS IT. HE. OH MY GOODNESS. I'VE SOLVED IT."
"god sherlock. You've been off your tits again."
"Please, your the pathetic one. ARGHH. OH MY GOD. SHUT UP. "
"no,john no please."
"sherlock, I'm worried. John keeps asking me to check on you. Did something happen?"
Hm, john. Oh John. You have som—
"WHAT. NO. WHY SHOULD I EVEN BE TALKING TO YOU. JOHN, WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME. SINCE SHERLOCK HERE IS EVEN GOING TO LISTEN TO HIS PROBLEM."
I was just wondering what had happened to my sherlock when he suddenly looked at me. He was literally staring into my soul. I started feeling something. His eyes were one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen (ngl, ben. Does have dang nice eyes.) I had a swelled up mix of emotions in my heart. I didn't know what it was. I dont want to know what it was. It was a good feeling. But it felt wrong for some reason. I didn't know why.
"mmm.. MURDERUR.. Zzzz. FRIEND... *continues to snore... *JERKS AWAKE."
"alright then, I'll be downstairs then. You better not shoot anything or anyone because I have a gun with me and I know where you keep the handcuffs."
"sherlock, John told me about you"
"sherlock, who on earth are you talking to?" Mrs hudson looked slowly at him from the stairs.
Oop, did sherlock have feelings for somebody, like a friend?
After Lestrade left, sherlock I guess you could say "treated" himself to a cup of tea. It would have been a treat if it didn't taste so bad. If only Mrs Hudson were here now or even—
Is he serious right now. We're having an existential crisis and this is what he cares about. You know, john—
John knew exactly what was going on. He dreaded every second that was coming. The second he was in front of the door, he already knew what to expect. Sherlock would be there, in a chair who knows maybe even tied up. With mycroft and Mrs hudson. Maybe mycroft's men there searching. And mycroft was going to tell him "it's a meth lab." Jesus. It's happening too often. Sherlock wouldn't stop. He just kept coming back. He was out of control. And he didn't know or do anything to stop him. Nothing.
“Serious relationship, less than two months. Beta male, most likely.” Sherlock squints, but no, that’s it. “You’re happy.”
It seems very likely.
John walks into a pub - the nearest one he can find, to go have a mix of whatever he can come up with and forget about all of it, just get some goddamned distance.
Sherlock isn’t certain what makes a person happy. What counts, and what doesn’t. “Doesn’t matter.”
Sherlock didn’t need to know this. He still doesn’t. He can simply ignore this information and Molly with it.
Sherlock simply says, “Well done.” It is both important to encourage Violet’s newfound enthusiasm for toilet training, but also to let it appear optional and not forced. Also, he finds the childish term rather annoying, but it is what they taught her at her playgroup. And John says teaching her to say ‘I urinated’ is a bit creepy for a two-and-a-half-year-old.
Mike prompts, “Sherlock, would you like to pick?”
Mycroft knows that John would not mention it so casually if there had been any danger to Violet at all, but still he frowns. “We should keep her away from all non-edible plant life.”
“Um, I’ll… shower.”
An hour later, John gives his client a break, walks over to Sherlock’s space, looks over his shoulder at his
he planning a second?
Mycroft glances up and says, “...if it pleases you?” Mycroft still sounds so careful when he talks during sex, but John loves making him say it.
They return to bed, purpose clear in John’s eyes. They crawl beneath the cool blankets, their bodies still radiating heat from the bath. John’s hands reach out to frame Mycroft’s face, and he leans in to kiss him like that.
He tries to distract himself from the memory by considering John’s atypical response to their conversation again. Sherlock looks over to see him.
He knows that with every try, every month he gets older, there is less chance of this succeeding. He cannot help but be aware of the increasing sense that he is trying for the impossible. That he is putting this strain on his body for no advisable, or even sane, reason.
As soon as he’s in his room, John runs a bath.
Sherlock was fidgety at dinner last night. Playing with the tablecloth, bumping over a glass of water. He was stopping and starting a story, then frowning at himself. Sherlock stayed around as well, lingering as if he didn’t want to go to bed yet. They sat up talking until after midnight.
Mycroft replies, “I have some minor incidents that could be investigated, yes. I will bring the files tonight. MH”
When he had first heard about Violet, Mycroft had not been certain that he could be a good parent to a daughter. It had seemed so foreign. But now that he has Violet, the thought of a son is just as strange. Mycroft does not know what to do with a boy. He realises that that is untrue - he raised Sherlock, after all. But as an alpha, Sherlock had quite a lot more in common with his wild, headstrong Violet. Not necessarily with a beta.
Then, finally, he can feel Sherlock moving in the up and down of near-so-near, and John sucks him hard instantly, then keeps it going until he can feel him pulse in his mouth and come into the condom.
“Let’s have a look then.” John stands by the mirror and turns so he can see the back of his knees.
He seems like a John. Steady, dependable. Not average, though. Not even close.
Or simply the desire for action - Sherlock can empathise.
She eyes him, and says, “I will tell you the same thing I did last time. No guarantees.”
Mycroft doesn’t need to ring the doorbell. Father is right there already, opening the door. “Hello!”
Sherlock nods.
He has been told that most children do sleep through the night somewhere earlier than a year. That Violet is ‘high spirited.’ Mycroft wonders what a different child will be like to raise. He only knows Violet, after all. And as much as he expects to know the practicalities for another baby, he wonders about his preparedness for the differences between them.
Mycroft pulls John into him as much as he can, then lifts his legs and holds John close like that as well until John shudders, orgasms, and slumps onto him. “Hmm…”
The feeling from his dream is giving way to tried and true images now.
Unfortunately several of the other contestants choose that moment to walk up to their location, ready for today’s flash challenge. Wiggins even shouts, “Hiya, John!” essentially forcing John to move away.
. He does not know why it is so very hard now, more so than last time. Then, he had been entirely uncertain as to whether he could carry a child, so why did it not feel this difficult?
“You do know how to keep it exciting, don’t ya?” Lestrade jokes.
Sherlock hands him a sleeping William, and Mycroft takes him in his arms, says, “Good night.” and walks out of the room, still feeling rather dazed.
Lucky.
It doesn’t take long but it feels too long, every hard stroke is a movement of pain-pressure-pleasure, spiking hard behind his eyelids. Sherlock tries not to think. Just to stroke, hard, again and again, until he bends over and he comes, hard spurts of it.
There are a group of men entering his flat next, too many to keep track of. They take turns and also try to get him off. Sherlock comes while thrusting into someone’s arse, but he barely remembers it moments later. Sherlock kneels and gives a blowjob to a smoker after that, someone in finance with a big cock that bumps the back of his throat at every pass. Sherlock drifts a bit, which is why when the man moves back, pulls the condom off, and ejaculates over his face, Sherlock is too slow to dodge it.
Mike tells them, “None of these tattoos can be placed below the waist, as that is considered offensive. Also please be respectful of the meanings and the designs themselves. You cannot alter them in any way.”
Mycroft looks up, stunned. It feels entirely bizarre to get such high praise from Sherlock. He answers, uncertain but willing to return the compliment to Sherlock as well, “Violet is being raised by all of us.”
“You’re gay?” Mary asks it sharply.
“Hm.”
Mycroft sinks down on the toilet in the cramped bathroom of Baker Street with a whirl of disbelief - it is too early. The caesarean was scheduled for mid-March. But yet this is undoubtedly occurring.
“Dizzy?”
He went to see his own room, because that is what one does, Mycroft supposes. It did nothing but project the utter helplessness Mummy must have felt about the both of them. She never did understand what she did wrong.
They halt just outside the studio doors, and Sherlock lights a cigarette for himself, then hands one along with the lighter to John.
It’s wonderful.
The thought that John could do that is impossible. Kiss him. It’s what Sherlock never thought might happen, or if it did, that he would feel John’s hands scrabble on his clothes, pulling them off. That it would be nothing but hard, too close flesh and mouths and John looking away in the morning. Sherlock had been ready to do that, once. To give that to John, if he asked for it.
John promised, John
Mycroft remembers the tests well from last time, and they are not any less invasive. Unfamiliar, gloved hands touch him. His blood is drawn, his body is scrutinised. He lies down on a paper-covered bench, crackling under his back as he moves. The doctor turns the sonogram machine on, puts the cold liquid on his bared stomach, and Mycroft, bizarrely, can feel a trace of panic.
The reply doesn’t come, so after another ten minutes John’s had it with his room and goes downstairs again. Sherlock is looking at his experiment as if nothing happened. In the zone, probably. John says, “Taking a shower.”
But John simply moved away.
Mycroft texts the details about the funeral.
He feels somewhat shaken and hides it behind gathering William’s nappy bag and dummy. Sherlock had proposed to take both children for a night, but Mycroft is not certain if that is a good idea right now. He eyes John, who seems to be waiting for a cue from him.
Sherlock hates this.
They get up when Mycroft comes to pick Violet up, but John can still feel it ebb for a while after.
Sherlock smiles proudly, John seems mainly impressed, and Mycroft feels a stab of gratitude for both of them that leaves him momentarily breathless.
He thinks that maybe he gets it. That Sherlock doesn’t want him to be there all the time. They’re already so close and they’re about to raise a new baby, too, maybe Sherlock wants some time to himself first. To relive the good old days when he was the lonely detective, too brilliant to bother with anyone else.
to be your lawfully wedded husband, to claim, have and hold?”
John hasn’t heard him make a single sound, either. Not a moan, or a sigh. John flicks his tongue over the joint between Sherlock’s shoulder and neck, bites, he lets his hands travel down to pull him closer, but he has to pull quite hard before Sherlock stumbles close.
In truth, Sherlock prefers to eat alone in his hotel room and to focus on the project at hand. But he can see how some social pleasantries might be beneficial for his future in the competition, so Sherlock says, “Yes.”
He prepares himself. He sees it before him as if it has already happened:
Sherlock looks at him, eyes wide in silent pleasure, his chest heaving. Then he shudders and suddenly stills as he comes - John can feel him pulse inside of him.
Ah. Sherlock clears his throat. “Clearly.” He’s always right about these things. That’s why interaction with others is so often entirely tedious. Sherlock sees through their motives before they themselves have bothered to consider them. Although John did make the effort to tell him he was right, which is... incredibly rare.
He crashes, after. He barely ate, barely slept, barely anything.
A couple of breaths later, Sherlock’s head re-appears in the doorway, he’s holding a single yellow bloodied glove, and frowning. “Is that unsatisfactory?”
No. Not that. John turns to lie on his stomach, pushes into his hand and the friction of the mattress, and tenses the muscles of his arse.
John walks out of the film studio along with Mary and Rosie, a white-hot haze around his head.
Yes, John remembers that case, but that’s been months. Sherlock never once gave the impression that he wanted to come here. Actually, John thought that he’d barely heard it, but hey, he’s not about to turn down a free meal. Especially when it probably costs more than a month’s rent. The menu doesn’t even have a price on it.
omega.
“Mycroft, hi, I’m not done...”
It isn’t until Lestrade calls with a case that Sherlock leaves the flat. If he can solve that, then maybe he is worth it.
Soo Lin answers formally, “We chose the deer skull because it has a lot of curvature, which is the opposite of the material we were given.”
It feels like yet another small betrayal to himself. Mycroft was going to suffer this alone, and then tell them the news as some benevolent entity:
John leans forward on the table. “You okay?” It has been quite the day. Maybe this wasn’t exactly what Sherlock had in mind when he imagined a wedding proposal? John tried his best to come up with something Sherlock would like, but it was bloody hard to be honest. John was a bit surprised at how long it took Sherlock to get it, too. Maybe it would have been better if it had been just the two of them?
Sherlock rolls his eyes – Mycroft already knows the outcome of all of this – and deletes both texts.
John’s never had that kind of money. He’s never owned a house, or a flat, or even a car. When they had one, it was Mary’s.
“You have two hours, and your time starts… now.”
Sherlock looks back at Mycroft and faces him. “Yes.” He adds, “Thank you.”
They go over to the crime scene. This one is a presumed suicide, but the note is obviously placed there afterwards, and Sherlock is now fairly certain these deaths are nothing but a vehicle to get the notes across. This one is written in pictograms, but not in hieroglyphic script. They’re neither hieratic or demotic and Sherlock, to his enormous frustration, can’t read it either.
John smiles. “Yeah, well, prepare, you’re about to have two.”
John can smell him again, omega. Strange, how he’s never noticed before. It’s very sweet. Mycroft holds out a pile of files. “That is all.”
John’s been put to the side and stored away.
It is only a vague imitation of a heat, but that does not mean that he is not embarrassingly wet.
them both. In whatever way he can.
First there’s the heartbeat. A fast rhythm that sounds good, John thinks. Strong.
“I’ll do the snake,” John says determinately.
That is, until John walks up to him, balancing a tray in one hand while leaning heavily on his cane.
Sherlock smiles at him again, seemingly happy that he came. The music is too loud to talk a lot really – John can see Mycroft wince as the dance instructor’s microphone screeches. Sherlock is looking rather pained as well. John can’t believe that William is
Even assuming that John would still find him attractive – or more likely that John is indiscriminate enough in his sexual partners to find any issue with him - Mycroft is not certain he can let himself be seen in that manner again.
As he remembers from last time, the hormones have a bit of an effect on his mood and body, but it is negligible.
“Three, two, one... Tattoo machines down!”
“Yes?” John comes closer. “I’m here, what is it?”
Finally, Sherlock moves forward, then kisses John’s cock again.
John.
Sherlock, somehow picking up on his thoughts, comments, “I believe they are in an alliance.”
So it is a privilege to be part of it.
Sherlock makes a mental note to focus on anything that came out after Violet’s birth. “The research might have changed.” That’s all he can do, that and bond.
No, Mycroft does not want to go through that ever again.
Sherlock hears it, but he can’t feel it. He can’t, not with John’s body this close. John might fall in love with her, if he hasn’t already. John might leave him for her.
to do this. But they are only days away from the wedding. Perhaps they should wait.
John checks his phone while Sherlock’s in the bathroom. One message, from Mycroft. “How is he? MH”
John moves up a bit, and Sherlock sits on the sofa next to him, then settles there, facing William.
Then he focuses on work, and exactly at the thirty minute mark he gets up and gets dressed.
Mycroft briefly looks at the sofa. No, his back is much too delicate to sleep there. It’s kind of John, but if Mycroft would attempt that now, he is not optimistic that he would be able to stand in the morning. “No, thank you.”
Sherlock looks him over, puts his cigarette down, and takes a breath as if he’s about to speak.
John leans in to kiss him. Or he tries to, he’s surprised Sherlock and it’s an awkward angle so it’s a quick hit of John’s lips hard against his.
They walk outside together.
“NO!”
John smiles.
Even now, he knows he isn’t good enough.
Molly takes the skull with her to sit down, and Mike prompts, “Janine, that means you are up next.”
They all go back, and Mycroft watches John and Sherlock dance together.
of John’s mouth, the slickness of it, the press of his tongue... Mycroft feels as if he entirely had forgotten what this is truly like. He is aware that he is shaking.
Mycroft sees it, the small flash of acceptance. He is grateful for it, more than she realises, perhaps. He says, darkly, “One could only be so lucky.”
Sherlock is sure of it now, and it’s stupid that he felt hurt at all, because there have been times where he bonded to Mycroft and had an erection, too. Mycroft does as well, they both know it. They don’t mention it, because it has no consequence. “You are.”
“That’s fine.” John says. “He’s just disappointed right now. He’ll get over it.”
Sherlock frowns at him. “What?”
Mycroft can only agree.
Sherlock turned around and asked John to fuck him. He tried to draw it out as long as he could. John tried to feel everything possible in that one go, every sliver of feeling.
Sherlock turns away again.
John sits up and tries to remember what day it is, but he’s not sure for a long moment. Then he remembers why Sherlock would be out with both kids - it’s Sunday and Sherlock’s bringing them to Mycroft’s.
Not enough to make him feel the need to leave work, but he stops by Baker Street to collect Violet early with the intention of putting her to bed on time. He manages that - to feed her, bathe her, and put her to sleep - before he is on his knees in front of the toilet throwing up the meagre contents of his stomach.
Violet walks around the table, then stops and stares at her grandfather.
Sherlock says to Mycroft, “Five months tomorrow.”
Violet’s concentrating on building a tower with building blocks, and Sherlock is sitting on the floor next to her and trying to keep the thing from falling over. Violet on her own is too uncoordinated not to make it fall, but she gets angry every time it does.
Janine replies, “I
“Feeling all right about it?” John asks Bainbridge.
Mycroft privately thinks that Henry will never have heard Mycroft being greeted like that. That no one other than John, or possibly Violet, ever does, with genuine delight in their tone and face.
John lights his cigarette.
Sherlock can only lie in bed at two in the morning, inebriated, and think that John’s sighs in his sleep are the most essential thing he has ever listened to. That if John would stop breathing, Sherlock wouldn’t be sure if he himself is a being anymore, or just drifting in this room as a spectre, a used-to-be.
John shakes his head. “People want to know where they come from. Who her other dad is, it matters.”
Right. “Not someone I’d, um, expected to have a kid?”
, surely. Or Mummy must have suspected at least. Sherlock says, “We didn’t come because Mycroft has a child.”
Sherlock smiles at him, a tad uncertainly. “Of course, John.”
Sherlock tries to get into his mind palace, and when that fails, he clings to images and simple thoughts - John’s eyes. John’s name as a chant, again and again. It works for a while, but then his hips jerk, his spine twinges, his penis throbs, and it’s gone. Sherlock turns on to his belly, fucks the bed, jerks his hips back and forth, hard, insane, crazed.
is Sherlock’s slightly sweaty hand in his. He sees Sherlock’s pale face and feels Sherlock’s deep eyes on him.
He’s got beans on toast, a nice cup of tea, and Violet’s quiet enough that John can actually hear Mrs. Hudson’s radio downstairs. It’s the nine AM BBC weather, and John can hear ‘expected sunshine’, but the rest of the words are too muddled to make out. John thinks that maybe once her hearing starts going a bit, she’ll turn it up, and he’ll be able to know what the damn weather will be for once.
When they walk out, John can see a smile on Sherlock’s face.
John seems happy with her, at least.
He looks back. “Yes?”
“Hiya.” He gets into the car quickly.
John’s voice stills, and he smiles an oddly anxious smile.
John sends an excited message, “I heard - good luck getting used to worshipping at the porcelain altar again. JW”
Mycroft sounds somewhat pleased with himself when he offers, “Merry Christmas?”
Once arrived, they put Violet in the stroller, and John, without question, sets to pushing it.
to be original next time.”
Sherlock smiles a genuine smile at that, then looks back at his project and asks, “What’s the drink average per guest for the main course, considering that we’re serving the white before the red?”
John walks into the church. St.Bartholomew The Great - adjoining the hospital - is the oldest church in London, Sherlock told him. It’s also slowly filling with people. He walks up to the front and meets their registrar, a stern-looking public sector worker. Neither of them were into the idea of a religious ceremony. They found her family dog for her when it was kidnapped a few years back, and she’d been only too happy to do it.
“Ah.” Mycroft smiles, pleased at the compliment. “It is a personal favourite of mine. A bit dry, perhaps, but it accompanies the salmon mousse exquisitely.”
John grins. “Good. Better be ready for that dance soon then, because I’m wearing my good shoes, here.” He looks down and shows off the shiny loafers.
John stares at him with growing unease until he decides, “You’re still sore.”
John nods. “Hell yeah.”
He pulls it out, presses it in again, and imagines another’s face, filled with love. Brimming with the need to come. Another’s voice, urging him on, “Yes, do it, please, I
John is looking around curiously. “You know, it’s exactly what I expected your place would look like.”
. Goddammit, he is. With this mess, this sheer
On the street, John’s eyes linger on a young woman. He glances at her legs, behind, and breasts.
Mike is there, talking over Rosie’s cries and Mary’s grip on his arm. “John, such good work. You surprised all of us with that last one, really solid-”
“Okay, that’s…”
John asks, into Mycroft’s ear, “You want to come in my hand, or my mouth?”
“Wiggins with Molly, and Sherlock with Soo Lin.”
Sherlock is, as well. John saw them again when he moved in and he opened the bathroom cabinet to put his razor in there. In-between the antiseptic and the paracetamol.
It makes Mycroft feel an odd sense of regret. Perhaps he had hoped that John would insist. “Yes.”
“A little easy, that. Going decorative.” Jim stares her down.
John escapes to the shower, but even when he’s all scrubbed down, Sherlock continues to eye him. John has no idea what it feels like to Sherlock when he comes home smelling like Sherlock’s pregnant omega. Part of him wants to push Sherlock’s reaction to it, and see if he can get him to turn angry. Hard. Wanting.
Mycroft knows that he will live on just fine. He has always known that no matter what happens, he will move past it, because if one moderates their emotions, then there is nothing that can truly destroy them. That has always been both his greatest strength and comfort. He knows that others might find that despicable, but it is true.
Sherlock opens the lock with shaking hands, and throws the door open.
Sherlock doesn’t give any indication that he’s concerned with John’s limp, and that suits John just fine. No, more than that, John
Sherlock notes, a couple of days before the third implantation, “You’re trying again soon, your levels are high.”
Mycroft makes his mouth loose and takes him in, just the tip, and rolls his tongue around. John’s hand settles on his shoulder, and Mycroft notes the tremble in John’s upper legs. He would like to take his time and endlessly linger, but John’s cock jumps up heavily, his balls are drawn, and John makes a sound, “
There’s still some snow in the park, although it’s looking grey and muddy by now. Violet thinks it would be good fun to play in it, John tells her no, so she has to have a bit of a cry over that, too.
anything, trust me.” They’re not having wild sex. Or any sex at all.
John had some idea that he’d have to remind Sherlock about when to get ready, but as he wakes up on Saturday, Sherlock is already dressed in black. John feels strange getting into his own suit. He’s not even sure why he’s going, really.
John flirts outrageously with women - he hardly cares who, they’re all wrong for him, he doesn’t even remember their name two seconds after they’ve told him. It doesn’t matter, most of the time he doesn’t get anywhere. Sometimes he does, some kissing, or a quick trip to hers. Some awkward, mediocre sex, and then he comes home and he’s glad to be back.
Mycroft glances in the room. A single body, contained.
“Sherlock and I are married now.” It makes John smile to even say it. “And I know you’re not… You might not want this, which is why I’m not one knee here, but...” John takes a small box out of his pocket.
, yes.
The probe connects with his skin, it pushes and presses, and there it is, the grey image Mycroft has gotten used to seeing in the past months.
Mycroft did his best to remind John that it was not simply for him. “He is my brother, John. And I believe that he has wanted this for a very long time.”
get him there, Sherlock isn’t sure. It feels like an interrogation –
John was asking it more to himself than that he was expecting an answer, but Sherlock says, “Relationships have never been either of our specialty.”
John laughs at the sight, a low, pleased sound.
Mycroft looks to the backseat, but both Sherlock and Violet are gone. John says, “We stopped at Baker Street, you missed it. Violet was asleep, too. Sherlock said he’s keeping her tonight.”
Sherlock jumps off his chair with a graceful thud and walks closer. Mycroft can tell what his intent is, and although he does not particularly feel the need to bond at this moment, it is pleasant enough. He feels the brief brush of Sherlock’s hand as he pulls his collar down, and then presses his lips there. Sherlock bites, very briefly.
Sherlock swallows. “Thank you.”
“It was the nature of the challenge that it was meant to be only about the animal,” Mike says. “Not a frame.”
this. Mrs. Hudson is in the hall, holding Violet, but Sherlock ignores her.
“Oh, definitely.” John grins. “Do you have…?”
Sherlock slowly raises his head. John spoke. He sounds upset. A heavy-set plumber Sherlock has never seen before is discarding a used condom and preparing to leave. A young man, Sherlock squints – a student of...  Math? Or Chemistry? Art, possibly - is waiting, already hard. But John seems angry, so Sherlock attempts to focus on John’s question. Is it enough? Sherlock doesn’t know. He always accepts them all until they stop coming. But yes, maybe? Sherlock nods at John, mostly to make him happy.
won’t be broken.
John looks at Sherlock, and yeah, it still stings. Almost, right? It’s what they almost had, between them.
Mycroft rolls his eyes. “Sherlock,
He cannot truly understand the love that the two of them share.
“It was a business card for MI6, with the contact information of the office of the prime minister.”
Their breaths are heavy between them.
Anthea is not taken aback by it, but she seems to hesitate before answering. “I was.” There is a brief moment of doubt, which is saying a lot for her. “I am not entirely sure that I can combine such a relationship with work, however. Children require a lot of care. I would need to... be present.”
“...Yes?” That can hardly be a revelation to him. Although Sherlock has never once in the last two decades remembered Mycroft’s birthday, surely he knows his own age and can extrapolate from there. “Don’t tell me that that fact holds any surprise to you?”
about everything around it. Never kissing, or hugging, John’s hardly allowed to touch him. It does feel like they’re together, but really, where’s the difference between ‘my mate Sherlock’ and ‘my boyfriend Sherlock’?
“If you feel the need…” Mycroft takes an official-looking business card out of his inside pocket, hands it to her, and gives her a cold smile. “Feel free to contact me through this channel.”
“Promise?” John smiles as well, drawing attention to his lips.
And John breathes. Then nods, and gives him a small smile. “You, too.”
One can do worse than to please the future Queen of Britain.
Sherlock nods.
Mycroft nods. Yes, he had already considered it.
. After a day, Sherlock and John bring them all down to Mrs. Hudson’s. As a result, her kitchen looks like a flower shop and she invites her knitting group around for tea just to see it.
“Three…” Mike surprises them by starting the countdown. “Two… one… Welding is over!”
Sherlock knows it’s just a matter of time before John takes the alternative, then. Before he tries to find it somewhere else.
as John’s arm brushes his chest.
She points at what she sees, where she wants to be, what she wants to eat, and informs them where it is with varying levels of yelling involved.
Sherlock can feel the tone hit him. John is irritated.
Sherlock knows that Mycroft will agree on that, too. If it were up to Mycroft, John will never sleep with anyone else again in his life. Sherlock has seen the anger in him when John dates.
On to the next, then.
Sherlock cried a little, unashamedly, as he held the baby to Mycroft’s face.
Mycroft takes a delicate breath on the other end of the line. “…I see.”
know what to ask. He types, “Can’t say for Sherlock, but I know what I want I’d like. JW”
Yeah, he’s trying pretty hard not to be an idiot right now, thanks. He wants Sherlock five ways to Sunday. “You’re sure you want to do this?”
, wow.” He groans a bit as he gets back to his feet. “Murder on the knees, though.” But he does not seem displeased in the least.
John looks at him. Then swallows, and nods.
By the time John looks up maybe-Sophie’s standing, with an annoyed expression on her face.
This soldier could take him in a fight. Last time, when he thought Sherlock was trying to grab his cane, his reaction was quick, sure, and aggressive. He’s shorter than Sherlock is, but Sherlock can feel the desperation radiate off him. This man could take anyone, and more than that, he would. He is
Sherlock slowly grins at him. “
Sherlock applies the stencil and pours an entire row of brightly coloured inks. He selects his tattoo machine, turns towards the client, and warns, “First line.”
But Sherlock isn’t done. When John is in his jacket, he leans down and, very carefully, kisses John on the cheek. It’s just a press of lips, more the thought of a kiss than a real one, but John stills, and looks at him with sudden love and fear warring in his eyes.
If Sherlock won’t swallow, John can’t blame him, but he
John strokes his cheek, and Sherlock turns his face to John’s hand. Sherlock opens his mouth, and on some instinct licks John’s hand to taste him. John gives him his fingers and sighs as Sherlock sucks them in. They feel full in his mouth.
He also takes a bottle of champagne, and a nice red. He knows that there will be alcohol provided, but he does not think that John or Mrs. Hudson’s taste will exactly run towards the enjoyable when it comes to finer wines. Or even the at-all-drinkable.
to kiss Mycroft, it was clear. “I said you could.”
There’s a whine in his ears. His heart thumps. Sherlock hits every spot just right - he curls his tongue over John’s glans, then sucks his cock with the perfect amount of pressure. John can feel Sherlock’s throat work, him tilt his head, and then Sherlock’s deep throating John’s cock like an absolute pro. Dear
, causing him to mumble, “Oh, yeah.”
John attempted to kiss him afterwards as well, but Sherlock had to leave before it became too much and he would spin outside of himself.
There’s a moment of silence. “You’d…” Sherlock swallows. “You’d name him after
The judges deliberate for less than a minute, before they announce, “The winners of the flash challenge are... Soo Lin and Molly!”
“William - he was named after you, then?”
“They were in love from that first case, it just took them a while to get here, but I think… Yeah, I always knew they would.”
John takes the tube there, walks, and then texts, “I’m outside yours, can I come in? J”
“Old school, me.”
John throws him a concerned look from where he is placing his own stencil onto his client’s back. This is
Sherlock glances towards the living room. John’s film might be done soon. “See you tomorrow.”
“You did not need to come, John.” Mycroft seems to say it as a kindness. He has a pinched look on his face.
John pulls Sherlock closer, pressing their bodies together. His heart thuds heavily in his chest. He wants this. He’s dreamed of this, fantasised, and he can’t, he shouldn’t, but... He tangles his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and
He joins John on the short walk to the hotel restaurant and once inside, they sit down at an empty table. There are some looks thrown their way that Sherlock pretends not to notice. In a way, this is reminding him of going to school. Sherlock remembers the cliques and the exclusion vividly. He spent years eating alone in a corner of the room there, too. This will be no different, he imagines.
John’s heart beats in his throat. It’s like being under a microscope, being studied like that. He’s got the uncomfortable feeling that this Sherlock is reading all of his rotten, half-buried thoughts.
Right. That’ll be it, then. “So have you ever...”
Maybe Mycroft would want John on his knees, and
John laughs. “It was. Brilliant.”
Sherlock takes his phone and calls Mycroft.
He never particularly disliked the thought of ageing. Mycroft always considered the increase in knowledge gathered by years lived to be much more valuable than the physical advantages his youth might have afforded him.
Mycroft is suddenly gasping for breath. He is distantly aware that these are the postnatal hormones making him feel emotional, but he is unable to prevent the tears. He feels an
Then,
Has this all just been him being in love with Sherlock, and Sherlock giving back what he can, but not quite… that?
John says, “No, Sherlock. Mycroft needs his sleep, too. That was a major surgery, he needs to recover. We’ll go in the morning.”
It feels somewhat hollow, at times. As if he is going through the motions of doing this. Mycroft does it all as perfectly as if he is being watched even when he is alone in the house. The thought is on his mind often, that if there would be a camera recording his every move, no one would be able to fault him, or think of him as anything less than an attentive parent.
He shouts, “I’m Bainbridge, hiya!”
All Sherlock can hear is John’s voice, charming him today, complimenting him. And then his own.
It is a sad, ridiculous fantasy. They have accomplished what they set out to do. They managed to allow John to connect with his unborn child, while relieving the stress of the constant haze of pregnancy hormones for Mycroft as well. But Mycroft has no sexual desires at all at the moment. So then what would he want from John? Everything else is still here. John’s concern, John’s humour.
So John doesn’t push it.
It feels… warm.
Mycroft feels a rather pronounced nervousness for the implantation. The sixth of January.
. “I believe so.”
Even Sherlock does not seem annoyed, as such, but still they do not have the sense of happiness that Mycroft had thought they would have.
But John must see some of the rising panic in his eyes, because he says, “Hey, this party’s just for us, right? It’s not…” John shares a look with Mycroft, then lowers his voice. “It’s not like last time.”
He walks through the hallway in evenly measured paces.
After less than a minute, Mycroft leans back, and John lets him.
Jim either feels his gaze or expects it, because he turns to look at him with a raised eyebrow.
John is alone with Violet for once.
“See you tonight.”
Mike commences the judging, “You put your own bodies on the line for this flash challenge. Let’s see how you did. Molly, you are up first.”
A woman with purple streaks in her hair is directed to sit next to him. She has a bridge piercing with metal spikes sticking out on both sides. Her neck and cheekbones are tattooed with a delicate network of black and grey flowers. She laughs nervously, tucks her hair behind her ears, and says, “Hi! I’m Molly. Molly Hooper.”
“You believe that he is clean?”
John slides in between the cool sheets of the hotel bed, and Sherlock joins him, turning off the lights as he goes. John can still hear the whine of the music in his ears. His body feels like it’s moving without him doing a thing.
John asks, on the way home, “You ever want to get one? A dog?”
“Ooh, what’s that?” Janine seems interested.
“I’m serious, what would it be, to you? Us, together?”
Mycroft swallows dryly. “I’m uncertain.”
Except for the packet of condoms on the bedside table, of course. The uncapped bottle of lube. The dried come stuck to John’s pubes, the bruised bite marks by his groin, the throbbing pain in his leg – he tried to kneel for a while there last night.
John takes a breath and gets up, because he can’t keep on looking at Sherlock like this. But he doesn’t go far, just to the living room, his chair. He takes a book, and starts reading.
And yes, sure, Sherlock himself probably can’t imagine feeling anything that way, but fuck it. Fuck it all, John’s tired from walking through frozen back alleys all night and from doing CPR for twenty minutes while they were waiting for the ambulance, and he’s
to, really.
Clearly. No self-respecting tattoo artist would tattoo in a shaded, dipped area.
Mycroft pauses on his way out the door. “Yes, of course.”
But then it feels too small somehow, because who gives that sort of thing?
- John leaves.
John eats dinner in his chair, balancing a plate on his knees, because of the green rabbit parts being spread all over the kitchen table. He watches some TV.
He makes his mind recite elements. He would think of the case, but he can’t focus enough for that now. All he needs is repetition, something to hold onto, something to separate the minutes and seconds into manageable bursts.
As he walks up, John wheezes, “How-”
“Sure.” John considers Mycroft. Did people constantly assume that he wanted kids, too? John somehow doubts it. He thinks Mycroft might have really shocked some people, turning up pregnant. It had shocked him, too.
It’s not his room anymore. It’s a parody of what Mummy thought her boys’ room was. It’s a re-creation of a thing that was never here. Something she did in her love for him, while she never really saw him.
“Ah, Sherlock.” He puts his phone away and accompanies him inside.
Jim wearing a Dolce and Gabbana shirt from this year’s fall collection with the sleeves rolled up, allowing them all a glimpse at the series of magpies he has tattooed on his forearms.
“A mortician?” John casually chats with her while they wait for them to set up the cameras.
She barely protests. John lets Sherlock tuck her in while he puts William down, then he grabs the duvet and shakes it out on the landing. There are clouds of plaster dust coming out of it. It’ll be good enough for the night, though.
Mycroft sighs. He would like to feel a stab of annoyance. In truth, he would feel more comfortable with himself if he did. He says, “Come in.”
“...Um.” John thought Mike might know the cigarettes weren’t for him, but he hoped it wouldn’t be quite that obvious. “Something like that.”
Almost normally.
Mycroft’s eyes seem to hold some pleasure, which is odd considering how exhausted he still looks. “You are unable to deduce it, then, Sherlock?” It sounds like a challenge.
promised Sherlock that he would stay, so he does just that.
John adds, “I just
She carefully says, “Thank you.”
Right then. Mrs. Hudson comes up to help with cleaning, because it’s a proper pig sty. John turns the heating up higher, then disinfects the kitchen counter and even wipes the sofa down a bit because god knows what’s in the flat.
It is the second time that John has called him
“Top tonight?” John surprises himself by asking.
John looks at all of them. Then at Mycroft, sitting next to him. John puts a hand on Mycroft’s leg and says, “Married life isn’t too bad so far, I think.”
“I will.” Sherlock seems sure of it.
Sherlock nods. He plays the music, adjusts the sound level, and takes his own shoes off. Then he puts a hand on John’s shoulder and one on his waist, and says, “I’m leading.”
John lowers his hand, and squeezes himself lightly through his trousers. It feels as if he’s getting away with something. “You’ll... watch?” Sherlock won’t do more, he assumes.
John reaches out and takes his hand, then tangles their fingers. “We did it, yeah? We figured it out.”
John slowly licks into his mouth. Sherlock lets him. It feels intrusive, he’s always hated kissing, but if this is what John wants then he can do it.
John faces him and says, almost conspiratorially, “It’s hard, I know. When Violet wakes William up again and it’s the both of them screaming away...” John shakes his head. “I fantasise about throwing them both out of the window sometimes, to be honest.”
Sherlock lies down exactly where he needs to, visibly relaxes, and John quietly warns him, “First line.”
, now.
Sherlock looks at Mycroft, who nods, then briefly disappears to his car. It takes a few minutes, but then Mycroft comes back carrying Sherlock’s violin case and the sheet music.
John closes his eyes. His mouth is opened. He is breathing fast, wordlessly slain by his pleasure.
Mycroft faces him. Sexual desire is a strong motivator, he is willing to concede. As is the idea that this might only be possible now he is still pregnant. The sheer selfishness of it is staggering, of course.
John strains to hear what Sherlock says next because Mrs. Hudson has asked Greg where they’re going exactly and is giving him advice about the slot machines, but the next thing he hears Sherlock say to Molly is, “...not even going to wear a bridal gown? Why not?!”
Sherlock has a perfectly good eye himself, and they both know it. But Mycroft is still feeling
Beds being moved outside.
She realises, and says, “So, you are here today for...?”
John walks fast, and goes into a random pub. The beer’s overpriced, and there are too many city boys in making noise, some tourists in the corner, but he barely notices. He drinks his pint quickly. Another after that. He hasn’t gotten drunk in a while, and if there’s any moment that deserves it, this would be it.
Less than a minute later, they turn back towards them and Mike announces, “The winner of this flash challenge is… Molly!”
Sherlock looks up him, then angles his head and pulls John off so he’ll come
He is late. They are working up to the Indian elections, and while that is not entirely within his sphere of influence, the people who control it should be. He has taken advantage of some quiet time to read up on tomorrow’s files - he is starting to learn not to take too much work home. Especially not if it is urgent, because Violet seems to be able to sense it on him, and then chooses those nights as the ones where she is awake more than should be possible for one that small.
Well, then. They did it. John smiles.
He walks out.
“...Janine. We loved your creativity and daring.”
After William’s birth, the wedding plans had been put on the back burner and Sherlock hasn’t had the time to play his wedding composition even once. Now, he straps William to his back, picks up his violin, finds his sheet music with the composition, and starts.
Their baby.
“Oh, I loved it!” Molly smiles at Irene with amateurishly disguised familiarity. “I love this image. It’s so suggestive of movement and dance.”
But John and Violet make him a crown - that Violet then insists on wearing herself all day. They sing him ‘Happy Birthday’ over a collection of lemon drizzle cupcakes brought up by Mrs. Hudson. Mycroft comes to collect Violet early, and he leaves an expensive bottle of cognac on the kitchen table and rare eighteenth-century sheet music on Sherlock’s violin case.
Sherlock turns towards the bookcase, quickly palms another 50mg mephedrone tablet, and swallows it dry. He needs this feeling to continue.
“Right... Yeah.” John’s face breaks, and he swallows. Sherlock, aware that this is a moment that John needs physical contact, offers his arms. John hugs him, quickly and tightly.
Then John stands, and Sherlock can feel an odd whirl in his stomach.
Mycroft can’t stop him from looking at Violet with gentle, curious eyes. Father says, emotion already clouding his voice, he sounds as if he might
Mycroft seems somewhat taken aback at that. He appears to consider it.
John ended it.
ending for all of them. He ends with a broken, hopeful note.
John knows him well. Of course he would assume that he can occasionally touch him.
“Here, got you a present.” John takes the pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and hands it to him. He tries, “It’ll, what was it? -
“No!” There seems to be something blurring his eyes, pressing on his chest, and burning in his nose, but he breathes through it.
Sherlock glances at him. “I’ll tell her.”
Sherlock jumps up, on trembling, floating legs, and stands by the door. He’s naked, but sweating. So hot. He presses his erection against the wood, licks his dry, chapped lips. “There’s nothing you can do.”
Sherlock feels a stab of panic. What did he do? Why did they let him?!
He has another sip of his drink, then meets Mary’s gaze.  “I’m sure.”
The last ones are of Sherlock and John dancing with William between them. The lights around them leave long trails of exposure on the image. They both seem relaxed. There is one where Mycroft is in the background, watching them with an unreadable expression. Sherlock studies it for a long time
But Mycroft looks at him with some resignation in his eyes. “Sherlock, if you feel that it is time for John and I to cease our…” he hesitates, “
Or not forgotten. Yeah, that’s a bloody lie isn’t it? John didn’t forget Sherlock at all. Not for a single moment since he came home. John can still hear the deep timbre of Sherlock’s laugh in his mind. Despite everything, John still wants… He has a long sip of his drink, takes a breath, then turns around and says, “She’s gay.”
John shares a quick look with Sherlock and Mycroft. Sherlock hesitantly gets up, so John does as well.
John takes a dizzy shower, three painkillers and a glass of water, and goes to work.
him, and this is what he did.
John hands them both condoms, which makes Sherlock feel cared for in an unexpectedly tender way. Most men are unreliable in their condom use. Quite often, they remove the condom when Sherlock isn’t looking, and continue without.
are right, together.
is a more correct way of looking at it. Mycroft swallows. “She does have very fair skin. I put sun cream on her before we left.”
More than that, Mycroft’s finally agreed to announce that he’s pregnant. Sherlock is sure that Mrs. Hudson already suspects, but it’ll be nice to see her reaction when it’s confirmed. Especially when she finds out that it’s John’s. She’s going to be over the moon.
Sherlock watched them kissing from the bedroom door and he could, oddly, feel his own heart jump.
For a moment, Sherlock is certain that he has gone too far yet again. But John blinks, and then breathes a huff of laughter. It is a surprisingly rewarding sound.
But Mycroft eyes him warmly. “I have not been accompanied to the park in many years.”
Sherlock joins them.
” The woman yells, but John doesn’t wait to hear the rest. He continues to the door behind Sherlock and Mycroft.
John takes a deep breath, eyes Sherlock, and then says, “Well, it’s mine too. The baby. I’m, ah, I was the donor.”
Sherlock squeezes harder. The faster he comes, the faster this is over. This burning, this longing…
Really, John’s starting to think Sherlock chose him because he could boss him around, self-important sod that he is.
Sherlock is not to blame for thinking that he can invade his personal space like that, not when they have been doing this for such a long time now. But Mycroft already feels such pressure on his body, such tenseness, he cannot stand another second of scrutiny.
“Hm.” Sherlock’s hand lands on his back, and John lies there, aware that it’s a cuddle, just a cuddle, on the sofa. Sherlock won’t want it to be any more than that. But it’s also an
John smiles briefly, sadly, and lets him go. “It’s fine.”
John could join them, but…
But the thought lingers.
There’s the sound of the sofa again. Squeak, squeak, squeak. The man’s arse is contracting rhythmically while he thrusts into Sherlock. The silence makes it all so earnest-sounding. It’s not even remotely funny, but John can feel a huff of laughter in his chest anyway. God, he loves this. He’s not sure why, but it makes something inside of him sit up and pay attention again. Something he thought he’d lost.
Monday feels like an extension of the weekend. They take Violet to look at the dinosaurs in the Natural History Museum, and she screeches with delight, runs circles around the exhibitions, and cries up a storm when they have to leave.
John sighs. “What do you want, Sherlock?” He sounds sad.
For a moment, John thinks to say, ‘Yes, an alpha girl, seven months,’ but he doesn’t. “No.” The next question would be whether he’s got a partner, and he could say ‘my boyfriend just asked me to marry him.’ Which is so bizarre, all of it. So John looks at the patient, and says, “No, it’s just me.”
Raz is up next. He’s looking like he’s expecting the worst. John can’t blame him, especially when his
Like the baby is theirs, and not his.
John sits down, grateful for the end of the spinning.
But John says, “I need to remind myself, too.” He glances at him and grins. “That it’s not all been some weird dream.”
Sherlock knows he reeks. He’s soaked with sweat so much that his hair sticks to his forehead. He can see Mycroft from the corner of his eye. He stays silent.
, actually.
Sherlock waves it off. “Something small that you know would please Mycroft as much as it does you.”
John can’t imagine life without Violet, now.
It’s true. Mycroft can smell him, as he always can, but there is nothing like the pulsing urgency of a heat there. Or, actually, Sherlock does smell slightly different. Sweeter. Mycroft wonders about it for a fraction of a second before he realises that it is the scent of a bonded alpha. He has simply never smelled it on Sherlock before.
You think so?”
“John, we can be…
“It’s fine.” John laughs a little. “I was startled, that’s all. Go on.”
Hah. Sherlock eyes him.
“I guess you’re right.” John thinks it through - inappropriate affair in the army, some women back at home, falling for Sherlock but marrying Mary, then this. “God, you are.”
So truly, it is unimportant.
Sherlock’s mouth feels a bit dry. His heart is pounding. It feels like it should be a momentous thing. Something important, and not just something that happens in the middle of the living room because John is curious. But it doesn’t matter.
He wonders at himself, too, how naïve he must be to allow someone to see him in this state. He is undoubtedly grotesque. Marred, swollen and altered by the child growing inside of him.
Sherlock reads Mycroft’s message, then says, entirely seriously, “John, he might not want to have sex again.”
“I was just...” Molly looks behind her in the corridor as she searches for an acceptable lie.
John takes Mycroft’s hand while he tells Violet, “Yes, we’re nearly there. You can push the button for the lights.”
But Molly’s eyes are knowing. They always are. Sherlock makes certain to smile and appear all right.
Sherlock didn’t predict this, not today. But his body is washed recently, and he dressed in expectation of seeing John. So maybe he did think it was an option, maybe he has spent years predicting it and he never noticed. It seems plausible. Sherlock’s hands feel slower than they should when they touch his shirt buttons and try to open one.
Sherlock looks at the way John’s holding William, and his eyes turn soft. He comes closer.
John can still feel the weight of Mycroft’s cock on his tongue. He can still taste him, too. Smell him in the back of his nose.
John does not acknowledge him, so Sherlock attempts to focus on the challenge itself as well. He is already beyond exasperated by the nauseating smell of the markers, as well as their crude effects on the car. It is an utterly pointless challenge.
“Have you experienced a heat since your pregnancy?”
They leave for the church.
“Doubt it.” John eyes him. He still seems utterly at ease with the suggestion of violence.
A hand job is hardly a life changing event. Nor was the fuck the week before - it wasn’t special at all. John imagines people are fucking behind closed doors like that all over London. Endless cluttered flats with kaleidoscope-eyed pale men, looking at him with sharply intelligent gazes, as if they
Together they managed to get John on the sofa. Sherlock passed Violet to Mycroft and let them go. He took John’s shoes off and put a blanket over him.
, oh, the sound…
“What do you fancy?” John licks his lips in an unconscious gesture of hunger that makes Sherlock’s stomach feel tight as well.
Neither of them had heard anyone approach this time.
Sherlock can feel the sentiment infiltrate his mind.
When her cries are so loud that they fray his nerves, so terrible that he would give everything for just a moment of silence. Just a breath, so he can go on.
So John has to either get used to the constant crying, or be an even bigger arse than he already is. And he doesn’t hate it, most of the time. She smiles, now. Besides a rather prominent nose, Violet doesn’t really look much like Mycroft, but there’s something familiar about her anyway.
But what to give them this Christmas? It has been a rather extraordinary year, Mycroft is aware. He wishes to give them both a gift that recognises their importance, but Mycroft knows that something too grand is neither expected nor wanted.
Mycroft assumes that there is little doubt about his arousal - his erection is lying flat on his loose stomach, red and hard. He had intended to open his legs like this for John in order to celebrate the lack of his pregnant stomach in the way, but Mycroft can feel the urge to turn around, and to let himself be taken. Mycroft pulls away and turns, feeling the deep steady thrum of desire. Yes, this is what he wants from John tonight.
There are flowers everywhere. They received a grand total of twenty-three bouquets as gifts, and they are mostly annoyingly
“...Ah.” Sherlock looks like he has been slapped in the face. He takes a breath and says, “The competition was rigged from the beginning, I merely -”
John can’t feel this the way he does - Sherlock does know that. John is not Mycroft’s alpha so he doesn’t feel all of this, but he should understand some of it. This is John’s child.
They’re good, really. More so now than they’ve ever been.
Sherlock says, “I met John Watson on the twenty-ninth of January two thousand and ten. I did not know yet that he was the man of my life.”
Except that’s not who Mary was, either.
“Yes!” Violet climbs off the sofa and immediately walks over to the bookcase to select a book for Mrs. Hudson to read to her. “I want the bears story. Or the parrot.” As she is browsing, she says, sounding surprisingly adult, “Or the trains would be good. I enjoy trains.”
Sherlock is surprised to see that more than thirty minutes have passed when Anthea comes in and says, “My apologies, but the minister has been on the line all morning.”
John drops the fourth doll he’d been trying to put away while avoiding the stray Coco Pops on the carpet, and he goes to the hallway. Sherlock is there, carrying a baby carrier with - so wrapped up he can only see a sliver of his head - William.
They all end up working straight through lunch. John eats while he sketches, taking a bite out of his sandwich with one hand, pencil in the other.
“No.” Sherlock says it plainly. No, he is not ready for this.
John doesn’t see Mycroft more than a couple of times a week, but they text several times a day now.
It’s a strange question, because Mycroft has little context for it. Mycroft cares for Sherlock - he always has, with both a deep protectiveness and endless frustration. He has believed that to be love and it is, undeniably so.
Great.
He wakes up two hours later, still sitting upright in a chair, with a pile of files spread over his knees, a crick in his neck, and the thought that he needs to feed Violet.
He gathers all the empty bottles to one side, the glasses to the kitchen, and then finds, under the living room table, the envelope that Mycroft left for them. It has both their names on it, written in Mycroft’s thin, swirly handwriting that John hasn’t seen anyone use unless they’ve followed a calligraphy course of some sort.
John asks, muffled by the pillows, “You better now?”
The one who is fucking him finishes, and the rhythm falters. He pulls out. But then Sherlock looks back, and there is the Starbucks employee, ready to replace him. It is good, so good. So is the sweet slide of John’s mouth. Sherlock leans forward in order to make the man’s cock hit his prostate. His thrusts are sloppy, but the mephedrone and GHB rush through him and Sherlock eagerly alternates between John’s mouth and the cock inside of him hit-hit-hitting where he wants it the most. He curls himself around John’s head, the man behind him holds Sherlock’s hips hard enough to hurt, thrusts just right, and Sherlock tumbles into an orgasm.
John doesn’t try to open it again.
He has Violet. Her smiles. Her eager chatter. Her outstretched arms. Her voice, when she,
Sherlock has seen Mycroft’s gift to them as well - Mycroft cancelled every single expense for the wedding from Sherlock and John’s accounts and, presumably, paid them out of his own account instead. Sherlock hasn’t said a thing about it, and he’s not sure if John will ever notice, of if he will just assume it all paid.
John’s heart breaks for Mycroft, though.
John sits in the back of the car, next to Mycroft.
Mycroft does not send anything back, more because he does not know what to reply than that he does not want to. He does sleep for a couple of hours in one of the rooms that are equipped with a bed at MI6. In the morning, he freshens up and goes straight back to coordinating.
But not as good as John holding his hand afterwards.
John uses his other hand to trace between Sherlock’s legs, to cup his balls, then to stroke his stomach.
Sherlock gets up and wanders to the living room, so John texts, “Told Sherlock I’m coming over tonight. JW” Just in case Mycroft’s wondering. It seems like the thing to do, anyway. Tell him.
Only the feeling.
It takes a few minutes where the judges talk into the cameras. Afterwards, they return to inform them, “Today’s winner is…” Jim grins widely. “Janine!”
John has to rephrase it. “Yes.” He looks at her. “I am. Definitely.” He laughs a little. “ It’s just…” He thinks about a way to save it, but he can’t, so he runs with the truth, “Um, me and my flatmate,”
The line dies, and John waits.
“Right.” John pulls back the covers and sits up. “Right.” He takes his pillow.
Sherlock doesn’t pull away, thank god. He actually looks sort of pleased.
The regret is bitter in his mouth. Sherlock was out of his mind with it, John could see the pure panic on Sherlock’s face, and still he tried to convince him to do it. Because it might help, yeah, sure, but the truth is that John wanted it. That he thought that for once, he might get to do it. Because Sherlock couldn’t help himself.
Sherlock is holding a glass of water and a painkiller. “You have a headache.”
John groans – Sherlock’s
Mycroft says, “Ah, old habits die hard, John.”
Mycroft is helpless as the pressure builds. He groans, something low and guttural. His testicles draw up painfully hard. He spasms around the knot, pulls it in, and all of it – the dildo filling him and stretching him, John’s teeth claiming him - erupts into an overwhelming wave of orgasm. Mycroft can feel himself shake wildly as the wave reaches its peak, and then his ejaculate sprays himself, the bed, and his stomach. He falls down, his knees unable to keep him upright anymore.
Sherlock’s never really thought about it. He always assumed that Mycroft doesn’t date because he doesn’t care. “You could.”
him. Shut him up. Make Sherlock swallow it all down and like it, too. John shudders, and his come stripes the bath. It drips from his hand and spreads with the water as he gives it a last couple of strokes.
To a certain point.
Sherlock knows that John is trying to tell him it’s okay. But it’s not.
Mycroft moves Violet to his other arm, and in reply she weakly punches his chest and says, “Faaaaahh…” again, obviously fed up with all this hesitating.
Mycroft can feel himself getting aroused at the thought, but he refuses to get up and deal with it, not like this. “You paint a graphic picture. M”
John remembers feeling so bloody
“And... done!” The five hours are over.
Ah! They’re so boring, these normal people. Of course Mrs. Hudson would be so pleased about this, another one to come along and be normal. Aren’t there enough yet?
And John has to shrug. “I hope so?”
Mummy often laughed at it. She made little remarks such as, “Oh, you can see Mykie’s an omega. You can’t leave that baby alone, can you?”
Violet is in the kitchen, toddling around the nanny’s legs as she’s cleaning up their evening meal. Mycroft says, “Good evening.” And “Hello, my Violet.” He lifts her and holds her for a long moment. He smells her hair, the scent of her - toddler,
But, of course, John has had sex with Sherlock as well, which is a fact that Mycroft prefers not to think about in any depth. Mycroft tells Violet, “We’re going home, is there anything you want to take with you?”
John is quick to agree and reassure him, but it does not matter.
John types back, a little clumsily. “Good right now, I think. Surprisingly. JW” Who knows what it’ll be later, but whatever this is right now, John’s unwilling to let it go.
With every breath in, it becomes easier.
They assign the burn on the lower leg to Molly, and the chest scar to Janine – Bainbridge is in an alliance with her, Sherlock suspects. They are from the same shop. Wiggins receives the childhood scar, then John the central line scar. Soo Lin will have to work with the stretch marks, which means that… the woman at the very end is directed towards Sherlock.
It wasn’t really sex, but it was something near to it, certainly. Sherlock was there as John’s partner, as someone who is allowed close by. And then when John spoke to him...
Mycroft smiles at him, distantly. “Oh, I would rather leave. But I believe one only has to attend their mother’s funeral once, so onward we go.”
Sherlock fires his blowtorch with a dramatic hiss. “Care to
And Sherlock agrees, with a serious expression. “I’ll be here.”
“Yeah, me too. I wasn’t thinking. Um. Sorry.”
He sits down with a glance to Violet. She seems fine. John is holding her securely. Mycroft says, “Is there anything I can do for you, John?”
Mrs. Hudson comes by to hoover, and Sherlock nearly talks to her, but he can already imagine what she’ll say - that John definitely loves him, that of course he’d be happy with anything. Which isn’t true.
John doesn’t know, sometimes. What he’s doing. Why.
He waits briefly in the waiting room and eyes the posters. The model of an omega giving birth is still there in all its anatomically correct glory.
Oh. John would have been much better suited to the colour work. Then again, that is likely the point of Molly’s choice, Sherlock assumes. She probably believes that the deep and warm colours will be a challenge for him to tattoo. She is not entirely wrong.
Sherlock lets John chat to them, and goes down to Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen. He doesn’t know why it’s hard to breathe, all of a sudden.
Mycroft walks in and asks Violet, “Did you have a good day?”
Sherlock sits up straighter and eyes Mike. Will he have won? His work was the best of the day of course, but…
John tells him, “It’s
And then they’re up to John. He’s not nervous - it’s solid work, and he knows it. Mike looks at the tattoo and comments, “I think you absolutely understood what the challenge was and didn’t overdesign.”
John’s loathe to admit it, since it sounds like such a messed up idea, but Sherlock was right to suggest it. An open relationship. John doesn’t even really know what that means. And he’s pretty sure that whatever Sherlock and him are doing isn’t the traditional way to do it - real couples have sex, don’t they? Or at the very least touch each other every once in a while. But hey, it works. That’s the point, it works.
Mycroft still has the back piece today. Sherlock doesn’t know why he didn’t simply have it lasered afterwards. Sentiment, maybe. Or glib satisfaction. Does Mycroft congratulate himself daily for Sherlock’s most recent sober streak? Likely.
