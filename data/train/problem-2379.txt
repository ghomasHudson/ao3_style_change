Lying in bed that night, Dean knew he wouldn’t get any rest at all. He’d been waiting downstairs while Grace had been with Cas. He might have gone upstairs himself if it hadn’t been for Michael, asking him to give his brother some space.
“No worries man. I’m always a bit late, gotta keep my reputation,” he added with a grin and a wink and then hastened away before he could embarrass himself even more. What the heck was that? Did he just flirt with a total stranger? He should be thinking about C! Or at least his own class.
Dean didn’t even look at her, his eyes stayed glued to Emma so he had an excuse not to indulge Lydia in whatever this was.
Thankfully, Cas seemed in no rush to pull away from him, his hands buried in the lapel of Dean’s coat, holding Dean just as close.
Beaming up at him, Gracie finally untangled herself from him, focus shifting to the parcel in her own hand. Dragons safely resting in his lap, Dean watched as she began ripping away the wrapping paper. The moment the first part of the gift became visible, she gasped in excitement.
“Okay, good answer,” Dean admitted, leaning in for a quick peck to his lips if only to show him that that would never happen again. Though he didn’t let himself get distracted from this topic all too easily. “Still,” he went on. “We’ll have to do something about your reckless behavior in the future. Running out in the middle of winter dressed like this? Driving through a snowstorm while drunk?”
However, Dean was distracted as well, still looking at the arm, so it took him a moment to realize that Cas was beginning to panic. Right away, he tried to catch his attention to calm him down.
They’d all gotten lists with the competitors beforehand and were talking about them now. Dean’s name was already switched out for Cas’ – Taylor was nothing if not thorough, even though Dean had no idea how he’d found out about Cas joining. Maybe he had cameras in Luke’s diner?
There was no reply and the words stayed on his arm before they vanished twenty-four hours later. Unread.
Dean had been so sure to know how Cas would react. At least to some degree. He had suspected he might be a bit miffed on account of the secret recipe thing. Certainly surprised, yes. But he had also thought that
For whatever reason, Cas broke into hysterical laughter, stumbling even further. Dean followed, always staying close enough to reach him should Cas really fall. By now, they’d made it to the side of the barn, which lay more protected from the snowy storm.
“This is the first time he’s been back in a while, isn’t it?” Harry added before Dean had a chance to answer Alice.
“So, just to be clear,” Cas began and Dean gave him his almost undivided attention… there was still a very nice hand on his pecs and it felt so damn good. “You were never interested in another man?”
He was out of his line of sight too quick for Dean to really take him in fully, and all Dean really noticed during these few seconds was the stoic face Cas was keeping the whole way.
“If this is supposed to be a joke, it’s not funny,” he said roughly as he led Cherry back to where Cas was standing.
“You seriously don’t get it, do you?” Cas asked, finally not yelling anymore. His next words cut deep, nevertheless. “You’re straight, Dean! And I’m into men. I have been my whole life and for even longer than that, I’ve been into
Dean loved teasing C. They’d been communicating for close to five months now and by now, he was pretty sure he knew all the basics about his soulmate. While he didn’t know where they lived or exactly how old they were, comments like this at least told him that they were still in some kind of educational area. His best guess was college or university and Dean sometimes spent hours picturing C at a campus somewhere, nose stuck in a book, being all studious and clever.
The knock on his door was insistent, telling Dean that there was no way for him to evade whoever was behind it. His money was on Eileen but before he could even get up to open the door and politely tell her to please leave him alone, his daughter’s voice spoke up.
He heard his brother’s words but fought against them reaching his mind – really reaching it. He already knew, in his heart, that they were true.
And then there was the fact that Cas had outright told him he didn’t hate him. Never had. And Dean had believed him back then. How could he not? Cas wouldn’t just say something like that to make Dean happy, right? That made no sense at all.
Maybe it was all in Dean’s head, yeah. Maybe it didn’t mean a thing - mostly because Cas was with this Zar guy - but for Dean, something had changed. Nothing huge, nothing tremendous. But still,
Untangling himself from Dean’s embrace just enough, Cas turned in his arms. “Well then,” he replied and the love in his eyes had Dean breathless. “I guess it’s decided.” Dean felt a soft kiss pressed to his neck as arms wound around his middle to pull him closer. Still unable to fully breathe, Dean got lost in Cas’ eyes and in that beautiful smile that spread all over Cas’ face. “There seems to be no better author than Vonnegut.”
The ladies went back to the task of baking Angel Cookies - after he recited the legend the Shurley’s kept about them one more time, of course - and Dean stared down at the photo on his phone.
Safely back home, Dean made his way to the main house with dread in his bones. It was Sam who greeted him as soon as he walked through the door and Dean mentally prepared himself to block every attempt at any kind of talking – he did not need nor did he want a pep talk and was in no mood for any type of intervention or heart to heart. Instead, his brother surprised him by wordlessly pulling him into a hug.
“Uhm, they met during Sunday dinner over at the Shurley’s. Well, they had met before but I think that was the first time they got to talking. And, uhm…” Dean needed to really concentrate on what he was saying or else he would just ramble on and on about the man. “I guess, their friendship really became solid when they, uh, when they entered the annual snowman competition together.”
Cas had always been one of his best students. Given that, Dean should have known that he would not come unprepared for their little battle of wits.
Ignoring the disappointed tone, Dean simply ended the phone call and turned back to preparing dinner.
Yet, after a moment of looking around and shaking the cobwebs from his mind, Dean had to realize that the room was indeed empty and so was the en suite, the door far enough open for him to see that there was no light on and no movement in the dark.
and then nothing but silence. Silence and the wind howling around them and their heavy panting as they breathed the same air.
Dean’s smile grew tender as warmth spread through his veins. With a knuckle under Cas’ chin he lifted it so he could easily kiss him. He had a feeling that Cas still felt vulnerable, despite all his reassurances so far. Still needed
In a stroke of genius, he fished Bobby’s keys for the truck out of the bowl by the door, forgoing his own car.
“Cas, wait,” he called out, but there was no reaction to be seen and Dean could feel his irritation building.
It was the comment stuck on repeat in his mind, over and over and Dean felt like throwing up. He felt… he felt so fucking
“No. No, it’s not okay. I was supposed to protect you from all of this. You shouldn’t ever have… I thought… I thought I’d been able to hide… I never wanted you to–”
They had started back up the steady stream of conversation the moment Dean had stepped into his apartment, only interrupted once when C had been on their way home as well. They came back with a very interesting thought.
“Okay, next round’s on me,” he heard himself call out before his mind would drive him crazy. He needed time to think about this realization and in the middle of a happy family gathering was certainly not the moment to do so. “Just a refill for everybody or something else?”
Just like in a bad movie, the guy seemed to remember at the same moment, holding out his own hand, making them smack together. At least, it had them both chuckle, even though Dean’s laugh was coming out rather like a nervous huff of air.
“Well, have you ever considered he might just be … don’t know, trying not to lose his face in front of you again?”
Since it's Christmas Eve - the time we here in Germany exchange our gifts - I thought it fitting that I hand out a present to you as well 😍
She had adored him from the first moment they met. They connected in ways Dean knew had nothing to do with him. Had nothing to do with Gracie’s wish for her dad to find someone again. Gracie and Cas were friends and that wouldn’t change, no matter how the story between Dean and Cas continued.
He smiled at how sweet she was when she added a, “Thank you,” squeezing him in a vice-like hug before adding a kiss to his cheek. Cas received the same treatment before she finally went back to her little camp.
He could see Cas was hurting - but so was his daughter now, because Cas was acting weird. He was so damn conflicted between whipping Cas in shape to go and make it right with Gracie; and pulling him into a hug to soothe him and whatever pain he felt.
Once they reached the cars, they hugged Sam and Eileen good night, talking quickly about their plans for the weekend. Sam had promised to take Gracie to tomorrow’s event at the fair, but they wouldn’t participate in the ice sculpting. Instead, Dean had promised they could practice once more for next week’s snowman contest – the only important event at the fair, in his eyes. Besides the ballet, of course. He loved that Gracie still wanted to team up with him, relished it for as long as it would stay this way. One day – that Dean hoped to be far, far in the future – she might think it “so not cool anymore” to do stuff like that with her old man. She would probably be joining with her best friend – or worse, with a
statement was finally able to pull Dean out of his thoughts, even letting his head peek up a little. He watched as Cas first spelled out his new last name, and then showed Eileen his name sign. A sign often given to friends and family by deaf people so they wouldn’t always have to spell out their complete names. Did that mean Cas had a friend in the deaf community?
Not that he had been thinking about much else these past few days. Not that he would be able to think about much else after this conversation.
Turning around, Dean saw that it was their turn. They put in their order and managed to handle all the mugs just so while making their way back. It was the weird atmosphere that suddenly gave Dean the feeling of walking right into a nightmare. It had gotten somewhat quiet around their area, except for two voices sticking out very clearly, and very tipsy.
“Hey, look,” he replied, lifting his hands in defense. “I know the guy publishes in your family business.”
His friend followed him soon enough, handing him a beer, and sending him a look that practically screamed, “This conversation isn’t over!”
Not wanting his daughter to sound impertinent, he softly flicked her in her back where Cas wouldn’t see it, and added a soft, “Gracie,” in warning.
“Of course,” Dean easily replied, leaning in to press a kiss to Cas’ temple. “Plus, I didn’t think it would be fair to put you in that position without talking about that thing between us first. I didn’t think you would want to be seen with me like that; in a compromising situation, you know?”
He understood it then, what Alice had told him. Love wasn’t black and white. It didn’t matter what happened then - because it was
Dean chuckled and at last, leaned back, letting his eyes adjust for a moment, never looking away from Cas’ wonderful blue ones. They were filled with warmth again, with happiness but also with wonder and maybe even an ounce of restraint. Dean was still cradling his face and when Cas closed his eyes and leaned into the touch for just a moment, Dean was sure he knew what the wonder and the restraint were about.
“Mhhh,” Michael replied with an agreeing nod, his own smile dancing over his face at the memory. “Only time we ever really fought.”
“Ohhh, right, the Christmas Cookie Fundraiser,” she exclaimed and Dean seized the moment, taking a fork and stealing a piece of the pie in front of his girl as he answered her.
With Cas in his arms, snuggled firmly to his side, he watched the scene with a serene smile on his lips. For years now, he spent New Year’s Eve at the Shurley’s; always welcome, always a family friend; like a son to Chuck, like a brother to Michael, maybe even to Gabriel.
They had been lucky that Dr. Richardson made it to the ranch before the snow really picked up, possibly keeping her from making the trip out here at all. As it was, the vet was already by Ruby’s side, ready to assist the birth and until then, working to keep her calm. Dean was prepared to step into the bay as well, should she need a second pair of hands.
Overcome with a new wave of emotions, Dean had to look back down at the book so Cas’ gaze wouldn’t burn him. Wouldn’t lead him to do something tremendously stupid… like kiss the guy in front of his entire family.
“Whoa, calm down,” he therefore told his friends, a bit more serious now. “Don’t worry. The secret is safe with us. And hey, we’re basically family, right?” he added, still grinning in a feeble attempt to keep the light mood. There were bystanders all around them, after all, as well as his kids.
No one was in the mood for a normal Christmas morning and since presents had already been exchanged the night before, there wasn’t even that. Dean hinted to Gracie that there were more waiting for her if she wanted to open them, but she simply shrugged her shoulders and mumbled something about rather going back to the stable and to Shiv.
! He was so damn sorry and all he wanted to do was hold Cas and warm him up and make his pain go away.
“Ohh, I actually have,” Gracie told him, pulling at his hand to make sure his attention stayed on her instead of Dean… or the surroundings, really. “We had Sunday dinner at the Shurley’s again and their aunt is here for the holidays and she made these
“This is the Sumerian Mother Knot.  This abrogates the power of all the gods that came before, including the Sun and the Moon; the Sky, and the Earth, and the Darkness.”
Back in the shadowed corner of Dean's bedroom, tears leak from Castiel's eyes, and he so wants to appear to Dean, and take him into his arms.  Fill the room with light and whisper into his ear “It's alright Dean.  I'm here.  It's OK.  That's not real.  It's not real.  It never was.  It never will be.  I'm here, with you.  Always, with you.”
“They tell me ‘Forever.’  They tell me ‘Always, Anything.’  They tell me every, perfect, thing.  They take such good care of me.”  A tear leaks down from the corner of Castiel’s eye. “I love them so much, Dean.  I love them so, so much.  Do you think they understand?  Do you think they know?  What if they don’t know?”
“‘Course, Cas,” he says rough, low, and rolls them over from their sides until Castiel is pressed beneath him.  “Castiel, “ he says again, and combs a hand into Cas’ hair.
It drops an octave, grows rougher, deeper, fades into the roar of the waterfall when Castiel's hands, slick and shiny with Dean's own oil, reach down to spread himself apart. “Cas,” He groans again.  “Cas, God...you.”
Dean collapses.  A heavy, black door slams down over his vision of the cabin.  He can't see it. Then he can't remember it. Then everything is black, only black, and his heart is fluttering in his chest because he is afraid that Alistair will come down off the platform and see him, soon.  Want him.
But it does look scared; it’s trembling and chirping softly and distressedly where it is hiding behind Dean's foot.  He waves at it, sheepishly, noticing that his sock has a hole in its big toe.
“Will you kiss me tonight, Cas?”  Dean asked, his lips pink against the green stem, his teeth white, his cheeks blushed.  His hair ruffled by his hands, by the wind.  Strands golden, with the flare of the sun behind him.  He was too beautiful to be real.  He was too beautiful to be denied.
But:  “No!” Dean says again, and Castiel is afraid that the chain of “No”s will start up afresh, but now more exhausted, Dean’s eyes tired and red-rimmed as he chants “No,” to himself.  A worse chain of nos, a sadder, weaker one, because Castiel has failed his first promise. A chain of nos that deteriorates, into a terrible future, where Dean is too broken from his time in the Pit, and is lost.  And all is lost, with him.
with lust.  Dean shivers.  He has imagined, too.  It didn’t compare, to this.  It was only a shadow, as much as he wanted, and as long.
But Castiel imagined it the other way, too, sometimes, if a hunt went bad and Dean lashed out at him.  The way where, when his lips touched Dean’s, Dean’s body became rigid against him.  The way where Dean pushed him away and yelled at him, “What the hell, Cas?”  He would be angry.  Not because Cas kissed him, because he wanted that too and could never deny it, his lips and eyes and prayers had given him away far too many times for denial.  No, he would be angry because Cas broke the covenant that he clung to desperately, where they pretended like they didn't have a love between them that could split open the earth.  A love he was afraid would swallow him whole, grind him to pieces when the earth closed up around them again.  He would be angry that Castiel had taken away the covenant that was keeping him safe, keeping the earth solid beneath his feet, keeping him whole.
And into the stillness, Dean whispers, so quiet, so low, that Castiel almost might have believed he imagined it, “I love you, too.”
Castiel crooks his finger a third time, and Dean doesn’t have the breath to scream any more, and his body locks up in spasms.
He can feel the heat of every one.  He falls through them, one after another; they become so dense that there is hardly any black between them and every one, every one adds to that heat.
“You’re welcome Sammy.  He’ll come for you soon.  Think about where you want to go on your all access VIP tour of Hell.”
When Castiel finishes his weaving, and places the crown on Dean’s head, he does it slowly and reverently, like he is crowing Dean the King of Heaven, not only his lover in a field of dreams.  He stares at Dean hard, to try to capture this moment in his memory, every detail, so he will never, ever forget.  Roses, on Dean's brow, lighter in shade than his lips, but not softer.  Woven over his ears with peonies, pale pink and opened only shyly.  And the daffodils, orange, a contrast, and now forever reminding Castiel of the sight of one held between Dean's teeth, in his mouth.
Dean groans into Castiel’s neck, and his hips rock reflexively against Castiel’s body.  He reaches behind him, for one of the manacles, and locks it reverently over Castiel’s wrist.
The door swings open on a dark room.  The light from the armory that leaks in glints off rows and rows of vague sharpness inside.  Castiel enters.  Sam follows, stumbling, disoriented as he is, because he knows that if that door closes he is not going to be able to get it open again.  What was that spell, on the door?  What was that blackness, in Castiel's veins?  That wing.  The ‘what the fuck’s are piling up too fast for Sam to keep track of, even if he wasn't having to focus so hard on just breathing.
Gabriel interrupts him, pointing a finger at Castiel’s face and narrowing his eyes.  “Make.  It.  Stop.”
“Can I sing you a song, Dean?”  He asks, his voice soft. Yes. He has been wanting to sing, all day as he watched Dean.  His fingers tapped, and it was hard to remain silent. Wanting to sing songs about the green that appears at the beginning of summer, and how it takes over all the cold, barren, trees.  Those are not usually his favorite songs; usually he prefers to sing to the stars, but today he wanted to sing songs about the spring in time with the breaths he watched form on Dean’s lips.  Today his favorite color is green.
In so many dreams Castiel appeared to Dean; armored and golden, on fire in his true form or rumpled in his suit and trenchcoat, he appeared.  He saved Dean from the Leviathan and from Lucifer, from the Darkness and from Abaddon and the angels; he saved him from Azazel and his drunken father and from Sam’s cries.  He saved Dean from guilt and from fear; he saved him from betrayal and lies and disappointment.  He saved Dean over and over again, without fail, every time Dean thrashed in his sleep.  And Dean never knew, and Castiel never told him, that Castiel was real, in those dreams.  That he did forgive Dean.  That he did save Dean.  That he always would.
“He wanted it.  He wanted every moment of it.  He wanted more, and would have taken it if I’d let him.”  Sam’s cheeks are dark with a hateful blush, and Dean realizes that Sam thinks he’s gloating.
“Nah, not that I can remember,” he whispered back, leaning minutely closer to Cas - any excuse to do so was a good excuse. “Maybe when I was younger. But... it’s a perfect place to raise your kid and not think anything bad when an older man is having a pie-and-hot-chocolate-date with her every day after school.”
Telling her daughter that this was one of his favorite movies? Probably getting her to want to watch it as well? Why would she do that if not to hone the girl’s feelings she had regarding Dean as a fatherly figure? It was one thing to hug the girl now and then and be there for her if she needed help - it was another thing if her mother forced some connection between them. It surely made Dean uncomfortable.
He cleared his throat, leaned forward, and put his mug down. Not looking at the girls, Dean chose to instead keep his gaze on his hands, loosely folded between his legs. “Jo … how … how did it …”
What was happening? Was Cas hurt after all? Not just emotionally but also physically. Had something happened? Before he could ask, Cas was already yelling again.
And just like that, Dean‘s bravado melted away for good. Yeah, he really didn’t want to make Cas even angrier at him. He was here to see if the man was okay, not to hurt him even further. “I … I stopped by to see how you’re doing,” he finally answered, keeping his voice much softer.
He could feel her turn her head to look at something that must have been behind him – but he didn’t care what was going on behind him. Her words made him grit his teeth to contain his irritation at the situation.
Slowing down, Dean turned around in his saddle and looked back the way he’d come. The moon was still round and finally not hidden by clouds, giving him a tad more light than the mornings before.
Yeah, he really wasn’t the best at finding clever answers when his brain was single-mindedly focused on stunning blue eyes.
And since he felt like he would never stop smiling again whenever there was a reminder of the fact that Cas was now actually his boyfriend, Dean once again gave in. “Yeah,” he agreed with a gentle nod. “We’re official.”
In the car, he used the twenty-minute drive to call Bobby and make sure he would be home to take care of Grace – “Dad, I’m twelve, I can stay home alone.” – and to make sure Sam and Eileen would stop by to help with the horses.
I thought you might have forgotten my first name.” He should probably tone down his cockiness a bit. His goal certainly wasn’t to alienate Cas even further. Heck, his goal was to never hurt this man, ever again. He didn’t even know why he suddenly was like this – he just hoped he wasn’t letting what he’d just overheard influence his behavior.
Schooling his face, Dean tried his darndest not to act strange. Maybe Cas hadn’t noticed that Dean had almost kissed him.
It was all that, yes, but it was also so, so much more. It was the fact that Dean could see them interact like this every day. It was the fact that Dean knew, without a doubt, that given the chance, Cas could be a good parent to Gracie. A great one, even. It might take some time getting used to it, but the foundation was already there. Cas loved Gracie and that was the most important thing. And in return, Gracie loved Cas. Unconditionally.
Michael, honest to God, gave him a pitying look. “Dean, please. You should go after him. Talk this out!”
Maybe he was too romantic for his own good but he had always thought that it would feel different once he and C would finally meet and start dating. But this deep, deep feeling… it simply wasn’t there whenever he was with Cassie.
Eating a few bites of his pie, Dean checked that Gracie was momentarily occupied rummaging in her bag for something, before leaning in to Cas again.
Things certainly didn’t look up from there. The dining room was huge, enough space to fit the Shurley clan. An extra table was prepared for the children, the main table already almost bursting with the seven Shurley siblings, three of their significant others, Chuck and his sister, and of course Bobby and the three Winchesters. Somehow, Cas had ended up at the very other end of the table, as far away from Dean as possible. He tried not to think that Cas had done it on purpose, and mostly tried to ignore the squeezing in his chest. Thankfully, sitting next to Michael helped a great deal, the two friends chatting just like always, laughing here and there over old stories and dumb jokes.
He and Bobby had long since stopped swapping Christmas presents, so all he did was give the old man a clap on his shoulder as he passed him, not interrupting his conversation with Chuck. Bobby sent him a nod and Dean was sure he detected a soft smile under the grumpy facade and beard. The two of them would have another quiet evening soon, watching some game or another, with a cold beer and one of Dean’s homemade meals and that would be present enough for them.
In an effort to drown the tiny seed of a guilty feeling but mostly to get them back to their previous good mood and banter, Dean stole another bite from Gracie’s pie. Just then, Luke appeared on his other side and put down a piece of what appeared to be cherry pie in front of him.
Without saying another word, Dean pulled off his scarf and, placing one end on Cas’ right, uninjured arm. He wrapped the scarf around the cradled elbow, allowing Cas to take his hand away. Tucking the scarf around the elbow, Dean brought the end back up and knotted it on Cas’ good shoulder, checking the fit and comfort.
“Yes, Dad, I’m keeping a secret. Cas trusted me with this, therefore it’s not my place to tell you. Please, if you want to know, talk to him?”
If it had been up to him, she could have read for the rest of the day – heck, she often did when they were here. But today was Christmas Eve and there were so many other things to do, company to enjoy, and more gifts to receive instead of focusing on one while immersing into another world.
Being the little shit that he was, Dean got up from his bed as soon as C’s words faded away. He got to his desk and after finding the right pens for it, Dean tried to color the bisexual flag on his arm. But just like C had said, it washed out right away. Dean wasn’t so sure why that was – being bi couldn’t possibly give anything away about his gender. But it was what it was, he had learned long ago not to question the rules of the soulmate bond.
For a long moment - when Cas returned his smile and their gazes locked - Dean was sure there was an understanding between them. Maybe even a secret conversation, held by their gazes alone and only privy to them.
All the while, their hands roamed, mapping each other’s bodies, exploring, stroking, caressing. It felt so incredibly good. Not only to touch, but also to be touched again. Cas’ hands really were unbelievably soft, his fingers brushing along Dean’s skin, leaving goosebumps in their wake.
There was a slight hitch in Dean’s breathing and Cas looked up from where he had rested his head on Dean's shoulder. Dean’s eyes opened slowly, a smile spreading over his lips even before his gaze fully focused on Cas.
“You okay?” he asked, hoping the panic wasn’t too apparent in his voice, even though there was no way to keep his concern out of it. Because fuck, what if he had hurt Cas? “Did you get hurt?”
That had both, father and daughter, perk up and Gracie hastily reached for the piece of paper. She unfolded it and Dean could see how she quickly scanned the words, tears prickling up in her eyes. Dean was about to say something when Gracie flung herself into Luke’s arms and hugged him tightly.
“Na, she’s back at the ranch,” Dean replied, nodding at Lydia in greeting as she came closer. He vehemently kept his focus on Emma after that. “One of our horses got a foal last night and she’s not leaving its side.”
. But that did not mean he wanted to hurt her feelings. She was a kind woman, after all, and despite Gracie not liking her, Lydia had always meant well in regards to his daughter.
So instead of taking a step back, Dean swayed even further into Cas’ space and by the man’s widened eyes, Dean was sure he had noticed the move. All mirth was suddenly gone, the air heavy, hot, and smoldering. As if they were caught in a heatwave and not in the middle of a snowy winter. Dean’s gaze flicked to those plump lips, wanting nothing more than to press his own against them, to see if they were as soft as they looked.
Taking a deep breath, he tried to calm his nerves and not let all that Michael had said get to him too much. It seemed by now everybody but the person himself knew about Dean’s feelings for Cas.
Opening the passenger door for his daughter to climb in, he shortly admired the night blue Chevrolet Camaro right next to his Baby. While nothing would ever beat his classic ‘67 Chevy Impala, the newest model of this brand was certainly something to look at.
But it was what it was and despite not knowing all the details, C knew enough to know it was what Dean wanted to do rather than what his parents wanted for him.
Dean couldn’t help his smile. He certainly remembered that incident. But his daughter wasn’t done yet.
“Hey, Cas,” he said, just loud enough for him to hear. “You think we could talk somewhere privately for a minute?”
Dean looks at the floor in defeat but Sam throws in, “We don’t have a plan, that’s the point. We came here, hoping to find someone who could help us, who might stand a chance against Chuck. And I think you can.”
“We didn’t plan this. It just happened. And I assure you that we waited to act on our feelings for each other until you were in the picture.”
“Dean, what are you doing?” Cas asked, only a towel around his hips, as he walked over the threshold.
“You know, the usual, being an ignorant prick,” her son said finally. “He insulted Cas because he doesn’t get that not everyone wants to be an engineer.”
He’s talking to Linda when he finds him but Cas appears to excuse himself as soon as he spots Dean and Dean tries his best not to actually run as he leaps forward, arms open.
“Eat! Then we’ll talk. You seem like you’re about to fall out of your seat unless you’re boosting your blood sugar any time soon.”
Tomorrow they would leave for North Carolina with Dorothy and Charlie. Their friends had been invited to speak at their alma mater and as it would soon be the ten year anniversary of their graduation, they had decided to make a small college reunion with Benny and Ash who lived on the east coast. Yet, they would have to make it a two-day journey this time as no-one cared to drive for fifteen hours straight. They were too old for this and especially Charlie and Dorothy had come to realize the value of rest and sleep after becoming parents. Flying had not been an option as Dean, who was terrified of flying, had made a fuss and everyone had agreed to drive like in the old days for his sake.
“Have you seen each other naked, partially at least?” Dean further interrogated. Why was he asking these things?
“Hey, Cas,” she greeted him. “We were just talking about how it would be best if we started with the article you mentioned the other day. You know, the one dealing with Molinism.”
“No!” He was a little too keen about his answer. “No,” he repeated, more sedate. “He would never hurt me. But maybe I hurt him… I just—everything’s different now.”
“Well,” Rowena says, “I’m certainly not gonna watch.” She lifts up her chin and casts Dean an expectant look.
“Fine, I’ll go with you,” Dean says, “but only because I’m still feeling really bad about yesterday.” He can’t actually be mad at Jody for dragging him into this. Not after embarrassing her like he did. And who knows, maybe it’ll be fun.
Cas groaned. This was exactly what he didn’t want to hear from anyone. “No, mom, Dean did not make me gay and I didn’t run away because of him. What I wrote in the letter still applies. My relationship with Dean came afterwards. It’s not his fault that I quit my church career.”
Not much later, Emma’s mom picks her up. He dreads Lydia’s certain, upcoming phone call already because he didn’t tell Emma not to say anything about his boyfriend. He only hopes she’ll be as open-minded as their daughter is.
Dean doesn’t bother to put any clothes on except for his underwear and leaves the bedroom. Cas is in the kitchen, pouring Earl Grey from the teapot into his favorite mug (it says “Gone Chopin” and has a colorful picture of the composer on it).
“He came out of nowhere and went back there. No-one even knows who he is. You won’t be able to find him where we’re taking him. And even if you would, you’d be too late. We’d already know what we want. We’d already have learned all his secrets, dissected him, put every single part of him in a jar of formaldehyde.”
“I’ll show you something,” Dean says and takes the path east. He hasn’t gone this way in a while but it’s one of his favorite places out here and somehow he feels Castiel is worth sharing it with.
Athena continues to tell them about how the wine is made and stored inside these tanks until it’s bottled.
“Aye aye, captain,” Dean and Cas replied simultaneously, the latter with more motivation in his voice than his co-oarsman.
Dean thinks it’s time for him to leave the sundeck as well. He takes a shower and tries not to end up flooding his entire cabin as he does so. How is a grown man supposed to fit in here?
Dean wasn’t even a little bit tired and how in the name of God was he supposed to sleep at all in the light of these new developments.
“It’s reasonable to believe she’s still got some of God’s grace in her. As I’ve said earlier today, my power is weakened and I’m not certain I could withstand her as easily as you think.”
“I guess, you can say it was. We met at a bar and we started talking, I bought him a drink and I knew right away that he’s the one—he’s the one I’m going to marry.”
Then he takes a look at the clothes he’s brought and thinks of what to wear for his first dinner on board. It doesn’t exactly require him to wear a suit but a shirt and coat at least and he ends up picking an ensemble in different shades of blue.
It started after a few days—78 hours and forty minutes to be exact. At first he wasn’t quite sure what he was hearing. The voice was faint, like the words weren’t supposed to be received by him. But then the voice got louder and louder and it became clear that it was Dean’s.
“Dean, I want you to be my friend for as long as this lasts. We have to live with each other after all. I know we shouldn’t get too attached but so far this marriage has been going very well.” Then, hopeful, he asks, “So, friends?”
“Dean,” Cas says, his voice so soft the words cut right through his chest. “Why would you think that? I’ve always appreciated your determination, your expertise and your respect for your co-workers.”
For some reason Dean looked upset for a split second, but then he got up and pulled him into a warm embrace. He smelled like the shampoo his mother used to provide for guests. “I love you too, man. We all do.”
It didn’t look like it was going to be a particularly warm day but he had gotten notably damp under his arms and around his neck which was funny because he hardly ever broke out in sweat during his runs unless it was under the heat of the summer sun. Perhaps he had put on a layer too many today. He only ever felt like this when he and Dean…
“I’m aware this took you by surprise but Dean is good for me. He makes me so happy. I love him so much.”
“I guess, without much further ado, we get started,” she says and leads him into a much larger, brighter room that has a few rows of seats and a piano at the end.
“I don’t know, Cas,” he said. “I guess we’d have to ask Mrs. Graham if she bought the panties herself or if someone gave them to her.
“Just wait till you get to know me better. Maybe you’ll discover something you don’t like about me.”
“Nah, it’s okay. I’ll be fine. Now go home and put your son to bed,” he spoke gently and forced a smile onto his face. “Good night.”
He tugs it from Dean’s grip and puts on the rest of his clothes. Meanwhile, Dean finds his charger but it takes a while before the phone powers up.
“Hey,” Dean said when they were leaving, basically jumping off the pathway and towards his silent friend.
“Two weeks, Dean. It only took your cabin fever two weeks to lure me back on the road with what’s very likely not even a real case.”
He started with sucking him off, then, when he was sure Cas was distracted enough, pressed a slick finger against his rim. It felt funny but Cas was excited to go on with this. The finger drew circles around the outside of his hole until Dean used a bit more pressure and the tip went inside him.
“Nah,” she says and shakes her head. “I like the idea. If you and Cas get married and if mom marries her boyfriend, I’ll have one dad and two step-dads. I think that’s a pretty great upgrade from having no dad at all.”
“Soon enough you can go applying for some really good jobs,” she says. “You’ll gain experience and some day you might even open your own business.”
Cas didn’t exactly know what to make of the offer. Tessa was obviously suggesting some kind of romantic partner to accompany him but he wasn’t really sure if it’d be a good idea to mention that he was in a relationship with a man. They were working at an institution with an religious background and they’d never had any form of talk concerning their beliefs or world views and Cas knew too well from his old church how devout people could be. And the thing between him and Dean was fairly new after all.
Cas ended the conversation by bringing his attention back to the TV screen and Dean continued searching the pictures on his computer for helpful evidence.
“I don’t eat,” Cas says and somehow Dean has already suspected that. He did, however, devour the sandwich Dean gave him. So, at least, he
“Pity,” she says. “There’s something about him…he’s giving me the chills.” She’s shivering as she says that.
He hadn’t told Aaron about what happened. He had called his house—Aaron’s mom picked up the phone—and said to tell him their plans were cancelled.
When they were back home one and a half hours later, brushing their teeth next to each other in front of Dean’s bathroom mirror, he was almost as relaxed as he had been before talking to Charlie. Or maybe he was simply exhausted from the tons of photos he’d had to view earlier this evening. They rinsed their mouths and put their toothbrushes back into their respective holders and Cas headed out into the hallway, turning around briefly at the door of Dean’s bedroom, wishing his friend a good night.
A few hard bangs on his door disturb his sleep. Dean feels like he’s been run over by a truck. He’s lying on his stomach, his limbs numb as if he hasn’t moved in hours. He probably hasn’t. Knocked out dead.
Naturally, he neglected his weekly routine and three weeks passed before he got to go to the cemetery again. He had considered asking Lisa if she wanted to come along but came to the conclusion that it was still too early to introduce her to his dead parents.
Whatever. Why did he even care? He barely saw Aaron and he wasn’t particularly keen on increasing the interaction with him. As long as he treated Dean like he deserved, everything was fine. Dean’s well-being was most important here.
Dean gasped several times until he managed a reply. “Uh, yeah, sit,” he said and gestured towards the chair to his left.
Cas woke up at 6:30 a.m. without his alarm making a fuss. He couldn’t remember the last time he had slept this long. Dean’s guest sofa had been comfortable enough and for the first time in weeks he had slept without nightmares disturbing his slumber. It was not like he had to get up for prayer or anything, yet he felt well-rested and got out of bed anyway. Still, he had prayed before going to bed yesterday, thanking God for bringing Dean back into his life.
“He’s a good friend of my uncle Bobby’s,” Dean tells him. “We’ve talked about the house but Rufus thinks he won’t live to see a modernization paying off, so he doesn’t bother with repairing more than what’s strictly necessary.”
Aaron was his best friend when they both were seventeen. Aaron was the new kid. His parents moved around a lot and their son never had much time to make a lot of friends before they pulled up the stakes again. Dean felt a connection with him. The causes were different but they were both unhappy and in Aaron he had finally found someone he could talk to, noticeable by the diary entries becoming sparse.
“No, that was solely my wife’s thing. I’m only supposed to put the images on the website when Linda has picked the ones she wants to use.”
“No,” Dean replied without looking up from where was curled up on her couch, clutching a pillow in front of his chest.
Castiel’s face hardens. “You know what? For a brief moment I thought Charlie might be right about you but obviously she’s not. You actually are a huge fucking dick. Go to hell,” he says and walks off into another direction.
The beach is very close by and Dean tries to look where he’s going instead of staring at Cas’s newly bespectacled face. Their hotel room came along with two parasols and four sun loungers and everyone spreads a beach towel on theirs but Jack, instead of lying down on it, sits down in the sand, weirdly fascinated by its texture as if it’s the first time he’s seeing sand, and starts digging a small hole with his hands. They probably should’ve bought one of those children’s buckets as well but he supposes it’d draw too much attention to them, considering Jack looks much older than he actually is.
They’re sitting a few feet apart and the presence of Dean’s warm body is calling him to come closer like the Ring is calling Frodo to use it.
“Dude, be honest with yourself. She’s seventeen. You’re probably more of a cool uncle to her than her dad.”
“The usual. And then Dean said he’ll get too hot in those where we’re going and then Cas said he never gets too hot and then Dean dragged him away.”
Fuck, this is happening, Dean thinks when Cas moves again. Cas Novak, with his pretty face and surprisingly super-hot body, is gonna blow him. He can no longer take to look at him being this close so Dean squeezes his eyes shut. His entire body is trembling with anticipation and—
Tanya leaves her head hanging as if she’s staring at her lap. She seems to feel like crying and Dean suspects it’s causing her even more pain than she’s already in.
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Me?” he says. “I’m afraid there isn’t much to tell. You’ve seen my house, my art, I already told you I have a brother in town. I’m not that interesting.”
“Fine, you start. But this isn’t over yet,” he says and watches carefully as Castiel thrusts his first disc onto the field. The first ten points are made but that’s not really impressive. This game looks very easy so Dean slides his disc towards the triangle, using way too much force and it comes to a halt in front of cabin attendant Charlie’s feet.
Dean moaned loudly, his whole body being shaken by the sound he produced, as Cas made the first thrust into him. “Come on, Cas, harder! Show me what you’re capable of,” Dean encouraged him and he could feel Cas pouring out all the aggression he’d had to hold back during the day and turning it into energy. Cas loved him but he also wanted him. He wanted Dean to be his, wanted to claim his body and he could gladly have him and take him in any way he’d like.
“Why should we get our hands dirty?” Ketch says. “Give the police any reason there was some kind of crime happening when all is over. We don’t want to hurt you, Dean. We just want the merman.”
“I love nature,” Dean says, “it fills you with gratitude to have something like this around you. The buzz of a city stresses me out, to be honest. This here, it makes you think, reflect on the world we have and haven’t got anymore—you know, I guess I understand now, what you said before. A place like this, we should value it more.”
Why was he still here? What kind of a creep was he even that he listened to his best friend masturbating?
Dean had obviously been startled, but the moment passed quickly and he asked, his voice hoarse from sleep, “Where you watching me sleep?”
Dean laughs but it’s very obviously fake. “Ha, that’s the craziest shit I’ve ever heard. I’m so not into dudes, believe me. How did you even come up with such an idea?”
Mandy pushed him against the door after he had closed it. She pressed her lips on his and Cas pulled her closer with his hands around her back.
“Alright, yeah, sure.” Dean thinks for a moment. “So, okay, this isn’t probably the best time to bring this up, but what you said about you and your ex-wife being allowed to date… I mean, is this something you’d like yet, or is it still too soon for you to even think of going out with someone?”
“Here’s your coffee,” Dean said after Cas had taken a seat at the table and put the paper cup in front of him. “And I’ve got muffins. There’s cherry and blueberry—which one do you want?”
Dean’s reassuring words do nothing to release the tension from his face. Without another word, however, Dean leads the way and they’re back on the path in no time.
Officially, he was still a deacon and he needed to honor what this meant. He owed God to keep up this part of his promise until his status had changed from clergy to laity. This could take a long time, but… Well, on the other hand he had already betrayed Him and acted against his vows, so why still be loyal?
He made sure not to leave out any detail when he narrated the whole story to Cas after he had gotten back to Sioux Falls.
He finds a half-finished table, its freshly glued parts held together by clamps. And there he is, with his back turned to Dean and he was warned not to startle him. He tries to approach him as loudly as possible, almost stomping, coughing a little to announce his arrival. Cas looks over his shoulder. “Dean! What are you doing here?” He carefully puts down the hammer he was holding, dusts off his jeans a little and takes off his work gloves and grabs Dean’s hand to shake.
“Hey, buddy,” he says to Quentin who is sniffing around on Castiel’s porch when Dean gets there and, after knocking, Dean is about to tell him he’s not exactly welcome here but loud stomping from inside that seems to shake the entire house gives the cat a jolt and off he is.
“I’m… I’m feeling a bit self-conscious here,” Dean says, his ears flushing. “Because of what you said about my…you know.”
However, Gunnar or wrestling isn’t mentioned again in the book. It’s strange but maybe life got in the way. His actual, awful life, with his parents’ divorce and struggle with school and—
“I’ll be studying for four to five more years and I can’t say how long it’ll take for me to become ordained. Not that long, hopefully.”
Cas wasn’t even able to answer right away. First he had to shakily release the breath he had been holding, then repeatedly nodded his head, until, finally he managed to say, “Yes.”
“Yes, yes. I thought I’d do that too. But, I was thinking long-term, you know. Maybe live alone, or get a roommate, ‘cause that’s cheaper and probably easier and—”
“Oh no, this can’t be good,” Cas replied and gritted his teeth as he took the letter and teared it open. His face darkened when he had started to read the first few words.
Coming home after a long time was an odd feeling. The feeling was even more odd because the time that had passed seemed much longer than when he’d been away at the seminary.
“You’re the first person outside my family, and besides Father Jim of course, that I’ve told about this. So, what do you say?”
“Also, most angels have kept their vessels since the Fall. It’s very unlikely for one of them to show their true face to humans,” Cas says.
“You do, apparently. I don’t know why you’re obsessing over this guy when it’s your duty as my best man to get me drunk.”
His comeback to Dean’s response has got something to do with “suppressing a part of himself” but it’s not worth listening to anyway. He’s fully aware of who he is and what he likes and Cas just wants to blame him for being tempted, because let’s be honest, Dean is a fucking handsome guy with his own business and everyone could call themselves lucky to have him.
Now that’s something he did not expect. Well, of course he knew his ex wouldn’t stay alone forever but… So soon? Technically, their marriage has been over for almost a year but… It hurts. It shouldn’t hurt. He’s not envious, obviously, he’s—
Dean lets out a surprised “huh”, shudders, but then pulls up both his legs, dragging Cas into him deeper.
“She says someone took them but she wasn’t able to tell who as, you know, the person or…thing was busy ripping her eyes out.”
After a while, Cas notices that Dean is looking right at him. Dean’s hand reaches up to comb through his hair and pulls down his head to kiss him. Dean doesn’t seem to mind where his mouth has been earlier when his tongue slides past Cas’s lips. The kiss is wet and slow and warm and Dean’s body responds in a rhythm with Cas thrusting into him.
He’s really far out by now and Dean feels helpless. If something happens, it’s this guy’s own fault but Dean won’t leave until he’s safely back on the beach again. Just as he’s finished the thought, a high wave hits the rock he’s currently standing on, and when the sea withdraws the man has disappeared.
“Jody, can you even imagine how the last two hours were for me? I had to hold Cas’s hand the whole time and that bastard Balthazar had us basically glued together from the waist upwards.”
He arched his back, knees slightly bent, hands resting on his thighs. He desperately tried to suck in some air but nothing made it through to fill his lungs. It was like something was stuck in his trachea, sealing it.
“I see,” Meg says, noticing the unpacked Ouija board on the floor. “Couldn’t wait till we got back, huh?”
The sofa is a convertible. I’ll help you make it into a bed later. First I’ll get you some bedclothes.”
Cas had been standing in the doorway staring the entire time Dean had been speaking. “Thank you, Dean,” he said eventually. “I will find a way to make this up to you, I promise.”
When he’s steadied himself again, Sam asks, “Are there maybe any girls or boys you’d like to mention?”
Dean thinks about that other night, when Cas lifted him onto the piano. Cas could have fucked him right there—it would have been perfect. Everything Cas does is perfect.
The show does have its lengths, though. At least, there’s a break before the grand finale and then, after everyone’s done applauding, there’s finally some food waiting for him.
He licks and kisses and massages with his finger and eventually, it slips inside. Slowly, very slowly, he pulls it out halfway before thrusting downwards again. And he repeats the motion a couple of times, then he adds another finger and Dean groans.
“This is silly,” Cas says and just as he wants to remove his fingers from the glass it moves an inch to his right.
“You mean she could’ve had a latex allergy? Did she have sex before she died and the guy just took off when he realized the condom didn’t become her?”
He hadn’t thought about Aaron in years. How could he forget him? Sure, they hadn’t been friends for a very long time because the inevitable thing happened and Aaron’s family had to move again. Dean remembers the day Aaron told him. He was devastated. They’d made plans for the summer to go on a road trip. Dad would lend Dean the Impala and they’d listen to Led Zeppelin and AC/DC and sleep in the car so they wouldn’t have to pay for a motel room every night.
“Oh, you know, this rich guy made me an offer. He’s working a lot and he needed someone to help him out.”
Dean was itching to ask Cas what they’d talked about but waited for Cas to tell him at his own pace.
“Of course, dear. I’ll talk to your father and make sure he behaves nicely when you come here with Cas for Sam’s birthday.”
They reach Dean’s Impala first. “I had a really good time, Dean. Thank you,” Cas says, his voice low.
Dean laughed but didn’t say anything. A blush had spread on his face. “I’m hungry. Who’s in for pizza?” Dean then asked. After this, Dorothy came over too, also being informed by everyone how pretty she was, although the only opinion that really counted was Charlie’s, and they shared a family size pizza, each quarter with a different topping.
Dean fell asleep at the pool, had to hurriedly take a shower and is now late for his tango class with Jody. This was not a part of their agreement. She’s going to be mad again and Dean fully deserves every word of her scolding speech he’s about to hear.
Dean exhales sharply his nose. “Well, first you gotta know, I guess, there are different kinds of love. Like, motherly love, brotherly love, the love you feel for a friend. You can love a pet, for what it’s worth, but like, not in a weird way. Anyhow, what I’m talking about is romantic love. People, humans, you know, most of them at least, they tend to fall in love with each other and when you’re in love you want to be with that other person all the time, and you think of them constantly and just the thought of them puts a smile on your face and—”
He doesn't remember who proposed it first when they stumble into Dean's room, coat and jackets discarded in the library. Pants already on the floor, Dean fumbles with the buttons on Cas's shirt.
Cas feels anxious. There’s no way of knowing what’s going on out there. Asmodeus could have gotten ahold of the Winchesters. Or Alternate Michael. Or any random creature luring in the dark with a taste for human hunters.
When summer came, Cas finally had the opportunity to do exactly that. He worked on setting up different counseling events and gave Father Jim a hand with spiritual welfare groups.
“I have to be wary. Of people. People are not very nice when I meet them. I prefer to stay by myself.”
“Don’t worry. I used the extra time to find us a movie.” The movie, however, ends up being background noise to their conversation and eventual making out anyway.
“Well, should I come to the conclusion that being a priest is not what I want after all, then yes, I could quit. But I sincerely hope that won’t happen.”
An awkward silence follows. Dean has no clue how to start this conversation. Cas isn't any help either.
His face is feeling red from the effort of attempting to get onto this horse and from the embarrassment of having Dean to witness the whole scene.
“You’re late,” a voice says out of nowhere and Cas jumps back, almost tripping over the empty can on the ground. The night hasn’t properly started yet but he’s already on the verge of a heart attack.
Cas is waiting for Dean to finish his sentence and he realizes he hasn’t actually answered the initial question. He clears his throat. “They teach the basic stuff in school, you know. How to read and write, how to count and calculate. They teach about history and nature, how it works. It gets more advanced with time and when you’ve done your time, you get a diploma. Afterwards, if you still want to go to a special building where they teach you stuff, you can go to college. Sam went to college. I didn’t.” Cas crinkles his nose. “Enough about that,” Dean says and moves on, past the fountain.
Cas stops to give him a soft smile. “Thank you, Dean,” he says before pulling his phone out of his pocket to call his friends and share the good news.
“Yes, but there are a few more rules. For example, you can’t make points on both triangular fields of the court. You each get a field on which you have to score points. And you have to play opposite each other, trying to move your opponent’s discs off the field if possible.”
Dean spotted Cas right away as he entered the diner. He was sitting in Dean’s favorite booth, toying with the coffee cup on the table in front of him.
“I’ve considered that option, yes. But who knows who I’d end up then. Ishim’s fine…and I also like to go for a run on occasion, so maybe I should just go with him.”
“No, Charlie, there’s no maybe. I can’t get my hopes up and then all of a sudden he has a girlfriend. If I let my feelings take over and he rejects me…” He kicked a small rock with his foot. “Just leave it be. I’ll get over him eventually.”
“Please, continue,” Dean croaked. His throat was so dry which was strange because he was salivating like Pavlov’s dog.
“Okay then,” Charlie says and claps her hands together. “Dean, are you taking a look at the old colonel’s chair with me?”
“You can try, if you want,” he says to Dean, joining him by the table from where he’s been keeping his distance.
A flush of embarrassment blooms on his face, prompted by Cas’s praise. He’s good, yes, but only a once a generation artist might be able to capture the sophisticated wonder of Cas’s entire being. Dean is not worthy.
Benny shakes his head, brows furrowed. “Dean,” he says and drops a big hand on his shoulder, “you’re my best friend and I love you. You’re happy, I’m happy. That’s how friendships work.”
The bar looks really nice. There’s a lot of wood and one wall is full of shelves with empty beer bottles from around the world. The bar counter has a line of colorful beer caps worked into it behind a top layer of glass. It was probably unintentional but Cas is glad that Dean brought him here. He loves to see other creative ideas of fellow carpenters and designers.
Dean hangs his head, taking in the destruction.  It is stark, it strikes him, compared to the clean, swift nature of the cliff.  “Sorry, Cas,” he says sadly.  “Mark got to me.  I shouldn't have… I should have controlled it better.  Sorry.” He sounds ashamed.  He feels ashamed, through the bond, like he is thinking about rocks, sinking into deep, lightless pools.  He stands still with his head bowed, body held ready for punishment, like he is waiting for a blow.
"You did." A pause. "I want to take his eyes." Cas clenches his hands, remembering the heft of his hooked knife, "And then fuck you, loud, so when he tries to imagine you, all he can see is me and my knife, and all he can hear is you crying my name."
Warnings for this chapter:  a pretty intense (entirely consensual) scene with large-scale demon exhibitionism for Dean and Cas towards the start.  Cas receives significant aftercare afterwards.
He imagines them here, on this bed with corners that look like the were made with a ruler and the roughly woven olive drab bedspread.  Two bodies sinuous against each other, seeming to have too many arms, too many legs.  Writhing, like a basket of snakes.  Would their cries fill up the emptiness in this room?  Would they stick to the walls somehow and make them warmer?  It is Castiel’s fault that they are cold now, and bare of anything but weapons.  Castiel knows this in his heart.  Because he was afraid.  Because he was a coward.
So he stands, paralyzed.  Should he sweep up the shards of his armor stand?  Should he mop up the water, now lukewarm and stagnant?  Should he right the tables he flipped over?  Should he re-hang Castiel's knives?
They talked about Sam’s internship at a law firm for a while and that he hoped to get a regular job there afterwards. John dropped occasional hints about possible plans to propose to Jessica but Sam stated he wanted to get settled in his job first before even thinking about getting married.
Cas peppered his back with kisses, his unoccupied hand smoothly moving up and down his side, as he opened him up. When he was done, he pulled down the panties only as far as necessary and Dean could feel the thick head of his erection poke at his entrance. He let out a long exhale as Cas pushed in, draping himself over Dean, his weight pressing him down into the mattress.
“We won’t,” Sam assures him and the way he talks and looks at him is enough to make him spill everything. From the nightly bumping, the flickering lights, the incident with his iPod to what’s happened just now, Cas doesn’t leave out a single part of his strange story.
“Sometimes,” Cas said. “There was this overall homesickness when I first got here and I couldn’t really tell who exactly I was missing the most. But I have my studies to attend to which makes it easier.”
Cas reaches for the on/off button to bring an end to the interruption of the pleasant silence this morning had born up until now.
Cas doesn’t get why he’s defensive all of a sudden. He just offered to pay his tuition and now this.
“Come on, let’s have a nightcap somewhere,” Dean says then, when he’s calmed down, draping an arm around Sam’s shoulders and leading them to a bar not too far from their hotel. A group of old men is sitting out on the sidewalk, smoking cigarillos, drinking red wine out of small glasses, talking with hands battered from years of hard work.
The first beer was followed by another and during the third Dean started to feel a pleasant buzz. Cas was trying to keep up with him and swaying slightly when they squeezed through the sea of people to look who else was there. It was everything but easy to get forward as other party goers were constantly in the way.
A guy who introduces himself as Max Banes rings Dean’s doorbell later that night, informing Cas that they’re ready to start whatever they’re going to do to make Castiel’s house spookless.
Dean decided the time for his speech had come, so he stood up from his chair and knocked his dessertspoon against his flute of champagne a couple of times until the room had sufficiently quietened.
No, the person in this scenario was not the Dean Cas knew so well. Surely, there was no need to worry at all. He probably had just misheard. The idea of his best friend thinking of him while he tried to reach completion was just absurd.
Dean’s neck is stiff when he wakes up. He’s not exactly well-rested despite having slept a few hours. He supposes it must have been hours because it’s pitch-dark outside when he looks out the window.
“I agree,” Cas says. “We can assume she’ll fear all of these, considering there’s no-one to save her any longer. I very much doubt God will come to her rescue once more. Not after we’ve seen that he doesn’t even care when the whole world is in grave danger.”
If Jamie was Dean’s girlfriend now, this would probably happen more often. He’d have to leave his room every other night so his best friend could have sex.
Cas’s hands on him felt so good and warm—they felt like home. Those thoughts were abruptly torn away from him when Cas strongly sucked at his cock while moving upwards until letting go of it with a
There might be a slight chance he remembers it wrong, never even hurt his shin in the first place. But. He’s holding the evidence in his hand right now. There’s no way he ruined his jeans like this while he got away without even as much as a scratch on his skin.
“Charlie says I’m hot.” Dean gave her a weird look. He dropped his stuff in the corner behind the door and signaled Cas to scoot over so he could sit on the couch too.
“That ha—,” Jody stumbles once again. “Okay.” She turns and leaves the bathroom. Dean can hear her steps on the stairs.
The sea is calm today. The man Dean saw two days ago remains a mystery and he has been itching to investigate. Translating this traumatic experience into art helped but only time will tell if he got over it. He didn’t even know the man, never spoke to him. Still, there is a story behind all this and Dean is intent on making one up. He’s been speculating, not gotten over the theory that he must have come from a boat, maybe pirates had held him captive and he managed to escape only to find his demise soon after. Townsfolk think he might have been mentally ill which would explain the nakedness. Perhaps it wasn’t an accident after all. Dean is not a writer, no, though his drawings tell tales as well and this particular one he’s especially interested in, whatever it might be.
“We might have a lead on what we’re dealing with,” Sam says, retrieves a piece of paper from his pocket and slips it across the table.
He has mostly gotten over his first shock upon realizing that he is physically attracted to Dean. But who could blame him? Everyone with functioning eyes must admit the guy looks like straight out of a fashion catalogue; modelling would surely have been an alternative career path for him. Dean’s probably the most attractive man Cas has ever met in his life and of course he’s noticed this before during the years they’ve known each other, yet Cas never put much thought into this fact, considering he values a person’s character much more than their outer appearance. And Dean is a co-worker after all; Cas is professional enough to seek sexual encounters elsewhere.
“Oh, it’s so nice that you even want to see her during the summer!” his mother said. “Is she a nice girl? Tell me, Dean. What’s she like?”
Dean had invited Aaron to come visit him in Lawrence during the summer. He had prepared his father in advance for his son bringing home a boyfriend for the first time. As expected, John Winchester wasn’t particularly happy about that but did his best to pull himself together for Dean’s sake. He didn’t want to repeat what had happened with Castiel the year before.
He heard the water run for some time and then there didn’t come a single sound from upstairs for quite a while.
Dean doesn’t want to take that possibility into consideration. He isn’t ready yet. “Maybe he was on a boat,” he says, “maybe that’s why you couldn’t find his clothes.”
Mandy, though, was a great kisser. She was putting so much passion into the working of her lips and tongue. Her charming little sighs in between made it even better.
Dean is itching to jump over people as they are filing out of the auditorium, achingly slow. He wants to see Cas.
Dean enters the house after his brother and Cas follows suit, staying closely behind him. It’s taking a lot out of him to not just grab Dean’s hand as they carefully move further inside the house.
“If he doesn’t want to be your friend, then he doesn’t deserve you as his boyfriend either. You’ll find someone else,” his father said and patted his shoulder.
“I’m sorry, but I don’t have the energy to deal with anyone other than myself right now. I’m a coward for secretly running off, I know that, but I’m really not in a good place at the moment.”
“Thank you, Cas, for doing this and for being so patient with me.” Dean’s hand is stroking his cheek as he speaks.
“This is María,” she explains, “she and her daughter own the place. She’s an old friend of mine and a wonderful person so be nice to her.”
“I’ll take a nap,” Cas interrupted him. “Wake me when we’re there.” He balled up his jacket and nudged the makeshift pillow between his head and the cold window.
“We?” Sam asks, a little perplexed, but Dean can’t hear him because he’s already further down by the shoreline, filling the small bucket with water.
“That’s not fair. He’s got work stuff tonight, he said so, and he’s just nervous about messing things up with his brother-in-law. He wants you to like him.”
Dorothy was dancing towards her girlfriend until they were impossibly close. Their hands were caressing the other’s cheeks, mouths hanging open slightly, breathing each other in. For the girls it was only them, no-one else around mattered.
After a while, Dean broke the kiss to get out of the panties. They had only been around his thighs at this point anyway and feeling his husband without anything between them was way more comfortable.
He gets onto his feet and closer to Dean so that only he could possibly hear him. “You could marry me, Dean, become my fake husband for a while until things have calmed down. You will find a new job in the meantime and become independent from my money and eventually we will divorce again.”
“I’m glad I got to do this with you. I wouldn’t have wanted to be like this with anyone else,” Cas told him when his breathing had steadied. Dean gave him a quick kiss and helped him pull off the condom without spilling come. Then he rushed into the bathroom and returned with a damp towel and started to clean them up.
Cas swallowed. “I think I did something wrong and…I already confessed my sins, so please don’t assume I’ve been carrying this burden around with me all the time.”
Everything was fine, so why would they need to know? He loved Dean, Dean loved him and they had finally gotten together and this certainly wasn’t anyone else’s business.
“This. I can’t do this…this life. I have to quit or I’ll lose my sanity,” Cas said as he ran his fingers through his hair.
He slides his hands under Cas’s shirt, still kissing Cas’s neck and jaw, and Cas squirms in his arms, throwing back his head against Dean’s shoulder. Cas isn’t tense, not anymore. Dean probably imagined it after all. One hand slides onto the sweatpants, stopping at Cas’s crotch. Cas squirms again and spins around in Dean’s arms. His cheeks are flushed. He seems breathless…and upset.
“If you hurt him again, I’m gonna break your legs,” Sam deadpanned and Cas quickly backed away from him. “Just kidding,” he said, his frown turning into a smile, and shook Cas’s hand. “Glad to meet you again, Cas, really.”
Two days later, on the last school day before summer, Aaron stopped him on the way to the bathroom and gave him a letter. It contained his new address and a phone number. On the bottom of the page it said
Cas moves in between the space of Dean’s legs, still holding onto them and pulling forward so that they’re flush at their crotches and Dean realizes that jerking off to ballerinos and ballerinas might not’ve been enough to not reveal his excitement so soon in a situation like this but here they are now and he’s getting hard, though he’s pleased to notice that he and Cas are in the same boat.
“You know,” he says when they’ve arrived at Claire’s house, “if there’s ever anything you want to talk about, I’m here for you.”
“Charlie’s great, mom. She’s quirky and witty and she can also be really sweet…but don’t tell her I said that. You’ll love her. She’s also really smart—she’s studying Computer Engineering.”
“Does this mean, there is someone who—?” Mom doesn’t finish the question. Her eyes, however, drift over to Cas. Dean isn’t quite sure whether it’s intentional because then she resumes, “I mean, how else could you be sure, right, if you didn’t try it out first.”
“You mean to mom and dad? Did you meet someone? Who is it?” Sam sounded really excited all of a sudden.
“Hey,” Claire replies, as wordy as Emma. At least they have something in common, Cas thinks. Teenagers…
They talk less now because Dean really needs to focus on what he’s doing and when class is officially over, Balthazar and Anna invite everyone to stay a little longer to practice under their supervision. Some couples stay, among them he, Cas and his new friends Cesar and Jesse.
“Oh, Castiel!” Kelly’s shrill voice interrupts their stillness. “We were worried about you. Where were you last night?”
After discarding the towel on the floor, he signals Cas to move so he can pull out the blanket from underneath him and then gets back into bed and hauls the covers over both of them.
The earth trembles and Chuck, to Dean’s surprise, looks confused. He rolls his eyes. “What the fuck did you do this time?”
He usually sat next to Bartholomew during the lesson. He also had another course with him and they talked even outside of the lecture room on occasion.
“Ah yes, the thing with the Superman underwear,” Dean said, like he knew exactly what Cas was talking about.
Sam laughs and shakes his head. “Seriously, though,” he says, “I’m happy for you. Cas seems like a good catch. I mean, a famous pianist, come on—who would’ve thought that?”
“I told you I would wake up first,” Dean said when he noticed Cas stirring next to him. Cas huffed a small laugh. “How are you today?”
“Sure, keep telling yourselves that,” Jody says but when Dean wants to ask what she means by that, she’s raising from her chair.
Dean kinda gets what Cas is talking about. There isn’t really anyone waiting for him back home either. Dad is probably glad he’s gone and Sammy is living his own life in California.
It’s fascinating to watch, though. Sam is really concentrated, licking his lips every few seconds, and Cas shows a patience that Dean didn’t know he was capable of.
“The only steady thing so far is my girl, though,” Charlie said while looking at her with heart-eyes.
Jody turned out to be a really nice person and he doesn’t get how she’s seemingly getting along with someone like Dean. God, he hopes the guy falls off the ship and gets eaten by sharks… Boy, he’s drunk.
Behind a door she presents a set of stairs that leads downwards into what appears to be a multi-purpose room, with some kind of stage area on the far end. Chairs are stacked atop each other along the wall.
“Hey, I’m Jess. You must be Cas,” the blonde girl who had arrived with him said while the brothers hugged.
And Dean really hopes it’s worth the horrendous debt he used to be in for allowing his little brother to fulfill his childhood dream. Their parents weren’t exactly wealthy and dad died before Sam graduated from high school but there was no way in hell Sammy wouldn’t have this, so he convinced their mom to let him contribute to his brother’s tuition. Gladly, Mary Winchester only had one of her sons go to college and together their beloved Sam could go to vet school.
“That’s not really how sexuality works, Nana,” Emma throws in and if this doesn’t make her the most precious little thing in the universe…
Sam laughs briefly. “No, I meant for real, Dean. Not like Emma. I mean having a baby you see grow up and can be an actual father to.”
With the effort of two people, the job of getting his Baby ready to leave is done soon and Dean ambushes Cas with a snowball when he doesn’t watch out. He hits him right in the back of the head.
“And I really did my best to continue as it was during high school. I prayed, Castiel, that we would get through this.”
“I promise. No need to be scared, I’m here,” he says, his voice soft, yet Cas is too tense to appreciate his support.
He quickly towels off with his flannel shirt and gets dressed. Cas’s clothes he hides under a rock for him to find in the morning. He’s shivering now that he’s had to leave the magical warmth of Cas’s arms and his overshirt is too damp to put on. He’s almost back to where his car is parked when someone approaches him in the dark.
He waves as the newly restored Lincoln leaves the grounds of Winchester Vintage Automobiles. Benny is glaring at him while wiping oil off a dipstick with a greasy rag.
“I think you just have to know and be sure that you’ve found the right person to do it with,” Dean concluded. Then they were silent for a moment.
Dean looked over to where Cas and Dorothy were still talking to the boat rental guy. “I’m not sure,” he said eventually. “I mean—uh. There was this moment…just briefly I thought… It probably meant nothing.”
Cas huffed a short laugh. “You know, it took some time, but I’ve gotten used to getting up early. You really can’t afford to sleep in if you choose the same career path as I did.”
Luckily, his encounter with the security guard hadn’t had any aftermath and he never saw the guy again during the day. Even the old ladies weren’t bothered by his presence any longer and now just seemed to ignore him. He had become as much a part of this place as the headstones, the plants and animals, and Castiel.
One lazy afternoon they were naked in Aaron’s bed, Dean on top of him, making out. Both were already hard and slowly rocking their groins together. Aaron’s hands were on Dean’s ass, kneading, which lead Dean to moan loudly into his mouth. Aaron made him withdraw slightly so that he could look him in the eye. One hand was moving up the length of his body, briefly stroking at the back of his neck, then along his cheek until the tip of Aaron’s index finger was touching his lips, circling his mouth like one does with chapstick. Aaron kept looking at him with intent which caused Dean to eventually snap the finger into his mouth and he began to suck at it like he had just done with Aaron’s dick a few minutes earlier. Aaron gaped at the sight and Dean drew at the finger with all of the force his mouth had to offer. Then Aaron pulled out his sufficiently wetted forefinger and began to tease with it at Dean’s rim. “Relax, Dean,” he whispered gently, carding his other hand through Dean’s hair.
He lies back on the bed and pulls Dean with him. They kiss, taking their time. There's no hurry, yet Dean has to remind himself constantly that there isn't. They're free to do whatever they want whenever they want.
And it’s fun. He’s enjoying himself. These are decent, talented people and Cas is getting paid to do what he loves most in the world.
“Please, sit,” Jody says and Dean sits down on the loveseat next to Cas who scoots a little to the side to make room for him.
When Dean was decent he got up from the bed and ran over to where Aaron was standing with Cas. “Hey,” he said a little out of breath.
Over the course of the next weeks, Dean came to the cemetery every weekend. Once he was done giving his parents the latest update on Sam’s wedding planning, he went to pay Castiel a visit as well.
“It’s not finished yet, only the wooden structure. The upholstery is still missing. The seat and backrest are supposed to be covered with leather.”
Cas combs a hand through his hair as he takes a deep breath. “She’s a good kid,” he says then, somewhat distracted. He doesn’t look happy.
“Dean’s a grown man; he can make his own decisions. However, I sincerely hope you’ll eventually accept who he is what he chooses to do.”
“Oh yeah, they asked so many weird questions. Like, they were really invading our privacy,” Cesar says.
“You said you come here often,” Cas says. “Have you ever seen a ghost? Or anywhere else in the hotel?”
“Just leave her,” Charlie says with a calming hand on his forearm and an unexpected spark of jealousy jolts through Cas’s chest.
“Dean, what a nice surprise,” Missouri says, slowly getting up from her chair behind the counter. “Did you bring your statues?” Dean completely forgot about those.
On the way to his room he walks by Dean’s and finds the door ajar. He announces himself with two knocks on the door frame and strides in.
“I won’t be allowed to date if that’s what you’re asking. The whole point of this is learning to stay abstinent and focus on my tasks.”
“I should probably bring the house into this century, though, and I might need help with a few things,” Dean says and lets out a small laugh.
The expression in Cas’s face, almost shocked, startles him and Dean feels like he might have given away too much about himself, been caught.
Dean wants to argue further but three pairs of eyes are glued to him, begging, and he can’t but give into the joint wish of his family to spend their vacation here instead of Hawaii.
Cas parts his lips slightly. He wants to say something but doesn’t know what. The planchette refuses to move.
“Technically,” he says, “the woods start right here at the end of my backyard. Come on.” When it’s warmer, he likes to sit outside in the sun and draw fairy tales or sinister creatures, lurking in the depths of the forest. Sometimes he and Sam will make a campfire, drink a couple of beers and have a nice talk. From time to time, there are fireflies. When it’s night and all kinds of critters become active, Dean’s imagination peaks. In the distance there’s the gentle murmur of the river, a soft whir moving through tree branches, leaves rustling, maybe the steady call of an owl on lookout for prey.
“What else would I be talking about? Not that there’s still a chance to get the other thing but I’d really like to have bacon for breakfast.”
The conversation with his mother went well. She said she’d love to have him back home and to meet Dean again as well. She also told him to make sure Michael and Meg would join them for a family meal when they came. Cas had informed her that they would book a hotel but his mother insisted they stay at the house and as he couldn’t come up with a good excuse for why not to accept this, he had to give in and agree to sleep in his old room as long as he was in Indianapolis.
They walk back towards the library, past the car. Cas stops every now and then, inspecting different shop windows. It takes them a while to reach the diner but Dean is in no hurry. He lets Cas set their pace. Everything is new to him and he should take his time and let it all sink in. They earn curious looks from the few people they meet. Dean doesn’t bother introducing them to Cas. He certainly isn’t going to broadcast that this is the naked man who caused a fuss at the beach a few days earlier. They’ll ask questions and Dean has yet to find a good answer to those.
He had changed. God, had he changed. And yet, somehow, not at all. He still had his messy dark hair, only now he seemed to wear it that way on purpose. His face, obviously, had lost the boyish features, all sharp angles and rough edges now – and still, it was the same face Dean remembered. But most of all, he remembered those eyes. Those deep blue, soul-searching eyes that he had never really forgotten.
Reluctantly, Gracie waved goodbye to the Shurleys further down the row before hugging those she could easily reach. Dean patiently waited as she hugged Cas extra-long before finally letting go and following her father.
“Dean, please,” she interrupted, raising one hand in an appeasing gesture. “There really is no need for that. Misunderstandings happen, that’s life and a part of human nature. I, for one, don’t think you did anything wrong.”
Dean had to tread carefully. Because really, the last thing he needed now was to take a wrong step. One wrong step and this budding friendship could crumble right away.
Soon after, Taylor paid them a visit, collecting a grateful thanks from Dean for letting them do this - not that Dean
Leaning towards him, slowly, not pushing, only inviting, Dean was so relieved when Cas closed the gap between them. The kiss was nothing like the heated, eager make out from before. This one was tender and sweet, soft brushes of lips against lips.
Before he could change his mind or lose his nerves, he folded the letter of recommendation to the correct size and together with the card, put it into the envelope, sealing it shut and after adding Cas’ name, he set it aside. Picking up some of the Christmas wrapping paper, he also wrapped up the DVD, still adamant on handing it to Cas, even if it might just be to make him smile.
They were mingling for a little bit afterwards, Dean just happy to see Gracie beam under all the attention and praise she got. They stuck around long enough for Bobby to leave them behind, already returning to the ranch. The old man always got antsy with so many people around. It wasn’t until Dean had already told his daughter that they would leave soon as well, that Gracie spotted the Shurley clan. She let out an excited squeal and took off towards them, already yelling, “Uncle Chuck!”
It was their third encounter and one would think he’d gotten used to Cas’ dismissive behavior by now.
A while later, Dean joined Anna, Rebecca, and Eileen, who were animatedly talking about… baby names. Okay, yeah, definitely to be expected, seeing how Rebecca and Bart still hadn’t agreed on one. But also not a topic Dean was up to discuss. Somehow, he and Lisa never had that problem. Not with Grace; not with the son that should have been theirs; and not with the second girl Lisa had carried when she had been taken from them. Somehow, they had always known what to name them.
Only when Cas bends down to him and Dean gets a better view of him, he realizes there’s something wrong with his eyes. They aren’t there.
“How can you say that, Dean?” It’s almost a whisper. Apparently, Dean’s words have hurt him so much that he can hardly even speak.
“So, how’s it going out in California? Are you busy studying or did you get the day off?” He laughs.
He opens the trunk, puts his bag inside and sits down on the edge. “I’m going to miss you so much, Cas,” he says and he hates how whiny his voice sounds.
He thinks.  He scrambles for the phone.  It’s not ringing with Cherry Pie or Lemon or Brown Sugar, or any of Gabriel’s other sleazy favorites.  It’s just ringing.  He almost drops it when he sees the area code.  Kansas.  Lebanon.
He shrieks.  “Yes, Lord, yes.  You are the… you are the… companion of the Master.  You are the fallen angel, Castiel.”
“Ok, little guy, sshhh, it’s ok,” Dean says.  “Calm down, buddy.”  He tries to make his voice soothing, and he rubs his thumb over the tentacles on his wrist some more, extra slow, extra gentle, to try to calm the little guy down.
Castiel fingers the collar that has appeared around his neck.  The spikes are sharp like needles, but he does not press them hard enough to prick.  He likes it, that they are dangerous-- golden and sharp. Like Dean. Like his Master.
Dean wonders who used to do this, for Cain.  Some enslaved demon?  Lucifer?  Crowley hasn't been around long enough for that, right?  Alastair, maybe, sallow fingers lingering and sycophantic?  Or maybe the magic in the fit is enough that the coat can suit itself.  Dean shrugs.  It's too late to ask Cain, now.  His secrets are all bled out on the floor of a barn in Nebraska.
He ignored it, at first.  He thought:  maybe Dean’s longing for him was all caught up in, undifferentiable from, his longing for his brother, who had saved the world and been swallowed up by the earth.  It was only longing for Sam to be able to see him, see that he finally had the life they had said that they wanted.  Castiel was sure. Dean had a home, now, a family.  A child to take care of and take care of
Dean shies away from the violence in Castiel’s voice, and Castiel tries to calm himself, so that he will not make Dean afraid again.  There is silence in the room as Castiel breathes until his vessel’s heart has stopped pounding angrily against his temples. Until he is calm and made of ice and stone again.  His voice is gentle when he finally speaks. “Maybe there is some way you could be convinced that the food I bring you is not drugged?”
Castiel wakes from a perfect dream, of stars, and warmth, and peace, and Dean, with his head still rested on Dean’s chest.  He can hear Dean’s heartbeat.  There is enough left of human in the demon that the heart still beats, and Castiel is thankful for that.  He listens to its steady thump and it soothes him, like the tide coming in.
And Dean holds their joined hands up to his mouth and kisses Castiel's fingers.  “Yeah, baby, I understand.” He does.  He hates it, wishes he didn't know what it feels like, that desperation, that willingness to do anything, anything at all, but he does.  For Castiel, he does.
Eyes narrowed again, Crowley replies.  “I don’t think you want to be the King of Hell, dearie, even if you have gotten a taste for the old ultra-violence.”
He passed the slope, happy to know Cas wouldn’t have to detour on this dangerous path. Apparently, Dean had started a bit earlier than him today. The minutes ticked by, the yards flying away under Cherry’s hooves, but no red light appeared.
This pulled a sad little smile from Dean. They had never even met and still, Dean knew exactly how C was feeling.
Yeah, many people had reacted like that when it first happened with Jo. Heck, many people would react like that when
The last thing he wanted was for his daughter to wake up from a nightmare or a scary noise and then run out into the storm alone to get back to the house. Sure, it was only a few yards – but the storm was still raging outside.
She was already at the door, Dean’s hand about to land on her shoulder to guide his daughter inside, when she twirled back around to Cas. “Ohhh, do you think …” She held up her book, something she usually did when trying really hard to keep herself from continuing.
Before Dean could react, before he could go on and say anything else, there were lips on his, shutting him up in the sweetest, most delicious way. Not able to fully comprehend the moment, not able to make any sense of it, Dean needed a second for reality to hit him. But when it did, he seized the moment, no thoughts left for any more words or for other people.
Packing everything up, Dean felt the vibration of his phone and pulled it out quickly. When he read the name on the screen, he smiled and hit the instant dial button.
Cas seemed to be in this weird mix of equally not wanting to go back to reality and giddy excitement of heading back home to his family as well as Gracie.
He knew they had, he had seen some of them. Still, in fact, remembering his run-in with Krissy and Ava in particular. Had they been drinking after all?
The third pancake just came out of the pan when he heard the chair being moved and Gracie sitting down. She’d obviously already showered, her long hair in a fancy towel turban to dry more quickly. Since there was no, “Good morning, Daddy,” and her nose didn’t disappear in her book right away, Dean sighed as he put the full plate down in front of her.
He had confessed that he used to love him, yes, and Dean surely hadn’t missed the past tense there and it had hurt so fucking much and he knew it had been a fucking stupid mistake to try and kiss him and his only very stupid excuse was, “It was mistletoe–”
It all had changed after her terrible accident, and while Dean hoped it would just take time, he also couldn't deny that maybe having her own foal would help her find her love for all this again.
As they stepped out of the car and made their way to the house, Gracie picked up the conversation at a different place.
He was about to reply when Taylor Doose called out for him, rushing across the parking lot. Dean waited for him to be closer before he greeted the man. “Taylor, what’s up?”
He came before the porn was even finished, trying to ignore how he didn’t feel satisfied in the slightest.
Punch after punch hit the mark and Dean didn’t care for anything else except the next punch. Not for the tears that streamed down his face, not for the aching that slowly began in his muscles, not for the tiredness that began to settle. Every time he even thought about maybe stopping, maybe deciding it was enough, a flash of Cas’ face would creep back in and Dean knew he had to go on. He needed his blood rushing in his ears, needed the pain in his aching muscles to push everything aside.
He’d always thought that to be just a figure of speech. Just some weird romcom shit authors used to let the readers believe one person was under the spell of the other.
He could see the lines on Cas’ face contorting from pleasure further and further into dissatisfaction and – he simply couldn’t have that. Surging up, clearly taking Cas by surprise, he wound his arms around his torso, effectively slowing the erratic movement. Nipping at his chin, he gave him a reassuring and hopefully soothing smile before carefully turning them around; mindful all the time to not slip out of Cas.
Given all that, Dean knew C was telling the truth when they said they didn’t give a damn about a college degree – but the fact still stood that Dean’s soulmate was a smart cookie and sometimes he wondered if he could keep up with that.
Still, Dean took a risk and did not lean back into his own space, enjoying the moment to be this close to Cas. The soft warmth radiating off of him, the enticing smell that always reminded him of cozy afternoons and happiness. It took every ounce of Dean’s self-control to not reach for the man’s hand and just hold it. Or better yet, put his arm around his shoulders and pull him into his embrace, enjoying this wonderful movie while cuddling him close. The thought alone had Dean’s heart racing faster. Every cell in his body urged him to do so. Just reach out, it would be simple to fit Cas to him, like the last puzzle piece.
“Absolutely,” Dean was quick to agree, hoping no-one would hear his accelerated heartbeat. The prospect of Cas stopping by was certainly something to look forward to. Not that he would admit that, of course. “Kids really need the money. They want a trip to New York and there’s a lot on their list they wanna see.”
Slowly, Cas let go of his left hand and held it so Dean could see. He tried to be as gentle as possible but Cas’ wince told him that he wasn’t doing so good. At least Cas kept his hand in place.
Right now, he needed to focus again. He had a chance now, to explain himself. To help Cas understand his side. He would certainly take that chance.
He needed him to shut up. He needed him to stop these accusations and wrong interpretations. He needed him to listen to him but Cas was on a roll and all that kept repeating in Dean’s head was that Cas’ crush on him, his feelings for Dean, had never gone away and
As he worked on his own breathing to calm her further, he thanked God he had her - without her, he would have jumped down that slope without thinking. Now, though, by forcing himself to slow down so he could soothe her, it meant he could keep a level head.
Clearly, Dean had done something wrong, for the man to not only run away but to run back to New York as well.
Opening his arms, he let Emma step in to hug him. He was well aware that Gracie had mixed feelings about these two - well, honestly, not so much mixed feelings as downright not liking them - but Emma was a sweet girl who had lost her father too early. So really, when it cost nothing to give her a fatherly hug now and then, his daughter would simply have to grow up. It wasn’t as if she had to share him with Emma.
He was just taking out his flashlight, hoping it would be easier for Cas to mount Cherry with some light, when he heard Cas speak up.
“I didn’t get a chance last night to say goodbye,” he began, keeping his voice low. This was hardly the place to discuss this, but he needed to make sure Cas was alright. He wanted to know if he had made Cas uncomfortable, if that was why he had left so abruptly. “You were gone all of a sudden. Everything okay?”
After his morning ride, Dean took some extra time to check on Ruby. She was doing beautifully with this pregnancy, no issues at all so far and Dean hoped it would stay this way. The last thing he needed was to worry for one of his horses on top of everything else.
Cracking one eye open, Dean’s blurry vision confirmed what his hand already told him but still, his brain refused to catch up.
While he knew that C meant well, the words hurt more than any anger or yelling or even more ghosting could have ever hurt, he was sure of that.
Getting ready for school was routine, the two of them not thinking about the day ahead, instead enjoying their thoughts about the holidays that would begin once the school bell rang for the final time that day.
certainly do,” Gracie spoke up for the first time, sarcasm heavy in her voice. “I fell asleep when I tried to read
This fic would’ve been finished sooner or later but thanks to all of you, I knew that it wouldn’t be in vain and that you were still waiting, even after all this time.
him,” Gracie exclaimed and Dean felt her hand slip out of his as her call for Cas rang out over the entire town square. “Caaas!”
“Exactly. Always remember: I’ve been through whatever you’re going through right now. Even if in the end you’ll find out it’s nothing. Just a passing confusion. Just an itch, whatever. We’re still here to help you through it.”
to him? “That’s not what I meant. You were a kid and you were still brave enough to actually take a chance and confess your feelings.” Couldn’t he see it? Was Cas really unable to see how amazed Dean was by that? Did he really have to spell it out for him? “Do you have any idea how much respect I had for you in that moment? That I still have?”
Which reminded him… “Jacuzzi?” he breathed out, already turning them around and away from the entrance door. Cas was still freezing and while Dean was confident that he would be able to warm him up even without the help of hot water, he also wouldn’t say no to some time together in a hot tub.
In some ways, that was a relief, at least for him. He was almost forty now, it was a bit late to redefine his entire sexuality.
As was to be expected, some murmur started up all around, and even Dean only just stopped himself from groaning and rolling his eyes. He couldn’t even remember how many times they’d discussed the length of the Winter Fair during the town meetings. Personally, he had no issue with it – but that didn’t mean he had to support Taylor in all his decisions. So he’d mostly kept out of it, suffering through all the pro and con charts people had felt the need to draw up every other week, with the result being exactly what Taylor wanted. Just like always.
Which was maybe why the atmosphere in his classroom did not bother him as much as it probably should. Something was up -
Dean didn’t have to think about it at all. It was a promise he guessed most friends gave each other at one point or another.
“So,” Dean spoke up later on when they were in the car, well on their way back to the ranch. “Heard you’ve been keeping secrets from me.”
At least Sam and Eileen had waited until Bobby and Gracie had taken off to check on Ruby - if they were lucky, the mare really would have her foal around Christmas Day, giving Gracie the present she so desired.
This is actually one of my favorite chapters 😊 and I cannot wait for you to read it and tell me what you think - I really hope you will like it as well!!
Dean knew he was walking a thin line here - a line he wasn’t sure Cas would like being crossed. If people realized it was them - here, together, whispering and chuckling in a dark movie theater - the gossiping harpies would be all over it, all over
What was she expecting? That he would leave his family just to talk to her in private? To hear a question he hoped she would never ask?
In the end, he had to break off, the fight lost as more tears streamed down his face. Cas sat up and cradled Dean’s face against his shoulder, soothingly rubbing up and down his back. Dean let him. He also let himself find comfort in the smooth movement. And that last bit of strength to finish his tale.
Dean was ripped from their bubble as a loud voice interrupted their peace, diffusing the warmth in the air like a cold bucket of water.
The shiny numbers on his alarm ticked to 3:30 am and Dean sighed. He’d been awake for twenty-seven minutes, and had only slept about three hours before that. Not enough to get him through the day. Because this week had been pure hell.
when Gracie put down her empty mug of hot chocolate and turned towards Dean. For a second, he tried to ignore it, knowing exactly that his time was up – that Gracie would want to have that talk now – but he could never ignore his daughter for real, and therefore, his eyes wandered towards her.
Seeing how Eileen’s deadline was already up and Sam’s text had been shortly after its end, Dean forwent texting back and hit the speed dial for Sam. His brother picked up on the second ring.
“Nothing,” they chorused and quickly, all of them busied themselves with work, unsuccessfully trying to hide their smiles.
Dean was sure he could feel his heart breaking in this moment. He had no control over his emotions anymore, no control over his features. He didn’t know what Cas would see in his eyes but he was sure it wasn’t pretty.
When there was no answer, Dean reluctantly untangled himself enough to turn around. He could tell that Cas was hesitant to talk about this, but if they wanted to get anywhere, it needed to happen. So he hovered over him, encasing him with his body to be able to look at him directly. “Cas, you were happy and content when we went to bed.” Of that Dean was absolutely sure. Still, he asked, “Or did I read that wrong?”
Trying to stay calm at that admission, Dean nodded, searching for the right words. “Please? He left without a word and I– I just wanna make sure he’s alright. I have no idea what’s even going on. Please, just… five minutes?”
Dean was unable to suppress his smile at the memory. At how happy Gracie had been, and how warm Cas’ hand had been in his own when Dean congratulated him on their win.
Opening his eyes but not really seeing anything, Dean nodded. He knew Cas was right but there were some things ingrained in him that he wouldn’t be able to shake immediately. But he would try. For Cas.
All his breath left his body in one big huff of air and laughter, a smile spreading all over his face. C was feeling the same way! He wasn’t alone in this, his soulmate was right there with him. Dean took a moment to let that feeling sink in before he went back to his arm.
Dean frowned a little, looking down at Cas as best as he could. “Consent? What, didn’t my actions last night show you just how much ‘consent’ I give?”
With all the ruckus going on around him he still registered movement up the stairs, on the open landing. Looking up, he just couldn’t take his eyes away, and the voices around him turned into nothing but white noise as for the first time, he had the opportunity to really take a look at Castiel.
Something prickled in his own eyes but Dean refused to let a tear drop. Instead, he took a deep breath.
Not when Cas smiled at him and easily joked around and laughed about something funny Dean said. Not when Dean found Cas staring at Gracie with so much adoration and love in his eyes that Dean was sure that Cas would do just about anything for his daughter.
been a sex dream. He would know, he certainly had had enough of those in his life. And what had just happened did not qualify as one.
Groaning, Dean swung his legs over the side of the bed and sat there for a moment. He hadn’t thought about Cas that much in ages.
A warm hand landed on his shoulder, pulling him away from his moment of misery. “Dean,” Eileen spoke out for the first time, keeping the comforting contact on his shoulder. “That was not your fault. Not all the wrong in the world is yours to right. You can’t control gossips.”
Dean still kept a tight grip on Cas’ hand, pulling him along until they stepped through the front door at last, letting warmth engulf them. Quickly closing the door, Dean shook himself to get rid of the clinging cold, then moved to switch on the light.
This thought really shouldn’t sadden him as much as it did. It shouldn’t make him want to order his daughter another hot chocolate, just so he would get a few more minutes with Cas. They hadn’t even talked, Dean too distracted by the feeling of Cas against his knee to think about anything to say to the man.
Not bothering with waking Gracie this time, Dean just left a note in her bathroom in case she actually got up early. Not that he could think of any miracle that would get his daughter out of bed before 10 am on a Saturday, but better to be safe than sorry.
Opening his mouth, he said the first thing that came to mind. “Pie and hot chocolate? Do you … what do I owe you?”
The Shurley home was a huge Victorian mansion and whenever Anna and Michael’s kids were there, it was generally a loud place.
Cas seemed to kick back into action after that, clumsily tugging on Dean’s shirt in a rush to get it off. Dean happily helped and once the offending material was tossed aside, he pushed Cas’ dress shirt down his shoulders. While he could easily free his right hand himself, Dean helped carefully disentangle the left one where the shirt got stuck on the cast.
It was getting late by the time C asked him a question that let Dean know there was some serious talk ahead of them again.
Before Jo could say anything, Dean jumped in: “She’s talking about Michael’s youngest brother, Castiel. The one that hasn’t been home in thirteen years.”
Dean tried to come up with a witty reply, he really did. But instead, he let his eyes roam over Cas’ face, taking in every inch of it, getting caught on those beautiful lips.
wanted to continue this somewhere where the public was not privy to one of the most important conversations in Dean’s life.
At that admission, Michael’s eyes grew soft and Dean could see the pain inside of them. No one ever wanted Gracie to get hurt and Dean hated that it had happened. But he also knew that Michael hated it as well.
“That’s an Angel Cookie,” Gabe said, voice dripping with accusation. “That’s a family secret, where did you get this?”
“Alright,” Dean said, suppressing a chuckle at how similar Cas’ eagerness was to Gracie’s when it came to gifting Dean something. Instead, he focused on the present he was currently unwrapping. “I bet this is a book.”
The fact that Cas instantly grabbed for his shoulders while wrapping his legs wound around Dean’s waist sent a surge of possessiveness through him. This was his man and he would never be so stupid to let him go again. Never.
“Yes, he is,” Grace piped up, turning towards him with a wide beam herself. “Cas and dad made up and now they’re happy and in love.”
Of course, not being men of many words, neither Bobby nor Dean would ever truly speak of it… but Dean
Dean was chuckling to himself by now. Still sitting cross-legged on his bed, he thought about what to write next. This was so exciting and just like every other person on this planet, he had dreamed of this moment ever since he had learned about soulmates. Ever since stories about Fate and soulmate bonds were exchanged in kindergarten, ever since he had seen the writings on other people’s skin, ever since his parents sat him down and explained it all to him in full.
Until then, he wouldn’t even know how to picture the person that had become the most important being in his life within a few short months. His confidant, his best friend, even his voice of reason sometimes.
Dean raised an eyebrow in amusement. “As if you don’t already know.” And with a fond look at his daughter, he added, “I’m sure your little spy kept you updated.”
As soon as the credits rolled, Cas and Gracie got up, promising to get all of them more drinks. The people on Dean’s other side also left, bidding them goodnight.
Cas treated her like his friend, and it was that difference which made Dean sure Gracie had confided things in Cas she hadn’t with any of them. After all his girl had been through, he was glad she had him. Seeing her now, he could tell she had gotten the light back inside her that had been missing for a long time.
