"Nooooooooooo!"
Sherlock made a face and tore the paper to shreds, revealing the box for a thermal imaging camera that could attach to his cellphone.
"Oh, my God."
It was Sherlock's turn to look at Greg. "Why?"
Mycroft stood frozen for a moment, repulsed. “I am not picking that up," he told himself; "...though it will be me who steps in it later," he grumbled with an eye roll. Using the broom beside the fridge, he swept the bits away from the main walkway, following the trail to the bathroom.
Mycroft smiled warmly as he lifted a small, neatly wrapped box off the ground and sat it in Sherlock’s lap. The little detective traced the ribbon with his finger tip, still shy, until the box moved. Dark curls whipped in Mycroft’s direction. “My?”
"Owww'shh," Sherlock touched his ribs and gave Mycroft a sad look.
Sherlock tips his head sideways to look at John. "It's not?"
"That's okay, baby," John promised, sneaking his hand underneath Sherlock to pinch his bum. "I have everything I need right here."
"Bee say bzzzz-bzzz-bzzz-bzz."
"I thought elephants walked on their hands?"
"We'll use a small bowl to pick out the shells."
"An art gallery. I just said."
"Yea'. Ca'ge nee' fros'ing." Sherlock carefully set down his 'finished' cupcake and picked up another. "Do our cu'bca'ges nee' anyf'ing a'sides fros'ing?"
Jawn covered his mouth, eyes wide. “Sh’eeseca’ge is a’licious.”
Sherlock had
“Aw,” Sherlock said, face falling as he watched it sadly bobbing at the bottom of the tub, too heavy and full of water to do much else.
"After. Don't worry."
"Finish your walk, Gregory."
“Thank goodness we have such a brave and smart Captain to lead the way.”
"Things for bedtime," John replied, using his thumb to clean off some of the icing from Sherlock's chin. "For big boy time."
Greg looked closer at Sherlock; despite how he had said it, that had been the most 'Big' Sherlock had been all weekend. “Sherlock...Course you can come in the green house," he said, then opened the door and immediately began to sweat.
"No. Pu'd some on af'er y'ibbons and th'eath'ells?" Sherlock shook the tube for all he was worth and grunted when Greg took it from him, closing the cap.
“Brilliant job. Can you fetch me a plate for your cake?”
Both men stared at Greg.
Once in the bedroom John directs him to the bed, "Up you get." Sherlock crawls onto the mattress on his hands and knees, glancing back over his shoulder at John through his curls.
there is going to stick and be very uncomfortable."Mycroft turned to look over his shoulder. "That's disgusting, Gregory," he said, and Greg rolled his eyes.
"Y'ibbons?"
"...Did you forget that he can still spell?" Mycroft asked, amused.
"F-fun'nee," Sherlock choked and coughed, his face gone red and eyes watering.
“Don’t be scared." Jawn scooted his bum off the bed and stood awkwardly shuffling his feet. It was clear he wanted to hold the little detective, but didn’t want to force it. “My'coff was being mean. I didn’t mean to be scary. I just wanted him to be gentler with you.”
He started to ease himself up, ready to slither out from under Gavin's arm, and groaned again and the soul-withering twinge in his ribs, making his arm buckle.
"You will still get plenty of cupcakes before bed, I promise." No sooner than Mycroft had spoken, the timer on the oven beeped. "Speaking of," he said, getting up. "I'm going to go set those out to cool."
"Oh, hush," Mycroft carefully lifted Sherlock so Greg could extract himself. "I've never left you to sleep alone on purpose." The baby grizzled but settled quickly once he was cuddled across Mycroft's lap.
"That perception is ALL on you!"
"So--"
"He's a very tricky bunny," Greg tossed the stuffed rabbit onto the baby's lap.
The fingers that had been stroking Greg's neck gave his ear a tug; "There is nothing wrong with needing to be cared for."
"That sounds terrific."
"Se'ben?" Sherlock yawned.
“I thought you said it was Sherlock who would eat three orders,” Mycroft smirked, holding out the last bite of fish for Jawn.
“You’re going to be insufferable now. More than usual I mean.”
“Because now you’ll have something to look forward to.”
This time both Sherlock and Mycroft looked at him, wearing eerily similar expressions.
"My turn," John announced, resting his chin on Sherlock's head. "May I expand on the previous rule? I think we need to be very specific on jeopardizing your health, yeah?"
Sherlock pouted and shook he head. “Nnnnnn!” he whinged, patting his own nose, demanding his bunny kisses.
Sherlock huffed and turned on his heel and stomped through the kitchen and down the hall.
"Everywhere." Greg scrubbed at Sherlock's mouth, making him fuss and push Greg's hand away.
"Y'ah, no'd b'ery nice," Sherlock agreed, rubbing at his eyes with the back of his hand.
The plaster covering his stitches.
"Uh-huh!"
“Not s'eeping, Jawn! Listening!” Sherlock tried to scowl around a yawn, but failed.
"...Seventy-five of them."
"Ba'ff."
"Sherlock," he called out, after sitting Jawn on the end of the bed. "Are you finding your shoes like a good boy?" Sherlock bumbled down the steps, nearly tripping off the last one, and held out two pairs of shoes. "Hey, hey, hey..." Greg spoke calmly. He didn't need the other baby hurting himself. "Look, look at me, Sherlock...it's okay, love. Take a deep breath, alright? Jawn's gonna be okay."
Greg put a thinner slice on his plate...the entire area of the dinner table around Jawn was dirty and smeared, as was the child himself. Greg (or Mycroft, if he could happen to sweet talk his lover into it) was going to have to take a rag and soapy water and scrub him down in a whores' bath at the sink.
"Different blue."
Two minutes, and one mild shoulder cramp later, Jawn was sound asleep.
“Sharks are not b'egatarians, My'coff," Jawn sniffed.
Sherlock was gone.
Mycroft kept his back to them as he placed the cupcakes on to a tray, and began to light the candles. "I'm sorry, pet...I don't sing."
"Wait for us, muffin!" Greg picked up two of the pots and Mycroft carried the third, and followed him
“Sowwie!” Sherlock cackled, rolling on the bed.
Jawn scrunched his face in concentration, his thumb firmly wedged between teeth.
Greg chuckled and looped his arm through Mycroft's. "Good call inviting her to stay. The company'll do wonders for him."
“Mmmhmmm. You said so.”
Sherlock sniffled around his thumb, and released his grip on his brother’s sleeve.
“Yea, bu’d I won’d. I’m b’ery goo’ a’d i’d,” Jawn said, starting to cough.
Sherlock pulled his onesie up to cover his nose. "I do y'ub 'im. Bu'd he shou' say so'wwy. He try to tri'g me!"
"What else did you get at the market?" Sherlock shoved the last bite of the cupcake in his mouth and was licking his fingers.
"No, but he's not spending another full day in just pajamas. Bring me something soft and stretchy." Mycroft unzipped Sherlock's sleeper, much to the baby's displeasure.
Sherlock frowned as he shielded his eyes from the glare. "Star'bing?"
John pulls the collar of his shirt and jacket even tighter as he comes, leaving Sherlock stuttering for air. The seconds tick by like hours before John releases him. He gasps as he leans his head heavily against the back of the sofa. Now. Now there would be affection.
Mycroft's face started to go red. "Do NOT snap at me--!"
"You don't want blue water?" Greg asked, tying the tiniest bit of pink ribbon around his flower.
Sherlock looked up at him as if he were weighing his options...then wrinkled his nose and shook his head up at his uncle while chewing on his popsicle stick and giggling.
Mycroft sighed, wrapping long arms around him.
"Well, where did you put them when you put the shopping away?"
"I jus' don' y'ike it." Sherlock tried to scrub his cheek against his shoulder, and winced as it rubbed over his sunburn. "I jus' don'," he sniffled.
Mycroft, who had started to scold Jawn about using his inside voice again, stopped mid-sentence. “Try again, lad…press harder this time.”
“Wel’gum.”
Greg turned to the dresser to look for the pajamas Sherlock had spoken of.
"I couldn't have done it without you." Mycroft gave him a smooch on the cheek. "Hand us your jams."
"My'cobb rea' s'dory to G'eg ins'ead."
"Rea'yee?" Sherlock asked, looking up at his brother and grinning cheekily.
"Is good stuffs!"
"Bless you." Greg kissed Mycroft's cheek.
Sherlock took the other piece of toast and crunched down on it in a big bite. "C'an we pu'd signs on'em?" he mumbled through a mouthful of berries and bread.
"I'll cut you a swatch in the morning."
Jawn was sitting up on top of Sherlock, his eyes half-lidded and his hair mussed. "My-?"
"I like it too, and I know that your brother does as well."
"Don't wann'a."
Mycroft shook his head; he had known better than to leave these two alone all night...at least, in the state of mind they were BOTH in, no matter how 'big' Sherlock had come across before he left the flat earlier.
"Yeah. I'm a little surprised how good it smells."
Molly gasped; "I looooove tha'd game!" she said, and hopped out of her seat. "Do you have hats?!"
Jawn frowned but did as he was told, popping the plug and letting it float on top of the water. “Y’ook, y’ook!” He hooted as the plug began to spin in the vortex of water leaving the tub. “Gimme the ducks! P’ease! The ducks!!” Jawn half crawled out of the tub to retrieve Sherlock’s duck from the floor.
"D'en mo', I c'n do i'd!"
“Shhh! Little boy pirates need to do as their captain commands.”
Mycroft shook his head. "No. Motion-activated cameras at the back and front doors. The video would have popped up on my screen."
...A few minutes later, Sherlock was gently snoring and Greg was having a hard time keeping his eyes open. "This Peep guy sure has a lot of friends he'll probably eventually eat."
"My'coff fun, e'ben if he n'ah a aminal y'ike us," Sherlock nodded to himself, picking up the mostly empty cup of applesauce and slurping the rest.
"It will hurt."
“Co'ders!” Sherlock kicked with his free leg and pounded his fists on the floor.
“Yes, it is,” Mycroft agreed. “And that’s why we’re going to change the subject, NOW.”
"I can't put him down."
Jawn was quite the wreck; all red eyes and ruddy cheeks, face covered in tears, nose running…heartbroken. “Y-yeah,” he sputtered, wiping at his face with the backs of his hands. “P-p’om, p’om-mise.”
"Tha'ds no'd faaaaiiiiiir, G'eg!" The baby whinged, putting his hand on Greg's shoulder and shaking him. "How I s'po'ssa knooooooow?"
"I don't think there's any chance of that happening." Mycroft entered the room, his sleeves still rolled up and carrying a glass in each hand, one of which he handed to Greg. "Did we decide on a movie?"
"Shhh." Greg took the dummy Mycroft held out and slipped it into Sherlock's mouth.
“Jawn! I'ma pup'it, Jawn.”
Molly felt several things as she watched him...anger at him, for letting himself get so bad, anger that he'd left the hospital instead of staying where he could get the most help, anger at herself for being angry, anger at John for ever,
"No-no." Greg took his hand and kissed it. "Hey, are you excited to see Molly, hm? Bet she's looking forward to seeing you."
“As opposed to hiding in the toy in when he didn’t get his way?”
He nudged Jawn back a bit and placed a hand on his cheek to get the baby to face him. “What is it that you don’t want?”
"You've been waiting years and years."
The car pulled up at the rear of the house, and the driver was opening the door for Greg in an instant. "Never will be used to that," he muttered, turning and opening his arms for Sherlock. "Come here, muffin. Let's go in the house and find you a cup."
Mycroft smiled at him. "Of course not, dearest," he said, and kissed Greg's forehead.
"Your brother was telling me that you had some owwies," Molly leaned down and dug in her bag, pulling out a polka dotted elephant. "Look, this is Peanut...can you show Peanut where it hurts?"
Jawn pulled a face, but he was too busy enjoying his ca’ge to be sassy.
"I like Daisies too, but maybe some of them yellow ones?"
"Myyyyy'crofff," Jawn slurred, giggling against Mycroft's sleeve.
"Oh."
“Co'ders a’ My f'idge!” Sherlock sat up and bounced on his padded bum.
"That's because you are my brilliant boy! You have excellent listening ears."
"No one's getting up at seven," Mycroft groused.
"Bugger. I hope you know what you're doing," Greg mumbled to Sherlock before he followed Mycroft down the hall.
Mycroft huffed a sigh and let one more swat fall as he felt the damp from Sherlock’s onesie seep through his own trousers. “I would much prefer if you listened BEFORE you were spanked,” he said, and  dropped a kiss on Sherlock’s temple as the little detective snuffled his agreement into Mycroft’s shirt collar.
When sleep would finally come, it brought the dreams with it, the nightmares that would shoot him up in bed, leaving him with his heart pounding as the passing cars outside swept shafts of light over Baker Street. He hadn't been able to even look in Sherlock's room. But when the dreams would wake him, he'd be tempted, so tempted to go downstairs, to drown himself in the familiar. Instead he would sit up alone, hands to his head and near tears, mentally cursing the entire goddamn world for what it had done. The painting didn't even haunt him from its place in his closet. The Vermeer seemed meaningless now.
“Yes. For now, anyway. Afghanistan made me less likely to think long-term, as I'm sure you know.”
“I didn't think you were an arena type either. You didn't seem that way back in the Capitol.”
"You wouldn't be so quick to bolt unless you had something to hide!"
John let out a frustrated sigh. “Yes. I am.” John rubbed a hand over his eyes, looking tired. “I hate the holidays sometimes.”
John hardly remembered any of what they saw at the crime scene. Instead he stood by on the brink of panic, speaking only when asked a direct question, trying to resist the urge to run. It was irrational to worry, since they had no idea who he was, but something primal inside him still worried all the same, filling his head with ridiculous visions of arrests and interrogations.
He sat in his chair in the living room, surrounded by the silence. Sherlock had said he lived here, all those years ago. It was hard to believe that the man who had occupied this flat so easily was occupying it in a different time, one that John couldn't reach. It felt like Sherlock had always been here, like Baker Street, no matter what year, should have him and all his madness in it.
“Well of course, what else could have happened?”
“Have you even left Victors' Village once since you got back?”
“Wasn't he one of those faggot poets?”
But after the barrage of emotional battery proved ineffective, their father stormed from the house, slamming the door, the sound of his car tires slinging gravel the final slap in the face before silence settled over the house. It was only then that the tension in his sister's body collapsed, and she quickly turned and went to her room, shutting the door so quietly that John could barely hear it. Their mother immediately moved to go to her, but John reached out a hand and shook his head, saying, “No. Let me.”
“How is the tedious conference in Edinburgh?”
“I really wouldn't.” Moriarty jerked his head toward John. “It's poetic justice, don't you think? Involving him in all this dramatic lost art business?”
Sherlock glared at the dairy section of the Tesco. He was quickly growing frustrated by the ludicrous amount of milk.
John had for so long believed that meeting Sherlock had saved his own life that he had never considered that the reverse might have been true as well.
Sherlock stopped, bow hovering right above the violin strings. He slowly turned around and found John pulling his own coat on. "What are you talking about, John?"
"Good. Thank you."
"Your dedication to a modified pagan celebration is amazing, John."
“I like to think of myself as realistic.”
an angel,” Sherlock corrected. Even as he said it, John could see the wings fading behind him, the glow disappearing. And a pulse jumped to life under his fingertips. “A guardian angel, to be precise.”
She almost continued, her lips parted, poised for another verse, but she stopped and gave him a self-deprecating sort of smile. “Those traditional songs are sort of dark when you really think about it, aren't they?”
John took a sip of the drink and laughed. “Spot on.”
“What makes you so sure?”
“Fictionalized, based on, whatever you want to call it.”
A grueling eighteen hours later, John and Sherlock were sitting in Baker Street's living room, laughing and exhausted. They hadn't slept or eaten, but they had caught a serial killer. Sherlock's earlier theories were confirmed. Five hours in, the cane had disappeared, as had the hand tremor. Seven hours in, John had realized this, and seemed confused but relieved.
John nodded, running his hands over himself, not feeling the gun anywhere. He felt his heart start pounding when Molly handed it to him. The cold metal felt heavy in his hands, but at least it looked like it belonged there. It had only looked horrible in her hands.
When they wheeled his body away, John remained rooted to his place on the street, a single frozen person in a moving world.
John could see his breath, a cloud forming in front of his face as his breathing quickened, his muscles tensing in anticipation. He looked at the other tributes, all of them eying each other with distrust and in some cases, murderous rage. He tried to find Sherlock, and finally saw him, his face blank, staring at no one and nothing.
by Van Gogh. We used to have prints of his paintings in one of the houses we lived in. And wasn't that Vermeer that Lestrade is so preoccupied with of a starry sky?”
“He picked up a gun and shot the lights out.”
“No. In fact she's sort of cold about it, honestly. I don't think she's ever been through anything truly terrible in her entire life.”
Mrs. Hudson and Anthea walked up to the two of them, and the old woman said, “We've coordinated this. You two don't worry about a thing. Just don't be alarmed. No matter what happens, remember that you're safe and that everything you'll be seeing is just for show, okay?” John and Sherlock exchanged a confused glance with each other. “Trust me.” The woman gave them each a quick hug and led them to their chariot.
“You make it all sound rather hopeless.”
“Thank you. For helping keep him alive, for standing by him, for coming to see him, because lord knows he didn't have anyone else.”
I have always maintained that each person wears their own form of armour. As Molly shoved her hands deep into the pockets of her lab coat, it was easy to see what she had chosen as hers.
Sherlock wanted to turn and run the other way, but the fog was the other way. He was frozen in his place, watching John go in and out like the other tributes had, reappearing a little bit closer every time.
Closer, closer. “John...” His face was less than a foot from his. The eyes were still all wrong. Not John. The face flickered in and out, distorting as it did.
“In all seriousness,” she continued, her smile still on her lips, “I hope you made good use of the day.”
“No. Not yet.” He caved, pushing himself up so he could pull his chair closer. And he allowed himself one luxury, one kiss, before he sat down again. It was so much easier to breathe. The early morning light couldn't be anything but relief, but renaissance, the gray light softer than all the muted shades of a Monet sunrise. “I love you, you know. And I'm so glad I don't have to lose you again.”
"Troublesome older sibling."
“It's okay,” he said, raising his hands in surrender. “Go ahead.” He spoke breathlessly. “Kill me. I'm going to die. It might as well be you.”
John laughed. “You can keep hibiscus flowers alive in England, but you don't know what to do with
John. John almost always saw what no one else could. But he couldn't see this.
And maybe that's enough.
John's heart rate started speeding up. He'd never been aware of his heart in these dreams. He'd never heard his own breathing, never been able to count the number of people in the room and have it be the same twice, never been able to keep the same paintings on the walls (sometimes they were paintings that didn't even exist). He ran through all his tests, all the things he tried to remember that meant the dream was nearly over, that the explosion was imminent and would soon wake him up. But all the tests failed.
“Hmm.”
“I think that when you
, and against the statue's lips, he breathed the words like a piece of his soul: “You have been a
“Lilac.”
He heard movement behind the brush, and thinking it was either Molly moving around or the thieving magpies, he continued in.
He crossed his arms over his chest, stared up at her from his seat at her kitchen table. “Mary, you know goddamn well why I cannot go to Rome.”
After what could have been two minutes or two hours, they heard it: “Code blue OR 3 all clear. Code blue OR 3 all clear.”
“I didn't think lilacs were poisonous,” John said. He withdrew his hand. “I mean, don't people plant them in their gardens all the time?”
When he came home that night, he narrowly avoided Mrs. Hudson, who was on her way out to run errands. He couldn't answer any of the questions she was sure to ask.
“Spouse, boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever? No, it's not. But this isn't a normal situation is it? Besides Sherlock, I never
He wasn't sure how long he stayed there, just soaking in his own home. But finally he forced himself to go up to his old room too bring down some more clothes.
“All right, excellent. And what's your name?”
When John looked back up, Sherlock was watching him carefully. “You helped save my life. Then you understand that at the interviews, I was attempting to, in some small part, repay the favor. Every audience is full of potential sponsors looking for their favorite tribute. Of course, the unfortunate reality of it is that we still aren't likely to survive this.”
“Maybe about the foxglove.”
“Too bad. You're the only person I know in London.”
“But Mary, there are some people who shouldn't even have a chance at being tributes. Awful as it is, at least on a regular year you knew it would be someone between twelve and eighteen.”
John could have been stark naked and no one would have noticed him. And he took some comfort in that fact as he gave one last glance over the scene before turning and walking off down the street.
He reached for the top button of my shirt, and I automatically flinched. He shot me a look. "Do you honestly think I can give you stitches through this?" I felt my face instinctively settle into a weak glare as his hands deftly undid the rest of the buttons. He slid the shirt back over my shoulders and down my arms. I did not move to aid him. His hands lingered on my wrists before slipping the cuffs over my hands.
“The Hickman,” Lestrade said.
“Earlier this evening, during the opening of the Lost Vermeer exhibit, disaster struck the up and coming Hickman Gallery when a bomb went off in the museum. When emergency services arrived on the scene, a second bomb was found, and crews are still working to make sure that the second bomb is properly defused. This has resulted in nearly all emergency personnel being removed from the building. It is unknown at this time how many victims are still inside, and whether those still inside are alive or dead. Emergency personnel have already reported three deaths, and many more taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. Little else is known at this time.” Behind the reporter, John could still see the hordes of people, which had only grown since he'd left the scene.
“Hmm.”
“About what?”
“I am. You know that. You know I'll come help with any case. I'm there if you want me to be.”
They heard the cannon less than a minute later, nearly overshadowed by the growling and the sound of Henry shrieking once before he died.
Reaching the exit sign was hazy, and he had to carefully set the painting down out of harm's way while he pushed debris aside so he could open the door. He tucked the Vermeer under his arm and forced the door open, the night air instantly clearer, even though he could still smell the smoke on the breeze. But it was better than the dark and threatening blackness of the gallery.
“I meant you and John.”
“Mycroft, I just returned from Afghanistan. I think I've earned a few months of not dealing with any more accident prone humans.”
"Not yet."
John brought his face close to Sherlock's, almost cheek to cheek, and said in a voice so quiet that even the Capitol would have difficulty picking it up:
John glanced in the direction of his bedroom, wishing he'd carried his gun with him that morning. Not moving from his place in the doorway he said, “Who are you, and what are you doing in my flat? How did you get in here?”
“Yes.”
He would try to stop the thoughts, but always failed.
“A spy movie, Sherlock.” John looked back to the camera, and seeing the blank look on Sherlock's face, gave him a channel. Sherlock reached across the table and picked up the remote, turning on the television. He watched quietly for a few minutes before picking up the laptop and going to sit on the sofa, setting the laptop down beside him.
“Whatever I need to be on any given day.”
“I think I've heard that name before, you know, but always in passing in the newspaper.”
Sherlock heard the beeping of a parachute before John did, and before he could protest, went to retrieve it himself.
“Oh, six or seven.”
Once he had done all he believed he could do, he took cover as well, and breathed a sigh of relief. And as soon as he deemed the frozen world unnecessary, it sprang back to life, and the deafening echo of an explosion shook the group of soldiers, many of them far more shocked by their seemingly instantaneous change in position and location than the bomb itself. His world returned to the status quo of a war zone, and it would be nearly a week before John had peace enough to question what all had happened.
"'We didn't mean any harm," Billy said, Baxter nodding along. 'Is there anyway we can make it up to you?'
Sherlock sighed and snuggled further under the blankets, close enough to his brother that Greg probably couldn't even get a finger in between them. "Awww," he babbled, and pointed at the screen. "Bay'bee."
“There is one last rule I’d like to add, Sherlock. This one is a bit different but just as important as the rest.” John glanced down at the soft face of his boy and steeled his reserve. “Sherlock will not manipulate or lie to Daddy.” He jotted it down on the list quickly, trying to gauge the response coming from his lap. He could see the younger man’s eyes working, mind sifting through their past, and their possible future.
“You're always busy. Surely whatever it is can wait.”
“Sorry?”
“Sit.” Sherlock waved his hand over the table, refusing to take a single step away from the counter until John was seated. Even then, he stayed in place for a while, arms crossed over his chest, only sitting down himself reluctantly and after many false starts. Sherlock watched him carefully, as if expecting him to fall apart. John tried not to startle him.
” Sherlock kissed him, no surprise, no hesitation. But it was John who took the kiss and turned it from something soft and patient to something deeper and far more desperate. Everything was the taste of whiskey and breathlessness and Sherlock's hand on his hip. “
"Not in the least."
"If you tell him
“Well,” John said, unsure how any of it would sound to an outsider. “He's alive.”
John looked around the little greenhouse, and amid the chaos, tucked back in a corner more for safekeeping than to hide it, was a single potted purple rose. It wasn't like the kind you could buy in stores at the last minute before a holiday. Its petals were far more open and full, more like something from a painting of a garden. It was almost perfectly symmetrical, its petals immaculate, and it gave off the lightest pleasing scent.
“This isn't just a show. People have died,” Sherlock said through his teeth.
“Look,” he said, setting his silverware down, “can you please just, not mention to anyone that I was there that night?”
“What?”
John was mostly sober by the time he shut the door behind him in Baker Street. He was starting to get a headache. He tried to be as quiet as possible, knowing Mrs. Hudson was asleep already. It was nearing midnight. She'd looked at him with so much worry when he'd left earlier that evening that he felt a little guilty. Did it really show on his face that much?
. Did you have any idea, at the time, how the novel would take off?
"Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull."
He wondered how much contact he would have to have with John between now and the start of the Games. John had tried to initiate conversations with him on the long ride into the Capitol, and Sherlock had been his usual difficult self, not doing a thing to keep the conversation going. He just didn't see the point in making friends with someone when they were both probably going to be dead in a matter of weeks anyway.
“Not as bad as it is for me to say that.”
“Do you know what happened?”
“Hey, stop up there, will you?”
When I went back to the room, Sebastian was gone.
“What are you doing now?”
One night, John was lying awake on his bed, recently jolted out of sleep by a particularly violent nightmare, when he felt the now familiar internal twist of the second person stopping the world. In between strained and panicked breaths, John silently thanked the stranger. He needed the world to be still and silent for a while, and was unable to focus enough to do it himself. They couldn't know how much he'd needed this, of course, but he still felt so much less alone in that one moment, where he was one of only two people moving in the world. The pause in time gave him just long enough to regain some semblance of calm and mental stability before he heard the cars outside his window again, and the second person went about whatever business had them awake like him.
A few hours later, they were sitting a few feet closer. Sherlock still hadn't said much, always redirecting the conversation to John. John knew what he was doing, avoiding sharing any details, but he didn't mind. He answered Sherlock's questions, and was always happy when he could get a few words out of him in response.
“Whitman. Easy to read, straightforward, and
But he had to have it on paper, a physical form, something he could glare at whenever he felt the need.
“How's Mary?”
“He's an archaeologist.”
Without warning, Sherlock reached out to touch the bloom, and John couldn't stop him in time, his hand finding Sherlock's wrist too late. A sinking feeling came over him as he waited for the horrible inevitability, the death of the crown jewel in Sherlock Holmes' garden. But it lived, and when John saw the look of triumph and delight on Sherlock's face, he understood what Sherlock had been doing all night while he slept.
But there was no time for sentimental farewells. John had one passing thought that at least Sherlock would be able to cope easily with these final goodbyes, since he deplored sentiment so much.
John looked down at himself, at the T-shirt and pajama pants. “Because I don't need one?”
John sat across the table from Sherlock at the restaurant. As always seemed to be the case, John was eating, and Sherlock wasn't.
“Those are far too heavy for you.”
“No, I didn't know. I don't think you ever mentioned it.”
“And who's that you're talking to that's important enough to rudely interrupt a conversation between a man and his son?”
"I was. Luckily for me, you knew absolutely nothing about milk and badly needed a voice of reason in your life."
Sherlock looked out into the woods, nodding. It was an excuse, and both of them knew it. But allowing it to be anything else, anything except the game, it would have made it all too real. And given their fates in the arena, the awful truth of missed opportunities and canceled futures, it was easier to pretend they believed the act than to admit anything more.
"Why?"
"Is that a compliment?"
“Yeah?”
But he had no great battles to show for his time in the literary trenches. Just old wounds.
“Yes. Besides, technically your bedroom is mine. Or was.”
“Good luck. The only person more private than John Watson is you.”
John winced hearing the voice yelling down the stairs. Sherlock had been doing some variation of it all evening, every time there was a knock at the door or someone rang the bell. Despite John explaining multiple times that this would be a night-long occurrence, the detective had apparently not been listening, or deleted the information immediately after being told.
* * *
Sherlock took it. "Sherlock Holmes."
But beauty? That much they had in common.
Sherlock furrowed his brow, not quite understanding perhaps what John meant. He looked back at the movie as the violins continued into a song sung by an elegantly dressed man. He was just about to ask about the piece when John said, “ 'On the Street Where You Live,' before you ask.”
It had been effortless, leading Sherlock by his hand to their room. John doubted either of them would truly sleep, but the idea of even just lying still seemed refreshing since neither of them would be lying awake alone. John's bag still sat on what would have been his bed. He left it.
“Look at this.” He waved him over. Sherlock stood behind him, glancing over his shoulder.
Eventually, he could no long avoid the stone house rising up in front of him. A small family home. Innocuous to the outside observer. Horrifying to him. He saw his parents' cars as well as Clara's. Harry's was noticeably absent.
“Well, you seem a bit glum, and we haven't taken a real trip together yet. It could be fun, get London out of our lungs for a while.”
He shook his head. “No, you don't understand. She saved my life. I couldn't save hers. I saw her get killed, and all I could do was kill her killer.”
her anything, without having to deal with that seemingly inevitable confrontation, without having to deal with her reaction. He wasn't sure what that reaction would even be. All he knew was that he wanted to avoid it. There was no need to answer questions, no need to get into a long conversation that had no chance of changing his mind, no need to deal with whatever cheap shots she might come up with as they fought.
Sherlock could hear John's labored breathing, and as the stars and moon were brought back to the sky, he saw John's wide eyes, and his now trembling hands. The face of someone who took a risk, who shot blind and could only pray he hit his target.
"And how did you determine that?"
awe-inspiring. Not to me.”
“Oh, I doubt you'd know him, sir, he's a poet. Not many people read poetry anymore, even writers like yourself.”
"Going above and beyond the call of duty?"
"I'm glad I decided to drag you with me tonight."
“I've never been considered a regular person. I'm quite serious, though. Why would I want to read grand epic poems about death and sacrifice for my sadness when I could read poems like the sonnet I sent you earlier tonight? Beautiful enough to make you feel the ache in your chest. Though it isn't even my favorite of Neruda's.”
“Thank you.”
When the last of the light had gone, the music played, and the sky was overtaken. One face graced the sky, and John could only be grateful that Molly's picture was shown the night before. He could never have looked at it.
A few days after the bombing, the newspaper did a huge front page story about it all, a memoriam for the victims. “The greatest tragedy of the decade,” the journalist called it. And it did seem awfully tragic when put in this context, a list of those dead in the explosion. The paper had gotten pictures of nearly all of them, from friends and family members he assumed, and had their names and ages under their photos. A grim thing to see first thing in the morning. John didn't even try to count how many photos he saw. There were so many.
“Oh no.” His face had paled, his shaking hands reaching instinctively for the gloves. “
Throughout the day, Sherlock kept his distance. He hadn't spoken at all at dinner the night before, and had slammed his bedroom door without even a passing glance to anyone else. The parade had seemed to exhaust him more than any amount of physical activity would have. And all day, John had watched him go from station to station. He split his time evenly between all of them, not giving anyone any indication what his strengths or weaknesses were. John wasn't sure that it was a calculated move, or if Sherlock genuinely felt he needed practice in all areas. If so, John hoped he had a steep learning curve.
"M-mmm-mmy f-ffaul'," Sherlock stuttered out between gulping sobs.
"Mmm." Sherlock took a sip of his tea, let it sit in his mouth...and then put it down only to pick up the sugar bowl again. "I also remember someone mentioning a present for when I was out of headspace."
"Maybe we'll be able to convince Myc to make us French toast for breakfast." Greg gently swayed them; "I follow the same recipe but his is always better."
"No. Greg and Sherlock are going to stay home with me." Mycroft gave Molly the last bite of her sandwich and then got up to wet a flannel.
Mycroft nodded. “For your Nana,” he said, pouring one last cup of water over Sherlock’s head just to make sure it was completely rinsed…if he didn’t, Sherlock’s hair as prone to looking weighed down and greasy instead of freshly washed.
"My face hur'ds."
"Very dapper bees." Mycroft shook out the pajamas and undid the zipper. "You put your left foot in."
Mycroft's lip curled into a disgusted sneer. "You're going to bed early, mister."
"You'll have to open them to find out, won't you?"
"We know," Mycroft said, and pulled Sherlock back to his chest. "But she's hard plastic, darling. That doesn't make for a good sleeping partner."
John had no idea what a tumblr account was, and he chose to ignore the fact that Sally Donavon had one, especially when it involved sex toys. “What’s it even called?”
“I'ma Cap'n. Swab a’ decks ya scurvy cur!” Sherlock used the red duck to squirt water at Jawn, causing him to sputter and fuss.
"No'd e'ben."
"Yeah. I dun' ma'ge him wear c'yothes." Sherlock dutifully lifted his bum when Greg patted his hip.
Sherlock’s pout deepened, and he shook his head.
"Signs?"
Greg finished getting from beneath Sherlock, settling the baby fully on the sofa. "Just a nappy change and then you can go right back to sleep, love," he said, while petting the baby's hair. "You'll be so much comfier with a dry bottom, yes you will."
Jawn grinned and scooped Sherlock up, hands under his bum. He grunted under the weight, but he got Sherlock up and settled onto his hip. Without the little detectives ‘help’, though, his toes dragged on the ground but he remained asleep, half thrown over Jawn’s shoulder.
"You don't have to do that, love; I don't mind."
fallen asleep, laying across Greg's chest with his dummy making small, fluttering motions at his mouth, his fist gripping a handful of Greg's shirt.
“Singin’,” Jawn mumbled, his eyes fixed on the screen.
"I'ds no'd sh'eating."
Mycroft goes limp before their eyes; "...Of course you can have your phone and your trousers. But I would like it if you stayed."
"Not with his medication causing him tummy trouble."
“If you’re a big boy, you can fetch your own tea.”
"I dun' y'ike showers."
Mycroft came out of the pantry to see Sherlock exactly as he'd left him, eyeballing the frosting. "I should think so. Helping tends to make one very hungry."
"You're both going to have upset stomachs."
"Exactly. I chose him as my partner because he's very good at carrying."
"Smart boy! What is this bit?" Mycroft booped his nose.
"Is your brother awake?"
Baxter leapt from the bush and into Billy's arms, chirping in excitement."
"Tha's rea'yee g'woss."
"I'd prefer to go with you."
“He always gets like that after a spanking,” Jawn said, climbing onto the bed with a book clutched in one hand. He pushed it towards Mycroft and flopped down next to Sherlock, then pulled the little detective into his arms. “Like he’s got no bones left!”
"He is
"Ca'ge i'sh in'na bag???" Jawn was already scurrying out of his chair. "I ca' ge'd i'd!"
"I y'ooooove pu'bbies."
“What do you mean he looks like me? I look like a rodent?!”
“What were you like?”
“I’sh Ca’btin Mean Jawn G’een,” Jawn informed him, already hunched over Sherlock. “Sher’yock? Wan’ Bunny kisses?”
"Let's get you unzipped so you can switch."
“No, Daddy. My bed is upstairs.” John stared at him with that damned unreadable expression for a few moments before his mouth turned up in a soothing smile.
“But My, we want to play the games!” Sherlock whinged, trying (and failing) to pull his arm out of Mycroft’s grasp. “I wanna show Jawn how good I am at claw machines!”
Mycroft only smirked and took a nice, slow sip of tea.
"I ne'ber getted tanned a'fore." Sherlock finally followed Mycroft into the nursery.
"Oh, because that's gonna go well...just like the hose."
Mycroft looked over to the side and there it was…the sippy-cup that he’d filled for naptime and then promptly forgotten about in his hurry to get the little detective into bed before he conked out in the middle of the floor.
"Oh," Molly said, and Mycroft could hear the increasing dawn of realization in her voice. "Oh,
Jawn scrubbed angrily at the tear stains on his cheeks. “I’m not a cry baby! You’re a whingey baby!” he shouted, struggling to get off Mycroft’s lap.
“Wonderful.” So much for ignoring poor behavior. Mycroft’s hands went to his hips and leaned over the big, screechy, weepy puddle that was Sherlock. “That is enough,” he said firmly.
"I don' wan' c'eam."
"A'course," Greg agreed.
"I think you just answered your own question love. Come give Daddy a cuddle so we can get you a proper tuck in." Sherlock's pouting but immediately sits up and let's himself be enveloped by daddy's waiting arms. There are warm kisses on his temple and a couple of squeezes from the arms wrapped around him.
"You'll both end up over my knee."
"Doing what?"
"Is f'ings I y'ike," Sherlock said, taking the watch out of the Tupperware and giving it a kiss.
“That’s what he implied,” Sherlock said with a shrug as he dug out a package of wipes, a bottle of talcum powder, and two nappies. Truth was, he sounded more blasé than he felt…it wouldn’t be the first time Mycroft had changed him, but that had been when he was actually small. “Why…do you
“He is small. But don’t tell him I said so.” Greg put his hand on Sherlock’s back and guided him back out of the of the greenhouse.
"And be a clingy, weepy, needy little barnacle when he's not? Yes."
“More p'ishing? Cap'n p'ishing boat, Jawn?” Sherlock scooted closer to Jawn, as much as his stork legs would allow, reaching out to pat the fish.
"Coo'ked?"
"It should have batteries in it already," Greg said, turning the toy over and opening the plastic hatch over the battery case. "Because I tested it in the store."
“Sherlock. Look at me.”
"We'll have something even better for breakfast, I promise." Mycroft took Sherlocks' hands and helped him out of his seat, then reached over and plucked the two stuffed animals out of the booster. "Here," he said, giving them back to his little brother. "Take your friends and go wait by the steps, please."
"Dun y'ike it..." Sherlocks' face scrunched as if he might cry, so Greg quickly changed the subject. "What kind of sauce are you going to have on your chicken fingers?"
Mycroft ignored Jawn and walked into the foyer. "Alright, here we are, sweet boy. You tried very hard and I’m very proud. Do you think you can go up the steps on your own?” he cooed, gently trying to extract himself from a labyrinth of gangly limbs. Sherlock merely clung tighter and started to cry in earnest. “I suppose not. Jawn, go on upstairs and make sure the door to flat is open, please."
Mycroft shrugged. "It keeps it fresh."
"Fas'est ba'ff ever!" Sherlock clapped and held out his hands to be helped up.
“Good boy…we won’t be long.” Mycroft patted Jawn on the head and quickly made him a sippy-cup before shedding himself of his outer coat, his gloves, and his suit coat. He entered the nursery, and shut the door behind him.
“No, no, no,” Jawn sobbed.
"Molly." Mycroft nodded at her and stepped aside to let her in. "Would you like anything to drink?"
"Go inside, both of you!" Sherlock spat, startling them both. The other men gaped at him, wide-eyed...obviously, he was no longer in headspace. "I'll finish looking out here myself, since you're the two idiots that lost him in the first place!"
"Only the Crown Jewels for my babies."
“Alright, alright…down.” Mycroft set Sherlock on his feet before he dropped him altogether, and smirked as the little detective took off like a shot--no time for crawling now. He followed after him, and was just in time to see Jawn placing a stack of printer paper next to the bin of crayons on the low coffee table as Sherlock plopped himself down at the other end. “I don’t remember Jawn answering my question…and I don’t remember him picking up after his excavation, either.”
Jawn put down his cup guiltily, the ring of chocolate around his mouth showing where he’d tried to lick the cup clean. "Yea'. Is all gone. Can we have more?”
"No'd me?"
Sherlock wiggled in delight, before groaning around his thumb.
Sherlock's freezes in panic for a second before he looks up at John with a wide smirk. Before he’s able to utter a single syllable of the pithy remark he has planned, John is across the room and pulling him up.
"Ummm..." Molly stared down at her feet. "Maaaybe...just for a little while, 'cause I still gott'a work!"
"Then you're taking your medicine like the good, sweet little boy you are." Greg kissed his cheek.
Mycroft gave the tip of Sherlock’s nose a quick kiss. “Of course you do. Like a gremlin before it eats after midnight.”
"Yes, dear. So, what shall it be, Sherlock?"
Sherlock groaned; "I c'n do it myself."
"Right," John backtracked a little, a grin on his face. "I don't want to hurt your heart... your bum is a different story." He worked his hand under Sherlock to playfully pinch one of his cheeks. To his surprise Sherlock Holmes giggled, and John had never heard a more pleasant or delightful sound.
"I guess that's supposed to mean he wants me to put you in this." Greg picked up the shirt and held it out to get a look at it. "Aww...I like this one," he said as he looked over at Sherlock...and then started to laugh.
Sherlock watched as Mycroft carefully scooped two cups of flour into the sifter. "Go on then...in the bowl!"
“Seventeen minutes.”
"Yes, dear?"
Jawn’s head snapped up, stricken. “You can really see…?!”
"Nah, won't be the same," Greg crawled into their bed and stretched out mostly on Mycroft's side of the bed. "Ain't any good unless you're tellin' it."
"A fry is what they sometimes call a baby fish," Mycroft said.
“No.” Jawn blushed as he was stripped of his trousers. Mycroft sat him up and took off jumper and vest in one fluid motion. “I don’t fuss.”
"Yes, so does Gregory." Mycroft carefully used his finger nails to skritch Sherlock's scalp and flake away the rest of the blood.
"You di' y'id!" Sherlock cheered and clapped. "We go ou'dside now??!"
"I di'nn'ah feel goo' y'ass nigh'."
"No, but it will be bedtime soon," Mycroft said before biting into a spring roll.
"He seemed fine. That's not an excuse," Greg rushed to add. "But he seems okay."
Sherlock grinned around his thumb; "F'ower'th."
Sherlock swallowed thickly and then opened his mouth, his tongue lolling out. "Cu'b!" he said, breathless.
“I know it is.”
"Somebody's been doing artwork?" John asked, holding him at arms length to look him over. The boy had glitter everywhere, glue had dried on his cheek, and there were stripes on his hands and shirt where he had been clumsy with the markers. "And a certain little man will need a bath."
Greg stood up and a glittery golden shower fell from his clothes. Christ, this was going to take forever to clean up. "Just let him rub, Myc," he grumbled, brushing himself off.
"I agree. Sherlock is the cutest, most adorable little thing."
"Ye-" Mycroft stopped mid-word, head whipping around to see the cheekiest grin. "You monstrous little brat."
“Yes, Daddy.”
"His other name? What are you...oh my God, I don't know how I forgot that you lot are part of the aristocracy," Greg flopped back onto his pillow. " 'Course ya' got like, seventeen names."
Greg grinned like the cat who'd caught the canary; "That's the cutest fuckin' thing-"
"Don't be rude, Mycroft."
Still chuckling over Sherlock's ranting, he bends down to kiss his cheeks. "Remember, your rules are to stay in bed after Daddy puts you there."
"Good boy, there you go."
"Heeeeey," Greg whinged.
Sherlock stood between the two and chewed on his bottom lip while looking back and forth. "Bu'd my tummy does no'd hur'd My'cobb."
"So, I c'n s'eep w'if you?" Sherlock peeped from the end of the table. Both Mycroft and Greg turned to look; the little detective was curled up into a ball in his chair, and was resting his cheek against his knees with his thumb in his mouth, watching the two of them.
Sherlock gasped and wiggled when a wet wipe touched his most sensitive skin.
"Do you think you can take some medicine now?"
“Jawn, please…let him borrow it, just for now.” Mycroft could hear Sherlock crying quietly and sniffling near his ear, while trying to watch where he was stepping as best he could with his little brother’s shoulder blocked 40% of his view.
“I think you’re both lovely.” Sherlock kissed John’s jaw.
"Take your time. Collect what you need. Watch for a big, black car. We'll see you shortly."
"I believe so."
"F'ree!"
"Noooooo," Greg said, unable to look Mycroft in the eye. "Let's just go lie down, Myc..."
Sherlock lifted his head.
…Jawn didn’t quite know how to respond. He knew how it was different, of course, and how each hero had their own qualities to bring to the team, but he couldn’t quite think of how to put it into words.
"Right. What are we watching?" Greg began to undo the cuffs of his shirt.
"Goodness! I think your Daddy needs to go up for a knighthood." Mrs. Hudson mumbled, flipping on the kettle.
Sherlock’s face did some complicated acrobatics, which Mycroft read with ease. “Of course, you are welcome along as well.” Mycroft took a sip of his tea; “A picnic in the garden.”
Sherlock blew a milky raspberry, but he was grinning ear to ear.
“Nooooo, My,"  Sherlock cried, burying his face in Mycroft’s neck.
Greg went and sat at the table,and then pulled the baby into his lap. "Poor, poor muffin. Such a tough night."
"You're the one who let him do it. I wasn't even home."
"No. Sherlock's elbow doesn't hurt. Jawn's elbow hurts," Greg said.
Greg just snorted and cuddled Jawn closer. "There we are, sweet boy. You've been changed, and now you're gunna have some milk and we'll get to sleep for at least three more hours. Preferably five."
"Means ole Greg needs to watch his mouth around little ears. Come on, muffin."
"No be'." Jawn pulled his eyes open for a moment before they dipped closed again. Mycroft took off his bib, marveling at the mess down the front of his onesie.
"Shhh, the both of you."
"F'ree."
“He was at the doo…oh! Oh no!! My! Please don’t spank Jawn, My!”
Mycroft couldn’t begin to fathom how John dealt with this.
Greg narrowed his eyes; "...Is this because I said I needed a little attention earlier?"
“No, Sherlock. This one is nonnegotiable.” He put the pad of paper down on the sofa and pulled the boy back down, wrapping his arms around his middle and giving him a squeeze. “Daddy loves you, little man. You are too important. Daddy would be lost without you.” John punctuated each statement with a kiss to the suddenly tear streaked face. “In fact, that is going to be on our list. Daddy loves Sherlock. So we can remember why we have the rules in the first place.”
"You aren't going to walk back?"
"Yeah, and when you stack them, it plays each note in that order and you can make different tunes."
“What if Mrs. Hudson had been coming up the stairs when you had knocked the stool down?” John said quietly. The very idea sent a fresh wave of tears down Sherlock’s face. He hadn’t thought of that.
...It was all of thirty seconds before Sherlock was, once again, straining against his hold. “Up!” he pleaded. “Up, My’coff…up!”
Sherlock took his second slice crust-first and rolled it like a sushi roll before eating it.
, Jawn–” he began, and was cut off by a triumphant whoop as the little doctor held a clenched fist high.
"Gregory."
"I'll give you want you want, little man," John promises, his mouth inches from Sherlock's, whose lips are puckered in a desperate attempt to meet Watson's. "I'll take my time; stretch you nice and wide so you can take my cock. Hard and rough, just the way you’ve been begging for it."
Sherlock whimpers but nods as Daddy guides him over his lap. The first swat stings more than Sherlock thought possible with his bottom padded in layers. The half dozen that follow warm his entire backside and he's openly crying when it's over.
"Why not?"
"Can't I just have a spanking and stay up with you instead?" Sherlock's voice is impossibly small and for a moment John almost relents, but in the next instant Sherlock is yawning wide enough to pop his jaw.
“It’s not that kind of owie, lad…Jawn doesn’t need any on his face,” Mycroft said, batting his hand away and covering The Crimson Captain. “All he needs is to get dressed, have his juice, and snuggle on the couch, isn’t that right?”
"Eye." Sherlock pointed at his sore eye.
"...Maw'yee c'n borrow."
"No, Sherlock. If you want to renegotiate then you need to safe word and age up for me. Otherwise we are going to continue forward just the same."
Greg blinked at him for a moment; "-You know. I looked all through the closet myself when the mermaid disappeared. I didn't see it in there."
“I most certainly did. That’s why I said ‘Don’t say it’.”
"What would yellow bubbles smell like?"
"G'eg, bo'ddle?"
"Glad you're both having fun," Greg said, pulling the dress down around Sherlock's shoulders, then helped him work his arms through the sleeves. He glanced over at Mycroft's little 'project'; "Where'd you get the pins?"
Sherlock sat straight up as if on a loaded spring, knocking Jawn aside. “Chips? You mean it?”
“And gummy worms. Thank you." Sherlock gave the girl behind the counter one of his best sham smiles.
“Yes, I see,” Mycroft said again, tilting away from Sherlock’s hand to avoid taking a bubble wand to the eye. On the screen, a man had just been dragged through a waterfall and presumably eaten…well,
"Mau'b?" Sherlock examined the cup critically. "Mo' b'ue?"
Sherlock tensed up and was about to protest again, but Mycroft put a finger against his dummy and held it there. “Hush.” He waited until Jawn stood (albeit it slowly) and looked up at him with a determination in his eyes.
"I dun' wannnnnn'a!" Sherlock collapsed onto his belly.
“Does Sherlock want to watch telly while My looks for a dummy for Jawn, hmm?” Sherlock frowned at him behind his dummy and clung tighter.
Sherlock's eyes widened for a moment before he smiled, making them crinkle at the corners, and hid his face against Mycroft's chest.
"Not while they're in x-ray, darling. We'll see them in a few minutes, though."
Sherlock grumbled into Daddy’s neck but obediently offered a meek apology when Mycroft returned to the sitting room, handing him a toddler cup of sweet tea.
"Hank!"
"That makes one of you." Greg slowly started Jawn up the stairs. "Let's get you into some comfy jams."
Despite a strong desire to clean them up himself, Mycroft handed each boy a wet nap; "Wash your hands, and Jawn, you’ve a chocolate mustache to remove.”
"I d-ddun know where da' f'ogs." Jawn sobbed into the phone.
"Quick rinse to make sure we got all the glitter-"
John barked out a laugh. “Chips are not a meal Sherlock. And a single serving of chips that it takes you all day to eat does equal several meals.”
“On’y ‘cause you said it!!!”
Greg dug in the cabinet and handed Sherlock a large metal mixing bowl; "The perfect bowl for a huge chocolate hunger."
Greg cracked open and eye and looked down at the baby--
Mycroft undid Sherlock’s trousers, and then pushed nappy and all down around Sherlock’s thighs.
“Ohhhh.” Two little boys gasped in unison.
"Wha'd is i'd?" Sherlock mumbled through a mouthful of cake and frosting as he held up a box full of colorful plastic beetle-shaped toys.
"Later enough that he's run all the sugar out of himself."
Mycroft split the half sandwich into two more halves, and placed each half in front of each boy. "Sit down, please," he told Jawn, and then told Sherlock to "Stand up, darling."
"Yes. So I should be allowed to come!"
"I mean 'plan', as in what to do for dinner, and how to keep Sherlock entertained until then once he wakes up." Mycroft turned to enter the kitchen, finding that all the play-do had been put away, and the table cleaned. "I was thinking, we should take him outside for a bit of fresh air."
"I d'un ha'b to si'd in a boos'er for a sna'g," Sherlock announced, putting himself in a chair at the table.
“Why just one?!”
"And Moana, yes." Mycroft put his arm back around his little brother and started to pat the back of his nappy again.
Mycroft cracked an eye open at him. "Worth it."
"G'eg go'd in tr'ubble?"
"I'ss o'gay."
Greg leaned back against the counter and picked up another spring roll. "Nuh-uh."
“But why not now?!”
"It'll take the hurt away, love." Greg kissed the top of Jawn's head and rubbed his back.
“‘Ron man!” Sherlock slurred behind his dummy, reaching for the now full hero sip cup. Mycroft handed him the bottle instead. The little detective immediately dropped it onto the floor and continued to reach for the hero cup, grunting in frustration.
"Spe'shull?" Sherlock whispered back.
Sherlock nodded up at him tearfully, his bottom lip quivering.
"Absolutely, small fry." Greg got up and refilled the baby's plate, taking the time to cut his chicken to pieces.
“I did. Are there dummies stashed in here somewhere?” Mycroft gave Sherlock a meaningful glance before pulling open the night stand drawer.
Jawn guiltily rushed to put his action figure behind his back.
"YES, we're picking the shells out." Mycroft raised his eyebrow at Greg.
“I’m sure being jumped on by naughty boys has nothing to do with why it’s no longer ‘bouncy’.”
"Maybe if we eat finger foods for dinner he can have a b-a-t-h right now?" Greg suggested.
He’d be gone and back with chips before she even knew he was gone. “What’s the worst that could happen?” He grumbled to himself as he slipped out the front door.
"I will, I will, I
Jawn showed Sherlock how to empty the duck of water, without squirting it into Jawn’s eyes. “He sinked when he’s got'sta fly.” Jawn shoved the duck below the water and quickly released it, sending it flying out of the water and directly at Mycroft, bonking him in the chest before hitting the floor.
But Mycroft did none of these things.
"Da...aaaa...dddyyyy." Sherlock gasps. "Puh...lleaassssse."
Jawn stopped his jabbering and laid his head on the table next to Sherlock's, nearly nose-to-nose. "You s'eepy?" he asked.
“Sherlock.”
“Yes, that would have been my next request, very good.” Mycroft slid the garment underneath his little brother’s backside and Sherlock dropped like a rock, arms still crossed the entire time. “But I was going to ask…don’t you have something to say to Jawn?”
"Yea, be'dder..." Sherlock wound up a fish and let it go, though he couldn't see it.
"Look in one of the other bags." Mycroft turned and strode towards the oven, intent on getting the cupcakes started...and couldn't resist giving Greg's bent-over bum a pinch as he passed. "Get him settled, and I'll bring the drinks."
Jawn scowled at the stoop before coming into the foyer and shutting the door with a bit more force than was necessary.
"As do I. Mostly because we don't spend enough time in it," Mycroft groused as he guided Sherlock into their bedroom and onto the bed.
Holding his change of clothes in a shopping bag, wet nappy sagging pitifully, Sherlock was positive he had zero idea of what the hell he was doing.
"Fantastic."
"Or marshmallow fluffy."
"I dun y'ike it, My'coff."
He decided not to let Gregory know about the majority of the list...only the pressing items, like the broken ribs.
"Mm, a silver lining."
"Not from four teaspoons," Sherlock said with a roll of his eyes.
"Yeah, 'ohhhhhhh'." Greg stuck the bowl in the microwave and set the timer. "Alright," he said, turning around; "let's get a bib on you big bo-"
“And that goes double if you bite me ever again, young man,” he fussed and swatted him twice more, right under the swell of each cheek.
Mycroft leveled Sherlock his best rage sniff but the little detective was oblivious. He twisted the handle of the umbrella viciously. "Why won’t the sword come out, My?”
Sherlock began to reach for something, but Jawn’s hand darted in first and snagged a little green (naturally) toy car that would zip forward after being rolled backwards. “This an outside toy?” he asked, eyeing Mycroft suspiciously.
He felt one step away from madness, and stored the painting away from prying eyes, even his own.
“That's what he said. And he didn't seem to mind telling me
John let out a huff as the plane began to taxi down the runway. “Four months.”
“That isn't all.”
John refused to speak to Mycroft. Any time he tried to call him, he hit
“Sorry?”
“Only the Capitol could make woods in the middle of winter so noisy at night. I wish they'd turn down the damn volume,” John said, more to himself than to Sherlock. Sherlock quirked a smile. John said Sherlock had the observational skills, that he knew everything with a glance, but John knew the insides of people's heads just as well, even if he didn't intend to know them.
He kissed her. “I'll be fine, Sarah.” She stood in front of him, arms crossed, her brow furrowed in worry. “Come here.” She wrapped her arms around him and held him tightly.
“Are you John Watson? The mystery writer?” He looked thrilled by the very thought, so John made an effort, forcing his Public Smile onto his face despite the fact that he felt like blacking out for several days, maybe taking some tips from his sister.
“Probably, but answer it anyway.”
"Why not?"
Absolutely, he told himself, it is all my own hyperbole.
“You will, though.”
“Shut the fuck up.”
“Then accept my apology. I rarely give them, so cherish it. It will probably be the last.”
"You know you do that out loud?" the detective mumbled.
“Like the movie?”
“What happened?”
“So, what? You think threatening me will force me into some emotional baring of the heart? I regret to inform you that it will not.”
can meet your rescue quota. Will I be stuck with this one till they die? Or is this a temporary situation?”
. And I have no idea what to do about it. But it's not important. Just having the cases, the work, the distraction. It's worth it. If you knew him, you'd know what I mean. There are some people where even breathing the same air as them makes it worth it. Some people are so
He sighed, rubbing his hand over his eyes. No matter what he kept telling himself, he knew the answer.
“No!” John stood up, listening to the dying reverberation of his own voice. He looked down at Sherlock and said, “I'm not leaving while you're sitting here wounded and covered in blood! I don't want to go! I'm sick of running and sick of fighting and sick of this whole goddamn nightmare! Don't you
John gave a frustrated sigh. “Sherlock, soon we're going to be paraded around the entire country. If you can't manage to leave the house how are you going to manage that?”
“No. Neither are you, apparently.”
Mycroft Holmes had to push his way into the flat, feeling terribly undignified as he did so. The door was nearly blocked – as was the norm lately – with a myriad of scattered art supplies. Canvasses and large blocks of clay, paint sets and easels.
John shook his head. He wouldn't be following in Sherlock's footsteps. If the war hadn't driven him to suicide, then neither would this. He refused to give Moriarty the satisfaction of having killed them both.
“No, I was just thinking about something. Don't worry about it.”
He landed hard on the other side, falling, the rock colliding with his kneecap. He tried to stand, but the pain was still too fresh.
. What Mary couldn't understand, what John had only just realized the night before, was that Sherlock hadn't found an act for the sake of bettering his own chances of survival. He'd found an act that would better John's.
“Mercy killing, then.”
She was quiet for so long he almost thought she'd hung up. But finally she said, “Maybe you should see someone, John.”
“Don't be an idiot, John.” There was the familiar irritated concern.
“I'm surprised you haven't told them their relationship is doomed. That's what you usually do.”
tell me I should go!”
“I'm used to it.”
“Well I –” He stopped, the sound of the door slamming shut downstairs. Mrs. Hudson never slammed doors.
John looked at the sky, still holding their hands up, and yelled, “Choose your victor!”
“Thank god it's nearly done.”
"I suppose we must pick our battles."
He stalked off to the kitchen and came back with a sponge soaked down in water. He scrubbed all over the marble, but the color would not fade.
. He didn't know who had written
“Leave together. If we wait for them to drive us out we'll be separated somehow. They'll make sure.”
“Perhaps I should tell John that you've been stealing my syringes. It would certainly make him come break the silence, although I can't guarantee that would be the only thing he'd break.” Sherlock's eyes widened. “Did you really think I wouldn't notice?” She reached out and grabbed his arm, pushing the sleeve of his robe back. “Look at that. Matching marks,” she said, giving a cursory glance to her own arm. He jerked away from her grasp.
“John, is there anything you feel you need to know about me?”
Sherlock watched John's eyes light up when the movie started. He was so thrilled. Sherlock felt rather proud of himself for knowing how much John liked this franchise. He'd seen the DVD box set in his bedroom one day when he'd gone to ask John something. Sherlock thought it was rather amusing that John, who had such an attachment to these spy movies, would end up leading a life much like it, constantly running after criminals and assassins, with his ever-present concealed firearm. Sherlock smiled.
This ended up more an epilogue than a proper chapter but whatever.
John stopped and furrowed his brow, confused. "Yeah, Sherlock, that's how it works...Oh, you've got that look again. I don't know what you're thinking, but whatever it is, don't do it. Like, you can't go by the morgue and ask Molly for body parts. She wouldn't be obligated to give them to you."
“Sherlock. What the hell is going on?” He forced himself to speak calmly, tried not to devolve into shouting.
"So, that's more or less the same conversation I had with Cathy. And I realized that I'd been having some version of that conversation with every woman I've gone out with, and they've all been right. None of them are ever going to compare."
Sherlock shrugged and took John's drink right out of his hand and downed it. "I'm making an effort to be normal, as per your request."
But he answered his own question even as he thought it: after
Irene and John both looked at Mycroft expectantly.
“I'll get you a book about how it works. Don't take it apart.”
"I'd go with that one, if I were you."
a terrorist act. It could have just as easily been an isolated madman, or a particularly vicious group of garden variety monsters. But
The man's brow furrowed. “I have never seen or heard of a telephone that looks like
“Pulse elevated,” he said, holding John's wrist up between them. “Pupils dilated.” John jerked his hand away. “Not a real limp, and not an act.” He turned, his robe swishing around him as he sat down again.
“This may be worse than usual. I wouldn't blame you for staying out of it. In fact it may be a good idea.”
John was awake most nights. But it wasn't as bad in his little cottage as it had been in London. When he woke up, he knew there was no one around who would bother him, or worse, come to check on him and offer their concern. He was able to slowly reorient himself, to quietly make some tea and rest on his sofa. He'd considered living in the heart of town, but in the end, he'd decided that the cottage would give him just enough isolation to keep him sane.
“Your tone when you talk about her sounds hateful. What is it about your past that bothers her so much?”
He looked up in the trees at the blades. The man hadn't hung them there of course. He was too weak for that. But his sponsor, that was another matter entirely. The trap set him ill at ease. What if someone else were to find a way to utilize it? To attack an unsuspecting tribute, walking through the woods like he had been? What if that tribute was John? He took his knife and bent down, grabbing the pieces of wire in his hand and cutting through them. All around him there were dull thuds and swishing noises as the blades fell from the trees, lodging into the ground or clanging off the rocks. With a sickening sound, one of the makeshift guillotines landed in one of the corpses, slicing into his abdomen, the moonlight reflecting off it, hitting Sherlock in the eyes. He squinted in the single slant of light.
Molly was standing next to Mycroft, chewing her fingers. In the midst of the fun, she'd forgotten why they all had the morning off.
more unpleasant.
"Yes, it is." Mycroft took a lock of hair and held it up at full length, showing that it stretched out a good four inches. "It would nearly touch your shoulders were it not for the curl to it."
Sherlock frowned at the thought, and pressed his fingertips into his side, hissing at the sharp pain... the pain cleared his head, though, so he was thankful for it.
"He'd wear a bespoke suit in there if he thought it wouldn't ruin the starch on it."
"Yea. B'ery sa'wree. Though is b'ery a'licious."
"Right, dumb question."
“I’m willing to bribe you, you know,” Mycroft said amicably, slowly reaching out to take Jawn's hand and gently tug him over and onto the bed while he was busy “thinking”.
Sherlock picked up the other half of the cupcake and held it up for Peanut.
"Fair enough," Greg put another bite of cereal into Sherlock's mouth before stealing a bite for himself. "It's bloody genius to mix'em like that."
“A'cause, a'cause Jawn would do whatever it takes to get the bad guys. An’ he was small before, an’ he was still the bravest.”
When all else fails…bribery.
Mycroft cleared his throat; "...Why I enjoyed taking care of you. Again."
“Not what I intended, but that works. Good job, Jawn.” Mycroft turned to the sink of dishes and put in the stopper. “Sherlock...if you want another prize, you’d better hurry up.”
Mycroft watched as Jawn snuggled into Sherlock’s lap, while Sherlock took one of the blankets that had been tossed onto the couch and wrapped it around the little doctor’s bare legs. “Do both of you sleep in half hour intervals now?”
"His ribs, far as I can tell."
Both little boys cackled as Sherlock whispered “fu'g” after Mycroft’s back.
Sherlock popped up as if he were spring loaded. “Jawn! Jawn, Jawn, Jawn! Up, Jawn, up!” He wiggled to try and get out of Mycroft’s arms and into Jawn's. “My'coff! Jawn!”
Greg threw back the blankets and made a face at how cold the room was. Then he stood up and reached for Sherlock; "C'mon, muffin. No one wants a soggy bottom."
“P’omi’the!” Sherlock added, shaking his head and making his curls bounce.
“Let’s check the footage just in case,” Greg put a hand on Mycroft’s arm. “Come’on, love.”
does, and then he'd either get a time-out out here, or maybe even a spanking, if G'eg was fed-up enough.
"My only issue is that all the crumbs seem to be on my side of the bed." Mycroft swept the biscuit crumbs off his pillow.
Mycroft took a clean flannel from the drawer and dipped it in the water. "Just sit and soak for a moment, pet. Do you want any of your toys?"
Mycroft tapped the top of Sherlock's foot; "Look, what is this?"
"That's very sweet and not even the littlest bit weird. Can you show me how your telescope works? I'm thinking of getting one for myself."
"When was it that you gave him his medicine last?" Mycroft asked Greg, watching Sherlock and Molly both as he ate.
"Eigh'd..."
"Come on, nugget, up you get." Greg helped Jawn stand up and then looped an arm around his waist to keep him on his feet. Mycroft followed him out, straightening his jacket.
He groaned, the sound low and deep in his throat...his head was pounding. His chest hurt. The blanket on top of him was stifling. And for some reason, everything smelled like armpit.
“Yes, I teased him, and then I stopped when I saw him getting upset. There’s a difference between playful teasing and being mean-spirited...you should know. Apologize to Jawn, please.”
"You're right, and I shouldn't have said it. Sorry."
"A little surprising."
"B'inny," Sherlock nodded.
"Greg will be back any minute with our ice lollies. Maybe we should try to hose you off."
Mycroft nodded as he helped Sherlock onto the changing table, gently laying him back.
Sherlock dropped his scoop into the sink and whinged when Greg used to the wet towel to clean his face. "G'eeeeeeg. A'w c'yean a'ready!!!"
"No one's peeking on you, cupcake...promise," Greg said, and carefully slipped Sherlock to the floor so he could get at the rest of the sparkly things.
was referring to the time Jawn threw up all over our duvet."
"F'ank'oo!"
"Hurt plenty, ya mean ole thing."
"So'gs are annoying. My fee'd ge'd c'yaustra'po'bia."
Mycroft only hummed in reply.
"Show-off!" Greg hooted.
“Mm-mm, no.” Before Sherlock knew what was happening, he found himself lying backwards in his brother’s arms with his bottle prodding at his mouth. “It’s not playtime,” Mycroft added. “It’s ‘let-everyone-watch-the-movie-in-peace’ time.”
"Ohhhh...G'eg no'd wear c'yothes?" Sherlock asked as Greg sputtered indignantly in front of him; "Myc!"
"You get plates; I'll get his juice."
"That's incredibly clever...I'm impressed."
Jawn gave him a beatific grin, the sauce on his eyelashes smudging against his cheeks. “I can have more, My'coff?” Jawn held his empty plate for Mycroft to see.
The little robot turned it's head towards him, and he saw that where it's mouth should be, there was a speaker.
"Me? You can't eat--"
"Y'ub'oo too."
"If you promise to be very careful."
"It's wedged against my back," Greg growled, digging underneath himself and pulling out the yellow dummy.
"Boo'diful."
"I don't want to wake him up again, Myc. Next time we won't get so lucky and he'll actually cry."
A half smile ghosted upon his lips and then he was once again on his way, back home.
"Something soft and bite sized."
Greg rolled his eyes, unsure how he'd ended up in the company of the two most dramatic members of their family. "Of course. Sweet milk for the sweet boy."
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably in John’s lap, his pout broadening. Being rude was just part of his personality. He did not mean too, it just came out of his mouth. Sometimes he felt bad later, but most of the time he didn’t even know that he had been rude to begin with.
Sherlock hung his coat and scarf carefully before walking down the hall to the nursery.
Sherlock's mouth is suddenly dry. He's only ever fantasized about topping Daddy, but to actually do it...he'd do anything to get the privilege.
Greg caught the finger that had been traveling to the baby's mouth. "That looks amazing, muffin."
Mycroft covered Sherlock’s eyes and poured another cup of water down the back of his head, rinsing out most of the suds. One more cup should do it. “Then who does…?” he asked, glancing over at the now-suspiciously quiet victor of their game. Though, the moment the last syllable left his lips, he already knew exactly who his little brother was referring to…
