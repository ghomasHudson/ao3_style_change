Tony huffed at that while looking at the scrawny blond who's ears wear twitching a bit. "He does...i think his been through a lot..." the brunette trailed as he lifted his hand and placed it on top of the blonds head. Petting him gently as he gave off a small purr. "It's a cold night...i didn't really want to leave him out there...not with his condition.." Clint nodded at that, the blond looked very thin and small for his species. He looked like he had had a tough life. Clint felt sorry for him And began wrapping his arms around Natasha's waist as he couldn't imagine letting her go through what the small blond must have gone through. He had Always had Natasha since he was a Little kid, she had been a Christmas present from his parents before they got divorced. Making Nat his only constant companion through all the tough times his had. And since then he had loved her and taken good care of her ever since then.
Tony could only pray to God that Steve wasn’t kidding when he said that the walls really were soundproof .
Too embarrassed Tony decided to try and glanced somewhere else but large hands had suddenly wrapped around his head again, Palming his face gently as the hands made him face the blond. “We’re gonna have to practice more...” Steve breath before leaning in again. Tony couldn’t help but close his eyes as he felt his heart beat rapidly again inside his rib cage, lips locking on Steve’s as the blond tangled them together.
Steve nodded at that thinking he’d be okay staying with Nat for two days..Nat and him had become very good friends over the year and Clint is a really nice guy who always gave him treats. “But if you aren’t cool with it I’m calling the whole thing off..i can just call pepper and tell her-“ Steve placed his finger on the brunettes mouth cutting him off as he gave him a small smile “it’s okay Tony..I’ll be alright..it’s only for two days” Steve reassured him. “But you see that’s the thing! This is the reason why I’ve never accepted projects outside of the city..and now-“ Tony began to babble making Steve smile brighter before nuzzling his face onto Tony’s neck, stopping the brunette from his jabbering. “It’s okay Tony..you should really go..Pepper needs you” and just like that Tony went silent and nodded in agreement, the hybrid always knew what to say.
‘Knock’
But Steve’s mom didn’t seem to care as she simply offered Tony a brownie before smiling brightly at him. “Make yourself at home darling..Stevie doesn’t usually bring new faces over here…why, you must be something special-“
“She’s doing good...i just left her with her heat vibrator for a while..” Clint answered casually as he ate the banana. Tony spit some of his coffee a bit at the blunt answer. “Ohhhh...sorry...didn’t mean to make you spit out your drink”
Thankfully on the day of the ceremony Tony was pleasantly surprised to see that the village protector seemed kind and considerate as he had even hunched over so that Tony wouldn’t keep holding his head too high as a sign of respect for him. he was thankful really since he didn’t want his neck to hurt that night as well. And even though the Hydra creature did look threatening and dangerous with his broad and bulky shoulders with arms and hands big enough to crush a human’s skull, nit to mention the long tentacles twirling behind him like snakes. the way he had looked at Tony with his soft blue eyes was enough to assure the omega that the hydra wouldn’t actually do anything to him that he didn’t want.
But no matter how much he wanted Steve he felt embarrassed with himself. The thought of taking advantage of their situation was enough to turn him off as he didn’t want Steve to only ‘be with him’ cause he had too. He cursed as he bit his lips as he trembled in his release.
No..he couldn’t let that happen..Thor couldn’t take Tony’s love away from him.. Tony was his..as he was Tony’s. Yes..he had to show Thor who Tony really loved..who really loved Tony. With a fierce look Steve promised he’d let Thor know who truly belonged with Tony.
When Steve had noticed the small notepad that the younger teen had left behind he immediately took it and placed it inside his pocket before Bucky and the girls could see it. Once he got home he immediately opened it, lips turning upside down as he realized what was written inside it. Tony really did like Bucky...and it hurt..a lot. Especially since Steve knew Bucky had someone else he wanted. He felt sad for himself and bad for Tony. They both couldn’t have what they wanted...
Tony couldn’t help but feel a little underdress next to Steve as they walked through the park side by side, as they held each other’s hands. When Steve had told him that they would be having their date at the park, he had immediately thought of wearing a plain black shirt paired with some above the knee blue shorts that had some floral touch to them. Finished off with a pair of slippers and a nice brown hat that covered his face from the sun. After all it was a really hot day outside. He had started to regret his decision as he thought that he should of worn something a little more..he didn’t know, layered? Flashy? Something that actually made him look like he actually put a little more effort into how he looked like Steve did.
P.S No editing so I apologize for now i promise to edit it later on
“You kids having a good time?”
Now it’s Tony’s turn to get frustrated XD
The sudden changes were honestly a lot to take in since Steve was so beautiful and gorgeous and so strong that Tony felt that the omega would one day realize that he didn’t need Tony after all. The thought had immediately made the alpha sad and scared. What if he was going to be a burden to Steve. After all now Steve was actually stronger than most alpha’s and Tony was just..well Tony.
cliff hanger XD...
Tony frowned when the omega who was asking him if he could help her train for her wrestling try outs next Friday had immediately paled and told him that she forgot she was busy on Friday, before scrambling away. Well..she must of realized Tony wasn’t really the best candidate to help her out with wrestling. That thought had seemed to put him in a sour mood right away before his eyes lit up when he found Steve smiling adorably at him with his incredible cute puppy dog eyes. The blond immediately leaned into him whispering huskily a ‘hey babe, I’ve missed you’ before suddenly pressing Tony against the bleachers, sliding his tongue inside Tony’s open mouth as he did. God was Tony lucky to have such a gorgeous, strong, talented and loving omega like Steve. he really couldn’t believe how Steve had still stayed with a loser alpha like him. back in the mind of his head he thought he didn’t deserve such a perfect omega. Steve was the whole package. And Tony would be eternally grateful to the gods up above for giving him this. When the kiss had ended Tony felt dazed as the tall blond whispered in his ear how he wanted Tony to mark him, again right then and there in the open field.
A chuckle had escaped his lips once he realized that the omega was nuzzling against him. God if he had known how clingy the omega would be he would of taken him so much sooner.
Tony smiled and gave his thanks to the two alpha’s and beta that were currently fussing about inside his room. Head resting on strong sturdy pecs as lidded brown eyes watched the three men bring pillows and blankets to his nest. He was thankful that Loki had let him settle comfortably agaisnt him. Since his whole body had been burning in excruciating pain from his heat the whole day.
So when Steve had finished eating some left over pizza, the blond had hesitantly called out to the demon to come inside his room. The demon had instantly sprinted from across the door and landed by his side in a matter of minutes. Tail flickering behind as he made himself comfortable in his master’s bed. Steve smiled at him as he placed his hand on top of Tony’s head again. Loving how Tony would lean into his touch and purr like a cat. When he had glanced at the small clock on his nightstand Steve could see it was already eight at night. Probably a good time to start feeding Tony. For some reason the incubus wasn’t wearing his clothes anymore. (Which Steve guess was probably somewhere around the house) He only had a tiny thong that did wonders on Steve’s imagination. With a nervous inhale Steve gently pulled his new demon’s face towards his. Blushing a bit when Tony blinked curiously at him. “A-are you hungry Tony?...” Steve asked with a shaky voice as he stared at him.
The two would of gone further if they hadn’t heard their friends coming. The two instantly backing off each other as Bruce finally reached them. The omega panting as he shouted at the other’s that he’d found the two love birds.
“Hey there birthday boy..” the an older teen greeted the brunette with a warm kiss agaisnt his ear. Peter chuckled as he tried to get away from his boyfriend. “Wade, not here…Tony might see…” Peter whispered as he unsuccessfully tried to get free. Eyes scanning the crowd in search for his brother. He instantly relaxed though when he finally found Tony sitting on a plastic chair, siping a martini as he chatted to one of his older friends by the pool. Steve was right beside him, with his massive arm slung comfortably around Tony’s slender body. Making his brother look tinier than usual.
who never doubted Steve’s affection for Tony as well💕💕
I really like making Steve panic...
Tony sigh as Morgan and Harley had started fighting behind him. “This one will be last i swear...” Tony tiredly said with a smile as he patted his belly when Steve entered the kitchen. “You sure about that?” Steve wiggled his brows suggestively as he leaned over to give his pregnant wife a kiss. Tony giggling at the way his husband’s beard was tickling him. “I can’t believe i let you talk me into letting you grow a beard...” Tony said fondly as he leaned up with his tiptoes to give the tall Alpha a quick kiss. “Are you complaining?” Steve asked with a fond smile. “Who says I’m complaining?” Tony defended with a laugh before finally putting a led on the pot and letting it simmer.
“Morning pretty, time to wake up...”
“Oh-my God!!! What the fuck happened to you?!!!”
Tony slumped down tiredly as he gave the blond a look. “Clint...i do get jealous...i do sometimes wish Steve wouldn’t spend so much time with Bucky than he does with me..but so what? I trust Steve and it would be too selfish of me if i asked him to stop spending too much time with someone he had thought had fell to his death. This is a precious and hard time for them...i mean if i found out Jarvis or my mom were still alive I wouldn’t stop wrapping my arms around them both..you’d have to pry me away from them if you dared..” Tony joked as he gave a weary smile at his friend. “I love Steve and would never want to tell him he couldn’t do something that he wanted to..which right now is taking care of an old friend he thought he had lost.”
Tony as well was a bit happy as he finally let the idea sink into him that he would finally be bonded.. maybe even start his own family. He had always wanted one, just never had the chance since all his suiters would back away. His excitement however left him when he had called and announced to Steve that he would be married off within the month. Instead of the usual supportive and warm voice he waited to hear from Steve, The line had went deadly silent for a whole five minutes as Tony kept asking if he was still there and finally after eight minutes of no response Tony sighed as he said his goodbyes sadly. He hadn’t gotten a text or a call from the alpha since then. He hated it. Hated that Steve wasn’t happy for him. And didn’t seem like he would come to his wedding as he wished he would. A huge part of his heart ached at the thought of not seeing his favorite Alpha on his wedding day. When they had been teenagers Tony even had this childish fantasy that he’d be marrying Steve on his wedding day. The two would play wedding inside their rooms and laugh and giggled as they both gave each other toy rings. Those stupid thoughts left his head when Steve had started dating other omega’s. Omega’s that weren’t his step brother. He had felt so stupid and shameful at thinking him and Steve could actually be together. Luckily he was past that now and was finally looking forward to getting married to another alpha. But still he wished his favorite Alpha would come and see him on his day.
“I didn’t mean to...”
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
———————————————————-
The omega patted his round belly as he chuckled at something Natasha had just told him while blushing hotly as Bucky gave Steve a knowing look. Natasha was a read haired human omega like Tony who was chosen by their previous village Protector 10 years ago.. Natasha was so young when Bucky had chosen her. It was weird and amazing to see her again all grown up and a mother of three half breed hydra children that seemed way too big for their human age. Natasha was also expecting a fourth one as she had announced that she was actually three months pregnant. Happily Sharing Tony’s excitement with his own pregnancy.
“What? No don’t go! I was thinking you could stay over at my place since you’re here…” Tony trailed with a sad tone. “I dont know…we have to get up real early tomorrow for-“ before Pepper could finish. Steve had cut her off stating that she should really be there with her alpha. “Come on Pepper..Tony needs you..you wouldn’t want your alpha feeling lonely do you?”
“Then why the hell were you naked?”
Pumping harder into the wet and messy hole. Steve groaned as his cock had finally swelled up inside the brunette. Cum finally gushing inside Tony. Making the omega scream in pure bliss as he came hard between them.
Oh no, someone knew..Tony’s life was over. They’d probably try and make Tony confess and make fun of him. Inside the science lab? After school? Should he even go? Maybe he shouldn’t. Maybe he should just go home straight away and never go back.
“So you’ll come watch the game this Friday right?” Steve asked as they continued to walk, hands still at Tony’s shoulder. The shorter teen nodded at that as he held his glasses in place. “Good...good..and um, also your going to be watching me practice this afternoon as well..” Steve trailed as he continued to look away from the brunette. Tony’s eyes widen a bit as he glanced at the taller teen. “You m-mean...I’m going to watch you and Bucky later?...wait w-what if he see’s me w-with you?” Tony stuttered as he thought it would be harder to get the brunette to like him if he thought that Tony was with Steve. The blond hummed at that for a bit before glancing down at him. “Then we just give him a good show...you know Bucky really likes a challenge, if he see’s you with me..he’ll have to notice you more..” Steve explained. Right, right..wow Steve really knew what he was doing.
Tony cursed as he tried to ignore Steve’s mewling and whimpering from outside his door, begging him to open the door. The Hybrids sounds only made his situation much worst as he continued to pump at his erection as best as he could while listening to Steve’s erotic sounds that were making him go crazy. Ever since he had taken care of the blond he knew he was feeling more than just ownership. Even when Steve was just a tiny scrawny thing back then, he’d have these urges where he’d want nothing better to do than kiss and lick the blonds beautiful pale skin. He had been absolutely happy once he had notice Steve had been getting some meat in him. But the more Steve grew and got leaner and buffer. The more Tony couldn’t seem to control himself around his beloved hybrid.
“You should really tell your brother about us…” Wade breathed with a sad smile. “I will…i just need some time…it’s just not easy telling someone else about…”
The blond stared at him as he sulked, staring at the untouched food. “I’m sure she’s alright...” Steve had tried to say as he leaned closer to the younger sibling. Tony glanced at him at that with a weary smile. “I know...she’s a tough girl...that’s why i love her...” the words didn’t seem to go well with Steve as Tony realized the blond’s expression had changed a bit. “Do you..?” Steve unexpectedly asked making Tony raise his brows at him. “What?” He asked a bit confused. “Do you lover her?” The blond repeated, tone serious as ever as his blue eyes watched the brunette. For some strange reason the way Steve was staring at Tony had made him want to squirm, Steve had never looked that way at him before. His eyes were full of intensity that Tony had never seen, Full of emotions Tony couldn’t read as well. Tony swallowed as he realized that the blond was waiting for his answer. “Yes...” Tony answered as he glanced back down his food. Not liking how Steve still held his gaze at him.
Tony couldn’t help to stare for a bit before realizing what he was doing and looking away. He felt like a pervert standing there while the other was half naked, wandering around and looking for a new shirt to wear.   The shorter teen didn’t even know what he was doing there? Surely there was nothing else they could do for the rest of the day in his room.
“Why...” Tony whispered as he shoved his head against the hard chest, “what?...” Steve asked softly as he leaned closer to the smaller teen. “Why do you always do this to me?! Why do you always make it so hard for me...I don’t know what i ever did to you...I don’t..you tell me that you’ll protect me..take care of me..but truthfully you ignore me like I don’t mean anything to you..you go out and leave me all alone waiting for you to get home drunk...and now you get upset that you saw me kissing someone else and then kiss me to ask if i want your kiss more than i want someone else’s..why?! Why?! I don’t understand!” Tony cried as he tried to pull away, eyes closed as he was too ashamed to even look at his brother with tears leaving his eyes. Unsure of what the other would answer.
“Have fun you two!” Tony finally said as he blew Peter a kiss and disappeared into the kitchen.
It was Commander Rogers, the other Steve they had been battling for months now. Hazel brown eyes stared curiously at the huge bulky Alpha who was walking towards him with the most devilish smile Tony had ever seen. Heart beating frantically as he inhaled the Alpha’s scent.
Steve blew out a breath as he waited for the kettle to whistle. He already had two cups ready and some herbal tea, a moan could be hear coming out of Clint’s bedroom door while the blond sigh as he stared at the television. “Again Clint i am so sorry for the mess..if i had known...” Sharon began but Clint just waved it off as he shrugged. “It’s alright...you didn’t know..” Clint reassured her as he glanced at her hybrid who had a swollen eye that she was tending to. “I think I’ve got some more frozen peas in the freezer for Sams eye” Clint said as he got up and walked across the room. Sharon nodded at that as she handed over the now limp pack of peas she was pressing over Sams eye.
Steve could only blink at what he had heard the other hybrid say to him. “D-did you say Cla-claim him? Your ma-master?” Steve stuttered with wide eyes at the information. Thor nodded with a bright and proud smile. “Yes! It has been four weeks since i have claimed him...” Steve could only stare at him with amazement as he finally relaxed in front of the other hybrid. So Thor didn’t want to take Tony away from him..he had another..his master..who he had already claimed. With a sudden curiosity Steve smiled and asked Thor how he had done it and if he could teach him to claim his master as well. The other blond hybrid laughed loudly as he patted Steve a bit harshly on the back, nodding as he told Steve his and his master’s Story as they headed back inside. The bitterness of that morning forgotten as they rejoined the other hybrids who were now busy playing video games, Happy to see Steve smiling again.
Once the older Alpha had finished signing the papers for his newly bonded Omega, now sharing his wealth. The blond alpha had no trouble in making things look like an accident once more.
Swallowing the thick milk, Tony opened his mouth for the king to see his beautifully worn out mouth empty.
But a slight blush did rise up on his cheeks when he saw from the corner of his eyes that Steve had placed his fingers in his mouth. Licking them a few times before carefully sucking on them.
———————————————————
The date last Saturday had ended in a good note, after Steve had made him feel absolutely light headed when they had finished kissing for the seventh time. The blond teen had asked him to go watch his game on Friday as part of knowing how to be a good boyfriend. If he was ever going to be a supportive boyfriend to Bucky, he was going to have to start attending their games and cheer for them. Right, he hadn’t thought of that one, Thank God he had Steve to teach him that. Right now Tony had blushed a bright shade of red as he saw a couple of fellow students stare at them. “Umm...I didn’t know we could kiss here at school were everyone could see us...” Tony shyly admitted as he tried to fix his glasses. Steve just smiled a dazzling smile at that as he placed his hand around the smaller teen’s shoulder. “Well...if you’re ever gonna be with Bucky you should learn to be kissing in front of other people..the guy tends to be a real shower..” Steve chuckled as he guided Tony through the crowded hallway. “wow...i never thought he was...I’m so glad i have you Steve..” Tony said with a cute smile that made the senior kiss him again. Tony leaned into the kiss this time as he felt like he really should put more effort into these things since he was basically getting all these for free.
Tony startled from his spot as he turned around to see one of the Asgardian Prince standing near the entrance to his room. It was the dark haired one named Loki Tony recalled. “Wha-..it doesn’t matter...its all been done now” Tony answered with a weak voice. The dark haired prince sigh before entering, “ we never meant for that to happened..we had found her a few days ago..and brought her with us..she was barely alive when we had found her laying waste in the harsh dessert..i had ordered for my men to have her fed and dressed..” he trailed as he stood near the windows edge. Tony nodded “thank you for that...”
Once he had reached a motel. He cautiously stopped the car at the parking lot as he looked around a bit. As he tried to get his Breathing under control he turned around to watch his brother sleeping peacefully. Everything would be alright. He’d make everything be alright for both them.
“You know Steve...i just wanna tell you before we go in...i have someone I’d like for you to meet...and i hope you will be welcoming to him” Tony trailed as he peeked inside the apartment before glancing back at his confused hybrid. “Welcoming? Is Pepper here?” Steve frowned as he stared at his master. “No...not Pepper...It’s..well you’ll see” Tony breathed as he opened the door wide and Steve’s confused look instantly turned into one of surprise as he saw a muscular blond haired hybrid sitting on their cough playing with his toys, golden tail swishing lazily as he stared at them.
Tony hums at that. “ i don’t think i’ll be able to sleep without you tonight ...”Steve said in a hush tone. Tony inhaled hearing that. “Me neither...” he admitted. Steve smiled before asking “Is it okay if we leave the video call on?...i think it would really help..I’d love to just see you next to me..even if it’s just in this tiny screen” Tony chuckled at that before nodding and saying “That sounds like a great idea..”
“Clint’s right!” Tony smiled with a fond expression. “ we’re all still young, whats the rush?…as long as we all got each other…we’ll be good for the next few years!”
“Tony…Tony, you okay?”
Something told Howard This maybe the Start of a perfect Relationship.
Tony thought as he decided he’d pretend as well that it never really happened, Probably for the best for both of them.
Tony jolted from behind the door as he heard the knocking continue, The brunette frowned in confusion as no one ever came knocking on their door. Tony and his parents were still new to town so they didn’t really know anybody yet. And most of the neighbors were never home during this time. With a confused look Tony cautiously opened the door to take a peek, hazel brown eyes going wide as he watched in horror at the teen standing in front of the door looking absolutely pissed.
Tony was squinting his eyes at whoever was in front of him. Winching as he tried to get up while reaching for his missing glasses. Thankfully the guy in front of him was kind enough to help him on his feet before finally handing him his glasses. “Than yo-“ Tony tried to smiled as he awkwardly blinked at the guy when he had finally put on his glasses.
Steve groaned as he tried to stretch, his whole body ached as he had been chopping the big three near the river for some time now. It was a good sturdy tree that would do them good when he’d start building an extension for The cottage. Since Harley had asked for Steve to build him his own room since he was too old to still be sharing a room with Peter, who would always bring Wade inside making the blond alpha squirm in disgust as Peter and the other would start being all lovey dovey in front of him. Steve had come to terms that Peter and Wade just couldn’t be separated. And he guessed Wade really was a good kid underneath all that stupid mouth of his. He had to be if Peter liked him.
Except when Steve was out hanging with his friends late again. Which was alright as well since Tony tended to do that from time to time when his friends invented him. This time however though Steve hadn’t texted Tony what time he’d be back. Tony frowned at that as he placed the cold dinner into the microwave so that the older sibling could just heat it up later.
‘i know your secret, meet me at the science lab after school’
Brown and blue eyes instantly widen at that as they stared in disbelief at the man in front of them.
Staring outside the terrace Steve frown in irritation as his friends had started laughing out loud with Thor. Why did Tony have to bring him here? He would of been perfectly fine by himself inside their apartment, Honestly he would of.
The two quickly turned around to see Tony and Steve standing behind them with drinks in their hands. Peter smiled back as he thanked them for the wonderful surprise. “It was nothing…” Steve grinned as he winked at the younger brunette. Tony playfully smacked his chest at the statement with an adorably raise brow. “Don’t say it was nothing! This is Peter’s birthday we’re talking about! The giant Cake, pool party, the A-list celebrity we had as an MC earlier! And that Paul Newman Rolex watch you just gave him two hours ago was not nothing! Steve! I don’t know how i could ever thank you!” Tony exclaimed as he waved his arms animatedly infront of the smirking blond.
“I ugh...just don’t like that Bucky’s still hang up over his ex-boyfriend that dumped him two months ago over summer...and i really want the dude to get over it..been sulking way too long really...” Steve trailed as he licked his lips that looked a little dry. “And I’ve seen you stare at him..it isn’t hard to see you like the guy..” Tony blushed at that, not knowing he was so obvious about his feelings for the senior. “Look if you like him, I’m down with that...i know your a good guy...better than all those people trying to get on Bucky’s pants..and if i were the one to decide, I’d chose you to be with him..”
“Hi boys…up early as usual i see?” Pepper greeted with the sweetest smile anyone could see. Scent right away filling the room as Steve tried not to breath. Because at that moment he could smell the alpha’s scent start to change as well. The two shared a short kiss in front of the omega as they both started to talk about Tony’s company. Pepper scolding the smaller man as she ran about stock sales. There was no hiding that Tony’s girlfriend wasn’t just pretty. But also smart and witty. It was no wonder the brunette had asked her to be his girlfriend. She seemed like the complete package.
Once the car had arrived at their house Steve thanked the two teens inside as he ushered his brother inside their house. Making sure the door was lock before turning around to face the nervous teen. Tony tried to stand his ground but found himself backing away until his back had hit a wall as Steve began cornering him. With both hands landing on both sides of Tony’s head. You mind telling me what you just said back there again?” Steve asked as he leaned closer to the smaller teen. “ I..I don’t know what your so upset about! So what if me and Bucky kissed..it’s not like I haven’t kissed before...i just wanted to know how it felt like kissing someone who wasn’t you...” Tony managed to say as he felt himself tremble at his older brother’s heavy gaze. With Big strong arms trembling on both sides of his head, the brunette couldn’t help but think that Steve could easily crush him right now if he wanted to.
“I’m absolutely sorry about what happened earlier”
“TONY! WHERE ARE YOU?!”
Or something I'm not sure really we’ll just see what happens XD
Tony asked frantically as he dove to the floor to help a fallen Thor who was covered with flour, burnt toast and cracked eggs. “I...ugh..was trying to make you breakfast as a thank you for letting me stay here...” Thor mumbled as he patted the flour off of him, A bit of yolk dripping from his head. “I am sorry...i truly don’t know how to prepare these things as my master had servants do these things for us...but i tried...” he said with a shy smile as he offered Tony a burnt toast from the floor. Thor was finally talking. A small amused yet thoughtful smile appeared on the brunette’s face as he took the burnt toast Thor had offered him, Blue eyes staring dangerously at that. “Gee Thor that’s really sweet of you but Steve here always cooks breakfast...so you don’t have to worry with that..and don’t worry I don’t know how to make perfectly good toast too” he said with a wink as he bit into the dark toast. “That’s from the floor..” Steve reminded him making the brunette spit it out.
Hope you enjoyed...sorry for any mistakes i really need a beta I don’t have the patience to re-read the stories again with my eyes hurting 😞
When Tony had leaned into the kiss he had shared with the older brunette, he couldn’t help but to closed his eyes as he had let the sensation and alcohol take over him, moaning as he felt himself get excited at the thrill of kissing his older brother’s hot best friend who had always been there for him whenever the other wasn’t. He had tried pressing closer when he felt his heart begin to beat normally again, as if the thrill wasn’t enough to keep his toes curling as they always did when Steve would kiss him. Even the lightest brush of their lips would be enough to leave the younger sibling gasping for more.
Tony and Steve’s eyes instantly widen when they had realized who had just made his presence known to them. The two feeling all too nervous at the thought that the man had been listening in on them in the dark.
The words seemed to get a positive reaction from the younger teen as he couldn’t believe what the big , scarier senior was saying. He actually liked Tony..and actually wanted to help him get to Bucky. He just couldn’t believe it. “Are y-you sure you really want to help me? This isn’t some trick is it?” Tony asked as he tried not to shake. He really didn’t want this to be a big joke..he wouldn’t be able to take it if Steve was just making fun of him. The blond shook his head as he said a stern  ‘NO.’
No sight irritated him more than the sight of his soon to be Queen gaping at another. Especially one that had spent half her life with him. He glared at her as she swallowed hard, trembling for her pathetic life.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mmmm…Oh God! You’re the best Steve…” Tony finally moaned as he took one of the donuts and put it in his mouth. All while Steve continued to pamper him.
Maybe if he’d insert his dominance more around the apartment Thor would get the hint and leave the brunette alone. With a rough cough Steve immediately stood up from his spot on the floor, where he was sitting on one of their bean bags and settled next to Tony’s side. Sneakily wrapping his arms around the engineer’s shoulders as he rested his head there as well. Tony glanced at him with a small smile before continuing to twirl his fingers around Thor’s hair, making the other Hybrid that was settled on his lap purr with content. A scowl appeared on Steve’s face at that before he nudge his head against Tony’s. Making the brunette glance back at him with a chuckle. “Steve...i can’t breath with you two big guys squeezing me..how about you make us one of your famous lasagna! It’s almost dinner time and I’ve missed your home cooked meals so much” Tony said with a fond expression. Brown eyes twinkling with excitement at the thought of being able to have Steve’s cooking again. The hybrid whined at feeling he was being pushed away but smiled anyway as he wanted to cook for his master and make him happy. With a light nod Steve got up as he went back into the kitchen glancing back a bit to stare longingly at his master who was still unconsciously twirling the other hybrid’s hair. Sighting a bit before disappearing into the kitchen.
With his cock thrusting hard and fast making the smaller man squirm and moan mercifully beneath him. The smaller man could do nothing but tremble and shake. “that’s it….Tony….ah..cum…cum from my dick pounding you like this…” Steve said as he watched in amazement of how beautiful his Lord looked all messy and open for him. The fight had died down in the omega moments ago as his breeding instincts had kicked in. Newly bounded couples would right away have this need to breed once they had finally found a mate to start a family with. And Steve was going to make sure that Tony was going to bare his pups for them.
Steve smiled widely as he declared the Prince officially his to rule over. The entire kingdom cheered as the King’s bishop finally came near and blessed the king and his new bride’s crown. Giving the two a small formal prayer before  showering them with holy water. Saying that now that Tony had drank the king’s milk he was forever bounded to the Hydra kingdom. Tony stood up as Steve beamed at him with such love and adoration. Glancing a bit at Loki and Pepper for a while. Tony smiled as he watched them stare at him.
“Ma, im home…” Steve called out as he opened the front door to their house. Tony following akwardly behind him. He had only planned to walk Steve home, but was a bit surprised when the tall blond had suddenly grabbed his hand and guided him to their porch before opening the door.
A stupid smirk was plastered on his face as he started mouthing something to Tony.
A warm smile graced the Hydra King’s face as he glances at his newly crowned queen sitting comfortable on the luxuriously large pillows beside his knees. Tony in turned smiled up at him with so much love and adorable the Hydra couldn’t help but lean down and claim the brunette’s soft lips. A cough from in front of them had him frowning as it interrupted their shared little moment together.
“No...no...Steve please...this is Pepper..you remember her..please...” Tony begged as he started to ramble his face filled with panic. And there it was again..no formalities or what so ever.
It had baffled the two Starks to why all those had happened. It was quite a trouble as well when Tony would go into heat and not have any available Alpha’s around. Luckily Howard could afford the most nicest heat toys to help the omega during his heats. Although after a while Tony would come out of his room smelling like his Step-son after his heats were done. He had confronted the blond Alpha back then of what he was doing. The only answer Steve could give was that his brother needed him. Sarah and Howard were very concern with this at first but grew to understand that Steve was only doing what he thought was best. “He can be very protective of Tony...after all Tony is the only brother Steve has..” Sarah said reassuringly back then. Howard could only nod in agreement as he Remembered Steve being the same with Sarah when they had first started dating. thankfully the young Alpha had warmed up to him, especially when they had introduced him to Tony who had clung to him right from the start.
It had been a shock when the village elders had asked for him to come forward when it was time to announce who the protector had chosen. He hadn’t expected the creature that had been protecting them for five years would ever find an omega like him interesting. Although he did know he was attractive to most of the alpha’s and even beta’s in his village. He hadn’t thought it’d be the same with the protector. Maybe this was his true calling after all since there was no way for him to reject being called out by the elders. he had done his best to avoid getting married to any of his village’s alpha’s due to him not finding them a good enough alpha for him. Not that they weren’t any good. It was just that he never felt they were the one for him. But when he had heard his name being call out from amongst the crowd, it was the point where he couldn’t say no anymore.
Tony was startled when a finger had suddenly tapped him on the back as he was getting some books from his locker. Face looking absolutely confused before melting away into a small smile as he realized it was the large jock, rubbing his hand behind his head. “S-sorry...I didn’t mean to startle you...um...good morning!” Steve managed to say as he placed a kiss on the shorter teen’s lips. Tony instantly blushed as he hadn’t thought Steve would still be kissing him even at school.
“See anything you like Tony?” Steve asked as he watched the tiny demon finally pull out from the box. Hand in the air as he held a red collar with a cute golden bell attached to it. Steve smiled at that as he started walking around trying to find some nice toys and a leash for the cute demon.

Outside the airport looking distress, he was in his knee’s looking around with panic in his eyes. Searching for his owner..I couldn’t get a word out of him..thankfully his talking now” Tony smiled as Thor looked thoughtfully at him. “Glad to know he warmed up to you pretty fast” Clint commented.
The super soldier instantly noticed the smaller man shift a bit in their shared seat.
“Pep..come on in…Steve here was just helping me relax..” Tony managed to say through soft moans. “he’s been so busy lately that i couldn’t help but lend a hand. After all…we wouldn’t want a worn out ironman on the battlefield. Would we?..” Steve smiled sickeningly sweet at the red head beta.
Thankfully Bucky was able to find an empty room where a few blankets laid on the floor. The room looked absolutely cozy as it was covered with fairy lights. Tony hiccuped a thank you as Bucky laid him down the blankets. Blue eyes staring down at him as he smiled warmly at his caretaker that night. “S-sorry Bucky...you’re probabl-hiccup, tired of baby sitting me...” Tony whispered as he pressed his head against the taller teen’s arm. He was met with a chuckle as Bucky assured him it was alright and that he really didn’t mind. Tony smiled at that as he snuggled closer to Bucky who had started wrapping his arms around him protectively.
That opportunity had come right away in the form of Pepper crying on his shoulders after classes that Friday, saying that she didn’t want to go home anymore to her neglectful uncle. Tony had been so upset at seeing his friend cry that he had offered her to stay with him and Steve, assuring her that she wouldn’t be a bother to anyone since it was only them at the house. Steve had been very supportive in letting Pepper stay, even offering his room for the redhead to take. Suggesting that he and Tony could crash together, Tony had immediately held the redhead tight at that saying Pepper shouldn’t be sleeping alone at this point in her life. Pepper was absolutely grateful for Tony being so thoughtful and considerate of her feelings and well being. That Saturday morning Tony had woken up to Pepper cuddling next to him, both smiling and laughing as Steve opened the door to give them both breakfast in bed. The two thanking him as they both started to fed each other. Tony was so occupied in taking care of his friend that he hadn’t noticed the older teen staring longingly at him.
The two then just stared at each other through the small screen. Worries fading away as the two felt content. After a few more minutes of comfortable silence Tony finally felt sleep take over him. Blinking a couple of times at his Hybrids smiling face he whispered goodnight
Once he had drank all his coffee and eaten half of the donuts. Tony’s eyes widen as he’d realize that his shirt had been unbottoned halfway down. When did that happen? Steve wasn’t kidding..he could get preoccupied. Before he could even ask. The blond had whispered that Tony had felt so tensed..that maybe opening his shirt would help him more relax. Tony couldn’t really argue on that as he felt 10 times better. On that note, he decided to closed his eyes shut for a bit. Head falling agaisnt his chair as he melted away to those expert hands.
“And did you like it?” Steve asked with a shaky voice. Tony frowned at that, not sure if he should answer honestly that kissing Bucky felt more like kissing a brother, which was fucked up since kissing Steve always felt good. Before he could make up his mind though Steve had lunged at him furiously, Mouth capturing his in an instant. Making Tony’s knees go weak as he instinctively leaned into the kiss. Feeling large arms wrap around his head, Pressing him closer as their tongues danced together. Before Tony could get lost in the kiss even more however Steve had pulled away, making the smaller teen whine against him. Face all flushed out, panting and beautiful.
“Yeah, it’s out…” Peter blushed as he tried to ignore MJ’s whistling. “And your brother?” Wade cock a brow curiously. “ we can tell him over breakfast.”
How did this chap make you feel?
Quickly washing up and checking on his Lord, Adrenaline running through his body as he marched up the stairs and into his Lord’s mater bedroom. Heart beating erratically as he saw the omega patiently waiting for his newly bonded Alpha. With his tits out and a tiny silk thong clinging to smooth skin. Eye’s going wide as he muttered the servant’s name in confusion.
Since a lot of you wished for more of this story i am happy to announce im making this into a multi chap! This second chap will be short but next one will be longer i promise i just felt like a little character introduction should be in order for this one..
With a small smile Tony wrapped his arms around his king’s massive shoulders, nudging his nose against the blond’s as he whispered i love you to him. Making the Hydra king smile with glee in his eyes as he wrapped his large arms around the smaller man’s waist. The two stayed wrapped in each other’s embrace before glancing at their friends who were busy cuddling next to them as well. Thor smirking at them as he played with A tired Loki’s wet locks.
Clint laughed as Tony stuck out his hand to give him the middle finger before waving off to Steve who ran up a bit to wave back. Two whole days without Tony Steve sigh as it began to sink in on him. Nat unexpectedly jumped at him from behind and had wrapped her arms and legs over Steves body.
Peter was bright red with all the food, gifts and people that were with him that day. And it really was all because of his older brothers friend, Mr. Steve Grant Rogers. CEO of SHEILDS corp. He hadn’t even known that Tony was close friends with the famous billioner until three weeks ago when Tony had finally introduced them. For half a year he had been wondering where Tony had gotten all those expensive clothes and gadgets. Or the fact that they were able to pay rent now for the past 7 months without worry.
Tony redden even more when he realized where his hand was, heart thumping loudly as he tried not to tremble. Steve would be off to boot camp after this and he wouldn’t be able to see him till the start of school again.
He needed this. Needed it so badly that he didn’t care if his alpha was going to yell at him after. But before he could get lost in pure bliss. Clint had suddenly interrupted them from their shared moment. Blue eyes staring longingly at him before asking if which one of them he would want to help him with his heat.
(See the end of the chapter for
The first time Tony had seen his chosen Omega he had hid behind his father, clutching nervously at Howard’s side as he tried to hide his blushing face away from the grinning omega whose eyes seemed to sparkle at him. His father patting his head reassuringly as he talked with his business partner and old friend Joseph Rogers, Co-Owner of SHIELDS agency. One of the top leading security agencies in the world. Howard, proud owner of Stark Industries got most of his security teams from them as well. The two weren’t really close but when the two were given the chance to have a small conversation regarding their son’s. Howard was pleasantly surprised when Joseph had offered him his omega son to be Tony’s future mate. Howard had been a bit worried when Tony had presented as an Alpha but didn’t seem to have the alpha traits one needs to find a suitable mate. Tony was already 13.
“Tony! Steve! You made it!” Clint greeted as he spilled some of his drink on his shirt. “Yeah…the appointment got cancelled since my dentist forgot his daughter’s soccer game was tomorrow..” Tony grinned as he slid next to Bruce, followed by Steve. “Sorry bout what happened with you and Brock.” Steve said with a worried face as he tried to pry Tony away from Bruce. “What? Come on, no serious damage…i’ll find my soulmate too someday…i mean, come on! We’re in our early 20’s here! We’re young and wild! We got plenty of time before then!”
When they had finally stopped, Tony’s eyes were lidded due to feeling a bit dizzy and overwhelmed with everything he was feeling and thinking at the moment. Bucky must of been feeling the same way with the kiss as the older brunette had just stared with soft apologetic eyes at him. Tony couldn’t help but to smile as he made it clear that it was alright. That smile had died down however when he had realized the door to the bedroom was wide open, hazel brown eyes widening in shock as he then realized who was standing in front of the open door.
Steve had been doing a couple of runs every morning for four months now, swimming for two and on summer he was going to boot camp. All while he was getting the right vitamins and meds and hospital visits. Sarah his mom had hired a trainer and a private doctor to help him in his mission. He wouldn’t be able to see Tony during the summer when he’d be in boot camp but he’d endure. He’d make sure that he’d be fit to protect his precious alpha from other omega’s swooning over him.
Talking for bout half an hour he was finally able to get a word from the now relaxed blond. Steve was the only thing he said to him, which made the brunette think it was probably his name. Happy for the progress Tony asked if he’d like to come home with him guessing that the blond probably didn’t have a place to sleep in. The hybrid just stared at him with no answer, giving  the brunette an aching feeling in his chest, thinking the blond didn’t trust him mixed with not wanting to leave him alone in this alley.
“Uncle Fury...” Tony gasped as he tried to scramble away from the blond. that seemed to be a problem though as His legs were still wrapped around Steve’s waist.  who’s arms seemed to tighten even more around him. Tony didn’t know if Steve was either too shocked to actually let go of him, or too stubborn to care anymore.
Especially when that omega had a plan.
“Huh oh..ugh yeah..sorry was just thinking of something while…you were um…busy…” the brunette coughed as he realized that Steve had decided to wear a plain white sando. Which somehow made him even more hotter than when he was half naked.
Which made Tony and Pepper flinch. “I’m terribly sorry my old friend..I didn’t mean to bring you any trouble..” Thor stepped in as he tried to calmed the angry king down. Loki standing by his side, cursing as he was afraid of what would happened. This is exactly what he had feared when Thor had announced their travel. The king was a complete mad man. But Steve merely grunted at them. “No...my friend...you did good...i swore to kill all the people in the Stark kingdom except for my Tony..and kill them i shall..” he snarled as he grabbed a fist full of hair from the startled dame. Tony grabbed his fist as he pleaded for Steve to reconsider.
big kiss to ditasitepu35
“Nonsense omega...you are much too weak to take proper care of yourself...toys are nowhere near the feel as a real warm knot..” Loki trailed as he pressed heated kisses on the flushed out inventor’s cheeks. It felt absolutely amazing as every kiss blew away small aches that Tony felt. They had been trying to contact Steve but for some reason he was unreachable. Thus, making the whole pack come to aid their trouble omega.
A small smirk had curl on his face as he went inside and gently locked the room.
Tony moaned as Steve dove his tongue inside him, ravishing his mouth and his body as large hands roamed him. Momentarily forgetting where he was Tony came with a shutter, making Steve chuckle as he continued to play with him. Opening his eyes Tony Didn’t know if he could blush any further as he saw Pepper staring at him with wide eyes and a redden face, quickly burying himself against the massive chest to avoid looking at her again. Thor was smiling beside the king pleased that the new couple were having a bit of fun as he rested his arms over Loki who merely drank his wine. “Perhaps your bride would love a little bath to clean up” Thor suggested with a laugh.
If you have the time a Motivational comment, like how did this chapter make you feel? What are your expectations? would really be nice to read..I’d love to read your thoughts ❤️Your lovely comments could really help me finish this faster XD...
“Why would you help me?”
“You have a cat?”
Unfortunately right now he wasn’t feeling very protected, as an omega without his armor Tony felt very vulnerable against threats since omega’s usually didn’t have more mass and muscles as the alpha’s, instead they had softer, more slender bodies compared to the alphas and betas. Except for Bucky and Bruce since the two weren’t regular omega’s. Tony on the other hand was a hundred percent omega, meaning he would be no match for any alpha who would come through the door.

The apple was a bit high up but it was the one Tony wanted, it was absolutely red with just the perfect size for his palm. When he had thought he had finally grabbed it, a branch he was stepping on had snapped. Causing him to fall to the ground. Thankfully one of the many servants had caught him, strong arms quickly wrapping around him as his apple fell to the ground.
“Did you take your vitamins?” Steve reminded the brunette making Tony roll his eyes as he said a “yes” but still had on a cute grin on his face. “Good...now come on...were gonna be late...” Steve smirked as he held Tony’s hand tight while stepping into the bus. The two always sat at the back with Tony always leaning his head on his older brother’s shoulder, Hands still intertwined together.
“So...should i still call Sam?” She teased, earning a glare from the blushing blond who immediately pressed the startled incubus tighter against him.
A few moments later two guards came in escorting an expressionless Pepper. “Come sit and eat...celebrate our newly formed bound as a witness from your kingdom..” Steve smiled and gestured for her to take a seat near them. Once the red headed woman had Settled herself on Steve’s left the blond made no hesitation to show the woman who her prince now belonged to. Tony had been staring unconsciously at her when Steve bit into his ear making the brunette shiver beneath him bit a small blush spreading.
ever since Sunday night when Steve had come home at God knows what time he had. Which Tony decided he shouldn’t really care anymore if he was ever going to learn to live without the blond, thankfully the older brunette was there that night to help him. Bucky was always there for him whenever Steve wasn’t, ever since 6th grade when the blond had introduced him to the older brunette. Bucky was like their other brother that always came by their place uninvited and most nights slept over when he got into a fight with his parents. He was one of the few people Tony really liked being around with. The older brunette was always so comfortable to be around and was almost as protective as Steve was when it came to Tony. That’s why when Steve hadn’t come home yet when it was already near midnight Bucky had officially announced that he would sleep over to keep the younger teen company, not wanting to leave the smaller teen alone unattended. Tony had scoffed at that but smiled inwardly at how sweet the older teen could be sometimes, Giving the taller brunette a few pillows and blankets as he made sure his guess was settled right. Once he thought Bucky looked comfortable enough he started to get off the cough But before he could stand up a pair of long arms had suddenly pulled him down, making the smaller teen yelp as he fell on top of his brother’s beat friend who was grinning devilishly at him. Tony flicked the older teens nose as he tried to get up again but to no avail as Bucky’s arms tighten more around him.
“TONY!” his loud voice boomed with anger.
The small blond halted his hissing, only growling in warning a bit as he tried to hide behind Tony, Natasha smiled in response before mewling and blinking her eyes slowly a few times. Steve, the tiny blond stopped his growling at that. Staring intently at her for a whole minute before blinking slowly himself. Tail and ears seeming to relax as he realize they weren't probably dangerous. Clint smiled as he pulled Natasha back a bit. Tony smiling on the other side of the hall as he finally found his keys. "So.... where'd you find him?" The blond questioned, curious where Tony had found the scrawny thing. "outside... um.. yeah..a few blocks from here...he scared me to death when i found him rummaging through some trashcans..he looked scared himself and hungry..tried to scratch me a few times before i gave him a muffin I'd just bought.." Tony said with a grin as the tiny blond nudged his nose against his coat. "He looks pretty worn out..." Clint said as he absentmindedly stroke Natasha's hair.
Clint wasn’t crying, no. Something had just gotten stuck in his eye is all. God, he wanted an omega like Tony. Screw Steve if he was doing anything funny with that other omega.
Loud slapping noises echoed out into the hallway as small sobs grew into wanton groans and moans. It was hard not to get a hard on when the Prince's seductive voice filled the hall, and the smell of hot messy sex drifting off into the air that they breathed. The two Guards simply stood in silence as they cursed the king for giving them unwanted hard-ons.
“Oh my God! Steve! Let Tony sit on his own for God’s sake!” Rhodey groaned as he watched the blond omega glare at him from across the table. Tony tucked comfortably under his chin as they had their lunch inside the cafeteria. “No! The minute i let go of him someone else might try and mount on Tony again” the omega snarled as he held the flushed out alpha tighter. “I really don’t mind though...” Tony managed to say as he tried drinking some nice cool mango juice from Steve’s cup.
“Once they’d arrived in the spacious kitchen Steve had settled down a chair with his younger brother on his lap. Nudging Tony a bit with his chin, making the younger teen whine a bit at the disturbance. “Come on Tony, we need to start eating now...school’s in half an hour..” Steve chuckled as he watched the brunette pout at him with his big adorable eyes. But obeyed when Steve held a butter covered toast near his mouth, letting him take a bite while before biting into the toast as well.
“I’m just really tired that’s all...I really don’t feel like getting out of bed..” Tony lied as he started to snuggle inside the covers, Placing his phone next to him. Steve nodded at that with soft eyes as he quickly joined the smaller teen. Tony couldn’t help but lean into the older brother as strong arms started to wrap around him. “ i’ll stay here with you then and keep you company..” Steve whispered in his ear before pressing his nose against it. Tony couldn’t help the rise of his blood traveling to his face as he stared at his brother’s tender face. “Promise?” He whispered as he leaned closer to the blond who easily nudged their noses together. “I promise...I’m not going anywhere...” Steve whispered as he pressed his lips against Tony’s, making the younger brother shiver.
His cries seemed to go unheard as the large Alpha continued to thrust into him with massive force. Small trembling fists pushing and shoving to no avail as the large body on top of him felt like metal.
There was a few seconds of silence as Tony stared at each avenger in the room with him. Heart thumping loudly in his chest as he tried to think clearly at those words.
Steve was his mate, but that didn’t mean it had to be only one specific Steve. Since Commander Rogers was also Steve, the omega couldn’t help but follow the thin line that would always draw the confused omega towards the hydra version of his pack Alpha. Making his head feel dizzy as his Alpha would grab him and carry him away from the imposter as the rest of the team fought the other and his men off.
And so they always cuddled close to each other whenever a thunderstorm was scaring them. They always held hands as they ran through the park with their parents smiling brightly at them. And they always took their baths together even when they had hit puberty. But that was all they did..they had never went further than holding each other tight and pressing next to each other as close as they could..all of that changed though the moment they had heard the news that their parents had died in a plane crash. Tony had broke down in tears as he felt his heart ache from the pain, lungs heaving fast as he tried to breath. His whole world had fell that night, Steve had held him tighter than ever before, had kissed him on his head as he tried to calm Tony down. tears also trailing down his cheeks as he did. And then that’s when Tony felt him. felt his lips pressed gently against Tonys. And for some strange unknown reason Tony had melted into the soft kiss. He had went limp immediately inside his brother’s arms. Heart still tight but now he felt safe. He felt Steve, his brother..that was still alive and still with him. With sheer desperation he clung onto the blond like his life depended on it. And he guess it did at that moment on, Steve was all he had left at that point. and the blond had swore he would never let go.
Really…no alpha was strong when faced with an omega.
Pixy stop pouting! Im sorry okay? I love you :) kisses

“W-why..?”
Crap...Tony really needed to do something with Steve’s thank you’s...
Eyes popping wide when Peter had leaned up to press a kiss on his boyfriend’s lips. Wade blinked a few times before kissing back and grinning even wider when their friends started to shout and cheer at the two supportively. “Guess the secret is out huh?…”
When they had arrived, there were already a few people who had already passed out on the front yard or sleeping on the porch. Tony beamed at the scenery feeling so excited as this was his first time being in a senior’s party. He hardly even knew anyone except for a very few people Steve had gotten to introduce him to. “Come on doll let’s go get some drinks at the kitchen..” Bucky said as he leaned in closer to the shorter brunette as the music had gotten louder, Tony nodded at that before he followed where the older teen was pulling him.
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing with my little brother Bucky?!” Steve snapped as he began to walk towards the two brunette’s, Grabbing the smaller one harshly as Bucky stood up with arms up high as he tried to back away from the angry blond. “Hey...hey..calm down Steve..” Bucky managed to say as every step he took backwards, Steve took another one towards him. “Steve...Steve..please don’t get mad at Bucky he was just trying to take care of me..” Tony began but was immediately cut off as Steve Snapped at that “BY FUCKING SHOVING HIS TONGUE IN YOUR MOUTH?!!” Steve suddenly screamed, rage taking over him as he turned to face the older brunette again. “ just chill out man...we just had a few drinks and stuff just happened..that’s all...” Bucky tried reassuring the blond as he smiled wearily at him, eyes darting over the smaller sibling nervously.
When asked by Sam why he was okay with Steve helping Bucky, Tony just shrugged again saying he knew how awful heats were and wouldn’t want anyone suffering through them alone. Even Bucky, Damn...Sam really wanted to ask Tony if he could be his Omega instead. Because shit, who wouldn’t want a smart, rich, non-insecure, caring, understanding and beautiful omega like Tony? Even Loki and Thor were starting to give subtle hints that they wanted Steve out of Tony’s picture.
Steve stared wide eye as he saw Nat for the first time be taken in such a way. And for some reason Steve thought Nat actually liked it more as she came right away at Bucky’s brutal pace and possessive touch. Clint had closed the door to give the two some privacy but all Steve could think about after that was if he would be just as brutal with Tony if they ever did it. With a shiver he brushed the thought away. He’d never be like that he thought. Tony was too precious to the blond for him to take advantage. He’d do it slow and sensual like Clint did with Nat. Or the other way around he didn’t really know. All he knew was that he wanted Tony and he planned to make him his.
I am soooo sorry I haven’t updated in a while...a lot has happened to me recently with the whole situation we’re currently at right now...I’ve been having a tough time trying to get through this all mess since the whole lock down and trying hard to get food on the table when the government hasn’t given us help for the whole lock down...so basically no work no food...hence my writing time gone completely out of zinc since my head is filled with worries...but don't worry I’ll be sure to update more of my stories! Next chapter is about a day or two to be posted! Hope you enjoy...please feel free to comment
Tony's chest ached as he didn't know why he still (even in death) seemed to disappoint his Father. He loved Steve, truly he did. But he felt like an even more disappointment if he bent down and Married the man who had betrayed his father.
It was suppose to be a joke Peter guessed. But, it didn’t stop the two brother’s from blushing bright red at the suggestive statement. ‘does he know about me and Wade?’ Was the only thing running around Peter’s mind as he tried not to panic. Unsure on how to react anymore. Luckily Wade had stepped in with a big grin plastered on his face at the suggestion. “Wow thanks! Guess we wont be worrying about anything tonight then!”
———————————————————
“HAPPY BIRTHDAY PETER!”
“Alright, break it up! Break it up you two!” Clint frowned as he carefully pulled Natasha away from the two male hybrids that had seemed to loose interest in the cake. And had started growling at each other, trying to impress and woo the read head. Steve sat perfectly still at the center not really minding what the other’s were doing. “Come on you two...no fighting...gosh, sorry..you know how male hybrids are around females” Sharon sigh as she patted Bucky’s shoulders. “Yeah..it’s Understandable..three males and one female together in one room..it’s just instincts really” Bruce assured. “Steve doesn’t seem to mind though..” pepper said as she glanced at the unfazed blond. “Well..his never experienced getting aroused near a female before.. not even when Nat’s in heat..never once bothered him that made him wanna jump at her” Tony shrugged as he took a bite of his cake.
“Me…” Peter blushed. “…please don’t think i dont want anyone to know about us…i love you so much..it’s just that your the only one that knows about me…of who i really am…” Peter breathed as he fidgeted with the taller teens open shirt. “Yeah i know…take your time.” Wade smiled warmly. Bending down to try and steal a kiss before a cough had jolted him backwards.
What do you guys think will happen next?? :) what could the next lesson be?? ;))
now that Tony thought about it Steve did save him. just not the way he thought the hydra would, Steve had alway promised him back then that he would make him his queen, even when he knew Tony was engaged to prince Tiberius from a neighboring kingdom.
The Alpha was already panicking again as he tried to steady his breathing. Tony wouldn’t leave him, he had to remind himself that. He kept on thinking of how happy Tony would smile at him whenever he’d come home during a hunt. Or how the omega would cuddle close to him after they had made love for the fourth time that night. And how Tony would say his name like it was fine wine when he was staring at Steve with loving eyes. No Tony wouldn’t leave him..he was sure of it.
The date had ended on a smooth note as Tony had handed Steve every information of him he could give. The blond had looked very pleased with the questions Tony had answered, even being so kind enough to pay for Tony’s meal even though it wasn’t even a real date. When they had stepped outside of the diner Tony’s eyes widen when he realized Steve had brushed his hands against him. A blushed spread on Tony’s cheeks as he felt Steve’s hand slowly intertwined with his. “Um...Steve...?”
The two never had the chance to continue where they had left off after that. But what happened on that lake was enough to put a wide smile on Steve’s face. Because now Tony wasn’t being shy with him anymore. Now that he was going away Tony had become more and more brave in showing Steve how much he loved him. When the day came that Steve had to leave for boot camp Tony had pouted as he clung to Steve’s side, making the omega chuckle as he promised Tony that he be back. And once he had gotten back he was sure to continue where they had left off.
“Daniel and her are together?”
Before he knew it he was carrying the unconscious omega inside his rented car. Wrapping his arms and legs with some clothes he had in the car. Tony would probably freak out when he woke up, Steve didn’t want to chance it that the omega might hysterically run out of a moving car. He’d seen the omega do that a couple of times already.
Brown eyes instantly widen as the words echoed inside his head. “She just left with her sister, but…we’re going to see each other again next weekend…” Steve smiled like a child who just got a new bike for Christmas.
They were the same fingers he had fed Tony with. And the alpha couldn’t help but stare for a bit. Not realizing how rude he must of looked at that moment. Steve must of seemed to noticed as he turned his head at that and gave the alpha a sultry smile.
Steve and Tony are in College now and it’s hard when Tony’s in rut..
Oh God!
Commemts are greatly appriciated..it’s what keeps Authors motivated.
Thor’s booming voice startled the other blond hybrid as he turned around to see Thor stupidly smiling at him. “ i already know all their Stories...and yours, and I’m not your friend okay?” Steve scoffed as he turned his back at Thor again. Frustration radiation off of him as the other hybrid slowly walked towards him. “I am sorry, i only wish to get to know you better..if i were to be staying with you and Master Tony for a while..I’d only wish to be friends with you..I’m sorry if you don’t feel the same..ugh i shall be going then..” Thor drawled as he slowly turned back inside. And then Steve sigh as he felt like he was being a total jerk towards the other. “Thor wait...I’m sorry...it’s not that I don’t wanna be your friend it’s just that..I’m..I’m jealous..”Steve confessed. A blush rising up his cheeks as he watched the other hybrid furrow his brows at him. “I am sorry? Why would you be jealous?” Thor asked with confusion written all over his face. Steve breathed nervously before finally explaining to the other hybrid how he really felt. “ I...mean...look unlike you i never had an easy life, okay...i grew up with absolutely nothing until..until i met Tony..until he found me..and gave me so much i never even thought i could ever have..And i don’t mean the clothes or food or the things his given me..although i do appreciate all of that..but i mean he gave me his time..his attention..his love..and i love him more than anything in this world as well! Probably more than my own life, and I would do anything to stay by his side and be with him. Even fight off anyone who’d try to take him away from me...” Steve finally admitted as he stared seriously at Thor who was also staring at him with an understanding expression. “I understand..believe me when i say that i do relate to how you feel for Tony...but..tell me, why would you be jealous of me? I only intend to thank him and you as well for taking me in and helping me find my owner..” Thor asked as he stepped closer to the other who was blushing bright red now. “ i..i know, i know you have your owner that you need to go back too but..it’s just that seeing Tony be so amazed by you..i mean your a Royal hybrid! And I’m just a Hybrid that had ben abandon on the streets as a kit...surviving on nothing but garbage..i was just afraid he’d realize how pathetic and useless i really was compared to other hybrids...hybrids like you...” Steve trailed as he felt a sting in his chest as the words finally left his mouth, Overwhelmed by the truth finally coming out of him. Breathing a bit to steady himself before continuing. “ and i was honestly afraid you’d want to stay and...and take him away from me...” he said as he closed his eyes. Feeling absolutely drained before he finally opened his eyes and stared at a very amused Thor. What? Was he really smiling right now? After Steve had just poured his heart out he was smiling like an absolute goof. “What’s so funny?” Steve demanded with a hurt look.
But he didn’t know what else he could do to get the brunette to notice him, let alone actually talk to him. Every time he had the chance to go near the shorter teen, the brunette always ended up bolting like lighting, running away like Steve was death itself. Bucky had told him numerous times he really needed to work on his facial expressions when he liked someone.  He couldn’t help it if he had a hard look every time Tony saw him. He’d seen the younger teen stare at Bucky a few times which always put him off since he wanted the smaller brunette to look at him instead. A scowl would appear on his face as he’d watch with longing eyes at the other teen staring at his best friend.
Tony was busy climbing up a tree in the gardens, trying to get one of the delicious apples the fruit bare as he was still not aloud outside the palace walls. He had wanted to see the king with the rest of the people, but he was hidden away inside the gardens as the king had requested before his departure. Tony had frowned at that but decided on obeying, least he wanted to see the man angry at him.
The king hummed at the sensation of Tony’s hands rubbing and roaming the edges of his wet body. Face burning beat red as tried to control his inner desire to take him then and there. He really should wait since it would be rude to interrupt Tony with bathing him.  Instead he focused his hands on roaming the smaller man’s body as he started rubbing some oil on his palms as well and spreading it on Tony’s back and neck. A small moan escaped the brunette’s trembling lips as he started to wiggled his ass a bit on Steve’s erection. Steve chuckled at the brunette’s action. Guess he wasn’t the only one getting impatient. With a hot breath he leaned over Tony’s shoulder as he ordered Tony to lift his ass up a bit.
So when no Alpha was available to ease Tony during his heat Howard could understand why Steve would have the need to help his step-brother out. He was grateful for the ever caring step-son he had that was a wonderful brother to his own son. If things were different he would of actually liked Steve to be Tony’s mate. But he couldn’t think of such nonsense. Thankfully when Steve had been hired as a university professor at A different state. Killian had offered to help Tony during his heats. For some reason nothing bad had happened to the blond Alpha, giving Howard hope that perhaps Tony could finally be mated and give Howard peace that his omega son would finally be settled.
Steve stared at his panting bride who had burrowed himself against Steve chest. “Yes...perhaps he would...would you two care to join us?” He glanced up with a smile.
———————————————————
“You can thank me once i get you all hot and bothered in bed..” Steve grinned as he carried the giggling brunette into the master bedroom.
Sam and Nat were busy gawking at Thor as he told them more stories about himself and his family. Steve huffed at that and settled to sit next to Bucky who was busy watching TV, at least Bucky didn’t seem all that interested in him. “What are we watching?” Steve asked with a smile as he sat down next to Bucky on the sofa. “ nothing really...I’m actually looking for that reality TV show where they show royal hybrids and their owners...Thor says there are only 15 episodes of that show...said him and his owner were in it one time..i think I remember it being on channel 9 or something..” Bucky said with full on concentration at the TV. Steve just sigh at that as he got up to go to the terrace instead. He didn’t think he could stand much more of the Royal Hybrid.
But when he saw Tony crying outside their house where apparently the wedding was held. He couldn’t help but feel his inner alpha telling him to protect the crumbling omega. Tony was not happy with his alpha..the omega didn’t want this wedding as much ad he did. And when his eyes caught sight of his dog tag still hanging around the omega’s neck when he was already in his wedding suit. It was all it took to snap Steve out of rationality. In one minute he was walking towards his brother, saw Tony look at him with a surprised and confused look on his face as he blurted ‘your still here’, the next minute he had crashed their lips together in a passionate kiss. not caring anymore of what he was doing..thankfully Tony was kissing him back this time as Tony’s hands clung to him. He had never been so glad that he decided to come back. just to get a glimpse of his brother before he got wed to another.
“Sam and Bucky happened that’s what..hey Tony..” Sharon waved as she pressed the cold pack against a winching Sam. “Hey Sharon..wait, why?” Tony furrowed his brows. “Nat’s in heat remember..” Clint answered as he sipped his tea. Tony gave an ‘oh’ as he stared at Sam guessing Bucky won. In that instant a moan and a growl could be heard from Clint’s room leaving another awkward silence in the room they were in before Tony patted Steve’s back. “Welp...as much fun it would be to sit and listen to Bucky breeding Nat i think me and Steve should get going..i um..have a surprise for him waiting in the apartment..ugh..sorry if we cant stay and help Clint..” Tony gave an apologetic expression at the blond. “It’s alright..you should unpack and stuff..sides Sharon and Sam are here so..” Clint trailed with a smile as he looked at Tony. The brunette smiling as well at that “dinner at my place tomorrow bud...” Tony winked as he gripped Steve closer before saying goodbye and closing the door.
when the practice was almost over Tony hadn’t even realized that he was staring more at Steve than he was at Bucky. His stomach would do this flip flop whenever he saw Steve wave at him. Bucky was also waving at him now. But he couldn’t help but feel more happy when it was Steve seeking his attention.
Tony didn’t even have enough time to cover himself when Steve had suddenly locked the door and jumped on him.large hands ripping off the omega’s only remaining clothing.
There was just something about the Hydra who the elder’s have finally named Steve, that had instantly pulled a few strings in the brunette’s heart. maybe it was how he carried himself on the ceremony or how he stared longingly at Tony that the omega couldn’t help but blush at feeing so wanted by such a powerful beast. Or maybe it was because the protector was incredibly handsome for a monster who lurks around the bushes. Whatever it was..All he knew was that he was actually looking forward to becoming the protectors mate.

(See the end of the chapter for
A small smirk had form on the side of his face as he carefully caressed the sides of a very dazed out Tony. Who had begun to snuggle closer beneath him. Face flushed and intoxicating as always. It wouldn’t be easy…but then his life was never easy to begin with.
King Howard had trusted Steve as an allay to the Stark kingdom as they concurred kingdom after kingdom together back then, he had never expected the Hydra to invade prince Tiberius’s kingdom and impale him and his parents with his sword when Howard had declined the Hydra for his son’s hand in marriage, thinking the blond king would understand. As the Starks and Stones had had the engagement arranged since they were infants. Apparently Steve didn’t take it that well and had decided to kill off the competition, sending the deceased prince’s head to the angered Stark king. Tony had trembled at the sight of his childhood companion who he use to compete with in games and studies. He had not expect Steve to do something so horrid as send a decapitated head as a declaration of his love for him. Two days after, the Hydra army had finally arrived surrounding The kingdom. Demanding for the Prince as the Starks had closed their gates at the unwelcome visitors, it had taken a day before Tony was shoved at the king’s feet bound gaged and beaten. It appeared Howard had blamed him of the whole incident, angry as his trusted allay had murdered his future son in-law, Tiberius the son he wanted to have instead of Tony. With his anger he had made his soldiers hang Tony up on a large wooden pole, letting the people in his kingdom think badly at the prince by telling them he was a curse to all of them. As he was the reason their beloved Queen’s death 19 years ago and now was the same reason for the innocent Prince Tiberuis decapitation. The people boo’d Tony and threw rotten fruits at him, spitting at him as he gaged on a dirtied clothe. Pepper crying on the side as she shouted at them to leave him alone as she tried to shield him from them.
When they were finally done, Steve lead his demon inside the room fury had entered earlier. The room was surprisingly dark, with only a green dim light shining above them. Fury was already sitting beside a thin trail of dirt that was shaped into a the devil’s star. Fury quickly gestured for the two to step inside the symbol as he began flipping some pages in a black book. When Steve and Tony were finally seated inside the star in an Indian fashion, Fury then asked Tony to repeat Steve’s name six times. The tiny incubus did as instructed but with a different language that Steve’s didn’t think was human. When the incubus was done Fury started speaking in latin as he read through the pages. Steve couldn’t help but feel a strange overwhelming burn start to spread throughout his body. He gripped his knees tightly as he felt a burning sensation start to spread inside him. Consuming him little by little.
Tony couldn’t help the smile spreading across his face as Bucky had sent him a funny GIF that afternoon.
Even when he was in heat or Tony was in his rut the two couldn’t help each other. As their parents wanted them to do everything the traditional way. With the two of them not only bonding at the age of 20 but also not mating until then..which was completely stupid since their parents didn’t follow that tradition as well. Honestly he was getting even more impatient in being more intimate with Tony since by the end of the school year he wouldn’t be able to see Tony till after boot camp was over. With a deafeted sigh Steve helped Tony button his shirt, smirking a bit when he noticed the Alpha was still blushing at the thought of Steve’s father watching them.
Tony swore he felt his heart break at the soft way the omega was begging for him. Eyes all big, distress scent filling his nostrils..all while Steve tilted his head to the side, exposing his neck submissively At the alpha.
Said hybrid quickly swallowed and looked absolutely defeated when Tony took out the giant muffin from inside his coat’s pocket. He quickly tore it off the brown paper bag it was in and lifted it up in the air for the blond to see.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cross your fingers if i decided to add another chap!
" Soon enough...i will make you bend for me my love.." Steve whispered as he kissed Tony's sweaty forehead with a small grin. Oh how he admired Tony's foolish bravery, thinking that he could still manage to keep the Stark dignity intact.
After that, everything had became easier for the brunette. Every morning he would wake up to his older brother kissing him and loving him. And at school he’d pretend he didn’t just see Peggy lean against Steve with her arms around his as the two laughed with their other friends. Eventually Tony had accepted that Steve and Peggy were probably dating. Too hurt to ask Steve anything, he decided to leave it. If Steve still didn’t want to tell him, he wouldn’t pry. And in a way he was happy for Steve. After all..all Tony ever wanted for his brother was for him to be happy. But it did hurt though.. the thought that Steve would one day probably leave him and have a family of his own. Then who would Tony have...
The next day everyone ignored how the queen was limping as he walked around the castle with a pie in his hands. They all knew the reason for Tony’s awkward walk as the king had made it very clear last night how much he had missed him. Tony winced a bit as he stopped to sigh. He had had one of the cooks bake him a pie to give the servant who had saved him from the fall yesterday. But for some reason he had not been able to see him all day.
The blond was eagerly excited to buy his little demon a few things before they went home. Thankful that Natasha had thought of giving Tony to him before considering anyone else. He didn’t know if he could take it if he saw Tony being owned by his other friends. The incubus was just too cute to pass up and god damn he had to give Nat something really nice now as a thank you.
———————————————————-
Steve growled as he thrusted faster inside the brunette's already limp body, groaning at the Brunette's hole tightened around his cock. Making him spill his hot seed into the Prince's abused hole. After a few seconds he slumped down on his throne once he felt he had emptied himself into the other's body. Tony nuzzled against him as they Both tried to regain themselves from their sexual high. "I'm s-sorry..." Tony mumbled through the King's wide chest. Curling in as large hands began to comb his hair.
What if he had left? He could of went back to his village if he didn’t like staying with Steve after all. There really was that possibility since there had been cases where the bonded omega human’s had tried to go back to their village. Those cases never ended well for them though, since they were already bonded to their Hydra alpha’s. The human’s would immediately get killed by the new protectors who would smell their hydra’s scent in them the minute they’d step near the village. And if they were somehow able to reach the village gates. They’d immediately burn to ashes as they had betrayed their words that they had uttered during their bonding ceremony. and this was all because they didn’t belong in the village with the other humans anymore.
Commander Rogers smiled at the omega whimpering next to him on the bed. He hadn’t expected the omega to look so willing and flushed when he had walked towards him. Throat suddenly going dry as he wanted nothing else than to lick up the omega’s delicious sun kissed skin.
“You sure know how to time this” Steve tried to make a joke as he rubbed Nat’s back awkwardly. The read head groaned in frustration. Too weak to even reply to him. But suddenly Mewling when Steve had pressed a sensitive spot on her back. In response To her reaction Steve leaned in and gave her a small nudge on her neck sending her a comforting scent While still rubbing the sweet spot On her back making Natasha shiver and moan. Steve could smell Nat getting more wet and was beginning to feel a bit more awkward as he didn’t think he could get it up for her just like last time. The first time Nat had been in heat when Steve was still knew And small in the apartment, which was After two months after they got to know each other. Clint had asked if Steve could ‘help’ her, Unfortunately he never could. Bruce had said it was probably due to his hormones and body being a bit off and a bit whacked as he was severely malnourished and sick. But over time he had realized that his body was actually reacting to Tony’s scent. Even when he was still tiny, every Time he caught a sniff of Tony feeling a bit aroused he’d go stiff and get hard right away. Unfortunately the brunette always took that time to go to the bathroom to take a shower or do business, whatever that was. And every time the man emerged he was smelling fresh and soapy with no trace of the earlier scent in his body making the blond frown in frustration.
A few moments later they were walking side by side silently, both glancing at opposite directions as they did. Wow, Steve’s hand was really big, and warm. It really felt nice the way he’d squeeze the smaller teen’s hands every now and then. Tony couldn’t help but feel really warm and cozy next to the big teen while walking out in the cold chilly air. Steve didn’t seemed to mind too when Tony had pressed a bit closer to him when a light breeze had passed them by.
“What about you? I mean.. his already with you and you two seem to really hit it off...” Bruce said as he tried to listen to Steve’s heart again. Tony shrugged, “i...i’m not sure if i’m a really good person to take care of him..i’m kind of a really bad person to be with...can’t even take care of myself really..” he admitted. Bruce only nodded before replying “well...i don’t know what you mean cause it seems to me you’ve already proven yourself that your good at this..with him..trust me, there are a lot of people who could of spotted him and not be as considerate as you..and you’d never know..maybe one day he’d be able to take care of you too”
He could see the irritation on the other’s face by now as he opened his mouth again.
Mornings were always like this for the two brothers. Filled with laughs and tight hugs, and most times steamy morning kisses. Ever since their parents tragic deaths four years ago, they were placed under the care of their uncle Fury who was always out of the country for reasons unknown. So the brothers really only had each other to take care of. With Tony being the youngest of the two by two years, he mostly depended on Steve who always took extra good care of him.
Ned, Harley and MJ all laughed by the pool while being served non alchocolic cocktails by a  waiter. He was about to go over there before strong arms suddenly grabbed him from behind.
Tony puffed as he played with the food on his plate. The wedding would be tomorrow and Killian had visited to drop off a Gift that Tony would need to wear for the wedding. The whole family gasping in delight when the Alpha had popped a fifty thousand diamond necklace romantically saying placing it on the omega’s neck saying “ just a little something new for tomorrow..” Tony stared in amazement at how thoughtful his new alpha could be. The whole Dining room boomed with cheers and laughter before instantly turning silent as a familiar figure stepped into the room. Tony frowned when he noticed everyone in the room freeze in their place. Eyes wide open as they continued to stare at whatever or whoever was behind Tony. The suspense was too much for the brunette before he turned around to also freeze in his spot.
The two were inseparable, from the moment they met in college. The two could always be seen next to each other. The gang had loss count on how many times people had mistook them for being soulmates, congratulating them at finding each other while still so young. Only for the two to show them that their wrist don’t actually zinc together as soulmates do. Strangers and friends would laugh at the realization and apologize. Which only made the two idiots snicker with glee.
So a lot of you really hated Steve and wanted Tony out in the first chap, but just please remember that Tony is actually very okay. He is very understanding and secure of himself and of his and Steve’s relationship. He know’s his worth and will be quick to leave Steve if he ever finds out that Steve’s cheating on him.
If it wasn’t for Steve’s mom knocking on the door asking the two if Tony was staying for dinner. Steve didn’t know how far Tony would of let him. The two had instantly jumped from each other as far as they could once his mom had opened the door. Eyes looking a bit suspecious as she plastered a grin. “We’re having mashed potato’s and fried chicken…” She trailed. “Um…would you like to stay for dinner?” Steve asked with a very flushed face as he tried to even out his hair. Tony was red as a tomato as he tried to straighten his shirt, nodding a “sure!” Before adding “i-i could help with te potatos…” he offered with a smile. Mrs. Rogers beamed at that offer. “Why that honestly sweet of you! Come on down the kitchen and we can get started!”
Wow did he have a head ache, where was Jarvis when he needed him. With a whimper he tried to glance around as he wondered where he was. He tried to remember what had happened before waking up to this room, hand tied and gaged.
——————————————————-
After everyone had eaten their fill and the group had started to just relax and lay by the shore Steve and Tony had decided to go swim further down the lake. Tony stopping immediately when Steve had started coughing. The two hot out of the water right away as Steve tried to control his coughing. Damn it his inhaler was inside his bag which was back where the group were. Tony cursed that they had swam a bit too far from where they had camped. Steve hadn’t coughed this hard since the start of the school year. The cold water must have triggered it. The omega was looking red as ever as Tony tried desperately to rub his hand on his back. Eventually the coughing had stopped and Tony was left wrapping his slender arms around Steve. Kissing the tiny shivering omega as Steve tried reassuring him that he was okay. A bit embarrassed of what had just happened as he tried to unwrap the alpha’s hands off him. he really didn’t like it when Tony was worried. As usual the Alpha was being stubborn as he gripped the omega tighter, giving as much warmth as he possibly could. It was sweet really..but Steve really needed to reassure him that he was okay. But before he could open his mouth to tell the alpha that Tony had leaned in and crashed their mouths together. Steve immediately being shock as he felt the trembling alpha’s shay tongue slide inside his mouth. Blue eyes snapping wide before closing back again when he realized that Tony was taking the initiative for the first time.
The thought had instantly vanished from his head though when he had noticed that the tiny incubus actually looked like a fucked out demon who had just been molested mercilessly. The blond couldn’t help his arousal as Tony looked at him tiredly. Crap, he really should feed Tony later. Looks like the bonding spell was too much for him. With a croaked out voice Steve asked Fury if everything was okay. Thankfully the man answered yes as he handed Steve the demons paper. Like expected his name sudden appeared and Steve beamed that Tony was really his. With a genuine thank you, the three went back to the front as Steve began paying for everything. A wide smile plastered on his face as he glanced down at his newly owned demon.
Pepper had been Tony’s friend for more than four years and the two had always been joined in the hip, she had always been there for him in his times of need. especially when his father would finish scolding him of what a disappointment he was to him. How he was the reason why his mother had died trying to save him from that run away horse he had let loose. Telling him that his mother was an angel and she had to give up her life to save his pathetic one. Tony would then break as guilt and sorrow would envelope him at the harsh cruel words his own father always threw at him. Nights like those always made being alone so horrible, and he would always send for pepper to come and sleep with him. At those late nights Pepper would sneak into his chambers bringing wine and pastries, singing to him or telling him that his old man was nothing but a ‘stupid goat’ who needed to get smacked, Tony would eventually feel a bit better after her rants. Loving how she would wrap him into her arms as he’d finally feel safe and fall asleep knowing she was there with him.
Once Steve had gotten Tony inside his apartment. the little demon cautiously began scenting around the place. Tail adorably twirling around as he ran from room to room. Familiarizing the smells and giving off his own in the process. Steve chuckled at the cute way his tiny demon was exploring around his new home. Heart beating loudly as he couldn’t believe he had gotten himself a demon. It wasn’t that he never wanted to, it was just that he never really thought about it. Owning a demon was pretty tough responsibility. Especially sex demons like Tony, they weren’t like all the other demons who could hold themselves in any given situation and protect their human’s when needed. No...sex demon’s were the exact opposites. They tended to be very reliant on other demons or humans for protection as their physical traits and powers weren’t as strong as the others. Their main purpose was only to feed off of other creatures, and making those creatures stronger in return. A good deal for someone who needs protection.
“Tea’s ready..” Steve smiled as he gave Sharon her’s and placed Clint’s on the coffee table. “Thank you Steve, I’m really sorry you couldn’t greet Tony at the airport...i should of called first before i went up here..” he trailed as he took a sip of her tea before continuing “it’s just that we were having a little stroll around the city and then i thought I’d stop by and-“ “it’s okay...Tony said he’ll be here in a few minutes..” Steve smiled as he glanced at Sam who was frowning irritably. Clint reentered the room with a new frozen pack for him when the doorbell rang. Steve’s ears immediately sprang up as he leaped off the cough “that’s him! That’s Tony!” Steve beamed as he ran and got to the door, opening it right away with a big smile as the charming brunette’s face appeared. “Hey stud...missed me?” Tony smiled with a wink at him. And All Steve could do was smile goofily as he immediately wrapped his arms around the brunette and pressed against him. Tony almost falling over at his hybrids weight. “Okay...okay buddy...i missed you too..”Tony chuckled as he wrapped an arm around the blond’s waist before looking around and frowning a bit “what happened here?” He asked as he glanced at the trashed apartment.
Unable to control himself Tony leaped onto the unexpected blond. Making Steve go wide eye a bit as Tony clung to him. “Oh my god! Thank you, thank you! I can’t believe you’d help me out!” Tony smiled happily as he felt like he was floating sky high. Once the taller teen had recovered from his initial shock of the smaller teen’s sudden action. He immediately straighten himself as he tried to pry slender arms away from him. “It’s nothing really...i just wanna help a friend out..this is mostly for Bucky..”
“TONY! BREAKFAST IS READY!”
He could only shake his head as tears trailed down his face. If he were to bend down for the King he would lose his title as Stark Prince. Even though Hydra had burned his Kingdom to ashes, he was still a Stark..he didn't know if any of his people had Survived the battle. But he didn't think they would want to know that the only remaining heir of the Stark legacy had bowed down so easily after the attack. Not after Howard had done his very best to not surrender, eventually killing himself when he heard the Hydra King's General was finally Marching deeper inside the castle, followed with a few of his Hydra men killing the King's last few soldiers.
“Come on Loverboy..you’ll get him back..” Natasha smirked as she playfully bit his ear. Well..at least he has Nat..
It was absolutely horrifying to suddenly see Pepper so thin and pale in front of him earlier. And It had been more horrifying how Steve had snapped and threaten to kill his already weak friend. Pepper and him had gone way back before he had even met Steve. And with the horror of seeing pepper die in Steves own hands, he just couldn’t bare to hold his ground anymore. He had tried desperately for weeks to not bow down for Steve. Done his very best to hold the Stark pride..his father’s pride. He’d actually managed not to break no matter how many times Steve had played with him, humiliated him ( by fucking him senselessly in front of his men) and even denied him of his own release..but seeing pepper get crashed with Steves enormous big hands was enough to break him completely. He’d shed everything behind if it meant keeping his friend alive.
“No, not yet…”
“OH MY GOSH THOR WHAT HAPPENED?!”
Peter felt a pang of guilt at seeing Wade start to leave. Immediately running  to grab his arm. Making his boyfriend look at him with a small reasuring smile.
“I’ll be right back...”
Before Tony could snap out of his hysteria at seeing his omega so different, Steve had suddenly enveloped him in an embrace while kissing him on the cheeks like he always did making Tony completely melt and relax into the embrace. his brain finally relaxing when his nose was met with the omega’s familiar scent. Steve, Steve, Steve...
———————————————————
Sorry for the long wait my eyes got a lil damaged from staring at the screen too long...
Once the two had finally settled on a perfect spot underneath some trees to shade them from the hot sun. Steve immediately opened his small notebook that Tony had seen from the day before. Scribbling something down again before putting it back inside his pocket. Once that was done the two stare at each other in utter silence once again, the same as yesterday when they had sat silently across each other from the diner. Tony was the first to clear his throat as he began to take some food out of the basket Steve had brought, smiling as he smelled the delicious burgers. “Thanks again for the treat..um...next one’s on me..” he offered as he gave Steve his burger. The blond simply smiled at that and WOW, he really did have a really nice smile. Tony didn’t think he could ever get over how handsome Steve was, especially when he was just a few inches from him.
Crap, crap, crap...his notepad wasn’t here. He most of left it somewhere. Tony jumped out of his messy bed filled with his bag and books, panic filling him up as he paced around his room trying to remember where he had last held it. “Oh my god! The bleachers! With....” Tony paled as he realized that he had left the notepad on the bleachers where Steve and Bucky and a few girls were at. Holy shit! No! No! No! What if Bucky saw it? The senior would never look or go near Tony again! Tony practically sprinted out his room as his heart beated like a drum inside his chest. Maybe they didn’t notice it, maybe it was still right there where he had forgotten it. Yeah, it was a small notepad anyway they might not have of seen it. His mind was running a mile a second as he reached the empty school grounds. Dashing quickly he rushed to the school’s football field, frantically searching for the notepad. The sun was setting when he finally felt all hope lost as he came to admit that the notepad containing all his secret desires was gone.  With a heavy sigh he fell on his knees as he trembled at the thought of being rejected and humiliated. Why did he have to be so absentminded.
The two panted as they both stared into each other’s eyes. This was their first sex being a married couple, and it had felt very wonderful on both sides. Tony smiling tiredly as he couldn’t believe that Steve and him were married now...as if it had all just sank into him that this was really real..all the ceremony, with the jewelries and robes and people earlier never meant anything to him. Everything earlier seemed like a task he needed to do in order to save his precious friend from death. But now..knowing perfectly well that this was their wedding night and seeing Steve like this.. being with Steve like this..hearing Steve say those reassuring words to him..it had made everything from earlier finally feel like it did mean something. He had always wanted this. He had always wanted Steve, he had just been scared then of the blond when he had shown his darker side. But no matter how much he tried to fight it he knew deep inside he would always love Steve. No matter how mad the king could get. Tony would always love him.
With steady steps he quickly opened the cottage door to find that his home was empty. quickly sniffing the air As he tried looking around the house in search of his missing omega. When he had finally reached their room to find it also empty panic rose inside him as the omega usually didn’t step outside the cottage that much as he’d be too busy tinkering inside or preparing food at this time of day.
Well so much for the plan Steve had...
Tonight was no different.
“Hey Pep?..”
Dont hate me please
Boy was this going to be a long night when Steve and Peter got back. Oh well..at least he’d have a nice warm dinner ready for them when they did, and Luckily he had made Steve’s favorite. Chowder always brought the Alpha back into a happier mood.
Steve made sure his seed would plant well inside his beautiful Lord. He’d impregnate him and make him bare their children. Amazingly his omega didn’t seem to mind as well as he tangled his legs around the the alpha’s hips. Loving the filling of being full.
The damn bastard who Steve was with, down stairs half an hour ago was only lucky he lived to bound with Tony. Steve had only allowed it since his lord needed someone with greater wealth to help him with his manor. After all Steve was only thinking about his Lord’s future.
Steve had his arm wrapped around his little brother’s shoulder when they had arrived at school, only sliding off it when Sam and Peggy had seen them and waved at him. Tony immediately frowned as he saw the blond eagerly going over to his two friends, instantly wrapping both his arms around Peggy’s waist who then gave him a peck on the cheek. The blond completely ignoring him again as he seemed much too busy again. Tony was about to turn around and head on and find his friends when an arm had suddenly snatched him, making him stumbled towards Bucky who raffled his hair a bit, telling him to have a good day before letting him go. Tony had pouted as he tried to fix his hair that had become a mess, before smiling as he watched Bucky wave and give him a charming grin as he joined Steve and the other’s, missing the way Steve had glanced back at the two of them with a frown.
“Well…yeah i do but um…my cat might be looking for me…he gets real upset when i come home late.”
Oh thank God Tony hadn’t thought anything of it. He couldn’t resist the erge to swallow though when the smaller teen had finally laid on top of him. Glasses off as he stared at Steve. Brown eyes big and beautiful. “Tony…” Steve breathed as he unconciously wrapped his arms around the small messy haired brunette. It all felt so right as he held him there. Warm and cozy inside his room. His breath hitched when he felt Tony’s fingers start to trace scribbles on his neck. Before he knew it. He had suddenly pinned the shorter teen against his bed. Kissing him so passionately that he couldn’t even stop what he was doing. The amazing thing was that Tony was kissing him back. Tongue dancing along with his as he bit and sucked at the soft lips. He could feel himself harden as he grinded against the other who was already moaning at his touch. Soft fingers curling on his sides as he slid his own hard finders beneath the other’s shirt. Loving the feeling when he had found one of Tony’s nipples and suddenly pinching it. Earning him a whimper from the brunette.
It was the bonding spell. All throughout his body he was feeling the magic of the bond start to flow inside him. Every vain burning like he was lit on fire. Trembling a bit, he glanced to check the small demon have a pained look on his face. Steve hoped Tony was alright since it was always worst for the demons, since they were the ones who were taking more of the spell’s hit. The blond could watch as the other trembled near him. skin burning with a yellow glow as he was becoming Steve’s personal demon, invisible strings connecting his body to Steve’s. Once this bonding was done, Tony would forever be his as the his name will appear in the demon’s paper. Which Fury will give them once everything is done.
Blond’s warm breath on his skin. “What is it Sweety?” Tony asked as he maneuvered himself beneath the heavy hybrid. Steve just purred before rubbing his face against Tony’s cheeks.
Loving the reaction he was getting from the smaller man Steve nibbled more on his earlobe before tracing his tongue over the other’s face
Thor nodded in agreement "As i am protective of you...we all tend to be with the people we love" he said with tender blue eye's. "He ripped an arm off of one of his men for placing it on the Stark Prince's back..." Loki reminded him with a look. "Well...yes...he might be a bit more harsh than most of us..." Thor trailed, " but he means well...and we will do our best to pay our respects to him and his future Queen.." he finished with a smile. Loki stared at him for a bit before leaning close with a small sigh.
Im making your request now
The brunette was pleasantly surprised to taste mint, Steve had brushed his teeth. Good..he didn’t think he could swallow down tasting liquor and someone else when Steve was giving him his morning kiss. The two of them stayed that way for a few seconds before Steve broke it and stared at him with a small smile that always seemed to take Tony’s breath away. “You up yet?” He asked with a funny tone making Tony roll his eyes at him. “I am now...” he replied with a dead tone before shifting and getting up from the bed. “Someone’s grumpy..”Steve teaser as he got up as well.
“Wow! Look at the time! My shirt isnt gonna dry it’s self ya know..we better get upstairs now!” Steve hurriedly said as he tried to hide his redden face from the brunette. Pulling Tony along side him as fast as he could before his mom could embarass him anymore. He had slammed the door shut once they were finally in his room. Face all flushed as he awkwardly apologized to Tony about his ma. The smaller teen just laughed as he reassured Steve that his mom was great. And the brownies were outstanding.

“Hey...Steve home?” The handsome taller brunette asked as he smiled at Tony, raising his right hand to show a box of vanilla ice cream. Tony grinned at that, he really could use some ice cream right now, especially vanilla. He really hoped Bucky would give him some even if Steve wasn’t home. The older teen was always generous to him though. “No...just went out actually...wont be back till late..” he rolled his eyes before giving the senior another grin as he stared at the ice cream. Making Bucky laugh as he placed his hand on Tony’s head to ruffle his hair. “ well...be a damn shame to let this go to waste...wanna watch some movies and eat this with me instead?” The words were enough to warm the younger brunette’s heart as he took the other’s arm and lead him into the house.
Back to the present Tony was chuckling as Bucky sent him another GIF of a dog running around covered in marshmallows. For a week now he had been steering towards the other teen as he didn’t really want to keep thinking about Steve which was absolutely hard since they lived together. He really hated how he still craved the blond’s attention and wanted Steve all to himself. He decided it really wasn’t really healthy what he was feeling towards Steve ever since he had realized how he really felt for his brother when he had seen him kissing someone else.

———————————————————
Tears pouring down his cheeks as he tried to steady his breathing. Steve was kissing her, kissing Peggy..it shouldn’t hurt like this but it did. Steve was out all night with her and had kissed her. It hurt so much that Tony had to curl in on himself to stop himself from shaking. A few seconds later he hears the door downstairs close, a minute later the engine of Bucky’s parked car outside started running and he could hear them drove off. Leaving the house finally silent and empty for some reason. In all his years after his parents had died Tony had never felt this hurt and lonely before. When his mom and dad had died Steve was there for him. Now that Steve was going to be with someone else no one was left to be there for Tony anymore. With tears still trailing down his face he curled onto a little ball as he tried to disappear.
Holy Crap..it was Steve Rogers, the star quarterback of the football team, Bucky’s seriously scary best friend that kept giving Tony those weird looks, kinda like what he was giving him right now. Tony resisted the urge to squirm in front of the blond’s intense gaze while he tried desperately to maneuver himself away from the massive teen that was towering over him. “Steve...your scaring him...” the voice from earlier called out making the blond and Tony snap their attention away from each other. Oh gosh it’s Bucky! Tony internally squealed as he turned bright red. Heart thumping fast as the sweaty senior came up to them with the most charming smile. “You okay there doll?” Bucky had asked him with a wink as he got closer. Tony could only nod as his words had seemed to get tangled inside his mouth. “Sorry bout that Steve here can be a real monster with the ball..” the blond teen had frowned at that and had said something but Tony was too busy staring at Bucky to actually hear what the other teen had to say. Even though the taller brunette wasn’t actually looking at him anymore as it seemed Bucky was waving at some of their teammates that were still on the field.
The long haired brunette alpha suddenly stood up and stormed off with his tray. Muttering that it wasn’t his fault Tony looked so cute for an Alpha. “I think you should apologize to him...” Tony pouted as he tried taking a bite of the burger Steve was feeding him. “What?!..your even taking his side?” The blond frowned as he took the burger away from Tony, making the tired alpha whine. “Well..he is your beat friend and i don’t think it’s good that you two are fighting, i hate it when me and Rhodeybear fight..so i know you do too...plus he really was just trying to help me get undress, i keep telling you that” Tony answered as he tried to reach for the burger. “Tony..” the omega sigh. “Steve...” Tony countered.
With a huff Tony wrestled around as he tried to get free. The skin on his wrist burning a bit as he tried to rid of the rope that had ties his hands together.
Steve didn’t seem all that comfortable as Tony did since he had been very silent and was sweating a bit..well maybe that’s what he gets for wearing a jacket on a hot day. Tony decided to take the lead and started rambling about some projects he was doing at school making the blond gape at him with wide eyes. Half way through though Steve hd admitted he didn’t understand much of what the brunette was talking about which made Tony giggle before going silent as he didn’t know what else to talk about. Fortunately thanks to his rambling Steve had began looking more comfortable and even took his jacket and cap off. Tony suppressed a chuckle at Steve’s messy hair as he decided to lean closer and comb the blond’s hair with his fingers, ignoring the way Steve had stared at him with his blue gaze.
More whispers could be heard. Before one blond haired alpha shouted “he stood you up!” The look on everyone’s face at that as Killian turned red with embarrassment and anger at the thought that Tony had left him. “No! Maybe he’s just hiding or or...just fucking search for him!” Killian shouted as the rest started to scramble.
This was probably going to be a very slow process but Tony couldn’t help but think how delighted he would be during it.
But it really wasn’t a feeling of lost or rejection on their part, but rather a feeling of jealousy and longing. To watch the person you’ve been seeing. That was as empty as you were be finally fulfilled and content with their lives. Leaving you all alone and still waiting for your special match.
Wait, what? Tony slapped himself mentally as he must of misread that. Steve would never look at him like that. He must of been seeing things from his over worked eyes.
“Oh my gosh Steve...mmm..please get Clint...” Natasha practically moaned as she took off her buttoned shirt baring her soft breast and pink nipples. She was already sweating as she throw the garment across the room. Natasha was absolutely beautiful with nothing else on but her soaked red panty, a bit if slick running down. She looked absolutely stunning with her toned body showing off her curves in all the right places and giving off the sweet smell of spices and orchids. Tail curling around her slender leg. Steve gulped in amazement but still felt nothing below, rather simply appreciating the female hybrids body.
Steve instantly redden when he had realized that he was staring for too long as the older demon started to snarl at him. “Nat...these Demons are incubus Demons!” Steve gasped as he turned to look at his friend with his mouth wide open. The redhead smirked at that as she merely tilted her head to the side. Clearly loving his expression. “you were saying?”
“ a trip to L.A??” Tony asked with a worried face. “It will only be for two days ...” Pepper promised as she begged him to say yes. “But what about Steve? I cant leave him alone...you know his never been on his own in the apartment..” Tony said as he folded his arms across his chest. “Then get someone to sit him...Clint’s just a couple of feet away..and is good with Hybrids..I’m sure he wont mind Natasha having company” Pepper pleaded as she tilted her head and gave him a puppy dog face. Tony rolled his eyes as he gave up. “Fine..I’ll ask Clint later if he’ll sit for him...seriously pep...your good at your job, even almost as better as me...almost..” Tony mused as Pepper playfully punch him before giving him a big hug as a thank you.
Deep blue orbs meet with startled light blue ones.
He just needed a way to persuade the stubborn Prince why.
Steve, was finally in that position right now as he watched with a nervous heart at the beautiful human he had chosen to claim, sit in front of him with two of the village elders behind him. Steve’s  six tentacles twirled nervously as he tried to hunch down as to not seem so intimidating to the small human. Tony, was his name. The hydra creature had taken a liking to him three years ago when he had seen Tony visiting and mending an owls broken wing near the dark forest. Not caring of the dangers lurking near him, as long as he was able to see and care for the injured bird that Steve would sometimes tend to as well. At times Steve would hear the small human mutter a thank you, even if Steve was sure the human didn’t see him. It was a condition that the protectors were not to show themselves to the villagers whenever they went out to scavenge or hunt. That they would remain hidden in the shadows until their duration was done and needed to take their prize. So it wasn’t a surprise when Steve would hear the small human say a thank you, like he knew Steve was there. It made the hydra’s heart flutter inside his chest. No one had ever thanked him like Tony did. Sometimes he’d find the human even going out of the village late at night to check on the bird. Which pissed Steve off at times since anything could happen if he hadn’t noticed the brunette wander off. And yet he’d had this warm feeling whenever he’d watch the small human curl up and talk with the owl. As if he knew he was safe, like he knew Steve was there near him. Even if he didn’t see him. Steve knew that Tony had faith in him. And wasn’t scared of him at all..

He was the worst, Steve groaned as he finally sat down on the empty classroom where he had texted Tony to meet him.  He couldn’t believe what he was doing, acting as if he was actually willing to help the younger teen win over his best friend that was currently courting someone else, he was bad...awful! horrible! He should kill himself.
He had been so nervous when Tony had stepped outside the village gate. Wearing the traditional robe that an omega wore when finally being presented to them, the large alpha couldn’t help but notice the way the long silky robe clung to the omega’s slender form. A light blush appeared on his face before he smiled as he noticed as well  how the robe’s golden petals surrounding the vibrant red silk complemented the omega’s fair skin. Making Tony look even more radiant and youthful in Steve’s eyes. And when the omega human finally looked up with his hazel brown eyes beneath his lushes thick lashes. Steve could barely breath as he held his breath at how beautiful Tony was smiling up at him. A shiver ran down his spine as he felt his cheeks turn redder at the Omega in front of him. The human villagers had even clipped on small golden ornaments on the omega’s curly locks. And placed small jewels around his neck and wrist. A small part of his chest peaking out as the robe fell off his slender shoulder’s a bit. Exposing soft skin and a rosy pink nipple, the omega’s face  redden at that and quickly apologized as he tried to hold the robe in place. Steve bit his lips as he watched the tiny human smile embarrassingly at him. Gosh was he cute! Steve hoped he didn’t think what he was doing was really a sacrifice. Because that was the last thing Steve wanted his chosen human to think with their bond.
Hope everyone liked
With a sheepish grin Tony leaned up to give his big adorable hybrid a small kiss on the cheek. Startling the blond, giving him a quick escape as Steve’s arm’s had gotten lose. By the time Steve had snapped out of his haze Tony had already started walking a meter away. Winking at the blushing blond as he told him to be good and play nicely with Thor. Steve frowned at that but waved goodbye to the other as Tony waved back at him before closing the door. With a sight Steve turned to go inside the living room where the rest of the hybrids were settled.
Meanwhile…
Steve really was a good person if he was willing to do all this just so that Tony could be a proper boyfriend material for Bucky, which also made Tony think of how a loyal friend Steve is if his willing go through all this with Tony just so his best friend wouldn’t be sad anymore. Maybe this was why Steve was so popular, well..aside from his incredibly gorgeous face, amazing physic and tone abs. Tony had a daze look on his face as he stared unconsciously at the living work of art next to him.
Steve couldn’t help but smile as the short alpha from across the table made funny faces at him. It was still very early in the morning as the two exchanged morning jokes and friendly insults. A rush of blood would go up Steve’s cheeks as he’d watch the sun’s rays start to enter the stark tower kitchen. Tony always looked good in the mornings. Hair messy as ever from staying up late in the lab. Large brown eyes gazing lazily at the blond as he sips his coffee.  Yes, it was a beautiful mission free day. That is, until.
Fuck, fuck, fuck..
———————————————————-
Tony swallowed a mouthful of beer as he tried to ignore the ache he was feeling somewhere in his chest. God he really shouldn’t be thinking this. It was Friday night for God’s sake! So he drank more of the beer that was on the table and laugh some more at his friends stupid jokes. But by the time he had started to wonder where Steve was again, the Blond had suddenly appeared.
Steve frowned at what his friends said as he sat quietly at the far side of the table. It was true..Thor was worth a lot of money compared to him..heck he didn’t think was worth anything. He had grown up alone in the streets when his mother’s owner had left him in a box in an alleyway. Thinking he was the runt of the litter because he was so small and weak. His mother’s owner didn’t have much food to go around for them and had eventually decided that he didn’t really need to feed one more mouth when it looked like Steve wasn’t going to make it. He had told Steve’s mother that he would give The small kit a home, but he never did. Instead he had placed Steve inside a big box and left him there. Left him to fend for himself and survive on his own until he had met Tony.
and there in front of them Stood his brother Steve, blue eyes wild as his jaw clinched, body stiff and aura dark as he stared at them with intense rage.
He said he wouldn’t leave...that he’d take care of him...what a lier, Tony thought bitterly as he took out his phone from beside him again. He should of known, he did know..but Steve always made him forget how much he hated him. How much he shouldn’t love him, how much he had hurt him. It was like a stupid joke that the one person he loved the most in this world was the one person who he shouldn’t. And it hurt so much. God he needed help. This really wasn’t good..Before he could think on what to do, a message had popped up inside his phone from Bucky. Tony stared at it for a few moments till a small smile had form on his face.
And with Steve by Tony’s side. It just seemed so much easier waiting for that person. But what if their friends were right? He knew they were only teasing but..What if their soulmates finally came? Would they really be okay with how close the two were? I mean, they were basically living together, ate together. Even Went to bed together. Which, Tony mostly blamed on himself since he was always the one being clingy. A trait most of his small circle tease him about.
“My king...” Tony smiled, “my Queen..” Steve breath as he leaned over to give his lovely wife a quick kiss. Tony relished in the soft kiss before  finally gasping and worrying at the deep wounds that covered the kings body. All while dangerously Blue eyes kept glancing at the man standing behind his wife.
Tony’s head hurt a bit as he started to wake up, muffling a bit as he tried to speak but couldn’t when he realized that his mouth was stuff with a cloth that was wrapped around his head. His arms ached a bit as he tried to stretch them behind him. It seems as though they were wrapped securely behind him with a thick rope. Hazel brown eyes blinked a few times before scanning the bright room that seemed to have no windows and looked utterly dull for his taste, as his omega instincts instantly told him to paint the place and decorate it.
