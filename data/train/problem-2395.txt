Dean nodded, slightly exasperated at the obviousness of the statement. He turned the handgun over with sure fingers. Checked the cartridge. Only two bullets.
It wasn’t just the hunting, the bisexuality, the dead mom or the deadbeat dad. He'd always felt like there was something wrong in the core of him. He’d learned how to deflect or joke or fight or fuck his way out of any situation. He had a damn band aid for every emotional scar waiting to happen. But somehow, all the lies just didn’t fit right with Castiel. Dean looked into his eyes and felt quietly seen. He had this feeling, deep in his heart or his gut or whatever the hell was causing this tornado inside him, that Cas could be trusted. That he wasn’t interested in what Dean had to give, what kind of show he could put on.
Charlie grinned as she planted a kiss at the hollow of Stevie’s throat and groaned dramatically when that god-awful text tone went off. The sound would just keep playing until she opened the text. Which was great if it was your gorgeous girlfriend telling you she was waiting for you at home, but not so great when it was literally anyone else.
Dean held out a hand and Cas took it. He felt the bond between them crackle with energy. That profound bond, always there, but never quite so alive as this.
He looked across the street. Fixed that mask of pointed indifference back over his expression. “Would you look at that, Cas,” he smirked, pointing at the tailors across the way. “Just our luck.”
He turned on the bathroom lighting and the last remaining lamp by Cas’ head, before switching off the chandelier. Grateful as ever for his false credit card details, Dean pulled a dresser to the middle of the room. It shook as he climbed atop, and he ignored the faint sound of Sam’s voice through the phone, now abandoned by the bed.
Cas closed the distance between them, his mouth so soft against Dean's. And he kissed him and kissed him and kissed him. If Dean hadn’t believed the angel before, he would have been hard pressed to deny it when Cas pinned him to the wall.
Dean buried his face in the crook of Cas’ neck, the warmth of his skin thawing the ice of Dean’s nightmares. The rumble of Cas’ voice and steady beat of his heart the most beautiful reminder that he was really here. He was back. He was Dean’s and Dean was his and he could finally,
“You don’t understand,” Cas’ voice was so gentle Dean could hardly stand it. “I’ve wanted this. I… always do,” in the pause between Cas’ words, Dean’s lungs emptied. He forgot how to breathe. “I’ve never – I would never initiate, but…” Cas brought a hand to his own lips and Dean watched with terror and longing in his wide eyes. “You begged me to forget. Every time we… got close, I could hear your prayer. I could feel your regret. Your fear. You wished it never happened.”
Feeling defenceless and uncomfortably exposed, Dean glanced at the doorway. With shaking hands, he bundled the coat up, holding it against his chest and burying his nose in the collar. Charlie’s words from the night before ringing in his ears.
“Am not,” Dean scoffed, folding his arms and leaning his back fully against the gravestone. He flinched immediately, cursing under his breath.
Cas grinned, pushing Dean over and laying his full weight on top of him. Cas looked down on him, speaking directly to Dean's parted lips, his voice gravelly and unwavering. "I want to fuck you, Dean. Now."
Cas kissed along Dean’s throat, his chest, his stomach. Dean panted, arms still obediently resting above his head even without Cas to hold them there. He was dying to grab a hold of Cas’ hair, to tug on the short strands.
Cas left then, guilt weighing his wings at the human lives lost. It was a small relief no others were harmed when they’d escaped.
Dean couldn’t let that happen. Couldn’t let anything happen to Sam. Or Castiel either, for that matter. He thought of those panicked blue eyes; the way Cas had been so reluctant to leave Dean behind.
They were interrupted by the sight of their waiter and this hot chick who’d been sat at the bar openly making out in front of everyone.
“Anyway,” Charlie said, taking slow backward steps toward the door. “We all miss you. Sam and Eileen are out for the night, but you know where to find us if you feel up for it?”
Dean clung to the makeshift stake for dear life but the spell was too strong. It flew out toward Ruby and the chair, Dean still clinging desperately to it. Ruby whipped her head around, and it took every muscle in Dean’s body to move the stake just a few inches.
His stomach lurched, but the callused hand at his cheek soothed the sickness right on time. Dean’s heart slowed and then raced for a whole other reason as he looked up at the angel.
Charlie shook her head in mock disappointment. “I thought we were past this, man? Besties, remember?” she teased, tugging Cas into a bear hug. “Still not talking, huh?” she mumbled to his back. Cas stiffened in her arms and Charlie released him.
Whatever kind of monster Dean thought of himself as, he didn’t want to think about what he’d be without a soul. A conscience. He remembered exactly the kind of asshole Sam had been without one. And that was
Standing in front of the old brown brick building of the high school, Dean leaned against a pickup truck and checked his watch. Only another half hour until school was out for Halloween break. He took in the carved pumpkins that lined the front door of the school, the orange and black bunting that read “Happy Halloween 1993” above the door. Painted Styrofoam gravestones were scattered around the grass out front, and a large sign that read “Beware the Sanderson Sisters!” hung from a noose on a nearby tree. Dean blinked in surprise. This town really had a thing for Halloween, huh?
Cas rolled his eyes. "There were other pizza men. Some mail men. One very unprofessional doctor," Cas said, a concerned look crossing his face. He was so damn sweet. "Truly unsanitary."
One more book for Bobby’s collection can’t hurt, Dean rationalised. He grabbed the book and folded the corner of the fragile page to keep his place. The fire was spreading quickly now, and Dean made his way to the door, careful not to breathe in smoke.
“I’ve gotta tip that pizza man,” Dean managed, with the dopiest smile on his face. He brushed a hand along Cas’ cheek, because he could. His eyes roamed over Cas’ face, because he could. He brushed Cas’ slightly swollen lip with the pad of his thumb and kissed him lightly in the same spot afterward. Because he could. Because he wanted this so badly it almost didn’t seem real. This was Cas - this was his best friend. He could have this. They both could.
Dean ducked as Meg swiped out with her long nails. He kicked, landing a blow to her belly. The witch staggered back several steps, and Dean realised too late that it was more by choice than his doing. He fell to his knees, Rowena’s spell crashing through his body like bolts of electricity burning through his veins. His heart pounded so hard he thought it would burst right through his ribs.
Dean snorted. “A’right, law boy, I think we both know that book ain’t a good idea in no one’s hands but Bobby’s.”
Dean nodded. “Good. ‘Cause I don’t.” He stepped forward and pulled Cas toward him by the tie. Dean leaned close, his lips barely an inch from kissing Cas. But he stopped. He needed to be sure that this was real. That Cas wasn't humouring him. That Cas really wanted this even half as much as Dean did.
Castiel’s attention caught on the movement of Dean’s t-shirt; how it stretched tight across his chest and rippled slightly against his stomach in the breeze. Dean waved again as he came closer, the t-shirt riding up to reveal a sliver of bare skin at his hips. Castiel wet his lips, forcing himself to divert his attention elsewhere.
He had to say something. He had to. But the more he thought about it, the further his words seemed to sink inside him and the longer he was quiet the bigger fucking deal it was for him to speak up and-
“So… this Phoenix place,” he started without a clue how to finish the sentence. At least he’d said it out loud.
A bar had been set up in the foyer. The crowd was sparse inside; people chatting with glasses of expensive alcohols in their hands, dressed in all manners of finery and enough perfume that Cas found himself scratching at his nose. The building was rustic; old white-washed walls decorated with replenished wooden shelves and frames.
Dean snorted, then frowned at an intrusive thought. "Seriously, where the hell did you learn all this, 'cause you are
Dean caught the sleeve of the trench coat, quickly pulling the thing onto his lap. His eyes darting around the library in a quick sweep, confirming he was alone.
Dean’s mouth was suddenly dry. His gaze dropped to the open whiskey bottle at Charlie’s side, but he had a feeling she wouldn’t hand it over even if he asked.
Dean took a deep breath, collapsing back against the wall. He needed the support - felt like his legs were about to give out on him. He'd never felt so many things in the space of so few minutes. “You’re shitting me.”
Bobby started in on his own beer, wisely choosing not to comment. “Sam tell you he’s got a girlfriend?”
Dean crept to the bathroom, the soft squish of his slippers on the cold tile the only sound through the hall. When he finished up, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. Hair all fucked up, his cheeks pink and… was that a damn
Within minutes, the demon cracked. When Cas was sure he’d told them everything, he allowed Dean the honour of the kill.
Cas straightened, but did not remove his foot. The demon struggled uselessly beneath him, while Dean retrieved his blade.
Perhaps it was not love, then. But as Dean moved to sit in Cas' lap, Cas was certain this could not be anything but. There were other ways he could make Dean understand how important he was. How deserving he is of love and protection.
Cas noticed the goosebumps that crept along Dean’s arms, raising the light dusting of freckles. Even in the moonlight they really were quite beautiful.
The history, as it turned out, was not so ancient as Cas imagined. Dean told him stories of his childhood; stories he’d never shared with Cas before. Or anyone else, the angel suspected. From beginning to end, Dean’s knees bounced anxiously under the table; one hand holding his beer like a lifeline, the other held safely between Cas’ own hands. Cas stroked the back of Dean’s palm in a soothing repetitive motion, listening intently and marvelling all the while that Dean allowed him to touch him like this.
He knew Sam wanted out of the family business. Knew he and their father would never see eye to eye. Hell, deep down he knew the kid had every right to go to school and live some normal apple-pie life. Deep, deep down maybe.
“Come on in, man, you look cold out there.” Come to think of it, Dean should really give the trench coat back. He shucked it off his shoulders, silently praying he didn’t get any blood on it – his own
Shame chilled the hopeful buzzing in Castiel’s chest. He wrapped his wings tightly around himself. His wings had been the only form of comfort, hidden as they were to human eyes. The weight of them was something of a companion. Now, they only served as a reminder of the lie between them.
“Lookin’ good,” Charlie finished, with more confidence than she felt. God, she was worried about the guy. She missed him. Dean was her best friend, and standing in front of him right now, she missed him more than ever. She swallowed that thought down. She could do this.
Before Cas could help it, he pressed two fingers to Dean’s forehead, deepening his sleep, curing the stiffness of his spine, and checking his temperature all at once. He was cold. Dean had been paler recently, too; now that he spent all his time indoors. Refusing even the shortest of drives in the Impala.
Jack might enjoy having a pet. Cas smiled fondly at the thought and made the formal decision to spend his evening learning everything there was to know about the creatures.
He ran his fingers carefully over Cas’ cheek, the skin pinkening slightly beneath his touch. Still Cas didn’t wake.
Cas smiled ruefully. “I would have preferred the damage to his hand had a more lasting effect, but it was clear to me then that it had not.” He shrugged, meeting Dean’s eye as he added earnestly, “I don’t regret what I did.”
When he’d finished at the sides, Dean wiped the foam from Cas’ cheeks and rested a hand on one while he worked around Cas’ chin. His lips.
“Just checking,” Dean smiled. Then hurried to the bathroom, hastily buttoning up his flannel before picking up the iron bar, and with it, the pendant.
the woman scolded. Dean bristled when she eyed him suspiciously over her shoulder after passing by, until she almost walked right into a telephone pole.
Cas’ grin faded to a soft, fond smile. There was a beat of silence that started with Dean not knowing what he wanted to do and ended with him wishing for exactly what he wanted next. Dean closed the distance between them, wrapping his arms around Cas, one hand on his back, the other on the back of his head.
“When did you get back?” Sam asked. He sounded worried, or perhaps surprised. Cas was too focused on Dean, on what he would say, to figure it out.
Cas turned slightly, glancing down at their hands resting above the white sheets. Dean’s smallest finger was hooked between Cas’ middle and index fingers. Dean was breathing deeply, his lips slightly parted and lids fluttering. He’d removed his blazer; his tie loose and his new shirt irreparably stained with his own blood. Trails of that dried blood marked the tale of Dean's movements all over the bed.
He stomped down that pathetic little wave of nostalgia. “Hey, uh, you got any plans for tonight? Halloween and all that.”
His attention sheepishly cut to the bathroom. Cas was still turning the razor over between his fingers, head cocked to the side.
Cas frowned. His mouth fell open and closed again. It was something he hadn’t considered. Hadn’t thought possible. Their bond was…
Dean blinked. Stunned into compliance. Cas knew Dean trusted him well enough to follow his lead and keep his mouth shut. They worked well together; the silent language of their hunts came naturally. Easy to slip into heightened awareness; to lose themselves to strategy and bloodshed. Not always for the greater good. But for Dean, at least, his heart was always in the right place.
Dean’s heart almost dropped through his ass as the angel fell to his back. Cas was… he was pale. Wide-eyed and scared shitless, hand weakly reaching out toward Dean.
Dean shook his head, his jaw working like he was trying real hard to say something – or not to say something.
Why was Cas asking her about Dean? Did something happen? Charlie chewed her lip, resting her head on Stevie’s shoulder as they waited for Sam’s response.
It was seconds or hours later when his eyes flew open, and Dean sat upright in his bed. His heart pounding and a breathless laugh already shaking out of him before his mind could form the words.
Cas felt the vibration of his cellular phone, the screen lighting up with a photo of Dean posing by the Impala. His reply was short; a simple thumbs-up emoticon. Cas rolled his eyes, deciding to wait by the bar until Dean arrived.
He shoved open the door to the tailors with a bit too much force. It banged against a fancily dressed mannequin and Dean hurriedly righted it before it hit the ground. Face stupid with embarrassment, ears burning, he froze as a pointed cough sounded close behind him.
Dean put his phone on speaker, ignoring Sam’s questions about what the fuck all that noise was about. Told him to shut up and keep his nose in the lore. Really, Dean needed the company. If this went wrong and that pendant zapped his soul – Dean and Cas would both be gone. There was no chance Sam would get here in time to burn the thing.
Crowley glared. “I confronted her you see. Rowena. The bitch didn’t take too kindly at that, so here I am. Doomed to live out the rest of my days, until the last trace of her unholy existence is gone from this world.”
He froze on the path, spying his nerdy little dude in the trench coat stand by a wall on the corner of the street, trying and failing to fix his tie. Okay, so he wasn’t
Dean huffed a small laugh. He crossed his arms protectively at his waist, and tilted his head back to look down at the angel between long lashes. “I ain’t the easiest guy to be around, buddy.” He said it as if it were a joke at his own expense but there was honesty there that Castiel couldn’t seem to comprehend.
He rubbed the condensation from the mirror and blinked at what he found staring back at him. His smile was gone; shadows stained beneath his eyes, and his freckles faded into his overheated skin. He touched the handprint on his shoulder; trailed his fingers along the mark the angel left to remind him he was saved. He was safe. It was something he never dared allow himself to do. Like it was too intimate – as if it was Cas’ own hand he was touching. Now, he followed along the middle finger of the handprint, pointing toward a small bruise. Another reminder. Dean’s heart sped in his chest.
The man introduced himself as Jordan, offering Cas a flute of champagne. Cas stumbled on his words. He’d worked a hundred cases with as many aliases. He needed a name, and the first that came to mind was Justin Timberland. He believed it was the name of a pop-singer he’d once heard of on the radio; a lover turned nemesis of one of Cas' favourite musicians, Britney Spears. Cas often listened to her songs when he was alone; far from the judging ears of Sam and Dean. The latter of whom Cas imagined might fall prey to a heart attack if he found out.
Cas stopped by the bathroom door. Eyes shut tight; hands balled into fists. He leaned his forehead against the white-painted door, silently begging for… he didn’t know what.
Cas wrapped his arms around his own knees. He tilted his head in his friend's direction, the weight in his chest lifted by Dean's absent tears. The blood and wounds gone from Dean’s hands.
They talked over their plans; Cas figured it was best to head for the museum sooner than later. With auctions like these, it was likely there'd already be crowds lined up at the door. Dean knew it wasn't going to be the heist he'd built up in his head. That this was little more than an excuse to dress up and have a little fun with his best friend - maybe gank a demon or two along the way. This case was cake. Even if the stakes were worrying, at best.
Dean was in a suit. A black jacket with a matching tie. He ran a hand through his hair and yelped as he caught sight of Cas in the mirror.
In a weak attempt to settle himself, Cas tried to call Jack. Jody had warned them there’d be little service in the mountains. Still, when there was nothing but dial-tone on the other end, Cas tried not to worry. Loneliness was settling on his bones, weighing on his wings.
“And even though it is a crime against the race of elves, men, and dwarves…” Charlie tilted her head in thought for a moment, her short auburn hair falling against her neck, “and hobbits, I guess… that you miss out on the start – you can join us for the movie anytime you feel up to it. It’s just me and Cas and three hours forty-eight minutes of Tolkien goodness.”
The demon’s death was swift. Cas burned the demon from the vessel, his eyes glowing as bright as the demon’s were dark and then empty. Cas didn’t wait for the demon to fall to the floor before his hand found Dean’s shoulder, healing his wound in a flash of light.
Dean kissed each bloody knuckle on Cas’ hand, his eyes shut. He trailed his fingertips over the back of Cas’ hand, reverently marking every groove, every vein. Finally, he pressed a kiss to Cas’ wrist, leaning his cheek into Cas’ open palm.
It was only when the music from Dean's playlist stopped on its second run through, when Cas lay with his head on Dean’s chest, a hand in his hair, that their comfortable silence was disturbed by a knock on the door.
“I can’t take back all those times you thought I’d regret feeling like this for you. But Cas, I want…”  Dean paused, “I
was often a euphemism for something else entirely. It wasn’t an unpleasant thought, Cas considered. In fact, he had rarely considered such acts at all until –
Dean leaned back against the headboard, tucking his knees to his chest. Cas was back. He’d gotten him back. He was alive. He was safe.
When not much seemed to be happening, Eileen brought them each a beer. They sat around the table, quiet and tense at first, but after some time passed and with not much exciting happening on screen, they relaxed.
He and Sam talked it through. Spoke about the pendant, how Dean had gotten it off him. Cas didn’t tell Sam that Dean had been shot – how close he’d come to sacrificing himself once again. He assured Sam they’d be home soon. That Cas had taken a stash of holy oil when he’d last returned to the bunker to retrieve Dean’s weapons, and would call him when the pendant was destroyed.
Dean stopped him with a hand on his wrist. It seemed to take much effort for the man to look up and meet the angel’s eyes then. Dean looked at Castiel, and though he stood the slightest bit taller than Cas’ vessel, the hunter seemed to shrink in on himself as he spoke. “I meant, no one ever notices things like that about
Charlie gave him a quick squeeze, and Dean planted a kiss on the top of her head before she released him. “I’ll bring you a couple of slices, okay?”
He’d heard her prayers, frantic and desperate. The man had been following her for the better part of an hour. She’d been too afraid to get in her own car lest he followed her home.
Dean chuckled, slapping him on the shoulder. “Well, buddy, no offence but today’s the day.” He knelt in front of Cas, unaware of how rigid Cas had suddenly become, and searched the cabinet beneath the sink. He whistled at the selection of complimentary shampoos and lotions. “Could have used these a minute ago,” he mumbled, impatiently knocking over bottles. He finally found a razor, and with suggestive brows, he smirked up at Cas.
Dean blew out a breath from his nose, and Charlie pulled back, gripping him gently by his cheeks to force him to look at her. “I mean it, Dean. He’s fine. More than fine,” she bit her lip, seeming to think carefully about her next words. She released her hold on Dean and sat cross legged on top of the table next to the laptop. Dean followed her movement, eyes darting warily to the laptop.
Something had been nagging at him since that night, lingering just out of reach. Dean blinked, willing his eyes to adjust to the darkness. Cas wrapped an arm around his bare chest and Dean tried to settle himself into the angel’s embrace.
Castiel never cared for the humans in that same way. They were such fleeting, beautiful souls. He couldn’t imagine allowing himself to care without caring too much. All his long life, Castiel had been the angel with a chip in his shoulder. The angel who felt the burning need to question
Charlie had bidden Cas goodbye early that morning. He’d been almost disappointed to see her awake at sunrise, having gotten word of her girlfriend’s return.
As commanding as Dean was in everyday life, Cas felt a smug satisfaction at how easily conquered Dean was in the bedroom. Though Dean had infinitely more experience than Cas, Cas knew every detail of Dean’s fantasies. Dean worshipped Cas’ body like an alter, but Cas found such joy in making Dean feel good. With every ragged breath and muffled gasp, every involuntary call of Cas’ name from Dean’s lips, Cas fell harder and harder in love.
method before he could think better of it. “Is this one of those ‘gay pride’ things?” he threw up some air quotes as he spoke. “‘Cause that’s not me.”
Cas kissed him back, running a hand down Dean's back. Dean pulled back to look Cas in the eye. "You sure about all this? I mean
“What? Hell no!” Dean scoffed, gesturing to the empty stairway. “Sammy, this is the guy of my dreams.”
“Relax, man,” Charlie quickly added, gauging the panic in his reaction. “Cas won’t tell us shit. The dude’s a closed book.”
She’d called it. Technically, she’d called it on both sides, but now wasn’t the time for mental high-fives. Those dudes had some shit to figure out.
Dean looked up then, the truth of those words stunning him into silence. Gently, he pulled Cas down to lay next to him. Dean sat up, pulling off his flannel, smirking as he noticed Cas’ eyes widening a fraction. He lay down once more, one arm tucking beneath Cas’ neck, hand buried in his hair, the other undoing each button of Cas’ shirt. When he finished, Dean trailed his hand down the hard plains of Cas’ stomach, thumbs dipping beneath the waistband of his pants and skimming along his hips.
Cas tried to let the relief wash over him and failed fantastically. “Did something happen when I was gone? Dean, are you hurt?” Cas scanned him head to toe, feeling the warmth of his grace rise to the surface, ready to heal. Ready, as always, to go to war for Dean Winchester.
Dean raised a brow. “Thought you were sick of us making out in front of you.” Dean signed the words as he spoke, pulling stupid kissy faces just to piss Sam off.
Dean buried his face in Cas’ neck, losing himself to the feel of his skin, the small gasps and desperate grabs that Cas made for him. The angel was impatient, and Dean took a little too much pleasure in denying Cas’ attempts to kiss him, touch him. He kissed along Cas’ jaw, biting gently and grinning in victory when Cas’ hips flexed against him.
“Just got here. Didn’t mean to interrupt your little party of one,” she smiled wide, hoping for some kind of reaction.
Charlie’s palm gently beat against his shoulder and Cas snapped to attention. His brows rose in amusement. Even through her playful assault, Charlie’s eyes never left the screen.
“I’m not your –“ the guy trailed off. His blue eyes bore into Dean’s and once again he stepped just a little too close for comfort. Dean was
Dean thought, for the hundredth time, of giving the guy one of his jackets. Giving him some real clothes so he wouldn’t be runnin’ around looking like some kind of dorky math professor. His mouth twitched at the thought, and he quickly shut out the images that followed.
time less than a day ago, but Dean wondered if there’d ever come a day his brain wouldn’t take a second to catch up. To remind him that this was allowed. That Cas wanted this. That instead of pushing him away, he could pull his angel closer. Instead of fighting what had been right in front of them all these years, he could fucking chill and enjoy it. Because
, close. He kissed him softly, tongue trailing lightly along Cas’ bottom lip and retreating when he felt Cas smile.
“Hold up,” Dean said, a thought striking him like a bucket of cold water. If things were going to get messy, he needed to cover his tracks. He moved to the radio on his desk, cursing softly when he realised most of his tapes were in Baby. He pulled open a drawer, shuffling through a bunch of crap until he found a single tape.
He watched the decision in Cas’ eyes; how they seemed to glow, and not in that way they did when he used his mojo.
Dean’s brain slowed down once again, which was honestly for the best. Was this guy being serious? Dean didn’t know whether to laugh or be impressed. It was a pretty cool name, as names went. Not exactly the kind he might have given a guy dressed in a slutty angel costume, sure, but... Dean swallowed, determined not to look too hard into the authority of that brow. His gaze settled on those bare muscled thighs for a moment.
As Dean snored softly in the crook of Castiel’s shoulder, the angel wondered what Dean had faced to learn such resilience.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut and only hugged the man tighter. If Bobby thought he was being weird, the older man didn’t say. He never did. His uncle always seemed to know exactly what Dean needed – even if it was a verbal (well deserved) ass-kicking on occasion.
But though he knew he’d be out of town in just a few days; knew it wouldn’t be easy to get another shot like this, Dean only rested his head on Cas’ shoulder, letting the soothing rumble of the man’s voice lull him to sleep.
Instead he looked at Cas; praying damn hard the guy could still hear him under all that warding. And if Cas couldn't hear his prayers, if it all went wrong – Dean made sure everything he needed to say was right there on his face.
Cas looked at him then, one brow raised, a smile crooked at the corner of his mouth. "You're very sweet. But I would very much like to fuck you, Dean. If that is okay with you?"
Chuck and Billie’s deaths both had their impact on the afterlife. If a new Death had been appointed, Cas nor the Winchesters had been interested making their acquaintance. Heaven, on the other hand, he knew had changed. For the better. Perhaps it was fitting, Chuck’s betrayal, for the angels to learn compassion for humanity. To build a home in Heaven with the love for humanity at heart instead of reverence for an absent god in mind.
Dean pulled a face at his brother. He already found himself sorely regretting that little stunt with the half-written letter he’d snatched from Sam earlier that day. Sam was really taking every opportunity to get his revenge.
,” that deep voice hushed in quiet surprise as Dean pulled a pen from his pocket and tore off the lid between his teeth. He hastily scribbled Bobby’s home number on the guy’s takeout coffee cup before he lost his nerve. Bobby wouldn’t mind. Probably.
Castiel’s expression slowly faded from alarm to resignation, but Dean felt something else behind that look. It had to count for something that the dude couldn’t keep his eyes off Dean, right?
“Go,” Charlie said, still smiling like an idiot. She stood from her seat opposite Dean to pull him to his feet. Charlie wrapped her arms around him and squeezed. “You got this. And we’re here for you, okay?”
The man snapped his fingers and four balls of crackling light appeared. When he began juggling them, Dean rolled his eyes. Sam went through a magic phase a few years back. Dean felt like he’d seen every trick in the book by now, but he couldn’t begin to figure out how this dude was doing it.
Sam crossed his arms. It wasn’t often he caught his older brother squirming in the face of someone he obviously had a bit of a crush on. The kid’s eyes lit with amusement.
He reached for Cas’ phone, but… he should wait, right? This thing was too new. Shouldn’t he tell Sam first? He felt like shit for even thinking it, but Charlie would be easier. She’d done the whole coming out thing.
Freedom was in the kisses; first exploring and reverent, then desperate, indulgent. Greedy to take back all they could have had in the years they’d wanted this. Freedom were the hands that gripped Cas’ shoulders in a moment of ecstasy, as surely as Cas had gripped Dean’s years ago in Hell. Freedom was laying themselves bare; exploring the other’s body in soft kisses even after they were spent. Freedom was the time they had ahead, their futures, their choices. Together.
Dean cleared his throat and the angel’s attention snapped away. He looked up to find Dean’s hand extended out toward him, a knowing look in Dean’s eye that was only made worse by the slightly crooked smile that slowly tugged at the corner of his lips.
A voice rang in Dean’s ears when he curled his fingers around Cas’, stroking the pad of his thumb along his angel’s ring finger. Words he hadn’t heard in years but had haunted him like ghost ever since.
Cas had sensed him several times throughout the day, lingering in doorways and staring at Cas as though he was expecting something. But every time Cas tried to converse with him, Dean would mumble under his breath and hurry off to some secluded corner of the Bunker.
“Oh, please,” Dean scoffed. That was exactly what he was doing, but Sam didn’t need to call him out on it. He hadn’t come all this way just to sit in Bobby’s empty house with not even the smallest chance of a blue-eyed hottie in a trench coat giving him a call. “It’s called turning a profit, bitch. Ten dollars to you is worth like fifty bucks of candy to both of us. It’s a win-win.”
Nothing put things in perspective quite as much as having your life rest in the wrathful hands of a fallen angel. An angel that had fallen for him. An angel he trusted, that was family, that he-
Dean ignored the wary glances of the parents when they reluctantly handed him a couple of Reece’s Pieces. Sammy, on the other hand, had a bigger stash than he could carry.
“Never said I was happy about it, did I? Besides,” he said, staring up at the angel with a knowing look in his eyes. “You need me around.”
But the soft groan that reached his ears through the sound of running water drowned out the voices of thousands.
The man winked at the girls, who stepped aside automatically as he lifted his hands in front of his chest. With a snap of his fingers, tiny fireworks burst into life, whizzing between his outstretched palms and sparkling between his fingertips. When he clapped his hands together, the fireworks disappeared.
He breathed. Got to his feet. Braced himself protectively in front of Cas, and by the time the demons reached the room, he was damn ready for them.
What kind of question was that anyway? Dean’s head was swimming with memories, and very few of them good. Cas dying feet in front of him after that cheap shot Lucifer pulled through the rift. Cas dead at the hands of that reaper. Cas hurting again and again all because of Dean.
Dean slammed his beer on the table. “I get it, okay? He’s dead. He’s the biggest raging dick on the planet and he’s dead,” Dean said, his anger depleting with each word. “That doesn’t change anything. It doesn’t take back what he said or any of the shit that he did. He
Sam looked up at Charlie. “Seriously, are you sure this is a good idea? I mean I’m all for it, but I don’t know. He hasn’t been doing too good lately.”
Sam and Eileen talked about getting a place together. Charlie and Stevie mentioned they were thinking about getting a cat. Almost half an hour had passed before Eileen pointed at the screen, a frown knitting between her brows.
Dean manages to get an impromptu date with the scantily clad angel. Despite his better judgement, Castiel agrees to go to the old Sanderson house. Nothing good can come from messing with ancient spell books and candles under a full moon.
was an understatement. At least that beard was shaved. Dean was a good-looking guy, but that season 5 Rick Grimes look wasn’t his best. She’d teased him about it – resorting to any measures she could to get a reaction out of him in those early days after Chuck. He’d gotten better since, obviously. Small improvements here and there. It was the talking and the isolating that was the worst of it now.
Charlie rolled her eyes. “Come on. Don’t play dumb with me, Winchester. How long have you known you felt like this about him?”
Dean got his bearings first, steadying Cas with a grip to his elbows. He searched Cas’ eyes, staring too long and too hard but Dean didn’t care. He needed Cas to be alright. “You’re okay?” His voice was so weak it was pathetic, but that didn’t matter.
When Sam eventually left, muttering about Dean needing to hit the shower, Cas planted a kiss on Dean’s forehead. He held Dean until the weight of all those years of pain and denial and doubt lifted from his body.
“Do not,” Castiel snarled in Dean's ear, his voice deeper, almost unrecognisable, “presume to know what is
Dean was on the floor where Cas had left him. His phone lighting up next to him, its screen too small for Cas to read the name on display.
The museum was busy. A red carpet lined on either side with matching coloured ropes tied to golden stands, leading the way to the tall stone building. Cas found no sign of any demons, no hint of the supernatural in the faces outside.
Dean let Karla drag him up the stairs and down that empty hallway. The view from behind was pretty good. Almost enough to forget about Cas – whatever the hell the guy was playing at.
Dean kissed him back desperately, arms tightening around Cas’ waist. His heart was hammering so hard between them, he was sure Cas would feel it.
Dean wasn’t hearing right. There was no fucking way Cas had just said any of that. It felt like Dean’s brain was running low on charge; each word from the angel’s mouth had to battle past every wall Dean had built in his mind. When they finally hit…
“It was nice to meet you, Dean,” he said, placing a hand on Dean’s left shoulder and inclining his head toward him. His expression earnest as he added “Trick or Treat”, in the tone of someone wishing Merry Christmas. The wink that followed was so god damn terrible, Dean felt his heart stumble in his chest.
Dean woke to a dark room, fighting to breathe through aching lungs. He closed his fists tight around the thin bedsheets, battling against the echoes of the nightmare.
Dean ordered food; enough of it that Cas interrupted the phone call with a hand on Dean’s arm and a stern look that said: “I don’t eat, and there is no way you will finish all that by yourself.” Dean mouthed “watch me,” grinned like a kid, and then asked for dessert options.
He’d paused in the screaming silence between them. Rooted to the spot, incapable of abandoning Dean. Instead, he’d made himself invisible. Watching, listening to that hitch of breath, the turning of the gears in Dean’s mind until his anger was spent. Diffusing into that quiet self-loathing, until his inner darkness split through with the loveliest spear of hope. Repentance.
Dean had glared into that mirror and seen his father glaring back at him. That reflection was all John Winchester in those early days after their mom died and the only home they’d ever known had burned to the ground, taking every chance at a normal life with it. Dean had been no better when he’d lost Cas. Chasing ghosts and hunting answers. The difference was, he’d already burned his bridges with his family. He’d let Sammy down. Let his kid down. Let Charlie down.
It wasn’t like he wanted his brother to be miserable. Sometimes Dean just couldn’t see past his own dark cloud to see the light at the end of anyone else’s tunnel. It’d been so damn long since he’d felt something. Drinking, hooking up with hot guys and girls in bars he wasn’t even old enough to patron just wasn’t doing it for him anymore.
Cas found that freedom was not a rope around his neck, but of strong arms wrapped around his waist, the flushed skin on freckled cheeks. Dilated pupils in ever-green eyes, alight with their own joy and relief. Dean broke free of his fate and found free will in his love for Cas, and in that, Cas found his happiness. A feeling in all his millions of years he’d never begun to imagine.
When he’d walked Charlie to her car hours earlier, she’d embraced him in a hug. Promising to return later that week and leaving Cas with a message he’d found both comforting and cryptic.
People screamed, ducking, blades singing, and guns cocked on instinct alone as every lightbulb in the building exploded. Sparks rained down on them, and Dean grinned, brushing the dusting of glass from Cas’ feather-soft hair. His fingers lingered, trailing gently through the strands.
Mary’s eyes sparkled as she looked up at her eldest son, hands fisted at his side. Dean blew out a breath as she straightened his shirt. “I used to tell you that angels were watching over you when you were little. Remember that?” she smiled.
The demon was fast. All it took was one split second of distraction and Cas was knocked across the room, back slamming against the wall. Brick cracked and crumbled at the impact. He shifted up to his knees, scrambling to get his bearings.
Cas watched Dean with every ounce of love he had for him plain on his face as Dean moved to hug his brother. He smiled as Sam shot him a thumbs up over Dean’s shoulder.
Dean took the risk of glancing down at the youngest witch on the floor. Already, some colour seemed to be returning to Ruby’s face. The whites of her knuckles shone as her grip strengthened on the wooden stake.
Crowley stood in the entrance - walked right into the demon trap Ellen had straight up refused to lift, even for today. Not that Dean could blame her. The thing wasn't even covered, like the dude
Dean’s throat bobbed and Cas didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know what to do. He couldn’t read the exact emotion in Dean’s eyes, but knew well enough what the war of indecision looked like on him.
Blue eyes blinked through the moonlit room, taking in the salted windowsills and the crumbling ceiling plaster; the remains of a missing chandelier. He didn’t dare stretch his stiff limbs lest he woke Dean.
“Pretty one, isn’t he?” the cat said. There was a mocking tone to its voice that instantly chilled any warmth Castiel might have felt for the creature. He only glared in response.
No, this was worse. It was better. It was damn near cosmic, it felt so much bigger than that. The stakes too high. This wasn’t – this thing with Cas, it was always… it was…
Sam could hate him. Be pissed as hell at him, fine, whatever. But if there was one thing Dean couldn’t deal with, it was his brother being afraid of him.
He checked that Sam hadn’t yet come home and paused for the briefest moment outside of Dean’s empty bedroom. Cas rested his forehead against the closed door, eyes shut tight and heart racing. Not thinking of Dean’s fingers grazing his throat or how it had taken all his strength not to lean into the touch. Not thinking of starry eyes and bloody palms and relief that gave way to regret all too quickly. And then he returned to the tailors. To Dean.
His angelic lifespan had never factored into conversation with the Winchesters. Somewhere along the way at the beginning of a decade past, Cas had become family to these brothers. Not in flesh and blood, nor the ways of duty and obedience of the angels. Cas was family just as Charlie and Jody and Claire were family to Sam and Dean.
The Bunker was quiet this late at night. Judging by the discarded dinner jacket in the kitchen and leftover desserts in plastic containers on the counter, Sam and Eileen had long since returned from their date and had gone to bed.
The sun had gone down; the room lit only by the glow of the streetlights outside. Cas watched as the woman who’d lured Dean picked up the gun.
Slow footsteps made their way from the back of the room. The woman was short; long dark hair and dressed smart enough to blend right in. She paused, assessing Dean.
Bracing his hands on his knees, Dean stood. He lifted his arms above his head in a stretch causing his t-shirt to climb above his hips. Castiel swallowed hard, his eyes glued to the exposed skin, the slight indentation at Dean’s hipbones.
Dean’s neck prickled as the bouncer looked the three of them up and down. The dude was huge, and Dean flashed him the biggest grin as they passed him by.
, was the better option. He’d dressed quickly, feeling stupid and vulnerable for no damn reason. But when he’d pulled back his curtain, Cas still hadn’t finished.
The guys jeered and egged them on, but Sam walked away with his back straight and his head held high.
“They won’t,” Cas said, his voice firm. If it weren’t for Dean’s unexpected presence, he’d have succeeded by now. He told him as much. About the pendant, where they’d find it, and who he suspected had brought it into existence.
Putting his foot down and lifting the other onto the sink, he dared a look at the place that an old scar had once been. Dean made the mental note to thank Cas for wiping the slate clean when he’d rebuilt him from nothing after Hell. Of all the scars he’d collected as a kid, there was one that had always reminded him of what he was. What he’d only ever be.
Dean shifted, setting his cold coffee on the floor. Cas hadn’t touched his either, but Dean didn’t care. He squeezed Cas’ hand, and when the angel met his eyes Dean tilted his head, gesturing toward the door. They wordlessly crept out, leaving Jack transfixed on his cartoons. Cas closed the door quietly behind them.
After a time, he stood. Watched the mother swan who dipped her head beneath the water and back again, droplets trickling down her white feathers. He smiled. Recognising contentment in the creature.
Who was she kidding? Those idiots are practically married already. They were living together. Raising a kid together - which, honestly, was pretty weird now she thought about it.
Dean thought as he crushed his lips to Cas’. He tasted like peanut butter and jelly and some of that sickly-sweet cocktail Ellen had mixed up for the guy. They ignored the cheers, the whistles, the sound of disgust from Claire as she muttered “get a room, guys. Gross.”
The words caught in Dean’s throat. The truth of them forcing him to his knees. Panic crept along his skin, constricting his throat, clenching his belly. He breathed. Breathed. Breathed.
Dean’s chest rose and fell hard as Cas pulled away, sitting up on his knees, Dean’s legs between them. He stared down at Dean with a question in his eyes and Dean nodded, wetting his lips. He propped himself up on his elbows, reaching for Cas’ blazer. With Cas’ help, they removed it, hurriedly tossing it to the floor.
Dean laughed when Cas told him that the pizza man had been misleading, that intercourse could not always happen again as quickly as it had on television. Cas couldn’t help the pride when Dean asked Cas, once again, about the research he'd done; swearing that Cas had to have done this with someone else before. There were a lot of downsides to Angel Radio, but constantly being subjected to Dean Winchester’s imagination year after year could be very enlightening. But Cas wouldn't tell him that.
Cas wandered through the lonely halls, his feet carrying him to Dean’s bedroom before he realised where they were taking him. He slowed his steps, his eyes dropping guiltily to the floor. Still trying to puzzle out exactly why he was feeling guilty, Cas frowned.
altered how you feel. Please, trust me on that.” He paused, looking away again. “If we're... I have no idea how you really feel, Dean. But whatever it is, I don't think you want to feel this way."
Cas reached for the pendant, laying abandoned at Dean’s side. The moment his fingers closed around it, he knew it was a mistake.
Was it weird to spend one of your only nights alone sticking your nose in your best friends’ relationship issues?
Dean moved without thinking, fixing the tie that he most definitely did not choose to compliment Cas’ eyes. He had to hand it to himself, though. It was a perfect match. He fixed his friend’s blazer, smoothing down the collar. Like it was his job or some shit.
What would have become of the world had he not listened? What horrors might have rippled through the world had he snuffed out the chance for evolution? For repentance.
In a few days Dean would leave Salem. By the time he returned, Castiel knew he wouldn’t be here. Perhaps there was comfort in the idea of being free of temptation. To be alone in the universe once more, when not even the same stars shone in the void between their worlds.
Castiel made quick work of healing Dean’s back. The light of his grace pooled in his palm as he knit the small cuts together again, tracing feather-soft touches with his fingers around the area. It was hardly a risk, Castiel told himself. Neither brother could see the effects of his power from where they stood, and besides, the dried blood still clung to Dean’s skin, painting the tanned and freckled canvas with a sinister red.
It took three hard tugs with his full weight on the thing before Dean managed to break off the chandelier. It crashed to the floor and Dean jumped down after it, stomping on the shattered glass to get to the iron bar at its centre. Sam had better be right about this.
Without any watchful eyes on him, Castiel pushed against the force of the angel warding with the palm of his hand; his grace rising within and setting his eyes aglow. It was a wasted effort.
Castiel shook his head slowly, closing the door behind him. As he passed Dean by, he placed a hand on his back right atop where his wounds should be. “You healed quickly,” Cas said quietly without meeting his eye. “There wasn’t much blood.”
"Hey, hey, wow. I'm not laughing at you, man. I'm not," Dean said quickly, reaching for Cas' face. "I just... I didn't expect... You're good, Cas," Dean mumbled, his own cheeks flushed now at the honesty. He pressed a sweet kiss to Cas' lips, pulling away only far enough to say, "You're so fucking good for me."
Meg stepped toward him, sniffing the air. Not at all concerned with her fallen sister. That same smile stretched across her lips as she said, “The boy lies. I smell another. A child,” she finished excitedly, grinning at Rowena.
So, instead, Castiel watched the television screen. The movie was nearing the end of its third run by now, and he’d begun to anticipate each line before it was spoken. He turned his focus to the voices; to the static dancing over top the characters in the story. He did not think about the warm body at his side, nor the urge to pull his coat around the sleeping man. He didn’t memorise the map of veins on the back of Dean’s hand or wonder at the story of each small scar that littered his skin.
Had stopped him before he said it first. In the one place that Dean felt free to say it. Where all the ghosts of his childhood couldn’t haunt him. Not John, not Mary, not even himself. Purgatory was the one place his filthy soul felt unburdened by judgement or consequence. Where he didn’t have to look out for anyone but himself, and the angel. Purgatory was lonely in a way Dean could understand, violent in a way that he could navigate, pure in a way he could reckon with.
It’d been a long time since he’d felt like this. As much as he outright denied it, Dean was an affectionate guy. He told himself he didn’t care about his hook-ups, and for the most part he didn’t. Not really. He indulged in food when he was hungry, drank his fill when he felt the need – and sometimes, sure, he went a little too far. Sex was rarely just about the sex, though. Dean was hungry; starving for something he could hold in his arms, but still always felt just out of reach.
Dean chuckled. “She was the one with the…” he made the motion he was sure even Cas would recognise for “big boobs”, and innocently changed track when Cas glared all the harder. “With the religious parents,” he finished. Prideful and smirking.
Cas shut his eyes tight, and Dean could have sworn his own ribs cracked right then. Cas reached out two fingers toward Dean’s forehead, and Dean leaned back out of the touch, his brow knit in fear and confusion.
He wasn’t entirely sure when he’d agreed, but before he knew it there was a thin layer of shaving foam covering his face and neck. A shirtless Dean filling the sink, wetting the razor beneath the stream of the tap.
“First of all, I’m Batman. Always,” his tone was serious, as if he’d said the words a thousand times before. Perhaps he had. Even in his late thirties, Dean retained a quiet joy for the few pleasant memories of his childhood.
It was so jarring, the image, that it pulled him out of the fantasy for a moment. Desperate to switch back, he thought of another day, another girl. But again, the image changed.
He hated himself. So much he couldn’t bear it. He hated who he was; he hated every thought and every fucked up thing he’d ever done. He hated that he couldn’t save everyone. That he’d let so many people down. That he always would.
It wasn’t just Stanford; the fights with Sammy. With dad. Dean had worked a couple cases here, in LA. Ran some other jobs, too. Shit he’d rather leave buried at the back of his mind with the rest of the crap that scarred and haunted him. Things he feared, things he wanted.
Cas rolled his eyes. He snatched his hand back, pressing it over Dean's mouth to silence the string of self-deprecations Dean realised Cas could hear. Dean shot him an apologetic look and Cas raised a single brow, removing his hand to stroke a finger along Dean's lips. His eyes glazed over a little, as if he was mesmerised by the action. Dean closed his eyes for a moment, relishing the contact before sucking Cas' finger into his mouth, just to see how the angel would react. Cas' breath hitched, and Dean took that as a welcome sign to keep going.
He tried hard not to think of that night. Cas and Jack falling through the tear in the universe – Cas collapsing into Dean’s waiting arms. Cas’ name the first and only word that had left Dean’s mouth in days.
Now, because of Dean, the world was saved. Because of Cas, the world was free. Free to make their own choices, to love who they wanted. Live how they wanted. No grand plans, no spanners in the works. No bullshit pre-destined games with cheaters playing them all like puppets on a string.
It was the damn teleporting getting to his head. He wasn’t staring at Cas. He was just out of it. Shit, of course he was. All that zapping around – it wasn’t natural.
It hadn’t been this bad… hell, in years. The not-talking thing. It crept on him sometimes. When shit got so bad; when there was more noise and pain in his head than he could make sense of. There was the anger and the fear; those he could deal with. Those he was so used to that he wouldn’t know what to do without them.
Dean released his hold on Cas just enough to look at him. At his best friend. At the angel who’d pulled him from Hell ten years ago. At the one person who’d ever seen Dean, all of him, and
Dean rolled his eyes with equal dramatics. “Uh… both, I guess?” When both Cas and Sam glared at him with impatience, Dean finally took off the mask of humour and deflection. He straightened his posture, glancing down as he curled his fingers around Cas’, and squeezed. “It’s been a long time coming,” he said to Sam. “A damn long time.”
Sammy had a pretty good bitchface, but Cas could be downright scary when he wanted. For a little nerdy dude with wings.
“It means,” Sam paused, stopping outside of a random house on the corner of a street. There was a party going on inside, the music punctuated with high pitched squeals of delight and the chanting of drinking games. “It means I don’t want any part of this. I don’t want to hunt, I don’t want to be back on the road, and I don’t wanna hear whatever speech you got planned about me coming back. It’s not happening.”
– Dean knocked on Sam’s bedroom door and let himself in before he got a response. The room was huge; a twin bed draped in a tie dye blanket; Sam’s school bag abandoned on top. There were three old bay windows, with the wooden seats under them and everything.
“Oh,” Dean tried not to let his disappointment show. “Yeah. Yeah, it’s cool. We’ll grab a pizza, hit up a couple houses for candy. Whatever. You got a date or somethin’?” He eyed Bobby’s outfit; the clean suit he wore in place of his usual flannel, baseball cap, and blue jeans. Up until now, Dean figured he’d been out working a case.
It was when shit went beyond all that, that Dean would shut down. Not by choice. It was like his tongue was too heavy, his lips too tired to form the words. His voice buried in some cave in his chest, so far beyond his reach that he couldn’t call it up no matter how hard he tried.
“This is Salem, ya idgit. You can’t go fifty feet without saltin’ some sorry son of a bitch around here.”
Cas climbed off the bed and stood, his unbuttoned pants falling around his ankles. His cheeks flushed; eyes slightly wide. But he held out a hand, reaching out to pull Dean to his feet.
They reached Bobby’s front porch and Sam took the steps two at a time. He fumbled with his keys for a moment and quickly rushed inside, muttering about having to use the bathroom. Castiel followed slowly, as though he wasn’t sure whether he was supposed to be here. Dean paused in the open doorway, gesturing for Cas to follow.
Now, Castiel walked alongside Dean and his younger sibling as they headed toward the one place in Salem that Gabriel had warned him not to enter. He’d left Gabriel behind to his petty tricks without a word and was trying not to think too hard about
He smiled sadly. The void between them now since Cas had returned had never been quite so vast. It was cruel almost. To finally have the chance to write their own story, and still finding that they weren’t on the same page.
Cas smiled. He debated watching the brothers play along the shallow waters for a while; the sun receding in plumes of gold and fuchsia reflecting along the surface. But this was a private moment. Dean was happy. Despite all he’d told Cas, despite all the horrors he’d known, Dean found happiness in the quietest corners of the world where he felt safe to be himself. Free to simply be.
He sighed, bracing himself for the pitying looks. His fingers traced along the Impala keys in his pocket, ready to bolt the first chance he got. But when he looked up, pity was the last thing he found in his friends’ faces.
“Perhaps I should go first,” Castiel said as Dean put one foot in the door. The freckled man turned back, a brilliant grin on his face.
“No, but I think I might be,” Sam said drily. He stood, finishing the dregs of his beer in one gulp. “I’m gonna turn in.”
“Whatever,” Dean mumbled, taking the seat opposite his brother. He pointed toward the bag with his mug. “What’ya got there?” he said, forcing himself to act normal. Small talk. It was fine.
Cas held Dean, repeating the words over and over between kisses, to his lips, his forehead, his neck, his hands.
The footage continued forwarding. Dean remained on the floor, Cas’ bloody handprint on his shaking shoulder. Cas manually forwarded through the footage, noting the timestamps on the bottom right of the screen.
Without his usual stash of weapons, Cas supposed Dean seemed almost naked. A thought he quickly purged from his mind as shame heated his brow.
Cas was frozen for the longest second of Dean’s life. But just as Dean made to move away, Cas pulled him closer, arms wrapping around Dean’s neck. Cas’ lips were so soft – so unbearably gentle. Despite his pounding heart, Dean kissed him sweetly. He stroked a thumb along Cas’ jaw, desperately trying to get a hold of himself.
“Eileen?” Dean tried the handle, shaking it harder than necessary.  “Sam?” he roared, shouldering the door hard enough that he it should have broken down by now.
Dean’s whole body flushed, his spine locking. He pulled the collar of his shirt further up his neck and kept his eyes on the pie. “Shut up.”
“Fine,” Castiel relented. The timbre of his voice sent chills all the way down Dean’s bowlegs. “Wait here,” he gestured down to the white sheet clinging to his frankly gorgeous body, “I need to change my clothes.”
He found Dean struggling against a wall, a different woman than he’d seen before fighting to restrain him.
Dean’s throat was tight. He fought back against the tears, his breath shaking. This was more than he deserved, and yet Cas kept going. Telling Dean that he loved him over and over until the words began to sink in.
The plan was good. Skip the lines, because of course a chick this hot didn’t need a ticket, even for some musty ass museum. Check the back room for any sign of the pendant. And if Karla was as into him as Dean hoped she was…
you to know I’m fighting this shit. That you’re worth the fight. You’ve always been worth the damn fight. And I know it’s stupid-“
With a thud, the blade struck true in the abandoned vessel’s heart. Black eyes turned to brown, glassy and unseeing. Surprise knitting her brows before her mouth slackened. The body fell, mere inches from the trap, empty eyes staring up at Castiel.
Dean reached out without thinking, wiping away the blood on Cas' face with the pad of his thumb. Not noting the softness of the angel’s skin. The heat of it. Nor did he think about how
Cas frowned. A sky-blue tie hung from the hanger. He glanced at his own tie, backward and unkempt compared to the one Dean now wore.
“Dean!” Castiel warned, desperately praying he could get inside. Even as the ancient building shook, the warding held fast. Castiel was helpless.
There was a whole crowd out there, now carefully lined at either side of the door. And a moment later-
Rowena winked, like she knew exactly what he was thinking. She’d told John Winchester precisely what he was missing today, before she left him to rot in whatever corner of hell he was in.
“Actually," that deep voice began, "Halloween is an old tradition. It’s said to be the one night of the year where spirits of the dead can roam the earth.”
Then Cas was alone. Restless. He felt cramped in a cage of bones. His wings too tight, his thoughts too loud.
The demon’s true eyes showed then, narrowing in disgust and a healthy dose of fear. When he didn’t answer, Cas bashed his head against the wall. Fisted the collar of the demon’s shirt with his other hand. It revolted him to stand so close the creature, but Cas leaned close, nose to nose with the demon and repeated the question.
The witch had long, curly auburn hair that glowed like fire even in the darkness. The long, skin-tight velvet dress she wore was corseted at the waist; the green complimenting her hair and the ribbon matching it exactly. With one hand on her hip, the witch pursed her lips and snapped her fingers, setting every candle in the house aglow.
“Dude,” Charlie said with the biggest smile, “this place is crawling with babes and you haven’t looked at a single woman – or dude – once. What are you still doing here?”
Dean opened his mouth to ask for a name when a high-pitched bell rang across the way. As if they’d been counting down the seconds for school to end, the front door of Jacob Bailey High School burst open almost immediately, tens of kids piling out on top of one another.
The guy’s smile faltered a little. “There’s no such thing as the supernatural,” he said seriously. The words sounded almost recited, and Dean detected a note of resignation in there, too.
Chewing on the end of the pen, he read through all his shit twice over. Every time one of those thoughts crept back into his head, he read the counter argument. He broke it down. He added to the chaos occasionally, but finally, he was thinking straight.
“Too much candy, huh?” Dean nudged Cas gently, blowing out his cheeks in exaggeration of his own fullness.
“What’re you doin’ here?” It was no co-incidence that Sam tore away at the sound of giggling girls behind them.
He considered arguing. Flying Dean to the bunker and disappearing for weeks to find some solstice from this madness inside him.
And sometimes – maybe more often than that – Dean wished he were more like Cas. There was something rotten about Dean. He knew that. He’d seen too much. Too much blood on his hands, too many people he’d failed. Cas included.
. Your brother’s doing great. If I had any say,” he held up his hands to stop the interruption before Dean even got the chance, “which I know I don’t, you’d be doin’ whatever the hell makes ya happy. It don’t always gotta be hunting.”
The usual charge of energy was instantaneous in the wake of his brother’s absence. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he and Cas had been alone together.
Since that night… He could hardly think of that night without his heart cracking in two. When Cas had said those words that changed everything. And then he was gone. When Dean had everything he’d never even dared let himself want. And lost it all in one breath.
If Castiel imagined how it would feel to curl his fingers in Dean’s hand, it was easy to blame it on the small urges of his vessel.
Dean ran his fingers through his slightly grown-out hair, thinking. What was he so afraid of, really? He stood reluctantly, taking care to fold Cas’ coat on the table. Dean stretched out his limbs. Son of a bitch, his back felt better than it had in months.
“Fine,” Sam shrugged. He disappeared for a moment into the living room and returned with Bobby’s baseball hat. “Then I’m a rap singer” he said, placing it over his head.
Dean tried to tell himself he felt totally out of place in Cas’ trench coat; but it was warm and safe and just a little oversized on him. Dean was
Sam dropped his gaze, but it was Cas’ expression that threatened to break Charlie’s heart then and there. The angel took a seat at the table, head in his hands and his mouth turned down. Puppy eyes dialled up to eleven.
Over his shoulder, Sam flipped Dean off. “Don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said, slamming the drawer shut and sitting on top of the desk to block it.
, Dean, it was embarrassing! You think I came here to go around beating guys up and pretending we’re on a hunt? Screw you, man. I’m out.”
Dean turned fully to face his brother. “Damn, Sammy, you’ve been holding out on me,” he swatted Sam’s shoulder like this was a brand new, ingenious idea he hadn’t heard of until now. “You didn’t tell me it was a witch museum.”
Cas’ mouth fell slightly open. He felt the heat of his cheeks rising, and he quickly returned the letter to his breast pocket.
There was the occasional piece of information that Cas found useful. Communication, it seemed, was key. It made him smile to think back on that paragraph - talking was neither one of his nor Dean’s strong points. But there were other forms of communication, he’d learned. Certain
Every now and then, he allowed himself to look at Cas’ face. He was being a damn creep – remembered himself yelling at Cas plenty of times over the years for watching Dean sleep. But Dean never had the luxury of just looking at Cas, just because he could.
“It belonged to the museum,” Sam said, as if that meant anything. “It’s part of the history of the town, Dean. Besides, I’m pretty sure it’s against the law to-“
Dean raised his brows, his lips twitching into a smile. He tried to come up with a response; something funny, something flirty…
It still didn’t feel real. When had he ever had everyone he loved in one room together? Not for a funeral, not for a hunt. To celebrate. To celebrate
“So, you’re sayin’ Rufus has nothin’ to do with you stickin’ around this place?” Dean smirked, bracing himself for something else to be thrown his way. Rufus was Bobby’s best friend and neighbour, but god, if they didn’t fight like a couple of bitter old bastards.
“Is that dude planning on elaborating, or what?” Stevie rolled her eyes. Despite the unsexy interruption, there was a tone of amusement in her voice.
Dean’s hands curled into fists at his side. Short nails digging into his palms hard enough to draw blood. Why did he feel like this? Why was he so angry at Cas, when less an hour ago he'd almost…
Perhaps this was a mistake. Cas had known Dean would slow him down. But he’d been so insistent. Dean had never once asked to go with him before. Never asked him to stay. “We’re in Los Angeles,” he said, half-listening to Dean, half-focusing on the prayers of the faithful and faithless combined. “There is talk of a cursed object reaping human souls. A pendant of sorts. I came here to destroy it. That man,” Cas give a none-too-gentle kick to the man’s good leg,” just happened to be in the way.”
Castiel scowled at himself. Still, he reached out and took Dean’s hand in his own, allowing the hunter to pull him to his feet. Castiel slackened his fingers but Dean didn’t let go immediately. The angel looked anywhere but at the beautiful man in front of him. He couldn’t do this. He couldn’t want this. Couldn’t allow himself to pretend that he was wanted in return.
When the witch was close enough, Dean threw himself across the wooden table, pulling the witch’s auburn locks and slamming her head down on the hard surface.
Was Dean his… boyfriend? His partner? Cas ran through the terms he’d learned from Sam and Dean throughout the years. “Fuck buddy” was a favourite of Dean’s. They were, of course, friends who had fornicated, but the term lacked a certain significance.
This place was evil. Terrible things must have happened here if the witches saw fit to keep the Soldiers of Heaven from their doorstep. Castiel wondered which of his siblings had prompted the banishment. If one of them had come here long ago to bring an end to their reign.
“Don’t go anywhere,” Dean winked. He rolled his shoulders, taking a quick stretch. He tapped his younger brother’s arm, directing him along a straight path between the graves. The moonlight shone on the chalk-coloured pavement, highlighting the weeds and nettles that grew through the cracks.
Dean didn’t have the chance to finish kissing his way to Cas’ earlobe before Cas had him pinned again, both of Dean’s hands trapped above his head. Cas looked at him earnestly, as if asking for permission, before kissing Dean again. Fuck, Cas was so fucking good for him. The first brush of Cas’ tongue along Dean’s lips had his hips grind upward, desperately seeking contact.
Dean struggles between two truths: how he feels for Cas, and how he feels about himself. Cas reaches a breaking point, but things don't go as planned with the case.
“It is Halloween,” that deep voice intoned seriously. His expression fell into a small frown that knit between his brows. “You don’t like Halloween?” He actually sounded concerned.
Dean heard those words as clear as day; a temporary reprieve from the chaos in his mind. He saw the tilt of the angel’s head as he said those words the day they’d met. Wide blue eyes staring at him like they had no idea what a despicable creature he really was.
The angel looked down at a small pile of crumbs on the table, smiling grimly at an old memory of his own. Perhaps it was time he shared this one selfish indulgence he’d acted on several years back. It had been in the early days of their friendship, when perhaps even “allies” was too strong a description for them.
He thought of calling Charlie. She always got him. He had a feeling she’d known about this even before he’d really known, himself. She hadn’t even met the guy yet, but the way she looked at Dean when he talked about Cas…
Dean didn’t pause to question it. The moment Meg turned her attention to a shrieking Rowena, he threw his blade with every bit of strength he could gather. It stuck true, right in the centre of the blonde witch’s throat.
Cat in one hand and the leather spell book in the other, Dean raced from the building. The witches were dead, he told himself. The museum abandoned. It was a small mercy there hadn’t been any fire alarms. There was no way anyone was going to see this mess, he decided. It could wait until morning. Then he’d have some heavy lifting to do.
Dean raised his palms in an exaggerated shrug, painted that adorable smile that had sprung him from a couple tight spots and earned him his fair score of chicks. Not that the latter had anything to do with this but-
Dean tore the sheets from both single beds and draped them over Cas to keep him warm. Ignoring the images of bodies wrapped in white sheets flashing through his head. Bodies on a pyre. Everyone he cared about – everyone he loved.
Unfurling the paper ball he’d snatched, Dean cleared his throat much louder than necessary and began to read in the highest, most obnoxious octave he could manage.
He’d thought it the worst possible feeling to compress his true form into the body of a twenty-one-year-old devout Religious Studies student named Jimmy Novak, but sleepless nights and passing days only served to prove him wrong.
Cas shivered, altering the dream. The transition was smooth; the grass became freshly mowed and flowers of every colour sprung from the earth, their petals gently disturbed by a warm breeze. The sound of chirping birds and rippling water, zen and peaceful, had Dean’s shoulders relax.
"Good," Dean kissed him, slow and deep until he ran out of breath - a problem Cas never seemed to have. He filed that information away for later. "We'll take it slow, alright? First few times are for practise."
Just as he thought the day couldn’t get any worse, some douchebag kid knocked into him. Dean yelled at him to watch it before he noticed that the asshole had stolen his abandoned duffle bag.
Dean thanked Sam. Told him to keep his head in the books and let him know if he finds anything else. He didn’t bother to guess when he and Cas would be home again - couldn't allow himself the luxury of assuming they'd come home safe at all. But Dean promised to call Sam if anything came up, rolling his eyes in mock annoyance at Sammy's concern. Then he hung up with the weirdest feeling like he was lying to his brother.
The girl was gorgeous. Long brown hair, brown eyes to match. There was nothing clean about what they’d done in that shower. Images flashed through his mind as Dean cleaned himself off. His hands lingering in places, remembering exactly where the girl had touched him.
Cas let out a noise that was somewhere between a laugh and a groan. “I have done some research,” he said matter-of-factly. His eyes wide and innocent, the energy between them anything but.
Castiel was an angel of the lord. He had his orders – had sworn his silence. His alliance fell with Heaven. To
The angel’s eyes met Dean’s and Dean felt like a friggin’ guilty teenager or some shit. Hands restless, shifting on his feet. His palms were not sweating. Hell no.
He’d just finished buttoning the cuff of his shirt sleeve when the bathroom door opened. Dean smiled - a faint, vulnerable little smile. He couldn’t help it. Cas looked good. Freshly shaved, his new tie loose around his neck.
Dean blinked as the angel circled him, inspecting him for unseen injuries. “Uh, nothing. Fell,” he added quickly. Castiel forced himself to ignore the pointed look between the brothers.
At 4.30pm, Dean emerged from his bedroom dressed in fresh clothes and smelling particularly un-Dean-like. Cas’ mouth went dry, his head tilting as he followed Dean’s movement. Dean’s hair had grown out slightly longer, small tendrils falling over his forehead out of the careful mess he’d created on top.
Images flashed behind Dean’s eyes; of Cas pulling him close, only to push him away at the last second. The Empty tearing Cas away with a smile on his face. Dean blinked hard, and Cas was in front of him; his bedhead glorious, the top buttons of his white shirt open, and his tie as maddeningly backward as always. Fuck. Cas was here and the dork looked damn good, and he was… Cas was looking at him like Dean had grown a second head.
Dean groaned. The sound low and rumbling in his chest, drowned out by the noise of the shower. He leaned against the cool tiled wall, burying his face in the crook of his elbow. Worked himself slow and easy at first. Then harder. Faster. His breathing ragged, the water pounding off his back, trickling down between his lashes. Harder. Dean nipped at the skin on his arm, biting hard as pleasure built and built, rising in waves.
“Shut up with the stereotypes, Sammy.” Turns out it’s pretty fucking hard to glare at someone when your stupid eyes are leaking. “And I’m not gay-gay. I’m bi.
Dean hefted both of their bagged suits higher, careful they didn’t trail along the pavement. He sidestepped a group of kids, noticing two little dudes among them holding hands. They had to be about fifteen, sixteen tops. They looked at each other with big moony eyes and dumb smiles, purposefully knocking into the other’s side. Right there, in broad daylight. In front of everyone.
Charlie frowned, and Dean offered her an earbud; his eyes razor focused on the screen. It was his voice Charlie heard when she put it in her ear.
Charlie lifted her head from Stevie’s shoulder, squeezing her arm in equal parts excitement and nerves. “Take my card and get the bill, I’ll start the car,” she said, just as the waiter finally arrived to take their empty glasses.
Dean tried to swear, but nothing came out. He slammed his fist on the table just to prove he could do something; to remind himself he was still in his body. That it was his own. That he was free to do whatever the fuck he wanted.
After a moment’s deliberation, Cas left and returned with a plate of leftover pizza and a large glass of water. He set both within Dean’s reach, noting with an ache in his chest the opened bottle of whiskey and undrunk glass discarded at the centre of the table.
Dean slid into the front seat of the Impala, Cas only moments behind him in the passenger seat. Dean tugged the angel by the sleeve, hurrying him inside. He had no doubt those assholes were watching them on camera. If he and Cas had any luck on their side, they’ll have made it to the one blind spot in the Bunker they wouldn’t reach on foot without giving themselves away.
“Alright, well you know who to ask if you change your mind,” the dude said with a wink. “What can I get for you guys?”
Stuffing his hands in his pockets, Dean sighed and began to follow the path his brother had taken. Already feeling sorry for himself, Dean hoped Bobby, at least, would be happy to see him.
The soft vibration of his cellular phone had Cas carefully sitting up. Without waking Dean, Cas found the device at the foot of the bed and silently crept to the hallway to answer.
Dean was silent, his heartbeat pounding like a drum in his ears. Sure, he didn’t have the first fucking idea how he felt for Cas. Not until… when, exactly? He’d been pushing this shit deep down inside him for so long, it was like this thing with Cas was at the very core of him. Would he have kissed Cas a year ago? A week ago? This morning? If he hadn’t almost lost the guy…
Dean’s older brother instincts kicked in then, hearing the poorly hidden sadness in Sam’s tone. “Damn right I did. I, uh… it took a while, y’know. To figure it out. Kinda figured I could just bury it but, well. Shit don’t seem to stay buried in this family.”
Cas frowned. “As opposed to a baby named Michael, or John, or Jack?” He caught the visible flinch from both boys at the second name and frowned.
It was against Heaven’s orders to reveal what he was to a human, but if the brothers couldn’t get out of there fast enough...
Dean stared Sam down, tilting his head ever so slightly in Cas’ direction. Sam frowned, looking between Dean and Castiel, who still stood rooted in the doorway, blue eyes wide in terror and his hand outstretched toward them. Somewhere in the darkness, that damn black cat hissed again.
Dean pointed the gun at the demon’s heart. “Thought her name was Karla,” he said, such venom in his voice.
Dean cocked the gun, but this time the demon was ready. She moved aside, too fast for Dean to track.
Cas blinked back the unwelcome images of his failures. He stepped back, motioned for Dean to follow him to the opening of the alley. Felt more than saw Dean reach for a weapon that wasn’t there. Sensed when Dean’s hearing picked up on the footsteps; too quick to be casual. But Dean would not hear the hammering of the woman’s heart.
He scribbled out the “Dear,” and stared at the page for several long minutes, fighting the temptation to bunch it up in his fist and set it on fire like he’d meant to. He breathed. He tried again.
Cas moved to the bathroom, pausing for a moment, an eternity, by the door. With a small, shaking breath, he entered. He avoided looking directly at the shower. Everything was in place, besides Dean’s t-shirt strewn over the towel rack. Nothing unholy, nothing to feel guilty about. He switched on the taps and began scrubbing at his hands, watching with unease as the blood swirled down the drain of the sink.
Dean’s heart raced. Shit. He scratched the back of his head, grossed out by the dampness. This place was disgusting, man. It had no business being this swampy. “Nah, I’m good,” he said, avoiding the point with a damn wide berth. “M’hungry, too. Let’s go some place that does food. The fancy kind,” he added, letting a hit of excitement wash over him.
Cas heard the hitch in his breathing. Noticed the slight trembling in Dean's fingers. Dean had lost too much blood – would pass out at any moment.
Charlie mumbled something unintelligible against her girlfriend’s neck. Neither of them keen to let go. Sometimes, Charlie couldn’t help but reach for her, even when they’d spent all week together. She knew it would probably take a while, and several years of careful lies in therapy, for things to balance out after everything that happened. But in the meantime, casual reassurances that her girl wasn’t going to get zapped again counted as totally normal behaviour.
Dean pulled Cas’ arm around himself and settled himself in the crook of Cas’ shoulder. “This okay?” His voice was delicate. Hopeful.
Dean didn’t hear the music, didn’t hear whatever shit Rowena said as the ceremony began, didn’t notice that every one of those bastards outside now filled the Roadhouse.
Dean had faced the devil himself, but somehow saying three stupid little words to the best friend he’d ever had, felt like higher stakes.
An hour later, Dean waited at the bottom of the stairs dressed in dark blue jeans and a black shirt, toying with the best cowboy hat he could find in this town on short notice. One day, he vowed, he’d own the real thing. Spurred boots and everything.
“I don’t know about you, man, but I’m gonna need a shower.” When Cas didn’t respond, he clarified, “Hotel. We need a room. Somewhere to leave our crap while we go wherever Angel Radio takes us.”
Dean's heart stumbled. "You're hot when you curse, you know that?" He kissed along Cas' cheeks again, coming to stop at his mouth. "Say it again," he murmured against Cas' lips.
Cas rolled his eyes. Filtering through Angel Radio was no easy task around this overgrown toddler. Deciphering prayers in a city that prided itself on sin was another feat entirely. But not impossible.
It was rare that Dean saw Cas without his coat. Even with his old suit on, Dean supposed the guy seemed practically naked now. He looked good – made Dean look like crap next to him, honestly.
Things had been good. Real fucking good. But tonight, no matter what sexy distractions he cooked up for them both, his mind kept casting back to that night in the kitchen when Cas had told him how he’d confronted John. Okay, that was a pretty tame way to put it – the dude had fucking beat the bastard for shit he probably hadn’t even done yet at that point. He’d done it all for Dean.
“So, stay with me,” Dean continued, recalling the words he’d whispered into the angels neck the morning he’d proposed. “Stay with me, Cas. You are my family. You are…” Dean swallowed the lump in his throat, his emerald eyes threatening to spill over. Certain he wasn’t making any sense. “Stay with me.”
It was a privileged kind of pain to know the feel of lips that had forgotten your own. The feel of hands you cannot hold outside of danger and death. To be one half of something so whole and carry the sweetest memories alone. It truly didn’t matter to Cas if Dean never thought him more than a friend. Cas knew, on a level that humans might consider soul-deep, that he and Dean could never be strangers to one another. There was no going back once he’d seen a soul like Dean’s.
Cas stepped out of the dream and back into a reality where Dean now lay on his side, facing the opposite direction. Here, Cas couldn’t wrap his arm around Dean’s shoulders. Couldn’t alter the whole world to keep him safe and smiling.
Dean shrugged. “No, man, you didn’t – that’s not,” Dean paused, reaching out and toying with the package of salt. That was something else the angel had picked up on; Dean fidgeted when he felt exposed or nervous. He had such confidence, and yet the truth of him lay hidden in plain sight.
With every moment that Dean did not pull away, didn’t sink into the fear and guilt and regret that still lay just on the other side of dormant in his soul, Cas was grateful. Though this was all so new, each touch still a test in the waters of what would yet be, Cas knew Dean well enough not to say thank you for allowing this. For wanting this – wanting Cas. Cas knew he’d laugh it off, or tease him, or shut down the vulnerability in some way.
Cas broke the man’s arm in one swift blow. Knocked him unconscious and flew him to some half-abandoned part of the country. Without his weapons. Without the memory or impulse to do what he’d planned to do.
“Wasn’t expecting company,” Dean said, flipping the knife now in his hand. He glowered at a smirking Karla. “The more the merrier.”
He fought against the rising panic. Tried to clear his head. But all that he could hear was the whisper of his name from Cas’ lips. That soft plea.
Blue eyes nodded slowly. “I’m sure that would be pleasant. This town is very beautiful this time of year.”
“Told ya, you can stay as long as you want.” Bobby gently patted Dean on the cheek until he was forced to look the older man in the eye. “You come here by yourself?”
For the first time in so long, Cas prayed to his father. To the angels – to anyone who would listen and save Dean Winchester in his stead.
“I mean, come on, guys,” Sam leaned against the doorway. He took up the entire frame. “It’s about time. How long's this been going on for?”
Sam took a seat next to Eileen, pressing a kiss to the side of her head and pulling her laptop between them. “Missed my girl,” he said, smiling as Eileen ripped her mug of tea out of his grasp. Sam returned his attention to Dean and said, “Where’s Cas?”
"I love you, you dorky, devastatingly handsome husband of mine,” Dean laughed quietly, green eyes blazing.
to the guy if he ever even thought- No. Cas deserved better than him. But why did he have to look at Dean like that? Like he was worthy. Like he mattered.
Dean had never hated himself as much as he did right now. But there was not a version of this world where he’d regret what he'd just done with Cas.
Cas smiled timidly back at him. The guy was a little breathless, and Dean tracked the movement as Cas loosened his tie.
There was plenty he wasn’t telling Sam, but something about this trip – it felt big. Bigger than demons and souls and all that shit.
“I’m gonna kick your dad’s ass someday, too,” Dean said, quietly this time. As though if he spoke softly enough, the secret would be beyond the reach of Chuck’s ears. “And I’m not gonna regret it one bit either.”
Cas looked around the room. He thought of the movies he’d watched, and still came up short. The room was quiet. Typically, dates had music. He suggested as much, and was met with eager, almost overly-enthusiastic nods.
He felt the girl’s hands on his legs, his ass, as she sucked him. Pictured those brown eyes staring up at him, dark hair soaking wet and spilling down her back. He panted, free hand squeezing into a fist. Release was close.
Dean pushed the cart toward one of the single beds in the corner of the room. The mattress was rock solid beneath his ass compared to the comfort of the king, but… well, he didn’t want to consider the implications of that bed right now. He reached for a plate and stuffed a handful of fries in his mouth, chewing loudly and immediately feeling a little better.
Dean looked back to the doorway, saw another five approaching. It killed him to turn away from the fight, to let these bastards live another day, but… Cas.
All the brightest parts of Dean Winchester were the loudest. The rage, the self-loathing – those were quiet, seething things. But the colours of his soul, his unintended prayers, his physical form. Those screamed beauty to Castiel.
Those were the words Dean had hated most. The hypocrisy of them. Dean had tried to say those words he’d been building to say for years in Purgatory. But Cas had stopped him. Of course, Dean knew why.
Dean had no healing gifts. He had nothing to offer the angel at his side but what little faith he had to give.
“Look, you wouldn’t get it, alright? It’s not that simple,” Dean argued, trying real damn hard to keep his voice from cracking. Sammy had no damn idea what he was talking about.
“They say the bones of a hundred children reside within these walls,” Castiel offered, inspecting the mossy stone with the tips of his fingers.
“Right,” he lied quickly. “It’s all just a bunch of hocus pocus crap. So, uh. The name’s Dean, by the way. I just got into town. Staying with my uncle for a couple days. Would be nice to, y’know, have someone to show me around. Go for coffee or something.”
Dean stumbled back, staring at his blackened hands in horror. He took a deep, shaking breath. Wiped his eyes on the one clean patch of his ruined shirt.
The squeak of a mattress sounded on Sam’s end of the line. “I couldn’t find a spell or demon with the kind of power to make that sort of thing, but it seems like witches, don’t you think?”
“What the hell?!” He rested his forehead against the door, pounding his fist against it. He didn’t stop until a familiar voice behind him spoke, freezing him in his tracks.
Sometimes Cas wished he could turn it off. Right now, this was exactly where he wanted to be. And the last place should be.
The demon was damn fast. She twisted his arm until the knife dropped to the floor, and promptly pinned him hard against the wall, hand fisted in the short strands of his hair. Dean's vision blurred. He felt the trickle of blood run from the side of his head from the impact. Shit.
He didn’t know how the fuck it had gone this wrong so fast. But there was Cas, stuck in an angel trap, powered down and staring up at Dean with real fear in his eyes.
“Are you just collecting people named Cas at this point?” Sam grumbled at Dean. The asshole saw his chance for revenge and took it. Dean had to respect it, but right now all he could do was knock the cap off Sam’s head and pray the kid didn’t blow this for him. Besides, Cassie was history. Or rather, Dean was history to her. Either way, he screwed up and moved away and, last he checked, she’d moved on.
Cas’ smile lingered. He’d missed Charlie. Stevie didn’t come around very often because of her new job, and she and Charlie had been spending every spare moment they could together since… since they’d been lost to one another.
Cas tore his gaze from the dead woman, his attention locking on Dean. Dean, who was bleeding heavily from his shoulder. Only the dark fabric of his new blazer hid the extent of the injury, but Cas noticed the blood that dripped to the floor. He squinted, relieved when he noted that the bullet had fully passed through Dean’s body and out the other side.
