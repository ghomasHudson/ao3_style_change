None of these really explain the enormity of his feelings on it, they never could.

I don’t understand much about the mechanics of it, but it seems like it stores an armor inside. It’s not really stuck in his chest like the one he had before, it’s detachable.”
“It’s not the same.” Natasha shakes her head, her tone not relieved, just confused. “I was trying to find a pattern, but it keeps falling apart.

And that’s when Tony Stark shows up unannounced, of course.
For a second, Tony fears he has made a mistake, because Thor’s expression closes off tightly, a dark cloud of worry and sadness looming over him; the memory painful, obviously, and Tony nearly apologizes for even bringing it up when that same tender, leveled yet still wistful smile returns to his face.

“Will I agree with them, T’Challa?” Steve asks - as a taunt, as a legitimate concern, he isn’t sure. But he must ask. “You know why I refuse to sign them. Tell me. If I read them, as they are, will I sign them?”
It’s… very specific. It’s something so old he barely remembers it – even though he knows it happened just a few years ago, it feels so much older, so long ago in time -, but the vision of a

“If you say you are, I’ll back off.” Steve promises him, because he has nothing else to offer, really. This is a losing battle. He knows it. Usually, he would fight tooth and nail until the bitter end, until blood flooded his mouth and his body ached with cuts and wounds, but this is not a battlefield, and Tony is not an enemy.

The phrasing is a little distasteful, maybe. It certainly leaves a somewhat dry feeling in his mouth, like he’s just swallowed chalk; But it seems like it’s just him, because no one else reacts as if it sounded as bad as it felt. It’s a temporary divide, Tony should keep in mind. It’s to make it faster. They’ll come back. And so will Nebula and Rocket, and then, they’ll fit all the pieces together and they’ll make this right. That’s all it is.

Arnim Zola behaved well, the files reported. Willing to cooperate, obliging, and – dare they say? – trustworthy. An amazing change for a man who once stood by the side of the infamous Red Skull.
“You know you can talk to me, right?” Steve asks gently, laying a hand on her bicep as softly as he can, making sure the gesture is so slow she could’ve easily swatted his hand away if she wished to. “If something’s bothering you.”

Pepper, we're reaching the end of your arc. Not quite there yet, but soon. And together with some plot, we'll transition from her piece to the next one in line, a special arc that's going to include more than one character at once. You'll see what I mean when we get there.
But then again, who would go looking for him inside the country he’d just fled?
From personal experience.
Maybe that’s the only thing he truly wants now. The only thing that keeps him going. He could make an argument that’s not just that – he’d do it for Pepper, he’d come back for her so they can try again once it’s all over, because he loves her and he does want to marry her, even with all their flaws; or maybe he can say he’ll do it just because it’s the right thing to do, because no one deserved to fall victim to the workings of a guy like Thanos, and as a hero, it is his duty, his

Beyond these walls, half the universe is gone.
“I did it for both.” Steve explains. “Or I thought I did. I was just sparing myself in the end.”
Shit.

It doesn’t surprise him.
“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.” Rogers cuts in, firmly. “But we really need an answer, Wong. You heard what they said. They’re willing to try, and so are we. Can you help us find out more about the Stones to make sure we can fight this guy?”
” Tony says, firmly. “We need to find a way to bring back everything Thanos took.”
Anything that makes sense.
“You know why.” It’s what he chooses to say. It’s the coward’s way out, he knows, but he takes it anyway. It’s not like it isn’t true. T’Challa knows. He knows why Steve is so damn worried about this. There is no need for the group therapy – Steve is not willing, nor strong enough for this right now.
Tony knows that. He knows that better than anyone.
“What?” Pepper frowns, exasperated.

This is his goodbye. Clint says his and hangs up, and Steve is left in a dark, empty room with only the sound of the breeze outside for company, the slowly rising rays of the sun, and the terrible,

“The Ant-Man suit is not government property.” Vision explains, continuing his line of logic with this new information he has just received. “It has been designed by and still belongs to Pym Technologies - to Dr. Hank Pym, to be more precise. Being so, Dr. Pym is Mr. Lang’s primary benefactor. Without the original suit, Dr. Pym would have to provide a new one to Mr. Lang, for him to be able to continue to pose as Ant-Man. Unfortunately, Pym Technologies has publicly declared they no longer will have any association with Mr. Lang.”
Tony belatedly wonders if there are other planets out there who are suffering from the same thing they are now. If they are decaying like Earth is, or by something else, or if there’s any other left by now. They have no way of knowing. Almost four billion in their planet only – but how many more out there? How many trillions, quadrillions – if there’s any way to even count them all?

Vision watches him put some distance between them, a look that can almost be described as uneasy on his face, when Wanda steps a little closer and puts her hand on his arm, leaning forward so she can whisper something right by his ear. Her voice is so low and so soft not even Steve can hear what she says, even with his enhanced hearing.

Consequences rarely disappear just because you're not looking at them.

A tear. Two.
Overwhelmed, Tony pushes himself up by his elbows, even if it stings on his abdomen, and finds a position with enough stability so he can sit up without removing his hand from hers for as long as he can. But it’s inevitable. As soon as he can lean against the headboard as well, he opens his arms and she falls into him, they both drawn against the hold of one another, and she fits her head against his shoulder and sighs in a tight, shuddering breath, enveloping him in a careful hug, and he feels the tension is her from the way her arms tighten and flex even as they stay gentle around him, the twitch in her muscles, the anxiety that brews silently within.

Caution makes him handle his thoughts a bit more gently.

“It’s not really a wild assumption to make, Tony.” Steve points out, and that inexplicably hurts far more than it should.
“I think we should go to Wakanda.” Steve tells her, immediately, and his tone comes off as a bit more rushed than he intended; But the jitters are driving him crazy. He takes off the communicator from his pocket and shows it to Natasha, as an explanation. “King T’Challa contacted me.”
Steve feels something inside of himself roar with rage, and he sidesteps Sam so he can stand in front of Natasha, using all of his height to his advantage, making sure that she can see in his posture that he will

They don’t have anywhere to go, actually, but they do take a few steps aimlessly, putting in some more distance between Wanda and themselves. It’s not really necessary, but Steve is feeling restless,
I'm sure you all have heard the news. The past few days have been rough on everyone, some more than others, but we have all, in one way or another, felt a terrible loss after the news broke out. I myself had a hard time wrapping my head around it in the first few days, and this chapter was supposed to be done in that same night, but I just needed to take a moment to process everything and make sure I was okay - and I hope, from the bottom of my heart, all of you were able to do the same, to some degree. Even now, I admit I'm not happy with this chapter, and it might undergo some editing in the future, but for now, I just needed to get it out and maybe provide us all with something else to think about, even if just for a short while.
It’s a fitting name.
It's finally time for us to discuss the so infamous subject of guilt. How it ties up with responsibility, which Steve is so fond of, and finally discuss the thing that bothers me the most and everyone refuses to acknowledge: how guilt and responsibility impact Wanda's and Bucky's personal identities and sense of self, and how exactly have they (or HAVEN'T they) dealt with it so far, because of Steve's overbearing nature and refusal to allow them to deal with it. But we won't be unfair. Let's bring out some of the skeletons in Steve's closet too, how about that? Because there are a few that I haven't seen a lot of people talk about - and there is one tiny little detail I feel like its important to bring up, a detail that some of you might be already acquainted with, maybe from some Anti-Cap speeches and some bitter Tony stans around the internet, but it is a detail founded on truth. And it only makes this whole thing a hell lot worse.

“Is that your team?” Nebula asks, mutedly, and Tony whips around fast, completely ignoring his own warnings; And now, instead of hurting on his side, he hurts on his neck, when a muscle pulls too tight and stings all the way up to his brain.
What matters is that you didn’t
“He is under the impression that the sample of Captain America’s blood was lost when he was under Dr. Fennhoff’s control.” He says as an explanation.
He doesn’t need to go far. Bruce is right next to Thor, watching Tony, wearing baggy clothes and looking like he’s been put in a blender and left there for hours.
“No.” Steve breathes out, forcing himself to drop his shoulders form his incredibly tense position, uselessly hoping that will help to ease the knots of discomfort that have formed on his back. “He decided to stay.”
” Tony says, and it hurts him as much as it hurts Thor, he can see it, he can feel it in his own heart. The words hit them both like a punch, Tony swaying in place just as Thor’s jaw locks down tight and hard, hand squeezing around the handle of his axe, and that reactions echo so deep into Tony’s body that he unconsciously softens his voice, looks down, and feels bad for it. Feels bad for saying it out loud when they all are so clearly trying not to say it, to ignore it, to force themselves through it.
“Tony?” Rhodey asks, and it sounds like he’s coming from miles and miles away. “What do you see?”
“The hospital isn’t far away.” Rhodey barks, angry, although Tony isn’t sure if he’s angry at Natasha, at himself, or at the smoke. “We can’t stop in the middle of the way.”
“Sorry, I kind of panicked. I saw the ship and, uh—” Lang stutters, raising his hands in a defensive gesture and looking quickly between Nebula and Rocket, which is admittedly difficult, considering the height difference. “I thought they were aliens.”
“Partially.” Vision concedes. “Mr. Lang has no previous history of destruction of property in large scale, and none in international scale. And as he is also not associated with the Avengers Initiative, he has no formal obligation to be a part of international operations in the future; Which means that most of what the Sokovia Accords entail does not actually apply to him.”

, no matter how many times they have fought over these exact words. And despite Pepper’s insistence that Tony shouldn’t chase Thanos as a way to fix this – Tony knows, that deep inside, she understands.
She takes in a deep breath and looks up, as if gathering her thoughts. “Well, the R&D boys are… concerned. I gave them access to all workspaces and they’re working hard, but they’re worried they’re not gonna be fast enough with the filters.”

“Is he staying here?”
Vision isn’t here, JARVIS isn’there, Ultron isn’t here. If this is all meant to be ironic, Tony fails to see the humor in it. Such an awful coincidence. Or maybe it’s not. A coincidence, he means. Maybe it’s not. There is some odd pain attached to it, some sense of hollowness he can’t explain, not sharp like before, when he first lost JARVIS, but no less present; Like it’s an old wound, that only hurts from time to time, beneath the scarred tissue. Tony has many of those, some more visible than others, but the origin of this one is strange.

(He’d thought all that time for reflection had dissipated some of this bitterness.)
They never caught him, did they? He had been exactly where he wanted to be.
Tony had learned many lessons in his years. He learned them with Afghanistan, with Obie, with the Palladium, with Killian.
“So… We have to be fast, but not too fast, or else I die all the same. Fun.” Tony goes for a joking tone, and he very nearly succeeds, but he injects too much exasperation into it, at it makes him sound hysterical.  “Can we do that? A happy middle ground?”

and shifts on her seat, turning her body to face Clint, her face incredulous.
“We’ll probably have to divide in groups—” Thor is saying, and Tony realizes he lost a chunk of the conversation, lost in his own thoughts for who knows how long, his focus still blurred and difficult to listen to the exchange before him with his full attention.
That gets her looking up. But she still doesn’t move.

(You thought it would be fine.)
He goes there as casually as possible when he realizes Tony’s in, firing his repulsors at the training dummies in quick, agile motions, with the ease only a practiced fighter can have. Steve would stop and watch him for a few moments if he could, but that would be creepy, and he’s there on a mission; He doesn’t have time to dally before going to one of the available lanes and taking his shield in hand, ready to sling it at his target.

Steve frowns, but does.
Nebula doesn’t react, her body completely stiff, but her eyes dart quickly to the distance and back, as if she’s silently connecting the dots.

in some part; Because the serum, even the bad one Bruce took, was meant only to enhance what was already inside, good or bad. It must be scary, to know what the rage you keep locked inside of you can do. Tony doesn’t even know where the rage comes from – it wouldn’t have been right to ask. It’s not his business. But it is Bruce, in a way, because it’s his body and, in some levels, his brain – and the experience is shared by them both, being seen and being judged, having their actions scrutinized with barely any mercy even when they are not fully in control.
“Can’t kill me that easily, sour-patch.” Tony jokes, and if he sounds like he is about to cry, that’s because he

The stress is so high Tony would twitch in place if he wasn’t flying, stabilized by his armor. He gets jitters when he’s this nervous. He wants to go in, because he’s far away enough that he can’t see the actual damage, but he’s waiting on some visuals from Natasha and Nebula to make sure they won’t cause any sort of damage while doing in, like accidentally causing it to slide and jam deeper into the building over, also toppling it.

this is what Tony cares about. Because this is what hurts his damned feelings.
When. When had Barton thought better of him? At the Raft, when he spit at the sight of Tony and called him a backstabber, even though he literally broke a promise to his wife and children to help Rogers in a fight he had no business starting anyway? Had Barton thought better of him when he accepted the help of SI’s legal team when his sentence was being discussed after he signed the plea nearly eighteen months after his escape from the Raft, but not once sent Tony a message after his sentence got passed, or even reduced to mere house arrest, instead retreating to his little hideaway as if nothing had happened?

It’s the first time in all his life there’s no chronic pain aching in his weak muscles as he inhales, the air going in and out his lungs with the force of a motor, through airways completely unobstructed, so much oxygen it nearly makes his head spin. It’s overwhelming. He almost sighs with the sensation, a pleasant feeling that manifests itself like a tingling in his limbs and spine, completely erasing the scorching pain he’d been in when the machine started to activate the serum in is veins. He feels no pain now. He only feels
“You want two aliens and a scientist with no Hulk walking around the massive mob with torches for no reason?” Clint asks, in a sarcastic tone.

There is no sunlight to illuminate him like a vision from the skies, there is no song, there is no major revelation in the air – not beyond Steve’s own, quiet, invisible, the string inside his chest that somehow snaps itself against his will, like a curtain has been lifted before his eyes and he can finally see clearly, despite the fog of ash surrounding them and the cold, dark embrace of a night that comes much earlier than it should.
But they keep screwing it up somehow!
“And play it safe?” Sam inquires, disbelieving. “You think that will be enough?”
The warmth of the rich wine offered to him has settled so deep into his bones he feels like he could be protected from the blizzards and snow forever, the heat of the pyre pleasant from where they sit, and his husband—
“I know.” Steve says, but no more than that. Anything else would be a lie. Anything else would be
It’s probably not the time it should be getting darker. Tony honestly can’t tell. The clouds closer to the horizon are turning almost black as the sky goes dark, the dim light that weakly illuminated the world fading as if slowly being hidden behind heavy curtains, a slow descent into oppressing shade, and there they stand, in the open, exposed, being swallowed by ice and ash.
Ross looks at him for a long, very uncomfortable second. “Why? You worried for Rogers, is that it?”
Maybe he should stop. He doesn’t know. Maybe. That would be the sensible thing to do, right?
“From every other domestic hero working alone out there. There was a motion for it to become a register of every active superhero, but it never passed. It remained what it was supposed to be – a work contract. We would report back to the UN and have regular debriefs to make sure we were meeting all the regulations and deadlines, and a whole lot of people would have slept better knowing an armed American team wouldn’t invade their lands and raise hell over their heads in the middle of the night.

The plane also is unable to be moved because of the building it was still holding up. So, they moved to the building next.
Natasha pauses for a second, in front of the console. Then, she picks up the keyboard and starts typing, without turning around to look Steve in the eye.

Tony looks at these bodies and he sees the first fire of many, the first explosion in God knows how many more across the country, across the world, from crashes and accidents no one ever came to rescue because the rescue died, or fled, scared for their own safety and their own families.

He thinks of the night that Mark 42 responded to his distress in his sleep and attacked Pepper, and she left – and the argument they had over it not too soon after.
“You got any water we can throw at them?” Rocket suggests. “It’ll get rid of the torches.”
“I don’t know if the Stone itself is looking for something or if it just follows the orders of whoever holds it.” Natasha shrugs, forlorn. “There’s not enough information to prove either option. If they are defending themselves it would explain why they sometimes try to kill their hosts, but that doesn’t explain Vision.”
And just like that, as the Jet hovers over the White House, Steve Rogers just

Steve nods, looking down. He knows that Sam approaches more from the sound of his footsteps than by his vision, but even so, he doesn’t turn around. The horizon gives him no answers, but Steve keeps looking for them anyway.
“No matter what his choice is going to be, he needs to choose. And he needs to do it alone.” She says, a bit regretful, as if she is not very happy about this either. “Your presence makes him feel obligated to act like you expect him to. Because he owes you, not because that’s how he really feels.”

It’s jarring the sensation of stepping into a room through a portal, to leave the clean, cold, metallic smell of the workshop to enter the slightly stuffy, oak scent of the New York Sanctum, the lighting completely different and the very air in the room dustier and harder to inhale, thanks to the hole on the ceiling that so easily allows the dirt and ashes trickle in through the wind. Tony’s shoes make footprints when he walks, the ground covered in a sheen layer of ash that is scary to look at, to know what it means, and Tony avoids it firmly by keeping his eyes leveled with Wong’s, even as he steps forward and hears the others, more reluctantly, follow him through the glowing orange portal.
“That’s enough.” Rogers interrupts, stepping forward so he can stand somewhat in between Barton and Tony. “We’re a team—"
Thor looks back, his face a deep mix of confused and appalled.
And it had been the truth.

And Tony turns and runs, runs, runs—
She makes an annoyed click with her tongue, shaking her head minutely and raising her shoulders in a tense position. Steve can see that there’s an entire conversation going on inside her head, a struggle for what to say next, or if she should say anything at all; And Steve looks at her face and waits like a miserable soul, as if he was begging her not to break his heart.
It doesn’t matter if he knows what that’s like. To be second. To never live up to the favorite.
He looks to the side, where he remembers seeing a clock – yep, there it is, and it says 6:11 AM on it, which is unholy and vile, an hour no one should be awake at, much less a Saturday, and
(Confirmation.)
“Can you find him some water?” Nebula asks quietly to Dum-E as Tony sits down as ordered, looking at him expectantly.
Steve shrugs, stiff. “Just wanted to see how you were doing.”
“What should we follow?” Tony inquires, hoping Nebula, being the one who actually lived in space, would know something useful.
“Then I won’t stop you.” He repeats. "I can't blame you for wanting to be with him. You can go. We'll be close if you need us."
he’s using it.”
“And with the Stone, it went mad. As all things do. Ultron himself came from the Mind Stone, I’ve told you this.” Thor rebukes, annoyed, frustrated by Tony’s adamant arguing. “It was not your hand who made him vengeful.

“Seriously, I can get you some more. I know a place. You know, like, an art store. The best—”

not his therapist, and it’s not his job to take care of Tony’s pile of issues and traumas. That’s Tony’s problem, not anyone else’s. and it’s not cool of him to make Bruce uncomfortable just to avoid the conversations he doesn’t want to have. If Tony was a normal adult, he could simply talk about it without going irrationally emotional over it, or maybe he could respectfully ask to be left alone, and never address this again – but Tony is
“We also didn’t have permission to go to Sokovia when we found Strucker’s base.” Bruce says, but he doesn’t word it like a counter-argument – like the others would have.
Like Tony’s.
“Did any of you read the new ones?” Steve cuts the silence with a question so heavy, so difficult, that he might as well have taken out a gun and threatened them with it – because they all stare at him wide-eyed, open-mouthed, stunned by his bold inquiry; Or, maybe, incredulous of the so docile tone he uses when he does. “The Accords. T’Challa gave them to Scott. Did any of you ask him to read them?”
And in case anyone is wondering: what about Siberia? What about Bucky? Not going into that particular subject now, friends. Despite the reaction the mere mention of the Accords might inspire in you, looking closely, you will notice that there's actually not that many moments where the Accords conflict and the Bucky conflict truly overlap. I'm going to show you how. But don't worry. It'll come. We just have to make a quick visit to this particularly touchy topic before then. Before, you know, going into the subject that will for sure destroy us all.
His voice breaks the bubble Natasha and Barton had built around themselves, rips through it like a goddamned weapon, through the invisible wall of secrecy created by their proximity and the breathlessness of their whispers, by the very feel of heaviness in the air between them as they locked eyes. Natasha’s eyes are quick to snap to his, not quite surprised, but distraughtly vulnerable; While Barton, Jesus Christ,
, somehow.
And although Steve doesn’t exactly feel like he has the high ground to speak about rights and wrongs anymore, T’Challa’s words do bring a smile to his face, a sort of ironic humor, before he ignores the king’s easy dismissal and continues, “Thank you anyway. Clint really wanted to go back to his family.”
“Wanda, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I’m not one for having many safe ideas.

If nothing else, Wong looks the same. He’s serious, he’s poised, and his face gives nothing away, neither good or bad, and somehow, that is more distressing than Rogers’ grim face and locked jaw. The portal closes behind them and Tony doesn’t even find himself comfortable enough to look back and check if they are all here and everything is alright, focused on Wong’s fixed stare and impenetrable mask.

Like clockwork, Steve’s expression turns more serious. “Can we not do this now? At least… when it’s just the two of us?”
“Of course I did. It’s him.” Howard says, nonchalantly.
