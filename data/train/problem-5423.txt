Castiel's chest tightens as he tries to calm the war going on between his mind and his heart. He makes his usual choice and removes Dean's hand. Dean visibly becomes upset.
This time the hand he is strumming with slides down the strings for the last note and just falls against his lap as Dean stares at the floor, not moving for a while. Castiel wonders what he is thinking. He senses Dean is sad, the air in the room was thick with an ache. But why? Perhaps he is thinking of Lisa. Castiel is aware that he cared for her. But a sound that wrenches Castiel out of his thoughts reminds him that he is in the doorway behind Dean. He hears Dean sniffling and sees him wipe his hand down his face. Is Dean crying? All Castiel wants to do at this moment is hold Dean, but he knows Dean wouldn't be okay with that so he doesn’t. Dean moves finally to reach for the whiskey he has sat beside him, downs it and pours more. Castiel wonders if Dean would still drink as heavily, if at all, if they were together. If Dean knew just how much Castiel loved him. Would it be enough? Enough to cover up all the guilt and doubt that Dean feels. Enough to finally give Dean some peace. Would Dean even be able to accept it?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you really trying to pretend this is like your hookups?” Castiel snaps taken aback by Dean’s comparison.
?!” Dean shouts, interrupting Castiel. Castiel is taken aback causing him to struggle for the right things to say.
Later that night, Castiel has the same dream as before only it seems to be intensified and this time they are standing outside of the Impala. Dean and Castiel are standing in front of each other, looking into each other’s eyes again and Dean is communicating with Castiel without actually speaking. But this time as Dean pleads with Castiel for whatever it is that he needs from him that Dean never ends up actually sharing, Dean goes through different actions than before.
“Dean… we really can’t do more. You’re drunk and as much as it hurts to admit you would not do this sober. You will probably already struggle with this tomorrow. I just don’t want to make anything harder on you. Or to lose you altogether.” Castiel admits.
“I’ll never regret you Cas,” Dean says and clings tighter to Castiel. Castiel’s emotions are going wild now. It feels good but he has a hard time believing that when Dean sobers up he won’t freak out over this. Even if what he’s saying is true.
Songs for this chapter:
Catching Castiel off guard,
Some time passes and they are on their second Star Wars movie, about halfway through. Apparently, it was a marathon tonight. Castiel enjoyed this, he doesn’t think he’s ever seen Dean just hang out like this. It’s nice. Castiel notices the bed shift as Dean gets up, Dean grabbing his bottle of whiskey that is nearly gone on his way, swaying all over the place as he tries to keep his balance.
“Yeah, it’s something...Dad picked up on it. He’d caught me crushing on a guy back in high school. That was a huge fight. I messed around with a guy not too long after that and dad caught wind of it. He put me through hell for a long time after that. I never tried again.” Dean says sadly. Castiel can sense sorrow and resentment taking Dean over as Dean starts to bite his lip nervously, his hands coming up closer to his face as he starts to fidget with the ring he’s wearing.
“Yeah, in some ways you’re right, it has. But it’s strengthened my faith in us...in purpose.” Dean says thoughtfully.
Mild sexual content, barely.
“I’ve always liked it. The possibilities? Thinking about something bigger than myself and all my bullshit. Even though most of the time I had to go with the idea that there isn’t anything bigger. That obviously changed a bit when I met you though…” Dean starts to trail off clearly lost in thought. Castiel picks up a sense of fear coming over Dean to which he reacts quickly because being close to a Winchester means having to effectively maintain damage control.
“Listen, all I’m sayin’ Cas is that you don’t gotta play things up. We’re two men, right? We got needs. We’re together a lot because of work and we’re best friends. It just seems like it would make too much sense.” Dean says as he takes a drink. “Then neither of us would have to find random people, and we get the life. It’s just less hassle.” Dean concludes.
Music:
. “Of course Dean.” He smiles at Dean still kind of feeling a residual sadness because he knows that this is probably just due to Dean being drunk and Castiel’s presence brings him some comfort because he’s a constant...something he knows Dean would never admit. “Anything in particular you want? I’ll fly.” Castiel offers.
“Dude! You’re awesome! But you didn’t have to get all of this Cas, I’m probably not going to eat half of it. Thanks!” Dean says enthusiastically.
Heaven - Troye Sivan ft. Betty Who
“I don’t know. I just figured I’d offer to do anything that helps. Are you okay Dean? You seem...tired." Castiel settles for tired as he attempts to  stay in Dean's good graces, he knows Dean doesn’t like vulnerability.
Reason To Love - Our Last Night
“I really miss my mom. She always knew how to make me feel better.” Dean says quietly once again staring off somewhere past Castiel. Castiel can feel his heart drop. Everything in him just wants to hold Dean like he knows he needs to be.
“Yeah...we do don’t we.” Dean says slowly as his gaze falls to Castiel’s lips for the second time tonight.
“Dean, you are really misreading all of this. This is why we should be having these conversations while you’re sober…”
“Cas… please,” Dean begs.
Songs:
Dean decides to get comfy on his bed and wait. His phone goes off.
. Being together.” Dean kinda shrugs as he says it like he’s talking about the weather.
“That’s what I was thinking. Sounds like a few cases you’ve done before.” Castiel states. “I can come with you or I can stay behind and find other ways to be of use to you two.”
"And tonight?" Dean asks.
Small mention of some details from S9E: I'm No Angel (regarding April).
See endnotes for credits.
“Dean where are you going?” Castiel chuckles.
Sorry, it's taken so long to update, hopefully, I can become more consistent. Enjoy!
Another Nightmare - Sleeping With Sirens
“Why not? Because I’m drunk? I have drunk sex all the time. Or I did. What’s your deal?” Dean says with an accusatory tone.
Then Dean just falls onto his back on the mattress dramatically. “I don’t know Cas I want to have some fun.” Dean starts to sit up to grab something out of the snacks that Castiel brought for him. Castiel is glued to where he is, his heart racing.
He thinks. He looks down as Dean starts tugging on his pant leg and asks “So why aren’t you in some PJ’s or something? This isn’t comfortable.”
Dean visibly swallows as he takes a step back from Castiel, "Yeah, you 'dragged me out of Hell and you can throw me back in.' Like I can forget. Let's just drop this Castiel. I think enough damage has been done." Dean says quietly, a strange look on his face.
“Ya know, like
Was in a super creative mood tonight, so got an extra chapter! Sorry for the length, I like to just let things flow naturally and not edit it to death. Hopefully, you enjoy it! Feel free to leave thoughts!
“Why do you think that is Dean?” Castiel treads carefully.
Castiel and Dean are sitting in the Impala looking at each other. Not saying a word. But Castiel swore he heard Dean say his name. Dean looks as if he is about to cry.
“Yes, Dean?” Castiel responds, hearing the sad tone clinging to Dean’s voice.
This time Castiel is breathing heavily and sweating unlike the night before. Somehow more bothered but then there it is again, Dean is playing guitar. Castiel decides to conceal himself from Dean's sight and walks into the room where Dean is. He walks by Dean and Dean stops playing looking around, a puzzled look on his face. Castiel can tell that Dean senses him but he doesn’t know what it is he is sensing. So he shrugs, takes a long drink from his whiskey and goes back to playing his guitar. Castiel takes the scene in. Dean looks on edge, honestly like he is walking a tightrope...while drunk. As if Dean could fall off at any moment. This time he is playing a different song, one that somehow seems more sad than the last one but then Dean starts to sing.
“As long as you actually try that’s all that can be expected. I think with the right support you could get there.” Castiel smiles smally at Dean hoping he’s reassuring him. Dean seems to relax some, his finger on Castiel’s thigh slowing down.
Castiel’s eyebrows raise in surprise,
Too Good - Troye Sivan
“I’ll be back soon,” Castiel says right before he disappears.
"Oh that's good, 'm not jealous Cas. Fuck whoever you want. God knows I do and yeah maybe you rejectin' me upsets me but that's fine, if you won't fuck me then I can find someone who will." Dean threatens.
crosses his mind quickly and Dean shakes that off.
Before Dean can say anything else, Castiel has flown them into the middle of an open field. There are stars everywhere, and everything is worth it when Castiel watches Dean’s face absolutely light up with pure unadulterated joy, bathed in the glow of the full moon.
“Not exactly, was going to look for something to get into I guess instead of sitting around here. A little too much to drink today to drive. Honestly, I don’t think I’m up for the drive anyways. I’m tired.” Dean starts spilling to Castiel.
So, Dean woke up still a little tipsy and decided to flirt, the rest is history. I've already started writing the next chapter and I'm having difficulty with it emotionally, we'll just put it that way. T___T
“I know you do but I just don’t want you doing anything you’ll regret tomorrow,” Castiel says trying to reason with a very vulnerable Dean. Trying not to offend but also get him to understand that if he were sober there is no way he would be okay even with this much less anything else.
“Pizza, beer, and whatever else you want.” he shrugs.
Roam - The Story So Far
Then Dean's hand grips Castiel's. Startled, Castiel quickly glances at Dean's face. Dean is still asleep but his expression is pained. Castiel's heart sinks and he quickly sets the guitar down and tries to release his hand from Dean's so he doesn't wake him.
Dean places a hand on the back of Castiel’s neck, sliding his hand up to card through Castiel’s hair as his other hand finds his hip helping to keep him from swaying. This leaves Castiel struggling to keep a rational mind as his feelings heighten and all his mind can do is ask for more while repeating
Trigger warnings: touching on Dean's struggles with his sexuality, heavy alcohol use and everything that comes with that, some of what could be argued is bordering noncon but imo, it isn't so I didn't tag that.
Hopefully, the next chapter will be up quicker. :O
“No, I got distracted actually,” Dean says thoughtfully, then takes notice that Castiel is so far away. “Hey, you don’t have to sit all the way over there. You can’t really share all the snacks that way. Come over here.” Dean says as he pats the bed next to him. Castiel’s eyes go wide in surprise but he doesn’t hesitate to do as Dean asks of him. Once settled he tries to distract himself from their close proximity.
A million terrible scenarios flash through Castiel’s mind but one specific one regarding the guitar does. That night Dean was on the floor crying. “I would like that Dean.”
Then he lowers his head, lets go of Castiel’s hands as his own begin to slowly drag down each of Castiel’s shins further as each new sob is ripped from his chest until they find his ankles and Dean places his forehead on the ground at Castiel’s feet.
“I don’t know. I mean I’m not gay. But I do... uhhh, I’ve had dreams about you. Man, my dad would kill me. I don’t know. Sam would be cool with it. He would never let me hear the end of the ‘I told you so’ bit but he’d accept me. I don’t really think Bobby would feel any kind of way about it…” Dean is rambling, clearly just thinking out loud more than he is actually talking to Castiel.
Sam and Dean exchange inquisitive looks but decide to leave it at that. If Castiel wants to join he will, if not that's fine too.
**Warnings:
Castiel can’t help but wonder what exactly Dean meant by that. Shaken from that Castiel notices Dean lays on the ground, propping his head up in his hands as he kicks back and looks at Castiel, nodding trying to get him to join him. Castiel does, with a reasonable amount of space between them. He looks at the stars his father created, laying on the ground, next to a human his father created with so much burden and pain. A human that Castiel can’t help but love, against what heaven expects of him. To Castiel, it seems wildly unfathomable that a star could awe him more than this deeply complex human and how that human thinks himself so insignificant in the grand scheme of it all. While thinking about this Castiel feels his arm closest to Dean warming, turning his view to see that Dean has slid closer to him, now their arms are pressed together. Dean is still looking up at the sky like nothing changed. Castiel supposes this is harmless and looks back at the sky when Dean breaks the silence.
“Yeah Cas, I love it,” Dean says, his gaze lingering on Castiel’s face a little too long before his alcohol-riddled brain jumps to the next thought. “You probably don’t think the stars are as cool as I do though, being an angel and all.”
“I see. Well, don’t let me hold you back. I was just coming to see if you wanted to head back to the bunker yet, I could drive. But if you’d rather wait until tomorrow that’s okay too.” Castiel states blandly still unsure of how to speak to Dean given this morning’s events.
“Sure man. Jus’ has to be a good night though ya know.” Dean says kind of absently. Castiel looks at Dean and can tell that mentally he isn’t with him. “Sometimes it feels like that guitar is all the comfort I have left.” Dean continues.
How do y'all think Dean is going to react in the morning? We got some fluff in there finally! I didn't want to make it too unrealistically sweet but I just wish we got to see them happier in the show. :c
“It’s a coping mechanism is what you’re trying to say?” Castiel supplies.
Castiel sighs and debates on whether he should stay or not while looking at Dean's back rising and falling as he breathes. He wishes that he could convey the comfort that he finds in seeing that simple involuntary process, in knowing that his human is alive. He decides to stick around for safety's sake and lays in his own bed. He closes his eyes and tries to meditate as he often does when Dean sleeps.
“Cas...please.” He
When Castiel decides to go back to the motel it’s because he can feel that Dean is longing for him again but with something else added to it that he can’t put his finger on, he hopes that Dean is in a better state than he left in. This ache he feels through Dean tells him otherwise though. When he makes it to their room, to his surprise Dean seems like he’s getting ready to leave again. Castiel calls out to keep from startling Dean.
Dean's wandering focus was brought back to present time by an awkward shuffling coming from the chair on the other side of the room, but still he made no effort to notice the angel, his face facing the wall, heavy eyelids drooping like heavy curtains, calling him back to feverish dreams.
“What happened?” Sam kneels next to him, searching for visible wounds on his body, eyes fixing on Dean’s hand that still is pressing against his ribs.
They stack the boxes in front of the desk, and the emptiness, the finality of it, hits Dean out of nowhere, ice cold and painful. He stares at the boxes, feeling nausea creep upwards his throat, suffocating him.
“This your grand plan?” Dean spoke out, amusement dripping from the words, warm breath ghosting over his face, looking like he was anything but in a hurry to get out of this situation. The words almost felt like a tease, except his features became void of any emotion the following second, like sustaining normal interaction felt too difficult for him.
“Um, do I look like Gordon Ramsay to you?” Cas looks at him, slightly disappointed.
The service goes by quickly. Dean refused to make a speech beforehand, so Sam gets up and says a few words, voice breaking couple of times. He speaks out loud the usual platitudes; a husband, a father, a friend, who will be sorely missed. It’s hard to concentrate on the words, because the pain in Dean’s chest just gets worse and worse, if he tries to listen. There’s not one honest word in that speech, because their relationship with their dad was much more complicated than that. Dean moves on autopilot for the rest of the service, thoughts blurry, when they hoist the coffin and carry it outside. Crispy autumn air greets them, sun peeking out behind the yellowing leaves. Dean half-expected it to rain, like in the movies, and the beautiful October morning seems like a personal insult to the somber gathering.
“Dean, look-“ Sam stops to find the proper words. “-I’m not about to leave you, okay? And neither is Cas. I forgive you for all of that shit, you hear me? I forgive you, so you don’t have to carry that with you anymore. It just…I don’t want us doing the same mistakes over and over again, so we have to start being more open with each other. Trust in us.” His plea is earnest. It takes a minute to let the words sink in; Sam’s right there with him, this isn’t one of those times when he’s been given an ultimatum. Dean lets himself relax minutely, first time realizing how tightly his muscles been locked up. A fine tremor starts running through his limbs. He folds his arms tighter around his body, trying not to disturb the wound. The injuries are starting to remind Dean of themselves painfully again, now that his body is starting to come down from the alerted stage.
“Coffee?” He asks, amused. Dean mouths a wordless
“Fine, if you wanna work the case, let’s work the case,” Dean forces out grudgingly, still evading their gazes, and shifts slightly so Castiel can gingerly slip past him into the room. The door shuts loudly behind him, and Sam steps forward, giving him a sympathetic smile and a pat on the shoulder. Despite his frustration with Castiel over the phone, Sam feels like the only ally he has in the whole world right now. And he grasps that lifeline like a dying man, because he has no idea how’s he going to break through Dean’s defenses. He smiles wearily at the taller hunter and takes the seat Sam offers him, hunching in the chair like that’ll make him less of a target. Sam settles back on the edge of the bed and Dean stays standing up, leaning against the windowsill next to the door, arms crossed and scowling at the floor.
“You’re the expert”, Dean chuckles, feeling sort of simple for not knowing. “I bought it from a friend of mine, so no fancy story there. Really heavy to carry though”, Castiel nods, accepting the answer easily, blue eyes tracing the seamless surface keenly. Dean follows his expressions, fixated on the sharp gaze Castiel is appraising the table with.
They stay silent for a while, avoiding each other’s eyes, air suffocating around them. Dean feels suddenly bone-tired, tired of fighting his brother, tired of constantly fucking up his life.
Still, mostly what he misses, are the small things and details. Dean rarely wants to be the little spoon, and he grumbles about the whole thing almost every time. But he’s content like that too, Castiel knows, because the stuff that he doesn’t say, is what he has to look out for. His warmth and weight always feel so reassuring, Castiel can’t help but to gravitate closer. In the mornings, it takes usually an hour of grouchy silence and two cups of coffee to wake Dean up, any rushing or trivial small talk not approved. Dean values the slow mornings, as he was never able to have them while growing up, he explained once. Sometimes they steal small smiles and touches while on a job, and Sam pretends not to notice. Movie nights and drives in the Impala. Dean’s lopsided smile, when he’s pleased how he unravels Castiel when they kiss. Freckles and green eyes that are a reflection of a world of its own.
"you gotta follow-" Dean had gasped and bucked slightly when the angel's fingers had run over his tip, slick with precum, "-with how I'm reacting and letting that feeling build until..." His words had trailed off, eyes closed, when Castiel had found a steady rhythm with his hand that had brought Dean closer to the climax.
“I know, I know, I’m sorry. It’s tough what’s happening to your brother. But you gotta admit, it’s a little funny. How the fuck are you guys even related?” Cas shrugs, expression torn between amusement and embarrassment.
“Sammy, stop,” he wheezes, grips the handles just so he can have something to hold on to. Nausea makes his head spin. Apparently, Sam doesn’t hear him, and Dean tries harder, but his stomach muscles cramp and then he’s retching over the side. The chair stops at once and Sam is there, holding him up, soothing words spilling out of his mouth in a steady stream. Dean hears him distantly, but every spasm tears his wound, making his eyes water. Finally, they stop completely, the meager contents of his stomach emptied, and Dean slumps forward, boneless. Sam guides him back gently, squeezing his shoulder compassionately.
“You okay?” Sam asks immediately, reacting to his silent distress.
"Dean." A deep voice called out to him quietly. Dean let out a light sigh. He had no energy left for this battle. Still he turned around slowly, opening his healthy eye to face Castiel. The angel looked disheveled, his black hair messy, clothes crumpled and dark rings around his deep blue eyes. Castiel straightened in the uncomfortable chair when their gazes met, face portraying spectrum of emotions at once. Relief, horror at his handiwork, anxiety, exhaustion, and above all regret.
“Y-yeah, stay safe.” Cas gives him a final smile and a salute before he takes off, walking hurriedly, head pressed down to give him protection against the heavy rain. Dean watches after him, until the darkness engulfs his hunched form. He exhales shakily, finally letting out the breath he’s been holding for the last few hours. He’s fucking in love with Cas. He’s in love with him.
“Sir?” The nurse repeats and Dean snaps out of it, resolution filling him, he’s going to keep her safe, because that’s his job, and who cares about few little injuries, he’s had worse. He stops painting the sigil for a second, holding his hand out.
? Man, that must’ve been awkward.” Dean grins like it’s the most hilarious thing in the world, stabbing another slice of bacon with his fork, but Cas is studying him, a confused frown on his face. “Well, not necessarily. He seems like a nice man and I said I’ll think about it.”
“Yeah, dibs on first shower.”
Beer runs had been the keyword to their tentatively blossoming relationship. Dean had taken to asking Castiel to join him on doing various chores, mostly under the disguise of beer runs, tiptoeing around the subject of how he liked spending time with him. There had been subtle changes in the way they had acted around each other ever since Castiel said the words Dean deserved to hear,
“Really? You’re planning to slip out in the dead of night?” Dean’s voice is hollow. The lack of instant rage doesn’t feel any less comforting than this emptiness Dean’s attacking him with. There’s a small voice inside of Castiel that pleads him to salvage what he can, but looking at the other man makes any hope die within him.
for something like that so, um, I got frustrated. I know it was huge step for you, and I crossed a line there, shutting you down the way I did. I hope you can forgive me, because I can’t forgive myself over this.” Dean’s face must be frozen in a look of surprise and confusion, because no, he did not expect this. He expected blame and a big, ugly fight over this, and he expected to see Cas go. The breath he was holding escapes from his lips.
“Yeah, blue eyes, impossible strength, the whole nine yards. There was something very off about him though…” Dean trails off, trying to stop his speech from slurring. His energy is waning, and it gets more difficult to concentrate with each passing minute.
“...I mean, you’re right, we can manage, right?” Dean wets his lips nervously, shifting his weight and fixing his eyes on the daunting king-sized bed in front of him.
Dean’s been doing a pretty good job of avoiding Sam the whole morning. He sneaked back into their room in the early hours, swaying a little and reeking of cheap booze, and this morning found him like a jackhammer knocking on his skull. He went out on a supply run to get them breakfast while Sam was in the shower, a short trip that threatened to stretch out longer when he learned that the diner had Irish coffee with a fair percentage of alcohol in them. So yeah, he’s dealing with this very well. Dean has no idea what to do with any of the mess he’s in. The little jerk-off-session only complicated things, because he had sworn to stay as far as possible from Cas. And the worst thing? He knew exactly what would go down and still he went, more or less willingly.
The fourth thing Castiel had learned in time that Dean enjoyed rough sex. Bruises had often marked their exploits, fingertip-shaped marks on their thighs, bite marks on their jawlines, scraping nails trailing paths along their back muscles. Castiel had viewed it as a quirk in the beginning, but he had learned to enjoy the little sounds and expressions Dean made at the height of his pleasure, hazel eyes too far gone. The struggle had made it also easier for Dean to relinquish control, surrender to Castiel, relax trustingly under his touch. It had been a slow build to this point, with Dean struggling at first with his sexuality and Castiel's insufficient knowledge that sometimes frustrated the both of them. Dean had to teach him everything about giving and receiving pleasure, starting with how to jerk someone off. Dean had been a willing subject for that, letting Castiel explore with his hands aimlessly, even making the effort of not getting impatient when his cock was throbbing under Castiel's slow movements.
“Thank you, Sam.” Cas almost ends the call, but he adds hastily, “take care of Dean, please?”
The bed dibs, as Cas sits down on the edge of it. There’s a tiny
A shrill ringtone wakes Castiel up from his anxious thoughts. He immediately jolts, grabs the phone and presses the green answer-button before even checking out the caller.
“I just don’t get why you won’t let me heal you. I don’t like to see you hurt.” Cas spreads his hands in a gesture of defeat.
“So, what
The problem is, Dean knows that Cas has a way of breaking down his barriers. Ever since they first met, Cas has dug his fingers into his core, sometimes painfully, unshackling some pieces of himself he didn’t remember that existed. Sometimes that touch has been borne of forgiveness, soothing his scarred insides. Cas feels like a safe haven, someone to come home to. Someone to share his life with. And that scares Dean a lot. They haven’t ever really discussed this… thing that they have, instead just replacing the words with sweet, slow or hungry and desperate looks and kisses. And things worked out well, until the Mark of Cain. Until Dean screwed it all up because he was too weak to resist the pull. Cas left him because he was not good enough. Dean knows he had something,
“Hey”, he grunts as a greeting, trying not to sound like he has a huge hangover.
makes his insides freeze, a whole lot of panicked chatter invading his skull.
Castiel had lingered in the doorway of Dean's room, watching the man breathe steadily in the dark, hazel eyes closed as he had laid on his bed, deep in slumber. He hadn't dared to wake up the hunter, settling for guarding his dreams. Castiel had been away for some time, and seeing Dean always felt like coming home. He must've sighed too loudly and somehow through his hunter's reflexes, Dean had heard him and opened his eyes sharply, a gun ready in his hand, pointing at the door before he had been probably even awake.
“Several of them, I’m hoping. I need to seduce you thoroughly to make you become my boyfriend.”
“Yeah, well.” Dean shrugs and doesn’t purposefully look at Cas, focusing on finding fresh clothes from the bag. “I woke up, and wanted to get this show on the road.” Cas stays quiet for a while, and Dean can feel his eyes on him, but he’s very determined at ignoring him. He can’t look at Cas now, he’ll fucking
After a moment Castiel grabs Dean’s hips using his angel strength and pulls him down onto his own hips, effectively holding him in place so he can no longer grind into him. Turning his head to break the kiss. “Dean,” Castiel says sternly. “Please stop.” Castiel stays like that for a moment, keeping his eyes closed and face turned to really get his point across. But then Castiel feels an overwhelming pang of fear, and before he can register that it’s Dean’s feeling and not his, Dean reacts unexpectedly causing Castiel to turn his gaze back to Dean quickly.
Ketch chuckled, moving to get in Dean’s face. “You stupid, stupid boy. It’s not across the city. It’s across the bloody country. Sacramento, to be exact.”
Cas smiled, reaching to take Dean’s hand back, holding it in between them. Based on his empty hands, Cas assumed Dean hadn’t had much luck fishing, and his face brightened as he remembered the flower. He dropped Dean’s hand and ran outside quickly for a moment, leaving Dean confused and alone in the kitchen. He reached down, avoiding the thorns this time, picking up his rose.
He let out a huff. He had a meeting with his supplier, Ketch, in twenty minutes. It’d probably take him thirty to get across town without being spotted by patrols. That wasn’t going to fly well, but he’d be forgiven. Ketch was an impatient dick, but he looked the other way when it came to Dean. Ketch might be a prick, but he wasn’t dumb. Killing pushers for miniscule reasons, especially the best, wasn’t a good way to do business.
As rain beat down against the cabin, Cas let out sigh, comfortable and content next to Dean. He could easily stay like this forever, melted into Dean’s side, his warm skin pressed against his. His chest ached as he felt nothing for love for the man beside him. He would take what he had though.
Dean had already collapsed into bed, pulling up the blankets to turn over on his side, leaving Cas little room if he wanted to sprawl out. Cas rolled his eyes affectionately, before pulling back the blankets and settling down next to him. Like always, he draped his arm around Dean’s side, curling up into his neck, letting himself get warm. Dean seemed to always angle himself so when Cas wrapped him in his arms, he could feel Castiel’s lips against the side of his neck.
Ketch smiled wickedly. “Dean, I believe we both know the answer to that question.”
Dean coughed, turning over to climb onto his knees and look up at Ketch, hand still on his stomach for the agonizing pain. He opened his mouth to speak, before feeling metal connect with his face, more specifically his cheek. Tiny drops of blood oozed down his face, staining the floor as they slipped off his skin.
“Tomorrow would be splendid.”
Most raiders were young guys, in their twenties like Castiel, but most of them had seen it all. They stuck together, typically for safety, but some got along because of how bloodthirsty they were. They tended to kill and loot anyone they saw, and god forbid you were a woman. It was gut wrenching to have to sit and listen to what they did to women they found when they were close to his shelter. He would do something if he could, but when you lose all your guns, your best bet of surviving is being a ghost.
Cas sighed as he ran cold water over his finger, a light sting biting at his finger. He turned the water off to rummage through the drawers for band-aids, when Dean walked in and swatted his hand out of the way. Cas let out a slight, “ow”, from the smack, before Dean grabbed his hand to put the band-aid on it.
Dean took a sip of his coffee, walking over to stand above Cas and see what he was reading. He looked down, trying to make something out of the words, but nothing came to him. Whatever Cas was reading was at minimum a thousand years old.
Dean sat down next to him, staring out in the trees at the rain. The cold bit at his face, but Cas read on, unaffected. The jacket draped around his shoulders was Dean’s, and it didn’t fit. Castiel’s shoulders were too small to fill it, and he was skinnier than Dean, so it was a loose fit.
“Watch your manners,” she said, moving the gun back to have the barrel aimed at his head.
“Thank you,” he said, leaning down to plant a kiss on Castiel’s lips. Cas could just barely feel his heels leave the ground as he reached upwards, his hands on Dean’s waist. Dean was just barely tall enough to make Cas have to reach for it whenever Cas kissed him or buried his face in the crook of Dean’s neck.
Castiel’s only remaining knife had snapped on one of the clickers, which meant at the moment, he was defenseless. Never a good thing. Most people he ran into left him alone, since they knew him, and they would rather be left on their own, but a runner couldn’t care less who he was. He just prayed he could get back to shelter before the sun came up. That’s when the raiders came out to play.
“It’s nothing,” Castiel brushed it off. “I just got poked by a rose. That’s all.”
Based on the cold space next to him, Cas had probably been up a couple hours. Nothing new. Dean always seemed to wake up in the mornings alone, Castiel too restless to sleep any longer than he had to. It took time for Cas to even adjust to the idea of a sleep schedule, seeing as he only needed four or five hours of sleep before he was completely rested. It was frustrating at first, constantly being woken up at five in the morning, but Cas eventually learned how to sneak out of bed quietly, as to not wake his boyfriend.
Dean swallowed, wiping his cheek, the blood painting his knuckles red. “Fine,” he said, defeated. It wasn’t like he had any other options in front of him. “When do you want me to leave?”
The sound of rain beat on the roof overhead, and Dean was tempted to go back to sleep. Heaviness tugged at his eyelids, the warmth of sleep so close, but Dean sighed, and opened his eyes. He couldn’t sleep all day, as tempting as it was.
Dean lifted it up, partially, so he could get in under it. Tiredly, Dean set his head down on his boyfriend’s shoulder, the coffee not having kicked in yet. Cas leaned his head in, leaving his cheek to rest on Dean’s hair, and Dean closed his eyes in contentment, as the rain continued to beat against their home.
He moved down the ladder with ease, before dropping onto the hard concrete floor. It was an old bunker built to withstand blizzards, probably made in the early eighties. It was below a bar that had been completely trashed and raided, but thankfully the only way in was around back, and he seemed to be the only person who had known about it in a long time.
Dean lifted his arm to check his watch, a gift from his brother Sam when Dean was fifteen. Sam had found it in an abandoned hotel they had scavenged, before giving it to Dean as a birthday gift. It had always never worked quite right, and Dean had to reset once every week or so, since the hands would occasionally stop moving. Still, it was a gift, and he refused to throw it out, even after he had the chance to swap it for one that worked.
Dean wiped his cheek, his blood boiling with rage. “So explain to me,” Dean spat through a cough, still catching his breath from before, “why the fuck I’m here, if you’re just going to beat on me.”
“March 8th,” Ketch said, rising back to his normal stature. “The reason you’re here is March 8th.”
If Cas knew he was right there, he didn’t show it. His eyes were still glued to the pages, his brow furrowed like a million gears were turning in his head. Dean stared at the lines on his faces, the wonderment in his midnight-blue eyes, the almost invisible scars on his fingers from countless paper-cuts.
Dean hummed in agreement as he took another sip of his coffee, which seemed to finally catch his boyfriend’s attention. He looked up at him, with a soft, gentle look, and moved to the right, to make room for Dean. The chair was just big enough for two people if they squeezed together.
Kevin shrugged. “Could be worse. Haven’t gotten sick yet.”
“Nope,” Kevin said. “Some drunks the other day, but no soldiers or pushers. I told them to get lost or they’d regret it.”
Towards the front, though, a rose seemed to have finished blooming. It’s petals were a crimson red, raindrops running down the sides. Castiel smiled, running the back of his finger across the petals. Roses seemed to be Dean’s favorite of Castiel’s plants, and Castiel grabbed its stem, hoping to make a nice gift for his boyfriend.
“Sorry,” he said.
“Hey,” Cas said, grabbing Dean’s hand.
Dean slung the backpack off his shoulder, before shoving his hand in and tossing a small stack of ration cards to the kid. “Nice work.”
Cas bit his tongue and nodded. “Yeah.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean, Dean, Dean,” Ketch said, meandering over to him. “You and I both know I wouldn’t pummel you just for being late.”
Kevin had been working for Dean almost three years now. He had dropped out of school early to work since his mother had very suddenly died of heart failure, and the rest of his family had died before they ever made it to Boston. About only four months into working, a piece of factory equipment fell on him and shattered his hip. The doctors didn’t bother “wasting” supplies on him, saying he was going to be out of work indefinitely, no matter what they did. And since people who didn’t work didn’t get homes, Kevin had to reside on the streets. People on the streets normally earned their share by being lookouts for pushers, which is why Kevin was quick to ask to be a lookout in exchange for ration cards and the occasional shiv.
When Dean still lived in the bunker, he used to force Cas to have a movie night every Friday. Since Cas had never seen anything, Dean always picked, and Cas always seemed to be bored. Cas had eventually realized it was because he was far more into movies like the DaVinci Code instead of westerns, but Cas suffered through it every time, without complaint. One night, Dean had been up for at least three days, and passed out, on Cas. His head had landed on Castiel’s shoulders, and Cas didn’t move until morning, before Dean realized what happened.
“The Odyssey,” Castiel said with a smugness to his voice, like he was some professor or literature buff. “One of the first copies, in its original language. Rowena brought it for me the last time she visited.”
Cas remembered vividly the time when he was cutting vegetables for dinner that he accidentally sliced his palm open with a knife. Dean had been in the shower, and Cas had been quiet enough that he didn’t alert Dean. By the time Dean had gotten out of the shower, Cas was midway through pouring alcohol on it and nearly made it worse when he heard Dean’s shout of surprise by dropping the alcohol bottle on his cut. The entire bottle had spilled out onto the cut and hurt worse than the knife. Cas nearly collapsed from the pain, and he learned to shut up and let Dean help him when the injury was big.
He hadn’t realized his hand had been on his necklace until he moved it down to rest on his thigh. He had carried his mother’s wedding ring from before the world went to hell, but when it went down, he had found a black string on the road, and tied it around to wear. His father had made a snide comment about how men didn’t wear jewelry, but Dean had ignored him. He smiled as he’d like to think his father would be horrified at his son’s amount of rings and knuckle tattoos. When it came down to it though, Dean knew his father would have focused a little bit more on the surplus of male booty calls Dean had.
Getting guns was easily the hardest thing to do behind city walls. Most people were protective of their stash if they had one, and the soldiers loved to search and frisk people with no reason. Besides, a good portion of citizens didn’t have much reason to carry weapons. No clickers or runners behind city walls, so what was there to shoot? Dean practically scoffed at the thought. If you were a pusher, getting shot at was part of the job description. Not every deal was going to go smoothly.
Castiel stood on his toes, reaching up and turning on the lantern he had tied to the ceiling in replacement of the lightbulb. Dim light covered the room, and Castiel tossed off his bag before plopping down on the small bed in the corner. It was rusty and creaked when he moved, but the elevation kept away from the cold floor when it got cold.
Cas didn’t mind much. He liked the weight of Dean pressed against him. It was heavy, and Dean was relaxed. Cas knew he felt comfortable enough doing it, which had taken time. When they had first started dating, it was difficult for the two of them to get used to doing small, affectionate things. It wasn’t like they hated it, but they spent twelve years never doing it. It was strange being able to do the things Cas had wanted to do for so long, like holding hands, or cuddling up on a couch.
survive.
Dean was deathly silent as he weaved his way down the side of the building that had collapsed, taking him down to pitch-black alley. He reached down to his belt, clicking on the flashlight that he had strapped to it, before continuing on his path. Thankfully, most soldiers didn’t come down this way, since it was home to rats and homeless people. Most were disabled, and since they couldn’t work, they weren’t allowed homes, nor rations. They had to beg for food or dumpster dive. Thankfully, they all loathed the military, so Dean was often greeted with smiles and a friendly hello, and they’d give him tips about places to avoid. In return, he’d sneak rations to them when he could.
“Morning,” Dean said, his voice rough and tired. “Whatcha reading?”
Castiel sighed, stuffing it back into his bag, and laying down. It had taken a long time for him to catch his breath after his sprint away from clickers. He was thin, but it wasn’t from being in shape. Food was hard to come by, especially food that wasn’t stale or half eaten. Settling with a loaf of bread with fungus was never a good meal, but it was what kept him alive. Besides, raiders didn’t notice missing food as long as it wasn’t worth eating to them anyway. Some had been dumb enough to try and steal more noticeable items, like canned beans or peaches, and that’s when they noticed. Then, he was left to find food somewhere else for the meantime, until they caught someone.
Cas and Dean walked through the dark together, making it to their bedroom as another round of thunder shook the house. Dean was quick at slipping off his clothes, tossing them onto the dresser to be picked up in the morning, while Cas took his time to fold his jeans and shirt neatly, and to put his socks back where they belonged.
When Dean woke up and stretched his arm across the sheets, the first thing he felt was cold. He grabbed the sheets gently, peeking an eye open, to see an empty spot next to him. Pale, gray sunlight, flickered through the curtains, shining into his eyes. He groaned, turning over, trying to enjoy the peace of morning.
Dean yawned, and walked across the room silently to the coffee pot. On instinct, he reached up to the cabinet to grab a bag of coffee grounds, before he noticed a post-it note on the machine.
Reaching over to the coffee table, Cas shut the movie off, before setting the remote back down. He looked down at Dean, almost tempted to not move at all and simply pass out here. Feeling a chill run down his spine from the cold, Cas shook his head, and gently nudged Dean.
Ketch crouched down to Dean’s level, tilting his head with an almost amused expression. He put his finger under Dean’s chin, tilting his head up. “Mr. Winchester, I think we both know why you’re here.”
Castiel thinks. He can’t stop watching Dean rub his hand though.
“Oh, I also got you some whiskey since it’s only a little after 7,” says Castiel as he hands the bag over to Dean when his face lights up.
Dean turns to walk around the bed and Castiel grabs Dean's elbow effectively stopping him in his tracks. He turns Dean to face him, "Dean. While you have a lot to work on that doesn't mean I don't want to be close to you. Please stop with this for tonight. We can talk later." Castiel says, trying to calm Dean.
“If you say so.” Castiel quips putting his hands up in a surrendering gesture. Castiel can't help but notice the look on Sam’s face right before he says:
“I need you. Please Cas, I am begging you.” Castiel yet again cannot respond as much as he wants to and feels the panic inside him rise. Castiel is desperately trying to respond to no avail. Then he wakes up.
“Ah, it’s fine. Come on let's get more comfortable.” Dean says immediately getting up and taking his pants off.
as Dean reaches for Castiel’s hands but Castiel for some reason cannot respond. He just stands there seemingly unaffected by Dean’s pleading. What Dean does next causes something in Castiel to twist horribly.
“I knew it! I knew you were jealous about that and now you're over here trying to downplay what we have because you feel rejected." Castiel snaps.
It's You - Ali Gatie
. You understand that right? Castiel inquires quietly realizing now that Dean’s commitment issues may be a lot worse than he imagined.
"I'm back", he had shrugged tiredly, offering a light smile in return.
“Sometimes you’re a very hard man to read, Dean Winchester.” Cas says quietly. He squares his shoulders, popping his collar against the downpour and steps into the rain. He turns towards Dean again, takes a few hesitant steps backwards. “I’ll see you when I get back?” He asks, little louder. Dean can only nod.
and he succeeds in turning to his other side, ignoring the cries of his abused body with a breathless grunt, his desperate goal to get up right this fucking second and kick this fucker’s ass, but before he can get his limbs working, rough hands turn Dean back on his back. The man stands before him, face bloodied and impassive with his ice blue eyes, and he could finish Dean with one move, but his movements are oddly jerky, like his body is barely hanging on.
“Would you like a cup of coffee, Dean?”
”I don’t have time for your first grade lessons on human interaction. It was a mistake to come here.” He pushes up, ready to bolt for the door, out before things get hairy. But Cas seems to find his nerves at last, grabbing him by his forearm. It’s the arm where the Mark had been, and instinctively Dean expects to find the dark pulse quickening and slithering molten tendrils of wrath into his veins, but nothing happens. Just Cas' tight grip, fingertips pressing into his skin. Cas is closer now, eyes sorrowful.
“Please- ,” he starts, a desperate attempt to mend what he can, even though he knows it’s too late. Castiel just wants to cradle the other man’s face between his hands and soothe the agonized lines around his eyes away. For Dean, the one, single word hanging between is too much and it sets him over the edge. Castiel sees the signs milliseconds before Dean becomes a flurry of furious movement, in the tensing of his muscles, in the way his jaw sets, before he grabs an empty beer bottle from the table and hurdles it across the room. The sound of shattering glass rings in Castiel’s ears, and Dean is practically in his face, teeth bared like a beast.
“What do you mean? Have you talked to him?” He asks quickly,
“Is- is everything okay?” He sounds more hesitant now, slowly extracting himself from under the covers, gaze still fixed on him.
“Dean.” Castiel gives him a half-smile, eyes squinting curiously.
Castiel had had joined everyone else for dinner in the library, a large selection of Chinese food that had looked tasty, at least if he had tasted anything else than randomly merged particles. Sam and Charlie had both offered a smile when they had seen him enter the room, engaged in their conversation. Dean had been shoving rice and chicken in his mouth at a hasty pace, grumbling about how nerds they were, mouth full of food, his broad back facing him. As Castiel had passed him, he had traced his fingers along his shoulder blades, caressing Dean's short hair in passing when he walked by to take his own seat next to him, but the hunter just shied away from the gentle touch.
For the rest of the night, Castiel just revels in all of the good, warm feelings that he is feeling coming from Dean. It's not often that he feels this with Dean. Castiel contemplates the way that he is so in tune with Dean’s feelings. He still can’t seem to figure out how Dean seems to “pray” without actually praying, including the dreams that he seems to include Castiel in unknowingly. Castiel can feel Dean feeling happy, safe, relaxed, and that brings Castiel so much peace that he slips into sleep with a smile on his face and an arm around Dean.
"Dean?"
Castiel feels his stomach drop at the use of his full name, then he feels the waves of guilt and shame pouring over Dean. Castiel takes a deep breath and reaches to hug Dean but Dean blocks his movement and says, "Don't. It's clear that I'm the problem here so just keep your distance. I'm going to sleep."
Castiel walks closer towards the bathroom to find Dean half-dressed, toweling his hair dry. Dean looks at Castiel through the mirror.
you,” Dean
, Castiel repeats in his mind.
“Damn Cas, ya got the munchies?” Dean jokes.
Castiel feels a sharp pang of jealousy at Dean’s words but suppresses it because he can’t be upset with Dean when Castiel won’t even tell Dean how he feels for him. Dean doesn’t know. Castiel feels something in the pit of his stomach that he can’t quite put a name to. Despair? Loss? Longing? He isn’t sure how but somehow hearing Dean speak to who he can only guess is “Lisa” like this hurts his heart more than hearing what he sings. Though just like with the lyrics he is confused at some of what Dean is saying. Why would John disown him for loving Lisa? Also, Dean of all people can’t hook up? Castiel finds that hard to believe. But come to think of it, Dean doesn’t smell like women anymore when he comes home from being out...Castiel has noticed that but was too wrapped up in his own selfishness to really think about what that may mean for Dean.
“Do you ever think about us?” Dean asks thoughtfully. Castiel’s mind races to find a way to keep this conversation from going south.
"You guys are acting odd, what's up?" Sam carefully prods.
“I bring my own fair share of messes but we care about each other, so it’s okay. Right?” Castiel asks insecurely. The proximity of his best friend made his heart rate rise.
“Yeah, dad gave me it. I don’t really play it around anyone because I’m not that good but I like it. You know how I am about my music.” Dean says as he cheeses at Castiel because yes, he does know.
“Eh, I don’t wanna bother you with my bullshit Cas.” Castiel’s attention is brought down to his hand as he feels Dean absentmindedly begin to rub the back of his own thumb over the back of Castiel’s hand. Castiel hears Dean in his head,
_________________________________________________________________
>Cas: They don’t have the beer you usually get, is there something else you like?
“What’s that?” Dean wonders, more than questions.
Dean smirks and then he pushes Castiel up against the headboard and straddles him. “So what you’re sayin’ is that you can’t get out of your head? I can help with that.” Dean says as he begins to try to grind against Castiel and kiss him again. Cupping Castiel’s face as he leans down into the kiss. Castiel gives in for a moment and allows Dean to kiss him, trying hard to ignore the grinding before he can’t anymore.
“Hmmm. really?” Dean says as he seems to be contemplating what Castiel said. “I guess sometimes I think of things like that. I like it when we have breakfast alone and talk, that’s nice.”
“Oh yeah? I thought it might have been because you were in my room for some reason that you have yet to explain.” Dean says shooting a face in Castiel’s direction before drinking his beer again. Castiel sighs.
Castiel just smiles at Dean in acknowledgment and goes to sit on the bed next to the one Dean is on and says “So were you able to find anything you wanted to watch?”
Music for this chapter:
I'm going to start including the music I'm listening to as I write to add to the whole experience...also I listen to all kinds of music so don't be surprised.
Again. Neither move, both intensely looking into each other's eyes, a tear falls down Dean’s cheek, his eyes conveying his distress.
“I don’t know if I could ever be myself Cas,” Dean says not moving his gaze from Castiel’s eyes as he starts to trace his fingers around Castiel’s thigh rather fast. “Dad beat that out of me...or deep enough in I guess.”
It’s all that Castiel can focus on. Then Dean snaps at his silence, misreading it as Castiel agreeing to what he’d just said or at the very least not having anything to combat it with.
“Yeah, you already told me that.” Dean pouts, looking up at Castiel still not leaving his lap. Huffing as he crosses his arms across his chest really making himself look rather innocent and upset, which does something for Castiel he'd rather not think too hard about given the proximity of Dean's face to his junk.
“Dean, believe me, I know you mean it. But you have to trust me with this. Please.” Castiel pleads. Dean’s expression falls and he looks sad. His gaze drops to Castiel’s lips and before he can register what Dean is doing he’s crushing their lips together. He weakly tries to resist at first but then gives in to Dean. He’s wanted this for so long and after all, it is just a kiss.
By My Side - Lund
without speaking, now with a tear falling down his cheek. Castiel’s eyebrows knit together in concern and he wills himself to speak, to reach for Dean but his body refuses, only causing panic to rise within himself.
“Dean! Dean, please calm down, I didn’t mean it like that. I do love you. I really want to do this with you just not like this. Okay?” Castiel tries to soothe Dean. Taking a hand off of Dean’s hip to cup his face and make Dean look him in the eye. “You are everything I want. Everything I need. I just want to do right by you that’s all. Please try to calm down and hear me.” Castiel implored.
He starts playing the guitar again and sings “When I’m dreaming, well I know I’m gonna dream. I’m gonna dream about the time I had with you.”
“I have a couple of times actually. That’s why I brought it up.” Castiel says trying to tread carefully while he gets to know a new part of Dean.
Castiel hesitantly follows suit, “If you insist Dean.” he says reluctantly, then lays back on the bed, resting up against the headboard like he was previously. Dean just stares at Castiel. “Dean?”
“I’m so sorry Dean. But you should know there is nothing wrong with being gay or bi. If it’s who you are, then you should embrace that. It’s also okay if you’re not but it seems like you are at the very least not straight.” Castiel’s face softens as Dean looks into his eyes with a “you promise?” kind of look in his own. “We can change the subject if you need to. Not trying to ruin the fun.” Castiel concludes, Dean sighs.
“Yeah I know that you’re into me and I know that we have...a thing sort of. I know that I’m….y'know, I just don’t want to admit it.” Dean says now staring somewhere past Castiel with a look on his face as if to say ‘duh’. Castiel is unsure how to proceed with this conversation but he really wants to know more and he
“Of course, but in what context do you mean?” Castiel tries to play it safe.
Trying - Cavetown
"Please…" he quietly protests in his sleep.
Castiel thinks as he turns to make his way to his own room to try to go back to sleep.
Castiel chuckles. “You really are oblivious.”
**Credit:
“Oh really?”
“Because Dean, we obviously have feelings for each other. We didn’t come here with the intent to have sex with each other, and you have a lot you need to sort out before we do,
“I don’t know I kinda want to look at real stars..” Dean mumbles as he starts for the door. Castiel gets up and follows Dean. Once in the parking lot Dean gets frustrated that he can’t really see the stars due to light pollution. “Well that sucks, can’t really see them.”
Castiel notices that Dean seems exhausted. Perhaps he was wrong to think that after Dean passed out and Castiel calmed him, his problems stopped for a while. He doesn’t seem right. Castiel wasn't able to sleep the night before either, even though he doesn't require sleep it's often a welcome break from his day to day, now that he thinks of it.
He felt his breathing halt as the light from the soldier’s flashlight beamed down the alley, next to Dean’s face. Quiet, tentative footsteps approached, and Dean had inched the gun out of his jeans, cocking it as gently as he could.
Kevin caught them mid-air, shoving them into a torn bag filled with ration cards and shivs. “Thanks.”
“Seriously?” Dean scoffed, spitting blood onto the floor from where he had been hit in the mouth. “I got fucking knocked into the floor because I’m a couple minutes late? Would you prefer I’d been shot by a patrol on my way?”
Dean set the pot back where it belonged, before quietly making his way over to the front door. He took a deep breath of fresh air, the rain and coffee making for a peaceful smell. He leaned a shoulder against the door frame, staring at his boyfriend.
He leaned over, grabbing the med kit out of his backpack to open it as he sat back up, the mattress bouncing underneath him. It took a moment to pull the plastic box open, before Cas looked inside to see its contents.
Dean didn’t seem to pay attention to his words, looking more focused on the cut.
Rain was a shitty cover as Castiel snuck around the corner of a bombed out restaurant, but you make due with what you have.
it’s your fault,” Ketch said. “You are going to move it for me.”
Cas seemed to enjoy doing small things for Dean. Whether it was grabbing an extra blanket to put on Dean’s side in the middle of the night because it was cold, or leaving little notes around the house, or doing mundane little tasks to save Dean time. Cas was a romantic, and it showed.
It hadn’t taken Dean long to fall asleep, considering he had made a warm, deep-crusted pizza for dinner, and gorged himself on it. Thirty minutes into the movie he chose, Dean had passed out.
Through the windows, a dim light flickered, probably from candles. Ketch was definitely inside, cussing out Dean for being late. Dean adjusted his shirt once again as he walked over to the door, quickly slipping inside before he was close-lined directly in the face. He quickly crashed into the floor, and scrambled to reach for his gun, before he heard the ominous click of a shotgun being cocked and shoved directly at his face.
Leaning down, Dean pressed his lips against Castiel’s forehead, running his hand through his hair, which had grown long enough for it to be unkempt most of the time. Whenever he would get out of the shower, he’d take the time to do something with it, but it only took a few hours for it to become unruly. Dean didn’t mind it much. Some nights, when he couldn’t sleep, or would wake up to nightmares, he’d lay on his side and play with it while Cas slept.
“That’s good,” Dean said. “Anyone come through here that I should know about?”
Dean’s lips were warm, soft, and tasted like black coffee, and Castiel smiled against them, as the rain started to pour again outside.
The rain had already watered them for the day, and based on the thunder in the distance, it would continue to water them more in a few hours. Castiel crouched down, looking at his flowers. He had planted them almost a month and a half ago, and most of them hadn’t fully bloomed yet.
“I don’t mind. If you’re comfortable with it. Hell, I’d like to get outta these jeans anyways, I already lost the shirt. Would you feel more comfortable if I were in my boxers too?” Dean asks sincerely, smiling at Castiel.
“Nah, s’good.” Dean slurs. “I like this better.”
Castiel feels his stomach drop, it hurts because Castiel never fights this it’s always Dean being an ass about them being more. It’s not fair, none of it is. It’s not fair that he’s being chastised for being difficult. It’s not fair that he has to put a stop to things going any further because he is of sound mind and Dean is not, because he knows Dean too well. He knows Dean will already be losing his mind over what has happened so far.
“Uh well, I mean there’s so much to choose from…” Castiel starts to try to backtrack, scared to piss Dean off and being a little unnerved by Dean’s fixation on his lips.
In this chapter, we find out what is tormenting Dean. Castiel finds himself beside himself as he becomes even more lost as to how to help Dean. Though, he does have more insight into some of Dean's thought processes and why he is the way he is.
“Dean?” he tests.
“I put you in your bed one night when you were passed out, I removed my tie so that it wouldn’t be in the way when I carried you. I promise I didn’t ‘do any freaky shit to you’ as you so eloquently put it.” Castiel says, rolling his eyes.
“Uh, sometimes when I’m on missions I’ll see certain places and wish I could take you there so you could see them. Or, sometimes I wish just you and I could go out and do something fun. I love Sam don’t get me wrong, but you are different when it’s just us. I miss that sometimes.” Castiel concludes.
Castiel thinks about what he’s hearing. He knows that Dean used to do drugs but he stopped shortly after he’d met Castiel. Dean still has a serious drinking problem but it’s progress nonetheless. Castiel wonders also if he really spoke to Lisa in depth when he was with her, Dean doesn’t like to open up too much. He talks to Castiel but he usually has to be backed into a corner, unable to deal with the hurt. Which hurts Castiel now that he thinks of it, Dean seems very upset currently yet he is hiding it from Castiel. Also, “

“What happened Mr. ‘I rebuilt you Dean’, are you shy?” Dean pokes fun at Castiel.

“Why wouldn’t you come with me?" Dean blurts, getting a head tilt from Castiel and a smirk with raised eyebrows from Sam. "Or...us I mean." Dean corrects himself.

Something quickly catches his attention before he can begin to think too much about his dream. The sound of a guitar and he wonders what Dean is listening to. It doesn’t sound like Dean’s usual taste in music. Though Castiel doesn't understand the significance of music to humans this somehow seems softer, calmer than his usual rock and roll choices. Castiel could even detect a note of sadness or longing. Perhaps both. Looking at his phone he sees that it’s 3:15 am. Castiel gets up and listens while stepping very quietly towards where the music is coming from waiting for the lyrics to begin curious as to what Dean is listening to. Maybe it will give him some insight as to what is on Dean's mind. But then he is shocked by what he sees...and hears.
“Is the hug helping?” Castiel asks, trying to keep things innocent.
Dean looks at Castiel quizzically, to which Castiel shrugs. Dean then looks at Sam. “I mean I’m good, not sure why Cas wants to hang back but…" turning to Castiel, "if you’re not up for the hunt today that’s fine. You do plenty for us Cas, take a break if need be.”
Always, I'll Care - Jeremy Zucker
Dean sits on the bed beside the one Castiel is standing in front of and leans back on his palms as he looks at the ceiling for an answer.
Added some lines from S5:E16 Dark Side of the Moon because that scene was just too relatable.
Dean starts to fiddle with his phone thinking that maybe he could talk to Sam about it but then he quickly decides against that. Dean goes back to distracting himself and this time he thinks that porn might do the trick, hell then he can pass out and sleep the rest of this awful day away. At that Dean gets his laptop and makes himself comfortable on the bed. As he tries to pull up his usual go-to he thinks,
“What? Me? I’m fine, stop being weird.” Dean plays it off and thinks
“When am I ever sober Cas? Tell me! When will there ever be a good time? When will things be okay enough for there to be an
“You have plans?” Castiel gently pries.
Castiel looks up at Dean, looking over his face seeing the panic and hurt etched in his beautiful but tired features. Feeling the anger and fear radiate from him.

(See the end of the chapter for
So now Castiel is beating himself up & Dean is off to get shitfaced. Hang in there, the next chapter will be a little happier.
Dean sets his phone down on the nightstand and begins to try to find something on the shitty motel TV for them to watch together. He should’ve told him to grab a couple of movies but it didn’t cross his mind then.
“Unfortunate,” Dean says sarcastically drinking again. Castiel snaps his head towards Dean shocked at what he just said.
My Heart I Surrender - I Prevail
Dean tries his best to go to sleep but he can’t. He’s tossing and turning and steals glances at Castiel when he is facing his direction.
“I admit I did have a specific creation in mind when I said it,” Castiel says quickly as his mind raced to find a way out of this. While he wants nothing more than to give into all of this, Dean is pretty drunk so he’s unsure if it’s right to even entertain and the last thing he wants is when Dean does sober up for him to be pissed at him. “So, do you normally have a fascination with space or did Star Wars bring this out of you?” Castiel says trying to be nonchalant as he turns his gaze to the sky. Effectively missing the disappointment on Dean’s face as he mimics the move.

“Oh, I uh...lots of things,” Castiel says caught off guard.
Thank you as always for your comments, kudos, & bookmarks! :D
(See the end of the chapter for
he thinks to himself.
“Hell, maybe next time I feel like playing I’ll play you a song some time. Why not? You’ve definitely seen me in worse scenarios.” Dean shrugs as he takes a drink of his beer.
“No, this doesn’t add up. You can’t tell me that you feel the same, that you love me, or that you understand while rejecting me like this.” Dean says heatedly, rising up on his knees as he yells, his insecurity causing him to attempt to seem like a threat. A fruitless effort up against an angel.
“I’ve got you, Dean,” Castiel says trying to soothe Dean as he starts resituating the bed so he can help Dean towards the headboard. Once he has Dean back in his spot he gives Dean a moment after all of the movement. Then he slides closer to Dean, placing an arm around his back and his other across his chest and arms, pulling Dean to his chest as he tries to hug him awkwardly. Worried that if he does it differently it’ll come off as something else. “How is that?”
“I’m not oblivious Cas.” Castiel’s eyebrows shoot up to his hairline at that confession.

The last part of the song comes out choked up, a strangled sound that Castiel has heard too many times out of Dean yet it still sends chills down his spine. Again Castiel finds himself wanting to reveal himself and just hold Dean, give him a safe place to just fall apart. But he can’t help sitting there trying to pick apart this part of the song Dean is singing now. This part obviously is about John and Mary. Castiel can certainly relate to the daddy issues that Dean has. They both hold their fathers  in high regards. Their fathers are the strongest people, who know what’s best, who do what’s right. They have both also lost their fathers and long for them still. It weirds Castiel out how much that part of the song resonates with him. Castiel is then startled out of his thoughts by a loud thud. He looks up from the floor he was staring at and sees that Dean had fallen to the floor. Castiel jumps up and starts to come to Dean’s side afraid something has happened but stops suddenly as Dean starts to talk to himself, drawing his hand back from Dean.
Castiel continues to watch as Dean slides the guitar onto it's back in his lap. Dean runs his hand around the instrument as if it’s something he cherishes. It looks worn, like it's seen a lot of these nights. The same kind of worn Dean looks. Castiel wonders why he’s never seen the guitar before or known Dean could play. Perhaps it’s because this is a new arrangement, staying at the bunker with the Winchesters. Maybe this is a side of himself Dean doesn’t let anyone see. Castiel is tempted to read Dean’s mind, then maybe he'd know how to fix things. But decides that is wrong, if Dean wanted him to know he'd tell him right? The moment seems very intimate so Castiel decides to leave Dean to it.
“Ha, there’s no way that you don’t get tired of being pulled into my messes.” Dean turns his body so that he is propped up on an elbow facing Castiel. Castiel immediately misses Dean’s touch but finds himself in a new predicament. The way Dean shifted now has him extremely close to Castiel’s face and slightly over him. Assumingly Dean is so drunk he’s unable to realize this.
“It’s fine Dean. Thank you.” Castiel says as he adjusts. A few moments of silence pass.
“Dean... I hear you. But you’re not in the right headspace right now. You can’t possibly believe that I’m only saying these things to bed you? Doing all of this because I want to use your body? Logically, if that’s what I was looking for then I would do what you normally do and find random people. You do understand the difference right?” Castiel looks at Dean incredulously.
Castiel sighs heavily as he reaches for his scar on Dean's left shoulder, physical proof of their bond, and uses his grace to calm Dean. Castiel takes note that Dean's expression and body language in general has fully relaxed.
Bela turned the gun, slamming the handle of it into Dean’s gut, making him let out a groan as he winced from the pain. He let his head down onto the floor as he clutched his stomach, barely able to not double over from the pain.
“He wants me to move something,” Ketch spoke, disdain in his voice. “A bag full of materials. I don’t even know what it really is he wants moved. And it’s because of you.”
Figured you’d be tired :)
Cas was peculiar in a lot of ways, but Dean found his obsession with the rain the most odd. No matter how cold or hot, or how late or early it was, if it was raining, Cas would grab a book off the shelf, and head outside to read. And every single time, he’d crack the door open, letting the smell of rain flood the house. He had read almost every book in the house twice, the majority of them some ancient, foreign language, but he still went out to read, every single damn time. Dean almost regretted moving to Washington just because of it. Almost.
“Hey, what happened?”
It was strange to realize how far they’d come.
If Dean was being honest, he did most of the confrontational work when he was on the road with Sam, before Boston. Both Dean and Sam had agreed that it was better when Sam stayed back and just let Dean take care of things. Sam knew how to shoot, it’d be stupid for Dean not to have taught him, but Dean saw the way his hands trembled when he held the gun or a knife. Killing wasn’t his baby brother's style. Dean couldn’t say it wasn’t a relief that Sam was moderately normal in a world where being a psycho was never truly off the table.
He had shot his fair amount of people if he really thought about it. Never kids, mostly people who tried to kill him or his brother, or steal what he had. Some of them had asked for it, being infected and not wanting to turn. Those weren’t as painful, since Dean knew if he didn’t do it, someone else was going to come along and kill the guy in rabid form. It was easier to do it and save some poor soul the risk of putting down a newly turned runner.
Ketch shrugged, crossing his arms. “Not my problem.”
He tossed the blankets off of him, swinging his legs over the side, and his skin broke into goosebumps as the cold, late-fall air hit him. The house smelt like rain, and Dean figures that Cas left the door open, like he always does. Dean shook his head. It’s a rainy day. Of course he left the door open.
For the most part, Dean had his fair share of good and bad deals. Some people were quick to take the merchandise and give the ration cards, others took some time to decide what they needed more, and others tried to steal. Stealing a pusher’s merchandise was a bad idea. Most pushers got shot if they lost what they had, meaning that stealing merch from them was the same as pulling the trigger themselves.
“Hey,” he whispered.
Cas yawned as the movie continued on, two characters deciding on having a duel. The movie had been playing for an hour and a half now, and Cas couldn’t force himself to pay attention. He had been up a long time, and the dark room, with Dean curled up next to him, seemed to be enough to make him exhausted.
He inwardly let out a sigh of relief as he approached his shelter, small rays of light streaking over the mostly abandoned city. He did a double take to make sure nobody was around, before nudging the dumpster to the side to reveal doors to a small bunker. Crouching down, he grunted as he pulled them open, before stepping down onto the ladder. He made sure to close one, before lowering the other and yanking the dumpster back into place, and then dropping the second door before tying the doors closed with a chain he had found.
Dean looked up at Cas, confused. Cas gave him a warm look, and caressed Dean’s hand with his thumb. Dean seemed to relax a little bit at this, and let Castiel’s hand go. He handed him the band-aid, and stuffed his hands in his pockets while Cas wrapped it around his finger.
Night had long settled over the city, stars peeking through thin gray clouds if you looked close enough. A warm gust blew through the night air, a small taste of the summer months ahead. Winter had been brutal, with a blizzard that must have killed at least 70 people in one section. Of course, bad winters tended to predict bad years, and that usually meant dry spells.
Dean gave a puzzled expression, before wincing as he stumbled to stand up right. “You want me to move extra across the city? Ketch, that’s not a problem. I do that for you anyways.”
He felt his shoulders slump as he stood upright again, a small barrel fire coming into his view. He felt a small smirk creep across his face as he rounded the corner, seeing a huddle of people on the ground, sheltering themselves and their fire from the rain. By now the rain had gone from a light shower to a downpour, and Dean could see fifteen year old Kevin Tran hiding under his jacket. The kid gave a weak smile as he saw Dean, giving a tiny wave.
“So what? You’re gonna shoot me?” Dean said. “Because we both know I’d already be dead if that was your plan.”
“Hey Dean,” Kevin said through chattering teeth.
Castiel let out a slight gasp as the thorn between his fingers pricked him, and he dropped it from shock. A thin line of blood trickled down his finger and his palm, and he winced from the pain.
“Get to the fucking point Ketch,” Dean snapped, before feeling the barrel of the shotgun on the side of his head, shutting him up.
Dean was pulled out of his thoughts and felt his heart almost stop as he saw a flashlight turn around the corner, Dean let out a slight gasp out of instinct before ducking behind a dumpster. He turned his flashlight off in an instant, before reaching his hand towards the grip of his gun. He hoped to God that the rain had drowned out his scuffled steps as he had rushed to hide.
Cas could feel Dean’s hair barely tickle his neck, and Cas could smell his cologne. It was strong and masculine, the type that made Cas feel like he was in a hunter bar if he closed his eyes, and it was a stark contrast to Dean’s action of being curled up against his five foot eleven boyfriend.
Dean seemed to lose too much sleep over Castiel’s well-being. It wasn’t that he didn’t appreciate it, but sometimes, it was just a bit much. Any bump, bruise, or scratch seemed to send Dean into a panic, like Cas would collapse at any moment. Cas had learned enough about how to clean wounds that he didn’t bother saying anything when he hurt himself in small ways, but if Dean was nearby, and he made even the tiniest sound of pain, he came running.
Dean was easily fifteen minutes late by the time he managed to reach the abandoned restaurant where he always met up with Ketch. He did his best to smooth down his sopping wet clothes, and tried to slick his hair back, so he didn’t look completely disheveled. Ketch was annoyingly uptight about appearances, despite the fact that ninety percent of his workforce were people struggling to get by.
“Anybody there?” a light, nervous voice called out. They couldn’t be more than nineteen.
“Heyo kid,” Dean smiled. “How you holding up through the weather?”
Pouring himself a cup, Dean looked out the window to see Castiel sitting in his favorite chair, his legs curled up onto it, his book splayed out across his knees. Whatever he read, he always seemed to invest himself in. No matter how many times he’d read it, he’d cling to every word on the ivory pages.
As long as he could stay a little longer like this, he was happy.
“Of all my pushers, Dean,” he said, disappointment underlying in his tone. “I would have figured you could at least show up on time.”
In an instant, Cas was back in the kitchen, accidentally slamming the screen-door shut behind him. He held out the rose, childishly, with a grin on his face. Dean looked down at it for a moment, a small smile playing at his lips, before he picked it up. He rotated it in his fingers, before setting it down on the counter and tossing his arms over Castiel’s shoulders, his smile now wide across his face.
If Castiel really thought about it, he hadn’t had a proper meal since he was six, at a military base for people who weren’t infected, when the military still cared about everyone. Even then, it was army rations. At six, he barely choked it down, but now, at twenty-three, the thought of having a meal that wasn’t spoiled could easily make his mouth water.

“Take you like a drug, I taste you on my tongue. You ask me what I’m thinking about. I tell you that I’m thinking about whatever you’re thinking about. Tell me something that I’ll forget and you might have to tell me again. It’s crazy what you do for a friend.”
We're going to see what Sam has to say as well as see how Dean and Cas progress from here in their... non-relationship.
Dean has a thought suddenly and gets up out of bed and goes to the bathroom to freshen up.
“I could say the same for you, Dean.”
"Fine," Dean says blandly as he yanks his arm from Castiel then rounds his bed in the motel room to lay down.
"No…" he hears Dean whisper, close to a cry.
Feel free to leave any thoughts you have! I love new insight and feedback. Hopefully, you enjoy my twist on the boys' story. Thanks for reading!
“You told me you didn’t think you were gay this morning, but did you ever think it was something else? There is more than just gay or straight when it comes to sexuality. John was homophobic I take it?” Castiel pries a little.
