Ok, so before you all go jumping to conclusions and breaking your ankles in doing so, there is no ulterior motive behind why he wants to bring Cas lunch.  He's just a good guy that does what he can for the people he cares about.
“So, why is he still in this dump?  Why didn’t you bring him home last night if he’s really your true mate?"  she asked.
When his mate’s back began to spasm from sitting up so long in the tub, Ellen brought in a pillow, pulling him forward enough to plunk it down in the water behind him.  Cas’ breasts were leaking a clear fluid which had alarmed Dean, until Tess told him it was perfectly normal.  The contractions were starting to come faster now, and Cas was crying.  It broke Dean’s heart to hear it.  When Tess announced that Cas was finally at nine centimeters, Dean stood up and stripped down to his tee shirt and boxers.
“I agree.  That’s an excellent idea.  I will help with anything I can.”
“I feel like I’m being greedy.  I-I have some money now that I don’t have the rent to pay.”  Cas looked up shyly.  “But my wallet is back at the house.”
“Me too.  You’ll be within walking distance, which means our pups will know one another,”  Dean said.  Gabe smiled and nodded.
“Wait!  Wait!  I should get a say!  I wasn’t going to kill him!  I swear I wasn’t!”  Luke cried.  The stink of his fear filled the room.
“Or maybe you want it too.”  Dean nipped at his mate’s ear, making his Omega shiver.  Cas grinned at him, his blue eyes twinkling in the fading sunlight.
“Y-you don’t have to do that.”  Cas buried his face against Dean’s neck in embarrassment.  Dean set the fabric aside before turning to pull Cas into his arms.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So doc says everything looks good?  Do you know what the pups are?”  Charlie asked as she sat down at the computer.
“Oh…this is so good…”  Cas moaned around a mouthful of cheese, bread, and bacon.
“Dean?”
Gabe:  See ya!
“Exactly.”  He confirmed.
“Anyplace else you wanted to go today?”  Andy asked.
“It matches your eyes,”  Dean admitted, his cheeks turning a rosy shade of pink as he folded the sweater over his arm again.  Cas batted his eyes and grinned, which just made Dean laugh.
“His mate was not his true mate.  There was a process involved to sever the bond, but it can be done when it’s not true mates.”
“I don’t care, Sam. You may think you’re falling in love with me, but baby, I’m already there. Scars aren’t going to scare me away, ok?  I’m not going anywhere,” Gabe told him. Sam nodded and sat up enough that shirt could be pulled over his head. As Sam laid back against the pillows, Gabe saw the first of the scars. Subtle, thin lines scattered across the Beta’s chest and stomach. It angered him to see them.  He wished he could kiss each one away.  His fingers traced one that actually ran through a tattoo on Sam’s chest, right over his heart. Ignoring the scar, he asked about the tattoo.
He nodded and watched her leave, getting into her own squad car and driving away.  When the last car was gone he looked nervously around.  Neighbors were being nosey, standing on their front lawns, watching the drama as it unfolded.  Not wanting to be the subject of anymore attention he turned the alarm off and went inside.  Once the front door was locked he turned the alarm back on.
Dean stopped in the living room where Gabe, Sam, and Charlie were all sitting and talking.
“Dean, that’s a lovely gesture, but it would be incredibly expensive.”
“You’re speaking a foreign language to me.  I’ve heard of stir fry, but I’ve never had it.  And what is an edamame?”  Cas looked up expectantly.  Dean picked up the bag of edamame and handed it to him.
“I’ll see you both in the morning to draw the blood.  Remember, no eating or drinking anything more than water after eight tonight.”  With one last smile she left so Cas could get dressed.  He broke down in tears instead.
“…No.”  He replied.
“You don’t know Alistair.”  Cas whispered.
“Can I help with restoring some of these stores?”  Cas asked, tilting his head back to look up at Dean.
Gabe stared blankly at him for a long moment.  He was torn.  There had been no clue, no suggestion that his own
“I’ve looked for you my entire life.”  Dean murmured as he nuzzled against Cas’ neck, breathing in the soft scent of summer and rain.  The man smelled absolutely divine.

Alan had been quiet until that moment.  “My third oldest, my daughter Sarah, she had breathing issues at birth too.  Was in the NICU for the first month of her life as she was born eight weeks early.  She still has asthma now at twenty seven.  If this tea works, have your mate drink as much of it as he can stand.  Your son, and the rest of your pups will all benefit greatly from it, but so will your mate.”
Climbing out of the grave proved difficult with all the mud. He kept sliding back down and his frustration and panic were growing stronger by the minute. Suddenly, as he was slipping again, a hand shot out and grabbed him around his wrist. In one smooth move he was yanked out of the grave and onto the grass. He landed on his knees and once he’d oriented himself he sat back on his haunches to look around. Standing in front of him was probably the most beautiful man he’d ever seen, and he looked amused.
“Honey, shhh.”
Dean felt so awful.  His guilt was so deep it brought him to tears and he hugged his mate tighter at the next contraction.  Cas moaned and his eyes fluttered before opening.
Cas pushes himself further than he should in his condition, leading to problems with the pups.
“In other words your kitchen floors are clean enough to eat off of,"  she teased.  He smiled.
“Daddy!”  Molly came running down the hall, and he was so very glad to see her fully dressed in clean clothes.  He scooped her up and turned so Alfie and Jude could see her.
“And that’s hoping they’ll even give it back.” Alfie added.
Cas looked up in shock at his mate.  “Dean!  That’s a lot of money!  You can’t just go buying utilities!  This isn’t Monopoly!”
“I brought this on you.  I brought this on all of you.  This is all my fault.  If I’d just submitted to him when he first came after me, you’d all be safe.  Now…”  He shook his head and pushed Dean’s hands away when he reached out for him.  He didn’t want to be comforted.  “He wanted me and I wouldn’t let him have me, and now he’s raining hell down on your family.  On our
It was only a few minutes later that Dean was dressed and ready to go see his pups.  As he left the room, Ellen fell in next to him.
“Would you like help getting ready for bed?”  Cas asked him.  He saw his own brother shoot him a dirty look out of the corner of his eye but chose to ignore it.
“You don’t have the right to ask about my brother.”  Dean snapped.  Luke immediately dropped his head in submission.
“I wish I knew.  It is a big house, someone could be hiding anywhere.”  Sam replied.
“Oh, shit…”  Sam frowned and looked at his brother.  Dean was contemplative, which meant he was thinking of taking his mate and leaving.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“You feel good now that you’ve eaten, but morning sickness can have you tossing your cookies at the most inopportune times.  Best to keep your stomach calm to give your food time to digest,”  Gabe explained.  Cas smiled at his brother.
“Did he go to school?”  Dean was curious as to whether Jude had earned any kind of college degree like Cas had.
“Go, gather the guests in the seating area where the reception was to be held.  After that, can you please check on our pups?  I need to bear witness for Sam, and I’m taking Cas with me.”
“Well, he did.  From what I understand an aunt or someone took him in for a while, long enough for him to attend college, but then she died and with no one to act as his guardian he was sent to The District.  He was there for a very long time.”
“Well, the first thing you did was you ripped his arm right from its socket, the one holding the gun.  He was in shock and pain, and he let go of you.  When he did, you lunged, tackled him to the floor.  Did you know Omegas have claws?  And wicked sharp canines?  Because I did not until that moment.”
“Thank you, you’ve been very kind.” Dean graciously accepted the clothes and as soon as the door was closed he hurried to get dressed.
She left to go make them food while Sam came in to help.  Gabe came to collect Molly while Sam and Dean worked together to help Cas get up and into the shower.  Dean stripped down the rest of the way once Sam left and got in to help wash his mate down.  Once he’d gotten Cas cleaned up, he helped him into the clean boxer briefs that were lined with pads meant for post-natal bleeding.  His belly was still extremely tender and having anticipated this, Dean had gone back to buy the birthing gown he’d spotted all those months earlier.  Sure, it was getting used
“This is nice,” Dean looked at the faucet. It was definitely modernized yet it was a style that matched the house. It was meant to look old fashioned.
“That’s a beautiful name, shall I write it down on his card?”  the nurse asked.
“You’re not welcome here.  You need to get off my property,” he said firmly.  Gabe was small compared to Dean, but his tone was commanding and he noticed how the woman twitched as she tried not to follow the order.
So....I hope you all enjoy this chapter.  I know it's going to get some of you excited. Maybe really excited.  And to think, you have to wait til Wednesday for the next chapter....
It hurt Dean to hear Cas say that.
garlic?  Dean always uses garlic butter.  I’ve never had it with real garlic before.”
“Where are the pups?”  He asked when he saw only Ellie sitting at the table with Donna.
“What happened?”  There was force in his words.  He was demanding to know what had just scared the hell out of Dean and that caused his heart to ache so much it might break.  Lying was pointless.  Besides, he’d promised he never would.
a Beta.”
“You ok?”  Dean placed a hand on his brother’s shoulder and squeezed.
“Get some rest.  Your girls are safe,”  Gabe said.  He and Sam exited quietly, closing the door behind them.
“Mayor, how has your work at city hall been affected by having four new pups?”
“Oh, I bet Reeva came and got them.  Jo and Donna are gone too.  They let us sleep in.”  Dean dropped back onto the mat and stretched.  The sound of laughter reached his ear and he sat up on one elbow to look out the window.
His reflection shocked him. The skin of his throat was smooth, without any sign of the damage that woman had caused but what really shocked him were his eyes. The green looked muted and they were bloodshot. He had stubble they hadn’t bothered to shave too. His skin looked rather sickly too and he could see the networks of dark veins that covered his skin. Had they done an open casket? No, Sam would have made sure it was closed, hence the stubble and lack of the thick makeup they used. There was no scent of formaldehyde which gave him pause. If Sam had ignored his request and had him embalmed anyway he’d have never woken back up. He shivered at that thought.
“I watched the press conference you held.  Good job of putting a lid on those rumors before they could get out of control.  Too bad you have another asshole brother in law though.”  She said.
“That’s Jo and the Alpha that has been courting her.”  Dean said to his mate.
Out in the car Cas got to thinking.
“Please, I need you.”  He took Dean’s throbbing cock in hand, stroking it until it was covered in the slick, and then guiding it in.
receive your walking papers.  You all are fully aware of my stance on sexism and segregation.  You will show him the same respect you show me.”  Dean’s voice was commanding and everyone listened.
“Exactly.  Except we’ve already knocked out the mating part.  In ancient times the ceremony that bonded two members of a pack together included mating in front of the entire pack, and claiming.  Well, Sam and I are not exhibitionists, and I’ve already claimed him, so this will literally just be a wedding and celebrating.”
“What, uh, other movie did you want to watch?”  Gabe asked.
“But what if they do that thing Ginny said? What if they force a heat and a rut? That’s impossible to fight. A rut when the Omega isn’t in heat? Ok, yeah, with some serious self-control they can keep to themselves. An Omega in heat, you guys can keep yourselves under control, right?”
“Uh, no.  I haven’t been able to come up with that kind of money.  I would send him if I could, but I’m barely making enough as it is now.  He has a job interview though, and if he gets the job we’ll be able to afford to put the pup in the Omega daycare down in The District.  We hear good things about it,”  Alfie said.
“And you’d be correct.  I never wanted to live there.  We have a nice house about three miles away.  Gabe and Sam live about three blocks from us,”  Dean told her.
“Dean!”  He gasped as his second orgasm hit, and he felt the moment his mate’s knot began to catch.  He also felt his mate’s hesitation.  Dean was thinking of pulling out at the last moment before they knotted.
“She was a wonderful woman,” Sam added, his own voice reflecting his pain. “I don’t think we’ll ever really get used to her being gone.”
“I’ll tell him in the morning.  I’d like him to at least have one night where he can be completely relaxed and happy.”  Dean rubbed Bailey’s ears before dropping his hand to his side.
“Oh, sure.  We can work on that on the weekends.  For now though we need to go shopping for clothes, and a new messenger bag for you, but I’m loath to do it here in the city.  I’m going to call a friend and as much as I despise flying, we’re going to head up to Chicago to go shopping.  That way I can pop in on the shops I have there while we’re in that area.  I have to see if Sam feels up to traveling or if he just wants to stay here,”  Dean said.  Cas gave a wry little smile before glancing back towards the hall.
.”  Sam chuckled from the back seat.
“Of what?”  Gabe didn’t smell fear on his brother.
“I don’t feel very well.”  Cas admitted.
“It’s soybean pods.”
“I see the way you cook your burgers too.”  Cas said, smiling around a mouthful of boiled potato.  Dean grinned and ate a piece of the meat.
Gabe swallowed but didn’t answer.  His scent was becoming more and more distressed and he just wanted to soothe him.
“Sam?”  Gabe’s voice was soft and his scent was filled with something that Sam thought was fear.  He lifted his head to look at him.
“Oh, yeah, he’s peachy.  Can we, uh, talk for a minute?”  Dean scratched at his chin as he waited for Gabe to answer.
Cas looked embarrassed and stood twisting the edge of his worn tee shirt nervously.  “I know I should be able to, but…I can’t cook.  I’m sorry!”
Dean’s idea to turn the brothel into a fully functioning police station was on hold until after elections.  The current mayor was eager to make it happen, but city funding was limited.  Dean offered to pay to build the station and his lawyers were already talking to the city council.  The less the city had to pay for, the happier they were, and the more agreeable they were.  It worked for Dean.  As long as they weren’t resisting, he was happy.  In the meantime he was hiring off-duty police officers to patrol the streets at night and over the last six months the crime rate had dropped to lower than anywhere else in the city.
“Well, I’m all for the roller coaster,” The handsome man with the green jacket said. At this distance he could see that the stranger’s eyes were close in color to his coat. He was so lost in those eyes he nearly tuned out their conversation.
“I thought that might be a problem.  I suppose we could be a little late getting home tonight.”
“You’re going to go play, ok, Mama?  Daddy loves you.  Be a good girl.”  Dean kissed his pup’s forehead before handing her over.  The girls ran off in the direction Reeva and Cas had gone.
“Uh, no, pain’s all but gone at this point.”  He flexed his fingers for emphasis.  Gabe nodded, satisfied that at least it wasn’t pain causing his scent to change.
Sam:  White.  I’ll let you decide which one though.
Cas went limp in his arms and for a moment it scared the ever-loving shit out of the Alpha, but then Cas was lifting his arms to wrap them around his mate’s neck.
“Thank you Dean.”
Gabe looked at his hands for a moment, and Sam could see the emotions warring there.  He was trying to resist his instincts to care for the Beta, to resist his attraction and desire to win him over.  Sam set his hands down on the table.
“How?  What law did he break?”  The other man was damn close to growling.  It was quickly pissing Dean off.
He didn’t receive an answer so he called across the hall to Sam’s old room.  Sam and Gabe had been spending no less than four nights a week at the house to help with the girls, and last night they were supposed to have stayed.
Her lips, a brilliant shade of red turned down in a frown before she turned back to Dean.
“You are going to calm down right here, right now, you’re making a scene.  Do.  You.  Understand.  Me?”
“Ok, I want you to take him directly to the hospital.  He’s already pushing five centimeters.  He’ll be even further along by the time you get him there, so hurry.  I’ll meet you there after I finish up these morning appointments.  And I’ll call Tess, tell her to get to the hospital now.”  She took off her glove and tossed it out as Dean helped Cas sit up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas led the way out of the apartment and down the hall to Pam’s.  He knocked on the door and smiled when he heard the pounding of small feet and then Pam hushing them.
“He fucking mated?!”  Gordon snarled, his fangs elongating.  Absolutely terrified now, Cas’ legs gave out and he fell to his knees.  Gordon grabbed the front of his shirt and hauled him back to his feet.  Cas could see the bitter, black hatred in the man’s eyes and he closed his own eyes against it.
After that Dean went into the kitchen to start dinner. Sam wandered in to help. Cas went to their room to try working on the blanket. Gabe had gone to his room and they hadn’t seen him since. Dean pulled fish and chicken from the fridge and held them up.
Cas’ face lit up at the compliment and he was out of the car before Dean could come around to open his door for him.  They joined hands and walked inside.
Gabe took the keys so he could go park the Hummer while Dean and Sam followed the nurses that were taking Cas up to his room.  It was a private room with a huge tub in the center.  Cas’ eyes lit up at the sight of it.
“Hi, sweetheart.  Aren’t you a beautiful girl?”
“Ok, sounds good.”  Cas agreed.
“Nonsense.  I insist.  Is twenty an hour alright?  I expect that we’ll be gone maybe four to six hours.  If we don’t come back to get the pups, my mate will.”
“Around three?  Are you hungry?”  Sam asked.  Dean thought for a moment before nodding.
then we’ll deal with it as it comes.” He hadn’t expected to like this sweet, sensitive Alpha. Were they not being kept against their will in a prison-like setting, he’d have thought Dean to be exactly the kind of Alpha he wanted as his mate.
“No, baby, but I received word they aren’t holding Gordon, and I don’t trust him.”  Dean slipped an arm around his mate’s waist and pulled him closer. “They’re escorting us to the plane, and they’ll inspect it to make sure everything is safe before we board.”
Applause erupted in the studio.  Even the cameraman was clapping.  Molly started at the sound and looked out at the crowd with wide, blue eyes.  Dean held her closer and she buried her face in his neck, seeking comfort from his scent.  Ellie didn’t seem fazed one way or the other and continued to chew on her toy.
By the time Sam had put the girls in their walkers and headed out to the kitchen with them both chasing after, Dean was there, cooking the bacon for the burgers that were on the grill being monitored by Gabe.  Dean looked up, smiling at his brother.
“Yes.  We didn’t suffer very many losses, but a lot of damage was done.  I helped with some of the clean up.  It wasn’t easy.”
“No, this will be fine until…”  Cas bit down on his lower lip as his cheeks flushed.  Dean understood the words he wasn’t saying, the bright smile on his face proving that.
“Come here, darling.”  He led his mate to the futon and made him sit down.  There were still tears in the Omega’s eyes but he was watching Dean with a mixture of need and curiosity.
“Damn, baby, you really needed that release, didn’t you.”  There was no mocking in Dean’s words.  Cas was learning to read his mate better so he just nodded.  Dean’s fingers were still inside of him and he could feel the heat already beginning to coil in his belly for a second time.
Cravings are kicking in, and Cas has a very particular food in mind...
“You keep hinting at something and then completely skirting around it when I ask questions. Just come out and say it, stop screwing with me.” He demanded. His anger petered out and he sat calmly, waiting for Castiel to explain things.
“News about what?  Henry?”
“I like this, being free, not constantly having to worry that another Alpha might jump me and hurt me, or that our pups are in danger.  The fact that everyone works here together makes raising pups so much easier.  Life is easier here.  Safer.”  Cas found Dean’s hand and linked his own with it as they walked along.
“She looks like you, babe.  She’s absolutely perfect.”
Her eyes filled with tears and she used the back of one hand to wipe away as she nodded.
“Gabe had my bag in the truck.  He went and grabbed it for me this morning.  I was reading the news reports, trying to keep my mind off things.”  When Sam looked up at him Dean could see the misery on his face.  He spotted the bag in his brother’s hand and his eyes lit up.  “Is that my medicine?”
Gabe and Sam ate dinner together and retired back to the Alpha’s room to watch a movie together so the kitchen was empty when Dean and Cas finally made their way in for their own dinner.
“You have a visitor, sir, one not cleared to enter the house.  A Samandriel Novak.”
“That you there, Dean?  Or is that Sam?”  A familiar voice was asking.
“You made the appointment for tomorrow?”  Sam asked.  Dean nodded.
“No!  Father said he didn’t end up there!”
Dean moved around to get in behind the wheel but turned to face his mate before starting the car.
He unbuckled Cas’ seat belt and the Omega slid across the seat to wrap his arms around Dean’s neck.  He was still crying and it broke the Alpha’s heart to hear it.  He wrapped the smaller man in his arms and nuzzled into his neck.  He hoped and prayed that Cas wouldn’t make him wait forever.
“Dean, I can’t walk around like this.”  Cas motioned towards the tented gown he still wore.
“Yes I am,” He replied.
“So, how far along is he?”
Dean gave a brief synopsis of what had happened, earning himself a glare from the other Alpha.
“Well,” Cas sighed as he scooped up some of his scrambled eggs. He nudged Dean so he would start eating too. “In two days we’ll see what Sam has to say. All we can do is wait.”
“Lisa, seriously?  We’re in public!” Dean pushed the woman back, his irritation apparent.
“No, of course not,” He lied. Moving the stones had certainly given them a way in but he’d never tell her that. The guilt would eat at her and she was only eight. No child should carry that kind of weight on their shoulders. He’d put the stones back and in the morning he’d have a talk with the kids so they’d know not to touch them again.
“They both ate and talked about cupcakes.  After Cas re-dressed them both.”
“Mischief is watching over you, plus this room is safe.” Cas tried to assure them, though he could still see the fear on their faces. Well, on the girls at least. Jack’s eyelids had already grown heavy and he was struggling to stay awake. Dean soothed his thumb across his son’s brow until they closed and did not open again.
“Good.  His doctor will be here later, and his doula is on her way now.”
“I know, that’s why I got this.  I talked to a lot of people and they thought this would help a lot.”  Dean led him over to the black table on their right.  “This is a hydro massage table.  I or Sam, or heck, even Gabe if he’s here, can help you get up and down from it.  It’s good for circulation, relieving the tension in your back, and will help your aching joints.  It’s safer than the hot baths I know you love.  If you need more of a deep tissue massage, and I was advised to tell you to wait until after the pups are here, that chair over there will help with that.  The table is for later.  I have a masseuse on standby, ready to come and give anyone in the house a massage whenever we need one, but I was thinking more that we’d just set up a schedule.  Want to give it a try?”  Dean rubbed his mate’s back as he spoke and Cas lit up as he described what the table could do.
“Guess we’ll just have to see if we can disprove that theory.”  He cocked the gun, ready to shoot until the Omega he
Cas woke the next morning to bright sunshine streaming through his window.  It was Sunday and as he stretched the memory of the night before came back.  He smiled wide as he pictured Dean’s face, the smattering of freckles across sun kissed skin, bright green eyes framed in long, thick, nearly blonde lashes, full lips that he had so badly wanted to kiss before the man left, dirty blonde hair.  His mind wandered to Dean’s body.  The perfect Alpha body if you asked him.  Broad shoulders, narrow waist, muscular chest (Cas could attest to that, he had touched the man after all), strong legs.  Dean was…perfect.  So kind and thoughtful, and ready to give Cas the world if that was what he desired most.  The Omega was certain that his prayers had finally been answered.
“Absolutely not.  We pay for all of the medical care for our children.  Dean and I would never use anything meant for the city on ourselves.  It’s unethical, and we wouldn’t do anything to negatively impact the budget.  We have plenty of money from Dean’s business, and that is how we are paying for our son’s medical care.”
“Where’s Cas?”
“Hey, Cas, it’s good to see you back here.  Most Omegas leave and don’t think twice about putting this place behind them.  It’s nice to know you still care,”  Paul Kenney said.  Cas smiled and held out one of the eight boxes of bagels so Paul could take one.
“Sweetheart, we’re
“Pancakes sound good?”  Dean asked.
“Cupcake, Daddy?”  she begged.
He heard the door open behind him and turned to see Cas coming out of his bedroom, in the same outfit from the day before.
Cas smiled as he put the phone back in his pocket.  Dean was so wonderful.  Everything he did, everything he said, he was just wonderful.  Still, he wasn’t ready to bend over for the man and let himself be claimed.  If Dean was sincere about allowing him the time he needed to make the decision then he was going to take it.  The idea of mating was still scary.  He had never let another Alpha or Beta close enough to give them the opportunity to even mark him, let alone mate him.  Cas believed in things that might start from a mating connection but went much further, like real love, and a desire to have the other person in your life always.  Maybe even marriage, though that tradition was considered antiquated.  He needed to talk more with Dean, find out exactly what the man expected.  He knew Dean was leaving most of the decisions up to him, but he didn’t want to be a bad mate and think only of himself.  He wanted to make Dean happy too.  Tonight he would talk with his mate when they went to dinner.  Happy with his decision he walked into class.  He couldn’t help the smile he wore for the rest of the day.
A moment later the bell rang and Dean got up to go get the pizza. He peeked through the peephole to make sure someone was on the other side before he opened the door. He knew enough folklore and superstitions to not open that door without verifying that there was indeed a person there.
Dean led his brother over to the bed and once Sam was sitting, he crouched down and pulled the man’s shoes off.  Cas stepped in to pull the covers back and together they tucked Sam in.  The Beta was still fairly heavily sedated, and he sighed as he snuggled back against the pillows and his eyes fluttered shut again.
“You’re kidding, right?  Omegas aren’t violent like that!”  she hissed.
Cas smiled and wrapped his arms around his mate.
“I didn’t think…”  Cas shook his head.  “When did we do it without a condom?”
“I’m still confused. I like him but I’m scared. I don’t want to want an Alpha. The only Alpha I trust explicitly is you. I don’t know that I
Dean laughed.  Gabe was a nut.
“That’s a good question, one we should ask the realtor.” Dean motioned for Cas to pick up the tool bag and then selected a flat head screwdriver. For the next few minutes, he busied himself with scraping the paint away from the edges of where he’d determined the door was. Cas waited patiently and when the door downstairs opened they knew Gabe was back. He jogged up the stairs and popped into the bedroom.
Cas’ eyes lit up.  “Really?  I’d like that.”
“Dean, look at me,"  she said firmly.  He lifted his eyes to meet hers.
Cas took the breath, exhaling slowly as he forced his body to relax.  The finger that breached his rim was much smaller than Dean’s and aside from being a slight bit cold, it didn’t hurt at all.  A second finger was added and then she using her free hand to press down on his abdomen, bringing his cervix lower so she could check it.  She was careful to avoid his prostate, and he was thankful for that.
“It’s ok, I wouldn’t have been happy with anything but this anyway.  This is really good, almost as good as Rosa’s,”  Cas pointed at the rice with his fork.  “How do you like it?”
I apologize for not getting this chapter up Wednesday.  I have been super busy, and I've been having some issues with my younger daughter  She has severe insomnia to start with, it goes along with her ODD and other issues, so she takes Melatonin just to be able to fall asleep.  She's a teenager, so trying to pry her iPod out of her hands is next to inpossible.  I've tried, trust me.  Starting last weekend she started having panic attacks when she would try to close her eyes to go to sleep, and that would snap her back into full wakefulness, and she'd be unable to fall asleep.  This was ongoing all week long, and she was lucky if she was getting an hour or two of sleep at night.  Last night I switched out the Melatonin for something different.  I put her in a different bed in a quieter room, she fell asleep and slept ten straight hours.  Her insomnia and literal hysteria was leaving me very little room to sleep since she would come into my room repeatedly all night long in tears just begging for sleep that wouldn't come.  So I had to focus on her, and I had to do the grocery shopping, and take care of my mother's needs, and I have barely gotten five minutes to sit still in the last week.  Most of my writing has been done on the go, on my phone on Google Docs, but I don't write this fic on there.  I write this one in Word, but I gave up, and started writing it in Docs, it's the only way I was able to get anything written at all.  So, apologies that it is late.  Next chapter is actually in my wonderful beta's hands now, and will be ready for Sunday.  I do hope you like this, and the rest of Alfie's visit.
“Oh God, I want you so bad, Cas.”  Dean surged forward, his mouth finding Cas’, tongue already seeking and finding that of the smaller man.  Cas groaned and Dean growled approvingly as he walked the man back towards the bed.
“Yes, it is.”  He looked over at Cas.  The Omega’s expression was neutral; however, Dean could feel a mixture of emotions rolling off the man in waves.  He was
“I’ll see her out.”  Sam said, and followed Tess out of the room.
“We still have to weigh them.  What is this pup’s name?”
“Did you want something to eat?  Should I grab one of your shakes?”  Gabe asked.
“I know,” She pulled out a second bottle. “Why don’t we start in the room where the kids are?”
“Of course, sweetheart.  We’ll leave as soon as the police get here.”  He guided his mate through a door at the back of the lobby and down a narrow hall.  There were doors on either side and Dean stopped in front of one.  He turned the knob and the door swung open, revealing a breakroom.
Dean lifted his head and looked at his mate as he turned as much as he could to meet his eye.
“What message?  He left a message?  Did you know this, Dean?  Is that what got you so upset earlier?”  Cas turned to his mate, who reluctantly nodded.
“Help,” She begged. “Please let me in, I’m scared.” There was something wrong about her voice, and the darkness rolled off her in waves. Though it seemed impossible that she would be looking up at them from eyes so empty and black, they seemed to brim with a hunger that was terrifying, even to two grown men such as themselves. To Cas’ shock Dean opened the door all the way and stared down at her.
“I know, but I’m just letting you know.  He’s a bit jumpy, some Alpha grabbed him last weekend and he’s been kind of tense ever since.”  Jo lowered her voice as she told him this, glancing around to make sure no one else was within earshot.
“Absolutely not.  I already notified my lawyer Chuck and he is going down first thing in the morning to file the paperwork making me your legal guardian.  It’s a formality unfortunately since clearly you don’t require a guardian, but it’s a necessity so that you and I both are not arrested.  When, and if you decide to accept me as your mate then the guardianship can be terminated and you will have equal rights with me.  Chuck is very good at what he does and by tomorrow afternoon everything will be in place and you will never have to return to the District again.”  Dean explained.  He motioned for Cas to follow him.
“No, a Beta.  He’s a lawyer but after a failed relationship he came back to stay with me and go back to school.  It’s a long story about him and mates, but we have an agreement that he finish this degree first.  He’s been dating another Beta, pretty girl, so I think he shot that rule out the window,"  he  laughed.
“Ok.  So I went ahead and set up an appointment for tomorrow with Doctor Sanders.  She will do the initial exam for the pups and then give the referral for a pediatrician.  There are three that I can think of that are like her, respectful and caring of Omegas.  I know she’ll recommend one of them.  She’ll make sure you’re in good hands,”  Tess told them.
Dean takes time with their new pups so Cas can focus on Aidan.  Their tiniest pup isn't cleared right away to leave the hospital, and when he is, he has to have round the clock nurse.  Cas and Dean make the necessary adjustments to raising six pups, and the rest of the pack steps in to help, each one taking a day to stay with the new parents and help Cas maintain his sanity.
“Not at all.  The last of the apartment buildings are now finished being remodeled, a park and a community garden was added along with cameras on every street corner.  By this time next year there will be a fully functional police station in the center of The District, and nineteen new businesses have leases and of those nineteen, twelve are already open.  Crime has dropped from roughly ninety three percent down to two percent since we began making the necessary changes.  That’s phenomenal.  Crime has never dropped so fast and so low anywhere else in the country.  We hope this kind of change will continue and that Omegas everywhere will someday know the same peace, safety, and equality that we are striving to achieve here,”  Dean replied.
“Good, but I still want our first time to be on a bed, not with you bent over a desk.”  Dean ground against him again, making the Omega whimper.
“We’re doing great, or at least I think we are.  I’m not letting him claim me though.  Yet.”  Sam felt his cheeks heating up and Dean knew better than to tease him, even though he really wanted to.
So....yeah.  No claim yet (Give Sam time, he isn't quite there with the trust), but they're at the next level for their relationship.  I do hope you all enjoyed this chapter.  Leave a comment!
“I’m guessing Cas won the challenge?”  Sam raised an eyebrow as he waited for an answer.
“Here, take Evie.  I’ll go get them.”  Dean handed the pup back to Cas and got up to go find out who was crying upstairs.
Cas nodded.  At that moment he wanted to be anywhere Alistair wasn’t.
“Anything you want, sweetheart.  I did some thinking today too.  I decided to hire some more people to work under Charlie.  People that I can send out to investigate discrepancies with inventory or the accounting, and to handle any issues with the shops themselves and equipment.  It will cut down on my need to travel so that I can be home more with you and our pup.  So if you go back to work, I’ll be home.  I’d rather our kids be raised by us than nannies,”  Dean said.
Cas chuckled as he watched Sam hurry from the room. The Beta sure did move quickly.
“It’s…”  Cas grunted and grimaced as he rubbed at his lower abdomen.  “Normal.  Do you have something for pain that I could take?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“We’re doing well, thank you for asking.”  Cas said, politely.
“Oh, that feels so weird,”  Cas said.  Dean sat up a little more so he could look over his mate’s shoulder.
“I abhor liars.”
“Babe, seriously?  Even at home our pups are always supervised.  There are always wolves on guard watching the perimeter.  Pups are always safe here.  The pack would die to protect them.  Bears don’t stand a chance.”  Dean replied.  Cas relaxed and nodded.  His mate was right.
“Like chocolate or vanilla?”
“Order anything you want.  Money is not a problem.”  Dean told him.
“I hope he called Forsythe and not Sunshine.  I don’t want Becky in my house.”
Gabe could feel how heavily his mate was leaning upon him.  His heartbeat had slowed down and his trembling had finally stopped.  He knew the anxiety meds had finally kicked in.  Sam was calm, so whatever decision he made, it would not be done in a panic.  He stroked his mate’s back gently.
“Sammy had a mate.  His mate…”  He clenched his jaw again.  “Abused him.  So he came back to me to protect him.  So I am.”
“It was his time.  We will mourn now, but we will honor his memory.  Doricus, select six youths to go to the burial grounds and begin digging.  We must bury him before other creatures begin gathering.”
She turned to Cas and hugged him even tighter.  “Thank you, brother.  For the first time in years I feel
“I need you to arrange for Benny to go up and train Dennis to take over.  I want Benny to make it clear that under no circumstances is he to continue running the place the way Gordon was.  Maybe you can go with,”  Dean said.  Charlie nodded.
Dean grinned and looked at his mate.  Cas was practically beaming.  He looked back at Michael again.
“Well,” Dean said thoughtfully. “Food would run out pretty quick and we’d be forced to leave anyway, so I’d probably dress in the thickest clothing I have, fill my camping backpack with as much food and water as I can carry, grab my rifle and ammo and leave, before the hoards showed up.”
“Dean?  It’s time to go pick Cas up.”
.  You are no better than a Beta or an Omega.  Without them a pack would be nothing.  You failed your duties as an Alpha, and now you stand before us to face punishment for your transgressions.”
“No, it must have been a mistake, I must have just had a really slow heartbeat and they thought I was dead.” He just refused to believe that he’d died. It must have been a mistake. Sam would be so mad…
“Give me a sec here, gorgeous,”  He said as he withdrew his hand.  It took him a moment to get the box of condoms open with slippery fingers and even longer to get one on, but he managed, and as he looked up at Sam he stroked one lubed hand down his own length in preparation.  God it had been years since he’d taken a lover and eager didn’t even cover how he felt at the moment.  Excited or not, he needed to be gentle with Sam.  Sam was watching him, gently stroking the Alpha’s thigh as he waited patiently for him to get himself ready.
“Pretty good, actually.”  Cas replied.
“I’m going over the accounting for the one of the shops in Tulsa.  The numbers aren’t adding up.  I think either someone is stealing money or someone isn’t doing inventory right.”
“How are you feeling, sweetheart?”  Dean had been handed a second pup, so now he was cuddling Alex and Kate.
“Are we ready?  It’s time to get into our places.”  Dean said once she was done fussing over him too.  He looked down at his bare feet.  Another piece of tradition.  Those that lived here in the forest still did not wear coverings on their feet, except in the winter when boots were made from leathers and fur left over from hunts.  He liked being barefoot.  It felt natural.
Every two hours the girls were waking up.  By noon Cas was more exhausted than he had been after giving birth, and he was in tears.  Sam came to the rescue after Dean came staggering down to the kitchen in search of coffee.  Gabe stopped him and called for Sam.
“Please, Mr. Winchester, you need to calm down, you’re upsetting your mate!”  The doctor snapped.  Dean bared his teeth for a moment before he began to pace.  He couldn’t calm down, not when he could still feel his mate’s terror.  Cas was afraid he’d just lost the pups.  Dean was scared of losing his mate.  Calm down?  Ha!  The doctor was nuts!
“No, no hassle.  We’re family anyway.  Well, the only family I want anything to do with now.  I’ll text you my address.  I’ll put my car in the drive so you can park that behemoth of yours in my garage along with Sam’s truck, that way if that creep is cruising around he won’t see them,”  Gabe told him.
“So Dean says you’re Cas’ brother?” she asked around a bite of muffin.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“It could.  Just to play devil’s advocate though, it could make society think he’s just pumping out pups because that’s what Omegas do.  I would have Cas speak up about it, quell any rumors or negative theories as to why, after only six months, your mate is pregnant again.  Let the world know that you always wanted a big family, and that you have the means both monetarily and emotionally to support your family, and let them know that you are an active participant in raising your pups.  Take the girls out places, like shopping or to the park.  Plus, Cas will much appreciate the quiet and time to rest.  He’s going to need it.  Did you see the circles under his eyes?  He’s exhausted.  I sent him to bed for a nap.”  Sam said.
Cas moved so that he was straddling his mate.
“Alright.  I’m going to go change.  I’ll be down in about ten or fifteen minutes.  I still need to let Dean know I’m leaving.”
Cas left the laundry room and headed down to the kitchen to make up a tray of meats and cheeses for their guest.  When Dean walked in the house with Alfie fifteen minutes later they were chatting amicably about his brother’s job.
“Water broke,”  Tess explained.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you done with work for the day?”  Cas asked as they started for the stairs.  He hadn’t left the second floor in close to two months, and it took him a few minutes to get down them.
“On Thursday, August twenty ninth I was touring through The Omega District with my husband and mate, Castiel Winchester, and my brother in law Gabriel Novak when we were caught off guard by Alistair Crane, an Alpha that was stalking and harassing my mate against his will for close to a year now.  He had no claim on my mate, and Castiel had, on multiple occasions denied his advances.  When I met Castiel it was apparent immediately that he was my true mate.”
They got their food and Cas led Dean over to the table. Every Omega at the table growled, save for Cas.
“Water birth?” she asked as she set her bags down.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve been better, but right now, doing good,” he replied.  She looked up, the concern she felt etched across her features.
Gabe:  Ok, make it thirty and I’ll be there.
“Alistair escaped the hospital he was being treated at some time last night or early this morning,” he said.  He wasn’t sure what kind of reaction he was expecting from his mate, but for Cas to remain perfectly still, his eyes now locked on the backyard where it lay beyond the sliding doors, was not it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Of course.  I’m used to being hungry; I just know you don’t like for me to be.”  Cas replied.  The engines were starting and Dean walked over to his mate, pulling the pliant Omega firmly against him.
“Stop talking about our sex life,”  Cas mumbled.  He cracked one eye open, spotting Charlie.  “Hey.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam picked up one of the baby monitors and turned it on.
“Fuck that’s hot,”  Dean growled as he stood up and dropped his own pants.  Cas slipped as he scrambled to turn over and present, his hand sliding across the cushion from the slick.  Dean caught him and pulled him back before he face planted on the couch and pulled Cas back against him.
Alan pointed to a blonde wolf that was sitting with a group, including Dean’s mate and all six of his pups.  Cas was sitting on the floor, leaning back against Jo and trying to contain Molly and Ellie.  The Omegas from the hot spring were sitting with him, and they were holding his other four pups.  Dean hurried over and dropped to his knees.  Cas threw his arms around his mate’s neck and hugged him.
Cas sat up a little straighter.  There was anger blazing in those blue orbs.  “What happened?  Why won’t anyone tell me
“Oh, he was only here to bring me lunch.  He had to get back to his shop.  Can I talk to you about something?”  Sam sat down at the island and looked up at his brother.
“He asked to watch the news, so we turned it on.  They were recapping a speech I did right after my inauguration, and he just…burst into tears.  When I asked him what was wrong he cried harder, saying he was fat,”  Dean explained.  She looked up at him, her eyes narrowing.
It didn’t take Dean long to respond.  No matter where Dean was, he always replied quickly.
“I’ll get them.”  Dean reached into his brother’s pocket, fishing the keys out and handing them over.  “Thanks again, Gabe, for everything,” he said.  Gabe accepted the keys and nodded.
“Oh yeah, Sam’s in heaven right about now.”  Dean laughed.
She squirmed to be let down, so Dean did, and she hurried back to be with the other pups.
“There are roughly sixteen of us.  Omegas get sold off right after they present,” he said.
He smiled as he looked at Claire’s pumpkin. They’d given her markers and she’d done her best to create a scary pumpkin face. It looked more like a sad dog but that was ok. Emma’s was just scribbles but she was incredibly proud of it. This was her first pumpkin and she loved it. He wasn’t looking forward to her reaction later when it began to rot but that was a concern for later.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Shit!  Get the car!”  Dean raced outside with two of his security staff and scrambled to get into the back of the Hummer.  He held his mate, checking to make sure he was still breathing and had a pulse while trying to ignore the blood that covered the man.  It was a longer ride to the hospital since they were coming from The District but the moment they pulled up at the emergency room, Dean was jumping out, his mate still cradled close to his chest.
“I can buy enough stock to have things bend to my will.  It’s sneaky, but business owners do it all the time.  Might be able to push for more clean energy too,”  Dean replied.  Cas set the tablet aside and moved closer, wrapping his arms around his mate and squeezing him tight.
Tess smiled as she wrote the pup’s name down.  “That’s beautiful.”
“Anything that has the potential to heal my pup, I’m game to try.  I just want him to grow up healthy and strong.”
Cas was crossing the parking lot with two of the security staff, and Dean got out to hold the door for him.
“It’s not against the law, and I certainly feel more like a Winchester than I do a Novak,”  Gabe said.
“Yes, Meg, he has been nothing but a gentleman.  I feel safe with him.”  He pushed past her and entered the building, but she was right on his heels.
A police investigation was launched but Enid said Theodore had left her, and she had no idea where he’d gone. When he didn’t turn up and there were no signs of foul play the investigation went cold. In 1977 it was closed.
“I will talk to Dean and learn about Skype.  From there I will try to assist the best I can.  Not everyone gets Shakespeare, but once a child can comprehend what he is trying to convey in his work, it’s like a lightbulb goes off.”  Cas loved Shakespeare, and he would derive much pleasure from assisting Victor’s son, even if he did it long distance.
“That means he is going to face a tribunal for the crimes he committed.  We have no say over the outcome. Sam does,” Dean explained.  Gabe stared at him for a moment.
It was closer to an hour and a half before Elizar arrived.  By that time Charlie had already left and Gabe had arrived.  Dean had gone back to his office while Cas had headed to his sewing room.  He’d bought more material and was busy making curtains for the babies’ room when the buzzer for the front gates rang through the house.  He turned off the sewing machine and hauled himself up from his chair to waddle back into the kitchen.  Dean was just walking in with a man Cas had never met before when he arrived.  The man was a Beta and talking animatedly to Dean about the food he had brought.  Cas detected an accent.  The smell of the food reached him and his stomach growled.  Dean looked up, noticing he was there and held out a hand to him.
“Yeah, I’m working on that!” Dean looked around them, they were in a small drug store that was completely cleaned out. There was a door behind the counter, which could lead to a back exit, but that was a questionable risk. Even if it did, there is no way of knowing if there’s more of these guys back there.
The journey to the city was surprisingly uneventful. He was expecting or perhaps hoping there were some angels in their way to fight. He wanted to take his frustration out on something.
He bit his bottom lip as the realization and panic started to creep in his mind. They were trapped and being attacked by some weird rabid off-brand humans, and he still had no idea where Jack and his mom were.
Naturally, he wouldn’t admit that, even though he was completely lost.
It all clicked in an instant.
Dean didn’t look to see if Ketch was following him, he didn’t really care. It took a few minutes for him to find a clearing, revealing they were standing on a ridge that overlooked a city. Well, what looked like used to be a city. Most large buildings had fallen, and everything else was in ruins. It seemed completely abandoned. Since he was under the impression that the angels have leveled any human creation, Dean was surprised any cities were left in this world.
I hope you liked this chapter and the little call back to 'Yellow Fever' I did there!
He only stopped running when he heard a loud explosion. He turned around to see the building he just ran out of completely engulfed with flames.
He couldn’t say he liked Ketch, but he didn’t want him dead. He only said that to Sammy to convince him he didn’t actually care what happened to him. Or maybe to convince himself.
“Hello Dean.”
Before he could fully comprehend the situation he was in, the men behind him had enough, and the butt of a gun was slammed into his head, and he fell to the ground.
They were in a forest, which was not expected. He wasn’t sure if they would have been brought to the same location of the last rift, but he was hoping he would at least be in the same region. But instead of the barren oversized sandbox he saw before, they were encircled with trees and rocky grounds.
“Apologies. Although you didn't properly brief me on what type of environment we would be finding ourselves in.” Ketch stood up and offered a hand to Dean, which was never taken. Dean huffed and stood up on his own, taking in his surroundings.
He had just left Ketch there to die.
Dean found himself waking up in a bed, although comfortable wouldn't be the word he’d use to describe it. Definitely, since his hands were bound above his head and secured to the headboard with handcuffs. He pulled against the restraints trying to judge how sturdy the wood was, but the marks already carved there proved others have been bound here and failed to break through. He gave up on that for a moment to scan the room he was trapped in.
“What?!” Dean snapped as he spun around to glare at Ketch, only to see his eyes were focused on something behind him. He let his own eyes follow Ketch’s gaze, slowly turning around.
Dean wasn’t too far behind him, only slowing down to throw a few unaimed shots in the direction of the hostiles. He hoped it would at least slow them down, but they didn’t even flinch. Their mindless violent behavior seemed vaguely familiar to Dean, but he couldn't put it together. Especially when the bastards were quickly catching up to them.
They walked through the city, scanning the broken roads searching for anything that seemed usable. Mostly everything seemed too beat up to work.
The door opened and Dean froze.
“Too many! They just keep coming!” Ketch paused for a moment to reload his gun and then resumed shooting. “Dean, I will run out of ammo before killing them all. We need to get out of here!”
He turned to Ketch, who positioned himself under the window, and continued to shoot at whatever the hell those things were. “How many are out there!?”
“And If we do, where exactly would we be going? You do remember we only have twen-”
The lighting was coming from a few candles scattered around the room. The wall directly in front of him was lined with what looked like a bookshelf, but instead was the home for a collection of weapons. There was a huge map of America on the wall to the right of him, with a few scribbles, circles and X’s on it. Directly under that was a small round table that was cluttered with papers and an overfilled astray in the middle.
“Seriously!?” Dean growled as he sat up, brushing the dirt off his jacket.
“This place looks familiar.” Ketch said, thinking out loud.
“Just hold on a minute!” He looked around again and decided to start towards the top of the hill they fell down on, to get a better understanding of where they are. “Come on.”
What drew Dean's attention was the faded brown leather jacket that was swung over the chair next to the table. The same jacket he wore for years, and his father wore for longer. He turned his attention back to the handcuffs above him. He wasn't given much time to work on escaping, because after a minute or so he heard footsteps. He bit his lower lip, preparing himself for whoever was coming.
Dean didn’t realize he was just standing in the middle of the street, until the man in the truck looked over at him. He couldn’t see any features of the man from this far away, but he did see him talk into something and point right at him. Before he could assess the situation, he felt the muzzle of a gun be pressed against his skull. He brought his hands up slowly as he listened, counting at least two other footsteps that came up from behind him. After a second, the one closest to him spoke sternly. “Were you bled on?”
Just over 15 pairs of eyes stared back at them, standing only about 100 feet away. After only a few seconds, a few more appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. There was something off about them, but Dean couldn’t quite figure out what it was. They didn’t seem like angels, they weren’t high and mighty enough. Although, they didn’t seem all that human either.
At first, he thought maybe Ketch brought some kind of bomb with him. He wouldn’t have been surprised, it wouldn't have been the first time. But just a few hundred feet away from the building, Dean spotted a dark green pick up truck. After a moment, a man stood up from the bed of the truck and shot off another projectile just in front of the building, causing another explosion.
“I need to be back there with him, my mate needs me.”  He sat up straight and looked down the hall.
Instinct urged him to slam back in, to take his potential mate fast and hard, but logic and desire overruled that. Grabbing Sam’s hips he began a slow, steady rhythm, reveling in the tight heat surrounding him.  He let out a moan, loving how good it felt while wishing he could have a million more moments just like this.
God, had some sick fucks hurt Cas?!
His eyes widened.
"And I don't need you glaring at me! Quit making me feel bad for giving a damn about you! If your family was worried you'd let 'em be! You wouldn't give them crap! Hell, you never give them crap! You let them do whatever they want!"
Cas rolled his eyes, "Dean, ejaculation means to voice your opinions quickly- what on earth are you thinking of that makes it so humorous?"
Dean blushed, moving his chin from the gentle touch. “
Cas' smile grew as Dean stood up, Dean made him so happy, Dean he got up from the couch, inserting 'Aladdin'- according to Sam it was a funny movie, Dean had never seen it- into the DVD player. He sat back on the couch and Cas smiled at him, Dean smiled in return, before Cas scoffed closer to him, causing his smile to grow.
He was- he was being hugged.
“So, for dinner tonight we may have-“
Castiel made a soft noise as Dean pressed his lips against his own. Cas' tongue slowly poked out, asking for permission. Dean greeted him and they deepened the kiss, long, and slow, full of compassion and ease.
"Well you just drove us to the pet store and back, I trust you. But I also don't want an unlicensed driver alone in my car when in trying to become a nurse." She smiled, "You drive, and I'll disappear when we get there."
"No."
He looked at his hands, one clasped tightly around the other. Castiel had never been particularly fond of conversing with Naomi. Quite frankly, she frightened him. His sister made him uncomfortable, the air of condescension and disgust she used when speaking with him was hurtful and obvious.
The smiles vanished with the sunny sky as Naomi closed the door, enveloping then in darkness.
once in a while?" He asked harshly.
Castiel ran to the bathroom, his lungs were burning- the only thing he was filled with was acid and pain. He was choking on his own vomit. He threw himself over the toilet, praying he made it.
How much time had he and Dean truly spent together? Castiel hated himself for being curious about Dean's father- he would never ask- but he was. From the short time he had been in Bobby Singer's presence, Cas had been able to tell the man had a great influence on Dean's life.
"I just..." he sighed, "I do not know how to explain this. I care for Dean- greatly- but I am afraid of what he entails."
Cas and Anna deal with a few family issues, Dean does his best to help.
"Cas told you about dad?" Gabriel said with a frown.
"A-A-Anna?" Her brother said with a sniffle.
He met his eyes, "...Dean said 'I think I might just love you.'"
Naomi had always been one to dismiss Anna's request, why Castiel was never quite sure of. This feeling was also shared by Michael, they did not show her the disrespect they showed Castiel, no one deserved that- but there was an unspoken level of tension between the two and Anna, tension he had never understood.
His smirk grew, "Did you?"
Castiel felt his cheeks heat up, and looked down once more. Wonderful, now he had most certainly hurt Dean's feelings, the only person he had met who had ever actually shown any margin of interest in him.That's what he got, trying to make friends; didn't he know he always screwed everything up?
"Can't," he said, dismissing the request. "Need to study, quiz next hour."
"So you guys don't have any kind of thing going on?"
Julia
Ellen lifted her shoulders, “No harm in checkin’ in on ya.”
His frown grew, "'Holy this' 'holy that'? What an odd catchphrase."
Gabriel sighed, "Anna, despite your genius theories, you staring out the window will not make Cas come home any sooner."
Castiel glared at him, "What are you trying to tell me, Dean?" He said, dark, icy eyes daring him to further voice his opinions.
"It's obvious these thoughts upset you. But Castiel you have to realize that they are just that: thoughts. And you don't have to believe those thoughts."
He wrenched his hand free of Castiel's jaw, causing Cas to stumble backwards, his back hitting the brick wall before he fell in the snow. February had been filled with sleet and snow so far, and it was especially unfortunate right now. Cas' rosary almost slipped out of his jeans pocket, but Castiel caught the necklace before Crowley could notice.
Cas shrugged, looking both ways before the two males and the german shepherd crossed the street.
“Castiel, do you mind if I ask you something?”
Really it was dad’s chair, but he wasn’t here. Dean took full advantage of this and happily made the chair his own. Sam looked up at him from the small kitchen table, where he was planning ideas for an essay that wouldn’t be due for another two weeks.
"What are you talking about?"
Castiel frowned, but Dean wasn't finished and continued speaking.
Dean sighed, shaking his head, "Families, man. Dealing with them ain't easy, never has been and it never will."
“Well, actually, Anna almost gave me a literal push but I find the guinea pigs’ effective, logical arguing skills and big eyes were the final argument leading me to my conclusion.”
"Well, actually, we could right now- my dad's friend, Bobby, he has a car garage. He's fixing a bunch of 'em up, and some are already done. Guy lets me take one out for a test drugs now and then, 'm sure he wouldn't mind if I asked."
but you're not
"Would you have preferred Lynyrd? Like, Lynyrd Skynyrd?"
at m-me!"
Castiel shrugged, "Despite our minuscule age difference, I must admit we do have a higher sense of knowledge when concerning high school, which is terrible. Particularly our junior year, which was insufferable. You and Jess shall be gifted, neither of you shall have to interact with Dick."
Castiel looked up at his sister, and he saw the pain in her eyes, he nodded, “Yes, I believe that would be wise and prove beneficial for the both of us.”
Dean chuckled, "Cas, I was just teasing."
He tapped Cas on the shoulder who turned around, "Cas, I don't think you get it- I'm not letting you do the dishes."
Castiel's thinking was that perhaps if he did not look over at Dean, Crowley would not either, and he would be left alone. However, Castiel's wishes so rarely come true, and of course, the English man looked over to Dean, who had still not said a word.
a problem." Castiel glared at him. "I understand you are unhappy with where your life is going but that does not mean I am the obstacle in your way."
"You've seen him, you've been here, he kills people because he doesn't care. He takes kids because more for his cult or whatever the hell this, and he doesn't care."
Dean laughed again, "Haha, Cas- ha, oh, poor Cas. Lynyrd Skynyrd's just a band name too, no one in the band has that name, and when they named the band they didn't know anyone with that name."
She looked at him, panicked, "I-I don't know! He just- I think someone wouldn't leave him alone!"
“Yes, have a good night.”  Cas added as they left.
“I would love to come and visit.  Maybe before we return to Houston.”  Michael looked between Cas and Dean, both of whom nodded.
“No!” Cas exclaimed as he slapped the frosting spatula down on the counter. “We hired an exterminator and he found nothing!
Dean scratched at the back of his neck and looked nervously at the floor.  There was a pink tint to his cheeks that Cas found adorable.
“Alright.  And our lawyers are here?”  Cas looked around, spotting Chuck talking to someone, and Sam was on the other side of him.
“What’s your name?"  he asked.
“Yeah, forensics is still going over everything. I’m sorry this even happened,” she said.
“Apparently Jude is frightened of Alphas.  He was harassed like me for years, except he was mated and still being bothered.  He is extending an olive branch here by coming with his mate for dinner and agreeing to meet Dean.  Once he realizes Dean isn’t like other Alphas, we can explain that neither are you and see if we can’t get him to agree to meet you too.  Since we haven’t met him yet, we have no idea what he is like, or just how sensitive he is.  I think a lot of it comes down to stress that comes along with a high risk pregnancy.  They lost a pup a number of years ago and tried so hard for years since to conceive Dahlia.  She’s their little miracle.  I don’t think they’ll be having any more after her.”  Cas didn’t want his brother’s feelings to be hurt, but he felt protective over Jude.  As a fellow Omega, he wanted to make the man feel safe and welcome in his home.
“Everything looks great, but we don’t want to know what the pups are.  We’re looking forward to a surprise.  I’ll show you the nursery when we’re done here.  Sam’s friend came and did the mural after we had the room painted; we got the second crib and the rest of the furniture.  Cas raced through the first blanket he was making so that he could start on a second one.  He thought he’d be able to take his time with the first one, but nope.”  Dean snickered as he pulled up another chair.  Charlie was already typing away on the computer.  It was tax season and while he had an accountant, she always came to help with going over it all before they let the accountants have it.  He was so thorough throughout the main part of the year that the chance of embezzling from him was close to nonexistent, and he wanted to maintain that fear in the people he employed.  It kept them honest.  He had fired people in the past for stealing from him, and people much higher up than just Gordon.
"Uh..." her eyes flickered to something behind her. “I might need some help."
"Castiel I thi-
"I don't want to say anything I'll regret," Cas said defensively.
Cas frowned, turning from his spot on the floor against the bed, "Because he wanted to come around Christmas."
"Gee, if Cas were here to hear this."
Mordecai turned his attention to Gabe.  “Alpha Gabriel, what say you?”
“So you want to bring the pups in front of the cameras or just you and me?”  Cas asked.
Dean was more relaxed as the plane descended, still riding high on the post sex endorphins, and Cas was glad.  He didn’t like seeing his mate upset.  The flight wasn’t bad at all for his first time and when the plane came to a stop and Dean opened the door, his eyes widened.  He’d never seen such a large airport anywhere but in books.  Stairs were rolled up to the door and Dean took his hand as they went down them.
“What do you think they’ll look like?” he asked as he caressed his mate’s belly.  It was getting bigger every day.  As Cas laid out next to him he could actually see it now.  His mate was going to be
“Yeah?”
“Alarm is turning itself off,”  Gabe explained.
“I will come back to see you and give you a phone number so you can call me if you ever need me.”
“Becky’s this off the wall Omega.  She’s not mentally stable, even in the slightest.  She met my brother at school.  She worked in one of the gift shops, and Sam walked in with a couple of his friends one afternoon.  One look at my brother and she became obsessed.  Ever since she’s been popping up in places where she knows she’ll run into my brother.  His favorite coffee shop, the stores he frequents, etc.  She tells him that she loves him and that one day they’ll be mates.  She creeps both my brother and me out.  I heard she started working for Sunshine Cleaning Services a few months back.  I’m not sure Sam knows that though.”
!”  Cas could smell the anger and resentment pouring off the woman in waves but his own anger was growing.  Before he could react though Dean was on his feet, glaring down at the Beta.  His stance screamed Alpha as he loomed over the woman, fangs bared, still growling.  Everyone in the restaurant had stopped to watch the events unfolding.  The staff stood frozen near the kitchen.  A challenge, no matter who it was between was, by law, not to be interfered with.  It was clear to everyone that Lisa was challenging Cas, but Dean was not permitting it.
“Identifiable as female.  Neither one has a penis,”  Cas looked at his mate.
“Something funny.  I don’t think I could handle anything scary right now,”  Cas said, his voice barely above a whisper.  Dean kissed his mate’s head before searching through the comedies.  He decided maybe a romantic comedy might ease Cas’ worries.  He’d never admit that he liked RomComs too.  Settling on “27 Dresses,” they relaxed and got involved in the movie plot.
“Sounds good,”  Gabe replied.
When Cas emerged from the shower, he looked tired rather than embarrassed.  Dean helped him get dressed and, taking his mate by the hand, they left, heading out to the lobby.  Alan was on the phone when he walked in, giving orders, and he nodded towards the door, indicating the men he’d called in for added security.
“Puerto Rican food?”  Dean frowned.  Did he know anyone Puerto Rican?  He pulled out his own phone. “Let me make a few calls, see if I can’t scrounge at least something up for you while you wait for Rosa to call you.”
“Call Gabe.  Maybe he knows a safe place,”  Cas urged.
“Cupcake, Daddy?”  Ellie asked as she ran over to him.
Out of the bedroom, Dean headed towards the back door as he pulled his phone out and accepted the call.
Cas stroked her hair and just as she’d done as a tiny pup, she turned her face into his hand and sniffed it, scenting him.
Comments are always welcome, you all know I love them.  I hope you liked this chapter.  I love you guys, I truly do!
“You’re tired and stressed out.  I’m trying to help, so turn around and relax.”  Cas replied.  Dean smiled and turned back around.  Slowly the tension began to bleed out of his body and he relaxed completely.  Jo, Donna, and several older pups from the village helped Reeva to get the younger pups settled.  Molly and Ellie were ushered outside to run and play with pups their age, and Dean didn’t even care that they were dressed only in their diapers.  Reeva spoke with Jo and Donna for a moment quietly, and whatever she said, they were both agreeing to it.
“With regular feedings you will begin to regain your color. You've already begun to do so. As I said, your skin will no longer look ashen and the blood vessels in your eyes will shrink so your eyes will begin to look normal again. After that you will slowly begin to regain feeling. It might be like pins and needles for a while but it doesn’t last long. That’s your nervous system fully waking up again. It’s a slow process so learning to control your urges is vital to your survival.”
“You made him very happy, you know that, right?  He didn’t get a whole lot when we were kids.  Everything he has now, he bought.  Even the littlest of gifts make him insanely happy.  He’s going to find an excuse to use that thing all the time.  Don’t be surprised if he walks around with it on his shoulders like a cape.”  Sam snickered and shook his head.  Dean was a big kid sometimes, but after not getting to enjoy his own childhood, he deserved to have fun now and then.
“The cafeteria food is rather substandard.  Only about the same quality as the TV dinners I would eat,”  Cas replied.
“Yeah, hindsight is 20/20,”  Dean chuckled.
“Where do you think Honor was buried?” Dean whispered so as not to interrupt their tour guide.
“Stay here,” she instructed.  He and Gabe watched as she sent her men around to the back of the house.
“He wanted to know exactly what she’d said, and how she’d appeared. I knew my mom had died at night during a house fire but no one had ever told me what she’d been wearing that night. I didn’t see her in her nightgown because my dad said she hadn’t gotten dressed for bed until after she’d put me and my brother down for the night. When the fire broke out my dad shook me awake and shoved Sam in my arms. I was told to get outside, so I did. When I described her to him though...he burst into tears. She’d come to me in the same white nightgown she’d worn the night she died, though blessedly without the burns.
“Well, it makes her costume unique, I think,” Cas tilted his head as he studied Emma. “Yes, I believe the sparkles really bring it all together.”
“What is your name?” Castiel asked.
“It’s alright.  Your hormones are in overdrive right now, so it’s normal.”  She patted his knee as she withdrew her hands.  “Come on, sit up.  One more set of glands to check along with your mating mark.”
“You sent them to explore the rest of the place and look for squatters, remember?”  Gabe said calmly in his ear.  They were alone, defenseless, save for the gun hidden on Dean’s belt.  There was no way he’d get a shot off without endangering Cas.  He could feel his mate’s terror.  The sneer on Alistair’s face was sending him into a black rage, his need to save and protect his mate was overwhelming, but with Gabe holding him back he couldn’t move.  He roared so loud his men came racing, all freezing as they ran into the room.
“There are some snacks you can munch on while you’re knotted.  How does that sound?”  He purred against his mate’s ear, an invitation to the man to begin undressing, which Cas immediately did.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Classes start at nine, so I believe I should leave here by eight fifteen as I don’t quite know my way there from here.  It has to be a much further drive too.”  Cas replied.
“I’ll go get you something,”  Dean told him.
“That is acceptable.  I just…I miss my kids, and I need to work to get my mind off things.”  Cas brought a hand down to press gently against his belly.  It was still amazing knowing there was life growing in there.
Cas held up the two bags he’d brought.  “I brought enough food for us both.”
“Papa!” she was calling out.  Ellie was looking up at Dean and Sam.  Dean knelt down in front of her and turned Kate so Ellie could see her.
“One last thing, Alpha Luke.  It is the one that you transgressed against that will decide your fate.  Your need to control, to dominate and force another to submit in the cruelest of ways possible will now be the factor that will weigh in Samuel’s decision.”  She turned to head back to her seat.
“You know, we’re setting up scholarships for Omegas, so they can earn college degrees and bring in more money for their families.  I’ll get you the information.  I want you to look into it, and have him apply.  If he gets in, Cas and me, we’ll help you guys out until he graduates and can land a job where he’s really contributing financially.  Does he know what he would get a degree in?”  Dean asked.
“It’s Gabe,”  Sam replied.
“So, just…move slow?”
“I was terrified to be honest, but that was back when he was kind and gentle with me.  He went slow, and it was actually really good.  I can’t say it always was after that though.”
“What happened?”
“What the hell is a teacher doing servings tables here?"  he wondered.
“Hey Sammy,”  Dean said as he walked in.  Sam looked up in relief when he spotted his brother.
“My back is aching,”  Cas whined as he made his way down to the first floor.  He rubbed at it but it wasn’t helping.  “Dean!”
“No, not at all, but…it just makes me worry more about you being out and about, unmated.”  Dean replied.  Cas just stared at him, waiting for an explanation.
“Ok.”  Cas took a sip of his water and cocked his head, listening.  “Dean…someone’s outside.”
“Yes!  Not like I’m just a desirable Alpha that is wanted for what I can offer, but like I’m actually wanted just for who I am.  Cas doesn’t make me feel like I’m just a source of income security to him.  He really wants me just for me.”
“I don’t have pads so I used some toilet paper to soak up the flow so I could come see what was going on,”  Cas replied.
He walked Cas back to the bed and tucked him back in.  Back out in the hall he found Sam lingering.
“No.  I would never do that.  It has to be something we both want or it’s not happening.”  Dean confirmed.  Cas reached over, taking Dean’s hand in his and sliding their fingers together.
“What’s weird?” Cas couldn’t see from where he was standing what Dean was doing, the closet just wasn’t big enough for him to get to the other side of the ladder.
Dean’s jaw dropped.  “Seriously?!”
"What did you do before coming to prison?" Dean scooted a little closer and leaned forward so his elbows were resting on his knees. The small smirk on the Omega's lips he counted on a win. He just wanted them to be friends. He didn't want Cas to hate him for something that wasn't his fault.
“I’d like it better if you came back here and got started on dinner so it’s ready by the time I get home.  Gabe is going to have Molly, Ellie, and Henry.  He’s picking up the twins at preschool so I don’t have to.  Sam and I will just have the quads.  By the time Gabe shows up with the twins and Henry, the pups will all be hungry.”
“Fine.  It said that I had corrupted what was his, and as payment he was going to kill everyone I ever loved.  And then he was coming for me.”
“Huh.”
“Yeah, or sometimes hot cocoa, depending on my mood and what I’m craving. I actually happen to have popcorn. Once I get Emma down for the night I was thinking about curling up with a scary movie. I might even watch Scream. I’m out of both hot cocoa and apple cider at the moment though.” Emma had grown heavy in his arms and he just knew she’d fallen asleep.
“The virus keeps us alive indefinitely, which basically means we’re imortal. It’s a long gig but with the right people by your side it’s not terrible. I’ve watched a great many things change just in my lifetime, and you’ll see just as much in the coming years.
The drive to the expo was what took the longest.  They came straight from the airport in a secured limo, and they were escorted inside.  People recognized Dean of course, and that set Cas on edge.  Dean had to remind his mate that as much as he really didn’t like it, he was a bit of a celebrity and with that came a farir amount of notoriety.  He stopped to talk with people about their cars and about life in Kansas, and he got the idea that this would be a good venue to mention his plans to revitalize The District.  Cas beamed brightly at him as he told various people and eventually the news crew that showed up to try and get an interview about what he planned to do. He mentioned Alistair and his threats, the damage he had already wrought on their family, and somehow a simple trip to look at baby furniture turned into a national news story about the billionaire businessman and his Omega mate and how they were being stalked by an Alpha the police couldn’t catch because of backwards laws and a lack of funding to monitor The Omega District properly.  While Dean did manage to find the canopy crib he wanted, a piece that Cas absolutely loved, they ended up with security having to shoo people away as more and more news stations came to try and get an interview.  Dean ended up contacting his lawyer to set up a press conference, which he did, and he went in front of the cameras with his mate to tell the world.  The more eyes that were watching for Alistair and his goons, the better.
