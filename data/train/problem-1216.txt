"When I was in the rehabilitation center, there was a therapist that wasn't as a moron as the rest."
“Are you drunk? That case never was settled, as none of these”, he gestured, covering the lots of file boxes behind him. “I was dismissed after the fifteenth victim, remember? I’m sure you do. You didn't hesitate a second in running to the Chief Superintendent, ensuring you were much more capable of solving the case than the poor, clumsy Lestrade. And you got my position. After all, that was what you always wanted, since the day you arrived at the Yard, “ he spat.
During the first two months of his convalescence, sex had disappeared from John's priorities, but now, his desire reawakened even stronger.
They both fell silent when a chronometer appeared in all the screens in the room and started counting down from thirty minutes to zero.
But they decided not to look back. No regrets, not we should have…, it was what it was, and maybe, somehow, it should have been that way. They decided to enjoy the treasure of the present, of the shared time, of the love, the comfort, the cuddles, the kisses, the terrific sex, the lousy telly, the experiment, the cases, the work…, the happiness of having gotten right where they were supposed to be since the day they meet each other.
“Friends’ camp!” –repeated John, pretending to be delighted. “What a thrill!” he threw Sherlock an incendiary look.
"Sherlock..., god, Sherlock…." groaned the doctor, his hands clenched on the edge of the jacuzzi, resisting the urge to grab the detective's head and fuck his mouth senseless.
"You hurt him. A lot. And John too," Sherlock bemoaned with a quiet voice, bending over to cut the suture with his teeth.
"Are you sure this is still a foot massage?" mockingly panted the doctor, with a hoarse voice, his body shivering at the touch.
Convincing Mycroft was a bit more complicated (actually quite complicated), but with Lestrade's help, he finally managed to obtain the information he needed from him. And he even promised to attend the party.
The hum of voices, phones, typing, and meetings cut short. The office's glass doors opened, and all the heads, some puzzled, some terrorized, turned to the old woman who stood in the middle of the room, scowling at them, like a teacher waiting for an answer, oblivious that no one would dare of shouting that name in that place.
They had dinner while watching a documentary about the universe. (John handn't lost hope Sherlock put the Solar System inside his Mental Palace again). But he was afraid Sherlock noticed how excited he was about tomorrow. So while the detective was absorbed by the chemical composition of Jupiter's atmosphere, he disappeared in their bedroom.
“Errr, I'm... sergen ... Detective Inspector Donovan,“ she showed her badge, ”I would like to speak with John Watson.”
"If you want, you can come over now and then and help us," invited the volunteer, "so you can feed and take them for a walk.
The next morning, Sherlock smirked when Molly called him, speaking gibberish about the last corpse arrived at the morgue. He, of course, knew John was preparing him a surprise birthday party and that Molly's call was only an excuse to take him away from home.
Sherlock, hands tightly held to the edges of the table, eyes closed, moaned and whined, noticing how the orgasm grew in his abdomen, clenching his teeth trying to control it although, as he well knew, with his cock and ass in John's hands and mouth, it was a losing battle.
"Papa!" the detective was grateful to be using headsets. Otherwise, Rosie's scream would have rung out across the plain.
But with that inexhaustible capacity to surprise Sherlock, John not only not found them hideous, but managed to transform them into happy memories. Thus, one that had a staggered shape (John forced himself not to think about what the torturers used to leave that scar on his back) represented when, on the night of John's stag party, they both drunkenly slipped down the stairs. Another slightly curved one, when both laughed in the lobby after chasing the cab, and so on.
They exchanged shocked looks and smiles, realizing what was happening. Soon they were laughing at each sound, louder than the previous one. The detective must be home alone since he was almost screaming with pleasure.
"What's the matter? You got something better to do?" sneered the sergeant, looking at the empty room.
“My dear sergeant, I have jurisdiction in all the cases I want to. Get him to the helicopter” he ordered to four men in black suits that lifted the blooding knocked out man and carried him to a black van waiting in the entrance.
Sherlock got up and entered the truck through one of the windows, being careful not to be seen by the others. When he returned, he looked again into Mycroft's case and pulled out a stitch and a needle.
“What? When you started dating John, I decided it was time for turning the page. I attended a self-defense workshop, and it really improves my self-confidence. I’m not that trembling teenager anymore”.
Sherlock dug himself into the ground. He did not want to hold John for fear of hurting his shoulder further. Mycroft stood behind him, knowing John was so infuriated with him for everything that happened that he would not hesitate to break his head. John inhaled depply  and stopped his advance. He knew Sherlock would never defend his older brother if he hadn't a good reason to do it.
"Sherlock, according to the first article of the regulation of Michelin star chef association, you cannot cook with stained clothing."
"The capsule is broken. The components could leak into your blood, and you could be poisoned. That's why they put it on your cheekbone. Usually, these implants are put in places where there is little blood supply, but you could have removed it easily. The cheekbone allowed them full control over the implant. Besides, the lack of information will get them nervous and give us an advantage. So far, they have been very confident because they had everything under control. Let's see how they react now they don't".
Lestrade and John spent agonising hours searching for him. The rain and cobblestones made it impossible to find out where they took the detective.  John tried to stay calm but found it almost impossible. His stomach lurched at the thought of losing Sherlock; the very idea made him feel lost and helpless in a way he never felt before. Something like when he was shot in Afghanistan and feared he would die there, lost in the desert, a kind of emptiness that he crawled into and that suffocated him.
Sherlock, who had closed his eyes, opened them, contemplating how, indeed, there was no trace of the detective.
When he came back, the detective was in the kitchen, sat at the table, embedded in one of his experiments, chewing a piece of toast. His hair was still wet from the shower, and from time to time, he dried with his hand a drop of water that fell on his forehead. John bit his lower lip, his cock twitching a bit, watching a drop sliding over the detective’s neck to disappear under his dressing gown.
The detective woke up, blinked several times, and kissed him back. Without breaking the kiss, he rose slowly to a sitting position. John sat down next to him.
The plane slowly and quietly landed in a hidden hangar near Bern. When it stopped, everyone looked at Sherlock.
Unlike Mycroft, the woman didn’t seem either impressed nor scared by the writers’ shouts. She appeared at the door, undaunted, still staring at the screen.
The detective was lying on his bed, naked, blindfolded, his arms tied up to the bedposts with black silk ropes that delightfully contrasted with his pale skin. Knowing the detective's skills to free himself while being tied or handcuffed, John had deployed his best in tying complicated knots to prevent the detective from unleashing himself.
Without saying anything else, Martha connected a cable from the computer to the TV and smiled. She made coffee and scones for everyone. The officers, not entirely understanding what was going on, sat at the bar, and stared at the screen.
"What's going on? I'm going to get a good scolding from that... crazy old lady. My boss made it very clear he didn't want anyone to know about the castle. Absolutely no one, and now I've got a security hole." she shook her head, desperate. The rest nodded, emphatically; they know how annoyed Mycroft would get at a mistake like that. "Besides..."
"Nogggggggggggghhhhhh" protested Sherlock, squirming as much as he could as John laughed, crossing a complicit gaze with Lestrade who, as softly as he can, pinched one of Sherlock's nipples with his free hand, making the detective squeak, curse and howl.
Sherlock chuckled sadly. That was precisely what he thought when he tried to find out who shot Lestrade and met with his brother's outright opposition, blocking all attempts to locate the shooter.
Mycroft's words conveyed no emotion, nor did his face, at least, no more than an imperceptible tremor in his left eyelid.
The seven veterans, commanded by Sholto, also jumped up, and Mycroft and Lestrade went after them, spreading out over the dunes.
Sherlock looked incredulous and excited to the Irish Setter, who was happily nibbling on the cardboard and then at two pleased with themselves John and Rosie.
Sherlock looked sideways at Rosie, who felt asleep leaning on the headboard. He closed the book, put it on the bedside table, helped her bed, and tucked her in. When the detective bent down to kiss her, he felt John's hands around his waist. He kissed Rosie and stood up, turning to kiss John softly.
The shooting stopped, and everyone looked up at the hut, holding their breath. There was no sound or movement. Mycroft bit his lower lip nervously. Igloo technology had never been tested before. What if it hadn't worked?
The woman raised an eyebrow, staring at him. Sherlock wondered why he felt like a child again in front of her, and knowing well that look would mean  problems if he replied, closed his mouth, turned around, and fetch John and Rosie. After more than twenty long and unnerving minutes that Rosie took to say goodbye to her new friends, the three of them lined up on the sand towards the house, while, behind them, the sun began to disappear on the sea.
Half an hour later, she got out of the cab in front of the hotel and took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. After all, she had always liked John Watson. He was a good man, polite, calm and caring for other’s feelings, although she never understood how he could have fallen in love with the freak and, even worse, married him. Donovan remembered the first time she met him, joining Sherlock in a case, when she warned him of the freak being a psychopath, or when advised him to go fishing instead of chasing criminals with the freak throughout the city.
He pointed to Mycroft, who, in the photo, was holding Lestrade's hand. He understood Sherlock's amusement. Their relationship had been made public much earlier than he would have liked, to Lestrade's happiness and Mycroft would not appear on Baker Street until the journalists forgot about it, to Sherlock's delight.
Donovan wasn’t able to picture Mycroft using his imagination to plot a story, even though she tried her best.
Then Mycroft jumped on the stage and searched through the available songs in the karaoke. Finally, he seemed satisfied with the choice and whispered something to Sherlock, John, Irene, and Molly, who quickly nodded. Mycroft stood in the center of the stage and the other four behind them.
"Thank you for all the effort you've made for Rosie today," he muttered, his voice muffled by Sherlock's neck, who quivered at the tingling of his breath on his sensitive skin. "She is delighted with her new friends. She says that when she returns to London, she will learn French, Spanish, and German. She has had a great time”.
"That's why when they accused you of conducting unauthorised operations, complaints failed to prosper".
"You two should talk from time to time about how you feel, especially after something like that. Only you both can break this vicious circle you've got yourselves into, as I told Sherlock yesterday. You have to do something to broke it, or you are going to lose the rest of your life like this. And that will not have been worth it at all".
John grabbed his own hard cock and started slowly stroking himself. Sherlock swallowed hard, his eyes following each of John's hand movements, wishing it was his mouth instead of John's hand on the doctor's cock.
"Yes, chasing an impossible love instead of looking at my true feelings. I was too afraid to be sincere with myself. Until I met Irene".
"Has the great Sherlock Holmes not thought of that?" joked John, gently nibbling on the detective's lower lip.
"Congratulations, your first rugby lineout reception was a success. I thought you didn't understand anything about rugby," replied the nurse.
"If they intercept it, they will think I'm a bastard who is cheating on my husband with my brother's secretary.  That's what they would decipher if they read it literally."
Sherlock rubbed John's hole with his nose and licked up his crack. He put his flat tongue up against his hole and started licking it like if he were eating an ice cream cone, moaning in delight. He loved rimming John and, sometimes, he fantasized about doing it while John was tied up. The reality was much more intense than the fantasy.
"Oh, of course," ironized John. "Why should I have to worry about her orbiting around you? We all know what she would like to do to you".
The doctor took the bottle of lube and carefully smeared the vibrator. Greg followed the doctor's hands movements, soft and precise, and surprised himself wishing those hands were on his cock now and not in the sex toy.
John growled, looking the mix of cum and spit drooling obscenely from Sherlock's open mouth. He thought he could come again instantly watching how he caught the last few drops on his tongue, so he didn't waste any of it, wiping his lips clean like a cat with a smug grin, that quickly banished in a tense grimace when John switched on the vibrator inside him.
He watched Mycroft. The elder Holmes regained his proud air. He ended his tie, stretched out his shirt cuffs, and waited patiently on his feet, hands on the lectern, to be given way, as if Clay were to announce the Christmas campaign instead of going to destroy him, along with Sherlock. Because, after that, the Holmes would be history.
“And we will be the first to see them, because tomorrow will come to a lot of people to see it, and we’ll have the best place.”
Bruce and Clint looked at each other. John smiled. It was funny to see them. They looked like the parents of a teenager asking them to come home a little later than usual.
He blinked as he noticed the tears. After everything they'd been through together, both were finally where Sherlock wanted to be. Since the day John burst into his life, erasing years of loneliness in a second and giving birth inside him a disconcerting and unknown feeling: love.
Then John placed his tongue on the asshole very lightly and wiggle it up and down or side to side very quickly. The detective growled, his tights trembling, as the doctor swirled his tongue around the hole in a circle, a small circle at first, making it slightly bigger in a spiral movement, until he stopped and did it in reverse, tracing the circle sometimes quick, sometimes killing slowly.
He stood slowly, wiped away the tears, and, with hesitant steps, walked to the nearest street when he could take a cab.
The van stopped at the international departure terminal at Bern airport. The driver got out and opened the door. One after the other, the homeless got out and lined up perfectly on the pavement, waiting, which immediately caught the attention of the travellers around them.
"In vino veritas," it's a Latin expression that could be translated as "under the influence of alcohol, a person tells the truth".
"Ok, take it," he sighed, giving his almost whole piece to him. Sherlock took a big bite and moved it near to John's mouth, so he could do the same.
"I know. But until then... " John reached behind the sofa, pulled out the cowboy hat and put it on Sherlock, who got up and ran into the bedroom, chased by John.
"Yes, dark matter. It's what generates the balance of forces in the universe. Perhaps, coupled with the matter, it would combat gravity's force and give stability to the portal.
"But in another reality, another version of you decided to fight for John, that he wouldn't let him marry Mary."
Donovan felt the anger overwhelm her. She was a Detective Inspector, wasn’t she? She retained the door.
Natasha blinked and smirked. She nodded. She shrunk with the woman's screams, but she raised her head and squared her shoulders.
Once there, he retook his phone and wrote another text. Twenty minutes later, he received the response. After reading it, Sherlock wandered up and down the parking lot, muttering for himself. He sent three more texts.
"Yes," shouted Rosie, enthusiastically, standing next to John, wriggling his fingers in the same menacing way.
“Of course I am. Because if I were William, I would be really disappointed with you. You were lucky. You found something that only very few people have in this life, true love He loved you so much that he gave his life for you. And then, you waste yours by pitying and destroying yourself. William must be really angry with you.”
They stood one in front of the other, looking at each other's eyes, as if they didn't want to break some kind of spell, slowly undoing the knot of the other's tie, gently sliding them down the collar of the shirt until they fell to the ground. Their hands moved to each other's shirt, slowly unbuttoning them, both locked into each other's eyes. Pupils dilated by desire, a mouth half-open, the other biting his lower lip, holding back the impulse to stripe the other in a hurry. Both getting more and more aroused by their hands' slowness, the gentle rubbing of the fingertips as they undid the buttons, merely a brush on the skin, their cocks growing inside their trousers, the room filled with their soft gasps of anticipation.
"You are a doctor," Mycroft took his mobile out of his inner jacket pocket, which kept vibrating with messages and calls from Sherlock and switched if off "You saw his back. His back, Doctor Watson. Doesn't it remind you of anything?"
"nnnnnnnnggggggggg" the detective protested when Anderson started licking his balls, tongue lapping wet on them. Sherlock yelled, jerking, as his balls were sucked.
"He's going to freeze, but there's no way to get him out of there. At least with the sedative, he is calmer."
"I know," Lestrade replied, and both chuckled. He walked over and kissed Mycroft, stroking his cheek wound.
Sherlock moved to John's lips, softly massaging and caressing them with the tip of his tongue. John, avidly, starting doing the same, both of them moaning softly, feeling the other's lips, breathing on each other. When John tried to kiss Sherlock, the detective moved back a bit to get back again to rubs his lips. John's cock was totally hard, his arms straining the ropes. For a moment, he thought about pressing the panic button, jumping on Sherlock, tie him up, and teasing him madly, but it was Sherlock's wish, and he wanted to fulfill it, so he opened his mouth a bit, letting Sherlock massage his tongue with his own.
Rosie swam up to him and took his hand, guiding him as they followed John. The detective looked at that little hand in his, and followed her meekly, fear forgotten.
Mycroft, Lestrade, and the rest looked at him as if he had lost his mind, as did the mercenaries surrounding the hut. Judging by the silence inside the shed, those inside thought the same thing.
"She is safe," repeated Mycroft, stubborn, his lower lip trembling, speaking almost to himself, as if he realized at that moment that he indeed put her in danger and left her defenseless. "They won't do anything to her. They promised me, they promised me," he repeated, lowering his head, "I was terrified. I had... no way to protect her. I didn't know who was on my side and who wasn't..."
Sherlock moved his head slowly. John knew that he had an almost Paulovlian reflex with that game, but on that occasion, it didn't work either. The detective barricaded himself back on the couch.
The DI shook his head, shaded, seeing a black van parked next to them; they got in, and the driver set off for the harbour, where the warehouse was, hidden among hundreds of others. No one would pay attention to a few men entering it at night.
“I knew it was dangerous.” He wiped his tears in anger. ”But I never thought… I never thought he would give… He left me alone.”
He sighed, defeated, left the book, and nodded, walking behind them. A couple of steps later, he returned to the sunshade and put on his T-shirt to hide his scarred back. Not that Sherlock cared that people found it more or less disgusting. He didn't care at all, but he preferred to avoid comments, gestures, or questions in front of Rosie.
They both turned to see a regretful Sherlock leaning against the door lintel, his hand resting on the wound, head down,  barefoot. If Lestrade hadn't been so angry, he would have felt sorry for him. The detective was scared, fearful that John would make good on his threat to leave him. It was clear that the thought of losing him terrified him as much as the doctor was terrified of losing Sherlock.
"Because if I hadn't, I would have gone crazy. They were watching me all the time. So I could only trust their word," he rubbed his eyes, exhausted.
The swing cracked in protest as John came inside the detective, shouting Sherlock's name. The detective arched nearly out of the swing with the force of his new orgasm when he felt John's hot cum filling him, both screaming the other's name, the detective's cum covering both of them due to the movement.
Soon the tunnel widened, and a few yards later, they found a metal grille door, embedded in a stone wall, that gave access to the castle. Sherlock approached it and ran his finger over the rocks on the wall around it. When he came to a completely square one, he pushed it in. A small click was heard, and the detective pushed the door open.
It seemed Sherlock's brother was surprised too, because he was silent for a few moments, deciphering the phrase. Finally, he cleared his throat:
John grinned with Sherlock's cock in his mouth, enjoying his tortured loud moans. His licking, though incessant, was slow and light, while softly stroking his shaft, taking his time, caressing the already hardened cock in the way he knew ignited Sherlock's body.
“You... you have been carrying John’s phone all this time? Even last night?” he asked, his voice a bit high-pitched than usual.
"There is no other way? You control time. You did it once." he asked, his voice full of hope and sorrow.
He approached Rosie, and soon both were surrounded by cheerful animals. Sherlock smiled broadly, both he and Rosie throwing them sticks and balls, and Rosie about to explode with enthusiasm as the dogs laid them at her feet.
The detective remained motionless for a few moments, to let his body adjust to being impaled by John's huge cock and to allow the doctor to regain control. Otherwise, he would come in seconds. John gasped like a fish out of water a couple of times, biting his lip, breathing deeply through his nose, until he nodded.
It was love at first sight. Everett met Strange by chance at Avengers headquarters when he was, as usual, arguing with Stark. The two of them reminded him of those two old men in the Muppet's box, engaged in an endless discussion but at the same time happy to be fighting each other. It was evident that, although they both wanted to keep it a secret, they were a couple. That's why Everett decided to plunge his feelings into the deepest corner of his heart. There was no point in hoping.
"We tricked the only consulting detective in the world!" shouted Rosie, clapping excitedly and high-fiving John.
Mycroft took a handful of sand in his hand. He didn't want to remember that horrible night either. He kept on taking handfuls of sand, letting the grains fall slowly from his hands, stirring the sand.
Nervous, angry, and not knowing what to do, he turned to look at Stephen, who was trying to smooth out an imaginary wrinkle in his cloak, until the Levitation cloak slapped him with one of its ends and went near the coat rack where Sherlock's coat was hanging.
"Prove it," replied Mycroft, as Lestrade looked at him, disconcerted, along with John and Sholto and the rest of the ex-soldiers in front of the mansion of Irene, Anthea, Donovan and Mrs Hudson in 221C. They were all in communication, and none of them understood the game Mycroft was playing.
Sherlock checked his watch and sat on his chair, staring vacantly, holding his breath, waiting for the hell to be unleashed.
"What are you doing here?" he shouted out of his mind, for once all his phlegm lost, "Don't you have lives to save, people to protect, crimes to avoid? Everybody out! I said EVERYBODY OUT OF HERE!"
John smiled. Sherlock never submitted easily. And John loved it. He loved to dissolve his resistance to conquer Sherlock’s body inch by inch, making the desire to grow inside the detective’s body.
Sherlock snorted. Only Mycroft could have blown up the implant surrounded by soldiers with PTSD. The rest, still startled, looked at each other. Lestrade frowned, turned, and walked away, fuming. The elder Holmes' relaxed tone pissed him off even more. He had been up the whole bloody night worrying about Mycroft, walking around the truck to check if he was okay, and his boyfriend was happily and de-stressedly playing with a fire extinguisher.
John bit Sherlock's lower lip and pulling it slightly until he let go, enjoying the thrill that ran through the detective's body, accompanied by a barely audible whine more predictable of a puppy than the only consulting detective in the world.
"As you said, it's my birthday," said Sherlock. He undid his belt and slid his trousers down his legs to the floor and did the same with his pants, freeing his hard cock. Then moved his hands to his ass, and a wet pop sounded when he removed an anal plug, his hole brilliant with the lube. He threw it across the living room and looked at John.
Lestrade hugged him, understanding, for the first time,  his need to be informed of everything down to the smallest detail. His obsessive surveillance of Sherlock, the "abductions..." of those who became part of his brother's life, the assumption he couldn't make the slightest mistake...
Everett smiled mischievously at the blush that filled Stephen's cheeks as he said, "You go to New York. We will go to London Sanctum".
“It’s not so easy, Sherlock” he was really hurt by all the atrocities they had said about his husband.
After a few minutes, the taxi driver took a small black device out of the glove compartment, placed it on the dashboard, and pressed a button. A red light came on, blinked several times until it turned green.
John untied the detective’s dressing gown and slid it down his arms until it fell to the ground. Then lifted Sherlock’s t-shirt, revealing the bandages that covered his ribs and his bruised chest and shoulders. He gently caressed them and Sherlock hissed in pain.
"ohhhhhhhhhhh, god, yes, god, yessssssssssssssssssss, John mmmmmmmmm" Sherlock moaned loudly, "please, touch memmmm, somebody, plesssssssssssss."
"There's nowhere she's safe. They control everything. Absolutely everything, everyone, everywhere. This is why I let Rosie stay with Molly".
John nodded. Though he hadn't said anything, his shoulder was hurting badly again. A doctor examined it while the nurses attended and treated the others. He injected him a mixture of anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers and put a new sling on it. John sighed, alleviated, disregarding Sherlock's worried gaze.
"Come on," he ordered, taking his arm and pulling on his "steps. Seventeen," he warned, and then continued to pull him, forcing him to stumble up. Ross held his breath. He seemed to be right, he said to himself, as he heard Holmes make another door. One more pull and they crossed over into the place.
They entered the building and got on an elevator that went down to sublevel ten. The doors opened and they appeared in front of a vault door, that was opened without a minimal sound. After crossing it, they walked down a narrow grey corridor, the sound of distant growls filling the air.
"Congrats John," smirked Sherlock dropping himself on the couch and picking up one of John's medical journals. "Now, you've got an archenemy."
None of them found an explanation for it, but, as far as he knew by other colleagues in other areas of London or other cities, the same phenomenon was present in all of them. And no one knew why until they discovered it on the fourth day, thanks to lunchtime.
"Because Daddy told me he would come home from work on Sunday. And Papa went to help him. So they'll both be back on Sunday. I deduced it as Papa does."
Without warning, John placed his hands on Sherlock's head, pushing him over his cock so that Sherlock had to take almost the entire length into his mouth. He jerked his hips up quickly, and Sherlock gagged, a bit surprised by the sudden movement. He swallowed a couple of times, breathing deeply through his nose until he could control his gag reflex, as John taught him.
John rubbed his now extra sensitive nipples with his palms, slowly at first and then increasing his touch's speed and pressure, deliberately building the pleasure within Sherlock's body. The detective moaned harder and louder, whining when John licked one with the tip of his tongue and pinched the other.
He sighed, relieved, entering to the coolness of the stone walls, which contrasted with the heat that was still on the island at that time of the year. When he said this to Geena, who was fussing at the entrance, the woman laughed out loud.
The lower area looked the same as the upper one. Some mats on the floor abandoned water bottles and little else.
Limping slightly, he went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, cut two big pieces of cake, and gave one to John, who had moved behind him. Sherlock kissed him, tasting the chocolate aroma from John's mouth and took his hand, guiding them to their bedroom. He jumped onto the bed, still cramming the cake down.
"This tunnel leads to the forest," explained the detective. "It was built by the resistance during the Second World War so that they could hide escaped Allied soldiers from the concentration camps" he bent down and went inside.
The chorus of groans and moans made Sherlock groan louder, greedily sucking the cock in his mouth, moaning around it as he kept on pumping the cock in his hand, The officer that was fucking Sherlock mouth thrust erratically and, throwing his head back, came inside the detective's mouth, while the one he was stroking also came over Sherlock chest and neck. The officer took his cock out of Sherlock's mouth and leaned with the other on the table, panting hard, giving the detective a break.
"It makes me want to kick your ass and send you to Asgard. He doesn't notice you? Showing up at the Avengers' facilities when he knows you are there? You look like two teenagers playing hooky in high school!"
John felt his lungs burning. His muscles spasmed from lack of oxygen. Blood, pooled in his head, was throbbing in his temples. His vision became blurry, and his head stopped thinking clearly. God, he needed to open his mouth and breathe in forcefully. But if he did, his lungs would fill with water.
"Besides, in a long time, you won't be able to tell me off when I go ahead alone to chase a criminal," retorted the detective.
"Your mouth…….. so fucking good," John murmured in a moan, knowing the praise would encourage Sherlock to swallow the whole of it, and John could felt the tip of his cock in the back of his throat, Sherlock's moans vibrating on John's cock and reaching the doctor's whole body.
"Don't play with me, Mike. If I have to rip your skin off to get you to tell me I will don't have the slightest doubt about doing it".
Sherlock walked away from the tents where the group was sleeping. It was his turn to stand guard, so no one would notice his departure. He sat down on the ground, in the shelter of a small mound nearby, where he could still watch over the camp. When he was sure no one could hear him, he took his phone and made the video call to answer Molly's numerous lost calls.
"I feel like I'm not myself, like a part of me has been left... crouched or scared in a corner, and I'm not able to connect with it. I don't know how to explain it."
"Please, it will only be a minute," repeated Molly, with a pleading look. "As you can see, she is not very well…, "she pointed at her temple. "Believe me. I know her. She is impossible, and she won't leave this building until she talks with anybody, if not Mr. Holmes, someone who can help her. And you have no idea what a fuss she might make if you ask security to take her out. Imagine, a helpless old woman being maltreated by security guards…"
“Yes, but I’m his older brother, damn it! Always patronizing him…, I was useless even after… that happened. He couldn’t talk to anybody, John, to anybody!”
"I will stop by first to see a friend," Molly said in a neutral tone. "Let's go to 221 Baker Street".
"No" answered John, "No way. Dogs in bed are not allowed. That's why we are going to buy him in a bed".
Sherlock took out his shoes and walked to the shore, plunging in the sea until the water reached his ankles. John and Rosie mimicked him. He frowned a bit, closed his eyes, and slipped into the last room created in his Mind Palace, where he kept his childhood memories that reappeared after his meeting with Eurus. Most of them were in brown, grey colors, scrambled, and scattered thrown on the floor. Others, arranged, were turning into more bright colors.
"My fault,' coughed a contrite Mycroft, opening the truck door betweens clouds of greyish smoke, raising his hands, holding a fire extinguisher, "metal cup in the microwave."
“At eight in the ...“ She swallowed. “Holmes Hotel.” God, her dream of a world without Sherlock had become an X file where the detective invaded everything. “Shall we meet at the door?”
"It seems in this case you doubled the chance," joked Stephen, looking at John. The three of them chuckled.
They changed in new clothes and stood at the entrance, waiting for the mercenaries and Mike to arrive, while Sherlock and the others watched the main entrance from the cameras.
The chairs started to give in. Knowing time was running out, Sherlock threw a Muay Thai uppercut elbow to Moran’s chin, which made him fall to the ground. The detective straddled on him and punched Moran’s face repeatedly, charging every blow with all the rage and the pain Sebastian inflicted him, his eyes filled with tears that blurred his vision. He kept on hitting Moran even when the man finally lost consciousness, his head bouncing uncontrollably due to the strength of the hits.
"I'm fed up! I quit! The wedding is over!" he bellowed, looking at the ceiling, his hands curled in a fist so tight his knuckles were white
Sherlock took the object out of the bag and frowned. He gestured for them to surround him and nailed it to the floor with a sharp blow. From the handle, a transparent dome opened, visible only by the bluish hue of the glass that entirely covered them. Sherlock pressed a red button on the handle, which beeped and turned green.
He fell silent, noticing the barrel of another gun resting on his nape, swallowing with difficulty. He saw Holmes' eyes opening even wider, looking at the man behind him as if he were a ghost.
Before his brain came entirely out of the dream, he noticed the hand approaching his head, and in an automatic movement of a well-trained soldier, he held it in the air with his left hand and, in a quick motion, twist the arm of the attacker on his back.
He was aware of Sherlock's talented mouth and tongue to insult, retort and deduce, but never thought it was so gifted for sucking a cock. He was totally lost in a cloud of pleasure bliss, feeling his cock wrapped in the warmness of Sherlock's mouth, the softness of his swollen red lips as he fucked him unrelentingly, the teasing of Sherlock's tongue when he wriggled it around his gland or shaft.
The elder Holmes lowered his head, a familiar guilty creeping inside him, curling around his throat and chest, preventing him from breathing, threatening to suffocate him, again.
Sholto frowned. The man's tone of urgency put him under stress. He knew from John that Lestrade was a man of integrity in whom the doctor had complete confidence.
Sherlock felt something in his right hand. John's army gun. He looked at him questioningly and saw in his eyes the little orange dots that announced he was going to metamorphose in a werewolf. Sherlock frowned.
The only thing he kept from that time was the wedding ring he and Anthony bought together during their wedding preparations, a few days before his fiancé's death, the only memory of a time he was truly happy. To the few people who dared to ask him, he said it was a family inheritance, ending the subject.
Sherlock chuckled and turned his attention back to the journal. The DI glanced at John and the rest of soldiers and homeless, animatedly chatting and laughing.
He opened a tube of lube and smeared his fingers, John looking at him with dilated pupils, panting, on the verge on the orgasm. He whined when Sherlock's trailed his fingers light and soft up and down his cock, from his perineum to the glans.
"When we are back to Baker Street, I will drag you to Regents Park by night and fuck you there, in full view of everyone," he growled, his own cock throbbing hard at the thought.
John nodded. How could he ever forget it? Every time Bill, he and the others met in a pub, they left an empty chair, Mike's, to somehow keep him up with them. John understood what Bill meant. All of them wanted that chair to be occupied again.
John grabbed his neck and kissed him eagerly, but Sherlock pulled back and licked John's lips in a teasing, playful gesture. He traced a line with his tongue through John's chin and jawline, reaching his neck, kissing and gently nibbling it, as John turned his head to one side, giving Sherlock more skin to play with, his hands on the edge of the tube, humming softly under Sherlock's kisses.
“He said focus!” shouted Mind Palace’s Molly, slapping Sherlock’s face, making the detective gasp, swivel on himself, and, of course, focus.
He got into Speedy's and ordered a coffee, hoping that the caffeine would help him get up the courage. It was still early, and he needed to clear his head a little. No. There was nothing to clear up. He had been an asshole, being taken against Sherlock by the same people who hated him from the first day when, high on drugs, told them they were wrong about a murder case.
"You..." whispered one of them with a ghostly echo. It was similar to Sherlock, the only difference, a great wound in his skull, blood falling on his face.
Sherlock let out the air he had been holding in. He trusted his brother's fighting skills, but he hadn't used them in a long time. The men around him and the Serb stood still, undecided, looking at Clay who, after the moment of bewilderment, smiled wolfishly.
"Behind Blackbushe Airport, there is a privately owned estate. Across the wire, about ten miles down a country road, there is a small hangar.
"Apparently, being so small, she shouldn't use weights," replied the woman, clearly a fan of the show.
But before he could get to it, his cloak came between him and the door and pointed imperatively to Everett, who, realizing Stephen was leaving, had turned to the fireplace.
"I don't care," muttered Sherlock without looking at his brother. It was true. Killing him now would be an act of mercy.
That's why he decided to leave Baker Street. He didn't want to stop seeing Sherlock but knew he needed to do it to move on with whatever was ahead of him, because, without Sherlock, his existence couldn't be any longer called a life.
Mycroft gave him a file containing several photographs of boys around twenty years old, all of them dark-haired, slim and with blue or green eyes.
Sherlock groaned, arching into John's hips, his cock about to exploding trapped between their bodies. John grasped his plump cheeks tighter and pulled them apart, allowing him to bury his cock even deeper inside Sherlock.
John cupped Sherlock's face in his hands and kissed him his wet lips brushing over the detective's, moistening them, a soft touch that only made the detective wanting more. Sherlock parted his lips, inviting him, and John poked his tongue in his mouth, gently playing with his tongue.
He spilled a little more wine, this time on Sherlock's hips, that dripped down to his swimsuit. Slowly, he drew with his tongue the shape of Sherlock's cock through the fabric, starting at the testicles, following the shaft and ending at the tip, flicking his tongue on it, feeling it swelling and throbbing at his touch.
He put flour, butter, and sugar in a bowl and put it all together and then put the dough on the floured table.
“Stop it, love” John’s soft voice penetrated in Sherlock’s brain, his fist in the air, ready for the next blow.
The pathologist paled, scared. The idea that they could have broken into before getting Rose to safety made her shiver with fear. Donovan looked in the rearview mirror, blinded by the glare of the headlights of the vehicle following them.
The three soldiers looked at each other, gauging their chances of picking up the shovels and attacking their captors. But the risk of John and Jonas being shot was too considerable.
"Stark, you couldn't be more untimely," grunted Everett, throwing him a murderous look that didn't scare the billionaire in the least, who chuckled, mockingly, though happy that those two fools would finally be able to confess their feelings.
His entrance vibrated around John’s cock, making the doctors thrusting erratic and, crying Sherlock’s name, rode out his orgasm. Then his arms melted and he collapsed onto Sherlock’s chest. He tried to move next to him, but Sherlock embraced him firmly, avoiding him to move, not wanting to lose contact, struggling to catch his breath, as John panted heavily.
"This is when you realize you are not allowed to speak without permission," grunted John, his commanding tone directly reaching Sherlock's balls, his cock leaking profusely with the now dominant John.
"Don't give it another thought, John. You talked to him. You did your best. And you know what Sherlock was like when he got something into his head. No one could have stopped him."
Sherlock closed his eyes, melting in the kiss, in John's warm body and expert lips, in the happiness of being finally kissed by John. The doctor grabbed him firmly, kissing Sherlock's soft lips, the feeling erasing the grief, the pain, and anguish, his heart beating again.
"When Sherlock arrived and held my hand, I told myself that, if I survived, I would not let anything or anyone take that away from me. And something inside myself got disconnected, ... something like the strength or the courage or the energy ... I don't know how to name it, but I'm unable to reconnect with that part of me. Somehow I'm not able to put myself back together since that day".
Voices, men rustling voices climbed up the little hill. He lied down on the ground to watch them without being seen. Eight men may be lost ramblers looking for a shelter. Sherlock crawled to observe them better.
Mycroft cocked his head to the side and cleared his throat gently. Lestrade bit his lip to disguise a smile. Both brothers melted with compliments on their genius. Probably because people used to address them with other kinds of epithets more along the lines of freak or pain in the ass. Had he allowed himself to be a little more human, the DI was sure that Sherlock's brother would have blushed. In the end, it was going to turn out that Mycroft Holmes had a heart somewhere too...
Then, at the end of the aisle appeared Sherlock and Rosie, Sherlock grabbing Rosie's hand, the girl elated with joy, the detective visibly nervous.
"Oh, god!" Sherlock moaned loudly, as John's tongue swirled and flicked against his now hypersensitive bud. John grinned, pinching and toying the other one with his right hand, as his left traced Sherlock's straining erection through his shorts, enjoying him squirming under his soft touch, fighting to keep the glass balanced.
"Advantages of your boyfriend being a genius," laughed Greg looking at the floor. Effectively, there were arrows stuck in the floor indicating the route to the various rooms.
"Come on, as you said to me, John knows he couldn't have found anyone better than you. None of them, however much he fucked them in Afghanistan".
“We talked during hours about my university subjects, he even helped me with my Chemistry experiments. Sebastian took me out to restaurants, to the theatre when there was a play I liked, to chemistry conferences, to violin concerts… he did anything to please me. He was nice, comprehensive, caring… they were the best six months of my life until then.
John Watson adored the beach. He enjoyed the sun's warmth, getting tanned, the softness of the sand under his feet, the smell and sound of the sea, the shouting of the people enjoying themselves on the beach, and most of all, Rosie's happy face when running in the shore to escape from the waves after getting more mud to add somewhere in the sandcastle, while he followed her precise orders on how to build the moat around, the time they spent together making, in Rosie's words, the perfect sandcastle.
"Ohhhhhhhhhh, God, Greg, faster, please, faster, faster. I'm close, I'm so close," begged the detective, trying to buck his hips into the DI's fist, but John firm grip on them didn't allow him to do it.
"You may be angry, but your cock is glad to see me,' Greg whispered in his ear, and a chill ran down his back while he groaned, feeling the tip of a whip brushings against his glans.
He searched the pockets, but both were empty. He was about to hang it again, but the beeping sound persisted.
Holmes scratched his head with the gun. John was right. Damn it! He went back to Baker Street to make John remember their time together, but he never thought he'd be found quickly. Especially not Donovan. In fact. Why were they looking for him? For four or five bodies?
But in front of these fourteen pairs of eyes fixed on him and only on him, his mouth dried up and his brain went blackout.
The sergeant muffled a surprised groan when she felt a couple of hands pulling down her panties as her tights were opened wide. The officer that was playing with Sherlock's feet had moved down and plunged his face in her pussy. Donovan arched her back as the officer's tongue circled her clit, sucking it inside his mouth and licking between her wet lips. The sergeant grinded her pussy against this face, and he sucked and licked faster, growling with excitement, stroking himself, excited with Sally's moans and pants, that reverberated in Greg and John, as the doctor, about to come, swallowed Sherlock's cock.
"It would be easy to tell you now. And it wouldn't be fair. You made the decision based on what you knew at the time, and you thought it was the best one."
"I know, but...." she wrung her hands on her apron, nervous. "You have family, friends... that makes this confinement… easier. But there are many, like me, who don't have family, who feel lonely and isolated, at home, at the hospitals... and watching them is... it's like having a family. For me, this time makes me feel less lonely; it gives me the strength to move forward and optimism for the future. And like me, there are many of us whose confinement is more bearable because of them. It drives us a way of dealing with loneliness and sadness.
The detective wasn’t sure about what would happen after opening it. It took him a lot of time to achieve locking it, and it had been that way for almost fifteen years.
John opened the bottle of lube and poured some of it on his fingers. Then he took Greg's hand and did the same. Both of them moved between Sherlock's legs, spread them wide apart, and bend them over the detective's chest.
Mycroft started giving instructions to the agents, who quickly set themselves in motion. The DI looked at him.
"Understood," Mycroft raised his head, his cold gesture covering his face again. "Be confident I'll never bother you again."
A beeping sound started in someplace in the office. They both cocked their heads, trying to identify the origin of the sound. Lestrade got up and, following it, stood near the coat rack where his coat was hung.
Stupidly, he decided the universe would help him if he gave a push. And as Sherlock headed down the alley to stock up on drugs, he decided it was time to help him. He offered him the chance to go back in time and then..,
John and Lestrade fell silent, watching him approach them. They knew this was a sensitive subject for the detective.
Molly rolled her eyes. She could tell a mile away Irene was delighted that Sherlock owed her a favor. Still, it was clear that she loved the girl, though she tried to hide it by all means.
"Sir," interrupted the SAS sergeant, "these men need medical attention, get some food and drink and rest."
The blonde one moved to enter the living-room, to comfort the man, to rescue him from his sorrow and loneliness, but was stopped by a pale hand’s gesture.
"Sherlock, I need you to stay here, taking care of Rosie. And even if I didn't, I know you. Instead of staying by our side, you'd be running around on some dune, getting into God knows what ambush. I can't take care of you and the mission at the same time. I'll be back before you know it"
Donovan enjoyed the surprised glance Anthea gave her. She may not be as smart as Holmes, but she had the winning hand in that play, whatever it was.
John opened the taps and checked the water temperature. When he was satisfied, he placed the detective in the bathtub, who put his head under the jet and shook it, spreading thousands of drops all over the bathroom, like a happy cocker spaniel.
"Okay," he finally said, almost tentatively. His cock throbbed again as a slight chill shook his body, which did not go unnoticed by the smiling detective, who lazily placed his hands behind his neck.
"I won the tickle-fight!" she roared, jumping on him. John looked at the two of them, Sherlock hugging Rosie, still giggling, the girl lying on his chest, exultant of joy, the sadness of being the last day forgotten. John lay down next to Sherlock, smiled at him, and pecked his cheek. Rosie imitated him and then crawled to lie between her fathers. The detective took out his phone and took a selfie of the three of them.
John puzzled. He thought Sherlock would go crazy. He hated having journalists hovering outside their door, chasing them every time they came in or out.
"We smelled the cookies," Lestrade lied, feigning enthusiasm, "and we knew that delicious smell could only be from our favorite niece's cookies."
The whip landed on his ass again, and his dick swelled a little more, the rings that around it pressing even harder, without becoming painful.
"Vincent Spaulding. Anthony kept repeating his name over and over while he was dying. I thought he was delirious because he was saying they… they were two Clays or something similar…" he opened his eyes as he realised what it meant "you created your own doppelganger".
It was Stephen who, creating a whip, tangled it around the waist of the ragged Sherlock and, with a wave of his hand, threw it into the darkness, while Thor produced a lightning bolt that caused the other Natasha to be swallowed up by the blackness around them as well.
"You came with me," he said, at last, his gesture of madness transformed into relief and a hint of happiness.
"An ancient Chinese legend says "began Stephen "that there is an old matchmaker God, Yuè Xià Lǎorén, who goes out every night to look for the souls that are destined to be together on Earth. Once he finds them, he links them with a red thread tied to the little finger of each one".
A new cut. John was still making push-ups, counting one hundred sixty, one hundred sixty-one, one hundred sixty-two… with Rosie sitting astride his back. The doctor easily lowered and lifted his body at a quick path, while Rosie held on to the doctor's t-shirt so she wouldn't fall. She counted with him between giggles, mainly when John started powerfully pushing himself up, his hands coming off the floor and clapping in midair before fall onto his arms again, Rosie accompanying the clapping. At the same time, Sherlock, lazily lying on the couch, smiled at the sound of his husband and daughter's laughs.
"Oh, my God, oh my God…….." moaned the detective, panting hard as John brushed across the bunch of nerves until Sherlock was a quivering wrecked mess of whines, moans, pleas, his tights shivering at every brush, the orgasm tingling inside his abdomen.
Everett cleared his throat, cursing to himself. Stephen surely already visualized the future and knew what he was going to say. Damn it. If he didn't help him, it was because he was in a relationship with Stark. Stark was his soul mate. And now he was coming to make amends to fate? That was not a good idea. He had nothing to offer. It was a silly thing to do.
Listening to her, both Sherlock and John laughed. Since Rosie’s last name starting with W, it would be a long time before they should have to organize it.
The doctor waited until he remained still. He pulled the detective's wet fringe from his forehead and kissed him gently.
“It won't do you any good” John intervened. All heads turned to look at him. He clenched his cane fist, a bit ashamed for being in the spotlight. “Maybe to catch the poor devil who wanted to hide his girlfriend's murder as another crime of the serial killer, but little else.”
"Sherlock is right. You don't tell us where the bombs are because you know we would disable the code immediately."
They both got into the elevator and went to the foyer. Mycroft opened the door. Behind it, an upset doctor glared at them.
The detective crawled with difficulty, clutching his hands to the cobblestones on the ground and propelling himself forward. He did not have the strength to stand up. He crept a few more feet and dropped into the ditch. Suddenly his body was gone.
"Don't you have an igloo?" intervened Mark, lying on the sand a few feet away from them, his gaze fixed on the rifle scope.
"He didn't invite her. It was me," Molly stepped in. "As Sherlock said, you don't have to worry about her. She is dating me".
"Are you all right?" Lestrade asked,  checking Mycroft's face. He turned to the detective. "What have you done to him?"
John burst out laughing despite himself. He leaned in and kissed him gently on the lips. God, how he missed him...
"I think I understand what you mean. But it's normal to be... scared or distressed or whatever you want to call it, after something like that. This was hard for you. You just need time, and you'll be yourself again".
"Yes, Lestrade and the homeless have caught him, but he won't say where the bombs are, and we're running out of time".
At halfway, Sherlock realized the kids hadn’t eaten anything yet, so he made them stop and they ate their sandwiches in the wood under the shade of the trees.
Sherlock raised a questioning eyebrow to Lestrade, surprised he called him Holmes instead freak. The DI and John smiled.
Knelt on the bed at his side, John muttered soft words in the detective's ears who, a bit nervous, stirred his limbs, tightening the ropes.
“How?” he muttered. And then he got it. Blind of deadly lust, he didn’t realize he crossed the magical barrier and entered the cell. He looked at Sherlock, kneeled next to John, the detective’s face contorted with grief, both physical and spiritual.
He hadn’t gone to St. Barts, as he told John. He hoped that, somehow, John let pass the reference about being wrecked in his blog. But deep in his heart, he knew John wouldn’t, he wished that John wouldn’t. And, magnificent John, he didn’t.
Police car lights were reflected in the yellow police tape. It was a small four floor apartments building and, according to the first interviews with potential witnesses, no neighbour had heard anything strange, noises, no fights, no screams ... but there, lying on the floor of his apartment was the woman’s still bleeding body. She must be in her thirties. Several officers searched for footprints and other biological remains around the room.
"That day I noticed something changed inside Mycroft. Something that reminded me of when he met Anthony. That's why I started asking him to come to the crime scenes and going to your office. I…" he lowered his head and swallowed hard. "I… owed him, because Anthony's death was my fault also. If I hadn't given the pen to that idiot who gave it to him instead of Mycroft..." he shook his head "Not that Anthony was better than you" he added quickly, worried.
He thought Sherlock's protests were provoked partly by jealousy and partly by the detective's insecurity about what might happen when John met Mike again. There was no point in the doctor reiterating he had nothing to worry about.
"What now?" asked Lestrade, turning in front of the warehouse that Sherlock and the others had just left half an hour ago.
John wasn't as drunk as to tell the whole truth. The truth about his stupid smile when Mycroft left his office, thinking about Sherlock proposing him. Or how he realized how badly he wanted to marry him, to call him his husband. Sad memories didn't come back. Instead of it, his heart was singing, and he felt like floating. Indeed he didn't have an engagement band, or Sherlock hadn't requested it in the usual way, but, as he suddenly realized, becoming Sherlock's husband made him happy.
"You're not thinking of leaving us there and going by yourself, are you?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
Six hours later, with a sore back, without having slept a wink, and grumbling, she started the taxi and stopped again in front of Baker Street, looking at the blue car parked in front of her, from which two men in black suits, watched her without the slightest dissimulation.
Both John and Greg took their fingers out of Sherlock and the doctor, after coating his cock with lube, rubbed the tip in the entrance, throwing his head back a bit and moaning in anticipation, teasing both himself at the detective at the same time. Greg moved near the headboard, his cock a few millimeters of Sherlock's mouth, so close that he could feel his warm breath on the tip as the detective groaned at the feeling of John's teasing cock.
far out of hand. And he wasn't wrong, because Tony, watching the detective's gaze, turned red and stepped back. "I don't need you to defend me," grunted the doctor.
Sherlock gulped audibly. Every time John gave him that order, the doctor became a merciless teasing demon, relentlessly teasing him, bringing him to the edge of orgasm over and over again without allowing him to come. John turned his fingers, and Sherlock moaned when he hit his prostate, making his cock jumping hard.
He wiped away his tears and watched Mycroft, who was moving and muttering in his sleep, uneasy. How could he have been so wrong?
John slid his hands from the detective's thighs and moved them upwards until they rested on his ass, caressing and squeezing them with his hands, while Sherlock, still trembling, groaned softly. The doctor adjusted the straps, Sherlock's ass was now at his mouth level, at John's full disposal.
First of all, he had to find a way to neutralize Mycroft and the rest, so he could leave by on his own, and then find a means of transport. He approached the Jeep and searched in his backpack. When he found what he was looking for, he smirked.
He told me it would help me to improve my trust in him, that I had nothing to fear, that we would stop the moment I wanted.
"Half an hour. And by prescription," Bruce pointed to the teenager with his index finger, "if you take any longer, I will come to get you myself, and you'll be grounded until you turn thirty."
"No, get on with Mycroft," interrupted the detective, stirring uncomfortably in his chair. "He got all of you a job, and he gave you references".
Sherlock took his hand and gently kissed it, hurt to see John like that. He opened what remained of John's shirt. The anger bubbled inside him, looking at his painfully swollen shoulder and the steady arm.
"Yeah, although all of Mr. Stark's devices are cool, too. I'll be Spiderman: inventor-medical-detective. How about that?"
John took his time, his tongue drawing around Sherlock’s entrance, again slowly circling to the centre of the ring, and then, he dipped his tongue inside.
The C.I.A. agent grabbed it and began to push the spirits away with all his might, trying to advance to John, but failing to do so.
"Quantum entanglement," cried Tony through the wind's hooting "in quantum physics, entangled particles remain connected so that actions performed on one affect the other, even when separated by great distances. Our Sherlock and the others are connected by it. This is how he knew where the other is".
Sherlock stood up and climbed nimbly onto the table. He waited obediently while John gasped for a few seconds, trying to regain control, holding on to the base of his cock so he wouldn't come.
"I know. You won't lose him," assured Mycroft, trying to sound confident. "John loves you, is extremely strong, and very bad-tempered. All of which will help him get through. Before you know it, he'll be nagging you about this mess you've made at the hospital.
"Interpol has issued an international arrest warrant for you, and the FBI has located you in New York, so..."
"Oh yes, yes, yes, yes," he moaned in bliss, when John's finger reached his prostate, taking care of not put too much pressure so Sherlock couldn't come  yet from the light touch.
“Get out, BOTH OF YOU!” he finally commanded. Mycroft breathed a sigh of relief and ran out of the room. The writer focused again on his papers. Donovan cleared his throat (once more!), cautiously.
Everett bowed his head and narrowed his eyes. He knew Stephen and that he would make fun of him, of his feelings. He would crush him. He and Tony would laugh at him later on. But Everett was a soldier, and he knew that once an attack was launched, the only way to win the battle was to go all the way, no matter what.
"But when I was bleeding, lying on the floor, alone, I knew I was about to die," he made a gesture towards the door. "I didn't feel the pain or was in shock. I only..."
"They are surrounding Irene's mansion. She will put Rosie the dungarees " Anthea's choked and worried voice filled the room. From her voice gasps and leaps, it was clear she was running at full speed. "I'm going to Baker Street."
John doubted a bit but finally confessed to him the thoughts that run through his mind. Soon the DI and Mike laughed so hard that they had their arms around their ribs, trying desperately to catch some air between giggles.
He looked at the doors of John’s wing. He bit his upper lip and lowered his head, drowning out a sob. Maybe today they will get closed forever.
"Sherlock was so angry he wouldn't have listened to me," Lestrade nodded, remembering how he tried to mediate between the two brothers. "First, about what I said to John about the restaurant and then about bringing him here. I knew that he would put the pieces together sooner or later, and at that moment, he would be willing to listen to me. Apart, I was too terrified. Any attempt to communicate with him could make them try to hurt Rosie."
When the living dead was about to pull up Lestrade's throat, something swooshed the air, and the zombie's head rolled on the ground. Amazed, Lestrade contemplated Sherlock's coat flapping over him.
"And it was YOU who provided me with the perfect alibi. I was with you, so I couldn't be there, organising those operations. No one can be at two places at the same time, can't they? Until you became one more obstacle to get rid of".
Sholto and the ex-soldiers have locked up rest of the mercenaries in one of the old dungeons of the castle, bound and gagged, waiting for the French police to enter and arrest them. They only left a handcuffed Mike with them.
John took Sherlock's hand and put it on his groin, so the detective could feel the doctor's hard cock under his trousers.
"We both know that's not true. The John Watson I know would already be putting on his jacket on his way to Scotland Yard to be with Sherlock. Instead, here you are, eating scrambled eggs with your landlady".
"What Clay said? Of course not. But I remembered Anthony," he looked sideways at his brother, who nodded slightly. "He used to say that if he heard Clay say that again, he would cut his jugular. He did a perfect impression of Clay, saying it, in that unbearably pedantic Clay's tone".
He wanted to get there before the others and see where the fault was. He came to the alley and looked at his watch. About ten minutes before the others arrived, precisely a quarter of an hour before the Sherlock from the previous timeline appeared in the alley. He bit his lips, guilty. He noticed Sherlock's anguished face, the fear of losing everything, so intense that not even the detective, with his exceptional ability to hide his feelings and act detached from them, could disguise.
"May I know what you were thinking, little brother? Don't you realize you put John and the others in danger? Can you tell me what you are playing at?"
Sherlock dropped the phone and was able to move away just a couple of steps before he vomited, terrified. Mycroft slowly got up and went over to him, hesitating to put his hand on his back. In between gagging, the detective's body shook violently.
The others looked at him without understanding, except Wong, Tony, and Bruce, who smiled and nodded slightly.
Unlike him, Sherlock, due to his random sleep patterns, fall asleep soundly, which allowed John to play with the detective without waking him. When John woke up before Sherlock, he liked caressing the sleuth’s lips with his index finger and poke it into his mouth. That usually made John groan imagining Sherlock was sucking his cock until he became so aroused that it wasn’t uncommon for the detective to wake up with the doctor straddled on his chest, while John’s cock gently fucked his mouth. The detective didn’t mind being woken up like that; quite the contrary, he sucked John’s cock eagerly till the doctor came in his mouth.
"So, yesterday, when you left the house, my brother was playing the violin," hissed Mycroft through his clenched teeth, making his umbrella spin between his hands, the contained raged palpable in his tone.
"Stop it!" John pretended it to be an order, but it came out like a whimper. He shook his leg, trying to get the detective far from his knee, but Sherlock's tongue stuck to it like a limpet, dodging John's kicks.
He had to control himself. He had to take charge of the children. But he was trembling, unable to breathe.
John trusting became erratic and finally, with a howl, came inside Sherlock, the detective squirming and wriggling feeling John’s hot cum inside until the doctor fell on Sherlock'’s body, both panting heavily.
"Sherlock thought we could use a driver," Molly looked sideways at Sally, who quickly understood she did not want Mrs. Hudson to know Rosie had been in danger.
Sherlock approached and ran the tip of his tongue over John's lips, savoring the chocolate, then kissing him eagerly, chocolate slipping down both of their chins as they ran their tongues over each other's mouths. They parted between giggles and Sherlock began to lick the chocolate off John's chin, while wiping his own with his hand, and then put it on John's jeans, filling them with chocolate.
"It's important that you get your education. And Tony does it because he cares about you. He's very fond of you."
Just as John predicted, the impressive erection Sherlock was showing until a second ago, deflated. He looked at the doctor with a mixture of surprise and anguish that almost broke John's heart.
Not entirely convinced, John took another sip. The wine had a stunning indigo blue color and had a sweet taste and aroma of fruit. He kissed Sherlock's neck again.
Thanks for every single kudos and comment. I really appreciate it. I hope you'll keep on enjoying the story :-)
They gasped as John grabbed Sherlock's neck and kissed him deeply, the detective's face almost turning vermilion while kissing the doctor back.
Bruce tilted his head and pressed his lips together, annoyed, looking dangerously at the detective, a greenish glow illuminating his eyes.
Just as the portal was about to close behind them, something prevented it with a metallic sound. As they turned around, they saw Thor, coming in behind them, wielding Stormbreaker.
It was the sign they were waiting for. The detective moved quickly, punching, kicking, and knocking down his attackers with force, while dodging blows with agility and ease, but more and more criminals were swirling around in the alley. The detective began to show signs of fatigue until a strong hook aimed at his jaw brought him down to the ground, where he received a shower of kicks, hits, and punches. Amazingly, Sherlock made no sound, not even the slightest whimper. He just shrank with the heavy blows, taunts, and laughter of his attackers until a hard kick to his head knocked him unconscious. After several more punches and kicks, they left the alley, and Sherlock laid on the ground, alone, in pain and blood.
"It seems to me that this little lady is becoming very impertinent," John approached her with a threatening air. “And we all know what happens to impertinent ladies."
He nodded. John smiled and took his hand. The detective let himself be led meekly into the dungeon. Once there, John made Sherlock lie down, stretched out his arms, and tied them to the table's corners. He spread his legs and tied them so that detective was motionless, obscenely open. He could only take what John wanted to do with him.
They ran at full speed through the ruins, surrounded by the frustrated and crazed ghostly howling, which pushed them to go even faster.
He was sure that it had been Rosie’s enthusiasm and joy in every activity, which prevented the detective from sulking and complaining about the lack of crimes and blood around him. As well as the nights they spent in the private cove, some involving wild rough sex, others tenderly making love, each one going through the other’s body with soft kisses, caresses, whispering praises and words of love only listened by the sea. Not forgetting the cold cases that Lestrade sent Sherlock on the phone and the detective solved from his deckchair while he pretended to be reading a scientific magazine.
The others followed his example, throwing bushes, earth, and stones away; a small drill bit appeared under his feet.
To John's amazement, Sherlock, who was lying on the couch reading a book, fell to the floor on his knees and opened his arms to the sky.
"Sherlock, please," replied the detective, shaking her hand. John narrowed his eyes, looking at the Russian spy.
John passed the cap, so each of them could take his paper. If any of them tried to snoop it, they were quickly rebuked by the rest, especially by Rosie, who, looking wide-eyed at her father, seemed about to burst with pride.
A black silence enveloped him. He would have given anything to hear any of the sounds that used to come from it: John and Sherlock arguing, John scolding Sherlock, Sherlock firing at the wall, playing the violin, John typing on his computer or protesting because the detective appropriated it, the sound of the kettle boiling… but there was only a deafening silence.
"My husband built it to hide the black money from the drug," explained Mrs Hudson, "I searched the entire floor for months without finding it. The same day Sherlock came to see it, a couple of days before meeting John and moving here, he found it and gave the money it to me. At first, he used it to hid drugs, but soon he stopped. With John, he didn't need them." She shook his head, sad. "It was when John got married Mary and left Baker Street that he started using it again to hide them".
"Clay, please" begged Mycroft, showing Clay the signed confessions. "You've proved that you're smarter than Sherlock, that you're smarter than me," his former agent's face lit up. "Tell us how to disarm them".
“Yes, they are. They helped me to find a reason to keep on living. And tonight, watching at the kids feeding the animals, I can feel my Jack here again with me, smiling, enjoying watching them too” his voice broke with emotion, his eyes shiny from tears. “This is why I brought them here. They are the first to see the animals since Jack… left”.
The woman laughed out loud and wrote something down on a piece of paper. Lestrade, Donovan, and the rest looked at her in amazement.
She shook his head, trying to dispel old painful memories. She said goodbye to Mycroft and came out to the street. She checked her phone. Ten calls from the Chief Superintendent, four from Anderson and two from Dimmock. Great. All went from bad to worse. She should go back to Scotland Yard.
The detective stood and pushed John down to make him sit on the couch. Sherlock pulled down his pyjama pants, freeing his cock and carefully straddled John, blocking the doctor's hips with his tights.
The Ghillie Dhu is a magical creature of Scottish folklore, but I thought it fit perfectly for the final chapter, so I took myself the liberty to move him to London :-) , since it is described as a gentle and kind-hearted mountain spirit.
"I don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to see that. Why someone as posh as he would resort to homelessness to rescue his husband? He could have hired a bunch of professionals. And he didn't. It is clear that, at some point, he hit bottom and descended into hell. And you or someone helped him out. That's why he believed and trusted you. Not to mention that he is in love with you to the core".
He washed and emptied the eggplant contents into a dish when the vibrator started torturing his prostate again.
The sleuth waited till one the men entered into the tent nearest to him, which was out of sight from the shed, and, jumping on it, he trapped the man inside the fabric. The man cursed, kicked and fought, but before he could free himself, Sherlock quickly removed the tent fixings and wrapped the cloth around the man’s body. Finally, he knelt on the man and used the tent ropes to fix the pack firmly. The man kept kicked frantically, but the fabric muffled his shouts. Sherlock dragged the lump out of the camp and, searching for a stone, knocked down the other man, in the same way, the first four, and hauling the body next to the first one; he tied him up with the rest of the tent ropes.
She closed her eyes, about to cry with relief, pressed the button, and waited to open the door until she saw the driver through the peephole. He was wearing a large cap, and a big scarf almost covered his face, probably due to a bad cold, since he was coughing hard.
The detective moved his left leg forward, his right leg backward, clinging to the ground, his fists in a defensive position, waiting. The man, bewildered and out of patience, lashed out with another hard right that Sherlock blocked with his left forearm while flexing his legs, his right fist smashing the man's liver with all its force. The man grunted in pain and staggered backward, covering the area of the blow with his hand.
“So, we wanted to give this to you,” and the kids hugged both men with all the strength of their little arms. Sherlock and John hugged the kids back, and John winked to Sherlock.
"Unless what has jumped from one universe to another, it jumps to a different one, realizing that it can travel between them. Then it can move at will," replied Bruce, and Stephen nodded.
Fortunately, Rosie didn't realize the man cut himself. He smiled sadly and looked at John, who could imagine this was how the conversations at Sherlock's house were after Victor's disappearance: whispers, half-sentences..., and, in the midst of all this, two children trying to overcome as best they could.
"Sherlock sent a message with a complementary plan" she looked sideways at his mobile, resting on the coffee table next to a piece of handwritten paper, and an open book placed face down opened in the middle. Donovan, curious, read it.
"And now off to bed. If John finds out you're awake at this time of the night..." threatened Sherlock in a mocking tone.
"Don't tell him I told you. He'll kill me if he finds out. And now get dressed. You won't be late for your wedding day."
The two living dead turned and jumped over the dissection table in the detective’s direction. They were faster than Sherlock expected, and he barely had time to shoot them while they came upon him. Molly screamed again, watching the three bodies rolling around the ground. Seconds after, Sherlock stood, a bit dizzy, unaware of a third body jumping over him. Before it could reach the detective, three bullets made the zombie fall into the floor. Sherlock looked at Molly, who was holding his gun and bowed his head lightly. Molly smiled, scared, her hands and his lower lip trembling, but with a fierce look in her eyes.
"Don't listen to her. At Aunt Irene's, you don't eat vegetables, can watch TV, play videogames non-stop and eat all the ice cream we want. Here we do bad thingssssss," Irene wriggled her eyebrows comically, provoking the girl's laughter.
He patted the ground next to him, looking for the stick. When he found it, he lifted it into the air, to hit John. When the bullet passed through his brain, he dropped it.
"Sherlock called me and said: You have a table booked with Irene at Angelo's tomorrow at nine. There will be a candle. Don't miss it. Wear lipstick."
. She sighed and settled down in her seat, fighting the impulse to turn around and look at the car following them.
Lestrade scratched his head, sure that something was wrong inside it. Otherwise, why had he been putting up with Sherlock at crime scenes for years only to become the boyfriend of his insufferable brother? But it was true that Mycroft, like Sherlock, never begged.
He stripped and crawled into the bathtub, groaning at the contact with the warm water. A deep moan filled the place when he finally, finally!, let his hand caress over the shaft of his cock, stroking it slowly up and down, the oily water allowing his hand to rub smoothly, teasing the tip with his palm. Soon, he increased the pace and panted, clenching his eyes while biting his lower lip, arching his back and bucking his hips in an attempt to fuck his fist, until he came with an animalistic groan, splashing water out of the tub while his body wriggled and tensed, his other hand slipping over the tiles looking for someplace to hold to.
“Do you want me to hit you with it so you realize it’s real?” he pulled the book out of her hands. “Now, leave me alone. I’m really enjoying it. This Sherlock Holmes is brilliant.
Lestrade closed his eyes. He knew Mycroft was playing with the poor man like a cat with a mouse, waiting for the perfect moment to launch the final, fatal, and merciless attack.
Lestrade snorted. Mycroft cast him a warning glance, and Lestrade turned to look at the river, biting his lips to keep from laughing.
Greg took off the clamps still vibrating on Mycroft nipples, and almost laughed at the relieved groan that it provoked in Mycroft. He kissed him on the lips gently, and untied the exhausted body, checking that none of the ties had hurt him.
"Yes, but sometimes they treat me like a child. They make me do my homework and all that, especially Mr. Stark."
"Get on the B right away. We will soon have company", she answered hastily. Donovan hummed, understanding what she meant, and hung up.
Stephen decided he didn't want to hear it; he couldn't. If Everett talked, it would take away the only thing he had left: his daydreams. Knowing the truth would take that away.
“You didn’t tell me anything when I went to the hospital” Mycroft’s tone was low and cracked, a bit hurt, but infinitely sad.
“Oh, fucking holy shit!” finally managed to pant Sherlock, as the doctor took the detective’s cock out of his mouth. He tried to pull up John, but the doctor remained firmly on the ground.
This time, Mark got behind the wheel of the truck, driving him away as quickly as possible, while the SAS Captain, who was also a doctor, attended to John and the others.
Sherlock climbed in the helicopter, immediately subdued by two ghouls that restrained him, forcing him to kneel down. Sherlock heard Lestrade yelling as the aircraft took off.
Both men looked at each other. Sherlock nodded almost imperceptibly and kept on walking. Watson turn on his heels in order to face Donovan, who could swear John looked at her colder than usual. She cleared her throat.
“Rosie, the water is farther than I thought” the little girl frowned “If it takes me a long time to come back, tomorrow you should ask someone to get all of you back home, do you understand?”
"I can't do that. As Bruce says, he became aware that he can travel between different universes. Once he realized that, he leaves no trace when he goes from one universe to another," he sighed. "It's not about going back to a particular time in the past. That would be easy. It's about going back to the birth of an anomaly in the space-time continuum and ..."
"Maybe he is at his own stag party," suggested Bill, wickedly "surrounded by oily muscled male strippers dancing around him."
But he needed something to let Sherlock know that he wasn't buried there. Otherwise, if they found the graves and left them for dead, they would wait until they could repatriate the bodies. And by the time they realized the deception, it would be too late. His hand trembling, blocking the painful memories it brought to him, the doctor wrote Sherlock's initials on a third stone.
“You two, stop paying compliments to each other! Sherlock, you don’t have time to waste. Go for the children!” ordered Molly and Sherlock rushed, looking around for the next piece.
The three set out to combat the spirits that were rushing at them, while Strange multiplied himself, creating whips that sparkled as they collided with the ghosts, making them retreat.
When they got off the plane and arrived at the airport gate, a driver was waiting for them. He took them to the car that went into the island. Sherlock put on his sunglasses and huddled against the window, squinting at the island's brightness, while John commented with Rosie on the coves, buildings, and animals they found on the way.
“At least, you could tell me where the hell we are going,” said Sally through her clenched teeth, her body bouncing from side to side as Greg eluded pedestrians and civil cars.
"But you can chat to them on Skype or Facetime” John smiled and kissed her on the head. "I understand you. It's the same for me. Not your father, because he is craving for a good crime, even though he has put up with a lot. Next summer, if you want to and your father doesn't commit hara-kiri himself, we'll come back”.
"Sherlock, I'm a doctor. I can't let anyone die. I took an oath to save lives," he swallowed. He could see Donovan's chest rise and fall almost imperceptibly. If they didn't help her, she would die. On the other hand, this was the perfect opportunity to get Sherlock to untie him. "You can't make me carry that around on my conscience. How am I going to practice medicine after...?"
"What about the price to be paid? The murders? The... dimensions?" asked John, hugging Sherlock tightly.
, fuck me, please, fuck me" he begged, ashamed to show himself so needy, of those desperate whines he emitted at the rub John's cock on his ass, of how the desire to be impaled deeply by John's cock fogged his mind but he couldn't control it.
"Poor is the pupil who does not surpass his master, Mycroft" they heard the detective say a minute later.
"In short, the dog you've always dreamed of finding. You call him, offer him food, toys, caress him…"
She got up, took the momentum, and ran, jumping from roof to roof until she reached the last building on the block, covered with scaffolding, just as Sherlock did every night as he prepared for his trip to Afghanistan or when he carried Rosie to Molly's.
Mycroft ran out of breath when he recognised the man, memories, guilt and grief, striking him with the force of a heavy truck.
He was hurt and disconcerted that Mycroft hadn't told him about Anthony, especially when he had asked him to marry him that very day Although he knew it wasn't due to a lack of trust, he couldn't feel a bit betrayed. And stupidly jealous.
"Doctor Watson, believe it or not, I have a doorbell." Mycroft smiled forcibly as he opened the door after several minutes of listening to John pounding on it and threatening if he didn't open it.
"I don't think your Papa would leave Baker Street for anything in the world, but you can come here whenever you want," said Geena, leaving the colossal potato salad bowl in the center of the table and taking the girl's plate to serve her. She threw in a considerable ladle and gave it to her. The girl filled the fork and tried it out.
"Mike's rescue operation was... clandestine, in some way. Only a few of us knew about it. If my name comes up connected with the request for a hypersonic aircraft, mobilizing troops near it..."
The Captain held out to the Major an object consisting of a handle about a foot long attached to a small horizontal cylinder, which vaguely reminded Sholto of the cheese grater he had in the kitchen. He weighed it.
Meanwhile, Stephen summoned two blades, throwing one to Sherlock and the other to Natasha, while wrapping Ironman's armor in a spell, so he could fight spirits.
They got into the car that took them directly to the airport, to the T5 terminal, bound for Palma de Mallorca. Rosie, tired and already calm from being on the plane, curled up at the window.
“To finally fuck you in the mattress, giving you the ride of your life, fucking you so hard that you would be walking funny for a week.”
Both men glared at each other, panting, trying to control their temper. They didn't want to say anything that would hurt the other and mess everything up again, but the situation became more challenging to handle.
When he came to, soldiers were arguing sourly among themselves, now many more. Although they all spoke in Farsi, they did so with different accents. They weren't soldiers. They were mercenaries.
"Doctor Watson, you don't understand the seriousness of... You don't know what it takes to do what Sherlock just did".
The detective didn't answer. He'd been pouting on the couch all day. It was the eighth day of the quarantine, he had no more samples to test, and Lestrade just told him he had no more cases he could solve from home.
"Fuck!" he groaned when, in the air, Luke grabbed his legs above his knees as Bill placed his hands at the top of the back of his tights, both pushing him up so hard he could reach the ceiling. Something wrapped in a plastic bag crushed the wall, spinning on itself like a rugby ball and flew at full speed straight to the detective's hand. He caught it cleanly, and Bill and Luke lowered him to the ground.
"You've just missed the beginning. Every day, the girl does an hour's homework. The first day she did it with Mr. Holmes".
"Welcome. And now, go get some rest. Everything will return to normality. But get upstairs before Mama Bear realizes you're late, and Papa Bear sends all MI6 after you".
"Go on, give it to me," he ordered fondly, taking the phone away from him. He frowned at the message Sherlock was trying to send.
But Lestrade knew that he didn't try hard enough to contact him, to comfort his friend in the fifteen days that had passed since the detective's death. Because John was his friend, and he, full of guilt and anguish, wasn't there when John needed him most. He didn't know how to help him if anyone could.
Soon, the office was filled by the gunfire's roar, the smell of powder and horrified officer's cries where they were bitten by the zombies, mixed with living deads' guttural sounds.
"Don't lose your hat, cowboy, you've got a wild horse to ride tonight," whispered John naughtily, slapping the detective's arse, who shouted, "yiiiiihaaaa" and trotted back into the living room to help Rosie remove the tea set.
But doctors advised them against penetrative sex until John's staples were removed, to prevent the wounds from reopening. So Sherlock, afraid of John backtracking on his healing, had been dodging him, adamant about John's demands, which only increased their lust.
The detective kept his eyes closed. He felt dizzy, exhilarated, and he didn't want the dream to end. Kissing John had felt so great…
"Clay went after him. Sherlock realised it and handed over a USB drive where he gathered all the evidence to one of his homeless so that he could give it to Mycroft. Minutes later, several of Clay's men kidnapped him, beat him brutally and left him for dead in an abandoned warehouse".
"It has been a true pleasure to have you here. I can never thank you enough for bringing Sherlock back. In every way. When he asked us to prepare the house, we couldn't believe it. He never returned after Victor's disappearance. Too many memories, I'm afraid”.
At the top of the plane's flight deck, Sholto looked around. The airfield was semi-clandestine, but he was sure anywhere a flight could take off from there would now be heavily guarded by New Scotland Yard officers, especially if what was taking off was a Cessna Citation X/ X.
Finally, the length of the work was longer than I expected, so I had to increase the number of chapters.
Everett frowned while beating down spirits, who whispered Strange's name repeatedly, any time higher.
"Do you really think that I wouldn't read a letter you wrote to me thinking you were going to die? Please. Be thankful that I didn't do it in front of the whole NSY".
Steve hesitated. He didn't want to hurt John. He knew the doctor only wanted to protect Sherlock, and, as a soldier, he would do anything to achieve his goal. He wouldn't shoot him unless it were necessary. Otherwise, John would have done already. But the recording and FRIDAY confirmed the detective was a murderer.
Several walking dead managed to straddle the gunfire and approached John, Donovan, and Lestrade. They repeatedly shot at them and were so concentrated in that group that wasn't aware of a zombie that walking by the ceiling, dropped himself on Lestrade, making him fall to the floor, the zombie sat on him.
Stephen would give anything to make Everett notice him, love him with the same intensity he loved Ross. But his magic, like the rest of the universe, had two limitations: love and death. Nothing, not even the most potent of myriads, could change them. Stephen knew this well. He spent hours in the New York sanctum looking for some spell to make Everett's feelings for him change. But magic couldn't fight the free will that love implies.
“Kids are not your thing, huh?” laughed Rowan. Sherlock shook his head and bit his lower lip, ashamed.
Inside the vault, surrounded by a large group of ghosts from the past, Steve stood up. He let Thor contact his shield with Stormbreaker, electrifying it. He took up a combat stance,
"Because I have to… punish Sherlock," he said, lowering his tone, looking hungrily at the detective.
"Do you remember their names?" asked Mycroft. John nodded and told him. The older Holmes called Anthea and recited them.
"Shhhhhhh," sushed the doctor, just like Sherlock did when he was tied up. He winked, "It will be perfect; you'll see."
"I was tipping on my computer about our last case. It was summer, the seventeenth of July, and Sherlock was in the kitchen, embedded in some of his experiments. Then he asked me if I had anything scheduled for the twenty-five of November!" John smiled with the memory. "I didn't pay close attention to him, but I remember muttering that I was free. He kept on with his experiment. Five minutes later, he said that, as both of us were free, it would be the perfect day for getting married, based in only God knows what calculations or deductions he had done."
"Don't you want to come? I thought you would love time travel," asked Tony, noticing Peter wasn't bothered for not time-traveling.
"Not we. All of you," he pointed to John and his friends, "will go back to London. You are not in a condition to…"
“Denatonium benzoate. The bitterest chemical compound known. It’s used in the products for discouraging nail-biting. It was present in several pieces of evidence I found at his brother’s burned house”.
He couldn't do that to John, not again, not on his wedding day. He rolled until he laid on his side, sobbing quietly, the weight of grief barely allowing him to breathe.
"Yes, but you can't take them all with you. We would need to live in a house like Mycroft's," warned John.
"We don't even know if he is there." The pathologist grabbed her arm, trying to stop her from getting into the cab as the sergeant attended the scene in bewilderment. Mrs. Hudson broke loose from Molly and got into the cab.
