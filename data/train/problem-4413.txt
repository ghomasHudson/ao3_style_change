Charlie hopped up and grabbed her keys. "Cmon, cas. Let's get moving!" she let him out first and waved at Dean and Sam before sliding out the door and heading to the car.
"No, wait." Dean grabbed his wrists gently. "Stop that. You don't owe me anything. Everyone needs clothes." It was hard to push the omega away, because goddamn he was gorgeous with those big blue eyes and enticing scent, but he always learned from his omega mom to treat everyone with respect, no matter what nonsense his father practiced. "Just... get dressed, if you wanna clean up the guest bathroom is through that door." He pointed at a door on the far wall.
Castiel remembered this beta, and moved quickly to hide behind another omega. Felix did NOT look happy and he glared at Sam and Dean, "really, young masters? You know how to behave like proper young men. You should not indulge in this foolishness."
"I need to cuddle something small and pup like but I don't have anything like that," he replied softly, looking up to the other alpha.
Dean narrowed his eyes, hair on the back of his neck standing up and fangs extending in pure reaction. He could see why aggressive alphas might like this sport, and why there were so many fights amongst the crowd at events. He found himself growling and cuddling castiel in a protective pose, Sam looking over at the noise, "the hell is wrong with you?"
Dean accepted bites from Castiel, smiling, "mmm, strawberry. Charlie has good taste." He leaned and kissed cas with sticky lips, grinning.
Castiel nodded, "it is, it's so quiet, and feels so safe." He smiled as he heard kids playing, and a dog bark, "it would be a nice place to move one day."
Dean sat up a little and blinked at them both from the other bed. "The hell is going on?" he asked drowsily, and Sam looked at Cas. He wouldn't say anything if Cas didn't try to leave.
Dean ran his hands over his cars lovingly, patting the hoods as they headed into the mansion. All the servants greeted them at the door, every one of them looking very happy at everything going on. Adam had also been moved to his own bed to keep healing, and the mansion really felt like it could be calm and peaceful now.
"I see," Dean wiped his greasy hands off on a rag, "well, I won't tell you where to go or who to hang out with, and I guess Adam is safer than anyone else except Sam." He turned to look at him, "why dont you eat lunch with me and then go back when I have to go to actual work with dad? I just don't hang out with Adam."
"So perfect," Dean moaned against him, very carefully sliding off Castiel's panties. There was no way he would risk ripping these, he definitely wanted to see them on cas again
Dean nodded, leaning his head on his hand. "Yeah. Hes pretty naive to anything in the world except breeding," he sighed, "I'm so in love with him, Charlie. Just look at him, he's perfect."
Desn pulled back to look at him, a huge smile on his face, "yeah, cas. I'd love to try for some pups." He kissed his lips again, even more deeply this time.
John sighed, "Looks like I'll have to make sure you understand what's happening here. I know you must be enjoying your new, privileged lifestyle, but if you're not bite claimed AND pupped by your next heat, you'll be sent back to that filthy whore house immediately. Do I make myself clear?" John yanked Castiel's head up to look at him directly, eyes bright alpha red.
Castiel closed his eyes and sighed as he spoke softly,  "I love you, alpha. I'm sorry I'm so much trouble."
Castiels purr was light and airy and beautiful, the vibrations of it against Dean's chest made him smile. He wondered when the last time Castiel really purred was. "Yeah? Better than Sam?" he asked, genuinely curious. He was worried Castiel may be growing to like Sam better, in which case Dean would have to let him go. Whatever made Cas happy would be what made Dean happy.
Gabriel blinked at him, "wait...no way. Cassie?" He peered closer, scenting him, "oh my god, it is you. What the... I thought our parents had killed you for sure." He swept Castiel into a hug, squeezing him.
Sam smiled, shaking his head. "So protective, even in sleep," he motioned to Dean curled around Cas.
Gabriel nodded, picking a cheesecake for his cart instead. "I can't believe our parents would do that to you. I mean, I knew we were poor and there were a lot of us, but a breeding house?" Gabriel scowled.
Charlie smiled as she unpacked the food and started to put it away. She didn't mind that Cas got diatracted, today was a big day for him.
Castiel purred into the kiss and started to get slick, wiggling. He started to push his pajama pants off, grinning, "alpha, why was it so sexy seeing you tell him off?"
Castiel looked at his brother and felt so bad, "can you walk with us Gabriel? I can talk while we walk."
John ran his hand over the curve of Castiel's ass then along his belly. "Slender hips for an omega. How many pups have you birthed?" He demanded, squeezing his sides a little too roughly.
Dean huddled Castiel into his chest and took his hand, "just rest, sweetheart. It's been a long day for you."
"She's fine, cas. She's a beta, and mated." Gabriel hugged him, "she's definitely going to want to see you again."
Dean smiled, pressing a long kiss to Castiel's forehead, "really good news, sweetheart. No one is gonna have to sell anything. Charlie invited us to stay with her. I'm gonna call her now."
Charlie's house was a cozy little thing on the edge of town, "so I have a huge couch Sam can crash on and Cas, you and Dean can have the spare bedroom, just don't break any furniture."
"He's like those alphas in the stories they told to us as kids. He is so strong, and protective. He lets me pick what I want to wear." Castiel said fondly, "and he loves the nests I make."
Castiel smiled and kissed his lips. "Thank you alpha. I think you will like them," he said as he scented Dean, just so happy. He would get to see all his siblings again. "Maybe.. we can all meet at a park?" he asked thinking out loud and Charlie smiled,
Dean reached them first, teeth snapping as he slugged the alpha who'd grabbed Cas across the face, snarling, "fucking asshole." Blood red eyes burned into the man as he huddled Cas behind him.
Castiel smiled as he responded, "yes, Please come in." He liked her voice, she sounded so cheerful. When she came in he gasped, "I love your hair. It's so pretty."
Dean looked at him seriously, expression soft and non judgemental. "Whatever you feel is right. If you want a pup, I'm open to the idea, but it might be good to have you wait a while, give you and your body a break."
He didn't mean to do that. He only meant to think it. Oh God. He went too far, Dean would be mad. He would be punished, pain was coming and he steeled himself for it. Dean looked strong too. How would the alpha hurt him?
Dean pulled up into Charlie's driveway, setting the parking brake, "I'll grab the leftovers, you just go on in." Cas nodded and climbed out of the small car.
Dean showered and climbed out in a towel, heading to his room to get dressed. He was a little concerned about leaving Castiel by himself after that panic attack that morning, so he did so as quickly as possible. He saw Castiel sitting on the bed quietly, head dipped, and smiled, "You could always go watch tv or something, Cas." He pointed out the remote and leaned into his closet to find something to wear.
Dean noticed him having a hard time deciding and stood, brushing himself off. "Let's all go to the kitchen. We can get you a proper meal," he offered a hand to help Cas stand, soft expression on his face and green eyes looking at him affectionately, still worried.
Charlie arched a brow and reached out and smacked his arm sharply, "hey, this is planning. It will happen. John will see how he can't do the job, and he will ask you to come back, Cas too. And you know what?"
Castiel slowly calmed and told him how he had been having breakfast with Sam in the kitchen. He spoke about how Sam showed him and etiquette video, and explained that if John or Dean were to tell him to present in front of everyone he had to, "and I got mad and said that even at the breeding house we had a room to do that. I didn't know Felix was behind me when I said it."
Smelling Dean's scent souring, Castiel fell into a full blow panic attack. He fell to the floor and started whine in terror. He couldn't breathe.
Dean grinned, "no kidding." He paused as the music came on and smiled fondly, taking Cas in his arms and beginning to dance with him.
Sam rolled over, blinking at the movement. "Cas? What're you doing?" he rubbed sleep from his eyes, "it's dangerous out there for you."
"Because we both hate his guts," Dean whispered as if telling a secret, giving Cas a big smile and tugging his shirt over his head.
Castiel smiled gently, and finally asked, "Alpha, does the blood bond hurt? We've been told terrible stories about that and  it scares me to have a wound like that done to me."
Dean stared at him, heart shattering, unable to say anything. He pushed the jello aside and pulled Cas into an embrace, burying his face into Castiel's neck, "no. You're not allowed to leave me, okay? There will never be anyone like you. I need you."
"Castiel? The omega from the breeding house?" Felix asked, and the moment the words "breeding house" were said, the kitchen staff moved away from Castiel as if he had the plague. Felix looked at Castiel disapprovingly, "This is not how you should be behaving. Perhaps I take you to speak to Master Winchester." Castiel tensed and looked at the brothers. They wouldn't allow that, right?
"When we were twenty one, I scraped together the money to buy a ring. I only told two people — Dean, and my best friend Brady." Sam closed his eyes and took a deep breath, steeling himself for the bad part. "Well, it turned out Brady had a drug problem, and he was in debt to some pretty dangerous people. He thought that diamond would get them off his back, so he went to our apartment when I wasn't home, and of course Jess let him in. Why shouldn't she? He was our best friend. I don't know exactly what happened next, but it ended with Jess bleeding to death on the floor. I found her hours later."
Dean tensed, his hand squeezing Castiel's shoulder a little harder. "Cas, were you…" He didn't seem able to make himself say the words.
Sam nodded when told about the severity of the injuries, unsurprised his father hadn't even tried to reign in his superior alpha strength, "is he stable?" If Sam didn't get back by the time the servants had lights out he'd be the one in big trouble.
Castiel smiled and looked at the nest and said, "I think that would great. It was missing something, other than my alpha." He walked away to find more pillows.
Castiel gave Adam his lunch and sat down to watch him play. He didn't even realising he was crying until Adam asked him if he was okay.
Sam jerked awake. "I'm up!" He said as he sat up quickly. "Temporary home? With who?" he asked with a yawn before adjusting the clothes he slept in. He used his fingers to brush his hair carefully then turned on the tv for a little background noise.
"Sorry. Instinctual reaction," Dean licked his lips and let his arms loosen on Cas. "Just thinking about you being around that alpha puts me on edge," he took a breath of Castiel's scent, trying to relax.
Castiel was silent as they walked to John's office. He nodded at Dean and turned to the door and knocked, his heart racing. John called for him to come in and he slowly stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. "I was told you wanted to see me, alpha?"
He wanted to know more about why Dean avoided Adam. It wasn't like Adam was another alpha and would try to take him away. That couldn't possibly be the only reason.
Castiel looked at him curiously and replied, "I followed your scent here. Are you related to Dean? Why didn't I meet you yesterday?" He had to squint since the room was so dimly lit. The beta didn't look sick, did he just like the dark?
Gabriel stood there looking confused, "this is all a lot. Are you Castiel's mate?" An omega and omega? "Who's Dean? Why are you so scared?"
"You could make vlogs. Those are like video journaling. And sometimes people that do only do that get really popular." Castiel looked at Sam and nodded, maybe he could do that.
Castiel stood and looked over at Dean, squeezing his arm reassuringly, "I'll be okay alpha, and Charlie has a phone so you can call her if you get worried." He leaned in and nuzzled the other happily.
Castiel laughed and playfully ran his nails up and down Deans back. He wasn't embarrassed as they passed by the grinning servants. He knew they were just happy that he and Dean were happy. As they were about to get to Dean's bedroom, Felix called out from the corner, "Dean, as your father is unable to work today, the tasks fall to you. Playtime can wait for now."
Anna looked from Dean to Castiel with tears in her eyes, "oh, poor Cassie... We have you to thank for him still being here. You might not think it's a big deal, but for us, you gave the world back to us."
Dean tensed a little and gave a shrug, "my dad and I butt heads alot and after what happened at the benefit dinner I don't know what he's going to do. I'm going to give it a week and if I don't hear back I'll be job hunting here in the city. There's a lot of pressure on my dad right now to step down from CEO, but he's a stubborn bastard and I don't know if he actually will before the business runs into the ground."
Castiel looked at him and then the screen. It seemed strange, but it sounded like an interesting movie, "why does the robot cp3o have a British voice?"
The next day they went back to the mansion as soon as John said all of his and Felix's things were gone. Castiel thanked Charlie for all her help and couldn't wait to see his new friend again soon. He was already planning on having his siblings over to visit and stay the night.
"Birth control is a pill to make it so sex wouldn't give you pups. Heat suppressants work so you don't have heats until you stop taking the meds," Dean explained, more than a little concerned about Cas not knowing anything about his own reproductive rights.
Castiel slowly uncurled and scooted closer to him, "he didn't do anything but talk to me. Before I left his room just now he touched my knee to comfort me but that was all." He then nuzzled him, still hurt that Dean thought he would cheat on him so easily, but needing the contact.
Castiel slowly picked up how to text by texting Gabriel and setting the barbecue for that weekend. He began to learn how to use that video website Sam used earlier, Charlie even made him an account, "you can make your own videos and post them for everyone to see, Cas. If enough people like it, this website pays you."
Castiel smiled, "yes especially those ones." He pointed at the screen, "I think they called them French Bulldogs." He got up and went over to Dean and nuzzled the back of his neck, sensing his tension.
Castiel blushed and nodded. "It was. I've never felt anything that good before," he replied with a shy smile.
Dean got up, looking at his least favorite servant and giving him a huge grin. "Fuck off, Felix." He patted Felix's pristine uniform with flour covered hands and glanced over his shoulder. "Cas, c'mon. We'll have someone bring us a meal." He held out a hand, smiling reassuringly.
Dean nodded, tucking Castiel under his chin, "it's just an alpha thing. I'm sure her mate is very happy."
John looked him up and down, "turn around, omega." He inspected the back and sighed, "it's not as delicate or see through as I might have hoped, but the heels are nice and you look acceptable. Let's just hope you behave as well as look the part."
Castiel smiled and leaned against him, "it's amazing isn't it, alpha? Knowing there is a little life in there, soon to come out and join us and maybe help make it a better world."
As their lips touched he felt something click inside him. His eyes shifted right to omega gold and he purred into the kiss. His scent suddenly got sweeter, warmer. Castiel inhaled, Dean's scent was so much stronger now. He couldn't help as he started to get slick, a soft little moan escaping him.
Dean leaned in and pressed soft lips there, nibbling a little before turning his head and rubbing his stubbled cheek against his throat, marking him across his neck. Then he did it to his wrists, nibbling lightly at the skin there and switching to the other side of his neck. When he was satisfied he pulled back to look into castiels eyes, smiling. His omega would smell like him and only him until his next wash.
Castiel closed his eyes but didn't sleep. He was waiting, and once he heard Dean's gentle snoring and checked to see if Sam was sleeping too, he slowly started to sneak out of the bed. He grabbed the key card for the room before slowly tiptoeing to the door.
Castiel nodded and cuddled up to Dean ), glancing at Sam as he got back into his bed. Sam was right, but he still wanted to do something to help them too. "Dean, the dress I wore tonight, sell that too. It's worth a lot right?"
Dean squeezed his fingers lightly and led him to the french doors past the living area that led out into the mesh covered pool, sun streaming in. Dean set the towels aside and climbed in the shallow end, the water heated to a pleasant temperature, "here, hop in."
"You mean you calmed him down. I doubt any of the rest of us could have," Dean told him as he took a right turn, "it's obvious they all love you very much. We should get you a phone so you can talk to them all the time."
"What, Charlie?" Dean looked up at her, slightly hopeful look in his eyes. He didnt know when or if Cas would be able to have the ceremony, but he wanted to give him everything he deserved.
Lucifer chuckled, "occasionally, but if I went I might just end up beating the old man near death for what he did to Castiel alone."
"Good." John stared into his gold eyes a second longer. "Get out of here." He released Cas and turned back to his desk, sitting down.
Castiel bit his lip as they drove down the road. Sam did not look happy in the mirror. "Are you sure you're okay?" Castiel asked, trying not to giggle at the sight. He looked over to Charlie and saw she was trying not to smile either.
That was all it took and Castiel was off Dean's lap and snarled, "would you be okay if you were forced to have a random alphas pup!!?" The sounds in the room died instantly and everyone looked at Castiel and the table he was at. Every omega looked at Castiel in shock. No omega ever did that, stare like he was, eyes omega gold in rage glaring at an alpha like that.
Castiel smiled and whispered back, "thank you." He then faced the man that was to wed them. The man spoke of how two people from two very different walks of life came together and found a love most only dream of. Soon the man asked, "Dean, do you take this omega, Castiel, as your mate? To have and hold, in sickness and in health, for all the days of your life?"
Castiel walked over and nodded, "Yeah, honestly I don't know anything about them. I came from a breeding house, so..." He looked down and trailed off, hoping she wouldn't leave, disgusted that he had been in a breeding house.
Dean growled softly, holding Cas tight, "Felix will never get me to let you go. You're mine now, and I want to mate you and have you here the rest of our lives." He tilted his head back to let Cas rub and kiss at his neck. "I'm sorry for seeming like I'm not trusting you, but its Adam I don't trust. Not you.
Sam shook his head a little, "cowardice. I didnt want to be the one guy out who made friends with someone everyone hates. Castiel was the only one brave enough to do that."
"Yeah, sure. Shoot." Sam gave him a smile over his shoulder and led him along a hall of rooms, "and don't be too worried, you'll get used to finding your way around. You can also just scent Dean out after you get to know him, I guess."
"I had a pup each year," Cas replied softly. "All but one went to live with their alpha father. I wasn't even allowed to hold them, feed them..." his voice broke, and he realized how much he said and backed away, neck bared submissively. "I'm sorry! I said too much. Forgive me alpha, I won't mention it again."
Dean spent the next hour teaching Cas how to move around and tread water. Then, he just lay with Cas on the poolside lounge chairs, hand in hand, soaking up the sun as they dried off.
Adam shut off the game completely and turned to face Castiel, looking thoughtful. He reached a hand out and set it gently on his knee, "Castiel, I don't think it's you, I don't even think it's because you want friends. Dean's an alpha. He's got hormones and instincts running through his body that you and I don't have. He hasn't blood bonded with you yet and my scent is probably covering you instead of his right now. It makes sense his instincts would make him jealous, and angry. It's not you, it's him and me. I don't mind you coming here, not at all, but Dean just has to get used to the idea, okay? So please don't cry."
"Hate you? Not possible, alpha Dean. I hate the circumstances, but not you. It will be very embarassing,  but if he does that, I will try not to disobey,  if only to keep the peace for now," he kissed Dean's cheek, "you should get to work now , alpha, or I might have to go to bed alone." He was teasing, but with all the work Dean had to do it could be possible.
Cas smiled, "Dean.. you saved me. Of course he'll approve." He nuzzled him gently, "don't worry so much."
Castiel nodded and paused before asking, "um... will Sam fit?" He had seen pictures of beetles, and he wasn't sure if Sam would fit comfortably in that particular vehicle.
He had gotten gifts of candy, or maybe even a flower on occasion from alphas who wanted to feel they were being kind. However, those gifts were very rare and somewhat expected. Clothing was not anything he expected to get, especially from an alpha. He had to thank Dean properly, the way he had always been told to thank an alpha when given a gift. He licked his lips nervously before turning to face Dean and kneeled to get on his knees in front of Dean. He started to reach for his belt, tugging the buckle apart.
Castiel smiled as he looked at the designs. He pointed to one and grinned, "I really like that one. It's elegant, without being to revealing."
Castiel giggled at the ticklish feeling before wiggling out of his mate's gentle hold. He rolled to the edge of the bed, his instincts wanting to play as well, and gently pushing Dean back on the bed he started to run, smiling and flushed. "Try and catch me alpha!" he called as he opened the door to go into the hall. Some servants were cleaning and smiled at the couple, happy to see Dean in a good mood again after last night. They needed more fun around the place.
Dean relaxed a little at the gentle nuzzles, and he gave a nod. "Could have been worse. I need to talk to you later, though," he took Castiel's hand and kissed his knuckles, inhaling his scent.
Castiel looked over his shoulder at Dean and asked, "will we always be here? With Sam and Alpha John?" He needed to know because he did not trust John one bit, and the thought of being caught alone with the alpha terrified him.
Dean grinned, turning back to Cas and his smile fading a little at his expression. "Hey, everything okay?"
He stiffened in frozen horror as John called the alpha over, calling the alpha "old friend". Castiel watched out of the corner of his eye as the alpha got closer and closer to the table. "I know him," Castiel said just loud enough for Dean to hear.
Charlie sighed, "He has no intention of letting Jack know his birth mother. He has said the birth mother was a whore and would only ruin Jack's life. I looked into any ways Castiel could get Jack, or least visitations, and it's near impossible."
Felix made a motion, "your brother's new omega. Or yours to share, if you want, I suppose. Mr Winchester senior instructed I purchase him. Your brother requested small with blue eyes." He looked over at Cas, who looked scared as hell and sighed. "I'll be running along then, please let me know if you need anything else," Felix bowed and headed off to the kitchen.
Cas had an urge to check his brother’s fingers for buzzers or glitter glue or something, but Dean shook the offered hand with no regard for personal safety, and after only a moment his own hand was returned to him, clean and undamaged. “And you’re the infamous Gabriel,” he said with a charming smile that almost concealed his natural shyness. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”
"Show me," Castiel breathed, completely mesmerized by the man above him. "Let me see you come, Dean." He fucked up into Dean a little harder to compensate for the other man's loss of muscle control.
"No." Dean shook his head and looked up at Castiel. "No, it feels good. Um…" He laughed self-consciously and looked back down at the rope bow. "It's kind of like the first time I tried on panties, you know? I thought it would look ridiculous, but it actually makes me feel kind of… pretty." He flopped back onto the pillows and put his hands over his face, knocking his glasses askew. Embarrassment soured his scent. "God, I am so screwed up."
"He was comforting me! And I already told Dean what really happened!" Castiel shouted from behind Sam.
Castiels eyes widened and he rushed down the hall. He didn't even think about what would happen to himself. He had to help Adam. As he got close to Adam's room he heard screams, "Dad! Stop, please!" There was a slap followed by a yell of pain as he was hit again.
Castiel closed his eyes for a moment before replying, "you were protecting us. You don't have to be sorry. You're a good alpha." He smiled and opened his eyes, gazing up at Dean. He hoped the alpha saw that Adam was no threat now.
"Cheeseburger with french fries sounds great, please." Dean requested, and Castiel perked up, "I'll have the same, and a third plate for Adam as well."
One of the omegas sighed and said, "Felix, we were just having a little fun. We even had Castiel helping with dinner."
Castiel whimpered loudly as Dean bobbed his head, groaning out Dean's name.  One hand gripped Dean's hair as the other yanked on the rumpled bedsheets, his hips rolling.
"So... you're pretty well off, right, Dean? I mean, son of a huge business owner, " Luke asked through a mouthful of food.
"Sure, Cas. Why don't you get us something to drink and fix the nest. I'm almost done, I'll meet you there," Dean helped Cas gently slide off his lap.
"I'm not sure, but I want to cuddle something small," He said softly, not sure of what to do, annoyed at his instincts. He looked around and that is when he saw a teddy bear, "can I use that?"
"Not yet, but we'll have a ceremony someday and he is going to mark me then. Right, Dean?" he asked softly.
Dean paused, because he really wasn't sure of the answer himself, "I'm first in line to take over the family business. Once my dad passes or steps down as head alpha it falls to me."
He purred a little as he walked toward the shop, knowing Dean would still be there. He was anxious to see Dean after a morning away from him, and he had a lot to tell him.
Dean bristled even more at his father's attitude, "I would have smelled the sex on castiel. I know what it smells like. Nothing happened. I believe them both. Now, again, get out of here and go sleep this off, or I'll have the beta police called like they should be."
Benny looked to Dean and asked, "so, are we going out still or are you spending the day with blue eyes here?" He smiled, knowing already what the answer would be.
Castiel nodded slowly. When the picture left the screen, he pulled his hand away. He whined softly, "I want my pup."
Dean showered quickly, kissed cas on his way out the door, giving him a long, lingering look. "I'll be back," he waved, and smiled when Cas waved back.
Another long dialogue full chapter but gives some insight into Castiel's personality. I PROMISE next week is siblings day! Enjoy.
Castiel looked up at Dean and then kissed his cheek. "I'm sorry. I know I didn't do anything, but I'm sorry you lost your mom and your dad changed into what he is now."
Charlie sighed and said, "Dean, before you, do you think he was given a choice in what he could eat? What he wanted to drink? Or if he even wanted pups? He was told what to do for whatever time he was in there. You guys gave him so much more than you know."
Castiel smiled and nodded as he followed her. Stopping only once when he saw the aisle with cereal. He couldn't believe there was so many kinds.
Once Castiel was done eating he set his plate on the coffee table and leaned into Dean to watch the movie. "Do you think Chewie is as tall as Sam?" He asked and Charlie just started to laugh at that.
"Um, when a well to do alpha mates an omega theres a big ceremony. A wedding type of thing, if you've heard of that for betas. The only difference is a public marking. The omega usually plans it all," Dean explained as simply as he could.
Castiel smiled, "I liked it. It could be fun doing this. And maybe once I figure out what I really want to do with it, it could be a way to reach others like me."
Castiel smiled brightly, "that is good news. While you talk with her I'll go shower." He hugged him before getting up and going to the bathroom.
"It's a sort of relaxed, calm feeling, and for the father or mother I'm sure it's a protective feeling as well," Dean replied, running a hand up and down Castiel's back.
Dean blinked at this information and then looked sad too. "I see. That must be difficult," he looked over at the brothers playing catch.
"Yeah, Cas. Hes adorable," Dean looked back at Sam, and kissed the side of Castiel's head, "looks like hes doing really well."
Castiel smiled and nodded, "really. Charlie has his number, would I be able to see him and my other siblings again, alpha? I want you to be there, and for them to meet you."
"Yeah, I'm sure Charlie wouldn't mind," Sam picked it up and handed it to him, "we can get you a bigger or smaller one too."
Castiel paused, "I just don't understand why you avoid Adam. If you would just spend time with him, or even if Sam did, you would see he's a good person."
Dean nuzzled back, rubbing his stubbled cheek against Castiel's, "the breeding house was a house of horrors and I plan to shut down as many as I can as soon as possible. Alphas that have to rape to have their own pup don't deserve them." Dean went to flip the hamburgers, still shaking a little.
Castiel pulled away to look at him, not sure he was serious, "He really wants me to be like that? If I do something he doesn't think is what a proper what would he do?"
Dean's knot was swelling rapidly, soon tugging on every pull out, and with one last slam into Castiel's body his knot swelled to full and he rocked his hips, lodging in deep.
Dean sat at a nearby table to eat, pressing a kiss to Castiel's lips and giving him a cheek rub to leave at least a little scent behind. "Theres actually something I have to tell you," he spoke up after they were both settled, "there's a benefit charity dinner coming up and my father, Sam and I are expected to attend. I'd like you to accompany me."
Castiel smiled and slid in carefully. The water was really nice, and he slowly started to walk around to get use to the feeling, gaining confidence to go towards the deeper end. When the water got to be chest deep he stopped and stayed back, not wanting to drown.
Adam put down his soda slowly, surprised. "Breeding house? Those things still exist? Fuckin' hell," he looked at him for a second, "are you doing okay? Those things are supposed to be horror houses. This must be a hell of a change." He paused, "Dean resents me a little bit, because I was born from an affair his dad had. But, he's a great man, and an equally great alpha. You can't get better alphas than my half brothers."
Castiel looked at him, no less confused. He wasn't sure if this was a test or not. He had a choice? He never had one before, as his life had been planned for him until recently. He wasn't sure what path would be the right one to choose.
Castiel was so happy. He made sure that he put his pills where he would see them every day and went right to work on making his nest again. The room he and Dean had now was much bigger as it had been Johns, but his scent was gone since the maids made sure to use a scent neutralizer. He was purring as he made the nest and when Dean came in he hugged and kissed him. "I love you so much Dean. In a few days will be my heat, and after that could we have Jack over?" he asked, still so excited about everything.
"Won't you get in trouble for what you said to him?" Castiel asked as they got out of hearing range of Felix. He didn't understand why the beta was so rough on him. He had just met him and was already treating Castiel like he was only bringing trouble.
Dean smiled when he came back and saw Cas had been nesting, climbing up beside him in the bundle of soft materials and pulling Cas close. He kissed behind his ear and inhaled his scent with a soft sigh. This is just what he needed after such a night.
Dean kissed his head, "you're welcome. When I was a pup my mom and I would help in the kitchens. I know how to make simple things." He looked thoughtful at the idea of vlogging, "just be sure to be safe and not give away your location, okay?"
Castiel bit his lip anxiously, "I just hope I can act like Dean said I should for the charity dinner." He smiled a little and said, "but at least I will be able to wear a dress that I wanted. Dean made sure of that."
"An Mma alpha fighter?" Dean's instincts were already on alert. His inner alpha was telling him if Lucifer ended up not liking him hed have to fight for Castiel's affections. Silly, primeval thinking but something he couldn't help.
The months passed quickly and soon it was time for the ceremony. Charlie helped Castiel pick a beautiful beach where they could do the ceremony, and now he was in the dress he'd so happily picked out. It was off white, light and had just a little sparkle to it. It wasn't see through, but very beautiful and fit him just right. The stylist and makeup artist did his hair and make up and soon he stood next to the blinds, peeking out. Dean had not seen him in two full days, and in a few minutes he would be walking down the aisle. Sam stood next to Dean at the altar. John was there, in the front row, and was told to behave or he would be made to leave. Adam sat a few seats away from John. On Castiel's side were all his brothers and his sister, Charlie, and little Jack, who was in a little tuxedo.
Dean twitched as he heard a clatter and a curse,  a servant knocking lightly, "I apologize, alpha, i dropped the breakfast plates. I'm going to clean up and fetch new ones."
Castiel nodded at what Dean said and did as he was told. He saw the other omegas, and wondered if they felt like he did about this. Then when he saw alphas with two omegas he almost broke his role. He did whine at the sight, but looked away from it quickly.
"I'll stay. Dean isn't awake yet and just in case Cas needs someone..." Sam trailed off, "I'm glad he's finally getting control of his own body."
Castiel tensed a little when he heard a soft chuckle behind them, "there you are, brotha. I came to see if you still wanted to go out. I see you're busy." Castiel cringed away from the other alpha, unsure of who he was and why he was here. Dean rubbed his back, trying to soothe him. "Hey, Benny. This is Castiel, he's the companion omega my father was talking so much about."
Dean hummed, turning his head to kiss Castiel's lips, "yes, you did. You're always the smart one." He gave him a cheek nuzzle and took the finished burgers off the grill, placing the next batch on.
The MC announced it was time for the first dance of the new couple, and Castiel gave Jack to Gabriel, know Gabe would let him have some cake. He walked out to the dance floor with Dean and smiled up at him as they waited for the music. "How do you like everything?" he asked.
Dean shook his head, "I've had many, many invitations, but I've never actually been. My mom would have killed me for even the thought, if she were alive."
Castiel smiled and nodded as he sat next to his mate and filled his plate. Sam said he should eat up now because during his heat he wouldn't want much and he knew Sam was right.
His arms gave out as he fell forwards onto his elbows. "Oh... Alpha Dean," he purred softly, now very certain that Dean was not like other alphas, mind going blank from pleasure.
Dean gently gripped castiel, not wanting to hurt him in his hormone fueled state. He buried his nose in Castiel's neck, taking deep breaths. "I'm sorry," he took one more deep breath, his eyes melting back to green and his lips pressing a kiss to Castiel's skin.
Dean hummed happily, relaxing under the tender touches of his omega. "I think you're exaggerating," he sounded pleased though, opening his eyes to look at Cas, red irises still slowly fading back to green.
Luke grumbled good naturedly. "Force of habit, sorry. It's my literal job," he hugged Cas back softly. "Does this happen often?" He looked at Cas, rubbing his back.
"Hm? Oh, it's called Law and Order. You're welcome to sit further up on the bed if you want." Dean patted the space next to him where he was leaning against the headboard.
After a bit Castiel dozed off and Charlie smiled, "he had a busy day. I'm surprised he made it this long."
Castiel nodded and said, "I'm okay," then not seeing Charlie called out, "Charlie!" Hearing her name Charlie looked up, and seeing some strange man near Castiel she abandoned her cart and rushed to Castiel, and moved between him and Gabriel, pulling out the can of mace. "Back up or I'll fucking blind you!" she snarled, not about to let her friend get hurt.
"I can beat my dad in a fight. But I'd rather it not come to that. If it does and I have to I won't hesitate, but..." Dean trailed off, thinking about his mother.
Dean remained quiet. Cas was going to be the happiest omega alive, and of course that made Dean happy, but now why would Cas need to have pups with Dean?
Dean brushed fingers over Castiel's cheek, sighing softly. He cuddled Cas, careful of the "pup" between them, pressing soft kisses up his neck.
"I was told you bought me, sir?" He asked head bowed lowly, as he had been trained to do when talking to anyone that did not live in the breeding house.
Dean finally was satisfied with his work and pulled back to look at him, cupping his cheek and looking into blue eyes, "be safe. I love you."
Dean pressed kisses down his jaw and to his lips, kissing him for several long moments before pulling back to let them both breathe, rolling them so Cas was on top and Dean wouldn't squish him.
Mating bite? Castiel tensed as he felt Dean's fangs touch his skin. He had heard how horribly painful a mating bite could be, and he though he really liked Dean, he didn't want that, not yet anyway, "later alpha, when everything has calmed down some. Okay?"
Castiel looked puzzled, "because he fights for a living?" He really didn't understand. To him, the fighting meant his brother could defend anyone he took as a mate, but he wasn't an alpha so it would be different for alphas.
"I want to, please, Dean," Cas said with a shy smile, and he started to tug at Dean's pants. He needed them off, needed to touch his alpha.
Castiel knew by Johns scent that he would eventually want his body, and it scared him. He knew his type of alpha all too well and knew the consequences of disobeying. He kept looking down, trembling, everything he had been taught said to stay there, terrified or not.
Dean hesitated, looking at Cas and biting his lip in concern. "Are you sure you two will be safe?" he asked Charlie, looking over at her.
Anna sighed, "I can see why he would think that, he and Michael got into a fight the day before mom and dad took him away. Now, we all have learned the truth. I have no idea how Cassie managed to live through having 5 pups taken away."
Castiel nodded and said, "Okay." He sighed, a little anxious now, and went to make a nest for him and Dean to sleep in tonight.
Anna glared at Michael, "Michael, maybe Castiel doesn't want pups right now. It's his choice too." She put an arm around her brother and Castiel leaned against her, but his eyes went to Dean, watching him.
Castiel looked up and smiled some at what Sam said. A clumsy alpha? That was a new one to him. Dean...was that who he belonged to now?  "Would it be okay if I asked some questions?" Castiel asked, a bit worried that Sam was only being nice so Castiel would let his guard down. He'd been fooled that way before.
Charlie smiled and stood, "Sure. I'll show you how to start a video." They got up and Charlie took him to the living room where the lighting was better, and Castiel started his first vlog. He started it by saying his hellos and explaining who he was, then what he hoped to do with this vlog. He talked about himself a little before asking if they had anything they would like to know about him. He did an outro, hoping to talk to everyone again soon. Charlie smiled and spoke, "That was a great first vlog Cas. Want to post it?" Castiel nodded and so Charlie did on his account.
Castiel laid his head down, not sure what to say or think about this. He wanted to be near Dean more than anything, but not John, and not Felix.
Castiel blinked, "Dean, I changed my mind as I got to know you. I had a reason to live. You, Sam and Adam and Charlie, you all gave me a reason to stay alive." He put his arms around him in return.
"I was the only omega at the time and I have three older brothers, and a little sister. Gabriel, Michael, and Luke are my brothers and Anna is my sister.  Michael and Luke are alphas like Gabriel and Anna presented as a beta,  I thought they knew where so was and didn't care. So I never asked to find them." He nuzzled Dean and smiled against his neck, "Gabriel is happy I found you Dean. I told him all about you."
Dean smiled against his skin, hand running up and down Castiel's side, not trying to start anything, just needing to touch. He watched him more than the show, enjoying the smile on the omega's face. What was important was Castiel was safe, unharmed, and in his arms. He didnt need anything else.
"This all looks in order. How quickly do you want this implemented?" Dean asked, knowing the sooner the better for the company's sake.
Charlie nodded, "Yep and he's a champion one too." She pulled up a video of Lucifer in a cage match.
Dean scented Cas before he saw him and was frowning when Cas came into view.  "You reek like Adam," his expression was stormy as he studied Castiel up and down, arms crossed, "please, explain."
Castiel panted, his body tensed up and more slick trickled from his hole. Unable to hold back any longer, Castiel moaned out Dean's name as he came, spurting onto the blanket under him and into Dean's fingers.
He was so terrified that he was covering his head, and kept saying, "I'm sorry!" over and over. He was so in his own head he didn't realise he had backed into a corner. His eyes closed as he didn't want to see this alpha angry, waiting for the first blow.
"I say punishments because that's what dad used to do. That'll be the first thing to stop," Dean said firmly.
A couple of hours later there was a knock on the door and cheerful voice rang through, "is there a Castiel here? I'm Charlie, Dean said you'd be expecting me."
For a while they went through her long list of items, there were several things Castiel really wasn't sure about, but they could get back to later. Castiel really did like Charlie and when she had to go he walked to the door with her, sad to see her leaving, "it's been fun getting to know you, Charlie. I can't wait to see you again."
Dean was close, but not in his space close and he relaxed somewhat, relieved it didnt appear Dean was going to do anything right now at least.
While Dean was with John, Castiel figured out how to turn on the tv. He found a cute little show about puppies on animal planet, and he smiled as he settled in to watch, wondering if Dean would ever allow him to have a puppy.
Castiel kissed back eagerly, his purring fading as he gave a soft groan, moving to straddle Dean's lap. "Alpha Dean, your scent..." he moaned out as he moved his lips to Dean's neck, taking a deep inhale. His body responded to this new postion, gently grinding his erection against Dean's own arousal.
"Kick ass," Dean laughed softly, "she was beautiful, smart, and strong. Raised us to respect everyone, especially omegas. She stood up for herself and knew what she wanted."
Ms. Mills next words popped his bubble of unexpected happiness. "Mr. Novak, while I have you here, there are a couple other issues I've been meaning to talk to you about. Claire's grades are not what they should be. At her old school she was a straight A student. Here she's averaging Bs and Cs."
“At work. We did an oil change for him, and when he came to get his car, I was working the desk cause Bobby was out with the tow truck, and Ash was helping Andy with a custom paint job, and … Well, you know I’m not the most focused person at the best of times, and suddenly there’s this gorgeous man standing in front of me. I got so distracted I almost forgot to get his payment.
Castiel stared at Dean open mouthed. No part of him thought that Dean would joke about something like this, but it was so unexpected that his brain needed a minute to make the right shaped space to fit the information into. Finally he said, "Okay."
"Somehow that doesn't surprise me. You're devastatingly handsome, you like kids, and you can cook. You're every single mother's dream guy."
Dean's eyes flickered down to Castiel's lips. "Yeah, I think maybe we could." But when Castiel started to lean forward, Dean stepped back. "At the door," he said. "Just in case."
“Dean.” Cas muted the TV, and Dean finally turned to look at him. The wariness in those beautiful green eyes broke Cas’s heart. The phrase “kicked puppy” sprang to mind. “Dean, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.”
It wasn't a question, but Dean shook his head anyway. "I was always kind of curious about it, but I felt silly trying it by myself, and I never had anyone I…"
"And at work I have to be professional, and at home I have to keep it together for Claire's sake, and by the time I have a minute to myself I'm too tired to do anything but sleep. I'm just so tired all the time." The words poured out just like the tears, raw and uncontrollable.
Dean walked back around the bed and laid down behind Cas, pressing up against him so that Cas was sandwiched between Dean and Grace. “I don’t scare that easy,” he said.
“Cassie,” Gabe countered, deadpan, then immediately switched to a pleading tone. “Come on. Let me live vicariously. My sex life is nonexistent at the moment.”
Cas looked like he wanted to ask Dean to stay a little longer, but all he said was, "Okay. Good night, Dean."
The man smiled shyly and disappeared into another room, the kitchen presumably. Castiel heard him moving around and was debating whether he should follow and offer his assistance (not to trick a wish out of the man, just to be a polite house guest) when his master (host?) poked his head back around the door and said, "By the way, do you have a name? Other than genie?"
She blushed and hid behind Dean again. Although it hurt Castiel's heart seeing her so timid and frightened, the trust she had in Dean to protect her warmed him inside.
Castiel picked his way around the fort carefully and gently shook Missouri's shoulder, whispering her name. She opened her eyes, squinting against the light of the bedside lamp. "You're back already? What time is it?"
Dean's cock throbbed as it tried to get even harder, a physical impossibility at this point. He quickly shucked his boxers and covered his fingers in a generous amount of lube. Cas obligingly spread his legs wide, and Dean knew that he would never need to watch porn again. He could just close his eyes and picture
The staff washroom was a fairly well insulated single occupancy room in the back of the building, so as soon as Castiel flipped the lock, they had total privacy. He pushed Dean against the door and kissed him, hard and hungry, while fumbling blindly with the other man's belt. Dean's mouth tasted like buttery pastry and rosemary, the very same rosemary he had given Castiel instead of flowers on their first date.
"Yes," Castiel agreed. His brain wasn't as overloaded with information as he'd expected from learning a new language, and the movements had started to feel more natural towards the end. "What did you think, Claire? Do you like this way of talking?"
Castiel turned on his heel and started back upstairs, tugging Dean along behind him. Back in their room, he closed the door and locked it before finally letting go of Dean's hand. The sight of the debauched bed with its sheets and blankets twisted every which way stained with slick and come, and the rope lying in the center, still tied in a bow, made Castiel desperately wish that he could turn back time, be warm and safe and tangled up with Dean again behind this locked door. He hadn't gotten to come, but he doubted either of them could get back in the mood now.
"Did you have a good Christmas?" Castiel asked as he tucked a clean, pajama-clad little alpha into bed.
Part of him did want to, but ever since he was a child he'd had this vague superstition that putting nightmares into words made them more real, gave them the power to reach into the waking world and hurt him. He knew it wasn't rational or healthy, but he couldn't get past it. So instead of answering, he kissed Dean.
Castiel's heart seemed to grow a size as it filled with love and gratitude. Dean not only understood how important his son was to him, but he was willing to postpone discussion of other aspects of their relationship — aspects that most alphas would deem far more important — to set Castiel's mind at ease about this. "Alright," he said with a soft smile. "Let's start there. How involved do you want to be in his upbringing? Assuming I get custody."
That got Cas’s attention. “Shit,” he said. “I’m late.” As he started to get up, Dean finally saw his face. His eyes were red and swollen, and his cheeks were stained with dried tears.
Cas nodded approvingly. He wondered why that hadn't occurred to him. Bite the guy's dick as soon as it was in his mouth.
"Dean." Castiel wanted to reach out and take his hand, but Dean looked as tense and wary as a wild animal. "Just take a deep breath and tell me before I start imagining worst case scenarios."
"Oh." Castiel did his best to keep the sinking disappointment out of his scent, but he clearly failed dismally because Dean immediately reached out to gather him up, the list falling forgotten between the sofa cushions.
"Oh, I think it does. Obviously I can't stop you from mating this pathetic excuse for an alpha." Michael didn't even deign to look at Dean as he said this. "But I will not allow you to expose my son to such perversion."
“I understand, Dean,” Cas said without hesitation. “There’s no rush. And like I said, if I do anything you’re not comfortable with, tell me and I’ll stop immediately. Okay?”
"You gave Cas a key?" Sam wasn't uncomfortable with the idea, just surprised. Clearly the relationship was out of the getting-to-know-each-other stage and moving deeper into long term commitment territory by the day. He hoped that was a good thing and not a sign that Dean was letting his impulsive nature get the better of him.
"It's not. I told you, Dean. I want to meet your family, and a small, informal gathering like this seems like the perfect oppor—"
“Yeah, definitely, but … Look, don’t take this the wrong way, but I kind of want to take things slow. Cause I usually don’t. I’m very impulsive, and I … I really like you, and I don’t want to screw this up.”
"You too," Sam said with a grin. "I haven't seen you in a suit since … well, ever actually. What did Cas think?"
If you're expecting Dean to say the big L word in this chapter, you clearly don't know him very well. Be patient with him. He'll get there.
"I think we should give you two a minute to figure this out in private," Eileen said after a moment of horribly awkward silence, and she practically dragged Sam out of his own office, the door clicking closed behind them. Dean
"But you didn't. I have been inexcusably rude to your friend." Cas closed his eyes and leaned his head into Dean's palm a little harder. "It's so confusing, Dean. My body says one thing, my mind says another, and I have no idea which one is really me."
, however temporarily, a larger part of him understood that the fewer people who knew about their lie, the less complicated it would be when they stopped pretending. He quickly dragged his eyes back to Cas' face, hoping the omega hadn't noticed his preoccupation with the fake bite.
With the medicine kicking in and his stomach full of food, Castiel was ready to go back to sleep for a while, but Dean had other ideas. And not the fun kind either. "Cas, we need to talk," he said.
"She's probably told Michael by now," Cas said, looking at the door like it led to the gallows. He looked at Dean again, and there was panic in his eyes, the panic of a cornered animal. "Will you come with me? I don't… I don't think I can face them alone."
pheromones as it finally sensed a willing alpha nearby. Cas's hips rolled and jerked mindlessly against the mattress, but that wasn't going to do anything for the crippling cramps that Dean knew must be like knives tearing at his insides. Dean had never helped an omega through heat before, but he knew the basics. Only knotting could take away the pain entirely although other kinds of stimulation could take the edge off for a few minutes at a time.
Once they were naked, Dean dropped to his knees and swallowed Castiel down, getting him good and wet. Castiel had to close his eyes lest the sight of those plump, pink lips wrapped around his cock send him over the edge embarrassingly fast. "Jesus Christ, Dean," he moaned, "your fucking mouth."
Castiel thought about how much it would hurt to see Dean, watch him play with Claire and make her laugh, but know that Dean wasn't his anymore. Then he thought about telling Claire that Dean was gone and never coming back. "Yes. If we had to. But I really don't want to have to."
be unhappy, or he'll say no but he'll feel bad for saying no. Either way, I'm not putting him in that position."
No, he had imagined that a claiming bite from Dean would be followed by a mating bite from Dean, and that both would be because the alpha had fallen as deeply in love with him as he had with Dean.
Well, best to just get it over with quickly, and then Dean could leave, and Castiel could go to sleep in his lonely bed, and tomorrow he would start working on piecing his heart back together.
"I'll give you a nasal spray that will dull your scent receptors, and you'll wear a scent blocking mask for extra protection. As long as you don't stay too long or take off the mask, you'll be fine."
“He’s getting married.” More than a year into the engagement, and Dean still couldn’t say it without grinning like an idiot. “On the Fourth of July actually. The reception’s gonna be a barbecue in our foster parents’ backyard. They’re on kind of a tight budget.” He took a breath and added as casually as he could, “I have a plus one if you, um … if you want to come with me. They’ve all been bugging me about when they’re gonna get to meet you.”
"An altercation? You mean a fight? Claire was fighting?" He probably should have been expecting that. It had certainly been his go to coping mechanism after his mother died, until he discovered other even more self destructive but less obvious outlets for all the pent up rage and helplessness. He unconsciously rubbed his palm against his thigh where his jeans concealed the scars.
“You didn’t,” Dean said a little too quickly. “I get it, Cas, and I don’t want to push you into anything you’re not ready for.” He was lying about not being hurt, but the rest of it was genuine.
Cas climbed into the bed with Dean and spread himself out on top of the alpha. Just that little bit of friction against Cas' stomach was almost enough to make Dean come. He moaned and spread his legs for Cas to settle more comfortably between them. Yes, that felt right. He wanted Cas to fuck him from the other end too, but he was still just lucid enough to know that he wouldn't last through the required prep.
"Claire," he said, speaking to the top of her head since she was still snuggled up to him. "I know we haven't really talked about your dad since the funeral, and I'm sorry for that. I miss him a lot too, and sometimes … Sometimes it hurts to even think about him. But I don't want you to forget him, and I … I don't want to forget him either. So I'm going to leave this book right here," — he pointed to the coffee table — "and you can look at it whenever you want. And if you want me to look at it with you and tell you about him and your mom, I will. Whenever you want. Okay?"
Sam's second present for Dean was a key chain in the shape of a '67 Impala. He showed Dean how the hood opened up to reveal a perfect replica of the engine, and Dean was finally able to muster up a smile. He put it on his key ring while Sam opened his present and John stared at the TV again.
“He told me some stuff about himself. Stuff you don’t tell someone you’re not serious about. And I wanted him to know that I was serious too, and that I got it, you know? That my life wasn’t perfect either.”
The sound of the front door opening and closing came from downstairs, and then a male voice called, "Dean?"
Castiel breathed through his nose, relaxed his throat, and went as deep as he could. God, it had been way too long since he'd done this. He'd forgotten how much he liked it. Dean liked it too judging by the litany of "fuck" and "Cas" and "so good" coming from above Castiel's head. He looked up through his lashes, but Dean wasn't watching him. His head was tipped back into the mattress, the thick column of his throat working furiously as he gasped for air, his hands fisting the blankets under him, completely lost in the pleasure Castiel was giving him.
And once again I cannot thank EyumdaRelmera enough for all her help, advice (both taken and ignored), and emotional support. I promise to protect you from the pitchfork wielding minions, hon.
"Hey, hey, hey. No. Don't do that to yourself. You are not weak. Fear does weird things to your brain. I've seen big tough guys curl up in a ball and cry for their mothers when shit got real. It is nothing to be ashamed of."
The man blushed deep crimson this time and rubbed the back of his neck. "Yeah, not uh … not really my style." He met Castiel's eyes, and for a moment he looked sad. "You can't bring back the dead?" he asked quietly.
When they had done their final cleanup and everyone was putting on their coats and wishing each other good night, Dean handed Castiel a piece of paper with a name and a phone number.
Dean's tongue darted out to lick a flake of pastry from his lower lip, and Castiel was viscerally reminded of the way that tongue had licked up Castiel's come with equal enjoyment earlier that morning. God, what he wouldn't give to be sitting in Dean's lap right now, feeding him pie and kissing him between each bite.
"Oh, the basic dirty tricks," Dean said, a grin breaking over his face like a sunrise. "Knee to the crotch, finger in the eye socket, and if all else fails, bite them."
When he came back from tucking Claire in, he found Dean in the kitchen adding a generous dollop of honey to a steaming cup of tea. The scents of chamomile and lavender hung in the air. He didn't have to ask who it was for. Dean derisively referred to tea as 'hippie leaf water', but when he found out that Castiel often enjoyed a cup in the evenings before bed, he had interrogated the young woman whose family shop supplied the restaurant, pestering her with questions about different blends and the advantages of loose leaf versus bags until she broke down and gave him a crash course.
"You okay?" the voice asked again. It came from the plushest, most perfect lips Cas had ever seen on a man. And below the lips was a strong jaw with a light layer of reddish gold stubble, and then a long, muscular neck with a few tattoos of twining rose vines climbing above the man's t-shirt. The man wasn't just good looking. He was gorgeous. He was sex personified. He was … giving Cas a worried look because Cas still hadn't answered his question.
Castiel shivered slightly, and without conscious impulse, found himself leaning back against Dean, melting in his alpha's arms.
"We are equal partners, Michael!" Castiel snapped, not caring even a little about his brother's antiquated 'omegas should only speak when spoken to' rule. "We will care for our children
Cas was true to his word. Dean felt no pain, only a slightly uncomfortable stretch which he immediately forgot when Cas’s fingertip skated over his prostate. He moaned shamelessly, his head tipping back into the pillows and his back arching off the bed. He’d almost forgotten how good that could feel.
"Will you stay?" Cas whispered, laying his head on Dean's chest right over his heart. "Will you be here when I wake up?" There was something almost childish in the question, as though he was afraid that Dean was a dream and would cease to exist come the daylight.
"… daughter was in the car too, but she was lucky. Only scrapes and bruises. The hospital wants to keep her overnight just to be sure."
“Yep. You’re good to go.” He found the right key on the row of hooks behind the desk and handed it over, enjoying the brief brush of warm fingers against his. Hard, smooth callouses indicated that Mr. Novak worked with those hands. There was dirt under his nails too, and even in the dim, windowless office Dean could see that the man’s skin was beautifully tanned. Outdoor work then, in the hot sun, sweaty and possibly shirtless …
Finally, after what felt like an eternity and also not nearly long enough, Cas came, his untouched cock spurting over his belly, and his ass clenching even tighter around Dean, forcing out a gush of sweet smelling slick that trickled over Dean's balls and soaked into the already filthy sheets.
"Yes. There's no one I trust more. I know you'd love and protect her like she was your own because you already do."
There was a double picture frame on the nightstand. One side held a picture that Dean had taken of Cas in the hospital, looking exhausted but happy, cradling newborn Jack to his chest. The infant's hair was still damp and plastered flat to his tiny skull from squeezing his way out of his father. The other side of the frame showed a chubby five-year-old laying in a pile of fallen leaves in the townhouse's backyard. Cas had taken the picture with his phone on Jack's last visit, and even though it was a little blurry because Cas was a terrible photographer, Jack looked happier than he ever did in the pictures Hannah occasionally emailed to Cas.
Dean obligingly flipped onto his back and opened his legs for Castiel to kneel between them. Even though this wasn't a scene, there was still something intoxicating about Dean's easy cooperation, his perfect, unquestioning trust. It made Castiel want to cover the alpha in kisses, worship every inch of his body, and beg for the right to spend the rest of his life making Dean feel safe and loved.
"Yeah. Maybe." Castiel rubbed a hand over his face. "I'm scared, Dean," he admitted in a small voice. "This is how it started with me."
While they built their snowman, they compared notes on their favorite princess movies with Cas chiming in occasionally though he was far less of a Disney fan than Dean and Jack. When the snowman was complete, they had a snowball fight, Dean and Jack against Cas, which might have seemed unfair if Cas hadn't been such a deadly shot. Of course he targeted Dean more than Jack (although he was careful not to hit Dean in the face and risk damaging his glasses), and by the time Hannah came to the door to tell them there was hot cocoa and grilled cheese sandwiches waiting, Dean was thoroughly soaked and getting cold. It was strangely exhilarating. He couldn't remember the last time he had played in the snow like this, although he figured it was probably back when he and Sammy were kids.
“I close the store at two on Saturdays, and I live right next door, so if you meet me there at two thirty, that’ll give me enough time to change my clothes and pack us some food. I’m not much of a cook, but I can do sandwiches.”
He smiled. "I haven't believed in God for a very long time, but I take your meaning, and I'll try to remember."
Jack looked around at the action figures and Legos and the bike. "I guess," he said without much enthusiasm. "Can't we go build a snowman now?"
It was a great plan in theory, but Dean hadn't accounted for one thing. He had gotten used to sleeping with Cas, not just euphemistically but literally as well. He tossed and turned on his memory foam mattress, missing the extra warmth of another body in the bed with him and the scent of a contented omega. He breathed in the fresh laundry smell of his sheets, usually so comforting because it was so different from the way motel sheets smelled, a reminder that he had a home now and a bed of his own, but right now it just smelled sterile and lonely.
Castiel was quiet a moment before asking in a shaky voice, "did last night mean anything to you?" His voice sounded almost empty, and Dean could see his eyes and face were red from crying.
He looked up at Dean smiling kindly at him and knew he wanted to do something to thank Dean, but other than sex he had no idea what to offer. His life for the past five years was nothing except to be knotted and have pups.
Sam smiled and said, "I'll help you, Dean." He got up off the couch to go help, ruffling Castiel's hair on the way.
Dean smothered a laugh as he watched Sam fold up to fit in the backseat, having to scoot Castiel's chair all the way forward.
John nodded, "that is correct. The mansion is yours to do with as you want. That includes Adam. He can stay or be thrown out if you want."
Luke took a slow breath, eyes slowly fading back to their normal color. "Sorry, Cassie. I got carried away," he looked him up and down, "they didnt hurt you, did they?"
Dean looked at the siblings playing together and he smiled, "yeah, I can see that. Castiel had mentioned family but not specifics. I think he felt no one cared."
"He is, sir. But, I need to report on the omega you bought for him," he replied lightly as he was determined to see that Castiel was punished in some form. He told John what he had seen and how Sam had been having Castiel watch videos of proper omega etiquette. "Sam explained that if you or Dean were to tell the omega to present in front of the party, he was to do so. The omega then started to yell and bring up that breeding house, saying that even there they had rooms for that. The brothers have not been training him as you wanted."
Gabriel laughed, "never did. Although Michael and Luke are basically body builders now." He plucked some sugary cereal off the shelf, "do you, uh...want me to tell them I saw you?"
"Stepping down as CEO," Dean replied quietly, putting the fruit in a ziplock and into the fridge, "he'll probably offer it to you, out of spite."
Castiel nodded and said, "It is, but his mate is thankfully okay with it and they are looking into adoption."
Castiel smiled and nodded. "Okay. Are my pajamas alright for the tailor?" he asked softly as he sat down on the bed and looked back to the tv.
Sam sighed softly before saying, "I'm sure you do. But, that would be difficult. Even if we were on good terms, as an alpha, he has more rights over Jack."
Lucifer stared at him, putting the chips on the table and scooping Cas into a crushing tight hug. "Fuck,  Castiel, oh my God. We missed you so much. We didn't know, we would have come looking."
Castiel chuckled softly, "I'll remember that come winter." He hugged him and then got them some towles. "Lets go, alpha," he took Dean's hand as they walked out of the room and down the hall.
Dean leaned down to kiss him, his hand running down Castiel's side and grasping his cock, stroking it as he pounded in.
Castiel listened to the Sam and looked at the door a moment longer before turning to go back to Dean. "I wanted to get some air, but Sam was telling me it wasn't safe out there for me right now," he finally said as he climbed into bed and cuddled up to Dean.
"Can it wait until Dean gets here? He's running a little late tonight." Anna had always been included in menu meetings, and at least half the suggested new items were Dean's ideas.
She held up her hands, conceding the decision to him. "Very well. If you think it's necessary. Gabe, you'll draw up a list of who will wait on the private party and have it on my desk by Tuesday night."
"I love that about you too," he continued since Dean was obviously getting off on the dirty talk just as much as everything else. "I love that you're a big, strong man who can pick me up like this. I love your big, calloused hands. I love that you can fuck me into the mattress when I need that, and even when you bottom for me, there is absolutely nothing feminine about you. Watching you come all over my chest while you ride my cock is the hottest, most masculine thing I've ever seen in my life."
Castiel was becoming more fluent in Dean Winchester every day, and he knew that what he was really saying was,
Even though he couldn't see Dean's face, he could feel the other man smirking as he threw Cas's own words back at him, and somehow that broke through his nerves. "I want you inside me," he said hoarsely. "Make love to me, Dean. Please?"
: Dean meets the fam. How do you think it'll go? Will Michael buy it? Will he approve of Dean? Will Dean and Cas ever get their heads out of their asses? Well, of course they will because this is
Dean laughed, but it wasn't a happy sound. "Oh, trust me, it doesn't get much worse than this. My brother … He's in prison, Cas. For murder. And before you ask, no, he wasn't falsely convicted. He did it."
He would have laughed except Dean punctuated the last word with a roll of his hips and a hard clench, and all he could do was moan, "Dean."
Dean put a sandwich and a cup of coffee in front of Cas and took away the tablet. “No. Eat,” he ordered when Cas started to protest. “This stuff can wait twenty minutes. You haven’t eaten since yesterday.”
horny. This was the longest he'd gone without sex since he and Dean started sleeping together, and his body had gotten used to at least one orgasm a day. More on quiet afternoons like this. Jerking off wouldn't be anywhere near as satisfying as having Dean's big, calloused hands on him, but it might take the edge off enough to let him get some work done.
Ben's eyes widened at the dire threat, and he hastily swallowed what was in his mouth before Dean could also make him spit it out into the garbage.
Castiel was speechless. "That's not… I… I don't…" Her accusation stung all the more because he had always thought of Hannah as his ally in all this.
"Oh! Oh God, you were right," Castiel gasped. "Laughing during sex is the most amazing thing ever. Do that again."
Castiel sighed with equal parts relief and exasperation and finally reached out to touch Dean's cheek. "I know that, alpha. I'm here because I want to be. Because I love you and I want to help you like you helped me. And frankly, because you smell so irresistible right now that I might lose my mind if you don't fuck me soon."
Then, just as Cas was bracing himself for the inevitable interrogation, the conversation turned smoothly to what movies they were going to watch. This was apparently a delicate negotiation, and there were strict rules in place to prevent bloodshed. Everyone present (except Grace of course) got one nomination and one veto, but a movie was only rejected if it was vetoed by two or more participants. If a movie was vetoed, the person who nominated it got to pick a different one. When everyone had one of their choices in the final running, they rolled dice to determine which movie they would watch first. High roll won. When all the chosen movies had been watched, the process was repeated until a) they ran out of movies they could agree on, or b) they all fell asleep. The second one happened more often, Dean said.
"Great. I'm Dean. Come on in the kitchen. Tea's almost ready. You hungry? I'm not much of a cook, but I think I've got some hummus in the fridge, and I know there are crackers around here somewhere."
There was a cleverly concealed slit in the front that Castiel could pull Dean's cock through without having to take the panties off. Castiel was seriously considering tracking down the designer and sending them a thank you card, and perhaps a nice fruit basket. Dean's head hit the door with a thunk as Castiel swallowed him down to the root, the tip of his nose brushing lace. "Fuck, fuck, fuck, Cas, fuck, Cas." Those seemed to be the only two words in Dean's vocabulary at the moment.
Dean shut the hood of the car hed been working on with a loud slam, turning to look at the omega, "it's a long story I don't really want to get into right now. I just keep my distance from Adam. He's safe enough, so you can be around him if you want, but I'd prefer you spend more time with me. You were gone all morning." He set his tools aside and sighed, "let's go get some lunch."
Charlie grinned, "heck yeah you can. Put it in the cart. I love pineapple." She kept going, "why don't you pick out one dessert while I get the veggies?"
Charlie smiled and said, "Don't mention it. After what I saw on the news, I knew I had to help, even if nothing happened. You guys always have me in your corner." She kept driving, taking a left turn, "after I drop you guys off would you like anything for breakfast?"
"Be there for him. You two can only do this as a team." Sam slowly slid from bed and shut the door in front of Castiel, "we'll be okay."
"No. You won't be in there long. Come with me." Dean took his hand gently and lead him out along the halls. They walked quite a ways to the other side of the mansion to a large set of wooden double doors. "This is my father's office. Call if you need me. I'll be right here."
Castiel listened, and nodded along. It wasnt like he was used to having a choice in any part of his life anyway. He digested this a moment before shaking his head and said, "No questions. I understand, alpha Dean." He slowly found the courage to look up again.
The music started and Castiel started down the aisle, looking at Dean and smiling shyly. His mate, the alpha that saved his life, was going to mark him as his mate.
That weekend Castiel was practically bouncing with excitement as Charlie loaned them her car. "Oh Dean.. I'm excited. I get to see my brothers and sister again," he grinned as he got his seat belt on.
Castiel smiled and nodded as he took the alpha's hand, "Yes, please, alpha Dean." He was excited and nervous as Dean lead him down a dirt path to the stables. The barn was full of the smell of horses and fresh hay, a very soothing combination that made Cas take an extra deep breath. A soft purr came from him, escaping his chest in a soft airy rumble.
"Last night was wonderful. I thought you weren't like other alphas, like you actually cared and understood. Then today, I meet Adam, and you act like I slept with him. You think that I want him as a lover when I don't. I was forced to take knots for five years, alpha. Last night was the first time I've ever wanted it. Last night felt like everything to me."
"Twenty years old, alpha," he answered softly before slowly scooting a few steps towards Dean. He'd felt at least a little bit safer with him than with this alpha. He tensed when he felt a large hand suddenly at his side.
He had spent 5 years of his life not getting a choice of what to do in anything, not the way he dressed, who he spent time with, even what he ate. He slowly looked up at Dean and asked, "what do you think I should do, alpha?"
"Every one of us, Cassie," Gabriel said quietly, walking alongside them and occasionally adding things to his cart too, mostly sweet things.
Castiel stood by the bed, staring a moment. He wanted to cuddle Dean, but he wanted his pup to snuggle up to as well. He didn't know what to do. He didn't want to wake Dean, that was for sure.
"You're from the breeding facility?" Dean stepped closer, nostrils flaring as he took in more of Castiel's scent up close. Damn, the omega smelled as good as he looked. "Um. I'm Dean, Dean Winchester. That must have been my brother Sam you spoke to." Dean looked Castiel up and down, "you're perfect." He really was, the omega was small and slight, but still had muscle tone that spoke of the fact that he might be stronger than he looked. Giant, soulful blue eyes stared up at him, plush lips frowning slightly. Dean inspected what he was wearing and rolled his eyes. "Except for that awful dress," he added, "come on, I had them bring regular clothes for you."
Castiel nodded, "yes. We went dress shopping and I found the dress for the ceremony alpha." Charlie smiled and walked over taking a seat next to Sam.
Dean stood frozen, gaze traveling from Castiel's bare feet to the tip of his head and slowly back down, "Jesus fucking christ. Cas, you look amazing."
Castiel was amazed by how strong his brother was, a little whine escaped him. "It's okay, Luke. Dean, my alpha, saved me and has been taking care of me," he looked over to Dean and smiled at his soon to be mate. He was so happy that everyone was accepting him.
The flood gates opened and Cas told him how Dean had reacted, how Dean got upset with him being with Adam, and everything that happened when they got to the kitchen. Castiel curled up into himself, covering his face as he sobbed. His body was shaking with how upset he was.
Castiel sighed softly, "A-alpha," he didn't mind the kisses or scent marking, but sucking his neck in front of Sam and Charlie was a little embarassing. But at least he knew that the two didn't mind as Dean was trying to protect Castiel.
Adam shrugged, "alright, I'll link the audio so you can hear too." He plopped in front of the multiple large screens and clicked the mouse a couple of times, the audio and music coming from the speakers as well as the headset. Adam spoke to a person in his headset and his character starting moving, fighting the nearest enemies. Sometimes Adam would explain what was going on or describe a specific location but mostly he just let Cas watch.
Sam was starting to worry. Not about him or Dean. They would figure something out. But he was worried for Castiel. Who was still quiet, and looking more heart broken than before. "Cas? You okay?" Castiel barely nodded, but said nothing else.
Dean grabbed the hamburgers and grilling materials, smiling at Gabriel, "there's no need to thank me, Cas is the best thing that's ever happened to me." He headed over to where the rest of the people were gathered, feeling nervous.
Dean reached for Castiel's cock and stroked slowly as his tongue pressed into him, lapping up any slick that came out, thoroughly enjoying himself, "God, Cas, you're amazing."
"Sure, Cas. That sounds awesome," Dean turned to kiss Castiel's cheek and went to dry his hands, "by the way, I never asked, but it's been over three weeks since I've been with you. When is your heat due?"
The hot shower felt so good, and he lathered himself with the nice soaps and shampoos. He smiled, feeling much better now that he wasn't covered in mixed smells. It was just his scent now, and he couldnt remember the last time he'd been this clean.
"Perfect." Dean said again, hints of alpha red tinging the rim of the green of his eyes. Now castiel was undeniably his, and it made him want to purr in satisfaction. "Would you like to tour the house and grounds?" Dean finally asked, trying to distract himself to keep himself from just grabbing and kissing the omega.
Sam and Dean arrived precisely on schedule, Felix showing them into the office. Dean refused to show any sort of submission or respect, crossing his arms, "Father. We're here, like you asked. Now what?"
Dean stared at his plate, sighing. He wasn't sure how to reply to that. What would his mother have wanted?
"I expected more of you, Dean. That omega needs to learn that he is to do what you say when you say it," he said harshly, "if you don't start punishing him, I will. I won't have him shame our family by having a beta's bastard child."
Castiels eyes closed slowly and he whined some, this time in pleasure. It felt better than he expected, the nibbling at his neck made him shiver and Dean's stubble scraped against him in a soothing way.
“For you, sugar? Of course.” Pam started to turn away, but then she stopped and gave him a serious look. “Cas, maybe this is out of line, but I care about Dean a lot. He’s like a little brother to me, and I know he comes off all cocky and self assured, but underneath all that he’s really kind of fragile. And if you break him, you’ll have a lot of people to answer to. A lot of people in this town love Dean Winchester, and if you’re not planning to join the club, then you better get the fuck out of his life.”
Castiel waited for Dean's nod of permission before speaking. "Last night we stayed over at Michael's because of the snow, and Hannah walked in on us in a, uh… compromising position."
They continued to murmur words of love every time they could find the breath to do so. Dean kept the pace slow as requested, but he nailed Castiel's prostate almost every time, and in between thrusts he would grind his hips just right, rubbing his stomach against Castiel's slippery cock. Castiel drifted in and out of awareness, losing long minutes to white hot, all consuming pleasure that never quite peaked. He writhed and bucked his hips, moaning, "Please." He wasn't even sure what he was begging for except maybe for this to never end. He was securely pinned under Dean, completely in the other man's power, and he was loving it. It was so safe, so freeing.
They cleaned up and dressed as quickly as possible, but it was still a few minutes before they were presentable. Even then, 'presentable' might have been a stretch. Cas' hair might always kind of look like he'd just had sex, but this was definitely a different level of messy, not to mention his reddened lips and the hickey Dean had put on his neck where only a turtleneck could have covered it. Dean was sure he himself didn't look any less debauched, and there was no doubt that he was going to be walking funny for at least a few hours.
He didn't finish the thought, but Castiel didn't need him to. He knew exactly what Dean was trying to say. He'd never had a partner he trusted like he trusted Castiel, someone he was willing to make himself this vulnerable for because he knew they would never laugh at him or make him ashamed.
At the time he'd been too angry and panicked to consider that the subtle accusation might be a projection of Michael's own inadequacies. Now, in the cold, calm light of dawn, he wondered. Was this about more than Michael's need to control every aspect of Cas' life? Was Jack his only chance to have a child?
"Yeah. Good. Won a case last week. Kid's gonna get to spend Christmas with her mom instead of in a foster home."
Castiel's heart sank. "Of course, if you don't want to, that's —" He didn't get any farther because his mouth was suddenly occupied with other activities.
"They won't plow the roads until the snow stops," Michael said as they all dug into their food, "and since we're a bit out of the way here, we're often the last to get dug out. You're welcome to stay another night if need be."
When he turned back around, Dean was in Castiel's earlier position, propped up on his elbow, his eyes dark pools of want behind his glasses. However, unlike Castiel, his skin was flushed all over, and his hair plastered flat in places from pressing his head into the pillows as he arched his spine in pleasure while Castiel was massaging his prostate. There were also some patches of hair adorably sticking straight up like a hedgehog. His cock drooled pre-come, making a shiny wet patch just above his navel, and he smelled fucking
"No. I was teasing on the phone." Castiel shifted the leg that was slung over Dean's hip so Dean could go a little deeper. "I was fine until today, and I want you to spend time with your brother and whoever else you want to spend time with. I know I'm not the only person in your life."
"I gotta say, that was not what I was expecting from tonight," Dean said, carding his fingers through the wild mess of Cas's hair. It actually
"It wasn't all bad. I had Jimmy. We were very close back then. And Babi, our grandmother, did her best to give us a normal childhood whenever she got the chance. I think she would have fought for custody of us, but her health was poor. She had arthritis and diabetes. She couldn't keep up with two little kids on her own, and she was afraid that if she reported Mama to CPS, we'd get taken away and she'd never see us again. Which is, of course, exactly what happened when Mama died."
"Yeah, yeah," Dean laughed. "I'll behave. Tell you what. I'll put away the leftovers while you're makin' your little outline." He pecked Castiel on the cheek and got up to clear away the uneaten food.
She jumped off the bed and looked up at him expectantly, but she didn’t go to the door yet. She knew her job came first.
Naomi opened her mouth, presumably to continue arguing. In eight years she had never let him have the last word, but she was interrupted by Gabe the head waiter calling across the kitchen, "Phone for you, chef."
"Sam is coming to dinner tomorrow," Castiel said, not wanting Dean to suffer a moment longer than necessary. "You are of course invited too."
"Dean might have gotten all the culinary talent in the family, but I know good food when I eat it, and this is really good. Mind if I take more of that ratatouille?"
It wouldn't be that hard. People were always assuming they were a couple no matter how many times they explained that you didn't need to have romantic feelings for someone in order to express your affection for them physically. (The fact that Dean
"This is my colleague, Eileen Leahy," Sam introduced her. "She also specializes in family law, and I think her input on your case would be helpful, if that's alright with you. Eileen is deaf, but she can lipread, and I can sign for you if necessary."
Dean acknowledged the thanks with a nod, then turned his attention to his own slice of venison pie. "Fuck, Cas, this is amazing," he moaned around a mouthful, and though similar happily noised compliments were now coming from all around the table as everyone dug in, Castiel had eyes and ears only for Dean.
"Tell you what," the drunk said, closing the distance between them again. "Let's do a little experiment. You suck my dick, and if you don't get off on it then I'll believe you're not a pansy ass fag."
Dean knelt on the carpet beside the big bed, barefoot and shirtless. He'd left his jeans on, presumably in case someone other than Castiel came into the room first. His ass rested comfortably on his heels, allowing him to hold the position for an extended time without his legs getting tired, and his hands rested on his thighs. Castiel had seen Dean in this position so many times that it took no effort at all to see him naked in his mind's eye. The alpha's head had been bowed, but when he heard the door open, he looked up, locked eyes with Castiel, and then, never breaking eye contact, deliberately tilted his head back, baring his throat.
Sam raised his eyebrows when relief washed through Dean's scent, sweet and clear, but the sour note of worry didn't entirely dissipate.
want to do. They had only been dating for a few weeks, and he had only shared his heat with Luc because he developed an allergy to his then current suppressants. The doctor adamantly refused to prescribe him anything new until he'd been through a full cycle to purge the bad stuff from his system. He had been terrified. He'd
. If you must know he's still fast asleep in the motel room of the week, and when our conversation is over I will return you there if you wish. But I think when you've heard my offer, you'll reconsider that." He sat down beside Castiel on the sofa.
When he drew a nipple into his mouth, Dean groaned. He experimentally bit it a little harder, and Dean convulsed, pushing his chest into Castiel's face and tangling his fingers in Castiel's hair, an inarticulate moaning whine issuing from his throat. Castiel grinned. He had found his first sweet spot, and he hoarded the information greedily, determined to learn every inch of Dean's body by heart until he could reduce the man to a moaning, writhing, needy mess in seconds if he wanted to.
Dean nodded. “Yeah. I’m good.” He had gotten tested after the drunken one night stand that he barely remembered, and that was almost two years ago. He hadn’t been with anyone since. Speaking of which, “Cas, it’s, um … It’s been a while, so go slow, okay?”
was causing. He gripped the sink harder, using the cold and the ache in his fingers to ground him, distract him from his burning need.
Dean was quiet for a moment, his hand moving soothingly up and down Castiel's spine. Finally he said, "Cas, what you're describing… You realize it sounds like sexual harassment."
"Not that I recall," Castiel said, staring intently at the texture of Dean's jeans. "I suppose it could have happened when I was too young to remember it, or I blocked it out. But I think I prefer not knowing. I
She had her back to the door, talking to Naomi, but she turned at the sound of her name and lit up like the sun when she saw him. "Hey, chef." She had to hug him carefully because of the baby in a sling on her chest, but it was no less warm than her smile, and it made him realize how much he had missed her. Of all his coworkers, she was the one he considered closest to a friend. (Dean was in a category by himself.)
He kissed Dean's forehead, and gradually they drifted off in each other's arms. Tomorrow they would have a lot of difficult things to do, but they would do them together.
"Thank you for that book," he said as he rinsed plates and handed them to Dean to put in the dishwasher. "She really loves it. I can tell."
The rest of dinner was stiffly polite. They mostly talked about the weather. It was calling for at least two inches of snow overnight, which Jack was absolutely thrilled about.
Cas burrowed his face into Dean's jugular, breathing deep. His stubble rasped against Dean's skin. Dean cupped the back of Cas's head and encouraged him to press closer. A faint moan escaped Cas as he exhaled, and yeah, this would definitely be turning Dean on if it could.
insecure, and he needed to know for sure. “You’re not just teasing, right? You’re actually … interested in me?”
We're in the home stretch here, people, and you know what that means. Time to get working on that happy ending I promised. 😉
that when I was on my feet, they would relinquish custody back to me." Cas' voice was growing less flat and emotionless, rising to match his scent.
Part of Dean had known all along that Cas would say that, but he still marveled at his omega's compassion.
Cas wasn't in their room, so Dean assumed he was either still helping Hannah in the kitchen or tucking Jack in. He sat on the edge of the bed and focused on slowing his breathing and grounding himself, but his usual tricks — counting backwards from one-hundred, listing the things he could see, smell, feel, and hear — weren't working. He pushed himself to his feet, opened the closet, and pulled out Cas' shirt for tomorrow. It was clean and smelled mostly of laundry soap, but there was enough of Cas' scent still lingering in the fibers.
Dean smiled at that, touching her hand gently, "thank you. It was very important to me that his family be accepting."
"Of course not, Cas." Dean added quietly, still sitting a bit away and feeling incredibly guilty for whatever it was he did. Castiel smelled better, at least, and Dean wanted to just go soothe him. It was like a wild horse though, Dean felt like he needed to be slow and careful.
"Facing off. They need to make sure the other alpha is okay around you and the betas here," Anna whispered, watching as they postured a second before slowly relaxing, and Dean reached out a hand to shake that Lucifer took. "Thanks for taking care of my brother, " Lucifer said quietly.
Anna giggled, "sure. If he wants to." Everyone watched with a smile as Castiel placed Dean's hand on his sister's belly.
Dean groaned, "of course he does. Cas, it's almost time to get you measured, why dont you go to rinse off and get ready and I'll meet you there." He pulled Cas close to kiss him and got up to follow the servant, drying off as he went. He stepped into his father's office and looped the towel around his neck. "Father. What can I help with?"
Castiel cuddled against him, listening. "What does he mean by properly acting like an omega?" he asked as he stayed in the position Dean had him in. He loved the few quiet moments like this they had had. It was nice, and almost reminded him of before he presented when his family still loved him.
Castiel nodded and whispered, "I know." He then slowly went back into the bedroom and Charlie groaned.
"That's what I thought. Let's go home, Cas," Dean picked him up in his arms, curling him close. Sam hesitated only a moment before turning to follow them, his dad shouting curse words and threats at both his sons as they left.
Sam watched and caught his hand as he hesitated on a large diamond ring. "You can't, Dean. That was mom's."
Sam saw the expression and didn't know what it was about. Charlie didn't either. Castiel just smiled as he had no idea before saying, "Jack will be such a good big brother to our future pups."
Castiel watched his mate, then looked down at his belly. He wanted a pup, but not yet. He loved his alpha, but what could he do? He quietly left the room again and hoped maybe Sam would know what to do. "Sam?" He called softly as he walked down the hall.
Castiel looked at him, "Really?" He then looked at his flat belly and wondered if maybe he should skip the pills. Dean looked so happy around Anna with her being pregnant.
"Yes, of course, I'll make time and help as much as I can. Her name is Charlie. She's an omega too," Dean smiled reassuringly.
Gabriel held his hands up immediately, taking a step back, "holy shit. Hold on, red. Just saying hi to my very long lost brother."
Dean smiled, green eyes crinkling at the corners. "Don’t worry, you didn't realize, it's not your fault. Do you like tattoos?" He had goosebumps from the gentle touch, and was a little surprised by Castiel's interest.
Castiel leaned against him and sighed, "okay, I'll try, alpha Dean." He closed his eyes, slowly relaxing only to just about jump off Dean's lap when his bedroom door flew open and Sam rushed in, "Dean, it's Dad. I don't know exactly what happened, but he's going to kill Adam."
Dean slammed the door open, a snarl tearing from his chest, and his drunk father glared back, alphas posturing in the dim light, fangs glinting.
Castiel listened and his eyes widened. A public marking? And he had to plan it all on his own? But he didn't know what went on at one of these things! His mind started to race and his breathing picked up as he started to panic, "I can't do it. If I  mess it up and everything went wrong you'd be ashamed of me."
Castiel clung to Dean, whimpering he was sorry and he wouldn't speak his mind anymore. He was so scared of what would have happened if Dean had not been there.
Castiel arched his chest into the alpha's mouth, gasping. Never had anyone done the things Dean was doing. His brain was short circuiting.
