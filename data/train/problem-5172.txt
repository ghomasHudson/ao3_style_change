for this place, for his husband.
“Fine, okay, when should I expect you?” Cas winces as he observes his home in disarray. He begins to pick at his cuticles, ignoring the way that he’s made a mess of the room with foliage and dust.
Dean comes apart a little more. He's making little noises against the bed below, glad for something to bite into while Cas continues.
Dean sucks on Cas' jaw, which makes him shiver. He breathes against his neck, and even goes down to mouth at a nipple, though the angle is unfortunate.
Castiel just nods.
"Yeah. I can tell," Cas snorts.
"Claire and Jack, fourteen and eleven," Dean reads aloud breathlessly.
When Dean looks up at Cas from his plate, Cas is grinning.
Dean lets Cas take the pillow and position it below them. He lets a hand on his spine guide him to his knees. Dean looks up at Cas, hands on the floor and legs folded.
"That's my fault though," Dean argues.
"I don't deserve that."
"Dean?" Cas asks as he watches Dean flinch, suddenly worry is in his eyes, and he leans back to give Dean some space.
"Do you want me to call Sam? I wonder if he could make a weekend out here." Cas asks.
Dean just nods.
Dean decides the only plan of action is to hang on. He'll have to clean his act up, tidy the house, and get some stuff packed up so he has an emergency bag when Cas gets back.
A voice and another sharp slap to his ass snap Dean back into the coherent world. He moans and hums out in question.
Here is your "get better"!
"I— I wanted to call you to apologize. I've been feeling like shit all week for the way things went down," Cas says, his voice wavering.
"I hurt you," Cas says in a tiny voice that Dean hasn't heard for a long time.
One cottage-clean later and Dean and Castiel are the closest to fucked-out that anything non-sexual can do to a familiar and wizard. Dean isn’t used to channeling something so potent and having his partner have no control over how it loops back. Dean’s muscles are relaxed, his head buzzing pleasantly, tingling with the dopamine that connecting and helping gives him.
Dean yelps, “Hey!”
His last day of work rolls around. He sends some emails, packs what little is in his desk, and turns in his key card. Zach isn't there when Dean leaves, so he never really says goodbye.
Cas is eyeing him a little funny through the camera, partly ticked, but mostly calculating. He can't decide what's
Fuck.
Dean looks up and abruptly ends Castiel's thoughts by whispering, "How come you won't touch me?"
It hurts to breathe, anxiety shredding at his lungs with each gasp.
Cas blushes, “Oh.”
“Want you
“So I’m unfair?”
"I could have called. I could have asked for help."
John hums at this, dismissive.
Dean lets his hands slip to where the pudge he had always despised now has become the flat of his stomach. It feels wrong.
Dean reminds himself not to move and lets out a happy moan instead.
Dean freezes at Cas' hand on him, shaking his head, "But it still could make it hard."
Cas looks frustrated, but nods.
Not that Dean doesn't like getting Cas to that spot because, yeah, it's totally fucking addicting to see Cas lose his shit like that, coming so hard he can't speak and just giving in to what Dean tells him to do.
Dean has always been a bit of a baby when he gets sick, but Castiel enjoys taking care of him. He wishes Dean had said something sooner, Cas could have been on a plane a few days earlier had he known.
Dean, being ever so careful of the day before, asks, "Cas?"
His head hurt. He wondered vaguely if Sam was back to the bunker yet. He wondered if that was where Cas had gone.
"I don't. Dean is about to come down," Cas says.
"Yeah, but she didn't say to where. I've been stressed as fuck, I wasn't sure if Jack and I were headed to the same place," Claire says, seeming a little exasperated.
Left with bubbles, and getting to the scarring stage on the wound, Cas quickly tried to hurry the process, moving the fading to his own entity with very little problem. Years of Dean's guilt and discomfort slithered into Cas, seeming to make a home in his chest. They curled and buried themselves in his heart, and Cas clenched his jaw to try and stop the little whimper of sadness that rose to his lips.
Dean gets ready for work slowly. He cleans up his face with a razor and brushes his teeth. He puts on his work clothes without much thought.
"You're having trouble right now. You do not need to be thinking about how I am processing."
"And one time, Dad uh, well," Sam starts, hesitantly, "What has Dean told you about Dad?"
Dean gingerly places the bag back on the floor, slowly straightening up, back to Cas.
"I am frustrated," Cas agrees, watching as this statement makes Dean's face waver, "But I'm mostly frustrated that you'd think any of this would make me want you to leave."
The agent questions Dean about the theft charges. He explains the situation to her, describes how he sat in jail and how he paid back the fines with interest. By the end of the conversation she seems unconcerned, asking about their plans for where the kids could enroll for school.
So they just keep moving. They just keep packing up and hitting the road and setting up camp again, in their warded canvas tent. They camp in unmarked spots and pay for shit with cash. They pick up food in hoodies and face masks like they're worried about getting sick— and they kind of are. Cas learned to chop wood so they can start a fire some nights.
Sam smiled at him, “You realize you still do that, right? Protecting people from danger, being of help to Dean and I, you do more good than you know. And now, you get to choose the good you do as well.”
"Awesome, maybe we'll hear something soon! Seriously Dean, imagine. In maybe as short as a year, we could be actual parents," Cas sounds so excited.
Cas heads downstairs to grab the food from the front porch. It's fried rice and soup dumplings. Hopefully, Dean will perk up at the idea of one of his favorites. Cas retrieves some extra plates from the cupboard above the fridge, laying out their food and grabbing another glass of water from the Brita to replace the one that Dean is supposed to be finishing.
The bear is a bit smaller than black bears he has seen in the woods about his home. It is watching him carefully with eyes that are almost human. Its fur is sleek and clean, like it is used to being cleaned frequently.
Cas kisses him chastely, wiping them both down with a t-shirt that's on the bed. Cas rolls to the left and drags Dean so they're tucked chest to chest. Dean buries his face in Cas' neck.
A few meals get skipped here and there, maybe.
While Sam, Eileen, and Cas went back to the motel, he was given the job to swing past Joey and Annabell’s home to let them know that they were safe from the Wraith. The door to their home swung open before he could even knock and Joey was inviting him in for a celebratory beer.
"What? No you didn't." Dean says, incredulous.
Dean wakes up again at 5:30 am. It makes sense because he had fallen asleep so early.
"It's fucked up, but I wish I could go back and tell that lady the truth. I know I couldn't. I know there was too much on the line, but I swear to god Cas, I'd tell that lady in a heartbeat if I had the chance."
It’s quiet again for a moment.
Cas considers this, "I would like to go down on you, though."
In Cas' defense, he had always been a bit sick and twisted.
"You would do that again?" Cas asks.
Dean works Cas through aftershocks and into overstimulation. Dean enjoys Cas curling into himself a little with— "T-that's, oh, that's too much Dean. Too much!" — but he doesn't tell Dean to actually stop, so Dean knows he digs it.
“In fact, of almost anyone I know, you and Dean both are deserving of more good in your lives. It’s a shame the two of you can’t see that.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Dean says, voice much gentler now that they are closer, “What’s your name?”
“I like my home,” Cas says quietly.
Dean's words actually seem to surprise his therapist. Then again, Dean never brings his father up himself. They always start pleasantly and make the slow slide to the discussion of John.
John sighs, “You know there aren’t very many small owned businesses like Benny’s left because most of them are heavily regulated by the Human Services Administration.”
Castiel talks all the way home about how intelligent Jack is, how carefully generous Claire is. How sweet and personable the two do them are. Dean can't help but relish in how perfect it is all starting to seem.
“Get out,” John says quietly, voice with controlled anger.
Castiel continued with more confidence then, “I figured that if I could take on the havoc which Lucifer placed on your soul, I was more than capable of taking on some of the — feelings which seemed to be clouding up around Dean and redirect them into my grace so I could assist him as well but—”
"Okay, kiddo. What's goin' on?" Dean asks softly.
The second was love. Pure, unhindered adoration for this man. For all of the good which Dean possessed. Cas saw himself in all of Dean’s burning desire to do good. Castiel was floored by the selflessness contained in one human being, the way which Dean refused to take for himself, even when he was so deserving.
"Is this okay? I discovered it recently. They build very small homes."
Cas is slow to respond, "That's... good. Not what you usually would go for."
Castiel blinks, puzzled.
"Yeah. Still feels good that way though."
Castiel hadn’t been any good working at the apothecary either.
"I'm okay," Cas says, his voice raw.
He emails a few experts asking about his non-felony criminal record and adoption. Everyone tells him something similar: it's super situational. Sometimes it’s a problem, other times it’s not even a part of the conversation.
Cas was mostly trying to understand when he and Dean became a single unit in Sam’s head. He supposed that it makes sense, Sam knew the both of them better than anyone else.
"Tell me when you're close," Dean says, using his other hand to rub at one of Cas' dusky nipples.
Cas thought Dean was kind? And intelligent? Who the hell did Castiel have him confused with? Dean was a good for nothing womanizer with a GED, a give-them-hell attitude, and a death wish.
With Dean effectively immobilized, Cas lets his hips punch forward. His dick is already pretty deep, so the movement just slaps their skin together and stuffs Dean fuller.
Dean chokes, falling into Cas' arms as Cas moves forward to hug him.
Cas pulls back, tugging himself free of Dean's grip and grabbing at Dean's hips to get him, feet in the air, back flat and cock lazily resting against his stomach. Cas grips his dick, grabbing one of Dean's ankles and looking down at him as though he's some sort of gay offering.
“Do you need help with a spell?” He asks finally.
“But obviously it hasn’t been. So, what happened?” Sam pressed.
"Dean?" Cas asks, hesitantly.
"What's got you drinking tonight sweetheart?" Cas asks, getting his cup of coffee in hand and walking with his phone.
Dean is definitely not one of these people.
Castiel nods like he understands and then says, "It's not all new, though. Remember a few weeks ago when I held you against the bed after we showered?"
Dean is less concerned about making himself twitch and tremble with pleasure in front of Cas. Sometimes it feels good to be in control while they're fucking— like he's less vulnerable, and more Dean Winchester.
"Did that need a warning? My apologies."
“For sure! This place is like a dream come true, Cas. All those charms on the gates, on the plants, I can tell you’ve worked hard on it. I’m trying to talk myself out of asking to see inside as we speak.”
“Oh,” Castiel said, her shoulders slumping a bit. “Well, good. Because ‘
Sam would never know that Dean had donned his FBI threads and slipped out.
Zachariah’s eyebrows shot up and he tore his gaze away from Castiel once more. Behind the sharp, cold eyes there was a flicker of enticement, of intrigue. “Just the two of us?” Zachariah tilted his chin down, eyes widening ever so slightly. “To...speak?”
The rest of the story was lost in the shuddered breaths Cas was taking to try to calm herself. Knowing it wasn’t important, knowing whatever it was, he would forgive her, Dean squeezed her hand. “You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.”
"Dean," Cas asks, "Are you okay? I am checking in."
“You are a kind, generous and intelligent individual, Dean Winchester and I—“
“Yeah, I know. They kept telling me it was gonna be hard though,” Dean says, shaking his head.
"Healthy shit," Cas parrots.
Castiel supposed he was lucky that he knew for certain God was out there, listening.
Castiel watches him carefully with dark eyes. He can tell what Dean wants— he's giving all the signals that would normally have Castiel ordering him around or trussing him up already.
"Not a problem. I'm glad you're okay."
He doesn't get a response. Dean kinda-really wants to make out with his husband right now, so he peeks around the main level for him.
“It’s the same fucking thing! You should have fucking asked, you should have told me!” Dean was getting more pissed by the moment and Cas was watching as he closed in on himself.
Cas can tell that Dean is itching for it one Friday.
Claire interrupts a FaceTime call with Sam and Jess and ends up hitting it off with both. Dean carefully asks if Claire would think it was cool to fly out to California to visit Sam and his partners. Claire practically loses it with excitement – “California? Hell yes!”
Dean still says nothing.
So, Dean put out an ad on Craigslist looking for someone to move in.
Cas of course, watches all of this like he can't fucking take his eyes off it, his mouth parted in excitement.
In Sam's case, the pressure of Lucifer was too much for any human to bear. Castiel could handle it. It wasn't as though Cas didn't deserve to take it on either. It was his fault that Sam had been forced to suffer so much.
Two months in, they stopped using the second bedroom, and simply stored extra shit in there. It was nice too because when Sam came to visit, he had somewhere to crash that wasn't a couch.
They packed up and hit the road a few hours later, Sam and Eileen settling in the backseat and signing back and forth. Cas got in the car last and sat next to Dean in the passenger seat. He still seemed uneasy, but Dean decided it was a win that Cas even agreed to get in the car.
“Yeah. Like a therapist. For PTSD, Depression and Anxiety, and things like that.”
Cas is trying to get close to him again, trying to touch him.
that neither of them can move an inch.
"Are you letting me go?" Dean clarifies.
"Me too," Dean agrees, scratching his fingernails absently at his belly.
“Uh, Cas sweetheart?” Dean shouts.
Dean's seen this before, obviously. Like the night Dean woke up alone. Or the morning before their wedding. Or the week before a big exam or work presentation. Castiel has always been the one to think ahead, to plan. It's easy to be regarded as one of his talents— he is organized and careful. It is harder to remember that it can be one of Castiel's flaws.
A few moments later, Cas rolls his hips up towards Dean's cock where he is still sporting an unaddressed semi.
Dean can smell Castiel from how close he's standing. He can't seem to stop looking into Cas' eyes now, which is crazy because usually, he avoids it at all costs.
Dean knows that the tears are from crazy over-stimulation and the floaty space that Cas is in right now, but he still checks,
Dean sorta squints at this suggestion. What the hell does that mean? Dean has never been big on exercise, "I dunno Cas, I don't really want to."
"Dean?" Cas calls, his voice edged with worry as he takes the stairs two at a time up to their bedroom.
The magic is met with metaphorically open arms. The familiar receives it calmly and lets it flow back in a loop, stable and clear instead. Castiel feels himself start to calm down out of instinct— it feels so good to get magic so pure and cared for in return. Castiel has to remind himself to be on guard rather than take this magic and start using it. It is rare that Cas is able to get his hands on this much magic that is so steady.
Cas brings his hands up to the bar and guides Dean's hands to the cuffs, his back still flat to the wall. This position is going to be perfect.
But now it would come to bite him in the ass; how could Castiel still love him when he had been lying for so long?
Dean frowns, “Isn’t some of this stuff genetic though? Like I know I’m sarcastic like my dad. Probably depressed like my dad. Why wouldn’t some of his parenting techniques get ‘copy pasted’ too?”
After Dean feels like they're out of the water, he tentatively speaks,
He unlocks his phone and stares at the mostly one sides conversation on their text chat between him and his husband. Dean has been so distant.
Cas smiles at that, like he knew Dean would be uncertain.
Dean let out a low chuckle, "Just because I don't feel like talkin' about stuff doesn't mean I shouldn't."
“That’s the part I have trouble with, Buddy,” He told Castiel.
Castiel’s face is bright red, burning with this admission.
“I hope so. I think— well Cas and I had talked the other day about how we don’t give ourselves enough credit. For the things we deserve,” Sam explained. Dean glanced over at Cas, eyebrows pinched, and Cas had to look away.
"Had to let some people know that we were letting them go."
"You seem bored," Cas presses.
It's not like he killed someone. He didn't even have a felony or anything! He didn't hurt anyone! It was fucking petty theft and it was
Cas makes an agreeing noise, "That does sound like Dean."
“I remembered which was paprika this time,” Cas said sheepishly.
"No," Dean breathes, making certain to keep his arm up between them so Cas can't get any closer to him, "I can't. That's not all of it."
“I think he’s afraid Dean. No matter how lucky he is, I cannot blame him for that,” Cas responded.
"Yeah? What did you see?" Dean asks.
Something had to be done about this, and that terrified Cas a little.
Cas is looking at Dean with these
Dean has to fight every urge he has to wrap Cas up and whisper sweet things until things are all back to normal.
Things did not get less awkward. The case was shit too, and Dean could feel it wearing on everyone. The victim was a 44-year-old mother named Lauren, who was found with her brain sucked out of a giant hole in the back of her head. The whole thing was a textbook wraith, and Sam was sure to pack lots of silver.
Cas stills his movements and turns around in Dean's arms, catching Dean's lips in the sweetest kiss.  He lets his hands wander to Dean's ass squeezing in question.
“There’s rules though, okay? Once school starts I expect you to have it plugged in by a reasonable time. You can’t brag about it to Jack, either, I don’t want him to get jealous, but I think he’s still too young for a phone. I think we’ll make a rule that he’ll get one once he’s in middle school, but I just don’t think he needs—”
Dean comes forward to the chair and plops down in it, facing his boss.
"What do you mean by mopey?" Cas asks.
“Maybe give him a little time, but be certain to show him you're still with him. And when he does come back, talk to him. Tell him the stuff that you normally feel like you wouldn’t,” Sam suggested.
like Dean has changed everything. Cas looks devastated, frayed.
“How are your shoulders? We had your hands above your head for a long time,” Cas says. It sounds level, but Dean knows these check-ins are the moments that make or break whether Cas comes out of this level-headed or dom-drop-y.
Dean and Cas ask for the pictures to be sent to them.
Cas still did Dean’s extra dishes and picked his socks up off the floor. He made certain Dean was aware that Cas was still willing to help with the groceries. Dean had started fixing Cas’ coffee for him again in the mornings. That morning, Dean had even done the little, rhythmic knock on Cas’ door to rouse him from his meditation when breakfast was ready.
Dean sighed and ran a hand through his dirty blonde hair, “He’s just upset.”
"Sorry," Dean says roughly, his voice uneven.
Cas hesitates at this, freezing when Dean's hips jerk forward, away from the sharp sensation.
"I am well aware," Dean scoffs.
"Sorry. Would it help if he came to visit?" Cas asks carefully.
In fact, Dean is making this very clear from above, little quiet hitches of breaths trailing into hums and groans when Cas nips.
Cas mulled what Dean had said over.
“You asked to see that movie, Dean!” Sam complained but hopped in the backseat so Cas and Dean could sit next to each other on the way home.
That scared the fuck out of Dean, it always did. That was the hardest part of cases, seeing the victim’s family suffering, while Dean knew that he could have been there to prevent it. It was painful to see that expression on the face of a 16-year-old. Fuck, she was only a kid. He was going to need to keep an eye on her during all of this.
There was a brief pause.
Claire considers. Eventually, she nods slowly, "If I need you, I'll ask Sheila if I can call."
Dean leans forwards too, tastes the sweet in their air, in their space. Feels the charge in their skin, in the heat between them. The magic as it grounds him from his toes to his knees, up through his hips to his chest where they press together, the heat and the slick of their lips as they meet, slowly, wet and soft and so sweet—
, just different. He doesn't really look like Dean Winchester.
He knows he's being a little bit of a self-pitying asshole, that’s what Dad would say, hell that's what Sam has insinuated so many times. But Dean doesn't know what else to do. He's been fucking proactive, he's been healthy and applied to so many jobs. He's worked his ass off at work and been careful to keep Cas out of the loop.
into my house?” Bobby growled.
Everyone turned to Dean, whose mouth was a little o-shape.
Dean said tightly, tilting his head. This was absurd. This was
Castiel stood his ground, though he physically winced at how incredibly awkward he was. Barely functional or human, yet again. With a huff, he shifted on his feet and tried, “I just mean that it wouldn’t be a hassle. We can order food, too, if you’d like to stay for…” Forever. “...for a bit.”
Her thirty-five year old ass did not appreciate being referred to a little-anything, and she was pretty sure her GED and the one-year office administration community college course did not qualify her to do anything in IT. She was pretty sure a blind monkey would know how to copy and paste, but such thoughts were better left in her head.
That was another concern. The infertile men? Their fates were decided by lottery. Return to work or be sent to the outskirts of the state to tend to the livestock. In a few years, if the reproduction program was successful, there would be a boom in population. Food needed to be grown, milk needed to be produced for the children, and who knew how long this quarantine was going to last? The one in Venezuela had been going on for two years.
By the time Saturday morning rolled around, Castiel had only left Dean’s apartment once, and it was to get fresh clothing; a suit that was a bit ill-fitting, a dark blue tie because he didn’t own a black one. He’d wanted to wear a black leather coat he’d bought in his early 20’s, but that thing didn’t fit him anymore and would probably look better on Dean anyway. He took it with him to offer as a gift, and wore a beige, baggy trenchcoat he’d had hanging in the front closet for years.
Cas broke the silence first. He scratched at his stubble and swallowed, his throat bobbing. Roughly; “Should we...talk?”
“There’s no way you could’ve known,” Dean said. “And Ishim is right; you protect everyone like they’re family. You turned a bunch of wayward angels into a fuckin’ community of people who love and take care of each other. Angels in my world? They don’t have that. They’d lost all sense of their purpose. They lost their ability to love like…like they’d been meant to love. But here, you fostered family where you all had none—”
“Yes,” Castiel agreed. “I can also see them being curious about their past matches. Tammy and Joana had been together since before the Fall. If this cupid set them up before, he might be angry that Tammy was adulterous, that she—”
Castiel was distracted. Charlie saw her glance back over her shoulder, eyes sweeping over the staircase that led up to the stage. “Listen, Charlie—”
“I’m sorry. I’m so tired,” Cas breathed, reaching up to pull the baby wipe out of Dean’s grasp. He took it and wiped under his eyes. “This is humiliating.”
The Duke snorted. Then; “Hold her.”
Dean blinked. “What? You tryna barter for you life? How the fuck am I gonna save you? Why
“It’s supposed to be eighty degrees this weekend,” Castiel replied immediately, raising his head only to tilt it and narrowing his eyes at his friend. He was turning beet red as Uriel continued to sing under his breath. “Standing in a crowd of thousands of people, most of which are likely much younger than me, and leaking my bodyweight in sweat is not my idea of fun.”
With their fire and silver blades in tow, Dean followed Sam to the cave he’d scoped out a day earlier. They trudged through the forest, their boots squelching over damp mud and fallen leaves, eventually carefully lowering themselves down a ravine, and entering a dark, hidden cave.
Castiel, who was setting the table, wondered if he could get out of hanging out with these two if he stabbed himself with a spork.
I would have!” Jimmy said loudly, his widening. “Of course I would have, Jamie. I’d been waiting for Castiel all my life and—”
With delicious mystery meat steaming in front of his lips, Castiel asked, “That’s quite the battle. Who won?”
Castiel looked away and patted the clothing he’d left for her. “Thank you, Dean. For the clothing, and for brushing my hair. I won’t tell Sam.”
“You think I’m reckless,” Dean interrupted, reeling back a bit. He heard his father’s voice in his head, yelling at him for being reckless, for not being proper, for not taking good enough care of Sam.
“My babies,” she repeated, her voice careful, calculated. “Birthed you, clothed you, and tried to protect you, but all that got me was dead.”
busy, so ask your questions and go.”
look i lived okay? Didn’t wake up in an ice tub with a kidney gone… though dude was weird enough that i’d consider that a close call
Again, Cas’ fingers touched Sam’s forehead and Sam’s relieved sigh was loud in the hallway as the injury to the back of his head presumably healed, judging by the glow from Cas’ fingers above his brow and the colour that returned to his face.
“Uh, yeah, sure,” Dean muttered. “I can figure it out.”
“What the fuck—” he choked out, pressing a hand to his thighs and giving his head a strong shake.
Again, Dean was sending him mixed messages, because the second Castiel tried to relax, he felt a hot tongue slid between his asscheeks, licking a stripe over his tight hole, and he sucked in a breath, overwhelmed by how hard his cock got in a matter of seconds. He hardly had time to recover before Dean was sucking and licking circles, and patterns and stripes across the tight ring of muscle. Every time he sucked, Castiel felt his legs tremble and his back give a abrupt jerk, his spine arching and convulsing. No one had ever put their mouth on him like that and he suddenly realised why he felt like his sex life had been missing something. Clearly his sex life had been missing Dean’s tongue on his asshole.
“Again,” Dean grunted, his fingers tightening around Castiel’s ass, and his fist twisted around the sensitive, slick head of Castiel’s dick.
Castiel shook her head, pushing hair away from her face. Brokenly, she whispered, “Amelia deserved to know that we’d broken her trust. She deserved to know Claire was actually Jimmy’s. It felt wrong, Naomi, it felt wrong for her to raise a child that had come from a lie, from such a betrayal. I-I’ve told you—”
The air around him seemed to chill and Sam felt goosebumps pull up from his skin. His mouth felt dry and he felt a shudder of panic. “Why?” Sam asked, his voice raspy. “You think...you think the apocalypse is going to happen?”
She began to beg as the Duke touched her, his one hand bunching her skirt up around her waist, and the other pushing her legs apart. The desperate eye contact she made with Raphael did nothing to draw mercy from him. He stared at her coldly and yanked her wrists forward, straining her arms in their sockets.
To her dismay, Jamie didn’t make any bad decisions. As she promised her brother, she didn’t do acid. After their phone call, she was a little bit offended. She liked to tease him for being a straight-edge, good Christian college boy by joking about drugs, but she didn’t actually do many drugs—sure, she dabbled in some pot a few times a week and yes, sure, she did some acid a few times a year, but her job was stressful! People who didn’t deal with Steve from Sales had no idea how crazy she was being driven.
Sam sighed, sliding his thigh over the iron balcony, and sitting on the rail. He looked out into the street, watching the people meander back and forth. Beggars and prostitutes littered the sidewalks and lurked at the mouths of dark alleyways.
The crowd murmured to each other in confusion, but Dean couldn’t care any less about the fucking play or the stupid theatre.
Fuck, he wished he could’ve held Cas, too. But the thoughts of guilt and rumination about why he was undeserving haunted Dean all the way back to the motel. He crossed the parking lot, drowning in his own mind, and walked right past the Impala towards the room.
The bed dipped down, and the heat of Dean’s body was comforting as he lay down beside Castiel, not pressed too close, but close enough.
“Her what?” Dean choked out, but was drowned out as the cast and crew broke out into shrieks and cheers of joy, mixing in with the audience that were clapping thunderously on the other side of the curtain.
“That’s what I thought,” she groused.
“Look,” Dean sighed, waving the script as he spoke. “I haven’t seen you since that last cabaret night Cas, it’s been weeks—”
But that had been so colossally stupid that Dean had actually taken a lighter to the page and burnt half of it before he realised the play wasn’t important enough to be the reason he died in a tragic house fire.
Kevin snorted. He wrapped an elastic around a wad of cash and picked up another pile, resuming his counting. His eyes flickered up to Dean and his one brow raised. “What’d you think of Castiel?”
At the end of a long, dark hallway, they spotted the chapel. On either side of the corridor, other doors were opened and Castiel led the way, deciding that if she was going to rebel, then the least she could do was to lead herself into it.
And Dean’s. She was theirs. Their baby. He couldn’t lose another one, not after Jack.
“Dean?” Lee greeted, stepping away from the group of people, who all watched the interaction with a collectively held breath.
Castiel lifted himself off the ground, climbing up the ladder even though his abs and legs burned. He clicked on the heating pad and crawled under the sheets with it. He wasn’t sure why he wasn’t able to respond to Dean, but he suspected it was because there was a huge lump in his throat that felt like guilt and shame.
Dean backspaced, muttering under his breath. Kastielle didn’t see like a super angelic-type spelling.
“Anyways…”
“Sounds fuckin’ terrible.” Dean snorted and looped his hand through the wheel as he pulled them into a parking spot outside a restaurant that had a carpeted entrance roped off by red velvet ropes.
Dean turned to Cas and gripped his wet face, which was actually sweaty now, from the hyperventilating and fighting tooth-and-nail to get away from Hannah.
Feel exhausted and feeling her typical mask of propriety and obedience slip, she continued on bitterly, “What use would a sick whore be? What use would—”
"I remember," Cas' said quietly. "I remember how you were when I found you. And I know that's not who you are."
“‘Couldn’t do it, couldn’t deal, couldn’t answer questions. I just shut down, went into my room, locked the door, and got under the covers. And then I missed my pills the last few days and that was making me feel sick and—and—”
“Go talk to her,” Sam said. “I think if she’d try to kiss you or invite you somewhere private to convince you that you don’t need anyone but her, she’s probably a siren.”
Antonia?’ because she cheated on him with the rose gardener. When she acts confused, he can pull out a rose and he can throw it at her. He’ll then step closer to her and whisper, ‘What did he give you that I could not?’”
what I was asking about. Anyway, I’m glad you came alone. Sometimes I get overwhelmed with more than one person on such short notice.”
Thank you SO MUCH for sticking it out this far. I hope you enjoyed the fic!
Of course, Castiel was alive again. Returned from the Empty. Human. Still, apparently, in love.
Once they all heard a door close upstairs, Amelia stepped out onto the porch, closed the door behind her and she stepped between Jimmy and Jamie, her face hard but her eyes tearful. “How can you just show up here after a year? After you just left?”
The man sighed behind him. Castiel felt him lean close, his hot breath dancing over Cas’ neck.
when it didn’t go away. I mean, fuck, what did they expect when my d-dad got sick and Sam had fucked off?"
“That’s rude,” Dean chuckled, feeling tickled despite the fucked up situation they were in.
Castiel turned from her and nodded to Hannah, Sam, and their Hunter friends. They all moved to exit the corridor, but Dean stayed put, gazing at Daphne, who stood in the entrance to the corridor, looking broken.
Her hand loosened on his face, and all Castiel could do was hold back a shudder as her cold hands dragged down his neck and the front of his black t-shirt before it settled on his stomach under his navel, pressing into the skin there.
“I’ll try my best, Claire-bear. I have to spend time with the Duke, tomorrow,” she explained quietly.
“Yeah?” Castiel breathed against his neck, glancing up at the duke’s face. “You like that story? I’ve got more where that came from, big boy.”
The last thing Dean wanted to know was that Castiel’s biological baby was cute. He was still working through the fact that his angel, his warrior of God, had fallen from Heaven, suffered homelessness, was kicked out from her family’s home, and then gotten pregnant like some runaway teen. Castiel was a single mom now and it made him dizzy just thinking about it. The hits just kept on coming for Cas, and Dean wondered how many of those hits were inflicted by him personally.
“Oh!” the nasally man said on the other end. He chuckled too loudly into the phone. “How’d you know it was me?”
“I don’t think so, Dean. I should probably rehearse, and I have a very high profile client I have to service the next night, I should get rest…”
They stared at each other and then Castiel waved again. “Goodbye, Dean.”
Dean shuddered.
“I’m very sorry for your loss.”
“At intervals. Uriel and his superior, Zachariah, are nowhere to be found at the moment, so I believe I’m safe for now. I came as fast as I could,” she murmured, lowering her eyes to the ground. “After what happened in the church, I was given responsibility over you. But they still don’t trust you, and as I said before, they’ve sensed that I’ve begun to express emotions.”
“She didn’t stay long at the housewarming,” Cas throws in. “We need some more time, there might be warding at her house – maybe we could try a distraction, so she stays longer?”
Cas looks at him, his blue eyes rimmed red. It’s obvious he has been crying, and only brushed the tears away after Dean’s knock. Still, he opens the door more, so the other hunter can enter his room.
“Can I talk to you about something? In private?” His voice sounds strangely scared and shaky. He is afraid of something, Charlie realizes, before she nods.
Dean hesitates, thinking about his answer. He is honestly surprised Sam didn’t ask about it the second Dean had mentioned the spell. Aphrodite isn’t the goddess of love for nothing. The myth says, the spell only works for true love and the spell in the book also requires the blood of the persons true love.
Dean rushes to his side, Cas joining them immediately. The opened page describes a weapon, which can only be found in a certain parallel universe. Seemingly, it’s powerful enough to kill any God, even Chuck, and the needed spell to open the portal is scribbled next to the text in blue ink. Dean can barely believe their luck, as a grin spreads over his face.
“Both parties need to reach orgasm, in whatever way comfortable for them. It doesn’t matter if it happens through physical touch, oral stimulation, penetration…,” Castiel answers casually as if he is trying to explain a recipe to Dean. But still, the hunter can detect a faint hint of nervousness in his voice. Who would have thought that Castiel, angel of the lord, would be nervous about sex? But then again, Dean isn’t doing much better.
“This is my brother Dean,” Sam introduces him, and Dean tries his best to give a fake smile and nod politely at the boring stories the neighbors tell him. This is going to be a long evening…
“Dean?”, he whispers, and the hunter feels the ground beneath them shake again. His hands hold Castiel tight, afraid he might lose him on the way between the worlds. The next second, they are back in the bunker, Sam staring at them with open mouth. Cas tries to stand up and Dean still holds onto him, like Cas is his lifeline. When Cas finally stands steadily, Dean falls into his arms, hugging him close. In the corner of his eye, Dean sees Sam sneaking out of the room. Dean takes a deep breath, before he speaks again.
“He’s not trustworthy, he’ll double-cross us the second he gets the chance,” Sam counters, confirming Dean’s suspicions only further. They sit in silence for another moment, weighing their options. They need the portal to get the weapon, so far it’s the best shot they got at defeating Chuck once and for all. Finally, Dean has enough. The answer is so obvious, but neither Sam nor Cas are accepting it.
“Well, hello you handsome fellas,” a sudden voice snaps them back to reality and when they look at its owner, Beth is smiling at them. “I thought it was you, so I just had to pop in and say hello.”
Dean’s promise lasts around 20 minutes, which is already longer than he honestly would have expected. He and Mary will enter Jennifer’s house at 1800 sharp, leaving them with just enough time to trash her little altar and the supplies. Jack is going to start with his distraction around 10 minutes earlier, giving Dean enough time to slip out quietly. It’s all planned to the minute, which of course means, it’s destined to fall apart.
He swallows the rest of his Whiskey, before stepping close to him. Their faces are only inches apart.
“No way, he looks like a serial killer. And that comes from a killer, so that means something.”
“Yes….”, he finally breathes, a small smile on his lips. “I think I’ve been in love for a long time…”
He leans in, and Elliot meets him in the middle. With his eyes closed, the kiss doesn’t feel any different from kissing a woman. There are the same butterflies in his stomach, and the same need to feel skin under his hands. The same thrill of having a strange tongue inside his mouth. It just shouldn’t feel that
“You’ve been screwing my brother?!” he yells, before locking eyes with Dean. “And you! Is this why Fernando broke up with me?”
Castiel’s blue eyes are still scanning him, as if he’s trying to figure out if Dean is serious. But the more Dean thinks about it, the better idea it is. Having sex with another guy was always one item on Dean’s bucket list, and now seems the best possibility for it. It wouldn’t even count as gay, since Cas is only inhabiting a male vessel. And this way, Dean doesn’t have to drive the Impala back home in his drunken state. Dean and Cas keep their eye contact, not caring or noticing the bar or the crowd around them. Another handful of seconds passes by until Cas finally gives in.
If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it even make a sound?
The door opens and like a flash, they both race forward. Dean doesn’t even know where to go, but he tries his best to follow the guy in front of him. He can feel his heart pumping in his chest, while his lungs work at max capacity. It’s times like these where Dean curses his love for burgers; Sam probably wouldn’t have an issue with running across a crowded train station.
“It’s Jennifer,” Cas says, once the image of Dean flashes over the laptop screen. After several neighbors pointed out how attached Dean seems to be to his brother, they decided to stick to virtual conversations for the moment.
“This might sound crazy, but I love…”
“You okay? I know, it can be weird at first…,” Tyler asks, with his dark eyes looking at Dean. But he just gives him a warm smile, before leaning in for another kiss.
, Dean thinks to himself. He and Cas had stopped in a small diner in Idaho, only wanting to grab a bite before heading back home. There are only a few tables occupied and when they sit down, the waitress lights the candle in front of the hunters.
He’s talking about Heaven now, but there’s still a flash of pain when he remembers the Winchesters did the same to him. When he needed him the most, Dean cast him out of the bunker. Castiel expects to be met with silence. No one could possibly understand his complicated life and the choices he had to make. Or could they?
The words sound muffled, but Castiel gasps slightly and Dean is sure, he must have heard them. Castiel’s arm feel stiff around his body, so Dean pulls slightly back and cups one of Cas’s cheeks with a hand. As their eyes meet, Dean can’t hold himself back.
“Ah, sorry – this is Castiel. He’s a – he’s my friend,” Dean stutters, before introducing Elliot to him. He thinks, he can see his former lover give the angel a second glance, but it might as well be his imagination. Everyone shakes their hands awkwardly, before standing in silence again. Luckily, neither Cas nor Luke have any idea how their companions know each other. Another moment passes quietly.
Dean thinks to himself, as he cups his lovers face with his hands.
At least no one can break his heart this way.
His words are cut off by Castiel’s lips on his and he tries to put all his unsaid words into the kiss. As they separate, a huge smile rests on the angel’s face.
“And since then you never…,” Dean starts asking, already suspecting the answer to his question. His brother and his friend just regard him with raised eyebrows, before Castiel shakes his head in a stern motion.
“What about the other person, the one who changed your perspective on your father? You know, family isn’t always the people who are bound to you by blood. And sometimes, the only thing we can do is leave behind those who only do us harm,” Father McKenzie tries to explain as the words come out in a practiced sound. How many abused spouses did this poor man already coach through life? How many abandoned children?
“Hello Dean”, Castiel finally says, a smile in his voice. Dean could cry tears of happiness, but not now. He needs to say some stuff.
The words escape Dean’s mouth before he can realize what he just said. Castiel is staring at him, his eyes widened and mouth agape. It would be a hilarious sight, if Dean hadn’t just proposed sexual intercourse.
“There are a few people we can surely rule out,” Cas replies, stirring some sugar into the coffee mug Dean pressed into his hands. “On my drive yesterday, the energetic waves were much stronger at the end of the street.”
He’s close to suggesting a fake relationship with their mom again when Cas simply nods to answer Sam’s question. “Of course, Sam. I mean, I do.”
“If the situation needs it, sure…,” Sam replies, but Dean interrupts him before he can continue.
Dean’s fingers halt on the car keys. Part of him wants to run away, but it wouldn’t help. He looks over to the passenger seat, where Elliot is still looking at him. And Dean wants to kiss him, he realizes. Fuck it, he already made it so far.
“I’d rather find a male companion.”
The subway makes its way through the city, but it’s still going far slower than the thoughts in Dean’s mind. He tries his best to calculate his route to the train, but the resolution doesn’t satisfy him. Even if he runs, there’s no way he’s making it in time. But he sure as hell ain’t staying any longer in this city than necessary. He should at least try to get the train, maybe it also got delayed in the process. The speakers announce his stop, and both Dean and the stranger place themselves in front of the door.
“I mean, there’s a simple solution to the issue,” he exclaims, his hand showing towards Cas.
After some discussion about clothing choices, Cas also strips down to his underwear. Cuddling in jeans and a dress shirt would have been awful, and Dean luckily managed to convince the angel of it. The bed is more than big enough for the both of them, as they lie facing each other in the dark.
His first challenge awaits him with his clothes: what the hell do you wear if you want to attract a homosexual man? It’s not like he has an entire closet to choose from, but he decides on some simple jeans, a black shirt, and a red flannel. Marco’s red flannel. It’s been several years since he gave it to Dean, but the hunter never could push himself to get rid of it. Tonight, he wears it like armor.
And Bisexual.
Right now, he only cares about Cas next to him.
“Don’t be silly, of course I mean the Winchesters!”
“I still think this is a stupid idea,” Dean protests, as he puts the meatloaf in the oven. Somewhere behind him, he knows Cas is preparing the salad and Sam is busy fluffing some pillows on the couch.
Dean wants to say more, but he hears a sound behind him. There’s some black goo at the wall, and he looks back at his angel. They are both crying, their tears filled with all their unsaid words. There’s a shaky hand on his shoulder – the shoulder where the angel first lay hands on him – and Dean looks into the familiar blue eyes for the last time.
“I love you, too. Of course I love you”, Dean murmurs into Cas’s shoulder and he feels the hug getting tighter.
“I’m Elliot”
When Castiel finally stops for a moment, the angel blade raised high in the air, Dean finally finds his words again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Jennifer doesn’t answer, and he doesn’t need her to.
“How long were you waiting to tell me that?”
“Shouldn’t it be Deastiel?” Sam teased him. He obviously thought about the whole thing as a joke, while Dean was close to a panic attack. If some high schoolers could see his true sexuality, who else knew about it?
For Nesli.
That’s the deal he made with that fucking crossroad demon. And now, Dean only got a few weeks left before he will bite the dust. And all of it to save his little pain in the ass of a brother. Sam barely leaves his side nowadays, almost like he is afraid Dean might die before his time. And as much as Dean enjoys the company of his brother, he feels like a kid with a babysitter. But then again- a normal babysitter wouldn’t research ways to get someone out of a demon deal. Still, Dean prefers the research to Sam’s other plans, which consist mostly of cultural activities.
Happy Valentine's Day. I wish all of Dean and Castiel a happy Roadhouse wedding.
. If Cas still had his wings, he’d take them far away from this place. Somewhere nice, where it doesn’t stink of hopelessness and despair. But then again, he’d take Dean anywhere. Even if Dean had proposed moving to the forgotten wreck of the Impala, Cas would gladly crawl in the backseat. Cas just nods, before he gets pulled upwards and into the direction of the shabby cabin. It may not be much, but it’s the closest thing Castiel has to a home. Besides Dean, of course.
“Sex wasn’t really one of my priorities in the last few years, I was rather busy trying to save your asses all the time.”
It’s not long until the other angels catch up with his sympathies. Gabriel is the first one to comment it to him, right after he finally released the Winchesters from the so-called “tv land”. The Winchesters have long left the abandoned factory, but Cas returns as soon as possible. He has a fond memory of Gabriel, they were close friends a few thousand years ago. It seems like his brother had the same idea since he is still sitting where they had left him earlier.
“Please, Ty”
In his mind, Dean is sleeping with Cas. Their legs intertwined, fingertips ghosting over soft skin, sweet nothings mumbled in between loving kisses. He dreams about strong arms holding him, and blue eyes staring right into his soul. About the way, the angel says his name, and how it would sound as a moan. But when he opens his eyes again, he is always alone.
“Huh, and I thought you wanted to kiss me now”
“Thank you. And thanks for helping me.”
Dean can only hope, God isn’t judging him.
Dean hates taking trains. They’re usually late, crowded, and far too often carry the subtle smell of urine. He’d rather race along the highways with his beloved Impala, blasting some cassette tapes out of the speakers, than spend his time in those germy mass transportations. But Baby is still in the garage after a recent car crash, which still pisses Dean off. At this point, he probably could have fixed the issues faster than those overpaid mechanics. He had hoped they would have Baby ready by the time he has to go to his stupid work conference in Atlanta, but of course, the shop owner still waits for spare parts. Fucking fantastic.
Dean sighed and felt his heart speed up a little. A fist was one thing, this was quite another.
Cas rolled his eyes and looked up at the girls. “Sorry, ladies, the queen beckons.” He extricated himself from the couch and grabbed Dean away from Anna and Jo as he passed. They pouted but quickly got over it when Meg and Bela pulled them over to their side of the couch.
The grunts and groans of the other people were suffusing Dean’s senses. This is what he came for after all.
“I think I'm adorable,” Dean bragged, desperate to feel every inch of this man.
Cas held his fist right at the edge of Dean’s body, slowly opening it as he twisted his hand left and right in the warm-wet tissue. The pressure was incredible, like a bomb exploding in slow motion, ever expanding.
“Come on, cowboy, gimme a good ride,” Benny slurred, drunk on the way Dean had stuffed him.
“Welcome back, cowboy.”
“That’s right, who’s my little cock slut?” Dean could hear the grin on his face.
“Shit, man,” he spluttered, “you can’t just say that to a guy.”
“Basically, I want to watch you fuck yourself on this. I think it will stretch you out beautifully.”
Dean followed him out to the porch where he’d had his little existential crisis earlier. He noticed one of the street lights was out, a lone spot of black in the otherwise well-lit neighborhood. Dean’s Impala and a grody looking Lincoln Continental were the only cars left at the curb. Dean huffed out a little laugh before he could catch himself.
“Hold it, hold it,” he said, wide eyes never leaving Dean’s. “The name of the game here is stamina, at least for us. Have you ever edged before?” he asked.
“God, I wish you could see yourself. Hmm.”
Dean shook himself, trying to get rid of the giant butterflies in his stomach. He’d done scarier shit than this before. Like that time in middle school he’d tackled the neighbor’s Yorkie thinking it was a werewolf. He could for sure handle this. He quickly divested himself of his clothes, pausing when he reached his black briefs. It felt so weird to be walking into a room full of strangers naked. But, he figured, they’d all be naked too. Even footing, so to speak. With a deep breath, he hauled those off too.
The right side of Cas’ mouth edged up, that secret smile he only ever gave Dean.
“I would think that would be pretty self-evident, Dean.”
Dean glanced up from where they were joined and saw Cas cradling Anna’s face to his, kissing her again. He also spotted the silver barbells piercing Anna’s pert nipples. He bent towards her, capturing one in his mouth and running his tongue along the cold metal. She broke off the kiss with a moan and grabbed his head, holding him tight against her breast. His distraction allowed Cas to take more control, grinding up into her and against Dean.
Dean stared at the thing cradled in Cas’ hands. Covered in swirling shades of green, it would almost look like a piece of art if it weren’t for the very obvious shape.
“What the fuck was that?” Dean asked.
He could hear the orgy before he could see any actual action. Lots of moaning, interspersed with curses and laughter, the sound of skin on skin, the thumps of bodies moving. He could see a table set against the wall facing the stairs, complete with bowls of various kinds of food, bottles of Gatorade and water, plus what looked like a shelf’s worth of different kinds of lube. Considerate of Becky to provide refreshments, he thought absently. At last, he reached the bottom of the stairs and was officially out of any excuses. He took a deep breath and turned the corner.
Dean shifted his attention back down. “You pick the color?”
“You...” started Dean, blinking, “taste like the ocean.”
“Sam! Chill the fuck out!” Charlie yelled.
Just as he felt like he was about to melt into a pile of pudding, the lights blinked and a weird noise sounded through the room. Cas sighed and laid his head on Dean’s shoulder. “Goddammit.”
“Yeah dude, totally. Awesome.” Dean just could not stop tripping over his feet with this guy. Thankfully, Cas didn’t seem to mind.
“What, Charlie? I’m kind of in the middle of something. You appear to be as well.” Cas was reclined on the couch under Bela, mouth wet from her juices. Bela and Meg were laying siege to his dick, bringing it slowly back to life.
“Well, I think that would also be obvious, wouldn’t you?”
His cock bobbed in front of him, a shadow in the mirror, kissing his belly wetly with each undulation of his hips. He shoved down as far as he could and darkness enveloped the room once more, with just the small halo of light shining from underneath his balls. He felt like an inverted angel. Or something. His brain had clocked out long ago. He wiggled around and nearly choked on his own spit when the ridged edges finally found his prostate.
With deep breaths he came back to himself. “Fuck, I'm sorry, didn’t mean to do that.”
“Hello, everyone! I hope it’s been a good night,” she crowed. Dean found himself glad that Becky was merely the host of this thing and not a participant. Someone would have to keep her mouth stuffed the whole time.
Fingers nudged at his mouth and Dean eagerly took them in, getting them sloppy with spit, as Cas rained kisses across his shoulders. He could feel Cas’ hard dick against his crack, pushing insistently. He barely needed it after the attention Anna had given him earlier, but Cas took his fingers from Dean’s mouth and pushed them in his hole, pulling a gut deep moan out of Dean as he scissored them expertly. Cas seemed pleased to no end.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck.”
“Dean, uh, my name’s Dean, and uh, yeah, yeah, I agree,” he stammered, momentarily started by Cas’ directness. For some reason, he hadn’t even thought about exchanging names. The whole time, Cas never stopped twitching his hips up into Meg.
He settled back down behind Dean and, with little preamble, shoved his hand back up inside Dean. His body welcomed him back like a long-lost friend, sucking Cas’ fingers back inside with a wet snap. Dean moaned and set his head back down on his forearms.
The feet returned and brought Cas back with them.
"You guys got room for one more in there?” A voice came from above their heads. Dean looked up behind Benny. It was the moose, Sam, and from his angle on the floor, Dean could see that everything lived up to the nickname.
Cas set Stan down between them and leaned over. Kissing Dean softly, he whispered against his lips, “Remember. You’re going to be fine.”
“I’ll be seeing you.”
“Can I help you?” she clipped out.
Cas stood in front of him and as he opened his mouth and leaned his head back, he focused on those steely eyes. He reached up and added his hands to the mix, stroking up and down randomly, running his short nails along Sam’s balls, rubbing Gabriel’s thigh. All he could hear was the slap of skin on skin as these men he barely knew jacked off intensely above him. He had to admit, it felt pretty good knowing he was the sole object of their attention.
Benny turned his slate blue eyes to Dean and flashed a feral grin. He reached out and grabbed Dean’s hand, pulling him in till his arm wrapped around his neck. “Yeah, could definitely have some fun with you,” he drawled, scraping his eyes down and up. “Ready for another round, cher?”
Thankfully, Cas made the decision for him. Grabbing the phone out of Dean’s hand, he deftly typed something into it before handing it back. Dean glanced down at it: Castiel Krushnic plus his phone number. Hmm. Interesting name for an interesting dude.
Cas’ fingers tugged at the sides of his rim, spreading him wide as a four-lane highway. He bore back down, weirdly feeling like he was taking a reverse shit. One of Cas’ hands moved to his hip, helping him wriggle around the wide head.
Cas allowed it. “Little over a year. It’s a nice way to blow off steam, meet new people.” He glanced sideways at Dean, then gestured out to the rest of the group. “You met Meg and Anna already. That’s Jo,” he pointed at the blonde, “Bela,” the slender brunette, “and Charlie,” the other redhead, “with their mouths glued together.” Cas waggled his eyebrows. “The moose is Sam. The dude fucking him is Gabriel. And -”
Dean tossed his empty Gatorade bottle in the trash and grabbed a handful of sunflower seeds. He needed something to focus on.
It was Cas, of course. Though he was just as occupied as Dean was, if not more so. Bela laid on the couch perpendicular to Cas, giving him what looked like one hell of a blowjob if the tight, white-knuckled hold Cas had on her hair was any indication. Stood above them on the couch was Gabriel, to whom Cas was giving a stellar looking blowjob of his own.
“If I asked you to do something, would you do it?” With that voice, Dean thought Cas could ask him to rob a bank and he’d do it.
Dean shuffled his feet a bit, glancing around the porch. “I had a little trouble finding the place. I’m not real familiar with this neighborhood.” He gave her his best grin, the kind that used to get him out of a smack down when he got caught stealing for the umpteenth time.
Cas’ fingers danced along his spine, encouraging. “Come on, honey, come on.”
Fuck. Cas hadn’t trimmed that pinky nail very well and it was doing amazing things to Dean’s insides. His thighs shook, slick with the half bottle of lube Cas had already poured in there. His teeth chattered. His eyelashes fluttered. He thought he might come right there.
“Shit!” he yelled, never gladder that Cas didn’t have neighbors.
“That is the plan.”
Dean knew, he knew, and he still asked anyway. Though they’d experimented with a lot in the time they had been together, handcuffs, wax, panties and such, they’d never done something quite like this.
Meg made a sound of indignation around Dean’s dick and flipped Cas off but otherwise never stopped her ministrations.
Dean glanced back at his car, one among a few others parked along the curb. He spied a yellow Gremlin and a sweet looking Harley among the lot. Maybe he could just turn around here, just drive off, pretend this never happened, find another way to spend what was left of his Saturday night.
“Uh, I'm here for the uh...” he trailed off, then, soto voce, “...orgy? I’m a friend of Chuck’s?” Dean stammered out.
“Nope, that belongs to Meg, believe it or not. A tough ride for a tough bitch, in her words.”
Cas smiled and shook his head. “You tell me. Looked like a good place, though.”
The woman, Meg, growled and threw her body back against Cas’. “What have I told you about calling me that?”
Dean’s mouth was sticky. “Where did I go?”
Cas chuckled. “Just because you don’t like it doesn’t make it any less true.” Cas looked up at Dean. “Am I right...?” he trailed off.
“Oh, Dean, you give yourself so little credit. You didn’t think my fist would fit either and then you cried as you came around it.”
“Oh, don’t worry ladies, next time I’ll bring enough double ended dildos we can have ourselves a daisy chain.”
“It glows in the fucking dark,” Cas nodded, smile maniacally wide now in the dim light.
“Okay, so what’s the plan here?” Dean asked, trying to keep the tremor out of his voice.
Never one to back down from a challenge, Dean planted his heels, grabbed Benny’s thighs, and thrust, once, twice, bucking Benny like the bronco he imagined he was. Man held on tight, Dean gave him that, pushing his feet under Dean’s ass to give himself more leverage. Dean grabbed his neck, hauling him down for a rough kiss, all tongue and teeth. Benny groaned into his mouth as Dean nailed his prostate over and over.
Cas noticed it too and, with not a little effort, pulled his fingers from Dean’s ass. Air wafted across his gaping hole, sending a surprising cold chill running down his sweat-soaked spine.
“Oh yes,” Cas replied, “it was the closest I could get to matching your eyes. Although, nothing really could match their beauty.”
Dean looked up to see that Cas had moved his full-length mirror from the far corner of the room to right smack dab in front of Dean. How had he forgotten he’d had that ancient thing? It was tilted now so that Dean had a perfect view of himself, just like Cas wanted. If you had asked him before, Dean would have said he’d pay good money not to see himself looking so debauched. Part of the fun, he’d always felt, was getting out of his own head. A mirror seemed counterintuitive to that goal. But now he could see every bead of sweat, every contortion of his face, every bunch of his muscles. And he fucking loved it. Every bit of self-consciousness he thought he’d feel flew out of the window as he looked upon what Cas had done to him. Cas was right. He could admit it, at least to himself. He was fucking beautiful.
He leaned into her, bracing himself against the cradle of her hips, and rocked in and out. He could feel Cas’ balls underneath his, the light friction bringing sweat to the small of his back. The pressure made Anna feel incredibly tight around him and after the intense blowjob Meg had given him earlier, he didn’t feel like he would last long, Cas’ edging advice be damned.
Dean blinked. “Camera?”
Benny let loose first, shooting his release across Dean’s cheek, letting it drip down his jaw and onto his collar bone. He was followed shortly by Gabriel, on his right side, who shot warm ropes across his nose and lips. Sam’s hand in his hair tightened as he came next, thick globs landing on his chin and running down the contours of his lips. Cas lasted a few seconds longer before squirting straight into Dean’s open mouth. When he was done, Dean smacked his lips, savoring the salty flavor.
“Hey, brother, you keeping the new guy all to yourself or can anyone get in on this?” Dean turned at the southern accent to see the brawny guy with the ten o’clock shadow.
At last, he moved in, guiding his massive cock inside Benny beside Dean’s. God, the pressure. Benny practically melted on Dean, a heap of sweat and hair. Sam hunched over Benny, taking over the rhythm from Dean, moving them both with his deep thrusts.
“Sexual intercourse, Dean.”
“Yes, I said I love you. Because I did”, Castiel snaps at him and finally looks into Deans face. “Because I do. I love you, Dean! And I can’t take it back, no matter how uncomfortable it makes you!”
Their cum is smudged on both their chests, where it’s slowly drying, but neither is attempting to clean up the mess. The air feels heavy, the unmistakable smell of sex surrounding them. In the back of his mind, Dean suspects he should start worrying. He and his best friend just had sex, which was mindblowing by the way. But Cas is smiling at him, a post-orgasm haze still in those blue eyes, and Dean can’t help but enjoy the moment.
It fucking hurts. It’s like he got stabbed in the heart by a rusty nail. Tears start forming in Dean’s eyes, and he pulls Elliot in another kiss to hide them. But they are still there, wetting both their faces as they kiss.
The key turns in the door, as Dean shakes his head. He knows Cas is lying. They wouldn’t find anyone else tonight, and they have to open the portal first thing in the morning. If they don’t screw each other, they are screwed.
“Huh”
“Cancer?”, he asks.
“Please fuck me tonight”
“She sure does,” Dean chimes and steps closer, but stops once the shorter man turns to him.
The Croatan virus took everything from them; now all Dean and Cas have left is each other.
Dean’s hands shake when he slips the ring onto Castiel’s finger. It’s only now that he realizes they only got one ring, but before Dean can freak out, the angel pulls another golden band from his pocket.
Dean’s brain stopped working a while ago, and he takes out Ty’s hard dick without hesitation, before sliding onto his knees. Dean Winchester faced monsters, demons, angels, and gods, and yet he’s never been as intimidated as he is at this moment. He has no idea what he is doing, but he starts with a confident lick along the length.
He also knows Cas’s vessel is very attractive. But those two things – his attraction to men and his profound bond with Cas – were never something he considered might be related. But thinking about Cas kissing him – it’s something Dean never knew he wanted that much. When the sight of the happy couple got too much for him to bear, Dean excused himself to get a drink. Only then he remembered they are actually on a job, and he’s supposed to be on the watch out for possible bad guys.
“That’s bullshit."
Sam | 12:40am (October 21st, 2019): Just weird that you let me borrow the Impala and then disappear for hours without even texting to make sure I haven’t spilled anything on her seat or left fingerprints on the dash, that’s all. Where are you?
Dean tilted his head back to stare at the orange sky and bit back a groan. “It means kissing, Cas.”
“Hell yes, we did,” Dean chuckled as he pulled pants over his damp legs. “I suppose we could try to take a real bath this time?”
like you, and I don't know what you're talking about. Go, before I change my mind and turn you over to the host. They have a kill order out for you and—"
Not wanting to come yet, it was a relief when Dean stopped, and crawled up Cas’ body, stopping to capture his lips again, his mouth tasting sweet, his lips slick and swollen a bit. Against Cas’ exposed cock, Dean’s had grown and hardened in his scrubs, revealing a cock that was thick and heavy. When Dean’s lips dragged across Cas’ jawline and trailed down his neck, he kissed him just at the base of his neck where his shoulder and collarbone intersected, dragging his tongue over the crevice there. Castiel tried to stay quiet through the amazing, almost porn-like blowjob, but the swipe of hot, eager tongue across that spot on his neck made Castiel turn his head quickly and muffle a gasp into Dean’s hair.
Much to his pleasure, Dean folded forward a bit, his face close, his charming grin in between pouty, full lips mere inches away. Louder, he asked, “I’m getting from your face earlier that I fucked up your name.”
“Cool, thanks,” Dean said with a wink and a crooked smile.
Dean snorted. “Good. ‘cause that’s your shtick, bud.”
“Breathe,” Dean murmured, fingers massaging Cas’ neck, his fingers sliding up and down into Cas’ hair at the nape of his neck. “Don’t hold your breath, Cas. It won’t help you relax.”
“I was busy,” she replied shortly. “I
It was only when Castiel reached over with his other hand and ran his thumb over Dean’s wrist that the clenching of Dean’s jaw slackened and he released the smallest hitched breath that preceded two tears that rolled out from under the sunglasses.
Dean waved his hands in the air, panic fluttering in his stomach. “Oh! No, no, no. Nothing like that. Charlie is fantastic. She’s just very interested in putting on this play and...I love theatre, you see.”
A shy little smile curled on Cas’ lips, his tired blue eyes widening happily for a moment. They hadn’t kissed since that moment in the dark last week. Thankfully, Cas appeared to definitely be a little gay, which was a win for Dean. He’d been worried Cas was just a really touchy guy and he’d been reading the signs wrong, but after their kisses the other night, Cas definitely enjoyed some stubble-on-stubble action. The kiss Cas had initiated had been so casual, so gently and lofty, that Dean felt a little drunk on it, his mind having had wandered during it, imagining those lips dragging over other parts of his body too—
“Mugger got struck by lightning!” Chuck exclaimed thickly, throwing his hands up to the side. “One minute he was telling me to give him the ‘green music thing’, which I had no plans of fuckin’ giving to him, because hello, I’m a poor writer and that tiny piece of genius-shit was two-hundred-and-fifty bucks! Next minute?” Chuck said, sounding a bit hysterical, scratching at his head furiously. “Next minute, this asshole pulls a gun on me! A real life gun! Before I could even properly shit my pants, a bolt of lightning came down and smoked him!”
“Dunno if a bubble bath and Charlie’s chamomile is gonna help me much, while the love of my life is off somewhere having sex with a man I despise in every single way. Unless there’s mary-jane in the chamomile, then I dunno if your advice is useful at all.”
Dean felt sicker, suddenly losing his entire appetite. Fuck Zeke for bringing that up.
Dean,” Sam said, appalled. “You’re a human, not an animal.”
“What the fuck are you doing?” Dean snarled, kicking out at the creature as its short and stubby bland heels clicked past them, though out of reach. Still, it made him feel better to kick.
She wanted to dance.
,” and he shuffled forward, closer to his dance partner, who swallowed visibly and slid his hands over Castiel’s waist.
, Castiel. I’m talking about Dean.” Naomi yanked her phone from her purse and waved her hand wildly. “I’m talking about love-them-and-leave them
Castiel found that kind of porn distasteful anyway, there was no way he was going to find it attractive in real life. Turns out, in practice, no one found that attractive or sexy in real life.
Castiel caressed his cheek and smiled. “You are too kind, Zachariah. The stress of re-writing the ending may have been catastrophic to the story. You truly have our best interests at heart.”
Castiel’s stared at his face with a peculiar expression. Her eyebrows were furrowed.
“Cas,” Dean mumbled against the pillow, eyes still closed, “go to sleep, Gracie’s fine.”
“It’s not your role to question, Dean,” she replied sharply, eyes lacking the softness she’d had with Sam. “It is your role to follow, to take orders. We have work for you two, especially you,” she added, looking over to Sam, whose eyes were wide.
Strangely, by the look of it, their government had been preparing for this for a while, too. It was all happening too fast, it was all too organized. Castiel suspected they’d known about the virus landing here for a while.
The snakes that coiled in his stomach untwisted and he instantly felt lighter, feeling a hope he'd regret soon enough. If she found a way, it meant she'd been looking. If she, an angel, had found a way to rid him of this stain on his soul, maybe it meant he could be pure…
On the car ride back to the Roadhouse, Sam told Dean all about his life.
Dean could throw up; he felt his stomach turn with guilt, simultaneously feeling heavy. His chin scrunched a bit and he pulled his eyes away from Uriel to quickly glance at Cas, who was watching him intensely. With a shaking inhale, he looked over at Anna, whose face melted into realization, and Sam, who looked shocked.
“Obviously!” Dean cried out, his patience snapping. He did
“I guess,” Dean said, feeling sick.
do you feel right now, Dean Winchester?” she challenged, her voice rough.
Dean froze, half under the bed, and half exposed. He winced, hoping he hadn’t been spotted. Slowly, he propped himself up onto his elbows and looked over his shoulder. Castiel had the Duke turned away, twisting his torso towards her with one hand on his arm, awkwardly smiling and twisting her hair around her finger.
As soon as the glass shattered at the feet of a couple of angels did Dean realize that the contents must’ve been holy oil, because the angels caught in the explosion shrieked and Dean watched them burn, their bodies seeming to burst in a flash of blinding light. The second Dean could look up again, a few angels were retreating, disappearing in clouds of white smoke, and the masked group was piling into cars, a few of them rushing forward to gather the wounded.
Instead of answering, Sam made a top-notch bitch-face and jutted his finger at the waitress. “Go talk to her.”
The angel nodded.
With a few sharp inhales through her nose, with her lips pressed together, her chin trembling, Castiel shook her head.
In the house, Dean watched angels gather in rooms all around. The house was bustling with activity. A few angels arrived on the main floor from what seemed to be a basement, carrying baskets of laundry, while others gathered in what seemed to be a living room, piled on couches, tending to wounds with bandages and first-aid kits. In a room to the left, what looked to be a dining room at one point, there were cots set up and one vaguely familiar blond woman was bustling around, tending to the injured.
They stared at the door, jumping every time the demons pounded on it.
“So I shouldn’t tell your father about your Lucifer shirt?”
Time was ticking, so he got out of the car and walked around, shuddering against the chill of the night. At the trunk, he swallowed hard, pulling the demon blade that Sam had given him after he’d risen, the one that used to belong to Ruby. It was supposed to be able to kill any demons... He hoped it could kill Lilith.
The silent, dark room filled with the sound of a zipper being tugged down and Castiel knew exactly what Uriel thought.
“You are pure, Cas,” Dean murmured. “Nothing they did to you can change how good you are, okay? I...I—God, I just want to touch you, to m-make you feel okay, but I won’t force myself on you, not like these fucking monsters. Even though this universe makes me feel like you’re mine…”
“Stop going wherever you’re going, idiot, or we’ll shoot you where you stan—Oh, ew.”
“Yeah. Why wouldn’t the angel choose Zion?” Meg questioned, leaning in towards the Duke, her words slow and deliberate. “Why would the angel choose to fall for some writer—” Meg snorted, pressing her fingertips to her dark lips. “Oops. I mean a hunter.”
Castiel’s heart was in his throat. He didn’t dare move, frightened that the moment would end if he did. In a whisper, he asked, “So you’re not angry?”
“I’m sorry,” Sam interrupted, waving a hand. “I’m not
human about you. At least not completely.”
Later, he’d regret asking.
Dean’s heart dropped. He felt a discomfort in his stomach that made his insides go cold, and he looked up in time to see Sam retreat from the washroom, a grave look on his face.
With his heart in his throat, Castiel whispered, “I haven’t ever...received.”
It was Castiel’s turn to nod, and this time when she tried to sit up, she found she had strength to, though her head still pounded. Everything was much clearer and her tongue didn’t feel like it was swollen in her mouth.
"Yeah," Dean nodded, watching her face try to hide the real emotion behind her anger. "He was an ass. Karma is gonna get him one day. You didn't deserve to be cuffed, they took it too far."
“I want it, Dean.”
“I’m not,” Cas replied quickly, his mouth pressing into a thin line as he seemed to gather his bearings. He glanced down at his plate, then looked back up at Dean. “Something’s wrong with me. They came to my cell yesterday morning and took some blood. They said my virility has taken a dive. They made me drink some really disgusting concoction. It made me pretty sick all night yesterday, but they said they’re going to test me again today to see if it helped. If not…”
Sam smiled wryly. “Hence why we find ourselves in New York. I’m hoping I’ll have better luck here. I understand there’s somewhat of an acting scene around here.”
They shuffled up as the man at the counter left.
She watched the little girl blush and skip off, disappearing back under the catwalk through the trap door. Castiel turned back to Balthazar, getting in position for the reveal again. Balthazar did the same, allowing her to rest her elbow on his shoulder. His arm snaked around her waist.
Shit. Dean wasn’t sure if they were ready to find out yet about Chuck and his stories, and how nothing in existence was real. The angels would have a meltdown. Or they’d shoot Dean and Sam where they sat.
“So Uriel and Cas?” Dean inquired. “Those angels from before; you know them or you guys fought in different garrisons?”
!” The Duke gestured angrily to Sam and Cas with a snap of his arm and a trembling finger. “A broken, aimless, hapless hunter with unending emotional baggage and nothing astounding to offer her!?”
“No, I don’t fucking remember,” he replied instead. His face twisted and he jutted his finger at it. “Get out of Pam, you creepy son of a bitch. You can’t just possess people whenever you want!”
Sam smiled at Dean all watery and Dean was tempted to launch a carrot between his eyes, too.
Cas slept, too, curled up on the lumpy, dusty couch.
He worshiped Dean’s throat and collarbone, shuddering under the gentle curls and whorls Dean drew into the skin on the back of his arms and down his shoulder blades with the soft pads of his fingers. Quickly, they were both breathing hard, the air warm between them from their panting and elevated body temperature. Dean’s hand was down Castiel’s boxer-briefs, his palm smooth against the silky skin of Castiel’s full cock, his fingertips rolling his balls, and they were staring at each other, momentarily suspended in their lust and attraction.
“You...work?” Dean blinked, remembering Cas (“Steve”) in his blue Gas n’ Sip vest, and nearly laughing at the idea of this universe’s Castiel selling beef jerky to commuters with a bulletproof vest on.
“I stole her from Jody,” Hannah panted, interrupting the little girl, who didn’t seem to care and all but had stars in her eyes. “I said I’d take her to get a better seat, to watch from backstage. We don’t have much time!”
“We don’t have to...talk right now,” Castiel said, sounding a bit breathless. His eyes widened and Dean saw him roll his fingers into fists, his thumb kneading into the side of his knuckles. “We can do something else. Anything you want.”
“It’s past midnight, everywhere is closed,” Castiel said quickly, blinking.
“I don’t know if I’m sure,” Dean whispered faintly, his face draining. “I-I don’t know. I—Cas—Cas,
“Don’t worry about her; she’s fine.”
The sole of Gadreel’s foot thumped against Hannah’s back as he pushed her roughly to the ground.
Cas’ place was a fourteen minute drive away.
Tilting their heads back, they finished off their drinks at the same time, chuckling around mouths full of beer. When Castiel had choked his down completely and wiped at his mouth, he allowed Dean to pull the empty bottle from his fingers, wrapping his fist around the cool, wet replacement Dean slid in its stead.
No. No, crap. That just made it worse.
“Fuck,” he growled, then turned on his heel and ran. His boots thundered up the steps and he slid onto the landing. In his duffle upstairs he had iron, salt, and the whole nine yards. If he could just make it there—
Uriel looked like Christmas had come early, grinning and leaning on the doorframe. “Aw, look at that, the girls are reunited.”
“For a little while,” she murmured as their heads hit the pillows and Cas kissed away any doubts he had that she would leave him.
The whole barn shook.
Dean Winchester had jump-started the apocalypse. He’d jump-started it all on his own, because he was dark, and fucked up. He’d jump-started it because he was weak.
This time, when they yanked him onto his feet painfully by his arms, Dean didn’t fight back. He put one foot in front of the other in the direction they led him.
Dean leaned against the wall and lowered his pants. He shut his eyes and used his imagination instead, imagining Cassie, his ex. Or better yet, Cassie and Xander, the waiter from the local diner who served Dean and Benny breakfast every Sunday morning. He imagined Cassie and Xander together, around him, touching and licking. He recalled Brad’s big brown eyes, and gnawed on his lips, imaging Brad looking up at him, his lips rosy around his c—
“Castiel,” Amelia said softly, reaching over and sliding her hand over Dean’s—when had he put that there? Leaning on the surface heavily, for balance.
With a nod, Sam swept around the counter, towards the mess of glass still scattered across the war-room floor.
“I died because of you,” she murmured.
Castiel also reminded him four times that they were ‘not making love’, she’d left four pairs of underwear behind in Dean’s apartment, and she’d gone on seven more dinners with the Duke.
Steve was forgotten about by the time she got home, heels kicked across the worn carpet in her foyer—well, less of a foyer and more a tiny, narrow hallway where she piled shoes and her cat hoarded toys.
“Well—” Dean went on, his eyes glancing around the empty store before he dropped his gaze again to look at their joined hands. His pointer finger dragged over each of Castiel’s knuckles, leaving his skin buzzing delightfully. “Everyone kinda left the room and Lee and I ended up hanging in the bathroom like responsible thirty-year-olds. I don’t really know what happened, but one second we were killing ourselves laughing about Charlie’s ex Dorothy buying a dog named Toto, and the next second, I was kissing him. My best fucking friend.”
Castiel paused, ceasing the scrubbing of his carpet, staring down at the sudsy patch where Jack had thrown up something that looked suspiciously like nougat and toilet paper. “I have no interest in millennials on acid.”
“So what’s your plan there, angel girl?” Bobby grumbled, leaning his cheek against the top of Pam’s head as she rested it on his shoulder with a sigh. “I’m good with you staying with me for a short period of time, but you can’t stay forever.”
“Clothing for tonight, courtesy of Charlie.”
“Andi,” Dean corrected, pointing at the kid and picking up his orange juice. The glass hovered in front of his face, and then he added, “Well, nice to meet you...again.”
Cas lowered her eyes, picking at a rip in the knee of her jeans. Her tongue darted out to swipe over her lips.
“I understand Sam decided to stay a bit longer,” Castiel interrupted—’cold as ice’ as Uriel would say. “Say goodbye to him for me. And goodbye to Hannah, too, since she’s decided to stay with him for now.”
Sleep closed in on his mind and dragged him into quick nightmares about Daphne weeping, kneeled on the bed, begging him for forgiveness. He looked down at his body and realised he was in scrubs. The material was soaked in dark red, blood streaking down the inside of his pants. He pressed a hand between his legs and felt nothing but a gaping hole. Daphne suddenly began cackling, holding a bloody razor in the air.
She nodded and looked back at the scene, just in time to catch the Duke’s gaze slide back towards her.
...suppressants. Birth control.
“Oh, please!” Kevin groused, yelling over the music. “We all hang out in Charlie’s apartment on the weekends, and we haven’t seen you in weeks! You’re always ‘writing’, and listen, I dunno much about writing and the creative process, but I don’t think bumping uglies with the lead actress helps the creative process flow—”
SO? What'd you guys think? Stuff is ramping up... Let me know your thoughts in the comments, I love to hear from y'all!
Naomi tilted her head and smiled sadly. “Yeah. Exactly.”
Situated quickly at the bar, watching Ellen slide behind the counter and begin to mix cocktails, Dean watched as angels filed into the room over a period of fifteen minutes. They all chatting excitedly and were significantly dressed down than he’d previously seen them. It was amazing to watch the facade drop away. Erotic, sensual dancers and eccentric performers turned into giddy girls and boys, sultry smiles evaporating and leaving animated, beaming faces.
“Sam will come to see you,” Dean urged. “He’s just...still angry, y’know?”
Reaching into his back pocket, Castiel tugged out a small box he’d been carrying all day. Flipping it open with one hand, he lowered himself onto his knee, gleeful at the chorus of shocked shrieks and roars from their friends that was almost louder than the singing crowd around them.
“Demon blood?” Dean said, aghast. “You want me to drink demon blood? After everything we’ve done, after—”
“I can’t believe it’s come to this,” Castiel whispered, staring out over the water. Down her cheek, she felt a warm track left behind by a rogue tear.
Castiel decided.
When they opened their eyes again, they stood at the end of a hallway, two corridors on either side. The walls and floors were made of marble, and Dean thought it might’ve looked quite exquisite at one time, but the lights flickered and at the end of one hallway, it was nearly pitch black. Heaven was struggling.
“You don’t understand.” Castiel shook his head, hiccuping and pausing to release a singular wheezing sob before he whispered, “It’s not returned, Cupid. The match is broken; something went wrong.”
Sam pulled back with a wobbly, tearful grin, which Dean returned happily.
“Yeah, I know what a cousin is, Cas.”
“Bingo.”
As the door swung shut behind her, Dean turned on his heel and walked back to the table, a scowl etched on his lips.
He hadn’t decided yet; he’d have to do some research first.
Dean ignored his brother, dismissing him with a little stiff wave of his hand. He maneuvered through the tables, pausing to let people pass him, and slinking past a few couples that made their love known aggressively. Pausing at the doorway to the balcony, Dean suffered a moment of uncertainty, watching Castiel lean on the thick stone barrier as she listened to Balthazar speak to her. Bravery leaving him, Dean ducked out of sight, though he could hear their conversation clearly from this side of the room, far from the music player that played a jaunty, jazzy tune.
love.”
“Probably,” Castiel murmured, eyes glittering.
The green eyes softened and got a bit shiny, but not with tears this time. Dean stared at him, and Castiel shifted uncomfortably, waiting for the blow.
“How’s the store?”
The second angel beside Azrael named Fezrasil, an alpha who used to coordinate cupids back in the less problematic days of Heaven, scowled.
Drawn to her, he kissed back, dragging his fingers through Castiel’s hair, tugging a bit on the strands as her raspy moan vibrated his lips. Their tongues brushed one more time, and then she pulled away, her lips shining.
a free spirit. You’re wound up tight like a corset.”
Also, he saw the word ‘panties’ and was sold. He was thirty-minutes from a Victoria’s Secret and was planning on plastering lacy underwear all over Dean’s room. Hmmm, or maybe replacing all his boxers with thongs?
Dean opened the door for them and stepped away, moving back towards Cas, who looked lost in the middle of the room, her hand rubbing at her head.
“You’re Dean,” Anna said, wincing. “You’re...supposed to be an abomination. That’s what the angels say, but...you saved me.”
“You’ve done this before,” Castiel murmured.
John rolled his eyes and scowled, relaxing back in his seat. “I ain’t worried about no dog. But it’s Heaven, and I’m willing to try having a dog in the house. God knows you fuckin’ begged for years when you were just a tyke.” John paused, raising a finger warningly. “No dogs on the furniture, you hear me? The second that mutt jumps on my bed, I’m launching it into space.”
Sliding his gun back the inch it’d been retracted, Dean hissed, “You’re a piece of work, buddy,” to the shopkeep and followed Cas.
“Be right back,” Dean muttered absentmindedly, sliding off his stool.
“Yes!” the demon laughed, the simpering, high pitched sound echoing around the church. “Run, Sam. Run, Ruby. Run, my favoured pupil. I do
Liar. Lying liar who lied!
With her stomach feeling as if it was sinking inside her, settling somewhere behind her navel, she walked forward, ascending the stone steps of the church. She didn’t wish to have to wield her weapons either, but had a feeling, if what Anna suspected was true, that her relationship with Uriel and Zachariah was going to take a violent turn.
Maybe Dean didn’t mind the shadow of stubble, because he was eyeing Castiel’s face with a pleased twinkle. “Nah.”
“She’s just finishing up inside,” Uriel explained. “There were demons preparing the altar for Lilith’s summoning ritual tonight. We had to take them out before bringing you in.”
For a few minutes, he sat alone. Then, he felt a puff of warm air that was a welcome relief from the cold sting of night, and he looked up, pleased to see Cas standing in the middle of the backyard.
“He’s around here somewhere,” Jimmy said suddenly, his eyes softening at the corners. Dean noticed the crow’s feet weren’t as deep; Jimmy looked as young as the day he died.
“He’s safer that way. They all are.”
Sam said.
Castiel, who looked ready to storm off, sucked in a sharp breath and she looked like she would scold him for calling her a pet name, but instead, she said, “You want to fuck me.”
She peered a them through the tiny grate, eyes narrowing. “I can see you two huddling together up on that bed. If I recall, I did warn you that—”
“Get away from me,” she said clearly, turning and yanking on the door handle. Dean had to step away from the door to avoid being knocked out by it.
kept playing, and the lights changed to green and blue as the song reached a crescendo. They danced and ground against each other, never stopping to break the kiss.
box of shoes on top of the one you’re lookin’ for, it’s spilly and they’ll hurt on the way down towards your face’, but no, you had to be all cryptic as usual.”
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s legs. Dean grinned and curled forward, hugging Cas’ top half tightly, kissing the side of his head. When Cas moaned happily, Dean felt the rumble in his chest, and wondered if Cas knew how badly Dean had it for him. His heart beat quickly.
“What’re you doing here?” Castiel demanded from her.
When he’d first sent her away from the bunker, he’d been better at rationalizing that he’d done the right thing as Zeke carried on healing Sam. But as the months passed, Castiel’s voicemail changed from ‘make your voice a mail’ to the dull, dead dial tone that felt very much like his number had been blocked. His ‘I’ll look for her later’ turned into a desperate, immediate need to find her, especially as Sam grew stronger and time passed. On top of his own desire to make sure she was okay, to talk to her, to be close to her, Sam had begun asking more questions, more pointed, needling questions about Cas’ departure. Sam was confused, Sam was kind of hurt. Cas hadn’t even said goodbye to him, she’d just left.
A group of men walked by, howling with laughter at some joke or another, and Dean let his hand drop, turning back to the railing, licking at his lips and glancing between the group and Castiel’s face. “Yeah. Coupla years, maybe a bit less. You?”
Walking out into the living room and through an open doorway to the kitchen, Castiel looked around. On an opened futon bed in the living room, he noticed what were presumably Sam's suitcases opened on top of a mess of rumpled sheets. Near the head of the bed, he also noticed Hannah's train case and her backpack. Castiel imagined that this couch was the handsome companion to the sofa in the Winchesters’ family music shop. On the other side of a woven rug atop hardwood flooring was a matching armchair with bulky, pilled quilts slung over the back. Like Castiel, Dean had many books and DVDs, though his were all over the place: piled on a wicker coffee table, on the console under the TV, and on the sill under his large bay window.
“You all scared of her?” Dean asked, still watching Castiel, his stomach turning uncomfortably as he noticed the woman talking pointedly to Cas, who was watching Naomi’s face with wide eyes, nodding slowly.
“‘Kay, that was weeks ago now, and you can’t keep using that excuse whenever you want me to do something for you.”
He pressed his lips together hard and grunted deep in his throat as his knees hit the ground hard. He saw two sets of black boots join Naomi’s on either side and he could practically feel the guns being pointed at him from somewhere above.
“He needed to die,” Castiel said. He was horrified at how steady his voice was. “His presence alone was making people sick. It was killing them.”
On the opposite side of the clearing, Castiel ran hard, circling around the brawl and he jumped, pushing off a tree with his foot to get some air before he kicked the back of Uriel’s head hard enough to send the angel stumbling forward into the mud, his blade rolling into the snow.
“He hates me because of this prophecy, Bobby. He hates that I’ve been chosen for something and he wasn’t. He hates the angels, doesn’t trust them, doesn’t trust their mission for me. I think...I dunno, sometimes I think he’s jealous, but lately I think he just doesn’t like the prophecy because
“More angel bloodshed,” Zachariah snarled, pointing down at the boy’s corpse like it was Castiel’s fault. “More blood on
darling. It’s business. In the long run, this will be worth it. We’ll make a better name for ourselves. We’ll be converted into a theatre house. Perhaps we can stop offering erotic services. My girl, wouldn’t you like to focus on your acting, to stop taking patrons to bed? He’s got his sights set on you, Castiel. He’s offered to make you a real star, a real actress. He’ll invest in you if you give yourself to him. You might never have to sleep with another man or woman for money ever again!”
Looking pained, her mouth opened for a moment, then she pushed on and admitted, “I figured. What you’re dealing with is a Zchitri.”
“I missed you so much,” Jamie wept, shaking her head against his neck. “I missed—”
Jack replied by snapping at Dean’s fingers excitedly, but gnawed gently on his thumb when Dean scratched under his ears.
Ms. Tathum exhaled heavily, looking flustered. “Eva, this isn’t a good time. FBI man doesn’t want your valentine; he’s working right now.”
“Oh, jeeze, I wonder who,” Bobby mumbled, glancing at Dean, who was trying to catch his breath, but was basically just managing to catch loud gulps in his throat instead. “What stage you at?”
Dean captured her lips in his, a small moan escaping his throat. She also found herself involuntarily whimpering as his lips slotted against hers perfectly, his teeth gently pulling at her bottom lip playfully for a moment before his kiss regained air of passion.
The two angels stared at each other, breathing hard.
With their weapons ready, Dean led them out into the hallway, turning sharply towards the sound of fighting. When he saw the fight, Dean’s face went cold, blood draining from his cheeks.
“He doesn’t remember that, Castiel.”
Dean had prayed in his life. He seldom admitted it to anyone, least of all Sam, until recently. The surprised jump of Sam’s eyebrows had been the reason he didn’t tell anyone. For a dude who rejected angels and despised religion for the most part, Dean had certainly done his fair share of desperate praying.
So he didn’t. Castiel was quiet, only moving to run his hand up Dean’s side, stroking his flank comfortingly, the pressure light. He let the silence linger, although normally silences made him uncomfortable. Thankfully, Dean raised his head soon after and looked over his shoulder, smiling tightly.
“I’m so tired,” Cas went on, exhaling heavily, shaking his head against Dean’s face, their cheeks brushing. “I’ve grown tired of this
“This works,” Castiel said, trying to sound neutral.
But apparently, the hurt was insurmountable this time. For the first time, as he told Uriel, he was unafraid.
Of course one of the sexiest songs of all time would come on when an actual Adonis was dancing with him.
There was a moment of silence, and then Castiel spoke, not realising how hurt he was until he uttered the words, “And yet you held me down.”
Dean buried his face in Cas’ neck, exhaling heavily. “When I used to imagine an apple pie life for myself, I’d forgotten to include the parts where babies are cesspools of disease.”
Sam leaned over everyone, causing Hannah to squeal as he man-handled her out of the way. His drunk finger shaking, Sam slurred, “Listen, you two keep it down tonight, I gotta sleep.”
On the topic of trusting her doubts, Castiel swallowed. Then, lowly, she replied, “Yes.”
Castiel’s mouth dropped open and she stared at him through wide eyes. “You were going to bring your brother?”
“No,” Dean murmured, lowering his glass. “You won’t get released.”
“No!” Castiel yelled back, still swaying to the music because dear God, he needed to do something to not look like a confused idiot. “No, I-It didn’t hurt...though, actually, I imagine it might.”
“They’re working on it. Apparently, they can’t risk exposure. Not until it’s time.” Sam inhaled deeply, releasing the breath slowly afterwards. “The information they’re leaking is invaluable, Dean. They’re saying the government knew the virus would spread in the States. They even think the virus might’ve been purposefully leaked.”
Rachel, Cas’ old lieutenant.
Everyone else seemed to be at the same point too, finishing up and winding down. The stress levels in the room were high, but the relief was palpable too. The workers cleaned up their prisoners and gave them matching red pills. In sync, they kneeled down and undid the ankle restraints, then the arm restraints.
To his horror, she had picked up a book from the ledge behind his bed and turned it in her hands. Dean didn’t react fast enough. The big book dropped open and his latest issue of Busty Asian Beauties flopped open in the middle. Dean froze as the centerfold stared up at Cas.
Balthazar swept across the stage, welcoming the guests, capturing everyone’s attention with his whimsical speech. He teased and mocked like he had the first night Dean had attended, swinging around a bejeweled cane that he didn’t need for walking. He poked patrons in the chest as he introduced the show, reminding his “naughty, nasty, needy” patrons that if they wanted a taste of Heaven, angels were attracted to shiny things.
“I feel you,” the other man said, looking distant in his eyes for a moment before his hand tightened around the railing of Cas’ bunk and he drummed his finger against the metal. “It takes a few days to stop feeling sick to your stomach. Ain’t no way around it; this situation is fucked.”
Cas’ gaze fell back on Dean’s and as usual, the weight of the world seemed to rest heavily in the stare. Although for the first time, it wasn’t the weight of the entire world, but a new one they were forging entirely on their own.
Everyone bristled and Sam’s jaw dropped. He and Ruby exchanged looks, and Sam pushed off the wall, saying, “You think they’ve thrown a Heavenly GPS on her?”
Sam paused. “Uh, bless you?”
“No,” he moaned. “No, no, no, no…”
you said?”
“You’re not the only one unable to stomach Bud Light, Uriel,” Naomi snapped, her brows knitting together in a scowl as she shifted her weight onto her hip and crossed her arms over her chest. The top of her wine bottle popped out of the side of her backpack as if to say, ‘yuck, beer!’
“No,” Castiel said firmly, scowling at Dean. “We did not simply mate with any angel who had a decent knot, Dean.”

Weeks he’d been locked in this white room with the coverless white bed and white basin that he could be sick in, and that one meaningful steel table tucked into the corner with leg stirrups that made him nauseous just looking at. The flat steel was clean and sterile, but the legs of the table had splotches of deep, dried burgundy-brown that made Castiel feel like they’d left it like that on purpose. They wanted to breed fear in him, they wanted to hint at the horrific pain that was to come, or perhaps at the fate of others who’d they tried to breed with.
“Yeah! The new nano. It has a camera in it, and a pedometer, and you can shake it to change the song! Mine was in a really cool green.”
“And if Sam knew—” Dean dragged in a harsh breath and sniffled, before he breathed out through a pinhole made by his lips. “If Sam
“The greater good for who?” Anna spat, her eyes narrowing. “For the angels? For the winged babies who threw a tantrum because their father left? Did you think his sandbox was yours, too, yours to destroy?”
His heart slammed into his chest as Cas grinned at him in the mirror, the silly expression on her face making Dean’s knees feel weak.
Jamie raised her hands. “I know, I—”
There was no way the government hadn’t known the virus would hit. There was no way they hadn’t been prepared.
Shame was a secondary emotion, Dean realised.
She shook her head. “No, thank you. I have to be going soon. I have to drop Leia off at her babysitter and--”
