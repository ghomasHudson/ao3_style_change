"I understand that you liked it," said Castiel, smiling proudly at the man. After a while he took a seat next to him. To his surprise, Dean bit his lower lip and did something unexpected. He hugged him. "You liked it. I got it."
Dean has been working exceptionally hard lately. Castiel often received calls from him in the middle of the night that he had to stay longer at work because of the investigation. He hated sleeping in an empty bed and feeling cold, but he understood how important his job was. Sometimes he stared into space and laughed at himself. Castiel fed doughnuts to the President of the United States of America, and Dean made sure his country remained lawful and the criminals were always punished. Their professions had absolutely nothing in common, and neither did their characters, yet they meshed with each other in this whole mess. They were soul mates. And after five years of marriage, and seven of being together, not even the unbelieving Dean would dare deny it.
lived in a two-story apartment in downtown Washington. They were no different from their neighbors. Castiel worked in a pastry shop that, among other things, was famous for having its baked goods delivered straight to the white house. Every Thursday and Tuesday, he personally transported dozens of baked goods, which he prepared with his co-workers, Fergus, Anna, and Hannah, starting at four in the morning. The pastry shop was Castiel's pride. It was as if it were yesterday he remembered when he opened the place at the age of twenty-three. Debt-ridden and desperate, he spent the next year grasping at every opportunity that came his way, but it had paid off. By now Castiel was thirty-six years old, had a sixteen-year-old daughter named Claire, a picture with the president, and the greatest husband in the whole world.
Castiel had been driving home for nearly half an hour. As usual, the streets were crowded, and the snow that covered them didn't make anything easier. During the ride back, Castiel repeatedly buried his head in his hands and sent Dean eight messages in which he wrote the question, 'can I kill myself?'. Unfortunately, Dean didn't think it was the brightest idea in the world. By tapping out a short but firm 'no,' he let his partner know that he needed to get home with his head unshot. When he finally arrived, complaints about the decision he'd made were replaced by hellos.
Even though his family hadn't decided to have karaoke at six in the morning that day, he realized something was wrong. As much as he didn't want to, Castiel opened his tired eyes, then rubbed them with the palm of his hand and sat down on the bed. The clock on the bedside table read ten o'clock. That gave him a full twelve hours of sleep. One could say that it was his personal record. Lately, he had no time for the comfort called sleep. Everyone noticed this. More than once Dean would take his tired face in his hands and tell him in a tender voice that he needed to take care of himself. Running a pastry shop or not, for his own health he should start sleeping more.
"I can see that someone likes it," said Castiel, then he blew cold air on his partner's exposed skin, creating goosebumps. "Do you want more?"
Dean and Castiel immediately ruled out continuing their conversation about Ruby. The men contacted each other with that familiar look that expressed more than it should. Claire noticed it as well. The girl mentally sighed, knowing what awaited her now. Another lecture. Although she loved her parents, she found them definitely overprotective as well as annoying. Sometimes she just had enough of them.
"Claire..." Castiel sighed heavily. "Don't do anything stupid. That's all I'm asking you to do."
"Teenage girl," Dean replied, straining for mischief in his voice. They had done this many times before and it didn't look like they were going to stop anytime soon.
"The usual."  He shrugged. "I spent the whole morning doing paperwork because nobody else wanted to, and then I got acquainted with a new case. By the way: one of Claire's colleagues got to us. He's suspected of murder."
His nickname. The one that reminded him of the day they met. Dean thought back to that autumn evening more than once. Dean was just coming back from work from himself. The freshly minted FBI agent was sick of the position. He hated the fact that everyone pushed him around. They called him "Ken" because of his flawless beauty, and while he was trying to focus on his duties, there was always someone who wanted to force him to go to the candy store. And that's what happened this time. A man named Garth forced him to run three blocks in the rain, only to encounter a "closed" sign on the door of the FBI's favorite pastry shop. "Oh, seriously!", exclaimed a frustrated Dean, then hit the surface in front of him. He couldn't go back to the office empty-handed. Everyone would kill him and no one would care. After all, it was the damn FBI.
"I think I'm going to live." He nodded. "Don't get me wrong: I feel dead now, but I'll recover and I'll tell you one thing - it was amazing."
"I'm going to go change. Bobby and Sam should be here soon," he replied, poking his head out from behind the dividing wall separating the stairs from the living room.
"Oi, the little one in the coat! Where are you going!" shouted Dean, lazily slipping onto the couch.
Castiel hung up his coat and ran a hand through his hair. The man looked around for a moment, then sighed and sat down on the couch next to his husband. He was relieved to see that the place was tidy. Dean's dirty flannel wasn't rolling around on the floor, and nail polish didn't stain the coffee table. Castiel stretched his legs out in front of him and rested his head against the couch. He felt tired. He had been up since three in the morning and all he wanted was to go to bed. Dean noticed it too. He watched his partner out of the corner of his eye, then put his arm across his shoulders. He heard a quiet sigh at which a smile entered his face. They were finally together. They could just lie in each other's embraces and relax.
"What am I supposed to do now?" he whispered directly into Dean's ear, then bit his earlobe. "You want me to fill your ass with my cock? Is that what you want?"
"Oh. Well..." He shrugged his shoulders. It was obvious that he felt uncomfortable. He didn't expect to spend the evening at the table with Sam's family.
The man smiled swaggeringly. He couldn't decide if his wanted to watch Castiel's raspberry juicy lips or his innocent eyes. The very idea that he was straight seemed absurd to him, but he saw it as a kind of fun. He felt like changing his preference. To make this man feel powerful and in control. Make him his little toy, with which he could do whatever he wanted. He delighted in the idea and was close to losing control of himself. Because Dean Winchester may have had a slight problem with blood, and maybe - just maybe - he was turned on by the whole incident. However, he didn't want to put it into words. Castiel was just a simple man who only had intercourse with women. He intended to illustrate to him what he was losing.
"Dean, I swear, if you're planning on doing what I'm thinking..." He groaned, burying his face in his hands. He didn't want to admit it, but he incredibly liked the feeling of it.
"Hey, hey... Listen to me carefully." Dean grasped the man's chin and lifted it up gently. Their eyes met. That warm green with a soft blue. Like years ago. "You have no reason to be sorry. Especially since they're not poor kids. I checked all their records. Their parents hold high positions and they go to private schools. They are just trying to show how cool they are. It's not a big deal. I was there too, and look: I grew up to be a decent person!"
"Dad!" She turned to Castiel. "Dad's calling me names!"
"Yes, Dean. He's wearing cowboy boots like in every episode." Castiel rolled his eyes at his husband's behavior, but finished feeding him as a last resort, then rested his head against his shoulder. He loved the charm of his days off.
Dean had been holding Castiel's hand for a long time. Their fingers were intertwined and their hearts were beating fast. The man was still tingling with adrenaline. He felt a thrill that made him extremely excited. His pupils dilated and his mouth craved sweetness. Dean looked intently at the brunet beside him and searched for a way to get close to him in some way. Now that he had done the will of the gods, he felt that he had been given him as a gift for good behavior. He was to become his sweet reward for doing their will. It suited him just fine.
Claire muttered in response how she hated them, but eventually gave up and went upstairs to her room. All three of them were used to this. Both Dean and Claire loved drama. They could banter and argue for hours. Castiel, despite his migraines, realized that they did it for sport. In fact, they both loved each other. Every evening they would sit on the same couch with a box of cookies between them and watch some stupid talk show that was on. And he had to admit – that view calmed him the most.
His heart was beating fast. It seemed to him that it was he who was about to end his wanderings in this world, not Sam. He feared that with every passing second the gods were heaping more misfortune and deprivation on him because of his corpse. Dean held in his hand, placed behind his back, that which could help him. Taking a deep breath, he made his choice. And although the sound Sam made, signalling endless pain and the fear of death, terrified him - he did not want to take one step back. With the knife piercing the man's flesh, he felt a surge of new strength that would take him to new heights. Confidence filled him. Seeing only good in his actions, he slowly drew his dagger to strike another deep and deadly blow into the body of his brother. At that moment, he no longer heard human suffering and helpless pleading for help. He had before his eyes the opening of the gates to the favour of the gods and he did not intend to disregard this path.
"How?" He asked, opening his eyes.
"What had happened to him?"
"You wouldn't have any entertainment then," he replied, closing his eyes. "How was work?"
Although he never had it easy, Castiel overcame every disadvantage that fate threw at his feet. At the age of nineteen, he learned that his then girlfriend was pregnant. As a poor student carrying the burden of student loans on his shoulders, he could not imagine how his life could have turned out. He was in despair. Neither did Amelia, who made it clear she wasn't going to give up her future for the child of the man. And nine months later she was born – Claire. A ray of his own personal sunshine. Since then, Castiel has done everything he could to provide her with a decent life. Though he had risked many times and lost even more often, in the moment everything was perfect. Just like any other day, he closed the candy shop, on his way he stopped by the poor family living across the street to give them food, then headed home. His dear, warm little house. A smile appeared on his face at the thought of taking off his coat, warming himself by the fireplace, and spending a little time with his family.
"Life isn't fair, kid." Dean shook his head, then took a sip of his coffee.
“I was a Captain.” Castiel felt the eyes on him as he got to his feet. “While poker does sound fun, I’m sure that there are games that would be more enjoyable.”
“I thought you weren’t coming,” Bobby grumbled.
“Of course.” Dean handed him one and pulled another out for himself.
Forgot to upload on Saturday, but I hope you like this chapter.
“Do you remember the Easter where mom sent Luke and I to the store, but he came back with a bloody nose and black eye?”
“He will eat them.”
All of his careful plans fade away one afternoon when he’s gardening with Jack. He had planned on teaching him all about the wonders of bees as they weeded and pruned their patch of native plants. Midway through teaching he’s distracted by the paint on his house that’s starting to look shabby. That’s when he remembers the card Dean gave him. The man had said that he paints houses all the time.
Two hours later he showed up at Gabriel’s apartment to pick up Jack. He groaned when he saw the state that it was in. “I don’t know if I should trust you to watch him,” he said when he was just inside the door.
“It’s a mythical creature, said to be extremely large. Think of a grizzly bear walking on two feet. It is otherwise referred to as bigfoot,” Castiel explained.
“I know you don’t know me well, but I can stay for a bit. If it would help you out.”
Sam Winchester seemed to know just about everyone. When his old car gave him trouble, he told him about Bobby Singer. The man was a magician and probably the only reason that Castiel could delay buying a car for six weeks. When his laptop seemed to be failing, he told him about Charlie Bradbury. She was so good he was almost positive that the alterations she made weren’t quite legal. “If they are like Bobby and Charlie.”
“Anger issues, drinking problem, and arrogant.” She rolled her eyes. “We’ve had trouble finding him a good match.”
“Nice to meet you, ma’am.”
As a law student (at least at my school) often times you can join a clinic where you provide free legal help under supervision of a professor. One of those clinics is wills and trusts. Our law school is like five blocks from a hospital so sometimes the clinic does receive phone calls from the hospital wanting to help people with wills.
“Hot chocolate? If you don’t tell Jack. It’s not that cold we can sit on the porch.”
“Daddy, aren’t you going to throw them?”
“You’re good with them,” Castiel whispered as he bumped against Dean’s shoulder while they walked from the monkey enclosure to where the big cats were.
“Not unless it’s a scheduling impossibility.” She got up and walked out without saying anything else.
“Thank you.” Castiel smiled when he saw Jack running up to him. “Say goodbye to Uncle Gabriel, you’ll see him Friday.”
“It was your idea, why do you seem so glum?”
Castiel sighed and rubbed his temples. He remembered the text from earlier today. “Yes, you have made it perfectly clear I need to work on my humor.” Castiel ran a hand though his hair.
As of now I have about 30,000 words pre-written and I will attempt to post once a week.
After breakfast is made, it felt strangely domestic. Dean has eaten, so he offers to make the sandwiches for lunch while Castiel is at the table, trying to fix the girls’ hair. Another thing that he is not used. Alex’s hair is pin straight, but pins it away from her face with a butterfly clip. For Claire he coaxes her curls into clumsy twin braids, a skill he learned from all the years he was forced to play with Anna.
“Those are Mrs. Mills kids. Claire is my best friend,” Jack said and looked up at Dean. “My name is Jack.”
“When do I get to meet him?”
“That’s what I want to name our baby, after my father.”
“That’s a relief.”
“Did you brush your teeth?” he questioned.
“Because the girls that Sam has set me up with before have all been the same. Busy and caught up in their own lives, looking for something casual. Ever since Sam proposed to Eileen it’s like he expects me to settle down too.”
“Not quite ready to go,” he muttered gesturing for Dean to follow. The man had a small leather knapsack and was dressed in jeans with a tight black t-shirt.
“Just let me know if you need help with anything else.” Dean pulled a card out of his pocket and set it on the counter. “I used to build houses so I’m comfortable with a lot.”
“Born and raised in Kansas. We moved around a lot after my mom passed away. Sam and I visited a lot because of Ellen and Bobby. I moved here about ten years ago and Sam eventually followed when he was done with school.”
“Peas are dumb.”
After dinner was finished, Castiel had to argue with Dean that he didn’t need to help with dishes. Still he stayed leaning against the kitchen as Castiel loaded up the dishwasher and Jack went outside to play on the swing set. When Dean looked down at his watch for the time, Castiel opened a drawer to pull out his check book. He wrote it hastily, adding a little extra to the low price that Dean had told him. “No arguments.”
“Nothing happened that night. Dean came and I offered him dinner for being so nice to come over on his day off. Then he stayed. He just watched the kids to give me time to wind down and left when they started to get ready for bed.” Castiel looked at Jody’s reaction which was very confusing. Her eyes looked sad, but a smile tugged at the corners of her mouth.
“Well come on. Benny and Andrea are both working right now. I told him we were coming so he’s making us something special.”
“I had a nice time tonight. However, I was wondering if you would like to do it again accept alone and perhaps not at my house.” Castiel rubbed the back of his neck and looked up from where he was staring at his feet to see Dean. The man’s face had a smirk across it as one armed leaned on his truck.
Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose. The food in front of him smelled delightful, but Gabriel was triggering a headache that would cause nausea soon enough. “Fine, but you better keep this to yourself, is that clear? I better not hear of you disclosing information to Dad or Anna.”
“Come on, Cas. You’ve always just seemed a bit more interested in men.”
“It’s freezing too.”
“I can appreciate the male specimen!” he objected. “And that’s all that happened, he came to fix your roof and then he slipped you his number?”
The two sat in silence after that, eating their lunch. Jody knew quite a lot about him even though she only had met Castiel two years ago. She’d only been Sheriff a few weeks the night of the accident. He knew the night had impacted her badly. It was a freak storm: wind that blew trees across the street and rain that had made the road slick. It was only by chance that her deputies went to his apartment and not her.
“Not yet…” He pulled a chair to her bedside as he took her hand.
“Anna
“Her and Benny want to have a kid soon.” Dean looked out the window. “It looks like Jody showed up. You said you know her?”
“It is.”
“I’ll have you over soon. It’s small, but all I really need. Open downstairs, two bedrooms upstairs. The lake view is pleasant. However, it will need a bit of work. I suppose that is the tradeoff for such a low price.”
“We out of beer?”
Castiel didn’t realize how tense he was. He loosens his shoulders, and turns to stand in front of him. “Thank you for being so honest with me.”
“I assume that you have trouble with the word ‘convey’ it means to let someone know something, to communicate. Displease is to make unhappy.” Castiel picked up his fork and knife to eat his chicken. He looked around the table as Claire and Alex had bored looks across their face, Jody was trying to hold back a laugh. “It seems my conversational skills are not appreciated once more.”
Yes, life was much different with Jack, but things were going to Castiel’s way.
“I am not…” He shoved Jo playfully. “The guy is weird, Sam. He baked me a pie.” He turned to Jo. “And I’m sharing, you don’t need to rag on me for eating pie for breakfast.”
“Unfortunately, my skills in the kitchen are better suited to baking, but Jack finds my food passable.”
“You know how it is. I spend all day here and then I go home to the girls.” She looked him over and then lit up. “The girls have been wanting to do something before school starts. Camping would be my go-to, but you know Alex…” She pulled out her phone and slid it over. “Do you want to come to the zoo with us? We’d have to drive to Seattle so I could use some adult company and Jack would love it.”
“Kind of boring,” Dean said with a smirk across his face. Castiel held back an eyeroll, sensing he was trying to get a rise out of him. “We just talked.”
“Just because I was in the army do not think I am a fan of guns.”
The girls nodded.
“Sorry, it’s just lately I swear every conversation has been about babies or weddings.” She fixed Eileen a pointed look before getting up. “I’m going to see how long before foods out.”
Dean looked at Castiel. The man had never been anything but loving with his son that he had seen. “What do you mean his mess?”
“It’s not like I was trying to keep them hidden,” Castiel said plainly.
Laughter made him stop studying the photos. He walked away and went to what must be Jack’s room. Inside Castiel had changed into sleep pants and a t-shirt—the most casual he had ever seen him. He had pulled a chair close to the bed where Jack was tucked in. He couldn’t tell what he was reading, but he listened as his voice changed for each character along with flowing hand moments. Not wanting to interrupt the moment he leaned against the doorframe, allowing himself to listen. After what had to be at least a good twenty minutes Cas gave him a kiss on the forehead and smoothed out Jack’s damp hair.
“Proportional?” he questioned.
“Gabriel…” He gestured to his son.
Castiel nodded.
I legitmately forgot that I was going to post again on Saturday. Ooops. Well, I hope this brightens your Monday :) It's a pretty fluffy chapter compared to the last one.
“Hello,” Dean replied when Castiel said nothing.
“What about Dean?”
“I thought as much, but that’s not what I meant.”
“Why don’t we let Dean work? You three continue watching the movie and I’ll see about dinner. We can eat outside tonight.” He watched as they reluctantly went away. Dean had started getting to work at patching it up. “I apologize for that you didn’t—”
“Yes, I believe I overestimated my abilities.” He gave him a warm smile, though, and a quick peck on the cheek. This earned a round of giggles from the three children. “I need to finish getting the children ready. Could you handle breakfast? I was going to make oatmeal.”
“My brother.” Sam walked to the front desk and asked for pen and paper. “Now I can’t vouch for his people skills, but he’s never met a problem he can’t fix. I’ll text him to let him know you’ll be calling.”
During lunch it still seemed that Jack was sad, so Castiel took him out by the lake to skip rocks again. It was a simple, but something that never failed to put a smile on his face. As they selected their rocks he was reminded of Kelly. When he returned home, they met on the beach, drinking coffee on the rocks. He almost didn’t go near the water but she insisted that since it was low tide, they needed to look for sand dollars. No sand dollars were found, but she found quite a few smooth, flat stones and insisted on teaching him how to properly skip rocks.
“Considering we have our clothes on, that’s probably a no,” Jo teased, punching his shoulder as he sat down beside her. “And where were you? I wanted to surprise you, usually you spend all day here.”
Castiel had been stateside for three months when he heard a knock at his door. He had no idea what time it was as he had fallen asleep on the couch watching some sitcom that everyone kept on making references to. Although he supposed that the whiskey bottle that was getting dangerously low had a large part in his sleepy nature. Another knock.
“That’s how it is for Mr. Novak, besides it was a long time ago.”
Castiel pinched his nose and then looked at the clock. “My lunch break is over in a few minutes. Why don’t we table this for now?”
As he pulled in the parking lot, he saw the rain starting to sprinkle. His trench coat was in the back and he was thankful for the jacket he packed for Jack. The two trekked across the parking lot and upon entering the building his eyes great fully landed on the table laden with coffee and cookies. “Only one cookie today,” he whispered to the child as he stopped.
Any lightness on Castiel’s face just melted off. He tilted his head and furrowed his eyebrows. “Why would I not spend time with my child?”
“You met his family?”
Dean shrugged, and rubbed the back of his neck. “You know I practically raised Sammy. I haven’t been around someone their age since he was that old.” He let out a laugh.
A loud knock caught him in the middle of creating a fire. Castiel wiped his hands on his pants before going to the door. “You look nearly drowned,” he said. Washington hardly every snowed where they were, but it made up from it with the rain. Outside it must have been pouring, Alfie was soaked to the bone, cheeks and nose all pink.
“Still. I know that you tell Gabriel everything and don’t try to deny it. I stopped in the bakery this week and he looked like a cat that caught the canary when I said I was watching Jack.”
“I’d like that.”
“We can go to bed and be very quiet then.”
His skin is all creamy porcelain, his figure long and lithe. He gets turned on when Alfie lets his work pants fall to the ground revealing a pair of blue boxer briefs that hug his ass so well. “Don’t get too excited, dinner and cookies first.”
“Hey! I brought you pizza.” Dean came in from the kitchen, beer in hand.
“Your mannerisms and you told me at pick-up a few days ago that she broke up with that man she was dating.”
She spoke with him all through the night and Castiel just listened. This women who at one point he thought he loved, who he had gotten into fights with Luke over. She was his friend first after all, before she had even met Luke. Kelly could see past the charming smile and manipulative words that Luke spoke. This beautiful, kind women who saw the best in everyone. The woman that had so much hope.
Castiel has to stifle a laugh. “Thank you. And you don’t have to worry about Jack and vegetables.”
“Soda cooler is over by the kids.” He gestured across the yard where Charlie now had them all playing with foam swords. “Water is in the house if you want to follow me.”
The two walked to the backyard like instructed and he was surprised at how much room there and just how many people fit into the backyard. He blinked a few times before he saw Sam talking to an older woman. “Cas!” he saw him wave with a goofy grin on his face. “Castiel, Jack, this is Ellen. She’s practically my second mom.”
“Does it have to be white again?” Jack questioned.
Alfie just grinned and jumped on top of Castiel, straddling him. Castiel’s hand slipped under his shirt, enjoyed the feeling of delicate skin before he reached his nipples. With a smirk, he pinched the nipples enjoying the small yelp from Alfie as he wiggled against him. Clothes begin to peel off in layers, shirt, pants, belts thrown aside. When only their underwear was left, Castiel flipped Alfie on to the ground. The smaller man’s eyes sparkled with excitement, and he moaned when Castiel pinned a wrist to the ground. From experience, he knew that Alfie quite liked it when Castiel overpowered him.
“Blue shirt,” Castiel said as he saw his son across the yard catch a ball thrown by Charlie. “Charlie certainly has a way with them. He’s never like that unless his friend, Claire is around.” He shook his head a bit to tear his attention away and focus on the adult conversation. “Sorry, just caught in my thoughts.”
Having saw Dean the day prior, it was not Castiel’s intention to call him again. Jody did not work until midnight, but she dropped the girls off at three so she could nap before then. He was in the middle of cooking dinner when the children began to wear his patience thin.
“Yes, I am.” Castiel tried to look busy, not exactly knowing how to broach this topic with Jack.
“That is not funny.”
A few hours later Dean was elbow deep in a sink of hot water. Dinner had gone surprisingly well. Dean was surprised at how heartily Castiel dug into his burger, even going for a second. Jack seemed to be equally pleased, happy to make his own burger leading to ketchup smeared across his face and dripped onto his shirt.
“Well yet, but daddy reads me these exciting books with magic and adventures.” A wide smile crossed his face. “Do you like the Hobbit?”
“Don’t worry Mr. Novak,” Alex replied.
They all sit down at the table and take terms dishing up the pasta. Castiel and Jack eat in amicable silence while Dean looks between the two of them curiously. “I’m sorry, maybe you can do silent dinners, but can we talk about something? This is killing me.”
“I’m seeing a friend. I believe I told you about Sam Winchester and his fiancé Eileen Leahy.” The lie came easily to him, but he had hung out with Sam a handful of times so it seemed like a better cover than saying he was spending time with Jody.
“I keep the towels in the closet next to the spare room,” he said. “And I will not be ashamed for entertaining my son.” The smirk on his face seemed to indicate that he was not angry as placed a warm hand on Dean’s back and followed him closely down the stairs. “They are just to the left, the narrow door.”
“Now that school’s out for summer I’ve been crashing here when, I get off a few days from work,” Jo responded with a wide grin.
“I will not meddle.” She put her bowl in the kitchen sink and looked outside. “However, I think we should interfere in that.” She gestured to the children who looked to be up to mischief.
“It’s good for them.” Jody then turned the conversation to the kids, doing a much better job at coaxing them to talk. She was good even with Jack. Soon the room was filled with stories from school. Castiel did his best to listen, but he only caught bits and pieces as he planned what needed to be done with his house.
“Heya Cas. Listen I know you can’t spend the night, but how about I come over? Maybe make the two of you dinner?”
“Dean and I want some alone time every once in a while.”
There’s a crash followed by some shouting and a giggling then a: “Mr. Novak!” The man’s shoulders drop as he ran back into the house. Dean tried to peek his head in through the doorway, resisting the urge to go inside. The house was clean and organized, the only sign of kids is the sound he heard and the swings out front.
After dinner Jack begged and begged to go out and skip rocks on the lake (“For the second time today”). He was so full of bright enthusiasm as he ran ahead of them. If Castiel hadn’t shouted—or rather sternly spoke—at him to stop he would have ended knee deep in the water. It made Dean’s heart pang for a life he had left behind a few years ago.
After they wrapped up the game, they sat around the living room just talking. Well Charlie did most of the talking. Gilda kept Ash from going to sleep on the kitchen table (no one else seemed to think that was strange). When Charlie proposed turning on a movie, Castiel glanced down at his watch. “I have to get to my brother’s place.” He looked at Dean who at this point was nursing a glass of whiskey while sitting on the couch, offering no input on Gilda’s movie selection. He walked over, placing a hand on his arm. “Want a ride home?”
He was glad that Anna installed a mount for his phone, even though he said he wouldn’t use it. Bobby’s was on the other side of town. He supposed it made sense, if he remembered right Sam said he owned his own mechanic shop that was on the property. The shop was what he saw first but he turned a little further down the road and large house came into view. There were quite a few cars out front. Castiel took a deep breath, never that great with large groups of people.
“Your first?” a kind voice asked.
“Didn’t see you.”
A few minutes later the pair sat with their legs dangling off the edge of the small porch. They were close with a soft, loosely knitted blanket over their legs. “Jack may be an early riser, but he’s probably sound asleep right now so you can speak freely.” Castiel blew on the hot chocolate, steam rose from his honeybee mug.
“Cas you said that…” Alfie looked miserable as he tried to hide his body while slipping back on the pajama pants.
“Sam doesn’t think too much about my sex life. I just mean that you don’t seem like the kind of guy for one and done. I actually was pretty mad at that bitch for trying to get me to date you at first.”
“I hope I didn’t ruin your date.”
“Outside,” he said when they began fighting over a board game.
The one who took in two little girls with no families. The one who let Castiel and Jack into her heart with no questions asked. But he also knew that when his PTSD got bad, she worried too much, even long after the episode had passed.
There was a knock on his door and he looked up, seeing Sam Winchester taking up the space. “Do you have a minute?”
“He’s one of Sammy’s friends.” Dean set a pizza down on the table. “Now I do believe that someone promised me poker.”
“Not trying to pry, it’s just you seemed pretty pissed at the beer.”
“I know that Claire and Alex will be there, but Sam didn’t say anything about other children,” Castiel told his son as he packed up the car. He noticed his son eyeing the two pies he put on the seat beside him. “You need to eat lunch before any pie, okay?”
Dean turned out to be a blessing. He asked about baseball, then got Alex talking about doing soccer in the fall. From there the conversation veered as he asked about Mary Poppins and other movies. All of it was light and happy. It brought smiles to the children’s faces until all their plates were cleared.
“Yeah, see you around.”
Morning was no better. He was good about establishing a routine with Jack, so usually their mornings could go like clockwork. Claire and Alex threw a wrench into a routine simply because there was more to be done. For an outing like his he would like to leave as soon as possible, but that was not a reality.
“Excuse me?”
“Night Dean,” the boy called out.
“I was hoping you would be late enough so I could hide the evidence.” She sighed as Castiel followed her to the table to help. He smiled upon seeing a large casserole dish filled with macaroni and cheese with sliced hotdogs. There was another bowl full of carrots and peas.
“One of juniors that lives on my floor owed me. I didn’t know if you drank, but I thought it would be fun together.”
Sam shrugged his shoulders. “Like I said before, he’s a good guy---”
“And why is that?” Castiel received his client assignments already and as far as he knew there were no new clients that had come in.
“Why don’t you get dressed and we can drive you?” The officer in front of the TV looked at the whiskey on the table. Castiel didn’t argue that he was sober. Instead he went to his bedroom and mechanically reached for a clean t-shirt, button down, and a pair of jeans. He grabbed sneakers that still felt rather strange to him compared to the combat boots he’d gotten used to.
“Well I never say no to a home cooked meal. I was going to grab takeout and your food is probably better.”
Sam rolled his eyes as he leaned forward. “Bobby and Ellen are doing a fourth of July thing this weekend since it falls on a Wednesday. We have a bunch of people there, and I thought you and Jack could come.”
“She wants me to be his father.”
The women looked a little taken aback.
“It doesn’t have to be a date, but friends…” He gestured in the air for a bit. “Hanging out? You know I don’t drink, but being at a bar doesn’t bother me. We could watch sports or—”
Jody’s eyebrow shot up as she leaned forward. “And you went on a date with him. I know I promised not to meddle, but Alex tells me pretty much everything.”
“I couldn’t imagine doing it without Benny. It must be hard not having his mom around.”
“Cassie, I’m sorry but the Sunday morning baker called out. I have to cover the first shift of the morning.” That meant he would be starting at 2:00 AM, and he probably be going to bed around six. Typically, a baker’s schedule worked quite well for a babysitter. Gabriel frequently watched Jack because he got off around 1:00 pm and Castiel didn’t work that late so he could still get plenty of sleep for his next shift.
“You playing ‘board games’…” He quirked his fingers into quotations marks. “One night with your friends does not a bad father make. You’re better than Lucifer ever would have been…”
“I know…” Jody has a smirk on her face as she leaned against the counter, and taking a drink of her beer. “So…”
“I’ll clear them if you want to go play on the swing set.”
“Dean forgive me I thought you were Jack.”
“My brother wants to meet you,” Castiel finally said when they were seated on a bench.
What he doesn’t expect to see is Gabriel’s face spreading into a smile. “Finally.”
“Well it was much appreciated; you do good work.” Castiel looked at the beer on the table. The frosted glass looked so appetizing. He rubbed his hands on his pants and looked back at Benny. “What sort of food truck do you run?”
There wasn’t any time to think, before they knew what hit them Luke strutted through the door. “Baby Cassie, I’m hooo
“No but very good with threats. Come on, Clarence. A guy like this needs someone like you. You don’t let anyone get underneath your skin and quite frankly he could use some of your tough love.”
“You didn’t stir the entire time I was getting ready. I thought you could use it.”
“I didn’t realize he was so old now.” She took a seat in the chair across from him and set down the folder to lay it open. “New client that I think would do well with you.”
“Well, my only price is to be the first to learn of any relationship developments. And you’re lucky for that. If I was Michael there was no way I would do a favor for you after you insulted me.”
“I’ve never seen you this angry, must have pushed a few buttons. But still I wouldn’t threaten me.” He had a smirk on his face. “You wouldn’t want me to let slip what I found out tonight.”
“Well, I am glad to see you.” The man waited for Jo to get up before wrapping her in a hug. “Eileen, where’s Sammy?”
“Arrow to the heart.” He clutched his chest as he dramatically collapsed in the chair. “Can’t two brothers spend some quality time together? I brought you lunch, real food. No peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.”
This is basically just a fic of the tropes that I love (not all of them, but quite a few). First things first, make sure to read the tags, I've added what I think are important starting out to know but I will try to update as I post. Additionally in the notes at the end of the chapter I will post anything that may be a content/trigger warning. Also after the warnings I may post fun facts/additional information.
“It’s Ellen, for the both of you.” She gave Jack a wink. “Dean brought your pie to Sunday dinner. I am going to have to get your recipe.”
“It’s my second time. Jody Mills, my daughter Claire is in Ms. Sunder’s class as well.”
Jack’s face lit up as he asked all sorts of questions. Everything else seemed to fade away as Castiel talked to him. For the both of them words didn’t necessarily come easy. Honestly Jack’s preschool teacher was worried until he got closer to Claire and became more emboldened. He was so slow to trust, but once he did, he seemed to blossom. Perhaps Castiel was the same way. He just knew that there was nothing he had to worry about with Jack.
“What is LARPing?” Castiel questioned.
“I do…” Castiel peeked his head out towards the living room. “Thank you for coming. Jack was a bit disappointed that we were having a sleep over without him. I don’t think he fully understands that sometimes adults want alone time.”
“Yes. Come in.” His one-bedroom apartment didn’t have a lot of options so he was forced to lead them into living room. The living room that was scattered with glasses that once held whiskey and take-out containers. “I apologize for the mess.” He sat down and one of them sat beside him as the other sat beside him. Castiel between them until one of the spoke:
“What do you mean?”
“The doctors don’t know if I’ll make it, Cas. Right now, Jack is safe, but they said that as soon as I’m stable, they want to perform a c-section. I wanted to make a video for you to show him.”
"Cas, look! Look at his shoes!" Excited Dean. "Cowboy boots! He's wearing cowboy boots again!"
"You have no idea how much..."
"In the end you woke me up anyway, but at least I feel much better now," said Castiel, tucking his head into the blond man's flannel shirt. - I slept like a baby."
"You don't have to ask for long" he said, then kissed his shoulder.
Dean and Castiel sat under one of the trees in the orchard behind the house. They enjoyed the red of the sky and the blood on Dean. The pallor of his skin contrasted with the gladness with which he was covered. If it had been about someone else, it might have been taken the wrong way, but Castiel didn't mind. Sure, he was a tad apprehensive at first, but something told him he could trust him. He was mesmerised by the way he moved or spoke.
"I see someone here doesn't want to get up" he said, laughing quietly.
"Yes, Dad," she nodded, still avoiding eye contact.
The next day Dean was the first to wake up. He sat on the edge of the bed for a long time, watching his sleeping husband. A small smile crept across his face as he carefully studied the silhouette of the man next to him. Dean glided his fingers across the man's chest, tracing every mole and the smallest birthmark, taking pride in its beauty. He was delighted. He didn't know how long it took. As if in a trance he could do nothing else. He felt a strong need for physical contact. That was why he stroked his skin for a long time, until finally – bored – he placed a long kiss on Castiel's lips, thus waking him up.
Without anyone's help, the sun rises, makes its journey across the sky and then returns to its original position. We can experience many things in a single 24-hour period. We are talking about ordinary, everyday activities, which we perform whether we want to or not, but also about wonderful, unique moments, which - perhaps - we will experience only once in a while, when our bodies are still standing on the surface of the earth. But the inevitable changes do not apply everywhere. In the old house on the Red Hill, time stopped a long time ago. The building had not changed over the last century - and neither had the blood-coloured sky that stood out against the town in the valley.
"I didn't have any doubts. Of course it had to be great. After all, it was the will of the gods. I was going to save you, and you were going to fuck me. After all, it was obvious. The signals were obvious."
"Cas, just shut up," he replied, not even looking out from under the sheets for a second.
Without thinking for long, the blonde found himself on his knees. Although he wanted Castiel to take the initiative, he knew he had to take care of some things. He had no experience in what they were about to do. Dean didn't seem to mind. He eagerly moved closer to his heated body, then pulled his trousers down to the ground - without breaking eye contact. Now that there was a considerable height difference between them, Castiel placed his hands on Dean's head. Although this was the first time he had been in this situation with a man, had done it before with women. That was why he wove his fingers into the storm of black strands with such confidence and let him take care of himself. He watched with pleasure as Dean pulled down his boxers, then bit his lip.
When Castiel came downstairs, the first thing he smelled was the smell of freshly made coffee and toasts. The man immediately sped up his pace, although he did not realize it. His body needed food and liquids. A moment later, he was standing in the doorway of the kitchen and there he saw Claire, who was watching Dean pick up the broken plate from the floor with a cheeky grin on her face. Castiel leaned against the doorframe and decided to watch his husband in action himself. Of course, he exchanged an amused glance with Claire first.
"For a month, dear cousin. For a month," Dean pointed out, restraining his reluctance to come to the surface.
"You are talking nonsense, brother. The gods have chosen him. The gods are waiting for his blood, and I'm not going to be the one to make them angry. I advise you to get some air, Dean. You're starting to think out of your mind..."
Dean lit a cigarette. He ignored the look on his cousin's face, who wanted to do the same. He inhaled the stimulant, then blew out the smoke, looking ahead. It seemed to him that something was wrong. The crows had ceased to make their presence known. There was a shrill silence which no one could control. The man slowly looked around. He did not see anything unusual. There were still bushes growing by the old, rusty fence. Individual blades of grass protruded from the spaces between the paving stones. The local squirrels had not left the trees, and the garage door still remained closed. However, something had changed. Dean got up from his chair. With a slow step, he stepped off the porch and made his way towards the gate. Without changing pace, he waited. He was looking out for the unexpected when he saw it.
After a while, as Dean massaged his testicles while simultaneously sucking hard on his cock, he grasped his face in both hands and slowly pulled away. Dean licked his lips, then looked into Castiel's eyes. He didn't know what was happening until Castiel held out his hand towards him. The man took advantage of the assistance. A few seconds later, he was standing on even feet and he could feel Castiel pressing against him. The stiff member touching his stomach was making him frustrated. Breathing slowly, he waited for Castiel to satisfy his need. However, he didn't seem to have that in mind. For the time being he roamed his mouth along the man's neck. He sucked and bit, irritating his delicate skin. He wasn't the slightest bit gentle, which Dean loved. The moment he put two fingers to his left nipple and started rubbing - a sound came from between Dean's lips. A loud, desperate moan that was meant to show Castiel how desperate and ready he was for the final act.
"I won't. I promise," he said, nodding. "I won't."
"It's true," said Dean, looking at the man. "You have a very familiar face..."
Dean spent the next few dozen minutes kneeling beside his brother's body. The red sun illuminated the dead man's face. The expression on his face was terrified and anxious. Dean began to wonder if this was also his soul now. Lost and frightened, or perhaps fleeing from the wrath of the gods. The man saw how much blood had been spilled from his miserable body. The once white carpet had turned red, and the stain on the floor was yet to come off. He wondered if he should clean it himself, or leave it to Charlie, who parlayed the cleaning of the crime scenes Sam liked to call 'altars'. Now he himself had become the reason the Wincheste's descendant had to scrub the floor on his knees.
Castiel put his arms around Dean's waist, then knocked him onto their newly purchased mattress. Without saying anything, he snuggled his head into his chest and sighed. He could stay like this for eternity. He loved his husband. He loved every little detail. His qualities and his worst flaws. He'd seen his face every day for years, where time had left more and more marks, and he couldn't stop thinking about how beautiful Dean Winchester was. Not just attractive, but good, responsible, brave and honest. Dean Winchester though he often behaved worse than a teenager, was the definition of all virtues. Castiel would sometimes just lie in their huge bed and instead of sleeping, he would reflect on how lucky he was to have a man like Dan Winchester. And more than once he felt the need to shout about it in his face.
"Dean, no," he spoke up, then kissing the man to get in the way. "Claire is behind the wall."
"Really?" he asked uncertainly, raising his eyebrows.
From then on they were inseparable together. They were different, but they found things in themselves that suited the other. Their joys and the confidences they shared with each other led to their decision to find an apartment together just three months later. And though Dean didn't like children, the vision of living with Claire didn't bother him. He'd dealt with her before. He'd tied her shoes, helped her with her homework, and even combed her hair. Many times then Castiel would show up with a camera in his hands and a huge smile on his face and make ‘his two princesses’ smile. The three of them were happy. Happier than ever before.
They had a two-storey house, polished to perfection and a source of their pride. The white of the paint contrasted with the ever-red sky and the darkness of the ground. The inhabitants of the valley avoided venturing into this area. Of course, every now and then two or three average citizens would go by car to buy fruit, but that was the end of their journey. They avoided meeting the Winchester family on that cursed hill, where everything was terrifying. Many of them could not understand how they had great, beautiful harvests when it seemed that nature had abandoned them. The grass did not grow, the rain did not fall and the sun did not change its position. It was perpetually blood-red and hovering high above their heads. There was no division into day and night. It constantly shone and enveloped the hill with its terrifying radiance, setting it apart from the rest of the world.
I feel Cas freeze when our lips meet, but it doesn’t take him long to relax, melt into my hand, melt into the kiss that’s making sparks dance over my skin.  He reaches up to drape his fingers over my wrist, rub his thumb along the back of my hand.  My pain doesn’t exist.  I only notice his gentle touch, the electrifying warmth of his lips pressed against my own.
Although Cas wasn’t entirely convinced, too overwhelmed by all the horrible sensations of being sick to want to wait twenty whole minutes, he trusted Dean more than anything. Dean knew what it was like to be sick. He knew what to do, knew all the tricks and methods of how to deal with an illness, and Cas believed him.
Still, there’s not much I can do to calm my rapid heartbeat when the train steadily rolls to a stop.  One quick glance out the window tells me we’ve arrived at the station.  A small flock of cameras swarms the platform, waiting to broadcast our advent to the whole country.  Much to my relief, though, there doesn’t appear to be a massive crowd of people out there, not like in the Capitol.  No, everyone is probably in the square, anticipating the start of this homecoming ceremony.  I barely have a chance to wonder where our families might be in all of this before Cas gently grabs my arm, ripping me back to the reality at hand.
As he stood and stretched the sleepiness out of his muscles, Dean spared a glance at the alarm clock on his nightstand. It was just past seven in the morning. Surely Sam was already up. Hell, he’d probably gone out for a jog
I’m barely in control of myself anymore.  Reality is spiraling.  Cresh is still alive.  I can hear him.  He’s trying to pull the switchblade out of his stomach, but I reach the blade before he does.  I yank it out, plant myself on his waist as he did to me, and stab it into his chest without even hesitating.
As I turn around and accept a firm hug from Cas’ father, I see my parents sandwiching Cas in a hug of their own.  I can’t help but smile at the sight.  They kiss his head, rub his back, shower him in just as much appreciation and gratitude as his parents are with me.  The air is ripe with love and affection, and I’m not taking a second of it for granted.
“What can you do?”  My burlap sack has reached its breaking point, so we start piling the seed heads into Charlie’s.  “It’s out of our control.  You’re doing everything you can right now, and that’s keeping me distracted, even if it’s just for a few minutes.”
“Trust me, I thought about it,”  I tell her, “but I couldn’t risk not getting food for today.  We’ve been running low for a few weeks now.”
The moment I pass through the door and exit the station, though, I nearly collide with someone who starts at my sudden appearance.  All I catch is a glimpse of ginger hair, but that’s all it takes.  In an instant, I know it’s none other than Charlie Bradbury.
Ten wasn’t too bad, Dean thought, lifting his shoulders in a shrug when his foggy brain processed what Sam said. “Cas did,” he muttered, upset by the mere memory of how miserable Cas had been. “He was up coughing his lungs out until three.”
At this, Dean blinked his tired eyes all the way open. He resituated and propped himself up on his elbows, retracting one hand from beneath his pillow to gently press the back of it to Cas’ forehead. “Hmm,” he hummed to himself, flipping his hand to touch Cas’ skin with his palm. “You’re really warm.”
“You’re a lot more stubborn than I thought,”  he says.  “I kind of admire it.  It’ll just make killing you that much more fun.”
Unfortunately, it was. As soon as Dean stepped into the kitchen, he spotted Sam sitting at the table, taking a sip of an unnaturally green liquid, and the coffee pot on the counter sat abandoned and neglected. The poor thing.
“Hey,” Sam greeted without even looking in Dean’s direction. It was quiet. He must’ve heard the footsteps.
His eyes sparkling, Cas lightly pats my wrist.  “Figure something out?”  he offers, his smile widening.
I try not to think too much about it.  It makes me sick every year.  How can those people in the Capitol stand to let children die like that, let alone
him or be
“Of course,” Cas replied without a moment’s hesitation, opening his eyes and turning to meet Dean’s gaze. Either he didn’t notice the uncertainty in Dean’s face, or Cas was hiding his own worry now. “What is it?”
“I’m totally okay with being friends with you,”  she said with her head held high, “but I don’t like boys, so don’t get any ideas.”
Rowena starts off our session by making us walk lines in the living room so she can adjust our posture and correct our footing to make it look like we’re sauntering with self-assurance.
Hey guys! I'm leaving for a vacation tomorrow, so unfortunately, the next update won't be until July 11. I know, bad timing, what with things kicking off and getting dramatic, but 10 days to wait isn't too bad, right?
That, along with when I was old enough to understand the disgusting horrors of the Hunger Games.
I kick over the nightstand.  I hate the Capitol for tearing my family apart.  I hate the Capitol for killing Cas’ brother and then forcing him into the same situation six years later.  I hate the Capitol for thinking murder is okay, and I hate them for the fact that I might never see the people I love ever again.
“Good,” Dean said, gently kissing where the crook of Cas’ neck would be through the hoodie. “I’m gonna take good care of you. I know it sucks right now, but we’ll get through this together, okay?”
your water,” Dean said with a grin. “Now go. Shoo. I want a movie loaded up and ready to go by the time I get there.”
There’s no fight, no energy left in me when he rolls me onto my back.  I can’t do anything when he plants himself on my waist and holds that knife to my throat again, pressing his knees into my sides so I can’t move.  Tears burn in my eyes when I see the ferociously gleeful grin on his face.  He could’ve killed me right off the bat.  Just slit my throat when my back was turned and moved on.  But no, he’s enjoying every second of this.  He wants me to suffer.
“Speaking of, how’s Sam holding up?”  Charlie asks as we start down the next row of wheat stalks.  Her voice has dropped, and I know why.
“I’m sorry,”  she murmurs against my chest.  “I wish you and Sam didn’t have to go through this.  It’s horrible.”
He’s attractive, too.
I still remember the first day I met her.  It was out here in these fields, a day or two after she’d essentially harassed the granary owner into letting her work.  She was set on harvesting her first set of seed heads by herself but didn’t quite know where to snap them off.  I happened to be in the area, so I offered to show her the best place to snap them.  After a short lesson, she’d already gotten the hang of it.  I was about to leave when she called out to me and asked if I wanted to be friends.  I barely knew anything about her, of course, other than her bravery and tenacity, but she seemed like an interesting person.  Who was I to deny her harmless request?
At first Cas didn’t say anything—Dean just assumed he’d nodded—but then he spoke up as Dean grabbed the doorknob, his voice already sounding small and thrashed. “I love you.”
“So am I just supposed to sit here and watch you drink coffee while I have
Another balmy breeze blows over the land.  I draw a deep breath in a desperate attempt to rid myself of those terrifying thoughts.  I’ve survived the reapings for four years now, even with taking tesserae, but it’s impossible to predict the future.  You never know whose name they’re going to pull out of those glass balls.
I have to pull away to catch my breath.  I rest my forehead on his, keep my hand on his cheek.  He’s breathing heavily, too.  I feel his skin flush under my palm.
Cas frowned. How could he be warm to the touch? He was sure his insides were turning to ice, which certainly wasn’t natural. Maybe he was cursed. Sam and Dean had dealt with a local rogue witch recently. Maybe she planted a hex bag on them somehow, and now—
When I tell her twenty-five, she drops her burlap sack and slips her arms around my abdomen, squeezing me so tightly I can barely breathe.  I hold her close, my hands suddenly trembling and my heart pounding against my ribs.  Not even the warmth and solace of her embrace can calm the anxious thoughts rampaging around inside my head.
There are small numbers inscribed on both of our keys, and the numbers match the ones adorning the grand columns in front of the houses.  But, since almost all of them look identical on the outside, we decide to just check out the interior of mine.  We walk along the cobblestone path, passing by a beautiful marble fountain that doesn’t appear to be active—or at least not currently—and trek up the front steps to my new home.
The pain is immediate and beyond excruciating.  A long, howling scream rips apart my throat.  My eyes squeeze shut, head tilts back as the sound of my own scream echoes in my ringing ears.  Hot blood gushes out of my punctured hand.  I can’t move it.  It’s pinned to the earth by the knife.  My entire arm has gone numb, consumed by unbearable agony.
Last chapter :( It's so bittersweet to reach the end of a story, isn't it?
Meaning that my little brother Sam, whose name is only in there once, has two chances to get reaped for that vile fight to the death.  Just thinking about it makes my skin crawl and my stomach churn.
I’m showered with congratulatory praises from our team and Cas, who’s grinning like I’ve never seen before.  Bobby even mentions that it’s possible the Gamemakers saw my fight with Cresh and took a liking to my attitude, too.  I’m not sure how true his guess is, but I’ll take it.  I received a decently high score considering the little amount of confidence I had prior to the session, and I couldn’t be happier.
I feel another pair of arms wrap around my mother and me, strong but still trembling.  Without a doubt, I know I’m sandwiched between my parents, enveloped in a warm embrace that I never want to escape from.  Somewhere behind me, I hear Cas and his parents talking in garbled sobs.  I’m torn between feeling my heart swell at their reunion and absolutely bawling my eyes out when I think about everything they’ve been through.  I don’t know what to feel anymore.
Every twenty-five years, there’s a special kind of Hunger Games called a Quarter Quell.  This year is the hundredth anniversary of the Hunger Games, meaning it’s the fourth Quarter Quell.  Each Quarter Quell is separated from the rest of the regular years by a different rule or method of reaping or arena in general.  In the past, twice as many tributes have been reaped from each district, or the people in the districts voted on who to send to the arena.
“Rest,” Dean told him. “I sent Sam out to get medicine and stuff for soup, but you and me? We’re gonna take it easy. Watch some movies, maybe catch up on our shows. The next few days are gonna be lazy and completely stress-free so you can get better as soon as possible. How does that sound?”
Something about the way she throws her arms around and squeezes the life out of a wide-eyed Cas makes a delighted laugh bubble up in my throat.  He looks so startled, so shocked by her unexpected embrace, but it doesn’t take long for him to relax and return the gesture.  Seeing the two of them together after I told Cas in the arena that he and Charlie would be great friends makes me smile so wide that my cheeks hurt.
“How do I make it stop?” he groused, squeezing his eyes shut in a desperate attempt to fight off the nausea swirling in his stomach.
I knew it was the start of an amazing friendship from her parting words to me that day.  They still echo in my head, and they always make me smile.
Cas grumbled, snatching his wrist back from Dean’s grip. Dean wanted to make a joke about how hot and cold Cas was being, but thankfully, he bit his tongue before he could. Teasing a feverish, caffeine deficient person about being hot and cold, both literally and figuratively in this case, would probably get him attacked.
With an abrupt laugh, one that’s teeming with pure relief and gratitude, she kisses my forehead and pulls me into her arms.  She’s a lot stronger than she looks.  I think she’s squeezing me tighter than my own mother, which is certainly saying something.  But it’s beyond comforting.  There’s nothing quite like a mother’s embrace.
Cas shrugged, glancing back and forth between his nightstand and Dean’s until his narrowed eyes finally focused on the fresh glass of water. He swallowed down a few big gulps, drew as big of a breath as he could without risking another coughing fit, then returned his attention to Dean. He still looked half-asleep and rather out of it—probably exhausted from the unpleasant night, too—so that gave Dean an idea.
I think that’s what sparks the switch.  With Sam hugging Cas, it only takes seconds for Gabriel to run to me and knock the air out of my lungs with his tight hold.  Still, he says nothing, but it’s far from necessary.  I can feel his overwhelming gratitude in his embrace, the way he noiselessly cries into my shirt, the way he clutches the fabric like he might collapse if he doesn’t.  And I hope he knows how happy I was to help.
“And, as a final act of congratulations,”  the mayor says, retrieving something from his pockets, “I present you with these.”
“I knew you could do it,”  she whispers, her voice dangerously close to breaking.  It takes every last bit of strength I have in me to keep another round of tears at bay.  “I always knew you could.”
when there was a stumbling knock on the Cave’s door. Sam, having returned from running his errands, shuffled in seconds later, weighed down by all sorts of grocery bags that were throwing off his balance. As he offered an out-of-breath greeting, Cas grabbed the remote and paused the movie.
“I have to be,”  I say.  “Who else in my family is capable of spending hours in this boiling field?”
movie and returned to the comfort of the couch.
With a growing smirk of his own, Dean drew the hood of Cas’ hoodie back and latched his lips onto Cas’ neck. He was going to utter a low groan for added effect, but when Cas tilted his head to the side, exposing more of his neck to Dean’s keen mouth, and let out an overly pleased hum from deep within his throat, Dean realized he didn’t have to. Sam got the picture, crystal clear.
Finally, Caesar reads off the score of six for the second boy from District 8.  My face flashes on the screen next, and the whole world skids to a halt around me.  My heart pounds.  I can’t breathe.  I can’t even bear to look at the screen, and not even the reassurance of both Rowena and Cas gripping my hands can calm me down.
And he felt terrible for acting so grouchy yet again when all Dean was trying to do was help.
I don’t have long to decipher his meaning.  He looks to Cas again, whose face is ever so slightly tinted pink.  “I think endearing and bashful will work well for you, especially if we sprinkle in just a bit of confidence and ferocity to spice things up.  How does that sound?”
“Just say we annoy you, then. Won’t hurt my feelings,” Dean teased, punching Sam’s shoulder as he walked past to head toward the kitchen; he almost chuckled louder than Sam when Sam let out an insanely overdramatic yelp of pain in response to the punch.
There are silver trunks and boxes and containers piled deep into the mouth of the Cornucopia.  One of them has to hold that precious antivenom.  It doesn’t look like any of them are marked, though, so I’ll have to do some rummaging, and quickly.
Dean hit the start button on the coffee pot and turned around just in time to see Sam’s eyebrows shoot up. “Cas is sick?” Sam recapitulated, surprised and concerned all wrapped up into one tone of voice. “Oh, man, that really sucks. And he’s never had a human sickness before either, right? So that’s probably making this even worse.”
“Hey, he won’t have to bug me,” Dean protested when Sam shared an arch glance with Cas. “I was already planning on making soup, because I
All was well. Cas was chuckling without spiraling into a fit of coughing. Dean truly did feel fine, completely healthy, and he loved seeing Cas back on his feet. Everything was back to normal.
The thought hits me before I have a chance to plan it out.  I grab the hilt of the blade keeping my hand on the ground and pull on it.  Another wave of intolerable agony shoots through me, messes up my vision, makes a pained scream rise out of my burning chest as the knife slides past skin and bone and muscle and finally out into the open.  There’s a ghastly hole in my hand that I try my best to ignore, because I see the other District 1 boy now, and he sees me.
The only thing important enough to break up our blissful reunion is Bobby.  He tells us that the homecoming ceremony in the square is set to start in less than thirty minutes, and we need to get moving before we’re late.  As much as I’d like to stay here, I know it would not be ideal to be late for our own ceremony.
I almost jump out of my shoes when he suddenly sucks in a violent breath.  Convulsions shake his body as he flops over onto his back.  It’s the worst fit yet.  Panicked and desperate and hardly controlling my own arms, I fumble with the locks on the trunk and grab the syringe filled with the blue liquid.  I have to press my knee over his elbow to keep his arm steady enough for me to jab the needle into it and squeeze the plunger.  Slowly, the blue liquid disappears into his arm.
is a pirate,” Dean remarked moments later, pointing at the screen when Jack Sparrow nonchalantly stepped off his sinking boat and sauntered onto Port Royal’s dock. “God, he’s so cool. I can never tell if I want to
Caesar Flickerman has been the host for as long as I can remember, and it shows.  His skin has faint traces of wrinkles, but clearly the advanced techniques of Capitol surgery have kept him as young as they can.  Despite the faded lines on his face and the near-imperceptible bags beneath his eyes, his energy and enthusiasm is far from old and aged.  He always changes his color theme for his hair and suit every year, too, and this year, it looks like he’s decided on a pastel green.
“You look like you need some help,”  Cresh says.  With the strength of a thousand men, he hauls me upright, only to strike me in the jaw and send me stumbling back to the ground yet again.
A look of concern and sympathy crossed Sam’s face. “Did he take any medicine?”
Waiting for me when Gabriel eventually lets me go is Cas’ mother.  There’s a smile on her tear-stained face, composed of happiness and anguish and appreciation and so many other emotions that are too mixed together to discern.  Her shaking hands cup my face, and for a while, she just looks at me, her lips quivering as more tears stream down her cheeks, and I look back.  She doesn’t need to say anything, either.  Seeing their family reunited again is more than I could have ever asked for.
“Hurry back,” Dean called after him as he strode down the hall and out of sight. He was mostly joking, of course, but a small part of him
“Dean Winchester, from District Nine, with a score of…”  Caesar pauses for dramatic effect, like he always does, and it’s agonizing.  Just get it over with.  “...nine.”
relief—is so staggering that I feel the ground start to sway beneath me.  It was all worth it.  The pain, the torture, the anguish.  All of it was beyond worth it.  I barely even notice my own injuries.  None of it matters.  I’m still alive, and Cas is, too.  That’s all I care about.  We’ll deal with the rest of it later.  For now, he needs rest, and so do I.
“With your coffee,” Cas chaffed, raising an eyebrow as Dean reached for a mug in addition to the glass already in his hand.
Pure dread seizes me as I drop the trunk and sword and shake his arm.  “Cas?”
My own terrified cry echoes in the air when he grabs my shoulders and flings me off my feet and to the ground.  Again, I try to scramble away, but he catches me, lifts up my trembling body, rams my head against the corner of a trunk.  Black spots start to dance in the corners of my vision.  A horrible blend of blood and saliva dribbles out of my mouth as I try to stand, try to rise to my feet, but nothing is working.  Nothing feels right.  It’s difficult to move my arms, my legs.  I can’t think properly.  Everything is a foggy mess.
With that thought in mind, and with heat flooding his cheeks, Dean’s face split into a soft, doting smile as he turned to glance back at Cas lying in his bed. “Love you more.”
“Even if there’s a chance I’ll make you get sick, too?” Cas asked, concern seeping into his voice now. “I’m worried you’re going to catch whatever I have.”
We share a laugh, one that rings around the open field and into the endless blue sky.  That’s one of the many things I love about Charlie.  Almost every conversation ends with a lighthearted chuckle.  She seems to bring joy everywhere she goes.
Rowena bombards me with a flood of eager questions the second the elevator doors open on our ninth floor apartment.  “How did it go?”  she chirps.  “What did you show them?  Did they say anything?  Do you think they liked you?  How do you think you did?”
All of it was worth it.
I stay silent again and brace myself for the next wave of pain.  I still wince when he nicks the spot just beneath the other.
Okay, enough sappy stuff. I hope you enjoy the chapter <3
Once again, thank you all so SO much for reading Promises of a Sacrificial Lamb!  I'm beyond happy that so many of you enjoyed this journey.  I definitely did.  And what a journey it was indeed.  Thank you for everything.  Y'all deserve the world <3
No matter how many times Dean heard Cas tell him that, it never failed to make his heartbeat quicken and his stomach do all kinds of somersaults. Once a statement uttered before a thankfully impermanent but nevertheless terrifying goodbye, and now a statement uttered spontaneously throughout their day-to-day lives, always relaxed and carefree and full of genuine warmth and devotion. Sometimes it still boggled Dean’s mind that the fantasy he always dreamed about was actually real, and he was living it right now.
I’m not surprised when Bobby stops the questions to flash me a look.  Now I’m really going to get it.
I exchange a glance with Cas.  Why not?  She seems beyond thrilled to tell us her thoughts.  Why not indulge her a little?
“Ugh, gross,” Sam said, wrinkling his nose, but despite his exterior display of disgust, there was no hiding the faint twinkle of amusement in his eyes. “All right, I get it, I get it. I’ll leave you guys to it. Holler if you need anything.” He managed to make it to the door with the rest of the groceries in hand before he whirled around and pointed an accusatory finger at Dean, who was still buried in the crook of Cas’ neck, pressing kisses to the sensitive skin, this time because he wanted to and not just to scare Sam off. “And don’t get up to anything crazy. Cas needs to rest.
Cas couldn’t help but smile against the fabric of Dean’s shirt at the thought. “Wonderful,” he sighed. With how awful he felt, cuddling up with Dean and watching movies all day long sounded absolutely divine.
It’s not always like Charlie to get sentimental, but I appreciate it nonetheless.  It’s reassuring to hear that you’re doing the right thing, and that you’re doing it well, too.  I don’t really have a choice in the matter considering my family’s circumstances, but it doesn’t bother me in the slightest.  I like my work, and it promises them food.  What more could I possibly ask for?
But I’m not allowed to.  My sluggish heart races and I’m startled back to reality when I feel Cresh—I think it’s Cresh—slap my face.  “Don’t go passing out on me, Winchester,”  he says.  His voice sounds so distant.  “I’m not done talking to you.”
“But I’m sweating, too,” Cas added miserably. He swallowed, his throat hot and swollen despite the chill that was covering him from head to toe. “I don’t know what’s happening.”
I have a younger brother—his name is Sam, and he’s my favorite person in the world next to Charlie—but he’s only twelve.  I don’t want him slaving away in these fields for at least another year or two.  He’s too delicate, and I don’t want him scratching himself up or getting heatstroke or anything else that can happen to us field workers.  Not yet.
The sound of rapid knocking startles me awake.  My heart leaps up to my throat as my eyelids snap open.  For a fleeting moment, I start to reach for something to defend myself with, but I quickly realize there’s no need to when I hear Rowena’s eager voice coming from the other side of the door.  Part of me is still in the arena, apparently.  I can’t seem to shake that lingering dread.
“Now that I have your attention, let’s chat,”  Cresh sneers.  He’s so much heavier than he looks.  “So tell me, Winchester, where’s your boyfriend?  It’s not like you to go anywhere without him.  I was hoping this could be a party of three.”
He’s going to be okay.
He asks us some of the same questions Rowena did so we can practice our new attitudes, but I end up snapping most of the answers back at him.  I don’t mean to.  My mind is just crowded with thoughts of the audience and how sick they are in the head for encouraging things like this.  I’m not mad at him or Cas.  I hope they don’t take my sudden hostility the wrong way, so I try everything I can to push my feelings aside so I don’t turn this entire practice session into a sour environment.
Side note for future readers: If you're reading this when the sequel has been published, there'll be a link somewhere in this chapter!  Probably at the beginning so it grabs your attention.  We'll see when the time comes :)
“Dean!”  my little brother Sam cries, and no, it’s not a hallucination, because I see him running toward me, arms outstretched and face slick with tears and moving as fast as his legs can carry him.
My vision starts to fade.  My breaths grow heavier, more labored.  It’s a challenge to even remember to breathe.  The pain ebbs and flows like a rippling pond.  A feeble moan slips past my lips as my eyelids begin to flutter.  I’m being pulled toward unconsciousness, and I’m not fighting it.  Anything to make this torture stop.
A rough hand seizes my shoulder and whips me around.  I come face-to-face with none other than Cresh.  I don’t even have time to process my terror before he sends his fist flying across my jaw.
I can barely move anymore.  Agonizing pain shoots through every part of my throbbing, aching body.  Taking even the smallest of breaths hurts.  Wheezes rattle in my tight throat.  Blood leaks from my nose, floods my mouth, trickles over my lips.  I clamber to my hands and knees, attempt to crawl, but to where, I have no idea.  I don’t even make it an inch before Cresh delivers a swift kick to my ribs, and I cry out, collapse to my stomach.  I don’t think there will be any getting up from this one.
Thankfully, our lighthearted conversation returns.  Some of the tension built up in my heavy chest ebbs away as we share another chuckle.
“Dean?” Cas’ ragged voice called out. The dry cough that followed sounded even closer than his voice; it only took a few seconds for Cas’ shuffling, slouched figure to appear in the doorway to the kitchen. He had bundled up in one of Dean’s old hoodies, his arms tightly wrapped around his stomach and the hood drawn up over his head. He was certainly a sight to behold, what with the sullen frown on his paling face, slightly shadowed by the hood and the hunch in his back. He looked so damn cute that Dean couldn’t help but laugh.
So thank you so SO much for all the lovely comments and the kudos!! You make a sad girl smile. I love and appreciate every single one of you more than words can describe <3
I’m not sure how long we all stand there, squeezing the life out of one another, before my mother finally releases me and plants a kiss on the top of my head.  As my father clasps my shoulder, I see Sam hurrying over to Cas and throwing his arms around his middle.  Cas seems surprised at first—I notice his eyes widen—but he doesn’t hesitate to return my little brother’s embrace.
And how do I feel about him?  Truth is, I’m not entirely sure, and trying to piece together my jumbled and messy emotions only confuses me more.  I’ve caught him staring and felt something in return, but I don’t know what.  I feel safer than ever whenever our arms are wrapped around each other, but maybe I just trust him with my life.  I enjoy his company and adore all the conversations we have, but maybe his personality is just compatible with mine.  He’s kind.  He’s caring.  He’s reliable, funny, shy, endearing.
Ten years ago—I think, but I was still a bit too young to remember for sure—following the death of President Snow, the next president proposed a new rule to spice up the Hunger Games.  We thought it was going to be something terrible, but as it turned out, she just wanted to allow two victors to win if they came from the same district.  Something about supporting new alliances and persuading teamwork and whatnot.  I don’t mind it—it’s definitely better than having to kill someone from your home—but it doesn’t change the fact that you’re still forced to participate in a televised fight to the death.  It just slightly increases your chances of winning, and I mean ever so slightly.
It wasn’t exactly what Cas wanted to hear—he wanted his own full mug of coffee, sickness and dehydration be damned—but he knew it was most likely the best he was going to get, at least without propositioning the hell out of Dean. And while Dean wasn’t usually one to turn down Cas’ advances, the rational part of Cas would’ve felt terrible for doing so over something trivial like a cup of coffee, especially when he was ill, too. So he simply nodded, accepting Dean’s kind offer, and tried to shake himself out of his sour mood. Dean was just trying to help, and Cas was, of course, incredibly grateful for his patience and generosity.
But as I tuck my ration ticket in my pocket and turn to leave the fields for the day, I can’t shake the feeling of his bright blue eyes following me as I go.
Sam loosens his grip on me when we hear approaching footsteps.  It’s my parents, and Cas’ are following closely behind.  I practically jump to my feet and collapse into my mother’s waiting arms without hesitation.  The only thing keeping me from completely crumpling to the floor in an emotional heap is her.  The way she squeezes me like she’s never going to let go.  The way she cradles my head beneath her chin, her lips pressing into my hair.  The way she soothes me, tries to calm my muffled cries, even though she’s crying herself.  Then again, I think it’s safe to say everyone is.
And that makes me realize something, something I never thought I’d experience.  As we sit here, lips pressed together, bodies close, simply grateful for one another’s presence, the realization hits me like a brick wall.  It’s so powerful that I know, without a doubt, it’s real, and I can’t help but smile against his mouth as the sensation washes over me.
Dean cracked a smile at that, his soft laugh bouncing off the walls of the kitchen, like music to Cas’ ears.
I can’t stifle a chuckle at his words.  “Good question,”  I say.  I draw a deep breath, glancing around the hushed village.  “I’m still trying to process all of this.”
Cas was wrapped up in one of the blankets they kept in the Cave for late-night movie-watching, the TV paused on an indistinguishable screen and the remote in his lap. He glanced up when Dean walked in, his face still slightly shrouded by the hoodie, but his grin was as clear as day. “I think you’ll like what I picked,” he said proudly, patting the spot on the couch beside him.
Soft spot?  What does he mean by that?  I mean, I care a lot about Cas and want to make sure he stays safe—I made a promise to myself and to his little brother—but I can’t figure out if Bobby’s words are a compliment or a snide remark.
That being said, I sincerely hope you enjoy the last chapter <3
If it weren’t for Cas’ soft, breathy chuckle, I would probably be standing there with my eyes closed for hours, just listening to those familiar sounds that I missed so dearly.  I look over and see his delighted face, his borderline disbelieving expression, and when his gaze locks with mine, I notice his eyes are glistening with tears.  Happy tears.  And I know they’re happy tears because if there weren’t cameras trained on us, I would be kissing the ground and hugging him and laughing and crying because we’re
Trying my best to focus on the tranquility of the wheat field, I toss a handful of seed heads into the burlap sack at my feet.  It’s starting to get full.  Just a few more rows of stalks, and I can call it quits for today.  I’ve probably sweat out every last bit of water in my aching body by now.
No tears ever come, just pure resentment for everyone who plays a role in creating the stupid Games.  My throat burns and stings with every breath I take.  My hands tremble.  I can’t control them.  I can’t control
I can’t help but smile as she ambles over to me, rolling up the sleeves of her flannel and swatting her hair out of her face.  “I could use an extra hand, sure.”
Bobby appears again, reminding us we have even less time to get to the Justice Building than before, and we have to leave Charlie by the train station.  As we turn to follow our mentor for the second time, she tells us she’ll be right down front, cheering her head off for us throughout the ceremony.  Coming from Charlie, I’ll expect nothing less.
So when Dean, saddened by how miserable Cas still looked, didn’t hesitate to crack open the seal on the bottle of DayQuil—Sam’s advice be damned—Cas gratefully took the little plastic cup that came with the bottle. Dean poured the correct dosage into the cup, then with a faint trace of a smile, told Cas, “Bottoms up, buddy.”
No time to think.  I’m still alive, somehow.  I have to get out of here before someone else comes running.  I pick up the bloody switchblade with my good hand, wipe it off on my pant leg.  I almost fall over when I clamber to my unsteady feet.  Frantically, my chest on fire and my entire body weak and numb and ready to collapse at any given moment, I rifle through the containers nearest to me.  I still have to find that antivenom.
He’s alive.  He’s awake.  And he looks better and healthier than I’ve ever seen him in the arena.
“It’s medicine,” Dean chuckled, setting the cup and bottle of DayQuil back on the coffee table. “I don’t know why, but it just always tastes like a corpse, no matter what kind you get.”
Slowly, trying to shake off his nerves—it was Cas, and Cas never ridiculed him—Dean drew a deep breath. He didn’t know exactly how to go about expressing what was on his mind, but he knew he needed to start somewhere, no matter what it was.
(See the end of the chapter for
The rest of the day consisted of soup for lunch—Cas thought it was delicious and thanked Dean profusely for making it—and a much-needed
now dark and rusted with age.  Clearly it’s been a while since anyone has had reason to clean it up.
While Dean appreciated Cas’ concern for him, he didn’t care about the risks. He twisted his head so Cas’ lips connected with his mouth instead of his cheek and kissed him like he meant it; whatever apprehension Cas may have had about the initial contact instantly vanished when Dean’s tongue gently licked at his bottom lip.
After she deems our walks as perfectly poised—or at least perfectly poised enough—we move onto seated posture.  She debates between a nonchalant, relaxed pose and an unbending, elegant pose for quite some time before she lets it go and just tells us to do whatever feels right, as long as we’re not slouching too much.  We just have to make sure to smile at all times and address the audience frequently.  They’re here to see and get to know us, after all, the very night before we’re sent off for slaughter.
“The keys to your new homes in the Victors’ Village.”  A proud smile dances on the mayor’s lips as he places one in Cas’ hand and one in mine.  “Welcome home, boys.  You’ve earned it.”
I tuck the switchblade into the lower pocket on my right leg.  The sound of my boots hitting the rocky ground echoes in my ringing ears as I hasten to the mouth of the Cornucopia.  It’s so quiet and desolate now, not like the very first day when the ghastly bloodbath occurred.  But there isn’t a speck of blood, a single trace as to what happened here just shy of a week ago, and it takes every last bit of power I have to push the images of what I saw out of my head.  That’s not my main focus now.  Getting the antivenom is all that matters.
As fast and sudden as lightning, Cresh stabs the knife into the ground just to the side of my head.  He hadn’t meant to go for the kill, but I still jerk away, a yelp escaping my mouth and a rush of paralyzing adrenaline flooding through my veins.  I’m faintly aware of his amused laughter as I realize I’m not dead yet.
The hallway outside was cold and barren, just like usual. Another perk of the ridiculous bunny slippers was that they kept Dean’s feet warm from the frigid tile and concrete of the bunker. Especially now that winter was on its way, Dean was becoming increasingly more grateful for them and all of their adorable absurdity. The sound of them scuffling across the floor was the only sound in the otherwise silent corridor as Dean continued toward the kitchen, where he usually found Sam drinking a cup of freshly brewed coffee or one of his bizarre health drinks. Dean didn’t catch a whiff of the delectable aroma of coffee from down the hall, so it must have been a health drink morning.
OR if you just want to check back in from time to time and skip the subscriptions altogether, that's totally cool too!  Do whatever's easiest for you!  I'm not here to pressure you into doing anything.  I'm just here to entertain with my words :)
More pain, and a sickening crunch.  Hot liquid oozes out of my nose, over my lip, into my mouth.  I can’t feel anything other than the pounding headache that worsens with every rapid beat of my heart.
good to see you,”  he pants.
I drop the switchblade, hear it clatter to the ground as I stumble backwards, off the motionless body of the boy I just murdered.  The breaths come in hysterical gasps.  Tears pour out of my eyes.  Bile rises in my constricted throat; I try to swallow it down.  I can’t breathe.  Can’t think.  Can’t believe what just happened, what I’ve just done.
Reality skids to an abrupt halt around me.  For a fleeting moment, I forget Cresh even has me pinned down.  The switchblade.  I put the switchblade in my pocket before I started searching in the containers.  And I’m still free to move my arms.  If I can reach that pocket without him noticing—
The other boy from District 1 gets a nine.  The ones from 2 also each receive nines.  Caesar gradually works his way through the list of tributes, and most of their scores range from four to seven.  One of the boys from 4 and one from 6 receive an eight, but otherwise, the scores are rather low.  I feel like I should be relieved by this, but I can’t, not when the reveal of our scores creeps closer and closer with every passing second.
“What are you doing up?” he managed to say in between his enamored chuckles, the biggest smile adorning his face as he took in the sight of his glowering, dismal
“Just when I thought I couldn’t feel any worse,” Cas grumbled as he rubbed the sleepiness out of his eyes and attempted to push himself upright. A cough rumbled through his throat as he did, but it didn’t sound nearly as bad as it had during the night. That was a positive, at least.
I, since I’m sixteen and have been taking tesserae for years, will have my name in there twenty-five times.  It might as well be fifty.
It doesn’t sound half bad.  I suppose he’s right about that.  Just another hoop we have to jump through before we finally get the chance to live in peace and quiet, or at least attempt to.  Regardless, I don’t object—neither does Cas—when Bobby takes my crown off the bedside table.  Cas’ must still be in his room.
“Oh no, it’s three a.m.,” Cas whimpered, the mere thought of being kept awake for so long making his tired eyes burn with tears. And once that first tear fell and slipped down his cheek, there was no stopping the dam he’d just opened up.
A bout of silence falls over the three of us, only broken by the soft humming of the train.  I draw a deep breath and spare a glance out the window, my adrenaline spiking when I see the beautifully familiar hills of District 9.  The sky is so blue.  The land is so untouched, so vast.  I swear it’s been centuries since I last set foot in those rolling fields, and we’re so close to them that it makes my fingers twitch with anticipation.
Then he takes the knife and drives it right through my left palm and into the ground below it.
It turned out to be a great plan, and an even better day. After Cas won the battle against his initial morning fatigue, Dean helped him take a new dose of daytime medicine, which went to work on making Cas feel better much quicker than he expected. By the time he’d eaten the piece of butter toast Dean had made and brought to him, his incessant urge to cough had decreased drastically. And it was easier than ever to ignore his aching body when Dean set his laptop on the foot of the bed and loaded up
I faintly hear our escort welcoming the crowd and their cheers in response as I rub my eyes, desperately hoping my skin isn’t too blotchy from all the tears I shed.  Cas, as always, looks great, even with his puffy eyes, but if how hot and swollen my face feels is anything to go on, I’m sure I look like a speckled tomato.  Crowley and my prep team would probably have a cow if they saw how I looked right before a big ceremony like this.  Then Rowena’s introducing us, singing praises about us and how we’re her favorite pair of tributes in the history of the Games, and we have no choice but to take the stage with her and the mayor.
As the end of our session nears, Rowena has one more thing she wants to go over with us.  Apparently she’s put a lot of thought and effort into it because she pulls out a small notebook and flips through the pages, an eager grin lighting up her face.
I have nothing else to throw, nothing else to take my anger and frustration out on.  So instead, I pick up a pillow, collapse to the floor, and scream into the fabric until my throat is raw.
But I suppose we have to start somewhere, and checking out our new houses in the Victors’ Village is as good a place as any.
This has to be a dream.  This has to be some cruel, vivid hallucination caused by my head injuries.  There’s no way this is happening.  I never heard another cannon.  He can’t be dead.  He can’t be.  I survived the feast, got him the antivenom, made it back in one piece, just like I promised.  He can’t be—
My blood chills to ice.  I can’t move, can’t breathe, but I don’t even need to see the owner of the knife to know who that cold voice belongs to.
It only took a second for Dean to react, but even that felt far too long. He scrambled to flip over and turn the alarm clock around so the numbers couldn’t be seen, then hurried to pull the trembling Cas into his chest. “It’s okay, sweetheart. The time doesn’t matter,” Dean soothed, but he struggled to mask the crack in his voice when Cas’ hot tears instantly soaked into his shirt. “Don’t worry about the time. We can sleep in. We’re not going anywhere tomorrow. We can stay in bed all day if you want, yeah? How does that sound?”
I sincerely hope she’s right about that.
It’s about a twenty minute walk from the Justice Building to the village.  I’ve never been there myself, but I know of its location, the peacefully secluded area surrounded by lush trees and colorful flowers.  When Cas and I reach the old iron gate protecting it from the rest of the district, I find myself gazing up at the once-golden metal letters spelling out
Something catches my eye, something lying on the ground and glinting in the light that’s peering through the curtain of vines.  I shift to get a closer look—every muscle in my body screams at the slightest movement—and I see that it’s an opened locket.
Then my mind wanders away from the twisted Capitol citizens and focuses on home.  Whenever feasts happen, almost everyone gathers in the square to watch, especially if their own tributes are still alive.  I wonder if the people of District 9 are gathering there now, watching in fear and apprehension as I make my way to the Cornucopia in search of that vital antivenom.  Is my family there, surrounded by the support of the rest of the district?  Charlie, too?  What about Cas’ family?  I can’t even imagine what they must be going through right now.  So much rests on this one feast.  My life, Cas’ life.  Whatever happens in that glade is going to decide whether or not District 9 has a shot at obtaining new victors.
At first startled by Dean’s sudden appearance, and then amused by his petty annoyance, Sam cracked a smile. “Well, good morning to you, too,” he teased. “I just got out of the shower. Didn’t think you’d be up for another couple of hours, so forgive me for forgetting the coffee, Your Highness.”
I’ve fallen for the boy from the fields.
It’s almost impossible to keep up my defiance when he leans down, close to my face, a murderous glint in his eyes.  “But let’s have some fun first,”  he purrs.  “I’m gonna ask you some more questions.  Every time you don’t answer me, I’m gonna put another cut on that pretty face of yours.  How does that sound?”
It’s a miracle I’m able to stay on my feet as I blunder through the dense rainforest.  The world spins in violent circles.  I keep running into trees, stumbling over ferns and roots.  My skull hammers with every rapid, heavy beat of my heart, but I don’t slow down.  I can’t.  I have to make it back to the hollow before I collapse.
Beside him, he heard Dean try and fail to stifle a sleepy chuckle. “Oh, man, I forgot you’ve never had a human sickness before,” he remarked, the amusement clear in his tone.
Dean barely managed to feel Cas nod against his chest, but it didn’t offer the former much comfort when Cas only seemed to sob harder after that. Dean didn’t know what to do other than hold Cas tightly in his arms while he shuddered and cried, pressing gentle kisses to the top of Cas’ head, whispering lulling words against Cas’ hair, and even though deep down Dean knew he was doing all that he could, in his heart it just wasn’t enough.
I bet they’re ecstatic about the reaping tomorrow.
There’s only one way to find out.  We eat an expeditious dinner and gather in the living room to wait for the nationwide broadcast to begin.  I sit on the sofa in between Rowena and Cas.  Bobby, Crowley, and Meg all occupy velvety bean bag chairs.  Hardly anyone speaks as we anticipate the scoring.
“Welcome to the crew, Novak,”  Charlie says, giving him a hard pat on the back.  “There’s no escape for you now.”
Now it’s my turn to decide on an approach.  I’m fresh out of ideas, so I won’t be of assistance.  I’m not bold and arrogant like the Careers.  I’m not hilarious or witty.  I’m certainly not flirtatious or coy like Rowena seems to think so.  I’m just me, plain and simple.  I don’t know how we’re supposed to translate that into a specific behavior for the audience, the deranged people who will practically be leaning out of their seats to get to know us before they watch us fight to the death on live television the following morning.
There are occasional knocks on my door; I make no effort to let anyone come in.  One of them is probably Cas wanting to make sure I’m okay, but I don’t want him in here.  I’m not mad at him by any means.  He did nothing wrong, but my mental state is far from stable.  I don’t want to accidentally yell at him.
“It’s good to see you, too,”  I hear Cas say with a faint laugh.
It’s almost too overwhelming to handle.
“Good idea. Staying hydrated is one of the best things you can do when you’re sick,” Sam agreed. He drained the last little bit of his health drink, then stood to set it in the sink. “I could run out and pick up some medicine, too. I know you probably want to stay here with him, and I need to make a supply run anyway, so…”
They kept the ball rolling on their pleasant day thus far when they returned to the bunker and Dean started making preparations for homemade pasta. Homemade chicken noodle soup sounded delicious for dinner, and Cas had zero complaints whatsoever when Dean brought it up to him. But since it wouldn’t be ready for a long while, Sam offered to blend Cas a fruit smoothie for lunch. Yet another thing Cas didn’t have any complaints about. He sipped on his cold, refreshing smoothie while he watched Dean make pasta and while Sam quietly read a book in the corner of the kitchen. None of them spoke much, but it didn’t matter.
“Well, you look excited, so it must be a good one,” Dean remarked, unable to suppress a smile of his own as he handed Cas the glass of water and plopped down next to him, careful not to spill anything. Especially the coffee.
Some might say I’m too protective of him, but in the state of the world we live in, it’s hard not to be.
For a moment, when Cas stayed silent, Dean was terrified to turn back and meet Cas’ eyes. What if he didn’t like the idea? What if he didn’t want to live in a real house with Dean? What if he thought the whole thing was stupid, and now Dean had ruined everything, and—
Some of you may have heard, but. . .drum roll please. . .I'm working on a sequel for this story!!  I wasn't ready to say goodbye to this universe and our favorite boys quite yet (and neither have a lot of you guys) so why should we?  Let's keep it rolling.  Plus I had a lot of ideas for a sequel while I was writing this story, and I don't want them to go to waste.  So yeah!!  I'm very excited for a sequel, and I really hope y'all are too!! :)
Is there seriously no one else here?  It can’t be that straightforward.  Where’s the entertainment in that?  I mean, it’s fantastic for me, but maybe the Gamemakers really overestimated the needs of the rest of the tributes.  Maybe I’m the only one who’s desperate right now.
Until next time!  And may we meet again in the next story I write <3
I comb out the knots in my hair.  While Cas combs his, I return to the bedside table and grab my silver locket.  There’s no way I’m leaving this train without it.  I’m just clipping it around my neck when there’s another knock on the door.
But no pressure or anything, right?
The next time Dean woke up, groggy and unsure of how many hours had passed, Cas was still asleep and wedged right up against him, his lips parted and his closed eyes puffy. He was also extremely warm to the touch, heat radiating off his body, and being in such close proximity was starting to make Dean sweat. He wanted to get up, cool off, maybe go refill Cas’ water glass, but he was terrified of moving and waking Cas up after the dreadful night he’d had.
Dean quickly matched Cas’ excitement when he realized the movie Cas had picked out was
on who’s going to win?  It’s morally wrong on every single spectrum I can come up with.  Capitol citizens aren’t humans.  They’re a completely different breed, and it’s a kind I would never want to meet in a dark alley.
“You’re gonna be in the square tomorrow, right?”  I ask her.  Even though she won’t be lumped together with the rest of us unlucky boys, I’ll still feel better if I know she’s in the area, just for comfort and support.
A small surge of relief courses through me when Cas nods his head, his shoulders heaving with a sigh.  “Me too.”
Cas managed a faint nod, squinting up at Dean through the darkness and the pain swimming behind his eyes. “All right,” he murmured. “Thank you.”
But when we push the gate open and step into the village, its appearance is nothing like the letters would allude to.  Although the cobblestone path is cracked in places, it’s still rather intact and spans the stretch of the village.  Twelve massive houses—more like mansions, really—line the path.  Six on one side, and six on the other.  They tower so high and look so pristine and untouched that I can’t stop my jaw from dropping at the sight.  All of them are dark and silent, seeing as no one else lives here except for Bobby, but that does nothing to alter their grandeur.  I haven’t even stepped inside, and I already know that I could probably fit three of my family’s old houses into one of these mansions.  I can only imagine what waits for us inside.
“Up, up, up!”  our escort chirps, muffled by the walls of the room that’s flooded with bright morning sunlight.  “We’ll be at the train station in less than thirty minutes!”
The nights seemed to keep getting better with time. Cas still took a dose of NyQuil, just to be on the safe side, but he found himself not coughing nearly as much as the nights prior. A few terrible ones jolted him awake every now and then, but it wasn’t unbearable. Maybe, with a bit of luck as well as Dean’s continued care, his sickness wouldn’t last a full week after all.
I press the button to release the blade and drive it into Cresh’s stomach as hard as I can.
“Got it,” Sam said with a salute, heading for the doorway. “All right, I’m out. If you think of anything else, just text me.”
That’s wishful thinking on my part.
The next time I wake up, it’s early evening.  I was out almost the entire day.  Shadows pool onto the ground, line the walls of the hollow.  The nighttime birds begin their songs.  Insects chirp and buzz.  The hot, muggy air has started to cool off.  The pain in my head is almost unbearable, still throbbing with every heartbeat.  My stiff and sore body aches more than ever.
“Do I need to make myself look like Will Turner to win your affection?” Dean teased, grinning wickedly over his coffee mug. He took it as a win that he didn’t get nearly as upset by Cas’ comment as he did before. Partly because he’d been half-expecting it this time, and partly because it was simply just the truth.
Instead of seeming surprised or relieved, as Cas had expected, Dean only smirked over the brim of his mug, his eyes twinkling with roguery. “Told you I had a steel immune system,” he teased.
Cas rolled his eyes, but a smile stretched across his face nonetheless. “Any requests?” he asked as he backed up into the hallway and stuffed his hands into the pockets of the hoodie.
Despite how godawful Cas felt—and it just seemed to be getting worse by the minute—he couldn’t help but crack a small smile at Dean’s playfully smug comment. “I’m doomed,” he deadpanned.
A smile tries to form on my face, but it’s fleeting.  There are so many conflicting emotions, so many confusing feelings, rampaging around inside of me.  The warmth is the strongest it’s ever been.  My heart is pounding so fast that I can’t keep track of its beats anymore.  We’re both still alive.  That’s fantastic.  Of course I’m overjoyed, but I can’t ignore a pang of fearful uncertainty.  What would’ve happened if I had died back in the Cornucopia, or I’d been too late to return to the hollow?  Losing Cas is unimaginable.  I can’t even bear to think about it.  So what is this unfamiliar feeling I was trying so hard to decipher before I arrived at the golden horn?
Cas returns to the apartment almost exactly fifteen minutes after I did.  I try to read his expression as Rowena excitedly motions for him to join us, but it’s indecipherable.  I hope his session went okay.
If looks could kill, Dean probably would’ve been obliterated on the spot. Cas stared him down with the nastiest glare, his indignant eyes narrowed into dangerous slits and his jaw clenched and his nostrils flared. He looked, quite frankly, ready to murder for a cup of coffee, and while Dean understood where he was coming from—he got cranky without his coffee, too—he didn’t want to risk dehydrating Cas when his sick body needed all the fluids it could get.
I’m startled back to the present, to the quiet room, when Bobby takes a step toward us, gesturing at something behind us.  “I can hold onto your crowns and take them to the Victors’ Village, if you want,”  he says.  “That way you won’t have to worry about them during the homecoming ceremony.”
Dean. Meaning no inappropriate activities. Don’t push him.”
Dean choked on another laugh, sounding like a mix of surprise, levity, and compassion all wrapped up into one chuckle. “No, no, babe, this isn’t the end for you,” he reassured. He sat up halfway and scooted closer to Cas, then leaned down to press a gentle kiss to his hairline. “You’re just sick. Just a little fever, or flu, or whatever. It sucks, but it’s nothing to worry about, especially when you have me to take care of you.”
“Thank you for everything, Dean,” Cas made sure to add. “I know I would’ve been much, much worse without your generosity.”
It doesn’t work.  Unbridled panic surges through me when Cresh snatches the fabric of my shirt and yanks me to my feet.  He slams me against the hard wall of the Cornucopia, pins me to it with his powerful arms.  The back of my head ricochets off the metal, sends a wave of unbearable agony through my skull, makes my vision spin.  My eyes barely have a second to focus before another punch lands on my nose.
“You know,”  I hear Cresh say over the shrill screeching in my ears, “it wasn’t very nice of you to run away from me during the bloodbath.  Made me feel like you didn’t want to hang out with me.”
BUT, please check back in tomorrow for a very big surprise and the final notes update!  I hope you'll be there because I really don't want you to miss it :)
Cas smiled, his heart already hammering against his ribs at the recurring thought of buying a real house with Dean, a place of their own they could live in forever. Dean, of course, was just as eager and ecstatic, but he hadn’t yet browsed the online market. He’d been too nervous, too giddy, wanting to wait until he was with Cas so they could pick out the perfect one together.
“Yes.” Dean sighed and rubbed his eyes. “Didn’t do much good apparently.”
“Cas, can I talk to you about something?” Dean asked. He tried his best to hide the worry in his voice, but he couldn’t hide the way he was wringing his hands in his lap.
Since there weren’t many people working in the fields today, Charlie and I receive extra for braving the intense heat and bringing in a couple of hefty burlap sacks full of seed heads.  It isn’t much, just a few small loaves of bread and a ration ticket to trade in the market for a generous serving of lamb stew and a can of beans, but we’ll take anything we can get.
Even though I can’t see her, I know there’s a smirk on Charlie’s face.  I can hear it in her voice.  “Right back at you, Winchester.”
I gently shut the locket, hold it in my good hand for a moment longer, try to calm my frayed nerves.  Then, without a word, I take the chain of the necklace and clip it back around Cas’ neck.
When Cas made no effort to move again, completely drained and exhausted from all the coughing and shivering, Dean gingerly carded his fingers through Cas’ damp hair. “I’ll go get you something to drink,” he said at last. “And maybe bully Sam into going out to get you some medicine. Medicine will make you feel better, too.”
from me, and they expect me to just chat and laugh along with Caesar Flickerman like there’s nothing at stake?  Like my life won’t be on the line in less than a day?  They’re crazier than I thought if they really expect any of us to be calm and rational during those ridiculous interviews.
Cas hummed against Dean’s shoulder, still shivering slightly but relishing the comforting warmth of Dean’s body. “What should I do?” he murmured after a moment of quiet, absentmindedly rubbing small circles on Dean’s back.
As time passed at the slow, agonizing pace of a snail—but not once did Dean ever let Cas go to look at the clock—Cas eventually cried himself dry and subsequently fell asleep nestled in Dean’s chest, his face still flushed and stained with tear tracks. Nevertheless, he looked much calmer, more at peace, now that he was getting the rest he desperately needed, and that was enough for Dean to allow himself to sleep, too.
Cas must sense my nerves.  As the Peacekeepers send us on our way, he slips his hand into mine and flashes me the most reassuring smile he can muster up.  But I know he’s nervous, too.  I can see the uneasiness glimmering behind his eyes.  This is the first time in weeks that we’ve been free to do whatever we please without being toyed with like puppets on a string.  Now the strings have finally been cut, but with it almost comes a sense of helplessness.  While we’re not entirely free—no victor ever is—there’s no longer a schedule controlling our lives.  So what do we do?  How do we spend our time?  How do we start living normally again when a couple weeks ago, we were terrified we would never even leave the arena where twenty-two other boys met their ends?  It’s all so overwhelming.  I don’t know how to wrap my head around it.
Curiosity gets the better of me.  I pick it up, gaze down at the photos tucked inside, just like mine.  There’s a picture of his parents, wearing the same faint smiles as my parents in my locket.  Then there’s a picture of little Gabriel, and of someone I don’t know.  My heart pangs when I realize it must be his older brother Michael, the one who didn’t survive his Games six years ago.
Cas wasn’t entirely convinced at first—he was practically built to worry about his family—but he knew Dean was right. Aside from the leftover medicine, Sam was an overall very healthy person. He would probably bounce back even quicker than Cas had. It would just take a bit of time, just like it had for Cas.
His district partner.  He must’ve been waiting nearby.
I think Rowena forgot she was holding onto my hand because when she jumps up to give a squeal of delight, she almost rips my shoulder out of its socket.  But I barely notice.  I’m too overwhelmed with a surge of conflicting emotions.
That pleased, smug smirk still plastered on Sam’s face, the younger Winchester moved to pluck the hastily-written grocery list from beneath a magnet on the fridge. “I’ll be back in a bit,” he said. “Is there anything else you want me to pick up while I’m out?”
“I know you’re not happy about all of this, Dean,”  he says in a shockingly gentle voice.  I’m taken aback.  “The Games are getting closer.  There’s a lot of pressure.  I know how you’re feeling, but at least try to pretend like you’re having a decent time.  It’s a reality show.  All these people want is a little fun.”
The playfully fearful glance Cas sends my way only elicits another laugh.  But then he grins, lets out a chuckle of his own, looks genuinely happy to be trapped in Charlie’s tight embrace.  At this rate, who knows?  Maybe they’ll be even better friends than I anticipated.  And in all honesty, I would love nothing more.
We’ve only made it halfway to the exit when I hear his voice.  The voice I feared I would never hear again.  The voice so small and so sweet that the instant I hear it, I freeze in place, worried it’s some cruel hallucination meant to toy with me.
Dean only realized the magnitude of the movie-picking freedom he’d given Cas when he saw Cas flash him an arch smirk before turning and disappearing down the hall. Silently praying he wasn’t about to be subjected to hours worth of cheesy rom-coms—but he wouldn’t hesitate to do it if it made Cas feel better—Dean filled the glass with water from the sink faucet, then poured a substantial amount of piping hot coffee into his mug. Just a dash of creamer, too, because Cas liked it that way. Of course Dean was going to let him have a few sips once he finished the glass of water. How could Dean say no to a face like that?
That night wasn’t quite as dreadful as the previous, though falling asleep still proved to be a bit of a challenge. The nasty wet cough from before made its unfortunate return, but Cas, although deflated by its recurrence, was more prepared for it this time. With the nighttime medicine, his newfound preparedness, and Dean’s everlasting comfort and consolation, Cas was asleep by one.
“Why should we play along?”  My blood starts to boil.  I can’t stop myself.  “These people took us from our homes, our families, just so they can, what?  Dress us up in costumes and pretend to care about our feelings and who we are and then turn around and place bets on how long we’ll live?  How are we supposed to play along with people like that?  It’s stupid!  It’s stupid and horrible and morbid!”
So, I'll be back for the next update on Saturday, July 11! Until then, hang in there, stay frosty, all that jazz. Love you <3
Rowena is on her feet again.  The congratulatory praises echo through the air, and I give a wide-eyed Cas a hefty pat on the shoulder.  We both pulled great scores for people who just started training a few days ago.  Being fast learners has its perks, doesn’t it?  I’m proud of him for braving the weapons and stepping out of his comfort zone.  He should’ve gotten a higher score than me for his incredible accuracy with the knives, but an eight is still remarkable.  He deserves it.
had breakfast already, because he was one of those kinds of people. The kind Dean sometimes wished he could be, but sleeping in was something he just couldn’t bring himself to sacrifice, especially now that he had someone to always wake up wrapped around. That was definitely a big part of it.
“Breakfast,” Sam proclaimed with a grin, handing Dean a container with two blueberry muffins inside. He then pulled a shiny red apple from the bag and gave it to Cas. “Just a little something-something to put in your stomach since you probably don’t feel too great. I’m sure you’ll be able to bug Dean into making you some soup later, anyway.”
Cas just stared back at him, silent, contemplating his words, eyebrows ever so slightly furrowed with confusion. Much to Dean’s dismay, Cas didn’t seem to be picking up what he was putting down. That meant Dean was just going to have to come right out and say it, regardless of how heavy his tongue felt in his dry mouth.
The moment I twist the key in the doorknob and Cas and I head inside, we’re greeted with a lavish foyer and an imposing granite staircase leading to the second story.  Above us, hanging from the tall ceiling, is a sparkling chandelier.  Below us is a stretch of dark hardwood floor so polished that I’m almost afraid I might slip on it.  A princely kitchen, a cozy living room with a striking brick fireplace, and a short corridor leading to another set of unexplored rooms make up the first level.  We’re completely surrounded by luxury, riches we couldn’t even begin to imagine owning a few weeks ago.  It’s no wonder the mere sight of this foyer renders me speechless, and Cas simply breathes out an impressed “whoa.”  There’s so much to take in.
Dean practically inhaled his muffin as the movie played on. Cas, on the other hand, ate more slowly, his upset stomach not doing him any favors. He kept drinking his water as much as he could, taking the juicy apple one bite at a time, then munching on the muffin in between. By the time he finally finished his food and water, he was only feeling marginally better. He was still shivering, albeit much less aggressively. He was still nauseated. His head still hurt, and his body still ached, and he was so dejected that he felt that way that he wanted to completely curl up into Dean’s side and go right back to sleep. He didn’t even want the last few sips of Dean’s coffee anymore. That was how he knew it was bad.
But no, none of those things are what roused me.  When I completely come to, when my numb senses struggle to return to normal, my blurry vision focuses on Cas, his concerned expression as he crawls to kneel at my side.
I find the antivenom in the second container I try.  It’s in a small trunk, a syringe filled with blue liquid.  I toss a few strewn bottles of painkillers into the trunk as well as the knife and switchblade, close it up, and hasten out of the mouth of the Cornucopia as fast as my tortured body will allow.  It’s difficult to ignore the two bodies of the boys from District 1 as I stagger out into the open air.
Charlie Bradbury is definitely what one would call a unique girl.  Vibrant ginger hair and skin so pale she practically glows in the sunlight.  An attitude so incredibly strong and fierce that no one questioned her when she marched up to the granary owner at age twelve and asked for a job in the fields, which is usually dominated by boys.  A sense of humor so dry and witty that she can make anyone laugh at the drop of a hat.  A love for her friends so extreme that I’ve never had to doubt her loyalty, her care for me, and I can only hope that I’ve given her that same trust.
Rowena is already waiting for us behind the Justice Building, along with the mayor.  He swiftly shakes our hands, congratulates us on our victory, thanks us for bringing pride and hope to District 9 for the first time in years.  I’m not sure how to respond to a compliment like that—and the stunned look on Cas’ face tells me he doesn’t, either—but thankfully, we don’t have to.  Rowena is gushing about how excited she is to start the ceremony, and she doesn’t waste a single second in doing so.  She’s toddling up onto the stage in front of the building before I can even fully process what the mayor said.
