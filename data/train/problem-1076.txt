“When did you record me playing?”
but I’m not paying attention. I unzip my bag, busying myself with nothing. Glancing over my shoulder, I see him stride over to the bed, throw his bag at the foot, and stretch. He says nothing. Eventually, he turns, looks up, and simply asks:
I long for the familiarities of home. It’s strange what crosses your mind after such a traumatising event, sudden glimpses of tea trays and sandwiches, care of Mrs Hudson, as well as half-drunken cups of tea left all over our flat. All of the seemingly dull and useless pieces that make up everyday life at Baker Street filter into my mind and I realise that I miss it.
Now, I find myself standing on the very edge of the unknown. As I open the door to our shared quarters, my heart drops into the pit of my stomach. In the centre of the room is a single solitary bed. My mouth runs dry, and I can’t help thinking about the awkward silence as we’d made our way here. The air between us had seemed uncomfortable, holding a static electricity, something unidentifiable fractured between us. The entire journey felt as if it was teetering off balance. Still, it had been more encouraging than the conversation I’d overheard downstairs.
I don’t sleep that night. When John walks back down the stairs the next morning, I’m at the window, idly picking at the strings of my violin. He comments on it, but I’m not listening, lost in the depths of my mind palace. If that was everything — if I will never again see the stretch of John’s bare skin beneath me; hear his breath hitch in his chest as I trail kisses down his throat, then I will damn well memorise every second of it. There is now a box in John’s wing, filled with data, every sound he made and each sensation of his lips on mine. It’s tucked between the catalogue of his jumpers and the list of all his favourite foods.
“I’m going to help you get undressed. Is that okay?”
He takes a step backwards, and with one last cursory glance at my body, steps out of the shower as silently as he arrived. John is gone and, once again, I’m left alone with my thoughts. I throw a hand out behind me, steadying myself against the wall; knees weak. I close my eyes, committing every second to memory. The heated gazes and insatiable hunger leaves with him and I’m not exactly certain how I feel about it. It’s somehow worse than the last time, and Irene’s sultry voice echoes behind my half-lidded gaze as I lower myself to the bench seat in the corner of the bathtub.
“Your little ‘trip’...” John prompts again, shifting his weight as he tries a new tactic. “You saved her, didn’t you?”
John is already up when I wake, fully dressed and folding his remaining clothes back into his suitcase. He gives a warm good morning, sounding as if this could be the start of any other day. It’s a complete juxtaposition from the John I saw last night; the one caught in the claws of his terror; choking on his nightmares.
“No, I want to. I just — I didn’t realise I helped that much.”
After a conversation with his father goes awry, Sherlock finds himself even more frustrated with the state of his future. As part of his aristocratic duties, he reluctantly attends his father’s garden party with his childhood friend turned fiancée with every intention of sneaking out into London as soon as he gets the chance. However, a chance meeting with a handsome soldier alters his plans and promises a very interesting development as the evening progresses.
After all, who else was going to keep the world's greatest detective in line?
Special thanks to my beta @MsScarlet for all the hard work she does in keeping this from being a disaster and for helping me keep things immersive when I need it most! She's the real MVP of this work!
I froze, my hand hanging in the air. Was it that obvious? Had my carefully constructed facade started to slip?
The two men who own the inn had obviously been involved with one another for quite some time and were happy to attach their own comfortable openness to us as well. This, however, did not seem to impress John in the slightest. I’d forgotten how much those comments got under his skin. I overheard what he’d said to the innkeeper when he’d insinuated we’d been together.
I will always refrain until the day comes when he asks me not to.
There was no ’gigantic hound’; there had never been a ‘gigantic hound’. Archaic phrasing as I had pointed out when Henry had visited Baker Street to request my assistance. The words themselves were enough to tip off even the dimmest of researchers, so why had my mind thrown all of my previous knowledge out the window? Had I been drugged? Had a foreign substance been slipped into my drink or something?
My brain strays once again, but I shrug it off as common practice between human males.
I am woken by the mattress dipping as John perches on the edge of the bed, pulling his tee-shirt back on over his head. I reach out and touch the base of his spine, running my fingers over each vertebra and remembering the exact curve of his back as we’d come together — John’s fingers tangled with mine, our hands fisted firmly around our aligned lengths as he’d worked us both to orgasm. He jumps at the touch, turning guiltily as if he hadn’t expected me to wake up.
“I never had any chance with you, did I?”
He shushes me. It isn’t stern or uncaring, but I obey, realising then how silent our encounter has actually been. Not a single word has been spoken until now, and I can’t help the curiosity that overthrows my pleasure.
“I thought I was going to lose you.” He says into my collarbone. My chin rests on his head, hair tickling my skin. It’s an odd yet welcome sensation, having him in my arms like this. I’m not quite sure what it means, but I don’t have much time to think about it before the moment shifts.
Pure love and affection swelled in John's chest and he felt a surge of something curious deep in his belly. He honestly hadn't expected anything from Sherlock after the night before, where they'd spent a large majority of their time experimenting with ropes as Sherlock had driven him completely out of his mind, but, as usual, the detective never ceased to amaze him.
His heavy cock rests in the crease of my thigh, his hips rutting steadily against me, and my body practically sings for him. I surprise myself when my back arches involuntarily, pressing the length of my own erection against John’s belly in a desperate attempt to seek friction, and, once I’ve found it, the world around me seems to tilt upside down.
“Surprised by what?”
Sherlock’s arrogant little smirk was enough to kick John’s own dominant streak up a notch as he sat up, gesturing to the bed with the jerk of his head. “Switch places with me and let me tie this around your head,” he said, unfolding the silk cloth. “I’ll put this on then you can lie down.”
John is a doctor. That means that John is nothing but thoroughly serious where sex is concerned.
I don’t tell him that the real reason I don’t sleep is because the bed feels empty without him. If I sink into the mattress, all I can feel are the echoes of him; faint ghosts of his touch on my skin, the shadow of his lips on my neck. I’m not sure what is worse; never having him, or being given a taste of what could have been and having it ripped away from me.
“I didn’t say anything.”
“When did he get you?” I ask, my voice soft against the pillow.
The tip of Sherlock's cock slammed into the back of John's throat hard enough to nearly cause him to black out, but a strangled whimper pulled him back from the darkness. Tears stung his eyes just as Sherlock's body convulsed and a thick pulse of semen painted his tongue. John moaned softly, relishing the taste and eagerly sucking his lover dry as best he could with one hand gripping his lover's erection and the other clutching the bedsheets for stability.
The question shouldn't have been as suggestive as it was, but Sherlock knew John better than anyone else in the world. Knowing how seriously he took his reputation concerning his military rank, and how careful he was with the way he carried himself brought a whole new aspect to the table. His willingness to steal something so simple yet seemingly sultry from the monarchy was definitely outside of John's comfort zone, but Sherlock had stolen that ashtray for him all those years ago, so it was only fitting that John returned the favour on their visit the previous morning.
The chilly liquid pools generously in the centre of my palm, yet, even as a shiver makes its way through my own body, I still can’t take my eyes off of John. He’s beautiful like this, like some sort of mind-boggling enigma that I could explore every nook and cranny of and still never understand completely. I still don’t understand the meaning behind this unexpected yet fortunate turn of events, but I force the lingering shadows of doubt from my mind. From the subtle twist of his wrist on the upstroke to the gentle flick of his thumb over his slit, John Watson demands my undivided attention and he’s going to get it.
Tentatively, he wraps his arms around my waist and rests his forehead against my chest, letting out a long sigh into the creases of my pyjamas.
The thought dawns on me a moment too late, however, and I don't have time to analyse it before John's body slams into mine. I brace for the impact, flinching in anticipation of yet another fist to the face, but it never comes. John's lips cover mine in a searing kiss instead, nipping and lapping at my bottom lip as his fingers curl into the collar of my bloodstained shirt.
“You were thinking.” A pyjama-clad arm still covers his eyes, but I see a strained smile creep out from under his sleeve. “Alright, you have questions.”
I have always been able to hide my emotions — ‘Divorce myself from my feelings’ as I call it, never allowing myself to emit human responses to the mundane irrationalities that most were so often getting hung up over. I considered myself to be above such things, yet, this time, I had slipped. I’d let myself be fooled by my own imagination into thinking that I had seen something that I couldn’t possibly have.
A well-timed growl rumbles around my cock, sending a mind-blowing vibration throughout my entire body and I’m surprised at the broken whimper that leaves my throat. It’s low and needy and not like me at all but John’s fingers dig into my hip as he bobs his head even faster. I can feel the back of his throat as the tip of my cock brushes repeatedly against it and my hips falter in their own thrusts, calling to question when I had even begun to move them in the first place.
Every fibre of my being is on high alert. The heady scent of lavender foam is scrubbed over the planes of my back and into the curves of my arse with a slight hint of enthusiasm shrouded in a faint shadow of medical professionalism. His doctor’s hands work over the backs of my legs as he kneels down behind me, yet something still doesn’t fit. He washes me from top to bottom before tapping my hip with a gentle hand.
Short, concentrated puffs of breath confirm his persistence before his lips even brush the newly cleaned skin of my shoulder blade.
John’s breathing is loud in the darkness; desperate pants, his lungs trying to offset the adrenaline in his blood. He turns slowly around the room, blinking away the shadows of terror, tearing himself away from the horrors of his mind.
‘Captain John Watson, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers’ to be exact.
“Right, fine. Guess you’re just not saying anything,” he huffs, turning his back to me for a moment, which was becoming quite the customary alternative to discussing anything remotely related to emotions. Another sigh, another huff. “Honestly, it’s… It’s fine… You keep your secrets, I’ll keep mine.”
At first, a fresh wave of jealousy washes over me as the memory twists in my mind’s eye, and I fight the urge to bite my lip. John does it for me, however, and the soft moan that slips from my throat seems to surprise us both. Is this what it felt like for her? Is this what it felt like for Sarah to have John Watson lavishing his full attention on her? A small part of me can’t help but wonder, if I hadn’t brushed off John’s obvious — yet completely ridiculous — attempt at flirting on the night we met, would it have been me that night on the sofa with him after the Black Lotus kidnapping?
The tip of my cock twitches violently and a deep, throaty moan — unlike any sound I’ve ever made before — escapes my lips as John’s tongue dips teasingly into my leaking slit. He laps experimentally at my glans before drawing his tongue back and licking a wide stripe up the underside of my cock. My toes curl, my back arches, and my head hits the tiles with a sharp crack but neither of us pays it much attention. I’m too lost in the sensation of John’s mouth as his lips close around my glans and I swear my body feels more alert than it ever has in my entire life. I’m hyper-aware of every minute movement now, every flick of John's tongue, every shallow breath he takes, every single fibre of my being honing in on every aspect of John and it’s almost as if he’s found a way to ignite my very soul with something so desperately improper.
Something soars in my stomach, and I reach out in answer, wrapping a hand around his wrist and pulling him towards me. John finally turns, and the look on his face sends a shiver down my spine. He is so open, vulnerability painted across his features, a shadow of fear dancing behind his eyes. The underbelly of humanity may haunt John’s dreams, but he is petrified of this intimacy, this unnamed emotion that he can’t fuck away. I don’t know whoever made him feel this way, who convinced him that he is broken for wanting this, but I desperately hope I never meet them.
His eyelids start to droop, the body’s natural reaction to being tense for so long. It’s concerning yet comforting all at once, and I can feel my fears beginning to recede. Once all the soap suds have been washed from his skin, I drain the bath and help him to his feet.
He makes it barely 500 metres before he stops dead in his tracks, a low whining drifting through the air. My heart leaps into my mouth as I realise what’s about to happen. He takes one more calculated step forward, and the bomb explodes beneath his feet.
Sherlock and John take a walk and get to know each other, but someone takes an interest in their budding new friendship.
I stare at the ceiling, wide awake, wishing I could understand what’s going on in his head. Is he in the kitchen now, having the exact same argument with himself? Or has he already forgotten what transpired? Is the taste of me already washed from his mouth, or is he savouring it, waiting for the moment he can have more?
He’s ashamed of admitting that we’re more than just bodies — more than just strangers coming together in the night. And that’s — fine. I can’t push — can’t make him face something he doesn’t want to, no matter how much I want it. And I want
After a couple of silent minutes, he slumps back into the pillow, a sob caught in his throat.
Daylight has barely broken by the time I wake the next morning, and it doesn't take long for me to realise that he's gone. Another outcome I didn't see coming but should have expected. Memories of the night before are hazier this time, almost as if I'm coming down from a high. I know it's just my overprotective subconscious throwing up walls, once again blocking out the more mentally invasive bits to keep me from endangering myself any further than I have before.
I deserved it. Truly, I did. Two years without contact. Two years without any explanation. Two long and disparaging years filled with grief and sorrow that I never knew he felt. Why would I? It wasn't like we had ever discussed the emotional side of things before my… before I… I honestly don't know what to say when I think of it. Whatever I call it will never make up for what I did to him, but it doesn't matter now. The point is that I deserve the beating that he gave me. In truth, I probably deserve much more than that, but John has always been the type to hold back even when everyone else knows he shouldn't.
"Mmm, soft yet stiff, judging by the drag of the textured edge over my skin," the detective observed, a serious expression forming on his lips. "But there's something pliable about it as well. You handle it delicately, almost as if you're afraid to damage it and -- if memory serves me correctly -- I actually saw you pick this up nearly a month ago."
Especially now.
“It’s fine; you don’t have to say anything.”
jealous of my perceived ‘romantic entanglements’ with Irene Adler.
“Of course you do.”
“One minute.”
He asks the question almost accusingly. His eyes narrow more than I’ve ever seen before, and his brow furrows tightly. It gives his face a more hardened, ‘no-nonsense, stiff upper lip’ sort of characterisation that most British men pride themselves on. If I wasn’t so taken aback by the question, I might have actually found myself in fear of having such a look directed at me, but my mind has nearly spun out of control trying to decide how to react.
Was I vulnerable on my travels? Of course… I do not fault John for seeking companionship in my absence. There were others for me as well. Nameless men in dark corners of the world, but they could never compare. It was transactional — pure mathematical pleasure, unlike John. He can deny it all he wants, but we know each other. We understood enough to bring the other to the brink and keep them there, begging to be released. It wasn't until now, with time and distance, that I realise how emotional it all actually was. How far from John's intentions we had strayed.
Shaking his head, John chuckled softly, conceding the first point to his lover just as he'd known he would. "Alright, I'll give you that one," he said, letting the edge of the feather drift lazily down Sherlock's abdomen once again before brushing past the ever-swelling erection pressing flat against his belly. "I don't see how that's not cheating though, if you watched me collect it."
At that moment, I had struggled to keep my face straight, desperately fighting the wave of heat that had surged to my groin. It was then that I’d found myself suddenly feeling very grateful for wearing such a thick coat as part of my regular attire. Even if it hadn’t always been practical, it had proven at that moment to be quite useful at concealing my unexpected, yet very prominent, erection.
Special thanks to thinkanddoodle_batch and CarmillaCarmine for their never-ending support and for listening to me rant about this! ♥️ I am super grateful for you both!!
My stomach lurches at the memory. The thought of John being Moriarty; manipulating me for months as I fell harder for him each day — it would have been too much to bear. It was almost a relief to see the Semtex strapped to his chest. Almost.
John's ears burned slightly with the acknowledgement of his past sexual encounters but he cleared his throat, brushing it off. He couldn't deny how impressed he was with the deduction so, as usual, he knew he'd been beaten just as he'd expected. "All right, all right. Fair enough ... You win, then, like you said, so you get to choose, now…"
He flicks the lid open with his thumb in a rather fluid motion, almost as if he’s done it a million times —
I catch my breath as John walks through the door, grumbling something under his breath. I hear the words
“Did you stay up all night?” He asks, quirking a curious eyebrow.
Thank you all for being so patient! I have been scheduling University courses and sorting things out for my Fall semester the past month, so I'm grateful for all of you who hung with me lol :) SO, here's the latest chapter! <3 A lot will happen in this update and will give you a glimpse into what is coming next for the boys. Hope you enjoy! Please leave love and comments if you feel it is deserved lol
I have no idea how much time actually passes between his question and my blatant disregard for a politely timed answer, but it must be long enough to warrant John’s ultimate irritation with me. A heavy sigh passes his lips as he raises a hand to swipe over his face, pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger.
TRIGGER WARNING!!!! Some may argue that this needs to be tagged MCD... BUT, I know things that you don't know just yet so I will not be tagging the fic. You WILL see something devastating happen in this chapter, but I promise you it will be alright in the long run. Please, just trust me on this one ;) I'm going to make you cry, but I will make it all better very soon!
“Is yours a snorer?” The man had probed once again, clearly not taking the hint the first time. Am I, John? You’re the only one who would know.
If I’m honest with myself, I know the answer. I’ve known it all along.
My question falls unanswered, forgotten in an instant as John’s hands close around the bar of soap and he works an intoxicating lather up between his palms. The action is mesmerizing and my mind focuses instead on the particular way his fingers curl and uncurl slightly as the bar slips and slides between them as he moves to return it to its proper place.
not in that sense. We are just two people, reaching for one another in the dark.
As much as I am tempted, I do not let my mind entertain anything further concerning success. What is meant to be will be, and I have to maintain my wits even if it's difficult with John's hands moving over my hips, caressing my skin as we enter the room. He leads me over to the unused bed and makes quick work of my trousers, shoving them further down before prompting me to step out of them.
“You think I didn’t notice, Sherlock? You play for me whenever I have nightmares. Now it’s the only thing that calms me down enough so I can fall back asleep.”
My fingertips tease the coarse hair at his belly, tracing nondescript patterns over the lightly furred skin, then dip along the waistband of his pants. Seeking silent permission, I smirk when he shivers. The little huff of breath against my lips, accompanied by a subtle nod, lets me know that he doesn’t mind. He’s already stripped me bare, so why should he? My pants, along with the t-shirt I’d removed before bed, are scattered lazily over the floor as we work together to add his to the mix.
Ever so carefully, John took a black box from the bottom of the side table drawer. The various items he’d collected over the last few weeks rustled as he set them down on the bed and he tried not to think about the fact that Sherlock could probably deduce them already. ‘Annoying prick...‘ John thought fondly as he rolled his eyes. He opened the box and surveyed the small collection in front of him before dumping them out on the bed.
my mind supplies, but I shrug it off. What I’d really been asking was when I could have him again… When would he want me again? If ever…
Irene is a firm reminder that I cannot ever let that happen. However I feel for John, no matter what passed between us in the night, I cannot let my judgement slip. The second that happens, if I ever allow my sentiment to get in the way of the purely transactional experience we have, that is the day I fall.
Next time…
For a moment, I study the image before picking it up, but I’m still unsure of its sudden significance. That is…until I turn it over.
John responds to Sherlock's latest letter before the war in Afghanistan takes a very unexpected and devastating turn.
“You were kidnapped and strapped to explosives. Even for us, that’s not a normal day at the office. And you’re a veteran. Are you—“ I struggle to find the correct wording.“—emotionally okay?” The words feel thick in my mouth. It’s not what I mean to say. I want to ask him if it’s a danger night — if in a few hours I will have to save him from his screams. It’s happened before — nightmares that bleed through into reality. On those nights, I play the violin as loud as I can, trying to rouse him without him realising. Most nights it works, but this is not most nights.
And as always, thank you to my amazing beta, MsScarlet!! She’s the best I could ever hope for and has so much patience! I’m so very lucky!
I stand close to the bathroom door, holding my breath and listening for sounds on the other side. Sure enough, I can hear a rhythmic gasping for breath, coupled with the loudness of someone trying not to make a sound. I reach for the handle and find the room unlocked.
The bathroom door creaks open subtly and I freeze, blinking my eyes open slowly. I’m drawn back to myself in a bit of a haze; the water from the showerhead drips off my brow and into my eyes making it hard to see, but I can feel John’s presence as much as I can feel my own muscles tensing. He shouldn’t be here, yet he shouldn’t be anywhere else.
The tails of my shirt are already untucked as John's hands move to the front of my trousers, expertly manoeuvring me out of them without hesitation. It's a devastatingly easy process. I should be ashamed of how easily I'm melting for him, but there isn't anything I can do to overcome it, nor do I want to, if I'm honest with myself. The familiar drag of those calloused fingertips over the silk fabric of my pants sends a shiver down my spine and I can't help the moan that escapes my lips.
I had no idea that he was capable of drawing such overwhelming emotion from me. He had always been good at drawing on the more personal matters with women — that was plenty obvious, but this… this is something else entirely. The way his lips move over my skin, whispering beautiful promises of protection into every mark on my body as he works his way down, lights a fire in my soul the likes of which I had never thought possible. Every move he makes leaves me whining and melting beneath his every touch; every breath he steals from my lungs only leaves me wishing that I had more to give.
I stand, stunned into silence for a moment, feeling the ghost of his mouth on mine. I run my tongue over my lips, tasting the proof of his affection as the truth of it all begins to unfold before me. Something loosens in my chest, and a warm smile carves its way into my face.
Pressing a sensual kiss over Sherlock's beating heart held more love and affection than any words he could possibly utter but still, he allowed his lips to linger in silent vigil for the men they used to be. Without their own tragedies guiding their futures, neither of them would be where they are today and John knew it. He closed his eyes as a warm purr rumbled in Sherlock's chest -- a hum of approval even if John was getting overly sentimental -- and the sound settled over him comfortingly. No words could express the love he felt for the man beside him, so he didn't bother to try. They didn't need words of affirmation, no poetic "I love you"s or flowery expressions. It was just the two of them against the rest of the world, and John found that he didn't mind that idea one bit.
Oh, God, if I succeed…
“John, I — “
"I did, yes," John admitted, feeling a giggle rise in his throat. "While you were whirling around like you always do, you had everyone hanging on your every word as you broke down the flaws in their current security measures. It was interesting, at least, that someone would want to steal an entire rose bush so I figured they must have been quite special."
The cab home is silent. What can we say? Thank you for trusting me with your life? For promising to follow me into the depths of oblivion? There’s an invisible line in the sand we crossed months ago. First with Jeff Hope; now with the promise to die at each other’s side with the squeeze of a trigger. There’s a mutual understanding between us — crackling electricity in the spaces between, but I can’t form any words that convey how I feel. Pure facts; that’s what I can do. Give me a crime, and I’ll effortlessly reveal how it took place. Give me emotion, and it’s an entirely different story.
“It was imperative that I memorise every detail about our meeting with Moriarty,” I lie. I have spent embarrassingly little time thinking about the consulting criminal. I should — no doubt this will not be the last time we see him, but I can’t bring myself to think about anything other than John’s hand fisted around the both of us.
“Are you—”
The way Mrs Hudson tuts over us, the way John’s keyboard clicks with the irregularity of his finger-pecking as he types away at his blog…John…
She took the gesture as a yes, and I mentally cursed at myself. A soft smile played at her lips as she moved to sit on the bed in front of me. Unlike before, it wasn’t sexual — there was no invitation to join her, no coy smile or silent beckoning in her eyes. There was just her, asking a question as a friend.
His eyes flutter closed as my own rake over the full expanse of his naked body in the pale glow of the moonlight filtering in through the bedroom window. My mouth waters at the eroticism of the scene before me and I nearly miss the way he tilts the lubricant out for me to coat my hand.
It’s a quiet but powerful sound, starting as a low rumble in the depths of his chest before reverberating through my entire body as his lips continue to mouth over the sensitive flesh of my thigh. This is definitely a far cry from the doctor-patient agenda my brain has been so desperately clinging to, but I’m not sure how to process what is actually happening. My heart pounds erratically in my chest and my hands clench and unclench at my sides.
of him. I long for the casual affection of long term partners; stolen kisses in the stairwell and lingering touches as we pass in the kitchen. But I can’t have that. Not now. Maybe not ever. I’m not sure what I expected from John ‘
I am not a better man.
I shower and shave, exiting my room only half an hour after John, but it’s enough to wash the slate clean. John doesn’t even act as if anything is different — he types up the case with his usual fervour, questioning me occasionally on details he’s forgotten. He chats to Mrs Hudson when she pops her head around the door, acting as if everything is normal. As if nothing has changed. Later that night, he pads up the stairs to his room like he hadn't spent the last night in mine. Like I don’t know what his face looks like when he orgasms; as if I haven’t memorised how he reacts to each touch of my hand on his cock.
The eager desperation in Sherlock's voice sent a shiver down John's spine and he couldn't help feeling chuffed with himself. He was the reason the great Sherlock Holmes was writhing on his back, aching for release; he was the reason the coherent thoughts of that brilliant mind were unravelling faster than a fraying ribbon. Yes, he -- John Watson -- was the only person in the world to see the world-renowned detective at his most fragile, his most vulnerable. The power that came with that sort of recognition filled him with an intense desire to stake his claim and, this time, he wouldn't brush it away. He might have been feeling the pull of exhaustion, but he didn’t want to deprive himself of such a gift. This time, he was going to devour him. He was going to take him apart, inch by beautiful inch until every fibre of Sherlock's being was consumed by the overwhelming sense of what it was like to be owned by another human being… and John was going to relish every second of it.
When he leaves — sinking into the sofa, hiding behind his laptop — I drop my bag in my bedroom and head straight to the shower. A layer of plane grime coats my skin, and I’m desperate to wash it off. His accusations follow me, occupying my mind as I run through the motions of wetting my hair and working shampoo through the curls. What did he think we were up to? Some sex-fuelled rendezvous in the middle of Pakistan? Surely, he knew me better than that?
Carefully, I climb out of the shower, groaning when I realise John has stolen the last towel. I squeeze the water out of my hair before slipping back into my bedroom, cursing as carpet sticks to my sodden feet. I pull a clean towel out from my wardrobe, drying off my skin and stepping into clean pyjamas. It’s early, but I climb into bed, staring at the ceiling. I need the barrier of time — the dawn of a new day before I can face John again. Last time was intolerable — trying to maintain a normal facade as we carried on as usual. Now, I’m not sure I have the self-restraint; the ability to keep my hands to myself as he tries to ignore what has passed between us. I’m unsure of what the rules are here. Is he the only one that gets to initiate this? Do I have to sit back as he takes what he wants, but refuses to yield any level of intimacy?
Hey, guys! Thank you for sticking with me! Classes picked up and hammered me into the ground pretty hard over the last month or so, but things have calmed down enough now that I can work my way back to regular updates. :) I am grateful for those of you who are still reading and still looking forward to the story and I hope that I can keep you wanting more! ;)
“Shut up.” He murmurs into his hand, letting out a deep sigh.
It’s funny really, just how much of this flat seems to resemble us both, yet I’ve never noticed it before. I’d fought tooth and nail in the beginning to keep myself from becoming fully immersed in the enigma that is John Watson, but all around me, my entire world had already taken in more of him than I had ever planned. From the rugs on the floors to the magazines piled up on the coffee table, to the tea rings on the end tables, to the knick-knacks on the mantle. Everything in the room seemed to radiate with his presence, and it wasn’t until now that I realised the intensity of it all.
John’s demeanour had shifted the second he’d walked in on her straddling my lap. I doubt he was fully aware of it, but he stayed close — keeping me within arms reach as much as possible. I have to admit that I played on it, indulging Irene in her games without any intention of following through.
We stay, one hand in another, until the sobs begin to fade. Neither of us moves until each uncensored emotion has been drawn out, every muscle is relaxed, and John’s grip begins to weaken. I know that exhaustion will be biting at his heels.
Special thanks to my lovely beta, Ms.Scarlet for all the amazing work she does on this little disaster ❤️
John notices; he always notices.
Jealousy comes in all shapes and sizes. It takes on multiple forms, manifesting itself between friends and lovers alike without ever batting an eye. It weaves its way into families, terrorising siblings and conquering great dynasties with a single swipe of its poisoned talons. It is ruthless in its pursuits and knows no bounds.
He focuses instead on scrubbing away every possible particle of dirt from my thighs and calves then lifts each of my feet in turn as he scrubs them clean as well. Another gentle kiss is pressed to my skin once he’s finished, throwing my deductive reasoning for yet another loop. I don’t understand; I can’t understand. Nothing makes sense as his lips brush over me yet again, this one landing just over the prominent crease where my hip meets my thigh and that’s when I hear it as well as feel it.
"John's getting married," I say, the words tumbling out of my mouth before I can stop them. It's odd, hearing it put so bluntly in my own words and the once everlasting strength of my usually well-composed visage begins to shatter on the surface. The meaning cuts deep into my chest, carving out deep crevices of pain in places I never knew could hurt. The torment and torture of Serbia pale in comparison to this.
With a gentle tug of my hand, he casts his gaze up the stairs leading up to his old bedroom and my heart nearly stops. In all our messing about, we've never once crossed the threshold into his room. Every encounter, every kiss, every touch has taken place elsewhere in what I always assumed to be a more neutral environment for him. If the incidents occur outside of his bed, they are more easily swept away. Out of sight, out of mind, if you will. He may not live here anymore, but I can't ignore the significance of what is being offered to me.
'Had Irene been right? Was John Watson truly so jealous that he would break his own code of honour in order to recapture something only he thought to have claimed? I brush the thought from my mind; just because he is jealous does not mean that he wishes to be more than what we are.'
He didn't care that it had only been a few minutes; he didn't care that he'd already come. He just wanted to please his lover. He wanted to make this time memorable by giving Sherlock something special to save in his Mind Palace -- something he could keep to analyse forever and ever… something more than the sloppy first-time blow job he'd given him back in the old alleyway behind the Met.
The drive home is filled with newfound ease. For the first time in months, the air feels clear, both of us sinking into the suppressed ease of our early friendship. No longer is this a one-sided game; calculated moves of chess designed to crown a winner. This is something more, an effortless partnership, sealed with the promise of a kiss. It’s a companionship that knows no limits, something I’ve never imagined possible, but yet it sits before me, proud and honest, mine for the taking as the familiar London streets welcome us home.
We wind blindly through the trees, chasing mere shadows through the forest. I can hear John’s breath behind me, effortlessly keeping pace. I may have longer legs, but John is fast. We turn a corner and Frankland hurtles forwards out of the treeline, heading for the barbed wire fence in front of us. Something niggles at my brain, warning me of danger, but it’s not until I feel John’s steady hand pull on my shoulder that I realise what’s in front of us. I skid to a halt, my shoes losing grip on the soft ground, instinctively throwing a hand out to brace myself against John. He quickly hooks an arm around my waist, pulling me upright. We watch breathlessly as Frankland hurdles the barbed wire fence without pause, barely breaking stride.
“Is that what you want?” I murmur, my hand stilling on his back, frozen with uncertainty.  His eyes drift to the carpet as he seems to consider the question.
He felt rather than saw the way his lover's brows knit together for a moment, obviously needing a moment to think this one through. Sherlock was too bright to be tricked, that was evident from the start and John knew it, but that wasn't the point of the game. Even with John's own competitive side fighting to break free of its constraints, he knew this whole wager had been about teasing the man at his mercy before finally giving him the pleasure he deserved.
So wrapped up in my own little world, I had not considered the situation John had been in. An invalided army veteran, faced with a minefield, an explosion, and a dead man, was not a good combination. John’s post-traumatic stress disorder was not of the standard variety, but there was no doubt it was still there. And this cocktail of torrential trauma, paired with the involvement of the actual military, was enough to set anyone off.
He held the flower up for inspection, making sure that he had indeed clipped every single thorn from the stem before deeming it safe enough to use. He studied it carefully then nodded approvingly to himself as he dipped the petals toward Sherlock's skin, smiling softly as the vibrant red cut a stark contrast to the pale expanse of Sherlock's inner thigh.
I finally lifted up my coat, slowly threading my arms through and shrugging it over my body. I turned to leave, uninterested in continuing the conversation. Despite her reassurance, she was close to Moriarty, and I had no intention of revealing that level of personal information to someone who would ultimately use it to their own ends.
However, I find that, once again, my usual forms of deduction are coming up short.
With growing exasperation, Sherlock let out an irritated sigh. The situation was obviously beginning to wear on him and, although John didn't admit it aloud, he couldn't deny it was a welcome change from his usual arrogance. "Oh, for God's sake, forget your bloody list, John... I won your game now give me your mouth… Please!"
Aaaaaaand please don't hate me! I promise I will fix it and make it better! It had to happen in order for the rest of the fic to play out, but I will be back with an update asap. lol For now, please don't ditch me or run away screaming or hate me in the comments LOLThank you all for reading!
"Hmm, you could have, true." Sherlock answered, mulling the suggestion over, "but you didn't. The feather would have been the first thing that caught your eye, making you wonder what it would feel like to tease me with it. Most likely due to an encounter with an old flame, she liked to experiment and you weren't exactly going to say no. Plus, I know that you're a methodical man, to say the least, and it would be a basic instinct for you to start with the item that started it all."
I stay silent, stunned by the admission. Of course I played for him — that first night, it was the only thing I could think of to wake him slowly; to save him from the depths of his night terrors. I never realised he knew.
If there is even the slightest possibility that I could have engaged in sexual relations with The Woman, it is quite obvious that he would insist on checking me over to make certain that I am clean in every way possible. He is most likely extremely invested in confirming with his own eyes that I am free from any negative connotations The Woman’s professional, as well as leisurely, activities could have on my body. Even a very basic appreciation for medical logic would be able to confirm this theory. She did drug me once before after all, so I’m not ruling that possibility out either. He's done this sort of thing before when drugs were involved, albeit with a heavy emphasis on monitoring me for track marks after discovering my nasty little struggles with addiction, but still, my point stands.
Of course… He doesn't need to know the horrors I've faced and I'm grateful that I don't have to answer the questions. I wouldn't know where to start anyway.
Yay! It’s posting day!! More John and Sherlock getting to know one another ♥️ This chapter is a bit short but it is short for a reason ;) you’ll see why next chapter! I know it isn’t much but I hope it’s still liked and I’m sorry it couldn’t be longer.
He’s stroking himself in slow, lazy passes, wringing the remains of his orgasm from his cock as it pools at the edges of his foreskin and he brushes it away with his thumb. I slump against the wall in a haze of post-coital bliss as I watch him and I can’t help wondering what he must taste like. I’ve only ever tasted my own — for experimental purposes, of course — so the thought of tasting another’s, John’s in particular, opens up a whole new catalogue of references in my mind. Would he have a tangy, bitter taste? Or something more akin to a sweet yet salty combination? The possibilities are endless really, especially with the theory that your previous food intake determines the flavour and thickness, but I quickly let the idea slip from my mind as I feel John’s eyes on me.
There’s a soft knock at the door. John doesn’t wait for me to answer before he slips through the doorway. I shuffle over and lift the covers to make room for him, breathing a small sigh of relief as he crawls in next to me.
"Fuck, John… Just… ah…"
I count the steps as I make my way up to our flat, allowing myself a moment of playfulness in the depths of my mind. My thoughts are light and airy, like nothing I’ve experienced before, and the promise of John tagging along behind me, chuckling softly as he always does, fills my heart with an emotion I can’t quite name. It’s a warm and tingly feeling that has me glancing around the sitting room, a desperate fondness washing over me as my gaze settles on the mismatched chairs that have defined us for months. John’s warm dependability and comforting demeanour are echoed in the colours and Union Jack throw pillow, while the importance of intellect and my own desperate need for simplicity in an overly complex world stare back at me from my usual seat.
Okay, I'll start by saying that I am terribly sorry for the huge delay in this next chapter. I last updated in November. After that update, I got into a car accident, had major stuff going on in Uni, and had a lot of stress to overcome. Unfortunately, the lock-down and Quarantine wasn't very helpful either, but here we are now! I FINALLY got this out and can't wait for you all to read it! I hope to update monthly now that this has come to pass but I will keep everyone updated via my Twitter account (@LKoda0518)! Thank you so much for your patience!
On the backside of the photograph, blazing red letters glare back at me. The scarlet verbiage sparks a terrifying flood of fear, ransacking the many corridors of my Mind Palace as the meaning sinks deep into my bones — a simple, yet deadly threat, one that I’d heard before but did not fully understand.
Swallowing down the curiosity and shoving it aside for later, John let the softened leather strips brush over Sherlock's balls. The way that the heavy weight of his lover's sac tightened and drew up slightly at the contact did things to John's libido and he silently cursed the fact that he'd already come. There was just something about the whole scenario, an almost reverent feel to the way he allowed himself to move, and he found it hard to keep his control.
If I want John Watson, this is how I have him. A one night stand steeped in fear and denial. I have to be okay with that.
Everything between us seems to come rushing back, slotting easily into place. Groin slides against groin, erections meeting through layers of fabric, settling into a needy rhythm accented with eager huffs of ecstasy. My fingers work effortlessly to free his belt before trailing down to his zip and I'm surprised at the sudden 'riiiip' that echoes in the quiet sitting room as John's impatience wins the battle with my shirt. Buttons scatter in all directions, clattering to the floor and ricocheting off of various objects with an exciting vigour, and for a moment, it's almost as if I had never left… until his hands find the devastation that now covers my back and sides.
He's focused on the same wound as before, his lips moving with reverence and surety, setting every one of my senses on fire. It's maddening, the way he kisses his way over every visible inch of the scars covering the vast expanse of my torso, and I find that I can barely breathe. The intimacy of what he's doing threatens to overthrow every sensibility I have left in me, but I don't allow myself to run from it. Instead, I press back against him, squeezing my eyes shut tight as tears well up from somewhere deep inside me.
John furrowed his brow in confusion, "Hold on, I never set a limit as to how many items I had for you to guess. So, what makes you think you've won already?"
I half-smile in agreement.
“Morning.” The word feels stale in my mouth —
I'd been expecting this. Oh, I had lied to Mycroft, pretending I thought everything would go back to normal, but I knew we would be far from it. I had realised that John would be angry; I knew that the relationship we'd had before would have changed. But I never understood just how different things would be. There was still a part of me that longed for more. There had been hope; that singular kiss in the inn had been a promise of something deeper, the tentative dip of a toe into water. All the way to the restaurant, I told myself that once John got over the fact I had lied, once he understood that I had only died for him, then perhaps we could be more.
"Well, I'm changing that, now," the doctor quipped, setting the flogger aside and pulling something else from the bedside table drawer. The heavy clink of metal supplied a beautiful image to John's mind of Sherlock spread out on the bed, his hands cuffed above his head as John trailed the flogger over the plush curve of his lover's arse. It was almost too much to think about in the heat of the moment, but John tamped it down yet again.
Hiya, guys! Sorry for the long wait! Uni is in full swing and that also means that football season has hit my house, as well! Lol thank you for your patience and I hope you enjoy!!
As the weeks pass, it starts to become harder and harder to keep myself in check. Each action is brushed with my affections, and frustration creeps into my skin as each one is disregarded. I become restless between cases; my body betraying me. To have been given a taste, yet denied the gratification of reaching out whenever I want, is driving me mad. My body thrums in anticipation, constantly ready for him to take what he wants. I second-guess every move, analyse every word, looking for some sort of sign. It builds and builds, until, finally, I can’t contain it anymore.
I head back to Baker Street alone. This was not what I had hoped for tonight. I had imagined greeting Mrs Hudson as a pair, declaring that we were coming back to Baker Street together, no matter what that entailed. Instead, I greet her alone, before retreating to the flat.
My flight lands back at Heathrow in the early afternoon, and I’ve barely made it back up the stairs of 221B when John accosts me in the hallway, blocking the door with his body.
Or, rather
What feels like an eternity finally seems to pass, though I’m vaguely aware it’s only been about twenty minutes. His breath starts to even out, each muscle relaxing, his arms falling to rest on his ankles. Then, the sobs begin. Each one cracks its way out of his body and pulls at my heart. Each tear sounds loud as it drips into the base of the bath. I swallow my own tears, a useless response, and inch my hand forward on the side of the tub.
John ambles off to the kitchen, and it isn’t long before the smell of frying bacon fills the flat and makes my stomach rumble. Yes. This is enough.
Still, I'm surprised when he doesn't leave.
I ask myself as the room seems to fade around me.
Another accusatory question.
I think, hurriedly flicking back through my archived memories of John, wondering if I’ve missed something so terribly obvious, but, in the end, I find nothing. The chilling covenant hangs in the air like some sort of passive-aggressive threat, dangling over me with a sharp promise that I will later regret letting it go so easily.
John's teeth scrape my lip again, teasing it between his teeth as he draws me back to reality. '
"Arms above your head," he huffed instead, securing Sherlock’s wrists to the headboard. He sat back to admire his handiwork for a moment, and it was clear Sherlock was doing his best not to sulk at the fact that his little loophole had been tied up.
His hand slid delicately over the detective's cock, drawing an intimately rough groan from the deep cupid's bow of Sherlock's lips and John heard himself whine. Quivering thighs bracketed his head, closing around him as he picked up his pace, sucking and bobbing his head in time with his hand as he sucked his fiancé off eagerly. The whole sensation was just as it always was: raw, imperfect, and practically carnal. He licked and sucked and tugged at Sherlock's ever-hardening length, moaning around the heavy weight on his tongue before Sherlock's hips gave a violent twitch. The handcuffs rattled as the detective's eagerness to tangle his fingers in John's thick blond hair made itself evident.
I nod because I do.
Yet, John was jealous of Irene. I wasn’t expecting it — I’m not sure he’s even aware of it — but it’s there. A simmering possessiveness that surfaces each time she flirted at me. I considered flirting back, only a little, just to see his reaction.
The detective moved just as he’d asked and John situated the blindfold just the way he wanted before tying it off at the back of Sherlock’s head, being especially careful not to tangle any of his fiancé's unruly hair in the knot in the process. He waved a hand in front of Sherlock’s face and stuck his tongue out at him for good measure. “Can you see anything?” he asked, making certain that it was tight enough on his face that he couldn’t glimpse any sneak peeks through the bottom edge of the fabric.
A deep sense of confusion brings a furrow to my brow. Who could have left it? My brain sifts through the usual suspects in a whirlwind of thoughts, but no one seems to fit the bill. It most certainly isn’t Mycroft; God knows he prefers to make a show of things when he has something new to rub under my nose. But, if not Mycroft…then who?
Even after the second time, washing each other in the shower, I wanted more, but I was afraid to ask. I knew what the answer would be. So I tried to shut my feelings away, compartmentalise myself to stop my affection bleeding into every action. I was unsuccessful. My body is like a magnet, gravitating towards him whilst he stays motionless across the room.
I note the thought for further analysing; something was given to me, that much is clear, but it doesn’t explain the way my body is reacting now. Knowing that what I thought I had seen was nothing but an elaborate illusion, I should be able to dismiss the fear and anxiety lingering over me, but I can’t. My mind has been compromised, and the more I think about it, the more I begin to realise just what has clouded my judgment.
John flinches a few more times, mouthing silent pleas to some invisible enemy. I repeat his name, louder this time, and he jerks himself awake, sitting up jarringly and bracing himself against the mattress with outstretched hands. I long to reach for him, to pull him into my arms and chase the terror away, but I don’t. Wishful thinking never helped anyone.
It slipped out involuntarily, the blatant disregard of his friendship. It was true, and I had meant it. I
Special thank you to my lovely beta, MsScarlett, for all her work on this with me! She is truly the real MVP of this fic <3 Also, a wonderful shoutout to the fabulous CarmillaCarmine for all her edits and for pointing out what I need more of. Personal thank you to the lovely Thinkanddoodle, as well, this time around for kicking my ass into gear and driving me to get this chapter ready for today! You guys are amazing and I can't do this without you pushing me! All the love and hugs and kisses to you!
Another sharp nip to my bottom lip draws me back to him once again and, just as I relent to kiss him back, he’s gone. My eyes snap open, searching for a split second, but he hasn’t gone far. He’s leaning over the edge of the bed, quickly sitting back up after retrieving a tube of lubricant from the bedside table drawer.
We know you've all been waiting quite a while for this one but we hope it's well worth the wait!! ♥️ Thank you for sticking with us and being so patient!! We are so excited with the way this fic has been received and are grateful to you all for reading!! 🥰
And suddenly it hits me. That was the first sentence John had uttered since the minefield. Even when the officers questioned us, he let me take the lead, merely shaking his head or nodding in agreement. It had seemed odd at the time, the military precision of it, but my brain was far too preoccupied with my own uncertainties to process the information fully. It was almost as if — oh. Fuck.
Sherlock let out an irritated snort but didn't argue. It was evident that he knew, deep down, that he could only push John so far before he spoiled the mood, and it was nice that he’d begun to make a conscious effort to do better. In the past few months, he’d even seemed to become more accustomed to the domestic side of their relationship -- the little caresses as they passed one another in the kitchen, nights of cuddling on the sofa while John watched crap telly and Sherlock pretended that he wasn't interested. He’d even taken to brushing his fingers over John’s hair as he passed the doctor working on his blog at the desk or when John made a particularly clever observation, just as he had the week before.
But the one thing I hadn't anticipated, the singular fact I hadn't been prepared for, was her. Of all the scenarios I had pictured, I had not factored in the possibility that he might meet someone new. That he would have left this life behind, content to become a domestic husband. Because that isn't him. That isn't the John Watson I know.
A chorus of gunshots signals a definitive end to a lifetime of horrors, as the details of the case fall together into the collective files of my Mind Palace. Madness has been vanquished, no longer able to rear its ugly head at the expense of the sanity of those who have suffered in its evil clutches. The curtain has fallen, the final whistle has blown; the nightmare has ended.
“Are you ready to go?”
Sherlock's cock nudged against the back of his throat and John flushed as his gag reflex was tempted to trigger. It had been quite some time since he'd done this but if he played his cards right, it wouldn't take him long at all. Sherlock was in no mood to drag this out any longer than necessary so John curled his fingers around the thickening shaft, using his own saliva as the perfect lubricant.
Thank you for trucking along with me! From here the plot begins to thicken!! As we go, you will see more and more of the deeper storyline be revealed! The boys are smitten and things are about to start happening! :D I can’t wait to start revealing some of my plans!!
"Fine," Sherlock sighed. He shifted again, bringing a hand up to fondle the leather strips where they rested against his skin.
"Isn't that lovely?" Sherlock mused, his voice dripping with arousal. "It seems the 'good doctor' has made friends with the Adler woman, after all… now, tell me, John… would you prefer to be the one doing the flogging or would you rather be the one getting flogged? I'm rather flexible, either way, so…"
Once the microscope has been cleaned and packed away, I move onto the rest of the kitchen. There is a skin of dust over everything, visibly marking the passage of time. There were moments, whilst running from or towards danger, when I had not expected to make it home. There was more than one night where I had curled up on the floor, convinced that I was never going to step foot on English soil again. That I'd never get a chance to make things right with John. But here I am.
Seven words. Twenty-two letters. Yet, that is all it takes for the “great Sherlock Holmes” to break. My eyes flick to John, standing with his back to me as he busies himself with tea bags and spoonfuls of sugar and it’s in that moment that I realise the gravity of what is before me. It’s the thought of his scent, the gentle softness of the little hairs at the nape of his neck, the memory of the warmth of his skin that brings me face to face with the harsh realities of love.
Though inexperienced as I am in the ways of love, I am still hyper-aware that tonight is my one fleeting chance to reclaim John Watson, and I aim to take it. If I fail, then life will go on and I will deal with the emotional damages that befall me without complaint. If I succeed…?
"They got you pretty good this time," John observed with a wince. "I'll have to be more careful going forward."
A low growl broke through John's subconscious and he shifted his gaze to Sherlock's face. A look of pure ecstasy seemed to light his features; even without seeing his eyes, John knew the detective well enough to know that he'd already figured this one out, as well.
John tilts his head; his gaze thoughtful even if he doesn’t look me in the eyes. I can tell he’s studying my face and I can’t help the wave of self-consciousness that threatens to break over me as he dips his head back to my chest. At first, it feels like a form of retreat, a polite dismissal of thought, but then his lips brush over the hollow at the base of my neck, sending a shiver down my spine.
I tell myself, placing all of my attention on John. His hands are on me now: one cradled against the nape of my neck, one curved expertly around my hip. The pads of his fingers elicit little shocks of pleasure all over my skin as they begin to pry my clothing from my body.
My mouth waters and I shake my head in a desperate attempt to clear the impure thoughts from my mind. I don’t have time for this. I need a clear headspace; I need to sharpen my thought processes, I
It works for weeks. I am able to convince myself that this is enough. Semi-regular contact, my mind can cope with that. But then a strange client comes to the door with the promise of hounds, and the safety of 221B is whipped out from under my feet. There, I had begun to understand the rules. We only ever fucked in my bedroom, never speaking, never lingering.
This is a game where only he knows the rules. I can’t ask, not outright. We had never spoken about it, never asked for anything. He had taken what he wanted, pausing only long enough to check we were on the same page. But there was no verbal confirmation — nothing as concrete as conversation, just subtle nods and moans of pleasure. But, something changed in that instant, something that I must have missed the first time through. John’s eyes lingered on me for a moment as I glared at him, clearly daring him to deny me what I wanted, yet the denial never comes.
Also, special thanks to @CarmillaCarmine and @Thinkanddoodle-batch <3 Carmilla's edits and both of your support help me to keep this going! Thank you for being the best friends I could ever hope for! So much love your way!
“Don’t worry, I doubt Moriarty could tell. He’s not particularly sharp when it comes to human emotion.”
What I had expected to be a one-off occurrence ends up becoming a regular arrangement. As the number of dangerous cases and mishaps increase, so do our physical encounters. It’s nothing as substantial as a relationship, or even a routine arrangement, but there is a regularity to it that feels odd. In my life, I have never troubled myself with something so mundane as a relationship, and, until now, I have never wanted to. And therefore I have nothing with which to compare. Is this how every other partnership begins? With a silent give and take in the shadows?
"Of course, you did," Sherlock snorted softly. He didn't look at John as he leaned back on the pillows, but he didn't have to. The amount of trust and peace between them was all either of them would ever need and it was certainly enough for John for now. "Now, stop staring at me like I'm some sort of an enigma. You're never going to crack it anyway so get up here and let me hold you."
I'm stirring sugar into a cup of tea when Mrs Hudson joins me. It's evident that she knows what's happened but she doesn't seem to know how to broach the subject of my emotional state. I consider leaving her in the shadows, maintaining some sense of pride in my current predicament, but my insecurities are too vulnerable for silence.
Not what, John? Lovers? Friends with benefits? People who only seek each other’s bodies out in the stillness of the night; hiding our sexualities with an unhealthy dose of darkness?
to think. About something other than John and his commanding officer voice, preferably. I need to focus on Henry Knight. He’s dragged us out onto the moors, in search of his monstrous hound, yet my mind doesn’t seem to understand the severity of the situation.
It was the tacked on "please" that caught John's attention, and he smirked triumphantly. Even though he'd lost the battle, he'd still won the war. Being the proper soldier that he was, he couldn't resist the urge to draw the sensation out for just a moment longer. "Hmm, I like the sound of that," he mused. "Say 'please' one more time then, yeah?"
As always, comments and kudos are much appreciated. We love reading all your reactions!
A soft whine broke the silence and John felt Sherlock shift uncomfortably beneath him. The cuffs strained again as Sherlock tried to wriggle free, pulling John back to the situation at hand. "Easy, love," John murmured, stroking Sherlock's side to calm him. He reached up to flick the latch on the cuffs and took each of Sherlock's wrists in his hands, looking them over before placing soothing kisses to the angry red marks etched into his skin.
I don’t sleep, instead cataloguing the case into the depths of my mind palace. I consider deleting the last parts; the sickening smell of gunpowder and scorched skin, but I refrain. As much as I never want to recall that, I doubt John’s PTSD will subside after tonight. It would be helpful to remember the trigger.
“Completely dark,” Sherlock replied, tilting his head from side to side -- no doubt testing the heightened sensitivity of his hearing. His smirk had faded but a small smile played over his lips in its place. “Interesting how I can’t see you, but I can still tell by the subtle hitch of your breathing that your libido is currently cursing your refractory period.”
It is because of this that I have always said that love is a much more vicious motivator, but, in the heat of the moment, I am no longer sure. As John’s hands trail down my spine, I can’t help but wonder what jealousy would look like — what damage could it possibly do — when fueled by passion? Would it feel like John’s tongue lapping longingly over my pulse, branding me as if I were never to be touched by anyone else? Or would it feel like the soft hair of his belly, slicked wet and clinging to his skin where it brushes against my arse, teasing me beyond reason?
“Only you would say it like that.” He smirks, reaching a hand under his pillow to rest his head against. “I’m — I dunno. I feel weird. Like I can still feel it beneath my skin. I didn’t—” he sighs, his voice dropping to a murmur as if admitting defeat. “I couldn’t be alone.”
Sherlock's eyes widened a fraction, and it's then that John knew that his curiosity had definitely piqued. "I see... Go on?"
“Can’t sleep either?” He asks as he settles himself in, throwing one of the many pillows to the floor.
A deep chuckle filled the room and Sherlock grinned. Even with the blindfold on, John knew the mischievous gleam in his eyes was still there. "John, the first item you used -- the feather, that was the first item you'd picked up for your collection. That was roughly five weeks ago… so, figuring that you've collected items from the last few cases that I've had -- which has been steady with one a week to keep me occupied, I can easily deduce that you've been able to collect five items, one from each case that we've been on, including the feather."
I didn’t think he’d notice I was gone. I spun a lie about tying up loose ends with Mycroft, before catching a flight to Karachi, determined to save the Woman from herself, despite my better judgement. Yet, once again, I am proven wrong.
"Fuck… close… John," Sherlock panted, gasping for breath and squeezing his eyes tightly shut. His pulse thundered through his body as his thighs squeezed tightly around John's head. The quickened thump-thump-thump of his pulse echoed in John's ear where the skin was pressed flush to his ear.
We bid goodbye to Lestrade at the top of the staircase. He doesn’t ask if we’re okay, instead giving a single nod and unlocking his room in one swift motion. The question would be pointless.
An untimely introduction; an inappropriate joke at the expense of John's facial hair; a furious fist in my face. That is how the evening goes. We hop, venue to venue, neither of us bridging the gap, unable to fully explain our points of view. All the while, she sits and watches, an unwelcome spectator to our pain.
my brain supplies, conjuring up scenarios featuring combat boots and military fatigues; dog tags clinking together against John’s bare chest as I sink to my knees in front of him — the scar from the bullet wound that nearly killed him marring his perfectly pale skin. It’s hard to stop the scenario from running wild, my throat aching from the stretch in order to accommodate his ridiculous size; his hands fisted in my hair in order to hold me in place.
He repeats the delicate process he’d developed on my back, this time starting with my chest and working his way down to my belly. He lathers, he washes, he rinses, making sure no soap is left behind before sinking to his knees in front of me as he completely ignores my groin.
And here's Chapter Five!! So excited to share and start the main points of the plot! Something major will be happening in each chapter from here on out, so I really hope you're all ready for the rollercoaster of events that is about to take place! Thank you all for sticking with me thus far and for being so kind!
I tug his hair in a quiet, yet gentle warning. I do not know if I am permitted to speak so I don’t, just to be safe. Our entire encounter has once again been completely silent, but it doesn’t bother me. The soft moans and quiet growls are enough to satiate my need for audible data and I am certain that I will be analysing each new sound in turn for days on end.
Also, I can’t do an update without thank @CarmillaCarmine and @thinkanddoodle-batch for all of their love and praise and general pandering to my whiny ass as I get through this thing! They’re my favorite humans and deserve all the love and recognition I can give them! Hugs and kisses to you both!
Another gentle tap of my hip has me turning toward the water again and John’s hands work to rinse me clean, stroking the hard length of my cock in a steady rhythm that sends yet another shiver down my spine. He’s careful but sure of himself, much like that first night, but I’m still painfully aware that this time is very different. He has something new in mind and I can feel it in every swipe of his thumb over my slit, in every slight twist of his wrist as he coaxes me closer and closer to the edge.
Soft hands land on my waist and I choke back a groan, every cell straining with self-restraint. This is wrong. So wrong. We're at his wedding, his wife is in the next room, someone could walk in on us, and it's his wedding.
Yet, as ever, he surprises me. As we are about to leave, he turns in the doorway, sucking in a breath of courage.
I should have known. I should have seen…  John doesn’t understand. He was never allowed to ‘get over’ himself; he’s never acknowledged the attractions towards men he has — he just wants to indulge himself without having to think about it. He wants me — the late-night chases and the physical pull of desire that goes with it, but not
Then again, I suppose it has.
He unlocks it after a few tries; his hands shaking with the effort. I almost snatch it back and unlock it for him, but I stop myself. This is not the time for my impatience.
It is easier when there is a case. I can channel my relentless energy into something specific — my jumpiness chalked up to the adrenaline of the case. In the moments between, it is unbearable, not just the sexual tension, but the need to be close, to hold him to me. But he would never allow that. So I pace, and I sulk, and I harpoon dead pigs. Because I’m Sherlock Holmes, and that is what I do.
John wields the bow; I am the violin.
"Pfft," Sherlock huffed, "I see everything, John. You know that…"
John’s lips curl in a definite, yet hidden, snarl and he growls.
Sherlock’s exasperation mounted as he bucked his hips and he let the clever mask of control slip for the briefest of moments. "Oh for fuck’’s sake, John… please!"
The fabric of my shirt rustles softly as it's pushed to the floor and I hear a rough, strangled sound catch in the back of his throat. It's strange really, having the evidence of my torture on display like this, but I don't feel as exposed as I usually would. Perhaps it's the years of familiarity between us, or maybe even the more recent physical and emotional developments coming into play, but either way, it isn't as awkward as I would have imagined.
(See the end of the chapter for
John and Sherlock go their separate ways; both facing John's deployment with their own doubts and insecurities. Will the other people in their lives make things better or worse?
John smirked, swallowing the haughty chuckle that bubbled up in his throat. He could draw this out and edge Sherlock even further if he wanted, but he found himself feeling extra generous at the moment -- choosing to ignore the fact that he was practically thrumming with the desire to taste and touch every inch of the man beneath him.
My own sanity hangs in the balance, teetering dangerously close to the edge of my greatest fears. My mind had betrayed me. It had let me down in a moment when I had needed it most, allowing fear and anxiety to run rampant as I watched everything that I’d ever prided myself on being stripped away from me.
With a tilt of my head, I open my mouth to speak — to question his intentions — but John shakes his head, raising a finger to his lips. “You didn’t want to talk earlier; I don’t want to talk now,” he says gruffly, raking his gaze over my body and sliding the door closed behind him as I move forward a bit to make room. His eyes are hard and cold, filled with something new —
He's gone back to her. I know he has without even having to speculate. Whether it's the fear of his own identity or the fear of the inevitable heartache that comes from being with me that drives him back, I'll never know, but it still eats at me. The very core of it chips away at my soul like a degenerative disease. Even as I muddle through the motions of civilian life, trying in vain to come up with some semblance of a morning routine — shower, breakfast, tea, I find that I'm struggling to accept the end result. Is this really how my almost-relationship with John Watson ends? Is this truly all that we are ever meant to be?
"Sherlock, what did they —" the words die on his tongue and he pauses, clearly at odds with himself before clearing his throat. "Nevermind, don't answer that…"
have friends. I have never been the type to be surrounded by people. John is the exception, not the rule. But, in truth, I’ve never seen him as a friend, because in reality, he is so much more. He always has been. To say John is just a friend is to say that Bach is just music. It is so much more than that. A fierce uniqueness that defies everything that I have ever convinced myself to believe in.
Had Irene been right? Had she really left that much of an impression on him? Was John Watson truly so jealous that he would break his own code of honour in order to recapture something only he thought to have claimed? I brush the thought from my mind; just because he is jealous does not mean that he wishes to be more than what we are.
I swallow thickly, battling the demons fighting to break free inside of me. He can't know; I don't want to put this on him if I don't have to. I've done enough as it is. "John, don't —" I begin, but it's no use. He's already gripping my hips, manhandling me into a position to turn me into the light so he can see.
His hair stuck up in all directions and the little pang of affection that shot through John's chest forced a knowing smile to his lips. "So, I did all right then?" he asked, allowing his cheeky side a bit of freedom in the easiness between them.
Sherlock huffed softly, letting his fingertips brush the stubbled edge of John's jaw. "Don't be daft," he answered, his voice raw and gravelly in the quiet of the bedroom. There was no venom in it -- one could actually say it was tinged with fondness -- but the intent was all the same. He pulled his hand free from John's, bypassing the tactile examination, and the doctor nearly protested but he fell silent when Sherlock tugged the blindfold from his head.
Not a single word posed a question but John couldn't fight the soft smile that creased his features. He teased the tip of the feather over Sherlock's nipple once more before nodding slowly -- not that Sherlock could see him. "Ah, so you have been paying attention then," he chided, smirking playfully. "Alright, so what is it then?"
Also want to give shout-outs to CarmillaCarmine, MsScarlett, and thinkanddoodle_batch for their encouragement, input, and always being there to kick my ass into gear when I need it most! I couldn't do it without you guys! *blows kisses*
“Listen, about last night—“ He takes a breath; I hold mine. “If you want that to be everything — just two people finding comfort in each other — that’s fine. It can stay in this room.” I frown. It doesn’t sound like a question directed at me; rather an assurance to himself that this is all it was. ‘
Finally, filled with frustration, my lips and tongue betray me, and my restlessness bursts from its dam. I don’t beg, not quite, but the desperate plea coats every word. My brain triggers some sort of ridiculous self-defence mechanism, inserting its own form of code for what I really want to say, and interpreting his response in its own cruel and destructive way.
His focus shifts back to my groin and the careful attentiveness he’s displayed all this time falters slightly. There is a hunger lurking in his eyes now, something dark and desperate. It’s a selfish, burning desire that seems to manifest itself in his fingertips as they caress the heavy weight of my sac, rolling my balls gently as his thumb brushes over the thickening shaft of my cock.
He dipped his tongue into Sherlock’s slit, lapping eagerly at the trail of precome pooled in the divot. Another moan, another heavy shudder and John couldn’t wait any longer. He sucked the head of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth and swirled his tongue around the ridge enthusiastically before hollowing his cheeks and taking him in as far as he could.
I cross the room in three long strides, carefully taking the envelope from its place on the shelf before staring down at the elegant scrawl that adorns the thick parchment:
Watson. A relationship? No, it’s clear I ruined my chances at that a long time ago. But I certainly didn’t expect the cold shoulder.
I wrack my brain for a moment but I don't have to wonder for very long. In true John Watson fashion, he's a step ahead of me, throwing everything I considered to be possible into disarray. His fingers intertwine with mine, and I'm reasonably sure my confusion is clear as glass on my face, but he gives nothing away. His expression is blank, a thin veil of assurance the only visible hint to what he's thinking.
As John’s tongue teases my lips apart, a flicker of memory flashes to the forefront of my mind: John kissing Sarah. John holding Sarah and chuckling softly, his lips brushing over the shell of her ear as he had pulled her down on top of him. He hadn’t seen me that night, hidden in the shadows of the hallway, but I had seen him. I’d watched them, not for long, but enough to build quite a resentful outlook on the woman, regardless of how clever she might have proven to be.
“When’s the next one?” I ask, sinking defeatedly into my chair. My entire body seems to hum with pent up energy I can’t explain.
I gasp again, this time my fingers scrabbling for purchase in his sand-coloured hair, gripping the dampened strands, as he hollows his throat and starts to bob his head. I can hear the gentle slap of his free hand as he jerks himself in time with the motion of his head and it’s almost too much for me to process. I’m close and I know it won’t take him long to push me over the metaphorical edge. Every pass of his tongue, every vigorous suck of my cock drives me closer and closer to orgasm.
John's cheeks burned with arousal at the obvious struggle for dominance. As much as he wanted to control the entirety of the situation at hand, he couldn't deny the energy still buzzing between them and he conceded to his lover's terms with a curt nod. "You're on..."
“Are you going to tell me where you really were?”
John is off to war and Sherlock gets the first of many letters. In the meantime, the Alpha is called in to assist Scotland Yard on a case that is about to turn Sherlock's world upside down.
PTSD trigger warning for this chapter
I could practically hear the smile in her voice, but I refused to turn around; to yield that level of control over to her.
The memory softened his gaze for just a moment, and he was glad that Sherlock couldn't see it. He needed to keep a firm hand on the situation or else Sherlock would definitely try to overrun him during his attempt to win their little wager. Even though he wanted to try, John was fairly certain that Sherlock was going to win anyway -- no one could best him where his mind was concerned -- but that didn’t mean that John wasn’t going to give it his best shot.
Special thanks to CarmillaCarmine for her notes and to MsScarlet for being my amazing beta!! I’m so grateful for you both!
"Nope," John cuts me off, his words sharp but weak as he pushes his way inside. He's shaking his head and eyeing me intently, but I can't work out what's happening. "No, we're not —" His voice cracks but he tries again. "You're not —" A shallow breath cuts this attempt short and he sucks in a deep breath through his nose, his gaze hardening as his nostrils flare and the fingers of his left hand curl and uncurl tellingly. "Not like this," he finally manages. I'm still not sure what he's getting at, but I don't have the courage to speak again. I've never seen him like this, so out of sync with himself, as if his entire world has been upended.
I take a dry cloth from the drawer and begin to wipe it down, removing the thick layer of dust that had coated the arm. I should have asked Mycroft to take care of it. Although, I had asked him to take care of John and look at what happened.
I can hear John’s frustration mounting with every word I say, but I struggle to keep a hold on my desires. It isn’t fair. My brain is spiralling out of control, unable to focus on anything other than John and all the uncertainties buzzing between us. Why should he get to decide everything? Is that how all relationships like this work?
I swallow thickly, a silent nod my only acknowledgement of his invitation. As we climb the stairs, my thoughts flutter briefly to the woman — Mary — from the restaurant. Her blue eyes blaze in the back of my mind, judging me for whatever it is that I am about to partake in, but I close my eyes and will her disapproval away. Deep down, I know that she doesn't understand the complexity of my relationship with John. I know she isn't aware of the intimacy we've shared, but still, she threatens everything I've fought my way back for.
Special thanks to the most amazing writing wives I could ever ask for: CarmillaCarmine, writingoutloud, and enterthetadpole are my absolute lifelines. At one point in my life, I would have said that writing is a solo thing, but these three are proof that it isn't. I don't know how on earth I would be able to write or even post without them looking things over so I am eternally grateful for their support. Thanks for being here for me guys! It's because of you guys that I even have the courage to post this chapter right now, so BIG BIG BIG hugs to all three of you! Love you lots, guys!!
“What did you mean?”
John’s hand jerks and twists then goes still at the base of my cock, throwing my senses completely off track. Before I can panic though, something completely unexpected happens.
“Okay. Very well, it can be — that.” It’s not okay, but I don’t know how to say that. How do you admit that the intimacy you shared was more than the other wants it to be? If he wasn’t emotionally invested, if he was just using me to get off — then how could I ask him to stay?
If I try hard enough, I can kid myself that this was where we were headed — that John was finally succumbing to himself, accepting his dual identity. Sometimes as if we were on the cusp of something more.
I brush my teeth with the bathroom door open; John sat on his phone by the door. For a long time, I’m sure he’s going to act as if nothing happened. Soldering on, like he always does. We crossed a line last night. Not in the initial comfort, but in the moments after, the whispered conversation and gentle touches. I push down the disappointment, berating myself for even hoping that this time would be different. It is queer affection, something John can’t bring himself to face.
Or at least, she should be, but I fell. I fell to save him, and she replaced me. A woman to fill the void. Even if he doesn't, I know that his attraction isn't restricted to one gender, but it still stings to see that he chose her, when he could have had me.
The clink of the handcuffs spurred him on and, within moments, John had his head between Sherlock’s thighs, nuzzling lazily at the crease of his balls. A heavy groan filled the room, giving John the motivation he needed to trail his tongue up to the base of his lover’s shaft. It was exhilarating, having Sherlock at his mercy for so long. Add to that the beginning and desperation that comes with having a naked consulting detective on the edge for roughly an hour and John had himself quite a lovely thing indeed. He dragged his tongue up the hardened curve of Sherlock’s shaft, relishing the way his breath hitched in his throat and the sound made him smile. The tip of his tongue hovered briefly over the detective’s slit just as a ragged moan broke through the quiet of the room.
He takes his time preparing me for his final intentions, coaxing broken whimpers and guttering moans from my lips before finally pressing into me with a breathy moan of his own. It's slow and careful this time, an honourable act in the midst of all of the indecency that lies between us, and it's unlike anything I've ever experienced. His arms are wrapped around me, holding me close. The insatiable hunger and bruising possessiveness have faded, leaving in its wake a devastatingly raw and passionate intensity that I can't explain. He's a force to be reckoned with like this with the slow but steady pace of his hips combined with the deep and sensual slide of his lips against mine. It's more than I ever thought I'd have the good fortune of knowing, but I have to confess that it only leaves me with one earth-shattering conclusion: the way John Watson fucks is nothing compared to the way that he makes love.
I throw the windows open and vacuum every surface, pausing a few times to empty the canister. It's cathartic, working my way through the flat, wiping away the evidence that this place hasn't been lived in for years. I hadn't expected John to move out. Perhaps I should have, given the dread rising in me at the prospect of being here alone. This isn't my flat, it's ours, and it's unsettling being here by myself. Knowing that John isn't just in the next room.
“John,” I whisper across the pillow, studying the lines of his face and wishing I could see what was happening in that war-torn brain. The cases; each hair raising case around London, I know about. I can make those nightmares easier. But his life before me, the scorching heat and flying bullets of Afghanistan, that’s a part of his life I’ll never understand. There’s a gaping hole in my knowledge of John Watson — a considerable portion of his life that I will never know about. I don’t mind that, normally. I never want him to see the part of my past I keep hidden away; my messy spiral further and further into addiction. But on nights like this, I wish I could make him feel slightly less alone. I wish I could analyse every memory in his head, pull apart each moment and deduce exactly what he needs to feel safe. But I can’t.
He’s sat in the empty bathtub, his head between his knees, trembling hands covering his head. Veins pop out on the back of his hands, and gentle, yet laboured grunts fill the air, coated in restraint.
From that day on, our isolated events become a recurring arrangement. We finally start to acknowledge each other’s needs in mutual agreement, responding to the subtle cues and triggers that let the other know what we need most and when we need it. Sometimes, it is something as simple as a mutual masturbatory session — getting each other off quickly and efficiently. Other times, it is rough — rutting against each other till we’re both tipped over the edge. Then there are the times we fuck, John dominating me and cleansing the very depths of my mind… but still, neither of us says a word. My mind quiets for a while, my body finally sated. Inevitably, it calls out once more, and we start all over again.
him. Captain Watson.
We stand, dazed, for what feels like hours — watching the moor burn in front of us. John stays glued behind me, his steady breathing keeping me tethered to the ground beneath my feet.  My ears ring with the echoes of the blast, every nearby noise sounding far away, as if I’m underwater. It almost feels like being high — senses are both heightened and dulled at the same time, accompanied by a numb dissociation. Except instead of the brief moment of euphoric bliss, all I can feel is a sickening sense of dread, vibrating through my skin.
Once dry, we shuffle into the bedroom, where I gently dress him in his pyjamas and lead him over to the bed. Without protest, he sinks beneath the covers, shutting his eyes as soon as his head touches the pillow. It isn’t long before his breathing becomes shallow, and he falls into a silent sleep.
"John, oh John…" Sherlock moaned, his voice nearing a shout as his wild curls tossed and turned from side to side as he came. The headboard rattled as his back arched and the cuffs pulled tight for a moment before falling slack -- the detective's body going limp beneath John's.
Without hesitation, Sherlock's response came loud and clear as his own neediness threatened to betray him. "Your mouth," he answered, shifting slightly so that the chain of the handcuffs strained as he pulled it taut.
A swift bout of dizziness threatens to overtake me as I realise just how close he is — just how wonderful his tongue feels against my dampened skin — but I try to calm my thoughts. It almost startles me as John’s hand brushes the wet curls from my temple, rinsing the shampoo from my hair, before his hand slips past me to grab the bar of soap and my curiosity piques. His fingers flex with a concentrated effort and, before I can fully register what is happening, he brings the soap to my shoulder and presses it against my skin in one fluid motion.
I am pulled from my reverie only by the feeling of tea being pushed into my hand. I look up, and John is smiling at me, his eyes darting over my face as if trying to discern what I’m thinking. My heart skips a beat and I am reminded that no matter what happened that night; regardless of my new-found knowledge about what lies beneath his clothes, he is still John. He is still the man that follows me blindly into danger; makes me tea in the morning and reminds me to eat when I’ve forgotten. If we never have sex again, if this is just some anomaly — I still have our friendship. I still have the knowledge that he loves me; not necessarily in the way I want but as his friend. Whilst I wish I could have more of him — I have this, and it is enough.
