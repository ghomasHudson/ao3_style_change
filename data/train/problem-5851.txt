“You are a devil, you know that? You are one of Satan’s spawn.”
At first, Steve thinks that Tony’s might protest, but the prince rethinks it and nods. Steve smiles at Luke and he brings them to a corner where silk straps and lingerie adorn the walls.
Steven glances at him. There’s only resignation in his expression. “You will try.”
Hopping up, Blu plays around though it’s resentful with offended looks tossed Tony’s way. Somehow, he feels like the lion is humoring him. As he decides this is a losing cause, Blu steps over to the dissembled suit, picks up the back plate in his mouth and lifts his chin to Tony as if daring him to shoot the light again.
“And Natasha came, through the dimensions. She came and we all left. She couldn’t bring the humans through the dimensions. But Clint was there.  I don’t know how. Or what. But he was there. We went to the roof. I didn’t want to go there. I wanted to go to the garage, get a car.” Tony shook his head and wrapped his arms around himself. He looked small and defeated. “You were so weak. So pale. Ashen really.” His words grew quieter, nearly mumbled.
"He has been under the influence of the Sith Lord for too long," Jedi Scholar Peggy had said, her dark eyes mournful but firm.
Tony hears the radio with its static laced music fill the diner. It’s a small place, Tony can tell because of the acoustics. He always had a good ear, his mother taught him piano as a youngster and he took to it easily enough, though it couldn’t hold his attention much to her chagrin. The place isn’t full to capacity, Tony can tell due to the clank of silver ware and the muted sounds of chatting. “Small place, not a lot of people here. You come here often?” Internally he hisses at the cheap pick up line.
“This way to the Widow.”
Steve bends down, taking Tony’s mouth. They kiss tentatively at first and then hungrily, biting and nipping, searching for a way to be more than just two mortal beings, to be one being made of two souls. They break and panting Steve says, “We do it together.” Whatever comes next after the realm.
“No. Not as a spy.” He laughs. “I could never be a spy. Not according to Natasha.”
Steve zipped his bag closed. “Yeah. I know you don’t like the idea, but we need to find the rest of the pack.”
“What? What happened?”
“Oh, okay,” Steve says and backs into the chair. He drops into it as she leaves. He shouldn’t be here. But he has to admit it’s worlds better than he imagined. He thought it might be something like the Stalls from Medieval times. It’s a relief that it’s not, but at the same time it puts him off balance. It feels more like a spa than a place people are fucking their brains out. He giggles to himself and realizes he’s more nervous that he thought.
He nods. Sometimes, Wanda’s older than her years. “I won’t Wanda, I promise.” He disconnects and tells himself he told the truth to his friend. As he pushes those doubts aside, Steve taps his implant comm and rings through to Natasha. It takes a few tries before she answers.
"My father's company was built on a war machine, and some don't realize it, but there were indentured servants and slaves in those companies even in the North. The North is not so innocent as it believes."
“Maybe. I went to see Doctor Erskine. It was close to when we were going to preform Project Rebirth. I’d just been selected and met the team – your father was one of them. It wasn’t the first time I saw him, but it was the first time I met Howard. He intimidated the shit out of me.” Steve bites into the loaf of bread. “I went to see the doctor to talk to him about Rebirth and to figure some things out.”
Steve didn't move. "It's what you've been keeping from me," he corrected Tony, whose mouth twitched into a frown.
“Good. I overslept,” Steve said. He rubbed the back of his neck sleepily. The windows were all still open. Yellow California sunshine glowed behind the linen curtains.
“Let’s get you to bed.”
Tony drove him every morning and he was overly chipper in the car. He whistled along with the radio and pointed out birds and dogs as they drove past the park. He parked at the curb and the engine idled.
“I just wish I could identify the foreign substances we found in his systems. Chemicals that our spectrometers don’t recognize— it’s the strangest thing. Like he’s been to space. And the metal in his chest. I don’t understand it. I hope he’ll know more than we do,” Bruce said.
How terribly confident. Now the he’d missed his chance, he was relieved he hadn’t given the gift. He couldn’t even remember what he had been thinking, giving that to Steve now. Things between he and Sharon had seemed so serious lately and it wasn’t easy for Tony to watch, but he accepted that they would probably end up together permanently in some capacity. Married, even.
"Okay," Tony said, not making a big deal of it. He put down his tablet. "Let's get you some help."
They waited, all with the same question on their minds: what had happened to Steve Rogers?
“An accident, huh? You know, there’s a lady in a night gown telling everyone who’ll listen that a crazy guy was standing on the roof,” he said softly.
“Are you hot? The temperature is voice controlled.”
“Sorry. It’s none of my business.”
“Sorry. I know it’s confusing,” Tony said, putting a pitcher of milk and a tureen of sugar on the table, “The portal collapsed just after Steve made it through. Sharon collapsed it, to prevent Zola from—”
“Genetic testing and carbon dating verify your story, Captain. And you were right on with your estimate. About twelve years, give or take. I’m sorry. I can’t imagine going through that,” Hill said.
They prodded the bones and took an x-ray; it turned out that the hand, wrist, and lower arm had been gruesomely broken and healed without being set. There were masses of scar tissue and dense bone growth. It wasn’t something one expected to see in a super soldier with a healing factor.
“Are you?” Bruce asked.
Tony glanced away from the scenery at Steve. “What about now?”
“Any update about Sharon, yet?”
Bruce came out and attempted to flatten a crumpled dollar bill, jamming it into the slot on the machine. It hissed and spat the thing back out at him.
“Thank you,” Steve said.
“You don’t know how hard I’m trying, Steve, to be what you need right now. But I don’t know where the boundaries are. I don’t know how to pretend you’re just—”
"What do the names mean?"
Steve chugged half a glass of orange juice and wiped his mouth on the back of his hand.
They never speak Ian’s name aloud, but they talk about him.
“I lost my child.”
“I don’t understand. He never left New York. He never even left that subway.”
“I couldn’t, not before,” Steve explained, “But they did s’thing to me in Zola’s lab. Affected the, uh. The serum. It’ll get better. But I’m closer to human.”
Tony picked him up from his appointment personally in one of his fast cars that he liked so much.
FR: According to SHIELD’s lab reports on their own research on the samples, they ran scans looking for living microorganisms, isolating and ignoring Captain Rogers’ own microbiome, and hey found nothing. This means one of three things: your samples are the only ones containing virus, the virus actually originated on Earth after the sample came back from the other dimension, or that their scans did not pick up on the virus because it is inactive—
“Do you want a glass of water? You can rest, you don’t have to talk right away,” Tony said, to Fury’s dismay.
Tony debated what the right thing to do was.
Steve was sleeping, but sometimes Tony stayed up like this and listened for any sign of a nightmare. Shouting, or muffled sobs, the sound of the alarm clock knocked to the floor by a fit of thrashing.
Address: REDACTED
In the end, his fear over overstepping a boundary and making Steve feel uncomfortable won out over his worry, and he showed Steve again where to find clean towels and then left him alone.
“And they named one of their suns after a bastard. That's amusing. Who were they? The Phrox?” Tony asked.
Tony looked him dead in the eye. “You just lost Sharon. I’m not about to have this conversation with you. I’m not going to put that on you.”
"You're hiding something from me," Steve said.
The work was frustrating. He couldn't talk about it with Steve and SHIELD only begrudgingly cooperated with him when he needed records from their labs. Fury laughed in Tony's face when he showed up with a box at the labs and announced he was here to collect their samples. It took a lot of paperwork and arguing to finally have what he needed shipped over to his Tower. The thing was, Tony had worked on projects for SHIELD in the past and he was all too well aware that they were comfortable cutting corners when it came to due process and bending the rules when they felt that it was justified. They were being a pain in his ass on purpose. If it wasn't this-- if it wasn't a project that would prove to be meaningful to Steve-- Tony probably would have told them just where to shove it by now, accompanied with a rude gesture.
“Is he going to be okay?” Sam asked Tony after.
He waited until Tony checks on him for the last time, feigning the even breathing of slumber. Then he slipped down the elevator and reacquainted himself with the streets of his first jungle, like a tourist.
“You’re here now,” he said. Steve’s breath was hot and humid on Tony’s chest and his chest was heaving with the effort of breathing. Heat poured off of him like a furnace.
He cut himself off.
Tony turned around, finally acknowledging Steve. Realization flashed in his eyes as it dawned on him that he would have to explain himself. In the glow of the portal, he looked every bit as secretive as heh had been acting and Steve felt a flash of anger.
Pym pointed a handheld light at the incision site, prodding the carnage of Steve’s pectoral muscle like he was a cadaver at medical school, not a human— their friend. Bruce swatted his hand.
“Aren’t you going to get up? I can hear your stomach grumbling, Papa.”
Curious, his psychologist nodded. “Of course.”
“You never sleep so late.”
“I’d name it The Eye,” Ian said, sitting cross-legged on the bed. “Because it’s so small and white. Like it’s staring all the time. In the pictures you painted, it always looked more yellow.”
previously undiscovered Bermuda triangle, in a well-trafficked Brooklyn subway station? And where was Sharon?
“You should be right here,” he said, though he wasn’t unfamiliar with the feeling. “I know it feels wrong. You lost someone close to you. It’s natural to feel like you’d rather trade places. But you lived.”
“May I open the window?” Steve asked.
“Steve?” Tony said, “I’m coming in, I have breakfast.”
Bruce and Hank did excellent work, staffed with a fleet of doctors, nurses, and technicians. They mended his broken body, pumped him full of fluids. There were dozens of broken bones to set, ranging from the stress fractures in arches of his feet to a fully shattered rib. Doctors have to be able to maintain a level of clinical detachment, and as a scientist, Bruce was capable of this— but he grimaced pulling pieces of bone out of flesh with tweezers. The damage was horribly familiar; the Hulk often left bodies in such mangled condition, and he shuddered to think of what could have done this.
TS: Show me. [Pause] Uh, huh. Hm. That’s sure a virus. That’s a weird looking bugger, isn’t it? Enlarge… there. Thank you. Hm. [Pause] Run this against all known viruses in SHIELD’s database, save anything that matches up to ninety percent.
“You feel confined,” she observed.
Tony slowly started moving again, throwing a tie haphazardly around his neck and stomping on his suitcase to zip it up. He pat his pockets, looking for his wallet. "Okay," he said. "I'll try."
In that moment, Steve was painfully human.
He looked around the room in confusion. Then, he opened his mouth and said in rasp, “Sharon?”
Tony got there just in time. He yanked him backwards by the back of his shirt and expected Steve to be pissed. Instead, Steve sobbed wordlessly in his arms until the sky turned light and he ran out of tears, staring blankly at the ground with empty eyes.
” Tony said, holding out his phone to show Steve a picture of a house in the woods. “Have you ever been to wine country?”
Tony arrived at the scene after the firefighters already quashed the flames. It was good luck that it rained because the blaze could have taken out half the block in this crowdeed neighborhood Steve insisted on renting in. The fire trucks’ lights flashed red, parked all up the block where tenants of neighboring buildings stood in the streets in their nightclothes. Pedestrians gawked and slowed as as they passed by; nobody had put up police tape yet, and a crowd had gathered to brave the weather and stare.
When he got home, Tony lingered. “I was thinking maybe we could do Chinese tonight? I’ve been meaning to try the place on the corner, the pork wonton soup has rave reviews.”
“I missed you so bad,” see said, voice cracking. He leaned into Tony all of a sudden, burying
dead child, but not strong enough to ignore it entirely,
Everyone who wanted his attention or his time or conversation, doctors and counselors and Fury and SHIELD and even Tony, they were all a distraction. Steve tried to tune the world out and keep his hands busy so he could crystallize every precious memory into something concrete which would last.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Tony said. Steve saw a barely there smile on his lips as he put bread in the toaster, though. He opened the fridge and said, “We’ve got orange juice or apple juice.”
Until the fire. It was raining that night.
Tony just smiled. He perched himself on the arm of Steve’s chair. “Not to worry. I’ve had my staff go through the house and take the bottles back down to the cellar. All that’s left to drink above ground is sparkling juice. Though, of course, it’s Napa. If you want wine, it can be arranged.”
Fury and Hill cared about Steve but tact came second to duty. They debriefed him about the harder details. Tony was not invited to the— well, let’s call it was it was— the interrogation, and when Steve was returned to the room, his cuffs were gone but he looked more downtrodden than before.
“I’ve survived worse than a Napa valley honeymoon, Tony," Steve said
JULY 4 2012 21:51
shiny new uniform and sent him on his way,” Tony said, jaw tight, barely containing his frustration. “And you know Steve. He won’t submit to something like that voluntarily. He’s always fine, until he isn’t.”
There he was, huddled under a wilted tree alone on the sidewalk. He was wearing the brand new uniform given to him by Fury but it was blackened and singed. He caught Tony’s eye and turned his head up, revealing the soot on his face that had settled into the creases of his skin.
“And Jet can help, when she’s cleared to leave,” Steve said. Fury looked skeptical that would happen at all. “I’m going down to the holding cell to help straighten things out. She’s a good girl, she’s just been through a lot. She lost her family, when things fell apart.”
"I'm going to try and get better," Steve said when he came down for breakfast, the morning after. "There are people who would have wanted me to."
“The food, for one thing. Which is just funny, I guess, because it was so horrible. Especially at first. But it became home, you know? Familiar. And the sunsets. There were two suns.They didn’t set together, except once in a blue moon. When they did, it was... indescribable. The light and colors. It was special.”
and Steve crept in on tiptoes. He jumped when he noticed Tony sitting there.
"Steve, you don't understand," Tony said.
“Shit,” Steve said under his breath. “Sorry. I didn’t think you’d be up. Was just gonna slip back in and go t’bed.”
He finally stopped and Steve felt his stomach churn. It was clear what Tony was afraid of. The implication touched a bare nerve and he couldn’t speak. Blood rushed in his ears and he picked at a hang nail. Finally, he said, “Nothing’s going to happen. But I don’t mind you staying up, if it makes you feel better.”
. My brother. He was dead, but I feel him, now. He’s
It was just the kind of home he would have liked to give Ian. “It’s gorgeous,” Steve said. Tony grinned.
“I understand.” He did— painfully well.
"Do you need help with your bags?"
“Probably not,” Steve admitted, “But I’m guessing the computer can help.”
But Steve didn’t pull away. He dissolved under Tony’s hand like cotton candy in water.
“I carried all of it up to the roof and set it ablaze. It was a way to say goodbye to the past, I guess. It felt… necessary. I thought the rain would keep the flames under control. I guess I wasn’t thinking clearly. I feel foolish. I’m so glad nobody was hurt.” He ran a hand through his hair and then looked mildly startled when it was cropped short. He must have not cut it for a long time.
Perched on the edge of the leather chair with his arms sense at his sides, Steve looked ready to bolt at the drop of a hat. His psychologist sighed, crossing her ankles and setting her notepad in her lap.
"I think-- fuck. FRIDAY, calibrate the sensor to detect Unicorn Virus," Tony said.
He struggled with the key in the lock because it had been so long since anyone had stayed here. When the door swung open they dropped their bags on the hardwood floor and switched the lights on. It was a sprawling farm house with two stories and a wrap-around porch. Steve was surprised to see that it looked larger on the outside than it felt inside. Finished all in exposed wood, it felt rustic and quaint— not at all like the modern architecture of the Avengers tower an the industrialism of New York.
Sharon looked radiant in white.
Tony looked relieved and made dinner. He made fried egg sandwiches with no cheese that they ate on the coffee table. Tony dipped his in ketchup. He turned on the TV and flicked through channels. He let Steve pick what to watch. Steve didn’t miss TV, but now he was glad for the distraction and empty noise it provided. They left their dirty plates on the coffee table and watched baseball on the couch.
PRIMACY PHYSICIAN: Dr. Bruce Banner, MCR # 33333- REDACTED
“You don’t have to. Not if you don’t want to.”
"Holy god," Tony said.
Steve decided to kill himself and she made his bed with military corners and the snuck up to the roof at four in the morning on a hot night. He stood there for a long time looking at the sky. He stepped onto the edge and swayed in the breeze, a sneeze away from death. For the first time, his mind was totally quiet.
“I can’t imagine, Steve.”
FR: Hazardous material.
RELATIONSHIP TO PATIENT:
Steve blinked slowly, realizing that Tony had been left out of the loop.
“Oh?”
Maria Hill’s mouth gaped open.
His own bedroom grew stale with disuse because he was spending all day out in the countryside and all night in Tony's bed, and they didn't talk about what it meant between them or try to put a label on it again which Steve appreciated. He still felt too much like a widower to try and put words to his feelings. That didn't mean he wanted to be lonely. He wasn't a man of words when it came to his own feelings. He wasn't good at talking to the therapist. He wasn't good at differentiating anger from fear from sorrow. They let their bodies talk instead. When Steve would think of California in the future, he knew he would always think of the taste of grapes, fresh off the vine at the peak of harvest in August and September, and the feeling of Tony's body smashed against his own.
Steve was slow to start but then went on for a while.
He lost the pamphlet in the laundry and panicked thinking Tony might have found it. He couldn't relax until he found it, still folded up in the pocket of what he'd been wearing. He went to the support group alone and listened to fourteen sad, middle aged adults talk about how they suffered the ultimate loss. He didn't talk. He left early.
, Steve. When her turned on his machine I felt him, his heart beat and his brain waves, his scent and his voice. His signature, like he was alive somewhere in the cosmos. I have not felt it since—”
It worked better than intended.
"Portal?" Steve said with a frown, dropping his sketchbook.
, he corrected himself internally. Only one sun, here. He wondered what the Phrox would name it.
“That’s what addicts do,” his mother said, in his head. “They sneak and they lie.”
“No.”
“Don’t I know it.
“But then again, the last time I got soup in this neighborhood, I got food poisoning. So maybe that’s a sign,” he said, opening Steve’s fridge and taking stock of its meager contents. “I could whip up some… Omelettes? Fried egg sandwich? Oh, no cheese. Remind me to have some groceries sent over. Aren’t you supposed to be putting on weight?”
“I’m just not sure what to expect, I guess. We’ll see.”
And now, he loved Steve and it wasn’t any easier. His heart broke. He would do anything for Steve never to look so broken ever again.
She put her foot on his shin and applied enough force to make a promising threat to break his tibia. “Tell me what that machine does. And do not try to lie to me. My omni-sense misses nothing. I can hear your heart. I can smell your fear. I can sense the signature of every life, like a scent, and I’ll never forget yours. If you lie to me, I will hunt you to the ends of the universe and you will never find a place to be safe again. Look into my eyes and know my word is true.”
“He’s been through hell. Frankly, I’m surprised he survived,” he said. “It doesn’t make any sense.”
“That doesn’t make sense. Is it possible someone manipulated the data?”
Steve was careful not to roll his eyes; he made every effort to exhibit respect for this woman tasked with the impossible, concealing his disdain. It was not her fault.
Steve held his bag in his lap as the car bounced over the uneven dirt road. Tony looked radiant in the light of the rising moon. His skin shone and he couldn’t stop smiling. They turned onto a different dirt road with a private sign, and they drove through miles of grapes, plump on the twisted vines.
The back of his throat was dry when he opened his eyes. It was raining outside, droplets splattering angrily against the window which remained airtight. He couldn’t tell the directions of the suns because the clouds were so thick.
“Nobody lasts forever, Papa,” Ian said. Steve didn't look at him. He shut his eyes. Rain pelted the window pane and Steve willed the white noise to swallow him. There was no rain in Dimension Z; water rose in thick fog to a higher altitude where it collected in distant mountains and found its way back down to the ground through rock springs and the crystal river.
Then he saw, posted on a bulletin board under the roof of the front step of the church, a flier advertising a support group run by the church. There were spare fliers tacked to the cork; Steve took one for himself. It was for parents who had lost children. A chill rushed through him. His mom would call it God’s hand at work.
That was the mystery; survived
“I really don’t mind.”
?” she hissed, grip tightening. Her fingers pressed into his arteries feeling his life pulse in her hand. Tony swatted uselessly at her iron fist. His face began to turn reddish purple and he kicked his chair over, papers fluttering to the ground in the wake of his struggle.
Tony left.
The store clerk wandered close to the window, scrutinizing Steve through thick glasses with a frown. He turned the lock inside the door and flipped the sign off, so the buzzing stopped. Closed. The man glared until Steve kept walking. He must look like a bum.
Steve points to the now black television hanging on the wall in the living room. “Said so on the news and weather channel. It’s the storm of the century, they’re saying.”
“I think it will terrify them.” He smiles. “Yes, this is the one I want.”
Steve heals, though more slowly than he normally would. No one really explains why the serum seems to be sluggish, but Steve suspects it might have something to do with the regeneration of his gland. It isn’t the first time Steve suffered a gland injury. When he had been abducted in his search for Tony’s would-be assassin, Steve ended up with his gland removed only to regrow because the stem of the gland had been left. The mad scientists were harvesting his gland in order to use it and the serum as a weapon. This time, when Steve voluntarily removed his own gland, he’d taken the stem out. Thoughts about slicing his own gland out roil his stomach and he swallows down the bile. He doesn’t like to think about it. It terrorizes him. He’d done it for a purpose though, one he still believes in. He’d do it again, if it meant he would be free. If it meant Tony would be free.
“Oh, so you did the homework this time,” Tony said and closed his arms around himself. Scratching absently at his beard, he asked, “So what’s the occasion?”
“Careful,” the leader said. “They have a tendency to lose parts at this stage.”
“You called me that the first time we made love,” Tony whispers and bends his body over Steve. “I’ll be okay. I promise. Hank, Bruce, Wong, Strange, and I – we went over all of the data. This is going to work.”
“Barely any flying at all. I have some launch work done but not the maneuvering or the landing. It’s be damned dangerous,” Tony calls out. He lifts his armored hand. “Over there.”
“You do,” Nat says and lays a hand on his arm. “He loves you. Isn’t that enough?”
Tony had frowned at her, scrunching up his face. “No.”
CHAPTER 2
He peers over his shoulder, to the unseen and far distant town. Sam will take care of his people, he’s sure of it. But he wonders if he’s been manipulated into a trap.
The Brother emblem on his arm sizzled again and he grit his teeth. He had no other choice. “JARVIS?”
“Oh that’s lovely,” Tony says and stands up. “Well, thanks for the talk. You can nap now.”
Tony wails and pounds forward into Steve. His hands steady on his shoulders, not letting him move. Deep in his groin, Steve feels the pending curl of orgasm forming like a storm inside of him.
Tony moves to stand up and he takes the tray; Steve situates himself on the bed so that Tony has full access to his wings. He lies on his stomach, head pillowed on his folded arms, wings spread out behind him.
Bucky as the Winter Soldier comes to life, his words are slightly off – as if Ultron has a difficult time with articulating the character. “Maybe to convince them, they should see the recording.”
“Don’t make me. We do this together or not at all,” Tony says.
“I hacked him.” Tony rounds a corner and tugs Steve with him.
Bucky was massive, and back then, back then Tony hadn’t been Iron Man. He’d been an arrogant rich guy with a chip on his shoulder and more money than sense.  Bucky’s shoulders weren't as wide as Steve's but he was bulkier, thicker with muscles rippling across his chest and abdomen. He was bare chested when he attacked Tony. The metal shoulder and arm glinted in the fading light. There was no stopping him. He was a train, mad and wild, with the intent to crash into the side of a mountain. But Tony was not a mountain. Not by a long shot.
“He went to get some fresh air,” Natasha said and then snapped her fingers at him. “Hey, Leader, focus here.”
“You want to fake date me?” It sounds like a weird gay romance novel. “Fake date. I don’t know.”
He wants, he's desperate after so many years of loneliness, but also because Tony intrigues him, sets fire to his skin, and steals his ability to even focus on anything else but those eyes, his intense eyes. He cannot stop himself, the lure of Tony compels him forward and, even though he ends up only inches from Tony's face, he doesn't pull away. "Yes." It sounds like a whimper. It sounds like a prayer. It sounds like a whispered plea.
“You said your name was what?”
When Steve climbed his way to consciousness, the first things he noticed were the music and Sam sitting close by. He spoke and Sam smiled. It should have been all that Steve needed to feel grounded again, but the dissonance running like an undercurrent in his core caused him to flinch. He shifted awkwardly in the bed and Sam jumped up and placed a hand on his shoulder.
He doesn’t concentrate on it, lets the data stream to the side of the lens, forgotten and ignored. “But you think he’s the one?”
“Then maybe you two fools should have let Vision do it in the first place,” Sam says. His dark eyes are steely and possessive.
“Then come back to bed,” Tony said and shifted. He opened his arms and realized he was nude. There was a fine ache in his ass that he recognized. He smiled. “Come back to bed.”
Steve looked away, his face lit by the sunrays dappling the living room through the window. The blush of embarrassment radiated. Tony could see the blue of his eyes and how he jaw twitched in anger. “Bucky is going to be there,” Steve said through clenched teeth. “You can come or not. But I’m going.”
Tony smiles.
“Well, if you don’t mind the company, maybe we could get something to eat and, like, do the Mantra thing together?” Tony said. His eyes were hopeful, but at the same time Steve glimpsed the shadow of the ‘other Tony’, the one the world saw on a daily basis. He lurked on the perimeter, waiting for Steve to shoot him down. The ‘other Tony’ would appear and that fake smile would be plastered on his face and he would shrug off Steve’s dismissal.
He rested his chin on Steve’s chest. “You’re a mess.”
“Please, Steve. Just wear it and think of this as a mission. Clint and Scott want to see their families again,” Tony says and there’s a desperate glint in his eyes. Steve put it there – that pleading look- Steve’s responsible for so much.
Tony’s voice breaks, “I know. I know.”
Bucky grabbed his shoulder and jerked him around to face the pack. “God, you are more of an idiot than I remember.” Bucky released him, pointed to their group – their pack. “You had the Howling Commandoes once. You have a pack now. They’re here to help you.”
“Well, if at first you don’t succeed.” He shoulders the backpack with the light lunch he packed and begins to scan the pathway ahead for any objects in the way. “Step down.”
“Maybe it’s blind,” Tony comments.
him this week. That is
“Once again, though, I am sorry I jumped to conclusions. I should have known better. Before we contracted with the Widow’s Brothel, we insisted on a full background check on you.”
“Starlight.” Tony shrugged. “I have a bed that’s on a balcony. I just rest a few hours every night, right after the sun’s gone down.”
“I thought I was already doing that,” Steve murmurs.
“He’s clear?”
“Cagey is more like it. He would make a better spy than a General to tell you the truth. He has his ways though, always getting information from places and people who’d never suspect,” Tony says and then they step out onto the Concourse, but on the level with the more expensive shops. “This way I would think.” He leads Steve toward some of the shops that had previously denied him service. Tony notices Steve’s reluctance. “Stop fidgeting. And stop pulling at your collar. You look divine. Just act the part.”
“I’m fine.”
Rhodes walks away but not without turning several times as if to check that Steve has, at least, paid attention and stay put. Strange quirks at eyebrow at him, but Steve has no compunction to explain anything to him. He draws his attention to the rest of the table. Acknowledging the older couple, Steve says, “Steve Rogers.”
The Red Skull throws back his head and howls with laughter. “You are still the boy from Brooklyn, all bravado and righteous goodness. I truly loved watching you lap at my feet for so many years. How do you even know what the right thing to do anymore is?”
friction. “You’re so responsive.” Steve remarked, reaching down between them and working to undo Tony’s belt buckle. He lifted Tony’s hips to get the belt off, setting it down next to them along with the discarded shirt. He flicked open the button on Tony’s pants and pushed them down, freeing his hard, red dick. Tony whined through his teeth at the sudden cool air, his dick jerking towards his stomach. Steve sighed. “So desperate, too. You’re lucky I’m a top. Come on, sit up.”
“Are you okay? What’s wrong? I don’t understand why you’re acting so hostile about this.”
They continued walking down the street and Tony pulled out his phone, absentmindedly scrolling on Twitter. Steve looked over, rolling his eyes. “Really? They weren’t
question, which, God, seems like the 50
Tony grinned at Steve as he approached, holding his arms out. “It’s good to see you, big guy.”
Tony mentally screamed at the dated reference. Instead of ribbing Steve for it, he shook his head and smiled. “Was it Peter’s birthday? I can’t believe the kid’s finally 18.”
Tony ignored Steve, occasionally liking a tweet. When Steve finally stopped walking, Tony looked up, irritated. “What?”
is. Are you happy now? Whatever this was, I just ruined it. So whatever you have to say isn—”
Steve swiveled around on the bar stool to face the speaker. The obnoxious, catty voice could only belong to one person.
“I have to suck your dick to get you to say one nice thing about me? In that case, I wonder what I’ll have to do to get you to pay for dinner together.” He wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck and lowered his voice. “I guess I’ll just have to find out for myself.”
“Why do you say that?” Tony asked as the hairs on the back of his neck rose. What the hell had Steven heard? It is common practice for omegas to gather intel on other alphas as they grouped together. The idea that Steven may have picked up on something is unsettling. “Did you hear something? From who?”
“I have already called the ambulance. They have arrived, sir. Please remain calm.”
“Like a mother hen in some ways,” Steve said. Natasha kept her coven in line with a firm hand, but she was never unfair. “She cares a lot. She told me not to get too involved with Tony, you know.”
“We can schedule the pick-up.” Tony examines Blu. “But I need a copter big enough for a large animal.”
“You dream a lot?” Tony asked and it seemed like an odd question.
Bucky waits as if he’s hoping Steve might reveal other things, private things. But Steve hasn’t told anyone what happened, he’s kept it tightly hidden, wound down deep, so the barbs twist and stab only into his heart. When Steve remains silent, Bucky huffs in frustration and then says, “Seriously, buddy, you need to get laid.”
Steve gets out of the way then and, as the medics work, Tony wakes up. He’s confused and disoriented. Steve goes to his side and tries to calm him down as Tony protests being taken from the cabin.  The medic that spoke with Steve shoots him a glance as if to ask for help when Tony refuses to leave the bed or the premises.  Steve waves his hand and goes to Tony’s side.
“Shit, sorry,” Steve said and kicked the door shut and locked it. “Tony? Are you- shit, you look like hell.”
“Go ahead, be my guess.” He pokes at the fire and tries to ignore the lion.
“You know,” he said as he picked at the fries. They weren’t quite the same as American fries, especially since the Brits called them chips. “It’s hard to believe he’s the same person. I mean Bucky and the Winter Soldier.”
“Yeah. I am.” Steve says and lays his hands over Tony’s. “Let’s ride, Tony.”
Tony stands next to him, his red eyes like flames from the Iron Man armor. “And what was that?”
“And the serum, it’ll fix it right?”
“Somewhat, it isn’t as simple as it sounds, but I’m giving you the five minute version because I’m not certain I can stay awake longer than that, right now,” Steve replies.
She gathers him to her and embraces him. He can smell the beta pheromones drifting in the air about her. Her scent is strong and vibrant, so different than Steve’s. She holds him until the sobs racking his body settle and quiet. When they part, she looks him in the eye and says, “I’m going to go and get some coffee, something to eat. Are you going to be okay?”
“Yes, there’s a workroom attached to the prince’s workshop.”
“There’s extra toothbrushes in the bathroom.” Tony points. “I sometimes drop them in the toilet and so I need extra. Top left drawer of the vanity. Hope you like spearmint toothpaste.”
“No, he’ll do. I want him ready to go to the bonding rooms in thirty minutes.”
Tony deflates into the pillows of his bed, knowing full well he’s going to argue to go back in and to help Steve. This isn’t done yet, not by a long shot. Sam goes mute but his stare bores a hole right in Tony’s skull. Trying to distract himself from the hate in the room, Tony turns to something to avoid further personal discussion. “Is Steve-.”
Steve willingly goes with Tony all the while his mind leaping off cliffs as he tries to reconcile the man in front of him and the Iron Man he’s heard about all these years. As they walk under a trellis laden with purple flowers, even Steve ducks to avoid the heady blossoms. It surprises him that his allergies haven’t taken flight. He’d always been prone to the worst attacks when Brooklyn went through it’s rare growing season. A torrential rain always led to a riot of growth. The ashy ground transformed to lush vegetation and foliage if only for a few sparse weeks a year. Unfortunately for Steve it always meant he couldn’t breathe for that month.
“And I got the rest.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“More Hydra cells in play? Maybe a power play?” Steve asked as Tony sidled up to him. Just being near Steve right now soothed the sting of his injury.
Tony forks the strawberry in his fruit bowl. He keeps a finger of his other hand over the lip of the bowl to find the fruit. He can tell what the fruit is by the size and the texture as he stabs it. “How about a motorcycle and you drive.”
“Isn’t that enough, for one day?”
“But here you are,” Tony said into his hair.
The fridge rattled when Tony closed it with concern in his eyes. “You gotta eat, Steve.”
TS: Yes. Please. [Inaudible] I'm going to name it the Unicorn Virus.
"Oh," Steve said, pacing. He stood in front of the window and stared out at the endless, even rows of grapes. The peak of the season would end, soon. The workers would all go home and Steve would really be alone. The thought terrified and excited him; he could almost conjure Ian's image already, ready to torment himself just because he was being given the opportunity. "When do you think..."
TS: — and my equipment is
“I think I’ll go with a Twix.”
It was obviously a joke, but Steve felt a twinge of regret when Tony’s expression flickered. Then Steve wondered how Tony had this all planned and out together so quickly. What if it had been, at one point in the planning stages, a honeymoon? Steve didn’t flatter himself to think that Tony would have ever proposed to him, but Tony constantly surprised him.
“Sure, yeah,” Tony said, caught off guard, “Do you need a ride somewhere?”
Steve hadn’t had many lovers. Tony and Sharon had been the two he had loved longest; he had found a home with them. Tony’s home was only home with Steve in it, but he didn’t say so. He didn’t want to come on any harder than he already was.
. Her signal? Gone. That shouldn’t be possible. Even if something happened, those microchips are designed to continue broadcasting.”
“Will you eat something? Humor me?”
He went somewhere else.
“People get tired for other reasons, too.”
Tony stayed awake for just about forty-eight hours before he finally lost momentum. All the will power and anxiety and caffeine in the world was no match for sheer exhaustion. Sharon remained missing. Steve slumbered. With the watch still curled in his hand, Tony nodded off in a fold-up metal chair beside the hospital bed, to which Steve was handcuffed.
“Bleeding on the upper right abdomen is under control.”
Whisked away to a lab deep inside SHIELD’s Hub, Doctor Pym and Doctor Banner inspected him absolutely baffled. Nano fluid flowed from the needle into the chest cavity, which looked like hamburger meat, destroying the remnants of foreign material inside his body. Hank leaned in close as though he could see the microscopic bots.
She turned her head sharply, looking at Steve with hard eyes. “The
Sam came over on Tony’s invitation and visits Steve. Tony explained the situation but Sam didn't truly get it until after he and Steve went out together in their uniforms to run off some steam.
“Don’t thank me, I should be thanking you.”
He closed him palm around the round body of the watch. The metal was cool in his fist. He leaned against the featureless wall beside a vending machine and shut his eyes. Over the past few hours, he’d developed a blinding headache from the fluorescent bulbs that lit the windowless halls.
Jet stared at him without blinking. The portal hummed, a low vibration they could all feel in their bones. She slowly tilted her chin up, tearing her eyes away from Tony's feeble form to look into the portal. She closed her eyes and reached out with her omni-sense, which Tony could only assume was some kind of enhanced awareness. Her eyes flew open, reflecting the cool light emanating from the portal.
The machines purred and beeped steadily and displayed Steve’s vitals, a sea of numbers and meters and dials. His face was lax and still, but even in his comatose state, his mouth seemed to turn down at the edges. There was pain in his expression. How could his appearance have changed so much in just half an hour? Was was the mysterious metal in his chest cavity? How could this bizarre occurrence be explained? Some sort of
It was like they transported, but just a few yards backwards. One minute, moving with the same velocity as the subway car. The
“I’m glad you like it. I’ll give you the grand tour.”
Steve frowned. "'No one?' Tony, what's going on?"
Steve shrugged. The dream was tainted now; there would always be an empty space where his son should be. He said, “Some things work out better as fantasies.”
“You shouldn’t startle me like that,” Bruce said. Iron Man ignored him, metal boots heavy on the concrete floor as he crossed the laboratory. He pushed Hank out of the way, crowding around the operating table. Steve’s skin looked like wax under the cold lights.
FR: Sounds like a long night. Would you like me to have coffee delivered?
FR: No results. It appears to be quite unique.
"Okay," Steve said. He didn't feel relieved. He felt miserable. His skin broke out in goosebumps when a gust of cool air blew in through the open window, ruffling the curtains. He sat back on the bed. Tony stepped between his legs with his suitcase in hand and leaned down to peck Steve on the lips. "I'm really sorry. I hate to leave. Will you be okay here without me? You can call me. Or your doctor, or Sam or anyone, if you start feeling bad again."
“Let’s get you to bed, honey,” Tony murmured, pressing his mouth once to Steve’s hair.
“This is impossible. I thought it was an illusion. But his word is true. I feel home through the portal. And," her voice cracked, "I felt—”
TS: This was in Steve.
Steve reached for the salt shaker and yawned. “Since when are you a morning person?”
“I’m trying to understand. I can see that you’re in pain,” she prompted, “You’ve experienced a trauma. Would it help you to know that studies show that talking through a traumatic experience reduces the risk and severity of post traumatic stress symptoms?”
water down the front of his shirt. Tony grabbed a napkin and sat next to Steve. “Here you go, sunshine. I didn’t think you could get drunk. Did you have to drink a whole bar.”
“Frankly, I’m not even sure he’ll be able to get back up again.”
“What can I do?”
The three scientists stood in silence, chilled by the question.
“Can I open a window?” Steve asked.
Tony hated that answer. “This is bugging me,” he said. “Nothing adds up. And Sharon, she’s just
Time passed.
And he wanted to ask him what he was thinking every time Steve did something strange, but he knew better. His only choices were to watch helplessly, or to find some way to help. Tony preferred action.
Tony stood there for a moment with his hands in his pockets. "I'm going to go down to the lab, then. I'll be there, if you need me. Or anything."
“We have to consider every possible explanation for what happened until we have answers,” he said, “One potential explanation being that the real Steve went into that subway and was somehow replaced by an imposter.”
“What do you think we’re doing here, Stark? Playing Operation?”
And Steve was on with Sharon lately, but he and Tony still shared that bond. Amicable and bizarrely close, Hank had a hard time understanding how their relationship worked. Then again, most people did.
“You’re too nice to me,” Steve said, “I don’t deserve you.”
“Or stolen things.”
"What if I don't want to go back?" Steve said.
The doctors busied themselves with work, studying the samples taken from Steve’s chest in the meanwhile. They were scientists more than medical doctors, and despite the anxiety of the situation, they were highly interested in the strange samples.
As he thought about Steve his undead body went through it’s resting cycle. He really didn’t sleep, like he really didn’t climax and come. There was no sperm to release at the height of his sexual orgasm. During his resting phase his body only went into a kind of short term stasis. He was awake and aware but in a modified paralysis state. It wouldn’t take long for his body to repair itself especially with new blood. It did make him vulnerable to the world outside and the dangers to the undead. Natasha had joked once about not wanting little critters chewing on her body when she rested.
“Oh yes you can. Don’t change, Steve. Okay? Don’t change.” Steve nods and then Sam dons his uniform jacket. “Take care, Captain.”
“Trying again,” Tony warns, and Steve knows this time to hold on tight as the gauntlet fires.
Ross gestured to the corridor. “This way. This way. Don’t waste time. I want this to work.”
“You can say that again,” Tony said but then held up his hands in surrender. “Hey, I’m not saying I’m not part of the problem.”
Tony showed him his wrist. “Lucky me.”
“Tell me you can do this,” Tony asked.
“Well, tell me where Thor and Loki have gotten off to and I might be able to persuade Odin to take up the mantel of the war again.”
She squeezes his hand before getting up to leave. When the door whispers closed, Tony looks around the room. It’s a small lounge. A double seated cushioned chair, a darkened TV screen. A few other single chairs that look less comfortable and some unremarkable art on the walls. A single window out into a world he does not know. Nothing special.
“It’s hard to see beyond the beast.” Her gaze looked far away as she said it. Coming back to herself, his mother patted him on the shoulder, kissed his cheek, and told him Happy Birthday one more time before leaving him in the dark with only a tiny nightlight that projected the universe on his ceiling. It was the only one his father approved –
Erskine and Peggy - going by their given names and not Jedi names since they had cast aside that part of their heritage - listened and argued that the worlds of the galaxy still shook with instability. Going forth would lead to more upheavals and could be detrimental to the future. That night, General Pierce turned on them. The encampment had been burned to the ground, Sarah and Bucky's parents managed to escape with their lives but little else.
“Smart move,” Tony says. “You already know too much about the paparazzi.”
Steve stays quiet for a minute and then asks, “You said it was happening to you? The seizures?”
Steve cradled his face in his hands. “Tell me that you don’t love me, Tony. Tell me that you only look at me as your next meal. Tell me you think of me only as your caretaker.”
Tony smiles that engaging turn of his lips and his eyes sparkle. Steve only rolls his eyes; he has a feeling this is the way it’s going to be – Tony charming everyone in town.  “Phil, thought you would have met the new blacksmith by now, this is Tony Stark. Phil Coulson.”
“Now, approach it like a scientist,” Bruce said even as Tony continued the chant. “Analyze it. Try to understand it.”
He meets the gaze of the omega and somewhere deep inside of Tony, he feels a pulse, a throb as if something new and alien awakens within him. “I’m deadly serious, Pep. It’s him or no one.”
“Hmm. You have a lot of these kind of books in the store?” The customer looks at the shelves.
“I’m a man of science. Hocus pocus doesn’t work here.”  He scans the horizon, according to his information they should be approaching the landing area. “Do you remember anything else?”
He helps Steve to his feet. Quickly, they both gather their clothes but while Steve doesn’t dress, the prince dons his clothes. Tony escorts him to the bath. “If you need anything, just ask JARVIS.”
Leaning Tony offers Steve the soup. He accepts it. “Thank you, Tony. I do appreciate it and you.” Steve stares down at the thick and hearty soup. It is a comfort and exactly what he needs right now. “How’d you know? How’d you know soup would be exactly what I need?”
“No, nothing like that,” Steve says. “If we, if I do this with you, I bond to you, and you bond to me. The implications and complications are multifold, cataclysmic.”
“What could I do? What?” Steven yells at him then, the anger, the frustration reddens his expression. “Do you want me to cut it out? Cut out my gland and break the bond? I could do that. I could rip it out with my bare hands. Right now.” His eyes are wild with rage. “What do you want me to do? I did what you asked. I tried to take care of you. I stopped you from drinking so you wouldn’t make a damned fool of yourself. I read the Viz-nets. I did my homework like any good little omega. I know who you are, Tony Stark, better than you know yourself.” He runs hands through his hair and closes his eyes. He murmurs why why why a few times before he glares at Tony again and says, “I did what had to be done. What else would you have me do?”
“Nice,” he says.
“Yes,” Strange replied. “His soul resides in pieces, more so than any of yours does. His soul is splintered into each and every one of yours. Because of this the larger the pack gets the more dangerous it is for him. When there are issues amongst the pack, he feels them greatly, more than any of you do. When the pack doesn’t unify, he is the one who suffers. He’s not only the pack leader but he’s the one who gave his soul to each of you.”
“Steven,” she calls and he crosses the street over to her.
Steve slumped forward, his hands hanging over his knees. “It seems we might be visiting one another in our dreams.”
Bruce came out of the bathroom with an old dirty pair of jeans on as he was pulling on sweatshirt over his head. “Do you know how they work?” He freed his head and adjusted the sleeves (they were too long). “I never spent a lot of time worrying about them. I mean, when I started to hear about them as a reality, it was scientific curiosity but since I couldn’t partake I just ignored it.”
“That’s not going to happen,” Tony said as JARVIS fit the pieces into place. “You know it’s not iron, right, it’s an alloy. A really strong-.”
“This one – I love this one the most,” Jane says and places it on the drafting table. It’s one of Tony’s eyes. “I love how the one eye is just an eye but the other one – it’s like you used cubism to get a look into his soul. The different images on the cubes-.”
“On a space station? Isn’t that a wasteful use of water?” The more Steve lives out of the Beyonds, the more he realizes the rest of the Conclave really hasn’t a clue how hard life actually is.
“What’s for breakfast?” Tony says and his chest aches. What he would do for some ibuprofen or a big bag of weed.
Clint glared at his open hand as if he might set it on fire with his stare, but after a long moment of evaluation and study, he accepted the offer and clasped Steve’s hand. The soul bond opened as Steve felt his astral projection harmonize with Clint’s soul, but at that moment a loud horrible squeal raked the air. The train juddered, causing them to lurch forward, and their hands broke apart as the soul bond screeched between them. Clint collapsed as the sound of metal protesting and twisting screamed through the air. People let out cries of surprise and the train jerked. Steve braced himself as the train continued its harrowing journey, half on and half off the tracks.
Steve trails behind him, scanning the horizon for anything untoward, but what would that be in a virtual reality existence? Ultron is brilliant Steve must remember that, he knows what Tony knows and probably more because of his vast control of the internet. The AI would hide as much of his wicked plans as possible, in the best places possible – like a family having a picnic out in the fields.
Tony scrutinizes Rumlow and then turns back to face Steve. “Is that what it was?”
“Not yet,” Tony says. He leans forward, giving Bruce the opportunity to free himself which he does but he goes and sits down close to Tony – offering what support he can from there. “What did the recording say?”
“You mean a popsicle? You want a popsicle?” Steve contains his laughter.
“Well, you know how it is. Laws, some of them, kind of get forgotten, left on the books for ages.” Ross grins. “So I could make you, Stark, responsible for your omega’s actions. Unless, of course, he’s not your omega.”
“Jericho,” the leader says and smirks at Steve. He gestures for some of the soldiers to come over and Tony’s climbing to his feet, his hands off his head, begging.
“Let’s see it then,” Happy said. Times like these reminded Tony why he kept Happy on the payroll as his personal guard. Even with Iron Man, he needed someone with a steady hand and head to help both Pepper and him.
The conversation had ended after that and Steve saw the writing on the wall, felt his fate sealed. He’d once dreamed about being something more to Tony, especially on those long winter nights as they discussed the formation of the Avengers Initiative – a real one. One that would be a partnership across the globe. It would grow, but without the partnership Steve truly dreamed about. Now, he plans to do what he can to ensure Tony’s safe passage to the next rim.
“What could you possibly mean by that? He’s dead. At the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. There’s no reason to keep hunting for him. You already found the stupid magic cube,” Maria hissed. Tony rarely saw or heard his mother being cruel. Part of him shivered in her wake.
As Steve ushers Tony away, he hears Pepper asking people to go back to their seats. She’s not answering questions thrown at her but she’s taking it like a trooper as she steers the audience back toward current Stark Industries advancements and that, yes, the research and development department is headed by Tony. Yes, he’s responsible for the majority of advancements brought to market over the last decade by Stark Industries. Yes, even blind.
Looking down, he pulls out a bit so that he can see the outer ring muscle abused by the width of his cock. It’s perverse and beautiful. Tony rocks into the man, allowing himself the luxury of sensation as the man tries anything to release his cock from his hold.
“You don’t have to make up for what Loki did to you,” Steve said and wondered if he was only practicing for when he would eventually find Bucky.
“You have what you need. It’s all in your brain. Right now, in this outer area, let’s call it the sanctum you can make anything in your head and make it real. Once we get into his programming, we have to have what we need. He’ll shut us down. We won’t be able to take anything else with us.”
He frowns in response. He only agreed to the red because Luke kept pushing it and he just wanted to finish the endless dressing session. The red will only emphasize his pale skin tones and make him look sickly. “I think the white or the blue. The red is too bold, too bright for my skin tone.”
“Great. Start fire.”
Steve gulped in a breath and then in two words changed Tony’s life. “Your parents.”
“Wha-?” Steve manages.
“Can you get the back gate open?” Steve asked and curved away from one of the cars as they tried to smash into the side of the Audi.
“But what is that message going to be?”
“There won’t be anymore data. I’m going to take the glasses and the implant and revert it back to the last version. It’s the only way to get through the gala.” Tony throws himself back onto the bed. “I’m going to spend the new few days being poked and prodded by Strange. Pepper’s going to mother hen me to death, and I don’t even want to think about what Rhodey is going to do to me.”
A bang against the fogged glass startles him out of his thoughts and he glimpses shadows in the room. A press of a shoulder hits the darkened glass and then a howl resonates. Pep glares at him, but Tony only shakes his head. This is right. He can feel it in his bones.  The shuffle continues and both Tony and Pep watch the shadows dance across the glass. He wonders how beaten his omega will be. Turning, he taps on the screen. The AI immediately responds.
“I believe he should have been found.” She lowers her gaze. “At one time, we gave up and thought we would leave him to his grave. But there were those who never would, because Steve had something they desired. And some desires make men wicked.”
“I didn’t fault you, I didn’t like it though,” Steve added. “But we did get Vision out of it. He’s worth it.”
“Yeah, yeah, tell me I’m not walking into a trap,” Tony says and doubts himself. He should have looked further into Stane’s dealings, the possibilities of arms deals with terrorists, the possibility that he might be involved with more than just dirty under the table deals. He shouldn’t be hot shotting around, acting like he’s a hero. He’s nothing, he’s Tony Stark. Fuck up.
“You are a strange one,” Tony mutters.
“Well, that’s comforting.” He reaches and grabs the ridge of the plateau. “I’m going to pull us up now. Hang on tight.” Steve musters all his power and heaves in a swift but decisive motion. He’s able to leverage his weight and Tony’s to harness enough strength to get them over the ledge. Steve rolls onto his stomach and allows Tony a second before he gets to his knees and unbuckles and unties their makeshift carrier.
Steve lifts his gaze and states, “I told him I was a homosexual and wanted to resign from the project.”
“Why are you trying to send me message telepa-.” Tony stops, glares at him, and then does a double take before he stands up and paces in the small space. “I cannot believe it. Those were real? Your real thoughts?”
“See if there’s a mass or something actively growing in there.” Tony runs his hands through his already messed hair.  How the hell could Steve end up with a tumor in his head? The serum mustn’t be functioning. “So there’s something wrong with the serum.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Steve says but doesn’t move, his eyes roll in his head and he swallows convulsively.
“But I know, god, I’m smart enough to know what they did to him. I’m not angry with him anymore. Not about that. Am I angry with you for not telling me?” He stops, breathes out, and then says, “Yes, I am. I will be for a while. Not enough not to ask you to forgive my recklessness when I found out about Barnes. I’m angry and it will take a while for me to get over it. But I’m not angry enough to not love you.” He shifts and says, “I can’t see you die, Steve. I can’t. God, when you nearly died after the whole SHIELD thing, I thought I might never breathe again. Just thinking about it, I hyperventilate. When Natasha called and told me – about this. I don’t think I saw anything but red for days. I don’t care about some bonding gland or whatever. I’m still bonded to you. I want to try this again. Somehow, please.”
Steve stands and lifts Tony’s chin. Tears well in his eyes. “Am I doing the right thing, Steve?”
“What is it, Captain my Captain?” Tony had asked, as he kissed a line up Steve’s throat.
Finishing up, Steve finds a thick white robe next to the bed that he’s sure wasn’t there when he left the room. He shrugs and because he has no clean clothes or his robe, he puts it on. It’s beyond luxurious. They don’t have anything like this at the Brothel. He rubs his hands up and down the arms -soft and plush. Not exactly sexy. Hopefully, the prince will see beyond that little issue.
"Not really," Steve had mumbled and Tony's face must have said it all. Steve leaned up on one elbow and added, "Don't make it weird. I can't have entanglements. That's not how this works."
Steve laid his head against the back of the elevator as the marks on his arm and chest burned. During his time as a SHIELD agent and leader of a dissembled pack, he learned as much as he could about the pack dynamics, but that was what his mother would call being ‘book smart’.  He needed to be more than smart about it. He needed to be tactical. That was his strength. Throughout the years of being pack leader, Steve tried to fish out the reason why some people bonded and others did not. He attempted to figure out why members were named certain roles. None of it made sense in the beginning and after so long, Steve was fairly certain it would never gel and mold into anything he could shape or understand. Why was Bruce Healer? Why was Tony Beloved? Steve closed his eyes; he did not need to go through that hell again, beating himself up for thoughts that swayed toward the deviant. Two years passed since the first bonding and the benefits of the pack eluded him.
One of the things Steve loves the most about mornings is watching Tony wake up. Often he delays his morning run to be able to see it. Tony isn’t the kind of person who wakes up immediately and jumps out of bed ready to go. Maybe it’s because he spends so much of his time awake, foregoing sleep for the pursuit of the mind and the advancement of technology. The world would be a bitter cold place without Tony Stark to lead the way in so many different fields. Even now, there’s a summit at the United Nations about clean energy and the great difference Stark technology has brought to the field. They should be attending it – but they won’t – not today – they have more important things to do today.
Tony remained silent. After a moment, he muttered an excuse that didn’t even make sense to him and left Pepper standing in the middle of their renovated penthouse. He hurried to his workshop and stood in the center of it. On the laboratory benches his latest work was spread out. All of his projects directly related to the company. Nothing was about Iron Man or the Avengers. He swept up his life as an Avenger and put it away, threw it all out. He accepted his place – by Pepper’s side, even if it meant that hollowed place inside echoed and grew – a vacuous wound. He touched where the arc reactor used to sit. Empty, cold, an abyss of his heart.. He couldn’t even feel his heart beat.
At that, Steve leaned in and latched his mouth on Tony’s left nipple, enjoying the little squeak it brought out of Tony. After just a couple of seconds Tony was squirming even more, gasping and jumping as Steve’s mouth worked. His hips ground upward, his hardness pressing into Steve’s backside. Steve moved to the other nipple and Tony cried out, a little embarrassed but mostly surprised with just how good it felt. Steve looked so good doing it too. Tony had never dared to think of a moment like this, he’d always pushed the fantasies away to try and preserve
“It’s alright, as long as you don’t go stupid on me like that again. Just talk to me, I promise my brain works just fine. Maybe you should get yours checked.” Both of them laughed, and Steve moved a little closer. “I didn’t mind kissing, you know. We can…continue.” He said, brushing one of his fingers along Tony’s jawline. Tony’s heart skipped a beat. He nodded and smiled coyly, moving in to capture Steve’s mouth. He lifted his hand out from under Steve’s and put it lightly on Steve’s waist. At first, they kissed gently as they had before, letting the moment last. After a moment, Tony pulled away and said quietly, “Is this really alright? I feel like I was really…really a jackass. You don’t have to—” Steve kissed him, his tongue briefly reaching out and contacting Tony’s lips.
“It’s mine, too. And by the way, I wouldn’t mind it so much in real life,” Steve said – his own awareness of stating it out loud seemed distant. He’d finally said it, admitted it to himself at the same time.
As he zeroed down on it, Steve yanked his arm away and pulled the cuff over the brand. “The serum will deal with it.”
Steve tries not to notice that the boy is angling them away from the tenements where he lives. Steve glances at his companion as she trots along, happy and full of joy. It's not something he usually sees in her.  She's as sickly as he is. But right now the sun and the moon couldn't stop her from playing with the boy's - no James jimmy?   - Companion. He concedes. "She looks happy enough."
Natasha straightens and agrees without consulting Steve. He’s less than pleased but then again, they’ve been functioning as a unit for years. He’s not the leader here.  Natasha passes Steve as she goes to prepare the message. He touches her shoulder.
He would not be at the end of the universe’s horrible joke. Reaching out, he touched Steve’s hand again. Their souls synchronized and it ached in Tony’s chest as he murmured, “You made a mistake. How could you ever think it? I’m not your Beloved. I never was, and you’ll never be mine. I’m sorry.”
Tony shifted and got up on one elbow. “Are you going to be okay?” He wiped away the last of the tears.
Thor studies him as he answers the question. “I cannot tell you, but I do know that my brother dreams of riches and power. He has always felt slighted by the fact our father left his lifework to me, instead of him, though he be the better student.”
“None of this looks easy,” Steve says as he lounges back at his desk. The chair creaks its protest and he flips through the screens on the pad.
Obie must have taken a moment to compose himself because the next words were measured but seeped in anger. “Your company was about to go under. You mismanage everything Howard. You drink too much; you fuck too many women. It’s time to stop this and listen. If you’re not going to listen to me at least listen to your wife.”
CHAPTER 6
Now, that Tony is a memory and Steve must face the world and all of Human Space alone. Bucky accused him of living like a monk. “He’s not wrong,” Steve murmurs into the dark and no one answers. It’s been so long since he’s touched or been touched by anyone. He shouldn’t care, he loved and was loved in return. It should be enough.
Tony ran his hand through their mixed come on Steve’s chest, writing words and pretending they would stay like tattoos.
“Yes. And you repeated it three times. Is that a special incantation I should be worried about?” Tony says and studies him. “Steve?”
“Do it!” Tony says and throws his arms open as if to invite Steve in.
“I guess I’m starting to understand what it means to be Healer, and why the other guy is important as well,” Bruce said and retrieved his glasses from his shirt pocket.
The door swipes open and a big man steps in. He’s wearing the Stark family colors of red and gold. “Mer Rogers, his highness awaits.”
“Not sure entirely.” Bruce gives a halfhearted shrug again as he toys with the wires. He doesn’t focus on Tony. “He talked a little about your drinking problem and Pepper, I do remember that.”
“Can you tell where it is?” Tony asks.
“According to resources: ‘A personal assistant, also referred to as personal aide (PA) or personal secretary (PS), is a job title describing a person who assists a specific person with their daily business or personal tasks.’ In the case of the prince this may encompass ensuring his personal well-being, health, and welfare.”
Heading toward his own suite of rooms, Tony passes the rack and the lounge they used last night. His memories are still warm and inviting. After the ship landed on the Council World and they disembarked, Tony admits now he felt a thrill watching Steven survey the wonder of the Council World. It is unblemished, unlike many of the other human worlds. Here the world is verdant and blush with life. The water runs freely and the lands grow lush and lovely. The whole of the continents is green with forests and gardens while the rest of it is covered with oceans and lakes. It harkens back to the ancient world of Earth. Here on the Council planet there are no factories, no industrialized regions. Just beauty. Clean air, clean water – a luxury on other planets and for most of the human populace, but not here.
“Tell me that he would condemn you then. Tell me?” Tony says. Though his words are firm, his tone is gentle.
Tony has no idea what the hell Steve’s talking about, but right now that’s par for the course. Shit, he’d even play a round of shitty golf – the fucking most boring game ever – if he could get out of this hell. “Well, your friend there said we have to get out of here now. I think she’s right.”
Tony raised his hand, warding off any further explanation from Steve. “I don’t want to get into who had it worse. It stunk. Our own country did that to us. They tore apart everything. They turned me into this thing. And they-.” He stood up and Steve saw, for the first time, that his whole body shivered. “They tore us apart. They ripped everything away from us. And just for that, I want to kill them all over again. I want to go back to the States and I want to burn it to the ground. I want to fuck them over like they did to us. And you want to know why?” He didn’t give Steve a chance to answer. “Why? Because they took you – you, the most important person in the god damned world, away from me. I promised you, years ago, that we would be together and that I would be there for you.”
After a long romance through the ups and downs of Steve adjusting to modern life and to life as a human, they finally tied the knot for real. Steve continued to work for SHIELD for a while and headed up the Avengers when the Chitauri attacked. They maintained separate apartments but saw each other often. When SHIELD fell and they found out about the Winter Soldier and Bucky, it was the final straw. Steve left the mantle of Captain America to Sam Wilson and Tony left his armor to a newly Air Force retired Rhodey. Both Tony and Steve left the high profile life of the Avengers behind and settled in upstate New York, not far from the Avenger’s campus. Tony still worked R&D for Stark Industries and for the Avengers, but Steve stayed home and wrote and illustrated children’s books under the pseudonym; S.G.R. Stark. Everyone knew who he was, but they all pretended to keep the obvious secret quiet.
It’s a simple lift that will carry him to the gantry that leads to the ship’s open airlock. Steve steadies himself, getting ready to meet a client is one thing, getting ready to meet the prince of the most powerful region in the entire Conclave is on another level entirely. The lift slows and gently stops. Steve thanks the powers that be for that one since he doesn’t want to fall flat on his face. He rolls the suitcase toward the airlock and several guards greet him. They do a thorough check of his implant, his person, and his possessions. He passes and a charming woman with strawberry blonde hair and a perky smile greets him.
Bruce is right – the media went crazy last year with the revelation that Captain America and Wolverine were an item. He remembered hugging a bottle of malt liquor and watching the television reports. Logan and Steve were both hot and they were together. The media ate it up. What was wrong with Tony that Steve kept his distance even though he professed to wanting to be in a relationship?  Was it lingering feelings for Wolverine, or was it Tony and his habit of leaping off the wagon into a cesspool of alcohol. It must be the information about the drinking. “Maybe he wants to break up with me because of the drinking?”
“They’re about to do a psych eval on Steve. That can’t happen,” Tony replies and follows Happy’s silent directions on where to go next. They end up waiting at the elevator.
Reaching out, Tony opened his hand as if to allow Steve inspection. In the center of his palm, the light pulsed but it quieted and then Steve saw the old wound from his torture. With tears forming, Steve looked up to Tony’s chest to see the wound there, beyond the glimmer of light in his chest. “No,” Steve whispered and then the tears flowed, and he wept.
“So, you don’t drink blood anymore?” Steve finally had the courage to ask.
When he appeared at Steve’s bedroom door, hands in pockets and a tight smile on his face, Steve returned the smile. “Hey. You ready?”
A low rumbling growled in the distance. His eyes stuck closed and he shifted because his arms and shoulders ached. Cold. He was desperately cold, frigid enough to bring memories and images of Arctic waters smashing through glass, the tidal wave punishing in its power. Steve gulped for air and opened his reluctant eyes only to shut them again.
Now, in this vast virtual reality he only wants  to escape and find his way back to Pepper, beg her to take him back, blow all the suits again. Carefully, he opens his eyes, and a tiny moan slips out. He doesn’t mean to react, but the sheer information overload of the virtual world sends his stomach into new heights of queasiness. Colors swarm his senses, swirl around him in an array of possessed demons. He turns over and heaves into the grass.
“Yeah,” Steve says and tries not to let the idea that Tony grouped Steve in with all the rest of his staff bubble to the surface. He might work with Tony on a day to day basis, but he’s staff, nonetheless. Nothing more.
Panting in heavy breathes, Steve clambers through the drifts of snow. Each step burns his muscles and his lungs clench like they haven’t since he had asthma all those years ago. The crunch of the snow beneath his booted feet, the intake of breath, the exhale of air stirs with the wind to deafen him to much else. Tony’s not moving – that’s all Steve thinks as he clears the rocks to the small crest at the foothills. He leaps over them and lands in a waist deep drift. He refuses to let it slow him down, he plows through it like a maniac with a death wish. He hears growling only to realize it’s himself, pressing through the thick snow, the ice so jagged and sharp it pierces into his side if he falters and falls.
Steve rushes headlong first into an apology. “I shouldn’t have compared you to your father, I’m sorry.”
“How many of you have I killed in his name?” He barely voices the words. It’s too hard to accept. “He found me wandering in the woods. I died.  In life, I was an old, old man when I died.” He closes his eyes only to free more tears. They stream down his face. “He bound me to him. I had nothing and he gave me a purpose. I couldn’t remember who I was.”
Steve scratched at that light furrow he often got during times of stress. “Not because of you. Because of me. Because.” He dropped his hand and looked up at the ceiling of the fuselage. “Because I lied to myself for so long and now, now it’s over. Everything is over, and I can’t lie anymore. I have to face the truth of it. The universe has. I just haven’t.”
“And volatile like Bucky.”
“Wow, is it cold? Why is your voice all rough?” Sam stops and muffles the phone as he speaks. “Did you have an asthma attack?”
Steve jerks his head in a nod. It has occurred to him. “Could be.” He squints as he surveys the snowy wilderness around them. Spotting a rocky rise he points. “Do you think we could find shelter in that area?”
“God,” Steve spoke. He pulled Tony into his arms.
“What makes you think he even wants to come back?”
“It’s not just a bonding for you?” Tony asked. He didn’t want to assume.
Steve laid flat in order to fully face Tony. “Does it hurt?”
“The horse,” Steve says. “Make sure she doesn’t scare again.”
“There are limits, Natasha, limits,” Steve said and his words felt like barbs on his tongue. “Limits. If you say I can explore who I am – what if I think I’m so right about something? I don’t listen to you or Bruce or Peggy. What if I lead us into hell? Everything, everything has limits, restrictions. Even this. Even whether or not I should be attracted to Tony.” He stood up and started to pace. His hands quaked with fear, anxiety, and embarrassment. “That’s what’s different these days. Everyone wants to stretch the limits. Everyone wants to get rid of the restrictions, the limits.”
“Hey, I’m proud as a prince. I, at least, know how to boil water.”
As if Thor reads his mind he says, “You may always love her, but you should not put her on some pedestal. She wouldn’t want you to never love again.”
"You can't leave him there to rot."
Pepper comes in close to Tony; he can feel her presence and smell her perfume. It’s always a nice refreshing scent unlike some heavy fragrances. “The way to do this with someone who is visually challenged is that you need to go through the doorway first. Place your hand behind your back with palm facing outward. Most of the time the blind person will be holding on to your arm. Here.” She grips Tony’s arm above the elbow, fingers in and thumb on the outside of the arm. “Since Tony won’t do that for obvious reasons then you need to make sure he’s physically touching you. Tony’s very handsy. It’s not something you need to consider as a harassment. It helps guide him.”
“Tony.” The young man, the very beautiful young man, takes a step toward Tony.
“I hope not,” Steve says, and he must be turned away from Tony – looking out into the sea toward Greenland. Steve’s focus changes, “It’s cold here. Blustery. Riding with you – that was great. Now, this is beautiful but cold. I never liked the cold. Ma and me, we lost power one winter. Not because of an ice storm or anything. We lost it because we couldn’t afford the bill. We went three weeks with no heat in the middle of February. I thought I would freeze to death. I was only like ten or something. Ma cried at night when she thought I was sleeping. The idea that you could change all that. With cheap efficient clean energy? Tony, you’re going to save the world.”
